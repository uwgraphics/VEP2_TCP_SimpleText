TO The worthy Society of the Worshipful Company of MERCHANT-TAYLORS.
Gentlemen,
THe famous Acts of your noble Progenitors has awakened my Pen to set them
forth, though not in so full manner as they do deserve: What person skilled in
History that can be ignorant of the Worthy exploits of Sir John Hawkwood, whose
honored praise sounds through the Territories of all Christendom, and whose
heroic acts has by Fames Trumpet been sounded forth to the utmost parts of
the earth. This Honored person with several other magnanimous Hero's being of
the Worthy Merchant-Taylors Trade, I thought a History of them would not be
unwelcome to you, considering things of this Nature have been well entertained
by those of other Trades inferior to you. The Book of the Gentle Craft has had
a general acceptance of the Cordwainers, and the History of the Six Worthy
Yeomen of the West, and Jack of Newle^y the like from the Weavers. Daign
therefore to accept of this, and the good will of him that wrote it, who is a
Lover of your Society, ambitious of the increase of your honor, and one that
subscribes himself

Yours to serve you William Winstandly.

To the Courteous Readers.
I Suppose that there is not any one who is skillful in History that can be
ignorant of the Honorable Achievements of Merchant-Taylors; a Chronicle may
as well be found without words, as without matter wherein in all Ages they have
performed such Acts as have eternized their names in Fames Bead-roll, whether
by Martial Discipline, bountiful liberality, sumptuous structures, or
Honorable Love, still we find this noble Company of Heroic spirits to equal
(if not exceed) any of those Trades who claim the priority of chief; and may in
words boast much, but must in deeds come far behind them. Now there is nothing
encourages young men, so much to virtuous resolutions as by reading the Noble
Acts of their famous predecessors which stirs in them an emulation of the like
performances, as we read of Themistocles that the triumph of Miltiades would
not let him sleep, and the Houour of our Nation gallant Sir Phillip Sidney
reports of himself that the only hearing of that old song of Piercy and
Douglas, though sung no better then by an ordinary Chanter, but it stirred up
his valor more then the sound of the Trumpet or beat of the Drum, such is the
powerful force of History that it infuses valor above all other means
whatsoever; nor has it less effect in inciting persons to the building of
famous structures for the beautifying of Cities, or relief of decayed persons,
wherein none have been more eminent then this Noble Company of
Merchant-Taylors, as you may in part read at the latter end of this book, and
might be instanced in many more particulars, such worthy Acts being recorded to
posterity that others by reading what they have done might be incited to
imitate their worthy examples, and such is (or should be) the chief end of
writing Books, and was the main end intended in this; the basis or foundation
whereof thou will find (courteous Reader) to be a real truth, though imbelished
with such flowers of Poesy as I could gather out of Apollo's Garden, that thou
might be won with delight in the reading thereof, But I shall not enlarge
myself anyfurther, nor detain thee any longer at the Porch of the History, be
ple^sed to enter in and view the rarities where with it is stored; I question
not but thou will find something therein which will give thee content, which
being obtained I have my wish.

THE HONOR OF Merchant Tailors.
CHAP. I.
The birth of Sir John Hawkwood, how he was bound Prentice at London to a
Merchant Tailor, how he fell in Love with his Masters daughter, with other
things that ensued thereon.
IN the days of that Famous and magnanimous Prince King Edward the Third, there
was born at Sible Henningham in the County of Essex, a Right worthy Knight,
known afterward to the world by the Name of Sir John Hawkwood, who though born
of mean and despicable Parents, yet by his skill in Arms and fortunate success
attained to such high Renown and Dignity, that his name became most em^^ently
famous throughout the compass of the whole world.

In his very infancy he was of a quick and pregnant capacity, and showed many
signs of a magnanimous inclination, so that this early* spring of gassant
resolutions promised a golden Harvest of heroic performances, and that in time
he should become the admired Champion of his age.

Having attained to some perfaction of years, he was bound Prentice at London
to one of the worthy So^lety of M^rchant Tailors: where though be endured a
hard Prentice-ship, yet pains in youth ^nured him to undergo hard-ship
afterward, when being a Soldier he was forced to extremities, whereas those
that never felt the miseries of want, being brought into necessity, wanted no
kind of misery as being not inured to suffer Calamity: whilst he who had been
habituate^ to hardship under went all within invincible and ^illing patience.
So that ^^inual (...), in time ^id make his labour^ ease, and pains pleasure.
Thus did his Apprentice-ship glide away undiscerned, and Time which devours all
things had now consumed above sir years of the seve^ he had to serve his
Master, but (...) when his time of (...) nigh (...), and that he ^^^an as it
were to have an entrance into freedom, he off a sudden became a thral to Cupid,
being Captivated by the enchanting beauty of Ara^^lla his Masters Eldest
daughter, but she had before so strongly placed her affection on Ralph her
Fathers journey man, that there was no corner of her heart lest to entertain
the least, love of young Hawkwoods; yet notwithstanding he knew which way he
affections were bent, and that she had wholly resigned up her self to the
disposal of Ralph, yet did he not doubt but that his love and unfeigned service
would in process of time so alienate her thoughts, that at length he might
become Master of her affections; for well he knew that Ralph was of a froward
peevish disposition, irreconcilable in anger, and apt upon the least distaste
to forget all former though never so binding courtesses; and therefore he hoped
that Ralphs undeservings, would at length so far unblinde her eyes as not to
settle her affections where she saw no merit; and in the interim to draw her
good opinion toward him, he became very serviceable to her in what business so
ever that happened in the house wherein she had any thing to do; which she
kindly accepted, interpreting it to his good Nature, and not in the least
imputing it to Love, her thoughts being so wholly taken up in contemplation of
the seeming (...) Ralph that now she began to see with no other eyes but what
(...) her, and to think no other thoughts but what he inspired.

In the mean time imperious Love did so forment the heart of young Hawkwood
that his life became irksome unto him, sleep was now become a stranger, and
care and discontent his daily companions: His cheeks which before were as ruddy
as the blushesof Aurora, were now converted to a thin paleness, his speeches
were broken and imperfect, evermore concluding with a sigh for his period. Now
company is loathsome to him, and his chief delight is in solitary places; he
exclaims on Love as tyrannical, and blames the destinies for not being
propitious to him. Many days did he waste thus in fruitless exclamations, at
last he resolves upon the first opportunity to disclose his Love to the fair
Arabella, (for Love by concealment increases, and private imaginations adds
fuel to that fire) now long it was not e^re the blind Goddess put a Golden
opportunity into his hands, for his dearest Love being so go some miles out of
Town, young Hawkwood was by his Master commanded to attend on her, and being on
their journey, having a fit time and place, to unsold his mind to her, he
resolved to take time by the foretop, and not to let slip so fair an
opportunity, whereupon with a bashful modestness he brake his mind to her in
these words.

My dearest Love (pardon my boldness that I so entitle thee) having for a long
time took special notice of your supereminent endowments both of body and
mind, I could not choose but first to like, and then to love thee; and upon a
serious deliberation to approve of that Love. Startle not my dear at this
sudden motion for what I now propound, is that which my heart does dictute unto
me, and not aerie verbal expressions; Let not then my unfeign^ed affection
receive a rep^lle, bu^ rather a friendly entertainment, which I the better
hope, since it would be altogether contrary to Nature, that any the least
sparkle of cruelty should have habitation in so fair a sweet composed body.

Much ado had Arabella to hold from interrupting him until he had done; many
times was she about to speak, to check that love which she deemed in hi^ great
presumption, and with an angry reply to quenth that fire which she imagined was
but as yet tending to a slame; but con^tary thoughts o^efn in exposed,
affirming that it was meex injustice to repay Love with disdain, and to return
harsh words for affectionate speeches, that the Gods though angry would be
appeased with sacrifices, and there were few men so implacable in hatred, but
that loving words would mollify their wrath, then that affectionate speeches
proceeding from Love should procure anger, were quite contrary to reason, she
therefore upon second thoughts resolved to alter her first resolution, yet so
to daunt him in his Love suit, as to make him desist from prosecuting it any
further, she therefore bid him leave off dreaming of such fond Chymera's, at
least not to make her the aim of his thoughts, seeing his judgment might have
^nform'd him otherwise, that she should never be brought to stoop to so low a
lure as he, having been sought to by others so far beyond him; and therefore
John (said she) let me advise you to follow your work, and leave off these idle
fancies least if you persist I so inform your Master of you, as shall return to
your small advantage.

How welcome this Answer was to young Hawkwood let them imagine who have been
in the same condition, yet was he resolved (for all her words) not so to give
over, accounting him but a cowardly Soldier that would (...) for one shot of
the Cannon, and therefore was minded to accost her the second bout, but drawing
now near to their journeys end he reserved it for another time; not giving her
any reply at all, and therefore Arabella well hoped that she had so
sufficiently quashed her new Lover as not to hear of him in the like Nature
again; but having dispatched their business and returning again homewards,
quite contrary to her expectation, young Hawkwood began to renew his sult again
in these words.

Most dear Arabella, let not the prosecution of my former words be offensive to
you, nor blame me for renewing my suit, though contrary to your command, since
though by the one I incurr your displeasure, yet without obtaining the other I
can no longer subsist; O did you but feel those flames that burn in my breast,
you would not seek to add to my affliction. But Arabella impatient of any
further discourse tending to Love, presently replied, and can you be so bold to
insist still on that which I so hate to hear, has my former words wrought no
greater impression in you, or can your impudence imagine that what I then spoke
was but in jest? What audacious boldness has thus possessed you, or with what
extreme folly are you so misled, as to think I shauld cast away my self by
condescension to so mean a person; because some forsooth have been so fond as
to run away with their fathers servants, thereby purchasing repentance with
their own undoing, do you imagine to find the like by me, no Sir rest assured,
I am of another temper* and therefore desist from urging your suit further, and
save your breath for better purposes.

This Answer was such a ^ooling Card to young Hawkwood that he durst not make
her a reply, but hung down his head like a dull-rush, revolving a thousand
things in his mind* so they silently passed on their journey, till (with the
day) they brought it to an end, but our young Lover was so cast down, that no
sooner was he come home but ^e went to bed, pretending weariness in travel,
where we will leave him for the present, fretting and discontented at his
adverse fortune.

CHAP. II.
Young Hawkwood being discontented goes to be a Soldier, how William served
Ralph the Journey-man, with other matters that ensued.
THere was Prentice in the same house with young Hawkwood a lad named William,
about sixteen years of age, an ingenions youth who very much loved John
Hawkwood, but could not so well affect the strange conditions and humors of
Ralph the Journey-man. This William having of late marked the great alterations
that were in Hawkwood, would needs be so inquisitive as to know of him the
reasons thereof: promising (if it lay in his power) to refuse no danger to do
him good; so that with much importunity Hawkwood revealed all unto him,
conjuring him of secrecy, yet withal telling him that he was resolved since
that his time was now expired, and that he proved so unfortunate in his Love,
to forsake the Ensign of Cupid, and to p^t himself under the Banner of Mars. At
that time King Edward the third laid claim to the Kingdom of France in Right
of his Mother, and in pursuance of his title raised a mighty Army, and
conducted them into France. With there went O^^ discontented Lover, whose low
fortunes could not then ra^^e him to a higher place then a private Soldier;
who safely landed with the rest of the Army, where for a while we will leave
him to relate how William served Ralph the Journey-man.

Who soon after the departure of Hawkwood fell also deeply in love with the
fair Arabella, and understanding how strongly her affections were placed on
Ralph, he thought it the best policy to remove that obstacle out of the way
before he discovered his love unto her, to this end he framed a Letter in
Ralphs name to this effect.

Dear Friend,
I Received your Letter, and thank you for your good advice, but do not think I
am so deep in Love but that I can go out of it when I please; no, Cupids
manacles are of no greater strength to bind my heart, then a twine thread is to
hold a Giant, for Love which to others seems to be a great torment, is to me
only a pastime, in beholding the vanity of our female Saints, w^^m two or three
kind words can bring into a fools paradise: This could I instance in my fond
Arabela, who thinks she has my heart chaired to her devotions, when alas poor
filly wench, upon sight of the next fair object it is ready to take flight,
therefore rest confident that Love shall never cause my ruin, for I will never
hang it on so close, but that I will easily shake it off, and so adieu,

Your faithful friend Ralph.


This Letter had William so cunningly counterfeited, that a knowing eye could
not discern it from Ralphs own hand; his next policy was that Arabella only
should have the sight of it, which was easily done, by dropping it unsealed
whereby she was to pass, who stooping and taking it up, thinking by the
Character it had been her Lovers hand, for the more secrecy in reading it she
went into her own chamber, and perceiving his name at the bottom thereof, she
then rested confident it was his own writing: but having read it over, the
paper which before (as coming from him) she kissed with her lips, she could now
scarcely forbear from tearing with he^ hands, who had then seen her would have
taken her for one of Diana's Nymphs metamorphosed into a fu^y, such a sudden
change did th^se lines work in her heart, that what s^e before so much loved,
now she as much loathed, what before was so highly honored, is now as much
abhorred, and that which was so greatly respected is now as much disliked. O
Heavens (said she) why did you create so false a thing as man: and is it
possible such dissimulation could harbo^ in that breast? who ever hereafter
will trust to vo^s or protestati^ns: O Sun why do not you extinquish your light
since he so deeply swore, that you should sooner fall to run your course, then
he would cease to be faithful unto me. Frown Heavens at these perjuries, and O
you Gods panish these impleties, let dissimulation have his ^ust reward, and
violation of faith suffer chastisement. In this manner did she exclaim on
Ralph, whilst he remained both innocent and ignorant, and William who had
wrought this misch^ef; was the least of all suspected. Now does she alter her
carriage to another tune, shunning as much as she could the very sight of him,
such impressions of hatred had the Letter wrought in her. But her Revenge
rests not here, next she solicites her Father to turn him away, and that with
such importunity, that she will have no denial, so that hereupon Ralph has
warning to be gone suddenly, at which he much marvalled yet not in the least
suspected the reason, and now insending to impart his mind to his dearest Love,
he ^inds her so far estranged as not to be spoken withal; Not an opportunity
did he let slip where he imagined to meet her, but all his vigilance could
nothing avail, and the time drawing near wherein he was to depart, he therefore
took Pen and Paper in hand, and writ to her as follows.

Most dear heart,
WHat should cause his strangeness in you thus on a sudden, is to me
altogether unknown, having to my knowledge given no just occasion; is love so
light thus to be quite blown away and no reason to be given therefore; or can
you so soon forget those solemn engagements past between us? were there a
^ailing on my part, I should soon expiate the offense though with my dearest
blood; be then so merciful a judge as not to condemn me before my cause be
known, and if you find me guilty, then let me suffer your severest censure; in
the mean time I shall desire to have the happiness as to plead my own cause
before your self, where I make no doubt but to be acquitted, and to prove my
self,

Your faithful servant Ralph.


This Letter he conveyed to her hands by the Maid of the house, whom she chid
for bringing it, yet nevertheless the opened and read it; but Williams
counterfeit Letter had so far possessed her with an evil opinion of him, that
what he had written gained no credence with her, but rather exasperated her
more then before, she judging it to be all but mere dissimulation, and
therefore to check his arrogance (as she imagined it) she took Pen in hand and
returned him this following Answer.

With what confidence or impudence rather, you could thus write unto me, I much
marvail: is this your course, to entrap Maids hearts by Dissimulation, and then
to insult over them for their pains I can you carry so fair a gloss upon so
foul a Text, or think ye I am so ignorant of your ways as you would have me to
be; is your large protestations come to conclude in perjuries; and was the end
of your oaths only to deceive; false man, had thou none to abuse but me, and
must you needs boast of your victory before you had fully obtained it? blame me
not then if I turn haggard, and resufe to come again to your lure: in the mean
time, go court some other Lasses, whose credu^ity you may abuse by
Dissimulation as you have done mine, and let not impudence prevail so far
further with you as to trouble me again with another Letter, for know I hate
the very memory of thee, much less shall I abide either to see or hear from
thee,

Your deserved enemy Arabella.


By the same hand which brought her the Letter, did she return him the answer,
which h^w welcome it was to Ralph, let them imagine who having been in Love,
have met with the like misunderstandings in their affections, guessing at many
things which might cause this sudden alteration, but still being ignorant of
the true cause, and now as one utterly desperate of real mission into her
labor, he resolves to abandon utterly all thoughts of Love, and betake himself
to the camp of Mars; in prosecution of which purpose, some further aids being
sending over into France, to valiant King Edward (whose martial actions began
now to be spoken off the whole world over) he lifts himself a Soldier amongst
them, but before his departure he sent this Copy of Verses to his incensed
Arabella.

Farewell thou unkind dearest, whom my eyes
Did once; more then the worlds chief treasure prize,
Whose beauty, and whose constancy were deemed
More then all other women were esteemed,
How comes it that thou so unkind should prove
To him whom once thou promidst for to love,
Who thought such falsehood ere in thee to find,
Or is all faith now fled from women kind;
Then fare thou well, all happiness attend thee;
And may the Gods a truer Lover send thee.

Having sent her these Verses, and the wind standing fair, he took Ship, and
being aided both (...) Neptune and Eolus, they in short time arrived in France.
It has then about the time of the Year when the Lady Flora had man^led the
earth in a rich suit of Tap^^^y, and the winged Chor^sters of the Wood did
chant (...) Harmony. Now the sons of Mars, lay (...) in the (...) and several
(...) had passed betwixt both Armies; wherein the French most commonly had the
worst; wherefore considering with themselves the danger they were in, how their
armies every day decreased, their Towns continually taken by the English, and
King Edwards side growing stronger and stronger; they therefore assembled a
mighty Army to oppose him, and therewith confronted him near to a place called
Cressy: having in their Company a Champion of an extraordinary strength, and
very much renowned for sev^^al achievements he had done; This Champion (whom
the French called Lilio) at such time as the Armies began to approach near to
one another, he sent a bold challenge to the English host, daring the best of
them all to encounter with him, which challenge being full of pride and
arrogance, was written as follows.

Imperious Englishmen, whose ambition has made you to cross the Seas into
this our renowned Kingdom of France, and to wage War with him who for his
valor and piety has the attribute of the most Christian King bestowed upon
him; think you because you have given us some petty defeats, and destroyed and
burnt some few inconsiderable Villages, that you shall be able to conquer the
Crown of France, or to bring under the Frenchmen whose valor the World has
always had in admiration; no, know that I am the man who will stand in the gap
to stop your proceedings, and thereupon do Challenge the boldest Champion in
your host to encounter with me in single Combat, which if he shall be so
foolhardy as to undertake, you shall soon perceive the difference betwixt the
manhood of the renowned French, and the pusilianity of Dastards, such as I
count the English to be.

A foe to Cowards, the renowned Lilio.


This proud Challenge being sent into the English camp, filled those Sons of
Mars with scorn and disdain of this Beagadocio; yet they were resolved to
answer his folly, and to make him know the great difference betwixt words and
deeds, and the noble resolution of an Englishman; before the vain boasting of
the French: But none was more eager to take up this bold Challenger then was
the renowned Hawkwood, whose notable valor had now advanced him to the degree
of a Captain, and therefore he humbly desired the King to permit him to
undertake the same, to which the King having has proof of his abilities,
graciously condescended, whereupon the noble Hawkwood returned him an answer in
these following lines.

Proud Frenchman who think with high words to work wonders, and art so bold
to vilify that Nation (...) have always been your betters at the exercise of
arms; But find thy inconsiderate rashness will needs prompt thee to thy
destruction, know that thy challenge shall be answered, when if thou can
perform what thy paper has promised, thou will have more cause to brag, but ^f
thou be overcome by my arm (as I make no doubt but thou will) thou may
then repent of thy folly, and be an example to others to brag less, without
they could perform more

John Hawkwood.


The next day as it was agreed betwixt them, both the Champions met, in a void
place between both the armies, when first on horseback, and then on foot, they
fought with much conrage and manhood, but gallant Hawkwood in little space did
make the Frenchman sensible of his error, and by his excellent valor set the
palm of victory on his own head, for he soon brought the Frenchman low
notwithstanding his high brags, so that to save his life, upon his knees he
presented his sword to the conquering Hawkwood and submitted himself to be his
Prisoner. This sub mission was by the generous Hawkwood accepted, who returned
with him in triumph to the English camp, where he was received with great
acclamations of j^y; The King for his valor conserred on him the order of
Knighthood, and the prime commanders show (...) him much respect, feasti^^
him, and highly extolling his manhood. The Frenchmen on the other side when
they saw their Champion ^verthrown were much dis^eartned, and dreading the
worst, in the night for^ook their Camp, and s^ed away for* fear of the English.

About the time that this combat was fought, Ralph the Journerman with some
other English aids was newly arrived at King Edwards Canty, who seeing the
valor of his fellow servants, and how the whole host rang of his praises, was
exceeding joyful thereof, (being utterly ignorant that Sir John was his rival
in Love,) and minding to reveal himself unto him, he at last found a fit
opportunity, being sree from Company and separated from business, whom he
accosted in these words.

Sir I very much applaud your valor, and thank the destinies that so guided
your hand, as to overthrow the French-mans pride, indeed I much longed to see
you, but to see you a Conqueror, and that in such a high nature, it does indeed
almost ravish me with joy: So it is that being crossed in my affections with the
fair but false Arabella, whole beauty is but a varnish to her deceitful heart,
and her tyrannical sq^eamishness enough to make me hate all women kind, being
as I say thus crossed by Cupid, I thought to find Mars more favorable, and
France being now the stage of action, I resolved to put my felf an actor
thereon, where it has been my good hap even upon my very first joining to
those Sons of Bellona, to see and hear your honored achievements. Daigne
therefore renowned Hawkwood to entertain your once fellow servant Ralph, and
though not in the degree of a friend, yet into the condition of a servant, whom
you shall find obsequious to you, and not unworthy the trust you shall repose
in me.

Sir John Hawkwood, who at the first beheld Ralph with some regret, as knowing
him the main obstacle he had in the fair Arabella's love, finding by his
discourse she had likewise cast him off, and considering with himself, the
deceitfulness of that sex, how their love is like to breath on st^^, soon on
and soon off, although at first he intended to take no notice of him, but for
his loves sake to have rejected h^s acquaintance, yet hearing now how the case
went, he quite altered his mind, welcoming him with the highest expressions of
Love possible, and after some further short communication, had him to his Tent;
where he gave him friendly entertainment, and not long after made him a Serjant
under his Command, where for a while we will leave them, to rela^e in the mean
time what passed betwixt William and the fair Arabella.

CHAP. III.
How William courted the fair Arabella, how his counterfeit Letter came to be
discovered, and how she likewise cast him off.
Whilst these things passed in France; William who judged now all fair
weather, and that all lets were removed which might be any hinderance to the
prosecution of his designs, being as deeply scorched with the flames of Cupid,
as the other two had been who were now in France, be resolves without delay to
let fair Arabella know the same, which was the easier to be done, he being now
upon the absence of the other two, the foreman of the shop, and by his valls
which he had gotten having accoutred himself something more then an ordinary
Prent^ce, having also an accurate wit, and volubile tongue, all incentives to
Love, and which indeed drew the heart of Arabella upon the absence of Ralph, to
have a very good opinion of him, that opinion causing liking; and liking
quickly producing affection, so that she was not any ways nice to keep him
company, nor did she show such averssness in carriage but what did promise him
great hopes of obtaining her Love, wherefore emboldned thereby, one day as they
were al^ne be brake his mind to her in these words.

My dearest Arabella, if what I shall now utter should be offensive unto thee
yet let me beg thy pardon, since conquering Love inforces me to it; who can
view thy beauty and not admire thee? or who contemplate thy virtues and not
honor thee; or hear thy discourse, and not be enamoured of thee? how then
should I be able to resist such potent charms? What strength can I have against
such strong alurements to love^ he! Daign then dear Mistress of my heart, to
entertain this un^eigned Love of mine, and let not cruelty reign in that body,
wh^re beauty and virtue do sit inthroned. O torture me not with a flat denial,
neither tantalize me with vain delusions, but grant me the sree enjoyment of
thy heart, which in equity thou ought to do, although it be only in exchange
of mine which thou art possessed of.

Arabella wi^h much patience heard him all this while but least she should seem
t^o forward, she would at least appear so froward as to tell him that for her
part she had utte^ly abandoned all thoughts of Love ^ut of her breast, and
having now broken Cupids bonds, she desired not to come under his (...) aga^n^
She therefore wished him to desist from his amoro^s humor, or if he were minded
to persist, to place his affection ^ns^me more deserving person then her self.

William who though but a Novice in Love, yet perceived by her answer that it
was so far from tending to a flat denial, as it gave him more hopes to
prosecute his suit; for he was not so ignorant in the art of Love, but that he
knew, a woman's tongue and heart were not relatives, and that they would seem to
push away that with their little finger, which they would willingly pull back
again with both their hands he therefore prosecuted again his suit in these
words.

Let not my dearest Arabella say so, and condemn love for one man's miscarriage
what should the Mariner refuse ever to venture again, for being once
ship-wrack'd! or should the wrastler forswear that exercise because he once
received a fall; think not dear Love all men are wavering, nor let not one man's
unfaithfulness condemn the whole sex^ it is true, we read that Demophoon was
false, but Theagines was constant, Aeneus was disloyal, but Pyramus true to
death: Set therefore the ones faith against the others faults, and let the
virtues of the one balance the vices of the other; though Ralph was
unconstant, William will prove faithful, though all men should prove false, yet
would I continue true.

Arabella though she judged her self deceived before in Ralph, yet was by these
words brought into such a confidence of Williams integrity, that she had almost
yielded up the Fort, and revealed the affection she bare unto him; but upon
better consideration, she resolved to make a further trial of his loyalty, and
by a moderate delay have a sure proof of his constancy, she therefore returned
him a dubious answer, which as it gave him no great denial, so did it not any
ways assure him of her affection. For William (said she) you men are so apt to
change, and so given to unconstancy, notwithstanding all your protestations,
that we Maids are many times beguiled by your willy snares, and whereas men
accuse our Sex of fickleness, the fault is in them, for we only change our
loves as men change their conditions; and are constant to them so long as they
are true to themselves, yet am not I so out of Love with Cupid, but that I
could willingly come under his subjection, could I meet with a lover as true in
deeds as kind in words, and therefore till I have had a further proof of your
constancy, give me leave to wave any further conclusion,

With this Answer was William very well satisfied, hugging himself in his
supposed happiness, that others should beat the bush, and he catch she bird,
not doubting in the least the obtaining of Arabella's l^ve and now his heart
being merry, and taking care sor nothing, as he was one day at work, he began
to sing a song in praise of his Trade as follows.

Of all the Trades that ere has bin,
The Tailors does most credit win,
For let them all say what they can
The Tailor is the only man.
Adam was the first o'th Trade
When he his clothes of Fig Leaves made;
His skill in Trade then first appearing
To make clothes for his and Eves wearing.
Your Gallant that so brave does show,
It is the Tailor makes him so,
For when his clothes are off, he then
Does show like unto other men.
The Tailor has the only slight,
To make a crooked body straight,
With bumbast he their faults can cover,
One shoulder shows as high as the other.
A Tailor is without all danger
Admitted to a Ladies Chamber,
Where though she be never so chaste
He will take measure of her wast.
How should we but for Tailors do
When Northern winds so cold do blow,
Had we no clothes to keep us warm
Those bitter blasts would do us harm.
Without them all things put together
We never should endure the weather;
Then let them all say what they can,
The Tailor is the only man.
In this manner did William pass away the time in much jolli^y, having often
secret conferrance with his dearest Arabella, so that now at last they began to
draw toward some conclusion of agreement, and to think upon a prefixed time
for the marriage day; when on a sudden all was broken off again, and this
serenity of Air turned to cloudy and blustering weather, and that upon occasion
as follows.

There was living in the same house a Maidservant named Dorothy, who had a
long time been in love with William, but through a Maidenly bashfulness had
concealed the same. It chanced one time that she being in the next room where
William and Arabella had a conferrence, she over heard their private discourse,
and notwithstanding she might perceive by their talk that the business was near
unto a conclusion, yet out of a womanish revenge, she resolved if she could not
have him her self, to hinder any other from the enjoyment of him. She goes
therefore first and acquaints her Master and Mistress with each particular
circumstance, aggravating the matter, and wresting each word had been spoken to
the worst sense, but this not prevalling, both Master and Mistress having a
good opinion of William, and thinking their daughter might be worse bestowed.
She went another way to work, for having by some means got an ink^ing how Ralph
wa^ served by the counte^feit Letter, she well hoped that would do the feat,
and therefore the next opportuntty that she sound Arabella alone, she set her
wits on the tenter-hooks to aggravate the offense, which she did after this
manner.

I cannot but wonder Mrs. Arabella, nay pity your hard fortune, that you
should be thus deluded in the placing of your affection, well did the Poets
feign that Love is blind, not descerning desert from dissimulation, or truth
from treachery, is it possib^e that you could reject a Dove-like innocency, and
receive a Snake into your bosom: That you could cast off Ralphs unfeigned
affection to embrace Wi^liams dissembling carriage! O Gods how blind are we in
our choice, how apt to believe falsities for veritnes how dull not to disceri
truth from dissimulation; now to rectify your error, I c^uld inform you of
your mistake but why should I counsel them that are obstinate, or speak to them
that I know will not hear, and yet how can I that love your welfare refrain to
speak? or why should I be silent in a matter of so great moment, and yet sure
better to do so then otherwise, since Council rejected is but cast away, and to
speak to the deaf, is but lost labor.

These words she used, well hoping they would make Arabella the more
inquisitive to know, and indeed she mist not of her mark, sor the more the one
seemed loath to tell, the more eager was the other to be informed, so that at
last as it were enforced, (yet pretending it only a real affection unto her,)
she declared how Ralph was utterly ignorant of that Letter which came to her
hands, how it was of Williams contriving, only on purpose to beat her off of
his love, highly ertolling Ralphs deservings, and as much extenuating Williams
due desert; This news much astonished the fair Arabella. And is it possible said
she, that treachery can lie hid under such a vail of modesty; can so fair a
tongue have so foul a heart, or such sugared words serve only to candy over
worser actions? O ye Gods why did ye create so false a thing as man, or not
indue him with more reality, unhappy Arabella what unlucky Star governed at thy
Nativity, or what ominous signs foreboded thy misfortunes; was I appointed to
be fortunes May game, or destined for an example to others to beware of men's
treachery; and yet why do I thus suddenly break forth into this exclamation,
may not he be wrongfully accused, and I more too blame for being so over
credulous, and therefore my dearest Dorothy I conjure thee to be silent in what
thou have told me^ till time the father of truth shall make all things appear,
in the mean space I shall not be idle to use my best endeavors in the
prosecution thereof.

And now she began to look on William with a squint eye, her smiles were turned
to frowns, discontent sat on her forehead, and all private intercourse laid
aside betwixt them. In the mean time Fames Golden Trumpet had loudly sounded
forth the heroic actions of Sir John Hawkwood and Ralph the Journey-man, none
in the English Camp more daring then they, having performed many gallant
adventures, insomuch that fortune seemed chained to their swords. This artiving
at the ears of Dorothy (as going often to the Market where news was stirring)
she presently acquaints Arabella therewith, setting forth thi^r praises
(especially Ralphs) in so high a language, and quaint demonstrations, as if she
her self had been an eye witness, here would she describe a battle, the great
strength of the enemy, the disadvantage of the place for the English, how
fortune a long time favored the French, and how at last the scales were
turned, and victory plucked out of her hands as it were by mere force, and all
by the valor of these two renowned Champions, then would she show the honor
attendant on victory, with what respects they were entertained wheresoever they
came, how they carried the Goddess victory in triumph along with them, the
whole Camp sounding forth their praises. This news as it tickled the ears of
Arabella with delight, so did it cause in her a sudden coffeehouse for the
loss of such two servants who had both of them expressed such love unto her, so
that she began again afresh to renew her complaints, and to exclaim on fortune,
when suddenly she was called to the door, a Messenger waiting for her there
with a Letter, which when she had received, and knowing by the Character it was
Ralphs hand, a modest blush died her cheeks into a vermilion color, but having
broke open the Seal, she found it to contain these words.

To that Paragon of beauty the renowned Arabella.
With what regret I have passed away the time since I have been absent from
ye, as it is unknown unto you, so am I as utterly ignorant what should move you
to such averseness; for was it possible such deep promises, and solemn
engagements, could be so suddenly broken off, without showing a reason why;
certainly that Love had but a weak foundation, which should cause the whole
structure so on an instant to fall; well may your Sex be accused of Levity if
without any occasion you can so suddenly change; more fickle then the
Weathercock, which yet turns but according to the Wind, pray pardon the
expression, since a sharp ^eproof is more wholesome then a flattering
complement, and these times have more need of the Satyr then the Sonnet. If the
remembrance of me be not quite banished out of your memory, I should think it a
happiness to hear from you; but if your affections have taken up another
habitation, and all those mutual engagements betwixt us be utterly forgotten,
yet this shall be my comfort that the breach was not on my part, but that I can
with confidence subscribe my self

Your faithful friend Ralph
.

Having read the Letter and thoroughly considered each circumstance thereof,
she then began to be ^^lly confident that Dorothy had told her nothing but
truth, so (...) the fi^e of revenge lay burning in her breast against William,
yet did she for a while wisely cover it under the a^hes of Dissimulation, until
finding a fit opportunity, and that the heat of pa^sion was over, she then
uttered her mind to ^im in these words.

Treacherous man; thus to betray thy friend, and abuse me, with what confidence
can thou appear before me being conscious of thy own guilt; art thou not
afraid the divine vengeance should pursue thee, as once the Harpies did P^neus
the Arcadian King! Thou that can counterf^it Love as well as le^ters, and
mast commence Doctor in the art of Dissimulation; whose word* and deeds like
Janus face look two several ways, having the Theory of honesty, but can not
abide the practick part, being like to the Apples of ^odem, which Historians
say, are beautiful without, but dirt within, art not thou he whose pretensions
to honesty were so large, as if thou would ingross the whole Commodity to thy
self; now out of that abundance where withal you are endued, pray tell me what
point of honesty is that, by counterfeiting Letters to set the dearest friends
at variance, to dissolve that band of friendship, which had been tied together
by so many solemn promises and engagements, away then false man, whose
treachery has made thee justly odious, and think with thy self if thy unworthy
actions has not made thee justly to deserve the hatred of all womenkind.

William would have replied something in excuse of himself and extenuating his
crime, but Arabella would not suffer him to speak; False man (said she) and
can thou be so impudent, as to deny so apparent a truth, have not thou more
cause to blush and be ashamed at these thy perfidious actions, with what
confidence can thou look upon the Sun, who is a witness to thy falsities, or
how dare thou behold the light, for discovering thy impieties; What hopes is
there that he will be true to me, who has deceived another; or what trust is
there to be reposed in him who has been once found treacherous; is not a noted
Liar justly suspected when he speaks an unlikely truth; and do not we commonly
condemn them of theft, who have been once guilty of stealing; how then can I
think thou will be true to me, who have been false to thy friend, or imagine
thou will deceive no more, when thou have deceived already. O no, may I never
be pitied for my misfortune, if I will not beware having so fair a warning,
hence forward therefore; expect no more from me then the courtesy of an enemy,
since by thy treacherous actions, I have forgone so worthy a friend.

Having ^tter'd these speeches away she went in a fustian fume, leaving William
much perplexed at her words; for his Prenticeship now drawing toward a
conclusion, he intended as soon as it was out to have married and set up for
himself, but this unexpected answer of Arabella, quite altered the scene of his
whole affairs, so that he was now a new to seek what course to take* much did
he wonder how she came to know of the Letter, imagining many, but never
mistrusting the right party that told her, for Dorothy though she had raized
this storm behind his back, let still carried calm weather in her face toward
him, hoping if he was once quite off with Arabella, he would be induced to come
on with her; but though she effected the one with ease, the other was hard to
compass, for William by this answer of Arabella, was grown quite out of Love
with all women-kind, insomuch that in detestation of the Sex, as he was at work
one day, he breathed out this song against them.

Who hopes to find a woman kind
is like to loose his labor,
`Tis like to bagging up the wind
or playing on a Taber,
The one small profit comes thereby
The other yields less melody,
In either there is no saver.
Why should I then repine, or once
sigh, cause my Love does leave me,
Since she was born for the very nonce
on purpose to deceive me,
A woman flatters if she smiles,
If weeps; her tears are Crocodiles,
Which ten times worse will grieve thee.
CHAP. IIII.
Dorothy seeks to gain Williams Love, how Ralph and Arabella were reconciled
and a Marriage concluded betwixt William and Dorothy.
DOrothy having had knowledge how the match was broken off betwixt William and
Arabella, she began to set her wi^a on work how to draw his affection unto her,
loath she was to discover her love to him in plain terms, yet willing she was
he should know she loved him; many haits she used, and several Engines she set
on work for that purpose, but all would not do, William either knew not, or at
least would not seem to know her meaning; (...) notwithstanding these Remora's,
she would not give over her Projects so, but resolved to hait her hook with
several ingredients, hoping at last the fish would ^ite, her next device
therefore was to reveal the same to him by a third person, to this purpose she
acquainted a trusty friend of hers with the Project, giving him instructions
how to proceed therein, who in a little space found a fit opportunity to speak
unto William thereof, but so covertly, and in such fit words, that the device
was not in the least perceived, for having galned from William by his discourse
that when his time was out he intended to go from his Master, he then persuaded
him to take upon him a Marriage life, extolling it highly, and setting forth
all the privileges that a Married man injoys above a single person; and having
as he thought wrought him into a good opinion of that kind of life, he then
commended Dorothy to him as a fit person to make a wife on, highly commending
and extolling her rare perfections both of body and mind, but Williams thoughts
were fixed upon another object, and though he gave him the hearing, yet minded
not to follow his counsel however he thanked him for his advice, but told him
Marriage was a matter of so high a concernment as required some deliberation,
that for his part he intended to do nothing rashly, since hasty Marriages were
most commonly soon repented of, yet he would take time to consider thereof, and
therefore for the present desired him to make no further discourse of it.

In the mean time Sir John Hawkwoods name grew famous in France, for like a
true Hawk he seldom mist of his prey, nor did the Tailors sheirs clip the wings
of his fame, but by his valor he made his Trade renowned, so that the most
noble persons in the Army desired his acquaintance, for by his ingenuity he
attained to such perfeaion in Arms, that his rules were held for Maxims in the
art military. The King also to honor him the more gave him a Coat of Arms
significant to his name, which was a Hawk flying in a Wood, with a Lion and
Griffen for the supporters. Ralph also was for his deferts raized from a
Serjant to be a Leiutenant, who by his courteous and deboneyre carriage
purchased to himself the love of the Soldiers, and other inferior officers.

But the fair Arabella was much perplexed with the thoughts of the wrong she
had done unto Ralph, so that the grief thereof brought her into a sickness, and
that so deadly, that notwithstanding all means used for her recovery, her
Parents began to despair of her life; for the Doctors were ignorant in her
disease, and therefore the less able to prescribe her a Remedy, and though she
were often urged by her friends if Love were not the cause of her distemper,
yet would she confess nothing, but kept all to her self, and to blind them from
knowing the Original of her malady, she imputed it to an excessive cold, she
had gotten by walking late in the fields, and now her sickness ^^creasing, she
endeavored all she could to put the remembrance of Ralph out of her mind, but
the more she endeavored it, the more did it come into her memory, and now that
Love which a while ago, was in a manner quite quenched, begun to burn more then
ever before; no rest could she take, it being now a stranger unto her, her
chief companion was sorrow and trouble. In this languishing condition she
resolved to send a Letter to Ralph, to ease her heart, and to clear the
misunderstanding that had betwixt them, which Letter contained these words.

To her faithful friend Ralph.
IF a fair acknowledgement may serve the turn for the wrong I have done ye,
here you have it under my hand, I shall not say much in my own excuse it was my
too much credulity; that was my fault; a counterfeit Letter written by William
under your name was the cause, his obtaining of my Love was the design, but
upon the discovery; my just hatred toward him proves to be the effect. Thus
have you in short the cause of our breach, if a fair reconcilement may succeed
this acknowledgement, I shall willingly embrace it, and as I was the first that
committed the fault so am I the first that offer reconcilement,

Your discousolate friend Arabella.


This Letter she sent away with all the speed she could, which when Ralph had
received, and (...) over he much marvalled at the strange carriage of things,
highly resenting Williams fraud, and not altogether excusing Arabella's
credulity; for though if it had been true, he had been deservedly rejected, yet
to cast him off upon the first surmizal without further proof, he thought was
hard meal use however he imputed it only so her circumspection, wherein we
cannot be too careful, when the beargain extends to the length of our lives,
and therefore he res^^ed to send her a comfortable answer, which would be a
better Cordial to^then the best Physician of them all could prescribe. His
answer wa^^ ntaired in these word.

My dearest Araballa.
WOnder not if in reading over your Letter I was stricken into astonishm ents
for who could have imagined such falsehood could have been found in William,
what faith can be given to foes, if friends prove thus false; or what
confidence can we repose in strangers, i^ household acquaintance thus
degenerate; and yet take it not (...) (my dearest Arabella) if I blame you for
light belief, did you thank I would falsify that faith I had so solemnly
engaged unto you or did you imagine the sight of another face would make me
alter my affection: No, far be such thoughts from taking up their lodging in my
breast, and may I for ever be estranged from giving harbor to such thoughts;
since then thou have proffered reconciliation (although there was never no
breach on my side,) I willingly embrace in and as it is said of broken bones
that being once knit again together, they grow the stronger, so I hope our
friendship by this breach; will be the more strongly cemented and durable
hereafter, and that it may be true of us what the Poet once sung Amantium is a
amoris, redente gratia est.

Yours constant till death Ralh.


Having sealed it up and ready to send away; he often kissed it instead of the
party it was directed unto; ah blessed paper (said he) which shall kiss the
hands of her that commands the very all of my (...); how do I envy thy
happiness which shall be admitted whether my present occasions will not permit
me to come, how will whiteness appear to be sullied, when it comes to be near
her more whiter hands? Now if thou attainest to that honor, that after thy
reading thou breast admitted unto her bosom, being so near her heart, inform it
how true and faithful I have been unto it, what sorrows I have endured since it
was estranged from me, and how happy I count my self in its return unto me; so
fare thou well dear paper, and may thou be the messenger of as much comfort
unto her, as heart can wish, or tongue express.

Arabella having received this Letter and read it over was greatly satisfied
therewith, so that now her thoughts being free from those perturbations which
lately afflicted them, her body began also to participate with her thoughts,
and to recover that loveliness which before it had lost, she that but now so
veid of strength as unable to stir a foot, could now walk about the house
without any supporter, fresh Roses budded in her cheeks, which before were pale
and wan, and beauty which e're while lay a dying began now in appear in its
fullest luster, mirth which had been a long time a stanger unto her, began now
to be her familiar, and all things tended to a perfect recovery, such a strong
influence has Love over our (...), that it can kill and cure, according as
affectors lead us.

And now the time of William apprenticeship was out, when perceiving no hopes
of regaining Arabel as affect^^^ he likewise resolved to go over into France,
tottry his cha^^^ is (...) Lottery. This his resolution being make known (...),
D'orothy, (...) much perplexed her, fearing that after all the pai^^ (...) to
win him, the should now loose him at the long run; but being of an
Indefatigable spirit, and not daunted at any disaster, she took up a resolution
to impart her mind unto him her self, and either dissuade him from his intended
journey, or draw him to a better opinion of her Love; to this purpose, the next
Holy Day she invited him to an Ant of hers, who lived at Isling^on, and sold
Cakes and Ale, William very kindly accepted of her pro^^er, and went along with
her, where he was very merry, and drank freely, and now being something
elevated, and that the liq^^r began to operate in his Crown, he (according to
the custom (...)) began to throw out some jesting words of Love to Dorothy
(...) is manner.

In faith Mistress Dorothy I much marvail that so rare a beauty, and such
excellent gifts of mind, should continue so long without a husband, but you
Maids are endued with such self-denying principles, that you will seem froward
although men be never so forward; and yet let me advise ye not to be so coy,
for beauty is but a fading flower and the time of our youth soon posteth away,
and if you defer till such time as the mark be out of your mouth, in troth for
ought I know, you may go along with the rest of the company, to that ridiculous
employment of leading Apes in Hell.

Dorothy seeling him in this merry humor thought it was good striking whilst
the Iron was hot, wherefore she embraced the present opportunity, and thus
replied.

Then I hope William you that are so wise in counselling others, will not be
unmindful of your self, but take time by the fore-top, before age steals upon
you undiscerned and yet methinks if your mind were so bent, you might have
English beauties enough whereon to fix your affection, that should not need to
ramble into France, but you perhaps will say, it is not Venus but Mars invites
you thither, and that you de light more in arms then in amors; that a
Soldiers life merits praise, and that honor is the reward of Valor; suppose
this were true, but how many dangers must you run through before you attain to
what you propose; how few be there that attain it, how many thousands are their
that perish in the pursuit of it? and besides are not the private Soldiers
them that endure the heat of the battle, and yet, do not the Commanders carry
the honor of the day; I omit here the dangers of the Sea in your passage over,
the indispostion of your body by reason of a different climate, the tediousness
of sickness when absent from friends, with a thousand other things which I
might allege, every one of them of sufficient weight to alter your mind from
your intended journey, but suppose you could overcome all these difficulties,
and escape all the dangers I have here spoken off, yet what is your aim in all
this, but that having run through so many hazards, you would then desire to live
in peace, and that the Sun of your Life should set in a calm evening, and why
may not you as well live in peace now, without exposing your self to all those
hazards, when (as I said before) not one in a thousand that does attain to his
proposed ends, for though death be not far off from any one of us, yet is he
always (...) Soldiers (...); my counsel therefore to you is, to settle your
thoughts and affections here in England; for a trundling stone never gather
moss, and a rambling mind is never in quiet.

But said William, it is travail that accomplishes a Man, makes him fit for
discourse, and gains him experience in the affairs of the world. O how dull and
rustical are they who never went further then the smoke of their own Chimneys,
fit only to discourse of the Plough and the Flail; Then for a Soldiers life,
what greater honor then to fight in defense of his King and Country! and for
the perils you speak of; that are incident to the Wars, the Poet gives you a
sufficient Answer.

What danger comes to him whom walls of Iron
Both back and breast, and also head enviorn.
For the dangers of the Sea; indeed they are many, and yet who can promise
themselves security on Land; nay, does not Death triumph far more on Land then
at Sea, although the Sea be more spacious then the Land, and if a man be
destinied to be drowned, what matter is it, when he is dead, whether he become
food for fishes, or a feast for the Worms. Then for the inconveniency of being
in a strange Country, to a wise man every Land is his own home; and should
sickness surprise us, no Nation so barbarous as to wrong those who are not able
to right themselves, when many times at home we suffer that by the neglect of
our kindred, which a stranger out of a Christian compassion will not suffer to
be offered unto us. But the main business you drive (...), is (I suppose) that
by marrying, and settling my self to my vocation, I might enjoy the pleasures of
the world, live at home in quiet, and content my self with only hearing what
others do; indeed Marriage is an honorable late, and if a men meet not with
the honester wife, a hornable state likewise, since then (...) wives are thick
sown and thin come* up, I mean to fetch a ramble, to see if such creatures live
in other Countries.

In Troth William (quoth Dorothy) perhaps there you may be fitted, and have one
as dear bought as far fetched, which though proverbially it be good for Ladies,,
yet I think by consequence you may speed better nearer home, for going so far,
though your ware be light, yet for ought I know it may prove dear of the
carriage. And why so addicted to the mode of France; are our English beauties
so contemptible; or are they not rather the glory of their Sex; for why else is
it so commonly spoken that to the making up of a complete woman, there is
required the parts of a Dutch-woman from the girdle downwards, the parts of a
French-woman from the girdle to the shoulders, over which must be placed an
English face to the perfecting of all the rest: And therefore William if your
mind be more addicted to the tail then to the top, I should rather advise you
to go unto Holland then France, where (if the saying be true) the women are
most complete, and if you fear to venture on marriage state for fear of
ho^ning, of all women have a care of the French, who (they say) are as full of
fire, as the Dutch-women are of Ice.

By this time the Sun began to draw toward his Western home, so that Dorothy
^earing she should let the slip without speaking any thing to the purpose, she
therefore began to draw nearer to him, and with a well composed countenance
spoke as follows.

But suppose William you could light of a Maid to your mind, one whose features
and fortunes would be equivalent to you, could you be so cynial as to refuse
such a match? is not a wife a second self, a bosom friend, a rich Cabinet
wherein a man may lock up his secrets; a partner with him in all sorrows and
ears, a true friend in time of need, a yoak-fellow to draw with him through the
cumbersome cares and perplexities of this World? I might enlarge my self very
much on this matter but the thing is so apparent as witheut all contradiction,
unless it be by such women-haters as that Cynical Philosopher Diogenes, who
being asked when it was best time to marry, replied, for young men it is too
soon, and for old men it is too late, inferring thereby it was not good to
marry at all* but this we must take as spoken by Diogenes, who had not the
(...) of Dog given him for naught, for should all be of his mind the World
would be a desert within these hundred years. And therefore William let ^e
advise ye, as one that loves ye well, to give over this project of travailing,
which can be no ways advantageous unto you, and to think upon some person of
whom to make a wife, for certainly no Maid* if at least she be of my mind,)
that will refuse to join with you in marriage.

These words were spoken home to the purpose, so that William could not choose
but take notice of her meaning; and therefore now his hand was in, and that the
fair Arabella was quite cut of his mind. he suddenly replied, then in troth
Mrs. Dorothy I shall take you at your word, and since it is said few words to a
bargain are best we will make no long circumstance about the matter, for you
are she I shall pitch upon to be my Bride. Dorothy by her silence gave consent,
and so with a kiss they clapped up the bargain. But the next morning after
William had slept, and thoroughly considered of what he had done, he begun to
repent himself that he had been so hasty, and though he meant to perform his
promise, yet he resolved first to go over into France: This his resolution he
imparted to Dorothy, who endeavored all she could to persuade him to she
contrary: but upon his promise that he would return in a short time, with deep
protestations of his fidelity unto her, she at last gave her consent, so having
provided all things ready, he took ship, and having a prosperous wind he in
short time arrived in France.

CHAP. V.
How Sly the Lawyer was deceived in his Bedfellow by the means of Dorothy.
THere was an old Country Lawyer named Sly that was near of kin to Dorothies
Master, who coming to London every Term, to save charges used to lie there,
this Lawyer was a stale ^atchelor, but very leacherous, and yet so penurious
that he was loath to be at the changes to maintain a wife, for he thought it
was more saving, not to keep a Cow of his own, so long as he could have a quart
of Milk for a penny. Now it was his chance to be at London soon after that
William was gone into France, and Dorothy using to tend on him in his Chamber,
the old Leather thought to draw her to his will; and having presented her with
some slight gifts, more gaudy then costly, he at last brake his mind unto her,
promising her Mountains if she would fulfill his desire, Dorothy at first gave
him very snappish answers, threatening to make his business known to her Master,
but the ^awrer still persisted in his suit, adding still more gifts to the
former, so that at the last as overcome she seemingly condescended unto him;
and promised the next Night when her Master and Mistress was in ^ed to come and
lie with him; The leach^rous Goat was overjoyed at these words hugging himself
in his supposed delight, and persuading himself that she meant unfeignedly. But
Dorothy against the appointed time, had provided him a bedfellow which proved
very litt^e to his content. There was a deformed lame woman which used to do
the drudgery belonging to the house, this Creature had Dorothy persuaded to act
her part, and gave her instructions how to manage it wisely, greatly charging
her not to speak to him for^ear of discovery, which she might well do under a
vail of modesty, and so having taught her her lesson at the time appointed she
conducted her so the Lawyers Chamber, who was gotten to bed with a longing
exp^cta^ion of Dorothies company; but now hearing the Chamber door open. and
the woman coming to his beds side, his heart was overjoyed, and putting his arm
out of the bed, claspt it about her neck, and gave her a kiss, saying. Now I
see Dorothy thou art as good as thy word, come prithee make have and pull off
thy cloth, for I have kept thy place warm against thy coming. The woman was
soon unready and went into the bed, but when the Lawyer began to embrace her,
he thought he smelt an ill favored favor, and therefore he said, prethy
Dorothy what have thou been doing off, thou smellest so strong of Kitchin-stuff
I am not able to endure, good sweetheart go to the window, where stands a
glass of Rose Water wherewith thou most make thy self sweeter. The woman
hereupon rose out of the bed, and went to the window, intending to make her
self all honey for the Lawyer, but instead of the Rose Water, she took up an
ink-glass, and pouring it into the palm of her hand, she rubbed therewith her
face, neck and breasts, wherewith she made her self so amiable, that had it
been in the light, she would have frighted the Lawyers leachery away, having
done this, she went to bed again, and though she were not much the sweeter, yet
the heat of lust made him bear with all ill-favored smells, now first against
the time they should rise, Dorothy went and called up her Master, Mistress and
Arabella, telling them the Lawyer lay a dying, and that he was just now giving
up the Ghost, whereupon half unready they ran to his Chamber with all the speed
they could; the Lawyer and his bedfellow were much frighted at this sudden
intrusion, but when he had drawn the Curtain, and saw what manner of Creature
he had lain with all night, he began to cry out, the Devil, the Devil;
Arabella, with her Father and Mother were as much frighted, thinking it had
been the Devil indeed but when they heard, the woman speak calling him old
leacherous Rogue, with all the Billingsgate terms she could reckon up, they
then perceived who it was; whereupon their great fear was turned into an
excessive laughter; Dorothy who had practiced all this mischief, was now most
busy in laughing at it, but the Lawyer was so ashamed, that getting up, he bid
them adien, and never after that time came to the house any more.

CHAP. VI.
William kindly entertained in France by Sr. John Hawkwood, Ralph challenges
him to fight, and upon discontent returns into England.
William having prosperously arrived in France, went the next way to the
English Camp, being conducted thither by the trumpet of Fame which loudly
sounded forth their Heroic praises; where he found Sr. John Hawkwood like the
Son of Bellona, intentive upon his Martial affairs, instructing his men in
their Military postures, and showing them both how to receive and avoid the
shock of the Enemy. But upon the coming of William he committed his charge to
the managing of Ensign, (for Ralph upon some necessary occasions was then
absent from his company) and kindly entertained his old companion, being as
familiar with him, as when they used to sit cross legged on the Shop-board
together; for he was free from that haughty pride which now adays possesses
some of our upstart Gallants, who being raised from a low, though but to an
ordinary fortune, forget not only their old acquaintance, but also themselves.

After some repast, William acquainted him with the passages betwixt himself
and Arabella, yet pretending that what he^^d, was only in revenge of the denial
she had given to Sir John, and not out of any hat^ed to Ralph, although (said
he) she cast him off: (for ^oth He and Sir John were still ignorant of their
reconcilements) and therefore (said he) I desire that Ralph should not know
thereof. But w^^^ies they were thus ^^ccursing, Ralph came in, who seeing
William, and remembering how by his means that from of discention had been
raised betwixt him and Arabella, the fire of revenge strait sparkled out of his
eyes and drawing his sword, false man said he, now shall thy life pay for thy
treachery, and there withal offered to strike at him, but Sir John-Hawkwood
interposed betwixt them, and laying hold on Ralph, commanded him to put up his
s^ord, or else (said he) you will force me to draw mine,; what is this your
valor to strike an unarmed man? or is this your greatest courtesy to welcome
an old campanion? Noble Captain said Ralph, if you knew the falsehood that was
lodged in that breast, you would think his life too small a recompense to
expiate his faults; but (said Sir Hohn) passion is no competent judge of men's
actions, and to build your knowledge upon heresay cannot be good, since
misreport has wronged many; defer your guar^el therefore till you are fuller
satisfied of the grounds of it, and if William has done you wrong, no doubt
but he will acknowledge it, and given you satisfaction.

Ralph herewith as half persuaded, but principally because he could not do
otherwise, in the presence of his Captain put up his sworn, res^rving his
r^venge tell another season, and so without speaking any more words he went his
way; Sir John Hawkwood perceiveing that Ralphs malice was implacable, persuaded
William to list himself under some other Captain, till such time as he had
gotten some experience, when he would not be wanting to use his best endeavor
to give him preferment; William according to his directions went and listed
himself under that renowned Champion Edward the black Prince, where in a short
space through his industry, and Sir John Hawkwoods good word, (who loved him
entirely) he attained to an Ensigned place. This vexed Ralph to see his Rival
advanced, for where envy is harbored in the breast of a man, he takes another
good to be his hurt, and now his only studdy was revenge, but wanting other
means to effect it, he sent him a challenge in these words.

If thy heart be as good to fight as it has been to invent mischief, then meet
me to morrow morning at thy own appointed place and weapon, where I shall
attend ye, to revenge those injuries and affronts offer^d unto me, and to the
fair Arabella, which if thou shall refuse to perform, I shall proclaim thee a
Coward, and not fit to bear Arms, or to usurp the name of a Soldier.

Ralph


William having received the challenge, was very much discontented, for though
he was of an invincible courage, not dreading any danger, yet being conscious
to himself of the injury he had offered to Ralph, he could willingly have
wished the challenge might have been waved; yet being loath to undergo the
aspertion of a Coward, he resolved what ever happened to undertake it, and
thereupon returned him this answer.

Lieutenant Ralph.
What passion moves you to these extreme I know not, but seeing you will needs
be so fool hardy as to venture a Duel upon it, your challenge shall be
answered, and since you have put it to me for the choice of the place and
weapon, I shall appoint the field on the North side of the Camp for the one,
and back-sword for the other; so till I see you farewell.

William.


The next morning accer^ing to appointment they met, with a full resolution the
sword should end all difference betwixt them; but Sir John Hawkword having some
inkling of the business, was in the field as soon as either of them, where
seeing them come fully resolved to fight, he spoke unto them in this manner.

What desperate folly, or madness rather, has thus bewitched you; as I am not
of your counsel, so I wish it had never come to my knowledge; If your stock of
valor be so surpassing great, bestow it upon the common enemy, and let it not
be employed to private disadvantage; there you may fight your belly full with
honor, whereas here he that gains the victory purchases only disgrace and
danger; what is your feud so deadly that nothing can wash it away but blood? or
is your malice so irreconcilable, that the breaches may not be made up again?
is life of so little worth to throw it away thus idly; and do you set so
slieght a price of your souls, as to hazard them thus for a thing of nothing?
what, is there no other remedy but that one of you must dye, and can death only
make expiation? I you can no better command your own passions then thus, you
will never be fit to command others.

Whiles Sir John Hawkwood talked thus to them, there was an alarm in the Camy,
for the French in a bravado appeared with a whole body of Horse, whereupon Sir
John Hawkwood commanded them to their several charges, which they obeyed, so
that the public danger, put off at that present this private Duel. The English
Commanders were soon ready to receive the French, who came on in a full
cariere, but being repelled at the first shock, they ran away with greater
speed then they came. The noble Hawkwood who dreaded no danger when his
presence was requisite, received some wounds in this skirmish, as indelible
characters of honor; both Ralph and William in their several stations performed
gallant service, so that malice which before was a poison, here prov`d a
cordial, when both parties in emulation strived who should ^o best against the
common Enemy. But the French seeing themselves thus beaten by the English,
desired a peace, offering to King Edward such propositions, as conduced both to
his Honor and profit, which after some small canvassing were accepted, and the
year ratified on both sides; so that now the Camp break up, and all that would
might depart home. But the Generous Hawkwood not loving to lie idle when any
action of Honor was to be performed on the worlds Theater, hearing that there
was wars in Italy, resolved to go thither, many gallant English men who
thi^^sted after honor, joining with him in his resolution, but none more
forward to go then William, whose vallant mind still thirsted after glories
prize? The noble Hawkwood who commanded in chief in this expedition, advancing
him to the degree of a Captain, which Ralph so stomached that he could by no
means be ^^^ced to join with them in that expedition; but taking his solemn
leave of Sir John Hawkwood and the rest of those valiant sons of Mars, he
returned (...) England, where he was received with great joy of his Master and
Mistres, but especially his most dearest Arabella, to whom in a short time
after he was solemnly married, to both their great contents and pleasure,

CHAP. VII.
The valiant Acts of Sir John Hawkwood in Italy and how he married with the
Daughter of Duke Barnaby.
THe renowned Merchant Tailor Sir John Hawkwood, having now completed his
army, consisting of sir thousand Horse and Foot, took his march toward Italy,
making great spoil all the way he went in the East hearts of the Kingdom of
France, his name carrying such a terror before it, as struck dead the hearts
of all opposers, coming into Italy he joined himself with the Marquess of
Mountferrat, under whom he ^ectormed such noble services, as equalled if not
exceeded that of the Ancient Romans, he having an exceeding ripe and quick
conceit, to force occasions, to frame his resolutions, and to make speedy
execution, being also as occasion required, both hot in his fights, and notable
for his delays, so that he soon grew to be the wonder and admiration of all
that Nation for martial Discipline.

Soon after Lionel Duke of Clarence, son to Edward the third King of England,
came into Italy to marry the Lady Violent^, Daughter to Galeasins Lord of
Millain, Sir John Hawkwood hearing thereof, resolved to make one in that royal
solemnity, and thereupon forsook the Marquess, and attended the Duke to his
marriage.

At which time Barnaby the brother of Galeasius had great wars with the State
of Mantua, who having heard of the noble acts of Sir John Hawkwood, humbly
desi^ed his assistance, for he being himself a warlike Prince, had a great
desire to make some trial of the discipline and prowess of the Englishmen. Sir
John accepted of his proffer, and in a short time gave such proofs of his
manhood and valor, as made Duke Barnaby highly to admire him, defeating his
Enemies in several skirmishes, so that those who before were almost Conquerers
now became humble suppliants, and them who ere while stood on high demand, now
come to as lowly terms.

Duke Barnaby having now found by experience, that Fame was sar short in the
praises of the noble Hawkwood, he grew into such a likeing of him, and that
likeing producing such love, that he greatly desired to have him his son in
law, and thereupon bestowed on him in marriage his daughter Domnia, a Lady of a
most transcendent beauty, and whose wit and eloquence ran parallel with her
beauty, one in whom he found such ^acts as he l^st in his Arabella, who could
not choose but beleved, being an lovely, one of such a rare fortune and
composition, that had the Trojan Paris seen her naked, he would have strighted
his Hallen of Greece for her.

This alliance bring made in respect of his valor in war, was the occasion of
the increase both of his pay, and of the renown of the Englishmen throughout
all Italy: that a most pulssant Prince in war^^, had not without sufficient
cause to induce him, conceived so good opinion of the valor of a man that was
a stranger; and for this cause his hel^ was desired by all the Princes and free
Cities of Italy. For at that time all marital affairs amongst the, Italians
were managed by foreign forces and Captains.

But Prince Barnaby growing ungrateful for those many benefits received by the
English men, the noble Hawkwood (notwithstanding their alliance) revolted from
him, and joined with their Enemies, giving thereby a shrewd turn of the scale
to the other side; taking by force the strong Towns of Fuera and Banacanalo,
with many other places of importance, all which he sold and disposed of at his
pleasure; William under him acting his part so well, that he was promoted from
a Captain of frot to a Colonel of Horse; and now new adventures pre^enting
themselves to their hands, they went to aid Pope Gregory, recovering for him
many Cities and places of importance, with were revolted from his obedience:
afterward he aided the Florentiques against the Pisans, doing such noble feats
of arme^, that the ver^ dread of his name was enough to make his Enemies ^un,
all Princes courtted his friendship he having as it were chained the Goddess
Victoria to his side wheresoever he came: those who loved not his person
maligned his perfections, for virtue is always attended on by envy, yet was he
of such an affable carriage that he wan both love and respect together: thus
seated on the top of Fortunes wheel^, we will leave him for a while to speak of
Williams Return into England, and how he was entertained by his dea^est Dorothy.

CHAP. VIII.
Williams return into England, his proof of Dorothies constancy and how they
were married together.
THe renowned William having thus in Italy by his extraordinary valor,
purchased to himself an honorable Character, being reputed (next to Sir John
Hawkwood) the most experienced Commander of that age. He having now been absent
from England the space of seven years, and remembering the promise he had made
unto Dorothy, which was to return in a little space; knowing how far he had
d^viated from that his promise, he therefore resolved with all exp^dition to
return into England, and there withal acquainted Sir John Hawkwood with his
determination; who was vary loath to part with his company, being a person of
an exquesite carriage and approved valor and therefore to dissuade him from
his purpose he used these expressions.

William you are now mounting on the Theater of Honor, and have already gained
an indifferent good blast in the Trumpet of Fame, but what should make you now
have off running, when you have almost attained to the Goal? what shall deter
you now from the pursuit of that which hitherto you have been so forward in?
what strange resolution has thus on a sudden allter'd your determination?
what are you resolved to throw off the Name of a Soldier, and to take up that
of a Lover; to abandon the Camp of Mars, and to follow the Court of Cupid: to
put off your steely Cors^, and to put on a silken Robe: and will you thus bury
your ^orme*, ^ur, to lie in a Ladies lap: who have the tears of ^reckadiles,
and the songs of Syren^ to enchant men from the pursuit of honorable
Achievements: remember your self then William, and stain not the reputation of
the noble society of Merchant Tailors, whose fame or deeds of Arms has
hitherto remained unblemished.

But no persw^sions (...) the resolutions of William, who thought every minute
(...) he had enjoye a si^ht of his beloved Dorothy, and the (...) of Sir John
Hawkwood, he emb^r^ (...) England, (...) banks he had not beheld in man (...)
by Neptune and Eolus, having a ^air wind and (...), he in short time arrived at
London, the happ^ Port (...) his ^^ishes were directed.

Being come on Land, he resolved not to discover himself at the first instant
to his beloved Dorothy, which he might well canceal, his commenance by the
length of time, end difference of Climate, being much altered, He therefore
went to a Tavern hand by, from whence he informed her by a messenger, that a
Gentleman from a friend of hers in Italy, would gladly speak with her. Dorothy
at the hearing of the news was much overjoyed, and promised the Messenger to be
with him presen^ly, which she accordingly performed, and entering the chamber
where he was, being almost persuaded, yet not fully confident it was her
dearest William, she began with kind words to bid him welcome home: but
William. with a counterfeit speech giving her to understand that she was
mistaken, spoke to her in this manner

I do not wonder (dear Mistres) that you are so mistaken, since many times
before the like has happened, even by those who knew us both very well, the most
percingest eye hardly discerning any difference betwixt us, either in height,
phisyogmony, couller of the hair or other outward part: long time were we
acquainted together, our intimacy producing strong affection betwixt us;
whether it were that likeness were the cause of Love, or what other motive
caused the same I cannot tell: but so it was that in weal or woe, prosperity or
adversity, nothing could separate us; many times would he discourse to me of
the love and affection passed betwixt ye, and of the solemn engagement he made
to you for his quick return, blaming himself for not performing his promise,
and resolving upon the first opportunity, when he had in some measure set his
affairs in order to return unto you, which no doubt he had performed, had not
Death by a cross accident cut him off in his determination, which happened in
this manner.

The Duke of Millaine had proclaimed a solemn Justs to be holden in the honor
of his birth day, to which resorted many Knights and gallant commanders of
great renown and valor, to exercise their skill in seats of Arms, in honor of
their Mistresses; at the time appointed none was more forward in those laudable
encounters then your true and faithful Lover William, whose turn being to Just
with an Italian Knight named Lopenzo, at the third encounter a splinter of the
Knights Lance chanced to run into Williams Helmet, and peirced his eyesight;
so that feeling himself mortally wounded, he desired to be carried to some
place near at hand, where he might in quiet breath his last, which friendly
courtesy I and some others performed for him; and now feeling the near approach
of death, because of the great love and familiarity betwixt us, and of the near
likeness of one person, he earnestly desired and persuaded me to think of no
otherwise but you, as the only maid in the world worthy to be beloved, for your
noble constancy and high deserts, which whosoever shall not love, shows
himself to be a hater of virtue; and therefore by that former affection betwixt
you, desiring, and by the Authority of love commanding you, that the love you
bore to him, you should turn to me; assuring you that nothing could please his
soul more then to see you and I matched together, wherefore according to his
desire Iam come (with faithful love built upon your deserts) to offer myself,
and to beseech you to take the offer.

Here he made a stop to hear what Dorothy would say, who first making most
hearty sighs, (doing such obsequies as she could to her supposed dead ^riend
William) thus answered him.

Sir for the great love you showed to my dear Friend, I give you many thanks,
but this great matter you propose unto me, wherein I am not so blind as not to
see what happiness it should be unto me in the enjoyment of so accomplished a
person: know Sir, if my heart were mine ^o give, you before all other should
have it, but Williams it is, though dead; their I begun, their lend all matter
of affection, I hope I shall not long tarry after him, with whose outward
person had I only been in love with I should be so with you, having the same
outward parts: but it was William self I loved, and love which no likeness can
make one, no commandment dissolve, nor no death fini^h. And shall I then (said
he) receive such disgrace as to be refused. Sir said she let not that word be
used, who know your worth far beyond my merits, but it is only happiness I
refuse, since of the only happiness I could or can desire, I am refused.

Scarce had she spoken out these words, when not willing to hold her in g^eifs
bonds any longer, but with his di^covery to convert her sorrowful moans to
smiling joy, he ran to her, and embracing her, why then my dearest Dorothy,
(said he) take and enjoy thy William, scarce could she at first believe him the
truth, such strong impressions had the former story taken in her heart, but at
last being thoroughly convinced, her joy so exceeded the bounds of reason that
she could not speak one word; but was constrained through her new conceived
pleasure to breath a sad sigh or two into her Lovers bosom, who as courteously
entertained her with loving kisses; where after these two Lovers had fully
discoursed to each other the secrets of their souls, how Dorothy for his love
had continued unmarried, notwithstanding the importunity of many and rich
suitors; as also William of the dangers he had run through in his long
pe^egrination, having refreshed their spiri^s with a glass of wine, they hand
in hand went to her Masters, but the news was no sooner spread about the Town
that William was come, but the Bells rung, and bonestres abounded, the
journy-men Tailors left all their seats to welcome him home, and the Promices
refused to work that day; Ralph notwithstanding the great feud formerly betwixt
them, with his beloved Arabella. came to give him a visit, all the whole talk
of the City being only of William and his deserved praises. His Master and
Mistres the next day made a great feast, to which was invited most of the
worshipful society of Merchant-Taylors, and other wealthy Citizens, and not
long after William and Dorothy were married, at whose wedding were most costly
shows and triumphs, all which I pass over, and return to speak of Sir John
Hawkwood, whole noble a^eheivements now calls my Pen to wake upon him.

CHAP. IX.
Amurath Prince of Fez seeks to get the Princess Mariana by treachery, they are
shipwrackt at Sea, Amurath is killed whereupon ensues war betwixt the Emperor
of Fez, and Ferdinando King of Cilicia.
THe noble and adventurous Merchant-Taylor Sir John Hawk-wood having by his
skill in arms and fortunate success (as you have heard) grown to such renown
that his name was famous throughout an Christendom, yet still thi^ sted after
glories prize, and to add to what he had already done; esteeming his past
victories which he had won in those parts of the world as nothing, unless he
also made his name redoubted by some famous exploit against the enemies of
Christ, and that he might bathe his sword in the Pagans blood, and long was it
not ere Fortune put a golden opportunity into his hands, to perform the same,
which thus happened.

In the famous Country of Cilicia, a place much beh^lding to Nature for the
extraordinary bounties she had bestowed upon it, there lived a King named
Ferdinando who was a Prince endowed with many noble and virtuous customs; that
had only one Daughter named Mariana, a Princess of a curious make, in whom
Nature and education strove who should add most to complete her the wonder of
that age, This her beauty and superexcellent endowments being blazed abroad,
invited many of the Neighboring Princes to sue for her in marriage, but none
more forward, nor deserved better then Arnaldo, Son to the King of Candy, so
that her Father Fardinando began to listen unto his suit, and knowing his
Daughters affections chiefly placed on him, glad that the had made so good a
choice, he so forwarded the same, that the day was appointed for the
celebration of the Nuptials, to the great content of the two young Princes, who
now hoped to enjoy the fruits of their love.

Great were the preparations made for this royal wedding, not only for variety
of cheer, but also for curious and costly Pageants, which were devised after
the ^arest manner, but all this great preparation came to (...), their (...)
was (...) to (...) their songs to sighs, and their mirth to m^uring, and h^^
^ppon (...) follows.

Amongst other (...) where F^m^ had blazed abroad the p^r^ections of Mariana
(...) Fez, whose only Son Amurath (a (...) of a vitioas (...) her a prize
worthy the looking after, and therefore (having obtained leave of his Father)
he provided a fleet of Ships, for the bringing her home to Fez, having in
conceit already obtained her good will, (...) if he falled, he resolved to make
up his Market by force; to the (...) resolution he arrives in Cilicia, haping
for the greatness of his b^th to be rather sued unto, to accept of Mariana,
then that he himself should become a Suitor unto her, but greatness without
desert finds no place where goodness sits inthronized, for he having made known
his love ^uit to the Princess Mariana, received from her a flat denial; which
so exaspe^ated his spi^ics, that now he breaths forth nothing but revenge, and
long was it not ere he found an opportunity to put his malice in execution, for
having by his espials learned that the two Lovers, every evening all the
shutting up of Titan^ golden Gates, used to walk abroad to take the comfort of
the Western breathing air, he with a party of his followers suddenly surprised
them, and carried them prisoners to his ship, where being deaf to all
entreaties, he hoised sails, and with as much ex^edition as could be made,
sailed toward the Country of Fez, but the Heavens being angry at such wicked
attempts, sent forth such a violent tempest on the sea, as made the stoutest
spirit of them all to tremble. For the second day after their departure, rose
as it were a foggie mist from out the seas, when on a sudden the clearness of
the skies might not be seen for the darkness of the air, dreadful flashes of
lightning seemed to have set the seas-on fire, and terrible vollies of thunder
threatened the shaking of the Heavens, and sundring of the earth; showers of
rain powered down as if there had been a general inundation, and the winds
roared so boisterously from each corner, as if Boreas, Auster, Zephirus and
Eurus had been at odds among themselves, or joined together for the destruction
of their vessel; now were they at their wits end, neither seeing for the dark,
nor hearing for the noise, how any thing should be amended, and yet was every
thing amiss; one while their ship was so high they scarcely can discern the
hollow waves from aloft, another while they sink so low, they hardly can descry
the to^s of over peering billows from beneath: and though it were midday by the
course of time, yet seemed it midnight by occasion of the storm. Now knew they
not what to do, and yet was every one doing something: one plyeth the pump,
until for weariness he fainieth, another la^eth out wa^e^, until for weakness
he falls: some pour forth their prayers, others impationtly torment their own
bodies, and some vow ^weet incense and obla^ions to the Gods; this man (in
vain) repaireth the ^racking tacklings, and another at adventure renteth down
the falls; here stands one fast clinging to a loose board, there another
clean st^ipped to abide his chance, every one disorderly doing that thing
whereunto the extremity of his passion did presently direct him In the mean
time the two Lovers who ex^pected nothing but to be devoured (...) that
merciless element, fervently committed their souls unto God, being as willing
to descend into Neptunes briner habitation, as to go along with that Mahumetan
Prince, from whom they expected not the least favor. Amurath himself who
though hardened in villainy, yet seeing the inevitable danger he was in, began to
shake with fear, and to repent of his treachery against the two Princes, all
persons thus surrounded with despair, nothing was expected but to have the Sea
their grave, and to be devoured by the inhabitants of that warry element. In
this tempestous condition w^ will leave them for a while, and return to the
Court of King Ferdinando, which upon the news of the Princesses surprizal, was
stricken into a sudden astonishment, the King mourned, and the Nobles. held
down their heads: the Ladies lamented, and the Commons sighed: ^^;stead of
music and songs of triumph, nothing was now heard but gr^ans and la^enta
(...). Oye inhabiters of the Celestial Mansions said the sorrowful King
Ferdinando, why do ye suffer such impieties to be done? O why did I live to see
this day, that the greatest comfort of my gray hairs, should become the
ch^efest object of my miseries? O restore to me my Mariana again, or take from
me this poor remainder of my life, which without her company will be but
irksome and tedious unto me. In this manner complained the woeful King, making
the stones relent at his dolorous complaints; but Fortune that is cons^ant in
nothing but inconstancy, soon ceased his complaints, turned his mourning into
melody, and his weeping and tears, into joy and ^aughter.

For about four days a^^e, the lost couple were again heard of, being by
shipwreck (...) upon the Cilician coast: for the Heavens ^eing angry with
Amuraths design, maugre what the Sail^rs could do, brought the Sip back again,
and being by the force of the wind driven upon a rock near the ^^ore, the Sip
split in a thousand pieces, in this sudden exigency every one said h^ld
something which might be con^ucible to the saving of their ^ves: here was one
fast clinging to the mast, whose lofty height layno^^ vel with the waves, there
was another fast ^rasping an empty chest which with ut Oars or Pilot did by
degrees (...) the shore, there another embracing a plank, making that his
Asyllum in so eminent danger, others whose skill in swiming made them more
adve^turous, committed themselves to the mercy of the Sea, being tossed on the
waves like fortunes tennis hall, till at last those waves ^osse^ them safe to
land. The Prince Arnaldo whom no peril whatsoever could separate from his dear
Mariana, desireing to l^ve only for her sake, and yet to live without her
would be worse then death unto him seeing himself surrounded by danger on every
side, he began hastly to provide for his and the Prince^es safety, and the Gods
being careful of their preseservation, they happened upon a part of the side of
the (...), so long and large that they had room to sit thereon, and expect the
evert what Destiny had determined to do with them. Whilst thus on the Ark of
providence they we wafting toward the shore, they espied Prince Amurath a
stride on a price of abroken m^st, labou^ing with his hands to preserve himself
from drowning, for hough being conscious of his guilt he expected to receive
unwelcome entertainment wheresover he should land, yet the sight of death was
so terrible to him, that he resolved to prolong his life as long as he could.
The Prince Arnaldo though secing him in this forlorn condition, yet could not
forbear to speak thus unto him. Perfidious man (said he) now is thy treachery
recompensed upon thy own head, though therewith thou may glory of our ruin,
which yet can be but small comfort to th^e, when thou shall carry such a load
of guilt with thee to the other world. But ^cearcely had he uttered th^^e
words, when a billow parted them, from hearing each other, by this time some of
the Sa^lors had swam to the land and informed the Cilicians in what (...) the
Princes were in, who thereupon maned some boats out, and taking the despa^ing
Lovers into them, they happily landed to their unspeable comfort, soon after
actived Prince Amurath mounted in state on his wooden horse, but when the
Cilicians understood it was he by (...) t^eachery their Pr^ncess was carried
away, like the en^aged Grecian dames when they fell upon the sweet tongued Poet
Orpheus, so did these peope fall upon him; and notwithstanding Arnaldo did what
he ^oul^ to persuade them to the contrary, as being willing to have reserved
him to a farther examination, yet were his endeavers therein, but like to his
who goes about to stop the Carrent of a stream when a^it once overflowes its
banks; no prayers nor entreaties could stop their fury, never ceaseing till
such time that one had gotten an arm of him, another a (...), and another some
other kind of limb, all which they vapo^ring showed about as the remarkable
Trophies of their victory, ^ay so bach^rous was their cruelty, that with their
staves they never left belabou^ing the remaining part of his dismembered t^unk,
so long as they could perceive the least life or mot^on in it.

The news of this Shipwreck and the Princes safety ^ame which a speedy fleight
to the ears of King Ferdinando, which struck him into such an ecstasy of joy as
could scarcely be contained in the bounds of reason, although it something
displeased him that Prince Amurath was murdered in that manner; but his
Daugh^ers fa^ety would not suffer any g^ief to enter into the Crannies of his
heart, when joy had taken fall possession thereof?. But much he longed to have
his eyes confirmed with the truth of the news his ears hard, and therefore
taking horse, with some few of his Nobles, he suddenly posted down to the
Seaside; but to express the joy at the meeting of the King and the two
Princes, is beyond the skill of my pen to declare, being a subject fit only for
imagination, all words whatsoever wanting weight wherewith to express it; let
it suffice to tell ye, that after some short stay and congratulation on both
sides for this happy meeting, they returned again to the City of Adrianople,
the place where King Ferdinando kept his Court, from whence the King speedily
dispatcheth a Messenger to the Emperor of Fez, to excuse himself for the death
of Prince Amurath, And now are great preparations made again for the wedding,
the King intending to have it solemnized in a more sumptuous manner then was
before intended; but Fortune once again crossed his designs, and turned his
Scene of mirth into mourning, as we shall declare unto you.

For Fame had with speedier wings ore gone the messenger, and carried the
report of Prince Amuraths death to Fez, before such time that he could get
thither, representing the same to the Emperiour in such a hor^id garb, as made
it seem to be ten times blacker then indeed it was, for they not only added to
the exquisiteness of his torments, but that all was done by the command of King
Ferdinando, and that he himself was a spectator thereof: whereupon the Emperor
in a Mavelous rage vowed by Mahomet that he would not leave one Christian
alive in Cilicia, but offer them all in s^c^ifice to appea^e the Ghost of his
murdered Son, and to (...) his oath he ra^^ed a mostpoissant army, consisting
of a hundred thousand men, with which he suddenly landed in Cilicia, burning
and destroying with unspeakable cruelty wheresoever he came, neither for nor
Age received any pity at his hands, nor place but felt the weight of his
cruelty; the hoary head and thee tender Virpin were alike destined to the
sword: the Infants sprawled on the tops of the soldiers pikes, and wives were
ravished before their Husbands faces; the riches of the Realm were made the
Spoil of the Soldiers, and all things lended to a general destruction, as well
of the means to preserve life, as of life it self. To put a stop to such
destructive proceedings, King Ferdinando speedily raises an Army, and with
great courage sets upon the Emperor, where betwixt them was fought such a
bloody battle, that the ground lay covered with slaughterd ca^kasses, and the
grass was changed from a verdent color to a purple hue; Fortune was for a long
while indifferent on which head to put the palm of victory on, such equal
courage appearing on both sides, as if death were less feared then to be
conquered. The Prince Arnaldo in whom the blossoms of courage began to bud, as
having never been so sufficiently tried before in the fields of Mars, knowing
that this day must either be the loss of his Mistress, or the wining unto him
perpetual renown; wrought such wonders with his sword, as would puzle antiquity
to find his parallel, for wheresoever he went he left such troph^es of his
manhood, as made the stoutest spirits of the Pagans to tremble; but multitude
overcoming valor, engaging himself too far, his sword being glutted with
Pagans blood, and his Arm ore wearied with slaying such multitudes, he was at
last encompassed by those Mahumteans, and maugre whatsoever he could do, was by
them taken prisoner; with whose loss fell the courage of the Cilicians, so that
immediately they turned their backs and fled, and notwithstanding King
Ferdinando did all that he could to persuade them to stay, yet his words sound
but deaf ears, so that seeing he had but a running auditory to save himself was
forced to run with them for company, bringing sad news to the City of
Adrianople, of his own overthrow and their present danger, ^ron after this
fatal fight, the whole Country yielded themselves to the Emperor, saving only
Adrianople aforesaid, which he strongly besieged. In this straight King
Ferdinando sent for succor to Sir John Hawkwood, as the most renowned person
for deeds of Arms then living upon the face of the Earth, of whose successes
and honorable achievements we shall discourse in the Chapter following.

CHAP. X.
The terrible Battle betwixt Sir John Hawkwood. and the Emperor of Fez, which
lasted three whole days, the marriage betwixt Arnaldo and the Princess Mariana.
THe Army of the Cilicians being overthrown by the Emperor of Fez, and King
Ferdinando himself straitlily besieged in the City of Adrianople, as you heard
in the former Chapter? brings not able to hold out long against those mighty
Forces of the Mahumetans, he therefore (as we told ye) dispatched a Messenger
to Sir John Hawkwood, destreing his assistance, in these words.

To the most renowned, and invincible Sir John Hawkwood.
Fames golden Trumpet having proclaimed your matchless deads to this our
Country, as the only succourer of distressed Princes, the righter of wrongs,
and ovetthrower of unjust oppression; this noble Character of your worth has
invited me to desire your aid against the Emperor of Fez, who has unjustly
invaded my Country with barbarous cruelty, killing and destroying all
wheresoever he comes, threatening to extirpate the very name of Christianity out
of my land, defer not therefore with all speed to hasten to my releif, whereby
you shall not only win eternal renown, but also shall receive in reward of such
high deservings, whatsoever you will desire, even to the half of my kingdom.

K. Ferdinando.


No sooner had Sir John Hawkwood received this Letter, but pricked on with
desire of honor in so just a quarrel, he assembled all his Forces together,
being about twenty thousand brave English spirits, each of such skill as able
to command an Army; to whom he made this following Oration.

Kind Soldiers, and fellow Country men, my comparions in Arms, and sharers
with me in all dangers, and sucesses; who by your valiant acts have eternized
your names, and made your fame to sound as far as Phoebus darts forth his golden
rays, to you I speak who have been so often triumphant as if victory were
chained to your swords, and good fuccess hereditary to ye, whose hearts are so
invincible as have found no Enemy unconquerable, no Fort uns^aleable, no Way
unpassable; who know not what it into be conquered, nor to turn your back to
the face of an Enemy. Now does honor once more summon you to the exercise of
your Arms in rescuing a Christian King from the fury of the bloody followers of
Makomee. who is ready to be delivered into their hands, if nor timely releived
by your unconquerable manhood; the King of Cilicia craves our assistance
against the Mahaumetan Emperor of Fez, who has burnt his Towns, razed his
Cities, and slain his subjects; what though his men be many the greater shall
be the honor in conquering them, remember it is I that lead ye, who will never
leave ye, but either bring ye off with fortunate success, or ^oose my life in
the enconnter.

This his Oration wrought such effects in his souliers, that they all vowed to
live and dye with him, and to follow him wheresoever he commanded them,
whereupon returning the Messenger back again to King Ferdinando, that he would
not fall to be with him as soon as possibly he could, he made all things ready
for his Journey, and by speedy marches soon came to the confines of Cilicia,
whether no sooner being come, but he sent King Ferdinando special notice
thereof, encouraging him to a resclute defiance of those Barbarous (...), and
promising to give him a speedy supply of (...) ^spatcheth a Message to the
Emperor, the (...) whereof was as follows.

That he desired him to desist from ^^ther prosecution of any outrage against
the Cilicians, and to restore again to King Ferdinando those Places and Persons
which he had taken, and then presently to depart the Land or to exspect what a
just cause and a sharp sword could do against him. But so little wrought this
message on the insulting foe, that he laughed both it and the messenger to
scorn, asking him if his Master were well in his wits, and whether be had not
need of a purge of Hellebore, to think with his small handful of men, to
command the most puissant Monarch of the whole earth? but if be would be so
fool: hardy as to offer to fight with him, he should be encountered with a part
of his Army, whilst the rest should stand still, and look on to beheld his
overthrow.

These words of the Emperor being told in the English Camp, so exasperated the
soldiers, that they breathedforth nothing but blood and revenge; if likewise
set an edge on their Generals valor, to be thus disdainfully braved, although
he covered it with more moderateness then the rash soldiers, who would
incontinently have marched against him, but the noble Hawkwood, though he knew
the conrage of his soldiers to be invincible, yet would not rashly engage them
in that fight, on the success whereof depended either the gaining of a King, or
the irreparable loss of the whole Kingdom; he therefore smothered his
resolutions for the present, till time should give him a fitter opportunity to
declare them, in the mean time be made provision against that fatal day, not
only refreshing his soldiers, and supplying his Ammunition, but alto
fortifying places that might be a safe retreat unto him if his army should be
over powered by the Emperors more numerous forces

Having thus prov^ded all things ready, he marches with his Army against the
Enemy, who notwithstanding all his brags, raises his siege, to oppose him with
his whole Army; whereupon King Ferdinando came out of the City, and with his
small remainder of soldiers joined with the English, the noble and adventurous
Merchant Tailor Sir John Hawkwood entertained him very courteously, but now was
no such time for complement as action, both Armies being near to each other,
therefore riding unto the head of his Camy, he spoke to them in these
encouraging specehes.

Brave sons of Mars, whose valor the world admires and dreads, now is the time
come which ye so heartily desired, to avenge your selves on this miscreant
Emperor for those contumelious speeches he uttered against us, and to make him
know the difference betwixt saying and doing. Now must be tried which will cut
deepest of the Christians swords, or the Sarazens cymiters, I need not to tell
ye the justness of our cause, and that victory is the attendant on valor,
those are only spurs to prick forward the du I, and to sharpen the edge of the
cowards courage, I know it is enough for you only to be shown the face of your
Foe, which being once done all words whatsoever is rather impediments to ye
then helps.

Nor was the Emperor wanting on the other side to the encouraging of his
soudiers, who ^iding up to the head of his Army, spoke to them in these words.

This is the day renowned Captains and valiant soldiers, that by your manhood
must put a period to this war, and take a full revenge for the loss of my son
Amuraths, ye have now only this handful of men to conquer, whose desperate
condition has enforced them to adventure their whole fortunes at one blow and
like a dying candle to give one blaze more of valor before their
extinguishment; their running looks do promise us an assured victory, and an
add^tion of honor to your unconquerable arms, march on therefore as to a
surprise rather then fight, and let not one of them escape, but feel the fury
of your revengeful swords.

These words being no sooner ended but the battle joined, the Christians Cross
against the Mahumetans slag, but never was English Mastiff and Irish Greyhound
more equally matched, the Christians making that good by their valor, which
the Mahumetans had in their number Now be an death to appear in his greatest
horror, each place being strewed with the carcasses of slaugh, tered persons;
here lay one with a stream of bledd issuing from his new received wound, in
another place a trunck without a head, here arms and legs, whom a sharp sword
had forced to take a sad farewell from their bodies; there was another who would
fain habe run away, but that his legs were entangled in his own guts, in such a
diversity of manner death dressed out his diet, as if he intended to invite the
King of Beasts and Birds to feed on the ban ^uet. The renowned Hawkwood was
evermore amongst the thickest of his Enemies, dealing such blows with his
sword, and giving so many Mahumetans their deaths, as if he intended to
over^harge Charons boat in ferrying them over the Stygian river; nor were the
other English Captains wanting in their duties, but by their valors sent
thousands of Mahumetan souls to inhabit in Plutoe's fiery Regions, yet still
those Infidels held out with great obstina^y, not shrinking for any danger,
although they were ready to be carried away in streams of their own blood. In
this manner continnued they fighting, until night with his sable manile had
darkness the Hemispheere, and them more for want of light then coura ^e, they
retreated, the Christians to the C^ty, and the Mahumetans to their Camp.

The Empero^rsceing so many of his soldiers to have fallen that day by the
hards of the Christians, would in revenge thereof, that night have paut Arnaldo
to death, whom he had left behind in his Tent under a strong gua^d; but his
Captaias doubting the success of the Battle and fearing a ret^^tation persauded
him to the contrary, Next morning no sooner had Aurora wher^o in the day, but
both Armies were again dra^^ (...) the field, and the signal being given, fell
on again a fresh to their work of mankinds destruction: the thundering drums
beat ala^ ums of death, and the shril Trumpets sounded forth many thousands
that day their knel, horror, death and destruction surrounded the Mahumetans
on every sid; yet still their fresh number made more work for the Christians
valor. The noble Hawkwood whom no danger whatsoever could daunt or make
afraid, being mounted on a milk whilte Barbary stred, nimbly pranced amongst
his Troops, encourging the valiant, and checking the slow: and then charging
into the thickest ranks of his Enemies, taught his soldiers by his example the
way how to conquer. The E^perour on the other side did all that he could to
uphold his soldiers fainting courages, using threatenings and commendations
according as he saw occasion, so that the fight continued sharp on both sides
till night again parted their fury, when they both retreated, the one into the
City, and the other to his Camp.

Yet not withstanding this great effusion of blood, the next morning ere
Phoebus appeared in that Horrizon, they fell to it again as fresh as it they
intended before they had done to glut the jaws of death. But Sir John Hawkwood
intending to make short work of it, pressed so hard upon that side where the
Emperor was in person, that at length he took him prisoner. Then might yeu
behold a sudden change in his army some running this way, some that, and others
therowing down their arms and craving mercy, King Fardinando who had behaved
himself very gallantly ^uring all the fight, now seeing the victory apparently
on their sid; (...) down on his knees in the place where he stood, giving
thanks to Almighty God for the same; then enquiring of the prisor^rs sor the
Prince Arnaldo, and having received intelligence from them he speedily
hastea^th unto him; great was the joy received at the sight of each other, as
those whose desperate conditions had given themselves over for lost, great Sir
said the Prince, that my eyes do behold you again in safety, how infinitely am
I hound unto the Gods: and as you have made my eyes happy thereby, so let my
ears be blessed with the news of the Princess Marianas s^aety, the King briefly
certyfying him that she was well, as also giving him a short narrative of the
present affai^s, they loath hasted to cong^atulate atula^^e with Sir John
Hawkwood, who was very busy in entertaining of his royal prisoner, whom he
used so courteously, and with such respect, that the Emperor could not but
confess that he had met with a noble Enemy.

The Prince Arnaldo had no s^oner fixed his eyes on Sir John Hawkwood, but he
thou^* he saw in him the v^r^^icture of true magnaminity, so that he though:
himself happy by a^guainted prisoner, thereby to become (...) with so renowned
a Champion, and prized his liberty at a far higher rate for being effected by
so gallant a person. Dear Sir (said be) to whom I owe whatsoever I am at
present, be pleased to accept of this mite of acknowledgment, till such time as
Fortune shol^ enable me to make you more ample satisfaction. Renowned Prince
(replied the generons Hawkwood) to whom all service is but duty, and for whom
whatsoever is affected comes far short of your deserts; I must only attribute
it to your goodness, to put such high acknowl^dgements upon my low perform
ances, but rest assured whatsoever I am is wholly and soley at your command.

A^er ^ome ^their stort discourse passed betwixt the King and the Emperor, the
worlds bright eye Hyperion beginning now to draw toward his Western home, they
prepared to return to the City of Adrianople, the soldiers laden with spoils,
and thronged with prisoners, was met by the women and children of the City,
(for there was scearce a man lest therein who was not either killed in the
former battle, or now under service with King Fardinando) with songs of
Triamph, and other like rejoycings: the way where Sir John Hawkwood passed was
strowed with roses and green herbs, every one extolling his Fame to the skies,
as the most renowned Hero of that Age.

The Princess Mariana, who during these three days had been at her
supplications for the prosperous success of the Christians army refusing to eat
one bit of bread all that time; receiving now the (...) tidings of the
Emperors overthrow, and the Princ. Arnaldo's releasement, she was so far
transported with an^ver measure of joy, as for the present bereft her of the
use of reason; for regardless of what attire she was in, and forgeting to
refresh her body, which was now enfeebled for want of sustenance, net staying
for a coach or other attendants, she hastily ran with the foremost to meet
them. The Prince Arnaldo who thought each minute a year till he hap a sight of
his devinest Mistress, now seeing her coming, alighted from his horse, and as
hastily ran for to embrace her; both pa^ties remaining ^peechless for a time,
being so overjoyed at each others sight, that their tongues wanted utterance to
express it: but after some little time of pause, Arnaldo break silence, and
thus speak to her.

I think my self happy most excellent Princes, that the Fates have so far
prolonged my life, as once again to behold those Love-darting eyes of thine,
and to enjoy again your most delightful Company, the deprivation whereof, was
the greatest torment the Emperor could inflict upon me; without which, the
most habitable place is but a desert, and all pleasure but vexation, and now
what can I say more, but to desire that Hymen's torch may burn clear at our
wedding, and that the Sun of our happiness may not come to be Eclipsed again,
by any disastruous accident whatsoever.

Renowned Prince, replied the love sick Mariana, that the Fates have restored
us thus again to each other, how much are we bound to Providence and next to
that the renowned English General, of whose worth to speak, were to show the
light of the, Sun by a candle, Now I hope will a serene sky of comfort succeed
those clouds of trouble, and our joy be the greater, and more refined, for
having passed through these fires of grief and tribulation.

Then hand in hand paced they into the City, whether being come, no cost was
spared for the entertainment of the English, who were welcomed in such a sort
with feastings and triumphs, that my p^n wants art so describe the same. And
now King Ferdinando prepares a third time for the solemnization of his
Daughters Nuptials, ho^in the Fates would be more propi^ious to him, then to
put another Remora to the hindrance of the marriage. The Lords and Knights by
the Kings appointment proclaimed a solemn Justs to b^ triumphs at the ^ame,
which should en^ure for the space of three days, of which the renowned
Hawkwood was chosen chief Champian The appointed day being come, the Bride and
Bridg^oo^n were sal^^ed early that morning with diverse sorts of ra^e and
excellent (...); the streets were garnished with costly pageants, and the
windows hung ^^chly with clothes of Arras, all the way that the Bride and
Bridgroom were to pais to Church, was strewed with roses, and other oderiferous
flowers, the Bells in every steeple proclaimed the peoples joy, and mi^th
abcunded in every place. The King to honor the Feast the more, gave free
liberty to the Emperor to walk at his pleasure, after ded on by several of his
own Lords that were prisoners. Great was the concourse of people from all Lands
at this Royal Solemnity, so that it was a wonder to behold how in so short a
space, so many Gallants should be assembled together from so diverse part.

And now the time of the day gave them notice to prepa^e them ready to go to
Church; the Bridegroom was led by tro Earls daughters, being apparaled in a
suit of flame c^loured Tassaty, to signify that he burnt in the flames of
Love, the Princess Mariana was conductor by the famous Sir John Hawkwood on the
one hand, and a Duke or Candy on the other; her apparel was a rich Gown of
sky-sclo^r ^abble, to signify that her mince was as free from vice, as a clear
sky is from clouds, The Priest having joined them together in Hymen's band^,
they returned again to ye Palace, where was provided for them a most sumptuous
dinner, wherein no cest nor art was spared, to set it forth in the best manner.
The afternoon was spent in Music and dancing. till such time as Morpheus
summoned them to sleep.

Next morning the Turnament began, a fair large place being railed in for that
purpose, wherein a stage was setup for the King and the Lords to behold the
same, the first that entered the list was Sir John Hawkwood, mounted on a cole
black stee^, his armor of the same color, denoting thereby a black day to all
those that durst (...) him; he behaved himself with so much gallantry thathe
foiled that day above threescore Knights, to his high honor and commendations.
The next day his Lieutenant General (being also a Merchant Tailor) entered the
lists, mounted on a Bay horse, his armor was red, having upon his Burgonet a
plume of ^ed seathers: he likewise behaved himself with so much valor and
manhood, that he overcame above fifty Knights that day. On the third day ^an
many approved Knights against each other, wherein the English O^ficers behaved
them ^^ives so gallantly, that they wan the prize away from all others, The
King in reward of such high deserts, conferred on many of them the honor of
Knighthood, and made Sir J. Hawkwood one of the principal ^eers of his Kingdom,
with a large annual stipend to maintain his stare and dignity. The Private
soldiers felt likewise-largely of his ^ounty, so that every one commended the
nobleness of King Ferdinando's mind, and thought their blood well spent where
they sound such royal gratitude, all parties being thus well plea^ed, we will
leave, them for time and return to discourse of Ralph and William, whom we left
at their Trades in London.

CHAP. XI.
The number of servants, and noble House (...) by Ralph, how he encounted with
Iurnbul the great Scottish Cham^ion, and how he built Blackwel-hall, and give it
to the City of London.
YOu may remember the last time we speak of Ralph, we left him married so his
Masters daugh^^r, the fai^ Arabella: since which time his Father in law bring,
left him is whole estate, his customers also en^easing very much, he was forced
to take more Pre^^^ces, and to entertain a number of journey men, by whom he
was waited on to Church as a petty Prince, for he had fi^ty prentices, and
threescore and ten journey-men, so that he spent an Ox a week in his house, and
a hogshead of beer everyday. His hosptallity was so great, that there was more
meat given away each day at his door, then many ^ich people spend in their
houses. He was likewise partner in diverse ships at sea, which traded for
Merchandise into several Count^ies, by which means in short space he attained
to a very bast estate.

It happened at that time that the King of Scotland invaded England in hostile
manner, killing, burning, and destroying, all wheresoever he came. He brought
with him a great Giant or Champion, called Turnbull, for that in his youth he
had killed a fierce wild Bull, bred in the Forest of Caledonia, which had
destroyed much people: the same of this Champion made call people wheresoever
he came to run away for dread of him, for he was of such strength that he would
encounter with ten men at once, and to his strength was added such a cruelness
of nature, that he spared none which fell into his hands; by aid of whom the
Scots made such havoc in the North parts of England as turned all places there
into ruin and desolation.

To repress these outrages King Edward desired aid of the City of London, where
upon a Common Council was called, whereat Mr. Blackwel (for so was Ralphs
surname) was present; where it was propounded to each man what he would do for
service of the King. Mr. Blackwel, whose heart was as loyal as his purse was
large, to show a fair copy for the others to write after, subscribed to go
himself in person, and to carry with him a full band, whom he would maintain at
his own charge, this his generous subscription, drew on others to contribute
largely* ^o that there was raised amongst them, enough to furnish a formidable
Army.

The necessities of the Kingdoms affairs requiring have, Mr. Ralph Blackwell
was no soever come home, but he told his journey men and prent^^s what he had
done, asking them if they would be willing to go along with him to which they
alltea^ily condiscended, each striving who should exoress himself most forward
for the service: which heir willing mind he thankfully accep^ed of, promising
if any of them were wounded or maimed in the service, they should be so
carefully provided for after their return, as should give them no cause to
repent of their undertakings. Next he bought them Muskets, Pikes, Drums, and
Colors, habiting them all in a like livory of while, that they might be
differenced from all others, choosing the most skilful of them to be Officers
under him, as Livetenant, Ensign Serjants and Corporals etc. This done he drew
them each day before their departure out into the fleld, to exercise them, and
make them fit for the day of ba^tel.

And now the time came that the King set forwa^d with his A^my, when he found
Captain Ralph ready and prepared to go along with him; his men so well
discipline'd and accoutred, that the King gave him the title of the Noble
Captain, his band had also given to it the name of the Royal Band, whom the
King so much honored, that he made them the second Company in his own Regiment;
all things being thus ready, with a spredy march they hasted against the Scots
who were than harazing with fire and sword in the Bishopric of Durham, to whom
the King sent this following message.

That he wondered his Brother of Scotland without any cause shown should so
unjustly invade his kingdom; and exercise such cruelty upon the English, as
would make Pagans blush to own such actions; that therefore he required
satisfaction of him for all those injuries done, or he would right himself the
best he could with his sword.

To this the Scottish King returned answer, that the King of England has made
war against the French King, his Allie and friend, and has done him much
mischief in his Country; that in revenge of those injuries, he had drawn his
sword against the English, and was resolved not to sheath it up again, till he
had taken a full revenge on them, for those damages they had done to the French.

The King having received this answer, f^aught with anger and (...), marches
up within fight of their Army, but the Scots had (...) possessed themselves of
so (...), that there was no (...) without eminent danger, (...) the King caused
his (...) deep (...) about them, to keep them from forraging, that for want of
victuals, h^ might at last compel them (...).

Seven days together did the Army his face one another, when at last out comes
a challenge from Sir ^urnbu^ the Scottish Champion, which containe^ these wer^s.

Think not proud English that by our lying thus still, we are not able, or
afraid to fight with you; no, this is bu^ only to give you time (...) your long
march, to refresh your selves, that when the time comes, you may be the better
able to encounter with us, least when you are beaten i^ might be your excuse to
say your Army was o^e wearied, but if in the mean space there be any one
amongst you that dares to fight with me hand to hand, to show the Armies some
little spor^, he shall find me ready to answer him to morrow morning by eight
of the clock in the meadow, which lies on the left side of our Camp, (...)
will attend his arrival with much zeal and impatiency.

Turnbul.


This Challenge being read in the English Army, the noble Captain (...) King
that he might accept thereof, to which the King (...), whereupon by the same
Messenger, he returned (...).

I received your challenge which promises much in the contents, what ever will
be performed in the Chapter, according to your (...), you shall be answered at
the time and place appointed; where if you perform with your sword what your
pen has promised, you (...) add to your renown, if not you will only make
mirth to the English* and become the Trophee of

R. Blackwel.


Next morning at the time appointed both Champions met in the meaddow, each so
fully resolved, as valuing life less then victory. Sir Turnbul was mounted on a
cole black steed, his Armor and Capari^ons answerable thereto, having (...)
forth: on the other side Captain Ralph was clean (...) was milk white, his
armor representing nakedness, artificially contrived, that to the beholders
(...) to be a naked man, his device was a white Dove fully fledged, with these
words, plumed for victory, at the Trumpets sound they ^un against each other,
(...) so Fircely, that their Lances flew in a thousand prices, then dismounting
and drawing their swords being on the ground with an (...) courage they
assailed each other, laying on so thick and fast, as if their stock of valor
would never be spent; what ever has been fal^ed of old Heroes, and their
incomperable manhood, came far short of this combat, valor and skill being so
mixed in either, that never were two Cocks of the Game more equally matched:
what Sir Turnbul exceed* din strength, the other poised, him in nimbleness,
whereby he (...) Sir Turnbuls blows, that at last his arm began to fall with
weariness, which Captain Ralph perceiving, with fresh courage redoubles his
strokes, till at length he brought his adversary to lie at his m^re^. The Scots
seeing their Champion overcome in whom (...) extraordinary confidence, ^allied
out with a pa^ty to have (...) prize^ Captain Blackwel; but King Edward who was
watchful upon all such advantages, and had before provided for whatsoever
should happen was there presently to his rescue; so that this single encounter
or^w^^n at last a general engagement betwixt both the armies; thou was (...),
hacking, and slashing on every side, St. Georges B^nner against St. Andrews
^ross, men were mowed down by ^he ^ithe of Death, as ^^pened ears of Co^n falls
before the sickle, and the whole field was made a shambles for humane
slaughters, some lay wallowing in their own (...), some were cursing, some
praying, and others crying (...) for mercy. The Englishmen being resolved to
purchase victory at what (...) soever (...) cost them* pressed so hard upon the
Scots as made them at last to give ground and flee, whom the English p^rsued in
a full C^e^r and with incredible slaughter, for the Scots being laden with the
plunder of the Country, were thereby much h^^^red in their flight, so that most
of them were either killed or taken, the King with some few very hardly
recovering Scotland.

King Edward having obtained this considerable victory, as soon as the field
was cleared, commanded Captain Blackwel to put a Basenet on his head, for he
would Knight him, the Captain desired to be excused, saying he was neither
worthy nor able to take such an estate upon him, b^t the King made him to put
it on notwithstanding all excuses, and then with a sword in both his hands (as
the manner then was) he strongly struck him on the neck, and so Kni^hted him,
giving him a hundred pound lands a year for this noble atcheivement which he
had accomplished.

The victor thus obtained King Edward returned with honor and triumph to
London, Sir Ralph Blackwel bringing along with him the Scottish Champion Sir
Turnbul as his prisoner, whom the King out of especial favor had bestowed upon
him, who was afterward ransomed by the Scottish King for five hundred ma^ks of
(...). The Citizen^ of London received them with great jo^, ^inging of bells,
making of honesties, and other devices; such slocking about to beh^ld Sir
Turnbul, whose same was spread in all parts, as was wonderful to behold.

Sir Ralph was no sooner returned home, and that the King had dismissed him
with communications and (...), but he returned again as^esh to his trade,

Not long after (...) was a great (...) hom^, called the Go^den Adventure,
which had been five years (...) trading in the East Indies, and was very rich^^
laden with diverse commodities: I (...) Sir Ralph had (...) part, which so
advanced his esta^r, tha^^^ was (...) chosen to be Sheri^^ of London, in which
office he beha^ed himself very (...), kept a noble house and executed Justice
to al^ men impartially, neither favoring the rich for th^i^ mightiness, nor
d^laying the poor because of the ^^pove^ty, but to every one dealt with so eve
a hand, that it grew to be a proverb, as good go to empty the Sea with a spoon
as to persuade Sir Ralph from doing Justice, to give some instances of his
(...), man not be (...) unpleasant to the Reads^. A rich covetous Churl had
lost a bag of money containing one hundred pound, wherefore be caused it to be
published by the Crier, that whosoever had found the same, and wou^d restore
it, he should have ten pounds for his pains? It hap^^d an honest poor man found
it, who brought it to the Churl, requiring ten pound for his pains as was
promised, but this covetuous Carren minding to deceive the poor man, deeply
swore there was a hundred and ten pounds, wherefore he would not give him a
(...): thereupon the poor man had a Warrant for him and brought him before Sir
Ralph Blackwel, where each of them having told his tale, Sir Ralph commanded
the money to be produced, which being done, he said to the rich Churl, you lost
a bag of money with an hundred and ten pounds in it, and this poor man found
one which had only an hundred pounds therein, therefore by your own confession
this is not lively to be the bag which you lost, therefore here honest man do
thou take it, and employ it we ^l for the good of thy wife and children, and if
thou finde^ a bag with an hundred and ten pounds therein then b^ing it to this
(...) in the mean time keep that (...) do. The rich Churl hearing him to
decide the business so cried out that his bag had but an hundred pounds in it,
and therefore desired that he might have it: but Sir Ralph told him it was then
too late to speak, and so dismissed him without it.

At another time it so happened that a Tylar being at work upon a house, chanced
to slip his hold, and so tumbled down, but by great fortune to him, it was his
hap to fall upon another man as he was walking by, whereby he killed the other
man: the son of the dead man hereupon brings the Tylar before Sir Ralph
Blackwel, desiring Justice against him for the death of his Father: the Tylar
pleaded chance medly, and that he did not kill him either wi^tingly or
willingly, but nothing would serve the young man but that the Tylar must be
sent to prison, no persuasions could prevail, to talk to him of reason was to
set a blind man to discern of colors, or a deaf man to judge of music;
nothing could satisfy for the death of his father, but the life of the Tylar.
Sir Ralph seeing his obstinacy, that reason could take no place in him,
adjudged, that to make him satisfaction, the Tylar should stand in the same
place where his father was killed, and the young man (if he would) might go up
to the top of the house and tumble down upon him, but this the man refusing to
do, the Tylar was discharged.

He used to look very narrowly after the Bakers, that they should not make
their bread too light causing one John of Stratford for making bread lesser
then the Assize, to be drawn on a wooden horse which went with wheels, quite
through the streets of the City, having a fools hood on his head and loaves of
bread about his neck, many other examples of his Justice might be produced, too
long here to re^i^e, we shall refer the Reader to the Chronicles of those
times, which discourse much of his commendations.

Sir Ralph having passed thorough the year of his Sheriffalty with honor and
credit, he afterward became one of the Alderm^n of the Cit^, living with great
splendor, and (...) both to rich and poor, that his hospitall^^y was taken
(...) of all London over, and now growing old in years ha^ing a vast estate,
and no children to give (...) unto, he began to (...) himself how to dispose of
part of it for the public benefit before (...) knowing how often the wills of

sorts of Woollen cloth, bread and narrow, brought from all parts of this Realm,
there to be sold; to the great benefit both of the City and strangers. This
Hall he freely bestowed upon the City, who for honor (...), gave it the name
of Blackwel hall, which it still retaine^^ unto (...).

Whose acts proclaim`d his worth both near and far,

was after his Death Canonized for a Saint.

his stock.

Now in a short space he grew to be so famous for his excellency ^a
workmanship, that he was taken notice of at Count, and preferred to be Tailor
to Queen Phillippa King Edwards wife, by which means he gained the custom of
the most Eminent Ladies at Court, for as it is commonly seen, for the Lords to
be of the Kings religion, so it is as usual for the Ladies in their clothes to
follow the Queens fashion. By making to those great Persons he soon attained to
a great Estate, but as his wealth increased so did his charge, for Dorothy was
very fruitful, bringing him almost every year a child; besides he kept thirty
journey-men, and had twenty prentices, whom he maintained all in one livory, so
that he came to be of great esteem in the place where be lived, passing through
all the Offices in the Parish, as Scavenger, Headbrough, Constable, Overseer
for the Poor, and Churchwarden, and not long after his abilities being more
thoroughly taken notice of, he was chosen one of the common Council of the City,
in all which Offices, he behaved himself with much prudence and understanding,
(...) after it came to pass that William being at Count, with (...) he had to
do for the Queen, that there came thither a (...) King of France, who
proclaimed a (...) hunting (...) the Province of Picardy, which had destroyed
(...), and turned that fruitful Country into a bar^en wilce^ne, the (...) all

was proclaimed in the Cou^ts of all the (...) whereupon a number of acted
spi^^t: whose comages promy^ed them on to valerous enterprises, prepared
th^m^elves to go. The news o^ this noble adventure, set such an edge on
Williams valor, that he likewise resolved to make one in that gallant assembly,
and coming home, imparted his resolutions unto his (...), which made the (...)
to ti^^kle down her cheeks, and her heart (...).

Dear Husband (said she has the desire of same; accompanied with so eminent
danger more (...) to call you hence away, then my unseigned affection, and the
Paternal care of your sweet Babies, to prevail with you to stay at hom^; were
we not so tied together in Hymen's Bands, that nothing but death should unloose
that Gordian Knot, O why then should Neptunes waves separate us asunder?
consider with your self he danger of the ^ourney, the more danger in the
enterprise in which (...) of us are concer^ed; as in a Ship of Merchandise
wherein are many partner^, that being sunk or taken, the loss redounds unto
them al^ your Children claim a part in it, I claim a part, it is not your self
alone you adventure, let younger spirit follow Mars hi^ Train, age soon enough
will hasten on grim death you need not to go meet him thus half way; and by
thrusting your self into need ess dangers force Atropos to cut your thread of
life, which otherwise might be spun out unto a longer date.

My second self (replied William) whose Love I prize far more then Indian Gold
or all the treasures wherewith America is enriched withal; seek not for to
dissuade, my mind from going when fame and honor b^th do call me forth; you
say there is danger in the enterprise the greater is the honor in the
conquest; he that fears to have his hands stung by the Bees, shall never
sweeten his lips with their honey Fames breath co^^s pains and sweat to
purchase it, and the path that leads to Honor is rugged, and full of intricate
Meanders. Yet fear not dearest wife, whom the Gods love, they will preserve,
and expect me home again with fresh Laurels interwoven with those which I
purchased before I was married unto thee.

Dorothy seeing him so resolved to go, and knowing the Journey to be attended
with Honor left off any fu^th dissuading him, and like an obedient wi^e,
provided all things ready that was necessary for him to carry in the journey;
so at the prefi^^d time he set ^or ^aids, attended only with one s^^vant,
leaving the (...) ^ing of his Trade (...) his absence to his eldest (...) man,
and the guidance of his house to his (...) many of the English ^^bility and
G^ntly went a^^ng with (...), an^ h^ving a (...) wind, and a (...) Sea, they
quickly arrived at Paris the chief City of France, which place they (...) of
(...) Countries, who were come to try their manhood against the (...) B^^r. The
King of France entertained (...) Foyall^, and that morning they appointed to
set forwards to Picardy, assembling them altogether, he made to them this
following Or^tion.

Brave Sons of Mars whom thirst of glories prize has invited over into this my
Country, I think me Court much honored in your Noble Companies, each of you
^ppearing li^e unto Meleager who slew the wild Bear, that the incensed Diana
sent amongst the Grecians for the neglect ^f her ^acrifices, your looks do
promise me an assured victory over that our Countries foe, which unto whose
victorious Arm; it shall happen, shall be rewarded with a Golden Spear, and an
annual pension according unto his degree and dignity.

These words being uttered the Company set forwards, being about three hundred
in number, habited all in gree^ like ^orresters, with swords by their (...),
and Boar-spears in their han^s, being come within view of the place, and each
man ordered according to his stand, they let loose a brace of lusty Beagles,
who soon rowz^d the Boar out of his Den then began every man to handle his
Weapons, and with a nimble eye to catch all advantages that might be taken; The
first that struk at him was a S^^ni^ Knight named Don A^onzo, who brake his
Spear but won ded him not, for his skin was sca^ely penetrable being as hard as
a Bu^s hide ^hen it is tanned. The next that encountced with him, was one
Mounsier De Bray a French man, who with great fury ran at him with his
Buze-spear, bu^^issing his blow, tumble^ quite over him, whereupon the Boar
turned back: so that (...), had (...) not been reseued by several Knights that
(...), which made the Boar to leave him, and take (...) William, who with true
English for^^ (...) him, and having broken his Spear at his first (...) sword,
wherewith he wounded (...) have away, no ^it (...) that bring in his toll
Ca^eere the^e (...) in his way ^^aelsh Gent^^man named Shon ap Rice, ap
Grissi^h, ap Howel, ap David, ap Morgan, ap Cadwalladar, who being (...) back

bring so unexpected^^ surprised, and mon^ted thus on a sudden, (...), and (...)
H^llow that (...) Boar thu^ (...) Italian Brothers, Sign or Francesco, and
Si^^nior (...), he let go his hol^, and (...) his self (...) him. (...)
Brothers wi^h a lust^-co^^age set upon the Boar (...), that he turned (...).
The (...) Gentleman had by (...) himself and gotten up again upon his feet, but
see^^ the Boar (...) Cuds plutt^r-a-nails (quoth (...)) (...) in her that her
can run at none but me. Whereupon to (...) Boar seeing him to fly, (...) and
tear the ^ol of the (...), s^ that Sir Taffy judged (...) his last da^ was
come, as (...) in his mi^d, eraect^^ tum^^ Jew never to ab^de ^wines slesh
again, But William our valiant (...) soon (...) of his f^ar, who (...) wi^ged

as if he (...) deveur (...) mor^^l he thrust his sw^rd with all his might dew^
his (...), so that he (...) his hear^ (...), which made him to ^all down (...)
dead. When Sir Taffy who was upon the (...), saw the (...), he quickly hasted
down, and drawing out his keen (...), (which was never (...) so any man's hurt
before, he (...), with might and main upon the Boar. William desired him to
hold telling him that the Boat was already dea^, no matter for that (quoth
Taffy) but who can tell whether he may live again, and therefore to make sure
work he never left till he had backed of the Boars two Forelegs, and then
setting his Monmouth cap aside, he said, now let her see whether her can run
after her again. The Company by this time were come in and laughed heartily at
Sir Taffies valor, and highly applauding Williams fortunate success, each of
them yellding the palm of victory to him and ascribing the honor thereof alone
to his victorious arm.

Great was the wonderment of the people at the vast proporsion of this Boar,
which upon measure they found to be nine foot and a half in length, from his
snout to his Tail, and five foot and two inches in height his eyes were as big
as Saucers, and his tusks of a spans length as sharp as Spanish needles. The
King of France in reward of this vallant service, conferied on William the
Honor of Knighthood, in the same place where he had killed the Boar, and with
his own hands gave him a Golden Spear, the prize of his Conquest. Then cut they
off the Boars head, and fixing it on the Truncheon of a Spear, it was carried
in triumph before them all the way in their return to Paris, whether being come
they were welcomed in most Royal manner, with ringing of Bells, Feastings
Pageants, and other costly devices; the people from all quarters flocking about
to behold William, who had delivered their Country, from their much feared
enemy, the destroying Boar.

Sir William having tarried some few days at Paris, growing quickly weary of
Court delights, and longing to behold his Native Country again, he took his
solemn leave of the King of France, and embarking with the rest of the English
in a gallant Ship, they cut the briney face of Neptune, and in few days
arrived in the delightful soil of England, at the town of Dover, where he made
no tarriance, but taking Horse, never stayed till he came to his beloved
Dorothy, who entertained him with these loving expressions.

Thrice welcome home my dearest Husband, my life's chief joy, and hearts desired
treasure, without whose company my life is to me irksome and uncomfortable, and
enjoying which all things seem pleasant and delectable. For ever blessed be the
immortal powers which kept thee safe throughout thy Journey, and crowned thy
endeavors with fortunate success; now let thy mind be fixed to stay at home,
banish all thoughts of leaving me again; less danger will thou find in the
embraces of a loving wise, then in ^he encounters with a Savage Boar.

Seal then a promise to me with a kiss
The last of thy adventure* shall be this.
My chiefest joy and hearts delight (replied Sir William) who can withstand the
force of this thy Oratory, especially being endeared with a kiss from thy
sugared lips, rest assured that thy Company is to me the greatest delights that
I possess in his life, and from which nothing but the eminent danger of my
Native Country shall persuade me any more to arms, rest then thy self contented
my dearest Dorothy.

Nothing but Death our company shall sover
Thine I am now, and will be so for ever.
According to this loving agreement, Sir William fell freshly again close to
his Trade, continued his old customers, gained every day more new ones, so that
he increased in his estate exceedingly? He still maintained the same number of
Journey-men that he did before, added to the number of his Prentices, and kept
such a bountiful house, that his fame rang all over London, none being so much
spoken off as Sir William Elsing (for so was his surname) Thus did he spend his
days In much joy, his wife loving, his servants singing, and his estate
thriving; But what condition in this world is long permament, how soon ^it the
pleasures of this life? being like to flowers flourishing in the morning, and
withered in the Evening: For not long after it pleased God to send agrievous
Pestilence and mortality quite thorough London, which swept away many
thousands; amongst others, Sir William Lady, his Children, and all his
Servants, leaving himself alone of his numerous family: so that being brought
now into a disconsolate condition, he uttered to himself this dolorous
complaint.

Oye immortal powers, said he, why have ye laid this heavy punishment upon me?
O why was I born unto this day, to be so suddenly deprived of that sweet
society which should make life comfortable unto me? Oh how vain is whatsoever
we hear do possess, nothing certain but uncertainty, Ounconstant world,
unstable fortune mutable prosperity: with how many changes do we turn upon the
binges of our uncertain Fate, to day flourishing full of friend and
acquaintance, tomorrow disconsolate, left alone, and deprived of all.

In this manner complained the woeful Knight, filling each corner of the house
with his sad lamentations, at last he resolved with himself, to bid adien to
the worlds vanities, and to spend the res^oue of his days in a religious
course of life; according to this Godly purpose, no sooner was the City free
from infection, but he began to put his resolutions into performance, and at
the North end of Gay-spurlane, in the parish of Alderman-bury, where formerly
was a ruined house of Nuns, he purchased the same, and built thereon an
hospital for the number of a hundred poor blind people, which for a long time
after was called Elsings spitle, and is now the same that is called Sion
College, at the end of this hospital he built a Cell, wherein he became an
Anchorite, living therein till the day of his death, which happened on the twenty
third day of May, in the year of our Lord 1340. After his death he was
canoni^ed for a Saint, and the day whereon he dyed for a long time after
celebrated by the Company of Merchant Tailors, as the twenty fifth of October is
by the Company of Cord-wayners or Shoomakers in the honor of St. Crispin and
Crispianus, but now through the continuance of long time the celebration of
this twenty third of May is discontinued.

CHAP. XIII.
How Sir John Hawkwood in releif of the Citizens of Florence, encountered with a
Sagitary Hun and overcame him, how he killed a Dragon and afterward dyed in
great love and honor in the City of Florence.
COme we next to speak of the renowned Merchant Tailor, Sir. John Hawkwood whom
we left in the Court of Pardinando King of Cilicia, of whose praise
sufficiently to speak, would wear a pen of steel to the stumps, and tire the
hand of the most industrious writer, long had he not been there after the
marriage of the Prince Arrialdo with the Lady Mariana, (as you have heard) but
he received Letters out of Italy from the State of Florence, imploring his
assistance against the Huns, a barbarous people, who had invaded their
Province, having to their Leader a certain Saggitary, who was half man and half
horse, by whose invincible strength, and swiftness of body they had over run
all the Country, and had then laid siedge to the chief City of Florence it
self. The Letters contained these words

Most renowned Knight.
Having had experience of your eminent valor, of which each Country in the
world rihgs with the fame thereof, and knowing the nobleness of your mind, ever
ready to assist those that are in distress, this spoke aloud unto us to desire
your aid against a merciless enemy, who with savage cruelty has harazed our
Country, being as monstrous in his proportion as in his actions, make haste
great Prince unto our rescue, then which no action can be attended with more
honor, and which shall be accompanied with the prayers off

Your deplorable servants the people of Florence.


Sir. John Hawkwood having received this Letter, acquainted King Fardinando
therewith, as also his resolution to hasten to their releife. The Kingthough
loath to part with his company, yet it being upon so honorable an account, most
willingly condescended, rewarding him very liverally for his noble
atcheivements, and to the rest of the Captains and Officers he gave Jewels, and
store of money, yea the meanest of the soldiers tasted liberally of his
bounty, so that every one praised him for a most honorable and renowned Prince
At the prefired day for his departure the Prince Arnaldo presented him (...) a
rich sword, the hilt whereof was all cu^io^sly enchased with diamonds of an
inestimable value; and the most beautiful Mariana gave him a rich Diamond King,
of so great price, that it was esteemed to be worth a Kings ransom. So after
many complemental expressions of acknowledgement and gratitude, the renowned
Knight took his leave marching with all the speed he could to Italy, and ceased
not till he came within the borders of Florence, where he found all things
turned toysy turvy, stately buildings converted into ruinous h^aps of ashes,
Towns lay desolate, and Villages without inhabitants, the fruitful fields
crowned with corn, and the fat pastures covered with cattle, were now destitute
of both, the harbarous foe spareing nothing which had either life in it, or
which was for the sustentation and maintenance of life. Sir John Hawkwood
marching into the City of Florence, was received by the C^tizens with great
joy, hoping now they should be able to deal with the insulting enemy, who
regardless of being encountered with, kept not themselves in an entire body, but
dispersinglylay in several companies, Sir John Hawkwood having notice of this
their careless security, resolved not to let slip so golden an opportunity,
wherefore the next morning he marched out against them, when not four miles
off, he found a party of them of about two thousand, some of which were
singing, some dancing, some brinking, but none of them prepared or siting to
fight, the English soldiers encompassing them round killed them all, leaving
not one of them alive to carry the sad tidings to the rest of their fellows how
they sped. Then marched they with their Army five miles further, where was
another company of them about four thousand more, whom they served as they did
the other; but scearcely had they so done, when the Scouts brought them word
that the main body of the Enemies was not above three (...) thence, whereupon
the noble Knight Sir, John Hawkwood drawing up his m^n upon the side of an
hill, Inh^^ he might be conveniently heard of them all, he there speak to
them, these words.

Four valors renowned soldiers and companions in Arms, have been so often
tried and approved in fights, that it may seem superfluou^ at this present for
me to say any thing to encourage you on, I shall now rather advise ye to have
a care of being too forward, that you may not be encompassed with their
numerous army, and so valor be enforced to give place to multitude, yet would
I not by this Oration take off the edge of your valor, but only to desire you
to use it ^ith discretion, and being thus forewarned let us march on, God and
good fortune be our good speed.

These words being uttered both Armies drew near to each other, the Huns as to
an assured victory by reason of their vast numbers, the English confident as
being always used to conquer. The barbarous people seeing so few opposers,
never put themselves into order, as accounting themselves sure enou^h of their
prize; but the noble Hawkwood soon made him to perceive the odds between an
Eagle an a Kite for drawing out h^s sword, he with an unres^istable courage set
upon them, giving as many wounds as blows, and as many deaths almost as wounds
(lightning courage, and thundering smart upon them as put a stop to their over
high proceedings) the other English Comma^de^s writing after the fair ^eppy
that he had set, laid about them like emaged Lions, making legs and arms go
complaning to the earth how ill their Masters had kept them, but fearing least
in long fight they should be conquered by conquering, they drew back toward
the City, but drew back in such sort that still their terror went forward,
like a valiant Mastife, whom, when his Master pulls back by the tail from the
Bear, though his pace be backward his gesture is forward. The Huns having
tasted so liberally of the English valor, were not over hasty to fellow, so
that now some space of ground being betwix them, and a c^ssation from fighting
for the present, the Sagita (...) Hun (...) ^^th between the two armies and
spoke as follows.

Proud Christians, whose desperate fortunes has emboldned you to this stout
resistance, if there he any one amongst you that dares lay a particular claim
to valor, and in whose strength you can so much confide as to vemure your
cause upon his success set him here appear before me, that we may encounter
together, and if he overcome me, we shall willingly yield to you, but if (...)
overcome by me we shall expect that you shall become servants to us.

This proud challenge who no sooner (...), but that the invicible Hawkwood
steped unto him, saying, monster (...) thy shope ten times worse then it is, or
ha^st thou the strength of Al^des, who cleansed the Augean stables, or the
might of Arlas, who is sa^d to (...) port the heaven with his back, yet would I
no fear to (...) with thee, therefore prepare thy self to receive by my sword
the just reward for all those cruelties thou have (...), and think not by sight
to escape thy deserved punishment, for now is the time come that must p^t a
period to all your bloody in humani^ies.

These words being ultered, both parties encountered each other with invincible
courage, so that in short time their armor slew in pieces, and the blood ran
abundantly down from either pa^ty, in which most cruel fight they continued
together for the space of two hours, at last Sir John Hawkwood enraged at the
valor of his adversary, and knowing it was now no time of dalliance, seeing
the Monster he in (...) faint, he so redoubled his blows, and laid on with such
invinsible courage, that at last he brought the Saggitary to the ground, who at
his fall sent forth such a hideous yell, as if Pluto's Court were broken open
or that he were a howlling out his Dirge, for the loss of his bel^v^d
Proserpine.

With this fall of their General, fell the courage of the Hunns, who
immediately betwook themselves to flight; the English par^uing them made such
slaughter of their bodies, that the earth-drunk wi^h their blood, spewed it up
in crimson streams, and the slaughter^d ca^kasses lay on such heaps, as if they
intended to make mountains of humain bodies, thirty thousand was the least that
fell in this days encounter: the rest with much fear and confusion returning to
their Country. The magnanimous Hawkwood having received this v^ctory, ^ell down
on his knees in the field where he was, returning thanks to the Almighty for
that great deliverance, not attributing ought in the have to himself, but
ascribing all to the immort^^ Deity, without whose he (...) can do nothing. And
now the soldiers being weary of Killing, the fields cleared, and no danger to
be expected from the Enem^, the renowned English with their victorious General
returned in Triumph to the City of Florence, where they were entertained in
such gallant manner that I want art to describe the same. The Bells rung
Music played, the Conduits ran Wine, the Maidens with gar^^ios on their h^ads
sang and danced in the streets, and generally there was such a rejoicing as had
^ever been seen in that City, all of them with one voice chancing forth the
praifes of the renowned Merchant Tailor Sir J. Hawkwood. Having thus in triumph
marched up to the Moot-hall or chief meeting place in a^ the City, he was by
the Recorder thereof accosted with this fellowing Ora^ion.

Most renowned Sir. to whom we must acknowledge that we owe whatsoever we are,
by whose unconquerable valor our City and Country has been wrested out of the
jaws of destruction, and preserved from utter ruin and desolation: had I as
many tongues as Bria^ius had hands, or Argus eyes, yet were all of them
insufficient to set forth your deserved praises, whose deeds have been such
that Babes unborn in time to come shall chant forth these your noble
atcheivements, vouchsafe great Sir to accept the humble thanks of this our
City; and a greateful acknowledgment of your inestimable benefits bestowed upon
us, which time shall not obliterate, but shall be preserved in brazen Statutes,
that after ages may be informed of your noble facts, and how much posterity is
indebted to your immortal memory.

This speech being ended, they presented him with a rich purse wherein was
contained five hundred pieces of Gold, then did the Trumpets sound, and the
soldiers gave such a volly of shot, as made the earth to ring with the sound
thereof; this Joy continued for the space of six weeks together, each day
affording them fresh varieties of pleasures, at last an honorable employment
summoned our noble Merchant Tailor the renowned Hawkwood to buckle on his
armor again, which was occasioned as follows.

There was at that time a mighty Dragon which hunted the borders of the
Florentines Country, doing great damage to the inhabitants thereof, so that
many sad complaints of the misehalfs that he had done were brought unto the
States of Florence, Sir John Hawkwood having knowledge thereof, would needs try
his valor against th^s enemy of mankind, and the next morning buckling one his
armor, taking only one servant along with him, being gallantly mounted they
rode on their journey, and at last came to the place where they beheld the
Dragon, as he lay sunning himself against a mossey bank The Knight espying him
alighted from his horse, which he delivered to his man, resolving to accomplish
the adventure on foot, and marching directly to the place where he lay, no
sooner did the Dragon espy him, but with full mouth he came running toward
him, and elevating himself upon his tail, sought to grasy him into his
distructive ^laws, but the Knight with a nimble turn aboided the same, and with
his sword stroke so hard upon the Dragons head, that though by reason of his
scales, which were as hard as brass, it made no entrance therein, yet it made
him to stagger, and therewithal a little to give back; the Knight herewith
encouraged, and the Dragon something dismayed, he intended to pursue his
advantage, to put a speedyer period to the combat: and seeking to thrust his
sword into the Dragons belly, where only it was penetrable, the Dragon (...) a
nimble whi^k of his tail, gave him such a blow on the back, as he supposed a
heuie ^de had fallen upon him, but recollecting himself, and taking fresh
courage, he so valiantly behaved himself, giving the Dragon so many wounds,
that the grass was stained all over with his purple gore, and now beginning to
faint for want of blood; he would have departed, which the valiant Hawkwood
perceiving, he so redoubled his blows, that at length he brought him to the
ground, where notwithstanding, what with his tallons, and what with his ta^^ he
so defended himself, that it was long ere the noble Knight could make a full
conquest of him, at length the Dragon clapping with his wings, the valian^
Knight thrust his sword under one of them up to the hilts, which p^^^ed his
very heart, and made him yield his-liveless body a trophee of the Conquerers
unmatchable prowess, By this time some of the knights of the City, who missing
his company, and imagining what he was gone about, had in the search of him,
just found him at the very instant of time when the Dragon with his fall, had
given their eyes a full assurance of the Knights victory, whom they
congratulated with all the expressions of honor and gratitude imaginable,
conducting him back to the City in solemn triumph, where he was entertained
with ringing of bells, bonestres, and such acclamasions of the people, that my
pen wants art to set it forth. This renowned Knight after the killing the
Dargon lived in great honor and splendor in this City, the space of seven
years, his fame spreading as far as Sol with his heames does enlighten the
earth, several Countries erecting Statues, to his immortal memory, and
engraving thereon to the everlasting remembrance of that famous Knight at Arms
the Renowned English Merchant Tailor Sir John Hawkwood, at last having attained
to his great Clymact^rical Year of Sixty three in the City of Florence
aforsaid, he departed thie life, to the unspeakable grief of the inhabitants of
that City, who in gratitude for his valor shown in (...) defense, erected to
his memory a most magnificent Structure, wherein was pourtrayed his conquering
the Sagitarian Tartar, his killing of the Dragon, with many other things of
most exquisite workmanship, and to this day over the chief bridge of Florence
is his Statue on Horse back in brass, with these verses underneath.

England's prime honor, Italies renown,
Who upheld all Italy from sinking down.
His friends also in England to his immortal memory, erected for him at Sible
Henningham in Essex where he was born, a curious arched Monument wherein was
pourtrayed the (...) of Hawks flying in a Wood, in reference to his name of
Hawkwood, and also built a Chauntry allowing four Priests ten pounds a pear
(such was the Religion of those times) to pray for his soul.

And thus gentle Reader have we briefly shown you the noble Achievements of
some few of the renowned Society of Merchant-Taylors, to ennumerate them all
would require more than one man's life to set them down, their number exceeding
the bounds of Arithmetic. We will end therefore all in a Corollary concerning
this Worshipful Company, their Hall, free School, and some other deeds of
Charity by some of that Society, and to I will conclude.

CHAP. XIV.
Several worthy Acts of the Merchant-Taylors.
THe renowned Company of Merchant-Taylors have been a Guild, or Fraternity time
out of mind, being called by the Name of Tailors and Linen Armorers. For I
find that King Edward the first in the twentieth eight year of his Reign
confirmed this Guild by the Name of T'aylors an (...) and also gave to the
Brethren thereof, authority every year at Midsummer to hold a feast, and to
choose unto them a Governor or Master, with Wardens: wherenpon the same year
1300 on the Feast day of the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, they chose Henry
de Ryal to be their Pilgrim, for the Master of this Mystery (as one that
traveled for the whole Company) was then so called until the eleventh year of
Richard the second; and the four Wardens were then called Purveyors of Alms
(now called Quarteridge) of the said Fraternity.

The Hall belonging to this Worshipful Company is in Thread needle street, not
far distant from the Parish Church of St. Martins Oteswtich, which sometime
pertained to a worshipful Gentleman named Edmond Crepin* he in the year of
Christ 1331. The sixth of Edward the third for a certain sumne of money to him
paid, made his grant thereof, by the name of his principal Message in the Wards
of Cornhil and Broadstreet, which Sir Oliver Inghani Knight did then hold, to
John of Yakley the Kings Pavillion maker, whereupon it was then called the
New-hall, or Tailors Inn, for a difference from their old Hall, which was
about the back side of the Red Lion in Basing lane.

The 21 of Edward the fourth, Thomas Holm alias Clarienceaux King of Arms for
the South parts of England, granted by his Pattents to this Noble Company of
Tailors and Linnen-armourers, for their Arms, to bear in a field Silver, a
Pavilion between two Mantles Imperial, purple, garnished with Gold, in a chief
azure, a holy lamb, fet within a Sun, the Crest upon the Helm, a Pavilion
purple, garnished with Gold, etc.

After this, King Henry the 7 was himself a brother of this fraternity, of
Tailors or Linnen-armourers, as diverse others of his predecessors Kings had
been, to wit Richard the third, Edward the fourth. Henry the sixth, Henry the
fifth, Henry the fourth, and Richard the second. And for that diverse of that
fraternity had (time out of mind) been great Merchants, and had frequented all
sorts of Merchandises into most parts of the world, to the honor of the Kings
Realm, and to the great profit of his Subjects, and of his progenitors, and the
men of the said mistry, (during the time aforesaid) had execrised the buying
and selling of all Wares and Merchandises, especially of woollen cloth, as
well in gross, as by Retai^ thoroughout all this Realm of England, and chiefly
within the City of London, he therefore of his especial grace, did incorporate
them into the name of the Master and wardens of the Merchant-Taylors, of the
fraternity of Saint John Baptist, in the City of London.

This Worshipful Company have a most famous Grammar School belonging unto them,
founded in the Year 1561. by the Master, Wardens and Assistans of the
Merchant-Taylors, in Suffolk-lane, in the Parish of St Lawrence Poulthey, in
Downe-gate Ward, Richand Hills sometimes Master of that Company having before
given 5001, toward the purchase of an House, called the Manor of the Rose,
sometime belonging to the Duke of Buckingham, wherein the said School is now
kept.

Now as God has from time to time blessed this worshipful Company with
abundance of wealth, so have they not been leaving to distribute the same again
in Charitable uses, having near to their Hall built seven almshouses, wherein
are placed sevea alms-men of that Company and their wives (if they have any)
each of these seven of old time had fourteen pence the week, but now of latter
time, their stipend by the said Master and Wardens has been augmented to the
sum of twenty six shillings the Quarter, which is five pound four shillings the
year to each of them, besides Coals. More to each of them twenty shillings the
Year by gift of Walter Fish, sometime Master of that Company, and Tailor to her
Majesty.

Besides this have they at the West end of Hogs-street, by Tower hill certain
fair Almshouses, strong^y builded of brick and Timber, and covered with slate,
wherein are 14 poor sole women, which receive each of them of their founders 16
pence, or better weekly, besides 8 pounds fifteen shillings yearly, paid out of
the Common Treasury of the same Corporation for fuel.

Now should we come to speak of the gifts and bounties of particular persons
free of this Worshipful Company, it would make a sufficient volumn of its self,
I shall only instance in one or two, referring the re^^ to a more convenient
place.

Robert Thorno Merchant-Taylor, who dyed in the Year, 1532. (...) by his
Testament to charitable actions more than four thousand four hundred and forty
pounds, and Legacies to his poor kindred more five thousand, one hundred, forty
two pounds besides his debts forgiven, etc.

Sir Thomas White Lord Mayor of the City of London in Anno 1554 and a Brother
likewise of the Merchant-Taylors Society, founded St. John Baptists College in
Oxford, erected Schools at Bristow, Redding, and a College at Higham Ferries,
and gave several thousands of pounds to other charitable uses.

Sir Thomas Row Knight Lord Mayor of the City of London, in 1568 a worthy
Brother also of the Merchant-Taylors Company, built the new Churchyard in
Bethelem, gave an hundred pounds to be lent to 8 poor men, and 40 pounds yearly
to maintain ten poor men for ever to be chosen out of the five several
Companies, of Clothworkers, Armourers, Carpenters, Tylars and Plaisterers.

Sir Thomas ^ffley Merchant Tailor, Mayor, who deceased Anno 1580 appointed by
his Testament the one half of all his goods, and 200 pounds deducted out of the
other half, given to his son Henry to be given and bestowed in deeds of
Charity, by his Executors, according to his confidence and trust in them.

Infinite others might we produce, whose charities and bountiful house keeping,
have been as conspicuous as the Sun in the Firmament, no Society having
produced more brighter, stars in Fames horizon, but we shall leave the further
prosecution hereof unto a second Edition of this book.

The song to be sung by the Journey-men Tailors on St. Williams day at night.
O Fall the Trade^ that ever were,
Who with the Tailors may compare,
That fits the Ladies to a hair,
And makes them fine and brave,
They on their Shop-boards sit and sing,
And live contented as a King,
Their trade such profit does them bring,
They scorn to play the knave.
The fairest Ladies in the Land,
Does to the Merchant Tailor stand,
Whilst he with parchment in his hand,
Takes measure of their bodies,
They are content to handled be,
By no one trade but only he,
But to tell all which they do see,
They are not such dull Noddies.
The Tailor he goes neatly dressed.
He eats and drinks of the best,
He takes no care, his heart^^ at rest,
But sings like to a Linnet;
A litttle matter him up sets,
He comes not in the Userers debts,
At great men's fortunes he not frets,
He knows there is danger in it.
His Shop board is his Seat of state,
On which he sits early and late,
Free from ambitions deadly hate,
Or from base envies spite,
His Thimble does his finger guard,
Whilst he does sing and work full hard,
He from content is not debarred,
His actions being right.
His Needle is the tool by which,
He in a short time does grow rich,
By sowing of full many a stitch,
In cloth and eke in stuff,
His sheeres the cloth does cut whereby,
He makes a garment handsomely,
This is the sheeres sole property,
And that is sure enough.
His Iron Goose at his desire,
Lies always roasting at the sire,
To press those seams that do aspire
And will not handsome be,
His Bodkin makes holes, whereby
Men do with points their Breeches tie,
And women lace them prittily,
A comely sight to see,
Thus does his trade him profit bring,
Being shaddowed under Fortunes wing,
And when for service of his King,
He called is to fight,
He does obey his Kings command,
Although it be to foreign land,
To fight as long as he can stand.
With all his strength and might.
In service of their King and Queen,
What soldiers brave have Tailors been,
May in the Chronicles be seen,
Which cannot be withstood,
Their acts do show they valliant were,
Their dearest blood they would not spare,
Nor for their lives at all did care,
To do their Country good.
FINIS.
