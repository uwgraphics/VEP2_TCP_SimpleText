Prologus.
IN the name of ower savior criste Jesus maker and redemour of al ma^kynd / I
Laure^s a^drewe of ye town of Calis have translated for Iohn^es does bo / row
book prenter in the cite of And warpe this p^sent volume divided in three
parts which was never before in no maternall langage prentyd till now / The
natural master Aristotell says that every body be the course of nature is
enclyned to here and se all that refressheth and quickens the spretys of man
/ wherefore I have thus in this book folowi^ge written the nature of many bestys
on earth / fowls in the air and fysshes in the water / which be wonderful
and marvelous to be herd of / and how these forsaid be natured and fourmed
which be figured at every chapter. And first of all I will speak of man
because he is most worthyest to be spoken of / for he is created and made like
unto the similitude of almighty god / and than of all things that is created
of almighty god to the behoue of mankind whereby he should be sustained and
preserved / of the which he shall answer for at the dreadful day of judgment
before our redemour the right wis Judge of all such things as he has mysused
that god of his infenyte grace has made him lord of. etc^.

Ca. Primo. of the nature of man.
THe creator that has created all thing of naught our savior and master
christ that is lord almighty has made upon the.vi. day our fore fader Adam
in the field of damasc^ of of red earth / and there he gave unto him both life
and ^owle where through he is become man and figured like unto the symylitude of
almighty god / and than made him lord of all erthly things / and gave him
grace through his glorious godhede and shaped in him such wit and sapience that
there was never erthly man that had the co^ninge that he had / And than did
Adam give unto every thing that is under heaven his perfyte name. When this was
done than did he set Adam in Paradys terrester and there caused him to sleep /
and out of his side he took a rybbe and there of he made Eua. Also god has made
ye planetes and sterres of the fire / the wyndes and fowls of ye air / ye
fysshes of the water. and man of earth / wherefore when man beholds ye things
made of the water than shall he find himself very simple / but wha^ne he
beholds yt that is made of the air tha^ shall he find himself much more
sympler / yett when he beholdith yt that god has made of the fire / tha^ is
the most symplest of al / and man shall not like himself to heavenly things
no^ accept himself better tha^ an erthly thing / for that he fyndeth and the
bestis also / and this is to be understand of ye bodi of man / which body was
first named Adam / wha^ne that our lord (...) ^ous godhed / he gave unto him
incontinent a co^uenyent and perfyte rule and law which he should hold and
keep / and this it was. That he in all thoughts / words / and works / never
should think or wisshe of any other worse in no manner of wise than he would
that of him should fortune / Than should he keep the way of rightwisnes and
egalite. When he had received this commandment of the heavenly king / he stood
up naked before the hye Lord of might sainge thus / O my lord my god that
has with thy heavenly hands made me a natural body of vile earth and knet
in methe humanite of fleshly nature with bones and senewes to go on the grownde
wherefore I beseech the lord remember that thou haste made me and give me that
life and grace that thou have ordained me to This our fader Adam was ye
comlyest / fairest and best made that ever was on grownde of all the me^bres of
his body And our lord has shed in hy^ so great abundance of graces / that no
man is to him comparable / fore he was illumyned with all the seven sciences.

He had also knowledge of all manner of erbis / their properties and virtues of
trees / of metalles / of stones / birds / bestys / fysshes / serpentis / and
of all other things on earth / and the fadere of heaven commanded all these
forna / med to be of the world brought before him to thente that he should
know them and give them their names which they keep and ever shall whylest ye
world endures. Clara^ preteres (...) xp^i incarnatione^ et passione^ solus
ass qui co^meruit. vt in suppleme^to supplementi. Herfor was Adam made lord
and governor of the world / and all thingines therein pertaining should to him
be obedient Thus was Adam infenyt / and not of the condicyon of nature / but of
the benefits of grace. For the infenytnes comes out of the tree of life /
and the body should never have dyed if it had not sinned. and when man had
sinned than was he roued from the tree of life Yet not withstandi^ge the body is
made of the four eleme^tis as before it is specifyed / and in that body
be.ij.c.xlij. bones great and small.

Of the making of man's (...)*
THe Man is Lord and ender of all things here on earth / and is also the
most perfitest and full made thing of all leuynge creatures that ever god
created as the scripture testefieth and criste blewe life into him and of a
rybbe he made him an help to the entente when they come roged through full
power that he them gave that they should engender. Exemplu^ when he said
Cresite / wax and multiply through thencreasinge of ye sede And thus he has
created man and woman because they should bring forth of their sede / which
sede is named sperma / and is a profitable part of ye fode coming after the
first disiestyon / and that sperma is appointed to fruitful vessel is to the
intent that our humanite should contynewe the longer and not end / But he that
sows tomoche of this sede / that is to understand they that occupy tomoche
with women they wex sone feeble of ly^mes / and dye within short space /
Wherefore Galienus says he that is gelded may live a long season / and men
that have but little conuersacyon with women may live longer than women / for
they be hoter of nature.

Here after follows the. te^ ages of mankind lykened be ye ten diverse bestis
as here is expressly showed / and how the nature of mankind does change from
ten year death co^me^ time of ^eth hi^ as a gose yt i^to luck ye fre^des (...)
it he in earth is (...) Sa^ctus Augustinus.
(...) upon the same that before is specifyed of the making of man in his moders
womb.
AVgustinus says of the making of man's body / when that sper^a is received
in the dew place of ye ^oders body / than is that sede formed ^efome or milk
in ye first.vi. daeys (...) in three days folowi^ge it makes ^reparacyn of the
life in form of ly^pympels or bladders. Six days ^r that it chau^geth holy
into blood ^d.xij. days after that it is turned ^o flesh. Nine days after
that / ye (...) is divided from the sholders and ^rmoste ly^mes of the body /
as ye sy^ the belly / till that it has his full ^ely shape of body and ly^mes.
within ^es afte that is seen a full pro^ body / yet the pri^cypall lymmes be
made first / as the heart / the liver and brains / and than the ly^mes that
thereto belongs / as the nauyl / ye mawe and the codes / and after that such
as be next / but last of al be hands and fete made with the other ly^mes. And
the bodij of man is made of many diverse sorts of ly^mes / as senewes / veins
/ fat / flesh and skin. And also of the four moistours / as sanguyne /
flematyke / coleryke / and melancoly. But all creatures has a sesonable time
of ye year to bring forth their fruit save only mankind which is at the least of body full made in his moders womb the.xxxv. day. and enters the
mouynges of his body upon the.lxx. day and that birthe is in the seventh
month. (...) day than the child geteth (...) the.lxxx. day / and that birth
is upon the eight month and they dye oftentimes. If the body be full made upon
the.xlv day / than receives it life upon the xc. day and is borne upon the
nynth month. But the body of mankind is commonly full made upon the.xlv. day
as before is specifyed. etc^. and that is the most connenyent time. And when
mankind is borne / than he retoureth to the earth ageyn of the which he was
before created and made.

Of the disgestion of mete whereby the body is sustained.
THe life of man is pri^cypally set in humido radicali / that is in ye radical
moistour for when man lacks yt / than must he dye / and because ye na /
turall here is also in man the which here when it fideth nothi^ge else to be
sustained of / tha^ it sustayneth him self of radycall moystour / and because
this moystour should not be febled but kept in good manner / therefore ye nature
ha / the ordained mete to be eten / and yt to be brought to disiestyon / for
wha^ it is thawed with the te^he ^ than (...) and there is ye first disiestion
and there ye is ertly divided from ye clean and ye onclene is sent down to
ye fundament and is voided through the place of purgacion / and ye clean humor
is sent to ye liver why / che is ye second disiestio^ / and there is ye watery
onclennes divided from ye clean and sent down to ye bladder and tha^ voided at
ye watery place / and ye clean is sent to ye heart and yt is the third
dysiestyon. and there is again the onclene sent or divided from the clean /
and of the onclene comes the seed sperma in ye man and the menstruum in the
women / and the clean become blod / and that is sent thorough great waynes to
all the places of the body / and that is again divided the clean from the
onclene / an the onclene gothe away through the sweet and sweet holes / and is
chaun / ged in to the nails / and such like / and the clean changes himself
into the substance of him that eteth the mete And thus is the natural
restored and strengthened if that they waste not ye radical moystour wherein
the life is laid. if the radical moystour be mynished / than it is again into
the other as before is testefyed. etc.

How that man comes into the house of death. Coleri^us.

The house of death.

Flegmaticus

Sanguineus

Melancolicus


HOw that man comes unto the house of death ye shall understand be three manner
of ways And first be the four eleme^tis whereof man is made / for the four
elementis fight togeder / and the one overcomes the other and than must man
dye. if Adam had not sinned the four elementis should never have varyed / and
Adam should have had full power to have accorded and rule them. The second /
man dies because that humidum radicale forsakes him / that is the natural
moystour. if Adam had not sinned god had set us the ire of life / and we should
have been fre of all sekenesses / and moist of nature and never dyed / but
bydden ever lusty and fresshe as a young man. The third man dies of that he
has been hurt with wepens wtin or without or with burdens lifting or bytinges of
bestis. etc. If Adam had not sinned all thing should have been to him obedient
and nothing to him contrary. and these three manners of dethes be contained in
the four co^plexcions of man / as in the sa^guyne / colerike / flematike / and
mela^coly The sanguyne waxes ofte^tymes so old through good governance / that
he must occopy spectacles and live long or hu^midu^ radicale depart from him
/ but than he dies. The colerike comes oftentimes do death be accide^tall
manner through his hastines for he is of nature hot and dry. The flematike
comes often to death thorough great excess of mete and drink or other great
labors doing / for his nature is cold and moist and can not well disiest.
And mela^coly is heavy / full of care and heaviness / whereof he engendereth much
evil blood that causes great sekenes which brings him unto death. Thus go
we al unto the house of death / the one through ensuynge of his co^plexcion /
the other through the ordenances of almighty god. The third through the
planetis and signs of the firmament.



Here after ensues the perfyte knowledge of the x. wits / and in what place
of the head that they lay / that is to understand the v. interyall wits /
and the five wits common as it stands in the figure of the head.
Mankind is shapen and ordained to enheryt ye celestial kingdom / and to be
a ruler of all erthly things / and that none ertly thing should rule him as
bestis / serpentis / worms / monsters / or such like / for they bear their
head is down toward the ground / and desire nothing but erthly things / as
mete / drink and sleep. And mankind bears his head upright toward the
heuens kingdom to the^tente that he should optayn the riches and gifts of
grace that God has ordained in him / which be his natural wits / and they
be x. in number and first there be five intery al wits as these. Fantasye
that layth before a hye in the head. Imaginacion and laith before a low in the
head. Cogitacyon layth above in the mids of the head Estimacion lays
benethe in the mids of ye head: Memoria or reme^bra^s layth behind in the
head. Even before in ye head is a little place wherout issues the five wits
common as it is expressly seen i^ the figure / and these be they. Saying in the
iyen / Smellinge in the nose / Tastinge in the tongue / Heringe in the ears /
and Felinge over all the body.

Of the dremis of mankind enclyned to ye nature of co^plexcion.
AS now the common (...) five wits vttermoste be stopped through sleep / and
than fortuneth the sleper often times to dreme of such things as he was
wakinge dilygently occupied^^ besy with in his mind / for wha^ the wits does
sleep / than ouerthynketh he the same again ofte^tymes / that he desired or
longed for when he wakened he thinks in his sleep yt he sees it or has
gotten it. The melancoly says that he has seen foul things and fer^ forms
o^ lykenesses offendes and yt fortuneth often when the body is troubled or
meued with medicynes or bathes. The colericke dremeth of fire / of water / of
manslaghter. etc. The flematike dremeth often that he sits in the water or
in the snow / o^ that he eteth honye / or such other like of moystnes which
causes oftentimes sweet flemis to fall upon their tongues. The sanguyne dremeth
often times through ouermoche influe^ce of blood that he sees spretes as the
fayres ^obyn good fellow or such like. etc. And the natural masters say yt
it is a warning or manner of to coming pain or disease named Apopleria.
wherefore it is cou^seyled to all such that they shall abstain them from to
much etynge or drynkinge / And specially to abstain them from such metes
and drinks as here be expressed / That is to understand flesh eggs and
wine / and also from all other metis that cause great influence of blood.

Many one dremeth lainge in his bed that he stands vpryght and pysseth
against a wall / as the young childeren do yt dreme of their play done be day
in the street. Sometime nature labors so sore in the sleep for to purifye ye
kydne is that the sleper dremeth of lechery and concupiscens of the flesh /
as kyssinge / helsinge / and on lawful handelynge / which is very inordinate.

The operation of mankind.
Auicenna says that fasting specyll kylleth the scorpyon / and temper camfer
with spetyll and that kylleth the itche named Impedigo if it rubbed upon it.
Spetyll dropped in the eere where as a worm is in / whether it be deed or
quick it shall bring it out. Eer sweet or eer wax is good to be laid to the
head that is pained with the migrane It is also good to be striked over cloue^
lyppes for that heleth them.

The vryne or water of mankind will hele such itches as breketh out if it be
washed therewith / and it preserves from the crepynge itche and also other
dry itches / and from al other to coming sores in the joints. Vryne drunk
with water and cicer water and honey / is good for the yelowe iawnes. The dregs
of the vryne laid to Colerica apostumacion named Heresipila it heleth it.
Diascorides.

The donge of man laid to a wou^d preserves it fro swellynge. the dou^ge
pressed and the wete of it laid to a swellynge of the throat or any other
swellynge or impostume or old sore / and it heleth it.

Of the La^me. Cap. permo.
IN the begi^nynge we have the La^me because he is the most mekest best
leuinge for it offe^deth nobody / and all that he has on him is good / ye
fles / she for to eat the skin to make partheme^t or ledder the donge for
(...) the field / the claws and horns be mede cinable / he dredeth the wolf
sore / and he knows his da^me best be her bleting though she be among many
sheep.

The Operacion.
The La^me that soucketh his da^me has his flesh very slymie and not lowable
/ and it will not be disgested principally of them that have cold stomakes
la^mes of a year old be better and lighter to digest / and they make good
blood / and specially they be good for them that be hot and dry of
complexcyon and dwell in a hot and dry land / la^mes flesh is very good
for one that is hole and lusti but for them yt be seek it is very evil though
it lightely digest and descend out of the maw / yet it is evil for other
parts of the body / for it makes slimy humors. Auice^na says that the blood
of a la^me mengyd with wine is good for the fallinge sekenes. The roncell of
the la^me heleth the bytynges of venymous bestis Albertus says that the mary
of a la^me melted with nutte oil and sugar mengid togeder and distilled in a
stilletory named an El / dren tree / and than dronken breketh the stone in the
bladder / and it is good for them that have pain in their yard coddes / and
kidneys / and also for them tha piss blood. Nota the gall of a la^me enoynted
upon a ca^cred sore / helps expressly. Also he that will help morayn among
sheep / take ve^tremariets / and sethe that with wine and me^ge it with water
and put that in the drink of the sheep / and they shall therewith sone be
helped.

Of the Ra^me or weddr Ca. iijo.
YSydorus says that the ra^me or wedder is the lodysman of other sheep / and
he is the male or man of the oye and is stronger than the other sheep / and he
is also called a wedder because of a worm that he has in his head / and when
that begi^neth for to stir than will he tucke and feght / and he fereth
naturally the thonder as other sheep does. For when a sheep is with fruit
hering the thonder she casts her fruit and brings it deed to the world.
and the wedder in the time that he be spryngeth the oye than is it in the time
of love among the sheep / and the Ra^me or wedder will feght boldly for their
wives one with another.

ysaac says that ye weder / ye bucke / and other such like bestes have each
by themself an indifferent found of their voice in calling of their wives in
ye ty / me of engendri^ge and love / and they yt drink than salt water / they
be wackened or styred to engendrynge sooner than other be before their time
coming. and when ye old wethers begin to enge^der before ye young wethers /
and that the young keep their due time yt is a good sign in that year / but
wha^ the young begin before the old that is a toke^ of tocomy^ge morayne or
death among the sheep

Esculapius says. When an oliphant sees a ram or wether / he is thereof
afraid and gothe from him

The Operacion.
The flesh of a yo^ge wether that is gelded is much better than any other
motton / for it is not so moist as other motton and it is hoter and when it
disgesteth well it makes good blood / but the flessh of an oled ra^me will not
lightely digest and that is very evil.

Auice^na says that ra^mes flessh burned and brayed to powder and strewed upon
the dry lepory named morpheus is good / and for the bytynge of a serpent or
scorpion / and mengyd with wine it is good for the bytinge of a mad dog. The
longes of a wether is good to hele the skyn that is broken on the hele when it
is laid thereto. Escul^pius says the longes soden in a pot / when they be
enough in the drawing out of the pot / that yt droppeth of the longues
he^eth the ter^ian / and pain in the kydnees. Haly says the gall of the
wether is good for the pains in the eres that comes of cold.

Of the bore. ca. iiij.
THe Bore is an angry and an on tame best and is very cursed when he companyeth
with the sow / for the wild bores when they accompany the^ with their females
than be they ever ready for to fight / and they make their skins hard / for
they ro^ne to rub they^ against the trees and than to lay in foul dirt and
mire the which they late dry on them and that makes their skins very hard
/ and both the bores be much like of co^dicions / and when they mete commonly
they will feght if they be in company of their females / so long till that the
one or both of them be slain / and the wild bore is como^ly blake and he
stiketh with his long crooked tethe as hard and sharp as it were iron. And if
the bore be hu^ted on the morninge or he have pissed / tha^ is he lightely weary
/ but if he have pyssed or he be hu^ted or while he is on hu^tinge / than will
he not lightely be ta / ken. Also though he be weary he will not lightely yield
him but sets hy^ on his hinder loins to defend him against the hu^ter /
but he shall not come be the hunter to hurt him nor to byte him till he be
first wounded himself of the hunter / and without the hunter give him a dethes
wound / without doubt he will put the hunter in ieoperdye of his life except
he be nigh to a tree that he may cly^me upon for his socour The bore hereth
better on the right side than any best.

The Operacion.
Plinius says the bores blood and brains also is good for the bits of ye
serpents / the liver dried and mengyd with rewe drunk with wine that is good
for the nivenemi^ge of serpe^tis His brain with the blood of his coddes is good
to be laid to carbu^cle sore / in the liver of the sow be little small stones
that be good to be brayde asonder and donke for the gravel and the stone / ete
the lights of the bore and it shall put from ye al dron benes / his gall
me^gyd with rosen and ceruse heleth the crepinge sores or byles the ashes of
his jaws heleth all crepinge sores His bladder with piss and al hanged in ye
smoke and dried and that putt in mete and so taken heleth ye stone in the
bladder and takes away the toto^minge pain also a little of the bladder or
vryne mengyd in drink is very medecynable for the dropecy / his dirte tempered
in warm wine is good for the flixe / his yard soupleth / warmeth / and
purifietythe li^mes that be stifened of cold or werynes / the dirte that is
warm and fresshe is very medecinable to staunche the blood at the nose.

Of the ass. ca. v.
THe ass is a rude dull best and of little understa^ding / onclne and
slothful / and he has a cross upon his back and there is he wekest / but
on his hinder parts he is strong / he has a great head and long ears and
he loves thistellis better than any other mete but he has a lothly cry / and
thoug he have gone a way oftentimes yet he ca^nat find it again / nor he will
not exchewe the way for nothing that meteth him / and he engenders with his
female when he is.xxx. months old She bears her yonges a hole year. and the
ass is cold of nature / and he can abide no cold / Therefore be not the Asses
cast in no cold lands or contrees. The ass is very sone afraid / and he
has no gall / and he eteth grass and other erbes of the ground / and the
more water that he dri^keth the better fode has he of his mete / the a^the
oftentimes a disease named (...) / and much ordour ro^neth out of his (...) /
and it fell on his lights he should dye of it.

The Operacyon.
Auicenna says the Ass has great virtue for they that sit in the water
that the ass is soden in / it heleth them of lepry the crampe or dry shro^ked
senewes / and the flessh is good for the^ to be eten / the lever roasted and
etyn in the morning fasting is good for the pule^tis his flesh li^er or
houe bre^t to ashes and men gyd with oil is good for the disease named
scrofulas / the vryne of the ass is good for ye pain in the kydnes Galienus
says the vryne of a wild ass is good for the stone in the coddes / and it
helps also meruelously well the ronnynge or crepynge sore / The milk of an
ass is good for the drying coghe and also for them that spette or spewe blood
/ the mylte of an ass brayed with clean water and laid unto a woman's breast
draws the milk unto it outwardes / the milk of an ass does swage the
great styffe belyes / and also milk of a ass taken in the mouth of one that
has weke go^mes and tethe does strengthen them very well the liver of a tame
ass eten / is good for the epulentis which is the falling sekenes / the
dounge of the ass is very medecinable to staunche the blood at the veins or
of any other wounds the water of the donge dropped in the nose thrilles /
stau^cheth the blood there Plinius says that if a ring be made of the houe or
of the bone of ye asses leg where as no black is on and that p^ (...) on the
finger of one that has the ^ge sekenes / they shall be preserved and not fall
/ Make a smoke of longues of an ass in a house and though there were never so
many serpentis adders or snakes or other venymous crepinge bestes / they should
flee as fast as they could from that place.

Of the Achame. ca. vi.
AChame is a best as great as an heart / and contrary the nature of all other
bestes he has his gall in his ear / and it is a cursed angry best.

Alches is a best that is in the forest of Hircinia and is very much like a
got / but it is somewhat bygger and it has crooked iagged horns / and they
have no joints in their legs as other bestes have / and when the hu^ters
will have that best they follow him be the footstep to know where he
rests be night / for he stands and slepeth against a tree / and they lowse
the tree be the rote and so dygge it up or ellis they saw it a sonder / for he
slepeth fast and leneth sore against the trees wherewith he is oftentimes
deceived and falls to the ground / and so they take him or ellis they should
never take him for he is to dangerous to come by / and he is to swyft in
co^nynge / but when he is down he can not ryle.

Of the anabula. ca. vij.
ANabula is a best in Ethiope and it has a neck like a man and fete like a
horse / legged like an ox / heded like a kamell / and has a goodly shinynge
skyn mixed with white spots the which conforteth the sight / and it is right
d^re sold. Aptalos is another best like a litell got very stinkinge and no
man may come nigh him / and his horns be sharp and crooked like a sicle and
^aged like a saw / and when this best has thurst he gothe to the river of
Eufrates and when it has drunk than it goth to a field where as much brosshe
and bramles be and there he plays and waloweth so long that he i^ that brusshe
is warred so that he can not arise / and than he gives a loud cry / and the
hunters he ring him come incontinent and kyl him / and his horns be so sharp
and strong that he overthrows therewith great trees to the ground. Aucinor
is a best like a young graihou^de and has better vndesta^dinge when it is
young than when it is old.

Of afferatos. ca. viij.
AFferatos be springynge and flyenge little serpents that hyde them in the
trees / and when there comes any body be those trees on the ways / than they
fly out with their venymous stinges and they be red of color and they be so
meruelously hot of nature that whosoever be hurt with them must nedis dye / for
the bytt is so venymous that it ro^neth thorugh all the body and the cure of it
is like as of the serpentt vipera. Affudius and Sabryne be ij. gray serpe^tis
and black vnd their head with white spots / and they have a slothful pase /
and their hole yt they bide in is black of their / foul venym / of their bitt
or stinge is on tempered all a man's body / for of all ye places of the body ye
blood spryngeth out the belly sweleth / the brethe shorteneth ye speech fails
/ ye lymes retcheth out and styffeneth / the memory or onderstandynge is lost /
the tethe fall out / and the person dies And this serpentis cure is like the
cura of the vipera.

Of the Amphibena Ca. ix
AMphibena is a serpent yt has a head a bouen and another at the tail / and
it goes with both the he / des togyger / and his body turned and wound like a
cable / and it takes great though for her eggis for always wha^ the one head
slepith ye other wakeneth Armena is a serpent / and his operacyon is much like
to the basiliscus For this serpent kylleth not only with his bytt or stynge but
also with his sight and eke with his bast or blowyng ^ for whosoever hereth this
serpent blow must nedys dye / and whate best that he comes by can live no
longer and it is about ye length of.iij. quarters of a yard / and for this
strong venyn is no cure nor help / but some say that there is help thereto
that should be with popy sede and castoreu^ / that is the stoues of a beuer. et^et.

Of Aspis. Ca. x.
THe Aspis is a venymous best or serpent / the which kyleth a man at the first
bit / and it is somewhat less than the serpent vipera And there be many manner
of Aspis / as Dypsa / Ypnalis Prester / and Seps. Aspis is a grene serpent and
has very long tethe like a bore / and this serpe^tis abiding is in dry
places where as there comes no water /

(...) who so is bitten of this serpent aspis change their colors and war
defe and have great cold / their head swells and their iyen swell and they wax
very slepy and to the venymous bitte or stinge of this serpent is no remedi but
make a plaster of lyme honey / and oyie. It is often taken with enchanteme^tis

/ mangines / lepry. etc^. Operatio The gal of an ox with Nitro and Ethimolea
me^gyd togeder and therewith the head washed destroys the worms in ye here.
Diascorides says / ye milk of the kowe heleth the fresshe wou^des in the

carbu^cle in the belly / the here brent takes away all flodes of blood coming
of the mother / the horns brent and made white / swageth the pains of the
go^mes. Auice^na says a gotes gal with the iuest of garleke / is good to be

it has been proved in a great lords court that there was ones a kamell
disposed to the works of nature and to her was brought one of her own yonges

the vttermoste part of ye hertis tail is venim and they that ete it or take
it in drink get a dasynge in their head and so die. The ashes of the hertis
horn tempered with vyneger eases the pain in the head if it be laid thereto.
those ashes be good also to be rubbed on tethe yt be weke for it makes them

like a saw / and it has great claws by nycht is it in ye water / and by day
is it on earth / and it has eggis gretter than a gose upon ye grownde / and
the male and female keeps it each his time / and there is no best made of so
small substance yt becomes so great and it is very gluttysshe / and wha^ it is
full it goes to the border of the water and there it lays down / and tha^
comes a bird named ye wre^ne and flyckereth so long about his mouth yt he
geteth in / and than this little bird scratcheth him i^ his throat yt it
eases him so much yt he falls therewith in sleep and when this bird
parceyueth yt this best is in sleep / it decendeth in to the belly and byteth
it so sharply through as if it were shot through with an arow for his belly is in
manner as soft as slyme / and therefore he is so hurt in the water of ye
fysshes that have hard fy^nes / and when it fyndeth a man it kills him / and
than it cries when it beholds ye man / but yet it eteth him as Plinius says
This cocodrillus eteth gladly an herb with broad leuys where as a little serpent
is hidden in which is his mortal ennemy / and this little e^pent does
wentell and turn him self in slymye grownde to begyle cocodrillus and
comes to him and slepereth through between his tethe and so desce^deth down
in to his belly and tereth a sonder all cocodryllus entrayles and his belly also
/ and this serpent has so hard aski^ne yt it is not well possible to cut it
a sonder with a sword. Plinius says That ye donge of cocodryllus is much set
by where as he hanteth of old women in yt country for they make an oyntme^t
thereof to anoint their face therewith for tha^ they seem to be young lusty
wenches as long as that ointment is fresshe.

he feleth any reyne coming out of the air than comes he out of his cave or
de^ne and fleethe in to the air and bethe^ i^ the air in such wise that it
seems to be a great tempest in ye air and his wy^ges be of a great qua^tyte
according to his body and they be facyoned like ye wings of a back ye flies
in the twy light / and where as ye dragon abides there is ye air dark and
full of venymous corrupcion.

worth for than it leseth his virtue / but they that will have ye stone
ordain her^es (...) him to eat yt he should sleep to the (...) that he should

the wiche is very precious for ye kings of Orient bear them in great honor.
The dragons flesh is grene and cold in ye operacion and coleth them sore yt
eteth of it therefore they of Ethiope eat much dragons flesh The dragons head
promises to make a house fortunable.. The tongue of the dragon and his galle
thereof made decoccio^ in wine and therewith man or woman's body enoynted is good
for ye enco^brynge of the fair and such like.

Of the Draconcopedes. cap. xlviij.
DRaconcope^es be mighty great serpentis yt have vysages fair and bright like
maidens or gentle women / and some holde^ that they be of those serpe^tis or
such like as Eua was begyled with of the devil for Beda says that ye serpent
has a maydenly visage / therefore the devil showed vn^ such a fair visage to
thentent that he the sooner should begile her and come to his purpose / and the
body of this serpent was covered with the leaves and small branches of the tree /

goi^ge for it has been proved yt it ro^neth an hundred mile upon a day Damula
is a another wild best and is also in ro^ninge very swyft / and it is like an
hynde / and it is not lyghtely to be tamed / and therefore it is not counted
fore no best of the chase.

The Operacion.
(...) ^ayth That the flesh of damula facyoned like a plaster and laid to ye
ioynctes souppleth them very well Also that flesh soden in wine and yt wine so
dronke^ is good for the fallinge sickness. The yard or membre of ye damula
and of ye heart dried and sta^ped to powder and that dro^ke^ i^ wine or other
drink is good for the poison

Of the Ydra^ cap. liij
YDra is a serpent or dragon with many hedis / and wha^ any body feghteth

THe Horse is a best yt engenders in all places of the world / and among all
colors. ye black is best. ye brown baye next / and the white third / but al
other colors be taken for worse. Aristoteles says. That ye horse and ye mare
have more desire to their engendri^g than any other bestes on earth / for it is
written that no best after that it has received ye nature of fruit will have
ado more with his male or female / save only ye woman and ye mare / and the
horse may make ye generacio^ till he be.xxxv. year old / and ye mare may bear
here fruit till she be.xl. year of age against the natuere of all other bestes
/ the horse has white tethe in his age / and he has no gall.

bront stops blood. The dry donge strewed in ye nose stancheth blood / and
it be put in ye eere it with drives ye pain. if a woman be set on a chair with a
hole and horse dou^ge vnd it taking ye air of the same delyuereth her of her
deed fruit and after birth or secondina. The blod of a stoned horse or of a mare
that has been foled eteth our evil boches or great byles. The old horse donge
or stale donge brent to ashes drives out the deed fruit or deed birth out of
the moders womb.

capitulo. lv.
THe Olyphant is a great best that lightely will be tamed and he is hu^bler
than any other best / and mekeneth himself lowlyer tha^ne any other best and
becomes subject very lyghtely / and he is commonly learned to do reuerens to
kings and noble princys / and who so hurts or greueth him that will he
remember / and revenge it in long time after / and put him in ieperdy yt
grieved him / these bestes ware wont to do good sruice in time of war for they
be so strong that they may fell down great stone walls / and they may bear a
marvelous great weight When the male will engender with the female than do they
go togeder toward the Orient parties as far as they can / And there they
find anherbe named Mandragora and thereof they ere both / but the female eteth
first / and when they have eten thereof than they come by each other and
engenders be the way of nature and wha^ she shall cast her young than gothe
she to a great water and casts it thereupon for fear of the dragon that is
her enemy and wayteth to destroy her and her young also for the which cause
the other never departs from her till she be quite of her burden / the
Olyphant lives iij.c. year. and has no joints in his legs wherefore he
ca^ne nouther bow nor knele / and he has a round foot like an apple /
wherefore when he rests him he leneth to a great strong tree and so reposeth
him and slepeth on his fete standi^ge because that his legs be so stiff and
will not bow / and the hu^ters yt will have him do mark the tree that he
rests to / and when he is gone the^s / than they get a saw and saw a sonder
and leueth it so standing / and ye next time that he comes for to rest him and
leneth to the tree / down comes ye tree and he togeder / and than he can not a
rise so incontinent he is taken

Nota It is written also that when the hu^ters come for to stryke him they be
agreed / before hand that ye one shall stryke him and the other defend him /
and have a box or other vessel and therein is red color or wine / and that he
yt is ye defendour is all bespylt or sprinked with the same as if he has shede
his blood for the ^lipha^te / and wha^ the olipha^t spyeth that ye last man
has shed his blood for him he follows him mekly and is true and obedient
unto him in all his besynes unto the death / and will not follow the other
hunter which is unto us wrec^ed ^reatures a worthy e^sample for our lernyng /
wherefore late us think in our minds that we be the Olyphantes an think in
our hertes what love this onresonable best shows unto man for his good
will yt he has redeemed hy^ / which was but a feigned matter / what ought we
sinful ^reatures to think yt the very son of god is descended from his
godhed and has taken upon him the nature of man for to feght against the
first hunter that chased us that was our mortal enemy the devil of hell.
O lord god there thou sheddest thy most precious blood for our redemp^ion and
losed us from the ba^des of everlasting dampnacion / where fore give us grace
thate we may observe and keep thy preceptis and commandementes / and that we
may humble our self to laud and thank the fore thy glorious wounds and
passion that thou suffreddest and for thy most precious blood that thou
sheddest for the redemcyon of all mankind

The Operacion
Auicenna says

If a woman sytt over a vessel with fire and that there be of the grese of the
olyphant cast therein so that the smoke stryke vpwardes to her she shall nate
conceive of child. The dong of the Olipha^t burned and the fume or smoke
thereof made to the belly of one that has the acces or ague shall help hy^.
The donge also laid in wolle vnd a woman causes that she shall not co^ceyue
of child.

iyen against a fenell st^ke and therewith she geteth bright iyen / The vryne of
a man spylt upon the bitte or sti^gne of vipera is very medecinable

The Operacion.
Diascorides says The fat of vipera tempered with cedr^a^ me^ anto / and
with old ^^ye a like much in weght helps the dark sight of man. Plinius
Vipera is good for all manner of serpe^tis bittes. and his skin that he

before contrary to all other bestes and has hands and fete to ocopye like man
or woman but his nature is with the face dounwardes and man's toward heaven /
the ape is ever going from one place to another. Plinius says that in Inde be
apes that be all white. and ye ape plaieth gladly with young chylderen / but if
he saw his time he would wory them. It has also a natural understanding and
they dwell in hye trees and they that will take the^ bring young children to
the wode where ye apes be and put shone on their fete and make the^ fast in
presens of the apes yt be on ye trees and than put the^ of and leave them there
and go a side / and tha^ comes the apes down and put on those shone and so
they be taken.

Thus is ended the first part of this present volume wherein we have treated to
the lawde and praise of almighty god of ye bestis and worms on earth with
their properties and virtues / And now I shall treat to you of the birds of
the air and of their nature and properties the which be created of our
savior christ Ihu^ whom I call to my help in all my besines that he will give
me grace to treat of this matter a right.
Of the generacyon of the birds in the air.
Daily to us is showed ye graces of almighti god whereof we ought to give lauds
and thanks to his glorious godhed for his Infenyte goodness and understanding
that he has shaped in mankind to have a parfyte and ready knowledge of all
erthly things as it is to be perceived be this present volume and second Book
where as we find written of the generation of the birds or fowls of the air
as here after ensues. Ye shall understand yt diverse Birds lay their eggs
but ones in the year / as birds that leave be (...) ^kes Go^hawkes Fawcons and
such like. Some there be that lay their eggs diverse times / and bredeth often
as downs or house he^nes / and those leave often times but a short season and
this is the cause / for the mete that they ere is most part changed or
turned into sperma or nature / and of the sperma of the he^nes be formed the
eggs / whereof the moystest part is changed to the white of the egg / and
the driest or erthy part becomes yelowe and rownde / and lays in the
mids of the egg and is the yolke. And thereto does the cock give the
semynall or ye frutfull spretes / and without the company of the cock the
eggs be on frutfull / For diverse times the he^nes does lay eggs without to
doing of any thing / or bespringinge of any he^ne or kyssinge or smelling of
any cock / or blaste of the Sothern wind / and all those be but wynd eggs
and on fruitful. And the he^ne desires not so much co^uersacion as the cock
does / and therefore is one cock sufficient among many hens Nota.

The white of the egg is moist and warm / and therein is repe^ded the
fruteful sprete of the cock through the hete when the he^ne sits on the
eggs / and it is changed on the third day or there about / For in the white
of the egg be the sharp end seems a drope of blood and thereof is made the
heart of the cheken / within x. days all the ly^mes be made and thereof is the
head gretest / And in the other x. days be the ly^mes stretched and expressly
ordained and begins to quicken and bear life through the grace of almighty
god (...) in the shell it has the head upon the right foot / and the right
wynge covers the head / But they come first into the world with the fete out
at the sharp end of the egg / And out of the long eggs come the cocks /
And out of the ronde eggs come the hens.

Ambrosius says in exameron in ye fifte book and xxij. chapter. That nature
gives to some bird sharper sight the one tha^ the other as unto the grypinge
birds / because that they a far of should se and know their mete. And they
that fle allow be the ground have darker sight / and they be nerer to their
mete / and the birds have no tethe / and therefore nature has given them
nebbes. And the grypinge fowls have crooked bylles and crooked claws to tear
the flesh a sonder. And ye water fowls have broad bylles to take the fisshes
in the water / and broad close fete for to swy^me. And they occopye their
wings to fle / and their tail to stere them where as they will be / and the
birds do never pysse / For they do drink but little / and it tourneth into
their feders / There be diverse manner of birds that be unknown and also that
be not in the memory.



Of the three parts or regions of the air.
HErause that we should show here of the birds of the air I will first write
unto you of the plases or regyons of ye air and how many regions there be
wherein they be suported. Ye shall understand that the air is divided in three
parts or regions of the air / As first the highest / the mydel most / and the
lowest. The vpermoste Region of the air is be the course and eleme^t of the
fire / and is warm of the firye elementis and the sterres / and that element
is pure like the fire / and in that highest regyon it is very still and there is
nouther wy^de nor rain as it has be proved of the^ that has been on
mountains that reched into the highest Elemente or Re / gion of the air / and
on the highest place of one of those mountains they wrote letters in the sonde
and went their way and come again at the years end and found those letters
as perfyte and full comely made as they were at the first hour yt they were
written in ye sand.

Of the second element or Region of the air.
THe mydelmoste Region is very far from the firye Regyon or element so that
it can take no hete of it And it is also to far from the earth so that it
can take no hete of the radies or sou^e beams / and it is a place full of
darkness and tempest / And also a dwell / lynge place of a part of those fendes
and evil spretis that fell with Lucifer out of the kingdom of heaven / and
there is engendered the watery impressyous as snow / rain / hayle / and such
like.

Of the third element or Region of the air.
THe lowest region or part of the air is laid be the water and be the earth /
and that part is lighted and warmed through the bright shinyng of the son^e /
and that fortuneth more ye one time than the oath according to the seasons of
the year.

Capitulo. Primo.
THe Egle is a bird with sharp talentis / yt which has a sharp sight / and
he flies of a mighti heght above the watery clouds so hye that no man can se
him / yet when he is at his most heght than sees he the fisshes i^ ye water /
and as soon as he spyeth the^ / tha^ descends he as swyft as an arowe out of
a bow and gripeth that fisshe out of the water and bringheth it upon ye
stronde / and when he is in his nest tha^ looks he in the radies or son
beams and techeth his yonges to look upon it also / And they that can^e not
look upon it / them he puts from him with great on worthiness out of the nest
/ and he keeps always one nest / and that makes he upon ye highest tree yt he can
find for fear of evil bestis / serpe^tis / and other fowls that might do
the^ harm whilste they be yo^ge and he defends the^ till they be able to
defend themself / when ye egle a far of sees the serpe^te than she
descends rashly and festeneth with his ta / le^tis and teryth it a sonder and
eteth it and also he deuydeth the poison a part and sleeth it and puts him
self in peril for his yonges. In the north parties of the world be great
Egles / and they lay almay.ij^ eggs as before is said in ye top of the highest
tree yt they can find and flees ou^ and takes an hare or a fox and bears it
to his nest and plucketh of all there here be small pieces and covers his
eggs therewith and leueth them till they burst out of their own nature / and
than ye damme comes and bredeth them up and fedeth them til their be able to
get their mete them self and when the egle is old than flies he above all
ye clouds in the hete of ye son / and there is his sight sharpened and
refresshed / and with that here flees he in a cold water / and there he
baptyseth him self.iij. times in yt water / and from thens flees he up to his
nest by his yo^ges / and than he plucketh out all his feders and his yo^ges
fetch him mete and fedeth hy^ till that he be renewed and his feders again
grown / and when the eggle has brought up her yonges that they can flee and
get their leuynge than he dryueth them away from him as far as he can /
because they should not let him of his pray or mete

The Operacion
The gall of ye egle tempered with honi heleth ye darkness of the iyen. The iyen
enoynted with the brayn or with the gal and (...) honye / gives to the iyen a /

AChatus is an on known bird and he is named to be one of ye birds of
paradyse not yt he comes from paradyse / but because that he is so fair. for
there is no color but he has a part of it and sings so swereli and so
loui^gly that he would meue any man to devotion and joy. and when he is taken
in bondage tha^ it sigheth like a man till it be again at his fre liberty. and
he dwells gladly about the water of nilus / and he is found nowhere else
There be also birds in those quarters of the quantyte of a choghe and of a
pale read color / and they be named birds of the paradyse also Aurifrigus is
a bird haui^ge one close fore / and another open with grypinge talentys / and he
co^passeth long fleing about in the air till that he se some fisshe in ye
water / than falls he suddenly down upon ye fisshe with his open foot with the
long tale^tis gripinge the fisshe right strongly / and with the other foot he
defends him from the peril of the water swi^mi^ge to the socoure of the
cloven foot.

Cap. iij.
AChantis is a little bird / and when it has yonges / it has ever.xij.
togeder and it eteth ye erbes of the ground and therefore it hates horses and
kyne yt bite and ete his mete / and this bird follows his enemies to be
revenged / Isidorus says he does thereto his best.

Cap. iiij.
ANcipiter is a goshawke / and he is of four manners. The first is this / great
of body and will be sone tamed / and has a lusty cou^tenauce with great fete
and long talentis / and it fereth not to set against no bird. The second is
smaller and has great iyen and short tale^tis / and is not lightely tamed /
the first and second year he is but little worth / but the third year he is
good and does very well and is named Alietu^. or in English a Tassell
goshawke. The third is named nisus or a sparow hawke and is yet smaller / it is
swift and sone tamed and made to the game. The fourth is the smalest of the^
and is named a musket / and they be al like. The goshawke is of that property
yt if he take a bird over night wha^ he brau^cheth himself to rest / that
keeps he in his talentis all the night / and on the morni^g he lets it fle
again / and thouhg he met with the same bird again himself having great hunger
yet of all yt day he will not touch him / and of all ye birds that he takes
he couyteth the heart.

The Operacion.
The goshawke soden in rose water is the best medetyne for all diseases of the
iyen that therwt be enoynted / Also his dounge brent to ashes and mix^ed with
(...) honey is good for the same. Esculapius says the sewet or gre^e of this
tempered with oil wtdriueth the darkness of the iyen.

Cap. v.
ARiophilon is a noble bird and it is gretter than an Egle / both strong and
swyft in flighte with pale red feders and a long tail / a crooked nebbe / and
great legs / he is most part of the time in the bryghtnes of the air / and
it is very seldom seen on the earth / and he flees so hye that no man can se
him / and he geteth his mete in the air / a bird that he meteth in in the
air escapes not lyghtely his claws / and when this bird is young sometime he
is taken and tamed to the game as an hawke. This bird takes kyddes and fawnes
of hertes and tereth them a sonder with his claws and commonly they flee two
togeder and what they get they part it between them gentilly for it is
gentle of kind.

ALauda the lark is a little bird and with every man well be known through his
song / in ye somer yt begy^neth to singe in the dawning of ye day geuynge
knowledge to the people of ye cominge of the day and in fair weder he
reioyseth sore / but wha^ it is rain weder than it sings seldom / he sings
not sittinge on the grownde nouther / but when he assendith upward he syngeth
mereli / and in the descending it falls to the grownde like a stone.

The Operacion.
The larkes flesh hardens the beli and the brothe of him that he was so /
den in slaketh the beli

Agochiles is a great bird in ye orient parties / and they milk ye gotes /
fore they flee gladly be the ground where ye gotes go a grasynge / and they have
bro / de bills and therwyth they suck the demes of the gotes / and aft that
they give no more milk / and this bird lays.ij. or.iij. eggis. and Plinius
says yt the gotes become blind of the sucking of this bird / and so this best
is destroyed

Cap. vij.
ALietus is a sybbe to the egle and causes his yonges to look in the son /
and they that can not look in ye son he casts them out of the neste. and
when he is on hye in the air he has so sharp a sight that he sees a fisshe
in the water and than he descends hastily and gripeth it / and so does he
other birds in the air and thereof heueth

Cap. viij.
AMbrosius says that alcion is a bird of the sea and layth his eggs on the sea stronde and in ye mids of the winter wha^ the waves stryke most
perillously / than flees he to his eggis and sits upon them / and by and by
ye see waxes smothe / and he fitteth vij. days on his eggis and in that space
be his eggis hatched and tha^ he fedeth them in other vij. days / and as long
as he hatcheth or fedeth his birds / so long is the sea smothe and well
te^pered in those parties and the ships sail to and fro without any danger /
and this bird only bredeth in the wynt and so does none other bird* and his
neste can not be hewed a sond with a sword nor pron / but it may be broken a
sonder

Cap. ix.
ANas the ducke. ye male or malarde of the ducke has a head and neck grene
and a broad bille / the wy^ges of different colors as white grene and black.
and he has a white ring about his neck / this bird can not live well
without water / and specially when they have eten any dry mere. and when there
be many malardes and but one ducke than they kill the ducke through their
operacion of nature / for they spring up upon the ducke one after another /
and her ionges be so quick yt as soon as they come out of their shelles that
though the da^me were deed they should help the^ self well enough

The Operacion.
Plinius. The blood of the malarde is good for to stau^che the flixe. The ducke
makes a clear voice and causes man to lay gladdly in the arms and gives hy^
the sede of nature / and the sewet is of it very good to souple all manner of
pay / nes in the bodi of man.

Cap. x.
THe Goose is a bird as great as an egle and the wild gese flee like as the
cranes does all in order / and like as the wind blows so they flee

Cap. xi.
ARdeolais a bird that flees very strongly and when it flees hye in the air
that betokens foul tempestyous weder / when these birds shall engender than
cries the he for theshe till the blood stert out of his iyen / and some say
that they have but one iye. Ardea is a bird that fetches his mete in ye water
and yet he byldeth upon the highest trees that he can. This bird defends his
yonges from ye goshawke castinge his dou^ge upon him / and tha^ the fedders of
the goshawke rote of ye dounge of ardea as far as it touchet Azalon is a litell
bird that breketh ye eggs of ye raue^ / and the fox will always take the
yonges of this bird / wha^ ye raue^ espyeth this he helps ye fox as

And the bees have each a different operacion / and their operacion has no
certentye / some souke the flores / some gader the dew / of this they make
honey and wax wherewith is served both god and man / and they be ever ready to
work in season of the year when it is fair weder

BAsiliscus is to vndstande as a king of serpentis / for all other serpe^tes
fle from him / for with his brethe he sleeth them / also if he se man or woman
he sleeth them with his fight / there may no bird pass by him they must nedys
dye. Auice^na says yt he sleeth with his cry as well as with his sight and he
says that he cries and he has a crooked byll like a cock / and he is.ij.
shafmo^tes long with a sharp head and read iye^ and where it comes it
bre^neth all ye grass up save only about his hole or den there it is not
bront. Some say yt he comes of a cocks egg for when a cock becomes old
than he lays an egg without any shale but it has a skine that is very
toughe / but this egg must lay in warm dou^ge for there it should lay warm
/ and than belenght of time there should come a cheken of it and that should
have a tail like an adder / and that other part of the body like the cock
Some say that a serpent or ^ode bredeth out this egg but thereof is no
certentye but it is red in old books that it comes of a cockis egg. This
serpent is ouerco^men by ye wesell which is a litell best. yet ye basiliscus
ronneth away from hy^ and the wesell persecuteth hy^ to death and sleeth him.

Cap. xiiij.
BArliata is a bird that grows out of ye wode / and some say that it is wode
of abieta that stands upon the sea stronde the which falls often times in
the water and that roteth / and yt rote^ wode gives a gross humor of the
which comes a little bird as much as a lark / and they ha^ge with the
nebbe on the wode / and they flete thorough the sea so long till that they
fall of. Philozophus says that it is well known in Germania that this bird
comes without any generacio^ yet he flees as other birds does

fulle flight. he takes his mete on the earth for.v. or.vi. of them togeder be
so bold that they festen on a sheep and tere hy^ asonder and so ete the flesh
of him / and this bird does ete also of deed bestes and stinkyn caryon and it
eteth also grass and grene erbes / and it layth his eggis upon the ground and
bredeth the^ out the while that ye corn grows on the field. Sonosa is a
bird i^ germania and has black flessh without / but wtin it is very white and
very sweet / and the male and female of those birds engend in this manner the
male comes ro^ninge with an open mouth therein having spetyll and than comes
ye female and receives the same and than she layth eggis and bry^geth forth
young birds

Cap. xvi.
BVbo is an Owl dwelling in ye churches and he drinks out the oil of ye

the owl at myd none / and the owl eteth his eggs at myd night / and this
bird is hated of all other birds

The Operacion.
Auicenna. The blood of an owl is good for the disease named asmatike and so
is his flesh and the brothe that it is soden in. The heart of him laid at ye
