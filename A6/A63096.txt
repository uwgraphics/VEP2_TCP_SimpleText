Treason Unmasqued, OR Truth brought to Light, TO A PLEASANT NEW TUNE, etc.
When Loyalty depressed lay,
And the dark Night took place of Day;
When deep Caballs, took place of State
And Statesmen sought to ruin State,
Then England's Genious, did disclose
Where Treason lurked, and showed it is Foes.
NOw at last the Riddle is Expounded,
Which so long the Nation has Confounded,
For the Roundhead;
Begins the Game again,
Which so well, they played in Forty Four
And in greater hope:
That the Damned Sham-PLOT, will never be over
Till Piously they routed King and Pope.
Shaftsbury, that Worm of Reformation
Who for Commonwealth has laid Foundation;
Which the Nation,
So hotly do pursue:
Is justly now rewarded in the Tower,
For his Merrits due,
But when his busy head, is once laid lower
Then will appear the Plots he did pursue.
Perkin, makes fine Legs toth' shouting Rabble,
Who to make him King, he thinks are Able
But the Bauble,
Is only chose for Use;
The silly Idiot, serves but for a Tool still
For Knaves to work their Feats:
And remains a dull inciped Fool still,
For all their Damned Caballs, and Wapping Treats.
The most zealous Parliament Denoted,
Who for public good Devoutly Voted,
Pray note it,
That the Duke shall never be King;
And like Faithful honest Loyal Subjects,
His Majesty Implore:
To Sign their Godly and Religious projects,
Or else the threatened King shall Reign no more.
FINIS.
