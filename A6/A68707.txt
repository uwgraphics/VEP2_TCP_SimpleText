A LARGE DECLARATION CONCERNING THE LATE TUMULTS IN SCOTLAND, FROM Their first
originalls: TOGETHER WITH A PARTICULAR DEDUCTION Of the seditious Practices of
the prime Leaders of the Covenanters: COLLECTED OUT OF THEIR OWN foul Acts
and Writings: By which it does plainly appear, that Religion was only
pretended by those Leaders, but nothing less intended by them. By the King.

LONDON, Printed by ROBERT YOUNG, His Majesty's Printer for Scotland, Anno Dom.
M.DC.XXXIX.

By the King.
THough by Our many Proclamations and Declarations, some whereof are printed,
and others were made by word of mouth* by Our high Commissioner the Lord
Marquess of Hamiltoun, during the time of his late employment in Scotland; it
does fully appear to all men, whose minds are not distasted with Justice and
Government, what Our religious care, Princely clemency, and unparalleled
patience have been for the settling of the late troubles in that Our ancient and
native Kingdom of Scotland, and for the composing of that State, so much of
late discomposed and disjointed by the seditious practices of diverse impatient
of all laws and government: Yet for the further and full satisfaction of all
our true hearted and loyal subjects in all Our Kingdoms, and for the
manifestation of Our Justice and Piety in Our late proceedings to all abroad,
especially to those who with Us adhere to the Religion Reformed: We have
thought good by way of an Historical Deduction to set down the true passages
of all this business, that the world may, as it were under one view and
aspect, behold Our gracious and clement comportment toward Our subjects of
that Kingdom, and the depraved and froward deportment of many of them toward
Us their liege Lord and Sovereign: Not doubting, but that whosoever shall go
along by the thread of this Our unquestionable Narration, will rest fully
satisfied in these three points.



to make good to all Our subjects of that Our Kingdom: As holding it beneath
the greatness and goodness of a just King, that the unjust actions of his
subjects should occasion in their Sovereign the least suspicion of breach of
promises made by him to them, especially when the performance of them shall
conduce to the settling of Religion and Peace.

Becanus, Scippius, and Eudaemon Johannes, their poor Arguments, which they
have delivered in their seditious Pamphlets printed or written, are taken
almost verbatim out of Bellarmine and Suarez, as appears to Us by Our Royal
Father his Monitorie Preface to all Christian Kings and Princes, and his
Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, and in the Books writ by others in
defense of them both; in all which these arguments are fully answered: And that
the means which they have used to induce a credit of their conclusions with
their Proselytes, are purely and merely Jesuiticall fables, false reports,
false prophesies, pretended inspirations and divinations of the weaker sex; as
if now Herod and Pilate were once again reconciled for the ruin of Christ,
and his true Religion and Worship.

Now, if these three particulars by this historical Relation shall undoubtedly
appear to the unprejudicate Readers, whether Our Subjects or Forreiners, then
We shall little doubt to gain from them their assent to these Our two just
desires.

this special favor (for no less We account it) of being the chief Prince
whom he has made choice of for the Protector and Defender of it: Though, We
say, these men have done what they can to weaken this our Religion, by striking
at the authority of the principal prop and stay of it upon earth under God;
yet We, by the grace of God, are fully resolved to wipe away that aspersion,
and remove that scandal from Our Profession and Religion, by Our constant not
only adherence to it, but maintenance and defense of it, with the uttermost of
that power which God has put in Our hands, notwithstanding all those scandals
which these men by their wicked practices and worse positions have laid upon it.



THat Religion is only pretended and used by them as a cloak to palliate their
intended Rebellion, is demonstrative by this, That the seeds of this Sedition
were sown by the plotters of their Covenant, made under the pretense of
Religion, long before any of the grievances or pretended innovations in
Religion complained of by them, were ever heard of amongst them.

For the truth is, that some years after Our coming to the Crown, by the
advice both of some of Our principal Counselors and Officers of State there,
as also by the advice of Our learnedest Advocates and Counselors at law,
according to the example of many of Our Royal Progenitors of happy memory,
Kings and Queens of that Our Kingdom, We did make a legal revocation of such
things as had been passed away in prejudice of the Crown, especially by some
of Our late Royal Progenitors in their minorities; a course warranted by the
laws and many years practice of that Our Kingdom: With this course, some of
the principal contrivers of this their present Covenant found themselves much
aggrieved, and much of their estates brought within the compass and danger of
Our laws, which made them presently begin to grumble and repine, and
privately, as much as they durst, and as in them lay, to work underhand in Our
subjects minds a distaste of Our government: Which We made account We had
quickly rectified, by showing to all Our subjects interessed in that
Revocation, Our gracious clemency in waiving all the advantages which Our
laws gave Us in many of their estates: So that after We had made it apparent
to Our subjects, how obnoxious many of them and their estates were unto Us and
Our laws, We likewise did make as apparent unto them, Our singular grace and
goodness by remitting not only the rigor, but even the equity of Our laws;
insomuch that none of all Our subjects could then, or can now say that they
were damnified in their persons or estates by that our Revocation, or any thing
which ensued upon it: Yet for all this, the principal present malcontents did
then begin to persuade with such as they thought they might be boldest with, a
disaffection to Our government: And not seeing how they could easily obtrude
upon them, the old and usual pretense of discontent, viz. Religion, by a
strained and farre-fetched inference they did not stick to lay the envy of
the procuring that harmless Revocation, by which no man suffered, upon the
present Prelates, who in this were as innocent as the thing it self was: Only
because they hoped that the very name of Churchmen or Religious persons,
should in the point of faction have that operation with their followers, which
they conceived the Church or Religion it self might have had, if they could
have seen how to have persuaded them, that by this Revocation either of them
had been endangered.

stipendiarie benevolence, or else some mean allowance from these Lords of
Erections or Laick Patrons, unworthie of the Ministers of the Gospel, and which
exposed them to all manner of contempt and a base dependence upon their
Patrons: We, at the instance and humble petition not of a few, but of the
whole Clergy, and with them, of the whole payers of tithes of that Kingdom,
begun to take three things into Our serious consideration.

First, the wretched estate of the Clergy for want of maintenance: Next, the
hard usage and great oppression of all the Laity that paid tithes, from the
owners of them: Thirdly, a very important point of State, vizt. That it was not
fit, that such a considerable part of Our subjects, as all the Ministers who
have power over the consciences of the rest, and all the payers of tithes who
are the far greatest part of the Kingdom, should have their dependence upon
the Nobility or other Laicke Patrons, the one for their livelihood and
maintenance, the other not only for fear of having their corns lost or
endangered for not carrying them in due season, which was by the law in the
power of these owners of the tithes, which power they were sure they would
exercise upon them if they should at any time displease them, or not adhere to
them upon all occasions good or bad; But likewise because these Lords, owners
of the tithes and also of Abbey lands, were likewise for the most part
superiors to those who paid them, but were so altogether to those who held
the Abbey lands of them by way of vassalidge, and so by their very tenures
were to perform all service and attendance to these Lords, their superiors,
whenever they should require it of them.

Which important considerations moved Us, by the advice of the learnedest
Lawyers there, to grant out a Commission under Our great Seal for that
Kingdom, not to a few, but to diverse hundreds, and those of the prime of all
estates and degrees, (out of which number the Lords of the Erections and Laicke
Patrons were not omitted) for relieving, if they should see cause, both the
Ministers and owners of Corn, as also for taking into their consideration the
point of superiority and dependence. These Commissioners, after their sitting
in great frequencie some years, and after full hearing of all parties
interessed, and mature deliberation, did set a rate of the value of the tithes,
ordered that the owners of the grounds should severally purchase them at so
many years purchase, as was then agreed upon by all both buyers and sellers,
taking the same course for the rating of superiorities in regard of the Abbey
lands, which was likewise accorded unto by all parties; and ordered that every
Ministers means should be augmented, in such a certain proportion set down and
accorded unto, as the Incumbent should not be enforced any more to be a slave
to his Patron.

With the conclusions and determinations of this Commission, called the
Commission of Surrenders of Superiorities and Tithes, the owners of lands and
the Ministers were indeed so really satisfied, that the former with all
thankfulness acknowledged Us for their deliverer from an intolerable bondage,
under which they and their Ancestors ever since the reformation of Religion had
grievously groaned; The latter with infinite expressions of joy and gratitude
did celebrate Us as the very father and founder of their several Churches: We
gave Our Royal assent to all agreed upon in that Commission* being glad that
Our subjects were relieved, the maintenance of Our Clergy improved, and both
Our Clergy and Laity freed from a dangerous dependence upon subjects, and for
that freedom obliged to a thankful, hearty, and loyal dependence upon Us,
to whom alone by all laws of God and men it is due. The Nobility and other
Lay Patrons seemed herewith likewise fully to rest satisfied; and so indeed
they were in point of profit, for, according to the rates of purchasing in that
Our Kingdom, for their tithes they were satisfied to the uttermost farthing:
But they fretted privately amongst themselves, for being robbed, as they
conceived, of the clientele and dependence of the Clergy and Laity, and of
that power, command, and superiority over them, which by that tie of tithes
they had enjoyed: Yet, not being able to make Religion it self a fair
pretense for this their discontent (for who could imagine that every man his
gathering of his own tithes, or the augmentation of Ministers maintenance,
could be an affronting or weakening of Religion?) they had recourse to their
former fetch, and not without bewraying much heart-burning, gave it out, that
this Commission (which indeed was obtained by the humble importunity both of
Clergy and Laity) was procured only by the Bishops, who meant no good to
Religion; and so from an unnecessarie jealousy of their persons and power,
they begun to pretend and suborne a necessary jealousy of Religion it self.



But We readily confuted all these suspicious surmises; for, except an Act
which gave Us power to appoint such vestures for Churchmen which We should hold
to be most decent, nothing concerning Religion was either propounded or passed
in that Parliament, but that which every King does usually in that, and all
other Christian Kingdoms, pass at their first Parliament, viz. An Act of
ratification of all other Acts heretofore made, and then standing in force
concerning the Religion presently professed and established, and concerning the
Church her liberties and privileges: Which Act being an Act of course, though
it passed by most voices, yet was it disassented from, to Our great admiration,
by the voices of many of those who are now the principal pillars of their
Covenant; which made all men then begin to suspect, that sure there was some
great distemper of heat at the heart, when it boiled so over at their lips, by
their unnecessarie and unprofitable denying of assent to the laws, concerning
the Religion and Church, already established; This first Act passing more for
form and the honor of Religion, then for any use or necessity of it, all the
former Laws still standing in force and vigor without the need of any new
ratification.

At this time many of Our subjects of greatest quality were suitors to Us for
new Titles of Honor, Gentlemen to be Lords, Lords to be Earls: Impossible
it was for Us to satisfy all suitors in that kind, without the prostitution
of Honor to a just and open contempt; and therefore being put upon a choice
and selection, We held it fitter in the point both of honor and justice, to
pass by such as both privately in their secret meetings, and openly in the
Parliament house, had showed their disrepects to Us and Our just proceedings,
then those who had carried themselves not only loyally and dutifully, but
affectionately and heartily to Us and Our service. Upon this occasion many of
those who were then passed by, and are now principal Covenanters, seeing
others advanced to degrees of honor above themselves, begun then presently to
mutter, but not to mutiny until We were gone from thence.

But scarsly were We well returned into England, when the discontent of these
men resolved it self into a plain sedition: For then they had the impudence
to give it out, that voices were bought and packed in the late Parliament; nay,
that the voices were not truly numbered, but that some Acts were past without
plurality of suffrages: A calumny so foul and black, as that they
themselves did know it to be most false: For had there been the least
suspicion of truth in it, they might have made trial thereof, by surveying
their own papers, and the papers of many hundreds present, who took notes of
the number of voices which were given, either by assenting to, or disassenting
from the several Acts read and proposed; by which papers if they had found but
the weakest ground for this their strong, but false report, We have no reason
to think that either their mercy or modesty was such, that they would have
forborne the calling of the Clerk of Our Register in question for it; it being
as our Chancellors office to ask the voices, so Our Clerk of Registers office
to take them and record them, and according to his own and his Clerks notes
who assist him, to pronounce the Act passed or stopped: In which it is impossible
he should deal but with sincerity, for else the notes taken by most of the
Auditors, being a present and powerful conviction of his false dealing, must
presently transmit him to highest Censure and punishment.

But knowing that in a public and judicial way they must needs fail in their
proof of this calumny, they betook themselves to the secret and seditious way
of malcontents: For first they used clancularie surmises, then they sent about
from hand to hand a clandestine infamous Libell, and by it they impoysoned the
hearts of many of Our good subjects with a suspicion of obliquitie in Our
proceedings at the late Parliament: This infamous Libell coming to the
knowledge of Our Privy Council there, first they of themselves, then
afterward, having made Us acquainted with it, by Our commandment entered into
an inquiry both of the authors and abetters of that seditious Libell; Who
found that the author upon whom it was shifted and fathered, was one Hagge,
then, and still fugitive, but that the abetters, countenancers, and dispersers
of it were many, and some of them of greatest quality, and now principal
Covenanters: We, out of our innate and usual clemency, were graciously
pleased (that the fear and example might reach to all, but the punishment
only to one of them) to pass by many, who undoubtedly had been concluded and
involved by Our Laws in the same sentence, if We had proceeded against them,
and to single out one of that rank, who was most obliged to Us and Our Crown,
and therefore both for his ingratitude and crime, had no reason to expect any
thing from Us but the justice of Our laws.

This one was the Lord Balmerino, his Father was principal Secretary of State
for that Our Kingdom, to Our Father of happy memory, to whom he was beholden
both for the honor of his Baronie, and for his whole fortune and estate which
he got in his service: But he was since Our Royal Father his coming to the
Crown of England, arraigned for, and attainted of high Treason in Scotland,
found guilty of it by his Peers, and accordingly received sentence to be
hanged drawn and quartered, his blood tainted, his whole estate forfeited to
the Crown: Yet such was the gracious clemency of Our Royal Father, that He,
only for a little time, continued this condemned and forfeited Lord in prison,
afterward confined him, but to a large circuit, and then restored not only the
blood of himself and his children, but also their honor and whole estate: Now
this present Lord Balmerino, being so extraordinarily obliged to Our Royal
Father and Our Crown, for the life of his father, his own honor and whole
fortunes, and so being one from whom We, the son of that Royal and Gracious
Father to him and his whole family, had no reason to expect perfidiousnesse and
ingratitude, he could not have the least show of reason to expect any favor
from Us, but the favor of a fair and legal trial, which We granted him: At
that trial and arraignment, he was by his Peers found guilty of abetting and
dispersing that infamous Libell made against Us, and accordingly was to receive
sentence of death for it; which Our chief Justice respited only until Our
pleasure might be known: Then indeed they who afterward proved the
contrivers of the late Covenant, and their adherents, begun to complain of the
hard measure which was offered to this Lord, and to lay false and wicked
aspersions upon his Peers who found him guilty; but finding that all the
proceedings were usual and legal, they could not but have acquit the Judge if
he should have condemned him, nor could they have found the least blemish in
Our justice, if We should have given warrant both for his sentence and
execution, whose life was now legally devolved into Our hands; and therefore
this convicted Lord betook himself only to Our mercy, which We showed to him
in that height as We are confident it is hardly to be patterned by any
president.

For notwithstanding the head of this family which was first raised by Our
Father, and then being fallen, yet raised by Him again, and now relapsed, was
once again brought under Our axe, as it had been before brought under the axe
of Our Royal Father: We, desirous to show Our self the true heir of none of
Our blessed Fathers virtues, more then of his mercy and clemency, were
contented upon his deep protestations of loyalty for the time to come, to
grant him under Our great Seal for that Our Kingdom, not only a Pardon of
that crime of which he stood convicted, but also his full liberty and
enlargement: Which gracious Pardon of Ours, when it was delivered to him by Our
Council, who sent for him being then prisoner in the Castle of Edinburgh, he
did before that Table receive on his knees, with the highest magnifying of Our
mercy, with the humblest acknowledgments of those infinite obligations by
which he and his family stood for ever engaged in the service of Us and Our
Crown, with the deepest protestations of all loyal, quiet, and peaceable
deportment of himself ever hereafter, and of bending all his endeavors to
attend upon all Our Royal courses and commandments, so that Our Council
remonstrated unto Us, that We had bestowed Our mercy and grace upon a man, of
whom there could not be the least suspicion of his averseness from Our service
at any time hereafter, but of whom they might safely promise all forwardness
and alacrity in all Our just courses, whenever it should please Us to use
him: And now this same pardoned Lord Balmerino, being one of the chief
contrivers, and most malicious prosecutors of this wicked Covenant made against
Us and Our authority, how he can be able to answer it to God, Us, and Our
Crown, his own conscience, or to the world, even in the point of honor and
reputation, it must be left to the world to judge.

By this now which has been said, We suppose it is plain that before either
the Service Book, or Book of Canons, so tragically now exclaimed against, were
thought on, the seeds of sedition and discontent were sown by the contrivers
of the late Covenant, first upon the occasion of our Revocation, next upon
occasion of Our Commission of Surrenders, and lastly upon the occasion of Our
denying Honors to some of them at Our last being in that Kingdom, which
caused first their traducing of Our proceedings in our last Parliament held
there, and then produced that infamous Libell.

And now by this time sedition was grown so ripe, and ready to seed, that it
wanted nothing to thrust it out, and make it shoot forth into an open
Rebellion, but some fair and specious pretense: They could not yet compass
the cloak of Religion, whereby to siele the eyes, and muffle the face of the
multitude, for by none of all the three former occasions could they so much as
pretend that Religion was endangered or impeached: But so soon as they got but
the least hint of any thing, which they thought might admit a misconstruction
that way, they lost no time, but took Occasion by the forelock, knowing that
either that, or nothing would first facilitate, and then perfect their
designs: Now the occasion they took of fetching Religion within the reach of
their pretenses, was this.

Our Father of blessed memory immediately after his coming into England,
comparing the decency and uniformitie of Gods worship here, especially in the
Liturgy of the Church, with that diversity, nay deformity which was used in
Scotland, where no set or public form of prayer was used, but Preachers or
Readers and ignorant Schoolmasters prayed in the Church, sometimes so
ignorantly as it was a shame to all Religion to have the Majesty of God so
barbarously spoken unto, sometimes so seditiously that their prayers were
plain Libels, girding at Soveraigntie and Authority; or Lies, being stuffed
with all the false reports in the Kingdom: He did immediately, as became a
Religious Prince, bethink himself seriously how His first reformation in that
Kingdom might begin at the public worship of God, which He most truly
conceived could never be happily effected, until such time as there should be
an unity and uniformitie in the public Prayers, Liturgy, and Service of the
Church, established throughout the whole Kingdom. Concerning this His Royal
and Religious design, diverse consultations, for many years, were had with the
Bishops and others of the Clergy of most eminent note in that Kingdom.

But these deliberations (as it happens many times in business of so pious
and ponderous importance) received some opposition, and many intermissions,
until the year 1616. in a General Assembly (which is answerable to the
Convocation of the Clergy here in England) held at Aberdene in August, Our
Royal Father by His Letters, and the vehement instance of His Commissioners
then and there present, easily made apparent to that whole Assembly, not only
the conveniencie, but indeed the necessity of a public Liturgy to be settled
throughout the whole Land: Which moved that Assembly to pass an Act, whereby
they authorized some of the present Bishops, and diverse others, to compile and
frame a public form of Liturgy, or Book of Common Prayer, which should
first be presented to Our Royal Father, and after His approbation should be
universally received throughout the Kingdom. This Book in pursuance of that
Act of Assembly, being by those who were deputed for that purpose framed, was
by the Lord Archbishop of Saint Andrews that now lives, sent up to Our Royal
Father, who not only carefully and punctually perused every particular
passage of it himself, but had it also considerately advised with, and revised
by some of that Kingdom here in England, in whose judgment He reposed
singular trust and confidence; and after all His own and their observations,
additions, expunctions, mutations, accommodations, He sent it back to those
from whom He had received it, to be commended to that whole Church, being a
Service Book in substance, frame, and composure, much about one with this
very Service Book which We of late commended to them, and which undoubtedly
then had been received in that Church, if it had not pleased Almighty God,
that while these things were in doing, and before they could receive their much
wished and desired period and consummation, to the invaluable loss, as of the
whole Church of God, so particularly of that Church of Scotland, to translate
Our blessed Father from His temporal Kingdoms to that which is eternal.

We, by the grace of God, succeeding to Our royal Father, were desirous to
make it known to the world, that We did not hold it a greater honor to
succeed Him in His Crowns, then to be His Successor in His Princely virtues,
and especially in that in which He was most eminent, His singular piety and
religious care of the public service of God; which finding here in this
Kingdom of England, by His singular wisdom and vigilancie, settled even to
the admiration if not envy of all other Churches, We resolved by the grace of
God to pursue that His Pious and Princely design, for settling a public
Liturgy in that Our Kingdom of Scotland, it having been so happily
achieved, facilitated, and almost perfected by Him: To which purpose We caused
the same Service Book, transmitted by Him to that Church, to be remitted and
sent back to Us, that after Our perusal and alterations, if any should be
found, either necessary, or convenient, it might likewise receive Our Royal
authority and approbation: We having received that Book, and after many
serious consultations had with diverse of Our Bishops and Clergy of that
Kingdom then here present with Us, and after Our advices by Our Letters and
Instructions to the rest at home, and after many humble advertisements and
remonstrances made from them to Us of the reasons of some alterations, which
they did conceive would remove diverse difficulties, which otherwise they feared
this Book would encounter with; We were contented that the Service Book
should come out as now it is printed, being fully liked by them, and signed
with their hands, and perused, approved, and published by Our Royal command
and authority.

In the perusal and approbation whereof, We took special care, that the
small alterations of it in which it differs from the English Service Book
should be such, as We had reason to think would best comply with the minds
and dispositions of Our subjects of that Kingdom: For We supposing that they
might have taken some offense, if We should have tendered them the English
Service Book totidem verbis, and that some factious spirits would have
endeavored to have misconstrued it as a badge of dependence of that Church upon
this of England, which We had put upon them to the prejudice of their Laws
and Liberties; We held it fitter that a new Book should be composed by their
own Bishops, in substance not differing from this of England, that so the Roman
party might not upbraid Us with any weighty or material differences in Our
Liturgies, and yet in some few insensible alterations differing from it, that
it might truly and justly be reputed a Book of that Churches own composing,
and established by Our Royal Authority, as King of Scotland: And thus
conceiving We had discharged the duty of a religious King toward God, and
of a gracious Prince in accommodating this Book so, that Our subjects of that
Kingdom should have no cause to have the least suspicion of any intended
dependancie of that Church upon this, We sent home the Book to the Lords of
Our Privy Council: After their receipt and consideration of it, We, by their
advice, and they, by Our Authority, commanded by public Proclamation that the
said Book should be publicly read and received in all the Churches of that Our
Kingdom, and should begin to be practiced upon Easter next, 1637.

Disobedience to this Our Proclamation We had little reason to expect, because
this Service Book was no new thing unto them: For it not differing from the
English Service Book in any material point, and We supposing that the English
Liturgy neither was nor could be displeasing to them, did likewise conceive
that this Book should be as little disliked by them: Now the reasons inducing
Us to a belief of their not misliking the English Liturgy, were these.



not only without dislike, but with frequent Assemblies of Our Council,
Nobility, Bishops, and other Clergy of all sorts, Judges, Gentry, Burgesses,
women of all ranks: The Bishops or some of them never gave Orders (which they
did frequently) but they used the English Service Book, and in some Cathedral
Churches of that kingdom, as also in the new College of the University of S.
Andrews, for some years of late it was publicly read without any distaste,
much less disturbance; for diverse years it was used in many families, and at
Our last being in that Kingdom it was read publicly in all Churches to which
We resorted, in which great numbers of all sorts of people were present: All
which gave Us good reason to conceive, that the commanding of this Book by Our
authority, could not in any true sense be called or accounted an innovation,
all sorts of people, and very many of those of all ranks who now inveigh most
bitterly against it, having been so accustomed to it* and acquainted with it,
and that without any dislike of it or complaint against it.

Mary her days delivered up their living bodies to the fire, or escaping the
fire endured banishment, and only because they would not yield to Popery and
Superstition: How these men now, whom in their own judgment they hold to be
ranked amongst the most glorious Martyrs of the Church, for resisting even to
blood, Idolatry, Popery, and Supersti^ion, can with any conscience or honesty
be charged by these men with compiling of a Book stuffed full with Idolatry,
Popery, and Superstition, it requires more then an ordinary understanding to
apprehend: And besides, it will be made good, that more of the Bishops and
learned Clergy of England, both for number and weight, have opposed
Superstition and Popery, then can be found in all the reformed Churches
besides, who all of them have lived in the practice of the English Liturgy,
and defended the same; which they would never have done if they had supposed it
to contain Idolatry or Superstition.

These now were the grounds which inclined Us to conceive that the
Service Book, authorized by Us for that Kingdom, was not like to receive any
public or considerable opposition, though We did never expect it should miss
to meet with that misfortune which attends all other Books of this kind, and
which has waited upon the English Service Book here, viz. to be disliked and
defamed by some whose judgments either being weak are not capable of
satisfaction, or being distempered with the humors of singularity, are
resolved never to receive, or at least never to seem to receive any
satisfaction.

And yet, even those men too, especially they of the first sort, men of weaker
judgment, before, and at the time of the publishing of this Book, were not
cast without the compass of Our care and clemency: For We did with that Book
send home certain instructions and directions to our Bishops of that Kingdom
signed with Our own hand, amongst which this was one: That notwithstanding We
had now established this Book by Our authority, yet they should proceed with
all moderation, and dispense with such for the practice of some things
contained in the Book, as they should find either not well persuaded of them,
or willing to be informed concerning them, or did hope that time and reason
might gain to a better belief of them: Nay yet more, to foresee what probable
opposition this Book might be like to receive, We caused Our Council by
Proclamation to publish a set day for the reading of it in all Churches, which
was the Easter day following, 1637: All which time, though no symptoms of any
considerable opposition did appear, yet upon good considerations, and for the
further trial of men's minds, the first reading of it was delayed until the
xxiii. of July next ensuing, to the end that the Lords of the Session, and
others who had any Law-businesse, might see the success of it before the
rising of the Session, which always ends on the first of August, and that so
upon their return to their several Countries they might report the receiving
of this Book at Edinburgh; it being ordered, that on that Sunday the Book
should be read only in the Churches of Edinburgh, and those which were next
adjacent: And because it should not be read that day neither unexpectedly,
warning was first printed, and then published in all these several Pulpits the
Sunday immediately before, that the next Sunday the new Service Book was to be
read: After all which premonitions made only to try how the people stood
affected, and no fear of tumult appearing; Nay, the Service Book, which was to
be read, having been in public Sermons commended by many Preachers, without
any apparent disgust of the Book, or disgrace offered to the Preachers persons;
Nay, having been commended in Sermons by some of their now principal
Covenanting Ministers, who since have been the greatest railers against it, by
none more then one Rollock a Minister of Edinburgh, who, both in a Sermon
preached by him at a Synod held at Edinburgh before the Bishop of that
Diocese, and in his Sermon on the Sunday of intimation of the reading of the
Service Book the next Sunday, did highly magnify the said Book: And so the
tendering of this Book being thus prepared and sweetened with these gracious
considerations of time, and expectation of the discovery of men's affections,
which, for any thing appeared to the contrary, were very calm and composed,
who could have imagined that the first reading of it should have been attended
with such a barbarous tumult and insurrection, as was raised in the Churches
and streets of Edinburgh the Sunday following? the true relation of which
tumult, as it was sent up to Us, does here follow.

On the twentie-third day of July, 1637. being Sunday, according to the public
warning given the Sunday before, the Service Book was begun to be read in
Edinburgh in Saint Gyles Church, commonly called the great Church; where were
present (as usually they are) many of Our Council, both the Archbishops and
diverse other Bishops, the Lords of the Session, the Magistrates of Edinburgh,
and a very great auditorie of all sorts of people. Amongst this great multitude
there appeared no sign of trouble: But, no sooner was the Book opened by the
Deane of Edinburgh, but a number of the meaner sort, who used to keep places
for the better sort, most of them women, with clapping of their hands,
cursings, and outcries, raised such a barbarous hubbub in that sacred place,
that not any one could either hear or be heard: The Bishop of Edinburgh, who
was to preach, stepped into the Pulpit, which is immediately above the place where
the Deane was to read, intending to appease the tumult, by putting them in
mind that the place, in which they then were, was holy ground, and by
entreating them to desist from that fearful and horrible profanation of it:
But he was entertained with as much irreverence as the Deane, and with more
violence; in so much, that if a stool, aimed to be thrown at him, had not by
the providence of God been diverted by the hand of one present, the life of
that Reverend Bishop, in that holy place, and in the Pulpit, had been
endangered, if not lost: The Archbishop of Saint Andrews Lord Chancellor,
and diverse others offering to appease the multitude, were entertained with such
bitter curses and imprecations, as they not being able to prevail with the
people, the Provost, Bailiffs, and diverse others of the Council of that City
were forced to come down from the Gallery in which they do usually sit, and
with much ado, in a very great tumult and confusion, thrust out of the Church
these disorderly people, making fast the Church doors: After all which, the
Deane devoutly read Service, assisted by Our Counselors, Bishops, and many
other persons of quality there present: Yet the out cries rapping at the
Church doors, throwing of stones at the Church windows by the tumultuous
multitude without, was so great as the Bailiffes of the City were once more
put to forsake their places, and use their best endeavors for the appeasing
the rage and fury of those who were without. Service being ended, the Bishop
preached, after which the Congregation was dismissed: The Bishop of Edinburgh
retiring himself to a lodging distant not many paces from the Church, was so
environed with a multitude of the meaner sort of people, cursing and crouding
him, that he was near being trod to death; and in all probability had been
so, if he had not recovered the stairs of his lodging, which he no sooner
began to go up, but he was so pulled by the sleeve of his gown by some of that
rude rout, that he had like to have tumbled backward down the stairs, to the
indangering of his life, yet with much ado getting up the stairs he found the
door, at which he should have entered, shut against him, and so being put to a
stand, he had certainly been oppressed with the preasse and violence of that
rabble, if the Earl of Weems from his next lodging, seeing the Bishops life in
danger, had not sent his servants to rescue him, who got the Bishop almost
breathless into his lodging. The same morning the Service Book was read in the
next Church to Saint Gyles Church, not without noise and tumult, yet the fury
was not so great as in the other Church: In the Gray Friars Church the Elect
Bishop of Argyle (being Colleague to Master Ramsey who refused to read it)
begun to read the Book, but he was so cursed and exclaimed against, and
threatened to be pulled down, that after the reading of the Confession and
Absolution, he was forced to give over. In the College Church, Rollock, one of
the Preachers there, who the Sunday before, at the intimation of the reading of
it, had so much commended the Book, and had undertaken this day to read it,
though he had the Book ready to be carried to the Church with him, yet, very
wisely, resolved to halt a little, until he might know how it was entertained
at Saint Gyles Church, that so his conscience might comply with the carriage of
the multitude, whose rudeness being reported to him, he (notwithstanding his
commendations of the Book, and his faithful promise to read it,) thought it
the safer course to leave himself to the censure of all men for his levitie
and breach of promise, then offend the multitude, whose favor is the only
air in which he takes delight to breath and live: And thus that morning
passed.

Between the two Sermons, such of Our Council as were in the Town, assembled
at the Lord Chancellor his lodging, where the Lord Provost and Bailiffs of
Edinburgh being called, undertook to do their uttermost endeavors for the
quiet and peaceable reading of the Service Book in the afternoon; which
accordingly they did, and so the Service Book in Saint Gyles and some other
Churches, that afternoon was read, without any such tumult or insurrection as
it encountered with in the morning; yet the furious multitude, who stayed in the
streets, and little regarded the service of God in the Churches, intermitted
nothing of their madness* For the Lord Privy Seal Earl of Roxborough
returning home to his lodging, and having with him in his Coach the Bishop of
Edinburgh, was near suffering the death of the first Martyr St. Stephen, his
Coach and Coachman, for having the Bishop in it, being so pelted with stones,
and hooted at with execrations, and pressed upon by the eager and mad
multitude, that if the Lord Privy Seal his Footmen had not with their swords
kept them off, they in the Coach had been brought in danger of their lives,
having after long and continual bickerings much ado to recover their lodgings.

And now We desire all men to consider what blessing and success from heaven
may be expected upon this grand and important reformation of Religion, as they
call it, the begetter and beginner whereof was the horrible profanation of the
Lords own day, and that in the Lords own Houses and Temples, and all this
attended with the contempt and treading under foot the sacred Authority and
Laws of Us the Lords Anointed, as also with the violation of the persons of
the Lords Priests and Prophets, his Bishops and Ministers, and all these
practiced by a base multitude, disavowed and disclaimed at that time by all
Magistrates and persons put in authority, and all others of any rank or
quality, who branded that multitude with the names of the scum and froth of
the people, and offered themselves, to the uttermost of their diligence and
assistance, for the finding of them out, and bringing them to highest and
condign punishment, as shall presently appear by the demeanor of the
Magistrates when they were called before Our Council for that purpose.

For the next day, being the 24. of July 1637. Our Council assembled, and sent
forth a Proclamation in detestation of the uproare and tumult the day before,
and discharged all concourses of people and tumultuous meetings in Edinburgh
under pain of death; at which time the Magistrates of Edinburgh being then
present at Our Council Table, professed their utter abhorring, and detesting
of the last tumult, and apprehended some suspected to be most forward in it,
and thereupon were commanded and ordered by an Act of Our Council of the 26.
of July, to assemble the Council of the City the next morning by eight of the
clock, and then and there to resolve what course they thought fittest to be
held for the finding out of the movers of, and chief actors in the late
seditious uproare, and immediately after to report their diligence and
resolutions herein: Which report they accordingly made to Our Council, not
only with a detestation of that tumult, and promises of their best diligence
for finding out the authors and abettors of it, but also with large proffers of
their best assistance for the quiet and peaceable establishing and reading of
the Service Book in all their Churches.

But the Ministers of that City being loath to undertake the reading of it,
without some security given for the safety of their persons, the Lords of Our
Council by their Act of the 28. of July 1637. ordered the Provost, Bailiffes,
and Council of Edinburgh to advise amongst themselves concerning some
obligatorie Act to be made by them, for a real performance of what they had
undertaken, and should further undertake for the peaceable exercise of the
Service Book, which they accorded unto, and promised, that since the former
Readers in their several Churches, had refused to read the Book, if in the
mean time the Ministers themselves would read it, they would take order for
their safety, and when new Readers should be provided, they would take order
both for their security and settled maintenance and allowance: In pursuance
whereof, an obligatorie Act was drawn up by Our Advocate, and read before Our
Council to the Magistrates of Edinburgh the sixth of August 1637. to which they
humbly consented, and on the tenth of the same month, the said Act of
indemnitie being exhibited before Our Council, was allowed by them, and
accordingly passed and entered in Our Council book as an Act of Council: And
so now this late tumult in all appearance being settled, and not only fathered
upon the scumme and dregs of the people, but cried down by all men either of
place or quality, and by none more then by the Magistrates and Ministers of
Edinburgh, Our Council not fearing any new outrage, proceeded to these two
things.

First, to the exemplarie punishing of such of the heads of the late tumult as
they should discover: And next, to the settling of the practice of the Service
Book, and appointing a new day for renewing the exercise of it; to which the
Bishops, Magistrates and Ministers of Edinburgh agreed: And this their
forwardness the Magistrates of that City were not only contented to express
before Our Council, both by their verbal promises and protestations, as also
their obligatorie Act remaining upon record, and registered in Our books of
Council, but likewise by two particular Letters sent by them into England unto
the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, in which they desired him to recommend unto
Us, their care of, and fidelity to Our service, and to undertake for them to
Us their zeal and forwardness, for settling the peaceable practice of the
Service Book: Which Letters We here have caused to be inserted, that the
Reader may see what names of simplicity and ignorance they bestow upon that
multitude, which made the first opposition, and withal take notice of the
names of the Magistrates subscribers to these Letters; for some of them (which
hardly could be expected from reasonable men) will be found to be very forward,
if not leaders in the next succeeding sedition, and so of the rest which have
followed since: The Letters be these.

Most Reverend Father in God and our very good Lord,
We regrait from our hearts that tumult which did fall out in our Churches
that day of the inbringing of the Service Book, wherein now these of his
Majesty's Council, who have labored the trial thereof, will give testimony
of our innocence: Since that time and the rising of his Majesty's Council in
this feriall time, we have daily concurred with our Ordinary, and our
Ministry for settling of that Service Book, as the right Honorable the
Earl of Traquair Lord Treasurer, with the Bishops of Galloway and Dunbleane
will bear witness; who have spared neither pains nor attendance to bring
that purpose to a good conclusion: And although the poverty of this City be
great, being almost exhausted with public and common works, yet we have not
been lacking to offer good means, above our power, to such as should
undertake that service; and in all things wherein we have been required, we
have ever been ready really to approve our selves obedient and loyal subjects
to his Majesty, in all his Royal commandments, which we have vowed ever to
second to our lives end. And we being infinitely obliged to your Graces
favors, we now presumed by these lines to give your Grace that assurance of
obedience upon our part, in this purpose and in all other purposes wherein we
may contribute to the advancement of his Majesty's service, or can be expected
of good subjects: Whereof if his Majesty by your Grace shall be pleased to
rest assured, whatsoever any other shall suggest, we will accept it from you as
a great accumulation of favor; for all which your Grace shall ever find us
most thankful Remembrancers, and most ready really to express our
thankfulness, whenever we shall be made so happy as that your Grace shall have
occasion to use our service. Thus from our hearts wishing you all happiness,
we kiss your Graces hands.

Edinburgh this 19. of August, 1637. Your Graces most affectionate and humble
servants the Bailliffes of Edinburgh. J. Cochrane, Bailly. An. Ainslie, Bailly.
J. Smith, Bailly. C. Hammilton, Bailly.



THE SECOND LETTER.
Most Reverend Father in God and our very good Lord,
We did receive your Graces kind letter, and from our hearts we do render your
Grace most hearty thanks; and as we have hitherto found your special favor
in this matter, concerning the laitly imprinted Service Book, whereanent we
did write to your Grace formerly, showing our dutiful and obedient resolution,
not only in our selves, but in the greatest and best part of our Inhabitants,
of whom from time to time we had most confident assurance; so now we must
again become new suitors at your Graces hands to receive from us a true
information of the difference of the present time, and of that when we did
presume to write the occasions thereof, which is, that since our last there
has been such an innumerable confluence of people from all the corners of
this kingdom, both of Clergy and Laity, and of all degrees by occasion of
two Council days, and such things suggested to our poor ignorant people,
that they have razed, what we by great and continual pains had imprinted in
their minds, and have diverted them altogether from their former resolutions,
so that now when we were urged by our selfs alone, we could not adventure, but
were forced to supplicate the Lords of Council to continue us in the state
they had done the rest of the kingdom; having hitherto forborne either to
combine with them, or to countenance them in their supplications, yet we will
not forbear to do our Masters service to our power, but shall study to
imprint in their minds what has been taken away; in the interim we will
humbly beg your Graces favor and intercession with his Majesty, that we may
be kept still in his favor, which we do esteem our greatest earthly
felicity, and that what course shall be taken with the rest of this kingdom
in that matter, who have presented many supplications, and with whom we have in
no ways combined, that the same and no other may be taken with us, wherein we
are confident to prevail as much as any other within the kingdom, and in all
things shall endeavor nothing more, then that we may approve our selves most
dutiful and obedient subjects. Thus relying upon your Graces favor, as our
most assured refuge, we kiss your Graces hands, and rests,

Edinburgh this 26. of September, 1637. Your Graces most affectionate and
humble servants, the Bailliffes of Edinburgh. J. Cochrane, Bailly. J. Smith,
Bailly. C. Hammilton, Bailly. James Rucheid.



We confess that these large undertakings of the Magistrates, moved Us to
remit much of Our intended rigor against the offenders in the first uproare,
hoping that their acknowledgment of Our clemency, would have produced effects
quite contrary to those which We have found: And now We shall desire the
Reader to observe, that this first tumult was owned by none, condemned and
cried down by all, the authors of it, and actors in it called by all sorts, by
no better names then Rogues, and the base Multitude: What will you then think,
if that within very few days you shall see the very same liberal bestowers
of these names entering upon the same Stage, repeating and acting over again
the parts of that madd Multitude; Only the Stage you shall see a little better
hanged, and the Scenes better set out, and the Play having a more specious name
of Piety and Religion? For soon after, these base and unruly people, who were
so much out in their first act of Rebellion, (as Actors at the first are not
commonly perfect) were in the Pulpits, even for that their first and foul act
so much of late hissed at and decryed, afterward magnified for the most
heroical Sparks that ever God inspired and raised up in this last age of the
world; and though they were but Asses, yet they were cried up for having their
mouths opened immediately by God, as the mouth of Balaams Ass was, to the
upbraiding of all the rest of the Land, who held their peace when they should
have cried and brayed as they did: Their happy mouths and hands, which God was
pleased to honor that day with the beginning of their new blessed Reformation,
and occasioning their celestial Covenant (as they called it) were so highly
extolled by their Preachers, that they assured their Auditors that their
memorials should be eternal, whom before they had called the scumme of the
people, and the base Multitude, and that all succeeding generations should call
them blessed. These high flowne speeches, and many others of the like
extravagant strain, both in the Pulpits and out of them, immediately after the
first tumult, and ever since, have been bestowed, and that not sparingly, upon
that multitude, which not long before they called base and rascal: But no
wonder, for many of the better sort having succeeded that multitude in the same
madness, they must needs now give them new, high, and Heroical titles, such
as they would have given to themselves now acting their parts; for now their
own actions come next upon the Stage to be viewed and judged.

All businesses now for a time seemed to be hushed and calmed, by reason of the
long vacation, which in that Kingdom begins always on Lammas day, and the
Harvest, which drew all sorts of people from Edinburgh, except the Citizens; so
that little or nothing was done between the last of July and first of October,
save that some Ministers petitioned the Lords of Our Council for suspending
the Letters whereby they were charged to receive the Service Book, and that
they of Edinburgh begun a little by the instigation of their two silenced
Ministers to relent of their former forwardness for receiving the said Book,
and to repent themselves of their too eager condemning the raisers of the first
insurrection, and presented to Our Council on the 26. of September a Petition,
humbly desiring not to be pressed with the Service Book notwithstanding all
their former undertakings, but to be continued in the same case with all the
rest of the Kingdom, until Our pleasure were further known; which Petition,
as they alleged, they were necessitated to present, by the example and
encouragement of all ranks from all parts of the Kingdom.

But so soon as Harvest was done, the conflux of all sorts of Our subjects,
Nobility, Gentry, Ministers, and Burgesses from all parts of that Kingdom,
came to be so great at Edinburgh, and after such a tumultuous manner, as that, a
present Insurrection was justly feared; which forced Our Council, assembled
then at Edinburgh upon the day before appointed by them, viz. the xvij. of
October, 1637. to make three Proclamations; here in England: The three
Proclamations are here inserted.

Apud Edinburgh 17. October. 1637.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased the Kings Majesty, upon diverse good respects and
considerations, to give warrant and direction to the Lords of his Majesty's
Privy Council, for dissolving the meeting of this Council day, in so far
as concerns matters of the Church: And that every one that has come to
attend this business, repair to their own dwellings, except such persons as
shall make known to the said Lords of Council just cause of stay for their
particular affairs; Therefore the said Lords, according to his Majesty's
special warrant and direction sent unto them, have dissolved, and by the
tenor hereof do dissolve the meeting of this Council day, in so far as
concerns the business above written; And ordaines a Maissar of Council to
pass to the Mercate Cross of Edinburgh, and to make publication hereof; And
to command every one that has come hither to attend this business, to
repair home to their own dwellings within 24. hours after the publication
hereof, except such persons as shall make known to the said Lords just cause
of their further particular affairs in manner aforesaid, under the pain of
Rebellion, and putting them off to the Horn; with certification to them, that
if they fail they shall be denounced Rebels, and put to the Horn, and all
their moveable goods escheat to his Majesty's use.

Apud Edinburgh 17. October. 1637.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased the Kings Majesty, upon diverse great and good
considerations known to his Majesty, to remove his Council and Session from
the City of Edinburgh to the Burgh of Dundie: And whereas it is inconvenient
at this time to remove it so far, his Majesty is graciously pleased that
this next Session shall be holden at the Burgh of Linlithgow, and the next
after the ordinary vacants at the Burgh of Dundie: And there to remain during
his Majesty's pleasure: And therefore the said Lords, according to his
Majesty's special direction, ordaines Maissars or Officers of Arms to pass
and make publication hereof to all his Majesty's good subjects by open
Proclamation at all places needful, whereby they can pretend no ignorance
thereof, but may prepare themselves to attend at Linlithgow and Dundie
accordingly.

Apud Edinburgh October. 17. 1637.
FOrasmuch as the Kings Majesty is credibly informed, that there is a certain
book entitled, A Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies, obtruded upon
the Kirk of Scotland, and has been sent abroad and dispersed in this
Kingdom, purposely to stir the hearts and affections of the subjects from
their due obedience and allegiance: And therefore it has pleased his Majesty
to give order and direction to his Council, that diligent inquiry and search
be made for the said book; And for this effect the said Lords ordaines letters
to be directed to make intimation and publication to all his Majesty's
subjects, that such of them as have any of the said books, bring in the same
to the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council betwixt the date of this
Proclamation and the day of And the said books being brought in, that the same
be publicly burnt, certifying all his Majesty's subjects if any of those
books shall be found or known to have been with any of them after the time
aforesaid, that they shall incur the like censure and punishment as the
Author may be found to deserve for any thing contained in that book.

ANd whether We and Our Council were not justly necessitated to these
Proclamations, and whether it were not high time to require obedience to them,
though none was yielded, let that barbarous insurrection which was raised the
next day, sufficiently testify.

On the eighteenth of October 1637. the Bishop of Galloway and Sir William
Elfinston Lord chief Justice of that Our Kingdom, being appointed by the
Lords of Our Council to examine witnesses in a cause depending before them,
between Francis Stuart son to the late Earl of Bothwell, and diverse others,
the Bishop was peaceably passing along the street toward the Councell-house
where the examinations were to be taken: But suddenly an enraged multitude
surrounded him, and followed him with fearful cursings and exclamations close
to the Councell-house door, where he was again incountred afresh with a new
troop, who watched, and lay in wait for his coming thither, and whose fury
exceeded words; for in all probability the Bishop had been pulled in pieces
by them, if by divine providence he had not been defended by the said Francis
Stuart, who with much ado got the Bishop within the doors of the
Councell-house, where Our Lord chief Justice stayed for him: But when he was
there, that place of highest Reverence within that Our Kingdom, was no
Sanctuary for him; for they continued demanding his person, and threatening him
with death: The report hereof, and the danger of their Lords life, was brought
by some of the Bishops servants presently to the Earl of Traquair Our Lord
Treasurer, and the Earl of Wigton, one of the Lords of Our Council, who were
then at a lodging not far from thence: They came presently with their
followers to the relief of the Bishop, but very hardly for the crowd of the
mutiners could approach the Councell-house where he was; at last, when with
much ado they got entrance, they found themselves in no better case then the
Bishop was, for the peoples fury meeting with no proportionable resistance,
increased the more: The Lords thus beset in Our Councell-house, sent privately
to the Lord Provost, Bailiffes, and Council of Edinburgh, who were then
assembled in their own Councell-house, requiring them to come to their rescue,
and to take some present order for their safety: They, by one Sir Thomas
Thompson, who indeed was an eye witness of the truth of it, returned this
answer; That they were in the same, if not a worse case themselves, if the
Lords without did not presently pacify the enraged multitude; that the whole
streets were pestred with disorderly people; that their Councell-house was
beset without, and thronged within, with their own threatening Citizens, who
had vowed to kill all within their house, unless they did presently subscribe
to a paper presented to them, which for fear of their lives they were forced
to do: Which paper contained these three particulars: Ramsey and Rollock,
their two silenced Ministers: Henderson a silenced Reader: No doubt three most
important grounds for such a fearful sedition: No better answer being
returned, the Lord Treasurer and the Earl of Wigton, with their followers,
resolved to go up to the Town Councell-house, and to use the uttermost of
their authority, or (if that found no respect) their best persuasions for
settling the present sedition: When they came thither, they found the
Magistrates very much discomposed, and greatly perplexed, as much doubting
whether they should ever escape from the place with their lives; yet they
presently entered into consultation with them about what was fittest to be done
in such an exigent; and finding now that the public divulging of that paper
which the Magistrates and Council of the City had subscribed, and that the
open proclamation of it throughout all their turbulent troops, and at the
Cross, had a little assuaged their furious rage, the Lords begun to advise
with the Magistrates what was best to be done for the safety of the Bishop of
Galloway, whom they had left besieged in the Councell-house: It was thought fit
by all, that the Lords should return to Our Councell-house, and contain
themselves therein, till the Magistrates might try what they could do for
calming the commotion in the streets: But no sooner had the Lords presented
themselves to the streets, but they were received with such violence as they
were forced to retire, until such time as two of the Bailiffes with their
Sergeants and Officers, and such others as they got to attend them,
accompanying the Lords, and repeating to the multitude what had been yielded
to in the paper exhibited to them, a little way was made at first; But
presently when they entered upon the great street, the barbarous multitude run
most inragedly upon them: Their outcries were horrible and confused, but were
(as much as in such a confusion could be distinguished,) God defend all those
who will defend Gods cause, and God confound the Service Book, and all the
maintainers of it. The Lords being in present and imminent danger, assured the
people that they would represent their grievances to Us; for when they
perceived that the people refused to obey any commandment which was laid upon
them in Our name, and that they slighted their requiring of them to retire
unto their own houses, and to behave themselves as quiet and good subjects;
under pain of Our highest displeasure, they were glad then to betake
themselves to entreaties and plausible persuasions; but all in vain: For the
people still increased their fury, and that to such a height, as that the Lord
Treasurer was thrown down, his hat, cloak, and white staff pulled from him,
so that if by the strength of some about him, he had not been presently pulled
up again upon his feet, he had undoubtedly been trod to death, and in that
posture without hat or cloak, like a notorious malefactor, was he carried by
the crowd to Our Councell-house door, where the Bishop of Galloway and others
of Our Council were imprisoned, in great fear, and expecting the Lords
return for their relief: Not long after the Provost and Bailiffes came
thither to them, told them they had used their uttermost power and persuasions
with the best, ablest, and of the prime esteem of all their Citizens for the
appeasing of the present tumult, and securing their Lordships persons, but
could find no concurrence nor obedience: Whereupon the Lords resolved to send
for some of the Noblemen, and Gentry, and others who were now frequently
assembled for assisting the petition against the Service Book, to try what help
they would or could contribute for quieting the enraged people, and what
assistance they might expect from them in freeing them from the present danger:
They, being sent for, came to the Lords and declared unto them how much they
were unsatisfied with the present mutiny, offered their persons and power for
securing them from all violence; which the Lords in Our Councell-house
accepting of, with much ado (being guarded by them whom the people would not
offend) the Lord Treasurer got to Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, and the Bishop
of Galloway to his lodging: But the Lord Provost was again set upon as he was
entering his own house, and was so pressed upon by the multitude, that they
crowded with him into his own yard, railing upon him and throwing stones at
his windows, until some of his servants discharging a Piece which had nothing
but powder in it, they retired for fear: In this tumult none were more forward
and inexorable, then two who were Bailiffes the year before, and who had
subscribed the two Letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury.

This mornings storm being a little blown over, Our Council in the
afternoon met at Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, and commanded a Proclamation
presently to be made at the Cross of Edinburgh; the tenor whereof here
follows.

At Haly-rud-house the 18. of October. 1637.
FOrasmuch as a number of the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, as
likewise the Town Council of Edinburgh, being this day conveened in their
several Judicatories for his Majesty's special affairs and service, they
were most rudely interrupted in the course of their proceedings, by a
tumultuous gathering of the promiscuous and vulgar multitude, by whom his
Majesty's Council and servants in an open way was shamefully environed: Which
being a matter very disgraceful to his Majesty's Authority and lawful
Government, and which in the consequence thereof may produce dangerous effects,
if the like be not prevented in the time to come; Therefore the Lords of
secret Council, according to the duty of their place and charge incumbent
unto them, Ordaines a Maissar of Council to pass to the Mercate Cross of
Edinburgh, and there by open Proclamation to discharge all public gatherings
and convocations of his Majesty's subjects within the City of Edinburgh, and
upon the streets thereof; As likewise all private meetings tending to faction
and tumult: And in his Majesty's name and authority, to command and charge all
his Majesty's lieges and inhabitants within the said City, to contain
themselves in peace and quietness; And for that effect to keep their houses,
except when their lawful business does otherwise call them, Under all highest
pain and charge that by rigor of law can be inflicted upon the contraveeners
of the premises in manner above expressed.

TO this Proclamation so little obedience was yielded, and they of Edinburgh so
far from conceiving that they had any way misdemeaned themselves by that
horrible insurrection, as that the next Council day they had the impudence to
send their Commissioners publicly to Our Council Table, and there to require
that their Ministers and Reader might be restored to them, and that they might
have assurance for the performance of what was promised to them by their
Magistrates at this last Rebellion, and before the pacification of it.

From this Relation joined to the Narration of the first insurrection in the
Churches, it is easy to judge whether this their intended glorious
Reformation, which, according to their religious intentions and ardent prayers,
they say, God, even to a miracle, has so graciously prospered in their hands,
be like to proceed from God, the first act whereof was begun in the Church,
with contempt of God and profanation of the house where his honor dwells,
and the violation of those persons who serve at his Altar; and the second Act
whereof, was presented on the streets of the capital City of the Kingdom,
with the contempt of the highest Authority under God, viz. Us and Our laws,
and offering violence to the persons of Our Counselors and chief Officers of
State, not forbearing the very houses and places where Our Council for that
Kingdom, and Our Magistrates of that City do usually sit, and were then
sitting; which places have always been accounted sacred, and have duly
challenged all respect and reverence.

And now it is very observable by what degrees this Rebellion has risen, as
if it had been beforehand well studied and contrived, every rank entering upon
the Stage in their due turns, in which they served and answered one another:
The first tumult was begun by the basest sort of that City, whom the Authors
of this second insurrection did then, even for that first tumult, condemn by
the name of Rascals and scum of the people: This second uproare, far more
seditious and dangerous then the former, was made by the best sort of Citizens,
excepting only the Magistrates and some few others, yet disavowed and disliked
(at least in show) by the Nobility, Gentry, and the Magistrates of the City;
but these last Mutiners were not so cried down by them as the former, nor did
they put such vile names of Rebels and Rascals upon them, nor did they show any
signification of their desire to have them questioned or punished for that
tumult, because now the quality of these last mutiners persons gave some good
countenance to the designs which they themselves had in hand: For these
Noblemen, Gentry, and Magistrates being themselves to perform the third Act
of that Tragedy, at the first whereof they had hissed, and seemed to dislike
the second, held it not fit to be too severe in condemning of that which it
seems they meant shortly after to act themselves, and in a more dangerous way:
For first, their Protestation against Our Proclamation, and then their Covenant
against Us and Our Authority, were next to come upon the Stage; which though
they were of the same plot and piece with the two other former insurrections,
yet because they were to be better acted, and the Actors men of greater
eminency, they hoped their parts should not find such foul names as the
former had found: As if the things being the same, the names of Protestation or
Covenant could alter the nature of insurrection and Rebellion; like those of
that bloody League in France, who hoped that the very name of the HOLY
LEAGUE would cause in the world a mistake of their meaning, and palliate their
most wicked and unnatural treasons, for rooting out their lawful Sovereign
and the true Religion. And now this highest and worst part comes next to be
related.

After these tumults, there were presented to Our Chancellor and Council, two
Petitions, one a very weak and childish one, in the name of all the men,
women, children, and servants of Edinburgh, only against the Service Book;
another in the name of the Noblemen, Gentry, Ministers, Burgesses, against the
Service Book and Book of Canons: That to the Lord Chancellor was as
follows.

My Lord Chancellor,
UNto your Lordship humbly shows, we, men, women, and children, and servants,
Indwellers within the Burgh of Edinburgh: That whereas we being urged with this
Book of Service, and having Observe that the children as well as the rest
considered this.
considered the same, We find many things therein so far different from that
form of Gods public worship universally received and professed within this
Kingdom: And we Burgesses, being at our entry and admission deeply sworn for
the maintenance thereof, that now makes our hearts to tremble, and our weak
consciences will not suffer us to embrace and practice this urged Service: We
have this long time past, winked at some former alterations, being put in hope
that no further novations should follow. But now we being oppressed, with our
just fears to see our selves deprived of that liberty in serving God which
ever has been approved by Church and Kingdom: In place whereof we are now
like to be constrained to embrace another, which has neither been agitated nor
received either by general Assembly or Parliament: In such extremity we are
most humbly to supplicate your Lordship to consider our present estate, and
that this business is a matter of so great weight and consequence as should
not appear to be a needless noise of simple women, but it is the absolute
desire of all our hearts for preservation of true Religion amongst us, which is
dearer to us then either estate or life: And therefore we do humbly crave, that
as the rest of the Kingdom, so we may have a time to advise, and that your
Lordship may find out some way whereby we may be delivered from the fear of
this and all other innovations of this kind, and have the happiness to enjoy
the true Religion, as it has been by the great mercy of God reformed in this
land, and authorized by his Majesty, who may long and prosperously Reign over
us: And your Lordships answer.


Their Petition to the Council follows.

My Lords of Secret Council,
UNto your Lordships humbly shows; We Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, Burgesses,
and Commons; That whereas we were in humble and quiet manner attending a
gracious answer of our former supplications against the Service Book imposed
upon us, and ready to show the great inconveniences which upon the
introduction thereof must ensue, we are, without any known desert, far by
our expectation, surprised and charged by public Proclamation to depart out of
the town within twenty four hours thereafter, under pain of Rebellion; by
which peremptory and unusual charge, our fears of a more severe and strict
course of proceeding are augmented, and course of our supplication interrupted:
wherefore we are constrained, out of the deep grief of our hearts, humbly to
remonstrate, that whereas the Archbishops and Bishops of this Realm, being
entrusted by his Majesty with the government of the affairs of the Church of
Scotland, have drawn up and set forth, and caused to be drawn up and set
forth, and enjoined upon the subjects two Books; In the one whereof, called the
Book of Common prayer, not only are sown the seeds of diverse Superstitions,
Idolatry, and false doctrine, contrary to the true Religion established
within this Realm by diverse Acts of Parliament; But also the Service Book of
England is abused, especially in the matter of Communion, by additions,
subtractions, interchanging of words and sentences, falsifying of titles, and
misplacing of Collects, to the disadvantage of Reformation, as the Romish Mass
is, in the more substantial points, made up therein, as we offer to instruct
in time and place convenient, quite contrary unto and for reversing the
gracious intention of the And yet these blessed Reformers of Religion in
England were the very same men who compiled the English Service Book, which the
Covenanters have printed and preached to be stuffed full of Idolatry,
superstition, and popery.
blessed Reformers of Religion in England. In the other book called Canons and
Constitutions for the government of the Church of Scotland, they have ordained,
That whosoever shall affirm that the form of worship inserted in the Book of
Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, whereof heretofore and now
we most justly complain, does contain any thing repugnant to the Scriptures,
or are corrupt, superstitious, or unlawful in the service and worship of God,
shall be excommunicated, and not be restored but by the Bishop of the place, or
Archbishop of the Province, after his repentance and public revocation of
this his wicked error; Besides one hundred Canons more, many of them tending to
the reviving and fostering of abolished superstitions and errors, and to the
overthrow of our Church Discipline established by Acts of Parliament, opening a
door for what further invention of Religion they please to make, and stopping
the way which Law before did allow unto us for suppressing of error and
superstition; And ordaining, That where in any of the Canons there is no
penalty expressly set down, the punishment shall be arbitrary as the Bishop
shall think fittest: All which Canons were never seen nor allowed in any
General Assembly, but are imposed contrary to order of law, appointed in this
Realm for establishing Constitutions Ecclesiastical; unto which two books, the
foresaid Prelates have under trust procured his Majesty's Royal hand and
Letters Patents, for pressing the same upon his loyal subjects, and are the
Contrivers and Devisers of the same, as does clearly appear by the Frontispice
of the Book of Common Prayer, and have begun to urge the acceptance of the
same, not only by injunctions given in Provincial Assemblies, but also by
open Proclamation and charge of Horning, whereby we are driven in such straites
as we must either by Process of Excommunication and Horning suffer the ruin
of our estates and fortunes, or else by breach of our Covenant with God, and
forsaking the way of true Religion, fall under the wrath of God, which unto us
is more grievous then death. Wherefore we being persuaded that these their
proceedings are contrary to our gracious Sovereign hispious intention, who out
of his zeal and Princely care of the preservation of true Religion established
in this his ancient Kingdom, has ratified the same in his Highness
Parliament 1633* And so his Majesty to be highly wronged by the said Prelates,
who have so far abused their credit with so good a King, as thus to ensnare
his subjects, rend our Church, undermine Religion in Doctrine, Sacraments, and
Discipline, move discontent between the King and his subjects, and discord
between subject and subject, contrary to several Acts of Parliament: We out
of bound duty to God, our King and native Country, complain of the foresaid
Prelates, humbly craving, that this matter may be put to trial, and these our
parties taken order with according to the laws of the Realm; And that they be
not suffered to sit any more as Judges, until the cause be tried and decided
according to Justice. And if this shall seem to be to you a matter of higher
importance then you will condescend unto, before his Majesty be acquainted
therewith, Then we humbly supplicate that this our grievance and complaint may
be fully represented to his Majesty, That from the influence of his Gracious
Soveraigntie and Justice these wrongs may be redressed, and we have the
happiness to enjoy the Religion, as it has been reformed in this Land.


IN this Petition it is worthy the observing, that they complain of the
mangling of the English Service Book, and of the abuses offered unto it, and
the wronging of the intentions of the blessed Reformers of Religion here in
this Kingdom, whereas in their Sermons and ordinary discourse, they do
usually inveigh against the Service Book here, for being stuffed with
Superstition and Popery, and that the first Reformers of this Church never
departed fully from Rome: And in this last Petition they begin to make their
grievances swell, adding their dislike of the Book of Canons to their former
distaste of the Service Book; the occasion of Our authorizing of which Book of
Canons, was this.

As We were desirous to settle one uniforme form of public Prayer and Divine
Service throughout that Our Kingdom, and for that purpose authorized the
Service Book, so We conceived that it was not only expedient, but necessary
that there should be one uniforme form of Church government throughout the
same, and because there was no book extant containing any rules of such
government, so that neither the Clergy nor Laity had any certain rule either
of the ones power, or of the others practice and obedience, and considering
that the Acts of their general Assemblies were but written, and not printed,
and so large and voluminous, as it is impossible that so many copies of them
should be transcribed, as that they may come to the use and knowledge of many,
and so Apocryphal, as that few or none of themselves can tell which of them
are authentical, and so unsafely and uncertainely kept, that they do not know
whither to address themselves for finding of them, We could not imagine but
that it should have been acknowledged, and received with all thankfulness,
that We had reduced their numerous Acts, and those not known to them, to such
a paucitie of Canons, and those published, that none could be ensnared through
ignorance, nor complain that they were overcharged with the multiplicitie of
them: For it may be averred with unquestionable certainty, that not one in
that Our Kingdom did either live under the obedience of the Acts of the
general Assemblies, or did know what they were, or where certainly to have
them: And yet these men have interpreted Our furthering their knowledge and
facilitating and conveniencing their obedience for one of the most grievous
burdens was ever laid upon them: But no wonder it is, if when men's minds are
once out of taste with government nothing tending to order relisheth well with
them.

Their petition was sent up to Us by Our Council: But We seeing no sign of
repentance for, or disavowing of their late tumults, until some order might be
taken for the finding out and punishment of the authors of them, resolved to
delay the answering of their petition, but in the mean time commanded Our
Council to signify to all Our good subjects Our averseness from Popery, and
detestation of Superstition, the contrary suggestions whereof We found the
heads of this Rebellion had used for abusing of Our loyal subjects, and so
accordingly Our Council caused a Proclamation to be made at Lithgow, which was
this.

Apud Linlithgow septimo December. 1637.
FOr as much as the Kings Majesty, having seen the Petition presented to the
Lords of his Majesty's privy Council, and by them sent up to his Majesty
concerning the Service Book, determined to have taken the same into his Royal
consideration, and to have given his gracious answer thereanent with all
conveniencie: Like as his Majesty by his letters to his Council of the date
of the ninth of October last, did signify his gracious resolution to the
effect aforesaid. But since that time, his Majesty finding (far contrary to
his expectation) that such disorderly, tumultuous and barbarous insolenceis
have been committed within the City of Edinburgh upon the eighteenth of
October last, to the great contempt of his Majesty's Royal authority, by
abusing his Majesty's Counselors and Officers of State, with others bearing
charge and authority under his Majesty within the said City: His Majesty in
a just resentment of that foul indignity, (wherein his Majesty's Honor did
so much suffer) has been moved to delay the signification of his Majesty's
gracious intention, in giving to his subjects such satisfactorie answers to
their Petitions as in equity might have been expected from so just and
religious a Prince; But yet his Majesty being unwilling that his Loyal and
faithful subjects should be possessed with groundless and uncessarie doubts
and fears, His Majesty is pleased out of his goodness to declare, like as by
these presents he declares, That as he abhors all Superstition of Popery,
so he will be most careful that nothing be allowed within his Majesty's
Dominions, but that which shall tend to the advancement of the true Religion,
as it is presently professed within his most ancient Kingdom of Scotland: And
that nothing is or was intended to be done therein against the laudable laws
of this his Majesty's native Kingdom. And ordains publication to be made
hereof in form as a foresaid.

AT this time We sent into Scotland the Earl of Roxburgh Lord privy* Seal,
with certain instructions to Our Council for ordering these disordered
affairs; according to which they appointed the Council to sit at Dalkeith,
being not above four miles from Edinburgh, that so they might the more easily
know what passed in that place, now become the seat of the Rebellion; and they
removed the Session or Term from Lithgow to Sterlin, a place of 24. miles
distance from Edinburgh, that so the huge disorderly multitudes there
assembled, might be dispersed, by the necessity of the attendance of such as
had any Law-businesse: At the same time the Earl of Traquair Lord Treasurer of
that Kingdom, whom We had sent for hither, was returned back with directions
from Us: He, with Our Lord privy Seal and other principal Councellers,
repaired to Sterlin, where by Our commandment they caused a Proclamation to be
made for the dispersing of the huge and dangerous multitudes there assembled,
and the assuring of Our subjects of Our sincerity toward the Religion
established in that Our Kingdom: And there first, the Nobility, Gentry,
Ministers, and Burgesses did the same thing which they themselves called the
uproare of Rascals at the first reading of the Service Book in the Churches of
Edinburgh, and which they condemned, but in milder terms, by the name of an
unjustifiable act, in that great sedition at Edinburgh on the eighteenth of
October 1637: For by them, first at Sterlin, then at Lithgow, and last at
Edinburgh, was made the first avowed affront to Us, Our authority and Laws:
For at Sterlin Our Proclamation being made, the Earl of Hume and the Lord
Lindsey, assisted with many others of all ranks, made a Protestation against
the same; which Protestation was afterward repeated at Lithgow, and last at
Edinburgh, where, when upon the Cross, Our Proclamation was made by Our
Officers with sound of Trumpets, and assisted with Our Heralds with Our coats
of Arms upon their backs, it was received, while it was in reading, with
jeering and laughing, and after it was ended with a Protestation against it,
made by many Earls, Lords, Ministers, and Burgesses, and the conflux of all
other sorts of people, who were all of them so malapert as not to suffer Our
Heralds and Officers to come off the Cross, but forced them to stay and hear
their Protestation against Our Proclamation, as if both had been made by the
same authority: And if this now were not a higher act of Rebellion then either
the first tumult raised in the Churches, against which they so much declamed,
or the second insurrection at Edinburgh, which they so much disclamed, We
leave it to the world to judge: The copies both of Our Proclamation and their
Protestation We have here inserted, that themselves, as well as others, may see
that We wrong not the truth.

CHARLES by the grace God, King of great Britain, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith, etc. To Our Lovits, etc.
Our Sheriffs in that part conjunctly and severally, specially constituted,
greeting. For as much as We, out of Our Princely care of maintenance of the
true Religion already professed, and for beating down of all superstition,
having ordained a Book of Common prayer to be compiled for the general use and
edification of Our subjects within Our ancient Kingdom of Scotland, the same
was accordingly done: In the performing whereof, We took great care and pains;
So as nothing past therein but what was seen and approved by Us, before the
same was either divulged or printed, assuring all Our loving subjects, that not
only Our intention is, but even the very Book will be a ready means to
maintain the true Religion already professed, and beat out all Superstition;
Of which We in Our own time do not doubt but in a fair course to satisfy Our
good subjects. But having seen and considered some Petitions and Declarations
given in to Our Council against the said Book and late Canons of the Church,
We find Our Royal Authority much injured thereby, both in the matter and in
the carriage thereof; whereby We conceive these of Our Nobility, Gentry,
Buroughs, Ministers, and others, who kept and assisted these meetings and
Convocations for contriving and forming the said Petitions, or who have
subscribed the same, to deserve and be liable to Our high censure, both in
their persons and fortunes, as having conveened themselves without either Our
consent or authority; Yet because We believe that what they have done herein
is out of a preposterous zeal, and not out of any disloyalty or disaffection
to Soveraigntie, We are graciously pleased in so far as concerns these
meetings for consulting or subscribing of these Petitions, or presenting the
same to any Judge or Judges in Our said Kingdom, to dispense therewith, and
with what may be their fault or error therein, to all such as upon
signification or declaration of Our pleasure shall retire themselves as
becomes good and dutiful subjects: To which purpose Our will is, and We
charge you straightly, and command, that incontinent these Letters seen, you
pass, and in Our name and authority make intimation hereof, to all Our lieges
and subjects, by open Proclamation at all places needful, wherethrough none
pretend ignorance thereof; And therewith also, That you in Our name and
authority discharge all such convocations and meetings in time coming, under
the pain of treason: And also that you command, and charge, and inhibit all
Our lieges and subjects, that none of them presume nor take in hand to resort
nor repair to Our Burgh of Sterling, nor to no other Burgh, where Our Council
and Session sits, till first they declare their cause of coming to our
Council, and procure their warrant to that effect. And further, that you
command and charge all and sundry Provosts, Bailiffes, and Magistrates within
Burgh, That they and every one of them have a special care and regard to see
this Our Royal will and pleasure really and dutifully obeyed in all points;
And that no violation thereof be suffered within their bounds, under all
highest pain, crime, and offense that they may commit against Us in that
behalf: As also that you command and charge all and sundry Noblemen, Barons,
Ministers and Burrowes, who are not actual indwellers within this Our Burgh,
and are not of the number of the Lords of our privy Council and Session, and
members thereof, and are already within this Our Burgh, that they, and every
one of them* remove themselves, and depart and pass forth of Our said Burgh,
and return not again, without the warrant aforesaid, within six hours after
the publication hereof, under the said pain of treason. And as concerning any
Petitions that hereafter shall be given unto Us, upon this or any other
subject, We are likewise pleased to declare, that We will not shut Our ears
therefrom; so that neither the matter nor form be prejudicial to Our Regal
Authority. The which to do We commit to you, conjunctly and severally, Our
full power by these Our Letters, delivering the same by you duly execute and
indorsed again to the bearer.

Given under Our signet at Sterling the nineteenth day of February, And of Our
Reign the thirteenth year, 1638. Per actum Secreti Concilii.

Here follows their Protestation.

For God and the King.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, Burrowes, appointed to attend his Majesty's
answer to our humble Petition and complaint, and to prefer new grievances,
and to do what else may lawfully conduce to our humble desires; That whereupon
the 23. of September last, we presented a Supplication to your Lordships, and
another upon the 18. of October last, and also a new Bill relative to the
former upon the 19. of December last, and did therein humbly remonstrate our
just exceptions against the Service Book, and Book of Canons; and also against
the Archbishops and Bishops of this Kingdom, as the contrivers, maintainers,
and urgers thereof, and against their sitting as our Judges until the cause be
decided; earnestly supplicating withal to be freed and delivered from these
and all other innovations of that kind, introduced against the laudable Laws
of this Kingdom; as that of the High Commission, and other evils particularly
mentioned, and generally contained in our foresaid supplications and
complaints, and that this our party delinquent against our Religion and Laws
may be taken order with, and these pressing grievances may be taken order with
and redressed according to the Laws of this Kingdom, as by our said
supplications and complaints more largely does appear: With the which on the
19. of December last, we gave in a Declinator against the Archbishops and
Bishops as our parties, who by consequence could not be our Judges; whereupon
your Lordships declared by your Act at Dalkeith the said 19. of December, that
you would present our Petitions to his Majesty's Royal consideration, and that
without prejudice of the Declinator given in by us the said supplicants;
whereupon we should be heard at place and time convenient, And in the mean time
should receive no prejudice, as the said Act in it self bears. And whereas
we your Lordships supplicants with a great deal of patience, and hope also,
grounded on sundry promises, were expecting an answer to these our humble
desires, and having learned that upon some directions of His Majesty's anent
our supplications and complaint unto your Lordships of the Secret Council,
your Lordships admits to the consulting and judging anent our supplications,
and His Majesty's answer thereunto, the Archbishops and Bishops our direct
parties, contrary to our Declinator first propounded at Dalkeith, and now
renewed at Sterling; and It is not so: for the Council never promised that the
Bishops should be removed from the Table, but only that they would make Us
acquainted with their Petition.
contrary to your Lordships Act aforesaid at Dalkeith, and contrary to our
Religion, and Laws, and humble supplications. Therefore lest our silence be
prejudicial to this so important a cause, as concerns Gods glory and
worship, our Religion, Salvation, the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, or
derogatorie to the former supplications and complaints, or unanswerable to the
trust of our Commission; out of our bound duty to our God, our King and native
Country, we are forced to take instruments in Notaries hands, of your
Lordships refusal to admit our Declinator, or remove these our Parties, and to
protest in manner following: First, That we may have our immediate recourse to
our sacred Sovereign, to present our grievances, and in a legal way to
prosecute the same before the ordinary competent Judges, Civil or
Ecclesiastical, without any offense offered by us, or taken by your Lordships.
Secondly, We protest that the said Archbishops and Bishops, our Parties
complained upon, cannot be reputed or esteemed lawful Judges to fit in any
Judicatorie in this Kingdom, Civil or Ecclesiastical, upon any of the
supplicants, until after lawful trial judicially they purge themselves of
such crimes as we have already laid to their charge, offering to prove the same
whenever His Sacred Majesty shall please to give us audience. Thirdly, We
protest that no Act nor Proclamation to follow thereupon, past, or to be past
in Council or out of Council, in presence of the Archbishops and Bishops,
whom we have already declined to be our Judges, shall any ways be prejudicial
to us the supplicants, our persons, estates, lawful meetings, proceedings, or
pursuits. Fourthly, We protest that neither we nor any whose heart the Lord
moves to join with us in these our supplications against the foresaid
Innovations, shall incur any danger, in life, lands, or any Political or
Ecclesiastical pains, for not observing such Acts, Books, Canons, Rites,
Judicatories, Proclamations, introduced without or against the Acts of General
Assemblies, or Acts of Parliament, the Statutes of this Kingdom; But that it
shall be lawful to us or them to use our selves in matters of Religion of the
external worship of God and Policy of the Church, according to the word of
God, and laudable Constitutions of this Church and Kingdom, conform to His
Majesty's Declaration the ninth of December last. Fifthly, seeing by the legal
and submisse way of our former supplications, all who takes these Innovations
to heart, have been kept calm and carried themselves in a quiet manner, in
hope of redress; We protest that if any inconvenience shall happen to fall
out (which we pray the Lord to prevent) upon the pressing of any of the
foresaid Innovations or evils, specially or generally contained in our former
supplications and complaints, and upon your Lordships refusal to take order
thereanent, the same be not imputed to us, who most humbly seeks all things to
be reformed by an Order. Sixthly, we protest that these our requests,
proceeding from conscience and a due respect to His Majesty's honor, do tend
to no other end, but to the preservation of the true reformed Religion, the
laws and liberties of this His Majesty's most ancient Kingdom, and
satisfaction of our most humble desires contained in our supplication and
complaint, according to his Majesty's accustomed goodness and justice, from
which we do certainly expect that His Sacred Majesty will provide and grant
such remedy to our just petitions and complaints, as may be expected from so
gracious a King toward most loyal and dutiful subjects, calling for redress
of so pressing grievances, and praying to God that his Majesty may long and
prosperously reign over us.

AGainst which Protestation We shall now say nothing, because it is contained
and repeated in another larger Protestation of theirs, which shall be inserted
hereafter, and there it shall receive a full answer: Only We desire the Reader
to observe these two things in it; removed, and then promise they will make
proof of such crimes against them as shall declare the justice of their
removal; which is all one as to entreat them first to condemn a man, and then
to try him: And if a Protestation against their sitting in Council, and a
Declinator of Our Counsels authority (neither of them admitted by our
Council) shall make some Councillors to be parties, and invalidate all Acts
of Council so long as these Councillors whom they have fancied to be parties
sit there; how their last pretended general Assembly, against which there were
so many Protestations made both by the Bishops and others, and which by all
these Protesters was declined as Judge, because the members of it had all made
themselves parties, can be counted a lawful general Assembly, or the members
of it lawful Judges, We leave it to themselves to reconcile: And if they
should say, that these Protestations and Declinators against the Assembly were
repelled by the Assembly, who was the sole Judge of them, let them remember,
that their Protestation against the Bishops, and their Declinator against Our
Councels authority, if they should not eject them, were both of them, likewise
repelled and rejected by Our Council, who was the only true Judge of them,
their last pretended Assembly being no true but only a pretended Judge of the
others, after the Assembly was dissolved by Our authority.

And now after this their first Protestation, begun the most unnatural,
causlesse, and horrible Rebellion that this or perhaps any other age in the
world has been acquainted with: For now these Protesters begin to invest
themselves with the supreme Ensigns and Marks of Majesty and Soveraigntie,
by erecting public Tables of advice and Council, for ordering the affairs of
the Kingdom, without Our authority, and in contempt of Us and Our Council
established by Us there, and by entering into a Covenant and most wicked Band
and combination against all that shall oppose them, not excepting Our own
Person, directly against the law of God, the law of Nations, and the municipall
laws of that Our Kingdom: So that after this their Protestation, they
perfected that which they had before begun confusedly, and as it were in a
ruder draught: For then, contrary to Our express commandment and authority
expressed in Our last Proclamations, and repeated unto them by Our Council,
they did erect a great number of Tables (as they called them) in Edinburgh*
Four principal, One of the Nobility, another of the Gentry, a third of the
Burroughes, a fourth of Ministers; and the Gentry had many subordinate
Tables, according to their several Shires: These several Tables did consult
of what they thought fit to be propounded at the general Table, which
consists of several Commissioners chosen from the other four Tables; and
what they of the general Table resolved on, was to be put in practice with a
blind and Jesuiticall obedience: A rare and unheard form of Government in a
Kingdom whose Government ever was Monarchical, and which they themselves
still say continues to be so: Sure these meetings by wise men have been
accounted rather Stables of unruly horses, broken loose and pulling down all
they can reach, then Tables for the consultations of wise and rational men.
Now the first dung which from these Stables was thrown upon the face of
Authority and Government, was that lewd Covenant, and seditious Band annexed
unto it, which We here subjoine, because We are confident that by the very
recital and perusal of it, every religious and wise man may run and read that
sentence of condemnation which it carries in its own front.

THE CONFESSION OF FAITH OF THE KIRK OF SCOTLAND, SUBSCRIBED By the Kings
Majesty and his Household in the year of God 1580. WITH A Designation of such
Acts of Parliament as are expedient for justifying the union after mentioned;
And Subscribed by the Nobles, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and
Commons, in the year of God 1638.

JOSH. 24.25. So Joshua made a Covenant with the people the same day, and gave
them an Ordinance and Law in Sichem.

2 KING. 11.17. And Jehoiada made a Covenant between the Lord and the King, and
the people, that they should be the Lords people; likewise between the King
and the people.

ISAIA 44.5. One shall say, I am the Lord: another shall be called by the name
of Jacob: and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, etc.

The Kings Majesty's Charge, to all Commissioners and Ministers within this
Realm, in the year of God 1580.
SEeing that We and Our Household have Subscribed and given this public
Confession of Our Faith, to the good example of Our subjects, We command and
charge all Commissioners and Ministers, to crave the same Confession of their
Parochianars, and proceed against the refusers, according to Our Laws and
Order of the Kirk, delivering their names and lawful process to the Ministers
of Our House, with all haste and diligence, under the pain of forty pound to
be taken from their stipend, that We, with the advice of Our Council, may
take order with such proud contemners of God and Our Laws.

Subscribed with Our Hand,
at Haly-rud-house, 1580. the 2. day of March, the 14. year of Our Reign.
The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of SCOTLAND.
The confession of Faith, subscribed at first by the Kings Majesty and His
Household, in the year of God 1580. Thereafter, by Persons of all ranks, in
the year 1581. by ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Council, and Acts of
the General Assembly. Subscribed again by all sorts of Persons in the year
1590. by a new Ordinance of Council, at the desire of the General Assembly:
With a general Band for maintenance of the true Religion and the Kings Person.
And now subscribed in the year 1638. by us, Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons under subscribing: Together with our
resolution and promises, for the causes after specified, To maintain the said
true Religion, and the Kings Majesty, according to the Confession foresaid,
and Acts of Parliament. The Tenor whereof here follows.

We All, and every one of us underwritten, Protest, That, after long and due
examination of our own Consciences, in matters of true and false Religion, are
now thoroughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God, and
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with
our hands, and constantly affirm before God and the whole World; that this
only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing
Salvation to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by
the preaching of the blessed Evangel.

And received, believed, and defended, by many and sundry notable Kirks and
Realms, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and three
Estates of this Realm, as Gods eternal Truth, and only ground of our
Salvation: as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith,
stablished, and publicly confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a
long time has been openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of
this Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and form of
Religion, we willingly agree in our consciences in all points, as unto Gods
undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded only upon his written Word. And
therefore, We abhor and detest all contrary Religion, and Doctrine: But
chiefly, all kind of Papistrie, in general and particular heads, even as they
are now damned and confuted by the Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland: but in
special we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist,
upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civil Magistrate, and
Consciences of men. All his tyrannous laws made upon indifferent things
against our Christian liberty. His erroneous Doctrine, against the
sufficiency of the written Word, the perfection of the Law, the office of
Christ and his blessed Evangel. His corrupted Doctrine concerning original
sin, our natural inabilitie and rebellion to Gods Law, our justification by
faith only, our imperfect sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature,
number, and use of the holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all
his Rites, Ceremonies, and false Doctrine, added to the ministration of the
true Sacraments without the Word of God. His cruel judgment against Infants,
departing without the Sacrament: his absolute necessity of Baptism: his
blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, or real presence of Christ's body in
the Elements, and receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men. His
dispensations with solemn oaths, perjuries, and degrees of Marriage forbidden
in the Word: his cruelty against the innocent divorced: his divellish Mass*
his blasphemous Priesthood: his profane Sacrifice for the sins of the dead and
the quick: his Canonization of men, calling upon Angels or Saints departed,
worshipping of Imagerie, Relics, and Crosses, dedicating of Kirks, Altars,
Days, Vows to creatures; his Purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying or
speaking in a strange language, with his Processions and blasphemous Letanie,
and multitude of Advocates or Mediators: his manifold Orders, Auricular
Confession: his desperate and uncertain repentance; his general and doubtsome
faith; his satisfactions of men for their sins: his justification by works,
opus operatum, works of supererogation, Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations, and
Stations: his holy Water, baptising of Bells, conjuring of Spirits, crossing,
saning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the
superstitious opinion joined therewith: his worldly Monarchy, and wicked
Hierarchy: his three solemn vows, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts,
his erroneous and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers and
approvers of that cruel and bloody Band, conjured against the Kirk of God:
and finally, we detest all his vain Allegories, Rites, Signs, and Traditions,
brought in the Kirk, without or against the Word of God, and Doctrine of this
true reformed Kirk; to the which we join our selves willingly, in Doctrine,
Faith, Religion, Discipline, and use of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members
of the same, in Christ our Head: promising, and swearing by the Great Name of
the Lord our GOD, that we shall continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and
Discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same according to our vocation
and power, all the days of our lives, under the pains contained in the Law,
and danger both of body and soul in the day of Gods fearful Judgment: and
seeing that many are stirred up by Satan and that Roman Antichrist to promise,
swear, subscribe, and for a time use the Holy Sacraments in the Kirk
deceitfully, against their own consciences, minding thereby, first, under the
external cloak of Religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true
Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may serve, to become open
enemies and persecuters of the same, under vain hope of the Popes
dispensation, devised against the Word of God, to his greater confusion, and
their double condemnation in the day of the LORD JESUS.

We therefore, willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such
double dealing with God and his Kirk, Protest, and call The Searcher of all
hearts for witness, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our
Confession, Promise, Oath and Subscription; so that we are not moved for any
worldly respect, but are persuaded only in our Consciences through the
knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the holy
Spirit, as we shall answer to Him in the day when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed. And because we perceive that the quietness and stability
of our Religion and Kirk does depend upon the safety and good behavior of the
Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy granted to this
Country for the maintaining of His Kirk, and ministration of Justice amongst
us, we protest and promise with our hearts under the same Oath, Hand-writ, and
pains, that we shall defend His Person and Authority, with our goods, bodies,
and lives, in the defense of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our Country,
ministration of Justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within
this Realm, or without, as we desire our God to be a strong and merciful
Defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be all honor and glory
eternally.

LIke as many Acts of Parliament not only in general do abrogate, annull,
and rescind all Laws, Statutes, Acts, Constitutions, Canons civil or
Municipall, with all other Ordinances and practicke penalties whatsoever, made
in prejudice of the true Religion and Professors thereof: Or, of the true Kirk
discipline, jurisdiction and freedom thereof: Or, in favors of Idolatry and
superstition: Or, of the Papisticall Kirk: As, Act. 3. Act. 31. Parl. 1* Act.
23. Parl. 11. Act. 114. Parl. 12. of King James the sixth, That Papistrie and
Superstition may be utterly suppressed, according to the intention of the Acts
of Parliament reported in Act. 5. Parl. 20. K. James 6. And to that end they
ordain all Papists and Priests to be punished by manifold Civil and
Ecclesiastical pains, as adversaries to Gods true Religion, preached and by
law established within this Realm, Act. 24. Parl. 11. K. James 6. as common
enemies to all Christian government, Act. 18. Parl. 16. K. James 6. as
rebellers and gainstanders of our Sovereign Lords authority, Act. 47. Parl.
3. K. James 6. and as Idolaters, Act. 104. Parl. 7. K. James 6. but also in
particular (by and attour the Confession of faith) do abolish and condemn the
Popes authority and jurisdiction out of this land, and ordaines the
maintainers thereof to be punished, Act. 2. Parl. 1. Act. 51. Parl. 3. Act.
106. Parl. 7. Act. 114. Parl. 12. K. James 6. do condemn the Popes erroneous
doctrine, or any other erroneous doctrine repugnant to any of the Articles of
the true and Christian Religion publicly preached, and by Law established in
this Realm: And ordaines the spreaders and makers of Books or Libels, or
Letters, or writs of that nature to be punished, Act. 46. Parl. 3. Act. 106.
Parl. 7. Act. 24. Parl. 11. K. James 6. do condemn all Baptism conform to
the Popes kirk and the idolatry of the Mass, and ordaines all sayers, wilful
hearers, and concealers of the Mass, the maintainers and resetters of the
Priests, Jesuits, traffiquing Papists, to be punished without any exception or
restriction* Act. 5. Parl. 1. Act. 120. Parl. 12. Act. 164. Parl. 13. Act. 193.
Parl. 14. Act. 1. Parl. 19. Act. 5. Parl. 20. K. James 6. do condemn all
erroneous books and writs containing erroneous doctrine against the Religion
presently professed, or containing superstitious Rites and Ceremonies
Papisticall, whereby the people are greatly abused, and ordaines the
homebringers of them to be punished, Act. 25. Parl. 11. K. James 6. do condemn
the monuments and dregs of bygane Idolatry, as going to Crosses, observing the
Festival days of Saints, and such other superstitious and Papisticall Rites,
to the dishonor of God, contempt of true Religion, and fostering of great
error among the people, and ordaines the users of them to be punished for the
second fault as Idolaters, Act. 104. Parl. 7. K. James 6.

Like as many Acts of Parliament are conceived for maintenance of Gods true and
Christian Religion, and the purity thereof in Doctrine and Sacraments of the
true Church of God, the liberty and freedom thereof, in her National,
Synodall Assemblies, Presbyteries, Sessions, Policy, Discipline and
Jurisdiction thereof, as that purity of Religion and liberty of the Church
was used, professed, exercised, preached, and confessed according to the
reformation of Religion in this Realm. As for instance, Act. 99. Parl. 7. Act.
23. Parl. 11. Act. 114. Parl. 12. Act. 160. Parl. 13. K. James 6. ratified by
Act. 4. K. Charles. So that Act. 6. Parl. 1. and Act. 68. Parl. 6. of K. James
6. in the year of God 1579. declares the Ministers of the blessed Evangel,
whom God of his mercy had raised up, or hereafter should raise, agreeing with
them that then lived in Doctrine and administration of the Sacraments, and the
people that professed Christ, as he was then offered in the Evangel, and does
communicate with the holy Sacraments (as in the reformed kirkes of this Realm
they were presently administrate) according to the Confession of Faith, to be
the true and holy kirk of Christ Jesus within this Realm, and decernes and
declares all and sundry, who either gainsayes the Word of the Evangel,
received and approved as the heads of the Confession of Faith, professed in
Parliament in the year of God 1560. specified also in the first Parliament of K.
James 6. and ratified in this present Parliament, more particularly do specify;
or that refuses the administration of the holy Sacraments, as they were then
ministrated, to be no members of the said kirk within this Realm, and true
Religion presently professed, so long as they keep themselves so divided from
the society of Christ's body: And the subsequent Act. 69. Parl. 6. K. James 6.
declares, That there is no other face of kirk, nor other face of Religion,
then was presently at that time, by the favor of God, established within this
Realm, which therefore is ever styled Gods true Religion, Christ's true
Religion, the true and Christian Religion, and a perfect Religion. Which, by
manifold Acts of Parliament, all within this Realm, are bound to profess to
subscribe the articles thereof, the Confession of Faith, to recant all doctrine
and errors repugnant to any of the said Articles, Act. 4. and 9. Parl. 1. Act.
45.46.47. Parl. 3. Act. 71. Parl. 6. Act. 106. Parl. 7. Act. 24. Parl. 11. Act.
123. Parl. 12. Act. 194. and 197. Parl. 14. of K. James 6. And all Magistrates,
Sheriffs, etc. on the one part, are ordained to search, apprehend, and punish
all contraviners: for instance, Act. 5. Parl. 1. Act. 104. Parl. 7. Act. 25..
Parl. 11. K. James 6. And that, notwithstanding of the Kings Majestes licenses
on the contrary, which are discharged and declared to be of no force, in so
far as they tend in any ways to the prejudice and hinder of the execution of
the Acts of Parliament against Papists, and adversaries of true Religion, Act.
106. Par. 7. K. James 6. on the other part, in the 47. Act. Parl. 3. K. James
6. it is declared and ordained, seeing the cause of Gods true Religion and his
Highness Authority are so joined, as the hurt of the one is common to both;
and that none shall be reputed as loyal and faithful subjects to our
Sovereign Lord, or his Authority, but be punishable as rebellers and
gainstanders of the same, who shall not give their Confession, and make their
profession of the said true Religion; and that they who after defection shall
give the Confession of their faith of new, they shall promise to continue
therein in time coming, to maintain our Sovereign Lords Authority, and at
the uttermost of their power to fortify, assist, and maintain the true
Preachers and Professors of Christ's Religion, against whatsoever enemies and
gainstanders of the same: and namely, against all such of whatsoever nation,
estate, or degree they be of, that have joined and bound themselves, or have
assisted or assists, to set forward and execute the cruel decrees of Trent,
contrary to the Preachers and true Professors of the Word of God, which is
repeated word by word in the Articles of Pacification at Pearth the 23 of
February 1572. approved by Parliament the last of April 1573. ratified in
Parliament 1578. And related, Act. 123. Parl. 12. of K. James 6. with this
addition, That they are bound to resist all treasonable uproares and
hostilities raised against the true Religion, the Kings Majesty, and the true
Professors.

Like as all lieges are bound to maintain the K. Majesty's Royal Person and
authority, the authority of Parlaments, without the which neither any laws or
lawful judicatories can be established, Act. 130. Act. 131. Par. 8. K. Ja: 6.
and the subjects liberties, who ought only to live and be governed by the Kings
laws, the common laws of this Realm allanerly, Act. 48. Parl. 3. K. James 1.
Act. 79. Parl. 6. K. James 4: repeated in Act. 131. Parl. 8. K. James 6.
Which, if they be innovated or prejudged, the Commission anent the union of
the two kingdoms of Scotland and England, which is the sole Act of the 17.
Parl. of K. James 6. declares, such confusion would ensue, as this Realm could
be no more a free Monarchy, because by the fundamental laws, ancient
privileges, offices and liberties of this kingdom, not only the Princely
authority of his Majesty's royal descent has bin these many ages
maintained, but also the peoples security of their lands, livings, rights,
offices, liberties and dignities preserved; and therefore for the preservation
of the said true Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this kingdom, it is statute
by Act. 8. Parl. 1. repeated in Act. 99. Parl. 7. ratified in Act. 23. Parl.
11. and 114. Act. of K. James 6. and 4. Act. of K. Charles, That all kings and
Princes at their Coronation and reception of their Princely authority, shall
make their faithful promise by their solemn oath in the presence of the
eternal God, that enduring the whole time of their lives, they shall serve the
same eternal God, to the uttermost of their power, according as he has
required in his most holy Word, contained in the old and new Testaments. And
according to the same Word, shall maintain the true Religion of Christ Jesus,
the preaching of his holy Word, the due and right ministration of the
Sacraments, now received and preached within this Realm (according to the
Confession of Faith immediately preceding) and shall abolish and gainstand all
false Religion, contrary to the same, and shall rule the people committed to
their charge, according to the will and command of God revealed in his foresaid
Word, and according to the lowable laws and constitutions received in this
Realm, no ways repugnant to the said will of the eternal God, and shall
procure, to the uttermost of their power, to the kirk of God, and whole
Christian people, true and perfect peace in all time coming; and that they
shall be careful to root out of their Empire all Heretics, and enemies to the
true worship of God, who shall be convicted by the true kirk of God of the
foresaid crimes; which was also observed by his Majesty at his Coronation in
Edinburgh 1633. as may be seen in the order of the Coronation.

In obedience to the commandment of God, conform to the practice of the godly
in former times, and according to the laudable example of our worthy and
religious Progenitors, and of many yet living amongst us, which was warranted
also by Act of Council, commanding a general Band to be made and subscribed
by his Majesty's subjects of all ranks, for two causes: One was, for defending
the true Religion, as it was then reformed, and is expressed in the Confession
of Faith above written, and a former large Confession established by sundry
acts of lawful General Assemblies, and of Parliament, unto which it has
relation, set down in public Cathechismes, and which had been for many
years with a blessing from heaven, preached, and professed in this Kirk and
Kingdom, as Gods undoubted truth, grounded only upon his written Word: The
other cause was, for maintaining the Kings Majesty his Person and Estate; the
true Worship of God, and the Kings authority being so straightly joined, as
that they had the same friends and common enemies, and did stand and fall
together. And finally, being convinced in our minds, and confessing with our
mouths, that the present and succeeding generations in this Land, are bound to
keep the foresaid national Oath and subscription inviolable, We Noblemen,
Barons, Gentlemen Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons under subscribing,
considering diverse times before, and especially at this time, the danger of the
true reformed Religion, of the Kings honor, and of the public peace of the
Kingdom, by the manifold innovations and evils generally contained and
particularly mentioned in our late supplications, complaints, and
protestations, do hereby profess, and before God, his Angels, and the World
solemnly declare, That, with our whole hearts we agree and resolve all the
days of our life constantly to adhere unto, and to defend the foresaid true
Religion, and forbearing the practice of all novations, already introduced in
the matters of the worship of God, or approbation of the corruptions of the
public Government of the Kirk, or civil places and power of Kirkmen, till
they be tried and allowed in free Assemblies, and in Parlaments, to labor by
all means lawful to recover the purity and liberty of the Gospel, as it was
established and professed before the foresaid novations: And because, after due
examination, we plainly perceive, and undoubtedly believe, that the
Innovations and evils contained in our Supplications, Complaints, and
Protestations have no warrant of the Word of God, are contrary to the Articles
of the foresaid Confessions, to the intention and meaning of the blessed
Reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above written Acts of Parliament, and
do sensibly tend to the re-establishing of the Popish Religion and tyranny,
and to the subversion and ruin of the true Reformed Religion, and of our
Liberties, Laws, and Estates. We also declare, that the foresaid Confessions
are to be interpreted and ought to be understood of the foresaid novations and
evils, no less then if every one of them had been expressed in the foresaid
Confessions; and that we are obliged to detest and abhor them, amongst other
particular heads of Papistrie abjured therein. And therefore from the knowledge
and conscience of our duty to God, to our King and Country, without any
worldly respect or inducement, so far as humane infirmity will suffer,
wishing a further measure of the grace of God for this effect, We promise and
swear, by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, to continue in the Profession
and Obedience of the foresaid Religion: That we shall defend the same, and
resist all these contrary errors and corruptions, according to our vocation,
and to the uttermost of that power that God has put in our hands, all the
days of our life: And in like manner, with the same heart, we declare before
God and Men, That we have no intention nor desire to attempt any thing that may
turn to the dishonor of God, or to the diminution of the Kings Greatness and
Authority: But on the contrary, we promise and swear, that we shall, to the
uttermost of our power, with our means and lives, stand to the defense of our
dread Sovereign, the Kings Majesty, his Person and Authority, in the defense
and preservation of the foresaid true Religion, Liberties and Laws of the
Kingdom; As also to the mutual defense and assistance, every one of us of
another in the same cause of maintaining the true Religion, and his Majesty's
Authority, with our best counsel, our bodies, means, and whole power,
against all sorts of persons whatsoever. So that, whatsoever shall be done to
the least of us for that cause, shall be taken as done to us all in general,
and to every one of us in particular. And that we shall neither directly nor
indirectly suffer our selves to be divided or withdrawn by whatsoever
suggestion, combination, allurement, or terror, from this blessed and loyal
Conjunction, nor shall cast in any let, or impediment that may stay or hinder
any such resolution, as by common consent shall be found to conduce for so good
ends. But on the contrary, shall by all lawful means labor to further and
promove the same: and if any such dangerous and divisive motion be made to us
by Word or Writ, we, and every one of us, shall either suppress it, or, if
need be, shall incontinent make the same known, that it may be timously
obviated; neither do we fear the foul aspersions of rebellion, combination,
or what else our adversaries from their craft and malice would put upon us,
seeing what we do is so well warranted, and arises from an unfeigned desire to
maintain the true worship of God, the Majesty of our King, and the peace of
the Kingdom, for the common happiness of our selves, and the posterity. And
because we cannot look for a blessing from God upon our proceedings, except
with our Profession and Subscription we join such a life and conversation, as
beseems Christians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; We, therefore
faithfully promise, for our selves, our followers, and all others under us,
both in public, in our particular families and personal carriage, to endeavor
to keep our selves within the bounds of Christian liberty, and to be good
examples to others of all Godliness, Soberness, and Righteousness, and of
every duty we owe to God and Man. And that this our Union and Conjunction may
be observed without violation, We call the living God, the Searcher of our
Hearts, to witness, who knows this to be our sincere Desire, and unfeigned
Resolution, as we shall answer to JESUS CHRIST in the great day, and under the
pain of Gods everlasting wrath, and of infamy, and of loss of all honor and
respect in this World: Most humbly beseeching the LORD, to strengthen us by
his holy Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires and proceedings with a
happy success, that Religion and Righteousness may flourish in the Land, to
the glory of God, the honor of our King, and peace and comfort of us all. In
witness whereof we have subscribed with our hands all the premises, etc.

TO dispute against this Covenant scholastically, or otherwise then by
vindicating Our Royal Authority, and the Monarchical government of that Our
ancient Kingdom, is far beneath Us; and therefore We would only know, how
they can possibly answer these four questions to the world.

by a Magistrate, or by one sufficiently deputed by authority to administer
it: For it is a badge annexed to Magistracy and Authority, to have power of
giving and taking an oath; and therefore they cannot satisfy the world by what
Authority or deputation from Authority they did give this oath to, and
receive it from Our subjects. They do answer, that though they have no Law for
it, yet they have President; For this Confession of Faith (say they in the
title of their Covenant) was subscribed by Our Father of happy memory, and
his household, in the year 1580. thereafter by persons of all ranks in the year
1581. and that by the ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Council, and Acts of
the General Assembly: Subs^ribed again, by all sorts of persons in the year
1590. by a new ordinance of Council at the desire of the General Assembly,
with a general band for maintenance of true Religion and the Kings person.
Now, was this their Confession of Faith, and Covenant annexed, commanded to be
sworn and subscribed by Us, by any order from Our Council, or by any Act of
General Assembly? But they will say, that it being once commanded, that
commandment is still in force and vigor. That is indeed a good ground or
president for Us and Our Council, to command this same oath to be renewed when
We shall see cause; but the repetition of it must still be by the same
Authority by which it was at the first enjoined: Now, the first injunction of
this subscription was made by Our Royal Father, in the year 1580. the first
renewing of it in 1581. was (as they say themselves) by an ordinance of the
Lords of the Secret Council; the second renewing of it 1590. was by a new
ordinance of Council at the desire of the General Assembly. By which it is
plain, that the judgment of the General Assembly, (which in those days was
at the highest, and was not wont to derogate from their own power) was, that
this oath could not be renewed, nor any band, but by authority from Our Royal
Father and His Council. Again, have they not printed in the frontispice of
this their Covenant Our Royal Father his charge to certain Commissioners, and
all Ministers within that Realm, for requiring this oath, with a command to
return to the Ministers of his house, the names and processes of all such as
should refuse to take the said oath. Now, did any of all these precede their
Covenant? Was Our authority, or the authority of Our Council so much as
asked, much less obtained? Were there any Commissioners by Us, or Our Council
appointed to receive this oath in the several Shires? Nay, as shall appear
afterward in due place, when We, with the advice of Our Council, by
Proclamation did command the renewing of that oath, and designed Commissioners
throughout the several Shires of the Kingdom for administering of it, did not
those, who call themselves of the Table, refuse to swear it themselves, and
command that none of the Kingdom should swear it by any authority from Us?
And is not this pulling down of Our authority, and setting themselves in Our
place? So that if the Reader look upon the title and inscription of their
Covenant, he shall find (as We said) that it carries the overthrow of it in
its own front.

That this Confession is to be interpreted, and ought to be understood of all
the pretended Novations, no less then if every one of them had been
expressed in the said Confession. Had they said that they themselves did
prohibit these pretended novations, as other points of Popery in that
confession abjured, the words had then carried some sense, as intimating that
they themselves did now think that they did tend to Popery: But that they
should force any man to swear that the framers of that Confession at the first
did so, they being all dead, and so never were asked, nor can be asked the
question; or that they should make men living swear what was the mind of the
dead, concerning the five Articles of Pearth, the Service Book, the Book of
Canons, the high Commission, things of which in their lives they never heard,
nor perhaps did ever imagine the introduction of them, (they in that Confession
abjuring only those Romish corruptions, which in their time had infested the
Church,) is such a profane and foolish interpretation, that one would wonder
how any one that either has the knowledge, or makes conscience of an oath,
can either himself take, or desire others to take an oath so false and foolish
as this: And therefore, with more wit then honesty, where they met with no
scrupulous people, they suffered them to swallow down that wicked gloss which
corrupts the very text of the Confession: But where multitudes, especially
of the Ministers, (who at their admissions had sworn obedience to, and practice
of these points which they call innovations,) quarrelled at this their
interpretation, they assured them, that it would breed a great division if they
should desire but the least alteration of the words in which their Covenant was
conceived, but yet that they might very well swear all, with a reservation of
not abjuring Episcopacie, the five Articles of Pearth, or any thing established
by Acts of Parliament and General Assembly: With which Protestation and
reservation, and not otherwise, many, especially of the Ministers, did swear
their Covenant, as they themselves do well know: which was such a notable piece
of Jesuiticall equivocation on their parts, who exacted this oath, and
contrary to the very letter and grammatical sense of the oath it self,
especially in that part of it which contains their interpretation of the
Confession, as the like has scarcely been heard.

Thirdly, where was it ever heard that men, pretending for a ground of their
proceedings, the president of a former Confession and band annexed, did dare to
add any thing to the text of that Confession and band upon which they meant to
build their actions? But these men have taken upon them, not only without
authority to make an interpretation of that Confession, but flatly against
Authority, to add to the very text of the band of maintenance: For whereas
the band annexed to the former Confession was made in defense of Us, Our
Authority and Person, with their fortunes, bodies and lives, in defense of the
Gospel of Christ, and liberties of that Our Kingdom, etc. they have added a
mutual defense of one another; So that the band, which was at the first made
against those subjects who went about to correspond with forreiners for the
subversion of Our Religion and Kingdom, is now made against all persons
whatsoever, who shall oppose them in their courses. That band which was made in
defense of Our person and authority, against all treason at home and invasion
from abroad, is now principally made against Us, if We shall oppose their
courses; and next, against all such of Our loyal subjects as shall adhere to
Us in defense of Our person and authority: For these words, against all
persons whatsoever, not excepting Us, shows their bad meaning too well. Now,
whether Our Royal Father in the first band, by defense of His person and
authority, meant maintenance against Us His successor, Our person and
authority (for they urge the intention of the first Confession and band as a
warrant for this new one of theirs,) or whether the words of the Emperor, or
any Monarch, or any other Lawgiver, in any of their Laws or Rescripts, can
be taken in any tolerable construction against the Crown and Dignity of
themselves and successors; Or how these new Covenanters can with the same
breath blow both hot and cold, with the same hand both strike and stroke Us,
in one sentence swearing to defend Our person and authority, and yet in the
next swearing to defend one another against all persons whatsoever, not
excepting Us, if not principally intending Us, We leave it to the world to
consider.

James the sixth, Act. 12. and the 75. Act of the ninth Parliament of Queen
Marie, to which the Act last mentioned relates, have declared all leagues of
subjects amongst themselves, without the privitie and approbation of the King,
to be seditious, and the Authors and Abetters of them to be punished as movers
of sedition? The tenth Parliament of James the sixth, Act. 12.
FOrasmuch as there was an Act made in the Regiment of Mary, late Queen
dowager, and Regent of this Realm, Our Sovereign Lords grandmother of worthy
memory, concerning leagues and bands, as being thought, against all law and
obedience of subjects toward their Princes; The not observation of which Act
since the making, has given occasion of many troubles which have occurred
since: Wherefore Our Sovereign Lord, with the advice of His three Estates,
conveened in this present Parliament, ratifieth, approves, and for His
successors perpetually confirms the said Act of Parliament, and ordains
the same to have full effect and ^xecution in all time to come: And also of
new, with the advice of His said three Estates, discharges and annulleth all
leagues and bands made between his lieges and subjects at any time bypast
preceding the date hereof: And statuteth and ordains, that in time to come no
leagues nor bands be made amongst His subjects, of any degree, upon whatsoever
color or pretense, without His Highness or His successors privitie and
consent had and obtained thereunto, under the pain of being held and executed
as movers of sedition and unquietness, to the breach and trouble of the
public peace of the Realm, and to be cited and pursued therefore with all
rigor to the example of others.

The ninth Parliament of Queen Mary, Act. 75.
IT is statuted and ordained by the Queens Majesty, and three Estates in
Parliament, That no manner of person or persons, of whatsoever quality,
estate, condition, or degree, lieges of this Realm, attempt to do or raise
any bands of men of war, on horse or foot, with Culverings, Pistols, Pikes,
Spears, Jacks, Splents, Steel-bonnets, white harnis, or other warre-like
munition whatsoever, for daily, weekly, or monthly wages in any time to come,
without special license in writing had and obtained of Our Sovereign Lady and
her successors, under the pain of death, to be executed upon the raisers of
the said bands, as also upon them that do conveen and rise in bands.

Now Our consent to their Covenant was not only never granted, but never so
much as once asked.

When they have satisfied these important questions and considerations, which
are obvious to all men who are acquainted with Laws and Government, then let
them bethink themselves how they will answer, not only to all Divines abroad
who are not Jesuited, but even to their own Universities at home in that Our
Kingdom, in the case of conscience, how any Oath, much less such an unlawful
Oath as this, can be administered to any Prince his subjects, without his
consent or authority. There are but two Universities in Scotland which
confer all Degrees, S. Andrews and Aberdene; both these, upon the first
coming abroad of this their Covenant and Oath, did oppose it, and severally
set forth, sent abroad and dispersed in writing, those excellent and
unanswerable Reasons against it, which We have seen and have, but which the
Covenanters did never answer. Besides, the Divines of Aberdene set out in print
their Queries to the three Ministers, sent thither from their Table to persuade
their Covenant, which how poorly and pitifully they answered, and so again,
how they answered the same men's Duplies, as miserably as their former Queries,
We leave to the judgment of Scholars, to whom these three Ministers
weakness in their answers has made them sufficiently ridiculous. There is
likewise an Universitie in Glascow, which because it has but one College, and
has not of late conferred any Degree above that of Master of Arts, is called
the College of Glascow. They of that College were very backward to come into
their Covenant, until they were extremely threatened; and when they came in,
they premitted such interpretations and limitations, as were destructive of the
very foundation of it; some of the Regents never came in at all. In the
College of Edinburgh, where there are but four Regents, how two of them, for
not subscribing their Covenant, were expelled from their places, is notoriously
known. Now one would think, that in any Kingdom the judgment of the learned
Professors in Universities and Colleges, in a point of conscience, should
weigh down the groundless opinions of their Tables, consisting of Noblemen,
Gentlemen, Ministers and Tradesmen.

But leaving the many unanswerable reasons which may be brought against this
their Covenant, We shall desire the Reader to observe three things, which
appeared at the very first coming out of it: to sit at Our Council Table,
where many causes are heard, in which Religion is concerned; or in Our Session,
where many Churchmen have trialls for their maintenance? when they themselves
hold it not only convenient, but necessary, and that even jure divino, that
Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants, Tailors, Sadlers, Shoomakers, and others of
most mechanical Trades, shall sit and give sentence in Parochial Sessions and
in Presbyteries, in Causes Ecclesiastical, and those of the highest nature,
even the last and supremest censures of the Church, Excommunication, and
depriving of Ministers; nay, that they shall give sentence in the general
Assembly (a Judicatorie which now they hold to be above Our Session, Council,
or Parliament; for they maintain that the Acts of that Assembly may, in many
cases, disannull and derogate from the Acts of the other three) where they do
assume to themselves to determine all questions de Fide, Cultu and Disciplina,
of Faith, Worship or Discipline, and in which of late they did assume to
themselves power to determine, and, according to their weak and poor power,
did determine controversies concerning Predestination, universal Grace,
irresistibilitie of Grace, concurrence of Free Will with Grace, total or
final falling from Grace, and other such like intricate points, as some men
would be loath to live so long until they could make them understand them.

because of this seditious Covenant, that unless some speedy order were taken
for their present discouragement and sending back, the evil might quickly
pass remedy; which moved Us, notwithstanding these present broiles, to take
present order for such proceedings against them, as they were forced to retire.
With Protestants abroad, it was received with most offensive scandal and
infinite grief; which appeared unto Us by advertisements from some of Our
public Ministers abroad, who certified Us, that both the Ministers and others
of their Consistory at Charenton, and of other Reformed Churches in France, as
also the Professors, Ministers, and Consistory of Geneva, and of other
neighboring Reformed Churches in those parts, were so scandalized with this
prodigious Covenant, as that they were afraid of nothing more then this, that
it would bring an indeleble scandal upon the Reformed Churches, and alienate
the minds of all the Princes of Christendom from ever entertaining a good
thought of their Religion. Of what condition then and fearful consequence that
Covenant is, which brings grief and offense to Our friends, joy and triumph
to Our enemies, is evident to all eyes that are opened.



Now, the fire of this seditious Covenant flaming thoroughout all the corners
of the Kingdom, and that to such an unexpected height and violence, as it was
past both the skill and power of Our Council to quench it, Our Council
resolved to send up unto Us Sir John Hammilton Our Justice Clerk, one of Our
Privy Council, and one of the Lords of Our Session, that he might fully
acquaint Us with the passages of this Rebellion, and the consequences of it.
After Our hearing of him many times, and many consultations had with such of
Our Council of Scotland as were then here present, and such of Our Council
here in England as We thought fit to communicate this business unto, We
resolved to send unto that Our Kingdom the Marquess of Hamiltoun with the
full power of an High Commissioner, as in other cases Our Royal Father and We
had many times done in important business concerning that Kingdom; and in the
mean time, we dispatched home the said Sir John Hamilton to give notice
thereof, both that they might carry themselves quietly until Our Commissioner
his coming, from whom they were to expect Our pleasure, with all favor which
might consist with Royal authority, as also that they might before Our
Commissioners going from hence, have time to make Us fully acquainted with the
uttermost of their grievances, that so accordingly Our Commissioner might
receive Instructions from Us for giving unto them all just satisfaction.

And so We, having here taken into Our serious consideration all their
Petitions, which We might have justly rejected, because of the insolency of
their demeanor, and their tumultuous way of presenting them to Our Council,
yet resolved to take the mildest course We could for calming of these
commotions, and therefore We settled upon a way usually practiced by Our Royal
Father in that Kingdom since his coming to the Crown of England, viz. to
establish an High Commissioner, with full power and authority to conclude and
determine all such things as should be found for the good, quietness, and
peace of that Kingdom, with as full and ample power as other Commissioners had
exercised in any time of Our Royal Father, and especially at Parliaments. And
considering that none, in the consultations which We held for this business,
had ever showed himself more forward and inclinable to advices and counsels of
peace, nor a more zealous Patriot toward his native country, then Our right
trusty and well-beloved Cousin and Counselor of both Kingdoms, James
Marquess of Hamiltoun, etc. Gentleman of Our Bedchamber, and Master of Our
Horse; We made choice of him for Our High Commissioner, to that purpose, being
persuaded both of his loyalty and fidelity toward Us, as also of the great
acceptance of his person with Our subjects there, in regard of his birth and
place, but especially of his singular care of, and love to his country, which
they themselves did know he had so piously and affectionately expressed in all
his consultations and counsels here with Us: Him therefore We dispatched from
hence with full Instructions, according to which he was to receive his
Commission under Our great Seal of that Kingdom at his coming thither, which
he received and presented to the Lords of Our Council, frequently assembled at
Dalkeith, the sixth of June following; the true tenor of which Commission here
follows. CAROLUS Dei gratia Magnae Britanniae, Franciae, and Hiberniae, Rex,

On which day the whole body of Our Council, with all respectfull and dutiful
expressions of joy and thankfulness of Our fatherly care of that Our Kingdom
in these difficult times, acknowledged and received Our said Commission and
Commissioner: And Our said Cosen and Councellor, the Lord Marquess of
Hamiltoun, did with all submissive reverence then and there accept the said
Commission, promising the uttermost of his endeavors for settling the peace of
that Kingdom, so far as might consist with Our royal Crown and Dignity,
and the Laws and Liberties of that Our ancient and native Kingdom, as by the
Act of Council dated at Dalkeith the sixth of June 1638. does more fully
appear: After which acceptance of our Commission, the said Lord Marquess had
by Our Council, and all others, whenever he went abroad, all respects,
honor and reverence due to Our Commissioner, performed unto him, Our
Chancellor carrying Our great Seal before him, and some other Noblemen of
great place and quality carrying Our High Commission before him likewise.

We having now taken this course which We conceived most agreeable both to the
customs of that Kingdom, and most acceptable to them, in regard of the choice
of Our Commissioner, had then assured hopes, that the dangerous distractions of
that Kingdom might be happily composed: But these hopes were quickly blasted;
for no sooner had the heads of the Covenant notice of these peaceable courses
intended by Us, but they flew out, even before our Commissioners arriving
there, into far greater violence then heretofore, increased the frequent
meetings of their Tables, subdivided them into several Committees, increased
their provision of Arms, made their Pulpits ring with most seditious Sermons,
putting the people in fear, that now there was more danger to be expected from
the Lord Marquess his coming home, and all peaceable treaties, then ever; and
at their Tables concluded upon a paper, consisting of ten Propositions or
Articles, which they caused immediately before our Commissioners arrival, with
wonderful expedition, to be dispersed throughout all the Shires of that
Kingdom: which ten Articles, according to the true copy, We have caused to be
here inserted.



matters to be treated of, it is thought fit that there be a Committee chosen,
and that some of the Gentry, Burrowes, and Ministers be present at the
meetings with the Noblemen.





their own Acts, whose direction we crave: And although the Law were
interpreted as they allege, which is altogether untrue, and contrary to the
grounds and meaning of the Law, yet the body of the Kingdom, for whose good
the Law was made, may crave the lawful redress of the grievances sustained by
that Law, and our complaints, supplications, and protestations against the
Bishops, depending in process for clearing the subjects loyalty, and
repairing the wrong complained of, cannot be otherwise lawfully decided,
cannot remedy the present evils, nor prevent the like or worse evils in time
coming.











OUr Commissioner upon his way to that Kingdom, did meet with advertisements of
these strange fears, which the ringleaders of the Covenant (who were afraid of
nothing more then that our subjects should receive satisfaction from Us by Our
Commissioner) had possessed Our people with, and the bad entertainment he was
like to receive at his coming thither, acquainted Us therewith, but went
forward on his journey until he came to Barwick, from whence he sent to his
especial friends and kindred, and to all such Gentlemen of his own name, and
others, as were his Vassals and Tenants, and hold their lands from him by
service and attendance on him when he shall require it, he received answer
that all these Obligations were quite discharged by the Covenanters Table at
Edinburgh, who had absolutely commanded that none, who had subscribed their
Covenant, should go to meet, or give any personal attendance upon Our
Commissioner, until such time as they should have leave from their Table so to
do; and so Our Commissioner went from Barwick unattended by these Noblemen, or
by any other of his own kindred or vassals, unless such as had not subscribed
their Covenant, (except some few, whose affection exceeded the command of the
Tables); an affront before that time never offered to any person of his
quality in that Kingdom: Yet he was very nobly and honorably received, and
conducted to Dalkeith by all Our Council, most of the Lords of the Session,
who are the Judges of the Law, great troops of the Nobility and Gentry, who
had not subscribed their Covenant.

Now, the reasons why their Table had laid this strict charge, of not
conducting Our Commissioner, upon all their adherents, were these two, as
appeared plainly by the speeches uttered by many of the Covenanters
themselves:

Our Commissioner, immediately upon his coming to Dalkeith, (where the
Council assembled for safety, because the combustions at Edinburgh increased
daily) met with many discouragements and difficulties. First, We had sent some
small proportion of Arms, and powder to be put into Our Castle of Edinburgh,
justly doubting the surprisall of it by the Covenanters, who were there
assembled in great multitudes, and had of late made great provision of Arms
there. No sooner had the ship (in which these Arms with other goods were) cast
Anchor in Leith rode, but the Covenanters sent for the Merchant owner of the
goods, commanding him to bring the ship into the Harbor, and discharging him
from unloading any thing in the ship, especially Arms, until he had leave
from them, as he would answer the contrary at his peril; of which Our Lord
Treasurer being advertised, provided that night a Boat which landed the Arms
and powder, and Carts which presently carried them to Our Palace at Dalkeith,
some four miles distant: How for this the Merchant was used by them, and how
they did threaten to come by force and carry away that provision out of Our
own house of Dalkeith, is notoriously known. Much about this time Our
Commissioner came to Dalkeith, where he was received for his first welcome with
the certain news of the increase of the peoples rage in Edinburgh, of the
Covenanters resolution first to take the Castle, but (upon better advice) of
their deserting that purpose, yet falling upon that which was bad enough; for
they had begirt the Castle with strong guards, so that no person nor provision
could pass to or from it, but by their permission: Besides, they had entered
into consultation, whether they should by force take out of Our Palace of
Dalkeith that small provision of Arms and powder which was lately carried
thither: which counsel they were persuaded by some not to follow, because of
the residence of Our Commissioner there at that time; but one thing they
resolved upon, that during the abode of Our Commissioner and Council there,
though but four miles distant from Edinburgh, they would take no notice of
them, send no Petition to them: and howsoever they allowed some of Our
Commissioners particular kinsmen and acquaintance to go thither and visit him,
yet they would not depute any to speak with him of the business for which he
was sent, or of their complaints and grievances, but resolved not to leave
Edinburgh, where they were well enough, so that if he had any thing to deliver
to them, he might come thither, for to him and Our Council they would not
come: And that they might have some colorable pretense with the people for
this their insolent behavior and resolution, it was cast out and rumoured
abroad, that if they went to Dalkeith, there was an intention to blow them up
with Gunpowder; not that the Authors of that foul and divelish aspersion
entertained the least thought of any such fear, but that they might both have
a color for their unmannerly not addressing themselves thither, as also beget
in the minds of their ignorant followers a higher indignation against, and
jealousy of Our Commissioner and Council for such a wicked and treacherous
plot.

Now, at this very time when they made all this stir about that small
provision of Arms for Our Castle, which exceeded not two hundred Muskets, and
so many Pikes, with some small quantity of Powder, the Covenanters had two
good Ships come home loaded with Arms and Ammunition, which they landed openly
and avowedly.

All these difficulties and new troubles, augmented daily of purpose since
their notice of Our Commissioners journey, put him and Our Council to such a
stand, as they knew not well what resolution to take. The Covenanters force and
rage increased, which they had not power in any proportion to discharge; they
could not discover in them the least inclination to peace; they found they
would not so much as address themselves toward them, and they did not hold it
agreeable with Our honor, or the dignity of those places which they held
under Us, nor yet for their safety, to go to them; At last this means was
thought on, no doubt by the advice of those of their Table, who scorned to
seem to yield or petition for any such thing themselves.

The Citizens of Edinburgh sent certain Commissioners to Our High Commissioner
with a supplication* that he would be pleased to repair to Our Palace at
Haly-rud-house, where they might more conveniently give demonstration of their
affection to his Majesty's service, in attending his Graces directions. Our
Commissioner after he had acquainted and advised Our Council with this their
supplication, by their advice, as willing to take any occasion to enter into
the business for which We sent him, returned this answer to the Commissioners
of Edinburgh, That if they would undertake to be Masters and Governors of
their own city, that their citizens would behave themselves as good and
dutiful subjects, and take order that the multitudes, now present in their
city, who called themselves Covenanters, should do so too, and that the Guards
about Our castle of Edinburgh should be dismissed and discharged, he would
within a day or two repair to Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, otherwise not: For
that he did hold it not agreeable to Our honor, that he Our Commissioner and
Council should reside at Our said palace, which is situated at the one end of
the city, when Our castle seated at the other end of the same should be
blocked up with guards: All which, these Commissioners undertook to perform,
and by their words desired to approve themselves most loyal subjects, hoping
to clear themselves from many aspersions laid upon them, when his Grace would
be pleased to hear and examine their proceedings.

Hereupon Our High Commissioner, according to his promise, did remove himself
from Dalkeith to Our palace at Haly-rud-house, attended by all Our Council,
such of Our Nobility, Gentry, and others, as were affected to Our service,
which consisted of a great number: Some two or three miles from Edinburgh he
was met with the whole body of the Nobility and Gentry of Covenanters, then
resident at Edinburgh, who were all mounted on horseback, and consisted of
diverse thousands; and besides, in a nearer distance from Edinburgh, by the
Ministers then resident there, who were all on foot, and consisted of many
hundreds; and so all the way to Our palace was filled with swarms of people of
all sorts and sexes, many of whose exclamations and outcries were very sharp
and bitter, stuffed with cursings of Popery and Bishops; by which it was
apparent that the multitude had been made believe that these two were one and
the same thing. Our Commissioner when he first met on the way the Lords who
call themselves Covenanters, was entreated by them to hear a speech delivered,
as he should pass along, by a Minister in the name of the rest: But he,
remembering the advertisements which he had received of their most seditious
Sermons, and knowing by the same advertisements that he who was to deliver this
speech was a deprived Minister, and one of the most seditious in the whole
pack, returned answer to the Lords that he would not hear it, justly doubting
that it might be stuffed as full of passages against Our authority as their
Sermons used to be; and so that speech was omitted: Now, whether these great
troops of Covenanters, both of horse and foot, in a great body by themselves,
which did not join at the first with that company which attended Our
Commissioner from Dalkeith, but stayed for him on the way in a far grosser
body by themselves, was assembled to do honor to Our Commissioner, or for
showing their own power and strength, by way of comparison with the company
whom they met, which they far exceeded, We will not determine. But thus Our
Commissioner was conducted to Our Palace of Holy-rood-house, where he was
received by the Lord Provost, Bailiffes, Magistrates and citizens of Edinburgh
with outward demonstrations of being welcome. And this was all the
entertainment which at any time he had from the body of the Covenanters, during
the time of his abode in that Kingdom; which whether it were hearty and
sincere, or but only in show, and to show their own power, We leave it to be
judged by the entertainment and respect which afterward he received from them;
which will be found to be just none at all: For during the time of his
continuance amongst them, though he found that they gave civil respects to him
as Marquess of Hamiltoun, yet his being clothed with Our authority and
commission did much diminish them, as shall appear now in the next place, by
those perpetual affronts which they ceased not to offer daily to him and Our
Council, in all their proceedings concerning the business for which he was
sent.

Our Commissioner now being settled at Our palace, with the assistance of Our
Council, he fell presently upon the maine business with the Covenanters,
whom he desired to dismiss their great multitudes; which they did, being
indeed necessitated thereunto for the ease of their great charge. The two maine
Propositions which he offered to their consideration, were these: Fergus the
first King thereof: And that it was a proposition which though they had now
heard, they were resolved never to hear a second time: And accordingly, after
Our propositions thus made and rejected, they presently filled the people with
such misreports of the intentions and ends of Our Commissioners coming, as
they wrought them to a greater height of fury then before, as if now their
Religion and Laws were brought to the stake: For now new Guards were clapped
upon Our castle of Edinburgh, the Guards and Watches of the city multiplied,
the Preachers Prayers and Sermons grew to be so many Libells, and admonitions
that they should take heed of crafty compositions, or yielding in the least
point of their intended reformation; for if they should abate in any one thing,
it would be thought that they might be mistaken in all. They presently printed
their weak Reasons against their rendering up of their Covenant, nay, they grew
to that rage, that on the Saturday having knowledge that Our Commissioner
(attended with Our Council) was to hear divine Service and Sermon in Our own
chapel at Our own palace the day following being Sunday, they sent him word
that whosoever should read the English Service in Our chapel should never
read more, and that there were a thousand men provided for the disturbance of
it; which forced Our Commissioner that night to repair to Dalkeith, being
unwilling to hear Sermon but in Our own chapel, or there, without hearing
the English Divine Service, it having been continually read there by the space
of twenty years, in the audience of Our Council, many of the Nobility,
Judges, and persons of all quality, without any interruption or dislike: Nay
more, they grew to that boldness as to write letters to every one of Our
Council, requiring them to subscribe their Covenant; which Letter sent to
every one of them severally, but in the same words, here follows.

May it please your Lordship,
We the Ministers of the Gospel, conveened at this so necessary a time, do
find our selves bound to represent, as unto all, so in special unto your
Lordship, what comfortable experience we have of the wonderful favor of God,
upon the renewing of the Confession of faith and Covenant, what peace and
comfort has filled the hearts of all Gods people, what resolutions and
beginnings of reformation of manners are sensibly perceived in all parts of the
kingdom, above any measure that ever we did find or could have expected, how
great glory the Lord has received thereby, and what confidence we have (if
this sunshine be not eclipsed by some sinful division or defection) that God
shall make this a blessed kingdom, to the contentment of the Kings Majesty,
and joy of all his good subjects, according as God has promised in his good
Word, and performed to his people in former times; And therefore we are forced
from our hearts both to wish and entreat your Lordship to be partaker and
promover of this joy and happiness by your subscription, when your Lordship
shall think it convenient: And in the mean while, that your Lordship would
not be sparing to give a free testimony to the truth, as a timely and
necessary expression of your tender affection to the cause of Christ now
calling for help at your hands* your Lordships profession of the true Religion
as it was reformed in this land, the national oath of this kingdom sundry
times sworn and subscribed, ablishing us who live at this time, the duty of a
good Patriot, the office and trust of a Privy Counselor, the present
employment to have place amongst those that are first acquainted with his
Majesty's pleasure, the consideration that there is the time of trial of your
Lordships affection to Religion, the respect which your Lordship has unto your
fame both now and hereafter, when things shall be recorded to posterity, and
the remembrance, that not only the eyes of men and Angels are upon your
Lordships carriage, but also that the Lord Jesus is a secret witness now to
observe, and shall be an open Judge hereafter to reward and confess every man
before his Father, that confesses him before men: All of these and each of
them, besides your Lordships personal and particular obligations to God, do
call for no less at your Lordships hands, in the cause of so great and
singular necessity; and we also do expect so much at this time, according as
your Lordship at the hour of death would be free of the terror of God, and be
refreshed with the comfortable remembrance of a word spoken in season for
Christ Jesus, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.


OUr Commissioner in the mean time resolved to publish Our gracious
Declaration, for relieving of their grievances, and satisfying Our people in
Our forwardness for the maintenance of the Religion professed in that
Kingdom, and Our averseness from Popery, which they of the Covenanters Table
having notice of, being above all things afraid that Our people should receive
any satisfaction from Us, or rest contented with the grace of Our reasonable
proffers of favor, did mightily repine at, came to Our Commissioner, and
wished him for Our honor, his own safety, and peace of the public, not to
make any such Declaration, which undoubtedly would be encountered with a
Protestation, and that in such manner as would be displeasing to him, and make
the publishing of that Declaration be found disserviceable unto Us.

Our Commissioner being perplexed with these unexpected and dangerous
difficulties, resolved by fair proceedings to gain so much time, until he
might make Us acquainted with them, and receive Our answer and instructions
concerning them: In his Letters of advice he acquainted Us with the danger
threatened if he should publish Our Declaration, which though he knew to be full
of grace, yet the heads of the Covenant would never suffer the multitude of
their members to understand it so: Two things he desired of Us; One, that in
case We continued in Our resolution of publishing Our Declaration, We would
be pleased to sweeten it with this further favor, as to restore to the city
of Edinburgh the sitting of Our Council, Our Session, and all other Courts of
Justice, which he conceived would be very acceptable to Our Counselors,
Judges, to all Advocates, and all dependents upon the Law, to all Our subjects
which had business depending in any of these Courts, but most of all to the
city of Edinburgh, which complained much of their being impoverished by
absence of these Courts, and that this was like to prove a most probable
persuasion for reclaiming them to their former obedience: Next, that We would
be pleased to give him leave to take a journey unto Us, though he should return
presently, that he might acquaint Us with the new emergencies of businesses,
and such other things as could not be conveniently expressed in Letters, and so
accordingly receive instructions from Us for his carriage.

To which Letters of advice We did return by a speedy dispatch this answer;
That We would have Our Declaration no longer delayed, but commanded him
presently to publish it, because We would not (whatsoever the event should be)
have Our people barred the knowledge of Our Gracious intentions and favors
toward them, which We did see the leaders of them studied nothing more then to
suppress; And that at his entreaty, We were contented that all the Courts of
Justice should presently begin to sit again at Edinburgh for the reasons
contained in his Letters, and in hope of reclaiming of that City, which
otherwise by their misdemeanour had no reason to expect any such favor from
Us; And withal, after the dispatch of these two, that We were contented he
should repair to Us, as he desired, whenever he should find it
convenient, taking first order with Our Council for keeping all things in
order until his return.

This answer of Ours so soon as Our Commissioner received, he assembled Our
Council, and made them acquainted with it, who were so well satisfied with the
bringing back of Our Courts of Justice to Edinburgh, that presently they sent
unto Us a Letter of thanks of this tenor.

Most Sacred Sovereign,
THe Marquess of Hamiltoun, your Majesty's Commissioner, having imparted unto
us your Majesty's gracious pleasure and allowance that the Judicatories of the
Council, of Session, and others, should be returned to the City of Edinburgh;
Thereupon, the Lord Commissioner being present, order was given for publication
at the Market Cross of Edinburgh with all solemnities requisite; and that the
like publication should be made throughout the whole Kingdom at all public
places: This has given so great contentment to all your Majesty's subjects,
that we cannot express with what dutiful respect and hearty prayers for your
Majesty they have embraced this great and undeserved favor: In consideration
whereof we conceive our selves bound in duty to acquaint your Majesty
herewith; and withal to render to your Majesty most humble and hearty thanks
for this so great grace and goodness, which we hope shall contribute to the
good of your Majesty's service, and to establishing the peace of the Country,
for the which we all* your Majesty's good subjects shall ever be most
thankful, and all in duty bound to pray for your Majesty's long and happy
Reign.

ANd accordingly Our Commissioner caused Proclamation to be made at the Cross
of Edinburgh, for the first sitting down of the Session there, the Tuesday
following, being the third of July 1638. which was received with such joy by
the Judges, Advocates, and all others having relation to the College of
Justice, but above all by the Magistrates and Citizens of Edinburgh, that Our
Commissioner and Council did then well hope all men's minds had been well
prepared to receive the Declaration of Our Grace and favor which was to be
published in the next Proclamation, with an humble and thankful
acknowledgment; which undoubtedly they had done, if they had not been not
only diverted, but perverted by those men who interpreted every satisfaction
of Our subjects received from Us, to be a dividing and pulling them away from
themselves: And therefore they quickly cast about to find out some means, how
this Our special favor might not be resented by them, which was this: They
assured their followers that there were two of the Lords of Our Session, viz.
Sir Robert Spotswood President of the same, and Sir John Hay Our Clerk of
Register (answerable to the Master of the Rolls here in England) sworn
enemies to their Covenant, well affected to Episcopal government, procurers
and abettors of the pretended Innovations, that unless these two were
presently removed from Our Session, there could be no good intended to them by
the bringing of it back to Edinburgh, and therefore advised them to send some
of their number to Our Commissioner to desire that these two Our Judges might
presently be removed from that Court; Not that they who put this in their
heads, thought that Our Commissioner could yield to a request of so high
injustice, but because they knew, that he neither could nor would yield unto
it, and that therefore by his denial they should have means to irritate Our
people, even to a disgust of that Our Gracious favor, which the day before
they had so well relished.

But yet according to their resolution, some of the principal Covenanters of
all sorts sent from their Table, had the boldness to repair to Our
Commissioner, and to demand of him that which they were sure no just nor honest
man could grant, viz. That they could clearly prove briberie and corruptions
frequently to have been used by these Our two Judges, and therefore entreated
him to remove them presently from their places of Judicatorie, after which they
would intend process, and so legally proceed in the probation of these crimes
objected against them: To which their demand Our Commissioner returned this
just and modest answer, That sure they could not expect that he either could or
should condescend to this their desire, which yielded unto, did overthrow the
very foundation and maine rule of Justice, viz. That any man should be
punished for any crime before he were legally convicted of it, and therefore he
advised them to follow the constant course of justice, which was this; If they
thought these Judges clearly convincible of these horrible crimes, they should
intend first process against them, and then probation of the crimes; of which
if they were found guilty, then they needed not doubt but they should be
removed from their places, and receive such further condign punishment as the
Laws of the Kingdom had provided for such notorious criminals; assuring them,
that We his Master would be so far from hindering the course of Justice
against any such offenders, as that We would hold it a special service done
to Us, to bring the iniquity of Our Judges to public trial and censure, and
that he would make Us acquainted with their demands: with which just answer
they were resolved to be so unsatisfied, that they replied unto him, that this
his denial would be attended with a great inconvenience to all Our subjects,
for they would in that case of denial make and publish a Protestation, that
whatsoever Act, Decree, or Order, the Lords of Our Session should make in any
cause at which these two Judges, or either of them, were present and gave
voice, should be null and void in Law; and that none of Our subjects either
should be bound or would yield obedience to them: (Was not this a strange
usurpation upon Regal power?) To this Our Commissioner only added, That every
such Protestation must be made before the Lords of the Session, who had the
power of admitting or repelling it, and therefore for that point he remitted
them to these Lords as the competent Judges of it; which answer of Our
Commissioner they presently labored to have misconstrued by their party,
telling them that there was no hope of any Justice to be had against any man
who was an enemy to them and their Covenant.

At the day appointed by the Proclamation, the Session sat down, and Our
Commissioner in his own person went to the place, and opened it, with a short
speech to the Judges, to this purpose.

THat he was warranted from Us to recall the Session again to Edinburgh; That
the chief thing that had moved Us thereunto, was the sense of the many
incommodities which Our subjects in general, and the Judges in particular did
sustain by the removing of it; That We had required him to desire and command
the Judges to grant all reasonable dispatch to Our subjects in the
administration of Justice, that so some time which was lost might be regained;
That in Our name he required them to be very careful and circumspect, that in
these troublesome times no Order nor Decree might pass from them, which might
be prejudicial to Our Crown or service.

Our Judges hereupon returned to Our Commissioner their humble and hearty
expressions of all thankful acknowledgment, for this Our singular favor and
grace to themselves and all Our subjects, and with great submission entreated
him to return unto Us their humble and hearty acknowledgment.

And here now We desire the Reader to observe, that the Covenanters neither
made any such Protestation against the sitting of the two Judges, as they
talked of, nor did ever intend any process or probation against them for the
crimes objected, though Our Commissioner immediately after his return from Us,
assured them, that We not only had given them leave, but would thank them for
so doing; which We are confident they would have done if they had conceived
these Judges guilty, and gives to Us good assurance that this calumny
against these Judges, was only cast in by some of their ringleaders, to mar
and interrupt that resentment of Our grace and favor, which they perceived
wrought very much upon many of Our subjects of their party, for bringing
back again Our Courts of Justice to Our city of Edinburgh.

The Session thus settled, Our Commissioner resolved to publish by Proclamation
the Declaration of Our grace and favor: The principal Covenanters, when they
could not dissuade him from it, presently went about, and both by themselves
and their seditious Preachers, filled their followers minds with such
fearful expectations of it, that some days before it was published* they
filled the streets with multitudes of people, especially near the Cross where
it was to be proclaimed, and those in hostile equipage divided into ranks,
pulling their swords out of their belts, and with pistolls, being arms
prohibited by Our laws of that Kingdom, giving out, that if this Our
Declaration were hearkened unto, it would bring undoubted ruin to their
Religion, laws and liberties, though the people knew nothing of what was to be
delivered in Our Declaration: Some days they continued in this posture, which
made Our Commissioner delay the publishing of it, until he might hear of more
quietness and peace in the streets; of which being advertised, he caused the
Proclamation of Our grace and favor solemnly to be made at the Cross of
Edinburgh: No sooner were the trumpets sounded, but there came to the Cross a
mighty confluxe of people, the Covenanters had presently a scaffold erected,
on which they mounted with a Protestation ready written in their hands, before
Our Proclamation was pronounced: Our Proclamation was thus. CHARLES by the
grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, Defender of the
Faith. To our Lovits Heralds
Messengers, our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and severally specially
constitute greeting. Forsameikle as We are not ignorant of the great disorders,
which have happened of late within this Our ancient Kingdom of Scotland,
occasioned, as is pretended, upon the introduction of the Service Book, Book of
Canons, and High Commission, thereby fearing innovation of Religion and Laws.
For satisfaction of which fears, We well hoped, that the two Proclamations of
the eleventh of December, and nineteenth of February, had been abundantly
sufficient: Nevertheless, finding that disorders have daily so increased, that
a powerful rather then persuasive way, might have been justly expected from
Us; Yet We out of Our innative indulgence to Our people, grieving to see them
run themselves so headlong into ruin, are graciously pleased to try, if by a
fair way We can reclaim them from their faults, rather then to let them
perish in the same. And therefore once for all We have thought fit to declare,
and hereby to assure all Our good people, that We neither were, are, nor by the
Grace of God ever shall be stained with Popish superstition: But by the
contrary, are resolved to maintain the true Protestant Christian Religion
already professed within this Our ancient Kingdom. And for farther clearing of
scruples, We do hereby assure all men, that We will neither now nor hereafter
press the practice of the foresaid Canons and Service Book, nor any thing of
that nature, but in such a fair and legal way, as shall satisfy all Our
loving subjects, that We neither intend innovation in Religion or Laws. And to
this effect have given order to discharge all Acts of Council made thereanent.
And for the high Commission, We shall so rectify it with the help of advice of
Our privy Council, that it shall never impugn the Laws, nor be a just
grievance to Our loyal subjects. And what is farther fitting to be agitate in
general Assemblies and Parliament, for the good and peace of the Kirk, and
peaceable government of the same, in establishing of the Religion presently
professed, shall likewise be taken into Our Royal consideration, in a free
Assembly and Parliament, which shall be indicted and called with Our best
conveniencie. And We hereby take God to witness, that Our true meaning and
intention is, not to admit of any innovations either in Religion or Laws, but
carefully to maintain the purity of Religion already professed and established,
and no ways to suffer Our Laws to be infringed. And although We cannot be
ignorant, that there may be some disaffected persons who will strive to
possess the hearts of Our good subjects, that this Our gracious declaration is
not to be regarded; Yet We do expect that the behavior of all Our good and
loyal subjects will be such, as may give testimony of their obedience, and
how sensible they are of Our grace and favor, that thus passes over their
misdemeanors, and by their future carriage make appear, that it was only
fear of innovation, that has caused the disorders which have happened of late
within this Our ancient Kingdom. And are confident, that they will not suffer
themselves to be seduced and misled, to misconstrue Us or Our actions, but
rest heartily satisfied with Our pious and real intentions, for maintenance of
the true Religion and Laws of this Kingdom. Wherefore We require and heartily
wish all Our good people carefully to advert to these dangerous suggestions,
and not to permit themselves, blindely under pretext of Religion, to be led in
disobedience, and draw on infinitely, to Our grief, their own ruin, which We
have, and still shall strive to save them from, so long as We see not royal
Authority shaken off. And most unwillingly shall make use of that power which
God has endued Us with, for reclaiming of disobedient people.

OUR WILL is herefore, and We charge you straightly and command, that
incontinent these Our Letters seen, you pass to the market cross of Our
Burgh of Edinburgh, and all other places needful, and there by open
Proclamation make publication hereof to all and sundry Our good subjects, where
through none pretend ignorance of the same. The which to do, We commit to you
conjunctly and severally Our full power, by these Our Letters, delivering the
same by you duly execute and indorsed again to the Bearer.

Given at Our Court of Greenwich the twenty eight day of June, and of Our
Reign the thirteenth year. 1638. Per Regem.



NO sooner was it ended, but this their ensuing Protestation against it begun,
and was publicly read; which here, according to their printed Copy, We have
caused to be reprinted.

The Protestation of the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burrows, Ministers and
Commons, etc.
We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, That
whereas we the Kings Majesty's true and loyal Subjects, who have ever
esteemed it our greatest happiness to live under a religious and righteous
King, and our greatest glory to testify our best affections to our gracious
Sovereign, have been in His Majesty's absence from this His native Kingdom
heavily pressed for a long time past, And especially of late, with diverse
innovations, which both in themselves, and in the way wherein they have been
urged, do manifestly tend to the prejudice of the Kings honor, and of our
Religion, Laws and Liberties, And by which we were brought to such extremity,
that there was no way left betwixt the rock of excommunication, and the high
pain of rebellion on the one part, and the desperate danger of forsaking the
way of true Religion and the breach of our Covenant with God on the other, but
to represent our case, and present our supplications to the Lords of secret
Council, that being equally pondered by them, they might either be answered by
themselves, or by their recommendation might ascend to his Majesty's own
consideration: And therefore in all humble manner we did to this effect
supplicate their Lordsh: we were most willing (for the modest following of our
supplications) to obey their direction in choosing Commissioners for the great
number of supplicants, who flocked together from all quarters of the Kingdom;
were careful to order our selves in all Christian and quiet carriage, and
against the tediousness of many and long delays did wait for a long time with
very great patience, till at last they were pleased to receive our
supplications, complaints and bills: And conceiving them to contain weightier
matters then could by themselves be determined, they did promise and undertake
to represent and recommend the same, according to their more then ordinary
importance, unto his Majesty's Royal consideration, and to report his
Majesty's answer.

While his Majesty's good Subjects of all ranks, throughout the whole Kingdom,
had their minds wakened, and their hearts filled with the expectation of a
gracious and satisfactorie answer, worthy of his Majesty's pious and equitable
disposition, in the Month of February last, incontinent a rumor flies through
the Country, and fills all ears, That the Lords of his Majesty's secret
Council were commanded to make such a Proclamation concerning the Service
book, book of Canons, and the peaceable meetings of his Majesty's good
Subjects in time coming, as we were persuaded to have been procured by the
secret working, and malignant misinformation of our adversaries, Seeking for
their own private ends, without respect to his Majesty's honor, and welfare
of this Kirk and Kingdom, to stop the course of our legal proceedings, and to
escape their own due censure: And therefore intending to make known to the
Lords of secret Council what was noised concerning the Proclamation; how far
the whole Kingdom had been by some sinistrous misinformation frustrate of
their hopes, and their constant desire to have some course taken by their
Lordsh: advice; how his Majesty being further informed, might deliver his good
subjects from so great grievances and fears, and establish a sure peace in
this Country for time to come; we found our selves tied by order of Law to
decline those against whom we had made our complaint, unless we would admit
our parties to be our Judges: And in case our Declinator should not be
accepted, we behoved to protest, that we might have immediate recourse to the
King himself, etc.

Thereafter in the Month of March, finding that by the foresaid Proclamation
the innovations supplicated against were approven, our lawful proceedings
condemned, our most necessary meetings prohibited, there being no other way
left unto us, we were necessitate to renew the national Covenant of this Kirk
and Kingdom, thereby to reconcile us to God, provoked to wrath against us, by
the breach of his Covenant within this Land, to clear our Sovereigns mind from
all jealousies and suspicions, arising from our adversaries misinformation of
our intentions and carriage; and so to make way for his acceptance of our
humble supplications, and grant of their lawful remedies, to guard this Land
in defense of Religion, authority and liberty against inward divisions, and
external violences. And that our actions might be answerable to our holy
profession, we afterward drew up an humble supplication, containing our
grievances, and desires of the ordinary remedies thereof, to have been
delivered to the King himself: In the mean time we were directed by those,
who were entrusted by his Majesty, to attend his Declaration here in Scotland,
which would free us of all fears of innovations of Religion, and prove
satisfactorie: And lest for want of true information of our just grievances and
desires it should fall out otherwise, we expressed to them, with the greatest
modesty we could, our desires in some few Articles, and with great patience
have attended his Majesty's pleasure thereanent: And all this Month bygone
being frequently conveened to hear the same delivered by his Majesty's
Commissioner the right Noble and potent Lord James Marquess of Hamiltoun, etc.
we presented a new petition to his Grace as his Majesty's Commissioner, craving
most humbly the indiction of a free Assembly and Parliament, as the only
remedies thereof: Like as finding a misinformation, or mistake of our Covenant
with God, as if it had been an unlawful combination to be the maine
hinderance of obtaining our desires, in a new supplication; we have fully
removed that impediment, renewed our desires of those supreme judicatories, to
be indicted with diligence, for settling of the Kirk and Kingdom: But being
answered only with delays after these nine Months attendance, and with this
Proclamation that contained his Majesty's gracious declaration of his pious
intentions, not to admit of any innovations in Religion or Law, nor any stain
of Popish superstition, But on the contrary to be resolved to maintain the
true Christian Religion professed in this Kingdom; which we were ever so far
from calling in question, as in our supplicatications, complaints, and bills we
used the same as one cause of our desires, one ground of our confidence of a
gracious answer, and argument of our adversaries malignant misinformation of
so religious a King* And now most humbly (with bended knees and bowed hearts)
thank our gracious Sovereign for the same, Wishing and praying the Lord of
heaven, truly and fully to inform his Majesty how far these books,
judicatories, and all our other evils and grievances are full of idolatrous
superstitions, and Popish errors, How destructive of the reformation of
Religion in this Land, and of the Laws and Liberties of this Church and
Kingdom, and so directly contrary to this his Majesty's pious intention and
Declaration.

Yet seeing that no Proclamation could sufficiently remove the present evils,
nor settle our fears, nor secure us from the re-entrie of any evil or
Innovation, which it seemed to discharge or prevent the like in time coming,
nor satisfy our humble supplications, craving the present indiction of a free
Assembly and Parliament, as the only remedies of our evils, and means to
prevent the like: And seeing this Proclamation does not so much as make
mention, or acknowledge any of our supplications, complaints and grievances, or
any just cause thereof, except under the name of great increase of disorders,
faults, and mis-demeanours, but only our fears of some future Innovation of
Religion or Laws, occasioned only (as is pretended) by the introduction of
the Service book, book of Canons, and High Commission; which fears his
Majesty hoped to have been abundantly and sufficiently satisfied by his two
former Proclamations of the ninth of December, and ninteenth of February. And
by this his present Declaration, except his subjects be blindly (under pretext
of Religion) led unto disobedience, Does mis-ken, pass over, and so in effect
deny all our supplications, bills, articles, and desires, especially our
complaints against the Prelates our parties. And, that once for all, in a fair
and persuasive way, even after the resaite of our last supplication, clearing
us from the calumny of unlawful combination; Does not disallow nor discharge
any of the innovations, and evils complained upon, but only assures that his
Majesty will not press their practice, but in such a fair and legal way, as
shall satisfy his subjects of his intention; which (joined with the other
clause, allowing and confirming the Proclamation the nineteenth of February)
evidenceth the liberty left to any Prelate or persons to practice the same, and
by all other fair ways to persuade others thereunto; and his Majesty's
resolution to press their practice in a fair and legal way: And also
confirms the former Declaration, that the Service Book is a ready mean to
maintain the true Religion already professed, and to beat out all
Superstition, and no ways to be contrary to the Laws of this Kingdom, but to
be compiled and approved for the universal use and edification of all his
Majesty's subjects; Does not abolish, but promises to rectify the High
Commission, with advice of his privy Council, implying the Kings power, with
consent of the Council, to establish this or any judicatory within this
Kingdom, without consent of the three Estates conveened in Parliament,
contrary to the fundamental and express Laws thereof; and by consequent with
the like reason, to establish Laws and Service books, without consent of the
Assembly and Parliament; Which is contrary to the maine ground of all our
supplications, against the manner of their introduction; Does only promise to
take into his consideration in an Assembly and Parliament, which shall be
called at his best convenience, while as the evident and urgent necessity, for
settling the combustions, threatening the total dissolution and desolation of
this Church and State, excuses our uncessant and importune calling for these
present remedies; Does insinuate the continuance and execution of any pretended
Laws for these innovations of worship, and corruptions of Church government,
and civil places of Churchmen, which by our Covenant, we have obliged our
selves to forbear, and the re-establishment of these evils in an Assembly and
Parliament, which he will call in his best convenience, to wit, for that and
this other end of satisfying his subjects judgments anent the Service Book
and Book of Canons; Does condemn all our former proceedings, even our
supplicating, complaining, protesting, subscribing of our Covenant together,
and our continual meetings, as great disorders, increase of disorders,
deserving justly a powerful rather then a persuasive way, a running headlong
into ruin, a perishing in our faults, a blind disobedience under pretext of
Religion, and does threaten and denounce, Now once for all, If we be not
heartily satisfied, and give testimony of our obedience after this Declaration,
but continue, as by our former proceedings, to draw on our own ruin, that,
albeit unwillingly, he must make use of that power which God has endued him
with, for reclaiming of so disobedient people.

THerefore we, in our own name, and in name of all who will adhere to the
Confession of Faith, and reformation of Religion within this Land, are forced
and compelled, out of our bound duty to God, our King, native Country, our
selves and our posterity. (lest our silence should be prejudicial to so
important a cause, as concerns Gods glory and worship, our Religion and
salvation, the Laws and Liberties of this Church and Kingdom, or derogatory
to our former supplications, complaints, protestations, Articles and
proceedings, or unanswerable to the solemn oath of our nation covenant with
God) To declare before God and man, and to protest, Primo, That we do, and
will constantly adhere, according to our vocation and power, to the said
Reformation, in doctrine, use of Sacraments, and discipline; And that
notwithstanding of any innovations introduced therein, either of old or of
late. Secundo, we potest, That we adhere to the grievances, supplications, and
protestations given in at Assemblies and Parliaments, and to our late
supplications, complaints, protestations, and other lawful proceedings against
the same, and particularly against the Service book, and book of Canons, as
maine innovations of Religion and Laws, and full of Popish superstition, and
so directly contrary to the Kings Declaration, And against the High Commission,
as a judicatory established contrary to the Laws and Liberties of this Church
and Kingdom, and destructive of other lawful judicatories, which both in
respect of the nature of it, and manner of introduction, without consent of the
three Estates of Parliament, cannot be any ways rectified, but absolutely
discharged: Tertio, we protest, That we adhere with our hearts to our Oath and
subscription of the Confession of Faith, the solemn Covenant between God,
this Church and Kingdom, and the clauses particularly therein expressed and
generally contained, and to our last Articles for the peace of this Kirk and
Kingdom, drawn out of it, and to all the matters therein contained, and
manner of remedy therein desired. Quarto, We protest, that this Proclamation or
act of Council, or any other act, or Proclamation, or Declaration, or
ratification thereof, By subscription, or act, or letter, or any other manner
of way whatsoever, or any precondemnation of our cause or carriage, before the
same be lawfully heard and tried in the supreme judicatories of this Kirk and
Kingdom, the only proper judges to national causes and proceedings, or any
certification or threatening therein denounced, shall no ways be prejudicial
to the Confession of Faith, laws, and liberties of this Kingdom, nor to our
supplications, complaints, protestations, articles, lawful meetings,
proceedings, pursuits, mutual defenses, nor to our persons and Estates, and
shall no ways be disgraceful either in reality or opinion, at home or abroad,
to us or any of us: But on the contrary, that any act, or letter, or
subscription of the Council, carrying the approbation of the declaration, and
condemnation of our proceedings, indicta causa, is and ought to be repute and
esteemed unjust, illegal and null, as here before God and man we offer to
clear, and to verify both the justice of our cause and carriage, and the
injustice of such acts against us, in the face of the first general Assembly
of the Church and Parliament of the Estates, unto whom with all solemnities
requisite, we do publikly appeal. Quinto, We protest, that seeing our former
supplications, last Articles, and our last desire and petition to his Majesty's
Commissioner, which petitioned for the present indiction of a free general
Assembly and Parliament, according to the law and custom of all nations, and
of this nation in the like case, to hear the desires, ease the grievances, and
settle the fears of the body of the Church and Kingdom, are thus delayed, and
in effect refused, to wit, Once for all, till his Majesty's convenience for the
end contained in this Proclamation, that We continue by their presents to
supplicate his Majesty again and again, for the granting of the same: And
whatsoever trouble or inconvenience fall out in this land in the mean time, for
want of these ordinary remedies, and by the practice of any of these
innovations and evils, contrary to our supplications, articles, and confession,
it be not imputed unto us, who most humbly beg these lawful remedies, but also
that it is, and shall be lawful unto us, to defend and maintain the Religion,
laws and liberties of this Kingdom, the Kings Authority in defense thereof,
and every one of us one another in that cause, of maintaining the Religion, and
the Kings foresaid Authority, according to our power, vocation and Covenant,
with our best counsel, bodies, lives, means, and whole strength, against all
persons whatsoever, and against all external or internal invasions menaced in
this Proclamation. Like as that in the great exigencie of the Church,
necessitating the use of this ordinary and lawful remedies, for settling the
commotions thereof, it is and shall be leasome unto us to appoint, hold and use
the ordinary means, our lawful meetings and Assemblies of the Church agreeble
to the Law of God, and practice of the primitive Church, the Acts of the
general Assemblies, and Parliaments, and the example of our Worthy Reformers
in the like case. Sexto, We protest, that our former Supplications, Complaints,
Protestations, Confessions, meetings, proceedings and mutual defenses of every
one another in this cause, as they are, and were in themselves most necessary,
and orderly means agreeable to the laws and practice of this Church and
Kingdom, to be commended as real duties of faithful Christians, loyal
Subjects, and sensible members of the body of the Church and Kingdom, and no
wise to be styled nor accounted great disorders, misdemeanors, blind
disobedience under pretext of Religion, and running headlong into ruin, etc.
So they proceeded only from conscience of our duty to God, our King, native
Country, and our posterity, and does tend to no other end, but to the
preservation of the true reformed Religion, the confession of Faith, Laws, and
Liberties of this His Majesty's most ancient Kingdom, and of His Majesty's
authority in defense thereof, and satisfaction of our humble desires, contained
in our Supplications, complaints and articles, unto the which we adhere again
and again, as we would eschew the curse of the Almighty God, following the
breach of his Covenant: And yet we do certainly expect, according to the Kings
Majesty his accustomed goodness and justice, that His sacred Majesty after a
true information of the justice of our cause and carriage, will presently
indict these ordinary remedies of a free Assembly and Parliament, to our just
Supplications, complaints, and articles, which may be expected, and uses to be
granted from so just and gracious a King, toward most loyal and dutiful
Subjects, calling for redress of so pressing grievances, and praying heartily
that His Majesty may long and prosperously reign over us.

WHereupon a Noble Earl, John Earl of Cassles, etc. in name of the Noblemen,
M. Alexander Gibson younger of Dury in name of the Barons, James Fletcher
Provost of Dundy in name of the Borrowes, M. John Ker Minister at Salt-Prestoun
in name of the Ministers, and Master Archbald Johnston, Reader hereof, in name
of all who adheres to the Confession of Faith and Covenant lately renewed
within this Kingdom, took Instruments in the hands of three Notars present,
at the said market Cross of Edinburgh, being environed with great numbers of
the foresaid Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Borrows, Ministers and Commons,
before many hundred witnesses, and craved the extract thereof: And in token of
their dutiful respect to his Majesty, confidence of the equity of their cause,
and innocence of their carriage, and hope of his Majesty's gracious
acceptance, they offered in all humility, with submisse reverence, a Copy
thereof to the Herald.

NOw We must appeal to the judgment of the world, whether there was any thing
in this Our Proclamation which deserved such an undutifull and rebellious
Protestation, or the seditious clamours, which both at their private and
public meetings, especially in their Pulpits, were made against it.

This Protestation needs no answer; for after the first part of it, which is
nothing but a repetition of that which they have so often said, there is
nothing but a number of falsities heaped up together, as the Reader may easily
perceive: For whereas they allege, That they have removed the impediment which
caused their Covenant to be mistaken, as if it had been an unlawful
combination; We suppose that thereby they mean that which they tendered to Our
Commissioner, and called it by the name of an explication of their Covenant;
which explication was so far from giving unto Us any satisfaction, that both
to Us and all reasonable men it must needs appear to be a stronger
confirmation of their unlawful combination: For whereas they refused to except
Us out of the number of those persons against whom their band of mutual
maintenance is intended, it plainly demonstrateth, that in their intentions We
are the person chiefly aimed at. In some few lines after this, they profess
that they never so much as called in question Our resolution to maintain the
Religion professed in that kingdom, and Our care for not admitting any
Innovations in Religion, or any stain of Popish superstition: Now We do
appeal even to their own consciences, whether in their private meetings, nay
even in their public assemblies and Sermons, they have not endeavored to
settle in Our good subjects minds opinions, fears, and jealousies, quite
contrary to these their printed asseverations. In the last part they ground
their Protestation upon no grounds but such as these: That they will continue
together, because they have obliged themselves by oath so to do, and because
they will and are resolved to adhere constantly to what they have done, and
because they offer to clear themselves before a general Assembly and
Parliament, where they themselves make account to be Judges. Now these and such
like false and weak grounds it is very unnecessarie to confute, the rehearsal
of them being upon the first view, their sufficient conviction. After all
these, they end their Protestation with two very unsavourie conclusions: The
first is, that if We will not allow of their proceedings, they themselves will
call a General Assembly, which shall be sure to allow of them. A notable piece
of hypocrisy and disloyalty together, to be suitors to Us for that which they
(as they say) both may do and are resolved to do without Our leave: The
second is, they protest, that, notwithstanding any thing which We do or shall
say to the contrary, all their proceedings are in themselves most necessary,
and orderly means, agreeable to the Laws and practice of that Church and
Kingdom, to be commended as real duties of faithful Christians, loyal
subjects, and sensible members of the body of that Church and Kingdom, and no
way to be styled or accounted great disorders, misdemeanors, blind
disobedience, under pretext of Religion, and running headlong into ruin: All
which words are multiplied, only to make up a very unmannerly contradiction
to the very words of Our Proclamation.

Our Commissioner seeing, not that he was not able to give, but that they were
resolute not to receive any satisfaction by what was offered, and that the most
that they could be brought to, was that which they called an explication of
their Covenant, but indeed was none; for they would never yield that these
words, whereby in their Covenant they bound themselves in a mutual defense
against all persons whatsoever, should admit this interpretation ( Except the
King:) He told them plainly, that since his Instructions were out, he could
proceed no further with them without new conference with, and Instructions from
Us; and therefore he resolved a speedy journey to Us, to inform Us of what
had passed, and make Us acquainted with that explication of their Covenant
which they had given him, though as it had given no satisfaction to himself,
so he was sure it would give none to Us: In the mean time, he entreated them
to behave themselves more quietly and peaceably then they had done, until Our
pleasure were further known.

That pretended explication of their Covenant was conceived by way of Petition,
and was this.

To His Majesty's Commissioner: The supplication of the Noblemen, Barons,
Burgesses, Ministers and Commons here attending His Majesty's gracious answer
of our former petitions, complaints, and desires,
Humbly showing,
THat whereas we expecting from your Grace, as His Majesty's Commissioner, a
gracious answer of our former supplications, complaints and just desires, have
presented to your Grace a petition, humbly craving a free general Assembly and
Parliament, as the ordinary remedy of our grievances, and the only mean to
put this Kirk and Kingdom to quietness, It pleased your Grace to show, that
His Majesty, from His princely care of this Kirk and Kingdom, would be most
willing to indict a free general Assembly, and call a Parliament for those
good ends, but that your Grace, as His Majesty's Commissioner, has conceived
the Confession of faith, and Covenant lately renewed by us His Majesty's
subjects, to be an unlawful combination against Authority; thereby to cast off
our dutiful obedience, and not a Covenant for maintaining of true Religion, of
His Majesty's Person and Authority, and of the Laws and Liberties of the
Kingdom. And we being most willing to remove that, as the maine hinderance of
the obtaining of our desires; Therefore, and for clearing of our loyalty, and
vindicating our selves from so great an imputation, We do now in all humility
remonstrate to your Grace, as His Majesty's Commissioner, and declare before
God and men, that we are heartily grieved and sorry, that any good man, but
most of all that our dread Sovereign should so conceive of our doing: And that
we were, and still are so fa^re from any thought of withdrawing our selves from
our dutiful subjection, and obedience to His Majesty's government, which by
the descent, and under the reign of 107 Kings, is most cheerfully acknowledged
by us and our predecessors, that we never had, nor have any intention or
desire to attempt any thing that may turn to the dishonor of God, or
diminution of the Kings greatness and authority. But on the contrary, we
acknowledging our quietness, stability and happiness to depend upon the
safety of the Kings Majesty, as upon Gods Vicegerent set over us for
maintenance of Religion, and ministration of Justice, have solemnly sworn, not
only our mutual concurrence and assistance for the cause of Religion, but
also to the uttermost of our power, with our means and lives, to stand to the
defense of our dread Sovereign the Kings Majesty, His Person and Authority,
in the preservation and defense of the true Religion, Liberties and Laws of
the Kingdom. And therefore, we His Majesty's loyal subjects, free from that
and all other imputations of that kind, most humbly beseech your Grace to
esteem that our Confession of Faith and Covenant, to have been intended, and
to be the largest testimony of our fidelity to God, and loyalty to our King:
And that hinderance being removed, must still supplicate that your Grace would
be pleased to indict a free general Assembly and Parliament, which will
undoubtedly redress all our evils, settle the peace of the Kirk and Kingdom,
and procure that cheerfulness of obedience which ought to be rendered to His
Majesty, carrying with it the offer of our fortunes, and best endeavors for
His Majesty's honor and happiness, as a real testimony of our thankfulness,
and our hearty prayers to God that His Majesty may long and prosperously
reign over us.

NOw, does this Petition deserve the name of an explication of their Covenant?
much less of such an explication as should give either Us or Our Commissioner
any satisfaction? No, for it contains neither more nor less then this, that
they do not mean to shake off their obedience, if We will give way to all
their courses, which by this Petition they justify; so that their meaning is,
that they will continue obedient subjects, if We will part from Our
Soveraigntie; which is in effect, that they will obey if We will suffer them
to command. But where it was expected that to these words of their Covenant,
whereby they bind themselves to mutual maintenance, against all persons
whatsoever, should have been added, except the King and his successors, that
was refused, though even that could have given no satisfaction, unless We
should give way to that which diverse Acts of Parliament have made sedition, and
punishable with death.

Upon notice given by Our Commissioner of his intended departure, the
debatements at their Table grew very hot and fiery upon this point, Whether
they should presently indict a General Assembly, and fall upon the violent
courses intended by them, or that they should grant some short time for his
journey, his stay with Us, his return to them again, with Our final answer
and last resolution; and in the mean time promise that they would behave
themselves quietly and peaceably, and continue all things in statu quo until
his return. This last was agreed unto, though not without much contrariety of
voices, and so some of the principal Covenanters came and acquainted him with
this their resolution, which was, That they would expect Our answer, and his
return upon the fifth of August next at the furthest; until which time they
would break up their great meeting, contain themselves and the people in
quietness and peace; but if by that day he did either not return, or not bring
with him from Us such an answer as they expected, then they would hold
themselves free, and go on to prosecute the courses which they had resolved
upon. And so Our Commissioner begun his journey toward Us.

After Our Commissioner had at Greenwich made Us fully acquainted with all
their insolences, We speedily dispatched him with new Instructions, and
commanded him to return, so that he might be back in Scotland by the fifth of
August, and gave him order for the indicting both of a General Assembly and a
Parliament, but so, that he should first be fully satisfied, by all
informations which he could conveniently receive, of the constitution of a
General Assembly, with which perhaps many were not acquainted, none having
been kept for diverse years: And therefore it did require good deliberation,
to agree both upon the members of the Assembly (not for their persons but for
their quality) and of what things were usually treated and handled there.

No sooner was he returned into Scotland, but he found all things in much worse
case, and in a far greater combustion then he left them: For he found that
the heads of the faction (being afraid that he might bring back with him some
satisfactory accommodation, which Our subjects might like well, but they
themselves resolved to reject) had in the time of his absence assured their
followers, that they might compass their ends by such means and upon such
conditions as themselves desired: Nay, they proceeded so far, as to make the
people believe what they knew to be most untrue, viz. That Our Commissioner was
well satisfied with all their proceedings, and especially with their Covenant,
in regard of the late explication they had made of it; and were so impudent as
to use that inducement for an argument, whereby they persuaded many of all
sorts, especially of the Ministers, who had formerly stood out against their
Covenant, to enter into it, in this short time of his absence from them; And
the three Ministers in their answers to the Queries of the Divines of Aberdene,
had the boldness to print, that Our Commissioner rested satisfied with their
Covenant, according to their explication of it: With which their notorious
calumny he found himself so highly injured, in a point which so much
concerned his loyalty to Us, and the trust reposed in him by Us, they he was
enforced to call the Lords of Our Council, diverse others of Our Nobility, and
some of the Lords Covenanters themselves, to give testimony of his frequent
asseverations in their hearing, that as he himself was no way satisfied with
that explication, so he was assured that We neither would nor could receive any
satisfaction by it, only that he would present it to Us at their entreatie: And
besides the attestation of so many witnesses, he was necessitated, both for
clearing of himself to Us, and preventing the further increase of Covenanters,
upon that false and groundless surmise, to print a Manifest and Declaration of
his own clearness and their calumny.

It is true that they printed a weak answer to that Manifest, in which they
confess, that they never heard him say that he was satisfied with that
Declaration, but that by some probable reasons (which are there expressed, and
indeed are most improbable ones) they were induced to believe that he was
satisfied with it, although that both to their new Proselytes, and in the
Ministers printed answers, they had positively averred, that after he had
received that explication he was fully satisfied with their Covenant: Which
dealing of theirs gave occasion for many to think, that this false aspersion
was put upon him, by those who ever labored to strangle all hopes of
reconciliation, only to raise in Us a distrustful jealousy of his service,
that so he might be called back, and the people made believe that no relieving
of their grievances was intended by Us.

About the same time a great stir was raised in that Kingdom upon a very
slender ground, which was this: There had been printed at Antwerpe in several
pieces* the pictures of the several stories of the Gospels, and Acts of the
Apostles, after the manner as they are usually printed in the Romish Church;
some Papists, and it may be others, had caused these several pieces to be
bound in their Bibles, at the several chapters of those stories to which they
did relate; they found such a Bible printed at Edinburgh, which being printed
(as all Bibles are) by Our privilege, upon a sudden there were made most
tragical complaints, that pictures and images were brought into their Bibles
by Our authority, aggravated by the heads of that faction, especially the
Ministers, with the imminent dangers of the present introduction of Popery,
Superstition, and Idolatry, still to make the people averse from all hope of
satisfaction; so that some did conceive, that these pictures might be bound in
that Bible by some of themselves, merely to irritate the people, and continue
them in their distance from returning to Our obedience: but so far with this
particular we cannot charge them.

Now, notwithstanding these new and daily emergent combustions, and their
perpetual working of the people, both in their Pulpits and at their other
meetings, to new insolences and greater heights of rage and fury, Our
Commissioner resolved (as well as he could) to pass them over, and to enter
into treaty with them for the preparative overtures of a General Assembly,
because he did see that all these impediments and blocks were laid purposely in
his way, that either he might stumble at them, or be so scared as to go back;
for it was plainly perceived, that whenever he made any proposition of
peace, likely to take or please, they presently cast about how to dash it with
some new violence and accident which should make it impossible, as did most
evidently appear in this particular.

Our Commissioner sent some of Our Council to confer with some of the
principal Covenanters, concerning some necessary propositions fit to be
resolved upon before the indicting of the Assembly* both concerning the
members of which it was to be constituted, and concerning the matters to be
treated of in it, (two consultations usually previous to that meeting, for the
omission whereof in one Assembly of later times, they had so grievously
complained, that in a Petition exhibited by the Ministers of their side, it was
alleged for a nullitie of that Assembly:) This message was received with so
much choler and contempt, that they presently blazed it abroad amongst their
followers, for a proposition tending utterly to the ruin of the Laws and
liberties both of Church and Kingdom, that the harkening to any such overtures
was an absolute prelimitation of that Assembly, which they intended should be
free and general, that neither of the members of their Assembly, nor of the
matters to be handled in it, they would speak so much as one word until they
came upon the place, and were in the Assembly; that then and there the
Assembly it self was to be the sole judge both of the competencie of the
members elected, of the regularitie of their election, and of all matters
treated of there, whether they were of their cognizance and jurisdiction or
not, and likewise gave out, that they did not much care whether Our
Commissioner would indict an Assembly or not: they would indeed like it better
if it were indicted by Our authority, but if We, requested by them so to do,
should refuse it, they both could and would do it of themselves: Then did their
Pulpits again begin to ring with this monstrous proposition, as they called
it, of the utter subversion of the liberties of their Church, by the
prelimitation of their Assembly, as if this conference propounded by Our
Commissioner concerning the orderly proceedings in that meeting, had been such
a blow to their Church, as they could not fear a greater from Rome it self.

And to make Our Commissioner believe that they were in good earnest, they had
a little before caused the Presbytery of Peebles to begin with the election
for their Commissioners to the General Assembly, being a place not above
twenty miles distant from Edinburgh, so that they were sure it must speedily
come to his knowledge: To this election all the Gentlemen within the compass
of that Presbytery resorted, intruded themselves by violence, and in despite
of the Ministers would give their voices to the choosing both of the Ministers
and one layman to be Commissioners for that Presbytery at the next Assembly,
whenever, and wheresoever it should be kept, when as yet no Assembly was
indicted.

Our Commissioner weighing well these two things; First, that the principal
Covenanters, Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Ministers, as he had occasion to speak
with them severally, and upon several occasions, had protested unto him, that
their meaning never was quite to abolish Episcopal government, but only to
have it limited and restricted, according to the Laws of that Church and
Kingdom, and that they might be accomptable to, and censurable by the
General Assembly, if they should transgress these limits; adding, that they
had far rather live under that government, then under the tyranny of the
Presbyeries, which they had heard their fathers so much complain of, and had
given them charge to beware of; the like Protestations they having likewise
made to diverse of Our Council, and others: And secondly, considering that he
now found that they begun to speak more sparingly and reservedly in that point,
and would not so much as treat of it before the Assembly, and that some of
them had given out, that they had resolved upon a way to throw off that
grievous burden of the Presbyteries, with the weight whereof their fathers
were so much grieved, viz. by joining so many Laick Elders to every Presbytery
as there should be Ministers in it, by which means the Laity should be able
to keep the Presbytery under, without the help of Bishops. Our Commissioner
was now once again at a stand, not knowing how to proceed, as not being
sufficiently warranted by Our instructions to indict a General Assembly or
Parliament, unless he should first be satisfied by advice of them who
understood the forms of Assemblies, what course was to be held, both for the
members of that Assembly, and the manner of their election, and for a previous
consultation of the principal things to be treated there; all which
consultations the Covenanters did utterly reject: He therefore resolved once
again to make a journey to Us, and acquaint Us with these new occurrences,
since he found them daily increasing in their obstinacy, and so changed, as
he was not able to make any judgment, either of their resolutions, or desires,
or of what would give them satisfaction.

And therefore Our Commissioner told them plainly, that he had no authority
from Us to indict an Assembly, unless some particulars were agreed upon, both
concerning the constitution of the Assembly, the present settling the peace of
the Kingdom, and the righting and restoring to their places such Ministers as
had been displaced without order of Law, who might again be displaced, if at
the Assembly they were found to deserve it: The sum of Our demands he
delivered to the chief Lords Covenanters in these ten Articles, which will be
found by the reading of them to be very just and reasonable.













1606. Moderators of Presbyteries being found necessary members of the
Assembly, every one of the said Moderators be appointed to be Commissioner
from that Presbytery where he is Moderator.



whatsoever, meddle in the choice, nor no Minister without his own Presbytery.



And since his Majesty is still displeased with the Covenant, wisdom and our
dutiful obedience to our Sovereign require, that some such course should be
taken, whereby his Majesty may receive satisfaction therein; and in the mean
time, that there be no pressing, threatening, or persuading of men to subscribe
the Covenant, nor no mention be made thereof any more in Pulpits.

To these (according to their usual manner) they would no way condescend, but
returned to Our Commissioner these most unjust and unreasonable answers.

Answers to the particulars propounded by his Majesty's Commissioner.
HAving seriously considered with our selves, that nothing in this world is so
precious, and ought to be so dear unto us as our Religion, that the diseases
of the Church after long toleration did threaten no less then her utter ruin,
and the expiring of the truth of Religion at last, and that a free General
Assembly was the ordinary remedy appointed by divine Authority, and blessed
by divine providence in other Churches, and after a special manner in the
Church of Scotland; we have often, and earnestly supplicated for the same, and
have labored to remove what was objected, or what we could conceive to be any
hinderance to the obtaining of our desire, like as we have now for the same
good end resolved to return this answer to the particulars propounded, to be
performed by us before any Assembly be indicted.

The particulars propounded, are either concerning matters Ecclesiastical, or
Civil: Ecclesiastical, or Church matters are, The first, concerning Ministers
deposed or suspended by the Presbyteries, since the first of February last,
without warrant of the Ordinary, that they be restored to their own places.
The second, concerning Moderators of Presbyteries deposed since the foresaid
day, to be restored, and all Moderators appointed by the said Presbyteries
without warrant aforesaid, to desist from executing the office of Moderator.
The third, concerning Ministers admitted since the foresaid day, that they
desist from exercising the function of the Ministry in that place, to which
they have been admitted. These three particulars do concern the power, duty,
and particular facts, or faults of Presbyteries, wherein we have no power to
judge or determine, whether they have proceeded lawfully or not, far less
can we urge or command them to recall what they have determined or done, in the
suspending, deposing, or admitting of Ministers, or Moderators; they being
properly subject to the superior Assemblies of the Church; and in this case and
condition of the Church, to the General Assembly, where, if they shall not
after trial justify their proceedings, from the good warrants of Scripture,
reason, and the acts and praclices of the Church, they ought to sustain their
own deserved censure. And since on the one side, there be many complaints
against the Prelates for their usurpation over Presbyteries in the like
particulars; and on the other side, there be such complaints of the doings and
disorders of the Presbyteries, to the offense of the Prelates; we trust that his
Majesty's Commissioner will not esteem this to be any hinderance of the
indiction of a General Assembly, but rather a powerful and principal motive
with speed to conveene the same, as the proper Judicatorie wherein to determine
such dangerous and universal differences of the Church. Neither do we hear
that any Ministers are deposed, but only suspended, during this Interim till a
General Assembly, for their erroneous doctrine and flagitious life; So that
it were most Is it not rather an offense to God, to thrust men out of their
places before they be tried?
offensive to God, disgraceful to Religion, and scandalous to the people, to
restore them to their places till they be tried, and censured. And concerning
Moderators, none of them (as we understand) are deposed, but some only
changed, which is very ordinary in this Church. The fourth, concerning the
repairing of Parishioners to their own Church, and that Elders assist the
Ministers in the discipline of the Church, ought to be cognosced and judged by
the particular Presbyteries, to which the Parishioners and Elders are subject,
since the cause may be in the Ministers no less then in the Parishioners and
Elders. And in case they find no redress there, to assent till they come to a
General Assembly, the want whereof makes disorders to be multiplied, both
in Presbyteries and particular Parishes.

To the sixth, That ministers wait upon their own Churches, and that none of
them come to the Assembly, or place where the same is kept, but such as shall
be chosen Commissioners from Presbyteries, we answer, That none are to come to
the place of the Assembly, And yet afterward, in their last instructions they
enjoined the several Commissioners to bring Assessors with them, who were to
have no voice in the Assembly.
but such as are either allowed by Commission to have voice, or otherwise have
such interesse as they can justify to his Majesty's Commissioner, and the
Assembly conveened.

To the seventh, Concerning the appointing of Moderators of Presbyteries to be
Commissioners to the General Assembly, only constant Moderators, who have
ceased long since, were found in the Assembly 1606. (which yet was never
reputed by the Church to be a lawful national Assembly) to be necessary
members of the General Assembly. And if both the Moderators, who if they be
necessary members need not to be chosen, and the chosen Commissioners repair
to the Assembly, the Assembly it self can judge best of the members whereof
it ought to consist.

To the ninth, That no lay-person whatsoever meddle with the choosing of
Commissioners from the Presbyteries, and no Minister without his own
Presbytery, we say, That according to the order of our Church discipline, none
but Ministers, and Elders of Churches ought to have voice in choosing
Commissioners from Presbyteries, and that no Minister, or Elder should have
voice in Election, but in his own Presbytery.

The rest of the particulars are concerning civil matters: As the fifth
concerning the paying of Rents and Stipends to Ministers and Bishops,
concerning which we can say no further, but that the laws are patent for them,
as for his Majesty's other subjects, and that the General Assembly ought not
to be delaied upon any complaint in that kind.

The eighth, requiring that Bishops, and Ministers be secured in their persons,
we think so reasonable, that we will promise every one of us for our own
parts, they shall suffer no violence from us, and that we shall hinder others
so far as we may; And if any trouble them otherwise, or make them any kind
of molestation in that attendance but by order of Law, the parties are justly
punishable according to the degree of their fault as other subjects are.

To the tenth, concerning the dissolving of all Convocations and meetings, and
the peaceablenesse of the Country; These meetings being kept for no other end,
but for consulting about lawful remedies against such pressing grievances as
threaten the desolation of this Church and State, cannot be dissolved till the
evils be removed. And The contrary is most true.
we trust, that nothing in these our meetings has escaped us, which carries
in it the smallest appearance of undutifulnesse, or which may seem to tend to
the breach of the common peace: But although our adversaries have herein
calumniated us, yet we have always so behaved our selves, as beseemed his
Majesty's most humble and loyal subjects, petitioning his Majesty for a
legal redress of our just grievances.

To the last, concerning the Covenant; the Commissioner his Grace having many
times and most instantly pressed us with that point, we did first by Our
Commissioner never heard any argument to that purpose which could convince a
child.
invincible arguments make manifest, that we could not, without sinning
against God, and our own consciences, and without doing wrong to this
National Church, and all posterity, rescind or alter the same: And thereafter
did at large clear the same of all unlawful combination against Authority,
by our last Supplication and Declaration, which his Majesty's Commissioner Our
Commissioner never accepted of it, nor conceived it could give satisfaction to
any.
accepted, as the most ready and powerful of all other means, which could
come within the compass of our thought to give his Majesty satisfaction, The
subscription of this our confession of Faith, and Covenant being an act so
evidently tending to the It does most evidently tend to the dishonor of God.
glory of God, the Kings honor, and happiness of the Kingdom: And having
already proved so comfortable to us in the inward of our hearts, It is our
ardent and constant desire, and ready wish, that both his Majesty and all his
good subjects may be partakers of the same comfort, Like as we find our selves
bound by conscience, and by the Covenant it self, to persuade all his
Majesty's good subjects to join with us for the good of Religion, his Majestes
honor, and the quietness of the Kingdom: which being modestly used by us
without pressing, or threatening of the meanest, we hope shall never give his
Majesty the least cause of discontent.

Seeing therefore, according to our power and interesse, we are most willing
to remove all hindrances, that things may be carried in a peaceable manner,
worthy our Profession, and Covenant, do aim at nothing but the good of the
Kingdom, and preservation of the Church, which by consumption, or combustion,
is like to be desperately diseased, except remedy some way be speedily
provided; And we delight to use no other means, but such as are legal, and
have been ordinary in this Church, since the Reformation: We are confident
that without further delay, for preventing of greater evils and miseries then
we can express, our just desires shall be granted. So shall we be encouraged
in the peace of our souls, still to pray for his Majesty, all increase of true
honor, and happiness.

UPon their refusal, he sent for some of the chief Lords Covenanters, and
told them of his resolution for a new journey; that he found their ways such
as he could not go along with them; that he had power to grant them a free
General Assembly, but that he could not conceive that to be a free one, in
which they should bring in every man to have a voice whom they had a mind to:
If they would let him know what manner of persons should sit there, and what
they intended to do there, he would give his best concurrence, if he found
their intentions to be agreeable to the laws and customs of that Church and
Kingdom; if they rejected these motions, he knew nothing left for him, but to
return back again to Us, yet he desired them before his journey they would let
him know what it was they would have, and that they would express what was the
uttermost of that which they desired from Us, without which they would not rest
satisfied; that with their desires he would make Us acquainted, and that within
a few days he would either return to them himself with Our answer, or
otherwise it should be speedily sent unto them.

Their answer to Our Commissioner was, that they would make their Tables
acquainted with his proposition, and he should shortly receive their answer: At
their Tables it was much debated, whether he should have any further time
allowed him for a new journey, and a speedy return, or if they should leave
him to his own choice and counsels, and they in the mean time to indict a
General Assembly, and go on with the prosecution of their intended
resolutions: At last, not without contrariety of suffrages in this also, it
was by most voices concluded, that to give the people satisfaction, they would
yet forbear the indicting of the Assembly until the 21. day of September,
before which time, if he or some other did not return with such answer as
should content them, then they would hold themselves free to go on with their
designs: And for expressing their desires, or what satisfaction they expected
from Us, they would not descend to particulars, only they looked for a free
General Assembly, and a Parliament, in which two great Courts their desires
should be made known; And this being all the answer Our Commissioner could
obtain from them, he told them that he would report it to Us, and intended
presently to begin his journey.

No sooner were they parted from him, but they betook themselves to their old
courses, both of incensing the people, and dashing in Our Commissioner all hope
of doing any good in this service: The first they did by scattering a report
amongst their followers, that Our Commissioner neither had power from Us, nor
any intention in himself to give them any satisfaction, but that he only
delayed time, until all things might be in a ripeness and readiness for
their ruin, an evident argument whereof was, that now he had taken two
journies thither, and yet had never offered any thing, nor were they in better
case then before he was sent unto them: A thing which they knew to be most
untrue, both because in Our last Declaration We had granted them very many
things concerning their pretended grievances, which We had not granted before,
being the same things which at first they only desired; as likewise because
Our Commissioner had now lately tendered them in writing ten propositions, upon
the yielding to which he would presently indict an Assembly: But that was all
one with them, for so they could persuade the people that nothing yet had been
offered at all to content them, they cared not by what reports (true or false)
that persuasion were wrought in them: Our Commissioner, to assure the people
that he intended really, and endeavored their content, if possibly it might be
effected upon any reasonable terms, contracted his former propositions into
these two (which We here insert) and caused many copies of them to be dispersed
through the City, that so the people might not be kept from the knowledge of
Our favor toward them.

IF the Lords and the rest will undertake for themselves and the rest,

If they will undertake that at the Assembly they shall not go about

Then I will presently indict a General Assembly, and promise, upon my Honor,
immediately after the Assembly to indict a Parliament, which shall cognosce of
all their complaints.

THis did so irritate their Leaders, that they presently entered upon a course
that should put Our Commissioner out of hope of ever doing any good in this
service; for they presently gave order, even before the beginning of his
journey, for the election of the Commissioners to the General Assembly
throughout the whole Kingdom, to be made before his return, or the indicting
of an Assembly; which caused him presently to send for the chief of the
Covenanters, and absolutely to tell them, That if they did proceed to the
election of any Commissioners for the Assembly before his return, he would not
go his journey at all; he would not move Us for a General Assembly, nor for
any thing else; he would leave them to their own ways; as a private man he
would stay in the Kingdom and expect the issue of their counsels: Which
resolution of his, because it should not be concealed from the people, he
caused likewise by many copies of it in writing to be divulged amongst them:
This his determination these Lords Covenanters to whom he delivered it,
communicated to their Tables, who were very stiff in their former conclusion
for the present election of Commissioners; yet because they could not well
perceive how to satisfy the people, if they should break off all treaty upon
such a nice point, it was at the last agreed unto, and talked of as a singular
favor done to Our Commissioner, that the election of the Commissioners to the
Assembly should be delayed until his return, which We pray the Reader to
observe, because it shall be known at his return, with what a horrible
equivocation they did elude this their promise.

Before Our Commissioner begun his journey toward Us, he entered into a serious
consultation with Our chief officers of State and principal Counselors
there, what further advice they had to recommend by him unto Us, for the
settling of the peace of that Kingdom, since they clearly perceived that all
Our royal and gracious intentions to that people were frustrated, by the
rebellious and obstinate courses of some few who misse-led the rest; and since
he could not possibly draw from the Covenanters their designs, nay, nor their
desires, whereby he might learn what they expected for their satisfaction, he
desired of them their best counsel, and that he with them might conceive in
writing what they supposed would reduce the Kingdom to peace and quietness,
and without which they thought it could not be effected, but by force and
arms, which he was sure We would never use, but in an unavoidable extremity,
and for the preservation of Our Crown and dignity. This Our Commissioner did
not adventure to communicate with the whole Council, because he did know that
some of Our Councillors were Covenanters in their hearts, though for dangerous
ends, they had forborne the subscribing of the Covenant with their hands, and
that they would acquaint the Covenanters with it, with whom they kept private
meetings.

This proposition being much debated amongst these Councillors, they fell upon
that way which they conceived would fully satisfy, or else none could; which
was this: Since the Covenanters would not express their own desires in
particulars, they thought best to take an exact view of all their petitions,
remonstrances, grievances, declarations, protestations either written or
printed, which they had since the first beginning of these troubles exhibited
to Our selves, Our Commissioner, Our Council; and to extract out of them the
particulars of all their grievances and desires, and to represent them unto Us.

And besides all these, We being assured by Our Commissioner, that the
principal motive which the heads of the Covenanters had used to Our people for
alienating their minds from Us, was that false opinion of Our averseness from
the Religion Reformed, and of Our inclination to Popery: We resolved, above all
that was desired, to take a course which should give Our subjects full and
unquestionable satisfaction in that point; and therefore propounding unto Our
self, the example of Our Royal Father, We concluded to command and urge the
renewing of that Confession of Faith, which was first framed and afterward
renewed in His name, by which means We made account that We should both
benefit Our Subjects and right Our self: For perceiving that they had grounded
and fathered their spurious Covenant upon that Confession and Covenant urged by
Our Father; We resolved, by this Act of Our authority to legitimate it, that
it being commanded by Us, might save Our people who were to swear it, from
incurring the danger of Our Laws, which have made it very criminal to enter
into any Covenant without Our authority: As also, to vindicate Our self from
that false and wicked aspersion, which the heads of their Covenant had most
seditiously laid upon Us, viz. that We had a resolution either to bring in
Popery, or at least to tolerate it in Our Kingdoms, which though they
themselves did not believe, yet they believed that this was the most powerful
means of alienating the minds of Our people from Us (which they only intended)
if they could possibly work them to that belief. And so both We and Our
Commissioner, who had lately come from them, were persuaded that not only Our
people, but all people in the World, to whose notice it should come, must rest
satisfied; that We could not possibly be that way inclined, if We should
command, and by Our authority effect a new subscription and swearing of that
confession of Faith, which is more directly opposite to Popery then any
Confession besides extant in the World. This being added to the former advice
of Our Council, which was to ease them of all those things which they
pretended to be their principal grievances, We well hoped should have
settled the peace of that Church and Kingdom. For by granting the removing of
those former grievances, without this last superaddition of Our favor, Our
Councillors were persuaded that Our subjects for the most part would be
satisfied, desert their Leaders, and adhere to Us with their lives and
fortunes, as they themselves would do who signed this their Council with
their hands, and sent it up to Us by Our Commissioner.

No sooner was he come to Us at Oatlands, but We were astonished with his
relation of their proceedings; and when he presented unto Us, not only the
improbability, but also the impossibility that ever the Ringleaders of that
Rebellion would desist, until they had obtained their wicked ends, and that
the only hope of peace was placed in dividing the people from them, by
proffering unto the people such gracious favors, as in all likelihood they
neither could nor would reject; and well weighing the advice given unto Us by
Our principal Councillors and Officers of State there, After mature
deliberation with such as We were pleased to call unto Us, and especially at
the humble and earnest importunity of Our Commissioner, so zealously affected
to the peace of Our and his native Country, We did resolve to pursue that
advice of his and Our other Councillors, and did again make a very exact
survey of whatsoever they had petitioned for, from the very first, either of
Us, Our Commissioner, or Council, and resolved to grant them all, and besides
all these, to renew the former Confession of Faith and the Band annexed, which
We made account would have given them satisfaction above all things, especially
in that wherein they had been most wickedly abused, that is, in their opinion
of Our inclination to Popery. The particulars of Our gracious grants unto them
you shall find in Our next Proclamation made after Our Commissioners return
to that Kingdom; whom, within eight days after his coming to Us, We
dispatched back again, overjoyed with Our gracious grants, as making full
account, that he should be received this last time as an Angel of God,
bringing in his mouth the branch both of piety and peace: But how far both We
and he and Our Councillors, and all Our good, religious, loyal, and peaceable
subjects of that Kingdom were deceived herein, the next ensuing narration
(which is almost above credit) will sufficiently declare.

For Our Commissioner, returning before the day agreed upon, he found all
things in the time of his absence so perplexed and imbroyled by the heads of
the Covenanters, who were afraid of nothing so much, as that he should return
with an answer satisfactorie to Our people, that he begun most clearly to
perceive, that these men were resolved that nothing should satisfy them; which
appeared by their whole proceedings in the time of his absence, and especially
in these two particulars: First, whereas they had promised that no election of
Commissioners for the Assembly should be made before the 21. day of September,
the day agreed upon for his return, they gave order that the election should
be made the 22. day of September, being the next day after that, which they
knew was to be passed before he could possibly return Our answer to them:
According to which resolution of theirs, Commissioners for the Assembly were
elected in many Presbyteries upon that day, before any of the Covenanters did,
or could come to know Our answer from Our Commissioner, or before the Assembly
was indicted, which was not until some days after these elections were past:
Now, We desire to know whether ever there were heard a more gross, absurd, and
palpable equivocation then this, and that from men, who would be accounted the
greatest opposites in the world to Popish tenets, and to none more then that of
equivocation. They promise that no election shall be made until Our
Commissioners return, and before such a day; and that promise grounded upon
Our Commissioners resolution before his departure from them, that unless they
would give him that assurance, he would not undertake his journey, nor move Us
any more in this business; but if they would expect his return and Our answer
by that time, he would do both. These holy men resolve to expect that time
before any election shall be actually made, but give order that it shall be
made the next day after, before it could be known in most parts of the
kingdom whether he were returned, or in any part of the kingdom, or by any
person of the kingdom, what answer he had returned from Us: The insinceritie
of which proceedings (condemned by many Covenanting Ministers at their meeting
at Edinburgh for a most desperate equivocation) We are confident every man will
detest, especially in those men who boast themselves to be the only sincere
Professors of these times.

Besides, Our Commissioner found that these men (who would not so much as hear
him speak of any precedent conference of any thing concerning the Assembly, nor
of any directions to be agreed upon for the more orderly proceeding in it, but
cried out against them as unsufferable prelimitations and prejudgings of the
liberties of Christ and his Church) had in the time of his absence at their
Tables agreeed upon certain directions comprehended in eight Articles, which
they had dispersed through the whole kingdom, and commanded to be observed by
the several Presbyteries thereof in their elections; the true copy whereof
here follows.

A direction for Presbyteries.
THat every Presbytery have a copy of the Act made at Dundie 1597. concerning
the number of Commissioners; the tenor whereof follows.

Because there has been no order hitherto anent the number of Commissioners
to be directed from every Presbytery to the General Assembly, therefore it
is statuted and ordained, that in all time coming three of the wisest and
gravest of the Brethren shall be directed from every Presbytery at the most,
as Commissioners to every Assembly, and that none presume to come without
Commission: And likewise, that one be directed from every Presbytery in name
of the Barons, and one out of every Burgh, except Edinburgh, which shall have
power to direct two Commissioners to the General Assembly.

That every Presbytery have a copy of the Commission to be given to the
Commissioners; the tenor thereof follows.

T.T. the day of The which day after calling upon the name of God, We the
members of the Presbytery of having diligently considered the manifold
corruptions, innovations, and disorders, disturbing our peace, and tending to
the overthrow of our Religion, and Liberties of the reformed Church within this
Realm; which has come to pass, especially through the want of the necessary
remedy of General Assemblies, as well ordinary as pro re nata, enjoyed by
this Church for many years, and ratified by Act of Parliament, And now
expecting shortly by the mercy of God the benefit of a free General
Assembly, do by these presents nominate and appoint Minister of as also in
name of the Burrowes, conjunctly and severally our lawful Commissioners,
giving and granting unto them our full power, Commission, and express charge,
to repair to the said Assembly at the day and place, when and where it shall
happen to sit, in any safe and commodious place within this Kingdom, and there
with the rest who shall be authorized with lawful Commission, in our name to
propone, treat, reason, vote, and conclude, according to the word of God, and
confession of faith approved by sundry General Assemblies, and received
throughout the whole Kingdom in all Ecclesiastical matters, competent to a
free General Assembly, and tending to the advancement of the Kingdom of
Christ, and the good of Religion, as they will answer to God, and his Church
thereupon, and to report to us their diligence therein. In testification of
this our Commission and charge, we have subscribed these presents with our
hands, and which they have accepted with the lifting up of their hands.

That every Church Session send one of the most qualified Elders James the 6.
and never since altered nor rescinded; neither can be with reason altered,
seeing that same is the constitution of the supreme and General Assemblies,
and of the inferior and Church Sessions, as is at more length cleared by some
reasons.

That such as are erroneous in doctrine, or scandalous in life,

To send to every Presbytery a copy of the printed reasons

That Moderators by virtue of their office be not Commissioners

That the Presbyteries in one of the ordinary meetings, appoint 21.22.23.24.
or 25. for choosing of their Commissioners to the Assembly, and for to send
them hither to Edinburgh before the first of October, or so soon as they can,
that with common consent, they may receive the Kings last answer, and advise
upon the next lawful remedies, in their extreme necessities of Church and
State.

That in the Fast to be observed on the sixteenth day of September,

TO these eight Articles they joined (by way of information) a very
impertinent, long and tedious discourse of Ruling Elders, too long and too
simple to be here inserted, which was added no doubt only to persuade the
Ministers to admit Laymen to have voices in their Presbyteries at the election
of the Ministers who were to be Commissioners for the Assembly; or in case of
their refusal, to persuade the Laymen to put themselves in possession, and
give their voices in these elections whether the Ministers would or no, as
shall appear afterward, both by that intrusion which these Lay Elders used in
many Presbyteries, where the Ministers refused to admit them, and by some of
the Tables more private instructions, by which they were ordered so to do.

Now, We desire the Reader to consider, whether the conference which Our
Commissioner desired for debating of what members the Assembly was to be
constituted, and the matters which were principally to be discussed there (with
so much bitterness exclaimed against by them) could in any construction or sense
be taken for such a prelimitation of the Assembly, either in the members,
matter, or manner of it, as these eight Articles composed and commanded by
their Tables. In the second Article, they set down to every Presbytery, a
set form of a Commission to be made to their Commissioners, which was never
done before; and at the Assembly, when the several Commissions were read, it
was observed that all the Commissions were the same verbatim, except a very
few from some Presbyteries who would not be ruled by the Table; and gave power
to their Commissioners to continue no longer in the Assembly, then We or Our
Commissioner in Our name should continue it: In the same Article, they will
have the Presbyteries in their Commissions to take it pro confesso, that the
pretended and complained of Innovations are, corruptions and disorders
disturbing the peace, and tending to the overthrow of their Religion and
Liberties within the reformed Church of that Realm: If this be not to
prejudge, and take that for granted, which was to be tried by the Assembly,
whether it was so or not, viz. whether these things complained of were
Innovations and corruptions introduced in Religion, We must leave it to the
Reader to judge. In the third Article they appoint Laymen to sit in
Presbyteries, which had not been done for above forty years before; Nay, and
these Laymen to be equal in number with the Ministers, which is contrary to
their own book of Discipline alleged by them, which did then order that the
Ministers should always exceed the number of the Lay Elders; so that before
this time they never were equal in number: Nay, that these Laymen should have
voices, not only in the choosing of their own Lay Elder, but, which is
insufferable, should have suffrage in the Election of the three Ministers
Commissioners for the Assembly, which they themselves do know was never heard
nor practiced in that Church before, in the very first and strictest times of
reformation, nor ever since. In the fourth Article they order a notable trick
and device of their own to be put in practice, whereby they were ascertained,
that no Minister should be chosen Commissioner in any Presbytery where they
had any power, but such as did undoubtedly concur with them in their
rebellious courses: for they appointed (and accordingly it was practiced) that
every man suspected to be of a different judgment from them, should
presently be process and brought under the scandal of erroneous life or
doctrine, and so made incapable of being chosen Commissioner; according to
which Article there were very few Ministers in the Kingdom, who had not
subscribed their Covenant, but they were presently suspended by their
Presbytery, where they had voices to do it, or at the least put under process
by some one or other* which could not be prevented; for no man can be denied
an original process against any man whom he will implead: But yet this
Article left no evasion, if it should happen that such a one should be chosen
Commissioner, for in this case they ordered, that the rest who gave not voices
should protest against the election, and complain of it to the General
Assembly, where they were sure enough to process him there, and lay him aside
until his process should be discussed; which they did put in practice upon
some Ministers, who did not concur in judgment with them at the first
sitting down of the Assembly. The sixth Article is directly against the
Constitutions of their Church then in force, and till then practiced; the
Moderator of the Presbytery being constantly one, as being most able to give
an account to the Assembly of all Presbyteriall actions. The seventh Article
gives order for practicing the above mentioned equivocation, and enjoyneth them
to make their elections before they received Our answer, and that they repair
to Edinburgh immediately after their election, that all the Commissioners
elected may consult before hand upon what was to be said or done at the
Assembly; which is in effect neither more nor less, then to receive
directions from their Tables how to carry themselves at the Assembly, and
indeed to preconveene and hold the Assembly at Edinburgh before their meeting
at Glasgow.

These were their public instructions which they were not ashamed to avowe and
send abroad from their Tables, as it were by public authority, to the
several Presbyteries of that Kingdom; And whether they do not contain
prelimitations of the Assembly, we shall leave it to the Reader to judge: But
whether, if We, Our Commissioner, or Council, had sent any such directions and
instructions to the several Presbyteries, they would not have exclaimed
against them as unsufferable prelimitations of that Assembly, and prejudgings
of the liberties of the Church of Christ in that Realm, We do appeal even to
their own consciences. And yet these public instructions are nothing to the
private ones, which they durst not communicate to all their party, but only
to some one Laick, and one Minister, their special confidents in every
Presbytery, of which you shall hear more afterward in their due place.

Notwithstanding all these discouragements, arising from the disorderly
proceedings of the Covenanters in the time of his absence, Our Commissioner the
day after the time prefixed for his return, viz. the 22. day of September
1638. assembled Our Council at Our Palace of Holy-rood-house, and there first
delivered unto them this letter from Us, as follows.

Apud Holy-rood-house September. 22. 1638. The which day James Marquess of
Hamiltoun His Majesty's Commissioner, produced and exhibited before the Lords
of Privy Council, the two Missives underwritten, signed by the Kings
Majesty, and directed to the said Lords, which being read, heard, and
considered by the said Lords, They have ordained, and ordaines the same to be
inserted and registered in the books of Secret Council, therein to remain ad
futuram rei memoriam, whereof the tenor follows.
CHARLES R.

RIght trusty etc. being certainly informed that the distractions which have
happened of late, (both in Church and Commonwealth) in this Our ancient
Kingdom of Scotland, have much troubled the minds of many of Our good and
loyal subjects; and that these distractions have been occasioned upon
jealousies and fears of innovation of Religion and Laws, as tending to the
introduction of Popery, and not without some suspicion, as if We Our self
were inclined that way; Upon occasion whereof, many of Our subjects have of
late subscribed a band or Covenant for preserving the true Religion and Laws
already established, and for defending the Kings person, and each others, in
defense thereof: But the same not being warranted by Royal authority (as that
which was in Our dear Fathers time) must needs of it self be ineffectuall*
and much prejudicial to the ancient Form and Custom of government kept
within that Our Kingdom of Scotland: Wherefore We, out of Our inborne love to
Our said native Country, and for obviating these conceived fears, and
satisfying of you, and all Our loving people, have thought good to ordain the
Confession of Faith, and band subjoyned thereto, of the date at Edinburgh,
Januarie 28. 1580. and signed by Our Royal Father to be renewed: And to that
effect have given Order to Our Commissioner, with advice of Our Council, to
set down and settle some solid course, whereby the same may be subscribed by
Our Council, Judges, Magistrates of Burroughes, and all other Our people of
that Kingdom. And for further clearing of Our self, We declare, That as We
are and ever have been satisfied in Our judgment and conscience for the
reformed Religion now established, and against the Roman: so We purpose, by
Gods grace, both to live and die in the practice thereof, and to preserve and
maintain the same in full strength and integrity, according to the Laws of
that Our ancient Kingdom. What We have thought further fitting to be done at
this time, concerning the particulars contained in Our subjects petitions; you
shall receive Our full pleasure therein from Our Commissioner. And that this
Our Declaration concerning Our self, and Our pious intention, for settling the
Reformed Religion within that Our Kingdom may appear to posterity. Our
pleasure is, that these presents be registered in the Books of Council.

Oatlands Septem. 9. 1638.

THis Our Letter being received by Our Council with all submissive, joyful,
and thankful acknowledgment, Our Commissioner made them further acquainted
with the particulars of Our grace and favor, for the appeasing of the troubles
of that Our kingdom, who (upon hearing of the same) were filled with excessive
joy, as making full account that now malice it self could not find the least
pretense of keeping Our people from being satisfied, all things which ever yet
since the beginning of these troubles they had desired, being granted unto
them. But so soon as some of Our Councillors, who were not only Covenanters
in their heart, but the very heart of their Covenant, had made some of the
chief covenanting Lords acquainted with the unexpected excess of Our favors
toward Our people, these Lords, making full account that their reign was upon
the point of expiration if the people should understand Our grace and favor,
bestirred themselves with might and main to disperse rumors amongst them, That
the news brought home by Our Commissioner, importing Our answer, did tend to
the utter subversion of their Religion and liberties; That there was a new
Covenant to be set on foot by Us, to destroy theirs, and that if they now did
not resist, all they had done was quite undone and lost: After which, the
principal of them came down, first, to Our Commissioner, and then to Our
Council, requesting them, or indeed rather requiring them, that they would not
subscribe the Confession of faith, nor require it to be subscribed by others,
by any authority from Us, threatening in a manner, that if they did, they would
repent it, and that a present rupture would follow: Our Commissioner and
Council heard them twice fully, but found not the least ground of reason for
the delay of the declaration of Our grace and favor toward Our people, as
seeing it proceeded only from an earnest desire in these Lords to have it
concealed from them; and therefore resolved, and imparted unto the Lords
covenanters their resolution, that they would publish it that day, being
Saturday. The Lords covenanters did then seem to abate something of their
requests, or rather demands, and desired Our Commissioner and Council to delay
the publishing of Our Declaration only until the Monday following, before
which time, if they could not show good reasons for the stopping of it, they
would be content with the publication thereof: Which motion of theirs wanted
not seconding from some of Our Council there present, who were indeed the
first and chiefest of them: But Our Commissioner and Councillors well and
wisely foreseeing that this delay was desired, first, that these Lords
Covenanters might have time to pen and prepare a Protestation against this Our
gracious Declaration, with the contents whereof some of Our Counselors
(hearty Covenanters) had made them acquainted; which Protestation could not be
provided nor penned in the space of so few hours: secondly, that the Lords
covenanters made no question, but that the next day being Sunday, their
Ministers in all the Pulpits of Edinburgh, by their subornation, should so
conjure up the spirits of Our people against Our gracious Declaration, as they
should not be easily and readily laid again: Thirdly, that they might have
time to dispatch messengers and Poasts abroad with copies of their
Protestation, in all Buroughs where Our Declaration was to be published,
before, or as soon as Our Declaration could be sent to those places: for these
important considerations, Our Commissioner and Council did declare unto these
Lords, after full hearing of them, that considering the invaliditie of their
reasons to the contrary* Our gracious Declaration should be published that day
at the Cross of Edinburgh: And so accordingly Our Declaration that day was
proclaimed, as here it follows.

CHarles, by the grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith.
To Our Lovits, Messengers, Our Sheriffs, in that part conjunctly and
severally specially constitute, greeting.
For So Much as the cause and occasion of all the distractions which have
happened of late both in Church and Commonweal of this Our Kingdom, have
proceeded from the conceived fears of innovation of Religion and Laws: To
free all Our good subjects of the least suspicion of any intention in Us to
innovate any thing, either in Religion or Laws; and to satisfy not only
their desires, but even their doubts, We have discharged, and by these presents
do discharge the Service Book, Book of Canons, and High Commission, and the
practice of them, or any of them: and by these presents annulls and rescinds
all acts of Council, Proclamations, and other acts and deeds whatsoever, that
have been made or published, for establishing them, or any of them, and
declares the same to be null, and to have no force nor effect in time coming.
And being informed, that the urging of the practice of the five articles of
Perth Assembly, has bred great distraction and division in the Church and
State, We have been graciously pleased to take the same into Our
consideration; and for the quiet and peace of Church and State, do not only
dispense with the practice of the said Articles, but also discharge, like as
by these presents We discharge all and whatsoever persons from urging the
practice thereof, upon either Laicke or Ecclesiastical person whatsoever. And
We do hereby free all Our subjects from all censure and pain, whether
ecclesiastical or secular, for not urging, practicing, or obeying the same,
notwithstanding of any thing contained in the acts of Parliament, or general
Assembly to the contrary. And because it has been, to the disgrace of
government, dispersed and surmized throughout this Our kingdom, that some of
Our subjects have exercised such illimited and unwarranted power, and have held
themselves eximed from censure and punishment, to which others Our subjects are
liable, We do by these presents declare, that if any of Our subjects, whether
ecclesiastical or civil, of whatsoever quality, title, or degree, have, or
shall at any time presume to do any such act, or assume to themselves any such
exemption or power, That they shall, like as by these presents We make and
ordain them to be liable to the trial and censure of Parliament, general
Assembly, or any other Judicatories competent, according to the nature and
quality of the offense. And for the free entry of Ministers, that no other
oath be administrate unto them then that which is contained in the act of
Parliament, And to give Our subjects full assurance, that We never intend to
admit of any change or alteration in the true Religion already established and
professed in this Our kingdom, And that all Our good people may be fully and
clearly satisfied of the realitie of Our intentions toward the maintenance of
the truth and integrity of the said Religion, We have thought fit and
expedient to injoine and authorize, like as We by these presents do require
and command all the Lords of Our privy Council, Senators of the College of
Justice, Judges, and Magistrates to burgh and land, and all Our other subjects
whatsoever, to subscribe and renew the Confession of Faith, subscribed at first
by Our dear Father and His household, in the year of God 1580. Thereafter by
persons of all ranks, in the year 1581. by ordinance of the Lords of secret
Council, and acts of the general Assembly. Subscribed again by all sorts of
persons in the year 1590. by a new ordinance of Council at the desire of the
general Assembly, with their general band of maintenance of the true
Religion, and the Kings person. And for that effect We do require the Lords of
Council to take such course anent the foresaid confession and general band,
that it may be subscribed and renewed throughout the whole kingdom with all
possible diligence. And because We will not leave in Our subjects minds the
least scruple or doubt of Our royal intentions and real resolutions, We have
given warrant to Our Commissioner to indict a free general Assembly, to be
holden at Glasgow the twenty first day of November, in this present year 1638.
And thereafter a Parliament to be holden at Edinburgh the fifteenth day of May
Anno 1639. for settling a perfect peace in the Church and Commonweal of this
kingdom. And because it is likely that the disorders and distractions which
have happened of late, have been occasioned through the conceived fears of
innovation of Religion and Laws, and not out of any disloyalty or
disaffection to soveraigntie, We are graciously pleased absolutely to forget
what is past, and freely to forgive all by-gones to all such as shall acquiesce
to this Our gracious pleasure, and carry themselves peaceably as loyal and
dutiful subjects, and shall ratify and approve the same in Our next ensuing
Parliament. And that this Assembly may have the better success, and more happy
conclusion, Our will is, that there be a solemn Fast proclaimed and kept by
all Our good subjects of this kingdom, a fourteen days before the beginning
of the said Assembly: the causes thereof to be a begging a blessing from God
upon that Assembly, and a peaceable end to the distractions of this Church and
kingdom, with the aversion of Gods heavy judgment from both. And Our
pleasure is, that this Fast be kept in the most solemn manner as has been in
this Church at any time heretofore upon the most extraordinary occasion.

OUR WILL is herefore, and We charge you straightly and command, that
incontinent these Our Letters seen, ye pass, and make publication hereof by
open proclamation at the market crosses of the head burrowes of this kingdom,
where-through none pretend ignorance of the same.

Given at Our Court of Oatlands, the ninth day of September 1638. Per Regem.

AFter this Declaration was proclaimed, the Confession of Faith, as it was at
the first commanded by Our Royal Father, as also the band annexed for defense
of the Religion now established, and of Our Person and authority, with the
subscriptions of Our Commissioner and Council to them both, do here follow.

The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of SCOTLAND:
Subscribed at the first by the Kings Majesty's umwhile dearest Father, of
blessed memory, and his Household, in the year of God 1580. Thereafter by
persons of all ranks, in the year of God 1581. by ordinance of the Lords of
Secret Council, and Acts of the General Assembly. Subscribed again by all
sorts of Persons in the year 1590. by a new Ordinance of Council, at the desire
of the general Assembly: With the general Band for maintenance of the true
Religion. And now renewed and subscribed again by his Majesty's special
command, by the right noble Marquess, James, Marquess of Hamiltoun, Earl of
Arran and Cambridge, Lord Even and Evendail, his Majesty's high Commissioner,
and Lords of secret Council undersubscribing. And that of and according to the
date and tenor of the said Confession of Faith, dated in March 1580. and of the
Band, dated in Anno 1589.

We All, and every one of us underwritten, protest, That, after long and due
examination of our own Consciences, in matters of true and false Religion, are
now thoroughly resolved in the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God, and
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with
our hands, and constantly affirm before God and the whole World, that this
only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing
salvation to man, which is now by the mercy of God, revealed to the world by
the preaching of the blessed Evangel.

And received, believed, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and
Realms, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and three
Estates of this Realm, as Gods eternal truth and only ground of our
salvation; as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith,
stablished, and publicly confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a
long time has been openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of
this Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and form of
Religion, we willingly agree in our consciences in all points, as unto Gods
undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded only upon his written Word: And therefore
We abhor and detest all contrary Religion and Doctrine, But chiefly all
kind of Papistrie in general and particular heads, even as they are now
damned and confuted by the Word of God and Kirk of Scotland: but in special,
we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist upon the
Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civil Magistrate, and conscience of men:
All his tyrannous laws made upon indifferent things against our Christian
liberty; His erroneous doctrine against the sufficiency of the written word,
the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ, and his blessed evangel. His
corrupted doctrine concerning original sin, our natural inability, and
rebellion to Gods law, our justification by faith only, our imperfect
sanctification and obedience to the law, the nature, number, and use of the
holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies,
and false doctrine, added to the ministration of the true Sacraments without
the word of God. His cruel judgment against infants departing without the
Sacrament. His absolute necessity of Baptism. His blasphemous opinion of
Transubstantiation, or real presence of Christ's body in the elements, and
receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men. His dispensations with
solemn oaths, perjuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word. His
cruelty against the innocent divorced. His divellish Mass. His blasphemous
Priesthood. His profane sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick.
His canonization of men, calling upon Angels or Saints departed, worshipping of
imagerie, relics, and crosses, dedicating of Kirks, altars, days, vows to
creatures. His purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying or speaking in a
strange language, with his processions and blasphemous letanie, and multitude
of advocates or mediators, His manifold orders, auricular confession. His
desperate and uncertain repentance. His general and doubt some faith. His
satisfactions of men for their sins. His justification by works, Opus operatum,
works of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations, and stations. His
holy water, baptising of bells, conjuring of spirits, crossing, saving,
anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the superstitious
opinion joined therewith. His worldly Mornarchy, and wicked Hierarchy. His
three solemn vows, with all his shavellings of sundry sorts. His erroneous
and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers and approvers of
that cruel and bloody band, conjured against the Kirk of God. And finally, we
detest all his vain allegories, rites, signs, and traditions brought in the
Kirk, without, or against the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed
Kirk. To the which we join our selves willingly, in doctrine, faith, Religion,
discipline, and use of the holy sacraments, as lively members of the same, in
Christ our head: promising and swearing, by the great Name of the Lord our God,
that we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this
Kirk, and shall defend the same, according to our vocation and power, all the
days of our lives, under the pains contained in the law, and danger both of
body and soul in the day of Gods fearful judgment. And seeing that many are
stirred up by Satan and that Roman Antichrist, to promise, swear, subscribe,
and for a time use the holy Sacraments in the Kirk deceitfully, against their
own consciences, minding hereby, first, under the external cloak of Religion,
to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true Religion within the Kirk, and
afterward, when time may serve, to become open enemies and persecuters of the
same, under vain hope of the Popes dispensation divised against the word of
God, to his greater confusion, and their double condemnation in the day of the
Lord Jesus:

We therefore, willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such
double dealing with God and his Kirk, protest, and call the Searcher of all
hearts to witness, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our
confession, promise, oath, and subscription: So that we are not moved for any
worldly respect, but are persuaded only in our consciences, through the
knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the holy
Spirit, as we shall answer to him in the day when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed. And because we perceive, that the quietness and stability
of our Religion and Kirk does depend upon the safety and good behavior of the
Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy granted to this
country, for the maintenance of his Kirk, and ministration of justice amongst
us, we protest and promise with our hearts under the same oath, hand-writ, and
pains, that we shall defend his person and authority, with our gear, bodies,
and lives, in the defense of Christ his Evangel, liberties of our Country,
ministration of justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within
this Realm, or without, as we desire our God to be a strong and merciful
defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
to whom, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all honor and glory
eternally. Amen.

We under-subscribing, and considering the strait link and conjunction
betwixt the true and Christian religion presently professed within this realm,
and Sovereign Lords estate and standing, having both the self same friends
and common enemies, and subject to the like event of standing and decay, and
weighing therewithal the imminent danger threatened to the said religion, the
preservation whereof being dearer to us then whatsoever we have dearest to us
in this life; And finding in his Majesty a most honorable and Christian
resolution, to manifest himself to the world that zealous and religious Prince
which he has hitherto professed; and to employ the means and power that God
has put into his hands, as well to the withstanding of whatsoever foreign
force shall mean within this land, for alteration of the said religion, or
endangering of the present state, as to the repressing of the inward enemies
thereto amongst our selves, linked with them in the said Antichristian league
and confederacy; Have therefore in the presence of Almighty God, and with his
Majesty's authorizing and allowance, faithfully promised, and solemnly sworn,
like as hereby we faithfully and solemnly swear, and promise, to take a true,
effauld, and plain part with his Majesty amongst our selves, for diverting of
the appearing danger threatened to the said Religion, and his Majesty's state
and standing, depending thereupon, by whatsoever foreign or intestine plots
or preparations. And to that effect, faithfully, and that upon our truth and
honors, bind and oblige us to others, to conveene and assemble our selves
publicly, with our friends in arms, or in quiet manner, at such times and
places as we shall be required by his Proclamations, or by writ or message
direct to us from his Majesty, or any having power from him, And being
conveened and assembled, to join and concur with the whole forces of our
friends and favorers, against whatsoever foreign or intestine powers or
Papists, and their partakers, shall arrive or rise within this Island, or any
part thereof, ready to defend or pursue, as we shall be authorized and
conducted by his Majesty, or any others having his power and commission, to
join and hold hand to the execution of whatsoever mean or order shall be
thought meet by his Majesty, and his Council, for suppressing of the Papists,
promotion of the true Religion, and settling of his Highness estate, and
obedience in all the countries and corners of this Realm, to expound and
hazard our lives, lands, and goods, and whatsoever means God has lent us, in
the defense of the said true and Christian Religion, and his Majesty's person
and estate, against whatsoever Jesuits and Seminary or Mass Priests,
condemned enemies to God and his Majesty, to their utter wrack and
exterminion, according to the power granted to us by his Majesty's
proclamation, and acts of Parliament: To try, search, and seek out all
excommunicates, practisers, and others Papists whatsoever, within our bounds
and shire where we keep residence, and dilate them to his Highness and his
privy Council, and conform us to such directions, as from time to time we
shall receive from his Majesty and his Council in their behalfes. And
specially so many of us as presently are, or hereafter shall be appointed
Commissioners in every shire, shall follow, pursue, and travail by all means
possible, to take and apprehend all such Papists, Apostates, and
excommunicates, as we shall receive in writ from his Majesty. And we, the
remanent within that shire, shall concur and assist with the said
Commissioners with our whole friends and forces, to that effect, without
respect of any person whatsoever. And generally to assist in the mean time,
and defend every one of us another, in all and whatsoever quarrels, actions,
debates, moved, or to be moved against us, or any of us upon action of the
present Band, or other causes depending thereupon. And effauldly join in
defense and pursuit against whatsoever shall offer or intend any injury, or
revenge against any one of them for the premises, making his cause and part
that is pursued, all our parts; Notwithstanding, whatsoever privy grudge, or
displeasure standing betwixt any of us, which shall be no impediment or hinder
to our said effauld joining in the said common cause; but to lie over, and be
misknown, till they be orderly removed, and taken away by the order
under-specified. To the which time, we for the better furtherance of the said
cause and service, have assured, and by the tenor hereof, every one of us
taking the burden upon us for our selves, and all that we may let, assure each
other to be unhurt, unharmed, or any ways to be invaded by us, or any our
foresaids for old feid or new, otherwise then by ordinary course of law and
justice: neither shall we, nor any of our foresaids make any provocation, or
tumult, trouble or displeasure to others in any sort, as we shall answer to
God, and upon our Honors, and fidelity to his Majesty. And for our further
and more hearty union in this service, we are content and consent, that all
whatsoever our feids and variances fallen, or that may fall out betwixt us, be
within forty days after the date hereof amicably referred and submitted to
seven or five indifferent friends, chosen by his Majesty of our whole number,
and by their moderation and arbitrament componed and taken away. And finally,
that we shall neither directly, nor indirectly separate nor withdraw us from
the union and fellowship of the remanent, by whatsoever suggestion or private
advice, or by whatsoever incident regard, or stay such resolution as by common
deliberation shall be taken in the premises, as we shall answer to God upon our
consciences, and to the world upon our truth and honors, under the pain to be
esteemed traitors to God and his Majesty, and to have lost all honor,
credit, and estimation in time coming. In witness whereof, by his Majesty's
special command, allowance, and protection promised to us therein, We have
subscribed these presents with our hands. At 1589.

We JAMES Marquess of Hamiltoun, Earl of Arran and Cambridge, Lord Even and

maintenance of his sacred Majesty's authority, according to the tenor thereof,
and siclike, as amply as the same was conceived in favors of his Majesty's
umwhile blessed Father of eternal memory, by the said Band. In witness
whereof, we have subscribed these presents with our hands, At Holy-rood-house
September. 22. 1638. Sic subscribitur, HAMILTOUN, Traquair, Roxburgh, Mairsheall,

AT the same time was a proclamation made for the indiction of the general
Assembly, which was this.

At Holy-rood-house the 22. day of September 1638.
For So Much as it has pleased the Kings Majesty, out of his pious and
religious disposition to the true Religion, and out of his fatherly care, for
removing of all fears, doubts, and scruples, which may arise in the minds of
his subjects, for preservation of the purity thereof, and upon diverse great
and weighty considerations, importing the glory of God, the peace of the Kirk
and Commonweal of this kingdom, to appoint and give order, that a free

and to do and perform all which to their charges in such cases appertains,
as they will answer to the contrary at their highest peril.

IMmediately after that, this Proclamation was made for the indiction of the
Parliament.

At Holy-rood-house the 22. day of September 1638.
For So Much as it has pleased his Majesty, out of his pious and religious
disposition to the true Religion, and out of his fatherly care for removing of
all fears, doubts, and scruples which may arise in the minds of his subjects,
for preservation of the purity thereof, and upon diverse other great and
weighty causes, importing the glory of God, the peace of the Kirk and
Commonweal of this Kingdom, to appoint and give order, that the Sovereign
and High Court of Parliament shall be holden at the City of Edinburgh upon the
15. day of May next to come, with continuation of days: Therefore the Lords of

decent and comely manner, make their address to the said Parliament, attend
and await thereat during the time thereof, and to discharge that duty which is
incumbent to them and each one of them, as they will answer on the contrary at
their peril.

ANd last of all was published and proclaimed first the Act of the Lords of Our
Council for requiring all Our subjects to subscribe the said Confession of
Faith and Band annexed, which here follows.

At Holy-rood-house the 24. day of September Anno 1638.
THe which day a Noble Earl, JAMES Marquess of Hamiltoun, Earl of Arran and
Cambridge, his Majesty's Commissioner, having produced and exhibit before the
Lords of secret Council, upon the twenty second day of this instant, a warrant
signed by his Majesty, of the date the ninth of September instant; wherein
among others of his Majesty's gracious and royal expressions for preservation
of the purity of Religion, and due obedience to his Majesty's authority in the
maintenance thereof, his Majesty did will and ordain that the Lords
themselves should swear the Confession and general Band mentioned in his
Majesty's said warrant, and also should take such order, as all his Majesty's
lieges may subscribe the same. And the said Lords of secret Council,
acknowledging his Majesty's pious and gracious disposition and affection to the
purity of Gods truth, did upon the 22. day of September instant, unanimously
and with all humble, hearty, and sincere affection, swear and subscribe the
confession of Faith, dated the second of March 1580. according as it was then
professed within this Kingdom: Together with the foresaid general Band dated in
Anno 1589. And now to the effect that all his Majesty's lieges may give the
like obedience to his Majesty's so pious desire, therefore the said Lords have
ordained and ordaines all his Majesty's lieges, of whatsoever estate, degree or
quality, Ecclesiastical or Civil, to swear and subscribe the said
Confession, dated the second of March 1580. and that according to the said date
and tenor thereof, and as it was then professed within this Kingdom: Together
with the said general Band, dated in Anno 1589. as they will answer at the
contrary upon their obedience. And ordaines officers of Arms to pass to the
market cross of Edinburgh, and make publication hereof, and at all other
places needful, wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the same.

ANd next after that was proclaimed the Commission of the Lords of Our
Council, whereby they appointed and designed several Commissioners for
requiring and taking the subscriptions of Our subjects to the said Confession
and Band annexed, throughout the several Shires within the Kingdom, which
here follows.

At Holy-rood-house the 24. day of September Anno 1638.
For So Much as a noble Marquess, James Marquess of Hamiltoun, Earl of Arran
and Cambridge, his Majesty's Commissioner, and the Lords of Secret Council, by
an act of the date of the twenty second of this instant, have by special
warrant of his sacred Majesty, sworn and subscribed, with all humble and
hearty affection and unanimously, the Confession of Faith, dated the second of

according to the said date and tenor thereof, and according as it was then
professed within this kingdom: Together with the general Band insert therewith
in the said books of Privy Council, dated in Anno 1589. Like as also the
said Lords of Council, by their Act of the date of these presents,

purity of Gods truth, and as thereby they conceive themselves bound in

they will be answerable to his Majesty and the said Lords, upon their duty and
obedience: and to make report of their said diligence betwixt and the
thirteenth day of November next.

ANd because many did conceive, though falsely that these pretended Innovations
had made some alteration in the Religion which was sworn at the first in the
said Confession, Our Commissioner and Council knowing well that suggestion to
be made by those who were enemies to all peace, and only to that end that Our
subjects might be kept from returning to their obedience, did declare most
truly and justly that Our intention; and so accordingly the oath which they had
now taken was to defend the true Religion and Confession of faith as it was
professed in that Kingdom, and sworn unto in the year of our Lord 1580. by
which they did assuredly conceive that all Our good people would rest fully
satisfied. The Act of Council containing that short explication here follows.

Apud Holy-rood-house 22. Septembris Anno 1638.
THe which day a Noble Marquess, JAMES Marquess of Hammiltoun, Earl of Arran
and Cambridge, his Majesty's Commissioner, and Lords of secret Council, in all
humble and hearty affection unanimously swore, and subscribed the Confession
of Faith above-written, dated 2. March 1580. according as it was then professed
within this Kingdom: Together with the general Band above specified, dated in
Anno 1589. Whereupon S. Thomas Hope of Craighall, his Majesty's Advocate, in
his Majesty's name asked instruments.

WIth all these Our gracious proceedings the Lords of Our Council were so fully
satisfied themselves, that they did verily believe that there would remain no
more scruples in the minds of Our good subjects, and that nothing now could
keep them from a cheerful and thankful returning to their former obedience.
Their own resentment and satisfaction they testified both by an act of
Council, and a particular Letter directed to Us for that purpose, which here
do follow.

The Act of Council.
THe Lords of secret Council having read and maturely considered his Majesty's
letters, and particular declaration of his pleasure anent the annulling of the
Service Book, Book of Canons, and high Commission, discharging the pressing of
the practice of the five Articles, making all persons, Ecclesiastic and
Civil, of what title or degree soever, liable to the trial and censure of
Parliament, general Assembly, and other Judicatories competent, anent the not
administrating to Ministers at their entry any other oath then that which is
contained in the Act of Parliament anent the subscribing and renewing the
Confession of Faith, subscribed by his Majesty's Father of blessed memory, and
his household, in Anno 1580. and Band following thereupon, anent the indiction
of a general Assembly, to be holden at Glasgow the 21. day. of November, 1638.
and Parliament at Edinburgh the 15. of May, 1639. and anent his gracious
goodness in forgetting and forgiving all by-gones, and indiction of a Fast for
craving of Gods blessing to this Assembly; find themselves so fully satisfied
therewith, and the same to be so satisfactory for removing all the fears of
the subjects anent innovation of Religion or Laws, that we hold our selves
bound in duty, not only to acquiesce therewith, as the best mean to secure
both Religion and Laws, but also to use our best endeavors that all his
Majesty's good subjects may likewise rest satisfied therewith: And that they
with us, and we with them, may testify our thankfulness for so great a grace
and goodness with all the hearty expressions of dutifulness and loyalty; And
that our true sense hereof may the more clearly appear to our sacred
Sovereign, We do by these humbly and heartily make offer of our lives and
fortunes in the defending and assisting of his Majesty's sacred person and
authority, in the maintenance of the foresaid Religion and Confession, and
repressing of all such as shall hereafter press to disturb the peace of this
Kirk and Kingdom.

In witness whereof we have heartily and freely subscribed these presents with
our hands.

At Holy-rood-house the 22. day of September, 1638. Sic Subscribitur.

The Letter of Our Council.
Most Sacred Sovereign,
IF ever faithful and loyal subjects had reason to acknowledge extraordinary
favors, shown to a Nation, and in a most submissive and hearty manner give
real demonstrations of the grace vouchsafed; then do we of your Majesty's
Council, of this your ancient Kingdom, unanimously profess, that such acts
of clemency vouchsafed us, cannot proceed from any Prince, saving him who is
the lively image on earth of the great God Author of all goodness. For return
of so transcendent grace, fortified with the real expression of unparalled
Piety, royal inclination to Peace, and universal love, not only to those of
our number, but likewise to all your Majesty's loyal Subjects, we do all in
one voice, with all resentment can be imagined, in all humility render our
most bounden thanks, and offer, in testimony of our full satisfaction and
acquiescence herewith, to sacrifice our lives and fortunes in seconding your
Sacred Majesty's commandments, and repressing all such as shall hereafter
preasse to disturb the Peace of the Kirk and Kingdom. And for some small
signification of our alacrity and diligence in your Sacred Majesty's service,
we have all, without the least shadow of any scruple, subscribed the Confession
of Faith and Band appointed to be received by all your Majesty's loyal
Subjects, sent the act passed in Council, with our other proceedings, which
we do most humbly represent to your Royal view. And we beseech your
Majesty to be pleased, to be persuaded of the unviolable devotion of all here
subscribers, who do all in all humility pray for your Majesty's most happy
and flourishing reign.

Sic subscribitur. HAMMILTOUN, Traquair, Roxburgh, Mairsheall, Mar, Murray,

IT is not for men to judge of other men's hearts, and of their secret desires,
but We do challenge the most rigid Covenanters to name any one particular ever
desired by them, in any of their supplications, remonstrances, protestations,
declarations, written or printed, exhibited to Us, Our Commissioner, or
Council, which is not in this Our gracious Declaration granted to Our people:
For not only all and every one of their particular grievances any way
petitioned against by them, are hereby discharged and removed, but even the two
general things, which they made the people believe was the sum of all their
desires and expectations, viz. a free General Assembly and a Parliament are
indicted, and in that order upon which they stood so earnestly, first the
Assembly, and then the Parliament: And besides all these, their own Confession
of faith, the ground as they pretend, of their Covenant renewed and established.

Who would not now have expected a happy period to all the distractions of
that Kingdom, upon this Our gracious assenting to all their own desires? But
the divellish obstinacy and malice of those factious spirits, who did see that
all their designs were utterly defeated, and that their hopes for compassing
of them were now a bleeding and drawing their last breath, if they could not
find some means to blindfold Our peoples eyes, and so keep them from
discerning and acknowledging Our grace and goodness toward them: They
presently before the hour that this Our Declaration was to be proclaimed,
filled Our peoples minds and ears with fearful expectations of most terrible
things to be delivered in this Our Proclamation, and so destructive of the
laws and liberties of that Church and Kingdom, especially of their late
sworn Covenant, that presently they wrought the people to a detestation of Our
Declaration, before they knew what it was: They presently erected a large
scaffold under the Cross where Our Proclamation was to be made, upon which
were mounted, not one or two from every Table, to protest in the name of the
rest, as heretofore they had done, but a great number of Earls, Lords,
Gentlemen, and others, with their swords in their hands, and hats on their
heads* not without jeering and laughing during all the time of Our
Proclamation; which no sooner was ended, but with a most insolent and
rebellious behavior they assisted one Johnston in reading of a most wicked,
treasonable, and ignorant Protestation, which within few days after they
printed and We do here insert, as being confident that all subjects in the
world who shall come to read it, will abhor and detest it, if ever they did
feel in their own hearts the least touch or taste of a Princes favor and
clemency, or carry any affection to loyalty, justice, and government: The
very reading of it will bring every good subject and religious honest man so
far out of love with it, as it needs no further confutation then the very
perusal of it: For who can endure to hear Scripture so grossly abused, the
holy name of God so solemnly invocated as a witness to such notorious
falsehoods; to their rebellious courses and Covenant those attributes of
infallibility given, which are only proper to the sacred Scripture; and
royal authority affronted with such peremptory asseverations, ignorant and
senseless reasons, the falsehood and inconsequence whereof must needs appear
upon first view to any one who shall cast his eye upon them? The Protestation
follows, thus.

The Protestation of the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burrows, Ministers, and
Commons, etc.
We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, his
Majesty's true and loyal subjects, That whereas our continual supplications,
complaints, articles, and informations, presented, first, to the Lords of his
Majesty's Privy Council; next, to his sacred Majesty, and last, from time to
time to his Majesty's Commissioner, our long attendance and great patience this
twelvemonth bygone, in waiting for satisfaction of our most just desires, our
zeal to remove all rubs out of the way, which were either mentioned unto us,
or could be conceived by us, as hindrances of our pious intentions, aiming at
nothing but the good of the Kingdom, and preservation of the Kirk, which by
consumption or combustion is likely to expire; delighting to use no other
means but such as are legal, and have been ordinary in this Kirk since the
reformation, and laboring according to our power and interesse, that all
things might be carried in a peaceable manner, worthy of our Profession and
Covenant, our Protestation containing a hearty thanksgiving for what his
Majesty in his Proclamation from his justice had granted of our just desires;
and our Protests and hopes for so much as was not as yet granted. All these
made us confidently to expect from his Majestes Royal and compassioned
disposition toward this his native Kingdom, that a free General Assembly and
Parliament should have been indicted, as the ordinary and most proper remedies
of our grievances, and did constrain us to renew our petition, earnestly
entreating, that his Majesty's Commissioner would be pleased to represent unto
his Majesty the condition of this Kirk and Kingdom, crying in an extreme
exigencie for present help, with the lawfulness of the remedies prescribed by
his Majesty's Laws, required by us, and presented to him in some particular
Articles, which his Grace promised to recommend to his Majesty, and to do his
best endeavors for obtaining the same; especially the first Article, that
there might be indicted a full and free General Assembly, without
prelimitation, either in the constitution and members thereof, in the order and
manner of proceeding, or in the matters to be treated: And if there should be
any question or doubt about one of these, or such like particulars, that the
determination thereof might be remitted to the Assembly it self, as the only
proper and competent judge. And now, after so many supplications, complaints,
articles, and informations; after our necessary protestation, expressing the
humble thankfulness and continued desires of our hearts; after so long
expectation and so much dealing, having with open ears, and attentive minds
heard his Majesty's Proclamation, it is our desire, purpose, and endeavor so to
proceed, that we may upon the one part still be thankful to God and the King,
for the least blinke of his Majesty's countenance, and the smallest crumbs of
comfort that fall unto us from his Majesty's Royal hands; beseeching the Lord
yet further to enlarge his Majesty's heart, for our full satisfaction and
rejoicing, to the honor of God, the good of this Kirk and Kingdom, and his
Majesty's never dying fame and glory; that his wise government and zeal to the
service of God, may be a measure and pattern of desires to all generations
hereafter, when they shall be wishing for a religious and righteous King: And
on the other part, that Christ our Lord, the King of Kings, through our neglect
or luke-warmnesse may want no part of his Sovereignty and Dominion, and that in
our Religion, which is more dear unto us then our lives, we deceive not our
selves, with that which cannot satisfy and make up the breach of this Kirk
and Kingdom, or remove our fears, doubts, and suspicions, of the innovations
of Religion: This has made us to observe, and perceive, that his Majesty's
Proclamation does ascribe all the late distractions of this Kirk and
Commonwealth, to our conceived fears of the innovation of Religion and Law,
as the cause and occasion thereof, and not to the innovations themselves, with
which we have been for a long time, and especially of late, heavily pressed
and grieved; as if the cause were rather in apprehension and fancy, then in
reality and substance. That the Service book and book of Canons are not so far
discharged by this Proclamation, as they have been urged by preceding
Proclamations; for this Proclamation only discharges the practice of them,
and rescinds the Acts made for establishing their practice, but does not
rescind the former Proclamations; namely, that of the 19. of February at
Stirling, and that of the fourth of July at Edinburgh, which give an high
approbation to these Books, as fit means to maintain Religion, and to beat
down all superstition; and withal declares his Majesty's purpose, to bring
them into this Kirk in a fair and legal way: And thus both our fears that
they may be introduced hereafter, must still remain; and the liberty of the
General Assembly, by such a Declaration of his Majesty's judgment, is not a
little prejudged in the minds of so many as wisely consider and compare the
preceding Proclamations with this which we now hear, although others who
looking upon one step and not upon the whole progress, run on rashly, and,
neither considering what they are doing, nor with whom they are dealing, may be
easily deceived, Qui pauca videt, cito judicat, a short sight makes a sudden
judgment.

That it is declared in this Proclamation, That his Majesty neither intends
to innovate any thing in Religion or Laws, or to admit of any change or
alteration in the true Religion already established and professed in this
Kingdom: and withal, this is interposed, That the articles of Pearth are
established by the acts of Parliament and general Assembly, and dispensation
of the practice only granted, and discharge given, that no person be urged with
the practice thereof; and consequently, his Majesty's intention for the
standing of the Acts of the Assembly and Parliament, appointing the Articles of
Pearth, is manifest; which is no small prejudice to the freedom of the
General Assembly, That while the Proclamation ordains all his Majesty's
subjects to be liable to the trial and censure of the judicatories competent,
and that none of them shall use any unlimited and unwarranted power; likewise
that no other oath be administered to Ministers at their entry, then that which
is contained in the Act of Parliament; in both these Articles the Bishops are
meaned, who are only thereby for the present curbed, against their exorbitancie
and enormities in exercing their office: but the office of Bishops is thereby
not only presupposed as unquestionable, but also so strongly established, that
his Majesty declares, for the present, his intention, to admit no innovation
therein: which is more evident by the indiction of the Parliament, warning all
Prelates to be present, as having voice and place in Parliament; and by the
indiction of the Assembly, warning all Archbishops and Bishops (for so are
their diverse degrees and offices Ecclesiastical here designed and supposed) to
be present, as having place and voice in the Assembly, contrary to the caveats,
acts of the Kirk, and our declinator: And thus a third and great limitation is
put upon the General Assembly. The Proclamation, by reason of these many real
limitations, and prejudices of the liberty of the Assembly in the very points
which have wrought so much woe and disturbance in this Kirk and Kingdom, and
wherein the liberty of the Assembly is most useful and necessary at this time,
can neither satifie our grievances and complants, nor remove our fears and
doubts, nor cannot (without protestation) be admitted by us his Majesty's
subjects, who earnestly desire that Truth and Peace may be established; and
that for the reasons following.

1. TO keep silence in any thing that may serve for the good of the Kirk,
whether it be in preaching, prayer, or in proposing and voyceing in a lwfull
Assembly of the Kirk, is against the word of God. Esai. 62.6. Ye that are the
Lords remembrancers, keep not silence, and give him no rest till he establish,
and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 1. King. 18.21. Like the
halting of the people between two opinions, and their not answering a word,
when the Lord called them to give a testimony. Act. 20.20. I have kept back
nothing that was profitable unto you: and again, 1 Cor. 12.7. Mat. 15.18. Romans
1.18. Revel. 2.14.20. and 3.15: and therefore to keep silence, or not to
meddle with corruptions, whether in doctrine, sacraments, worship or
discipline, in a general Assembly of the Kirk, conveened for that end, were
the ready way to move the Lord to deny his Spirit unto us, and to provoke him
to wrath against our proceedings, and might be imputed unto us for prejudice,
for collusion, and for betraying our selves and the posterity.

2. This predetermination is against our supplications and protestations,
wherein we have shown our selves so earnest for a free general Assembly,
contrary to every limitation of this kind, so far prejudging the liberty
thereof, is against the Confession of Faith registrated in the Parliament 1567.
declaring that one cause of the Councels of the Kirk is for good policy and
order to be observed in the Kirk, and for to change such things as men have
devised when they rather foster superstition then edify the Kirk, using the
same; and is against our late Confession, wherein we have promised to forbear
all novations till they be tried, which obliges us to forbear now, and to try
them in an Assembly, and by all lawful means* to labor to recover the former
purity and liberty of the Gospel, to which this limitation is directly
repugnant, our liberty in a General Assembly being the principal of all
lawful means serving to that end.

3. This were directly contrary to the nature and ends of a general assembly,
which having authority from God, being conveened according to the laws of the
Kingdom, and receiving power from the whole collective body of the Kirk, for
the good of Religion, and safety of the Kirk; Whatsoever may conduce for these
good ends in wisdom and modesty should be proponed, examined, and determined
without Prelimitation, either of the matters to be treated, or of the liberty
of the members thereof. It being manifest, that as far as the assembly is
limited in the matters to be treated, and in the members to be used, the
necessary ends of the Assembly, and the supreme Law, which is the safety of the
Kirk, are as far hindered, and pre-judged.

This limitation is against the Discipline of the Kirk, which Book 2. chap.
7. declares this to be one of her liberties, That the Assembly has power to
abrogate and abolish all Statutes and ordinances concerning Ecclesiastical
matters that are found noisome and unprofitable, and agree not with the time,
or are abused by the people, and against the acts of the general assembly.
Like as the pretended Assembly 1610. declares for the common affairs of the
Kirk (without exception or limitation) it is necessary that there be yearly
general Assemblies, And what order can be hoped for hereafter, if this
assembly indicted after so long intermission, and so many gross corruptions be
limited, and that more than ever any lawful Assembly of the Kirk was, when it
was yearly observed.

5. It is ordained in Parl. 11. act. 40. K. James 6. anent the necessary and
lawful form of all Parliaments that nothing shall be done, or commanded to be
done, which may directly or indirectly prejudge the liberty of free voycing or
reasoning of the Estates, or any of them in time coming. It is also appointed
in Parl. 6. act. 92. K. James 6. that the Lords of Counsel and Session proceed
in all civil causes intended or depending before them, or to be intended, to
cause execute their decrees notwithstanding any private writing, charge, or
command in the contrary, and generally by the acts of Parliament appointing
every matter for its own judicatorie, and to all judicatories their own
freedom. And therefore much more does this liberty belong to the supreme
judicatorie ecclesiastic in matters so important as concerns Gods honor and
worship immediately, the salvation of the peoples Souls, and right constitution
of the Kirk whose liberties and privileges are confirmed Parl. 12. K. James 6.
Parl. 1. K. Charles, for if it be carefully provided by diverse Acts of
Parliament, especially Parl. 12. act 148. K. James 6. That there be no
forstalling or regrating of things pertaining to this natural life: What shall
be thought of this spiritual for stalling and regrating which tends to the
famishing or poisoning of the souls of the people both now and in the
generations afterward.

6. It were contrary to our Protestations, proceedings and complaints against
the late innovations. And it might be accounted an innovation and usurpation as
gross and dangerous to us, and the posterity, and as prejudicial to Religion
as any complained upon by us, to admit limitations, and secret or open
determinations, which belongs to no person or judicatorie, but to an
Assembly, Or to consent to, and approve by our silence the same
predeterminations, It were to be guilty of that our selves, which we condemn
in others. We may easily judge how the Apostles before the Council of
Jerusalem, the Fathers before the Nicene Council, and our Predecessors before
the assembly holden at the Reformation, and afterward, would have taken such
dealing.

That this Proclamation commands all his Majesty's Subjects for maintenance
of the Religion already established to subscribe and renew the Confession of
Faith subscribed before in the year 1580, and afterward. And requires the
Lords of privy Council to take such course anent the same, and the general
Band of Maintenance of the true Religion, and the Kings person, that it may be
subscribed, and renewed throughout the whole Kingdom with all possible
diligence, which cannot now be performed by us. For although of late we would
have been glad that our selves and other his Majesty's Subjects had been
commanded by authority to swear, and subscribe the general Confession of
Faith against Popish errors, and superstitions and now would be glad that all
others should join with us in our late Covenant and Confession, descending
more specially to the novations and errors of the time, and obliging us to the
defense of Religion; and of the Kings Majesty's person, and authority, and for
these ends to the mutual defense every one of us of another, Yet can we not
now after so necessary, and so solemn a specification return to the general
for the reasons following.

1. No means have been left unassayed against our late Confession of Faith and
Covenant so solemnly sworn and subscribed. For first we were pressed with the
rendering and rescinding of our Covenant. Next an alteration in some
substantial points was urged. 3. A Declaration was motioned, which tended to
the enervation thereof, and now we find in the same strain, that we are put to
a new trial, and the last mean is used more subtle than the former: That by
this new subscription our late Covenant, and Confession may be quite absorbed
and buried in oblivion, that where it was intended and sworn to be an
everlasting Covenant never to be forgotten, it shall be never more remembered,
the one shall be cried up, and the other drowned in the noise thereof, And thus
the new subscription now urged (although in a different way) shall prove
equivalent to the rendering of the Covenant, or what of that kind has before
been assayed. Like as the reasons against the rendering of the Covenant, do
militate directly against this new motion.

2. If we should now enter upon this new Subscription, we would think our
selves guilty of mocking God, and taking his Name in vain, for the tears that
began to be poured forth at the solemnizing of the Covenant are not yet dried
up and wiped away, and the joyful noise which then began to sound has not yet
ceased* and there can be no new necessity from us, and upon our part pretended
for a ground of of urging this new subscription, at first intended to be an
abjuration of Popery upon us who are known to hate popery with an unfeigned
hatred, and have all this year bygone given large testimony of our zeal
against it. As we are not to multiply miracles on Gods part, so ought we not to
multiply solemn oaths and Covenants upon our part, and thus to play with
oaths, as children do with their toys, without necessity.

3. Neither would we in giving way to this new subscription think our selves
free of perjurie: for as we were driven by an undeclinable necessity to enter
into a mutual Covenant, so are we bound, not only by the law of God and
nature, but by our solemn oath and subscription, against all divisive motions
to promove and observe the same without violation: and it is most manifest,
that having already refused to render, alter, or destroy our Covenant, nothing
can be more contrary and adverse to our pious intentions and sincere
resolutions, than to consent to such a subscription and oath, as both in the
intention of the urgers, and in the nature and condition of the matter urged,
is the ready way to extinguish, and to drown in oblivion the Band of our union
and conjunction that they be no more remembered. In this case we are called to
lay seriously to our hearts, 1, That we have sworn that we shall neither
directly, nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided and withdrawn from
this blessed and loyal conjunction, which consists not only in the general
Confession, but also in our explanation, and application thereof, but on the
contrary, shall by all lawful means, labor to further and promove the same. 2.
That our union and conjunction may be observed without violation, (and so
without mutilation of our application) we call the living LORD to witness, as
we shall answer to Christ in the great Day, etc.

4. This new subscription, in stead of performing our vows, would be a real
testimony and confession before the World, That we have been transgressors in
making rash vows, that we repent our selves of former zeal and forwardness
against the particulars expressed first in our Supplications, Complaints, and
Protestations, and next abjured in our Covenant, that we in our judgment
prefer the general Confession unto this, which necessarily was now made more
special; and that we are now under the fair pretext and honest cover of a new
oath, recanting and undoing that, which upon so mature deliberation we have
been doing before, This beside all other evils, were to make way and open a
door to the re-entry of the particulars abjured, and to repent our selves of
our chiefest consolations, and to lie both against God and our own souls.

5. It has been often objected, that our Confession of Faith, and Covenant was
unlawful, because it wanted the warrants of public authority, and it has
been answered by us, that we were not destitute of the warrant civil and
ecclesiastical which authorized the former Covenant. And although we could
have wished that his Maty had added both his subscription and authority unto
it, yet the less co^straint from authority and the more liberty, the less
hypocrisy, and more sincerity has appeared: But by this new subscription
urged by authority we both condemn our former subscription as unlawful,
because alleged to be done without authority, and precondemn also the like
laudable course in the like necessity to be taken by the posterity.

6. What is the use of merch-stones upon borders of Lands, the like use has
Confessions of Faith in the Kirk, to disterminate and divide betwixt Truth and
error: and the renewing and applying of Confessions of Faith to the present
errors and corruptions, are not unlike ryding of merches. And therefore to
content our selves with the general, and to return to it, from the particular
application of the Confession necessarily made upon the invasion or creeping in
of errors within the borders of the Kirk, if it be not a removing of the merch
stone from the own place, it is at least the hiding of the merch in the ground
that it be not seen, which at this time were very unseasonable for two causes.
One is, because Popery is so pregnant, and powerful in this land, as we have
learned of late. The other, because the Papists who upon the urging of the
Service book and Canons, have presumed of our return to Rome, will upon this
our subscription arise from their dispareing of us, unto their wonted
presumption. None of us will deny, but the large Confession of Faith
registrated in the Acts of Parliament, does by consequence contain this short
confession and abjuration: Yet were it not sufficient against Popery to
subscribe the one without the other: how then shall we think that the more
general Confession and abjuration at this time, when the urging of such Popish
books has extorted from us so necessary an application, and does still call
for a testimony, to be complete enough without it.

7. The Papists shall hereby be occasioned to renew their old objection against
us, Annuas and menstruas fides de Deo decernu^t, That our Faith changes with
the Moon, or once in the year. Other reformed Kirks might justly wonder at our
inconstancy in changing our Confession without any real necessity, and that
in one and the same year it comes forth larger, and more particular, then
shorter, and more general: and our Adversaries will not fail to traduce us as
troublers of the peace of the Kirk and kingdom without any necessar cause.

8. It will likewise prove a confirmation of their error, who think they may
both subscribe the Confession of Faith, and receive the Service book, and
Canons, which is not only a direct scandaling of them, but also a ready way to
put a weapon in their hands against our selves, who maintain and profess that
these and such other evils are abjured in the Confession of Faith.

9. If we should now swear this Confession, we should be obliged by our oath
to maintain Perth articles, which are the innovations already introduced in the
worship of God, and to maintain Episcopacie, with the civil places, and power
of Kirkmen. Because we are bound to swear this Confession by virtue of and
comform unto the Kings command signed by his sacred Majesty of the date
September 9. 1638. (These are the very words subjoyned to the Confession and
Band, and prefixed to the Subscriptions) and it cannot be denied, but any oath
ministered unto us, must either be refused, or else taken according to the known
mind, professed intention, and express command of Authority urging the same:
And it is most manifest, that His Majesty's mind, intention, and Commandment,
is no other, but that the Confession be sworn, for the maintenance of religion,
as it is already or presently professed, (these two being coincident,
altogether one and the same, not only in our common form of speaking, but in
all His Majesty's proclamations) and thus as it includes, and contains
within the compass thereof, the foresaid novations and Episcopacie, which
under that name were also ratified, in the first Parliament holden by his
Majesty. And where it may be objected, that the Counselors have subscribed
the Confession of Faith, as it was professed 1580. and will not urge the
Subscription in another sense upon the Subjects. We answer, First, the Act of
Counsel containing that declaration, is not as yet published by Proclamation.
Secondly, if it were so published, it behooved of necessity either be repugnant
to His Majesty's declared Judgment and Command, which is more nor to swear
without warrant from Authority (a fault although uniustly, often objected unto
us) or else we must affirm the Religion in the year 1580. and at this time to
be altogether one and the same; and thus must acknowledge, that there is no
novation of Religion, which were a formal contradiction to that we have
sworn. 3. By approving the Proclamation anent the Oath to be administered to
Ministers, according to the Act of Parliament, which is to swear simple
obedience to the Diocesan Bishop, and by warning all Archbishops and Bishops to
be present; as having voice and place in the Assembly: They seem to determine,
that in their Judgment the Confession of Faith, as it was professed 1580. does
consist with Episcopacie, whereas We by our oath have referred the trial of
this or any other question of that kind to the general Assembly and Parliament.

10. This subscription and oath in the mind and intention of authority, and
consequently in our swearing thereof, may consist with the corruptions of the
Service book and Canons, which we have abjured as other heads of Popery: For
both this present proclamation, and his Majesty's former proclamations at
Linlithgow, Striveling, Edinburgh; The Lords of privy Counsel in their
approbation of the same; and the prelates and doctors who stand for the Service
book and Canons, Do all speak plainly, or import so much, That these books are
not repugnant to the Confession of Faith; and that the introducing of them is
no novation of religion or law: And therefore we must either refuse to
subscribe now, or we must confess contrary to our late Oath, and to a clear
Truth, That the Service book and Canons are no innovations in Religion. And,
though the present books be discharged by proclamation, yet if we shall by any
deed of our own testify, that they may consist with our Confession of Faith,
within a very short time, either the same books, or some other like unto them,
with some small change, may be obtruded upon us, who by Our abjuration (if we
adhere unto it) have freed both our selves, and the posterity of all such
corruptions, and have laid a fair foundation for the pure worship of God in
all time coming.

11. Although there be indeed no substantial difference between that which We
have subscribed, and the Confession subscribed 1580. more then there is
between that which is hid, and that which is revealed; A march stone hid in
the ground, and uncovered, betwixt the hand closed and open, betwixt a sword
scheathed and drawn, or betwixt the large Confession, registrat in the Acts of
Parliament, and the short Confession, or (if we may with reverence ascend yet
higher) between the Old Testament and the New, yet as to scheath our sword when
it should be drawn, were imprudencie; or at the commandment of Princes,
professedly popish in their dominions, after the Subjects had subscribed both
Confessions, to subscribe the first without the second, or at the will of a
Jewish Magistrate, openly denying the New Testament, to subscribe the Old
alone, after that they have subscribed both, were horrible impiety against God,
and Treachery against the Truth: Right so, for Us to subscribe the former
apart, as it is now urged and framed, without the explanation and application
thereof at this time, when ours is rejected; and the subscribers of the former
refuse to subscribe ours, as containing something substantially different, and
urge the former upon us, as different from ours, and not expressing the
special abjuration of the evils, supplicated against by us, were nothing else,
but to deny and part from our former subscription, if not formally, yet
interpretatively. Old Eleazar, who would not seem to eat forbidden meat, and
the Confessors and Martyrs of old, who would not seem by delivering some of
their papers, to render the Bible, or to deny the Truth, may teach us our duty
in this case, although our lives were in hazard for refusing this Subscription:
And who knows, but the LORD may be calling His people now, who have proceeded
so far in professing His Truth at this time, to such Trials and Confessions,
as His faithful Witnesses have given of old; that in this point also our doing
may be a document both to the succeeding ages, and to other Kirks to whom for
the present we are made a spectacle.

12. If any be so forgetful of his oath (which God forbid) as to subscribe
this Confession, as it is now urged, he does according to the proclamation
acquiesce in this declaration of his Majesty's will, and does accept of such a
pardon as has need to be ratified in parliament, And thus does turn our glory
unto shame, by confessing our guiltiness, where God from Heaven has made us
guiltless, and by the fire of His Spirit from Heaven has accepted of our
service, And does depart from the commandment of God, the practice of the
Godly in former times, and the worthy and laudable example of our worthy and
religious progenitors, in obedience whereof, and conform to which We made
profession to subscribe: for there is no particular Act required of us, to whom
the pardon is presented in this proclamation, but this new subscription
allanerlie.

13. The general band now urged to be subscribed, as it contains many
clauses not so fitting the present time as that wherein it was subscribed, so
is it deficient in a point, at this time most necessary, Of the reformation of
our lives, that we shall answerablie to our profession, be examples to others,
of all Godliness, soberness and righteousness and of every duty we owe to
GOD and main; without which we cannot now subscribe this Confession, least we
loose the bands to wickedness, seem to repent of our former resolutions and
promises, and choose to have our portion with hypocrites, professing and
swearing that we know GOD, but in our works denying him, being abominable,
disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

14. Since the narrative of the general band is now changed, and some lines,
expressing at length the Papists, and their adherents to be the party from
whom the danger to Religion, and the Kings Majesty was threatened, are left
out, and no designation made of the party from whom the danger is now
threatened, We are made either to think, that our subscription at this time is
unnecessarie, or to suspect that we who have supplicated and entered in
Covenant, are understood to be the party; especially since the Lords of
Council have in the Act September 22. ratifying the Proclamation, found
themselves bound to use their best endeavors, that all his Majesty's good
Subjects may rest satisfied with his Majesty's Declaration; since also we have
been (although undeservedly) challenged of disorders, distractions, and
dangers to Religion, and his Majesty's authority; and since in the foresaid
Act and in the missive directed to his Majesty, the Lords of Council offer
their lives and fortunes to his Majesty, in repressing all such, as shall
hereafter prease to disturb the peace of this Kirk and Kingdom; which being
expressed in a generality is by many applied to us, and interpreted of our
adhering to our Covenant; We should therefore, by our subscription of the
Covenant, as it is now conceived, both do directly against our own minds, in
condemning our selves, wherein we are innocent, and should consent to our own
hurt, to the suppressing of the cause which we maintain, and to the
repressing mutually one of us of another, directly contrary to our former
solemn Oath and subscription.

15. The subscribing of this Confession by the Lords of his Majesty's privy
Council, who by their place and high employment are public Peacemakers, and
by others who have not subscribed the late Confession will make the breach
wider, and the lamentable division of this Kirk more desperate then ever
before; some having sworn to labor by all lawful means to recover the
former Liberty, and purity of Religion; and others, maintaining that for
purity, which is already established; some believing and professing that the
evils supplicated against, are abjured in that Confession of Faith; and others
maintaining the Confession of Faith, and these corruptions (although for the
present discharged by authority) not to be inconsistent: and beside this, many
divisions and subdivisions will ensue to the dulefull renting of the Kirk and
Kingdom, making way for the wrath and many judgments of God often threatened
by his faithful servants, which all the godly ought to labor by all means to
prevent.

16. We represent also to the honorable Lords of privy Council to be
considered, That the Doctrine, Discipline, and Use of Sacraments are sworn,
and the contrary abjured, according to the Word of God, and the meaning of the
Kirk of Scotland in the books of Discipline, and Acts of Assemblies; And that
in the Oath there is no place left to the generality of any man's conception of
the true Faith and Religion, nor to any private interpretation, or mental
reservation.

For these and the like considerations, in our own name, and in name of all
who will adhere to the late Covenant, subscribed by us, and sealed from Heaven,
We (from our duty to God, our King, our native Country, our selves, and the
posterity, lest our silence import a satisfaction of our desires, and a
stopping of our mouths from necessary supplication for things yet to be
obtained from his Majesty's just and gracious disposition) are constrained to
declare and protest; First, that the cause and occasion of the distractions of
the Kirk and Commonwealth, are no ways to be imputed unto us, or our
needless fears, but to the innovations and corruptions of Religion, which
against the Acts and order of this Kirk, and the Laws of the Kingdom, have
been pressed upon us the people of God, and his Majesty's loyal subjects;
who, although under great thraldom, were living in peace and quietness,
laboring in all godliness and honesty to do our duty to God and man.
Secondly, We protest, that all questions and doubts that arise, concerning the
freedom of the Assembly, whether in the constitution and members thereof, or
in the matters to be treated, or in the manner and order of proceeding, be
remitted to the determination of the Assembly it self, as the only proper
and competent judge; And that it shall be lawful for us, being authorized with
lawful Commissions, as at other times when the urgent necessity of the Kirk
shall require, so in this exigence to assemble our selves at the Diet
appointed, notwithstanding any impediment or prorogation to the contrary: And
being assembled, against all qualifications and predeterminations, or
presupposals to propone, treat, reason, vote, and conclude, according to the
Word of God, confession of Faith, and Acts of lawful Assemblies, in all
Ecclesiastical matters, pertaining to the Assembly, and tending to the
advancement of the Kingdom of Christ, and good of Religion.

Thirdly, since Archbishops and Bishops have no warrant for their office in
this Kirk, since it is contrary both to reason and to the Acts of the Kirk,
that any have place and voice in the Assembly, who are not authorized with
lawful Commissions; and seeing both in common equity, and by the tenor of
this Proclamation, they are made liable to the trial and censure of the
Assembly, We protest, that they be not present, as having place or voice in
the Assembly, but as rei to compeere, for underlying trial and censure upon
the general complaints already made, and the particular accusations to be
given in against them; And that the warning given by his Majesty's
Proclamation, and this our Protestation, be a sufficient citation to them, to
compeer before the Assembly, for their trial and censure, in life, office,
and benefice.

Fourthly, We solemnly protest, that We do constantly adhere to our Oath and
subscription of the Confession of Faith and Covenant, lately renewed and
approven with rare and undeniable evidences from heaven, of the wonderful
workings of his Spirit in the hearts both of Pastors and people, through all
the parts of the Kingdom; And that we stand to all parts and clauses thereof,
and particularly to the explanation and application, containing both our
abjuration of, and our union against the particular evils and corruptions of
the time; a duty which the Lord at this time especially craveth at our hands.

Fifthly, We also protest, that none of us who have subscribed, and do adhere
to our subscription of the late Covenant, be charged, or urged, either to
procure the subscriptions of others, or to subscribe our selves unto any other
Confession or Covenant, containing any derogation thereunto, especially that
mentioned in the Proclamation, without the necessary explanation and the
application thereof, already sworn by us, for the Reasons above expressed: And
because, as we did in our former Protestation appeal from the Lords of his
Majesty's Council, so do we now by these renew our solemn appeal, with all
solemnities requisite, unto the next free General Assembly and Parliament, as
the only supreme national Judicatories competent, to judge of national
causes and proceedings.

Sixthly, We protest, That no subscription, whether by the Lords of Council or
others, of the Confession mentioned in the Proclamation, and enjoined for the
maintenance of Religion, as it is now already, or at this present time
established and professed within this Kingdom, without any innovation of
Religion or Law, be any manner of way prejudicial to our Covenant, wherein we
have sworn to forbear the practice of Novations already introduced, etc.
till they be tried in a free Assembly, And to labor by all lawful means, to
recover the purity and liberty of the Gospel as it was established and
professed before the foresaid Innovations: And in like manner, that no
subscription foresaid be any derogation to the true and sound meaning of our
worthy predecessors, at the time of their subscription in the year 1581. and
afterward. Withal, warning and exhorting all men who lay to heart the cause of
Religion, against the corruptions of the time and the present estate of things,
both to subscribe the Covenant as it has bin explained, and necessarily
applied; and as they love the purity and liberty of the Gospel, to hold back
their hands from all other Covenants, till the Assembly now indicted be
conveened, and determine the present differences and divisions, and preserve
this country from contrary oaths.

Seventhly, As his Majesty's royal clemency appears in forgiving and
forgetting what his Majesty conceives to be a disorder or done amiss in the
proceeding of any; so are we very confident of his Majesty's approbation, to
the integrity of our hearts and peaceablenesse of our ways and actions all
this time past: And therefore We protest that we still adhere to our former
complaints, protestations, lawful meetings, proceedings, mutual defenses,
etc. All which, as they have been in themselves lawful, so were they to us,
pressed with so many grievances in his Majesty's absence from this native
kingdom, most necessary, and ought to be regarded as good offices, and
pertinent duties of faithful Christians, loyal subjects, and sensible members
of this Kirk and Commonwealth, as we trust at all occasions to make manifest to
all good men, especially to his sacred Majesty, for whose long and prosperous
government, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life in all godliness and
honesty, We earnestly pray.

WHereupon a noble Earl, James Earl of Montrose, etc. in name of the
Noblemen; M. Alexander Gibson younger of Durie, in name of the Barons; George
Porterfield Merchant Burgess of Glasgow, in name of the Burrowes; M. Harie
Rollock Minister at Edinburgh, in name of the Ministers; and M. Archbald
Johnston Reader hereof, in name of all who adhere to the Confession of Faith
and Covenant, lately renewed within this Kingdom, took instruments in the
hands of three Notars present, at the said Mercate Cross of Edinburgh, being
environed with great numbers of the foresaid Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Burrows, Ministers, and Commons, before many hundred witnesses, and craved the
extract thereof: And in token of their dutiful respect to his Majesty,
confidence of the equity of their cause, and innocence of their carriage, and
hope of his Majesty's gracious acceptance, they offered in all humility with
submisse reverence a copy thereof to the Herald.

ANd now for trial of what We have said, the Reader may reflect upon these
particulars: Not far from the beginning, they aver that they did
confidently expect from Us a free General Assembly and Parliament to be
indicted, and that Our Commissioner promised to recommend unto Us this their
suit for a free General Assembly, without prelimitation either in the
constitution and members thereof, in the order and manner of proceeding, or in
the matters to be treated of; and do insinuate as if We had not given order
for any such Assembly in Our Declaration; which every Reader (looking upon
Our Declaration) may see to be most untrue: for in it We give warrant to Our
Commissioner to indict a free General Assembly; nor is there there either
mention or meaning of any prelimitation, though they themselves did use very
many, some whereof you have heard already, and shall hear of more hereafter.
Afterward they quarrel with Our Declaration for ascribing all the late
distractions of this Church and Commonwealth to their conceived fears of the
Innovation of Religion and Laws, and not to the Innovations themselves: No
doubt a great crime, that We will not acknowledge that the Service Book, which
was penned at first by those who laid down their lives in opposition to
Popery, is an introduction to Popery; and We do profess that We did
discharge that Book only to remove their fears and doubts, and ease their
pretended grievances: nor can We condemn that Book, without condemning the
Service Book of England, for the Covenanters arguments strike alike at both.
Then immediately after, They take it ill that though We have discharged the
practice of these pretended Innovations, and voided all Acts made for the
establishing of them, yet We have not rescinded Our former Proclamations at
Sterling and Edinburgh; As if nothing could content them, unless We should
disgrace Our own Proclamations, which did not any way establish or authorize
the things complained of: nay more, unless We will call back Our own words,
which cannot be interpreted to any such sense as they would force upon them,
they would make Our people believe, that the liberty of the general Assembly
is prejudged, and, in a suspicious, undutifull and dangerous phrase, tell them,
That they do not consider with whom they are dealing; as if no trust were to be
given to Us: Next, they quarrel with Our discharging of the practice of the
Articles of Perth, but not the Articles themselves which are established by
acts both of Parliament and General Assembly; and yet We dare say, that they
would hold it for a strange position, if We should use Our Prerogative to the
disanulling of any thing established by these two Judicatories; nay, if We and
the Parliament jointly should (as the world goes now) offer to disanull any
act of their General Assembly: so glad they are to quarrel with Our
Declaration, that in their eagerness they destroy their own grounds. Their
next cavil, if it were possible, is as senseless as the former, whereby they
aver, that Our naming of Bishops in Our Proclamation for the indiction of the
Assembly is a prelimitation of it, because thereby We take it as granted, that
the office of a Bishop is unquestionably an office in that Church and Kingdom*
and this they call a great prelimitation put upon the Assembly; but with what
show of consequence We cannot possibly conceive: for who would not take that
undoubtedly for an office in any Church or Kingdom, which is established by
the Laws and acts of both? and such is the office of a Bishop in that
Kingdom: After these fancied prelimitations, they add six reasons why they
should not be admitted; which are so ignorant and simple, as it is not possible
to draw them into any form of reasoning or concluding: and though they could
be so drawn, yet they were very needless; for to what end should reasons
be brought against the admitting of these prelimitations, when there were no
prelimitations offered, and these that are alleged are no prelimitations at
all? And therefore these six Reasons, at least so called by them, are to be
passed over with contempt, as having not one word in them worthy the answering.

Next, they muster up sixteen Reasons against the subscription to the
confession of Faith urged by Our authority in that Declaration, of the very
same piece with the former six Reasons, every way as full of nonsense as
they; The first is, that it will make their Covenant be forgotten: a matter of
great consequence indeed, that their unlawful Acts should be drowned by any
Act of lawful authority. For this We think they should thank Us: The second
reason is, that if they should subscribe this confession now, they would think
themselves guilty of mocking God: a notable whimsey, that Acts of authority
must want obedience if they cross some peoples foolish thoughts and idle
fancies; but in the mean time what a fearful mocking of God, and taking of
his name in vain is it for them to say so, and use that great name for so
groundless a suspicion? The third reason is, that they are afraid that this
subscription will introduce a division amongst themselves, it being against
their Oath, in their late Covenant, to admit of any divisive motions. And
truly whatsoever they pretend in all their other reasons, this is the maine,
if not the only reason of the principal Covenanters furious proceedings in
all their ways, and especially in this their Protestation, because they did
plainly perceive that if Our people should once see and acknowledge Our Grace
and clemency, or be brought to subscribe to the same thing by Our authority,
to which they had subscribed before by their persuasion, then they would begin
again to relish government, and so fall off, and divide themselves from those
who have resolved never to endure it: In the mean time, the Reader shall do
well to observe the wonderful strength of this reason; We must not subscribe,
because it will occasion some division amongst us; by the same reason, all hope
of peace must be banished out of that Kingdom for ever: For certainly if they
themselves should set down in writing the utmost of their desires, and We
should assent unto them, yet undoubtedly some would dislike and not admit of
those propositions of peace, which the rest had agreed upon: Are they therefore
sworn by their Oath to reject all proffers of peace, because some will dislike
them, upon which a division must follow more or less? The fourth reason is
plain Popery, and the maine ground of most of the errors established at the
Council of Trent; If they subscribe now, it will be thought that they have
erred in their former proceedings; but where the reason of this Reason lies, is
past ordinary finding: The fifth reason has in it a reach beyond the Moon;
This subscription is urged by authority, but our former subscription proceeded
from our own heads, and therefore is to be preferred, as carrying with it more
liberty, more sincerity, and less hypocrisy; A reason fit to be answered
by none but such as have lost their Reason: The sixth reason is in the same
case; for truly We understand it not: The seventh reason supposes that there
is a Papist in the world so foolish and simple as to think, that the same
confession of Faith, consisting of the same words and syllables, enjoined to
be sworn without authority, if it shall be commanded to be sworn by
authority, becomes a new and different confession of Faith; or if that We
every year of Our Reign should renew and command a subscription to the same
confession, that then every year We should establish a new Faith; Sure they
need not trouble Our peoples heads with such foolish fears, for undoubtedly
there will be no such foolish fellows found amongst the Papists: The eighth
reason, has not a show of any reason: For their ninth reason, We are
confident, that if they had known as much as now they do, and have expressed
in their answer to Our Commissioners last Declaration, they would have left
this quite out: for the truth is, that no man can subscribe this confession of
faith commanded by Us, and with a safe conscience hold that Episcopacie is
abjured by it, for many reasons, amongst which this alleged by them is but
one, yet a very true one, viz. That an oath must either be refused or taken
according to the known intention of him that ministered it; and it being well
known, that We, according to the Laws of all Our Kingdoms, are resolved to
maintain Episcopal government, no man can swear any oath administered by Us
or Our authority, which may not consist with that government: And it is as
true, that there is nothing in that confession of faith, which being sworn
unto, abjureth Episcopacie, by whomsoever the oath shall be administered; and
therefore it is a very unjust and unnecessarie fear, which seems to make them
sweat at the end of this ninth Reason, viz. That this subscription commanded by
Us, seems to determine, that the confession of faith as it was professed
1580. does consist with Episcopacie: That this subscription determines it, is
undoubtedly a very simple conceit, but that the confession it self made in
1580. may and does consist with Episcopacie, is unquestionably true; and it is
so determined by the Covenanters themselves, who assured many who made that
scruple, and would not have come into their Covenant unless the Covenanters
had first resolved them of it, that they might swear the same confession, and
yet not abjure Episcopal government, which likewise the three Ministers in
their first answer to the Divines of Aberdene, have positively affirmed,
averring, that Episcopacie was not abjured by that confession, nor their
Covenant, but only referred to the trial of an Assembly and Parliament: Now
it is most certain, that when We commanded this subscription to that
confession, no Assembly (true or pretended) had determined that it was abjured,
nor has any Parliament done so yet; and therefore the Covenanters themselves
have determined, that when We required this subscription, a man might safely
subscribe without abjuration of Episcopacie: But to let the weakness of this
ninth reason pass, it is a wonder to observe how these men in their answer to
the fourth reason (contained in Our Commissioners last Declaration) are
constrained by maine force of argument to deny their own most true
proposition, expressed at the beginning of this ninth reason: For there they
affirm it plainly, that a man may swear secundum rem juratam, though he know
that that which he swears to, is against the meaning and sense of him that
gives the oath; Which is such a notable piece of equivocation, and, indeed, of
such dishonestie, as is not to be expressed by Us in its proper name; for no
patron of equivocation has yet out-gone it. The tenth reason propounds an
undoubted truth, viz. that by swearing that confession, none of these pretended
innovations is abjured. What then? Is it not sufficient, that by Our authority
they are discharged, and referred to the trial of a general Assembly and
Parliament? The 11. reason repeateth again the dark parable of the March-stone
which was in the sixth reason; it would break any man's teeth to crack it, and
it is not to be hoped, that ever any man will find the pith and kernel of it;
and therefore let it be as unintelligible as the sixth. The 12. reason is such
a one as certainly no rational man could ever have dreamed of: If we subscribe
the confession by the Kings authority, then it will be thought that we
acquiesce in His Majesty's Declaration, and that we are contented to be
pardoned by Him, and that is such a thing as it turns all our glory into
shame, by confessing our guiltiness. A strange fancy, that men should account
that a shame, which the Scripture calls giving glory unto God. But truly it
is not far from blasphemy, when they affirm, that God by the fire of his
Spirit from heaven has accepted their service: If they mean their Covenant,
what more can be said of the holy Scriptures? For sure to be indicted by the
Spirit, and to be approved by the fire of the Spirit from heaven, is much about
one; if there be any difference, the odds will seem to lie upon the
acceptance of it from heaven by the fire of the Spirit; for the Spirit
descending upon the Apostles in fiery tongues, was that which both sealed
their calling unto them, and enabled them for it, and for inditing those holy
Scriptures which they wrote: And thus, before they are aware, they make
themselves patrons of a notable point of Popery, viz. That their Covenant,
which sure was penned by men, and so but a humane writing, is of equal
authority with the sacred Scriptures: for if it be approved from heaven by
the fire of the Spirit, it must be so. But We hope that every man will pity
this frenzy, and give no credit to it, until they make it appear unto Us,
when and where God from heaven by the fire of his Spirit did seal and approve
this Covenant. The 13. reason is a mad one indeed, for it does condemn the
confession of faith which was first subscribed in 1580. upon which confession
they do solely ground their own Covenant; for that confession has no such
oath for reformation of life annexed unto it: The truth is, some thing they
would have said against Our Declaration, but they did not well know what: their
wits were run very low, when in an extraordinary Vow and Covenant with God,
they would put in Reformation of life, unto which every man is tied by the
ordinary moral precepts, both of Law and Gospel, and by the doctrine of
repentance contained in both: For the reason which is in their 14.15. and 16.
Reasons, We leave it for them to find that can, We are persuaded they will lose
their labor who seek it.

After their Reasons, they conclude with 7. Protestations, which truly need not
to be taken notice of; for being grounded upon so weak and inconsiderable
considerations, the Reader is unreasonable, like them, if he should expect a
conclusion stronger then the premises. In the preamble to them, take notice
only of their dangerous and fearful approach unto blasphemy, while they
affirm, That the Covenant made by them was sealed from heaven. Their first
Protestation is utterly invalid, being Protestatio contra factum; for it is
plain to the whole World, that the rebellious distractions of that Kingdom
proceed from them alone. Their second Protestation is void most evidently upon
the same ground; for they themselves, both by their public instructions, of
which you have heard, and in their private instructions, of which you shall
hear, have used many prelimitations in all the particulars against which they
protest, but neither We nor any by Our authority have used any. The third
Protestation begins with a supposition, which they themselves do know to be
most false; for both Archbishops and Bishops had, at the time of this their
Protestation, both by the Acts of the Church, and by the Acts of Parliament, a
settled office in the Church, and have so still by Parliament, nay and by
Assembly too, unless they do pitifully beg that which will never be granted
them, That their last Assembly at Glasgow was a lawful Assembly, after Our
Authority had dissolved it. And as it begins with a false supposition, so
it ends with as false and foolish a position and petition; For it
maintains, That all these who are to undergo any trial at the Assembly,
either upon any general complaint already made, or upon any particular
accusation to be given in against them, are to compeere at that Assembly, not
to have voice, but as rei: upon which ground, none of themselves could have
voice there; for they were all liable to trial and censure upon any particular
accusation that was to be given in against them: And then their petition is,
That the warning given to the Bishops by this Our Proclamation, and this their
Protestation, should be a sufficient Citation to them to appear as rei: That
their Protestation should be so; We protest it is so foolish a request, as We
are confident no man ever heard of the like before; nor could they expect that
any man, endued with reason, would yield unto it: And that our warning of the
Bishops by Proclamation to appear at the Assembly, as We did all the rest of
the members of it, should make them appear as rei, is such a conceit, as We
wonder any man could light upon it, unless they do hold, that every one of
themselves was to appear as reus too, for all of them were warned by Our
Proclamation to appear at the Assembly as well as the Bishops. In their fourth
Protestation We only admire their rare and undeniable impudence, who dare
affirm, that their Covenant is approved from heaven, with rare and undeniable
evidences, when all the Christians in the world (except themselves and their
faction) who have heard of it, do acknowledge that no such Covenant or
Combination can come from Heaven, but from Hell, from whence comes all faction
and schism. In their fifth Protestation they do run into an act of high
treason; for they appeal from Us and Our Council, which by an Act of
Parliament is made high treason, and which they know themselves was adjudged to
be so in the case of the Ministers, who held an Assembly at Aberdene, after it
was prorogued by Our royal Father, who being cited to compeere before the
Lords of the Council to answer that high contempt, and compeering, declined
the authority of Our royal Father and his Council, and appealed to a
General Assembly, and were therefore arraigned of high treason upon that
Statute before the Lord chief Justice of that Kingdom, and after pleading to
it by their Advocates, were found by a Jurie or Assize guilty of high treason;
and had received sentence accordingly, if Our royal Father, out of his
singular clemency and gracious respect to their calling, had not reprived them
before sentence, and only inflicted upon them perpetual banishment, which they
did undergo: The Act of Parliament upon which they were arraigned was this.

The eighth Parliament current holden at Edinburgh the 22. of May, in the year
of God 1584. by the right Excellent, right High and Mighty Prince James the
Sixth, by the grace of God, King of Scots, and three Estates of this Realm.
An Act confirming the Kings Majesty's royal power over all Estates and
subjects within this Realm.
FOrasmuch as some persons being lately called before the Kings Majesty and
his secret Council, to answer upon certain points to have been inquired of
them, concerning some treasonable, seditious, and contumelious speeches uttered
by them in Pulpits, Schools and otherways, to the disdain and reproach of
his Highness, his Progenitors, and present Council; contemptuously declined
the judgment of his Highness and his said Council in that behalf, to the
evil example of others to do the like if timely remedy be not provided:
Therefore our Sovereign Lord, and his three Estates assembled in this present
Parliament, ratifieth and approves, and perpetually confirms, the Royal
power and authority over all Estates, as well spiritual as temporal, within
this Realm, in the person of the Kings Majesty our Sovereign Lord, his Heirs
and Successors: And also, statuteth and ordains that his Highness, his
Heirs and Successors, by themselves and their Counsels, are and in time to
come shall be judges competent to all persons his Highness subjects, of what
estate, degree, function, or condition soever they be of, Spiritual or
Temporal, in all matters wherein they or any of them shall be apprehended,
summoned, or charged to answer to such things as shall be inquired of them by
our said Sovereign Lord and his Council. And that none of them which shall
happen to be apprehended, called or summoned to the effect aforesaid, presume
to take in hand to decline the judgment of his Highness, his Heirs and
Successors, or their Council in the premises, under the pain of treason.

Their sixth Protestation is nothing but a repetition of that which they have
said so often, even unto tediousness: In their seventh and last, they bewray an
unexempled boldness, in avowing their confidence of Our approbation to the
integrity of their hearts, and peaceablenesse of their ways and actions all
this time past, when in their own consciences they do know, that We do hold
and detest their ways and actions, as most unpeaceable and seditious.

And now having taken a short survey of this their Protestation, We do appeal
to any man, who shall compare it with Our Declaration, whether Our gracious
Proclamation, against which they protested, did not rather deserve an humble
and hearty acknowledgement of Our many graces and favors toward them, with a
joyful and submissive acceptance of them, then first to be traduced to the
people before it was made, for a Proclamation tending to the utter ruin and
subversion of the Religion and Laws of that Church and Kingdom; and then
afterward to be encountered in public with such an impudent, insolent,
seditious, and senseless Protestation: And lastly, after all this, to be railed
at in their Pulpits, and Our people made to believe, that that part of it which
required subscription to their own confession of faith, but lately sworn and
subscribed unto by themselves, was a device of the Devil, and hatched in Hell,
as shall appear by that which followed.

For the next day, being Sunday, all the Pulpits of Edinburgh, nay and many
places where there were no Pulpits (for they heard Sermons in many Halls, and
other profane and common places) did ring with bitter invectives and
declamations against this Our gracious Declaration, especially against that
part of it which they conceived would be most satisfactorie to Our people, and
prove a special Antidote for expelling that poison which they had made them
swallow, concerning Our declining from the Reformed Religion, and inclining to
Popery, viz. the subscription to their own confession of faith now commanded
by Us: For, they branded it so with most hideous and horrible names of the very
depth and policy of Satan, that the common people, who were well persuaded of
the piety of their Preachers, could not choose but imagine that there was some
wickedness in it, which their Preachers could and did dive into though they
did not. One Preacher in his Sermon prayed God to scatter them in Israel, and
to divide them in Jacob who were the authors of this scattering and divisive
counsel. Another Preacher in his Pulpit told his people, that the urging of
this subscription, was an Italian and a devilish device, first to make them
renounce God, and perjure themselves, and then afterward there was an intention
to destroy their bodies; and so that this subscription imported no less then
the destruction both of their bodies and souls. These and many more such false
fears suggested, first from two of the Preachers of Edinburgh, and from them
transmitted to their fellows throughout the Kingdom, did work so strongly
with Our good but simple and seduced people, as that they were wrought unto a
persuasion, that this subscription to their own confession of faith, commanded
by Us, for removing that false opinion which their Leaders had put into their
heads of Our inclination to Popery, was of a far deeper reach, and of more
dangerous consequence, then if We had been inclined to Popery indeed; still
adding, That if they did subscribe it now by Our authority, it could receive
no acceptance at Gods hands, God rejecting any service done to him by
constraint (it being very familiar with them at these times to term obedience
to authority constraint) but when they subscribed it voluntarily, or by the
persuasion of their Leaders, then it was acceptable to God; and, if they durst
have used such a Popish word, no question they would have added, Meritorious:
And thus you see, with what undutifulnesse Our gracious Declaration was
entertained.

Yet it was not so received by all: For first, all the Lords of Our Council
(amongst whom were some, who never seemed to be satisfied before) were so fully
satisfied, and so much overjoyed with this Our gracious Declaration, that they
did condemn and utterly detest this odious Protestation of the Covenanters;
whereupon Our Councels Letter of thanks and proffer of service was sent Us, as
was before declared.

Next, the greatest part of the Ministers of that Our Kingdom did rest
satisfied with it; as shall be made evident if it come to trial: But this is
most certain, that the Ministers assembled at Edinburgh that morning at the
Gray-Friers Church by the name of the fourth Table, or Table of the Ministers
ordinarily resident at Edinburgh all this time, for attendance upon the
business of the Covenant, being sent unto by the other Tables, and desired by
them to send some of their number up to the great Committee of all the Tables,
to join with them in a Protestation which was to be made that afternoon
against Our Declaration, which then they expected would be proclaimed; the
Ministers returned this answer by their whole voices (not above two or three at
the most dissenting) That they would not agree to any Protestation which should
be made against Our gracious Declaration, unless it should be sent down unto
them, that it might be thoroughly advised upon; especially considering that they
had heard so much of the contents of that Our Declaration, importing the
removing of their grievances which occasioned their Covenant, that they could
not conceive the necessity of any Protestation. Which answer being returned to
the other Tables, did so trouble them, that they sent a second message to them,
entreating them presently to come up to Saint Gyles Church, and to sit there,
that so being in a place of a near distance from their great Committee, they
might the more easily consult with them. Thither they came, and stayed a great
while, but heard nothing from the Committee, who it seems were much distracted
and puzzled about the penning of their Protestation, and had certain Ministers
with them (especially Rollock) at that consultation, who were not deputed by
the Table of Ministers to be present at it; and having stayed in that Church
until near one of the clock in the afternoon, dissolved themselves, took
their leaves one of another, and resolved not to meet until the next week,
many of them going home presently toward their own country Churches, where
they were to preach the next day, being Sunday; and at their parting they
deputed none to join with the Committee from the other Tables, either to
consult about, or to assist at any Protestation which should be made against
this Our gracious Declaration: And all this was averred by diverse Ministers
then present, before diverse of the Lords of Our Council, and other persons of
special rank and quality, who likewise would have averred it before the last
pretended General Assembly, if they durst have done it without running the
hazard of their fortunes, if not their lives: And yet in that afternoon about
three of the clock, Rollock, in the name of the Ministers, did upon a Scaffold
join with the deputies from the three other Tables, in that wicked
Protestation, without deputation (as is presumed) from the Table of Ministers,
unless perhaps he called some few straggling Ministers about the town, of whom
it may be he asked the question.

Besides, many thousands of Our subjects Covenanters were fully satisfied with
Our Declaration, though they durst not, as many of them have professed,
subscribe this confession of faith urged by Us, for fear of being troubled by
the major part. And it is known, that wheresoever Our Declaration was
published, before that the Covenanters from their Tables sent their emissaries
to dissuade the acknowledgment of it, and copies of their Protestations against
it, it was received with all expressions of joy and thankful acknowledgment;
insomuch that when it was proclaimed at the market Cross at Glasgow, it was
assisted with all these expressions, both by the Magistrates and all the
inhabitants, by the Principal, the Regents and Professors, by all the
Ministers of that City, though Covenanters, who out of the great sense of the
many obligations and favors, which We had laid upon that whole Kingdom, by
this Our gracious Declaration, directed their several letters of thanks and
acknowledgement to Our Commissioner, which are here exhibited.

The Letter of the Provost, Bailiffes, and the Council of Glasgow.

The Letter of the Ministers.
Most honorable and our very good Lord,
HAving received the Letter directed from your Grace, and having heard and
considered his Majesty's most gracious Proclamation published this day in this
City, with joyful acclamations universally of the hearers, as we of the
Ministry and University of Glasgow, who were present, with great contentment
and joy of heart applauded thereto; and do praise God who has inspired our
dread Sovereign with such wisdom, piety, clemency, and fatherly care of
the Church and Commonwealth of this Kingdom, as is abundantly manifested in
the said Proclamation; So we would gladly testify, by what means we can, our
thankfulness to his Majesty, our Crown of rejoicing, and the breath of our
nostrils; not omitting our bound duty to your Grace, whom God and his Majesty
has appointed so fit and happy an instrument in this great errand, for your
singular prudence, rare piety, and zeal to God, your Prince, and Country,
and incredible pains in this honorable and weighty employment, which we pray
God may still prosper in your hands, until it be brought to a full and blessed
conclusion, being willing for our part to contribute what lies in our poor
power by our earnest prayers and best endeavors.

NOw, besides these, in many places of the Kingdom whither they sent their
Protestation to be read, it was refused by diverse, who had subscribed their
own Covenant.

The Assembly being indicted, the Covenanters did now go about to effect all
which they had plotted and designed concerning the election of the
Commissioners to it, That all, and none but they, might be chosen whom they had
resolved upon, and were of the most rigid rank, whom they were sure would
receive no satisfaction, and keep all others (so far as in them lay) from
accepting of any: Their device was this; They perceived that most of the
Ministers throughout the Kingdom would gladly embrace peace, if they might see
their consciences satisfied in these fears and doubts, upon which they entered
into the late Covenant. The Leaders resolved not to trust any such moderate
men, considering that all their scruples were removed by Our last Declaration,
and the indiction of a free general Assembly; and therefore they took order by
their secret instructions, that none of them should be chosen, though they were
Covenanters: For Ministers non-Covenanters, they took order, that if in any
place by plurality of voices such a one should be chosen, then he should be
processed and protested against, (which no man could avoid) and so he should be
sure to be set by at the Assembly, and cast from having any voice there. And
whereas they might fear, that the rigid Ministers, designed by them for this
Assembly, might want a sufficient number of their fellow-Ministers for their
elections in their several Presbyteries, they took an order, That not only
for this time, but for all times to come, there should be no Minister chosen
Commissioner from any Presbytery to any Assembly, but such as the Laity
should make choice of: For they presently gave order from their Tables, That
every particular Parish should send to the Presbytery in their bounds one
Layman, whom they called a Ruling Elder, who by their appointment should have
voice in the Presbytery as well as the Minister of the Parish; so that when the
whole Presbytery was assembled together, the number of the Laymen was at the
least equal to the number of the Ministers; By which new device, the Laity
gained of the Ministers undoubtedly these four things: concluded in a general
Assembly, should ever be concluded likewise in a Parliament, if Our negative
voice did not stop it: (and We hear that they have not spared to give out,
that they will take from Us and Our Successors, that which all Our
Predecessors have enjoyed, that is, a negative voice in Parliament, as they
have done in Assemblies, for as much as lies in them:) For by their
instructions they ordered, That where any Nobleman lived in any Presbytery,
he should be chosen lay-Elder there for the Assembly; and all Noblemen are
hereditarie members of the Parliament: and where there wanted a Nobleman, they
should choose some special Gentleman, who in all probability stands fair
for being chosen one of the Commissioners of the Shire for the Parliament;
which made the Covenanters stand so importunately for that point, viz. to have
the Assembly held before the Parliament, as making just account, that all the
lay voices in the Assembly were engaged to give their voices to the same
conclusions, when they should sit in Parliament; and so, that the Parliament,
for it Acts, should depend upon the general Assembly, and the general
Assembly (for the Acts passed there) should depend upon them; but neither the
one nor the other depend upon Us.

These conclusions, though effected by the Laity with violence, yet received
great resistance by many Ministers in most Presbyteries, and in some by all:
For when these Lay Elders came to sit with them, they either refused to admit
them, or desired time to deliberate, how they (who being Covenanters, and had
complained of Innovations) could admit of such innovations as those which
seemed to threaten the ruin of the Liberty of the Church, for these Reasons:

But all this opposition and arguing was fruitless: For the Lay Elders,
according to their secret instructions from the Covenanters Tables, which
afterward shall be related, would not remove, but put themselves in possession
of suffrage, and so these Ministers, and none but they, were chosen in each
Presbytery whom the Tables at Edinburgh had designed: A thing so odious and
distasteful to the Ministers, that in some Presbyteries, the Ministers (chosen
Commissioners) had but eight Ministers voices, and the voices of two and
twenty Laymen, in others not above two Ministers voices, in some but one; but
in all Presbyteries the Ministers Commissioners were elected by the plurality
of Layvoices. Some of these Ministers, though Covenanters, seeing the liberty
of the Church by this means utterly lost and betrayed, did repair to the two
Covenanting Ministers of Edinburgh, to whom they bemoaned themselves, wondering
that they would give way to the utter defacing of the Church by these Laick
intrusions; to whom they gave this answer, That they grieved for it as much as
themselves, but that the necessity of the times was such, that they must wink
at it, else the Nobility, Gentry, and Burrowes did threaten them with a
desertion, upon which a division must follow, which by their Oath and Covenant
they were bound by all means to prevent. But the aggrieved Ministers were not
satisfied with such cold, comfortless, and unconscionable answers, but
resolved in many Presbyteries to draw up their Protestations against the Lay
Elders to the Assembly; yet they were so threatened by the Laity, that most of
them fell back and durst not adventure upon it, though others both Covenanters
and Non-covenanters had the courage to do it, but with what success shall be
declared when We come to speak of the Assembly it self. Yet this We will
confidently aver, That when Our Commissioner came last from that Our
Kingdom, three parts of four of all the Covenanting Ministers did detest the
elections made by lay Elders, and would have declared the nullitie of all such
elections if they durst have done it; and that these Ministers, (unless they
have changed their minds since) had rather live under Episcopal government,
then under the tyranny of the Laity and a few Ministers, from whom they have
suffered more in a few months, then ever they did under all the Bishops in the
Kingdom, since Our coming to the Crown: all which very many of them have
affirmed, both for themselves and others, to Our Commissioner, diverse of Our
Council, and others of good credit and quality, whom We dare and do trust.

But the elections being now past according as they had plotted them, or in
good forwardness so to be where they were not yet past, the Covenanters next
care was, how to hinder the subscription of the confession of Faith commanded
by Us, they conceiving it their masterpiece to stop any thing (though never so
well liked by themselves) if it were commanded by Our authority; as fearing,
that if We had obedience given to Us in any one thing, Our people might recover
the taste of government: And hearing that Our Commissioner was to repair to
the College of Justice, there to tender to the Lords of Our Session, who are
the supreme Judges of Our Laws in that Kingdom, the confession of Faith and
band annexed, to be sworn by Our authority, that very morning they set up
Rollock to preach, (though it was not his ordinary course) where many of Our
Judges were present before they went to sit: There he with many false and
foolish impertinences did so labor to persuade them, that the swearing of that
confession was unlawful and plain perjurie, that he showed himself a
ridiculous and most dishonest man to most that were present, and a weak man to
all; and so little he prevailed, that immediately after Sermon, the Judges
repairing to their usual place of sitting, whither Our Commissioner came
presently and tendered them the said confession, all of them, except four who
were known to be of the false stamp, did swear to it and subscribe it, the
number of the Judges in all being twenty.

And here We desire the Reader to observe, whether these men shall not be
accounted a faction, and not a body of a Kingdom, when they shall separate
themselves from Us; who are their Sovereign, from the body of Our Council,
who have the supreme government of the Kingdom under Us, and from the body of
Our Judges, who are the Interpreters of Our Laws, and under Us the supreme
Judges of all their estates and fortunes, these two Judicatories, together with
Our Judges in criminal causes, being under Us, by the Laws, constituted the
only Judges of all their actions: For if these Covenanters shall ascribe unto
themselves the government, because they are more in number then those who
disassent from them, then certainly in all Kingdoms and Republiques, the
established government must go down; for in them all, they who are ruled and
governed are far more then the Rulers and Governors.

They then seeing that their fierce endeavors were fruitless with the Lords
of the Session, with all speed dispatched some of their Tables throughout all
parts of the Kingdom, to stop the subscription to the confession of faith
commanded by Us, with copies of their Protestation to be read in all places,
where Our Commissioners should either proclaim Our Declaration, or require
subscription to that confession: In many places they prevailed, in many not;
Where they prevailed, they used such indirect and violent courses, as they
gained an assent from many men's mouths, whose minds were very far from it. In
Glasgow, after that the Lord Lowdan, with diverse others, Noblemen, Gentlemen,
and Ministers, sent (as they pretended) from the Tables at Edinburgh, had
caused to be read that infamous Libell (of which you shall hear afterward)
against the Archbishop of Glasgow in his own Cathedral Church, without the
knowledge of the Magistrates of that City; the Lord Lowdan desired the Provost
of Glasgow to convocate their Town Council, that he might impart some things
unto them; which the Provost refused: But that Lord and his Associates,
understanding that their ordinary Church Session sat that afternoon, at
which the Magistrates and Ministers were to be present, came suddenly into the
place where they did sit, beyond their expectation, where the Lord Lowdan made
a speech of great length, concerning the iniquity and danger of Our Covenant,
adjuring them both by persuasions and threatenings, that they would not
subscribe the confession of faith required by Us; and therefore his demand was,
That he might have the assured promises of the Magistrates and Ministers, that
they would not subscribe it, that so he might report their answer to the Tables
from whence he was sent: To which the Provost presently answered, That his
Lordship knew well that Our Commissioner had required from them a subscription
to Our Covenant, that they had humbly entreated of his Grace some short time to
return their answer; and therefore he wondered that any man should think it
was fit to answer any who was sent from the Tables, before they had made their
answer to Our Commissioner; and so refusing to give any answer to these
Emissaries from the Tables, they went away unsatisfied.

The Covenanters, finding that Our commanding of the subscription of the
confession of faith; in many places had given satisfaction, and had indeed
confuted that lying scandal of Our inclination to Popery, and that many of
the Covenanters had remitted much of their former rigor, being much taken with
Our last gracious Proclamation, the Heads and swayers of the four Tables, (as
if all their designs were come to the last cast) cast about once again, and
labored hard to work Our people into the belief of this one point, That none
of these things promised in Our last gracious Proclamation, no not the Assembly
it self, were ever intended to be performed by Us; That We only studied to
gain time, until We were ready for their ruin; and therefore they gave out,
that Our Commissioners late coming from Hammilton to Edinburgh was only to
prorogue the Assembly. They spent days and nights in penning a Protestation
against it, and writing multitudes of copies to be ready in all places of the
Kingdom, before the Proclamations of the prorogation should arrive. They sent
for all their party to flock to Edinburgh, as if now there were greater
danger then ever: All which was carried with notable hypocrisy; for the
authors of this report did disperse it, not that they did believe it to be
true, but because it was conduceable to their ends to have the people believe
it.

But knowing that they who do act long parts, must needs sometimes be out, and
that the time of the Assembly beginning to approach, and Our Commissioners
provisions and preparations for his journey to Glasgow, were far stronger
proofs to Our people of Our holding the Assembly, then all which they had
surmised to the contrary, they then betook themselves to their last shift,
which was a miserable and wicked one, and it was this: Since they were
persuaded that the Assembly indicted by Us would now hold if they could not
divert it, they resolved to take such courses, as they conceived Our
Commissioner neither could nor would endure; with which they did conceive they
should so irritate him, that he could not choose but either discharge or
prorogue the Assembly. For two things now they feared: First, that they had
committed a great error in petitioning Us for an Assembly, which they
conceived was fully in their own power to indict; and therefore did begin to
think, that by that act they had weakened their own power and claim, and
supposed, that it had been more agreeable to their designs, if they had
indicted one themselves, being the title which they meant to stand to, as
appears by their own indiction of a new Assembly, since the dissolution of
this. Secondly, they were afraid of nothing more then this, that Our
Commissioners propounding and passing into acts of Assembly, all the
particulars of Our grace and favor contained in Our last Proclamation, would
abundantly satisfy the greatest part of their own party, when they should
see the grounds of their fears of innovations in Religion removed, which
occasioned them to enter into the late Covenant: But now, if Our Commissioner
could be forced any way, either to prorogue or discharge this Assembly indicted
by Us, that then they would presently indict one themselves, which they were
sure We would not countenance with any Commissioner from Us; by which means
they were both secured from having their party weakened by Our propounding in
Assembly Our gracious offers expressed in Our last Declaration, and were
certainly persuaded, that they should easily induce Our people to believe, that
these things promised in that Declaration were never intended by Us.

To compass therefore their desires of Our Commissioners either proroguing or
discharging the Assembly, they resolved to increase their disorders to such a
height, as they hoped he would never endure them; and to multiply so many
affronts upon him, and in him upon Us and Our authority, as they imagined
should be past all sufferance: As first, by their letters directed from their
Tables at Edinburgh, they quarrelled with Our Commissioner, that Our Confession
and Covenant was commanded to be subscribed in many parts of the Kingdom by
the authority of Us and Our Council, with an unbeseeming violence: The copy
of their Letter to Our Commissioner, being then at Hammilton, here follows.

Please your Grace,
We were glad of the indiction of an Assembly, as the mean to bring our
complaints to an end: And as we promised for our part to do our endeavor, that
all matters might be carried in a peaceable way, and no man troubled in any
sort till that time, so did we certainly expect that no violence or molestation
should have been used against any of those who had subscribed the late
Covenant: and yet, far contrary to our expectation, are brought hither almost
every hour grievous complaints from many of the people, in diverse parts of the
Kingdom, That they are by the threatenings and open violence of some
Statesmen, Councillors, and Barons, constrained to subscribe a Confession of
Faith, and Band; some with blind and doubting minds, and others against their
consciences, to the great trouble of their souls, and great disturbance of the
peace of the Country, contrary to such peaceble preparations as should have
preceded a perfect pacification at a General Assembly. If we had heard but
some complaints of this kind, we would have spared both your Graces pains and
our own, but complaints being multiplied more and more, we could not of duty
but make some representation thereof to your Grace, that some course may be
taken for present suppressing this so irreligious and unjust manner of doing;
and for preventing the hard consequences that may ensue from people who are
thus pressed to subscribe against their minds, and from others who are joined
in Covenant with them; which, as it is humbly petitioned, so it is confidently
expected by

THe complaint contained in this Letter did afterward prove to be most unjust;
and yet it was dispersed through the Kingdom with horrible and most false
aggravations, viz. That some of Our Council with charged Pistolls and drawn
Daggers held to the breasts of Our subjects, had forced them to subscribe Our
Covenant: To this their Letter Our Commissioner returned an answer, though not
to their Table, because he would not acknowledge it, yet to that Nobleman,
whose hand was first at it: The copy of which answer is this.

My very good Lord,
I Have received from your Lordsh: and other Noblemen a Letter, containing a
complaint against the violence offered to diverse of his Majesty's subjects, by
Statesmen, Councillors, and others; and that complaint aggravated by your
promising and undertaking, for your self and all your adherents, that no man
should be troubled till the General Assembly; and your just expectation that
the same course should have been held on the other side by us.

For the former, I know not what Statesmen, Noblemen or Barons, your Lordsh:
means* for naming none, I know not to whom I shall take my self; nor do I
know what violence and threatenings you mean: If you mean his Majesty's
Commissioners appointed by the King, they requiring his subjects to subscribe
the old Confession and Covenant, by his authority now renewed, and
remonstrating unto them the danger they incur by law in not obeying his
Majesty's commandment, I hope that cannot be called violence but duty, the
omission whereof, must needs be a violation of, and violence offered to his
Majesty's sacred authority: If other violences and threatenings they have used,
as your Lordsh: seems to intimate (for their obedience to his Majesty's just
authority, I am sure, your Lordsh: will not call violence) they must answer for
it, and shall whenever your Lordsh: shall make known the delinquents. But
alas my Lords, Tell me now in good earnest whether you have heard they have
used such violence in persuading this Covenant, as has been used by your
adherents in enforcing of yours? has the blood of Gods servants, his holy
Ministers, been shed, which blood I am afraid keeps the vengeance of God
still hanging over this Land? have men been beaten, turned out of their
livings and maintenance, reviled and excommunicated in the Pulpits, and a
thousand more outrages acted upon them, for not subscribing this Covenant? have
none who have subscribed your Covenant, done it with blind and doubting minds?
If they have, I beseech your Lordsh: not to call his Majesty's Councillors
legal proceedings, irreligious and unjust, until you have proved the piety
and justice of the proceedings of your own adherents.

For the other, of your undertaking and promising for your parts, that no man
should be troubled till the Assembly, and expecting the like from us, truly I
am glad I have it under your Lordsh: hands; for I think there are few hours of
any one day, since the indicting of the Assembly, that from all parts of this
Kingdom, I am not vexed with complaints of new processing of Ministers, new
withholding of Ministers stipends unprocessed, heavy complaints of Ministers
of your own Covenant, that they are threatened, and that sharply and bitterly,
for their declaring of their grief, in being barred of their freedom in the
election of their own Commissioners to the General Assembly, and being borne
down by the multitude of Lay voices, and menaced because of their protesting
against the same.

The complaints of Ministers Non-Covenanters and Lay Elders Non-Covenanters,
chosen by their Sessions to assist at the election of the Commissioners from
the Presbyteries, but turned back, for not having subscribed your Covenant,
and reviled with bitter words, for being so pert as to come thither; is this
the performance of promising, that no man shall be troubled till the Assembly?
These are, indeed, preparations very unfit to precede this Assembly, they
being so unpeaceable and like to take up much time, in discussing at that great
Meeting the illegality of these elections. My Lord, the truth is, I shall be as
careful to see any wrong offered by his Majesty's Commissioners (in urging his
Majesty's authority) punished, when I shall know the offenses and the
offenders, as I am heartily grieved at the proceedings of your Associats: Here
I am sure, his Majesty's Commissioners have been rather backward then forward,
but so have not your Lordsh: adherents been; for they have in very many places
proclaimed your Protestation, where his Majesty's Declaration has not been
proclaimed. I hope your Lordsh: will pardon my unusual prolixitie; for I
confess I am much troubled to see his Majesty's good subjects led into such
misconstructions of his pious and religious intentions toward them. This my
Letter, I pray your Lordsh: to communicate to the other Noble Lords, who
subscribed that to me. To your self and them, I pray your Lordsh: commend the
true respects of

Your Lordsh. For the Earl of Cassills.


THis Letter it seems gave them no satisfaction, for they still continued
their reports: Besides, they had the boldness by another Letter from the same
Table, sent likewise to Our Commissioner, being then at Hammilton, to
expostulate with him, that one of Our Ships at sea had searched a Scottish
Merchants Ship for Ammunition, when as they themselves before had searched a
Merchants Ship for some Ammunition, which We had sent for Scotland, and would
have seized upon it, if they had not been prevented; and immediately after, a
little English Vessel carrying Beer to some part of that Kingdom, was
likewise stayed and searched by them. In the same Letter they quarrel with Our
Commissioner, for hindering the bringing of Horses from England thither, which
is unlawful for any one to do, without a special license from the Master of
Our Horse: The copy of their Letter, filled with their ordinary pretenses of
Religion, and Our Commissioners Answer unto it, be these.

Please your Grace,
AFter your parting from us, we had knowledge from John Wilson Skipper, and
sundry of his Passengers newly arrived, That being at Sea on his way from
Holland hither, one of his Majesty's small ships of eight Pieces, came aboard
and searched him for Arms and Ammunition, declaring they did the same by his
Majesty's Warrant. We do not so much value the hazard of any prejudice, as we
are heartily grieved to find any such note of his Majesty's displeasure,
differencing us from his other subjects, when our own hearts and the Lord that
searches them does hear witness of our loyalty and affection to his
Majesty, especially to have found it now when we are made so secure, both by
the hopes of obteyning from his Majesty's favor, by your mediation, these
ordinary and public remedies that can fully settle this Church and State, and
by assurance from your Grace we should find no such hard dealing, during the
time of your employment amongst the subjects here, who trust in your care to
prevent speedily the inconvenience of this, as you did in that other late
particular anent the arrest of our horses in England. We think this
advertisment sufficient to your Grace, who is wounded through our sides if we
suffer any thing in this time, being so far interessed to vindicate us from
such prejudice, who do acknowledge our selves to be

My Lord,
I Have received a Letter this day signed by your Lordsh: and sundry other
Noblemen, making mention, that one John Wilson Skipper, being on his way from
Holland hither, was searched by one of his Majesty's small ships. This is no
new nor unaccustomed thing; for commonly the Captains of his Majesty's ships
during the time of being at sea, do take notice what the loadings of all such
ships are, as they meet with, who trade in the Channel; it being a prerogative
that belongs to his Imperall Crown* I am persuaded that your Lordsh: and the
rest of my Lords cannot think, but if his Majesty had been desirous to have
made stop of importation of Ammunition into this Kingdom this time past, but
it would have been an easy matter for him to have effected; but so little has
he regarded this, as he has not so much as taken notice of it: And yet it were
no strange thing, if his Majesty should give direction to cause examine for
what end so great store of Ammunition is imported into this Kingdom, and a
little more narrowly to look into our actions; when, by I know not whom, there
has been so much notice taken of such Ammunition, as his Majesty has thought
fit to send hither. For notwithstanding that your Lordsh: says we are made
secure by the hopes of obtaining from his Majesty these remedies that can
fully settle this Church and State, yet I may say courses are taken to put
fears in his Majesty's good subjects minds, by persuading of them that no such
thing is intended: This does too too manifestly appear by the watching and
guarding his Majesty's Castle, and many other courses; but of this I will write
nothing, my intention being only to return answer of what is writ to me: And
therefore for your Lordsh: satisfaction I shall acquaint his Majesty with the
contents of your letters, who will no doubt give such directions therein, as
his good subjects will have no just cause of complaint: Whereas you have been
pleased to say, that you have been assured by me, that you should receive no
such hard dealing, during the time of my employment; let me desire you to
consider this aright, and you will find it none; for neither was that ship
stayed from proceeding in their intended voyage, nor any thing taken from them:
nor needs your Lordsh: to doubt that his Majesty will do any thing (except
our own indiscretion provoke him) that may make appear to the world that he
makes a difference betwixt us of this Nation and his other subjects. Be
confident, my Lord, that my endeavors have, and do tend to no other end, but
to the glory of God, the honor of his sacred Majesty, and the preserving from
ruin this poor distracted Kingdom; and that I have and shall labor to
prevent all such accidents as may breed the least stop or hinderance of this
wished event, which I hope and am confident that your Lordsh. and all those
noble Lords who have signed this Letter to me, will take the same to heart; and
then certainly you will not be so easily moved with such light and slight
reports: Nor will your Lordsh: think that either you or I can be wounded by
the order and command of so pious, merciful, and so clement a Prince as is our
dread Sovereign, who has shown himself to be so full of goodness, as we
must of all men living prove the worst, if we be not thankful to God, and him
for it. This my letter your Lordsh: will be pleased to communicate to the rest
who have writ to me, and esteem of me as

Hammilt. 24. Sept. 1638. For the Earl of Rothees. Your Lordships humble
servant, Hammiltoun.


WIth his answer they were so far from being satisfied, that to answer this
affront (as they did interpret it) for searching a Ship of that Kingdom at
sea, they resolved to put a greater affront upon Us, by increasing their Guards
about Our Castle of Edinburgh: In Fyfe, they gave order for a Communion
throughout their Churches, at which they made every one to swear that they
should not subscribe Our Confession and Covenant, nor any other but their own,
which they swore again de novo; especially to stand to that part of it which
concerns mutual defense against all persons whomsoever. They gave general
order for the Fast to be kept on the fourth of November, being Sunday,
neglecting the day designed in Our Proclamation, which was the Wednesday
following, and the seventh of that Month.

Our Commissioner seeing these contempts daily to increase, and hearing that
they had appointed the Communion to be celebrated at Edinburgh, sent for the
Provost and Magistrates, and inquired of them these particulars: First, whether
at their Communion (which was to be celebrated the two next Sundaies following)
it was intended, that the like oath should be taken with them, as had been
taken in Fyfe: Secondly, whether they intended to keep the Fast Day designed by
Us in Our Proclamation, and according as they had lately since been required to
do, by an order sent from Our Council to them for that purpose: Thirdly, what
order they had taken with those, who had the day before reviled and abused
Doctor Eliot while he was preaching in the Pulpit. That he had sent for them,
because he had found those few Ministers, by whom they were ruled, to be
unreasonable men, and despisers of Authority. To the last, they promised that
they would make a discovery of the offenders, and see them punished; which
they never did: For the first, they thought it most unreasonable that any oath
should be ministered as it was in Fyfe: For the second, they thought it most
reasonable that Our Fast Day should be kept but before they could give a full
answer, they must first confer with their Ministers; at their meeting with
whom, they found that the Ministers had intended that barbarous oath at the
Communion, and not to keep Our Fast Day more then other Churches in the
country had done: yet the Magistrates did with much persuasions overruled them
in both. Our Commissioner did resolve with great solemnity, attended with all
Our Council and Judges, to keep that Fast in the great Church of Edinburgh, on
the day appointed by Us, and gave notice thereof to the Magistrates; who
returned him thanks, and assurance of welcome; But understanding that they were
resolved to discharge the ordinary Ministers of that Church, from preaching
there that day, only because they were Non-covenanters, and had appointed
their places to be supplied with the two only Covenanting Ministers of their
Town, he sent for the Magistrates again, telling them, That he could not come
to their Church, and countenance so great a disorder as the displacing of the
two Preachers of that Church, only because they were faithful subjects to Us;
nor durst hear these two Preachers designed by them, who in their Pulpits did
ordinarily inveigh against Us and Our authority: Unless therefore he might
either nominate the Preachers, or hear the ordinary Preachers of that Church,
he must not come thither. The Magistrates did what they could to persuade with
their Ministers; the one of them was contented with Our Commissioners desire,
but the other was so obstinate, as he would no way hearken to it; and him
(being so powerful with the people) the Magistrates durst not offend: and so
Our Commissioner, with Our Council and Judges, were necessitated to keep Our
Fast at another Church hard by Our Palace. Now We desire the Reader to
observe, how the Heads of the Covenanters were afraid that any show of
obedience should be yielded unto Us by Our people in the least point, they
having ordered, that in most places of the Kingdom, the day designed by Us for
the Fast should not be observed; certainly, only because it was commanded by
Us, as being unwilling that We, (whom they had given out to Our people for an
Innovator in Religion, and an Introducer of Popery) should be thought by them
to have any care of so religious an exercise as a solemn Fast; And how that in
Edinburgh, though the Magistrates by their earnest entreaty had procured the
observation of it, yet they could not obtain it without putting a special
affront upon authority, by displacing of those Ministers who had continued in
loyalty and obedience to Us.

But these were nothing to their other violences, whereby they would have Our
Commissioner take notice that it was impossible their proceedings at the
Assembly should be pleasing unto Us: For not only in many of their Pulpits
did they preach, That whosoever subscribed Our Covenant, were perjured and
villains, but when some affirmed the contrary, and reproved the Preachers for
such furious speeches after their Sermon was ended, they were cited before
their Presbyteries for so doing, and threatened with excommunication: Nay, more
then so, there were few Ministers of the Kingdom, not subscribers of their
Covenant, whom they did not presently process and cite before their several
Presbyteries; and notwithstanding their Appeals to the General Assembly then
approaching, yet they would not show so much patience, but proceeded to present
most illegal, and unwarrantable suspending of them, and other censures, as
best pleased them; which being complained of to Our Commissioner and Council,
could find no redress, although they sent many times to the Covenanters,
requiring them to forbear all such unjust proceedings, and to refer the
trial of these oppressed Ministers causes to the General Assembly, which was
now at hand.

None were so insolent as the Presbytery of Edinburgh; for they presently put
very many of their Ministers under process: They begun with one Master David
Michell Minister of Edinburgh; Our Commissioner wrote earnestly to that
Presbytery, to forbear proceeding against him until the Assembly, to the
which he had appealed, and where his cause might have a full and fair trial;
which they not only most unjustly rejected, but were so unmannerly, as they did
not vouchsafe to answer his Letter, either by message or otherwise: The next
Presbytery day he wrote to them again to the same purpose, but with the like
success; for they proceeded without taking notice of his Letter, or returning
any answer to it, although in that second Letter he had desired them, either to
delay their proceedings that day, or else to send one or more of their number
to him, (being then hard by at Our Palace at Holy-rood-house) who might show
him some reason why they could not stay so long as until the Assembly, which
was now so near approaching. Our Commissioner wondering at this contempt, by
the advice of some of the principal Lords of Our Council, sent for an Officer
of Our Council, and directed him to them with an ordinary warrant drawn up
in an ordinary form by the Clerk of Our Council, requiring them in Our name,
under pain of Our high displeasure, and as they would answer the contrary at
their utmost peril, to desist from any further proceeding in that cause until
the General Assembly; to which the Defendant had appealed, and which was to
begin within fourteen days: This warrant was delivered unto them by the
Officer of Our Council, in whose audience it was read, and when he required
an answer to it, he received none, but in highest contempt of Our Crown,
Dignity, and Royal commandment, and against all rules of Justice (the
Appellants appeal to the superior Court of a General Assembly, legally
depending) for doctrines preached by him four year since at least, and the
witnesses being all Laymen, who (besides their no extraordinary memory for
such a time as was laid) were men of such mean and ordinary understanding, as
that it was improbable, if not impossible, that they should understand the
doctrines wherewith he was charged; and some of them being uncontroverted, and
such as are generally received by all Protestant Churches in the world; they
presently suspended him, and discharged him from the place of his Ministry;
and afterward, to make their contempt the greater, sent down three of their
number to tell Our Commissioner that they had done so, who offered to show him
reasons for their so doing: But Our Commissioner told them, That since they
were not pleased to show him their reasons before their sentence as he
required, he would not hear their reasons after their sentence as they
desired. But to let pass this and many more their such unjust proceedings,
against those Ministers which continued in Our obedience, in all places of the
Kingdom, even when the Assembly was ready to begin, notwithstanding these
Ministers legal appeals thereunto, We shall desire the Reader to observe
their proceedings in one process, which We are confident was framed and
pursued with such malice, injustice, falsehood, and scandal, not only to the
reformed Religion in particular, but to the Christian Religion in general, as
it cannot be paralleled by any president of injustice in precedent ages, nor
(We hope) shall ever be followed in future, and which if it were known amongst
Turks, Pagans, or Infidels, would make them abhor the Christian Religion, if
they did think it would either countenance or could consist with such
abominable impiety and injustice.

It is their process against all and every one of the Archbishops and Bishops
of that Kingdom: The Covenanters did indeed first desire Our Commissioner, in
his own name and as he was Our Commissioner, to grant out process against
the Archbishops and Bishops, and thereby to cite them to appear as rei, or
guilty persons: To whom he returned this fair answer, That he did not hold it
fit to cite them as guilty, of whose guiltiness he had no presumptions; and
besides that he would be loath to do an act which should void, according to
their grounds, both the Prelates places and voices in the Assembly, they having
laid it down for a rule (though it were a false one) that parties cyted can
have no suffrage there; yet if either by the Law or practice of that Kingdom,
the Kings Commissioner or Commissioners did use to grant out any such process,
he would not refuse it, being resolved to concur with them in any course of
Justice: but he hoped that they would not make Us his master, or himself do
any act prejudicial to the Bishops, their place and government, before they
were heard, and that in the mean time for their satisfaction he would advise
with some of Our Judges and Our Advocate, whether any such process was
awardable, or had usually been awarded by Our Royal Fathers Commissioners to
the General Assembly, and according to their advice he would do that which
should be agreeable to Justice. From this answer of Our Commissioner, they
expected no satisfaction to their desire; for they themselves did know as well
as any Judge or Advocate in the Kingdom, that no Commissioner either could
award or ever had awarded any such process as they required: And therefore
they moved Our Commissioner once again, that he would require Our Judges or
Lords of Our Session, to grant out such process; with which request, when Our
Commissioner made Our Judges acquainted, they returned him that answer which
the Covenanters knew very well they could not choose but make, viz. That they
could grant out no process for the compeerance of any persons before them, but
those who were impleaded, and whose causes were triable before them. The truth
is, Our Commissioner found by inquiry, and the Covenanters knew it perfectly
well, that the ordinary way of process or cytation to a General Assembly
was to pass it under the hand of the Clerk of the Assembly, whose office is
during life, if he be not legally removed, and usually too under the hand of
him who was Moderator at the last General Assembly; both which were then
living and are so still: the name of the Clerk of the Assembly being Master
James Sandelands, an Advocate and Commissarie of Aberdene, and the Moderator of
the last Assembly, being the now Archbishop of Saint Andrews: But they who
had all this while gone on in disorderly, illegal, and unjustifiable ways,
belike thought it an incongruitie to keep the beaten path and tract of justice
in any thing, and therefore they fell and resolved upon a way so unlike
Justice, so repugnant to Religion and common honesty, as one would wonder how
they hit upon it, having neither Law nor practice for it, which was this, They
caused to be drawn up a most false, odious, and scandalous Libell against the
Archbishops and Bishops, with a Petition annexed, to the Presbytery of
Edinburgh, wherein they desired the Libell to be admitted by them; the copy
whereof, as it was exhibited by them to the said Presbytery, and afterward
publicly read in all the Pulpits thereof, here follows; which out of Our
love to the Christian Religion We wish might never come to the notice of any
Pagan, and out of Our love to the Religion reformed, We wish might never come
to the notice of any Papist: But it cannot be concealed.

The Bill, or the complaint, of the Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and
Commons, Covenanters, (which were not Commissionaries to the Assembly) against
the pretended Archbishops and Bishops within this kingdom, as it was presented
to the Presbytery of Edinburgh; with an Act of reference of the Bill, from the
Presbytery to the next General Assembly, as it was fully read on the Lords
day before noone in all the Churches within the Presbytery of Edinburgh,
according to the Act.

WE, for our selves, and in name and behalf of the rest of the Noblemen,
Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons within this Realm of
Scotland, subscribers of the Covenant, who are not chosen Commissioners to the
General Assembly, but) who will assist and insist in this complaint with us,
as faithful Christians, as loyal subjects, and sensible members of this
Church and Commonweal, having interest to pursue this popular action, in a
special manner and an eminent degree, by which pursuit God may be glorified,
Christ's Kingdom advanced, that the Church may be restored to her privileges
and liberties, and freed from manifold scandals, from the corrupters of
Doctrine with Popery and Arminianisme, of the Sacraments with Superstition and
Will Worship, and of the Discipline with tyranny, and from the overthrowers of
the peace of this Church and Kingdom by their usurpations and lies, their
violent humors, and falsehood for their own worldly ends, may be tried and
censured accordingly, and so this Church and State made free from the present
divisions and combustions, and restored to peace and unity, both with God and
amongst themselves, and that his Majesty's religious disposition and honor may
be cleared to all the world, by the trial and censure of those men who have
fraudulently abused his Majesty's name and authority by their trust and credit
with his Majesty: We most earnestly make request, That whereas by the Laws
of this Church and Kingdom, and by his Majesty's last Proclamation, all his
Majesty's subjects, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, of whatsoever title or
degree, if they have exercised an unlimited or unwarrantable power, They are
declared and ordained to be liable to the trial and censure of the General
Assembly and Parliament, or to any other Judicatorie, according to the nature
and quality of the offense. And whereas Master David Lyndsey pretended Bishop
of Edinburgh, Master Thomas Sydserfe pretended Bishop of Galloway, Master
Walter Whitefoord pretended Bishop of Brichen, Master James Wedderburne
pretended Bishop of Dumblane, Master James Fairley pretended Bishop of Argyle,
Master John Spotswood pretended Archbishop of Saint Andrews, (having their
residences or dwelling places within the bounds of this Presbytery of
Edinburgh,) Master Patrick Lyndsey pretended Archbishop of Glasgow, Master
Alexander Lyndsey pretended Bishop of Dunkell, Master Adam Bannatine pretended
Bishop of Aberdene, Master John Gutherie pretended Bishop of Murray, Master
John Maxwel pretended Bishop of Rosse, Master George Greme pretended Bishop of
Orkney, Master John Abernethie pretended Bishop of Caithnesse, Master Neil
Campbel pretended Bishop of the Isles, should be tried and censured for their
unlimited and unwarranted power.

For whereas it was provided in the Cautions agreed upon in the General
Assembly holden at Mountrose, Anno 1600. for bounding of the Ministers votes
in Parliament, and concluded to be inserted in the body of the act of
Parliament, for confirmation of this vote as a most necessary and substantial
point of the same, which was never yet repealed by a lawful Assembly, That
the Minister should swear, upon his admission to the office of Commissionarie,
to subscribe and fulfill the Cautions agreed upon under the penalties expressed
therein, otherwise he was not to be admitted; yet the said Master David
Lyndsey sometimes Minister of Brichen now pretended Bishop of this Diocese of
Edinburgh, and pretended Moderator of this Presbytery, with his foresaid
Colleagues, the pretended Bishops and Archbishops of this Church respective,
have taken upon them (without craving or obtaining Commission from the Church
as it is set down in that Assembly at Mountrose) the office and power to vote
in Parliament, without swearing at his or their entrances to subscribe and
fulfill those Cautions which are set down under penalties.

In the first Caution it was provided, that he presume not to propound in
Parliament, in council or convention, any thing in the name of the Church
without an express warrant or direction from the Church, under the pain of
deposition from his office; and that he should neither give consent unto, nor
keep silence from any thing (amidst these meetings) that might be prejudicial
to the liberty of the Church, under the said pain.

But the forenamed Master David Lyndsey pretended Bishop of Edinburgh, with the
rest of his Colleagues respective above named, have presumed (having no warrant
nor direction from the Church) to propound in Parliament, and to consent to
several acts which have past in Parliament, to the prejudice of the Church, as
namely, To the act concerning the Restitution of the State of Bishops, Anno
1606. the act concerning the chapter of Saint Andrews, Anno 1607. To the act
of Commissariots and jurisdictions given to Archbishops and Bishops, Anno 1609.
To the ratification of the act agreed upon in the Assembly of Glasgow Anno
1610. with an explanation, contrary to the meaning and tenor of the said
conclusions, Anno 1612. To the acts concerning the Elections of Archbishops and
Bishops, and to the acts concerning the Restitution of chapiters, Anno 1617. To
the ratification of the five Articles of Perth, Anno 1621. To the act
concerning the apparel of Churchmen, and to the ratification of the acts
concerning Religion, in which all the former Acts are included, Ann. 1633. and
to many other several Acts of this kind. In like manner he propounded and
gave consent to several Acts of the Privy Council, for the establishing of
it, and of the power of the High Commission, which are against the laws and
liberties of this kingdom; and for ratification of several acts and sentences
given out by them and their Colleagues in that unwarrantable Judicatorie: for
in the same manner did he propound and consent unto the Acts made in the Privy
Council for pressing and bringing in of the Service Book, which would have
trod under the frame of Gods public worship in this Kingdom, if the Lord had
not prevented it. And further, in the last convention of the States holden in
the years 1625. and 1629. he did not only keep silence, but propound and
give consent to some things which were prejudicial to the liberties of this
Church, and he did oppose himself to the just desires and grievances which
were presented in name of the Church for some of her liberties and privileges:
whereas it was provided that he shall be bound upon each general Assembly to
give an account of the discharge of his Commission since the Assembly going
before, and shall submit himself to the censure of the Assembly, and stand to
the determinations of it without further Appeal, and shall sue for and obtain
ratification of his carriage from the Assembly, under the pain of infamy and
excommunication; but the said Master David Lindsey, and his Colleagues
respective abovenamed, have never given an account of the discharge of his or
their Commissions, nor sought nor have obtained ratification of his or their
doings from the Assembly.

Whereas it was provided in the third caution, that he should content himself
with that portion of the Benefice which should be assigned to him from his
Majesty for his livelihood, not hurting or prejudging the rest of the
Ministers, or any Minister whatsoever, planted or to be planted within his
Benefice, and that this clause was to be inserted in his provision: besides,
when Bishops were charged in the Assembly holden in October. Ann. 1578. to quit
the corruptions of that State, there was numbered amongst the corruptions, That
they received for the maintaining of their ambition and riot, the emoluments of
the Church, which might sustain many Pastors, the Schools and the Poor; but
the said Master David Lindsey with his Colleagues respective, have took
provision for their Benefices, and the foresaid clause was not inserted, and he
and they have prejudged Ministers, Schools, and the Poor, by taking and
enjoying plurality of Benefices.

Whereas it was provided in the fourth caution that he should not dilapidate
nor make a disposition of his Benefice without the consent of his Majesty and
the general Assembly; and for the greater warrant of this, That he should
interdict himself to the general Assembly not to dilapidate, nor to give
consent to the dilapidation of his Benefice made by others, and that he should
be contented that an Inhibition should be raised upon him to that purpose; but
the said Master David Lindsey, with his Colleagues respective, have set, and
take settled patronages.

Whereas in the fifth caution it is provided that he should be bound to attend
his particular Congregation faithfully in all the points of a Pastor; and that
he shall be subject to the trial and censure of his own Presbytery and
provincial Assembly, as another Minister that bears no Commission: In like
manner by diverse Acts and constitutions of the general Assemblies and
Presbyteries, non residents are punishable by deprivation; Yet the said Master
David Lindsey with his foresaid Colleagues respective, have been non-resident
from his and their charges for many years; nor have they performed the duties
of Pastors by preaching, administration of the Sacraments, visiting the sick,
etc. but they have deserted their charges by the space now of many years;
neither have they in this subjected themselves to the trial of the
Presbyteries and provincial Assemblies.

That whereas in the sixth caution it was provided, That in the administration
of Discipline, collation of benefices, visitation, and all other points of
Ecclesiastical government, he shall neither usurp nor acclaim to himself a
power or jurisdiction further over the rest of his brethren, under the pain of
deprivation: and in case he did usurp upon the Ecclesiastical government, if
the Synodall Presbyteries, or general Assemblies did oppose, or make
impediment unto him; whatsoever he did in that case should be ipso facto null,
without a declaratour; yet the said Master David Lindsey with his Colleagues
respective, have usurped a jurisdiction in the administration of Discipline,
collation of benefices, visitation, and other points of Ecclesiastical
government, without a lawful warrant from the Church, in exercising power to
suspend, deprive, command, and inhibite excommunication at their pleasure, to
fine, confine, imprison, banish Ministers, and other professors without the
warrant of the laws of the Country; appointing their Moderators over
Presbyteries and Synods, prorogating their Diets, staying their proceedings
against Papists, Sorcerers, Adulterers, and other gross offenders, by exacting
of contributions to such Commissioners as he pleased to send to Court for his
own and his Colleagues affairs; by depriving, and ordaining of Ministers, not
only without the consent of the Presbyteries and Synods, but by ordaining of
scandalous and unqualified Ministers, and depriving of learned and religious
Pastors; by ordaining Ministers after a form not allowed of in this Church;
by silencing Ministers for not reading the Service Book, and Book of Canons; by
interdicting after a Popish manner, the exercises of Morning and Evening prayer
in their Churches; by releasing of excommunicated Papists; by contradicting and
crossing the votes of the Presbyteries at their pleasure; by their pretended
negative vote directly contrary to this caution; by enacting decrees of Synods
without demanding their votes; by changing and falsifying their Acts, when most
votes had carried the contrary; by many ways have they failed in this caution,
which are so notorious to the whole Church and to your Wisdoms, that we
shall condescend upon the same when we are required.

Whereas in the seventh caution it was provided, That in Presbyteries, and in
Provincial and general Assemblies, he shall behave himself in all things, as
one of the brethren of the Presbytery, and be subject to their censure; yet
the foresaid Master David Lindsey with his foresaid Colleagues respective, has
not behaved himself as a brother at these meetings; he disdaines to sit in
Presbyteries, or to be subject to their censures; he sits and over-ruleth
in Provincial Assemblies rather as a Lord then a Moderatour; and in stead of
behaving himself as a brother in the general Assembly, has, by threatening
and silencing, prejudged the liberties of the lawful Commissioners; when they
propounded, reasoned, or concluded matters conducing to the liberty of the
Church, he forced them to conclude things contrary.

That whereas it was concluded at Mount Rose, That none of them who should have
vote in Parliament should come Commissioners to the general Assembly, or have
vote in it in time to come, unless they had authority or Commission from their
own Presbyteries for that purpose; yet the said Master David Lindsey with his
foresaid Colleagues respective, though they had no authority by commission
from any Presbyteries, have usurped to give votes in the last pretended
Assemblies.

Whereas in the seventh chapter of the book of Policy, registrated in the
register of the Acts of the Assembly, it was concluded, That in all Assemblies
a Moderatour should be chosen by common consent of the whole brethren assembled
together, and it has been so practiced since the beginning of the
Reformation, till he and his fellows began to break the Cautions; yet the said
Master David Lindsey with his foresaid Colleagues respective, have usurped the
place of moderation in the last pretended Assemblies, and rather domineered
then moderated, to bring in novations; yea further, have directed Mandats from
themselves as from the representative Church of Scotland, which name and power
is only competent to general Assemblies; he has brought in the practice of
many Innovations in the Royal Chapel, in the Abbey Church, and his pretended
Cathedral; he has labored not only to hinder the ordinary meetings of
general Assemblies of this Church, by obtaining letters and charge from
Authority to that purpose, but also has labored, what in him lay, to take
away from the Church the privilege of holding general Assemblies yearly,
belonging to Her by the Word of God, Acts of this Church, and laws of this
kingdom.

Whereas it is provided by another caution, That Crimen ambitus shall be a
sufficient cause of deprivation of him that shall have vote in Parliament; yet
the said Master David Lindsey with is foresaid Colleagues respective, are
guilty of the said crime, in seeking of the said offices, and promising and
giving good deeds for them.

Whereas it was provided by the book of Discipline, and acts of the Assembly
Feb. An. 1569. and December 1565. and 1567. that marriage should not be
solemnized without asking of banes three several Sabbath days before; yet the
said Master David Lindsey and his foresaid Colleagues respective, have given
license to sundry Ministers to solemnize marriage without asking three several
Sabbaths before; upon which have followed diverse inconveniences; a man has
been married to a woman her husband being alive, and they not divorced; some
have been married to persons with whom they have committed adultery before, and
some have been married without the consent or knowledge of their parents.

Whereas by the book of Fasting, authorized by the general Assembly, and
prefixed before the Psalms, no set or yearly Fasts are allowed, but
disallowed, as contrary to the liberty of the Church, and to the nature of the
exercise (a Fast;) yet the said Master David Lindsey and his foresaid
Colleagues respective, have appointed yearly Fasts, and troubled some godly
Professors for not observing the same.

Whereas the office of a Deacon is set forth in the book of Discipline, and
book of common order before the Psalms, according to the Word of God, to have
no meddling with the preaching of the Word, or the ministration of the
Sacraments, and by the first Confession of faith ratified in the Acts of
Parliament, chapter 23. Ministers called unto particular flocks have only power
of the Ministration of the Sacraments; yet the said Master David Lindsey with
his foresaid Colleagues respective, have given a power to certain Divines whom
they make Deacons (men not admitted to the calling of the ministry) to
administer the Sacrament of Baptism, under the names and titles of preaching
Deacons, and they refuse to admit diverse men to the calling of the Ministry
before they be admitted to that Order.

Whereas it is ordained by the book of Policy* and Acts of the Assembly,
that no man should receive ordination to the Ministry without a present
admission to a particular flock; yet the said Master David Lindsey with his
foresaid Colleagues respective, have separated the Act of Ordination from the
act of Admission.

Whereas according to the established order of the Church, and the Acts of the
Assembly, the ordination and admission of Ministers should be public, in the
presence and with the consent of the Congregation; yet the said Master David
Lindsey with his foresaid Colleagues respective, have given ordination to some
men in other places, not in their own Congregation; and violently have thrust
upon them scandalous Ministers.

Whereas Ministers who teach erroneous and corrupt doctrine should be censured
by the book of Discipline, and by the Acts of the Assembly; yet the said
Master David Lindsey and his foresaid Colleagues respective, have taught
erroneous and corrupt doctrine themselves, and by their pretended power have
preferred to the Ministry men who have taught erroneous doctrine against the
Confession of Faith, and Acts of Parliament quoted in our Covenant; and they
cherish and maintain them who teach Arminianisme and Popery, as conditional
Election; Free will; resistibilitie of effectual Grace; The universality of
Christ's death; The merit of it in Heaven and in hell; a final apostacy of the
Saints; The local descent of Christ into hell; That Christ came into the world
clauso Virginis utero; auricular Confession* and Papal absolution; That the
Pope is not Antichrist; That the Church of Rome is a true Church; That
reconciliation with Rome is a thing easy; That the Church of Rome erres not in
fundamentals; and that she differs not in fundamentals from the reformed
Churches; They call in question the imputation of Christ's righteousness, and
they affirm the formal cause of justifying faith, to consist in our inherent
righteousness; They affirm that there is a local and circumscriptive
presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and they change the Sacrament into a
Sacrifice, and the Table into an Altar, the Ministers into Priests. There are
other damnable and heretical points of Doctrine which they maintain; of which
we shall give particular information in our particular accusation of each one
of them respective, with the proofs thereof, when we shall be required.

Whereas by the Acts of the Church, no oaths or subscriptions should be
required from those who enter into the Ministry, but to the Confession of
faith, and to the book of Policy; yet the said Master David Lindsey with his
foresaid Colleagues respective, without a warrant from the Church or
Parliament, do exact diverse oaths and subscriptions from them who enter into
the Ministry; namely, That they should both in public and private prayers
commend the Prelates to Gods merciful protection; That they should be subject
to the orders which were now in the Church, or by the consent of the Church,
that is, by their consent (as they affirm) should be established; as to the
Service Book, and to the Book of Canons. The heaviness of this grievance made
the most part of his Majesty's subjects to complain in these Articles, that
worthy men which have testimonies of their learning from Universities, and are
tried by Presbyteries to be fit for the work of the Ministry, and for their
gifts and lives were much desired by the people; yet these men are kept out
because they could not be persuaded to subscribe and swear unto such unlawful
oaths, which have no warrant from the Acts of the Church, nor the laws of the
Kingdom; and they were Articles and oaths conceived according to their
pleasure* and men of little worth, and ready to swear, were for by-respects
thrust upon the people, and admitted to the most eminent places of the Church,
and of the Schools in Divinity, which breeds continual complaints, and moves
the people to run from their own parish Churches, refusing to receive the
Sacrament from the hands of Ministers set over them against their hearts, which
makes them not to render unto them that honor which is due from the people to
their Pastors; and it is a mighty hinderance to the Gospel, to the souls of
the people, and to the peace of this Church and Kingdom.

Whereas in the Assembly holden at Edinburgh, in March, ann. 1578. it was
declared that it was neither agreeable to the word of God, nor to the practice
of the Primitive Church, that the Administration of the Word and Sacraments,
and the ministration of civil and criminal justice should be confounded, that
one person could supply both the charges, but that a Minister should not be
both a Minister and a Senator in the College of justice. And in the Assembly
holden in October An. 1578. it was reckoned amongst the corruptions of the
State of Bishops, which they were charged to forgo, that they should usurp a
criminal jurisdiction, that they should not claim unto themselves the titles
of Lords, that they should only be called by their own names, or brethren;
yet the said Master David Lindsey, with his foresaid Colleagues respective,
have assumed to themselves the titles and honors of Lords, they did sit as
Senators in the College of justice, as Counselors in the Privy Council, as
Auditors in the Exchequer, and have enjoyed prime Offices of State. The
pretended Bishops have usurped the place and precedencie before all Temporal
Lords, the pretended Archbishops before all the Noble Earls of the land, and
the pretended Primate before the prime Officers of State in the land.

Whereas by the Word of God and Acts of the Assembly, namely, Anno 1576. 1577.
and 1578. no man should be suffered to be a Minister, unless he be tied to a
particular flock and congregation; and not to be tied to a particular flock
it is condemned as a corruption of the state of Bishops which they were charged
to forgo; yet the said Master David Lindsey, with his Colleagues respective
foresaid, are Ministers, and will not be tied to particular flocks.

Whereas the office of a Bishop (as it is now used within this Realm) was
condemned by the book of policy, and by the Act of the Assembly holden at
Dundee, Anno 1580. whereof these are the words; Forasmuch as the office of a
Bishop (as it is now used and commonly taken within this Realm) has no sure
warrant from authority, nor good ground out of the Scriptures, but it is
brought in by the folly and corruptions of the inventions of men, to the great
hurt of the Church, The whole Assembly of this Church with one voice, after
liberty given to all men to reason in the said matter (no man opposing himself
to maintain the said pretended office) do find and declare the said pretended
office, used and termed as is abovesaid, unlawful in it self, as having
neither ground nor warrant within the Word of God; and we do ordain that all
such persons which do, or shall hereafter, enjoy the said office, shall be
charged simply to dismiss, quit, and leave the same, as an office unto which
they were not called by God; and that they shall leave off all preaching,
ministration of the Sacraments, or other offices of Pastors, until such time
as they receive admission de novo from the general Assembly, under the pain
of excommunication to be used against them; and if they be found disobedient to
contradict this Act in the least point, after due admonition, the sentence of
excommunication shall be executed against them. And for the better execution of
the said Act, it is ordained that a Synodall Assembly shall be holden in
every Province (in which usurping Bishops are) 18. August next to come, in
which they shall be cyted and summoned by the Visitors of the said Countries to
compeere before their Synodall Assemblies; as namely, The Archbishop of S.
Andrews to compeere at Saint Andrews, The Bishop of Aberdene in Aberdene, The
Archbishop of Glasgow in Glasgow, the Bishop of Murray in Elgin, to give
obedience to the said act, which if they refused to do, that the Synodall
Assemblies shall appoint certain brethren of their Presbyteries to give them
public admonitions out of their Pulpits, and to warn them, if they disobey,
to compeere before the next General Assembly to be holden at Edinburgh 20.
October. to hear the sentence of excommunication pronounced against them for
their disobedience: and to this act the Bishop of Dumblane that then was,
agreed, submitting himself to be ruled by it: it was also condemned by the act
of Glasgow Anno 1581. which does ratify the former act of Dundee, and ordaines
the book of policy, which was approved by several General Assemblies to be
registrated in the books of the Assembly, and enjoined the general confession
of faith to be subscribed by all his Majesty's Lieges, Yet has the said Master
David Lyndsey with his foresaid Colleagues respective, not only incroached
upon the liberties of Presbyteries and Synods, but has also took Consecration
to the office of a Diocesan Bishop, without the knowledge or consent of the
Church, and against the acts of it, claiming the power of ordination and
jurisdiction, as due to him by that unwarrantable office.

Besides, the said Master David Lyndsey with his foresaid colleagues
respective, have, against the Laws of the Church and Kingdom, brought in the
Service book, the book of Canons, and the High Commission Court, and would have
changed and overthrown the whole frame of doctrine of Gods word, the use of
the Sacraments, the Discipline, Liberties and Privileges of this Church and
State, if the Lord had not prevented them; The particulars we shall present to
your wisdoms, though it be known to all men, how he and they have abused
his Majesty's authority against his Royal intentions and Declarations, they
having moved discontents betwixt the King and his subjects, by scandalous lies
betwixt subject and subject, for which things complaints have been given in to
the Council, which we hold hear to be repeated as a part of our complaint,
and to be tried by your wisdoms, and referred to the Assembly.

Besides all these faults, the said Master David Lyndsey with his Colleagues
respective, in his life and conversation is slandered constantly as guilty of
excessive drinking, whoring, playing at Cards and Dice, swearing, profane
speaking, excessive gaming, profaning of the Sabbath, contempt of the public
ordinances and private familie-exercises, mocking of the power of preaching,
prayer, and spiritual conference, and sincere professors; besides, with
briberie, simonie, selling of Commissariots places, lies, perjuries, dishonest
dealing in civil bargains, abusing of their vassals, and of Adultery, and
incest, with many other offenses, of which we shall give the particulars in our
particular accusations.

Whereas the Presbytery is the ordinary judicatorie of this Church for trying
of these offenses, and has the Ecclesiastical power for cytation of the
parties and offenders, with the reference to their complaints to the General
Assembly, Therefore we most earnestly and humbly beseech your godly
wisdoms, as you tender the glory of God, the peace and liberty of this
Church, the removal of scandals, and punishment of vice, that you will take
into your consideration and trial the foresaid many and heinous offenses, with
the particular reservations and qualifications of them, which we shall present
to your wisdoms, or to the Assembly when it shall be thought convenient; and
that you would either take order with it your selves, and censure the
offenders, according to the nature of the offenses, with the Ecclesiastical
pains contained in the Acts and foresaid Canons of this Church and Kingdom,
or else make a reference of them to the General Assembly to be holden at
Glasgow 21. November. and, that the knowledge of these should come to the
Delinquents, that you will be pleased to ordain the publishing hereof, to be
made by all the Brethren of the Presbytery in their Pulpits upon the Sabbath
before noone, with a public admonition to the offenders to be present at the
Assembly, to answer to this complaint, and to undergo the censure and trial
of it, and to bring with them the books and scroules of subscriptions and oaths
required from those who enter into the Ministry, with the books of the High
Commission Court, and the books of the General Assembly, which they or their
Clerk had or have fraudulently conveied away, Together with this certification,
That if the said Master David Lyndsey, with his foresaid colleagues respective,
do not appear in the said Assembly, and bring with them the said books, to
answer to this complaint in general, and to the particular heads of it, and to
submit himself to the trial and proof of this complaint general, and to the
particular heads of it, that there shall be a condign censure of these
offenders for their contempt and contumacie; Here we humbly beseech your
wisdoms answer.

The Act of the Presbytery of Edinburgh 24. October. 1638. years, in answer to
this Complaint.
UPon the said day, we the Brethren of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, after we
had received this Bill and complaint, presented unto us by the Lord of
Buchanan, The Lord of Dury the younger, The Lord of Carlourie, John Smith
late Bailife of Edinburgh, John Hammiltoun, and Richard Maxwel, in name of the
Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, and Commons, subscribers of the Covenant (which
are not Commissioners to the General Assembly) against the pretended
Archbishops and Bishops of this Kingdom, and after we had read and seriously
considered the same, we, according to the desire of the complainers did and do
refer the same to the next General Assembly to be holden at Glasgow 21.
November. And we ordain the publishing of this complaint, and of our reference
of it to the Assembly, to be fully read by all the Pastors of the Presbytery
upon the next Sabbath before noone out of their Pulpits, with a public warning
and cytation to the offendants complained upon; By name, Master John Spotswood
pretended Archbishop of Saint Andrews, Master Patrick Lyndsey pretended
Archbishop of Glasgow, Master Thomas Sydserfe pretended Bishop of Galloway,
Master David Lyndsey pretended Bishop of Edinburgh, Master Alexander Lyndsey
pretended Bishop of Dunkeld, Master Adam Bannatine pretended Bishop of
Aberdene, Master John Gutherie pretended Bishop of Murray, Master John Maxwel
pretended Bishop of Rosse, Master George Greme pretended Bishop of Orknay,
Master John Abernethie pretended Bishop of Caithnes, Master Walter Whitefoord
pretended Bishop of Brichen, Master James Wedderburne pretended Bishop of
Dunblane, Master James Fayrley pretended Bishop of Argyle, Master Nail Campbel
pretended Bishop of the Isles, to be present at the said Assembly, to answer
to this complaint in general, and to the particular heads of it, to undergo
the trial and censure of it, and to bring with them the books and scroules of
the subscriptions and oaths of them who enter into the Ministry, the books of
the High Commission, and the book of the General Assembly, which they either
had or have fraudulently put away; and if any Pastor within this Presbytery
refuse to publish this cytation, we require the Reader of the Church to do it.
In like manner we require all parties who have interest, either in pursuing,
or specifying, or proving this complaint, to be present at the said Assembly
for that purpose: Upon which the complainers took instruments in the hands of
the Notarie.

According to this complaint, and the warrant of the Presbyteries reference of
it, I A. R. warn and admonish the abovenamed offenders to compeere before the
next General Assembly to be holden at Glasgow 21. November, for the causes
contained in the complaint, and for the certification expressed in it.

NOw though the very reading of this Libell cannot choose but work a
detestation of it in the heart of every religious and just man, yet the Reader
shall do well to take a more special notice of these particular passages of
injustice and impiety in it: the Archbishops and Bishops, of which none at
all, or certainly if any, very few, are inhabitants within the bounds of
their Presbytery: And who before this, did ever hear that any Consistory or
Judicatorie, Ecclesiastical or Civil, could make process against any man, or
take cognizance of the cause of any man, who was not an inhabitant, nor had any
charge or estate within the Precincts or bounds of those places, which only
are liable to the jurisdiction of that Court? then of those who in dutiful
obedience to authority did practice them: But indeed it is to be wondered at,
with what face the Covenanters can blame either the one for commanding, or the
other for practicing them: For what ground have they, or did they ever yet
allege, for their swearing to the Confession of Faith and their Covenant
annexed? Did they ever yet allege any but the authority of Our Royal Father
and his Council, who by their authority commanded them to be sworn
throughout the Realm? And did not We and Our Council by equal authority
command these pretended Innovations? Was not then the Prelates practice of them
as well warranted, as this Confession of Faith and the band annexed, which were
never brought in by acts of Parliament or Assembly, but merely by Our Royal
Fathers Prerogative, and put in execution by the authority of his Council?
whoring, excessive drinking, excessive gaming, swearing, profane talking,
profanation of the Lords day, contempt of Gods public ordinances, neglecting
piety in their families, mocking of the power of preaching, prayer, and
spiritual communication; briberie, simonie, lying, perjuries, unhonest dealing
in civil bargains, adultery, incest, and what not? We do even appeal to
their own consciences, whether they did think all of them, or any one of
them, guilty of all these crimes: Most certainly they did not; and that excuse
which they bring for the justifying of this wicked Libell cannot any ways
extenuate their fault: They say that some particulars contained in the whole
Libell may be proved against every one of them, and therefore it is a good and
a legal Libell, if they can make good any thing contained in it: But be it
legal or not, the world must needs take notice that it is most unconscionable.
The other things mentioned before, and charged upon them in this Libell, are
not crimes at all, being warranted by acts of Parliament, Assembly and
Council; these last rehearsed are crimes indeed, odious in the sight of God
and man, and of which, as if they be guilty, the Bishops deserve death and
exquisite torments; so, if they who have accused them of these crimes, shall
fail in proving them to be guilty, they deserve to be infamous throughout
all generations, for the most malicious and malignant traducers of the servants
of God, that ever lived upon the earth, and must look for the unavoidable
judgments of God to fall upon them and their whole families for this so
horrible a crime, committed wilfully against the knowledge of their own
consciences, unless they do expiate it with the bitter tears of repentance:
For We desire them to declare bona fide, whether they themselves did believe or
conceive all the Bishops accused in the Libell, or only some of them to be
guilty of these last recyted crimes: If not all, but some, why did they not
distinguish them, that the people might know whom they should take for guilty,
and whom for not guilty? Nay, did they not believe and know, that some of
these Bishops were holy and learned men, free from the crimes objected? For
instance, We will only name the Bishop of Edinburgh, seeing in the principal
Presbytery of his Diocese this Libell was presented, admitted, and publicly
read in the Churches within the Precincts of it: did they then, or do they yet
believe or suspect that he was guilty of incest, adultery, excessive whoring,
gaming, drinking, dicing, swearing, etc. ut supra? We do verily believe, that
if they were judicially called, they would absolve him from such foul crimes;
how then they can answer to God, men, or their own consciences, for accusing
that reverend, learned, and holy Prelate of such crimes, for which they
themselves would be his compurgators, We must leave it to themselves to
resolve: Nay, what if they themselves did not believe any one, not the most
hated of all the Prelates to be guilty of these last recyted crimes? Sure, the
presumptions are very pregnant and unanswerable, that they did not believe it:
for at the general Assembly, when the several Bishops causes came to be
heard and discussed upon this Libell, they did not so much as offer to make any
proof of these last rehearsed crimes against them, they examined not so much
as one witness upon them in discussing the processes of many of the Bishops:
And in the printed Acts of their pretended Assembly (as shall appear by those
passages of it in their place) in their particular sentences of deprivation and
excommunication, they not only do not censure them for these crimes, but do
not so much as take notice of them: And it is well known, that these men who
in all their proceedings had made every Bishops moat a beam, were not so
mercifully or compassionately affected toward them, that they would have
spared them, or forborne to make proof of these crimes, if they had seen but
color for it. If they shall say, that though they could not prove these
crimes, yet there was a public scandal of them; There was indeed a scandal
raised amongst them, and that public enough, when it was proclaimed in the
Pulpits; But by whom was it raised? even by the principal Covenanters
themselves, who were resolved to raise a fame when they were sure they could
prove no fact: or if they should allege that they did forbear probation, or
examining of witnesses, out of their respect either to the Bishops calling or
their persons, they will hardly find credit with any one; For who will think
they did it out of the respect of their calling, which they have given out for
Popish and Antichristian? or out of respect of their persons, whom they have
scandalized in so many great and public congregations of the Kingdom,
infinitely exceeding in number those who were present at the Assembly? The
plain truth then was this: They could easily slander them with these crimes in
the Churches, but they were sure they could make no proof of them at the
Assembly. by cyting him publicly in the Church, and afterward serving him
with a copy of the Libell upon his coming home and appearance: and if he do
not appear, by proceeding against him tanquam pro confesso; which form was
observed by them in the processing of all the Ministers, whom at this time they
suspended and transmitted over to the general Assembly, none of their Libells
being publicly read in Churches: But with the Bishops they proceeded
otherways, against all course of Law, made the Libell against them be read
publicly in the Churches, and that after diverse of them, upon the Covenanters
own knowledge, had been served with it by the Officers of that Presbytery; so
that there was no use of any further public citation, personal citation
being already made: Nay, and to do it upon a Sunday, though that morning the
Magistrates of Edinburgh, by Our Commissioners special commandment, required
them to forbear: Nay, yet to publish that infamous Libell in their Churches,
upon a day when the holy Communion was solemnly administered; Nay, and in the
College Church where Rollock is Minister, (because it was late, and after
noone before all the people had received) to have the ordinary thanksgiving
and prayers after the Communion quite omitted, and the afternoon Sermon begun
without any precedent prayer, and all to gain time for the reading of this
lewd Libell, as if it had been of greater consequence then either the
thanksgiving or prayers after the holy Communion, or the reading of those
Lessons and Chapters of sacred Scripture, or using of prayer, which are duties
usually performed before Sermon: Nay, to have this Libell read in the
afternoon, directly against the Act of the Presbytery which appointed it to
be read in the forenoone, and to have it read neither by Minister nor Reader,
as the Act enjoyneth, but by a Layman, and a fiery Advocate: All these put
together, let the Reader judge whether here were not many acts, first of
injustice, then of impiety; As drawing along with them the profanation and
violation of the Lords house, the Lords day, the Lords holy Communion, the
Lords service and worship in both parts of it, Prayer and Preaching.

As this of the Libell was a trick of falsehood, so about this time there was
put upon the people a notable trick of forgerie, which was this: There was a
maid, whose name is Michelson, her father was a Minister; and when he died left
her young, she has been for many years distracted by fits: Upon this young
Maids weakness some were pleased to work, and to report her for one inspired
with a spirit of divination; and finding, that out of her blind zeal she was
wonderfully affected with their Covenant, and that in her raving fits her words
tended all, or for the most part, to the admiration of it, and detestation of
the opposers of it; and perceiving, that she was well skilled in the phrases
of the Scripture, and had a good memory, so that she could remember the
bitter invectives, which both in the Pulpits and elsewhere she had heard made
against the Bishops and the Service-booke, they thought her a very fit
instrument to abuse the people, and cried her up so much, that the multitude
was made believe her words proceeded not from her self, but from God. Thence
was that incredible concourse of all sorts of people, Noblemen, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Women of all ranks and qualities, who watched or stayed by her day
and night, during the time of her pretended fits, and did admire her raptures
and inspirations, as coming from Heaven: She spoke but at certain times, and
many times had intermissions of days and weeks, in all probability, that she
might have time to receive instructions, and to digest them against the next
time of exercising her gifts (as they call them;) which so soon as she was
ready to begin, the news of it was blown all the Town over, and the house so
thronged, that thousands at every time could find no access. The joy which her
auditors conceived for the comfort of such a messenger from Heaven, and such
messages as she delivered from thence, was many times expressed by them in
tears, by none more then by Rollock her special Favorite; who being desired
sometimes by the spectators to pray with her, and speak to her, answered, That
he durst not do it, as being no good manners in him to speak while his Master
was speaking in her. Now, that she was set up by the Covenanters, to persuade
their ends with the people, there be two reasons which may induce the Reader
probably to believe: time of her pretended raptures, did affirm, that they saw
nor could observe nothing supernatural in them; they only found she had a
good memory, especially of that which she had read in the Scripture, or had
heard preached: that she had a very good expression of her self, but yet they
found that both she knew that she was speaking, and what she was speaking
(contrary to that report which went about of her) and that while she was
speaking, if she were interrupted by any questions, she made very pertinent
answers to them, which could not have been, if all that time she had been
transported with any supernatuall rapture.

Let all this rebellious behavior, and these contempts of Our Commissioner and
Council, interveening between Our last gracious Proclamation of the indiction
of the Assembly, and the day of the Assembly near at hand, be laid together,
and what judgment can any man make of them, but that they were devised and
practiced principally for this purpose, That Our Commissioner might prorogue or
discharge the Assembly, from whence by these strange proceedings he could not
have the least hope of any good: and if he should discharge it, they were sure
they should gain some credit with their party, whom they had made believe
that he never intended otherwise, as also, should indict an Assembly
themselves, which they made full account to do; which appears both by the
tenor of the Commissions given to their several Commissioners, both from
Presbyteries and Burrowes, which run thus: We give you full power to appear
for Us at this Assembly now indicted the 21. of November next, wheresoever it
shall happen to be, not naming the place, Glasgow, where We had appointed it,
hoping that it should be prorogued; in which case they intended to hold it at
Edinburgh, the seat of their Tables, As also by diverse of the Covenanters
Letters written to that purpose; the copy of one, written by the Lord of
Balmerino, We here exhibit to you.

Loving Cousin,
I Have lately received advertisment from several friends that are chosen
Commissioners for the Assembly, to help them to lodgings in Glasgow; I send
you h^re a Roll of some of our particular friends, whereof you may give a Copy
to the Provost and Magistrates, that they, (being men of quality) may be
accordingly furnished for themselves and their train, with such rooms (at
least) as you have provided for me. I hope your Magistrates have been as
careful to provide for the Commissioners as for the Councillors, which are
not so necessary members of the Assembly as the Commissioners: And if they be
not well eased, it may be a great argument to the Assembly to remove it self
elsewhere. I am of opinion, that of the three hundred necessary Commissioners
of Assembly, the half of them have not provided themselves, as being far
distant and unacquainted, hoping in so good a town to fnde all commodities for
money. I would send a servant to take possession of those Lodgings which can be
had, for my self and our friends, that we be not surprised with the
Councillors followers, who are to be with you the 15 or 16 of this instant.

George Porterfield undertook to my Lord Lindsey and other Noblemen, at his
last being here, to bespeake three or four of the best Lodgings they designed
for such Noblemen as was given him in list; we have heard nothing of his
performance. My Lord Lindsey has written oft-times to me, and I would entreat
you to desire George to write with the first occasion to John Smith, or any
other he pleases here, that we may know his care and account of his
undertaking. You will pardon me for this trouble I put you to, being for
friends that will be very sensible of it, whereof none are more obliged and
less able to acquit all your favors, then

Edinb. November. 8. 1638. Your loving Cousin to dispose of, Balmerino.
I could wish our own friends were as well bestowed near one another as can
be; and if I cannot come there the next week, I will send a servant.




BY these lines you may easily perceive, both the insolent contempts used by
these men toward Our Council, and the resolution which they had to keep the
Assembly, or to remove it at their pleasures. But after they were once
persuaded, that Our Commissioner was resolved to hold the Assembly at the time
and place appointed by Our Proclamation, the time of it approaching, they sent
out from their Tables a second paper of public instructions throughout all
the parts of the Kingdom, which were these* 12. of November, and stay there
till they go to Glasgow, where they shall all meet on Saturday the 17. of
November at the furthest.

17. day of November, to attend constantly the Assembly, and give their advice
in the common cause to the ruling Elders, Commissioners to the Assembly out of
these Shires and Presbyteries.

17. of November, and there constantly to attend the Assembly, and give their
advice to their Commissioner in this common cause.









IN the first of these, there is a meeting appointed of all the Commissioners,
first at Edinburgh, then at Glasgow, which was (no doubt) to agree upon the
conclusions to be made in the Assembly, before the Assembly should assemble:
In the second and third you see a course taken, That both from Presbyteries and
Burrowes, the several Commissioners shall have numbers of Assistants, without
whose advice the Commissioners were to conclude nothing; a thing never heard of
before at any Assembly of that Church; and by which multitude they meant to
terrify all those, who in Glasgow should offer to oppose or speak against
them. In the fourth, to the high contempt of Our Authority and Proclamation,
they appoint another day for the public Fast then was by Us designed. In the
sixth, they order that all these who had subscribed Our Covenant and
Confession, should be presented as public offenders.

These new instructions, especially that Article which appointed so great
troops to repair to Glasgow, all which (as Our Commissioner was informed)
meant to go thither with Arms, and in hostile equipage, which is most
severely prohibited by the Laws of that Our Kingdom, moved Our Commissioner
and Council, by public Proclamation at the Cross of Edinburgh, severely to
interdict any Commissioner for the Assembly at Glasgow to travel thither, or
to continue there with more attendance then those of their own family and
ordinary retinue; and that they should carry with them no other Arms, but
such as were allowed by the Laws of that Kingdom, under the pains and
penalties contained in the said Laws. This Proclamation they only answered
with a Protestation, yielding no obedience to it; for they traveled to Glasgow
in great troops, carrying with them prohibited and warlike Arms.

It is easy now to be conceived, that Our Commissioner could expect no good
from this Assembly, the preparations whereunto were so full of rebellion and
tumult; and the precedent elections of the members whereof had induced many
legal, unavoidable, and undeniable nullities of it: yet because Our people
should clearly see the realitie of Our royal intentions, and the Covenanters
party might understand how they had been abused by the reports which their
leaders had dispersed, That We meant nothing less then to keep this Assembly;
and principally, that in that Assembly We might fully make good to all Our
subjects, whatsoever We had promised in Our last gracious declaration, (the
heads of the Covenanters having mainly labored with them that point, viz. that
We never meant to perform what therein We had promised) Our Commissioner began
his journie toward Glasgow, and arrived there on the 17. day of November in a
quiet and peaceable manner, none of his train carrying with them any
prohibited arms: There met him at Glasgow all Our Council by Our direction,
according to a Letter which We had written unto them, requiring them to assist
him all the time of his being there, with their best concurrence and counsel:
Our Letter to them here follows.

RIght trusty and right wel-beloved Cousin and Counselor, Right trusty and
right wel-beloved Cousins and Councillors, We greet you well:
As by your Letter We find how well you are satisfied with Our gracious
pleasure, expressed in Our late Proclamation and Declaration; so We do expect
the continuance of your care by your best indevours, to bring all Our good
people to a true sense of Our Royal intentions, and real care of preferring
and advancing the good and peace of that Church and Kingdom, which has
always been and still is one of Our chiefest cares. We give you hearty thanks
for your affection and pains in this service, and do approve of your course
in subscribing of the Confession and band, and order taken by you for
publishing and requiring the like due and thankful acceptance of Our gracious
pleasure by all Our good subjects. And seeing the time of the Assembly does now
approach, We require you to attend diligently upon Our Commissioner, until the
time appointed for the down sitting of the said Assembly, and further, to the
final ending thereof; that from time to time you may be assisting to him with
your best opinions and advices, for preparing and digesting every thing that
may conduce to bring this business, to be treated upon in the Assembly; to the
wished peaceable and happy end. And although We will not doubt but that all Our
good subjects will be careful of every thing that may concern Us, or Our
Sovereign authority; yet because that at such public and general meetings,
it is not to be expected that all men's dispositions will be alike, and of one
temper, We require you, and that in a more particular manner, according to the
trust and confidence We have in your affections to Our service, carefully to
advert, that if any proposition shall be made, which may seem to derogate from
Sovereignty, or that true estate of Monarchical Government already established
within that Kingdom, or which may impede the peaceable conclusion of this
Assembly, that as good subjects and faithful Councillors and servants to Us,
you assist Our Commissioner to withstand the same to the uttermost of your
power: To whom We will you to give absolute trust in every thing which he in
Our name shall deliver or impart to you, or any of you, in public or in
private, And so We bid you farewell.

From Our Honor of Hampton Court the first of October. 1638.

THe City of Glasgow being much filled and thronged with all sorts of people,
on the 21. day of November 1638. the day designed by Our Proclamation, the
General Assembly begun, and was opened; and the proceedings were as follow.

After Sermon in the morning, they assembled in the afternoon: The ancientest
Minister of the Town, who had preached in the morning, desired all present to
begin the Action with the choosing of a Moderatour: Our Commissioner (who sat
upon a State raised in a place eminent above the rest, with his Assessors about
him conveniently seated below) told them that there was something to be done
before the choice of the Moderatour, viz. that his Commission was first to be
read, that it might be known by what authority he sat there; which was done,
and so Our Commission to him was publicly read, as follows.

CAROLUS Dei gratia, Magnae Britanniae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Rex, fideique
Defensor, Omnibus probis hominibus suis ad quos praesentes literae pervenerint,

NOw, this Our Commission was sealed both with Our great Seal of that Kingdom
and Our Privy Seal, because the Archbishop of S. Andrews the late Lord
Chancellor, had lately delivered up unto Us Our Great Seal of that Kingdom,
which being by Us for a time deposited into the custody of Our Commissioner
until We should otherwise dispose of it, it was thought fit, that Our
Commission to him should be attested, not only by Our Great Seal, which he
then had in his custody, but by Our Privy Seal also, which was in the
keeping of the Lord Privy Seal: After the Commission read, Our Commissioner
exhorted them to a peaceable and moderate carriage, touching a little (but with
great discretion) the disorderly proceedings which had been used before their
meeting: At which a Nobleman Lay-Elder presently took fire (an undoubted
presage of their succeeding carriage) and answered sharply, That they had given
his Grace content for all their proceedings; to which Our Commissioner replied,
That he had never yet received any satisfaction from them in any of their
proceedings, and, by way of attestation, called God to witness to it: It had
like to have grown to a hot contestation, but that that night the Assembly was
dismissed. The next day upon their first sitting down, they urged presently the
choice of a Moderatour; but Our Commissioner desired first Our Letter to the
Assembly to be read, which was done, and it was thus: ALthough We be not
ignorant that the best of Our actions have been mistaken by many of Our
subjects in that Our ancient Kingdom, as if We had intended innovation in
Religion or Laws; yet considering nothing to be more incumbent to the duty of
a Christian King, then the advancement of Gods glory, and the true Religion;
forgetting what is past, We have seriously taken to Our Princely consideration
such particulars as may settle and establish the truth of Religion in that Our
ancient Kingdom, and also to satisfy all Our good people of the reality of
Our intentions herein, having indicted a free General Assembly to be kept at
Glasgow the 21. of this instant; We have likewise appointed Our Commissioner
to attend the same, from whom you are to expect Our pleasure in every thing,
and to whom We require you to give that true and due respect and obedience, as
if We were personally present Our selves. And in full assurance of Our consent
to what he shall in Our name promise, We have signed these, and wills the same
for a testimony to posterity to be registered in the Books of the Assembly.

At White Hall the 29. of October. 1638.



THen they called again for the choice of a Moderator, at which time one
Doctor Hammilton presented to Our Commissioner a Declinator and Protestation in
the name of the Bishops against the Assembly, containing the nullities of it,
with a desire that it might be read, and a public Act entered for the
production of it: Upon this there arose a very great heat in the Assembly, they
alleging, that nothing could be done until a Moderator was chosen; and they
did directly refuse to read the said Declinator: upon which both Our
Commissioner entered a Protestation in Our Clerk of Registers hands against the
refusal of it, and took instruments thereupon; and so likewise did Doctor
Hammilton in the name of the Bishops. At last they proceeded to the choice of a
Moderator, to which, before Our Commissioner gave way, he entered (as before)
another Protestation, that their Act of choosing should neither prejudice Our
Prerogative and Authority, nor any Law or Custom of that Church and Kingdom,
nor bar him (when he should see cause) from taking legal exceptions, either
against the person elected, or the illegalitie of his election: And so they
having put diverse other stales upon the List, accordingly as it was resolved
upon before at their Tables in Edinburgh, without one contrary voice except
his own, who could not choose himself, one Master Alexander Henderson, the
prime and most rigid Covenanter in the Kingdom, was chosen Moderator.

The third day Our Commissioner, at their first meeting, required again that
the Bishops Declinator and Protestation might be read, which he conceived they
had promised after the Moderator should be chosen: but they rejected it again,
adding then, that the Assembly must be fully constituted of all it members, and
be once an Assembly, before any thing could be presented to it: To which it
was answered by Our Commissioner, That he required it only to be read, not to
be discussed until the members of the Assembly were constituted by allowing of
their several Commissions, because this Declinator contained reasons why
either all, or at least some elected, should not be admitted Commissioners in
the Assembly, because of the nullities of the elections expressed in the
Declinator; which reasons containing the said nullities, might persuade (as
they hoped) with them, for the rejecting their Commissions, which could not be
done after their approving and allowing of them, and so by virtue of these
Commissions, admitting them for constituted members of the Assembly. The reason
why Our Commissioner did so earnestly urge the reading of that Declinator, was,
because he did foresee the fallacy which they meant to use, viz. The
Declinator cannot be read before the Assembly be constituted; and they fearing
that the Declinator contained reasons against the constitution of it by such
members as were elected, and that after they were once admitted, it was too
late to allege any reasons; for then they were sure to answer, that all
elections were discussed, and the members of the Assembly received, and
therefore nothing then to be heard against either; which indeed afterward was
their very answer: There was nothing left here to Our Commissioner, but entering
a Protestation as formerly, and solemnly calling themselves to witness,
whether with any show of justice the reading of the Bishops Protestation could
be denied before the elections were admitted, the principal aim of it being
to show reasons why they could not be admitted, wondering with what color or
face they (above all men) could do it, who had read and published so many
Protestations both against Our Proclamations and Acts of Our Council; and so,
how they could deny to Our Commissioner a thing required in Our name, and by
Our authority, which they themselves had practiced without any warrantie or
authority at all: But all in vain; for not the least resolution taken at
Edinburgh must suffer any abatement: and therefore rejecting the reading of the
Declinator, they first put by the Clerk of the Assembly his son, who by
reason of his fathers sickness had a lawful deputation from him, and whom (as
it seems) they afterward wrought to a demission, and went on to the election
of a new Clerk, whom without one contrary voice they did choose, viz. one
Master Archibald Johnston an Advocate, the Clerk of their Tables at Edinburgh;
against whose election Our Commissioner likewise protested as formerly. At his
admission he made a short speech, declaring (against his conscience) his
unwillingnesse to accept that charge, but yet affirming, that at this time he
would not be wanting to contribute his part toward the defense of the
prerogative of the Son of God; as if that now had been in any danger.

The fourth day they begun the reading of the several Commissions. Our
Commissioner, as formerly, entered a Protestation to take exception against
their elections, in his own due time; only he was content they should go
on, that he might see their justice in allowing or disallowing the elections,
of which he knew many to be very untoward, and made with violence: Now the
Reader is carefully to observe their partiality in admitting or rejecting
elections: for wheresoever there was a Non-covenanter chosen (of which number
there were not above two or three) or any moderate Covenanter, not designed by
them at Edinburgh, and chosen according to their secret instructions (with
which the Reader shall afterward be made acquainted) them they either quite
rejected, or suspended from voice, until some exceptions made against their
election should be discussed; which they were sure should never be done: as
shall now appear in these particulars.

When the Commission from the Presbytery of Peebles was read, there was
presently read a Protestation and Petition given in by a mean Minister of that
Presbytery, not against the election it self (for there did not appear the
least show of exception against it when the Act of the Presbytery was read)
but against some violence pretended to be used by Our Lord Treasurer, who,
being an inhabitant within the precincts of that Presbytery, was present at
the election: The petition was conceived in very boisterous and uncivil terms:
The Lord Treasurer answered all that was pretended so fully, that not any one
in the Assembly seemed to be unsatisfied; there being not one election
returned which was more punctually made, and that even according to their own
public instructions: yet because the Commissioners elected, though
Covenanters, were not the same who had been designed at Edinburgh, nor such as
another Lord, dwelling in that Presbytery, who was a Lay-Elder and Covenanter,
had a mind to, the approbation of that Commission, and admission of these
Commissioners most shamefully was put off and respited, until that Petition
and Protestation might be examined; and so it was continued from time to time,
though it were often called upon: Our Commissioner told them, That sure there
were none present, who did not admire at these proceedings; and that if the
Petitioner failed in his probation (which afterward he did, and asked pardon
for it) he deserved some exemplarie punishment to be inflicted upon him, who
had dared to traduce so great an Officer of State: In this particular it was
too plain, that the poor Minister was only set on to present this
Protestation for the reasons now declared.

After this, there arose a very hot contestation, concerning the election of
the Lay-Elder for the Presbytery of Brichen: The Earl of Montrose presented
one Commission in which the Lord of Dunn was chosen Lay-Elder by the voice of
one Minister, and a few Lay Elders: There was another Commission presented by
that Presbytery, in which was returned the Lord Carnaegie, lawfully chosen by
the voices of all the rest of the Ministers and Lay Elders; yet because the
Earl of Montrose did oppose the election of the Lord Carnaegie, though his
own brother in law, all the Covenanters in the Assembly sided with the Lord
of Dunn, for whom the Earl of Montrose stood, both of them being rigid
Covenanters, against the other Lord who was a Covenanter likewise, but a more
moderate one. And indeed, it was a wonder to see how openly all rules of
justice without any fear or shame, were laid aside in this particular; for
though they did not approve the election of the Lord of Dunn, who wanted
voices to his election, yet they would not admit of the other, whose election
admitted not the least scruple. In the agitation of this business, there fell
out a memorable passage, of which the Covenanters were very much ashamed,
because it betrayed one of their secret instructions, and it was this: There
was written upon the back of that Commission which was tendered by the Lord
Montrose, a Declaration wherein the lawfulness of that Commission, and the
unlawfulness of the other was offered to be cleared, in which, among other
things, it was objected against the Lord Carnaegie his election that it was
made contrary to the directions of the Tables at Edinburgh; which the Clerk
perceiving, stopped, and would read no further. Our Commissioner hereupon
required the Moderatour to give him a copy or extract of that paper which was
last read, and of the names of those who had subscribed to it, and that
subscribed by the hand of the Clerk of the Assembly. The Moderatour absolutely
refused it: Our Commissioner told him, that he desired it to help him in Our
service, that by it he might be the better informed how to proceed in his
objecting against such Commissions as he meant to challenge: The Moderatour
again refused to do it, alleging, that the challenged Declaration was but
accidentally written on the back of the Commission; Our Commissioner replied,
That could not be written privately or accidentally, which was given in public
to the Assembly, and that by a member of it, of so great place and quality, for
a justification of his proceeding in that election; and withal protested, That
though he were not Our Commissioner, but the meanest subject of the land, he
could not in justice be denied the copy of any thing exhibited in a Court of
justice. But all in vain: for after much cavilling by the Moderatour and other
covenanting Lords, Our Commissioner desiring the Moderator to put it to voices
whether he could be denied a copy of it; even that was refused him likewise,
they being afraid, that the Assembly would not deny so notorious an act of
justice: upon which Our Commissioner (though mildly, yet with some expression
of distaste) did thus deliver himself: Let God Almighty judge if this be a free
Assembly, in which is denied to his Majesty's Commissioner that, which cannot
be denied to the meanest of his subjects; and at last, he took instruments in
the hands of Our Clerk of Register, that he was refused the copy of a
Declarator given in to the Assembly, delivered into the Clerks hands, and
publicly read by him, in which, amongst other things, was contained, that the
election of the Lord Carnaegie, Commissioner from Brichen, was invalid, as
being contrary to the directions of the Tables of the Commissioners at
Edinburgh; which occasioned the Moderator to say, That Our Commissioner needed
no copy of it, he had so faithfully repeated all that was contained in it: Our
Commissioner hereupon, since he could not obtain a copy of it, desired all
present to be witnesses of what the Moderator had spoken, and that he had
acknowledged his faithful repetition of that part of the Declarator whereof he
was refused the copy; and thereupon again took instruments. In this
business Sir Lewis Stuart, one of Our Assessors to Our Commissioner, spoke
some few words; which when the Moderator was about to answer, the Lord of
Montrose forbid him to answer one who had no place to speak there: Afterward
there arose a great contestation between the Earl of Southesk, one of Our
Assessors, and the Moderator, with so much heat on the Moderators side, and
some Lords who sided with him, that Our Commissioner was put to moderate the
Moderator, and quench the heat of the Assembly; for which many of them gave Our
Commissioner thanks, and so all business was continued till Monday.

On Monday, being the 5. day of their sitting, they went on in the rest of the
controverted elections, refusing to hear the Lord Carnaegie his election
discussed, but putting it off to a Committee: Master Andrew Logie Minister of
Red, but a Non-covenanter, being returned a Commissioner from the Presbytery
of Garrioche, was refused to be admitted, though they laid not the least
exception against his election: their pretense was, There was a Petition
presented against him to the Assembly, and no voice must be allowed him, until
he had answered that: A very easy device for putting by any Commissioner whom
they liked not, since it was no hard matter to find one to present a Petition
against any man. Another Minister of the Channery of Rosse, and Archdeacon of
Rosse, one Master William Mackeinzey, Commissioner from the Presbytery of the
Channery, upon certain cavills both of his election and commission, which did
bear, that he should continue there no longer then We or Our Commissioner
should continue the Assembly, because the sole power of calling and dissolving
of Assemblies did belong to Us, for the present was only suspended from his
voice; the reason was plain, he was a Non-covenanter, and had openly averred
in the Assembly, that at their election the Ministers of their Presbytery were
threatened by those who brought Letters from the Tables, if they should return
the election of any, but such as they, who brought the Letters, desired. Two
elections were returned from the Presbytery of Aberdene, One of Covenanters,
made by a few Ministers, but many Lay Elders, at which neither the Moderatour
nor the Clerk of the Presbytery were present; Another of Non-covenanters,
which election was made only by Ministers, and at which the Moderatour and
Clerk were both present; yet that other election, at the return whereof there
wanted the Clerks hand, (without which no Presbyteriall Act can be taken for
a Record) was allowed, and the other rejected, upon the bare relation of one of
the Covenanting Ministers who was returned wrongfully, and the attestation of
the other whom the Moderatour openly in the Assembly called up and desired to
testify whether the relation of his fellow was true: an excellent way of
proof against a public Record, to take the testimony of one who was as
wrongfully returned as the Relator.

The Universitie of Aberdene sent none of their Professors to the Assembly, not
daring to trust themselves upon the way, having been so much threatened with the
loss of their lives for writing against the Covenant: Only they sent one of
their number, no Divine, but a Professor of Humanity, to excuse their absence;
his Commission being read, gave him only power to be there, and did constitute
him their Agent in any thing which should concern their Universitie; requiring
him to continue there, and from time to time to give them advertisement of all
that passed. The Moderatour did justly affirm, That that was no Commission,
the party having no power by it to give any voice in the Assembly, and so there
was no more to be said to it: but immediately something being transmitted by
whispering from ear to ear, until it came to the Moderatours ear, the
Moderatour begun presently to recant, and perusing his letter of credence,
said, he perceived that there was only want of formalitie in the draught,
which they might easily pass over; and so they allowed that for a Commission
which was none, and admitted him to have a voice in the Assembly, though the
Universitie gave him no such power, nor would they have sent any Commissioner
but a Divine. At this sudden change of the Moderatour, made in him by a
whisper, many begun to smile, and to lay wagers that the party admitted was a
Covenanter, which the Moderatour did not expect from that Universitie, and that
this secretly-conveyed intelligence of it had changed him; and indeed afterward
it proved to be so.

And thus the members of their Assembly were constituted, just as they had
designed them; at which they were mightily over-joyed, being now assured, that
they might conclude what they pleased: And although it might in common
reputation have better suited with the principles of wisdom, not to have
taken exceptions against these few elections, which were made contrary to
their directions (for thereby they had gained the opinion of impartialitie* and
had lost nothing of their power, those few voices not being able to carry any
thing against their great number) yet such was their blind obstinacy, that
they scorned that any one should sit there who run not their rebellious
courses, as holding it a dis-reputation to them if they should be thought to
have abated any thing, not only of their power but even of their will.
Besides, not only their peevishness, but even their pride appeared notably in
one particular: We, in Our Letters to the Assembly, had nominated for
Assessors to Our Commissioner these six: The Earl of Traquair Lord Treasurer,
the Earl of Roxburgh Lord Privie-Seale, the Earl of Argyle, the Earl of
Lauderdaile, the Earl of Southesk, Lords of Our Privy Council, and Sir Lewis
Stuart an Advocate, a far fewer number then ever Our royal Father called to
assist any of his Commissioners; all which ever constantly had voices in the
Assembly; But here, though these six suffrages were able to do nothing
against their minds; yet because they would be sure to clip the wings of
Authority, they absolutely refused to let them have any voice at all, telling
Our Commissioner, That he might consult with these Assessors if he pleased, but
that they were to have no voice in the Assembly: affirming, with incredible
impudence, That if We Our Self were there, We should have but one voice, and
that not negative neither, nor more affirmative then any one member of the
Assembly had: by which means they have published to the World this sweet and
wholesome doctrine, That their King in their Ecclesiastical Assembly has no
more power then any Towne-Clerke, Tailor, or Sadler who shall sit as a
Lay-Elder there: which desperate opinion of theirs, does plainly show the
reason why in their last public instructions preceding the Assembly, they
ordered, That every Lay-Elder from Presbyteries should come attended with three
or four, and every Commissioner from Burrowes with five or six of their own
rank and quality, who should continue with them all the time of the Assembly,
without whose advice they should not give voice to any thing; a thing never
heard of at any general Assembly before. Sure they had heard and knew the
number and names of the Assessors, whom We had appointed to assist Our
Commissioner; and therefore they would have every mechanical Artizan, chosen a
Lay-Elder for the Assembly, (whom they held to have equal power with Us in it)
to carry the same badge of power and state with Us, and to have their
Assessors as well as We, and those equal in number to Ours, and the same power
with Ours, of consulting, though not concluding: All which, whether royal
Majesty and supreme Soveraigntie can or ought to digest, any reasonable man
may judge.

The Assembly being just now the same thing which the Tables were at Edinburgh
in substance, but in condition far worse (for here were none now but the most
obstinate Covenanters, whom the several Tables had picked out of all the
pack) and they meeting at the Towne-house of Glasgow always before they met
at the Church (the place of the Assembly) the Moderator being the same
materially who governed them at Edinburgh, though not so formally chosen as
now; the Clerk of the Assembly being the same, who was Clerk to their
Covenant and to their Tables at Edinburgh; the members of the Assembly being
the same who sat at their Tables there, and those the most corrupted and
distempered of them all: who could now expect less insolent conclusions from
this Assembly, then they had found from their Tables?

And indeed the very same were found: For immediately they bragged that now
they were a constituted Assembly, and resolved to laugh at any who should
quarrel with the elections which they had approved; and especially at the
Bishops Declinator, if it should contain any arguments to that purpose. The
first Cock who begun to crow upon this dunghill, though it were within night,
no ordinary time of crowing, was Master Andrew Ramsey a Minister of Edinburgh,
who, getting up upon a stool or form, made a very great brag, offering by
dispute to prove against any man the lawfulness of lay Elders, by Scripture,
Antiquity, Fathers, Councels, the judgment of all the Reformed Churches, even
of the Church of England, who admitted them into the High Commission. Our
Commissioner seeing him crowd so much in a very little room, told him that he
run no great hazard or danger in his challenge; for he was sure the Judges
would be his seconds: yet if it pleased him, he would find one should enter
into the Lists with him, either publicly or privately, upon that quarrel;
but many of his brethren were not very well pleased with his glorious
challenge, as making account that he would never be able to make good the
greatest part of it: And with this brag the Assembly dissolved for that night.

The next day, being the 27. of November, after the Assembly was met, Our
Commissioner urged once again that the Bishops Declinator might be read;
which was accordingly done by the Clerk of the Assembly. It was entertained
with much jeering and laughter, and by transmission of a whisper from one ear
to another, they resolved when it was read out to have received it with a
general hissing; but yet by another general whisper, transmitted as the
former, that course was stopped. After it was ended, Our Commissioner spoke
home to them, for the necessity of that Declinator, and the unavoidable
strength of the reasons contained in the same, and in depressing, by way of
parallel, their Libell against the Bishops: which he spared not to call
infamous and scurrillous, both in the matter of it, and the manner of
promulging it; and hereupon took instruments in Our Clerk of Registers hands,
both for the production and reading of the Declinator. Some of the Lords of the
Assembly offered to do the like in the Clerk of the Assemblies hands, but Our
Commissioner told him it was needless, since it was not tendered to the
Assembly but to himself: First, the Moderatour in a short speech deplored the
obstinacy of the Bishops hearts, who in all that Declinator had bewrayed no
sign of remorse and sorrow for their wicked courses* and then the Lords of the
Assembly perceiving their error, that they who found themselves to be Judges,
had offered to take instruments in the Clerks hands of the production of any
exhibits (which was never heard to be done by the Judge, but only by the
actor or plaintiff) prompted some young Noblemen, and Gentlemen Covenanters
(but not members of the Assembly) then present, to demand instruments of the
production of the Bishops Declinator; in whose name one Gibson, one of the
Clerks of Our Session (and so acquainted with Law terms) both demanded
instruments, and thundered out a verbal Protestation, in such Law terms as
was not easy to be understood by most of the auditors: The sum of what was
understood, was this, That they would pursue their Libell against the Bishops
so long as they had lives and fortunes, etiam in foro contentiosissimo, and
required Doctor Hammilton their Proctor then present, to take notice that they
cyted him to compeere die in diem till sentence were given. Our Commissioner
first protested against that Protestation, and then discharged the Bishops
Proctor from appearance before the Assembly, to which he had presented no
Declinator; but required him to appear before himself, to whom it was
presented, when he should require him: The Declinator of the Bishops here
insueth.

The Declinator and Protestation of the Archbishops and Bishops of the Church
of SCOTLAND, and others their adherents within that Kingdom, against the
pretended General Assembly holden at Glasgow, November. 21. 1638.
WE Archbishops, Bishops and other Under-subscribers for our selves and in
name and behalf of the Church of Scotland: Whereas it has pleased the Kings
Majesty to indict a general Assembly of the Church to be kept at Glasgow,
November. 21. 1638. for composing and settling of the distractions of the same,
First do acknowledge and profess, That a General Assembly lawfully called
and orderly conveened is a most necessary and effectual mean for removing
those evils wherewith the said Church is infested, and for settling that order
which becomes the house of God, And that we wish nothing more then a meeting
of a peaceable and orderly Assembly to that effect. Secondly, we acknowledge
and profess, as becomes good Christians and faithful subjects, that his
Majesty has authority by his prerogative Royal to call Assemblies, as is
acknowledged by the Assembly at Glasgow, 1610. and Parliament 1612. and that
it is not lawful to conveene without his Royal consent and approbation,
except we will put our selves in danger to be called in question for sedition.

Yet nevertheless in sundry respects, we cannot but esteem this meeting at
Glasgow most unlawful and disorderly, and their proceedings void and null in
Law, for the causes and reasons following:



Ja. 6. par. 3. cap. 46. 1572. Every Minister who shall pretend to be a
Minister of Gods Word and Sacraments, is bound to give his assent and
subscription to the Articles of Religion contained in the Acts of our
Sovereign Lords Parliament, and, in presence of the Archbishop Superintendent
or Commissioner of the Province, give his oath, for acknowledging and
recognoscing of our Sovereign Lord and his authority, and bring a
testimonial in writing thereupon, and openly upon some Sunday, in time of
Sermon or public Prayers, in the Kirk where he ought to attend, read both the
testimonial and Confession, and of new make the said oath within a month after
his admission, under the pain that every person that shall not do as is above
appointed, shall ipso facto be deprived, and all his Ecclesiastical
promotions and living shall be then vacant, as if he were then naturally dead,
and that all inferior persons under Prelates be called before the Archbishops,
Bishops, Superintendents and Commissioners of the Dioceses or Province, within
which they dwell, as the Act bears.

All of the Clergy conveened to this Assembly pretend themselves to ipso
facto deprived, and their places void, as if they were naturally dead; and
consequently having no place nor function in the Church, cannot be
Commissioners to this Assembly: hoc maxim attento, that the said persons not
only have never given their oath for acknowledging his Majesty's authority,
nor can show no testimonial thereupon, as they are bound by the said Act; but
also having as subjects comprehended in the representative body of this
Kingdom, Promised to acknowledge, obey, maintain, defend, and advance the
life, honor, safety, dignity, sovereign authority, and prerogative Royal of
his sovereign Majesty, his heirs and successors, and privileges of his
Highness Crown, with their lives, lands, and goods, to the uttermost of their
power, constantly and faithfully to withstand all and whatsoever persons,
powers and estates, who shall presume, prease or intend any wise to impugn,
prejudge, hurt or impair the same, and never to come in the contrary thereof,
directly or indirectly in any time coming; as the Acts of Parliament Jacob. 6.
Parl. 18. Cap. 1. Car. Parl. Cap. 1: do proport.

And moreover, being obliged at their admission to give their oath for
performance of this duty of their allegiance, and to testify and declare on
their conscience, that the King is the lawful supreme Governor, as well in
matters spiritual and Ecclesiastical as temporal, and to assist and defend
all jurisdiction and authority, belonging to his Majesty by the Act of Parl.
1612. yet notwithstanding of the said bands, acts and promises, whereby the
said persons are so strictly bound to the performance of the premises, his
Majesty having ordained by Act of Council at Holy-rood-house Septem. 24.
1638. and proclamations following thereupon, that all his Majesty's lieges of
whatsoever estate, degree or quality, Ecclesiastical or Temporal, should
swear and subscribe the said Confession, together with a general band for
defending his Majesty's person and authority, against all enemies within this
Realm or without, have not only refused to subscribe the said band and
Confession, but have in their Sermons and other speeches, dissuaded, deterred,
impeded and hindered others of the lieges to subscribe the same, and publicly
protested against the subscription thereof: and thereupon cannot conveen nor
concur lawfully to the making up of the body of an Assembly of the Kirk, as
being deprived and denuded of all place and function in the same.

A general Assembly was condescended to, out of his Majesty's gracious James
6. Parl. 15. cap. 31. Prelacies being declared to be one of the three Estates
of this Kingdom, and by the Act of Parl. James 6. Par. 8. cap. 130. all
persons are discharged to impugn the dignity and authority of the three
Estates, or any of them in time coming, under the pain of treason. And
whereas the King by his Proclamation declares Archbishops and Bishops to have
voice in the general Assembly, and calls them to the same for that effect, as
constantly they have been in use in all Assemblies; where they were present, as
appears by many Acts of the general Assembly, ordaining them to keep and
assist at the same, as in the Assembly at Edinburgh, December. 15. 1566. At
Edinburgh, 6. March 1572. At Edinburgh, May 10. 1586. and by a Letter written
by the Assembly, March 6. 1573. to the Regent, earnestly desiring his own or
his Commissioners presence, and the Lords of Council, and the Bishops at the
Assembly* They notwithstanding* by the said Protestation, September. 22 declared
Archbishops and Bishops to have no warrant for their office in this Kirk, to be
authorized with no lawful Commission, and to have no place nor voice in this
Assembly; and withal do arrogate to their meetings a sovereign authority to
determine of all questions and doubts that can arise, contrary to the freedom
of the Assembly, whether in constitution and members, or in the matters to be
treated, or in manner and order of proceeding: which how it does stand with his
Majesty's Supremacy in all causes and over all persons, we leave it to that
judgment whereunto it belongs, and do call God and man to witness, if
these be fit members of an Assembly, intended for the order and peace of the
Church.

Giving, and not granting, that the persons foresaid directed Commissioners

And yet does the nullity of the Commissions, flowing from such godly
concurrence, declaring otherwise their meeting not necessary, and providing
expressly that they should not be equal, but fewer in number then the Pastors,
as by Act of Assembly at Saint Andrews, April 24. 1582. (where Master Andrew
Melvill was Moderatour) does appear. Like as these forty years by gone and
upwards, long before the reestablishing of Bishops, these lay elders have not
been called at all to Presbyteries. And by the Act at Dundie 1597. (whereby it
is pretended that Presbyteries have authority to send these lay Commissioners)
it does no way appear that those lay elders had any hand in choosing of the
Ministers: and this is the only Act of the Assembly, authorizing Presbyteries
to choose Commissioners to the general Assembly: nor have lay elders sat
ordinarily in Presbyteries upon any occasion these forty years, and upwards,
nor ever had any place nor voice in the election of Ministers for the general
Assembly, and consequently those chosen by them to this Assembly have no
lawful power nor authority.

Beside, the persons Ecclesiastical, pretended to be authorized Commissioners

1. For that by their seditious and railing Sermons and Pamphlets, they have
wounded the Kings honor and Sovereign authority, and animated his liedges to
rebellion, averring that all authority Sovereign is Originally in the
collective body, derived from thence to the Prince; and that not only in case
of negligence, it is Suppletive in the collective body, as being communicate
from the Commontie to the King, Cumulative not Privative: but also in case of
maladministration, to return to the collective body; so that Rex excidit jure
suo, and that they may refuse obedience.

2. Next, they are known to be such as have either been schismatically
refractorie and opposite to good order settled in the Church and State; or such
as having promised, subscribed, and sworn obedience to their Ordinary, have
never made conscience of their oath; or such as have sworn and accordingly
practiced, yet contrary to their promise and practice, have resiled, to the
contempt of authority, and disturbance of the Church; or such as are under the
Censures of the Church of Ireland, for their disobedience to order; or under
the Censures of this Church, or conveened, at least deserving to be conveened
before the Ordinaries, or a lawful general Assembly, for diverse
transgressions deserving deprivation: As first, for uttering in their Sermons,
rash and irreverent speeches in Pulpit against his Majesty's Council and their
proceedings, punishable by deprivation, by the Act of Assembly at Edinburgh,
May 22. 1590. Next, for reproving his Majesty's Laws, Statutes, and
Ordinances, contrary to the Act of Assembly at Perth, Maii 1. 1596. Thirdly,
for expressing of men's names in Pulpit; or describing them vively to their
reproach, where there was no notorious fault; against another Act of the same
Assembly. Fourthly, for using applications in their Sermons, not tending to
the edification of their present Auditorie; contrary to another Act of the
same Assembly. Fifthly, for keeping conventions not allowed by his Majesty,
without his knowledge and consent; contrary to another Act of the same
Assembly. Sixthly, for receiving of people of other Ministers flocks to the
Communion; contrary to order, Acts of Assemblies and Councels. Seventhly, for
intruding themselves into other men's Pulpits, without calling or authority.
Eighthly, for usurping the authority to convent their Brethren, and proceed
against them to the Censures of suspension and deprivation. Ninthly, for
pressing the people to subscribe a Covenant, not allowed by authority; and
opposing and withstanding the subscribing of a Covenant offered by his
Majesty, and allowed by the Council: Beside many personal faults and
enormities, whereof many of them are guilty, which in charity we forbear to
express. But hereby it does appear, how unfit these persons are to be members
of a free and lawful Assembly.

Mitte for as superfluos. Nor will a pious Prince be offended with it; but
with Theodosius the younger will say, Illegitimum est, eum qui non sit in
ordine Sanctissimorum Episcoporum Ecclesiasticus immisceri tractatibus -- And
Pulcheria the Empress commanded Strategus, Ut Clerici, Monachi, and Laici
virepellerentur, exceptis paucis illis quos Episcopi secum duxerunt. Upon this
respect was Martinus in that Council of Chalcedon moved to say; Non esse suum,
sed Episcoporum tantum, subscribere.

If these pretended Commissioners, both Lay and Ecclesiastical, were Leo 10.
had precondemned Luther, as appeared by his Bull, dated 8. Junii 1520. renewed
by Paul 3. dated in Aug. 1535. This was the cause why Athanasius would not give
his appearance at some Councels, nor Hosius of Corduba, nor Maximus Patriarch
of Constantinople. But so it is, the most part, if not all of the said
Commissioners directed to this meeting, have precondemned Episcopal
Government, and condemned, at least suspended obedience to the Acts of the
general Assembly and Parliament concerning the five Articles of Perth, have
approven their Covenant as most necessary to be embraced of all in this
Kingdom, and not only have given judgment of these things before hand, but
by most solemn oaths have bound themselves to defend and stand to the same: as
does appear by their Covenant, Petitions, Protestations, Pamphlets, Libels,
and Sermons: and therefore by no Law nor equity can these pretended
Commissioners be admitted to determine in this meeting, concerning these
persons and points, which before hand they have so unjustly condemned.

Further, with no Law nor reason can it subsist, that the same simul and semel,
and ipso facto declared themselves to be party against Bishops; whom they
have not only declined, but persecuted by their calumnies and reproaches
vented by word and writ, in public and in private, by invading their persons,
opposing and oppressing them by strength of an unlawful Combination; for the
subscribing and swearing whereof, they have by their own authority indicted
and kept Fasts, not only in their own Churches, but where worthy men refused
to be accessorie to these disorderly and impious courses, they have (by aid of
the unruly multitude) entered their Churches, usurped upon their charges,
reading and causing to be read that unlawful Covenant; by threatening and
menacing compelling some (otherwise unwilling) out of just fear to set their
hands to it; by processing, suspending, and removing obedient and worthy
Ministers from their places by the usurped authority of their Table and
Presbyteries? And whereas by all Law and Justice, persons finding themselves
wronged in judgment, have never been denied the remedy of declinatorie and
appellation; nevertheless not a few of these Presbyteries have proceeded
against sundry worthy Ministers, who have declined and appealed from their
judgments, without respect to this defense; by these means craftily intending
to disable them to be Commissioners for the Church; directly or indirectly
causing their stipends to be kept back from them: By which means not the
least part of the subscribing Ministers have been gained to their Covenant.

But it is without example uncharitable and illegal, that under the pretext of
summons (the like whereof was never used, nor in the like manner against the
most heinous malefactors in the Kingdom) they have devised, forged, vented,
and published a most infamous and scurrile Libell, full of impudent lies and
malicious calumnies against the Archbishops and Bishops of this Church; and
have first given out from their Table, the order prescribed in these subsequent
Articles, which we have insert, that the world may be witness of the
illegalitie and maliciousness of their proceedings.

I.
TO desire the Presbytery of every Bishop, especially where he keeps his
residence, as also the Presbytery where his Cathedral seat is, to have a
special care of this Bill and complaint against the Prelates, and particularly
against the Bishop of their Diocese.

II.
That some Noblemen (if any be within the Presbytery) some Gentlemen and
Barons, some Ministers, and some Commons, who are not chosen Commissioners to
the Assembly, in their own Name, and in Name of all other Covenanters or
Complainers, either within the Presbytery, or Diocese, or whole Kingdom, who
are not Commissioners to the Assembly, will adhere and assist in this
Complaint, that they present this Bill to the Presbytery.

III.
That they who are Complainers have a particular care to fill up the Blanks
left in the Bill, in the subsumptions of the particular faults committed by the
Bishop of the Diocese, against these general Rules, Canons and Acts: or if
these Blanks will not contain the same, that the Complainers draw up in a
particular claim, all the particular faults and transgressions of the Bishop
of that Diocese, against these Rules, Canons, and Acts, or any other Law of the
Church or Kingdom, and present the same to the Presbytery with this general
complaint. And if they cannot get the particulars presently ready,
notwithstanding they present without any delay, because of the scarceness of
the time, this complaint as it stands with the Blanks: and in the mean time,
may gather any other particulars against the Assembly, to which this complaint
is to be referred.

IIII.
That the Presbytery finding the complaint important, and the general
Assembly so approaching, refer the same to the general Assembly, by an Act
of this reference insert in the Books of the Presbytery.

V.
That upon this reference of the complaint to the Assembly, the Presbytery
admonish the complainers apud acta, to be present at the said Assembly, for
assisting and verifying of the said complaint.

VI.
That the Presbytery ordain all their Pastors, out of Pulpit on a Sabbath day
before noone, to cause read publicly this whole complaint and the Presbyteries
reference to the Assembly, and so to admonish the Bishop of that Diocese, the
delinquent complained upon, with the rest of his colleagues to be present at
the general Assembly, to answer to the particular complaint, both in the
particular and general Heads thereof, given or to be given in; and to abide
the censure and trial of the Assembly thereupon. And likewise, out of Pulpit
to admonish all others who have interest either in the pursuing or referring
this complaint, to be present at the said Assembly.

VII.
That the Presbytery insert in their Presbyterie-Books the whole tenor of
this complaint, both in the general and particular Heads thereof; and that
they have a care to cause deliver by their ordinary Beadle, to the Bishop of
the Diocese, a copy thereof, and a copy of an Act, referring the same to the
Assembly, and summon him to compeare before the Assembly. And if he be within
the country, and cannot be personally apprehended, to affix a full copy
thereof upon each dwelling place, and upon the most patent door of the
Cathedral Church and Episcopal seat.

VIII.
That the complainers within the Presbytery where the Bishop is resident, or
has his Cathedral, be careful to keep correspondence with those in other
Presbyteries within their Diocese, who best can specify and verify their
Bishops usurpation and transgressions, and who had particular Articles to
gather particular Declarations and Informations of the same.

IX.
That some of these complainers in their own name, and with Warrant and power
from the rest, without failing attend the Assembly with the general complaint
and particular verifications and specifications of the same.

X.
That in case the Presbytery where the Bishop has his residence, or where he
has his Cathedral and Episcopal seat, refuse to receive this complaint, or
refer the same to the Assembly, or to admonish or cite the Bishop delinquent
before the Assembly, to answer to the complaint; that the Gentlemen and others
who are complainers to the Presbyteries, upon their refusal take instrument in
the hands of the Clerk of the Presbytery, or any Notarie, and protest that
their refusal of the ordinary care of Justice, procured (without doubt) by
the Bishop of that Diocese delinquent complained of, the equivalent of Law and
Reason, be a formal cytation of him. Which Protestation they may affix upon
the dwelling house of the said Bishop, or upon his Cathedral Church, or the
prime Church within the Presbytery. And that they may deal with any other
Presbytery within the Diocese, who is better disposed, and upon their receipt
of the complaint, will refer the same to the Assembly, and cite the Bishop
in manner above expressed, to compeare before the said Assembly.

XI.
Item, perhaps some Minister within the Presbytery may think some Heads of
this Complaint not to be relevant in his Opinion, or know the Bishop not to be
guilty of all the particular Heads contained therein: yet he in Justice
cannot refuse to refer the trial of the Relevancie and Probation thereof to
the general Assembly; especially seeing the Relevancie and Probation of more
or fewer Points against the Bishop of the Diocese is sufficient, and seeing the
subsumption of every particular Head is against the Bishop of the Diocese, with
his Colleagues.

XII.
Item, To desire the Presbytery, upon Complaints upon any persons within the
same, against any scandalous Minister either in Doctrine or Life, either to
judge the Complaint, or refer the same to the trial and censure of the
general Assembly, and so to admonish and cite the Ministers complained upon,
to compeare before the general Assembly for that end.

According to which Articles, upon Sunday, October. 28. they caused read the said
Libell in all the Churches of Edinburgh notwithstanding my Lord Commissioners
command given to the Provost and Bailies to the contrary, except in
Holy-rood-house, where it was read the next Sunday, as it was in other Churches
of the Kingdom; proceeding herein 1. Against all charity, which does not
behave it self unseemely, nor delights in the discovery of men's nakedness,
nor take up a reproach, nor backbite with the tongue; much less to write a
book against a brother. 2. Against the order prescribed by the Apostle not to
rebuke an Elder, but to entreat him as a Father: and by the Act of Parliament,
Jam. 6. par. 8. discharging all persons to impugn or to procure the diminution
of the authority and power of the three Estates or any of them. 3. Against all
lawful and formal proceeding, especially that prescribed by the Act of
general Assembly at Perth, Martii 1. 1596. whereby it is ordained, that all
summons contain the special cause and crime, which the said Libell does not;
naming only general calumnies, reproaches and aspersions, without instruction
of any particular, but leaving these to be filled up by malicious delation,
after they have defamed their Brethren by publishing this Libell; as appears
by the 8. and 11. Articles of the said instructions: and against the order
prescribed by the Assembly at Saint Andrews, April 24. 1582. whereby it is
enacted, that in process of deprivation of Ministers, there be a libelled
precept upon forty days warning, being within the Realm, and threescore
days, being without the Realm, to be directed by the Kirk and such
Commissioners thereof, as elects and admits the person complained of, summoning
them to compeare and answer upon the complaint. And in case of their absence at
the first summons, the second to be directed upon the like warning, with
certification, if he fail, the Libell shall be admitted to probation, and he
shall be holden pro confesso. Which form not being kept in a summons inferring
the punishment of deprivation, the same cannot be sustained by the order of
that Assembly. 4. Against common equity which admits summons only by the
authority of that Judge before whom the delinquent is to compeare; whereby the
summons directed by the authority of these pretended Presbyteries, cannot
sustain for compearance before the general Assembly, nor could reference be
made from the Presbytery to the general Assembly, the parties never being
summoned to compeare before the Presbytery, whereby either in presence of the
party, or in case of contumacie, the complaint might be referred to the
Assembly. That there was no cytation before the reference, is clear by the
said instructions. And what a strange and odious form it is to insert such a
calumnious Libell in the Presbytery books, without cyting of the parties to
answer thereto: and to cite Bishops before the general Assembly by the said
Libell, by publishing the same at Churches, to which they had no relation and
were many miles distant, We leave it to the judgment of indifferent men. 5.
Against all decency and respect due to men of their place, the said persons
being men of dignity, and some of them of his Majesty's most honorable privy
Council, and known to be of blameless conversation, and to have deserved
well, thus to be reviled and traduced, does redound to the reproach of Church
and State, and of the Gospel whereof they are Preachers. 6. Lastly, to omit
many other informalities against their own consciences, which we charge in
the sight of God, as they must answer before his great and fearful tribunal,
if they suspect and know not perfectly, according to the judgment of charity,
them whom they thus accuse, to be free of these crimes wherewith they charge
them, at least of many of them; as appears evidently by the 11. Article of the
said instructions, having therein libelled the general, and have yet to seek
the specification thereof, from the malice of their neighbors, if so be they
can furnish it. By which informall and malicious proceeding, it is most
apparent, that our said parties do seek our disgrace and overthrow most
maliciously and illegally. And therefore we call heaven and earth to witness,
if this be not a barbarous and violent persecution, that all circumstances
being considered, has few or none to parallel it since the beginning of
Christianity; and if we have not just cause to decline the said pretended
Commissioners as our party.

Moreover, can these men expect, but in a lawful Assemble they were to be
called and censured for their enorme transgressions foresaid? And will any man
think, that they can be judges in their own cause? It is alleged out of
the Canon Law against the Pope, that if the Pope be at variance with any man,
he ought not to be Judge himself, but to choose arbitrators. And this may
militate against them, except they be more unruly then Popes. Ludovicus Bavarus
and all the Estates of Germany with him, did plead this nullitie against the
sentence and proceeding of Pope John 22. and of his Council: And the
Archbishop of Cullen 1546. did plead the nullitie of Paul 3. his Bull of
excommunication, because he protested, that so soon as a lawful Council
should be opened, he would implead the Pope as party, being guilty of many
things censurable by the Council.



This also does infer the nullitie of an Assembly, if the Moderator and
President for matters of doctrine, and discipline, shall be neither the
Primate, Archbishop, nor Bishop, but he who by plurality of Presbyters and
Laymens voices shall be elected: which happily may be one of the inferior
Clergy, or a Lay-person, as sometimes it has fallen out: Whereas canonically,
according to the ancient practice of the Church, the Primate should preside,
according to the constitution of the first Council of Nice Can. 6. of Antioch
Can. 9. and of the Imperial Law Novell. constitut. 123. cap. 10. and according
to our own Law. For what place in Assemblies Archbishops and Bishops had in
other Christian Nations, the same they had (no doubt) in Scotland, and yet
still do retain, except by some municipall Law it has been restrained, which
cannot be shown. For the restraint of their authority by the Act of
Parliament 1592. is restored by the Act of Parliament 1606. and 1609. and all
Acts prejudicial to their jurisdiction abrogated. Neither does that Act 1592.
establishing general Assemblies, debar Bishops from presiding therein; nor
the abrogation of their Commission granted to them by Act of Parliament in
Ecclesiastical causes, imply and infer the abrogation of that authority
which they received not from the Parliament but from Christ, from whom they
received the spiritual oversight of the Clergy under their charge; whereto
belongs the Presidentship in all Assemblies for matters spiritual, always
with due submission to the supreme Governor: which is so intrinsecally
inherent in them, as they are Bishops, that hoc ipso that they are Bishops,
they are Presidents of all Assemblies of the Clergy: as the Chancellor of the
Kingdom has place in Council and Session, not by any Act or Statute, but hoc
ipso that he is Chancellor. By Act of Parliament Bishops are declared to have
their right in Synods and other inferior meetings, but by no Law restrained
nor debarred from the exercise of it in National Assemblies: and the law
allowing Bishops to be Moderators of the Synods, does present a list in
absence of the Metropolitan, to whom of right this place does belong, as said
is, out of which the Moderator of the general Assembly shall be chosen. For,
is it not more agreeable to reason, order, and decency, that out of Moderators
of Synods a Moderator of the general Assembly should be chosen, then of the
inferior Clergy subject to them?

As concerning that Act of the general Assembly 1580. whereby Bishops are
declared to have no warrant out of Scripture; if corruption of time shall be
regarded, the authority of that Assembly might be neglected no less then
that at Glasgow, 1610. But it is ordinary that prior Acts of Assemblies and
Parliaments give place to the posterior: for Posteriora derogant prioribus. And
there past not full six years when a general Assembly at Edinburgh found,
that the name of Bishops has a special charge and function annexed to it by
the word of God; and that it was lawful for the general Assembly to admit a
Bishop to a benefice, presented by the Kings Majesty, with power to admit,
visit, and deprive Ministers, and to be Moderators of the Presbyteries where
they are resident, and subject only to the sentence of the general Assembly.

As for that Act at Mont rose, let them answer to it that have their calling by
that Commission. We profess that we have a lawful calling by the election
of the Clergy, who are of the Chapter of our Cathedrals, and consecration of
Bishops by his Majesty's consent and approbation, according to the laudable
Laws and ancient custom of this Kingdom, and of the Church in ancient times,
and do homage to our Sovereign Lord for our Temporalities, and acknowledge him
solo Deo minorem, next unto God in all causes, and over all persons Spiritual
or Temporal, in his own Dominions supreme Governor. But now we may take up
Cyprian his complaint, Lib. 3. Ep. 14. Quod non periculum metuere debemus de
offensa Domini, quando aliqui de Presbyteris nec Evangelii nec loci sui
memores, sed neque futurum Dei judicium, neque praepositum sibi Episcopum
cogitantes, quod nunquam omnino sub antecessoribus factum est, cum contumelia
and contempta praepositi, totum sibi vendicent? Atque utinam non prostrata
fratrum nostrorum salute sibi omnia vendicarent. Contumelias Episcopatus nostri
dissimulare and far possem, sicut dissimulavi semper and pertuli; sed
dissimulandi nunc locus non est, quando decipiatur fraternitas nostra a
quibusdam vestrum, qui dum sine ratione restituendae salutis plausibiles esse
cupiunt, magis lapsis obsunt.

Lastly, it is most manifest by the premises, how absurd it is, and contrary
to all reason and practice of the Christian Church, that Can. 9. and Council.
Milevit. Can. 22. and Council. Carthag. 2. Can. 10. Nor do we decline the
lawful trial of any competent judicatorie in the Kingdom, especially of a
general Assembly lawfully constitute, or of his Majesty's High Commissioner,
for any thing in life or doctrine can be laid to our charge: only we declare
and affirm, That it is against order, decency, and Scripture, that we should
be judged by Presbyters or by Laics, without authority and Commission from
Sovereign authority.

For the reasons foresaid, and many more, and for discharge of our duty to God,
to his Church, and to our Sacred Sovereign, lest by our silence we betray the
Churches right, his Majesty's authority, and our own consciences, We for our
selves, and in name of the Church of Scotland, are forced to protest, That this
Assembly be reputed and holden null in Law Divine and humane, and that no
Churchman be holden to appear before, assist or approve it; and therefore,
that no letter, petition, subscription, interlocutor, certification,
admonition, or other Act whatsoever proceeding from the said Assembly, or any
member thereof, be any wise prejudicial to the Religion and Confession of
Faith by Act of Parliament established, or to the Church, or any member
thereof, or to the jurisdiction, liberties, privileges, rents, benefices, and
possessions of the same, Acts of general Assembly, of Council and Parliament
in favors thereof, or to the three Estates of the Kingdom, or any of them, or
to us, or any of us, in our persons or estates, authority, jurisdiction,
dignity, rents, benefices, reputation, and good name: but on the contrary
that all such Acts and deeds above mentioned, and every one of them, are, and
shall be reputed and esteemed unjust, illegal and null in themselves, with all
that has followed or may follow thereupon.

And forasmuch as the said Assembly does intend (as we are informed) to call
in question, discuss, and condemn things not only in themselves lawful and
warrantable, but also defined and determined by Acts of general Assembly and
Parliaments, and in practice accordingly, to the disgrace and prejudice of
reformed Religion, authority of the Laws and Liberties of the Church and
Kingdom, weakening his Majesty's authority, disgracing the profession and
practice which he holds in the Communion of the Church where he lives, and
branding of Reformed Churches with the foul aspersions of Idolatry and
superstition; we protest before God and man, That what shall be done in this
kind, may not redound to the disgrace or disadvantage of Reformed Religion,
nor be reputed a deed of the Church of Scotland.

We protest that we embrace and hold, that the Religion presently professed
in the Church of Scotland, according to the Confession thereof, received by the
Estates of this Kingdom, and ratified in Parliament the year 1567. is the
true Religion bringing men to eternal Salvation, and do detest all contrary
error.

We protest, that Episcopal government in the Church is lawful and
necessary: and that the same is not opposed and impugned for any defect or
fault, either in the government or Governors; but by the malice and craft of
the Devil, envying the success of that government in this Church these many
years bypast, most evident in planting of Churches with able and learned
Ministers, recovering of the Church rents, helping of the Ministers stipends,
preventing of these jarres betwixt the King and the Church, which in former
times dangerously infested the same, keeping the people in peace and obedience,
and suppressing of Popery, which, in respect either of the number of their
professors, or boldness of their profession, was never at so low an ebb in
this Kingdom as before these stirs.

We protest that, seeing these who for scruple of conscience did mislike the
Service Book, Canons, and High Commission, which were apprehended or given
forth to be the cause of the troubles of this Church, have now received
satisfaction, and his Majesty is graciously pleased to forget and forgive all
offenses bypast in these stirs, that all the subjects of this Kingdom may
live in peace and Christian love, as becomes faithful subjects and good
Christians, laying aside all hatred, envy, and bitterness; And if any shall
refuse so to do, they may bear the blame, and be thought the cause of the
troubles that may ensue: and the same be not imputed to us, or any of us, who
desire nothing more, then to live in peace and concord with all men under his
Majesty's obedience; and who have committed nothing against the Laws of the
Kingdom and Church, that may give any man just cause of offense; and are so
far from wishing hurt to any man, in his person or estate, notwithstanding
all the indignities and injuries we have suffered, that for quenching this
present combustion, and settling peace in this Church and Country, we could
be content (after clearing of our innocence of all things wherewith we can
be charged) not only to lay down our Bishoprics at his Majesty's feet, to
be disposed of at his Royal pleasure, but also, if so be it pleased God, to
lay down our lives, and become a sacrifice for this atonement.

We protest in the sight of God, to whom one day we must give account, that we
make use of this Declinator and Protestation out of the conscience of our duty
to God and his Church, and not out of fear of any guiltiness, whereof any of
us is conscious to himself, either of wickedness in our lives, or miscarriage
in our callings; being content every one of us, for our own particular (as
we have never shown our selves to be otherwise) to undergo the lawful and
most exact trial of any competent judicatorie within this Kingdom, or of his
Majesty's High Commissioner.

And we most humbly entreat his Grace to intercede with the Kings Majesty,
that he may appoint a free and lawful General Assembly, such as Gods word,
the practice of the Primitive Church, and Laws of the Kingdom do prescribe
and allow, with all convenient speed, to the effect the present distractions of
the Church may be settled. And if there be any thing to be laid to the charge
of any of the Clergy, of whatsoever degree, either in life and manners, or
doctrine, or exercise of his calling and jurisdiction, he may be heard to
answer all accusations, and abide all trial, either for clearing his
innocence, or suffering condign punishment, according to his transgressions:
declining always this Assembly, for the causes above written: Like as by
these presents, we, and every one of us, decline the same, the whole members
thereof, and Commissioners foresaid directed thereto, and every one of them.

We protest, that this our Protestation, in respect of our lawful absence, may
be received in the name of us under-subscribing for our selves, and in the
name of the Church of Scotland that shall adhere to the said Protestation, and
in the name of every one of them, from our welbeloved Dr. Robert Hamiltoun
Minister at Glasford, to whom by these presents we give our full power and
express mandate to present the same in or at the said Assembly, or where else
it shall be necessary to be used, with all submission and obedience due to our
gracious Sovereign and his Majesty's high Commissioner: and upon the
presenting and using thereof, acts and instruments to crave, and all other
things to do that necessarily are required in such cases: firm and stable
holding, or for to hold, what he, or any of them, shall lawfully do in the
premises.

In witness whereof, as we are ready with our blood, so with our hand we
have subscribed these presents, at the Palace of Holy-rood-house, New Castle,
and Glasgow, the 16.17. and 20. days of November. 1638. and sic subscribitur.

AFter these passages, there were read diverse Protestations at Our
Commissioners instance, from several places against the lawfulness of this
Assembly, both in regard of the Lay Elders present in it, and the Ministers
Commissioners in it chosen by Lay Elders: One sent from many Ministers, and
read publicly, does here follow.

The Supplication and humble Remonstrance of the Ministers of the Church of
Scotland, presented to his Majesty's High Commissioner and general Assembly
held at Glasgow in November, 1638.
May it please your Grace,
ANd you right Noble, Right Worshipful, and you most Reverend brethren,
conveened by his Majesty's Proclamation in this venerable national Assembly,
to consult upon the most convenient ways, and to enact such Ecclesiastical
Laws, as to your wisdoms seems most expedient, for preserving of peace and
truth in this Church, for which ends we from the bottom of our hearts (as
feeling members of the same) earnestly entreat him, who has promised to be
with his own to the end of the world, by his spirit and grace, so to direct
and assist your wisdoms, that by this long expected meeting, glory may
redound to his ever glorious Name, and peace to this rent Church, which all the
members thereof, with most earnest wishes, expect at your hands. For the
present, we thought it our duty, as those whom it does most clearly concern
(our great Shepherd having committed to our charge a part of that Flock which
he has redeemed with his precious blood) to present unto you our just fears
which arise from the sudden incroaching of the Laick (now called Ruling)
Elders, in diverse Presbyteries of this Kingdom, having chief hand in choosing
of Commissioners there, lest they, with Commissioners thus elected, may bring
upon the neck of the Ministry and Church here, the heavy yoke of overruling
Elders in all times coming, to the no small hurt of us and our successors in
the Gospel, except timely remedy be provided.

Our humble supplication therefore to your Grace, and Members of this present
Assembly, is, that all these Commissioners thus chosen by the voice of Laick
Elders, and in whose Commissions they have had hand, may be removed, as men to
whose voices and judgments we cannot submit our selves in matter of Church
government, for the just fears above expressed, they being justly suspect Judges
not to be admitted, and their elections and Commissions void for reasons
following: First, there is choosing Commissioners to General Assemblies; the
chusers therefore having no legal power to elect, those that are chosen by
such, can have no place nor voice in this Assembly. Secondly, albeit there have
been a non habente potestatem. For these and other most weighty causes, the
election of such Commissioners, and their place in this Assembly being so
dangerous to the Church, threaten the same with the most intolerable yoke of
bondage to be laid upon the neck of the Presbyteries by Laick
over-ruling-Elders, to the prejudice of the liberties of the said Presbyteries,
and whole Discipline of this Church. We could not, out of conscience to God,
our callings, and flocks, but make humble remonstrance of the same to your
Grace and members of this grave Assembly: withal protesting, both in our own
names, and in name of all the Ministry and body of this Church that will
adhere to this present supplication, that all sentences, conclusions, Canons,
Statutes, and Ordinances, which shall be made in that Assembly wherein the
foresaid Commissioners shall have determinative voices, to be void, null, and
of no effect to oblige us or any of us to the obedience of the same: But if
this our just supplication be not admitted (which we hope and earnestly pray
may be graciously accepted) then this our protestation may be of force against
such Laws and proceedings that may follow thereupon. Thus hoping for your
charitable construction of this our necessary duty in so eminent a danger of
the Church, and humbly entreating these presents may be put upon Record, We
rest.

ANd when the Protestation of the Presbytery of Glasgow (which was a very
strong one) begun to be read, the Principal of the College there desired the
forbearance of it for a time; to which the Moderatour gladly yielded: but Our
Commissioner, who had delivered it in with his own hands, pressed the reading
of it out; which the Moderatour refused, alleging that any man might withdraw
his own Protestation, much more desire the forbearance of reading of it: to
which Our Commissioner replied, That the Protestation was subscribed not only
by the hand of the Principal, but the major part of the Ministers of that
Presbytery, of whom many were Covenanters; that in all their names it was
presented unto him, and therefore could not be re-called by any one of them,
without the consent of the rest, praying him that it might be read out to the
end: but all in vain; for no justice could be had from them, especially in a
point which so much concerned their reputation: for they conceived it would be
a great blurre to their business, if a Protestation (made by that Presbytery,
in which was the seat of the Assembly) should be known: and therefore they
would neither read it, nor did they deliver it back again, against all rules
both of justice and equity: After this contest the Assembly for that night was
dismissed.

Our Commissioner wondering that the Principal of the College should in
public desire the forbearance of publishing the Protestation of the
Presbytery of Glasgow in the Assembly, used means to know the reason of it,
and found by the averment of persons of good credit upon their own knowledge,
that the night before late at ten of the clock, the Lord Lowdan and the
Moderatour, with diverse others Covenanting-Ministers, had been with the
Principal, and told him, that the Presbyteriall Protestation would make a
great division amongst them; that unless he did withdraw it, he must never
look to live quietly in Glasgow, nor any where in Scotland; that the
Principal told them, it was presented to Our Commissioner, from whom it was
not possible to recover it; that then by the same threatenings they adjured him
to desire the forbearance of reading of it, if it should be tendered to the
Assembly; that after they were parted from him, his wife all in tears begged
the like of him, affirming, that the Lord Lindsey had been with her, and sworn
to her, that both he and his must be utterly ruined, if she could not prevail
with him for re-calling that Protestation. This and many other passages
heretofore mentioned, banishing quite out of Our Commissioners mind, and the
minds of all Our well affected Councillors there present, all hopes, not only
of just and fair, but even of formal proceedings in that Assembly, where not
so much as the show and countenance of justice was to be discerned, nor any
thing but the power and obstinate wilfulness of the Covenanters, and the
unanswerable nullities of this Assembly, in regard both of the members elected,
and the manner of their election, being thoroughly considered, and the reasons
of the Bishops Declinator presented to Our Commissioner being seriously
weighed, by which they did not decline the judgment of a general Assembly
lawfully constituted, but only of this Assembly, which was to be accounted
far rather a Laicall convention, then Ecclesiastical, all the members whereof
had barred themselves from being Judges by their solemn oath of combination for
the rooting out of that Kingdom both the Bishops persons and callings; to
whose sentence We or Our Commissioner could not deliver them over without
betraying all courses of justice, and denying to Our Bishops that protection
which cannot be denied by Us to any of Our subjects, viz. the benefit of the
Laws of that Our Church and Kingdom: And besides, Our Commissioner having
certain and unquestionable intelligence of the Covenanters unmovable
resolution, that although the Assembly should be continued, and all things
which they desired (even to their own wishes) should be granted and effected,
yet that the quietness and peace of that Kingdom should be never a whit the
more settled or established, but that they were determined to choose at this
assembly certain Committees, who, under the name of Commissioners from the
general Assembly, should keep up their Tables, and be chosen and continued
from one Assembly to another, and so hold on the same rebellious courses which
they have held ever since the first erection of their Tables, to the utter
overthrow of Our royal Authority, and the authority of the Lords of Our
Council, and Lords of Our Session under Us: and Our Commissioner well weighing
Our instructions, according to which he was to carry himself in this
Assembly, if he should find that these mischiefs and courses of injustice
could not be stopped, resolved the next day (according to Our special
commandment) in Our name, and by Our authority to dissolve that Assembly,
whose aim was only to rob Us of Our Sovereign power, and to put it in the
hands of their Commissioners.

According to which resolution Our Commissioner the next day, being Wednesday
the 28. of November, went betimes in the morning to the Church, and Our
Council (having warning over night) met him in the Chapter House, where they
sat in consultation before they went to the Assembly: He did then impart to
them the resolution he had to dissolve the Assembly, and did ask their advice
for the manner of doing it: after hearing each of their advice severally, he
was confirmed in his resolution. The reason why Our Commissioner held the
Council in that place, was, because some of Our Council, who were present,
should have no time to communicate his resolution to the Covenanters, nor to
consult with them about the hindering it; the Assembly being fully set before
the Council came out, so that what had passed there, could not be communicated
to them.

The first thing propounded there by the Moderatour that day, was this: A day
or two before, there were brought into the Assembly three or four great
volumes by their new Clerk, which he alleged were the Acts of the general
Assembly from the very first reformation of that Church, which, by the special
providence of God, and his own careful industry, had been recovered, else they
had been lost for ever, to the invaluable loss of the purity of the Religion
and Discipline established amongst them; for they had been thrown by for many
years, until he by some strange accident had light upon them: after which
speech of the Clerk, the Moderatour had desired them to choose a Committee to
peruse these Books, and to report to the Assembly whether they conceived them
to be the true and authentical Acts of the general Assemblies of the Church
of Scotland: The day before this, these Committees had made their report that
they had perused them, and had found them to be true and authentical Records,
and delivered in writing some reasons of this their opinion; which made the
impartial auditors wonder how in two days men could peruse, and make a
judgment of such volumes, which other men (who took themselves to be no
fools) thought could hardly be done in one year: but that was all one, the
Moderatour this day put it to the question and voices, Whether they would allow
the copies of those Books of Assembly (which the Committees the day before had
reported to be good and faithful copies) to be reputed ever hereafter for
the authentical Records and Registers of the Church of Scotland: Our
Commissioner prayed them to forbear doing any thing suddenly in a business of
so great importance, that nothing, especially if it were doubtful, could be
made a public Record of any Judicatorie which was to oblige Our subjects,
unless We first by Our Advocate and learned Council were satisfied of the
authentical authority of that Record; and therefore wished them to stay
until that course might be taken, and before that time not to put it to
voices: But all in vain, for presently they of the Assembly (without one
contrary voice) concluded these Books to be authentical Registers, and so to
be held and reputed for ever, without knowing what was in them: They were
four Books, and very large, and confessed not to be the Originals, but
copies. Our Commissioner then remembering that at Our Palace at Holy-rood-house
he was denied the sight of the Books of the Assembly (the Covenanters having
threatened the former Clerk of the Assembly, if he should let Our Commissioner
have the perusal of them) begun now to think, that there might be stuff
enough in them against Our Regal authority, and perhaps a great deal of it
of their own devising; which caused Our Commissioner to enter into Our Clerk
of Registers hands a solemn Protestation against the validity of these
Records, and against any of Our subjects being obliged by them, until such
time as they should be perused and allowed by such as We should authorize by
Commission for that purpose.

Next, the Moderatour desired the Clerk to read certain answers, which upon
the sudden had been drawn up (as he said) by certain Brethren to the reasons
contained in the Bishops Declinator which had been read the day before: And
indeed, so soon as they were heard, it was easily believed that they were
drawn up upon a sudden, without either fear or wit, being very poor and
silly, stuffed full of cytations out of their own books of Discipline, which
did allow Lay Elders; and by these testimonies concluded the exception of the
Bishops against Lay Elders, and Ministers, Commissioners chosen by them for
having voice in the Assembly, to be invalid; which made some admire by what
consequence it could be inferred, that because there had been Lay Elders in
particular Church-Sessions, nay and perhaps in Presbyteries, that therefore
these Lay Elders either had, or must now have voices in the general Assembly,
or in choosing the Ministers Commissioners to it: Yet the Moderatour caused
another paper to be read in defense of Lay Elders, of the very same tedious
stuff with the former: And, to magnify those Books of Discipline, so often
cyted in both these papers, the Moderatour desired the whole Assembly to hear
himself read a long Latin testimony, given in the Syntagma of the
confessions of the Reformed Churches, to the purity of the discipline of the
Church of Scotland. Our Commissioner called for the Book, and desired to see
what he had read, and found it to be a private testimony of one unknown,
inserted by the Printer or setter out of that Syntagma, to make it sell the
better, because it had some new thing in it; which made a good many laugh at
that so much magnified testimony. Then the Moderator, to take away that
exception in the Bishops Declinator, that the Assembly was a declared party
(and therefore could not be their Judge) alleged, that the Remonstrants had
made the same objection against the Synod of Dort, but that it was repelled by
all the Divines there present, and the invaliditie of that exception declared
by none better then by the Divines of great Britain, whose judgment against
that exception he then out of the public Acts of that Synod did read: Our
Commissioner told the Moderatour, that he should have done well to have
translated into Scottish that passage which he last read, and the former out of
the Syntagma, that so many of the Lay Elders, who were to judge of the fitness
of these cytations, might understand him and them; which the Moderatour passed
over with a smile. ONE who stood by Our Commissioner, and had been present at
the Synod of Dort, asked leave first of Our Commissioner, and then of the
Moderatour to speak, which being granted him by both, he answered the
Moderatours answer to the Bishops objection, thus: That the Bishops exception
against them of the Assembly, as pars adversa, differed from that of the
Remonstrants against the Synod of Dort two ways: First, in regard of the
matter of it: For the Synod consisting of Divines, and the matters controverted
being points of Divinity (and by some men thought to be fundamental points
of faith, though they were not so) in which Scholars use not to be neutrall,
it was impossible for the Remonstrants to find Divines to be their Judges, if
they would except against such Divines as had declared themselves to be of the
one opinion or the other: But it was not so with Episcopacie in the judgment
of the members of this Assembly; for they could not hold the allowing or
rejecting of Episcopacie to be a point of doctrine, because points of doctrine
are not alterable; but the Church of Scotland in her positive confession,
Article 21. did hold Church policy or government alterable at the will of the
Church; which opinion, whether he did allow or not, he was not then and there
to declare: but sure in such points, which they themselves held alterable and
indifferent at the will of the Church, being no points of doctrine, there was
no necessity of pre-declaring their judgment, especially after they meant to
be Judges: Nay, there was a necessity of not pre-declaring their judgment
against Episcopal government, considering it stood now in force by Acts both
of Church and Parliament; and therefore that the declaration of their judgment
against it, (even since they intended to be Judges of it, but before they were
actually so) did bar them from being Judges of it at all. But secondly, and
that upon which he principally insisted, was this: That the Bishops case in
their exception against this Assembly, differed from that of the Remonstrants
against the other Synod, in the manner of the members of that Synods
pre-declaration, and of the members of this Assemblies pre-declaration. Many of
the members of that Synod had pre-declared themselves by discoursing, writing,
preaching, etc. but not by any judicial Act, nor by any Act equivalent to a
judicial Act, such as swearing against the other tenet, binding themselves by
Oaths, Covenants, Combinations, Confederacies, Associations against the
abetters of it; all which being Acts analogicall to judicial Acts, and being
done by the members of this Assembly against the Bishops, absolutely barred
them from being Judges in the question of these Bishops persons or calling.
Some answer was made to this by the Moderatour and others, which required no
reply; and therefore received none, that which was answered being no way
against that which had been delivered: For the Moderatour conceiving that he
who spoke had affirmed that the five Articles treated of at the Synod of Dort,
had been fundamental points of faith (of which opinion the speaker never was,
nor is) fell upon a discourse of fundamental and not fundamental points of
faith; affirming that the Synod of Dort had never determined the five Articles
to be fundamental points of faith, which the former speaker knew very well to
be true: And it made many auditors think, that the Moderatour did deliver
this only because he would have something to say; for they did conceive that
he had been a man so rigid in these tenets, that he had held them to be
fundamental points of faith: But whether he did or not, there were many
Ministers members of the Assembly, who did hold them to be fundamental
points, and most unchristianly and uncharitably had preached, that the
Remonstrants tenets did destroy the very foundation of faith; and whosoever
sided with them in the five Articles, could not possibly be saved. But now the
other exception laid by him that spoke, and in which he conceived the strength
of his speech principally to lie, viz. That by their swearing, and combining by
a Covenant against the Bishops (which was a plain pre-judging of them) they had
barred themselves from being their Judges; the Moderatour was pleased to make
no answer at all, though of all that was spoken it most principally required
one. Another Minister, one of the gravest and learnedest in the Assembly, did
conceive that he which spoke had affirmed, that Councels and Synods were only
Judges of points of faith and doctrine, but not of government or other matters;
and instanced in Novatus and Donatus, who by Councels and Synods had been
censured in points of schism; which no man ever denied, nor ever came within
the compass of the thoughts or words of him that spoke. Here a Lay-Elder, who
was a Lord, conceived that he who spoke had said something insinuating that
Lay Elders had given voices in some Councels; Thereupon the person that spoke,
unwilling to let that pass, asked leave to tell his Lordship that he was
mistaken, and that if Our Commissioner and the Assembly would give him leave,
he would maintain it against any man in the Assembly, that neither the name
nor thing of a Lay-Elder, was ever known to any general or Provincial
Council; nay, not to any particular Church in the whole Christian world,
before Calvin's days. To this no reply was made, save only by the Moderatour,
who first said that it would be thought a strange thing in England, if any of
this Assembly should stand up in the Convocation house, and speak against
their Church government: to which was answered by him that spoke, That he
neither did speak, nor would have spoken there, without leave asked and
obtained; nor would he have asked leave if it had not been to have cleared a
passage of the Synod of Dort urged by the Moderatour, and in which he himself
was interessed. And it seems here the Moderatour was brought very low, by
telling the party that his father while he lived was of another opinion: to
which the other answered, That that was a weak reason; for there were some
members of the Assembly then sitting, whose Fathers had been Papists: And he
who spoke did very much wonder that the Moderatour should think it strange
for him to differ from his Father in his judgment of these points of
Ecclesiastical government; for he did not apprehend it so great a matter for
any man to differ from his Father in judgment, as to differ from himself: and
he was sure that the Moderatour knew well enough that many members of the
Assembly, who were now fiercest against Episcopal government, within these few
years had been as earnest maintainers of it as any, and more ambitious and
earnest suitors for Bishoprics then any other. The Moderatour at last cut off
all further contestation about these Lay Elders, by affirming that the state of
the question as it stood before them, was not whether Lay Elders had ever been
received in other Churches, but whether their office and place in the Assembly
was agreeable with the constitutions of the Church of Scotland; and so no more
was spoke of it.

The Moderatour from that speech which was made for justifying the Bishops
exception against the competencie of their Judges, viz. the Assembly, because
the members of it had declared themselves parties, took occasion to speak thus
to the Assembly: Since we see both the competencie and constitution of this
Judicatorie and Assembly is thus openly impugned, it is high time to clear
this point, of which none can be Judge but the Assembly it self, and
therefore I will presently put it to voices, Whether this Assembly be the
lawful and competent Judge of the Libell against the Bishops, notwithstanding
the reasons contained in their Declinator.

This gave our Commissioner the occasion (which he neglected not) to do and
declare that which by Our special commandment he had resolved on; for he
presently made a speech of a competent length, the sum whereof was this: I
should perhaps have continued a little longer with you, if you had not fallen
upon a point which does enforce my deserting you: You are now about to settle
the lawfulness of this Judicatorie, and the competencie of it against the
Bishops, whom you have cyted hither; neither of which I can allow, if I shall
discharge either my duty toward God, or loyalty toward my gracious and just
Master. This is a day to me both of gladness and sadness; Gladness in that I
have both seen this Assembly meet, which his Majesty's subjects have been
made believe was never intented by Him, and in that I shall now in his
Majesty's name make good unto you all his most gracious offers in his last
Royal Proclamation, which likewise his Majesty's subjects were made believe
would never be performed by Him: Of Sadness, in that you who have called so
much for a free General Assembly, having one most free, in his Majesty's
intentions, granted you, have so handled and marred the Master, that there is
not the least shadow of freedom to be discerned in this your meeting: for the
former, which is the discharge and performance of your Sovereigns gracious
promises, let this paper, which I deliver to the Clerk to be read, witness it
to you all, which I am sure you cannot choose but receive with all thankfulness
and dutiful acknowledgement of his Majesty's piety, goodness, and clemency,
unless all Religion and goodness be quite banished out of this Land: Here the
Clerk publicly read the paper, which follows.

THe Kings Majesty being informed, that many of his good subjects have
apprehended, that by the introducing of the Service Book and Book of Canons,
the in-bringing of Popery and Superstition has been intended, has been
graciously pleased to discharge, like as by these he does discharge the Service
Book and Book of Canons, and the practice of them or either of them: And
annulleth and rescindeth all Acts of Council, Proclamations, and all other
Acts and Deeds whatsoever, that have been made and published for establishing
them, or either of them; And declares the same to be null, and to have no
force nor effect in time coming.

The Kings Majesty, as he conceived, for the ease and benefit of his subjects,
established the high Commission, that thereby justice might be ministered, and
the faults and errors of such persons as are made liable thereto, taken order
with and punished, with the more conveniencie and less trouble to the people:
But finding his gracious intentions therein to be mistaken, has been pleased
to discharge, like as by these presents he does discharge the same, and all
acts and deeds whatsoever made for establishing thereof. And the Kings Majesty
being informed, that the urging of the five Articles of Perthes Assembly has
bred distraction in the Church and State, has been graciously pleased to take
the same to his Royal consideration, and for the quiet and peace of this
Country, has not only dispensed with the practice of the said Articles, but
also discharged all and whomsoever persons from urging the practice thereof,
upon either Laicke or Ecclesiastical person whatsoever: And has freed all his
subjects from all censure and pains, whether Ecclesiastical or Secular, for
not urging, practicing, or obeying them, or any of them, notwithstanding of any
thing contained in the Acts of Parliament, or general Assembly to the
contrary. And his Majesty is further contented, that the Assembly take the
same so far into their consideration, as to represent it to the next
Parliament, there to be ratified as the Estates shall find fitting.

And because it has been pretended, that oaths have been administered
different from that which is conceived in the Acts of Parliament, his Majesty
is pleased to declare by Me, that no other oath shall be required of any
Minister at his entry, then that which is set down in the Act of Parliament.

And that it may appear how careful his Majesty is, that no corruption or
innovation shall creep into this Church, neither yet any scandal, vice, or
fault of any person whatsoever (censurable or punishable by the Assembly) go
unpunished, his Majesty is content to declare by Me, and assure all his good
people, that general Assemblies shall be kept so often as the affairs of this
Church shall require.

And that none of Our good subjects may have cause of grievances against the
proceedings of the Prelates, his Majesty is content, that all and every one of
the present Bishops and their Successors, shall be answerable, and accordingly
from time to time censurable according to their merits by the general Assembly.

And to give all his Majesty's good people full assurance, that he never
intended to admit any alteration or change in the true Religion professed
within this Kingdom, and that they may be truly and fully satisfied of the
reality of his intentions, and integrity of the same, his Majesty has been
pleased to require and command all his good subjects to subscribe the
confession of faith and band for maintenance thereof, and of his Majesty's
person and authority formerly signed by Our dear Father in anno 1580. and now
likewise requires all those of this present Assembly to subscribe the same.
And it is his Majesty's will, that this be inserted and registered in the Books
of Assembly, as a testimony to posterity, not only of the sincerity of his
intentions to the said true Religion, but also of his resolution to maintain
and defend the same, and his subjects in the profession thereof. Subscribitur

HAMILTOUN.

AFter the reading whereof, Our Commissioner went on, and added: I have, you
see, subscribed that paper with mine own hand, and to make his Majesty's
Religion, Grace, Goodness, and the Zeal which he has to settle the peace of
this Church and Kingdom known to all succeeding generations, I do require
that it be entered into your ordinary Books of Assembly; but with this
provision, That this my assent to the Act of registring this his Majesty's
Declaration, shall be no approbation of the lawfulness of this Assembly, or of
any other Act made, or to be made in it; but that all Protestations, made or to
be made against this Assembly in all other acts and proceedings thereof, shall
stand in full force and effect: And of the delivery of this paper, containing
his Majesty's gracious offers, into the hands of the Clerk of the Assembly,
and of my requiring it to be registered in the Books of the same, as also of my
Protestation against the lawfulness of this Assembly in all other Acts, I take
public instruments in the hands of the Clerk of Our Sovereign Lord his
Register, and require him to make an act thereof. Which being done, the
Moderatour in a short speech acknowledged Our special goodness in granting
the particulars contained in the paper, promising it should be registered in the
books of assembly, and desired to go on with the business of the assembly.

But Our Commissioner told them, he must go on with them no more; for now the
sad part was behind, viz. That since they had brought Lay Elders to give voices
in this assembly, a thing not practiced before, or at least dis-used so long,
that no man present had seen it; the Ministers sitting here as Commissioners
were chosen by Lay Elders, a thing never heard of before in this Church, all
the persons having voices here, were before the elections designed by the
Tables at Edinburgh, all others by their express directions barred, these few
Commissioners sent hither, but not chosen according to their designation, were
by their cavills, made for that purpose, set aside, and not admitted to have
voices, the Bishops cyted hither were to be judged by the very same persons
who had pre-judged and condemned them at their Tables; he attested heaven and
earth, whether this could be imagined to be any way a free Assembly, and
therefore called God to witness, that they themselves were the cause, and the
only cause why this Assembly could not have that happy issue which We heartily
wished, and why the Bishops could receive no censure from them, in regard of
these their sinister proceedings: for how could any man expect justice from
them, who had denied it to Us, in refusing voices to Our Commissioners
assessors, which was never denied to Our Royal Father, when he called far
more assessors then We did now? Much more to this purpose was delivered by Our
Commissioner; upon all which he commanded and required them not to proceed any
further in this Assembly, and declared that whatsoever they should say or do
hereafter in it, he in Our name protested against it, and that it should never
oblige any of Our subjects, nor be reputed for an Act of general Assembly.

The Moderatour with a speech well penned, which he had in readiness
whenever the Assembly should be dissolved, seemed much to deplore Our
Commissioners resolution for breaking up the Assembly; he attributed very much
to Our power in Ecclesiastical causes and assemblies, said many things of Our
power, quite contrary to much which they have since printed in their seditious
Pamphlets and Protestations, and much more then was liked and approved by many
of his fellow-Covenanters: toward the end of his speech he affirmed, That We
were Universal Bishop over all Our Kingdoms, etc. which made Our Commissioner
use means to have the copy of his speech, but it could not be obtained while
it was fresh in the auditors memories: Many days after Our Commissioner was
gone from Glasgow, a copy of it was sent him, but all that which concerned Our
Ecclesiastical power, especially of Our being Universal Bishop in Our
Kingdoms, was quite left out; by which it was plain, that (as it was before
conjectured) he had displeased many of the Assembly, by giving more
Ecclesiastical power to Us in that speech, then they intended We should ever
have. The conclusion of his speech was, That as Our Commissioner had served his
Master carefully and faithfully, in preserving his Privileges and
Prerogatives, so they must needs likewise be faithful and careful in
preserving the Privileges and Prerogatives of the kingdom of the Son of
God, which was his Church; That they should much grieve for his absence, whose
presence had been so acceptable and comfortable to them, and who had carried
himself among them with so much wisdom and moderation; that they should have
a great miss of him, with many more words, tending to the very high
commendation of Our Commissioner.

After the Moderatour, diverse of the Lords spoke much, to vindicate the
Covenanters from their prelimitations and sinister dealings in their elections:
But Our Commissioner presently choked their confidence, with the production of
two papers, which they little supposed he had ever seen: They contained their
secret instructions, with which the whole Tables were not acquainted, for they
must then of necessity some way or other have come to the knowledge of all the
covenanters, very many of whom by these secret orders were barred from being
chosen commissioners to the assembly, as well as the Non-covenanters; and
therefore they fearing to lose or displease such a considerable number of their
own party, did by these private advertisements (contrived only by the chief
Rulers of the Table, but never presented to the Tables themselves) take order
that none who could fall within the suspicion of moderation, should be chosen
commissioner for the assembly.

The one of these papers was directed to one Lay Elder of every Presbytery,
some special confident of theirs, containing these nine Articles ensuing.

BEcause all projects and purposes will fail, if they be not pursued with
constant diligence to the end, the Devil sleeps not, and we hear our
adversaries are busy, and our misery will be unexpressible great, and we We
desire the Reader to observe, that they were afraid of being overthrown in a
free general Assembly, and therefore they took a course by these private
instructions to prevent all freedom in the Assembly, and to make sure that
none should be chosen a member of it, but such of whom they were sure.
ludibrious if they shall prevail over us in a free general Assembly, for
which we have been pleading so long; it were meet that so far as may be a new
warning should be given, to stir up the best affected.

2 That every Nobleman be diligent with the Barons and Ministers nearest unto
them, and that he write unto his best acquaintance, who are far off.

3 That some one Minister and Gentleman in every Presbytery meet often together,
to resolve upon the particular Commissioners to be chosen, and use all
diligence with the rest of the Ministers and Gentlemen that such may be chosen.

4 Because nothing will avail so much for our purpose, where the most part of
the Ministers are disaffected, as that the Gentlemen be present to vote in
Presbyteries, it would be presently tried whether this be put in execution; and
if the Minister be slow in urging it, the Gentlemen themselves to urge it, and
put themselves in possession.







20. of September; and that only the Gentlemen who are named Commissioners to
the Presbytery, for choosing their Commissioners for the Assembly, with some to
assist them, that day stay at home, and those to come away immediately after
the election.



THe other paper was directed to some Minister of every Presbytery, in whom
they put most special trust, containing these eight Articles ensuing.

Private Instructions, August 27. 1638.












he be chosen: And where there is none, there be chosen a Baron, or one of the
best quality, and he only a Covenanter.

de potestate supremi Magistratus in ecclesiasticis, praesertim in convocandis
Conciliis, de Senioribus, de Episcopatu, de Juramento, de Liturgia, and
corruptelis ejusdem.

NOw both these were so closely carried, that the rest of the covenanting
Ministers never suspected there had been any other instructions, save the two
public and avowed papers before related; nor would they ever have suspected
any such close and double dealing, but that when they came to their elections,
they found for the most part the ablest and most experienced Ministers passed
by, and only the rigidest and hottest men chosen; which made them (inquiring
after the reason of it) come to hear of these private Instructions, at which
they stormed exceedingly, but could not then help any thing. And now whether
these two papers do not contain prelimitations of the assembly, a thing
against which they most fearfully cried out, We leave it to the judgment of
the Reader.

The Moderatour and some Noblemen lay Elders, went about to clear themselves
from the notice of these two papers of the secret instructions, but could not
do it: Our Commissioner when he delivered them to the Clerk to be read, told
him, That surely they were papers which he had seen before, and with which he
was well acquainted: The former of these, to a lay Elder of every Presbytery,
in which is that seditious Article, being the sixth in number (intimating their
fear of the loss of their Civil liberty as well as Christian) he
acknowledged he had seen; but denied that he had seen the other. One of the
principal covenanting Lords affirmed, That these Instructions were not sent
from the Tables, but that they might be some private advices from one friend
to another; for proof whereof, he offered to produce the two papers of
public Instructions which had been sent from their Tables, and which are set
down before by Us in this Narration. To this Our Commissioner answered, That
the sending of these public instructions, of which all the Kingdom had
notice, was a weak argument to prove that they sent no other private ones;
That he acknowledged these private instructions were not sent from their
public Tables, but he offered to prove that they were sent to the several
Presbyteries by the direction of some of the principal rulers of the Tables,
who labored by all means to conceal them from the rest of their party, who
they were sure would take offense at them: That they were sent from one friend
to another by way of private advice, he declared to be impossible for these two
reasons; First, because it could not be imagined that several men, writing to
their private friends, should light upon the same words, and yet that the
copies of these instructions sent unto him Our Commissioner from many parts of
the Kingdom, very far distant one from another, were the very same:
Secondly, because he and every man did find that all the elections now
returned, were made throughout the whole Kingdom according to these private
instructions, and in pursuance of them: And, that these private instructions
were undoubtedly sent, besides the two reasons last mentioned, it does
evidently appear; will justify the receipt of these papers from them
whenever he shall be put to it, as he would have done in the Assembly if he
had been urged thereunto; which he expected they would have done, but did not,
because they knew there were diverse members of the Assembly there present, who
were well acquainted with the truth of what he had delivered concerning these
secret instructions.

After this, first diverse of the Lords, and then some of the Ministers,
entreated Our Commissioner to stay, adding many words both to that purpose, and
for justifying their proceedings. To the Lords our Commissioner answered, That
for many months, only their Tables had been obeyed, but that We and Our
Council Table had received no obedience at all; he was therefore now to try
their obedience in this point, whether they would dissolve themselves at our
special commandment. To the Ministers he replied, That one of the chief
reasons which had moved Us to dissolve this Assembly, was, to vindicate them
from the tyranny of Lay Elders, who as they had gone about to suppress the
Bishops, so now to oppress them; and, if We did not protect them, would
undoubtedly prove, not only ruling but overruling Elders: And withal added,
That if they would now depart he would be a suitor to Us for the indiction of a
new free general Assembly, in which they might mend all the faults committed
by them in their proceedings at this.

Here the Earl of Argyle, one of our Councellers and Assessors to Our
Commissioner, desired to speak: his voice was low, his speech he directed to
the Covenanters; the sum of it was, That he was surprised, and did not expect
this sudden rupture, but that he was willing to say something, which was, That
he held it fit the Assembly should consist of Laymen as well as Churchmen;
because these two made up one complete body, exhorted them to stand by the
Confession of Faith, as it was sworn in 1581. After he had done, Our
Commissioner desired the Moderatour to say prayer, and so to dismiss the
Assembly; which he was about to do, but was hindered by the Lords, who fell
again with new persuasions to urge Our Commissioners stay with them: which he
answered with so much expression of grief for there misdemeanors, which had
necessarily enforced this rupture, that very many of the Assembly seemed to be
much moved with it. When nothing could persuade his stay, at last some of the
Lords told him, that fearing this rupture they had a protestation ready against
what he had said and done, which they desired him to hear read; which so soon
as the Clerk begun to read, Our Commissioner repeated his former protestation,
adding, in express words, that in Our name he dissolved the Court under the
higest pains: and so came out with the Lords of Our Council, leaving the
Clerk reading their protestation. When he came to the Church door, he found it
shut, so that some of his company were glad to force it open.

No sooner was he gone, but the Lord Areskyn, eldest son to the Earl of Mar,
stood up and made this wise speech, not without tears: My Lords, and the rest,
my heart has been long with you, I will dally no more with God, I beg to
be admitted into your blessed Covenant, and pray you all to pray to God for
me, that he would forgive me for dallying with him so long. Three others of
meaner quality desired the same, and so all those four were presently
admitted into their Covenant. These men, at least the Lord Areskyn, were
resolved to enter into their Covenant long ago, but were reserved on purpose
for doing of it at that hour, for the greater glory of their Covenant: For no
sooner had they sworn, and the Moderator received them by the hand, but
presently he desired the whole audience to admire Gods approbation and sealing
of their proceedings, that even at that instant, when they might have feared
some shrinking and backsliding because of the present rupture, He had moved
the hearts of these men to beg admittance into their blessed society.

Immediately after, diverse stood up and spoke, but all much about one, and to
this sense: They had seen how careful and punctual Our Commissioner was,
like a good servant, faithfully to serve Us his Master, and to observe Our
instructions (speaking withal much to his singular commendation;) how much
more then ought they to be careful to be found faithful in following his
instructions, who was Master, as to all themselves, so even to him who was Our
Commissioners Master? These speeches being ended, two things were immediately
put to the question: First, whether notwithstanding Our Commissioners departure
and protestation they would adhere to their own protestation, and continue the
Assembly. They all voyced affirmatively, except the Lord Carnaegie Commissioner
from the Presbytery of Brichen, Sir John Carnaegie Commissioner from the
Presbytery of Arbroath, two Ministers Commissioners from the Presbytery of
Strabogie, the lay Elder and Ministers Commissioners from the Presbytery of
Peebles, Doctor Strange Principal of the College of Glasgow, Doctor Baroune
Commissioner from the Universitie of S. Andrews* with some others, who refused
to sit with them any longer. The second was whether the Assembly, though
discharged by Our Commissioner, was competent Judge to the Bishops, and whether
they would go on in their trial, notwithstanding the reasons contained in
their Declinator: and this passed affirmatively without one contrary voice;
and so for that night the Assembly was dismissed.

Our Commissioner after he had left the Assembly, that very night, though
late, assembled Our Council; none were absent except the Earl of Argyle, who
made some excuse and pretense for his not coming, and the Lord Almond, who was
then sick. Two things Our Council resolved on; first, to write unto Us a
letter of thanks for those gracious proffers, which We by Our Commissioner had
made at the Assembly; Next, to draw up a Proclamation for the dissolving of the
Assembly. Their Letter here follows.

Most Sacred Sovereign,
IN obedience to your Majesty's Royal commands, we have attended your
Majesty's Commissioner here at Glasgow since the 17. of this instant, and
according to our bound duty in so exigent occasion, have not been wanting with
our humble and best advices: And although we do remit the particular relation
of what is past to his Graces self as best known to him; yet we cannot for
truths sake be so silent, as not acknowledge to your Majesty, that never
servant did with more industry, care, judgment and patience go about the
discharge of so great a trust: And albeit the success has not answered his
desires, neither yet his extraordinary pains, and (as we may confidently
affirm) most dexterous and advised courses taken to compass the just command
of so gracious a King; yet his deserving herein merits to be remembered to
posterity. And since your Majesty has been pleased to renew to us your former
act of grace expressed in your Proclamation and Declaration anent the
maintenance of the true Religion, and we in the defense and profession thereof;
we do all in humility and hearty acknowledgement of so great goodness,
return to your Majesty the offer of our lives and fortunes in defense of your
Sacred person, and maintenance of your Royal Authority: and shall in all our
actions approve our selves your Majesty's most loyal subjects and humble
servants.

From Glasgow, Novem. 28. 1638.

TO this Letter the Lord of Argyle refused to set his hand. Next morning the
Proclamation was signed by Our Commissioner and Council, but the Earl of
Argyle refused to sign it, as before he had done the Letter. The Proclamation
here follows.

CHARLES by the grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith.
To Our Lovits, Heralds, Pursevants, Our Sheriffs in that part conjunctly and
severally specially constitute, greeting.
Forsameikle as out of the royal and fatherly care which We have had of the
good and peace of this Our ancient and native Kingdom, having taken to Our
serious consideration all such things as might have given contentment to Our
good and loyal subjects: And to this end had discharged by Our Proclamation
the Service Book, Book of Canons, and high Commission, freed and liberate all
men from the practicing of the five Articles, made all Our subjects both
ecclesiastical and civil liable to the censure of Parliament, general
Assembly, or any other Judicatorie competent, according to the nature and
quality of the offense: and for the free entry of Ministers, that no other
oath be administrate unto them then that which is contained in the Act of
Parliament: had declared all bygone disorders, absolutely forgotten and
forgiven: and for the more full and clear extirpating all ground and occasion
of fears of innovation of Religion, We had commanded the confession of faith,
and band for maintenance thereof, and of authority in defense of the same,
subscribed by Our dear Father, and his household, in anno 1580. to be renewed
and subscribed again by Our subjects here: Like as for settling of a perfect
peace in the Church and Commonwealth of this Kingdom, We caused indict a free
general Assembly to be holden at Glasgow the 21. of this instant, and
thereafter a Parliament in May, 1639. By which element dealing, We looked
assuredly to have reduced Our subjects to their former quiet behavior and
dutiful carriage, whereto they are bound by the Word of God, and Laws both
national and municipall, to Us their native and Sovereign Prince. And albeit
the wished effects did not follow, but by the contrary, by Our so gracious
procedure they were rather emboldened, not only to continue in their stubborn
and unlawful ways, but also daily add to their former procedures acts of
neglect, and contempt of authority, as evidently appeared by open opposing of
Our just and religious pleasure and command, expressed in Our last Proclamation
anent the discharge of the Service Book, Book of Canons, high Commission,
etc. protesting against the same, and striving by many indirect means to
withdraw the hearts of Our good people, not only from a hearty acknowledgement
of Our gracious dealing with them, but also from the due obedience to those Our
just and religious commands, notwithstanding We had been formerly so often
petitioned by themselves for the same. By their daily and hourly guarding and
watching about Our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering nothing to be imported
therein, but at their discretion, And openly stopping and impeding any
importation of ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever to any other of Our
houses within that Kingdom: Denying to Us their Sovereign Lord that liberty
and freedom, which the meanest of them assume to themselves, (an act without
precedent or example in the Christian world,) By making of Convocations and
Council Tables of Nobility, Gentry, Burrowes and Ministers within the City of
Edinburgh, where, not regarding the Laws of the Kingdom, they, without
warrant of authority, conveene, assemble, and treat upon matters, as well
ecclesiastical as civil, send their injunctions and directions throughout the
country to their subordinate Tables, and other under-ministers appointed by
them for that effect. And under color and pretext of Religion exercing an
unwarranted and unbounded liberty, require obedience to their illegal and
unlawful procedures and directions, to the great and seen prejudice of
Authority, and lawful Monarchical government. And notwithstanding it was
evidently manifest by the illegal and unformall course taken in the election
of their Commissioners for the Assembly, whereof some are under the censure of
this Church, some under the censure of the Church of Ireland, and some long
since banished for open and avowed teaching against Monarchy, others of them
suspended, and some admitted to the Ministry contrary to the form prescribed
by the Laws of this Kingdom, others of them a long time since denounced
Rebels, and put to the Horn, who by all law and unviolable custom and
practique of this Kingdom, are, and ever have been incapable, either to
pursue, or defend before any Judicatorie, far less to be Judges themselves;
some of them confined, and all of them by oath and subscription bound to the
overthrow of Episcopacie. And by this and other their underhand working, and
private informations and persuasions, have given just ground of suspicion of
their partiality herein, and so made themselves unfit Judges of what concerns
Episcopacie. And also it was sufficiently cleared by the peremptory and
illegal procedures of the Presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of law,
and without due form of process, thrust out the Moderatours lawfully
established, and placed others, whom they found most inclinable to their
turbulent humors; associate to themselves for the choosing of the said
Commissioners for the Assembly, a Laick-Elder out of each Paroch, who being in
most places equal, if not more in number then the Ministry, made choice both
of the Ministers, who should be Commissioners from the Presbyteries, as also of
a Ruling-Elder; being directed more therein by the warrants from the foresaid
pretended Tables, then by their own judgments, as appears by the several
private instructions sent from them, far contrary to the Laws of the
Country, and lowable custom of the Church: by which doings it is too
manifest, that no calm nor peaceable procedure or course could have been
expected from this Assembly, for settling of the present disorders and
distractions: Yet We were pleased herein in some sort to blindfold Our own
judgment, and over-looke the said disorders, and patiently to attend the
meeting of the said Assembly, still hoping that when they were met together, by
Our Commissioner his presence, and assistance of such other well disposed
subjects who were to be there, and by their own seeing the real performance
of all that was promised by Our last Proclamation, they should have been
induced to return to their due obedience of subjects: But perceiving that
their seditious disposition still increases, by their repairing to the said
Assembly with great bands and troops of men, all boddin in fear of war,
with guns and pistolets, contrary to the laws of this Kingdom, custom
observed in all Assemblies, and in high contempt of Our last Proclamation at
Edinburgh the 16. of this instant: As also by their peremptory refusing of Our
Assessors, authorized by Us (although fewer in number then Our dearest Father
was in use to have at diverse Assemblies) the power of voting in this Assembly,
as formerly they have done in other Assemblies; and by their partial, unjust,
and unchristian refusing, and not suffering to be read the reasons and
arguments given in by the Bishops, and their adherents, to Our Commissioner,
why the Assembly ought not to proceed to the election of a Moderatour without
them, neither yet to the admitting of any of the Commissioners of the said
Commissioners from Presbyteries, before they were heard object against the
same, though earnestly required by our Commissioner in our name. And
notwithstanding that our Commissioner under his hand, by warrant from us, gave
in a sufficient declaration of all that was contained in our late proclamation
and declaration, the same bearing likewise our pleasure of the registration of
the same in the books of assembly for the full assurance of the true religion
to all our good subjects; And yet not resting satisfied therewith, lest the
continuance of their meeting together might produce other the like dangerous
acts, derogatorie to royal authority, we have thought good, for preveening
thereof, and for the whole causes and reasons abovementioned, and diverse
others importing the true monarchical government of this estate, to dissolve
and break up the said assembly. And therefore

OUR will is, and we do discharge and inhibit all and whatsoever pretended
commissioners, and other members of the said pretended assembly, of all further
meeting and conveening, treating and concluding any thing belonging to the said
assembly, under the pain of treason, declaring all and whatsoever that they
shall happen to do in any pretended meeting thereafter, to be null, of no
strength, force nor effect, with all that may follow thereupon: Prohibiting and
discharging all our lieges to give obedience thereto, and declaring them, and
every one of them, free and exempt from the same, and of all hazard that may
ensue for not obeying thereof. And for this effect we command and charge all
the foresaids pretended commissioners, and other members of the said assembly,
to depart forth of this city of Glasgow within the space of xxiiii. hours
after the publication hereof, and to repair home to their own houses, or that
they go about their own private affairs in a quiet manner. With special
provision always, that the foresaid declaration, given in under our
Commissioners hand, with all therein contained, shall notwithstanding hereof
stand full, firm and sure to all our good subjects in all time coming, for the
full assurance to them of the true religion. And our will is, and we command
and charge, that incontinent these our letters seen, ye pass, and make
publication hereof by open proclamation at the market cross of Glasgow, and
other places needful, wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the same.

Given under our signet at Glasgow the 29. of November, and of our reign the
fourteenth year. 1638. Sic Subscribitur HAMILTOUN, Traquaire, Roxburgh, Murray,
Linlithgow, Perth, Kingorne, Tullibardin, Hadingtoun, Galloway, Annandaill,
Lauderdaill, Kinnoull, Dumfreis, Southesk, Belheaven, Angus, Dalyell, J. Hay,
W. Elphinstoun, Ja. Carmichael, J. Hamiltoun.

THis Proclamation being very solemnly made with sound of Trumpets, and by
Harolds, with coats of Our arms on their backs, at the market Cross of
Glascow, was received with a Protestation read in the same place by Iohnston
the then Clerk of the Assembly, assisted by the Lord Areskyn, and diverse
others, young Noblemen, and Gentlemen. The paper which Iohnston read, was not,
as it seems, that very Protestation which they printed; for he read something
out of a paper to that purpose, and offered it by the name of a Protestation to
him who read Our Proclamation, which paper the Clarke of our Council offering
to receive, Iohnston refused to deliver it, saying, He must stay until it were
written. By which it is evident, that they who at Glascow protested against Our
Proclamation, did protest and desired their Protestation to be received, before
it was penned, as it is now printed, and before they could so much as send to
them in whose name it was made, to know whether they would adhere to it or not.
But a Protestation against it they have since printed, which here now we do
subjoyne, that the reader may see how groundless and unwarrantable it is.

The Protestation of the general Assembly of the Church of SCOTLAND, etc. Made
in the high Kirk, and at the Market Cross of Glasgow, November. 28. and 29. An.
1638.
WE Commissioners from Presbyteries, Burghes, and Universities, now conveened
in a full and free Assembly of the Church of Scotland, indicted by his
Majesty, and gathered together in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ the only
Head, and Monarch of his own Church; And we Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Burgesses and Commons, Subscribers of the Confession of Faith, Make
it known that where We His Majesty's loyal Subjects of all degrees,
considering and taking to heart the many and great innovations and corruptions
lately by the Prelates and their adherents intruded into the doctrine, worship,
and discipline of this Church, which had been before in great purity to our
unspeakable comfort established amongst us, were moved to present many earnest
desires and humble supplications to his sacred Majesty, for granting a free
general Assembly, as the only legal and ready mean to try these
innovations, to purge out the corruptions, and settle the order of the church,
for the good of Religion, the honor of the King, and the comfort and peace of
the Kirk and Kingdom: It pleased his gracious Majesty, out of his Royal
bounty, to direct unto this Kingdom, the Noble and Potent Lord, James Marquis
of Hammiltoun, with Commission to hear and redress the just grievances of the
good Subjects, who by many petitions, and frequent conferences, being fully
informed of the absolute necessity of a free general Assembly, as the only
Iudicatorie which had power to remedy those evils, was pleased to undergo the
pains of a voyage to England, for presenting the pitiful condition of our
Church to to his sacred Majesty; And the said Commissioner his Grace returned
again in August last, with power to indict an Assembly, but with the
condition of such prelimitations, as did both destroy the freedom of an
Assembly, and could no ways cure the present diseases of this Church which was
made so clearly apparent to his Grace, that for satisfying the reasonable
desire of the Subjects, groaning under the weariness and prejudices of
longsome attendance, He was again pleased to undertake another journey to His
Majesty, and promised to endeavor to obtain a free General Assembly,
without any prelimitation, either of the constitution and members, or matters
to be treated, or manner, and order of proceeding; so that if any question
should arise concerning these particulars, the same should be cognosced,
judged, and determined by the Assembly, as the only Judge competent: And
accordingly by warrant from our Sacred Sovereign, returned to this Kingdom,
and in September last, caused indict a free General Assembly to be holden at
Glasgow, the 21. of November instant, to the unspeakable joy of all good
Subjects and Christian hearts, who thereby did expect the perfect satisfaction
of their long expectations; and the final remedy of their pressing
grievances: But these hopes were soon blasted: for albeit the Assembly did
meet and begin at the appointed day, and has hitherto continued, still
assisted with His Graces personal presence, yet His Grace has never allowed
any freedom to the Assembly, competent to it by the Word of God, acts and
practice of this Church, and his Majesty's Indiction, but has labored to
restrain the same, by protesting against all the acts made therein, and
against the constitution thereof by such members, as by all law reason and
custom of this Church were ever admitted in our free Assemblies, and by
denying his approbation to the things proponed and concluded, though most
clear, customable, and uncontraverted.

And now since his Grace after the presenting and reading of his own
commission from our sacred Sovereign, and after his seeing all our commissions
from Presbyteries and Burghes produced and examined, and the Assembly
constitute of all the members by unanimous consent, does now to our greater
grief, without any just cause or occasion offered by us, unexpectedly depart
and discharge any further meeting, or proceeding in this assembly, under the
pain of treason; and after seven days sitting, declare all Acts made, or
hereafter to be made in this Assembly, to be of no force nor strength; and
that for such causes as are either expressed in his Majesty's former
proclamations, (and so are answered in our former protestations) or set down
in the declinatour, and protestation presented in name of the Prelates, (which
are fully cleared in our answer made thereto) or else were long since proponed
by the Commissioner his Grace in his eleven articles or demands sent unto us,
before the indiction of the Assembly (and so were satisfied by our answers,
which his Grace acknowledged, by promising after the recept thereof to procure
a free general Assembly, with power to determine upon all questions, anent the
members, manner, and matters thereof) all which for avoiding tediousness we
here repeat: Or otherwise the said causes alleged by the Commissioner, were
proponed by His Grace, in the Assembly; such as first, that the ^ssemblie
refused to read the Declinatour and Protestation exhibited by the Prelates,
which nevertheless was publicly read and considered by the assembly,
immediately after the election of a Moderatour and constitution of the Members,
before the which, there was no assembly established, to whom the same could
have been read: Next, that ruling Elders were permitted to have voice in the
election of commissioners from Presbyteries, which was known to His Grace,
before the indiction and meeting of the assembly, and is so agreeable to the
acts and practice of this Church, in violably observed before the late times of
corruption, that not one of the assembly doubted thereof, to whom by the
indiction and promise of a free assembly, the determination of that question,
anent the members constituent property belonged.

And last, that the voices of the six Assessors, who did sit with His Grace,
were not asked and numbered, which we could not conceive to be any just cause
of offense, since after 39. National assemblies of this reformed church, where
neither the Kings Majesty, nor any in his name was present, at the humble and
earnest desire of the assembly, His Majesty graciously vouchsafed His presence
either in His own Royal Person, or by a Commissioner, not for voting or
multiplying of voices, but as Princes and Emperors of old, in a Princely
manner to countenance that meeting, and to preside in it for external order,
and if We had been honored with His Majesty's Personal presence, His
Majesty (according to the practice of King James of blessed memory) would
have only given his own Judgment in voting of matters, and would not have
called others who had not been clothed with commission from the church to
carry things by plurality of voices.

Therefore in conscience of our duty to God and his truth, the King and his
honor, the Church and her liberties, this Kingdom and her peace, this
Assembly and her freedom, to our selves and our safety, to our Posterity,
Persons and Estates, We profess with sorrowful and heavy, but loyal hearts,
That We cannot dissolve this Assembly, for the reasons following.

1. For the reasons already printed anent the necessity of conveening a
General Assembly, which are now more strong in this case, seeing the
Assembly was already indicted by his Majesty's authority, did conveene, and is
fully constitute in all the members thereof, according to the Word of God, and
discipline of this church, in the presence and audience of his Majesty's
Commissioner* who has really acknowledged the same, by assisting therein seven
days, and exhibition of His Majesty's Royal Declaration, to be registrate in
the Books of this Assembly, which accordingly is done.

2. For the reasons contained in the former Protestations made in name of the
Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, whereunto We do now
iudicially adhere, as also unto the Confession of Faith and covenant,
subscribed and sworn by the Body of this Kingdom.

3. Because as We are obliged by the application and explication subioyned
necessarily to the Confession of Faith subscribed by Us; So the Kings Majesty,
and his Commissioner, and Privy Council, have urged many of this Kingdom to
subscribe the Confession of Faith made in an. 1580. and 1590. and so to return
to the doctrine and discipline of this Church, as it was then professed: But it
is clear by the doctrine and discipline of this Church, contained in the book
of Policy then registrate in the books of Assembly, and subscribed by the
Presbyteries of this Church; That it was most unlawful in it self, and
prejudicial to these privileges which Christ in his Word has left to his
Church, to dissolve or break up the Assembly of this Church, or to stop and
stay their proceedings in constitution of Acts for the welfare of the Church,
or execution of discipline against offenders; and so to make it appear, that
Religion and Church Government should depend absolutely upon the pleasure of
the Prince.

4. Because there is no ground of pretense either by Act of Assembly, or
Parliament, or any preceding practice, whereby the Kings Majesty may lawfully
dissolve the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, far less His
Majesty's Commissioner, who by his commission has power to indict and keep it,
secundum legem and praxim: But upon the contrary, His Majesty's prerogative
Royal, is declared by Act of Parliament, to be no ways prejudicial to the
privileges and liberties, which God has granted to the spiritual
office-bearers, and meetings of this Church; which are most frequently ratified
in Parliaments, and especially in the last Parliament holden by His Majesty
himself: which privileges and liberties of the Church, his Majesty will never
diminish or infringe, being bound to maintain the same in integrity by solemn
oath given at his Royal Coronation in this Kingdom.

5. The Assemblies of this Church have still inioyed this freedom of
uninterrupted sitting, without or notwithstanding any contramand, as is evident
by all the Records thereof; and in special by the general Assembly holden in
anno 1582. which being charged with letters of Horning by the Kings Majesty
his Commissioner and Council, to stay their process against Master Robert
Montgomerie, pretended Bishop of Glasgow, or otherwise to dissolve and rise,
did notwithstanding show their liberty and freedom, by continuing and sitting
still, and without any stay, going on in that process against the said Master
Robert, to the final end thereof: And thereafter by letter to his Majesty,
did show clearly, how far his Majesty had been uninformed, and upon
misinformation, prejudged the prerogative of Jesus Christ, and the liberties of
this Church, and did inact and ordain, that none should procure any such
warrant or charge under the pain of excommunication.

6. Because now to dissolve, after so many supplications and complaints, after
so many reiterared promises, after our long attendance and expectation, after
so many references of processes from Presbyteries, after the public indiction
of the Assembly, and the solemn Fast appointed for the same, after frequent
Convention, formal constitution of the Assembly in all the members thereof,
and seven days sitting, were by this act to offend God, contemn the Subjects
petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redress of the calamities
of the Church and Kingdom, multiply the combustions of this Church, and make
every man despair hereafter ever to see Religion established, Innovations
removed, the Subjects complaint respected, or the offenders punished with
consent of authority, and so by casting the Church loose and desolate, would
abandon both to ruin.

7. It is most necessary to continue this Assembly for preveening the
prejudices which may ensue upon the pretense of two Covenants, whereas indeed
there is but one, That first subscribed in 1580 and 1590 being a National
covenant and oath to God; which is lately renewed by Us, with that necessary
explanation, which the corruptions introduced since that time contrary to the
same, enforced: which is also acknowledged by the Act of council in September
last, declaring the same to be subscribed, as it was meaned the time of the
first subscription: And therefore for removing that shame, and all prejudices
which may follow upon the show of two different covenants and confessions of
Faith in one Nation, The Assembly cannot dissolve, before it try, find and
determine, that both these covenants, are but one and the self same covenant:
The latter renewed by us, agreeing to the true genuine sense and meaning of the
first, as it was subscribed in Anno 1580.

For these and many other reasons, We the Members of this assembly, in our
own name, and in the name of the Kirk of Scotland, whom We represent; and We
Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons before
mentioned, do solemnly declare in the presence of the everliving God, and
before all men; And protest,

1. That our thoughts are not guilty of any thing which is not incumbent to us,
as good Christians toward God, and loyal Subjects toward our sacred
Sovereign.

2. That all the Protestations general or particular, proponed or to be
proponed by the commissioner his Grace, or the Prelates and their adherents,
may be presently discussed before this general Assembly, being the highest
Ecclesiastical judicatorie of this kingdom: Intolerable presumption
and that his Grace depart not till the same be done.

3. That the Lord commissioner depart not, till this Assembly do fully settle
the solid peace of this church, cognoscing and examining the corruptions
introduced upon the doctrine and discipline thereof: and for attaining hereof,
and removing all just exceptions which may be taken at our proceedings, we
attest GOD the searcher of all hearts, Most false.
that our intentions, and whole proceedings in this present assembly, have
been, are, and shall be according to the word of GOD, the laws and
constitutions of this church, the confession of faith; our national oath, and
that measure of light, which GOD the father of light shall grant us, and that
in the sincerity of our hearts, without any preoccupation or passion.

4. That if the Commissioner his Grace depart, and leave this church and
kingdom in this present disorder, and discharge this assembly, that it is
both lawful and necessary for Us to sit still and continue in keeping this
present Assembly, indicted by His Majesty, till we have tried, judged,
censured all the bygone evils, and the introductors, and provided a solid
course for continuing Gods truth in this land with purity and liberty,
according to his Word, our oath and Confession of Faith, and the lawful
constitutions of this Church; and that with the grace of God, We and every one
of Us adhering hereunto, shall sit still and continue in this Assembly, till
after the final settling and conclusion of all matters, it be dissolved by
common consent of all the members thereof.

5. That this Assembly is and should be esteemed and obeyed, as a most
lawful, full and free general Assembly of this Kingdom: And that all acts,
sentences, constitutions, censures and proceedings of this Assembly, are in
the self, and should be reputed, obeyed, and observed by all the subjects of
this Kingdom and members of this Church, as the actions, sentences,
constitutions, censures, and proceedings of a full and free general Assembly
of this Church of Scotland, and to have all ready execution, under the
Ecclesiastical pains contained, or to be contained therein, and conform
thereto in all points.

6. That whatsoever inconvenience fall out, by impeding, molesting, or staying
the free meeting, sitting, reasoning, or concluding of this present Assembly,
in matters belonging to their judicatorie, by the word of God, laws and
practice of this Church, and the Confession of Faith, or in the observing and
obeying the acts, ordinances and conclusions thereof, or execution to follow
thereupon, That the same be not imputed unto us, or any of us, who most
ardently desired the concurrence of his Majesty's Commissioner to this lawful
Assembly; But upon the contrary, that the Prelates and their adherents, who have
protested and declined this present Assembly, in conscience of their own
guiltiness, not daring to abide any legal trial, and by their
misinformation have moved the Commissioner his Grace to depart and discharge
this Assembly, be esteemed, repute, and holden the disturbers of the peace,
and overthrowers of the liberties of the Church, and guilty of all the evils
which shall follow hereupon, and condignely censured according to the
greatness of their fault, and Acts of the Church and Realm: And to this end,
we again and again do by these presents cite and summon them, and every one
of them, to compeere before this present general Assembly, to answer to the
premises, and to give in their reasons, defenses, and answers against the
complaints given in, or to be given in against them, and to hear probation
led, and sentence pronounced against them, and conform to our former
cytations, and according to Justice, with certification as effeirs; Like as by
these presents we summon and cite all those of his Majesty's Council, or any
other, who have procured, consented, subscribed, or ratified this present
Proclamation to be responsable to his Majesty and three Estates of Parliament,
for their counsel given in this matter, so highly importing his Majesty, and
the whole Realm, conform to the 12. Act. King James 4. Parliament 2. And
protest for remedy of law against them, and every one of them.

7. And lastly we protest, that as we adhere to the former protestations all
and every one of them, made in the name of the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Burghes, and Commons; So seeing we are surprised by the
Commissioner his Graces sudden departing, far contrary to his Majesty's
indiction, and our expectation, we may extend this our protestation, and add
more reasons thereunto in greater length and number, whereby we may fully
clear before God and man the equity of our intentions, and lawfulness of our
proceedings: And upon the whole premises the foresaid persons for themselves
and in name aforesaid, asked Instruments. This was done in the high Church of
Glasgow in public audience of the Assembly, begun in presence of the
Commissioner his Grace, who removed and refused to hear the same to the end,
the twenty eighth day of November: and upon the Mercate Cross of Glasgow, the
twenty ninth day of the said Month, the year of God 1638. respective.

THe Reader shall not need to look after much reason in this protestation; for
if he do, he will be sure to lose his labor. Much is repeated in it, of that
which has been delivered in their former petitions and protestations; all
which shall now be passed by, what is new in it, the Reader shall do well to
cast his eye upon that, taking along with him this advertisment, That there is
little or indeed nothing in it new, which is true. Toward the beginning you
find the Protestation made, not only in the name of the general Assembly,
but in the name of the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses, and
Commons, Subscribers of the Confession of Faith: Now how this Protestation
could be made at Glasgow in their names, who at that time neither were
acquainted nor possibly could be acquainted with what passed at Glasgow, being
in the several parts of the Kingdom so far distant from it, and many parts
having no Commissioners there, except those that were in the Assembly, We
leave it to the Readers consideration. They affirm not many lines after, That
it was made clear to Our Commissioner, that the Assembly which he meant to
indict in August, was clogged with such prelimitations, that he undertook
another journey to Us, and promised to endeavor to obtain a free general
Assembly without any prelimitation, etc. All which is so far from truth, as
nothing can be more; for he did never desire the Assembly to be prelimited; for
they themselves by their instructions both public and private did prelimitate
it, he did only desire, that (according to the usual custom before
Assemblies) some previous meeting and consultation might be held concerning the
forms of the Assembly; which might very well have been forgot, there having
been no Assembly held for many years before. Again, in the last words at the
end of the first section, one would wonder how any man could have the boldness
to affirm, That this their Assembly was constituted of such members, as by all
law, reason, and custom of that Church were ever admitted in their free
Assemblies, since they in their own conscience do know, that there is no law
extant for Lay Elders having voice in general Assemblies: And if there be no
law for it, We appeal to the judgment of every man endued with reason,
whether there can be any reason found for it, and whether if such a
proposition were to be propounded, and to pass into a law, he would give his
voice unto it if he had power so to do, That laymen (especially many of them,
being ignorant and mechanical persons) should sit in the highest
Ecclesiastical Judicatorie, and by their voices determine points of faith, and
other highest points of doctrine, and to inflict the highest censures of the
Church, even excommunication and deprivation, not only of Ministers, but of
Bishops, especially when in an Assembly the number of the lay-voices shall be
equal or very near equal to those of the Clergy, So that it may fall out,
that the voices of the laymen, having the voices but of twenty or thirty
Clergy men concurring with them in opinion, may carry the determination of
the highest point of doctrine against the rest of the Clergy, and those
perhaps the holiest, ablest, and most learned, though their number exceed a
hundred. Sure if such a proposition were to be past into a law, few voices
would be found to enact it; and therefore if there be no law for it already (as
undoubtedly there is none) they might have done well not to have talked of
reason for it: And that which they aver of the custom of that Church, is as
untrue as what they said either of law or reason: for We demand if there have
been never a free Assembly in Scotland these last forty years? Sure they will
confess there has been; and yet in none of these, Lay Elders chosen by and
sent from Presbyteries had voices in these Assemblies: nay, since the first
Reformation, has there been any free general Assembly in that Kingdom? No
question they will say there has; and yet We challenge them to name but any
one Assembly before this, in which the Ministers chosen Commissioners to it
from the several Presbyteries, were chosen by the voices and suffrages of
Lay Elders: so that for that point it is impossible they should allege either
law, reason, or custom, or so much as any one instance; and yet the elections
of all the Ministers present at this Assembly were carried by the voices of
laymen, and in many places in despite of the Ministers.

A little after the beginning of the second section they do affirm that which
they themselves do know not to be so; for when they say that Our Commissioner
did unexpectedly depart and discharge any further meeting or proceeding in this
Assembly, how can that stand with the words of the Earl of Rothes, who when
Our Commissioner was rising and departing out of the assembly, told him, that
his departure and discharging of the assembly was a thing not unlooked for, but
expected by them; and therefore they were provided for him, and had a
Protestation ready written against his discharging of the assembly, which he
desired him to hear (as is before mentioned?) But Our Commissioner refusing,
the Clerk presently begun to read it, and Our Commissioner and Council at
their departure left them reading it; and after his departure it was read out
to the end, and presently put to voices whether all the members of the assembly
would adhere to it; and the very Title page of their Protestation affirms,
that it was first read in the high Church, and afterward at the Market-Crosse
of Glasgow: Besides, the Moderatour made a speech to Our Commissioner upon his
departure, which none of the auditors did conceive to be extemporarie; for
when it was compared with any other speeches of his, delivered at any other
time of the Assembly, it was agreed that it was so much better penned or
premeditated and delivered then any of the rest of his speeches, that certainly
it was provided against Our Commissioners departure; and yet these men protest,
that Our Commissioners departure and discharging of the Assembly was to them
altogether unexpected, when they knew that they had carried themselves, and
meant to carry themselves so, that it was impossible but that he should
discharge the Assembly. A great mark of the sincerity of their proceedings.

That which immediately after they add, That they have fully cleared in their
answer to the Bishops Declinator all the arguments contained in it against the
assembly, as also those propositions made by Our Commissioner in his 11.
Articles or Demands, sent unto them before the indiction of the Assembly, and
that Our Commissioner acknowledged so much, is all of equal untruth with the
former; for neither have they satisfied the Bishops reasons propounded in their
Declinator, nor gave they any satisfaction to Our Commissioner his eleven
Articles or Demands: and that Our Commissioner acknowledged that he had
received satisfaction to them is so manifest an untruth, as they themselves do
know there is no color for it: They affirm within a few lines after, that Our
Commissioner did know, before the indiction of the Assembly, that ruling Elders
were to have voices in the election of Commissioners from Presbyteries: He did
know it indeed, but could not tell how to help it; and so soon as he did know
it, which was immediately before the indiction of the Assembly, he did sharply
expostulate it with them, and assured them, that it would induce a nullitie
upon the elections made to the Assembly; That We would never allow any for
members of the Assembly who were so chosen; That he had notice of this their
intention by the complaints of many covenanting Ministers, who were resolved to
protest against all such elections, but that he did know of any such elections
with approbation of them, cannot be charged upon him. And whereas they say,
that these elections are agreeable to the Acts and practice of that Church,
they have received already a sufficient challenge to make that good, which
undoubtedly they cannot: And where they add, that not one of the Assembly
doubted thereof, it is well known that some of the Ministers of Edinburgh, and
many more Ministers of the Assembly did grieve at it, but did not know how to
remedy it.

The whole third Section is so derogatorie to Our Royal authority, and indeed
does so unworthily debase the authority of Monarchs, as it is not to be
answered any way but by justice: for it gives no more power to Us, if We had
been present and sitting at the Assembly at Glasgow, then Thomas Patterson a
Tailor of Edinburgh had, who sat Commissioner there.

After, they subjoine some reasons for their Protestation: In the first, they
affirm that the Assembly was constituted by the word of God; but they do not
prove it, and sure never will. Then they affirm, that Our Commissioner
acknowledged the lawfulness of their Assembly, by assisting therein seven
days; but they conceal that he solemnly protested, and entered his particular
Protestation against every thing they said or did in it; and if he who
protests against a thing, may be said to acknowledge the lawfulness of it,
then it may be that they themselves do acknowledge the justice and equity of
all Our Proclamations, and Our power and authority in discharging of this
Assembly, notwithstanding all their Protestations made against these. And for
Our Commissioner his exhibition of Our Royal Declaration to be registered in
the Books of this Assembly, let the Reader remember the Protestation before
mentioned, which Our Commissioner made when he did so, and that scruple is
quickly removed.

Their second and third reasons are of their own fancies: They have lately
sworn so, and to that sense they have explicated their Covenant, therefore it
must be so: But they did wrong in both, and therefore none must follow them in
either, for every Oath unlawfully taken is unlawfully kept.

Their fourth reason has not one true word in it; for there is Law for Our
authority to dissolve the Assembly, there being an express Act of Parliament
which gives Us the sole power of indicting of an Assembly, viz. the first act
of the 21. Parliament of Our Royal Father: and sure, ejusdem est destituere
cujus est instituere, whosoever has the power of indicting has the power of
dissolving. They add that there is no preceding practice for it. We wonder
they can or dare affirm it: Did not Our Royal Father discharge that Assembly
at Aberdene? and when some few turbulent Ministers did notwithstanding hold it,
were they not convented before the Lords of his Council for it? who
undoubtedly had punished them most severely, if by their declining of the
Counsels authority, and appealing to a General Assembly, they had not fallen
into an act of treason, and so by Our Council were turned over to the Judges
in criminal causes; before whom, by a Jurie or Assise, they were found guilty
of treason, for that act of declining Our Royal Father and his Counsels
authority, all which we touched a little before. And that by clayming Our
power to indict or dissolve the Assemblies of the Church, We do infringe the
privilege and liberties of the Church, or do any act not consistent with the
Oath which We took at Our Coronation in that Kingdom, as is suggested in this
fourth reason, is most falsely and most seditiously affirmed, only for drawing
away of the hearts of Our good subjects from Us and our government. The Act of
Parliament for Our sole power of indicting Assemblies here follows.

A ratification of the Acts and conclusions set down and agreed upon in the
general Assembly of the Church, kept in Glasgow in the month of June 1610.
together with an explanation made by the Estates, of some of the Articles of
the same. CHAP. I.
The act is long and has many branches, We only recite two: First, it
confirms that Act of the Assembly, which acknowledges the indiction of the
general Assembly of the Church, to appertain to his Majesty by the
prerogative of his Royal Crown: and in the last branch of the act, Our Royal
Father and the three Estates do annull and rescind the 114. Act of the
Parliament held in Anno 1592 which did give some power to the general
Assembly, in some cases, of themselves to indict a new Assembly.

Their fifth reason contains an instance of an Assembly that would not stay
a Process which they had intended against Archbishop Montgomerie the
Archbishop of Glasgow, nor yet dissolve it self, notwithstanding they were
charged by Our Royal Father and his Council with Letters of Horning and
Rebellion to do one of the two: An excellent argument, Because one Assembly
did wickedly, and that which they could not do, we must do so likewise; as if
many years hence, an Assembly being charged by one of Our Successors to
dissolve, should not obey, but allege for their defense, That this Assembly of
Glasgow would not dissolve it self, notwithstanding the members thereof were
charged by Us to do so under pain of treason; as if one unjust act could
justify another. But they should do well to remember, that those who did but
offer to hold an Assembly at Aberdene, after it was discharged by Our Royal
Father, were first convented before his Council, and afterward severely
punished for it.

In their sixth reason there is no Reason to be found.

In their seventh reason they allege, that they cannot rise until they have
found Our Covenant and theirs to be all one. If by their Covenant they mean
the Confession of Faith and Covenant annexed, which was first enjoined by Our
Royal Father, and twice afterward by his authority renewed* then they needed
not to have sit one hour longer for finding of that; for any man that can read
may find the words and syllables of both, to be the very same without the
least alteration: But if by their Covenant they do understand their
explications, additions, and glosses which destroy and corrupt the very text
of the first Covenant, then certainly they should not have risen yet, nor could
have risen until the end of the world; for they will never find that these
corrupt glosses, and apocryphal additions of their own, can consist with Our
Royal Father his Confession and Covenant, upon which they pretend they ground
their own. Besides, as shall presently appear, they have discharged all men
to subscribe the Confession and Covenant commanded by Our authority; which We
suppose they would not have done if they had found them to be one; and
therefore if they be men of their words, they should have sat still and not
risen yet, because as yet they have not found them to be one.

After their seven reasons they add seven protestations of the same piece with
their reasons: The first, third, fourth, and fifth are not worth the reading,
for they contain nothing but their usual tautologies and taking the sacred
name of God in vain. In the second, and latter end of their sixth reason,
their is so much boldness expressed, as could never have been expected from
any men who had been acquainted with the names of King, Law, Authority or
Government: For who ever heard that subjects durst require their Kings
Commissioner not to depart out of the Assembly, when he himself had pleased,
although he had not been commanded by Us so to do? what greater command could
they have laid upon the meanest member of the Assembly then this, by which they
affronted Our Commissioner and in him Us and Our authority? But their cytation
of Our Council, who signed Our Proclamation, to appear as offenders before Us
and Our three Estates of Parliament, (which by the way We wonder how they can
be made up without Bishops) and to answer the subscription of Our Proclamation
as a crime, is a boldness that calls more for admiration then refutation.
They cite for this their doing the twelfth act of the second Parliament of Our
Royal Progenitor James the fourth. We wondered that in his days there should
be any warrant found for the allowing the members of a general Assembly in
any thing, in whose time a general Assembly had no existence: but when we
looked upon the act, We wondered much more; for there is not so much as any
word to be read there, which can be drawn to any show of construction that
way. That act attributes rather too much to Privy Councillors, then
diminishes them; so that upon perusal of the act, We were almost enforced to
excuse them, and lay the fault upon the Printer, who had mistaken the cytation,
until We remembered that in their cytations both of other acts of Parliament,
and many passages of holy Scripture, they are as far out as in this, hoping
(belike) that the Reader would never peruse them. That which they affirm about
the middle of the sixth Protestation, that the Prelates moved Our Commissioner
to dissolve the Assembly, We must aver upon Our own knowledge to be far
otherwise; for he did it by Our special commandment, when none of the
Prelates were near Us to give Us any such advice. Their seventh protestation
is usual with them, and therefore now not to be taken notice of.

And now when the Reader has perused both Our Proclamation for the dissolving
of that Assembly, and their Protestation against that Our Proclamation, and
has well weighed all the precedent first violences, and then jugglings for
their obtaining of such persons only to be elected, as should be sure to stand
for such conclusions as they had resolved upon at their Tables at Edinburgh, We
do leave it to the judgment of every man to consider whether We could any
longer continue that Assembly without indangering Our own Royal authority,
which they intended to supplant, and betraying into the hands and power of
their sworn and combined enemies the Bishops of that Church, who never
declined, nor yet do decline the trial of a general Assembly lawfully
constituted.

They did long call for a free general Assembly; We granted them one most
free on Our part, and in Our intentions: But as they have handled and marred
the matter, let God and the World judge whether the least shadow or footstep of
freedom can in this assembly of theirs be discerned by any man who has not
given a Bill of divorce both to his natural light, that is, his Understanding,
and to his connaturall light, that is, his Conscience. It is a great error to
conceive, that liberty and limitation are destructive one of another: for that
freedom which admits no bounds and limits, is not liberty but
licentiousness: When therefore they talked of a free general assembly, We
took it as granted that they meant not an assembly in which every one both in
the necessary preparations preceding it, and in the necessary proceedings in
it, might say and do what he would; but such an assembly, in which no man
having interest, should be barred either in the precedings to it, or
proceedings in it, of that liberty which the laws or customs of that
Kingdom and Church in which that assembly was convocated, do allow him: which
two bounds whosoever shall transgress, though they pretend liberty and
freedom, yet in all true intendment and construction, they must be taken
either for professed and common, or clandestine enemies to the freedom of that
assembly. What wresting and wringing was used in their last Protestation made
at Edinburgh, to charge Our gracious Proclamation with prelimitations, is
known; and it was detested by many even of their own Covenant. Whether their
courses, especially in the elections of the members of this assembly, were not
only prelimitations of it, but strong bars against the freedom of it, and
such as did utterly destroy both the name and nature of a free assembly,
inducing upon it many and maine nullities, besides the reasons contained in the
Bishops Declinator, let these few particulars declare.

chosen, or things to be discussed in the Assembly, but that all things must be
treated of upon the place, else the Assembly must needs be prelimitated.
Whether they did not transgress in all these particulars is easy to be
discerned: For besides these instructions, which it may be are not come to Our
knowledge, We have seen, and Our Commissioner at the Assembly did produce four
several papers of instructions, sent from them, who call themselves the Table,
all of them containing prelimitations, and such as are repugnant not only to
that which they called the freedom, but to that which is indeed the freedom
of an Assembly: Two of these papers were such as they were content should be
communicated to all their associates, viz. that larger paper sent abroad to all
Presbyteries, before or about the time of Our indiction of the Assembly; and
that lesser paper, for their meeting first at Edinburgh, then at Glasgow some
few days before the Assembly, and for choosing of assessors; These two papers
Our Commissioner delivered not into the assembly, because they did publicly
avow them: But their other two papers of secret instructions were directed, not
from the Table publicly, but underhand, from such as were the prime Leaders
of the rest; The one of them was delivered or sent only to one Minister of
every Presbytery whom they trusted most, and was only to be communicated to
such as he might be confident of, and was quite concealed from the rest of the
Ministers, although Covenanters: The other paper was directed only to one
lay-Elder of every Presbytery, to be communicated as he should see cause, and
to be quite concealed from all others: These are the two papers which before
you heard were delivered by Our Commissioner into the assembly, and they did
contain directions, which being followed (as they were) did banish all
freedom from this assembly; as does appear before by the reading of the
papers themselves.









principles is to watch over the manners of that people in that Parish wherein
they live, how can any man be chosen a Ruling-Elder from a Presbytery, who is
not an inhabitant within any Parish of the precinct of that Presbytery? And
yet diverse such, especially Noblemen, were chosen as Lay Elders Commissioners
from Presbyteries, within the precincts whereof they never were inhabitants,
against all sense or reason, even upon their own grounds.











Besides these nullities of this Assembly, what indecencie and rudeness was to
be discerned in it? not so much as the face of an Ecclesiastical meeting to
be seen, not a gown worn by any member of it, unless it were by one or two
Ministers who lived in the Town, the appearance in a manner wholly Laicall*
amongst the members of it were seven Earls, ten Lords, forty Gentlemen, one
and fifty Burgesses; many of them in colored clothes, and swords by their
sides, all which did give voices not only in very high points of controversy
(which We are sure very many of them did not understand,) but also in the
sentences of excommunication pronounced against the Bishops and others: Nay and
more, all things in the Assembly carried by the sway of these Lay Elders,
insomuch that all the time which Our Commissioner stayed in the Assembly, it
was a very rare thing to hear a Minister speak; for there was one Earl and
one Lord who spoke far more then all the Ministers, except the Moderatour.
And in the Assembly every thing which was put to voices, was so clearly
discerned to have been resolved amongst themselves before by a palpable
pre-agreement, that it was very tedious to the auditors to hear the List of
the Assembly called, when the conclusion of it was known to them all, after
the hearing of his voice who was first called; which made some present to envy
no member of the Assembly but one, whose fortune it was ever to be first
called, his name being set down first in the List; his name was Master
Alexander Carse Minister of Polwart, one of the Commissioners from the
Presbytery of Dunce: For if the Acts of this Assembly should come out in
Latin, and be thought worth any thing in the Christian world, and withal it
should be expressed that the List of the members of it was called to the
passing of every Act, and his name should ever be found to be the first, there
was never a Father nor Bishop, whose name is in any of the Greek or Latin
Counsels, so famous as this man should now be: for he would be taken for a
man of an unparalleled judgment both for soundness and profoundnesse, from
whose judgment not one of the whole Assembly (except one, and that but once)
did ever swerve in the least particular; for as he begun, all the rest did
constantly follow.

All these things being well considered, what hope could be conceived of any
good, either for the Church or Kingdom, from an Assembly thus miserably
constituted? And therefore We resolved to dissolve it, as knowing that it would
make that Church and Kingdom ridiculous to the whole World, especially to the
adversaries of Our Religion; that it would both grieve and scandalize all the
other Reformed Churches, and make Our Justice to be universally traduced, if
We should have suffered the Bishops Our subjects, in that which concerned their
callings, their reputations and fortunes, to be judged by their sworn enemies
thus prepapared against them.

After Our Commissioners departure from Glasgow, they still continued their
Assembly notwithstanding Our dissolving it by Proclamation under pain of
treason: And then immediately the Earl of Argyle, who indeed all this while
had been the heart of their Covenant, begun to declare himself openly to be
the head of it; for he presently adjoined himself to them, sat continually
with them in the assembly, although he were no member of it, nor had suffrage
there, but sat only as their chief director and countenancer, and indeed
like Our Commissioner.

It was not to be expected that after We had dissolved the assembly, they would
observe any greater moderation in their proceedings then they had done before:
nor did they indeed; for all things passed in a hudling confusion, nothing
argued publicly, but every particular referred to some few Committees, who
were the most rigidest they could pick out of the whole pack: what they
resolved on, was propounded presently to the assembly, swallowed down without
further discussing; Mr Alexander Carse was called up, what he said first all
the rest said the same. In one hour they declared six general assemblies to
be null and void, though two of them were then and are still in force by
several acts of Parliament, and diverse acts of the other four are ratified
and confirmed by Parliament. In another hour they condemned, upon the report
of a few Ministers, all the Arminian tenets (as they call them) and, under that
name, many things received by all the Reformed Churches: a strange way, to
condemn the Arminian tenets without defining what those tenets were. In
another hour, they deprived the Archbishop of Saint Andrews, the Bishops of
Galloway and Brechen, and so at other times all the rest of the Bishops, many
of whom they likewise excommunicated: where it is observable, that in the
printed acts of this their (now after Our dissolving of it) pretended assembly,
the acts of the depositions of the Bishops bear no such odious crimes, as they
had made Our people believe they were guilty of in that infamous libell which
they caused to be read in the Pulpits against them; for proof whereof We have
caused one of their sentences of deposition to be here inserted, whereby it may
be seen that not so much as one witness was examined, nor offered to be
produced against them for any one of those fearful crimes with which they were
slandered in the libell, but were only deposed for their obedience to acts of
Parliaments and general assemblies.

Sentence of deposition against Mr John Guthrie pretended Bishop of Murray; Mr
John Grahame pretended Bishop of Orknay; Mr James Fairly pretended Bishop of
Lismoir; Mr Neil Campbell pretended Bishop of Isles.
THe general Assembly having heard the libels and complaints given in against
the foresaids pretended Bishops, to the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and sundry
Presbyteries within their Diocese, and by the said Presbyteries referred to
this Assembly to be tried: The said^ pretended Bishops being lawfully cyted,
oftentimes called, and not compearing, proceeded to the cognition of the
complaints and libels against them; and finding them guilty of the breach of
the cautions agreed upon in the Assembly at Montrose Anno 1600. for restricting
of the Minister voter in Parliament, from incroaching upon the liberties and
jurisdictions of this Kirk, which was set down with certification of
deposition, infamy, and excommunication; and especially for receiving
consecration to the office of Episcopacie, condemned by the Confession of
Faith, and Acts of this Kirk, as having no warrant nor foundament in the word
of God; and by virtue of this usurped power, and power of the high Commission,
pressing the Kirk with novations in the worship of God; and for their refusal
to underlye the trial of the reigning slander of sundry other gross
transgressions and offenses laid to their charge: Therefore the Assembly, moved
with zeal to the glory of God, and purging of this Kirk, ordaines the said
pretended Bishops to be deposed, and by these presents does depose them, not
only of the office of Commissionarie to vote in Parliament, Council, or
convention in name of the Kirk; but also of all functions, whether of
pretended Episcopal or ministerial calling: And likewise in case they
acknowledge not this Assembly, reverence not the constitutions thereof, and
obey not the sentence, and make not their repentance, conform to the order
prescribed by this Assembly, ordaines them to be excommunicated, and declared
to be of these whom Christ commands to be holden by all and every one of the
faithful as Ethnicks and Publicans: and the sentence of excommunication to be
pronounced upon their refusal, in the Kirks appointed, by any of these who are
particularly named, to have the charge of trying their repentance or
impenitencie, and that the execution of this sentence be intimate in all the
Kirkes within this Realm, by the Pastors of every particular congregation, as
they will be answerable to their Presbyteries and Synods, or the next general
Assembly, in case of negligence of the Presbyteries and Synods.

IN another hour they declared Episcopal government to be inconsistent with
the laws of that Church and Kingdom, and so abolished it for ever, though it
did then, and does still stand confirmed by many Acts both of Parliaments and
Assemblies: they deprived the Ministers, whose hands were at the Protestations
against Lay Elders and elections made by them: some Ministers they deprived for
Arminianisme; a course never heard of in any place where any rule of justice
was observed, that a Minister should be deprived for holding any tenet which is
not against the doctrine of that Church wherein he lives, and that before it
be prohibited and condemned by that Church: Now there is nothing in the
confession of that Church against these tenets. At the Synod of Dort no man was
censured for holding any doctrine against the conclusions of it, before the
Synod had determined against them, nor was he to be censured for any thing he
had preached or printed, before that Synod did tender unto him their Canons to
be subscribed: But at Glasgow no such course was taken, but Ministers were
deprived without so much as ever being once asked the question whether they
held any such opinion; or if they did, whether they would now recall their
opinions, and conform their judgments to the judgment of the Assembly in
these points. Some of their Ministers being asked the question, With what
conscience or justice they could deprive their brethren for holding opinions
not condemned by that Church, who perhaps after their Church had condemned
them, out of their love to the peace of their Church would have forborne any
further meddling with them; They returned this weak answer, That these tenets
were condemned by that Church under the general name of Popery: But they
could make no answer when it was told them, That certainly these tenets could
not be counted Popish, concerning which, or the chief of which, as learned
Papists as any in the World, viz. the Dominicans and Jesuits did differ as
much as the Protestants did; and that those who do adhere to the Augustan
confession, did hold that side of these tenets which the Arminians do hold,
and yet they were very far from being Papists, being the first Protestants; and
therefore it was against all sense to condemn that for Popery, which was held
by many Protestant Churches, and rejected by many learned Papists. But all
would not serve; they would deprive Ministers for holding them, before they
themselves had condemned them. In the deprivation of one of these Ministers
there did fall out a memorable passage, which was this: The Moderatour of the
Assembly, after the sentence of a Ministers deprivation, was pleased to move
this learned question to the Assembly, Whether* if this deprived Minister
should baptize a child, the child must not be baptized again? But he was
presently taken off by one of his brethren, who it seems was much ashamed of
such a question, and told him, That they did never re-baptize those who had
been baptized by Popish Priests; and so all further talk of it was hushed.
What conclusions were to be expected from an Assembly whose Moderatour was so
grossly ignorant as to move such questions, is easy to be conjectured.

And the weakness of their conclusions would easily appear, if all their
several Acts were printed; but because the Reader shall be able to make some
judgment of them, We have here caused an Index of the titles of their Acts to
be inserted, by which may be seen what they hold.

BY these it is easy to be discerned what conclusions, tending to Sedition and
Rebellion, and the overthrow of the laws both of Church and Kingdom, were
agreed upon; what false, nay and what foolish positions there were established;
For instance, Had it not been enough to have removed Episcopal government, the
five Articles of Perth, and the other pretended innovations, if they had been
furnished with lawful power so to do? No, but they will have it concluded,
that all these were abjured in the confession of faith when it was first
sworn; which no reasonable man can believe* and which they themselves did
allow in many not to abjure when they first swore their Covenant, and to which
many Ministers, members of this Assembly, had sworn at their admission into
their Benefices, according to the Acts of Parliament, and Acts of general
Assembly provided in that case; And so by swearing that these things were
abjured in the first confession, they make them profess that they had perjured
themselves in taking the other oath of their conformity to these pretended
innovations: Upon which rock one Minister of the Assembly finding himself to
be set fast, when that Act was voiced unto which declared Episcopal
government, and the five Articles of Perth to have been abjured formerly, and
so to be for ever removed: Mr. Robert Baylie voiced thus, Removed but not
abjured, to the great scandal of the rest of the Assembly, he being reputed
for one of the ablest men in it: But the Act was drawn up in these terms,
Abjured and removed, by the voices of all the Assembly, except his alone, who,
knowing that all the Acts were particularly to be read and voiced to again,
had drawn up a supplication to the Assembly in the name of those Ministers, who
before had conformed themselves to the five Articles of Perth, for a mitigation
of that Act, at least that it might receive a public hearing and arguing;
which the rest having knowledge of, when that Act came to be read and voiced
to again, one of the Lords, who was a lay-Elder, persuaded with the Clerk,
that in calling the List this Minister his name should be omitted, and so the
Act passed without so much as asking of his voice, who had his supplication
ready when he should be called upon by his name, but perceiving that the
omission of his name was purposely done, he durst stir no more in it, for
fear of public envy, and some private mischief which might be done unto
him; And yet you must think this was a most godly and free Assembly.

Toward the end of their Assembly, they divided themselves into several
Committees, which should after their rising see all their Acts put in
execution; a thing never heard of before in that Church. The Moderatour
concluded with thanks to God for their good success, and then to the
Nobility and the rest for their great pains, and last of all with a speech to
the Earl of Argyle, giving him thanks for his presence and counsel, by which
they had been so much strengthened and comforted: The Lord Argyle answered him
with a long speech; first, entreating all present not to misconstrue his too
late declaring himself for them, protesting that he was always set their way,
but had delayed to profess it so long as he found his close carriage might be
advantageous to their cause; but now of late, matters had come to such a
height, that he found it behoved him to adjoin himself openly to their
society, except he should prove a Knave, (this was, as We are informed, his
own word): Then he went on and exhorted them all to unity, wishing all, but
especially the Ruling-Elders and Ministers, to keep a good correspondence;
entreated all the Ministers to consider what had brought the Bishops to ruin,
viz. pride and avarice, and therefore willed them to shun these two rocks if
they would escape shipwreck.

The Lord who delivered this speech, delivered indeed the true meaning and
sense of the Covenanters: for it was neither the Bishops bringing in the
pretended innovations, nor their suspecting them to be guilty of the odious
crimes expressed against them in their Libell, which incensed this and the
other Covenanting Lords against the Bishops, but their fear of their daily
rising in dignity and place, which in this speech is called pride in them; and
their fear that the Bishops might recover out of their hands by law some of
the Church lands belonging to their Churches, which in this speech is called
avarice in the Bishops. In the mean time, whether it be not pride in these
Lords to envy any man's rising in the Church and Commonwealth, according to
that worth and sufficiency which his Prince shall find in him, and whether it
be not avarice in them not to endure that other men should legally seek to
recover their own from them, shall be left to the judgment of the indifferent
Reader. But for this revolted Lord who made this speech, and professes in it,
That if he had now not adjoined himself to them, he should have proved a
Knave, We can give this testimony of him, That at his last being here with Us
in England (at which time We had good reason to mis-doubt him) he gave Us
assurance that he would rest fully satisfied, if We would perform those
things which We have made good by Our last gracious Declaration (in which We
have granted more then We did at that time promise) so that We had little
reason to expect his adjoining himself to them, who had given Us so great
assurance to the contrary, besides that assurance which he gave to Our
Commissioner when he was in Scotland. And now if by his own confession he
carried things closely for the Covenanters advantage, being then one of the
Lords of Our secret Council, and that in the end he must openly join with
them or be a Knave; what he has proved himself to be by this close and
false carriage, let the World judge.

Our Commissioner, after he had by Our commandment dissolved the Assembly,
hearing that they who remained still at Glasgow under the name of an Assembly,
went about to put such a sense upon that confession of faith and band annexed,
which We lately had commanded to be renewed, as agreed best with those corrupt
glosses and false interpretations, which by their own Covenant they had put
upon it, as if Episcopal government had now by Our commandment been abjured;
and so did begin to magnify Our Covenant, and resolved to declare it to be all
one with their own, though they had in their Pulpits called it the depth of
Satan, and had assured their followers, that it could not be sworn unto
without perjurie, and that even after that Act of Council, upon which they did
ground their interpretation, he, having perused Our instructions which required
him not to suffer the confession of faith to be sworn in any sense, which
might not consist with the laws of that Church and Kingdom then in force;
thought it convenient to print a Declaration of Our clear meaning and
intention in requiring that oath; which, so soon as it was published, made them
quite change their minds, and prohibit the subscription to Our Covenant, which
they had immediately before so much extolled: Our Commissioners Declaration We
have here caused to be reprinted together with their printed answer to it,
because We are confident both by Our own judgment, and the judgment of
others who have perused them both, that the five reasons contained in Our
Commissioners Declaration stand yet unshaken for any thing delivered in their
answer unto them; and that as strongly as the Divines of Aberdenes first
Queries, Replies and Duplies do. Our Commissioners explanation follows.

An Explanation of the Oath and Covenant.
WHereas some have given out that by the Act of Council, which explaineth the
Confession of Faith lately commanded to be sworn by his Majesty, to be
understood of the Confession of Faith, as it was then professed and received,
when it was made, and that in that Confession, defense both of the doctrine and
discipline then established is sworn, at which time Episcopal government being
(as they say) abolished, it must needs follow, that the same government is by
this late oath abjured.

And understanding that even amongst those who continue together still at
Glasgow, under the name of a pretended and unlawful general Assembly, this
objection is held to be of some moment, and used by them to the great
disturbance of the peace of this Church and Kingdom, and to the great
disquieting of the minds of such his Majesty's good subjects as have taken the
said Oath, and yet never meaned nor do mean to abjure Episcopal Government;
and to persuade others, that if they shall take the same Oath thus explained by
the said Act of Council, by so doing they must likewise abjure the said
government..

We James Marquess of Hamiltoun, his Majesty's High Commissioner, wondering
that any such scrupulous misconstruction should be made of his Majesty's
gracious and pious intentions, and being desirous to remove all doubts from the
minds of his Majesty's good subjects, and to keep them from being poisoned by
such as by forced and forged inferences would make them believe, that they had
actually by taking that Oath sworn that which neither virtually nor verily
they have sworn, or ever intended to swear, or was required by Authority to
be sworn by them, either directly or indirectly; considering that all Oaths
must be taken according to the mind, intention, and commandment of that
Authority which exacteth the Oath; and that we, by special commandment from
his sacred Majesty, commanded the said Oath to be administered, we do hereby
freely and ingeniously profess and declare our mind and meaning herein, as
we have constantly heretofore done since our coming into this Kingdom about
this employment; viz. That by any such words or Act of Council we never meaned
or intended that Episcopal government should be abjured, nor any thing else
which was established by Acts of Parliament, or Acts of the Church of this
Kingdom which are now in force, and were so at the time of the taking of the
said Oath.

Nor indeed could we have any other intention or meaning, being clearly
warranted and expressly commanded by his Majesty's instructions, to exact the
said Oath, and take order that it should be sworn throughout the Kingdom in
that fair and lawful sense, and none other: Neither in this point did we
deliver our own words, or his Majesty's mind ambiguously or doubtfully, so as
any other sense, to our thinking, could be picked or wrung out of either the
one or the other; for we do attest the Lords of the Council, whether we did
not to many, or all of them upon several occasions in conference with them
ever since our coming into this Kingdom, constantly declare unto them, that
his Majesty's resolution was not to suffer Episcopal government to be
abolished: We attest all the Lords of Session, whether before our tendering of
that Oath to them, or their Lordships taking of it, we did not fully and
freely declare to them, that his Majesty's mind in commanding us to see this
Oath taken, and our own mind in requiring them to take it, was only to settle
and secure the Religion and Faith professed in this Kingdom, but was not to
be extended to the abjuring of Episcopal government, or any other thing now
in force by the Laws of this Church and State at the time of administering this
Oath, which their Lordships, being the reverend and learned Judges of the
Laws, knew well could not be abjured; after which perspicuous predeclaration
of our mind, their Lordships undoubtedly in that same sense and none other
took the said Oath.

And now, good Reader, having heard his Majesty's mind and intention, and in
pursuance of them the mind of his Majesty's High Commissioner concerning this
Oath, the reasons to repel the former objection seem to be needless (the
known mind of the supreme Magistrate who urges an Oath, being to be taken
for the undoubted sense of it;) yet for as much as that objection has of late
been mainly urged for alienating the minds of many of his Majesty's good
subjects, and well affected to that government, from adhering unto it, be
pleased to know, that the former objection has neither show nor force of
reason in it, and that by the said Oath and that explanation set down in the
Act of Council, Episcopal government neither was, nor possibly could be,
abjured, and that for many reasons, but especially these five, which we having
seen and approved, have caused to be here inserted, and leave them to thine
impartial consideration.

both in Church and Commonwealth.



to maintain Perth Articles, and to maintain Episcopacie. Why therefore some
men swearing the same words and syllables should have their words taken to
another sense, and be thought to abjure Episcopal government, more then
others who have taken the same oath in the same words, must needs pass the
capacity of an ordinary understanding.

it cannot be denied, but that oaths ministered unto us must either be refused,
or else taken according to the known mind, professed intention, and express
command of Authority urging the same: A proposition, not only received in all
Schools, but positively set down by the adherers to the said protestation
totidem verbis in the place above cited. But it is notoriously known even unto
those who subscribed the Confession of Faith by his Majesty's commandment, that
his Majesty not only in his Kingdoms of England and Ireland, is a maintainer
and upholder of Episcopal government according to the laws of the said
Churches and Kingdoms, but that likewaies he is a defender, and intends to
continue a defender of the same government in his Kingdom of Scotland, both
before the time, and at the time when he urged this oath; as is evident by
that which is in my Lord Commissioner his Preface, both concerning his
Majesty's instructions to his Grace, and his Graces expressing his Majesty's
mind, both to the Lords of Council, and to the Lords of Session; and the same
likewayes is plainly expressed and acknowledged by the adherers to the said
protestation in the place above cited: their words being these; And it is most
manifest that his Majesty's mind, intention, and commandment, is no other but
that the Confession be sworn, for the maintenance of Religion, as it is
already or presently professed (these two being co-incident altogether one and
the same, not only in our common form of speaking, but in all his Majesty's
Proclamations) and thus as it includes, and continues within the compass
thereof, the foresaids novations and Episcopacie, which under that name were
also ratified in the first Parliament holden by his Majesty. From whence it is
plain, that Episcopacie not being taken away or suspended by any of his
Majesty's declarations, as these other things were which they call novations;
it must needs both in deed, and in the judgment of the said protesters no
ways be intended by his Majesty to be abjured by the said oath. Now both the
major and that part of the minor which concerns Episcopal government in the
Church of Scotland, being clearly acknowledged by the Protesters; and the other
part of the minor concerning that government in his other two Kingdoms being
notoriously known, not only to them, but to all others who know his Majesty,
how it can be imagined that his Majesty by that oath should command
Episcopacie to be abjured, or how could any one to whom his Majesty's mind
concerning Episcopal government was known, honestly or safely abjure it, let
it be left to the whole world to judge; especially considering that the
Protesters themselves in that place above cited, by a dilemma, which we leave
to themselves to answer, have averred, that when that Act of Council should
come out, yet that it could not be inferred from thence that any such thing was
abjured.

Received, believed, defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realms,
but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty and three Estates of
this Realm, as Gods eternal truth and only ground of our salvation, etc. By
which it is evident, that the subscription to this Confession of Faith is to be
urged in no other sense then as it was then believed and received by the Kings
Majesty, and the three Estates of this Realm at that time in being; and it is
well known, that at that time Bishops, Abbats and Priors made up a third
Estate of this Realm, which gave approbation to this Confession of Faith: and
therefore it is not to be conceived, that this third Estate did then abjure
Episcopacie, or that Episcopacie was at the first swearing of that Confession
abolished. But say that at that time it was abolished by Acts of general
Assembly, yet was it not so by any Act of Parliament, nay by many Acts of
Parliament it was in force, because none of them was repealed; some whereof are
annexed in the sheet immediately after these reasons, which we pray the Reader
carefully to peruse and ponder: and at the very time of the taking of this oath
and after, Bishops, whose names are well known, were in being. Now it is to
be hoped that in a Monarchy, or any other well constituted republic, that
damnable Jesuiticall position shall never take place, That what is once enacted
by a Monarch and his three Estates in Parliament, shall ever be held repealed
or repealable by any Ecclesiastical national Synod.

By all which it is evident, that the explanation of that Act of Council so
groundlesly urged, can induce no man to imagine that by the Confession of Faith
lately sworn by his Majesty's commandment, Episcopal government, which then
did, and yet does stand established by Acts of this Church and Kingdom, either
was, or possibly could be abjured.

And having now (good Reader) heard his Majesty's mind in his instructions to
us, our mind in requiring in his Majesty's name this oath to be taken, and
these few reasons of many which do evidently evince the inconsequence of that
sense, which without any show of inference is put upon it by those who would go
on in making men still believe, that all which they do or say is grounded upon
Authority, though they themselves do well know the contrary; we suppose that
all they who have taken this oath will rest satisfied that they have not
abjured Episcopal government; and that they who shall take it, will take it in
no other sense.

Which timely warning of ours, we are the more willing to give, because we are
given to understand, that even they who were wont to call the takers of this
oath (notwithstanding of that explanation by act of council) perjured and
damned persons, and in their pulpits called the urging of it the depth of
satan, do now mean to take it themselves, and urge others to take it in that
sense which they make men believe (though wrongfully) that act of council
makes advantageous to their ends.

But we do in his Majesty's name require that none presume to take the said
oath, unless they be required so to do by such as shall have lawful
authority from his Majesty to administer it unto them: being confident, that
none either will or can take the said oath or any other oath in any sense,
which may not consist with episcopal government, having his Majesty's sense,
and so the sense of all lawful authority fully explayned to them.

HAMILTOUN.

THat episcopal jurisdiction was in force by acts of parliament, and no ways
abolished nor suppressed in the year 1580. nor at the time of reformation of
religion within the realm of Scotland, does evidently appear by the acts of
parliament after mentioned.

First by the parliament 1567. cap. 2. whereby at the time of reformation the
Popes authority was abolished, it is enacted by the said act, That no bishop,
nor other prelate in this realm, use any jurisdiction in time coming by the
bishop of Romes authority. And by the third act of the same parliament, whereby
it is declared, That all acts not agreeing with Gods word, and contrary to the
confession of faith approved by the estates in that parliament, to have no
effect nor strength in time to come. Whereby it is evident, that it was not the
reformers inte^tion to suppress episcopacie, but that bishops should not use
any jurisdiction by the bishop of Rome his authority; and seeing they did allow
episcopacie to continue in the church, that they did not esteem the same
contrary to Gods word and confession foresaid: as appears more clearly by the
sixth act of the said parliament, which is ratified in the parliament 1579.
cap. 68. whereby it is declared, That the ministers of the blessed Evangell of
Jesus Christ, whom God of his mercy has now raised up amongst us, or
hereafter shall raise, agreeing with them that now live in doctrine or
administration of the sacraments, and the people of this realm that profess
Christ as he is now offered in his Evangel, and do communicate with the holy
sacraments, as in the reformed kirks of this realm they are publicly
administrate, according to the confession of the faith, to be the only true and
holy kirk of Jesus Christ within this realm; without any exception by reason
of policy and discipline, declaring only such as either gainsay the word of
the Evangel according to the heads of the said confession, or refuse the
participation of the holy sacraments as they are now ministrate, to be no
members of the said kirk so long as they keep themselves so divided from the
society of Christ's body. Whereby it is manifest, that it was not the said
reformers mind to exclude any from that society by reason of discipline, and
that they did not at that time innovate or change any thing in that policy
they found in the said kirk before the reformation.

This is likewaies evident by the oath to be ministered to the king at his
coronation, by the eigth act of the said parliament, whereby he is to swear to
maintain the true religion of Jesus Christ, the preaching of his holy word and
due and right ministration of the sacraments now received and preached within
this realm, and shall abolish and gainstand all false religion contrary to
the same; without swearing to any innovation of policy and discipline of the
kirk.

Secondly, it does evidently appear by these subsequent acts of parliament,
that by the muncipall law of this realm archbishops and bishops was not only
allowed in the kirk, but also had jurisdiction and authority to govern the
same.

all civil privileges granted by our sovereign Lords predecessors to the
spiritual estate of this realm, are ratified in all points after the form and
tenor thereof. And by the 35. act of the parliament 1571. whereby all and
whatsoever acts and statutes made of before by our sovereign Lord and his
predecessors anent the freedom and liberty of the true kirk of God, are
ratified and approved.



archbishops and bishops have authority at their visitations to design
ministers gleibes.



to direct charges to the minister of the parochin to proceed to the sentence
of excommunication.



to stand in preaching the word of Jesus Christ, correction of manners, and
administration of the holy sacraments; and yet no other authority nor
office-bearer allowed and appointed by act of parliament, nor is allowed by the
former acts; but archbishops and bishops intended to continue in their
authority, as is clear by these acts following.

to pass to the bishop, superintendent, commissioner of the kirks where they
arrive and reside, and there offer to make and give a confession of their
faith, or then within forty days to remove themselves forth of the realm.



or to seek or procure the innovation or diminution of the power and authority
of the same three estates, or any of them in time coming under the pain of
treason.

That none of his highness subjects of whatsoever quality, estate, or function
they be of, spiritual or temporal, presume, or take upon hand to convocate,
conveen, or assemble themselves together for holding of councels, conventions,
or assemblies, to treat, consult, or determinate in any matter of estate,
civil or ecclesiastical (except in the ordinary judgments) without his
Majesty's special commandment, or express license had and obtained to that
effect.



their Ordinaries.



That our Sovereign Lord and his highness estates in parliament, having
special consideration of the great privileges and immunities granted by his
highness predecessors to the holy Kirk within this realm, and to the special
persons exercing the offices, titles, and dignities of the prelates within the
same. Which persons have ever represented one of the estates of this realm in
all conventions of the said estates; and that the said privileges and
freedoms have been from time to time renewed and conserved in the same
integrity wherein they were at any time before. So that his Majesty
acknowledging the same to he fallen now under his Majesty's most favorable
protection, therefore his Majesty with consent of the estates declares, that
the Kirk within this realm, wherein the true Religion is professed, is the
true and holy Kirk: And that such ministers as his Majesty at any time shall
please to provide to the office, place, title, and dignity of a Bishop, etc.
shall have vote in parliament, sicklike and als freely as any other
Ecclesiastical prelate had at any time bygone. And also declares, that all
bishoprics vaicking, or that shall vaick, shall be only disponed to actual
preachers and ministers in the kirk, or such as shall take upon them to exerce
the said function.

the ancient and fundamental policy, consisting in the maintenance of the
three estates of parliament, being of late greatly impaired and almost
subverted, especially by the indirect abolishing of the Estate of Bishops by
the act of annexation: Albeit it was never meaned by his Majesty, nor by his
estates, that the said estate of bishops, being a necessary estate of the
parliament, should any ways be suppressed; yet by dismembring and abstracting
from them of their livings being brought in contempt and poverty, the said
estate of bishops is restored, and redintegrate to their ancient and accustomed
honor, dignities, prerogatives, privileges, lands, teindes, rents, as the

AN ANSWER TO THE PROFESSION AND DECLARATION Made by JAMES Marquess of
HAMILTON, His MAJESTY'S high Commissioner, at Edinburgh, An. 1638. in December.
THis ancient Kingdom, although not the most flourishing in the glory and
wealth of the World, has been so largely recompensed with the riches of the
Gospel, in the reformation and purity of Religion from the abundant mercy and
free grace of our GOD toward us, that all the reformed Kirks about us, (...)
did admire our happiness. And King JAMES himself of happy memory, gloried
that he had the honor to be born, and to be a King in the best reformed Kirk
in the world. Those blessings of pure doctrine, Christian government, and right
frame of discipline we long enjoyed, as they were prescribed by GODS own word;
who as the great Master of his family, left most perfect directions for his own
oeconomie, and the whole officers of his house: till the Prelates, without
calling from GOD, or warrant from his word, did ingire themselves by their
craft and violence upon the house of GOD. Their crafty entry at the beginning
was disguised under many cautions and caveats, which they never observed, and
have professed since, they never intended to observe, though they were sworn
thereto. Their ways of promoving their course were subtle and cunning: as in
abstracting the registers of the Kirk, wherein their government was condemned;
in impeding yearly general Assemblies, whereunto they were subject and
comptable, and generally in enfeebling the power of the Kirk, and establishing
the same totally in their own persons: whereby in a short time they made such
progress, that being invested in the prime places of estate, and arming
themselves with the boundless power of the high Commission, they made
themselves lords over GODS inheritance: and out of their greatness, without
any show of order or Council, without advise of the Kirk, but at their own
pleasure enterprised to alter and subvert the former doctrine and discipline of
this Kirk, and introduce many fearful corruptions and innovations, to the
utter overthrow of Religion; and to make us no less miserable then we were
happy before. These pressing grievances did at length awake the good Subjects
to petition his Majesty and his Council for redress. And albeit at last,
after many reiterated supplications and long attendance, his Majesty has been
graciously pleased to grant a free general Assembly; yet in the beginning by
the credit of the Prelates, and their commodity of access, his Royal ear
was long stopped to our cries, and we discharged under the pain of treason to
meet for making any more remonstrances of our just desires.

In this distress none other mean, nor hope of redress being left, we had
our recourse to GOD, who has the hearts of all Kings and Rulers in his hand;
and therefore taking to our heart, that GOD had justly punished us, for the
breach of that national Covenant, made with GOD, in Anno 1580. We thought fit
to reconcile our selves to him again, by renewing the same Covenant. And so, in
obedience to his There is no divine commandment in Scripture, nor example of
the Christian Church for ^^bscri^ing any confession without the consent of the
supreme Magistrate if he be a Christian.
divine Commandment, conform to the practice of the godly in former times,
and according to the laudable example of our religious Progenitors, warranted
by acts of Council, we again renewed our confession of Faith of this Kirk and
Kingdom, as a real testimony of our fidelity to GOD, in bearing witness to
the truth of that Religion whereunto we were sworn to adhere in Doctrine and
Discipline, of our loyalty to our Sovereign, and mutual union among our
selves in that cause. Which Confession, with a sensible demonstration of GODS
blessing from heaven, was solemnly sworn and subscribed, by persons of all
ranks, throughout this Kirk and Kingdom, with a necessar explanation and
application for excluding the innovations and corruptions introduced in the
Religion, and government of this Kirk, since the year 1580. that so our oath
to GOD might be clear for maintenance of the doctrine and discipline then
professed and established, and according to the meaning of that time.

The happy effects of this our resolution and doing, have been wonderful: And
since that time GODS powerful hand in the conduct of this business has
evidently appeared. For after some time, upon the continuance of our groans
and supplications, our gracious Sovereign was pleased to send into this
Kingdom, The noble Lord JAMES Marquis of Hamiltoun, etc. with commission to
hear and redress our heavy grievances: who after many voyages to his
Majesty, and long conferences and treating with us, needless to be related in
this place, did in end, by commandment from his Majesty, indict a free
general Assembly to be holden at Glasgow the twenty one of November last, and
proclaimed a Parliament to be holden at Edinburgh the fifteenth of May next to
come, for settling a perfect peace in this Kirk and Kingdom: And further to
give full assurance to the Subjects, that his Majesty did never intend to
admit any change or alteration in the true religion, already established and
professed in this Kingdom: And that all his good people might be fully and
clearly satisfied of the realitie of his royal intentions for the maintenance
of the truth and integrity of the said Religion, his Majesty did enjoin and
command all the Lords of his privy Council, Senators of the College of
Justice, and all other Subjects whatsoever, to renew and subscribe the
confession of Faith formerly subscribed by King JAMES of blessed memory and his
household in Anno 1580. and thereafter by persons of all ranks, in Anno 1581. by
ordinance of the Council, and acts of the general Assembly, and again
subscribed by all sorts of persons in Anno 1590. by a new ordinance of
Council, at the desire of the general Assembly, with a band for maintenance
of the true Religion, the Kings person, and each of other in that cause: as the
Proclamation of indiction, being dated at Oatlands, the 9. of September,
published at the Market cross of Edinburgh, the 22. of the said month, more
fully proporteth.

Upon the hearing of which Proclamation, These who were attending at Edinburgh,
and expecting a gracious answer of our former desires, as out of bounden duty
they did with all thankfulness acknowledge his Majesty's gracious favor: So
out of zeal to GOD and Religion, they did protest, that they who had by the
late Covenant and Confession condescended more specially to the innovations and
errors of the time, could not after so solemn a specification, return to an
implicit and more general confession enjoined, conform to a mandat,
apparently discrepant from the genuine meaning of the confession, and wanting
both explication and application, and did most humbly and earnestly desire the
Lords of his Majesty's Council; that they would not, in regard of the former
reasons, press upon the Subjects the subscription of this Covenant, but that
they might be pleased to forbear their own subscribing of it, in respect of
the inconveniences might result upon their subscribing thereof, in an ambiguous
sense; but their Lordships not having subscribed that confession, containing
our former explanation, and being required by his Majesty's Commissioner, to
subscribe the Confession, as it was drawn up, and presented to them, without
our explanation, with a general band for maintenance of the Religion in
Doctrine and Discipline now presently professed, and of his Majesty's person,
least these words ( now presently) repeated in this year 1638. should infer
any approbation of these innovations, introduced since the year 1580. whereof
many did justly complain, after deliberation for removing of this scruple and
prejudice, and clearing of their own meaning; they caused make an act of
Council that their swearing and subscribing of the confession of Faith was
according to the tenor and date the second of March 1580. according as it was
then professed within this Kingdom: whereupon they rested satisfied, being
confident that the general Assembly then indicted, would remove any doubt and
differ which might arise anent the meaning and interpretation of the confession
of Faith, and clear what was professed in the year 1580. Yet some having
subscribed that Covenant in different senses, others forbearing to subscribe
the same, as some of the Lords of Session, till the Assembly should declare the
genuine and true meaning of the Confession, upon whose interpretation, as of
the only competent Judge, they might acquiesce, and rest satisfied: which now
after accurate trial of the acts of general Assemblies, and mature
deliberation, is fully cleared, and explained in this last general Assembly by
GODS mercy, and his Majesty's gracious favor of indiction, holden at Glasgow:
as the act made thereupon does proport: whereby Episcopal government, among
many other innovations is found upon undeniable evidences of truth and declared
to be condemned and abjured in this Kirk, in Anno 1580. There is
notwithstanding published in name of his Majesty's Commissioner a declaration,
tending to dissuade his Majesty's Subjects from receiving the explanation of
the confession made by this Assembly, and affirming that the confession
subscribed by the Council, does no ways exclude Episcopal government, nor
any thing else established by laws standing in force, the time of the taking of
the said oath, the ninth of September last; notwithstanding the foresaid act of
Assembly, which as the decree of our mother Kirk ought to be received and
reverenced by all her children, and act of Council, whereof the words are so
clear, as they cannot admit any mental reservation, which is acknowledged by
such of the Councellers then present and subscribers, whose hearts GOD has
touched, to make the sense of their oath to GOD, preponder with them above all
other worldly respects and fears.

THis declaration contains five arguments, with a boundle of acts of
Parliament, quotted and drawn up by some persons, whom we know not; but seen
and approven by the Commissioner: whereby his Grace indevoureth to evince his
conclusion, that Episcopal government was not abjured by the Council, nor the
Covenant 1580. Which is so repugnant to the acts of the Kirk; The act of
Council, and all reason, that we are confident, the same will make no
impression in the judgment of any well affected Christian, as shall be evident
by our following answers, which we offer to the readers consideration, after he
has first expended these generals.

Four general considerations of the Declaration.
1. This Declaration is only made by his Majesty's Commissioner, The Lords of
Council did take and were to take this oath as well as any other in the known
sense of us who commanded it, and therefore any Act of Council for their
explanation was unnecessary, and it is unjustly affirmed that this Declaration
or explanation was made by Our Commissioner, for it was made by Us, but
published by him at Our Commandment, as is plainly expressed in the title of
it.
and not by the Lords of secret Council, who should be fittest Interpreters of
their own act, and whose act should be the ample expression of their meaning,
else acts of Council, by possibility of admitting the variable co^mentarie of
intentions, will loss all force and vigor in themselves. And yet it is
evident that the Councellers have not only actually sworn to maintain the
Religion and Discipline established in Anno 1580. When Episcopacie was
condemned; but likewise intended to do so: because they have distinguished and
opposed between the Religion presently professed, 1638. mentioned in the
Proclamation, and the Religion professed in Anno 1580. mentioned in their act;
and by that opposition of now and then, they reject the one, and swear the
other: otherwise they needed no declaration: which notwithstanding accompanies
their subscriptions, and is acknowledged by the Commissioner in the second
line, to be an act explaining the Confession, for obedience whereof all those
who have subscribed that Covenant, have done the same. 2. Albeit his Majesty
did not conceive any difference between the Religion, Doctrine and Discipline
now professed, from that which was in Anno 1580. (wherewith his Majesty can
hardly be acquainted, without perusing the records of Assemblies) yet his
Majesty's Real intention was to maintain the confession of Faith professed in
Anno 1580. because his Royal disigne by that commandment was to maintain
true Christian Religion in purity (whereunto Episcopacie by this Kirk was ever
judged and condemned as prejudicial) and to remove the fears of his Majesty's
good Subjects, complaining of bygone innovations, and apprehending greater
changes: which ends are only obtained by subscription of the Confession as it
was Anno 1580. And no wise by maintaining the Religion now presently professed;
because the corruptions now presently received in this Kirk, are the grounds of
our just complaints, as being But when shall they be proved to be contrary
to the word of God?
contrary to the word of God, and foresaid confession in Anno 1580. 3. We must
distinguish between oaths, tendered by the first framers of the Confession,
They themselves do know that this Confession was not framed at first by the
Church as the positive Confession was, but by one Master John Crage, and
commanded by the Authority of our Royal Father, he did advise with the
Church concerning it, but they received it from him, not he from them.
the whole Kirk, who have power to interpret and explain the same, and oaths
required, to be renewed by the supreme Magistrate the Kings Majesty, who as
custos utriusque tabulae, and a true That the supreme Magistrate should as the
Son of the Church only receive the meaning of the Church, and cause it to
be received by his subjects, is not only the Jesuiticall tenet, but their very
words and syllables, and as they are alleged here very false, for the greatest
part of this confession conteyneth not matters of faith, but of government,
discipline and ceremonies: besides this confession was first enjoined by Our
Royal Father and his Council before it was approved by the Church: how then
Our Royal father, if he were now living, should receive the meaning of it
from the Church after he had subscribed it, and commanded his household to
do so; or we should now receive the meaning of it from the general Assembly
after it was subscribed by Our commandment, we cannot apprehend.
Son of the Kirk, ought to receive the true meaning of the Kirk, and cause it
to be received of those whom God has subjected to him.

And we are confident that his Majesty, in his just and pious disposition,
will never take away the benefit of that holy national oath, and confession
of Faith subscribed by his Majesty's Father of blessed memory 1580. and now
lately renewed again, and solemnly sworn by the Subjects of this Kingdom,
upon the pretense of any intentions repugnant to the true sense of that
confession: which even as it is subscribed by the Council, does never import
that his Majesty was framing or administering any new confession or oath, but
only injoyning to renew the old confession 1580. and therefore unquestionably
should be taken in the true meaning of that time. Fourthly, if there were any
real opposition betwixt his Majesty's Proclamation and the act of explanation
made by his Majesty's Commissioner and Council, Nay the first should be
preferred: for if our Commissioner and Council had explained it contrary to
Our meaning, Our declaration coming after should be preferred to their
misinterpretation.
Yet the last must be observed and preferred before the first, because the
first is his private will, the second his public, and judicial will. Et
posterior derogat priori, publica privatae. And albeit we do not now express
that the Council did subscribe the confession of Faith in obedience to a
mandat, where there was any contrariety, repugnancie, or ambiguity betwixt the
mandat and the Confession it self, which was commanded, yet the Council making
an act that they did subscribe it as it was professed 1580. and declaring
publicly that this was their own meaning, both they and such of his Majesty's
liedges, who did subscribe in obedience of their charge, are obliged to observe
r^m juratam, and the real matter of the oath (more then the mind and mandat
of the prescriver) especially seeing it is no new Confession, but the renewed
Confession of the whole Kirk of Scotland; The meaning whereof cannot be
declared nor interpret by any, but the whole Kirk of Scotland who now upon
unanswerable reasons, have clearly found that Episcopal government, was then
abolished and abjured: It follows by good consequence, that the Council did
both virtually and verily swear, yea intend to swear the abjuration of
Episcopacie, which is found by that confession 1580. and the discipline of the
Kirk then established, to be a corrupt government in this Kirk, of human
invention, wanting warrant from the word of God, tending to the overthrow of
this Kirk: So that any declaration in the contrare hereof is protestatio
contraria facto, and the reasons thereof cannot be forceable, to brangle the
resolution of any judicious well affected Christian, if he will patiently read
and ponder, without preoccupation, these following answers to the five reasons
insert in that declaration.

The first aleadged reason is this, that his Majesty could not command an oath
absolutely unlawful: Answer to the first reason.
but it is absolutely unlawful to swear against any thing established by the
Laws of the Kirk and Kingdom, if the same be not repugnant to the word of God
or repealed by posteriour laws. The last part of the first reason is quite
omitted, though in it lies the principal explication of this first reason.


To this we answer, First. The Kings Majesty by commanding his subjects to
renew the confession of Faith for maintaning the doctrine and discipline
professed in anno 1580. has commanded them to abjure whatsoever is found by the
competent Judge to be introduced since that time repugnant thereto, albeit by
the corruption of times it were cou^tenanced with some law interveening.
Secondly, the Lords of Council and Session and other Subjects have subscribed
the confession of Faith as it was 1580. not only without any restriction of it
to the present laws, but in a direct opposition to what is presently
established by returning from the present corruptions in the profession,
tanquam termino a quo, to the profession 1580. ta^quam terminum ad quem: which
a How many of them have determined so? they know that they are not co^parable
in number to those who have determined the contrary.
great part of Councillors and other Subjects have declared to be their
meaning. Thirdly, Episcopacie is found by the Kirk of Scotland in many
Assemblies to be an office unwarranted by the word of God, unlawful and
repugnant thereto: so that the abjuration thereof in this Kirk is lawful and
necessare. Fourthly, Episcopacy was never Most false.
restored by any Assembly of this Kirk, nor these Assemblies wherein it was
condemned, repealed, without the which the same could not be established by a
Parliament, whose power does no more reach to the placeing officers originally
in the Kirk, then the Kirks power to the making states men in the
commonwealth. Fifthly, the laws which any ways contribute to the
introduction of Episcopacy, do only extend to civil privileges, and were
always protested against by the Kirk, as contrary to the national Covenant
of this land. Sixthly, if any Assembly can be pretended to countenance
Episcopacie or other corruptions, it suffices to say that the same with all
the acts thereof is declared to have been null and void ab initio for undeniable
reasons, as the act at more length proports. Seventhly, the breach of our
national Covenant by introduction of corruptions thereby abolished, has
undoubtedly in high measure offended God: and therefore at the renovation of
that Covenant again with God, we ought not only to abjure al these
innovatio^s, but hereafter should be careful not to be relapse in our offense.
Eighthly, in no Covenant Episcopacie is expressly or specifice abjured, before
all Ecclesiastical laws favoring the same was repealed, and declared null,
but only virtually and generally, as being formerly abjured in anno 1580. And
as the trial hereof was referred to the Assembly, as the only Judge competent,
so now when the Assembly has declared and found Presbyteriall government to
have been approved, and Episcopal government condemned, abolished and abjured
in anno 1580. and in liew of perceiving that Episcopacie is of an Apostolic
institution, have clearly seen that it is justly condemned in our Kirk, as the
invention of man wanting warrant or fundament in the word of God, tending to
the overthrow of this Kirk, Therefore albeit Episcopacie had been abjured
expressly in the renovation of this Confession commanded by his Majesty, it was
not unlawful, but most necessary and incumbent to us all, who are tied by that
national Covenant against that unlawful Hierarchicall government, albeit we
had never renewed the same: But we are falsely calumniat to have condemned the
name of a Bishop, even as it is used in Scripture, which the act of Assembly it
self, sufficiently refutes, by allowing S. Paul's Bishops to-wit Pastors of a
particular flock, and condemning only al other Bishops brought in without the
warrant of Scripture.

Answer to the second reason.
The second reason in the Declaration is, that the oath for preserving the
discipline and government of the Kirk, cannot oblige after the alteration and
change of that discipline and government: and seeing the Discipline and
government of the Kirk is not only alterable, but changed in this Kirk, we are
not tied by that oath, after the alteration.

Whereunto we answer, first, that it is true, that policy and order in
ceremonies is temporary and may be changed, as is meaned in that article of
the Confession cited in the declaration: But a Bishop, or his office, or the
government of Gods house cannot be called a ceremony, nay, they will be loath
to be vilified by that appellation: but if it be a ceremony, they are of no
Apostolic constitution, as is mentioned in the first reason: so that if they
be lawful governors in Gods house, warranted by his word, they are not
alterable: and so this second reason militats not for them, if their office be
changeable, and accounted among alterable ceremonies: they are well exploded
from our Kirk; and may be so by that second reason of the declaration. 2. One
cause of general Councels is, for constituting a good order and policy in
ceremonies: which is grounded upon the last verse of the 14. Chap. to the 1. Corinthians. willing that all things be done decently and in order, wherein the
Lord gives not power to institute new officers in his Kirk, but commands his
own officers to exerce their functions by his commandments without
indecencie, or confusion, in the variable circumstances thereof, to be
determined according to the present occasions of edification, 3. In the 15.
Chap. of the same confession of Faith, all men's inventions in matters of
Religion are condemned; And in the 19 Chap. Ecclesiastical discipline
uprightly ministered as Gods word prescribes. Matthew. 18. 1. Cor. 5. is set down
as the third essential and unchangeable mark of the true Kirk of God; and so
is not of that nature with temporary, changeable ceremonies; though
unwarrantably ranked with them in the declaration. 4. It is evident at our
first reformation what policy was perpetual, and what ceremonies changeable,
for in the first book of Policy compyled that same year with the Confession,
9 head is expressed a twofold policy of the Kirk; The one absolutely
necessary in all Kirks, the other not necessar, but changeable; such as, what
day of the week sermon should be, and the like; whereof they established no
order, but permitted every particular Kirk to appoint their own policy, as
they thought most expedient for edification; if parity of reason will make
Episcopacie of this nature, let all men judge. 5. Our confession speaks of an
order in ceremonies; which cannot be appointed for all ages, as is before
said. But when they speak of the office-bearers in the Kirk, they acknowledge
according to the truth, that Christ himself appointed an ordinare constant
government of his Kirk by his four ordinar office-bearers, The Pastor, Elder,
Doctor, and Deacon, to administrat the same perpetually; as is set down in
the first book of Discipline, and in the treatise before the Psalms, which
was drawn up at that same time, and allowed by the same persons. Like as in the
year of God, 1560. when that confession was made, and in the year 1567. when
it was ratified, and by continual acts of Assembly, and by the second book of
Discipline; The government of Christ's Kirk by these four ordinary
office-bearers, is set down as founded only upon the Word of God, as constant
unchangeable, and perpetual; and as that holy discipline without which Gods
word cannot be preserved; so that the intruding of any other officer in Gods
house was accounted an offense against the Lord of the house. 6. By our oath,
we are obliged to continue in obedience of discipline as well as doctrine,
because they are both grounded on the Word of God, without the warrant whereof,
all traditions that are brought in are abjured, and the discipline of the Kirk
of Scotland is set down in the book of policy, as grounded on Gods word and
commanded to continue to the worlds end, whereunto we have sworn, and cannot
without perjury to God, gainsay it, like as the Assembly ordaines the
discipline of the Kirk to be subscribed as such, and the act of Parliament
1592. Ratifieth the discipline of the Kirk, as a privilege granted by God,
whereinto the Kings prerogative cannot be prejudicial. 7. It carries no show
of argument or face of probability, that the Kirk and reformers of Religion
which condemns all other ordinar officers in the Kirk, but these four
appointed by Christ, did mean under the name of variable ceremonies, to
comprehend and admit Episcopacy, which frequently they condemn, as an
invention of man, without the warrant of Gods word, tending to the overthrow of
the Kirk and purity of Religion. 8. Because in the XXI. Article cited, the
word Ceremony is used, therefore they would infer that this reason supposes
Episcopal government to be but a ceremony: But weakly, for the reason
consists in the word policy which they take no notice of, and Episcopal
government being a part of Ecclesiastical policy, they hold the one
alterable, (as all they do who adhere to that XXI. article) must needs hold
the other so too: nor can it be inferred from any thing in this reason that
Episcopal government is mainteyned by it to be alterable, but that they
themselves, and that XXI. article do hold it to be so.
The Prelates themselves will not grant Episcopacie to be reckoned in the orders
of ceremonies, which cannot be unchangeably constitute for all ages, times and
places, but are temporal as devised by man; and so changeable, when they
rather foster superstition then edify the Kirk, but herein they will disclaim
the benefit of this second reason, and undoubtedly affirm, that Episcopal
government, not only may be, but should be, and was appointed for all ages,
times, and places; and that it is not the devise of man te^porall and
changeable, but deriveth its extraction from divine Apostolic, at the least
Ecclesiastical, perpetual and necessar institution, as is averred in the
first reason; and so should ever be unchangeable. 9. This Kirk has ever
condemned all such as held the discipline, and policy thereof, to be
indifferent and changeable; and in particular in An. 1581. which is the year of
the subscription of the confession of Faith, and book of policy, Mr. Robert
Montgomery is accused and condemned for that doctrine. 10. In the Assembly
1596. upon the Kings Majesty's proposition, and demand that it might be
lawful for him to reason or move doubts, in any point of the external
policy, government, or discipline of the Kirk, which are not answered,
affirmative or negative in the Scripture. The Assembly concluded, that it might
be lawful for his Majesty, or his Commissioner, to propone any point to the
general Assembly in matters of external government, alterable, according to
the circumstances, providing it be done in right time and place, Animo
aedificandi, non tentandi: But as for the essential discipline, in the book of
Policy: The Assembly desired it, but did ever Our Royal Father do so?
The same Assembly desires the Kings Majesty to declare before his Estates,
that he never intended to prejudge the same. 11. Albeit it were granted that
discipline were changeable, yet now seeing by the Kings Majesty's own consent,
we have sworn to maintain the discipline of the Kirk of Scotland, as it was
1580. we are obliged strictly, interposito juramento, to abide by that
discipline specifice: at least till it be lawfully changed by the Kirk of
Scotland, in her free general Assembly, which can never be presupponed:
because in rei veritate, the Discipline, as well as the doctrine, is
acknowledged and sworn to, as unchangeable, wherein we must continue all the
days of our life: and defend the same according to our power, under the
penalty of procuring deservedly upon our selves, all the curses contained in
Gods Word. 12. The doctrine of the Kirk of Scotland, condemned Episcopal, and
re-established Presbyteriall government perpetually: which we have acknowledged
by joining our selves in the assertory part of our oath, unto the Kirk of
Scotland in doctrine as well as in discipline, and in the promissory part
thereof by swearing to continue in the obedience of the Discipline, as well as
Doctrine: to show that Discipline as well as Doctrine, is not variable, nor so
sworn to by us: but as an immutable law and constitution, which we are obliged
to maintain perpetually.

Answer to the third reason.
The third reason is that we who subscribed the Covenant, acknowledged that
Episcopacy was not abjured thereby, which is qualified by two instances. First
that the Ministers in their answers to the Quaeres of Aberdeine, expressed
themselves in that sense, holding these things for the present not to be
abjured, but only to be referred to the trial of a free general Assembly.
Next, that it is averred in our last reasons against the subscription urged by
his Majesty, that this oath, required by his Majesty, does oblige the takers
of it, to maintain Perth articles, and Episcopacie.

This needs no answer if the preceding narration, and the whole passages of
the business were considered and known; for in the application of our
Covenant, we did not expressly and specifice, abjure Episcopacie, but only
generally and virtually, by abjuring whatsoever was abjured in the Confession,
1580. which we found to be a strong band, lying upon us to bind us straightly to
the obedience of the discipline then established: wherein because there had
interveined some alterations, we permitted justly the trial thereof to the
Kirk, whether Episcopacie, Perth articles, and other innovations were not
condemned and abjured by the said oath, which now the Assembly after careful
search and examination of the records have clearly found. This is the true
meaning and substance of the answer made to the Quaeres of Aberdeine, and ought
also to be the ingenuous meaning of the Councillors, who by their act declared
they subscribed the Confession 1580. as it was then professed: which is
consonant to our general application, and which being now declared by their
mother Kirk, they ought to reverence and obey, and not upon light and subtle
pretenses to neglect and contemn. 2. For the second instance: It is true that
when the Council was urged to subscribe the Confession, 1580. conform to the
warrands bearing (that they should maintain the Religion now presently
professed) we justly feared, that the same being subscribed in 1638. would
comprehend Episcopacie, Perth articles, and all other corruptions introduced
since 1580. And therefore both in our written reasons against that
subscription, and in our speeches at the Council table, and to sundry
Councillors in private, we dehorted them upon that reason from that
subscription: which was the true cause why the Council being convinced with
that reason, made their explanatory act, declaring that they subscribed the
Confession according to the meaning 1580. and as it was then professed, for
removing of that doubt. 3. We defy any man living to produce from any Jesuit
or the greatest patron of equivocation yet ever heard of, such a wicked
position as this, that the swearer is neither bound to the meaning of the
exacter of the oath, nor to his own meaning who takes the oath, but to the
realitie of the thing sworn, as it shall be afterward explicated by the
competent Judge: For then no man can tell what he swears, when he swears;
if the declaration of the competent Judge shall come after, it were to be
wished that he who set down this proposition, had set his hand to it, that the
world might take notice of him for an ignorant fool and an arrand knave: In
the mean time, till Iohnston find out another, he must be taken for the man,
because his hand is at this foolish Pamphlet.
Albeit by the meaning of the prescriver of an oath, the swearer were tacitly
bound to maintain Episcopacie, Five Articles of Perth, and suchlike, yet
according to the premitted considerations, he is more oblished to the realitie
rei juratae, which is now declared and found to abjure Episcopacie, etc. Nor to
the meaning of the prescriver or his own either, being contrare to the
explanation of the sovereign Judge competent.

The fourth reason is Syllogistically urged thus: Answer to the fourth reason.
It cannot be denied but that oaths ministered unto us, must either be refused
or else taken, according to the known mind, professed intention, and express
command of authority urging the same. But it is notoriously known, that his
Majesty, not only in his Kingdoms of England and Ireland, is a maintainer of
Episcopal government, but likewise is a defender, and minds to continue a
defender thereof in his Kingdom of Scotland. And therefore the oath being
taken, and not refused, must be sworn conform to his Majesty's known meaning.
The minor is confirmed from our own Assertions.

To this it is answered first, that in contradictory oaths, This is directly
contrary to the words of their own protestation against Our Proclamation,
dated the ninth of September: see their ninth Reason in that Protestation
against the subscription to our Covenant, and you shall find it flatly
contradictory to this which they affirm now.
the swearer is more obliged to the true meaning of the oath, clearly expressed
therein, then either to his own meaning, or any sense of the prescriver, being
contrary thereunto. Especially in this case, where there is no new oath which
may receive any new meaning, but the renovation of the old oath, which can
admit no new destructive sense: but must be sworn conform to the genuine
original first meaning. 2. That oath was justly refused by us upon that ground
of discrepance amongst many others; and such like, was not received by the
Council, till they declared their meaning by act simul and semel with their
subscription. 3. We do not meddle with the Kirks of England or Ireland, They
do not meddle with the Church of England, but yet in all their Writings
declare that the government of the Church of England is against the Word of
God; and the pattern showed in the Mount: and that their new fancied
government, contained in their imaginary books of discipline, is only
according unto it.
but recommends to them the pattern shown in the Mount: all our arguments and
proceedings being for the Kirk of Scotland, where, from the time of her more
pure reformation then of her sister Kirks, Episcopacie has ever been
abolished, till the latter times of corruption. So that though his Majesty
has hitherto maintained Episcopacie in Scotland, because his Majesty wanted
the means to be informed of the acts of this Kirk, yet we know that God has
so richly replenished his Royal breast, with such justice and piety, that
when his Majesty shall receive perfect information, we are confident that He
will never desire any change or alteration in our ancient Kirk government and
discipline. Especially now when his Majesty has caused the maintenance
thereof to be religiously sworn.

The fifth and last reason is, that we can never make it appear, that
Episcopal government, Answer to the fifth reason.
at the first time of administering the oath was abolished; the very words of
that confession of Faith, immediately after the beginning of it being these:
Received, believed, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realms,
but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and three Estates of
this Realm, as Gods eternal truth, and only ground of our salvation.
Whereupon is inferred that Bishops, Abbots and Pryors, made up, at that time a
third Estate of this Realm, which gave approbation to the confession of Faith:
and therefore this third Estate did not abjure Episcopacie. And albeit it had
bin abolished by acts of Assembly, yet it was not so by act of Parliament, but
in force by many of them standing unrepealed, which are annexed to the reasons.
Which being the acts of a Monarch, and his three Estates, are never repealable
by any Ecclesiastical national Synod.

For answer hereunto, 1. It does appear and is manifest by the Registers and
acts of Assembly, that before the subscription of the Confession at the time
thereof, and thereafter: That Abbots, Priors, and Bishops were so clearly,
evidently, and expressly condemned in this Kirk, That the best wits of this age
opposers of Episcopacy cannot yet require one syllable to be added for farther
assurance, and the most able maintainers thereof could not pick any quarrel to
the clearness of the expression. 2. The clause citted in the reason, is only
anent the doctrine, and not anent the discipline, which thereafter is
determined and the Hierarchy detested: And the Discipline of the Kirk sworn
unto. 3. Albeit that clause were of discipline, yet it makes nothing for
Bishops except by inference, that they are comprehended under the name of the
third estate: which cannot be so understood, for collections by way of
inference or ex consequenti, cannot be adduced against the express acts of the
time: wherein the makers signify their minds in clear terms* and apertissime
dicendo, leaves no place to presume the contrare: especially in this kingdom,
where these expressions of stylus curiae are carefully observed without change:
which may be seen in the same case by many Parliaments: where it is But it is
most notorious that at those Parliaments which were holden when the confession
of faith was first sworn unto, Bishops had voices and were present, and so
then Episcopal government could not be abjured, for proof whereof We refer
the reader to the Parliament Roll inserted at the end of this answer.
not our that no Prelate was present, or allowed: and yet the acts proporting
to be made by his Majesty and three Estates are interpreted by the quoter as
made by the Prelates with others. 4. Episcopacie was abolished not only by acts
of Assembly, but there is no standing laws for Episcopal government, but some
against the same, as shall be evident in the answer made to the acts of
Parliament, subjoyned hereto: but if there be any Acts of Parliament standing
for Episcopacie, the Kings Majesty; his Commissioner, the Council, the
Collective-body of the Kingdom, has actually renunced the same by returning
to the doctrine and discipline, 1580. whereunto Episcopacie is contrare: which
God-willing may also be inacted at the next Parliament, proclaimed to be holden
by his Majesty in May 5. The acts of the Assembly, and the book of Policy in
the 1. and 10. chapter, puts clear merches betwixt civil and
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction; making every one independent in matters properly
belonging to their own judicatorie, and every one subject to the other in
matters properly belonging to that other. Let any kingdom which is acquainted
with Parliaments consisting of a Monarche and his three estates, digest this
proposition, and then the Parliament can be no more the highest Court of the
Kingdom.
So that as the Assembly cannot make civil laws nor repeal them, nor imped the
Parliament from making or repealing civil laws, no more can the Parliament
make Ecclesiastical laws originally, nor repeal, or hinder the lawful
Assemblies to repeal the same. For albeit acts of the Assembly are, and may be
ratified in Parliament, that is, only that the civil sanction may concur with
the Ecclesiastical constitution: But will not stop the Assembly to recall
their own act: which being adnulled by them, the A most false position: As if
the convocation in England, or the general Assembly in Scotland had power to
reconcile the two kingdoms to the Church of Rome, to reduce Popery into them,
and to restore to the Church all the Abbey lands, notwithstanding many Acts of
Parliaments in both kingdoms to the contrary.
civil ratification and sanction falls ex consequenti. For to maintain that the
Kirk may not repeal her own acts, ratified once in Parliament, is so
derogatorie to Christ's prerogative and ordinance, to the liberty of the Kirk,
and freedom of the Assembly, to the nature, end, and reason of all
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as we have more largely cleared in the
Protestation 22 September last) that we believe few or none will be of that
opinion. All these Five objections and many more was agitate and discussed in
the Assembly, before the act anent Episcopacie was made.

And seeing the general Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, Conclusion.
indicted by his Majesty now holden at Glasgow, which is the only Judge
competent and fit interpreter to remove and explain all doubts, arising upon
the confession of Faith, has after long, religious and mature declaration,
exponed the same, and clearly found that Episcopal government in this Kirk,
amongst other corruptions, is abjured by the confession of Faith, as the same
was professed within this Kingdom, has discharged all subscription to the
Covenant, subscribed and interpreted by his Majesty's Commissioner, has
commanded the Covenant subscribed in Februare with the application to be now
subscribed according to her present determination: therefore we trust that the
knowledge hereof, will be a sufficient warning to all good Christians and
Patriots, that they subscribe not the one, and that they subscribe the other,
according to the genuine and true meaning thereof, declared by the Kirk
allennerly, and of no contrary incompatible sense, as they would eshew the
crime and danger of a contradictory oath, and we would most humbly and
earnestly beg of his Sacred Majesty, from the bottom of our hearts, that his
Majesty would be graciously pleased to command, that the same may be so
subscribed, conform to the declared explanation of the Kirk; which would prove
the greatest happiness and joy that ever befell these disconsolated Subjects
of this nation, who (though unjustly branded with many calumnies) yet never
have, nor ever shall swerve from our loyalty due to the Lords anointed: But
would readily embrace any occasion to employ our lives and fortunes for his
Majesty's service and honor: who (we heartily pray God) may long and happily
ring over us.

Anent acts of Parliament.
For the cavils here made against the Acts of Parliament, cited in the
explanation, they will be sufficiently confuted, if the reader will take the
pains to read the acts; for then he shall easily discover that these
exceptions are not only weak, but none at all.
There is annexed to this Declaration a quotation of sundry acts of Parliament,
to prove that Episcopal government was not abolished in the year 1580.
whereunto albeit there is no necessity of answer, seeing the meaning of the
Kirk of Scotland in her Confession of Faith is only to be sought from her
self, and the registers of her Assemblies, and not from the Parliament, yet the
same shall be specially answered in the order that they are alleged: after
these two generals are offered to the Reader his consideration. 1. After the
reformation of this Kingdom, the Kirk was still wrestling against all
corruptions, and especially against Episcopacie. But though they clearly and
frequently condemned the same, yet the power of the enemies of reformation
withstood them long: so that her own policy could not be obtained ratified
expressly and specifice in Parliament, till the year of God 1592. which
abrogateth all those proceeding acts, alleged in the contrare. 2. That acts of
Parliament can no more make Ecclesiastical offices, nor give Ecclesiastical
privileges, nor the acts of Assembly can establish civil offices of Estate,
or grant to them civil privileges; each Judicatorie being properly confined
within their own spheres.

But before the acts of Parliament be particularly marked and cited, Answer to
the acts 1567.
there be two reasons prefixed: the one taken from some acts of Parliament
1567. cap. 2.3.6. and cap. 68. Par. 1579. The other from the oath ministered to
the King, at his coronation, for the act of Parliament 1567. Bearing that no
Bishop nor other Prelate in this Realm, use any jurisdiction in time coming
by the Bishop of Romes authority, It is evident hereby that Episcopacy is
altogether condemned, as all other Prelacie was: for before that time they had
no jurisdiction but from the Pope: and therefore being discharged to execute
that; they are discharged by the act to execute any at all. That this is the
true meaning and scope of that act is manifest: because the Kirk in the book of
common order, and in the first book of discipline at that same time,
acknowledges no other ordinary office bearers appointed by Christ in Ecclesia
constituta. But the Pastor, Doctor, Elder and Deacon: and in her Assemblies at
that same time, was still censuring these who were called or designed Bishops
by reason of their benefices, as is instructed by the acts printed before the
book of discipline. And therefore in the act of Council, 1560. made in the
same year by these same persons, ratifying the first book of discipline, they
provided only that Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, etc. Being protestants, brook their
revenewes during their life-times: they sustaining Ministers in the mean time.
2. In the year 1566. which precedes that Parliament, the Kirk of this Kingdom
approved the Confession of Helvetia; wherein the parity of Ministers is
preferred as Gods ordinance warranded by his word, to Episcopacy, as an humane
consuetude. 3. Because at that time the Queen had restored the Archbishop of
S. Andrews; therefore the Kirk supplicated the Nobility of the Kingdom,
against that restitution, which they condemn as the curing of the head of the
beast once wounded within this land. Wherein they expressly ground themselves
upon the said act of Parliament being before made in the year 1560. as a
certain abrogation of the Archbishops authority. 4. In the 2. book of
discipline chap. 11. the Kirk uses the same act of Parliament as an abrogation
of the Papisticall Kirk, and Papisticall jurisdiction, and thereby of
Episcopal jurisdiction and power. 5. The Kirk thereafter in the same chapter
declares their uniformity of this meaning by urging the act of Parliament,
1567. printed amongst the black acts and renewed in the Parliament holden 1579.
(which immediately follows the act here cited) declaring that no other
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction shall be used within this Realm, but that which
is and shall be in the reformed Kirk and flows therefrom: and they urge that
none under the abused titles in Papistry, of Prelates, etc. attempt to claim
the benefit of any act of Parliament, having no commission of the reformed
Kirk within this Realm. Whereby our Kirk declared all Episcopal jurisdiction
to be Papisticall. Which is the true meaning of the word, his Hirarchie in the
short confession. For their jurisdiction could flow from none other but from
the Pope: Seeing it flows not from the Kirk: but was abolished and condemned by
them: as is clear by the Registers of the Assembly. 6. The acts do abolish
all Papisticall jurisdiction: And therefore all Episcopal jurisdiction,
because Episcopal policy and jurisdiction is Papisticall: as is acknowledged
by many, and specially by Doctor Poklingtun Chaplain to the Bishop of
Canterbury: who deduceth a continual lineall succession from Peter through the
whole Popes, unto the present Arch bishop of Canterbury: and by the quotter
himself, who alleges (albeit falsely) that this Kirk retained the Papisticall
Policy and government. 6. Where it is said in the reason; that our Kirk did not
innovate any thing in that Policy which they found in the Kirk before the
reformation: the same is controlled by the book of Common prayer, first book of
Discipline, and acts of the Assemblies.

Anent the sixth act 1567
And for the 6. act 1567. and the 68. act 1579. The same does not only not
mention Bishops, but declares the true Kirk to consist only of Ministers of
the Gospel then living, and these who thereafter should rise; agreeing with
them, in doctrine and administration of the Sacraments, and the people, as the
members thereof, which directly excludes Bishops: against whom the doctrine
and practice of this Kirk, continually sounded: especially at that time. For in
the government of this Kirk by weekly meeting of Ministers, Elders, and
reformed towns from the year 1560. to the year 1576. (except the interim of
the pretended convention at Leeth 1572.) and from the year 1575. to the year
1581. The Assemblies for the most part were employed in abolishing the
corruptions of Episcopacy, and in establishing the settled Policy: which was
agreed upon, 1578. In the second book of Discipline. In the which acts of
Assembly and book of Discipline is set down at large the doctrine of the Kirk
of Scotland, anent that discipline, as grounded and well warranded in the word
of God, and against Episcopal jurisdiction, as an unlawful humane invention:
So that Episcopacy being contrary to the doctrine of the Kirk of Scotland,
1579. The Bishops disagreeing from the Ministers of the Evangel then living, in
doctrine and in the use and administration of the Sacraments, are declared by
the said acts to be no members of this Kirk, and the same acts cited for them
do sufficiently evince that Episcopacy was still condemned, notwithstanding
all opposition made in the contrare.

As for the Kings oath, the same contains no mention of Bishops, but by the
contrary, Anent the Kings oath.
the King is obliged thereby to maintain the true Religion of Jesus Christ,
the preaching of his holy word, and right administration of the Sacraments,
then received and preached within this Realm. And seeing it is cleared by the
preceding relation, that Bishops were never allowed, but oppugned by the Kirk
of Scotland, that oath does not allow, but exclude Episcopacy which is also
more perspicuous in the short confession 1580. and 1581. when the Kirk set
down her constant policy in Doctrine and Discipline grounded upon the word of
God, wherein the Hierarchy is abjured as contrary thereto; and craved an oath
from his Majesty for maintenance thereof, which now also our gracious Sovereign
in the judgment of the Kirk of Scotland is obliged to maintain, as being
founded upon the word of God, and exclusive of Episcopacie as repugnant
thereto. The acts of Parliament thereafter particularly cited are these
mentioned in order.

The 24. act 1567. ratifying all civil privileges formerly granted to the
spiritual estate, and the 35. act 1571. Ratifying all acts made anent the
freedom, and liberty of the true Kirk: the same cannot be extended to the
establishing of Episcopacy because it is not mentioned in these acts, but by
the contrary was abolished by the acts of the Assembly and Parliament, before
mentioned, so that the privileges therein mentioned, are granted to such
Kirk-men as then were received by the Kirk and Kingdom: and the freedom of
the Kirk must be interpret by her own judgment: who thought ever Episcopal
jurisdiction an heavy bondage: and yet those privileges can infer no
spiritual jurisdiction, but only civil privileges; some immunities and
extemptions granted for the goods and persons of Kirk-men as is clear, 1. act
James 1. Par. 1. and 26, act Par. 2. James 1. and 4. act Par. 3. James 2. with
many others.

It is here to be observed, that the careful evolver of these acts of
Parliament, has omitted to cite the 7. act 1. Parliament of King James 6.
bearing the examination and admission of Ministers, to be only in the power of
the Kirk, then openly and publicly professed; and presentations to be made to
Superintendents, or others having commission from the Kirk, and appealeth from
them, to the Superintendents and ministers of the Province, and appealleth from
these to the general Assembly: in all which gradations no mention of Bishops;
but they in effect excluded by that contrare distinction of the Kirk then
openly professed: because they were discharged by the foresaid second act 1567.
and Superintendents were then permitted like temporary Evangelists for the
present necessity, declared in the first book of discipline ad ecclesiam
constituendam; but was abrogate from 1575. that the constant Policy of
Ecclesia constituta began to be established.

As for the acts of Parliament, 1572. and 1573. It is known by the records of
the time, Anent the acts 1572. and 1573.
that the Regent then labored hard to bring in Archbishops, and Bishops, who
were not dead, but standing de facto provided to the power of these titulars of
benefices, to fortify his own designs, and counter-ballance the authority of
Ministers, pressing the purity of reformation: and so cannot be honorably
alleged for the Bishops at this time: and yet it was done not by authority,
but by warrant of some Ministers of his own party conveened at Leeth: and was
only done for an interim, and protested against by the next Assembly; and yet
nevertheless by the said acts of Parliament, the Archbishops, Bishops,
Superintendents, or Commissioners of Dioces or Provinces, are joined together
(which is wrongously omitted in the quotation) to show that no Archbishop or
Bishop, quatales had any power, but only being de facto standing provided in
the title, they were capable of a Commission from the Kirk, which sometimes
they obtained, and in the book of Assembly are named such as are called
Bishops, and were under the Discipline of the Kirk: and in the same
Superintendents possessours and titulars of prelacies, as well as Archbishops
and Bishops, are ordained to be called and conveened for that effect before the
general Assembly of the Kirk: And yet none can say, That the offices of
Abbots, Pryors, etc. were then retained; howbeit the benefices were not
extinct; and few ill grant that when the Archbishops and Bishops office was in
vigor, they thought themselves subject to the general Assembly: as they are
by the said act which is also fraudfully omitted in the quotation.

Anent the acts 1578. and 1579
As for the acts of Parliament 1578. and 1579. It is answered that the Kirk in
this mean time, from the year 1575. was busied in abrogating Episcopacy, and
establishing the constant policy, as is clear by the printed acts of Assembly
before the book of Discipline, and unprinted acts of Parliament: The Kirk by
her Commissioners daily reasoning and agreeing with the Kings Majesty and his
Commissioners upon these heads of policy, whereupon the Parliament, by the
said 69. act 1579. declares there is none other jurisdiction ecclesiastical
to be acknowledged, but that which is in this reformed Kirk, and flows
therefrom, which extinguisheth Episcopacy; because it does not flow from this
reformed Kirk: neither can produce its chartor from her: for besides that it
was abolished by the foresaid acts 1567. It was condemned also in the book of
Policy, and in the general Assembly holden at Dundie, 1580. and their whole
estate spiritual, and temporal condemned in the Assembly at Glasgow, 1581.
and so acknowledged by his Majesty's Commissioner in the Assembly at Edinburgh,
1581. so that by this act of Parliam. 1579. The Bishops are so abolished, that
unless they be established by lawful Assemblies of the Kirk, no act of
Parliament since sen can conduce for their establishment: seeing this act with
the other acts for their abolition, stands yet unrepealed. And farther for
the act of Parliament, 1578. if the same contribute any thing, for Episcopacy,
it must either be because Bishops are there mentioned, or for the power thereby
conferred upon them: But both these are weak grounds. The first because there
is no Bishop there named, but such as stood provided de facto on life: which is
an designation of the benefice, which was not then extinct; and not of the
office which was extinct. The power conferred upon them by the said act can
give no strength to the argument: because there is no jurisdiction granted
thereby to them, but only power to visit Hospitalls: which the Parliam. might
have granted to any person: but was most proper to these idle titulars of
benefices, who might best attend the same, or employ means for their
reparation. And this charge is likewise communicate by act of Parliament to all
Chancellours of this Kingdom for the time being: And as to the 71. act 1579.
we repeat the former answers that Superintendents and Commissioners are there
joined with the Bishops; to show that no power is granted unto them as Bishops,
but Commissioners from the Kirk, and the name is still used, because the
benefice was not extinct, but they were known by that appellation.

The acts of Parliament 1581. were better alleged for Assemblies then Bishops,
Anent the act 1581.
for it is an express ratification of the former acts of abolition of Bishops,
and abrogation of all acts or constitutions, cannons civil or municipall
contrare to the Religion then presently professed within this kingdom: which is
not only clearly expressed in the words: but if they were doubtsome (as they are
not) were manifest for these reasons. First, the Assembly holden at Edinburgh,
about the very same day, honored with the presence of his Majesty's
Commissioner, is acknowledged by him to have condemned Episcopacy whereunto
temporal jurisdiction is annexed: and the Assembly declaring that function to
be against the word of God and acts of the Kirk, thereupon did supplicat the
Parliament, that they should make no acts repugnant to the word of God,
especially concerning Bishops. Secondly, the King and Estates by that act
ratifieth all acts made for maintenance of the liberty of the true Kirk of
God, presently professed within this Realm and purity thereof: which present
profession can be no other, then that which was received by the Kirk and
Assembly then presently sitting so near the Parliament at Edinburgh, which had
approven the Presbyteriall government, condemned the Episcopal, and ratified
the short confession simul and semel, wherein the Estates had sworn to the
Presbyteriall and abjured Episcopal government. Thirdly, this ratification of
the former acts of Parliament must be interpreted, according to the words
thereof, to be in all points, which are not prejudicial to that purity of
Religion and liberty of the Kirk presently professed within this Realm. And at
this time the whole Estates had subscribed the short Confession and so sworn to
the discipline, set down in the book of discipline, which by this act is
ratified in the first place, before any special enumeration of particular
acts. Fourthly, it has been formerly shown that in the preceding acts of
Parliament where Archbishops or Bishops are named, the same has been by
reason of their benefice, and not their office: which the Parliament could not
give them being abrogate by Assembly: or having intended really to give them
any place, would not have joined Superintendents and other Commissioners with
them: or otherwise they are named as having equal power with the
Superintendents and other Commissioners, as in the convention at Leeth; and
conform to the time, especially 1572. and 1573. Wherein some titulars or
possessors of prelacies, so called in the 46. act of the Parliament 1572. had a
commission from the Kirk like unto Superintendents, which was not fully
abrogate until 1580. But all this was without prejudice of the Kirk her
liberty, to recall her own commission from these who were provided to
prelacies; and to condemn their Episcopal offices, whereunto they ascrived
the power; which they really had by their commission: as the Kirk did upon good
reasons abrogate the office of Superintendents without impunging of the said
acts of Parliament (which were never rescinded till 1592.) whereby it is
evident, that though this act of Parliament 1581. ratify the former acts
wherein Arch bishops, Bishops, Superintendents, or other Commissioners of the
Kirk are named, yet seeing the said acts are alternative conceived, the vigor
and efficacy thereof subsists by this ratification in the last alternative;
viz. Commissioners from the Kirk, Dyoces or Province: seeing the remanent were
formerly condemned: especially by this Assembly of Edinburgh holden the time of
the Parliament. Fifthly, this ratification 1581. of the former acts made in
favors of the true Religion repeating only the titles of these acts and not
themselves, cannot import any corroboration of the offices under the titles
mentioned in these former acts: because this ratification, can only be extended
to the matter, and not to the designation of the persons, expressed in the former
acts, which is only personal and circumstantiall, as for instance, this act
1581. could not confer any power or employment upon Superintendents: because
that office was then abrogate; and out of the Kirk. But the true meaning of the
act is; that ratifying the substance and matter in favors of the Kirk and
Religion, it does entrust the execution to these whom the Kirk shall lawfully
authorize with commission for that end, which is more manifest in the 114. act
Par. 12. 1592. wherein this act 1581. and all the acts therein contained are
ratified quoad materiam: and yet all Archbishops and Commissioners are
discharged and all Ecclesiastical matters subjected to Presbyteries. Sixthly,
it cannot probably agree with reason that by this ratification the Parliament,
above their power would endevoure to establish in the Kirk any function so
recently condemned of before by the Assemblies at Dundie 1580. and at Glasgow
and Edinburgh, 1581. immediately before this Parliament.

The acts of Parliament 1584. are of several natures. But they were protested
against, Anent the act 1584. and the third Estate of Parliament.
by the Ministers of Edinburgh in the name of the Kirk of Scotland, at the
mercate cross of Edinburgh, when they were proclaimed and as they were made in
that time which was called the hour of darkness in this Kirk, tirrannized by
the Earl of Arran, so are they expressly repealed 1592. cap. 114.

Anent the act of Parliament 1584. For the three Estates, and so forth. To
answer: Primo, that the Kirk from the year of God 1580, 1581. that the
Confession was subscribed, unto the year 1597. all this time was by continual
acts condemning the office of Bishops, their spiritual, their temporal, their
whole estate, their confusion of civil and Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
craving in Council and Parliament the dissolution of Prelacies and the
erection of Presbyteries.

2. De facto the former Bishops being continually processed and sentenced by
the Kirk, these who presumed to usurp that office condemned by the Kirk, namely
Mr. Patrick Adamson, and Mr. Robert Mountgomrie in the year 1582. 1584. 1586.
they were deprived and excommunicate by this Kirk before the Parliament, 1587.

3. De facto no Ecclesiastical Bishop voted in Parliament but Mountgomry and
Adamson, who were taken in by the Earl of Arran, unto the Parliament holden in
May at Edinburgh 1584. Wherein the three Estates ratifieth the honor and
dignity of the three Estates, so that as these two Bishops cannot be called the
third Estate which does ratify, so the Estate of Bishops, cannot be called the
third Estate, which is ratified: especially seeing by that same Parliament in
the 132. act. Bishops of the Diocie are but nominate the Kings Commissioners.
And in the last act of that same Parliament, printed of old in black letter,
there is set down the Kings Commission granted to the said pretended Bishop
Adamson.

4. From 1581. till the year 1597. the quoter does not eite nor can cite any
act of Parliament expressly nominating any ecclesiastical Bishop, but that in
the 1584. wherein he is named as one amongst other the Kings Commissioners,
whereof some were mere secular persons.

5. It is clear by the first act of the ninth Parliament 1584. and the
eleventh act of the 10. Parliament 1585. that Bishoprics, Prelacies, Abbacies,
Priories, Nunries, were then thought to be alike in the Kings hands, were
granted to whatsoever persons being his subjects, albeit they brooked no office
in the Kirk: so that some of these lordships and Baronies were erected before
1587. and excluded from the annexation.

6. As the Kirk had ever been craving the dissolution of Prelacies, and
condemning the temporal as well as the spiritual estate of Bishops, by their
act of the Assembly 1581. and by their censure of the Presbytery of Striviling
for admitting Montgomrie to the temporality of the Bishopric of Glasgow, and
censure of Mountgomrie for aspyring thereto, contrare to the word of God and
acts of the Kirk in the Assembly 1587. Iuni. So in the 11. Parl. of King James
the sixth 29. of July 1587. 29. act. The three Estates of Parliament annexeth to
the crown, all Lordships and Barronies pertaining to whatsoever, Archbishops,
or Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, Nuns, and Munkes: reserving always to
Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, Pryoresses, commendators, and others
possessours of great Benefices of the estate of Prelates, and which before had
or has vote in Parliament, the principal Castles and Fortalices: whereby it
is clear, that the stylus curiae naming three Estates did no ways include
Ministers being Bishops: seeing no ecclesiastical Bishops, sat in that
Parliament, nor could sit: because the only two Bishops of the time Adamson and
Montgomery, were before deprived and excommunicat, and certainly they neither
would nor could have sitten as an Estate in Parliament to abrogate their own
estate and lordships, and temporal land, whereupon that act acknowledges any
right they had, did depend. 2. It is clear that Archbishops or Bishops,
Abbots, Pryors, etc. all alike voted in Parliament of old, not by reason of
their ecclesiastical office, but by reason of their great benefices and
lordships: which here is said to have had vote in Parliament: for that cannot
be relative to the persons, as unto Pryoresses: but unto the benefices. So that
Ministers voted not as Ministers in name of the Kirk, but as possessours of
these great benefices or Baronies: and others who were not Ecclesiastical
persons being titulars, and possessours of these great benefices both communi
styl^ were called Bishops, Abbots, etc. by virtue of the benefice without any
office, in the rolls of Parliament, and in the act of Assembly 1587. The
Bishopric of Cathnes is said to vaike by decease of Robert Earl of March, the
Kings Uncle: And the Assembly in their letter to the King declares, to be
against the word of God and acts of the Kirk, to present and admit any Minister
to that Bishopric, as also some of these titulars, and possessours of the
benefices, albeit they had no ecclesiastical office, did some times ride and
vote in parliament. 3. It is clear that the three Estates by taking away from
Archbishops, and Bishops, their Lordships Barronies, and temporal lands, they
took away their vote in parliament, which does not subsist, but in and by the
benefice, and therefore ecclesiastical persons separat to the Gospel for want
of their great benefices, had no vote in parliament, till the 1597. (albeit all
the interveened acts are made by the three Estates,) wherein the Kings Majesty
restores Ministers to the titles and dignities of Prelacies, which shows
that before they were disponed to others then Ministers; and provideth that
Ministers presented to these titles and dignities, and to the benefice of
Bishoprics, shall have vote in parliament; which shows that the benefice and
not the office gives right to vote in parliament, like as the very act of
parliament 1606. acknowledges, that by the act of annexation of the
temporality of benefice to the Crown 1587. the estate of Bishops were
indirectly abolished; and therefore they behoved to rescind the act of
annexation anent the benefice, and restore them to these titles and dignities,
before Ministers could vote in parliament, but these acts also are hereafter
answered. 7. But as for 130. act 1584. no Bishop is therein mentioned; and yet
it is adduced for Bishops, because the three estates are therein named, under
one of which the Prelate claims to be comprehended, but why more he then
Abbots, and Pry^rs formerly abolished, as well as Episcopacy? why more by that
act, then many former made when Bishops neither rode, sat, nor voted in
parliament; but were expugned out of this Kirk, and yet the acts were all made
by the three estates, which albeit it needs none other demonstration then
that it is stylus curiae, carefully observed in this Kingdom; Yet the truth
is, that the Nobility, Barrons, and Burrows were the three estates of this
Kingdom, many hundred years after Christianity, before any Bishops was in
this Kingdom, as is observed by Buchanan and Boethius, and acknowledged by
Lesly in his Chronicles; and after the Bishops were abrogate expressly the three
estates of parliament did continue, and make all acts of parliament. Yea, after
the 1592. where Bishops were discharged, for if Bishops were an estate, there
behoved to be four estates of parliament; as there are so many named in the
Commission granted by King JAMES, and King CHARLES, viz. The Clargie, Nobility,
Barons, and Borrows, and that as ecclesiastical persons separate to the
Gospel, since the reformation, were never warranted to voice in Parliament,
while 1597. So on the other part, the Barons are, and have been, as an estate
of parliament in uncontravered possession of voting in parliament, conform to
the 101. act Parl. 7. King JAMES the first, renewed again in the parliament
1585. and 1587. act 113. wherein precepts of the Chancelary are ordained to be
directed to the Barons as unto an Estate of parliament: even as they shall be
direct unto other Estates, to wit, The Nobility and Borrows; which in that act
is mentioned. So in this same act of parliament (which in the narrative
relates the bygone great decay of the ecclesiastical Estate) There are
expressed three complete Estates in Parliament, The Nobility, Barrons, and
Borrows. And as in law the three Estates are entire without Bishops or
Ministers voters in Parliament, So also, it is most expedient, and necessar for
the liberty of the Kirk, honor of the King, and peace of this kingdom: That
no Ministers vote in Parliament, as is more clearly and largely proved in the
reasons of the protestation, given into Parliament against the same, 1606. And
in the act of this Assembly against civil places of Kirk-men.

As for the 131. act 1584. no Bishop is therein mentioned to get any benefit
thereby, and far less can the same reach to the prejudice of the late
Assembly, which was indicted by his Majesty, and is an ordinare judicatory
allowed by the laws of God and man: like as it is answered in our
protestation, more largely.

And for the 132. and 133. act of the said Parliament 1584. there is no
Ecclesiastical privilege or authority thereby granted to Bishops as Bishops;
but only a power of cognition: wherein the Parliament has joined others the
Kings Commissioners with them, only as the Kings Commissioners: and granted the
same unto seculare persons with them: but the King could never provide them to
the office and jurisdiction of Bishops, which was abolished by many acts of
Parliament and Assemblies before written.

The 23. act 1587. works directly against Bishops: Anent the act 1587.
being a general ratification of all acts formerly made anent the religion
presently professed in this kingdom: which must include the acts abolishing
Episcopacy; but especially, seeing in the same Parliament 1587. temporal
livings are taken from the Bishops, as well as the office was 1567. And the
same act undoubtedly was granted in the same meaning, wherein the Kirk did
crave it; who that same year had often condemned Episcopal government, as
contraire to Gods word, and the liberty of the Kirk, and approved Presbyteriall
government, as flowing from the pure fountain of Gods word.

It falls in here to be remarked that the act 114. anno 1592. is never
alleged: Anent the act 1592.
and that because it not only revocks in particular the foresaid acts 1584. but
in general all other acts contrary to that discipline then established, and in
particulare, the Assemblies, Presbyteries and Synods* with the discipline and
jurisdiction of this Kirk, are ratified and established, as most just and
Godly, notwithstanding whatsoever statutes, acts, cannons, civil or municipall
laws made in the contrare: whereunto his Majesty's prerogative is declared to
be no ways prejudicial. Further the said act abrogates all acts granting
commission to Bishops, and other Judges constitute in Ecclesiastical causes;
and ordains presentation to benefices to be direct to Presbyteries, with
power to give collation thereupon: And so contains a ratification of the
heads of Policy set down in the second book of discipline. Which act is
renewed act 60. anno 1593. and the power of Presbyteries acknowledged 1594. act
129. and was never rescinded expressly in totum; but only in part by the
ratification of the act of Glasgow. Which now cannot be respected; but falls
ex consequenti: seeing that Assembly of Glasgow is now upon just and infallible
reasons declared to have been null ab initio: and so this act of Parliament,
wisely omitted by the collecter to the Commisioners grace might serve alone,
without our preceding special answers, for clearing the whole preceding acts.

The 23. act 1597. grants the privilege of a voice in Parliament to the
whole Kirk; Anent the acts 1597.
and under that name to Abbots, or other persons provided to prelacies, as well
as Bishops: even as in time of papistry. So as Sir Robert Spottiswood, Abbot of
New-abbay road thereafter in Parliament: which was both unwarrantable and
unusual. Which does nothing contribute for the Bishops advantage, because
albeit the benefice was not extinct, yet neither the King nor the Parliament
might give them the office so often condemned by this Kirk: which is also
acknowledged in the same act; because after the granting to them of the said
voice, the Parliament remitteth them to the King and the Assembly, concerning
their office in their spiritual policy and government in the Kirk. 2. The said
act bears expressly to be but prejudice of the jurisdiction and discipline of
the Kirk, established by acts of Parliament made in any time preceding, and
permitted by the said acts to all provincial and general Assemblies, and
other whatsoever Presbyteries and Sessions of the Kirk: and so the same cannot
derogate from the former acts ratifying the present discipline of the Kirk,
especially the said act 1592. nor yet from the acts of the Assembly abjuring
Episcopacy. 3. The privilege is granted upon condition they be actual Pastors
and Ministers. And so we refer to the world and themselves, if with good
consciences they may claim the benefice of that act. 4. That privilege was
obtruded, and pretended to be introduced in favors of the Kirk: who may and
has renounced the same, as being incompatible with their spiritual function:
as the act of the Assembly at more length bears, upon undeniable reasons. 5.
When voice in Parliament was first plausible obtruded upon the Kirk, it was
neither proponed nor tolerated in other terms then that only such should
have vote in Parliament, as had Commissiom from the Kirk. So that not as
Bishops, but as Ministers, Commissioners from the Kirk, they had vote in
Parliament. Like as the Assembly at Montrose, 1600. being so hardly pressed by
authority, that they could not get it altogether refused (albeit in their
conference at Haly-rud-house, 1599. they proponed unanswerable reasons against
this, and all other civil places of pastors) set down cautions, binding the
Ministers voters in Parliament, to be insert in the act of parliament
subsequent: which was omitted notwithstanding of the Bishops oath and duty in
the contrare; for the breach whereof they are now most justly censured. 6. The
ratificatory acts of the privileges of the Kirk and Discipline thereof then
professed, are not thereby abrogate, but notwithstanding thereof must stand in
force, because it is ever understood, and frequently provided in Parliament,
that all acts thereof are made salvo jure cujuslibe^; far more salvo jure
ecclesiae and sponsae Christi, when she is robbed of her right without
audience: especially seeing her right, is usually ratified in the first act of
every Parliament. 7. Albeit it were granted, that by this Act of Parliament, or
any whatsoever the Prelates had voice in Parliament, yet that does not exeime
them from Ecclesiastic censure, nor forefault the Kirks right, whereby she may
condemn them for their transgressions: as now this Assembly most justly has
done, for by their own caveats, whosoever is ecclesiastically censured by
Presbyteries and provincial Assemblies, ipso facto loses his benefice and
vote in Parliament. 8. Further the Bishops in their declinatour profess they
never had commission from this Kirk to voice for her in Parliament, according
to the cautions set down in the Assembly at Montrose: for the which cautions
that Assembly was never challenged, as trenching upon the third estate.

The act of parliament 1606. is coincident with the nature of the preceding
acts, Anent the act 1606.
for albeit the King and parliament might have reponed them to their rents,
teends, lands, etc. which were annexed to the Crown; yea, might have disponed
to them any part of the patrimony of the Crown, If lordly titles and civil
places in the persons of pastors separat to the Gospel, had been lawful, yet
could not give them the spiritual office, and jurisdiction spiritual, which
was abolished and abjured by many preceding acts of Assembly and parliament
forecited. Et quod illud tantum agebatur, is evident by the whole strain of
the act, reponing them, for remeed of their contempt and poverty to their
dignities, privileges, livings, rents, lands, and teinds: and this always
limited, as was competent to them, since the reformation of Religion in the
reformed Kirk: From which time their office and jurisdiction spiritual was
always extinct. Which is evidently acknowledged in the act of Parliament 1592.
and expressly in the act of parliament 1597. granting voice in parliament to
Ministers. Which albeit it was the first step to Episcopacy, yet the parliament
thereby has remitted the office of Bishops in their spiritual policy and
government (as not pertaining to their civil place and jurisdiction) to the
King and the general Assembly of Ministers, as properly belonging to them, but
prejudice always of the jurisdiction and discipline of the Kirk, permitted by
many acts of Parliament, (whereof that 1592. forecited is one) to general
provincial Assemblies, Presbyteries and Sessions of the Kirk, which were never
prejudged neither by the act 1606. nor by the act 1609. albeit corruption was
then fast advancing; till the year 1612. at which time first, and never
before, the King and Estates had taken the advice of the pretended Assembly at
Glasgow, anent their office and spiritual jurisdiction formerly remitted to
them; as is clear in the act of Parliament 1612. relative to that remit in the
Parliament 1597. which for that cause is also omitted by the quotter.

Like as also the act of parliament 1609. restores them only to temporal
jurisdiction, Anent the act 1609.
and privileges, lawfully pertaining to them and flowing from his Majesty, as
any other ordinare jurisdiction does; with reservation of the Kings supremacy
and prerogative therein; which can no ways comprehend their ecclesiastical
office, because the same is not a temporal jurisdiction, neither did lawfully
pertain to them, but by the law of God, and acts of this Kirk after
reformation; and by the act 1592. was abrogat and taken from them; and the
ecclesiastical power established in presbyteries. So that if it be an
ecclesiastical office, it cannot flow from the King, who cannot make a
Minister, Doctor, Elder or Deacon in the Kirk; albeit he may present a
Minister made by the KING of Kings to the Kirk; neither can the parliament
institute originally any ecclesiastical office in the Kirk, as is before said.
Further the intended scope of that act is only the restitution of Commissariats
and temporal jurisdiction flowing from his Majesty; as is clear by the act it
self, bearing that they shall brook all privileges and jurisdictions granted
to them by his Majesty, and redintegrates them to their former authority and
jurisdiction, lawfully pertaining to them, always flowing from his Majesty
(from whom only temporal jurisdiction does flow) which is only the
jurisdiction of Commissers in temporal causes, and no ways any spiritual
jurisdiction competent ratione officii: which by Gods word and the laws of the
Kingdom was abjured in them, and established in assemblies, presbyteries, etc.
as is many times before repeated. But to convince them further it is not or
that both 1606, and 1609. they road in Parliament, and by their own voices and
the iniquity of the time, made the said acts without inserting the cautions
made at Montrose, without any commission from the Kirk, contraire to the said
cautions and their own oath given for observance thereof, against which the
Kirk of Scotland did protest solemnly, clearing unanswerably, not only the
unlawfullnesse of their Ecclesiastic Episcopal function; but also of the
civil places in persons of Pastors, from Gods word, our confession of Faith,
1580. acts of this Kirk and Kingdom; but this protestation being rejected by
them was printed to the view of the world.

Anent the act 1617.
And as for the act of the Parliament 1617. it cannot set down consecration to
the office, without a preceding act of the Kirk: which is not alleged: but
by the contraire, the Kirk, had before condemned that office, and did
particularly protest against that act of Parliament. Moreover this act is
builded upon the supposed ground of Glasgow Assembly 1610. which for infallible
reasons is now annulled: and so not only this act 1617. but all after acts,
ratifying the same, fall ex consequenti; both by the light of reason, law and
practice of this Kingdom. For when the principal act or right ratified does
fall, the subsequent ratification falls eo ipso: especially in this case,
when civil laws in ecclesiastical matters, cannot be made originally, nor
subsist after the abolition of the ecclesiastical constitutions, which they
ordain under civil sanction to be obeyed: and yet being once annulled they
cannot be obeyed. And further even that corrupt Assembly of Glasgow 1610. which
is now declared to have been null ab initio, did never restore the office of a
diocesian Bishop before condemned in this Kirk; but did too far enlarge and
extend the power of these who were provided to the benefice of Bishops; and yet
always under cautions and limitations sworn unto: which they never observed;
and upon condition of their subjection for censure to yearly general
Assemblies: which they have not kept, but impeded, and so they ought not to
clame the benefice of these acts of Parliament concluded by their own voices,
and protested against by the Kirk of Scotland and violated by themselves.

And last, for answer to all acts of Parliament whatsoever, Conclusion.
let the Christian Reader consider, if, as the Assembly lately conveened by his
Majesty's indiction in the name of Jesus Christ, should judge (and has
proceeded) by the word of God alone; and not by acts of parliament: so we are
obliged by our oath made to God, to return to the doctrine and discipline of
this Kirk 1580. and renounce all subsequent acts contrary thereunto, and
prejudicial to the purity of reformation and the Kirk* in whose favors any
pretended privileges is granted, and that out of experience of real
prejudice, and the pungent sins of our oath and danger of perjury; under which
this Kingdom lies: for the which we ardently deprecate Gods wrath, and beg
mercy to every one of us who are guilty; and must still continue our earnest
and humble supplications to his Majesty for redress; as we shall do our
petitions to God, for preserving the sacred person of our dread Sovereign, and
perpetuating his reign and his Royal posterity over this land so long as the
world endures.

Revised according to the ordinance of the general Assembly, by me Mr. A.
Ihonston Clerk thereto.
Edinb. 14. of Feb. 1639.
BEcause the Reader shall not need to doubt of the vanity of all these
exceptions against the Acts of Parliament here cited, and of the impertinency
of their Citations of some Acts of Parliament to the contrary: We shall
demonstrate to the Reader, that when this Confession of Faith was first framed,
and enjoined to be subscribed; Episcopal government was then in force and
strength, which does appear by the most unquestionable and irrefragable Record
of that Kingdom, viz. The Books and Rolls of Parliament. And therefore We
have here caused to be inserted out of the Sederunt Rolls of Parliament, the
names of such Bishops as sat in Parliament, and represented the third Estate
since the Reformation, beginning no higher then the year 1579. In which the
Reader must note that the Abbots were secular men who had got the Abbey-lands,
but yet retained their names and places in Parliament.

ABout this time Our Commissioner resolved to ask Our leave for his return to
Us, seeing there was no good to be expected from Our fair and gracious
proceedings with them of the pretended Assembly, and wrote unto Us accordingly.
When he had received Our leave for his return, he hearing of the great
stirs which were now raised at Edinburgh, and the strong and great guards
which were since his leaving of Glasgow put upon Our Castle there, repaired
thither to Our Palace at Holy-rood-house, where he found the people of that
City horribly abused by the mis-reports of all the passages of the Assembly,
whilst he continued at Glasgow; especially with a false information that We had
there made good nothing of all which was contained in Our last gracious
Declaration made at Edinburgh the 22. of September last past: herewith he made
Us presently acquainted, which moved Us by a very speedy dispatch to command
him by Our Proclamation to make known to all Our subjects at Edinburgh, the
sum of his whole proceedings at Glasgow; which Our Commissioner presently
performed, by causing this Our ensuing Proclamation to be published at the
Market Cross of that Our City.

Charles R.

CHARLES by the grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland,
defender of the Faith.
To Our Lovits Maissars, Heralds, Pursevants, Our Sheriffs in that part
conjunctly and severally specially constitute, greeting.
Whereas for the removing of the disorders which had happened of late within
this Our Kingdom, and for settling of a prefect peace in the Church and
Commonwealth thereof, We were pleased to cause indict a free general
Assembly, to be holden at Glasgow the one and twentieth of November last: And
for Our subjects their better content and assurance that they should be freed
of all such things as by their petitions and supplications given in to the
Lords of Our Privy Council, they seemed to be grieved at, We in some sort
preveened the Assembly, by discharging by Our Proclamation the Service Book,
Book of Canons, and high Commission, freed and liberate Our subjects from the
practicing of the five Articles, eximed all Ministers at their entry from
giving any other oath then that which is contained in the act of Parliament,
made all persons both Ecclesiastical and Civil liable to the censure of
Parliament, general Assembly, or any other judicatorie competent, according to
the nature of their offense: had declared all bygone disorders absolutely
forgotten and forgiven: and last, for securing to all posterity the truth and
liberty of Religion, did command the Confession of Faith, and band for
maintenance thereof, and of authority in defense of the same, subscribed by
Our dear Father, and his household in anno 1580. to be renewed and subscribed
again by Our subjects here: And albeit that this Our gracious and pious
command, in stead of obedience and submission, rancountred open and public
opposition and protestation against the same: And that they continued their
daily and hourly guarding and watching Our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering
nothing to be imported therein, but at their discretion, stopping and impeding,
any importation of ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever to any of Our
houses within this Kingdom: Denying to Us their sovereign Lord that liberty
and freedom, which the meanest of them assume to themselves (an act without
precedent or example in the Christian world.) Like as they spared not boldly
and openly to continue their conventions and Council tables of Nobility,
Gentry, Ministers and Burgesses within the city of Edinburgh, where, not
regarding the laws of the Kingdom, without warrant of Authority, they
conveened, assembled, and treated upon matters, as well Ecclesiastical as
Civil, sent their injunctions and directions throughout the country to their
subordinate tables, and other under Ministers appointed by them for that
effect. And under color and pretext of Religion, exercing an unwarranted
liberty, required obedience to their unlawful and illegal directions, to the
seen prejudice of Authority, and lawful monarchical government. And
notwithstanding it was evidently manifest by the illegal and unformall course
taken in the election of the Commissioners for the Assembly, whereof some of
them were under the censure of this Church, some under the censure of the
Church of Ireland, some long since banished for open and avowed teaching
against Monarchy, others of them suspended, and some admitted to the
Ministry contrary to the form prescribed by the laws of this Kingdom;
others of them rebels, and at the Horn, some of them confined, and all of
them by oath and subscription bound to the overthrow of Episcopal Government.
And by this and other their underhand working, and private informations and
persuasions, have given just ground of suspicion of their partiality, and so
made themselves unfit judges of what concerns Episcopacie. And als albeit it
was sufficiently cleared by the peremptory and illegal procedures of the
Presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of Law, and without due form of
process, thrust out Moderatours lawfully established, and placed others whom
they found most inclinable to their turbulent humors, associate to themseves,
for choosing of the Commissioners to the Assembly, a Laick-Elder out of each
Parish, who being in most places equal, if not more in number then the
ministry, made choice both of the ministers, who should be Commissioners from
the Presbyteries, as also of a Laick-Elder, (which in time will prove to be of
a dangerous consequence, and import a heavy burden to the liberty of Church
and Churchmen) being more directed therein by the warrants of the foresaid
pretended Tables, then by their own judgments; as appeared by the several
instructions sent from them (far contrary to the Laws of this Country, and
lowable custom of this Church) some whereof were produced and exhibit by Our
Commissioner, and publikly read: One whereof, direct to the Noblemen and Barons
of each Presbytery, does among many other odd passages, require diligence,
lest (say they) by our own silliness and treachery we lose so fair an
occasion of our liberty both Christian and Civil; a strange phrase to proceed
from dutiful or loyal hearted subjects. The other to the Moderatours of the
several Presbyteries, under the title of Private Instructions, August 27.
first, contains that these private instructions shall be discovered to none,
but to brethren well affected to the cause: secondly, order must be taken, that
none be chosen ruling Elders but Covenanters, and those well affected to the
business: thirdly, that where the Minister is not well affected, the ruling
Elder be chosen by the Commissioners of the shire, and spoken to particularly
for that effect: fourthly, that they be careful that no Chappelmen,
chaptermen, or Minister justice of peace, be chosen, although Covenanters,
except they have publikly renounced, or declared the unlawfulness of their
places: fifthly, that the ruling Elders come from every Church, in equal
number with the Ministers; and if the Minister oppose, to put themselves in
possession, notwithstanding of any opposition: sixthly, that the Commissioner
of the shire cause conveen before him the ruling Elder of every Kirk chosen
before the day of the election, and enjoyne them upon their oath, that they
give vote to none but to those who are named already at the meeting at
Edinburgh: seventhly, that where there is a Nobleman in the bounds of the
Presbytery, he be chosen, and where there is none, there be chosen a Baron, or
one of the best quality, and he only a Covenanter: eighthly, that the ablest
man in every Presbytery be provided to dispute de potestate supremi
magistratus in Ecclesiasticis, praesertim in convocandis conciliis, etc.
Whereby it is most evident what prelimitations, indirect and partial courses,
and dangerous propositions have been used in the preparations and elections to
this pretended Assembly. By which unlawful doings, although We had sufficient
reason to have discharged the meeting of the said Assembly, yet We were pleased
patiently to attend the same, still hoping that when they were met together by
the presence of Our Commissioner, and assistance of some well affected
subjects, who were to be there, and by their own seeing the real performance of
what was promised by Our Proclamation, they should have bin induced to return
to the due obedience of subjects. But when We perceived that their turbulent
dispositions did increase, as was manifest by their repairing to the said
pretended Assembly with great troops and bands of men, all boddin in fear of
war, with guns, and Pistolets, contrary to the laws of this Kingdom, and in
high contempt of Our Proclamation at Edinburgh the 16. day of November. last: And
also by the peremptory refusing to the assessors, authorized by Us (although
fewer in number then Our dearest Father was in use to have) the power of voting
in this Assembly, as formerly they had done in all others, openly averring that
We, nor Our Commissioner, had no further power there then the meanest
Commissioner of their number: and by their partial and unjust refusing, and not
suffering to be read the reasons and arguments given in by the Bishops, and
their adherents to Our Commissioner, why they ought not to proceed to the
election of a Moderatour, neither yet to the trying and admitting of the
Commissioners, before they were heard, though in Our name they were earnestly
required thereto by Our Commissioner: and notwithstanding that Our Commissioner
by warrant from Us gave in under his hand a sufficient Declaration of all that
was contained in Our late Proclamation, bearing likewayes Our pleasure of the
registration of the same in the books of Assembly, for all assurance of the
truth and purity of Religion to all Our good subjects, as does clearly appear
by the declaration it self; whereof the tenor follows. The Kings Majesty being
informed that many of his good subjects have apprehended that by the
introducing of the Service Book, and Book of Canons, the inbringing of
Superstition has been intended, has been graciously pleased to discharge,
like as by these he does discharge the Service Book, and Book of Canons, and
the practice of them, and either of them, and annulls and rescinds all Acts of
Council, Proclamations, and other acts and deeds whatsoever, that have been
made or published for establishing them, or either of them, and declares the
same to be null, and to have no force nor effect in time coming. The Kings
Majesty, as he conceived, for the ease and benefit of the subject, established
the high Commission, that thereby justice might be administrate and the faults
and errors of such persons as are made liable thereto, taken order with, and
punished with the more conveniencie, and less trouble to the people. But
finding his gracious intention therein to be mistaken, has been pleased to
discharge, like as by these He does discharge the same, and all acts and deeds
whatsoever made for establishing thereof. And the Kings Majesty being informed,
that the urging of the five Articles of Perth Assembly has bred distraction in
the Church and State, has been graciously pleased to take the same into His
royal consideration, and, for the quiet and peace of this country, has not
only dispensed with the practice of the said articles, but also discharged
all and whatsoever persons from urging the practice thereof, upon either laicke
or ecclesiastical person whatsoever, and has freed all His subjects from all
censure and pains whether ecclesiastical or secular, for not urging,
practicing, or obeying them, or any of them, notwithstanding of any thing
contained in the Acts of Parliament, or general Assembly in the contrary. And
his Majesty is further contented, that the Assembly take the same so far to
their consideration, as to represent it to the next Parliament, there to be
ratified as the Estates shall find fitting. And because it has been
pretended, that oaths have been administrate different from that which is set
down in the acts of Parliament, his Majesty is pleased to declare by me, that
no other oath shall be required of any Minister at his entry, nor that which is
set down in the act of Parliament. And that it may appear how careful his
Majesty is that no corruption nor innovation shall creep into this Church,
neither yet any scandal, vice, or fault of any person whatsoever, censurable
or punishable by the Assembly; go along unpunished, his Majesty is content to
declare by me, and assure all His good people, that general Assemblies shall
be kept so often, and als often as the affairs of this Church shall require. And
that none of His good subjects may have cause of grievances against the
proceedings of the Prelates, his Majesty is content that all and every one of
the present Bishops, and their successors, shall be answerable, and
accordingly from time to time censurable, according to their merits by the
general Assembly. And to give all his Majesty's good people full assurance,
that He never intended to admit any alteration or change in the true Religion
professed within this Kingdom, and that they may be truly and fully satisfied
of the reality of His intentions and integrity of the same, his Majesty has
been pleased to require and command all His good subjects to subscribe the
Confession of Faith, and band for maintenance thereof, and of his Majesty's
person and Authority, formerly signed by His dear Father, in ann. 1580. and now
also requires all these of this present Assembly to subscribe the same. And it
is his Majesty's will, that this be insert and registrate in the books of
Assembly, as a testimony to posterity, not only of the sincerity of His
intentions to the said true Religion, but also of His resolutions to maintain
and defend the same, and His subjects in the profession thereof.

Which declaration was by Our special command and direction given in, and
subscribed by Our Commissioner, upon protestation made by him, that his
assenting to the registration hereof, should be no approbation of the
lawfulness of this Assembly, nor of any of the acts or deeds done, or to be
done therein. And finding them in like sort no ways to be satisfied therewith,
and that nothing else was able to give them contentment, except at their own
pleasure they were permitted to overthrow all Episcopal government in the
Church, and thereby to abrogate Our public laws standing in vigor by the
space of many years bygone, and to alter the fundamental government of this
kingdom, in taking away one of the three Estates, contrary to express acts of
Parliament: And lest the continuance of their meetings might have produced
other the like dangerous acts so derogatory to Royal authority, We were forced
for preveening thereof, and for the reasons and causes abovementioned, and
diverse others importing true monarchical government, to dissolve and break up
the said pretended Assembly, and to discharge them of all farther meeting,
treating and concluding any thing therein. And yet in that calm and peaceable
way, as Our Commissioner before his removing desired their pretended Moderator
for that time to have said prayer, and so concluded that days session, that so
they might have had time to think upon the just reasons of his refusing to
assist, or be any longer present at the said pretended Assembly, and of the
causes moving Us to the dissolving thereof: and notwithstanding his earnest
urging the same, and being willing to return the next morning to hear their
answer; in place of all other satisfaction to his so reasonable and moderate
desires, it was refused, and met with a protestation of an high and
extraordinary strain, thereby presuming to cite and call Our Council in
question, for their dutiful assistance and obedience to Us and Our
Commissioner. And finding their disobedience thus to increase, We were
constrained to discharge them of new again the next day thereafter, by public
proclamation, under the pain of treason. And albeit that their contumacie is
such as has not been heard of in former times, yet they shall never move Us to
alter the least point or article of that We have already declared by
proclamation, or declaration under Our Commissioners hand: All which was
publicly read, and by Our Commissioner required to be insert and registrate in
the books of Assembly, therein to remain as a testimony to posterity, not
only of the sincerity of Our intentions to the true Religion, but also of Our
resolution, to maintain and defend the same, and Our subjects in the
profession thereof: And perceiving likewise that in contempt of Our
proclamation at Glasgow the 29. of November they go still on to conveene,
meet, and to make illegal and unwarrantable acts, We have conceived it fitting
to forewarne all Our good subjects of the danger that they may incur by being
ensnared by these their unlawful procedures. And to this purpose do not only
liberate and free them from all obedience to any of the pretended acts, made,
or to be made at the said pretended assembly, or Committees direct therefrom,
but do also free them from all pain and censure which the said pretended
assembly shall inflict upon them, or any of them. And therefore do discharge
and prohibit all Our subjects, that they nor none of them acknowledge nor give
obedience to any pretended acts nor constitutions made or to be made at the
said pretended meetings, under all highest pains. And We command, charge, and
inhibite all presbyteries, sessions of Kirkes, Ministers within this Realm,
that none of them presume nor take upon hand privately nor publicly in their
sessions and meetings, nor in their conferences, sermons, nor no other manner
of way, to authorize, approve, justify, or allow the said unlawful meeting or
assembly at Glasgow: neither yet to make any Act thereupon, nor to do any other
thing private or public, which may seem to countenance the said unlawful
Assembly, under the pain to be repute, holden and esteemed and pursued as
guilty of their unlawful meeting, and to be punished therefore with all
rigor: And siclike We command all and sundry Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Magistrates, and all other Our lieges who shall happen to be present and hear
any Ministers either in public or private conferences and speeches, or in
their Sermons, to approve and allow the said unlawful Assembly, rail and
utter any speeches against Our Royal commandments, or proceedings of Us, or
Our Council, for punishing or suppressing such enormities, that they make
relation and report thereof to Our Council, and furnish probation, to the
effect the same may be accordingly punished, as they will answer to Us
thereupon: Certifying them who shall hear and conceal the said speeches, that
they shall be esteemed as allowers of the same, and shall accordingly be
taken order with, and punished therefore without favor. And to this effect We
likewise straightly charge and command all Judges whatsoever within this
Realm, Clerks and Writers, not to grant or pass any Bill, summons, or
letters, or any other execution whatsoever, upon any Act or Deed proceeding
from the said pretended Assembly, and all keepers of the signet from
signetting thereof, and that under all highest pains. And because We gave
order and warrant to Our Commissioner to make open declaration, not only of
Our sense, but even of the true meaning of the Confession of Faith, in Anno
1580. by which it may clearly appear, that as We never intended thereby to
exclude Episcopacie, so by no right construction can it be otherwise
interpreted, as is more nor evident by the reasons contained in the said
Declaration, and many more, which for brevitie (the thing in it self being so
clear) are omitted. Herefore We do not only prohibit and discharge all Our
subjects from subscribing any band, or giving any writ, subscription, or oath
to, or upon any Act, or Deed that proceeds from the foresaid pretended
Assembly, but also do require them not to subscribe, nor swear the said
Confession in no other sense then that which is contained in the said
Declaration, and manifestly emitted by Our Commissioner, under all highest
pains. And that none of Our good subjects, who in their duty and bound
obedience to Us shall refuse to acknowledge the said pretended Assembly, or
any of the pretended Acts, constitutions, warrants, or directions proceeding
therefrom, may have just ground of fear of danger or harm by doing thereof,
We do by these promise, and upon the word of a King oblige Our selves by all
the Royal authority and power wherewith God has endowed Us, to protect and
defend them, and every one of them in their persons, fortunes, and goods,
against all and whatsoever person or persons who shall dare or presume to call
in question, trouble, or any ways molest them, or any of them therefore. And
Our will is, and We charge you straightly and command, that incontinent these
Our Letters seen, you pass, and make publication hereof by open Proclamation
at the market cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, wherethrough none
pretend ignorance of the same.

Given from Our Court at Whitehall the eighth day of December, and of Our
Reign the fourteenth year, 1638. Per Regem.

THis Our Proclamation, published only to make Our people acquainted with Our
gracious proceedings at Glasgow, which by the malice of their Leaders had
either been concealed from them, or misreported to them, was received, as all
Our former gracious proffers, with a very undutifull, windy and blustering
Protestation, so full of words, but withal, so void of truth and sense, as We
were once resolved not to have inserted it here, neither indeed is it
necessary it should, for it is stuffed with the idle and superfluous
repetitions of those things which are contained in their former Protestations,
especially their last Protestation made at Glasgow, with which indeed it is for
the most part the same verbatim: Yet, because We know that if it should be left
out they would not stick to assure their followers, that it was omitted because
of the unanswerable pregnancie of the reasons contained in it, here you shall
have it, but without any answer to it, as to their former Protestations has
been given; there being very little in it which is new, and so not answered
before, or what is in it new being either very false or very impertinent,
both which falsities and impertinencies shall only be observed on the
margent, being assured that the Reader will easily find that there is nothing
in it worthy of any larger answer.

The Protestation of the general Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, made at
the Market Cross of Edinburgh the 18. of December, 1638.
WE Commissioners from Presbyteries, Burghes, and False: for there was not,
after Our Commissioners leaving of the Assembly, any one Commissioner from any
Universitie of that Kingdom, which did not desert it.
Universities, now conveened, and yet sitting in a full and free Assembly of
the Kirk of Scotland, indicted by his Majesty, and gathered together in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ the only Head and Monarch of his own Kirk; And
We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses and Commons, Subscribers
of the Confession of Faith, make it known; that where We his Majesty's loyal
subjects of all degrees, considering and taking to heart the many and great
innovations and corruptions lately by the Prelates and their adherents
introduced into the doctrine, worship, and discipline of this Kirk, which had
been before in great purity, to our unspeakable comfort, established among us,
were moved to present many earnest desires and humble supplications to his
sacred Majesty, for granting a free general Assembly, as the only legal and
ready mean to try these innovations, to purge out the corruptions, and settle
the disorder of the Kirk, for the good of Religion, the honor of the King, and
the comfort and peace of the Kirk and Kingdom: it pleased his gracious
Majesty out of his Royal bounty, to direct unto this Kingdom, the Noble and
Potent Lord James Marquess of Hamiltoun, with Commission to hear and redress
the just grievances of the good subjects: who, by many Petitions and frequent
conferences being fully informed of the absolute necessity of a free general
Assembly, as the only judicatorie which had power to remedy those evils, was
pleased to undergo the pains of a voyage to England, for presenting the
pitiful condition of our Kirk to his sacred Majesty: And the said
Commissioner his Grace returned again in August last, with power to indict an
Assembly, but with the condition of such False.
prelimitations, as did both destroy the freedom of an Assembly, and could no
ways cure the present diseases of this Kirk. Which was made so clearly
apparent to his More false then the other, if it were possible.
Grace, that for satisfying the reasonable desires of the subjects, groaning
under the weariness and prejudices of longsome attendance, he was again
pleased to undertake another journey to His Majesty, and promised to endeavor
to obtain a free general Assembly, without any prelimitation, either of the
constitution and members, or matters to be treated, or manner and order of
proceeding: so that if any question should arise concerning these particulars
(whereof the power of ruling Elders as a part of the constitution, and the
examination of Episcopacie as a present question to be moved, was expressed,
albeit now the Commissioner has pretended the samine for the greatest causes
of his rising and away going from the Assembly) the samine should be
cognosced, judged, and determined by the Assembly, as the only judge
competent: And accordingly by warrant from our sacred Sovereign returned to
this Kingdom, and in September last caused indict a free general Assembly to
be holden at Glasgow, the 21. of November last, to the unspeakable joy of all
good subjects and Christian hearts, who thereby did expect the perfect
satisfaction of their long expectations, and the final remedy of their
pressing grievances. But these hopes were soon blasted, for albeit the
Assembly did meet and begin at the appointed day, and for the space of seven
days sitting was countenanced with his Graces personal presence, yet his
Grace did never allow any freedom to the Assembly, competent to it by the
Word of God, Acts and practice of this Kirk, and his Majesty's indiction, but
did labor to restrain the samine during the time of his abode there, by
protesting against all the Acts made therein, and against the constitution
thereof by such members, as by all Law, reason, and custom of this Kirk, were
ever admitted as members constituents of our free Assemblies, and by denying
his approbation to the things proponed and concluded, though most clear,
customable, and uncontroverted.

And further, his Grace after the presenting and reading of his own Commission
from our sacred Sovereign, and after his seeing all our Commissions from
Presbyteries, Burghes, and Universities, produced and examined, and the
Assembly constitute in all the members by unanimous consent, did, to our great
grief, without any just cause or occasion offered by us, False, and
sufficiently before disproved
unexpectedly depart, and discharge any further meeting or proceeding in this
Assembly, under the pain of treason; and after seven days sitting, declare
all Acts made, or thereafter to be made in this Assembly, to be of no force
nor strength; and that for such causes as were either then expressed verbally by
his Grace, or contained in a Proclamation made by his Grace at Glasgow, It is a
wonder that men can be found who dare aver such an untruth, when the
Proclamation at Glasgow is subscribed by the hands of our Councillors: let the
Reader turn back to it and be judge.
without any warrant of an Act of Council, contrary to the Law and custom of
this Realm: whereunto we answered by our Protestation of the 29. of November,
or otherwise for such reasons as his Grace thought meet to allege, which are
since superadded in this late Proclamation, now made at Edinburgh, this 18. of
December, wherein, for our greater surcharge of sorrow, we are heavily and
wrongously blamed and taxed of many great offenses.

And first for making Protestation against the Proclamation made at Edinburgh
the 22. of September last, Anent our Protestation.
whereas our reasons contained in that our Protestation are so forcible and
just, to demonstrate the necessity and lawfulness of our Act, that we judge
all good men and Christians will be satisfied therewith; whereanent we remit
our selves to our Protestation printed, and will not for shortness repeat the
samine reasons here.

And where we are reproached and blamed in this new Proclamation for guarding
and watching the Castle of Edinburgh, Anent our watching the Castle of
Edinburgh.
and impeding to import ammunition, or other necessaries, to any of his
Majesty's houses; an Act which is exaggerat to be without an example in the
Christian world, seeing we deny that liberty to our Sovereign, which the
meanest of us do assume to our selves: For answer hereunto, we confidently
affirm that we are unjustly challenged of all the said points, except for
preveening dangers evidently threatened unto us, by circumspect attendance about
the Castle of Edinburgh; which afterward we shall show to be warrantably done:
They confess it within eight lines after this.
For we declare that we have never made the least stop or hindrance to the
importation of any ammunition, victual, or thing whatsoever, into any other of
his Majesty's houses, or Castles: Nor for carrying all necessary sustentation
into the Castle of Edinburgh. Neither has any of us fortified, or provided any
of our private houses for warlike defense; so that all those are heavy, and
unjust imputations: But we confess and grant, that there being some provision
and ammunition quietly imported into this Kingdom, for furnishing the Castle
of Edinburgh, and intended secretly to have been put therein, we have carefully
preveened the samine by our diligent attendance, And that for such reasons,
grounded upon equity, the Law of nature, and municipall Laws and Acts of
Parliament of this Kingdom, and the lowable example of our predecessors: For
the truth is, that having petitioned his Majesty for redress of our just
grievances, and a legal trial thereof, before we received any answer
thereunto, all possible means were used to dissolve that union which was made
amongst us for that good cause, and to impede all our meetings from
deliberating thereupon, wherein the town of Edinburgh made a considerable part,
not only as an important member of this conjunction, but as a most commodious
and ordinary place of our meetings; so that when all other means of
persuasion had failed, the means of terror was not left unassaied: And for
that effect a great quantity of ammunition was brought by sea from foreign
parts to have been clandestinly imported into the Castle of Edinburgh, as no
doubt it was intended, seeing the samine was unloaded in the dead time of the
night: And we considering that in case the samine had bin imported into the
castle, with other provision and store formerly therein, the samine might have
bin used and employed for the overthrow of that place, and tended to our great
prejudice, by withdrawing them, upon that terror, and displacing us from our
ordinary meetings; upon these reasons and considerations we preveened the
samine by such a loyal way as cannot be offensive to Authority: True: but We,
and Our Council, and Our Judges, and the rest of Our loyal subjects are the
public; mutiners and rebels are but a private and schismatic part, though
never so many.
For the safety of the public is the end of all lawful power, and supreme
Law. And the adversaries of our Religion having formerly boasted, by that
provision so to furnish the Castle, that it might beat down the town of
Edinburgh, and bar the supplicants from meeting therein, we had just reason to
hinder that fetter of slavery to be put upon the town; and that the Castle of
Edinburgh, which is amongst the first strengths of the land against foreign
forces, might be turned as a special engine of constraint against the
subjects, to hinder their lawful meetings, or to force the town of Edinburgh
to separate from the rest of the supplicants: Which great prejudice the Law of
nature teaches us to avoid, And yet we have not proceeded therein without the
warrant of the Acts of Parliament.

For first, where there is any violent presumption of spoiling of the Country,
it is ordained that the But not without or against the Kings command; his
General (much less any Lieutenant of his) cannot do that.
Lieutenant raise the Country, and pass to such Castles and fortalices where
there is any unrulie men, and take sovertie of the persons within these houses,
that the Country and all the Kings lieges be unharmed and unskathed of the
said houses, and of them who inhabits the samine from time forth: And if any
make difficulty to be arrested, and find sovertie as Law will, they shall
be streinied thereto, James 2. Parliament 2. Act 3. And therefore now seeing
there is not only violent presumption, but great menacing, from the
adversaries of the truth and Country, and their adherents, of the breaking of
the Country and harming of the samine; and especially his Majesty's lieges
within Edinburgh, by the extraordinary provision of munition to the Castle of
Edinburgh, and that by the said Bishops plots from his Majesty's prime
officers, who in his Majesty's absence should preveene that inconvenient by the
ordinance of that Act: Therefore upon their default the Country it self and
the Kings lieges, in whose favors the Act is made, may provide for their own
safety, and keep themselves unharmed by that Castle, or any inhabitants
thereof, and so preveen the importation of ammunition thereunto, conform to
the said Act of Parliament.

All this which follows, concerning the guarding of Our Castles and Forts,
and keeping Us out of them, contains no less then treason, and is not to be
answered with a pen.
Secondly, as the Castle of Edinburgh and certain other Castles and lands are
the Kings undoubted annexed property, so it is to be considered for what
cause they were annexed, by whom annexed, upon what condition, and how to be
disponed upon. For the only cause expressed in the annexation thereof 41. Act.
James 2. Parliament 11. is, that the poverty of the Crown is oftimes the
cause of the poverty of the Realm: Which Act makes no mention that the King
was annexer of the Castles and Lands to the Crown, but only that by the advice
of the full Council of the Parliament it was so statute and ordained, And
appoints that they may not be disponed upon, without advice, deliverance, and
decree of the whole Parliament, for great, seen, and reasonable causes of the
Realm: So that being thus annexed to the Crown by the Realm it self, for
avoiding an inconvenient to the Realm, and being annexed with condition not to
be disponed upon without the advice and decree of the whole Parliament, and
for great, seen, and reasonable causes of the Realm; justice and equity will
require, that these Castles should not be made an instrument of the poverty
and desolation of the capital town of the Realm, and of the harm of the
most considerable part of the body of the Realm there conveened for
supplicating his Majesty and the Council, and preparing overtures to the
future Parliament, for redress of our just grievances. But now by this
extraordinary provision to the Castle, being threatened with ruin and
exterminion, they may stop the misimploying of that benefit granted to the
Realm eo animo and ad hunc finem, for the well of the Realm, while the
Parliament of the Kingdom give their humble advice to his Majesty thereanent.

Thirdly, by the 9. Act. 9. Parl. James 6. it is acknowledged that the Castle
of Edinburgh, Dumbartane, Stirling, and Blaknesse, are four chief strengths
of the Realm which ought to be safely kept to the Kings behove, and welfare
of the Realm: And for keeping the Castle of Edinburgh, there is assigned, with
consent of the Estates, both money and victual, a great part whereof is forth
of the thirds of benefices, which thirds in December 1561. were decerned and
ordained by Queen Marie, with advice of her Council and others of the
Nobility then present, to be up taken and employed for these two uses: viz.
Sustaining of Ministers, and entertaining and setting forward the common and
public affairs of the Country and Commonwealth of the Realm: which was
also enacted, Act 10. Parl. 1. James 6. and thereafter ratified Act 121. Parl.
12. James 6. Whereby it does appear that as the Castle is the Kings undeniable
annexed property, so it is also a strength of the Realm, which should be
safely kept to his Majesty's behove, and welfare of the Realm, having for the
keeping thereof rents assigned with consent of the three Estates of the Kingdom
forth out of the thirds of benefices, estimate by the Estates in eum usum, for
entertaining and setting forward the public affairs of the Country and
Commonwealth of the Realm. And consequently the most Which the Covenanters are
not.
loyal part of the body of the Realm has maine interest to divert the
converting of this strength to the weakening or ruin of the Realm or any
member thereof, threatened by this unusual provision, and openly denounced by
our said enemies.

Fourthly, by the 125. Act 7. Parl. James 6. it is acknowledged that the Kings
Castles and strengths are the keys of the Realm: and the only use of keys
is for keeping together in safety and preservation, and not for spartling,
dispersing, or perdition. So that the Realm and collective body thereof can
hardly be disallowed for contributing their loyal endeavors to the good
keeping of their Whether should the King or his subjects keep the keys of his
own Kingdom?
own keys, when contrary to the right end these keys are used against the
Country and Realm, whereof they should be, and are the keys of safety: as
by the said Act is declared.

Fifthly, by the same Act, all violent detainers of the Kings Castles from him,
or constrainers of the Kings regents do redeem his own houses, and all makers
of any such bargain, merchandise, or market of the Kings Castles, are only
ordained to rander and deliver again what they have received for reddition of
the said Castles, and that the King shall have action for repetition thereof
as necessarily given for the time, and wrongously received for unlawful
causes. And our proceedings being compared with the subject of that Act of
Parliament, cannot deserve so harsh constructions, where the But the
Covenanters are the worst part.
best part of the body of the Realm being constrained for indemnitie of their
persons and goods, do neither take nor detain the Castle, but only withold
importation, first clandestinly intended, and thereafter openly threatened, of
all kind of warlike and invasive furniture, which could be useful to no
purpose, but to the harm and annoyance of those who were conveened for the just
occasions foresaids, who deserve and expect approbation and We do not take
them to be such fools as to expect thanks from Us for their proceedings; if
they do, they are like enough to go without them.
thanks from his Majesty in his own due time, for keeping his evil
Counselors, and bad Patriots, from putting hand in his best subjects.

Sixthly, by the 25. Act 6. Parliament James 2. sundry points of treason are
ennumerate: And amongst the rest, one is the assailing, without consent of the
Estates, the Castles or places where the Kings person shall happen to be: And
now the Kings person not being in this Castle, but out of the Country, and the
The worst and most disloyal part of all Our subjects.
best and most loyal part of his subjects both for number and fidelity,
imploring his Majesty's authority, for convocating the Estates to take order
with these, who, presuming upon his Majesty's absence, are bold to give him
sinistrous information and counsel, these who do no ways assail the Castle,
but bars these evil Patriots from putting in execution their damnable
suggestions by their supercherie violence and terrifications from that Castle,
before the convention of Estates, cannot in Law and equity be challenged in
their carriage, so necessary to them in the interim, while the Estates
conveene in a Parliament, which now his Majesty has been graciously pleased
to proclaim.

Seventhly, it is known by our Chronicles and Records, that the Castle of
Edinburgh was given in keeping to the house of Erskine by the King and Estates
of Parliament, In what history be these words? is it not Regi as well as
conventui ordinum? or can there be a convention of the three Estates called
without the King or his Authority?
hac lege expressa and condition, ut nulli nisi conventui ordinum reposcenti
traderent.

Eighthly, this Act is not unexampled in the Christian world: but has many
presidents both in the History of other Kirks and Kingdoms, and of our own,
which has many such examples even done by the Estates themselves: whose fact
does make our right, and whose authority is ratified conform to the ancient
and loveable custom, in punishing rebellious subjects, and preserving the
faithful, Act 130. Par. 8. James 6.

In the next place we are upbraided for our meetings, Anent our meeting and
alleged Council Tables.
which in the Proclamation are called Council Tables only by that name which
by ordinary expression is due to judicatories, to make it believed, that we
have arrogate to our selves some unwarrantable power and authority; (which we
neither have nor intends to do God willing) whereas the truth is, that in a
matter so highly importing all of us, as the preservation of Religion and
purity of Gods worship, it was most necessary for us to meet, and that in a
sober, modest, and quiet way, for deliberating with joint advice upon those
weighty businesses for the good of the Kirk, his Majesty's honor, and peace
of the Kingdom: And those Many letters have been sent* down from Commissioners
of Shires then resident at Edinburgh to them living in the Country, requiring
them to do such things, as they would answer the contrary to the Table.
meetings did never emit nor send forth any authoritative command or
injunctions, but conclude upon such advices as might be most expedient for
advancing that great business, and facilitating the way of supplication to his
Majesty, and overtures for the Assembly and Parliament; which was an Act
lawful and approvable in the self, albeit the conclusions thereof did not
carry the force or validity of a binding law or command, which was never aimed
at, nor intended: Which meetings they might warrantably keep for that end,
being for Gods glory, and removing the just grievances of the subjects, no
ways prohibited by any of our municipall Laws, which disapproveth such
conventions as are for disturbance of the peace, or usurpation against
Authority, whereof neither of the two can be alleged against these meetings:
Not the first, because no invasion, violence, offer of wrong by word or deed,
to any person, no even to those, upon whom they justly complain, ensewed upon
the same, notwithstanding of their provocations, and their fears falsely
represented to his Majesty, and maliciously pretended for their stay out of the
Country: Not the second, because their meetings was to consult in manner
foresaid upon the most fitting and humble way of supplicating his Majesty, and
for the most convenient propositions to be represented to his Majesty, the
Parliament, and Assembly: all which acts are most compatible with the loyalty
and duty of good subjects, and do no ways entrench upon Authority, seeing
they can never be challenged to have assumed to themselves any judicial
determination in any matter of State, Civil nor Ecclesiastical, but by
voluntary instructions and opinions every one to another in a common cause of
Religion, did resolve what might be most conducible to their lawful and just
ends; And yet those conventions want not the warrant of Law and Authority,
because they consist of the Nobility, Barons, Burrows, and Ministry, which by
the fundamental Laws of the Land, have place of proponing, reasoning, and
voting in Parliament and Assemblies, Act 113. King James the 6. Parl. 11.
wherein is acknowledged that it is necessary to the King and his Estates to be
truly informed of the needs and causes pertaining to His loving subjects in all
estates, and therefore ratifieth the Act made by King James, 1, anno 1427.
Giving power to Barons, to propone all and sundry needs, and causes, and to
hear, treat, and determine all causes to be proponed in Parliament: which
necessary and true information cannot be made to his Majesty and Estates, But
was ever that previous meeting or contention of the Estates without the calling
and authority of the King?
without privy meeting and consultation: and consequently it being granted to
them, to inform the King and Estates, and to propone, hear, treat, and
finally determine all needs and causes to be proponed in Parliament, there must
be necessarily understood to be a sufficient power granted to them for meeting
and advising upon that information: Quia aliquo concesso, omnia concessa
videntur, sine quibus concessum expediri nequit. And as to the Ministers they
have likewayes power granted to them, not only by the word of God and
constitutions of the Kirk, but by the King and laws of this land, to propone,
reason, and vote in Assemblies, and be the samine parity of reason to keep
preceding meetings, not to determinate or execute, but to consult upon their
necessary propositions: So that these lawful meetings, for the religious end,
suffer wrongously the invidious designation of Council tables: which is only
done for procuring misconstruction against them; because at these meetings and
consultations they sat about a table, which posture is no ways prejudicial to
Authority, the meanest of mechanik crafts having their own tables where about
they sit, when they consult upon the smallest business importing their trade.
And farther, these same meetings, consisting of Commissioners from each
Sheriffedome and body of this Estate, were allowed by his Majesty's Most false.
Council first, and thereafter by the Commissioner his Grace; In so far as the
whole subjects of this kingdom out of their resentment of the weight of this
cause, having numerously conveened at Edinburgh, from all the parts of the
kingdom, that confluence of people was desired to be dissolved, and directed
to make choose forth of that great number of some Commissioners from each shire
who might meet to represent their just grievances and desires, and attend the
answers thereof.

Anent some members of the Assembly alleged to be under censure.
The third particular challenge in the Proclamation, is for the illegal and
unformall course taken in the election of Commissioners to the Assembly,
whereof some are alleged to have been under the censure of this Kirk, some
under the censure of the Kirk of Ireland, some banished for teaching against
Monarchy, others being suspended, some admitted to the Ministry contrare to
the laws of this kingdom, others at the Horn, some confined, and all by oath
bound to the overthrow of Episcopacie: Whereunto although no answer be
requisite, seeing the persons thereby meaned, are not specially condescended
upon, yet for clearing all men's minds, and showing the warrantablenesse of our
proceedings, it is of truth that the Assembly, after particular trial which
they took upon some such surmises, could not find any censured by the Kirk of
Scotland or Ireland, by a lawful manner, in a lawful Who have made the
Covenanters Judges of the lawfulness either of the judicatorie or the cause?
especially, what an intolerable presumption is it in them to judge Our
judicatories in Ireland?
judicatory, or for a lawful cause: but on the contrary, the Assembly, after
careful searching and examination, found, that any censure inflicted upon any
of these persons in Scotland was only by a Bishop (who ought to be punished for
taking arrogantly on him the name of the Kirk of Scotland) and that without
the advice of any Presbytery, but sitting in his high commission (which was
condemned by the laws of this Kirk and Kingdom, is discharged by the Kings
Proclamation, is one of our just grievances, and a part of the Bishops dittie)
and that only for refusing the innovations and corruptions abjured by the
Confession of Faith 1580. For the censure of the Kirk of Ireland, it was not
notified to the Assembly by any such objection, and yet out of their zeal and
care to satisfy all these misinformations, whereof they heard some
whisperings, they fand after trial, that these censures inflicted were for the
same causes foresaids, and yet could not militate out-with the bounds of that
diocie where they were censured in their own law and practique, and none of
them were ever banished for any cause, let be for that odious cause pretended
in the Proclamation: wherein the mention of Horning against some of the
Commissioners could not be a lawful exception against them, because Horning
can neither take away their Ministerial function, nor deprive the Presbyteries
of their voice by their Commissioners: But in special this Horning against the
Commissioners to the Assembly cannot be respected; because it was done in
Edinburgh upon a But they know that many members of that Assembly were
denounced Our rebels, and put to Our Horn, long before Our Assembly was
thought on.
suddenty (upon what intention we permit every one to consider) after all the
members of the Assembly were gone to Glasgow, and yet Protestation was taken
against the samine, and suspension craved upon the real offer of consignation,
which, contrary to the common law and practice of this kingdom, was
unexampledly refused, and public instruments taken thereupon: All which
objections are only now remembered to blemish the proceedings of this Assembly,
but were never urged nor proponed in the Assembly; but on the contrary, the
Commissions of all persons were produced, examined, discussed, and approven in
my Lord Commissioners own audience, without any contrary voice of the
Assembly: And yet upon these challenges much is built against the Assembly, and
the samine are aggravate from a preceding oath, whereby it is alleged that the
Commissioners were bound to overthrow Episcopal government, which is of the
same stamp and metal with the rest: For the truth is, that there was never
any oath given, nor exacted, but that which is contained in the Covenant,
whereby all was abjured, only in general, which was contrary to the
Confession of Faith 1580. leaving to the trial and determination of the
Assembly, whether Episcopacie and some other innovations were repugnant to the
said confession, or not. And at the best, it is a bad inference, that one who
has maintained orthodox opinions, and preached against heresy, and error,
may not in the lawful judicatorie voice for condemnation of these errors. And
as for the election of Moderatours, admission of Ministers by Presbyteries, and
restitution of Elders; the same needs no answer in this place, being
sufficiently cleared by us before in our answers to the 11. Articles exhibit
unto us by the Commissioner his Grace: Which answers were so satisfactory, that
after the receipt of the same, his Grace promised to procure a free general
Assembly, with power to determine upon all questions anent members, matter, and
manner of proceeding. And are further cleared in the book of Policy, and other
Acts already cited in our particular answer to the Declinator of this Assembly,
produced by the Bishops. All which is approven by this general Assembly, and
all Acts carrying appearance of contrariety thereto upon undeniable grounds are
declared to be null ab initio.

Anent the alleged instruments sent from the Tables.
The fourth Act rubbed upon us to our prejudice by the Proclamation, is the
sending from the Tables of instructions, whereof the heads are summarily
expressed, which his Grace indeed did show to the Assembly, and then the members
of the Assembly declared, that neither of these papers were ever sent from the
Not from their public meetings (for they durst not for fear it should be
known) but from a cabinet meeting, consisting of them who led the rest by the
nose, and whose names We know, and shall be known to all in due time
meetings at Edinburgh to any man in their knowledge; and yet for the first
(which possibly might have been some private direction of one friend to
another, without common advice) it does not contain any thing offensive or
partial. For the phrase of losing of our Christian and civil liberty might be
warrantably expressed in relation to our former bondage and slavery under the
Prelates, tyrannizing in their High Commission, whereby most summarily, at
their own pleasure, they deprived, fined, and confined all persons and
professors, with such an high hand as justly we might affect deliverance from
that servitude, which was likely more to enteresse by the unlimited power
usurped in their Canons. So that the desire of this liberty cannot be judged an
affectation of licentious living without subjection to lawful authority, which
in our solemn Covenant with God we have sworn to maintain. And as for the
other paper, the If it be forged, it is forged by none but Covenanters, who
from many several shires in the kingdom did send copies of the same written
in the same words to Our Commissioner and others, and yet those Covenanters did
not know one of another sending.
same is the forgerie of our enemies presented to the Commissioner his Grace,
of deliberate purpose to make a pretext for discharge of the Assembly, which we
are sorry was so readily embraced, notwithstanding that when the same was
produced by the Commissioner, the same was not only cleared to be no draught
sent by public advice, but the members of the Assembly, and even those whom
his Grace most suspected, denied the same, and offered to control it by
production of the true paper of their instructions, altogether disagreeing from
that other produced by the Commissioner, except in the two points following,
which had been craftily intermixed with the said untruths, to give them some
countenance of probability. Likeas they professed to his Grace, upon their
There was no man in the Assembly who offered any such oath as is here alleged.
We doubt not but there were many members of the Assembly who might have taken
that oath safely, because they were indeed never acquainted with these papers;
but Our Commissioner (if he had been put to it by the Assembly) could have
named many, especially some of the Nobility, Gentry, and Ministers, who could
not have taken that oath without perjurie; and since it is now denied; they
shall be named in due time and place.
oath, that they had never seen the same before, nor ever read any of the
Articles therein contained in any other paper, except the fourth and the eighth
Articles, whereof the fourth was for eschewing (as far as might be)
Chappel-men, Chapter-men, and Ministers Justices of peace, from being chosen
Commissioners to the Assembly: which was so reasonable, that none could be
offended thereat, because First, this (nor the eighth) was not published in
their public instructions (for it would have offended many Covenanters who
were both Chapter-men and Chappel-men) and therefore they acknowledging it to
be one of their instructions, must needs confess it to be amongst their
private ones. But a wonder it is that men should not be ashamed to avow in
print this their false and partial dealing; for this instruction concerning
Chapter-men and Chappel-men was only given to bar some moderate covenanting
Ministers from being chosen Commissioners; for, notwithstanding this
instruction, Master Ramsey, who both was one of the Chapter of Edinburgh, and
Subdeane of Our Chapel, and Rollock, who was Prebend of the same Chapter, and
one of our Chaplains, who duly preached his turns in Our Chapel, and some
others, fierce and fiery revolted Chaptermen and Chappel-men, were chosen
Commissioners, though the reason here expressed was as strong against them as
against the rest.
Chappel-men had approven, and without warrant of this Kirk practiced the
innovations introduced of late; the Chapter-men had practiced the book of
ordination, and (contrary to the Acts of the Kirk discharging Chapters and
their election of Bishops 1578.) had approven the corruptions of Kirk
government, and Ministers Justices of Peace had likewise accepted that civil
office upon them, whereunto they were promoved for the most part as creatures
and dependers of Bishops. And the eighth, wherein some are desired to study the
points which were likely to be agitate in the Assembly, as, de Episcopatu, de
senioribus, and among other points, de potestate supremi Magistratus in
Ecclesiasticis, praesertim in convocandis conciliis; whereat none can take just
exception, because it was the duty of every member of that Assembly to instruct
and enable themselves for agitating every point, which might occur to be
spoken of there by any, or been proponed by the Doctors of Aberdene, who were
expected there, and commanded to study these points: So that this ought not to
be wrested to their prejudice, seeing it was incumbent to the Assembly to know
the precinct of the Kirks jurisdiction, especially anent their own Assemblies,
and to distinguish it from the civil jurisdiction of the supreme Magistrate,
giving to God what is Gods, and to Caesar what is Cesars, whereby the sovereign
Magistrate has no prejudice, but great benefit, to know the extent of his
power in matters Ecclesiastical, lest either he should come short of what is
due to him, or, for want of true information, incroach upon the liberties of
Christ's Kirk: Whereby it is most evident, that no indirect nor partial
courses, nor dangerous propositions, have been used in the preparations and
elections to this Assembly, but such as are most legal, peaceable, ordinary,
and warrantable.

In the next place the Proclamation charges our innocence for repairing to the
Assembly with great troops and bands of men boddin in fear of war, and
furnished with forbidden arms, Anent our going to Glasgow with alleged
numbers and weapons.
in contempt of a preceding Proclamation: whereas the truth is, that our going
and repairing to Glasgow was in the most peaceable, quiet, and single way which
might serve for our security and indemnity against sundry outlawes,
Clangregors, and their followers, who shortly before the meeting of the
Assembly had done sundry outrages, and committed many insolences upon the
Kings good Subjects in these Western parts, both to private men, whom by their
number they might enforce, and by exacting moneys at public mercats near
Glasgow, whereof many were advertised by their private friends from these
places, and to come thither prepared for eviting all affront or hazard which
they might incur by that rascally multitude: So that being firmly resolved
of before to go thither every one accompanied with his own ordinary private
train, we yet continued in that resolution, and went thither in most sober and
quiet way, only with this change, that for preveening that hazard we went not
every man alone with his own ordinary servants, but some few together went in
company; which is not only ordinary in going out the way, but was most
expedient at that time for avoiding the foresaid hazard and prejudice: which
moved us all so to carry with us some offensive weapons* wherewith not only
these rebels were provided, but likewaies such who went to Glasgow with his
Majesty's Commissioners, who upon that same necessity were likewaies Most false.
provided with those prohibited weapons, and yet their carriage nothing thought
to deboird from the duty of good subjects. Upon these reasons some of the
supplicants being present in Edinburgh, at the making of the said Proclamation
16. of November last, did protest that it might be lawful for them to carry
weapons for their own defense, and preservation against any such lawless
invasion or violence as might threaten them, and that they might incur no
prejudice by carrying such weapons as those who followed Councillors and many
others did, promising to carry themselves peaceably and irreproveably during
the time of the Assembly, which accordingly they have done: and seeing our said
carrying of weapons was for defense of our lives, against the invasion of these
barbarous sorners, we are not censurable therefore by the act of Parliament
prohibiting the said weapons, because we was repairing to, or returning from
the Assembly at command of his Majesty's letters and authority, which is in
special words expressed in the act of Parliament, Act 18. Parliam. 1. James 6.
which is thereafter ratified with the same provisions, Act. 87. Parliam. 6.
James 6. and thereafter also ratified, Act. 248. Parliam. 15. James 6. like as
by the 227. Act, Parliam. 14. James 6. all honest men, and good subjects
freeholders, are authorized with a commission to take and apprehend the
persons and goods of those sorners and thieves, keep themselves in prison, and
execute them to the death: And therefore far more to carry weapons for
resisting of their savage violence.

Anent our refusal of Assessors, and of the Bishops Declinator.
And where the formal and orderly proceeding of this Assembly is challenged in
the Proclamation, as peremptory, for refusing voice to the six Assessors
assumed to himself by the Commissioner, and for not suffering the Declinator by
the Bishops to be read before the electing of a Moderator, We cannot conceive
the same to be a just cause of offense, because albeit according to our bound
duty, We defer all humble respect to his gracious Majesty's Commissioner, and
to the persons and places of the prime Noblemen, and Councillors his Graces
Assessors, yet for preservation of the liberty of the Kirk of Jesus Christ, We
did in all humility remonstrate that his Majesty's Commissioner and Assessors,
how many soever (whose place is not to vote, but to assist the Commissioner by
their counsel for his orderly proceeding) could have but only one voice in
the Assembly: Since after thirty-nine national Assemblies of this reformed
Kirk, where neither the Kings Majesty, nor any in His name were present, at
the humble and earnest desire of the Assembly, his Majesty graciously
vouchsafed His presence, either in His own royal person, or by a Commissioner,
not for voting or multiplying of voices, but as Princes and Emperors of old in
a Princely manner, to countenance that meeting, and to proceed in it for
external order: And if we had been honored with his Majesty's personal
presence, his Majesty (according to the practice of King James of blessed
memory) would only have given His own judgment in voting of matters, and
would not have called others who had not been clothed with commission from the
Kirk, to carry things by plurality of voices. Which is also imported by his
Graces Commission produced, wherein he is nominate sole Commissioner. Like as
also his Majesty's Father never had Assessours voicing in It is a bold and
impudent speech to affirm that Our royal Father kept unlawful Assemblies,
especially when some of them are confirmed by Parliament.
lawful Assemblies, nor challenged the same to his Commissioners, but only of
late days in these corrupt Assemblies, which for undeniable reasons are
declared to have been null ab initio. And as to the refusing of the reading of
the Declinator, and Protestation, exhibit by the Prelates, The same was
publicly read, and the first Act of the Assembly, immediately after the
election of a Moderator and constitution of the members, before the which time
there was no Assembly established, to whom the same could have been read, or
by whom it could be judged; Like as we desired his Grace to bring in the
Prelates themselves, and we should both answer for their safety, and give them
a full audience.

And further, whereas his Grace under his hand, Anent his Majesty's declaration
wherein it is not satisfactorie.
gave in his Majesty's declaration, mentioned in this Proclamation, the same
being considered by the Assembly, gave them matter of great joy, to find his
Majesty's royal heart so far enlarged toward them, as willingly to untie
some of those grievous bands wherewith they had been fettered by the means of
some who abused their own places, and trust with his Majesty; But the same was
not found satisfactory, nor sufficient for establishing of a legal security of
the points therein mentionate, nor yet for purging the corruptions, and settling
the peace of this Kirk, as was promised, whereof the Commissioner his Grace
would not stay to be informed, but did unexpectedly and suddenly remove, to the
great grief of the Assembly, who thereby was necessitate to use the power God
never put it in their hands, but the Devil, who is the author of all sedition
and rebellion.
God had put in their hands, for removing all innovations, and settling the
purity, and peace of this Kirk. And seeing in this Proclamation his Majesty's
declaration is insert ad longum, and the Assembly taxed for not being fully
satisfied therewith, we are enforced to repeat here the reasons which moved the
Assembly not to think the same satisfactory, in hope that they, coming to his
Majesty's sacred ears, may procure the continuance of his benign favor, so
acceptable to this Kirk, by the indiction of this Assembly, and production of
the said declaration, and obtain his Royal approbation to the whole acts and
proceedings of this Assembly, which is heartily wished, and would replenish the
hearts of all good subjects with abundant joy and contentment. And first, where
his Majesty has discharged the Service Book, and Book of Canons, and practice
of both, and all Acts, Proclamations, and ordinances made for establishing
thereof, upon information that by the introduction of them, the subjects have
apprehended the inbringing of Popery, and superstition to have been intended:
Neither the discharge nor the ground thereof are satisfactory; Not the first,
because as some Acts and Proclamations did serve for their establishing, so
others gave them an high approbation, as fit means to maintain religion and
beat down all superstition: And therefore though those which established them
be rescinded, yet those which approved them do remain, and may bring forth
other Acts and Proclamations for restoring them or the like hereafter, if these
books receive not a public censure by the general Assembly as the only judge
competent to bar them and the like in all time coming: Seeing Acts of
Council, and Proclamations, are frequent and variable, and yet are no legal
valid mean either to introduce or abolish any thing concerning the doctrine
and discipline of the Kirk, wherein they neither can meddle nor secure the
subjects, Next, seeing by the constitutions of this Kirk But never without the
authority of Us and Our Successors.
the general Assembly has only power to determine concerning the matters of
Gods public worship; And that the framers of these books, who called
themselves the representative Kirk, made them to be practiced in sundry places
of the country by their own authority, and that which they borrowed from The
confession of faith and band annexed, upon which their covenant is grounded,
were enjoined at the first only by the authority of Our royal Father and his
Council, and so these Books were commanded by as good Authority as those.
the Lords of secret Council: Therefore it was most necessary that the same
should be discharged by the general Assembly (the only true representative
Kirk of this nation) for vindicating her just right from violent usurpation,
and preventing the like in time coming; Not the second, for the subjects have
just grounds of persuasion that the Prelates and their followers (the framers
and followers of those books) intended the inbringing of Popery and
superstition by the introducing thereof, because, 1. Many gross points of
Popery and superstition are not only closely couched under the cover of
ensnaring ambiguities (the most insinuating way of errors and best mask to
superstition) but also expressly contained in the Books themselves; as was made
manifest by sundry treatises read and considered in the Assembly, and is now so
declared by the Assembly. 2. The framers and favorers of these Books in their
sermons and conferences have vented sundry Popish errors, and approven Popish
superstitions: which fully detecteth, and leaves no doubt of their intention,
in the introducing of Books so full of Popery and superstition.

Secondly, the discharge of the high Commission by his Majesty's Proclamation
or Declaration cannot be sufficient; because first, his Majesty declares that
he established the same for the ease and benefit of the Subjects, that justice
might be administrate with the more conveniencie and less trouble of the
people, And now discharges it, because the subjects have mistaken his gracious
intention: So that if the mistaking be removed, that which is conceived of it
self to serve for administration of justice, with ease and benefit to the
subjects, may be established upon pretention of the removeall of all such
mistakings. Secondly, though the acts and deeds made for establishing thereof
be rescinded, yet the acts past heretofore by the high Commission are not
rescinded: And so the subjects censured by it, are still esteemed under these
censures, as appears by the tenor of the Proclamation, wherein the Assembly
is taxed, as consisting of some members that are under the censures of this
Kirk, meaning the Bishops censure in the high Commission. Thirdly, it being
found contrary to the acts of Parliament, and acts of general Assembly, and
extremely derogatory to them and all other subalterne iudicatories both civil
and Ecclesiastical (which is made clearly manifest by a treatise presented to
the general Assembly,) and it being devised and brought in by the suggestion
of Bishops, as a mean whereby they might, and have unlawfully, tyranized over
all the subjects, Therefore it is necessary that the Parliament and general
Assembly, the highest civil and Ecclesiastical iudicatories that have been
wronged, should by their several sentences utterly abolish it as unlawful and
hurtful.

Thirdly, whereas his Majesty dispenses with the practice of Pearth Articles,
discharges all from urging the practice thereof, freeth from censures for not
urging or practicing them, notwithstanding of any thing contained in the acts
of Parliament, or general Assembly to the contrary, and is content that the
Assembly take the same so far to their consideration, as to represent it to the
next Parliament there to be ratified as the Estates shall find fitting: These
cannot satisfy; because first, a dispensation with the practice, without a
simple discharge, leaves it still arbitrary to those who will practice, and so
continues the rent and distractions in this Kirk. Secondly, although his
Majesty had discharged the practice of them by his Proclamation or
Declaration, yet the subjects had not been put in security thereby, except the
general Assembly (to whose trial they belong and were referred by all the
subscribers of the Confession in March) do either repel the articles of
Perth, or upon good reason declare that Assembly null, since his Majesty's
Proclamation or Declaration is not a sufficient warrant to infringe an act of
Assembly or Parliament made to the contrary. Thirdly, by tying the Assembly to
take the same no further unto their consideration then to represent it to the
next Parliament, the Assembly is both prelimitate (whereanent refers to the six
reasons against prelimitation insert in our Protestation September 22.) and
weakened in power, It may not; and the holding of the contrary is a false and
Jesuiticall position.
as if it might not judge and determine in matters merely Ecclesiastical
without a license from his Majesty, or a reference to the Parliament, whereas
the general Assembly is supreme and independent in matters Ecclesiastical, as
the Parliament is in civil; so that when the acts of Assembly are ratified in
Parliament, the same is for adjoining the civil sanction to the Ecclesiastic
constitution for the great terror of transgressors.

Fourthly, anent the oaths administrate to Ministers at their entry, it has
not only been pretended, but is certain, and will be made manifest to the
Assembly, (which also now is done) that oaths have been exacted different from
that which is set down in the acts of Parliament, and in many several ways
according to the pleasure of the Prelates: And where his Majesty declares that
no other oath shall be required of a Minister at his entry, nor that which is
set down in the act of Parliament, A fearful proposition in deed it is, to
hold Episcopal government to be an uncontroverted government, which has
continued in the Church ever since the time of Christ and his Apostles, without
the least suspicion of controversy until within these few years.
the same is of fearful consequence, because the act bears an oath to be
given unto the Bishop by Ministers intrants, and so supposes the office of a
Bishop to be unchangeable and uncontroverted, whereby the Assembly is
prelimited (against the reasons before mentioned) which may find that office
useless and unlawful in this Kirk, and which now they have found upon most
infallible reasons.

Fifthly, that his Majesty assures general Assemblies shall be kept as often as
the affairs of this Kirk shall require, does not satisfy, because first, by
leaving the time undefinite, it preiudgeth the liberty of the Kirk of holding
yearly general Assemblies at least, and oftener pro re nata: ratified by the
act of Parliament 1592. the disuse whereof has been a maine cause of our
evils, which should be prevented in time coming, by renewing that ancient
necessary custom and liberty: Secondly, by the same act of Parliament it is
provided that the King, or his Commissioner being present, shall appoint the
time and place of the next Assembly: And in case his Majesty or his
Commissioner be not present for the time in the town where the Assembly is
holden, it shall be leasome to the said general Assembly by themselves to
appoint the time and place of the next Assembly, as they have bin in use in
times past: But this declaration not only leaves all indefinite but totally
everts that power and liberty competent to them by law and custom. Thirdly, As
it does not determine how often the ordinary effairs of this Kirk require an
Assembly (which the custom of this Kirk and act foresaid evidently manifest
to be yearly once at least) so neither does it determine who shall judge when
the necessity of extraordinary effairs require an Assembly pro re nata: whereas
undoubtedly the Kirk will be most sensible of her own necessities, and is the
most proper Judge of her own effaires: And therefore should have freedom to
appoint her own times when she finds her self pressed with present
exigencies, as his Majesty has also power when he perceives any necessity
requiring the same.

Sixthly, whereas his Majesty is content that all the present Bishops and their
successors be answerable to, and censurable by the general Assembly, it does
not satisfy; because, First, it bears a prelimitaon of the Assembly in the
matter of trying that Office, and presupposes the continuance thereof by
succession as unquestionable. Secondly, They have been formerly made
censurable by the general Assembly in the straightest way that the Kirk could
enjoin, or they could assure: And yet these thirty years they have shunned all
censure (though all their actions deserved it) by procuring general Assemblies
to be prorogate, and then suddenly indicted when they had cunningly prepared
both persons and purposes to their mind: Likeas now they have by their
Declinator refused to answer, and be censured by this present Assembly indicted
by his Majesty, conveened in the name of Christ, and perfitly constitute in
the members thereof: And therefore it lies upon this present Assembly to take
some solid course, for securing the Kirk, in all time coming, against the
prejudices of their former and frequent breaches contrary to their oaths given.

Seventhly, whereas his Majesty requires this present Assembly to subscribe
this Confession of Faith formerly signed by his Royal Father 1580. and lately
commanded by his Majesty to be subscribed by all his Majesty's subjects: The
reasons contained in the Protestation September last 22. (whereto we adhere and
repeats the same) do sufficiently evidence that we cannot subscribe the same:
to which we add, First, that his Majesty's Commissioner has declared to the
Lords of Session when their subscriptions was required, that it might subsist
with the innovations introduced since the year of God 1580. which But they do
not declare all the truth; for of twenty Lords of the Session, only four did
it, but the rest who were present did the contrary.
some of the said Lords then did, and all of us do now conceive to repugne to
the genuine and true sense of the Confession of Faith as it was first made:
Secondly, That his Grace has protested diverse times in this Assembly, that
nothing done or to be done therein prejudge the Archbishops and Bishops in
their privileges, places, power and jurisdiction: whereby the declares that
these may subsist with the Confession of Faith, notwithstanding they be
novations introduced upon this Kirk, contrary to the same, since the year
foresaid, as is now found by the Assembly: Thirdly, That to the Assembly
presently conveened and perfectly constitute in the members thereof, it
pertains properly according to the word of God, constitutions of this Kirk,
and book of Policy, ratified in diverse Assemblies, to determine what is the
true meaning of the Confession of Faith, and to make the same known to all the
members of this Kirk, who thereafter without scruple or danger may subscribe
the same. And although the Assembly could not find this Declaration
satisfactory for these and the like weighty reasons, yet were they willing the
same should be insert in their books for obedience to his Majesty's desire: and
thankfully acknowledging his Majesty's pious affection to true Religion, and
Royal resolution to defend the same and his subjects in the profession
thereof, expressed in the closure of his Royal Declaration, they were confident
that when his Majesty shall be fully informed that the novations introduced
since the year 1580. are incomparable with the Confession of our Faith, he
will be pleased graciously to vouchsafe his comfortable protection upon those,
who (adhering to the true meaning of that Confession now fully cleared by the
Assembly) have abjured all the innovations introduced, and by their great oath
and subscription have bound themselves to maintain the true Religion, and his
Majesty's person and authority in defense of the same. And thus true Religion
being the channel which convoyeth both duties to their proper object, the
evidence of Gods image in our dread Sovereign his Depute shall be terrible to
all the enemies of his Majesty, and of his loyal subjects who stand for the
Confession of Faith, and the true meaning thereof, and shall raise up the
affections of his Religious subjects toward his Majesty above all earthly
respects.

Anent Episcopal government, and the other general reasons.
And where it is subjoyned in the Proclamation that nothing was able to give
contentment, except we were permitted to overthrow Episcopal government and to
abrogate public Laws standing, and take away one of the three Estates, we
are sufficiently cleared thereof by the Acts of the Assembly, abrogating, and
abolishing Episcopal government in this Kirk for The reasons contained in
that Act are infallibly false.
infallible reasons contained in the said Act, and also by our answer published
to the Declaration emitted in the Commissioners name (which for brevity we
forbear to insert herein) whereby we have sufficiently evinced that our
proceedings are not contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom, or destructive of
any lawful third Estate, and which part of the Proclamation does close, with
an undeserved imputation to our loyalty, bearing that for the like dangerous
Acts so derogatory to Royal authority, and for others reasons importing true
Monarchical government, the Commissioner was forced to dissolve the Assembly;
but the same is so generally expressed, that it appears evidently to be done
of plain purpose to make us hateful, which we hope will not work that end,
unless some special Act of disloyalty or malversation could be specially
condescended upon (which undoubtedly had not been omitted if it had been
possible) otherways that dark cloud of general terms cannot obfuscate the
pure brightness of our sincere intentions, unless our true representation of
grievances, and earnest humble pressing legal redress thereof at his
Majesty's hands, may deserve that aspersion in the eyes of these Councillors,
who think themselves obliged rather in absolute obedience, then a dutiful
representation to their Sovereign of what is just and warrantable; wherein we
appeal to all the world, if either our proceedings, or opinions be any ways
derogatory to the true power of Monarchical government or his Majesty's
authority, which we are obliged to defend with our lives and fortunes by our
Covenant.

Anent his Graces intention to return.
And where in the Proclamation, in that part thereof, anent the Commissioners
discharge of the Assembly, is insinuate some expression of his graces
willingness to return the next morning to the Assembly, we declare that we
were most sensible of the benefit of his Graces presence, and received great
contentment by that countenance of Royal authority in representation, whereof
we would never have deprived our selves, if we had had the least signification
of any such intention: but the truth is, that having called our selves to our
best remembrances, we heard no word or expression tending that way; but by the
contrary Most false.
we did humbly require his Grace to give in the reasons of his coffeehouse
in writ, and to return the next day again, at which time we should give in
sufficient answers thereto which might wipe away all his Graces objections, and
move him to continue his wished presence to that Assembly, whereat he had
publicly professed he could no longer assist: but this being refused, and the
Assembly discharged by him, we were necessitate to protest both that day and
the day following upon the Mercate Cross of Glasgow, and to show, that in
conscience of our duty to God and his truth, the King and his honor, the Kirk
and her liberties, this Kingdom and her peace, this Assembly and her freedom,
to our selves and our safety, to our posterity, persons, and estates, we could
not dissolve the Assembly for the reasons following: First, Anent our sitting
still after the Commissioners discharge.
for the reasons already printed anent the conveening a general Assembly,
which are now more strong in this case, seeing the Assembly was already
indicted by his Majesty's authority, did conveen and is fully constitute in all
the members thereof, according to the word of God and discipline of this Kirk,
in presence and audience of his Majesty's Commissioner, who has really
acknowledged the same by assisting therein seven days, and exhibition of his
Majesty's royal Declaration to be registrate in the books of this Assembly,
which accordingly was done. Secondly, for the reasons contained in the former
Protestations made in name of the Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and
Commons, whereunto we did then iudicially, and do now actually adhere, as also
unto the Confession of Faith and Covenant subscribed and sworn by the body of
this Kingdom. Thirdly, because as we are obliged by the application and
explication subioyned necessarily to the Confession of Faith subscribed by us,
so the Kings Majesty, and his Commissioner, and privy Council, have urged
many of this Kingdom to subscribe the Confession of Faith made in anno 1580.
and 1590. And so to return to the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk as it
was then professed; but it is clear by the doctrine and discipline of this
Kirk, that it was most unlawful in the self, and prejudicial to these
privileges, which Christ in his word has left to his Kirk to dissolve or
break up the Assembly of this Kirk, or to stop and stay their proceedings in
constitution of Acts, for the well-farre of the Kirk or execution of
discipline against offenders, and so to make it appear that Religion and Kirk
government should depend absolutely upon the pleasure of the Prince. Fourthly,
because there is no ground of pretense, either by Act of Assembly, or
Parliament, or any preceding practice, whereby the Kings Majesty may dissolve
the general Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, far less his Majesty's
Commissioner, who by his commission has power to indict, and keep it secundum
legem and praxim, but upon the contrary his Majesty's prerogative Royal is
declared by Act of Parliament to be no ways prejudicial to the privileges
and liberties which God has granted to the spiritual office-bearers and
meetings of this Kirk, which are most frequently ratified in Parliaments, and
especially in the last Parliament holden by his Majesty himself; which
privileges and liberties of the Kirk, his Majesty will never diminish or
infringe, being bound to maintain the same in integrity by solemn oath given
at his Royal coronation in this Kingdom. Fifthly, the Assemblies of this
Kirk have still enjoyed this freedom of uninterrupted sitting, without or
notstanding any contramand, as is evident by all the records thereof, and in
special by That Assembly is but one instance and a very reprovable one. The
Ministers of the pretended Assembly at Aberdene did the same, and were most
severely punished for it.
the general Assembly holden in anno 1582. which being charged with letters of
Horning by the Kings Majesty his Commissioner, and Council, to stay their
process against M. Robert Montgomerie pretended Bishop of Glasgow, Or otherways
to dissolve and rise, did notwithstanding show their liberty and freedom by
continuing and sitting still, and without any stay going on in that process
against the said M. Robert, to the final end thereof, and thereafter by letter
to his Majesty did show clearly, how far his Majesty had been misinformed,
and upon misinformation prejudged the prerogative of Jesus Christ and the
liberties of this Kirk, and did enact and ordain that none should procure any
such warrant or charge under the pain of excommunication. Sixthly, because now
to dissolve after so many supplications and complaints, after so many
reiterated promises, after our long attendance and expectation, after so many
references of processes from Presbyteries, after the public indiction of the
Assembly, and the solemn Fast appointed for the same, and after frequent
convention and formal constitution of the Assembly, in all the members thereof
and seven days sitting, were by this Act to offend God contemn the subjects
petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redress of the calamities
of the Kirk and Kingdom, multiply the combustions of this Kirk, and make
every man despair hereafter ever to see Religion established, innovations
removed, the subjects complaint respected, or the offenders punished with
consent of Authority, and so by casting the Kirk and Estate loose and
desolate, would abandon both to ruin. Seventhly, it was most necessary to
continue this Assembly, for preveening the preiudices which might ensue upon
the pretense of two Covenants, whereas indeed there is but one: that first
subscribed in 1580. and 1590. being a national Covenant and oath to God, which
is lately renewed by us, with that necessary explanation which the corruptions
introduced since that time contrary to the same, enforced: which is also
acknowledged in the Act of Council in September last, declaring the same to be
subscribed as it was meaned the time of the first subscription; and therefore,
for removing that shame and all prejudices which may follow upon the show of
two different Covenants and Confessions of Faith in one Nation, the Assembly
could not dissolve before it had tried, found, and determined that both these
Covenants are but one and the self same Covenant: The latter renewed by us,
agreeing to the true genuine sense and meaning of the first as it was
subscribed in anno 1580.

And further in the said Proclamation, Anent our cytation of Councillors.
the strain of our Protestation is taxed, because we have thereby presumed to
cite those of his Majesty's Council who have procured, subscribed, or ratified
this Proclamation, to be responsall to his Majesty and three Estates of
Parliament; whereas the same cannot be justly quarrelled, because it it is
grounded upon the Law of the Kingdom, and warranted by the act of Parliament
therein cited 12. act. Par. 2. James 4. which act is grounded upon good reason:
for it were strange to think that Councillors giving bad counsel, to the
evident prejudice and ruin of the Country, and public detriment of the good
Subjects, should not be countable therefore to his Majesty and his Estates;
and it is not without instance in our Laws, that perverse counsel has been
given in misguiding the Kings and common good of this Realm, Act 6. Par. 1.
James 4. which is also acknowledged by the reduction of grants made by Kings to
these perverse Councillors, act 3. Par. 4. and act 5. Par. 1. James 4. The
perverseness of which misguiding counsel, has been assuredly the cause why
in the next Parliament in the year immediately subsequent, the Kings Council
was chosen in Parliament, and sworn in presence of the King and three Estates,
and ordained to be responsall and accusable to the King and three Estates for
their counsel: Which clears that both evil counsel may be given, and that
the Council may be accused before the King and Parliament for malversation in
their charge. Like as his Majesty in the Proclamation, makes all persons
liable to the Parliament and general Assembly, and so gives way to this
previous cytation, which may serve for a forewarning and intimation that they
may be accused if they be guilty, as we know all are not, and wish that none
were.

All which heavy objections and imputations are premitted in the Proclamation
to the conclusion and command thereof, Anent the injunctions and Proclamation,
and our answer thereunto.
which resolves into two heads; the first discharging obedience to the acts of
Assembly, and liberating all, who shall disobey, from censure, and promising
Protection to the disobeyers, and inhibiting all Presbyteries, Sessions of
Kirks, Ministers within this Realm in their Sermons, Sessions, and meetings or
any otherways, to authorize, approve, or allow the Assembly at Glasgow, or do
any deed which may countenance the same, under pain to be punished with all
rigor. And commanding all who shall hear them, to delate the same, under
pain of the like punishments; likewaies straightly charging and commanding all
Judges within this Realm, Clerks, and Writers, not to grant or pass a bill,
summond, or letters, or any other execution whatsoever, upon any act, or deed,
proceeding from the said Assembly; and all keepers of the Signet from Signeting
thereof, under all highest pain. And the second head, commanding all Subjects
to subscribe and swear the Confession commanded by his Majesty conform to
the sense and meaning of the declaration published by the Commissioner,
whereunto we need not here make any answer, but remits the same to a special
answer, published in print made to that They should do well to try if they can
answer it, and the Queries of Aberdene better; for the common opinion is, that
neither of them yet are answered at all.
Declaration. But for the first, the same is so far repugnant to the word of
God, practice of the primitive Kirk, the Laws Civil and Canonical, the
custom of all Nations, the constitutions of our general Assemblies, acts of
Parliament, practice of other judicatories within this Kingdom, to the
Confession of Faith and discipline of this Kirk, as we cannot believe any such
commandments to proceed from our gracious King, but from the malice and
misinformation of our adversaries, the conscience of whose guiltiness
affrighteth them to undergo their deserved censure, which is All these texts
of Scripture are profaned and abused; for no such thing can either possibly or
probably be inferred from them.
clear first, That the same is contrary to the Law of God, from that place of
Scripture Mat. 18. wherein the Kirk is commanded absolutely to inflict
censures. 1. Cor. 5. wherein the Kirk did execute that commandment. And the
Kirks of Pergamus and Thyatira, are reproved for not executing Ecclesiastical
censures against those who held the doctrine of Balaam, or of Jezebel, 2. Rev.
So that the power of the keys in Ecclesiastical censures is so intrinsecally
and so essentially competent to the Kirk and general Assembly jure divino, as
obedience to her decreets and executions thereof, cannot be suspended, far
less taken away and discharged by humane authority, more nor the power of
preaching and administration of the Sacraments. Secondly, it is contrary to the
practice of the Apostolic and Primitive Kirks, whose constant practice was to
execute the spiritual functions and censures; and, notwithstanding humane
prohibitions, to obey God rather then man. Thirdly, It is contrary to the
civil Law, si contra jus vel utilitatem publicam, vel per mendacium fuerit
aliquid postulatum vel impetratum ab Imperatore. Et titulo de diversis
rescriptis and pragmaticis sanctionibus. Fourthly, the same is contrary to the
It is well that they will cite the Pope his Law whom they call Antichrist; for
when any thing is objected against them out of the Canon Law, it is usual with
them to reject that as Popish and Antichristian.
Cannon Law decret. decretal. extravagan. titulo de rescriptis. Fifthly, it is
contrary to the universal custom in all Nations ordaining their Judicatories
to do justice, notwithstanding their Princes prohibition, as is clear by
Convarnvia in Spain, Pappon in France, Suedwyne in Germany, etc. upon the
title de rescriptis aut constitutionibus principum. Sixthly, to the
constitutions of general Assemblies, because in sundry general Assemblies
upon complaints made that the Kings Majesty and his Council by their letters
offered some stop to the Kirk from going on in her Ecclesiastical censures,
especially by act of the general Assembly conveened in the new College of
Sanctandrows 20. April 1582. it is ordained that none being received to any
Ecclesiastical function, office, or benefice, seek any way by the civil power
to exeeme and withdraw themselves from the jurisdiction of the Kirk, or
procure, obtain, or use any letters, or charges, either by themselves, or any
other in their name, or at their command and instance, to impair, hurt, or
stay the said jurisdiction, discipline, correction of manners, or punishment of
their offenses and enormities, or to make any appellation from the general
Assembly, to stop the discipline, and order of the Ecclesiastical policy, and
jurisdiction granted by Gods Word to the office-bearers within the said Kirk,
under the pain of excommunication summarily, without any process, or
admonition to be pronounced by the judgment of the Eldership, by the Minister,
or Ministers which shall be appointed by them, how soon it is known that any of
the said heads are transgressed; Likeas both the Kings Majesty and his
Council promised that none thereafter should have that cause to complain, as
is manifest by the Act of Assembly at Montrose in July 1597. And in the
Assembly holden at Saint Andrews, 24. April 1582. being charged with Letters of
Horning not to proceed against Master Robert Montgomrie,; the Assembly did
write to his Majesty that this discharge was extraordinary, as a thing that
was never heard nor seen since the world began, and was directly against the
word of God; and Laws of the Kingdom. And yet notwithstanding of the said
charge the Assembly did proceed and excommunicate the said Master Robert.
Further, In the Assembly at Edinburgh, the 27. of June 1582. Sess. 7. amongst
the grievances presented by the Kirk to the King, The first is, That his
Majesty by device of some Councillors is moved to take upon Him that
spiritual power and authority which properly belongs to Christ as only King
and Head of his Kirk, the Ministry and execution whereof is only given to
such as bear office in the Ecclesiastical government of the same; so that in
his Majesty's person some men prease to erect a Nay, but the pretended Assembly
has erected a Popedom, and for their authority go upon the same grounds, and
use the very same arguments, and abuse the very same places of Scripture which
the Pope and the learned Patrons of the Pope do for robbing of Princes of
their Authority over all Ecclesiastical persons, and causes in their several
Dominions: The words which next follow are mere babbling.
Popedom, as though his Majesty could not be full King and Head of this
Common wealth, unless alswell the spiritual as temporal sword be put in his
Majesty's hands, unless Christ be rest of his authority, and the two
jurisdictions confounded, which God has divided, which directly tends to the
wrack and overthrow of all true Religion, etc. And in the Assembly holden at
Edinburgh in October. 1582. Sess. 15. Summonds are direct by the general
Assembly against the Kings Advocate, for drawing up the Kings Proclamation of
that strain. 7. The foresaid command is also contrary to the Acts of
Parliament: because as the Acts of Parliament appoint every matter for its own
Judicatorie, and to all Judicatories their own freedom, so much more does this
liberty belong to the national Assembly, being the supreme Judicatorie
Ecclesiastic of this Kirk, and only competent Judge in matters so important,
and so nearly concerning Gods honor and worship immediately, the salvation of
the peoples souls, the settling of the purity of Gods worship, the purging away
the corruptions thereof, and right constitutions of the Kirk, whose liberties
and privileges are confirmed, Parl. 12. King James 6. and Parl. 1. King
Charles. Likeas by the 12. Par. 114. Act K. James 6. ann. 1592. the liberty
and discipline of the Kirk, especially in her Presbyteries and Assemblies, are
fully and firmly ratified, with declaration that the Act of the Kings Majesty's
prerogative Royal over all Estates and persons, shall no ways be prejudicial
to the privileges which God has given to the spiritual office-bearers in the
Kirk, concerning heads of Religion, matters of heresy, excommunication,
collation, and deprivation of Ministers, or any such like essential censures,
especially grounded and having warrant of the word of God, with full power even
to the particular Presbyteries to put order to all matters and causes
Ecclesiastical within their bounds, according to the Discipline of the Kirk.
8. The Lords of Council and Session by Act 92. Parl. 6. King James 6. are
ordained to proceed in all civil causes intended or depending before them, or
to be intended, and to cause execute their Decrees, notwithstanding any private
writing, charge, or command from the Kings Majesty, or His Council in the
contrary, and by the 47. Act, 11. Parl. King James 6. all licenses and
supersederees purchased from his Majesty, are discharged as contempt done to
the Law, as great hurt to the lieges, and contrary to justice, and declares
the same to be null of the Law, and not admissibly by any judge, nor
effectual to the purchaser any ways, and ordains all Judges within this
Realm to proceed and do justice, siclike and in the same manner as if the said
supersederees and licenses never had been purchased nor produced. Like as by
the 106. Act Parl. King James 6. all licenses granted by his Majesty to hinder
the execution of Acts against Papists and other adversaries of the true
Religion are discharged and declared to be of no force. According to which it
has been the ordinary custom both in Civil and Ecclesiastical
Judicatories (notwithstanding of privy warrants or prohibitions contrary to
Law which commonly are impetrate from his Majesty upon misinformation) to
proceed and minister justice. 9. To discharge obedience to the Acts of the
Assembly, stop the execution thereof, protect and defend such as are
delinquents and under the Kirks censure, does directly repugne to the large
Confession of Faith of this Kirk. Wherein cap. 19. the third mark of the true
Kirk is affirmed to be upright, ministration of Ecclesiastical Discipline, as
Gods word prescribes, for establishing good order and repressing of vice: and
so no more can be impeded nor justly taken from the Kirk then any of her other
two marks viz. The right preaching of the word and ministration of the
Sacrament: And therefore in the Oath at the Kings Coronation, he swears to
maintain this Confession, and these three marks of the Kirk, and particularly
that he shall be careful to root out of his Empire all Heretics and enemies
to the worship of God, that shall be convict by the true Kirk of God of the
foresaids crimes. 10. In the short Confession of Faith sworn, 1580. and 1590.
and renewed by the greatest and By the greatest, but the worst part of the
Kingdom.
best part of this Kirk and Kingdom, with an explication renewed also at his
Majesty's command by his Council, all are bound to continue in obedience of
the Doctrine and Discipline of the Kirk and defend the same according to their
vocation and power. So that seeing this general Assembly has proceeded in
their Constitution, Acts, and whole proceedings according to the Discipline of
this Kirk of Scotland 1580. and 1590. contained in the second book of
Discipline: which in both these years were ordained to be registrate and
sworn to by all the Ministers of this Kirk, as the Discipline thereof, and
wherein the Civil and Ecclesiastical jurisdiction are so clearly
distinguished in the 1. c. l. 2. as the power of the sword may no ways stop or
impede the power of the keys: and in the 7. c. the Eldership and Assemblies
has power to execute Ecclesiastical punishment upon all transgressors and
proud contemners of the Kirk: and in the 10. c. the office of the Christian
Magistrate is described to assist and maintain the Discipline of the Kirk, and
punish those civilly who will not obey the censures thereof, without
confounding always the one jurisdiction with the other: and this order of
Ecclesiastical Discipline, condescended upon in general Assemblies, as
warranted by divine authority to be execute notwithstanding any humane
inhibition, is set down before the Psalms in meeter: and therefore we can
never expect that his Majesty, who out of his pious inclination to justice by
a late Proclamation 22. September last has declared and ordained that all His
subjects both Ecclesiastical and Civil shall be liable to the trial and
censure of general Assembly or any other Judicatorie competent, will now stay
the execution of the The sentences of this pretended Assembly were most
unlawful, light, and mad sentences.
lawful and grave sentences of this national Kirk, so comfortable to us, and
so necessary for maintaining the purity of Religion: which his Majesty in
the end of the Articles before mentioned has promised to defend, and His
subjects in the profession thereof, which is incompatible with the defense of
excommunicate and obstinate persons. But therefore we are assured that his
gracious Majesty will be pleased to allow that reverence and all ready
obedience may be deferred to the whole Acts, Constitutions, and censures of
the said general Assembly, by all His subjects, who undoubtedly and
necessarily are obliged to obedience of all the lawful commands and
injunctions of the mother Kirk if they would be accounted members or sons
thereof.

By all which It seems indeed that these reasons are wrapped up in a cloud,
for both they are so dark as they cannot be discerned, and they do portend a
storm, but have no weight in them at all.
cloud of weighty reasons the warrantablenesse of our just proceedings does
evidently appear, notwithstanding of all the arguments of challenge adduced
against us in the said Proclamation: And therefore for these and many other
reasons, We the members of this Assembly, in our own names, and in the name
of the Kirk of Scotland whom we represent, And we Noblemen, Barons,
Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons, before mentioned, do solemnly
declare in the presence of the everliving God, and before all men; and protest
These particular Protestations are the very same formerly made by them, and so
often repeated even unto tediousness; and therefore the Reader needs not to
be troubled any more with them.
That our thoughts are not guilty of any thing which is not incumbent to us,
as good Christians toward God, and loyal Subjects toward our sacred
Sovereign: And we attest God the Searcher of all hearts, that our intentions
and whole proceedings in this present Assembly have been and shall continue
according to the word of God, the Laws and constitutions of this Kirk, the
Confession of Faith, our national Oath, and that measure of light, which God
the Father of light has granted unto us, and that in the sincerity of our
hearts, without any preoccupation or passion.

and continue in keeping this present Assembly indicted by his Majesty,
until after conclusion of all matters it be dissolved by common consent of
all the members thereof, and that for trying judging and censuring all the
bygone evils, and the introductors, and providing a solid course of the
continuance of Gods truth in this land with purity and liberty, according to
his word, our Oath and Confession of Faith, and the lawful constitutions of
this Kirk.





James 4. And protest for remead of Law against them and every one of them.







respective for the time, So we may have his Majesty's royal approbation to
this present Assembly, whole Acts and constitutions thereof, and all our
proceedings and behavior in this business, which we assuredly expect from
his Majesty's imbred piety, justice, and bounty, notwithstanding the
sinistrous, untrue informations, whispered in his Royal years in the
contrary.

Upon all which Premises and Protestation foresaid (which is the same with the
former made by us at Glasgow, the 29. of November last, but so far differing
as was necessary for answer to the new additions contained in this
Proclamation; and clearing us of the aspersions wherewith we are changed
therein, which we might lawfully do, having protested for this liberty in
respect of our surprisall) one certain number of all qualities and ranks for
themselves, and in name foresaid, asked instruments. This was done in presence
of a great confluence of people upon the mercate cross of Edinburgh the 18.
day of December.

FINIS.
Revised, according to the ordinance of the general Assembly, by me Master
Archibald Jhonston Clerk thereto.
At Edinburgh 8. Jan. 1639.
NOt long after this Our Proclamation and their Protestation, Our Commissioner
(seeing all things tending to a present rupture) begun his journie according to
the leave which We had granted him for his return: After which time, and ever
since, they have throughout the whole Kingdom by threatenings made the Acts of
their unlawful Assembly to be received, in many places have persuaded the
reception of them by force and arms, have levied soldiers, and imposed taxes
upon Our subjects for payment of them, have required of Our Judges or Lords of
the Session to approve their Acts, though none of them consented to it, have
threatened and menaced them for refusing of it, have raised diverse
fortifications in Our Kingdom, have blocked up Our Castles and Forts, and now
at last forcibly taken Our Castle of Edinburgh, have at home got their
Preachers most seditiously and rebelliously to teach Our people, that there is
a necessity of their carrying arms against Us, under pain of perjurie and
damnation, have scattered abroad, especially here in England, diverse infamous
Libels justifying their own wicked and rebellious courses, inciting Our people
here to attempt the like rebellion, and to deface Our Ecclesiastical
government.

When the contrivers of that wicked Covenant first framed and devised it, and
persuaded others who were well persuaded of their piety, to enter into it, We
dare appeal even to their own consciences whether they did ever make the
seduced people acquainted with their intentions of abolishing Episcopal
government, and introducing of Lay Elders* which are the only two things they
make the seduced people believe they now stand upon: And We do wonder there
should be any man found in the world, who can hold it a sufficient warrant for
Our subjects to take arms against Us their lawful Sovereign, because We will
not give them leave to abolish some things which stand fully established by Our
Laws and Acts of Parliament of that Kingdom, and to introduce other things
which are interdicted and prohibited by the same: But much more have We reason
to think Our subjects did them no whit believe that (though We should relieve
all their grievances, just or pretended, as now We have done) they should yet
be forced to acts of rebellion, and carrying of arms against Us, as now they
are. But such has ever been the constant course of the Heads of all
rebellions, to engage their followers by degrees, to conceal from them their
maine and wicked ends, which being at the first discovered, would be abhorred
and detested, until they have gone on so far in following their Leaders, as
afterward they are easily persuaded by them, that there is no hope of pardon
left, and so nothing but danger, if they shall offer to retreat: The very same
course has been held in this rebellion for seducing of Our subjects of that
Kingdom. The specious pretense used by the contrivers of the Covenant to the
people was Religion, but that which was intended by them was a Rebellion,
grounded upon the discontents of some few: And the very means whereby they
have fomented their factious ways, and kept up in Our people a belief that
they intended only Religion as they pretended, have been the very same which
have been usually practiced by other discontented mutiners. But yet We find,
that the principal means used to foment this Rebellion by the Heads of it,
have been these three.

First, the seditious prayers and sermons of some Preachers William Nesbett
late Provost of Edinburgh, when he was lying upon his deathbed, only because
he had not subscribed the Covenant. Another prayed God to scatter them all in
Israel, and to divide them in Jacob, who had counseled Us to require the
Confession of faith to be subscribed by Our authority. Many Ministers would
not admit to the Communion those who had not subscribed their Covenant, but in
their exhortation before it, barred them in express terms with adulterers,
slanderers, and blasphemers, etc. Others would not suffer children to be
baptized in the Churches of those Ministers who were not of the Covenant,
though they were their own Parish Churches, but carried them sometimes many
miles to be baptized by Covenanting-Ministers. One preached, That all the
Non-subscribers of the Covenant were Atheists; and so concluded, That all the
Lords of Our Council, and all the Lords of Our Session were such: for none of
them had subscribed it. Another preached, That as the wrath of God never was
diverted from his people, until the seven sons of Saul were hanged up before
the Lord in Gibeon; so the wrath of God would never depart from that Kingdom,
till the twice seven Prelates (which makes up the number of the Bishops in that
Kingdom) were hanged up before the Lord there; which is extreme, foul and
barbarous. Another preached, That though there were never so many Acts of
Parliament against the Covenant, yet it ought to be maintained against them
all. Another delivered these words in his Sermon: Let us never give over till
we have the King in our power, and then He shall see how good subjects we are.
Another in his Sermon delivered this, That the bloudiest and sharpest war was
rather to be endured then the least error in doctrine or discipline. Another
in his Sermon wished, That he and all the Bishops in that Kingdom were in a
bottomless boat at sea together; for he could be well content to lose his
life, so they might lose theirs. Thousands more such beastly, barbarous and
profane speeches were delivered by them, not only in their Pulpits, but in
their Sermons: For the Reader must know, that in these times of tumult, where
the Churches were not able to contain the great multitudes, they did usually
preach in common and profane places, in rooms which are yet in building, and
not finished (intended for Lawyers to plead in) in the Halls of the Tailors,
and other mechanical tradesmen of Edinburgh, in some private houses, in the
Hall of the College of Edinburgh, where one Sunday Rollock being to preach,
but finding the crowds of people to be too great for that place, mounted upon
the top of a pair of stairs which went up to an upper ground, in an open
place which was only covered by the heavens, and from thence preached to a
great troop or multitude, whose breath is the only air he desires to live
in, being shot quite through the head with popularitie. Others preached in the
free-Schoole at Edinburgh, where boys use to play and be punished. If these
speeches, and many as bad or worse then these, and delivered in such places, be
fit to persuade the people that their Covenant comes from God, the Reader may
easily discern.

The second means which they used for blind-folding the eyes of the people,
were, their many false reports, which both those who were most necessitated, he
did a little relieve; but some of that number were none of the protesters, and
many who were protesters were none of that number. It was preached ordinarily
in their Pulpits, that neither We nor Our Commissioner in Our name did ever
intend to hold the general Assembly, or if We did hold it, did never intend to
perform any thing which We had promised in Our gracious Declaration; though
they now know that We have performed both. Within these few days some desired
the people publicly in their Pulpits to give thanks to God for that
overthrow which the Hollanders had given to the Spanish Fleet before Dunkirke;
assuring their auditors that it was no less to be celebrated by them, then
their deliverance from the Spanish Invasion in 88. because all that Fleet was
prepared at Our charge, for their ruin and subversion: Besides many thousands
more such reports and counterfeited letters scattered by them, of which some no
doubt were devised by themselves, whereby they kept Our people in that
ignorance in which at the very first they had resolved to involve them. Now
what a fearful and terrible thing is it for men in the house of God, and in
those places of these houses of God which they call the chaires of truth, to
deliver such things as either they do not know to be true, or do know to be
false? Besides these dictates of the Ministers, the Lay Elders, since they came
to think themselves Ecclesiastical persons (for so now they do, and will not
be called lay, but ruling-Elders) they have found new inspirations, and
delivered doctrines as like their Divines as may be: one of them We cannot
choose but rehearse. An ancient Knight and a lay-Elder intruded himself and his
fellows upon a Presbytery for choosing the Ministers Commissioners for the
Assembly; and the Ministers of that Presbytery not being able to keep them
out, though they earnestly desired it, fell to entreat these Lay Elders, that
if they would needs intrude themselves in their election, they would have a
special care to choose the ablest Ministers, and who were most inclined to
moderation and peaceable courses, because the Church at this time stood in
great need of such Commissioners: The old Knight in great zeal replied, That
whosoever at this time gave his voice to a moderate or peaceable minded
Minister, he was a betrayer of Christ and his cause; because these times
required no lukewarm Commissioners: which barbarous and unchristian speech of
his being related by way of complaint to the Tables at Edinburgh, was so far
from being censured, as it was approved for a high and heroical ejaculation.





Originally only to puzzle the Reader: For certainly their meaning must be,
That the Parliament has no power for confirming of Officers placed in the
Church by the Church it self; for no Act of Parliament in that Kingdom does
make any Officers in the Church originally, but only ratifieth and confirms
such as were established by the Church in her general Assemblies.

at all concerning the Church, but only ratify what the Church decrees: and
after it has ratified it, yet if the Assembly of the Church shall prohibit it,
and repeal that decree of the Church, all the subjects are discharged from
yielding obedience to the Act of Parliament, which either made any such law, or
ratified any such decree of the Church. This position they deliver in their
answer to the 5. reasons in the said Declaration; and would be well weighed.













not indicted one, though this be directly and expressly against two Acts of
Parliament before cyted.



cumulative, not privative, which if We shall refuse, then that power is
suppletive in the collective body of the people, as it is always (say they)
in all other cases, if the Prince shall either neglect or refuse to do his
duty: Nor are they ashamed to aver, that all Sovereign authority was
originally in the collective body of the people, by them conferred with their
own consent upon the Prince; and therefore, if the Prince shall omit to do
his duty, he either falls from his right, or his right is interrupted, until
he return to his duty: but that in the mean time the Sovereign right and
authority does return to, and remain with the people, from whom it was at
the first derived upon the Prince: A pretty matter it were if Princes Crowns
and Soveraignties should depend upon such notionall and pedanticall
distinctions, and wonder it is that these men who profess themselves to be the
greatest enemies to Popery in all the World, should borrow the very words and
terms of this ridiculous distinction from the Jesuits; which distinction, if
it had ever been used in those primitive and purest Councels of the Church; all
of which were only called by the Emperors, and in which all matters were
ordered and disposed by their Presidents and Deputies, it would have made those
Emperors out of love with the Councels and Assemblies of the Church: But they
were never robbed of that special prerogative of their Crown until the
Bishops of Rome by their tyranny and usurpation, and by animating and arming
their own subjects against them, dispossessed them of it: And now We and Our
Successors being repossessed of it again by the Laws of that Our Kingdom,
and the usurpation of the Pope, in that very particular, being by many of Our
Acts of Parliament excluded, wonder it is to see these men take upon themselves
that usurped and cashiered Papal authority.

jure divino to see all these conclusions made in despite of Us, obeyed by all
Our subjects, and by Our authority to enforce obedience to these Acts; and if
Our Councellers or Judges shall refuse to do the like, then they shall be
liable to the sentence of Excommunication, and so be deprived not only of
their places, but of their estates: A position to which We suppose they will
never gain the consent of Princes, or Magistrates put in authority under them.

government can endure it: for it destroys not only the nature, but the very
name of the high Court of Parliament; for how can that be called the Highest
Court of the Kingdom, if a general assembly may rescind the acts of it? And
that power which may repeal one act of it may repeal more, nay all acts of
it, when it shall be pleased to exercise that power, and say it is in order to
the glory of God and the good of his Church.

coram Judice, or non Judice, before the Judges of the people, or the people
themselves who are borne to be judged, does void all obedience to these Laws,
and discharges all the protesters from any obligation to live under them,
before ever these Protestations and the validity of them shall come to be
discussed before the competent Judges of them; nay, although they be repelled
by the Judges before whom they are made: all which (since these troubles begun
in that Kingdom) have been usually practiced by the Covenanters, who having
sometimes made Protestations against Our Laws before Our Council, sometimes
before Our Commissioner, sometimes before the Lords of Our Session who repelled
them all, then they made them before the people their own associates in the
public Marketplaces, and by that means held these Protestations
sufficiently admitted, and themselves discharged from obedience to all these
Laws against which they protested, alleging (perhaps) that they were unjustly
and unduely enacted: which course, if it may be allowed in any Commonwealth,
and that Protestations before they be discussed, may discharge subjects from
obedience to Laws, what subject will yield obedience to any Law, by which he
finds himself pressed or inconvenienced, when the remedy of a Protestation,
whether admitted or not admitted, is so ready at hand?

it in terminis; but it follows by an unavoidable consequence upon many of
their printed positions, as all of them do follow upon, and flow from it: And
the practice of it is so current with them, as it appears almost in every one
of their particular actions; And it is thus: A number of men, being the greater
part of the Kingdom, because they are the greater, (and in that sense (say
they) the more considerable part) may do any thing which they themselves do
conceive to be conduceable to the glory of God, and the good of the Church,
notwithstanding of any laws standing in force to the contrary; and that this
greater part, especially met in a representative assembly, may, without the
authority of Us, against the express commandment of Us and Our Council, and
Our Judges declaration of it to be against the laws of Our Kingdom, choose
some few Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers and Burgesses, who, under the name of
Committees or Commissioners from the general assembly, to be chosen from
assembly to assembly, shall sit and determine of things concerning the Church
and State, as if there were neither King, Council, nor Judge in the land. They
complain of a High Commission erected by Us and Our authority, but whether
this be not a higher Commission then that, We leave it to every impartial
judgment.

They answer for themselves only this, That they do it as being put in
authority by the general assembly, which is (say they) a Court independent
from Us, and therefore may erect what Court it will without Us, and may appoint
what Commissioners it will to sit for that Court, so they meddle with nothing
but Ecclesiastical business: But let the Reader consider how many wicked and
insufferable absurdities this their answer carries along with it.



such Table of Commissioners? They found themselves aggrieved with the high
Commission established by Us, upon this ground, that there was no such Court
established either by acts of general assembly or Parliament: And now We
desire them to show any act of Parliament giving the assembly power to erect
any such Table of Commissioners.



thing which is in ordine ad Ecclesiastica: nay more, in ordine ad Spiritualia,
whatsoever may be thought conducible to the good of the Church, or to any
spiritual good, and yet more vastly to the glory of God; by which latitude of
the word Ecclesiastical, We would know what they have left without the
compass of their cognizance. Just nothing: For in this sense they may set the
price on victuals, they may censure the actions of all men in what kind soever,
because Saint Paul bids us, Whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do,
do it all to the glory of God. And truly, from this false and Jesuiticall
interpretation of this word Ecclesiastical, have issued most of all their acts
of sedition and rebellion: They have provided arms for Our subjects, they
first blocked up all Our Forts and Castles, and since have taken them, stopped
Our Officers from carrying victuals or ammunition into them, they have raised
Forts, taxed Our subjects, levied soldiers against Us, not only turned Us out
of the possession of Our Castles, but, so far as in them lies, defeated Our
title to them, by declaring that they are not Our Castles but the Kingdoms;
they have incroached upon the undoubted bounds and marks of Our Soveraigntie,
by sending warrants to Our Sheriffs for choosing Commissioners for the Shires
for the next Parliament; they have discharged Our own Printer for printing any
thing which concerns these troubles, or may make against them, though
commanded by Us and by Our Council, so that if We have any thing to print
there, We must first be a suitor to Jhonston their Clerk for his hand to it,
else it cannot pass; they have enjoined or at least suffered the Preachers of
their own side to pray and preach most bitterly against Us and Our authority:
those Preachers who continued in their loyalty toward Us, they have most
unjustly against Our laws deprived of their Benefices, and most unmercifully
and unchristianlike exposed them to misery and beggerie, they have most
contemptuously and rebelliously used Our Councillors and Judges: When they are
asked, why they do these things, and by what authority they do them:



viz. Whether any man does hold Christ or Us to be supreme? and being answered
that Christ is supreme, then they conclude, That they being his Council must
likewise be supreme; That the Parliament is but the Council of the Kingdom,
That Our Privy Councillors and Judges are but the Council and Judges of the
King; but that they themselves are the immediate and independent Councillors
of, and Judges under Christ, who is the King of all kings and kingdoms; and
that therefore in all causes which they conceive to concern Christ and his
Kingdom, which is his Church, they are supreme and independent, above Us, Our
Parliament, Our Council, Our Judges: And that if Our Councillors or Judges
do not obey their commandments, they will proceed to the sentence of
Excommunication against them, and by the same reason (though as yet they have
not said it) they may proceed against Us with the same sentence: for We
acknowledge Christ to be the supreme King, as much as Our Councillors and
Judges do acknowledge him to be the supreme Lord and Judge. These furious
frensies have not been heard of in the world, since the Anabaptists madness
reigned in Germany in Charles the fifth his time, which was most strongly and
vehemently opposed by the Protestant Princes, who adhered to the Augustan
confession, and if Luther and Melancthon, whom God used as the chief
instruments in reforming the abuses of the Church of Rome, had not showed
themselves in their Sermons, Lectures in the Universities, and public
writings which they published, stout Champions against them, and thereby had
drawn all Protestants to detest and persecute them, undoubtedly the
Reformation of the Church, falling out to be about the same time when these
Anabaptists raged most in their madness, had labored and suffered extremely
under the scandal of their frensies, in the opinion of all those who were
attending and looking after the issue of that Reformation: And yet these same
fooleries and frensies are daily acted by these who call themselves
Commissioners of the Table, and presented to the Readers of their Pamphlets and
Protestations, with the titles of irrefragable, undeniable, convincing,
unquestionable, Sunshine truths, and twenty more such false impudent epithets,
as one would wonder from whence they fetch the faces that can bear them out in
saying so, when the whole Christian World who shall read them, upon the very
first view or reading, must discern that there is not the least step or shadow
of truth to be found in them. We confess We were amazed at, and aggrieved with
their horrible impudence, expressed in their last Petition sent unto Us, in
which they did invocate the name of God, calling him not only as a witness,
but as an approver of their actions; at their pretended assurance of Our
justification of them all, when they undoubtedly know, that We do abhor and
detest them all as rebellious and treasonable; at their shameless asseveration
of their confidence that their neighbor Churches will approve all their
proceedings; that they are afraid they should be thought to have offended in
nothing so much as in lenity, when they have proceeded to the deposition and
excommunication of the Bishops and others their opposers, which is the utmost
of that power which ever any Church did yet challenge to it self; and many
more such audacious untruths, which after We once heard read, We resolved never
to answer, and now do answer it only thus, That in the maine points of it
there is not one true word: To say nothing of the boldness of this petition,
which expects Our answers in such terms, as it does not only seem to
require Our approbation of their wicked proceedings, but almost to command it:
and lastly, it is subscribed only by the hands of the Moderatour and Clerk of
the Assembly, as if it were an ordinary cytation served upon the meanest
subject of that Our Kingdom. And besides all these, We would know what
Ecclesiastical assembly, just or pretended, did ever use any coercive power,
but that which was Ecclesiastical, viz. suspension, deprivation, degradation,
or excommunication. But this pretended Assembly has besides all these enforced
her acts with arms, and all manner of violence both against the persons and
fortunes of such as do not agree unto them, but continue loyal to Us.

BY this time We hope the Reader is well satisfied that We have been from time
to time well acquainted with, and rightly informed concerning all the
particular passages of these troubles: For since We produce their own
original foul and black acts, and the counsels which We took, and courses
which We held for meeting with them, and hindering them, so far as then on
the sudden We could, every man will now hold their ordinary and so often
repeated calumny sufficiently confuted, viz. That all the proceedings and
proffers on their parts were quite concealed from Us, That their petitions,
remonstrances, and grievances were kept from Us, That We understood no more of
the estate of the affairs of that Kingdom, then the malice of their
adversaries and bad patriots were pleased to impart unto Us; That Our
Commissioner in his several journies between Us and them never made Us
acquainted with the true state of the business, or with their requests and
protestations, That he at his several returns did do that which he thought
fittest to be done, and not what We had commanded him, or that if We did
command him, Our commandments were according to the information which he had
given unto Us of their counsels and courses; which information was never true
nor right, but only such as he and the Bishops had contrived for
mis-informing of Us: All which most wicked calumnies, invented only to keep
Our people unsatisfied, as they are attended with want of truth, so they are
accompanied with a most undeserved ingratitude. For We do profess, that there
was no man since the time of these troubles, who has more zealously stood
between Our wrath and them, then Our Commissioner, and who has more constantly
labored Us to admit any probable construction which might be made of their
actions, ever until such time as they came to that height, that they could
neither probably nor possibly receive any good construction; and yet even then
all his persuasions were to pardon and forgiveness, if they should acknowledge
their errors, and with a submissive humility return to Our obedience. And
here We must needs justify all his proceedings with them, as being punctually
and exactly ordered and performed according to Our instructions and
commandments to him, and condemn their ingratitude to him, not doubting but
ere long they will heartily wish that they had some such about Us, who might
solicit Us for their peace and pardon so carefully as he did, so long as he
had any hope of their amendment.

The same course which they held with him their own countrie-man, they held
likewise with some of this Kingdom of great place, especially some of the
Prelates near Us, and entrusted with the greatest business of this Church and
Kingdom: For, during the time of all these troubles, they have likewise
slandered them amongst Our subjects of that Kingdom, both for misinformation
of Us, and giving Us counsel and advice to shun all ways of peace; Whereas
We must profess that those Prelates, whom (in their last seditious and
treasonable information to the good Christians of England) they have traduced
for their greatest enemies, and chiefly some of them whom they especially
glance at with Our Co^missioner, have bin their greatest friends, their
counsels were always counsels of peace, and their solicitations to Us were
vehement and earnest for granting unto them those unexpected and undeserved
favors, which We were graciously pleased to bestow upon Our people, published
in Our Proclamation at Edinburgh the 22. of September 1638. and afterward made
good to them in Our name by Our Commissioner at the Assembly in Glasgow: These
Prelates and Our Commissioner advising Us rather to condescend to these
particulars, then to be put to the effusion of any drop of Our subjects blood.

But the misery and misfortune of many of Our well meaning subjects in that
Kingdom, has in all this business been this, That they trusted the
mis-informations of their Leaders, even in those things of which their Leaders
themselves did not believe so much as one word: Such were their false reports
of Our inclination to Popery, of Our intentions never to hold an Assembly,
although We had indicted it, of Our intention of never performing any thing in
that Assembly which We had promised in Our gracious Proclamation of the
indiction of it: All which false reports We have since sufficiently confuted by
Our commanding the renovation of the subscription of that Confession of faith
which cannot subsist with Popery, by Our indicting a free general Assembly
(the freedom whereof they quite destroyed by their proceedings both before it
and in it) by Our making good in that Assembly (such as it was) all Our
gracious promises; and therefore We cannot now but hope and expect, that all
Our good and loyal subjects of that Our ancient and native Kingdom will, by
their former experience of the falsehood of their Seducers and Leaders, learn
to give no trust or credit to their posteriour and new mis-informations, which
by their last seditious Pamphlets printed or written, and by many intercepted
letters We find to be these three especially, but all of them most notoriously
false.

threatened; and if for the securing of Our person they should offer themselves
to be Our guard wheresoever We go; what do they else but show themselves to
be true and loyal subjects, and lay an obligation on Us to continue in Our
breast that full assurance of their loyalty and fidelity toward Us, of which
We have always by unanswerable demonstrations been fully persuaded; as also
upbraid the disloyalty of many of Our subjects of that Our native Kingdom,
amongst whom they are loath to trust Us without offering their persons to be
Our guard?

But these two things We do desire all Our good subjects of that Kingdom
firmly to believe: First, We are confident that We shall not much stand in need
of English troops to chastise the Heads of this late Rebellion, as being fully
persuaded that Our loyal subjects, who have all this while adhered unto Us;
and Our misled subjects, who upon this Our Declaration will adhere unto Us, but
above all the justice of the cause of God and of Us his Anointed, shall be
strength enough to bring those principal Rebels to undergo the trial of Our
Laws. Next, We desire all Our good subjects there, to believe that We are so
far from intending any invasion of that Our native Kingdom, as that
according to Our duty and oath taken at Our Coronation, We shall by the grace
of God always be ready with Our whole power, estate, and expense of Our blood
(if the case shall so require) to defend that Our Kingdom and subjects thereof
against all invasions whatsoever. For We do at this time only intend to
reduce the principal Heads of these tumults to the obedience of Us and Our
Laws, and in case of their Rebellious obstinacy, to bring them to those
deserved punishments, which in such cases the Laws of that Our Kingdom have
provided: nor can this either be called or accounted an invasion, more then
the Judges sentencing malefactors to punishment, can be called an invasion of
them.

to Our obedience, is this: They make them believe, that since they have not
accepted of Our gracious offers made in Our Declaration at Edinburgh the 22. of
September last, and made good by Our Commissioner in Our name at the Assembly
in Glasgow, that now We will certainly perform none of them: But these wicked
mis-reporters speak both according to their own deserts (as knowing that
their rebellious misdemeanors have indeed deserved no such favor at Our
hands) and likewise, according to their own desires (as fearing that if We
should make them good, then Our people might and must receive satisfaction
thereby) but they do not speak according to Our Royal intentions, which are
to assure Our subjects, that (as We have before expressed in Our Preface) their
faults and disloyal courses shall not make Us go back from any thing which
We have promised in either of those two Our gracious Declarations made at
Edinburgh and Glasgow, but that We will perform them all for the securing of
all Our good subjects from any further fears of these pretended innovations.



These foul but false aspersions being thus wiped off, We are now desirous to
remove their grand and maine calumny, whereby they do at once endeavor both
to disparage Our just, and to justify their own most unjust proceedings. They
give out that We have no quarrel against them but Religion; and when they are
asked in what points of Religion We will not yield to them, they do not name
any one of which they have complained in their Petitions, and which in them
they called innovations in Religion (for they know, that in Our gracious
Declarations We have given full satisfaction concerning them) but they instance
in other two particulars: Ecclesiastical and secular persons, which have
always been distinguished? Next, how can We betray the Ministers of that
Kingdom unto perpetual slaverie? for if Episcopal government should be gone
(which they intend) and the Ministers in their Presbyteries shall be
over-swayed by the voices of the Lay Elders, what face of Ecclesiastical
government can remain, when it shall be quite pulled out of the hands of
Ecclesiastical persons? And therefore We cannot choose but account it a great
ingratitude in those Ministers who oppose Us, for whose maintenance as We first
stood against the laity, so We are now resolved to stand against them for
their liberty. For the second, which is the abolishing of Episcopal
government, We profess We cannot yield unto it (though it were not warranted
by Apostolical institution at the first, and since by the perpetual practice
of the Church of Christ in all ages and places, as We hold it is warranted by
both:) is so now, and has been for many years by Acts of the general
Assembly.

But say that none of these things were so, yet We would be satisfied in this
point, Whether Our refusing of the intrusion of Lay Elders, and the extrusion
of Episcopal government, can be to the conscience of any man a sufficient
warrant or ground for his taking arms against his lawful King and Sovereign?
for now their very Leaders, acknowledging that We have given them satisfaction
in the rest, make these two the only ground of all their arms. And We
appeal to the consciences of most of Our subjects Covenanters, if, when they
entered into that Covenant at the first, they did ever imagine that they should
be persuaded to take arms against Us, for these two points of Lay Elders and
Episcopal government, if they should receive satisfaction from Us in their
other grievances, and feared innovations, as We have before declared. We are
confident that no such matter was then within the compass of their thoughts:
We then having fully removed those pretended fears which occasioned their
Covenant, We cannot but hope that Our seduced subjects will return to their
former obedience; but for their seducers, We know that some of them from the
very first were resolved never to receive any satisfaction.

This grand imposture and calumny, with the other three, being removed, We
will now declare fully and freely to all Our subjects of Our three Kingdoms,
and to all forrainers besides, the true and only causes which do enforce Us
at this time to use force for the repressing of the insolences of such of Our
subjects in that Kingdom as shall stand out against Us; first protesting that
none of the causes before mentioned, suggested by their Leaders, have settled
in Us this resolution, but only these causes which now follow.













Assembly, which is Christ's own immediate Council, and therefore has no
dependencie from, or subordination either to Our Council or Judges, or Our
Parliament, which is the Council of Our Kingdom, and so that both Churchmen
and laymen under Ecclesiastical names shall exempt themselves from the
authority of Us and Our Laws, and the Assembly it self shall hold the
members of it free from being judged in all matters of Assembly by any but by
it self; which by the Laws of that Our Kingdom is treason, as appears by
the Act cyted in the body of this narration: Now all this has been practiced,
and is practiced by those which call themselves of the Table.

From all which We hope it is evident, that the offenses which We resolve to
punish in some of Our subjects, do not concern Religion: So that the question
is not, Whether there shall be a Service Book, Book of Canons, high
Commission, nay, nor whether there shall be no Lay Elders in Assemblies, or no
Episcopal government, (though We are resolved to reject the one, and retain
the other:) But the question indeed is neither more nor less then this,
Whether We and Our Successors shall be any more Kings of that Kingdom: for if
these traitorous positions shall be maintained and made good by force of
arms, then We and Our Successors can be no more Kings there, Our Parliament,
Council, and Judges have no more authority there; So that unless We will
give over to be King, and so betray and desert that charge wherewith God has
entrusted Us, We must use that power which God has put in Our hands, and by
fair, just and legal ways, to Our great grief, force them to obedience.

These are the true reasons which have forced Us to undertake this journey, and
to make use of the arms and aid of Our loyal subjects here, for the
security of this Kingdom, and safeguard of Our person, as likewise of the
arms and aid of Our subjects of that Kingdom for the same purposes.

journey this is unto Us, and how unwillingly We do undertake it.









along with it a national invasion; and if Our subjects of both nations shall
keep that friendly and loving correspondence in their attendance upon Us in
this journey, We do not doubt but it will be a means to tie them in a
stronger band of love for ever hereafter, when Our Scottish subjects shall here
see the alacrity and forwardness of the English, and the English shall there
perceive the alacrity and forwardness of the Scottish, both of them meeting in
this point and center, viz. the defense of Our person, and of Our Royal Crown
and Dignity.

To conclude: As We have found the aid and assistance of Our loving subjects
here toward this journey, so We do heartily desire their prayers all the time
of Our absence for a good success unto it, and that if it be possible We may
return with peace, and without the effusion of any drop of Our subjects blood:
And We do require all Our good subjects of that Our Kingdom of Scotland,
especially the Ministers who should be the messengers of peace, to frame and
settle Our subjects minds to the courses and ways of peace, and to lead them
on in the way of returning to Our obedience, who does resolve to maintain them
in the Religion now established amongst them, that so We be not forced to draw
Our sword of justice against any of them, which in case of their obstinacy how
unwillingly We shall do, We call the King of kings to witness: But if nothing
else will serve it must be, and their blood will rest upon their own heads.
