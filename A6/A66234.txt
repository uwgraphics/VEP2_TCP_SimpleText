By the King and Queen, A DECLARATION.
William R.

WHereas False and Seditious Rumors are spread abroad by Persons Disaffected
to Our Service, That such of Our Forces as are or shall be sent into the
Low Countries, shall from the time of their Arrival there, be no longer
continued on the English Establishment, and Receive no other Pay then the
Dutch, or other Foreigners of the same Quality, in those Parts; For the
Preventing the Ill Effects of such False Suggestions, We do hereby Declare,
(...) all such Forces within Our present Pay and Entertainment, as are (...)
sent to the Low Countries, or any Parts beyond the Seas, shall be alway^ (...)
Our English Pay, and upon the English Establishment, as fully to all (...) and
Purposes as any other Regiment of Our Subjects, of the same Quality, remaining
within Our Kingdom of England.

Given at Our Court at Hampton Court the Fourth Day of April, 1689. In the
First Year of Our Reign.
LONDON, Printed by Charles Bill and Thomas Newcomb, Printers to the King and
Queen's most Excellent Majesty's. 1689.
