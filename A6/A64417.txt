Terrible News from BRAINFORD:
OR, A perfect and true Relation of one Thompson a Waterman, and two more of
that Function, being drinking in excess at Brainford, at the House of one Mrs.
Phillpots. Thursday night, September 12. began a Health to the Devil, and
another to his Dam; at which falling dead against the Table: With the Devils
appearing in the Room visible, the Burial of the sinful Wretch; his Corpse
seeming heavy at first, but the Coffin afterward as light, as if there had been
nothing in it.

To the Tune of, Chievy Chase.


ALl you which sober minded are,
come listen and I Will tell,
The saddest story I Will declare,
which in our days befell:
Therefore it is for example sake,
the business written is,
That others may a warning take
by such lewd lives as these.
My matter now I have in hand,
does very doleful run;
In Brainford you shall understand
this horrid act was done:
Three Watermen a drinking were,
some say in Phillpots house,
Who very desperately did swear,
they would have one Carouse.
To every friend as they could think,
abroad the world so wide,
A Glass unto his Health would drink,
whatever did betide*
So many Healths about did pass,
which is a shame to tell;
They knew not who to drink unto,
except the Devil of Hell.
Quoth one and swore the Pot shall pass,
be it to good or evil;
And if thou will but pledge a Glass,
I Will drink unto the Devil:
The other said I willing am,
call in for Sack about us;
I Will drink another to his Dam,
it shall not go without us.
With that he bowed down his head,
and suddenly did fall;
He sunk against the Table dead,
in presence of them all:
His vitals then with death was stung,
throughout eternally,
His Nose upon the Table hung,
a ghostly sight to see.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.




THe others then with fearfulness,
their legs were smitten so
With horror and with feebleness,
they knew not what to do:
But staring in the dead man's face,
they dolefullly did cry,
Good people help us in this place,
help, help, or else we dye.
Which horrid doleful voices then
put all the house in fear,
Who nimbly up the stairs ran,
to see what news was there:
And being come, good Lord how then
they trembled in the place;
And questiond then the living men,
like wretches void of Grace.
How came this horrid dismal fate,
declare it good or evil;
For we did hear you once relate
A Health unto the Devil:
It Is very true, quoth they, by stealth
that act we once began;
And I my self did pledge the Health,
and drank unto his Dam.
At which they all were trembling than,
though faint and yet unable;
They did endeavor with the man,
to lay him on the Table:
Which time one knocked at the door,
but going for to see,
An ill-shap't Devil in did bore
amongst their company.
And being come unto the light,
their hearts were very cold;
The Devil did appear in sight,
more wondrous to behold:
But when they on their knees did fall,
and to the Lord did pray;
The Devil vanished from them all,
and quickly went his way.
But when the morrow did begin,
a Coffin then was brought;
And placed then the Corpse therein,
which all this mischief wrought.
The four Bearers did complain,
and to the people say,
It seemed the heaviest Corpse that e're
they carried on the way:
But yet the case did alter quite,
e're to the Church they came,
The Coffin it did seem so light,
as if nothing had been in.
Now let all men a warning take,
by Thomsons dreadful fall,
And drunken company forsake,
so God preserve us all,
And keep us still from great excess
of drinking which is evil;
And never in such drunkenness
drink healths unto the Devil.
FINIS.
