An excellent now Ballad, showing the Petigree of our Royal King JAMES, the
first of that name in England.
To the tune of, Gallants all come mourn with me.


ENgland with cheerful heart give ear,
to that my Mu^e shall now declare:
It Is no ba^e thing I take in hand,
but what brings comfort to this land:
The Petigree of a noble King.
whose name to thee does Honor bring.
O Hone, honinonero, tarrararara,
tarrarararara hone.
The dreadful sting of cruel death,
has stopped ELI^AS princely breath:
And to her joy, she now is gone,
to heaven for an Angels throne
Leaving her Honor and her Crown,
to princely JAMES, of great renown.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
She ruled has among us long time,
in spite of those that did repine:
And sought to stop her princely breath:
but yet she did a natural death.
And to our comfort God did send
King JAMES, his Gospel to defend.
O hone, honinonero. etc.
The Romish Pope, who many a day,
has looked for a violent pray,
Frustrate by Wisdoms power and care,
Is ready now for to despair:
And in a sound he sinketh down,
now noble James has got the Crown
O hone, honinonero. etc.
With his reign does the Spring begin,
as Usher for to bring him in:
Which in consent does well agree
withe'yeere, the incarnate word to be:
And in that month greeing by fate,
by the old world to wisdom dedicate.
O hone, honinonero. etc.
And I divine thus by the year:
England shall have no other peer:
But in his line it shall remain,
In spite of Pope and cruel Spain,
Even until the day of Doom,
that Christ to judgment down shall come
O hone, honinonero etc.
Eight hundred miles his Empire goes
in length, spite of all his foes.
From Cornwall, to past Calidon,
is known to be King James his own.
Half which her boosome forth does lay,
from German to the Virginian sea.
O hone, honinonero. etc.
A fertile soil is Ireland,
now subject to his glorious hand:
Yea all the Isles from famous France,
their chalkie tops to him aduaun^^
Saturn to him resignes his cha^^^
making the wealthy Mines (...)
O hone, honinonero. etc.
My Pen* why stayst thou to report
to satisfy the vulgar sort.
The Petigree of James our King,
whose fame throughout the world does ring:
The Infidel and romish Spain,
shall tremble when they hear his name
O Hone, honinonero* etc.
O let my Pen your ears inchaunt,
to look unto brave John a Gaunt,
Of Edward the third fourth son was he,
from whom we draw this petigree:
For he behind him issue left,
John the Earl of Somerset.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
Which likewise left a son behind,
called John: of a noble mind:
The which was Duke of Somerset,
so made, for his atchiuements great*
The which did win him great renown:
but here I leave to set them down,
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
Which Duke had issue gentle Reader,
Margarete, matched with Edmond Tuder
Which Edmond Tuder had a son,
Called Henry Earl of Richmon:
Which Henry after Richards death,
espoused fair Elizabeth.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
This Elizabeth of famous worth,
was daughter to K. Edward the fourth:
And thus by their predestinate bed,
they joined the White-rose and the Red:
To Englands great unspeakable joy,
And to our enemies sore anoy.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
By which most blessed and happy unite,
they had a Daughter, called Margarete,
First matched to Scottish James the fourth
which was a man of mickle worth:
Which Margaret to James did bring,
the fifth of that name Scotlands King.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
This James a Daughter did possess,
whose birth our sorrows does redress
Called Marie, by her name,
a very fair and princely Dame.
The more her fame for to advance,
was macht with Frauncis K. of France
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
But leave we her in France a while,
and now come back unto the style
Of Henry's Daughter, Margaret,
whose blessed womb brought our delight
^or Archeball Douglas she did wed,
^nguis brave Earl, who issue bred.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
By her he had a Daughter bright,
called by the name of Margaret,
To the Earl of Lenox wedded was she,
and bore a Son named Henry,
The which was called the Lord Darlie,
and after wedded the Scottish Marie,
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
By whose most sweet and happy bed,
our sorrows now are quight stroke dead
For to Lord Darlie she did bring
old Britains hope, and James our king
As next of Henry's line, above other,
coming both by father and mother.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
England rejoice, and now give praise,
unto the Lord, that so did raise
Our sorrowful hearts with hopes of joy,
when we were drownde with sad anoy,
For loss of sweet Elizaes life,
^o^king for nothing more then strife.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
Yet God for us did so provide,
and held us up when we did slide,
And as Eliza she is gone,
he sent an other to ease our moan.
King James is he by whose sweet breath
we still possess Queen Elzabeth.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
For though her Corpse be wrapped in lead*
and never on this earth shall tread,
Yet do her Virtues still remain,
without blot, blemish, or stain.
In noble James her virtues live,
to whom God does her honors give.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
O noble King to England haste,
that our full pleasures we may taste:
For nothing now breeds our despite,
but that we want our Prince his sight
Which if we had, we more should joy,
then 'Lizaes death wrought our annoy.
O Hone, honinonero etc.
Now Englishmen leave off your grief,
For noble James bringes us relief:
Pull mourning Feathers from your head,
and flourish now in Yellow and Red.
Sing joyful Poems of his praise,
that God may lengthen long his days.
O Hone, honinonero. etc.
God grant him among us long to reign
to be a scourge to Rome and Spain:
That hating them, and all their ways,
he still may strive Gods word to raise.
And to defend the poor man's right,
that they be not overcome by might.
O Hone; honinonero. etc.
O Lord make thou his Counsel wise,
that they may give him good advise,
Bless the Commons, and all those
that seek the ruin of his foes:
And may he die a thousand shames,
that with his heart loves not K. James.
O Hone, honinonero, tarrararara*
Tarrararara hone
FINIS.
