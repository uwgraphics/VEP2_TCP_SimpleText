A Song of the New Plot.
To the Tune of, Jones Placket is torn, etc.
1.
HAve you not lately heard
of Lords sent to the Tower, H -- d and S -- y.

Who against the Popish Plotters,
seemed men of chiefest power:
But now they are got, into the Plot,
and all their power in vain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again.
It Is rent and torn, and torn and rent,
and rent and torn in twain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again.
2.
Fitz-Harris they supposed
a fitting Instrument,
The Duke, and Queen, and King
himself to circumvent:
But now he is hanged, and all his Gang
will follow the same strain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
3.
The Joyner he did march
to Oxford to be Tried,
Where he did find a Jury,
who were not Whiggify'd:
And for his Joining in the Plot,
a Halter he did gain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
4.
They say that Mr. Dugdale, As Celle^^e declared in my Lord S^^f^o^ds Trial.

so honest and so true,
Is one of the King's Evidence,
against this wicked Crew:
And now they aim, him to defame,
but all will be in vain,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
5.
The crafty Sh -- y,
is caught in his own Snare,
H' has hired many Rogues,
themselves for to forswear:
And now undone, with Hetherington,
and all his hired Train,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
6.
Thus Innocence we see The Duke and Queen falsely accused by Fitz-Haris.

begins for to appear,
Since Rogues for want of Pardons,
the Truth are fain to swear:
Had it been so, some years ago,
we'd hit on the right vein,
For the Plot is rent and torn,
and will never be mended again, etc.
A DIALOGUE Between Mrs. Celier and the L. S -- y.
Cel. S -- y, what is become of the Plot?

Sh. I would thou were hanged, and it forgot:
But if I once come out of the Tower,
I Will Plot as much as I did before.

Cel. S -- y, what is become of the Plot?

Sh. I now am proved a Traiterous Sot,
For raising men to take the King,
And him to the Block with his Father bring.

Cel. S -- y, what is become of the Plot?

Sh. Fitz-Harris like an Irish Sot,
Has me betrayed, and H -- d too,
And now we know not what to do.

Cel. S -- y, what is become of the Plot?

Sh. Why we are got in, and the Papists out*
For now they have freed Sir Stapleton,
And I must be hanged, and Hetherington*

Cel. S -- y, what is become of the Plot?

Sh. My Witnesses have got the Rot;
But if I trust such Rogues again,
Then I Will be hanged. Cel. Amen. A^^^*

FINIS.
