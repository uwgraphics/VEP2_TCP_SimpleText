A treatise concerning diverse of the constitutyons prouynciall and legantines,

Printed at London by Thomas Godfray. Cum priuilegio regali.

Introduction.
IN this little treatise are contained diverse things concerning the
constytutions prouynciall and the legantynes / of Oath and Octobone / sometime
legates in this realm. And the matters that in treats of be shortly touched
in.xxx chapiters / which be set in the later end of this present treatise /
whereby it appears that diverse of the said constytutyons and legantynes be
against the kings laws and his prerogatyue. And that some of them be also
very troublous unto the people / and not so charitable as they ought to have been.

The first chapter.
IN the constytutions prouiciall in the first book / and in the title of
co^stitutions: there is a decre / which be gynneth. Quia inco^tinentie uicium
et infra. Whereby it is commanded that the constitucyon of the late lord
Octobon / against concubinaryes be inuyolably observed / and that it be
recyted openly in the four princypall chapiters rural of the year / before
all the chapter excludynge thens / and seperatynge all lay persons. etc.

These constitucions be good and necessary. But why lay persons should be
separate fro the seyde recytalle: I se no cause / for if lay persons might be
there also to here it / it would both do them good / and also make the
spiritual men the beter to take heed. And sith lay men here of the defaultes
and abusyons at home where they dwell. What hurt could it do / if they herd
the laws that the clergy has made for a reformation of them: But it is very
like that / that excludynge of lay men fro the redynge of the said
constitucyon: proceeded of a dread / that the prelates at the making of the
said constitucyon had: lest that lay men / if they herd it / should happily
the rather disdayn prestes or dispyse them: but surely it is to fear that /
that dread proceeded not of charity / but of sigularyte / for by reason thereof /
I suppose the matter is come to that effect / that it is neither red to
priests / ne yet to lay men.

The second chapter.
ALso in the constytution / which begins.

Quod in constitutione et infra, And it is in the first book / in the title of
the Iteracyon of the sacraments / to be done / or not done. After the vii.
Sacraments be there resyted / it is said thus. But the.vi. sacrament that is
to say of holy orders / accords to they in that be parfyte. And the seuynth
sacrament / that is to say of Matrymonye / in the time of the New testament
accords to imperfet. And though it be true / that some that be in holy
orders be more parfyte tha^ they that be in matrimony / yet to make a recytall
in the law generally that the one order / that is to say prestehode accords
to perfytte men: And the other / that is to say matrimony accords to imparfet
men / may full lightly give occasyon to the one / that is to say to prestes to
be vain glorious / and to the other that is to say to married me^ / to mystrust
ouermoche the state of lyuenge that they be in / which nevertheless undoubtedly
accords to parfyte men / and if it be well kept / is in deed holy and
blessed. And though I know well that the meaning of the said recitale is not
that all in the one degree be perfect / and in the other imperfect: yet for
asmoche as lay men that read it / and be married may lightly take it so / it
may do great hurt that way / as is said before / but I se no way how it can
do any good. And it is no doubt but that matrimony in the New testament
parteyneth and accords to parfytte men / as well as ever it did in ye old
testament.

The third chapter.
THe law of the Realm is that if an aduowson be voyed / and the patron
present an able encombent to the ordynarye according to the law / that the
ordynary upon his paryll shall admytte him / and if he do not a Quare impedit
lies against him / as it should do against another disturbour. And yet
neuerlelesse has the bysshoppes and clergy made a co^stitucyon / that if a
priest have a benyfyce / and also a son and dies / that / that son shall
not be presented to that benefice next after his father. And the said
constytucyon is in the title of priests sons / in the first book. And
begins: For as much as it is forbidden. And there is a like legantyne of
Otho / that begins. Although holy fathers. etc. And in that legantyne it is
decreed / that if any prestes son / be immedyatly after the death of his
father / presented to the same benyfyce / and no mean parson between / that he
shall be depreued. And these laws were made when it was lanfull for priests to
have wives. And also / it may come yet in ure / in case that a man have a
son before his preesthode / and after has a been fyce / and dies / in
which case his son is prohibyte by these laws / that after the death of his
father / he may not be admytted to that benyfyce. And in this point / the
laws of the realm / and the said spiritual laws do vary: For in the same
self case / if the patron after the death of the father present the son /
so that he be able to be presented / if the bishop refuse him a Quare
impedit Lies against him natwithstandynge / the said constitucyons / and he
shall be compelled by the kings laws to admytte him. And the abylytie or non
abilytie / in this case shall be taken according to the qualytie of the person
presented in virtue and conning / and not according to the laws made by the
clergy. For if they would make a law / that none should be admitted to a
benyfyce / but he were a master of art. That law should not bind in this
realm / and this inconuenyence may follow upon such laws / that if a man in
such case be admytted by auctorite of the kings laws / and be in possessyon
/ the clergy will make process against him / and depreue him / and so that the
one law does the other will avoid / where upon variaunce and unquietness may
ensewe / not only in those cases / but also in other like / and a like law is
in the title of oaths in the second book: that begins thus / We determyne
by this present statute. etc. Whereby it is decreed / that the bishop shall
receive an Oath of him that is presented / that he has neither promised nor
given ought for that presentacion unto the presenter / neither made any
co^pactio^ with him for it / specially if he that is presented seem lykely to
be suspected there of / and there upon it follows / that if such an inconbe^t
refuse to be sworn Wherefore the ordynary for his disobedyence refuses him:
That a Quare impendit lies against the ordynary by the Kings laws / and he
shall be compelled to admit him: But than will the bishop for his disobedyence
pretend to depreue him again / and grudges / suetes / and variaunces may
encrese / and the cause of all this has resyn by reason that the bysshoppes
when they saw cause reasonable (as they thought) to have laws made in the case
before rehearsed would not compain to the perlyame^t to have it reformed there
but would make laws themselves / which they had none auctorite to make / and if
they had complained to the parlyament / and the parliament would not look upon
the matters / than were the ordynaryes the more to be excused: for that they
did that in them was / and therefore as me seems the parliament did well if
they would make like laws in the cases before rehearsed / and in other like /
where the clergy have made laws upon a reasonable consyderation / where they
had none auctorite so to do. And tha^ the laws should stand in good strength
in the laws of the realm against the offe^der / as they do now in the
spirytual law / and if it be thought that no profet can come of the making
thereof / than it will be better to repelle them / than to suffer them continue
any longer.

The fourth chapter.
THere is a Constytutyon in the title of oaths in the second book / which
begineth: Euenir et infra. etc. Where by it is decreed yt when prelates and
ecclesiastycal iuges enquere of the defautes and excesses; of their subjects
that deserve punishment that the lay shall be compelled (if need requyer) by
sentence of exco^municacyon to give an oath to say the truth / and that if any
with stand or let the oath to be given / that he shall be brydeled with the
sentence of exco^municacyon and interdiction / and this constitutyon stands
not with conscience / for it excepteth not that there shall be any monicyon
given before according to the gospel / and over that there be many things
that a lay man may know / which he may not with conscience utter to none
other / neither after monicyon nor before / and yet by this constitucyon he
shall be enforced thereto or be a cursed / and put him self in ieopardy to be
taken as to the world / as a man a cursed / and yet be not a cursed before god
/ and the constitucyon is not / that it shall be disclosed secretly to the
prelate / as it may be sometime if the denouncer think the prelate secret and
charitable / but it must be done in the court / so that process shall be made
upon it / and that may do great hurt / for according to the minds of many
doctors / some per sons refrain to offend for fear of infamye / which if
they perceive them self openly fallen in to it / will fall to sine / all fear
set a part. And over that it may be / that none knows ye matter but he only /
and than his saying is no suffycyent proof / and to compel him to swear where
his oath shall do no good / but happily turn him self to trouble / seems not
reasonable. And over that / the oath that is appointed to be taken by the said
constitution / is nothing like to the oaths that men be compelled to take at
the come^ law / to enquere upon transgressors / for they enquere commonly upon
murders / felonyes / trespasses of lands and goods / comen nusances / or
other things as be against the peace / and to the hurt of the commonwealth /
and that require also the judgment of death / restitution to the parties /
auoydyng to the comen nusances or such other as justice requires to be done /
and that can not be helped by no monycyon made after the offense: And also
such enqueryes at the comen law have been always used by a general custom of
the realm / for the mayntenaunce of justice and of the commonwealth. But this
oath was brought up by the clergy without assente of the king or of the
people / and where unto they could not compelle any man before: and if any man
will say that this mocyon may do hurt / as to avoid corrections / and give
boldness to the^ that be yuell to offe^de / to that I will say thus. I will
not deny but that charytable corrrcetions be right expedient / specially where
there is dout of recydiuatyon and falling again to sin / but surely I have
not herd but that offenders in time paste / by one means or other (I know
not redily how) have been suffered to sit still without correction / not
withstandyng all the oaths that have been made in spu^all courts in time past.

The fyfth chapter
THere is a Co^stitucyon in the first book in the title of the Archepreest /
that begins. Ignorantia sacerdotum et infra. Wherein among other things
the ten commandments be recyted / and it apereth therein / that the first
commandment of the second table / is to honor our father and mother
temporally and spiritually / and it is said after in the same place / that in
this commandment is not understand only the father and mother carnal and
temporal / but also spiritual: So that the father spyrytuall is the prelate
of the church / mediat or immdyeate / and the spirytuall mother is the church
/ whose sons be all and every catholyke person and persons / by which
Constitucyon / some spiritual men have pretended in time past that every man
is as much bounde^ to honor his spiritual father / whereby they understand
his prelate and his spiritual mother / whereby they understand the church /
that is to say prestes / as they be to honor their father and mother carnal /
and that if need require / they be bound to releue the^ temporally / as their
own father and mother / And that is much like to the error of the Pharisyes
which taught the people / that if they would offer to the Temple / it should
discharge them of their duty to their father and mother / as appears. Luc.
xv. It is also a great ouersyght / that the clergy calls the church the
spiritual mother to every catholyke person / meaning only by that word
church / prestes: for all Catholyke people make the church / which is the
spirytuall mother / so that priests be but only a part of it: How be it that
they be in deed a right notable part thereof / but to call them self ye hole
church it seems a great ouersyght / and that they have do so / it appears in
many writings / as when it is said: that such a thing or such / is against
the lybertye of the church / the meaning is / that it is only against the
lybertye of the clergy / and so it is where it is said: that all they that
wrongefully witholde any thing from the church be accursed / and that manner
of writynge is found in many places of the Constitucyons and other writings
also: Insomoche that in the very statutes of the realm that term church, is
sometime used for the clergy / as in the statute of Magna carta: the first
chapter. Where it is said / yt the church of England shall have all her old
lybertyes / whereby is meant no other / but that the clergy of England shall
have their lybertye / And it is not to think but that tho words were / put in
to the statute by the special calling on of the clergy / And this manner
writing causes some of the clergy of England to exalte them self far above
lay me^ / because they think yt they only be taken as the church / wherefore it
seems it is expedient for bri^gyng in of meekness to some spirytuall men /
that / that term church be not from hens forth used only for the clergy / but
that there as it has been used to be said: It is against the liberty of the
church / to say here after that it is against the liberty of the clergy or of
priests / and that they that witholde the duty of ye clergy do offend
against the clergy and not generally to say that they offend against the
church / in which word be comprised al christen people.

The sixte chapter.
IT is a right troublous thing to the people / to have two powers within the
realm / whereby they may be sued for one thing in several courts and by
several auctorities / and great expenses and unquietness to the people have
ensued thereby in many places / and one great hurt in that behalf may
lightly rise by reason of a Constitucyon that is in the second book / in the
title of Iugementes. And it begins. Item omnes illi et infra. Whereby among
other things / which I pass over for shortenesse. It is decreed / that the
vyolatours and disturbours of the immunitye and lybettyes of the church. That
is to say / that all such seculer persons as at any time here after shall
presume to withdraw any thing out of the houses or other places of
Archebysshoppes bysshoppes / or any other ecclesiastical persons against the
will of the lords or of them that be deputed kepers of the same / may be
conuented in the place where such trespass is done: Although they can not be
there found / and a special process is ordained in the same constitucyon /
against them that can not be found: and it is decreed forther / that all the
ordynaries and iuges of the prouynce of Canterbury shall in such case help the
one an other without any dyficultye in spedyng of citacyons and executyons of
the same / and all other laufull commandments in that behalf. And though the
said co^stitucyon seem to mean non other wise / but that the offenders
against the lybertye of the church / and that wrongfully take away the goods
of the church shall only be sued: yet it may be that by occasyon of an untrue
surmyse / he that is innocent and no offender may be grievously vexed and
troubled upon it / as if a spiritual man take away wrongefully the goods of
a lay man and bring the^ wtin the lands or possessions of the church / and
after the lay man fyndeth them there / and takes them again / as it is
lawful for him to do / yet it may be surmysed that he offended the said
constitucyon / so that the process shall go forth as straytly against him / as it
should do against him that were a very offender / and there is a legantine of
Octobon / that begins. For the sauegard etc. that is much of the same
effect as the said co^stitution is: For it is / that if a man violently or
enuiously carye away other men's goods / which arlayed up in holy place / or
shall help / counsayll / or co^sente thereto / shall be wrapte in the deed doing
in the bands of excommunication: from the which he shall in no wise be
assoyled / but he first make satisfactyon to the church which he has so
greatly iniuryed: And also to hi^ that has suffered loss and damage. And that
if such an excommunicate person monisshed by his dyocesan do not satisfye
within the time by him appointed / his lands shall be enterdit / which shall
not be released before due satisfaccyon. And it is certain / that the party
may also be sued in the kings court / which may be great vexation unto him
And though the law of the realm be / that if any such suit be taken in the
spirytuall court for any temporal thing / that as well the judge as the
party re^ne thereby into the praemunire. Yet for as much as some poor man may
be sued there: that is not able to sue a praemunire / it seems more reasonable /
clearly to break the said constytucyon and legantyne / than to suffer them to
stand any longer / for as long as they shall be suffered to stand / some
spyrituall men may hapely think / that the spyrituall Iurisdiccion is greatly
wronged / in that they may not be executed. And over that / some men think
the said constitucyon to be more parcyall and the less indifferent / because
that all the process thereof is made against seculer persons. For though
spyrituall men offend in the same degree of offense / as the seculer man does
yet the constitucyon gives no such special process against him. And also if
a man take goods wrongfully fro a poor man / the offense is most commonly
greater against god / than if he took them from any of the clergy / and yet
no remedy is provided for the poor man. But the clergy is in such laws
highlye regarded / and that in such a synguler and parcyall manner / that many
of the temporaltye think / that they force but little / how pore lay men be
ha^deled ne what wrong they have / so that they have none them self,

The seventh chapter.
Many laws and decrees have been made / affermi^ge that it is not lawful that
any priest should be put to answer before lay men. And great censures of
excommunicatyons be made against them that do it. And according to the said
decrees / there is a constitucyon in the second book / in the title of a
competent court: and it begynueth. It happens some time. etc. Where it is
recyted / that clerks / although they be not taken in the deed doing / or
convicted as evil doers / or suspected of crime or trespace / or wrong doing
to any man. Be nevertheless taken by the lay power / without any regard of
persons / and be laid in prison. And if they can not be found / that than
they be banisshed the realm / wherbi is me^t / yt they be outlawed. And it is
said there yt therein the liberty of the church is confounded and broken / when
a clerk is iuged of a lay judge / and it is therefore decreed / that if the
clerks that be so taken be known and be honest / yt tha^ as well the takers
as the wtholders of them shall be declared exco^itate / and the lands of the
takers and retayners of them to be enterdit till they be delivered / and
convenient satisfaction and amends made / but it is here to be noted / that
the constitution co^sydereth not / that it is as law full for iuges to here the
complaynte against them that be innocent / as against them that be gyltie /
till the matter be tried. And therefore if the complaynte be made of such
matters as they ought not for to be delivered to their ordinaries in / if they
were gyltie / than the ordynaries may not complain / though they be not
delivered where they be not gyltie till ye matter be tried / for it is not yet
known whether they be gyltye or not. And also / if it be in case yt they ought
to have priuelege and be delivered / yet if they be asked of officers that have
no power to deliver them / there is no cause why such officers that so deteygne
them / should be excommunycate / or their lands enterdyted. And therefore it
seems / that constytutyon far unreasonable in that point. And that clerks
ought not to be put to answer before lay men / I never saw any auctoryte
thereof / but laws of their own making which be therein of no strengh for the^
in this realm / except certain lybertyes yt they have i^ that behalf / by the
king and his progenytours / and by the laws and customs of the Realm /
which be right great and much favorable unto them / it they be well looked on.
And if they will needs claim such lybertyes by other ways / than by the
ki^ge and his laws / that they have them of: they deserve the less to have
the^ any longer. Than the seyde Constytucion says farther in the later end /
That if clerks restored to the church / be amerced by the seculer judge / for
any personal transgressyon / the prelates shall not compel the said clerks
to pay the same amerciame^t seeing they were not condemned by their own
iuges. And surely there is no cause / why a clerk for a personal
transgressyon should not be compelled to pay the amercyame^t / and that by the
kings Iuges as well as any lay man should / without speaking any thing to
the prelates in it: but yet as long as such laws stand vnrepelled: it will be
thought by many of the clergy that it is not so / and that the lybertye of the
church is greatly offended by it.

The eight chapter.
THere is a Constitucion in the second book in the title of a co^pete^t court
/ that begins / Circumspecte agatis et infra / wherein be diverse artycles
which be put in manner word for word among the statutes of this realm /
which the lerners of the law of this Realm have commonly among them / and
there is set as for a title of the said Co^stitucion these words following.
Certai^ things taken out of ye kings answers. etc. which nevertheless as I
suppose were never taken out of the kings answers / for they be in some
points clearly against the laws of this realm / as it is in that there is
recyted therm that prelates / for fornycacyon auowtry / or such other /
enjoin sometime corporal punyssheme^t / some time pecunarye / but I never
herd that prelates have authority to enjoin pain pecunarie for aduowtrye /
fornycacion / or such other. And also in the said constitucyon it is said /
that if the prelate or advocate of any church ask of the person any pencion
due to him / that all such pencyons ought to be asked in the spiritual court
/ and makes no exception of no manner of pencion / and the law of the realm
is clear / that Annuyteis and pencyons that begin by co^posycion or agreement of
the parties / and also by prescripcyon: belong to the kings court / and
therefore many have said / that the said treatise of Circumspecte agatis is no
statute / but that it was so named to be by ye prelates / and so it is said
that it was in the.xix. year of king Edward the third in a writ of Annuitie
/ and if it be so / than is it but only a bare constitucyon / And than it is
to the two points before rehearsed clearly void / because it is therein
dyrectely against the kings laws and his prerogatyf / and was also made
without his asse^t or any of his progenitors.

The nynth chapter.
THere is a constitucyon in the third book among the constitucyons De Clericis
non residentibus that begineth Audistis et infra wherein it appears that when a
priest takes two benefices with cure of soul without a plurality / that some
laws spiritual have iuged both to be void / and some have holden the last
to be void / as the legatyne of Octobon does: And than the said Constitucyon
decrees that he shall be content with the last benyfyce so optayned. But all
those laws / as it should seem by the said constitucyon / are to be
understand only of such benefyces / as any parsone had at that time without
plurality. And therefore the same co^stitution gothe farther / and decrees
that who so ever hensforthe receive many benefyces: all having cure of souls /
or otherwise uncompatyble / without the popes dispensatyon / or get them by
way of institutyon or co^mendam / or of custody / otherwise than the
constytution of Gregory made in the counsel of Lions does permytte: the same
in so doing to be deprived from all benefyces that he has so optayned. And
than as I take it / the law of this Realm is / that all benefyces so optayned
with out plurality / be clearly void with out any deprivation: For there be
in the laws of England / five causes of a voydaunce of a benifyce. That is to
say: Resygnation / death / deprivation / creation / and cessyon, And Creation
is / where a man that has diverse benifices is made a bishop: for than all his
benifeces by that creation be forchwith void. And where a man takes two
benifyces / without pluralytie they be void also. And yt is called Cessyon.
And if there must be thereupon a depriuatio^ before they be void / tha^ is the
deprivation the cause of the voydau^ce and not the Cessyo^. And tha^ there
should be but four causes of a voydaunce / howbeit I will not determynatly speak
in that matter / for they that be learned in the laws of yt realm can best
determine whether it be so or notte. And if the law of the realm be therein as
I have said / than can it not be changed by no constytucyon And tha^ if the
law be as I have said before / it follows thereupon also / that if a man take
two benifyces without a pluralytie / that both be forthwith void. But if he
than take ye third / that is not void For the two first were none of his /
when he took the third: But if he after take the fourth / than are the third
and the fonrth void also.

The tenth chapitre.
THe law of the Realm is that when a benefyce falls void / and the patron
presents an able and a mete clerk to the Ordynary / that the Ordynary is
bound upon the pain of a Quare impedit / and to be taken as a dysturber / to
admytte that clerk so presented / in as conuenyent time as he may / with out
any notable delay. And yet it is decreed by a constitucyon / that is in the
third book / in the title of clerks that be non resydent. And it begins:
Cum secundum apostolum et infra. That the bishop in no means shall dyfferre
above two months to admyt him that is presented / whereby it appears that the
meaning of the co^stitucion is / that he should have power so long to delay
the prsentement / if he will / and that is dyrectly against the law of the
realm: for he is bound to present such an encombent in as convenient time
as he can all notable delays set aparte as is aforesaid.

The eleuynth chapter
IF a bishop / abbot / priour / or any other spiritual man that has
temporal possessions / will alyeu any of the said possessions / there is an
order set by the kings laws / under what manner that Alyenation shall be made.

And if an alyenation be made according to that order / it shall be good and
perfect for ever. And none other has power to make any law to the contrary
thereof: And yet there is a constitucyo^ made in ye third book / which is in
the title of gifts of prebendes / and it begins: That the churches
indempnyties. etc. Whereby it is decreed that no Abbot / or Pryor / no
Archedeacon or Deane / ne any other inferior clerk / presume to selle / pledge
or morgage / or to give in fee of new or any other wise to alyenat the
possessions or profyttes of dygnytie / or church that is committed to them /
the form and manner of the Canons therein not observed / and that if any dare do
the contrary to this / both the thing that is done shall be of no value / and
also he that does it shall be depreued by his superior / except yt he will call
back again that he has alyenat withi a time prefyxed by his superior / and
the said Co^stitucion goth yet ferther and says: And he also that herefater
receives the church goods and after he is warned presumes to witholde the^
shall be stryken with the sword of exco^icacion: And in no wise shall he be
heled of yt wound till he have made restitucion: All which laws be dyrectly
against the kings prerogatyf and the laws of the Realm / wherefore it were
better that they were put away / than to be suffered to stand any longer / as
though they were of effect / and be not so indede.

The twelfth chapter.
IF a woman have goods and take a husband / all the goods that she has at
the day of Martagear her husbands. In so much that if she after that / make
a will and dye / that will after the laws of the realm is clearly void. And
if she ask license of her husband to make a will / and he will none give / he
offends not. But if a woman have goods as an executryce / and take a
husband / those goods be not the husbands. But he shall have them to the use
of the first will. And if the wife in that case / by the license of her husband
make a will and appoint another to be her executour and dye / that will is good
/ and that executour shall have those goods fro the husband. And shall have all
accyons as executour of executrice to execute the first will / and also if a
man be bound to a woman by an oblygacyon in an hundredth pounds / and after
she takes a husband / and she by the license of her husband makes her
husband or any other her executoure that will is good / and he or they so made
executours shall have an accyon upon that oblygacyon: And if no such will had been made / the husband ne no another should not have had any action upon that
oblygation / unless they take a letter of administration: as administratours
to the wife. And than there is a general co^stitucyon made in the third book /
in the title of Testamentes. which begineth: Calling to mind the statute. etc.
Whereby all they be accursed / that let the fre making of testamentes / of
ascriptis / and of other persons of seruyll condicyon. And of women also /
both married and unmarried / or of their own wyfes / or of other me^nes wives.
And all that constitucyon / as to women couerte that have no goods / but as
before appears / is clearly void and against the laws of the realm. And
also of villaynes / the law is, that if the lord make a general seaser of
the gods of his vyllayne / that all the vyllaynes goods be his. And of that
it follows that the will as to tho gods is void / and that neither there
cutoure nor ordinary may not wast any of tho goods for prouyng of the
testament. But if he were an executour / or if his lord made no seaser / than
he might laufully make a will and the will were good: But if there be such a
seaser / the will is void and of none effect: And than if the vyllayn have
none other goods / the will is void and needs no probate.

The.xiii. chapter.
THere be diverse good laws and Canons made which need not here to be rehearsed
/ whereby it is appointed how the goods of the clergy shall be dysposed in
charitable uses after their death And there be but few cases where a clerk
after tho laws should make a will. And the law of the realm is / that
clerks may make their wills as lyberally as any lay man may and that though
they have them for their spirytuall ministratyon. And the conuocacyon
perceiving the favor that the laws of the realm bears to clerks in that
behalf / have ordained that bysshoppes and other Ecclesiastical Iuges of the
prouynce of Cauntorburye / shall in no wise by any craft or color / meddle
with the goods of clerks benefyced / which may by the custom of England
make their testamentes, but shall suffer yt executours of their testamentes /
freely to dispose and order the same. And the seyde Constitucyon is in the
third book / in the title of testame^tes. And begins:

Ita quorundam et infra. And if the seyde Constitucyon / and the law of the
realm also in that point were reformed / And that it were appoin ted / that
the goods of clerks should be charttably disposed aff their death specially
such as they have by any spiritual benifyce / in such manner as should be
thought convenient by parlyame^t and convocation. It should seem to be a good
charitable deed.

The.xiiii. chapter.
IT apppereth so euydently in scripture / both in the old testament and in the
new that the people are bownde to find to their spirytuall ministers a
suffycie^t porcyon of their goods to live with that it needs not to express
here any certane auctoritye thereof / and for a recompense of that certain
portion / it is used in this Realm in manner universally / that the people shall
pay to their spiritual ministers the tenth part of their increase / which
tenth part many spiritual ministers clay me to be due to them by the law of
god. And therefore it is said in the third book / in the title of tithes and
oblatyons / that they that pay the eleuynth shefe for the tenth / dispyse ye
commandments of the old and new testament / the which pretense excludes
all customs and prescriptions that might be had contrary to the tenth part.
And sith it is well known / that it has been in late time / and also yet is in
question and in doubt: whether the tenth part be grounded upon the law of god
/ or upon the law of man. It seems that good charity would / that for the
clerynge of the conscience of many me^ / it shul de be clearly and plainly
determined whether it be so or not. And if it can be proved to be a moral
law of the old Testament / or to be assigned by any authorite of the New
testament / that the tenth part should be paid / I trust no man will resyst
it. And if it can not be proved that the tenth part is by the law of god tha^
of very right the old reasonable customs of payeng of tithes must be observed
/ as well by them that ask tithes / as by them that pay them / and than if
any man will deny to pay his predyall tithes after the old custom / or that
any curate would eske any more than right requires / It seems reasonable that
he be enforsed by compulcyon of laws to keep the custom. Howbeit some laws
seem not reasonable of payenge tithes: That is to say: that tithe shul de be
paid of the skynnes of the she pe that dye to the loss of the owner ne yet
that the tythynge of the odd lambs or calves should be set over till another
year / to the intent the curate in the second year may have a tenth lamb or
calfe / that in the same year could not have had it. Also it seems a very
sore law that servants should tithe for their wages / or that any man should
be sewed for preuy tethes / which lies not in outward proof / though it be
rightgood to pay such preuy tithes / as conscience requires. And yet it
seems to be the most strange law of all the other / that Persons / vycars /
and parysshe priests / shall upon a pain be compelled to sewe for tithes /
and that they may natsyt still if they list / and that is by a constitucion in
the third book that begins: For so much as through diverse customs. etc.
And all the other artycles before rehearsed appear in the Constitucyons in the
tytell of Tithes and Oblacyons: Not all in one peragraf / but in seue rall
peragrafes / as to the reder will appear / and if they were reformed it seems
it were a good deed: Also to bear the people in hand that the tenth part is
due to curates and spiritual mynysters by the immediate law of god / and it
not so / is a great offense for it is an affyrmaunce of an untruth / and many
persons have been compelled thereby to pay the tenthe part / contrary to the
old custom used in those parties where the curate has had ynow beside /
wherefore it seems better and the more charytable way for the ministers of the
church to confess if the truth be so that the.x part is grounded only upon
the custom and law of man / and that it began by the good assent of the people
/ tha^ to claim the.xx. perte to be due to the^ by the Immediate law of god /
and yet under that pretense a law is made in the said title of tithes and
oblacions / which begins: All be it god has promised. etc. Whereby it is
decreed / that tithes shall be paid generally of wode / and that is against a
statute of this realm / made in the xlv. year of the reign of king Edward
the third / whereby it is enacted / that a phibicion shall lie where a man is
impledid for tithe of wode of the age of.xx. year / by the name of Siluacedua /
As it had done in time past / and it seems not good to suffer a Constitucion
to stand so dyrectly against a statute / but it be openly declared why it ought
so to do.

The.xv. chapter.
IT is a daungerouse thing to fall in to the Censures of the church / and
therefore they would not be given but for great causes. And in such plain and
open manner / that every man that would with dilyge^ce take heed to it might
know whether he offended in that thing that they were given for or not: but
the more pytie is / the censures of the church be many times extended in such
a general manner / and in so many cases / that no man can well know how to
eschew them / and that appears many times in the co^stitutions / as wha^ men
be a cursed for breaking of the churches lyberties / and expresses not what
the liberties be. And in the said tytell of tithes and oblations / in the later
end of the constitution / which begins. Men are so blinded. etc. Is this
general law made / that all and synguler / such as work wicked inventions
and deceytes / by the which the rightes or the aprobate custo mes / or the
lyberties of the church be in any thing dimynisshed / or suffer any injury /
damage / or grefe / contrary to the churches liberty / shall be wrapped in the
bond of the great exco^municatyon / their absolucyon reserved specially to
their diocesan / the point of death only excepted. And in a constitucion which
is in the fifth book / in the title Contra grauamina etc. And begins: Cum
malum et infra. It is recyted / that all they be acursed that do maliciously
presume to take away fro chirches their right or through malice / or contrary
to justice do intend to break or distourbe the lybertyes of the same / and
than there upon the makers of ye said law say farther thus / whereby say they
/ we perceive all them to be tied in the danger and in the bond of
excomunicacyon / that obtain letters fro any lay court to let or hinder the
process of spirytuall iuges in all such causes as hy the verdicte of holy
Cannons be known to appartayne to the iuges of the spiritual court / and the
said letters are to be understand as it seems of the kings prohibycions.
And who can have knowledge what parteyneth to the spirytuall court by the
Canons / which be so many and so great in nombre that few can come to the
knowledge of them. And these laws be so uncertain that it will be hard for
any man / to know whether he be in the danger of them or not / And where
ignorance shall excuse him that is so accursed / and where not it is a right
great doubt / and such things as touch the people so nygh as such
excomunicatyons do / would be brought as nigh as reason could drive it in to a
more clear knowledge / than they be yet as me seems.

The.xvi. chapter
IT is ye law of this Realm / that if a man recover his presenteme^t. in a
Quare impedit / In the Kings court against a another that claymeth the
patronage.

And a gaynst his incumbent / that ye playntyffe shall have a writ to the
bishop to admytte his clerk / whether the incumbent of the disturbour be
admytted before the writ come or not: upon the pain of a Quare non amisit /
and of making of a fine to the ki^ge. And if the deffendau^tes might have
pledyd plenartye / and did not / they lost the advantage of it: and the
clerk must be removed. And yet it seems that there is a constitucyon made to
the contrary thereof in the third book / and in the title of patronage / which
begins: When one optaineth in the kings law etc. For it is said there /
that if such a writ come to the bisshoppe / and the benifyce be not void /
that the prelate for his excuse shall show unto the king or his Justices /
that by cause such benifyce is not void that he ca^ not fulfill the kings
commandment. And certain it is that / that is no excuse in the laws of the
realm. And than the said Decree: somewhat to save the title of the Playntyfe /
as it thinks / gothe further and says: that it shall be lefull to the patron
in that case to present the possessoure again / that by that means / the
title of the patro^ that has optayned / may be declared more plainly after:
But how can the patron present the same possessour again / if he may not be
removed / as the seyde constytucyon prete^deth that he may not: And therefore if
he should present him again / it should be rather a confyrmatyon of his first
presentment / and a hurt to his own title / than any furtheraunce of it /
for the possessour should have the benifyce still by the first presentmente /
and not by the presentme^t of the patron / and so at the next time of
auoydance / the same dysturbour should by reason of that presentment present
again. And of that it should follow also / that if a dysturboure could find
the means that his encombent should be admytted / that he should not be
removed during his life / though the right patron recovered after in the
kings court / and that were clearly against justice / and therefore the
ordinary in that case is bound by the laws of the realm / upon his ieopardye
/ to amoue the clerk of the disturbour / as is said before: But if the
church be full of the presentment of an other patron / than of him that the
Quare impedit is brought against: Or if the ordynary have presented by laps /
where he is not named in the action as a disturbour / than he may laufully lay
tho causes for his excuse / But for the plenartie of the same encumbent /
against whom the accyon is brought he can make no excuse / and there is another
decree in the third book of like effect / as the said first decree is: and
it begins: Esurientes auaricie etc. Wherein there be some things dyrectely
against the writtes of Quare impedit / and quare non admisit / as to the reder
will appear. And it seems that it is not good / that such laws should be
suffered to stand that be so dyrectly against the laws of the Realm / seeing
that it perteyneth to the king and his laws to order the right of all
presentementes with in this Realm.

The.xvii. chapter.
IT is an old law and custom of this Realm that if a felon or a murderer
flee to a church and ask sentwary there that he shall have it / and that than
he shall remain there forty days / and no man to be prohibit for those
fortye days to bring him mete and drink but aft the forty days meat and
drink shall be prohibyte him / till he will yield him self to the kings
laws. And he that tha^ will bring him any meat or drink offends the law /
and in the mean time while he is so in sentwary: it is laufull for the to
wnship where he is: to set sure watch and keeping about him that he shall not
escape / lest they should be punisshed against the king for the escape. And yet
in a constitucyon prouincyall / that is in the third book / in the title of the
churches liberty. And begins: Porro et infra. Among other things / it is
decreed / that none shall be set to watch them that take the church or the
church yearde for sentwary / and if there be / that as well the kepers / as
they yt set them there / shall be driven away in form of law by the sentence
of excommunicacyon. And the co^stitucion is further / that the church shall
defend them / whom the Canons only command to be defended. And all this
Constitucyon is voyed because they that made it had no power to make it / for
it was made upon this pretense / that such sentwary is granted to churches by
the laws Canon / where in deed it is granted by ye kings progenytours / and
the laws of his realm / in favor and honor of churches / and therefore it
has apperteyned always to the kings laws to determine in what case a man
shall have sentwary in a church and in what not / and how he shall be ordered wha^
he is there / how long he shall tarry there / and if he will abjure how he
shall be ordered when he has abiured / and it is daily seen that the
parliament appoynteth who shall have such sentwarye / and who not / and
puts some fro it as they think reasonable: and it has caused great
unquietness / that the clergy claymeth such sentwary to be by their auctoritye
/ and for a good reformacyon it would be prohibited that they should not do so
herafter. And a like pretense the clergy makes / when a man is admytted to
his clergy: for they pretend that / that privilege of clergy is granted to
them that can read by the laws of the Cannons. And that they be Iuges who
shall be so admytted / and who not. And therefore they say that the ordynarye
is there present by auctoritye of the canons / to accept such as he shall
thike to read as clerks / and to refuse them / that he thiketh do not so. And
when they be admytted to their clergy / they say they be committed to ye
bisshops prison as to him / by whose favor and power they have their clergy.
And nevertheless / the truth is that they have their clergy in such cases
by the king and his laws / and his Iuges shall determyn where a man ought to
have his clergy / and where not. For if the ordinary admytte one as a clerk
that is none the kings iuges shall set a fine upon him / and also shall give
judgment upon the ptie / and if the ordynary refuse one that ye iuges think
redeth as a clerk they shall allow him as a clerk and also set a fine upon
the ordynary for his refusing / and at every general jail delyuery / the
ordinary upon a pain of a fine to be set upon him by the kings iuges is
bound to be thereto give his attendance without any warnyng / and at a special
jail delynery with a warnyng. and when he is in the bishops prison / the
bishop is bound to keep him safe / and not to suffer him ot make any
purgatyon / but according to the kings laws / and if he do / he shall be
punys shed for the escape. And if the king pardon him / that is so in the
bysshoppes prison / the bishop is bound to deliver him upon the kings pardon
/ whethy it appears suffyciently / that he is there by the kiges power and
auctority. And yet many spu^all men prete^de the contrary / And therefore if ye
matter and other like were set in a clear way it should cause great
quietness / and though they that have their clergy have it by the kings laws
/ as is before said / and not by the law Canon / yet are the Ordynaries bound
in conscience to keep them that be so committed to them for their clergy / as
favorably as they ought to do if they were brought thither by their own
auctorite.

The.xviii. chapter.
IT is an old law in this realm / yt when Bysshoppes die / the king shall
have the temporaltes during the vacacyon / and many statutes be made how the
same te^poralties shall be saved fro wast and destruction during the vacacyon /
and that the kings exchetours shall not sell the vnderwodes / ne shall not hunt
i^ their perkes or warens / nor fysh in their fisshynges nor do any wast / to
the preiudyce of the houses or of ye deane and the Capitre / Prior or supprior
/ and that the Prior and supprior may take it to ferme if they will. And for
as much as in the time of such va cacyons of Bysshopprykes / and of abbeys
and Priories / when they be not taken to ferme. Hurt has come sometime to the
said possessions by the defaulte of the kings officers / where upon the new
electes might have good remedy by the law of the realm if they would / yet
the spirttualtye as it seems / not contented so to do / but pretendynge that
by laws made by them self / they would have suffycye^t remedy without asking
any aid of the king / have made a law in that case as it appears in the
third book in the title of churches lyberties / in the chapter which
begins. Where the king. etc. which chapter shall be rehearsed hereafter
word for word / that every man may se theffecte thereof. And it begins thus:
When the king has the custodye of Cathedral or Conuentual churches /
although acordinge to the chartour of lyberties granted to the church by the
king and his predecessors / he ought to receive only certain profytes and
certain seruyces and that without the distreyninge of men / and destruceyon of
things. It chau^ceth nevertheless that his baylyffes through imoderate
tallages and exaccyons / do both vyolently take away the churches tenau^tes
goods in time of vacation / and also destroy the parkes / woods / store poles
/ houses / and scatereth the goods abroad they evil entreat the pore and
stretch their hands not only to those thing; which they were wont to optayn by
reason of custody: But also unto the goods of them that remain in life / that
is to wit / to that blade and store and such other / wherewith the chapter and
couente ought to be sustained: Yea / and presume to take other things like
wise / which by reason of Baronye / can in no wise apptayne unto him: As
tithes and oblations belonginge / and apperteynig to churches appropriate unto
bysshoprik es and monasteries and other like things. Therefore to withstand
this evil (...) we ordeyne / that as soon as the kings escheters and
baylyffes shall have entered such custody / the prelat es which have
iurisdiccyon / shall openly and solemply forbid all the said baylyff es
generally / that under pain of ercomunication they attempt no such thig; But
if they do contrary / let it be openly declared / that they be fallen in to the
sentence of exco^tcation decreed against the violatours and troublers of ye
churches lyberties until they have made a co^petent ame^des / for the hurts
and injuries. which sentence if they despise after such denuncyation. Let
process be made against the^ by interdiccyons and other penalties ordained
against such wrong doers / and except the king admonisshed thereof make
competente restitucyon / or cause the things so taken to be restored and
amended. Let process be made against him / as it is decreed in other cases
touching the king / and the self same things which are before decreed for
the king and his minysters we will to be observed in other inferyour lords /
if peradventure / the custodye come to them. Thus far goth the seyde
constitucyon / whereby it appears / that though the parties grieved might in
such case have good remedy by way of peticyon to the king or against his
bailyffes by the order of his laws: that yet the clergy not content with
those remedies have taken upon them to make the seyde constitucyon to declare
that such officers be not only fallen in to the sentence of excomunication
decreed against the vyolatours of the churches lyberties / but also that if
they make not a competent amends that process shall be made against the^ by
interdiction / and yet not content with such extreme laws against officers /
they proceed farther / and decre / that if the king him self monysshed make
not competent restytucion / that than process shall be made against him / as is
decreed in other cases touching the king / and what an entrepryse that is to
make process against the king / that ought first to sewe to him by peticyon it
is apparent / and though the said law will that the king should be first
monysshed / yet that monycyon can not be taken for any suit by peticion / but
rather for a suit by compulcion / and surely sithe there be suffycient laws
ordained by parliament for a remedy in such case / it seems some what to be
meruecyled why the clergy would also make this Constitucyon / as though their
possessions had nothing be favored by the king nor his Realm / and the laws
that be made for the preseruacion of such temporaltes in the time of vacation
without wast or destruction be these. First in the statute of Magna carta
the.v. chapter: It is ordained that the Gardeyn as long as he has the custody
/ shall sustain Houses / parkes / waters / and mildames. etc. perteynyng to
the land of the issues of the same / and shall yield the^ to the heir at his
full age / enstored with plowes / and all other things at the leest as he
received them / and it is farther enacted / that all these things shall be
obscrued also / of the vacacions of Archebysshoppes / bishops / abbathyes /
prories / churches / and dygnities that to the king belong / except only that
those dygnities may not be sold and that statute of Magna carta is confermed by
the statute of Westminster prim^ the.xxi. chapter. And after in the.xiiii. year of
King Edward the third / the.iiii. and.v. chapter. It is provided that no
exchetour nor none other keeper of the vacations of the temporalties / shall not
sell the vnderwod / nor hunt in the parkes / warennes / nor fysshe / ne do wast
nor destruction to the piudyce of ye houses And that the deanes and the
chapiters or superior priours / or suppriours may take them to ferme if they
will / so that ye exchetour shall not meddle. And this statute was made at the
especyall desire of the clergy / wherewith at that time they were very well
content. And upon these statutes accyons may be taken / if they that be grieved
list to co^playn. And what needs it tha^ to make this co^stitucio^ / as though
no remedy had be^ provided for the^ before: And to say the truth / I have herd
of none yt has had cause notably to co^playn in ye behalf / how beit I speak
not this to thentent I would have it appear the defaut in makige of this
co^stitucion and such other to be in the prelates that now be / as though they
would process should be made against the kige / for they were not preuy to the
making of the said Constitucyon. And therefore if they will assente to the
refourmynge thereof / there can no defaute be assygned in them.

The.xix. chapter.
IF a man be excommenged / and he will not submytte him self to the judge / ne
desire absolucion but will obstinatly stand still so accursed / the spyrituall
iurysdiccyon has no power to do any thing further against him. But if the
party thereupon stand still accursed fortye days / and the bishop certifye
the king thereof / than the custom of the realm is in favor of the
spyrituall Iurisdiccyon / that the king shall awarde a writ out of his
Chauncerye / which is called a writ De exco^icato capiendo / which shall be
directed to the sherif where the party is / whereby the sheryf shall be
commanded to iustifye him by his body / till he have made amends to holy
church. etc. And when he is so in prisone. If he by his frent^es offer to
the bishop suffycient caucyon or gage / to stand to the commandment of
the church / and obey the law. And he refuse to take it / than the law and
custom of the realm is / that the king shall send to the sherif a another
writ / which is called a writ De cautione admitte^da co^maundynge him thereby to
aduertyse the bishop to take the caucyon. And if he refuse to take ites than
to deliver the party out of prison / whereupon as it appears in the third
book / in the title of the churches lybertye / in a Co^stitucion that begins

Seculi principes. etc, The clergy complayneth greatly / for that the (...) in
that case shall be so delyured / no satisfaction made neither to the church nor
to the party and they complain as though the ecclesiastical office were
thereby confounded and made vein / while the lay Iuges that have not the keye
of power and knowledge / which lay men are so straytly bound to follow and
obey / that the auctorite of examinacyon Iugynge and commaundyng is utterly
forboden them in all such things as apperteyneth to the spiritual
iurisdiccion / and yet go they about as the said Constitucyon says: To cut
down another man's corn. Where upon it is to be noted that the lay iuges of
whom the Constitucion speaks in this place are to be understand the king him
self or his chauncelour / for there is non other judge in this case that
medeleth we the matter / and if the clergy would that ye king should not have
auctorite to examyne / judge and command in this case / than their
iurisdiccion could go no ferther / and therefore that the king does in
taking of such an excomunicat person / he does it at the desire of the
bishop / and when he delyuereth him again according to the custom of his
Realm / because the bishop refuses a reasonable caucyon / he has nothing
hurt the spirytuall iurisdiccyon / ne takes upon him the keys of the power
or knowledge that appteyneth to it? he yet he goth not about to cut down any
other man's corn / for when the party is so let out of prison for the
refusing of the said caucyon / he is yet accursed still as he was before and
so shall he stand / till he so demean him self that he may obtain his
absolucion. But if the king pretended that by that delyuery the party should
be also dyscharged of his exco^municacyon. Than might the clergy somewhat more
reasonable co^pliane that the King medeled with the keys of power and knowledge
/ and that he cut down a another man's corn. Butte as this case is they
have no cause so to complain for all that he does in this matter concerning
their iurisdiccyon / is either to do them good / or else no hurt. And so it
appears / that they complain without a cause / and yet the co^plainte is
ha^deled under such a facyon that it might make some that should happen to read
it / think that the spyrituall Iurisdiccyon were therein grievously offended.
And yet / when the matter is thoroughly looked upon / it appears that it is not
so. Also in the same Co^stitucyon / a little before the clause that is
remembered before / the same Constitucyon says thus: And some time when a
surmyse is made to the king / that the seyde parties imprisoned be
excomunicated for such causes as apperteyneth not to the spirytuall court /
that than have the sheryffes in commandment / that if he be excomunycate and
imprisoned for such cause and none other / to cause the bisshops to deliver
them shortly / and no credence or faith / says the seyde co^stitucyon is
given to the process of the spirytuall Iuges upon such cause of
exco^municacyons / and upon those words / it is to be noted / that the said
co^stitucyon in ye clause mistaketh the law of the realm very far / for
the law is / that such an excomunicate person shall never be put in to the
bisshops prison / but in to the sheryffes prison / and than to have a
commandment to the sheryffe / that he shall cause the bishop to deliver him
out it stands natte with reason / for they can not deliver him out of prison
that they have not the keeping of / and as they mystake the law of the Realm
in that point / so they do in many other in the said Constitucyons / as it
will appear if they be well and thoroughly looked upon / and it is somewhat to be
meruayled / that the Constitucyon says / that no credence nor faith is given
to the process of the spyrituall Iuges / upon such causes of excomunicatyon:
for upon their process and certifycat the party is arested / and than if it
appear after by the process / that the party is imprisoned for such cause as
appertains natte to the spirytuall court / than does the king well / if he
command the sheryf to deliver him out of prison / and he is also of Justice
bound to do it. And over that / if a man were excomunicate for that thing
that apparteyneth not to the spirytuall court / and after such a process were
showed / whereby it should appear / that the matter should apparteyn to the
spirytuall court / and the party will auerre the contrary: what credence
should be given to the spirytuall process in that behalf. I will not take upon
me to determyne but commytte it to other / how be it it should seem reasonable
that the party should have auerreme^t against it. And after in another
Constitucyon / that is in the fyfth book / in the title of the sentence of
excomunicatyon / and begins: Furthermore it happens sometime. etc. Among
other things that be much like to the constitucio^ before rehearsed / it is
decreed that if the writ of Excomunicato capiendo be required / and in
especial where it ought to be awarded by the laudable custom of the realm /
and it be not granted / that the king must be warned by the prelate / that
it may please him to grant the said writ / which if he will not do all his
cities / castles / boroughes and villages which he has within that dyoces
shall be e^terdicted / and so an interdiccio^ is deryuyed against him by occasion
of the favor that his own laws / and the custom of his realm has given
unto the clergy. And I think verily / that if ye rulers would take the pain
to look upon the said Constitucions / they would not suffer them to stand
unreformed / for great charges and expenses be like to follow upon
excomunications / as long as they shall be suffered to stand in effect.

The.xx. chapter.
IF a Parson or a vycar suffer their houses to be in decay / and dye: It is
reasonable that his executours should repair them / if they have goods
suffycie^t to do it / but yet it seems yt the spiritual jurisdiction has no
power to compel the executours to make the reparacyons / for it is a thing
concerning waste / that is te^porall / and parteyneth merely to the kings
court / and the judgment of it concerns the payment of money by the
executours / which the spirytuall court has no power to enioyn ye executour
to. And if they do / they run thereby in to the praemunire / and therefore it
were better that a remedy were provided in such case by parlyament / than that
so great danger should hang upon the prelates / and also upon the parties
that should sue according to the Constitucyo^s made in that behalf / whereof
one is in the third book / in the title of building of churches. And
begins If the person of any church. etc. And the other is in ye same title
/ and begins: We ordeyne that no inqsicyon. etc.

The.xxi. chapter.
IT is resyted in a Constitucyon / that is in ye third book / in the title of
churches liberties / and begineth thus: For as much as the lay be forboden.
etc. That lay men be forboden / as well by the laws of god as of man / to
order and dyspose the church goods: by the which term churches goods /
spirytuall men understand / as well lands and tenementes / as chatels
personels. And I suppose / that there is no law of god that does prohibyt
lay men to dyspose and determyne the right of lands and goods of the church:
but that it most properly apperteyneth to them / and not to the clergy. And
that seems to appear. Luc. xii. When our lord refused to deny the
enheritaunce bytwexte the two brethern. And it is to suppose / that as he
refused to medell with the judgment of such temporal matters him self / that
he would his appostels and discyples / to whom the clergy be successors
should do the same. And as it seems he would also that the Emperor that time
being / and his laws should do it and not he. Than the same Constitucyon
gothe further / and fyndeth a defaute at parysshens / that take trees growing
in churchyeardes some time to their own uses / and sometime to the use of the
churches. And it byndeth all such doers in the sentence of excomunicatyon /
comprehended in a legatyne of Octobon / and in a constitucion made by the
counsel of Oxforde / against the vyolatour of the churches lybertye. And it
decrees further / that they shall be put from the company of the faithful / to
their confusyon and shame / till they offer and make an effectual ame^des. And
this is a right sore and an extreme law: for as I take it the trees in the
churcheyarde ought to stand still for the deffence of the church / and of the
chauncell as long as they may stand / with out they be felled by the asse^t /
as well of the Parsone or Vycar / as of the paryshe / and if the Parson or
Vycar agree that the parisshens shall fell the^ to the reparations of the
church / I think they do right well: And if the parisshens agree that the
Parson or Vycar shall have them to the reparacyons of the chauncell / I think
that they do well also / but if a tree in the Churcheyarde fall down by
tempest / or otherwise / who than shall have the tree it is more doubt / for
thereupon it is to se in whom the freholde of the churcheyarde is: How be it
the grass has always by a general custom parteyned to the Parson or Vycar /
and I will no ferther speak in that matter at this time / but that I think
verily there is no case reasonable / why so hard and extreme a Constitucion
even to their confusion and shame that take such treis should be made against
the parisshe^s in that case / though they take ye trees without assente of the
parsone or vycare / specially if they take them to the use of the church.

The.xxii. chapter.
Few men may do more good than a good precher may. and few men may do more
hurt than an evil precher may. And there be many laws Canon / and also
Constitucyons prouincyall made who shall have auctoritye to preche / and who
not / which to eschew tedyousnesse to the reders / I will omytte for this time
/ excepce only a Constitucyon prouincyall / that is in the fyfth book / in the
title of Heretykes / and Secsmarykes. And it begins.

Reuerendissime sinado et infra, Whereby it is decreed / that no seculer or
reguler not auctorised by the law or other wise specially priuyleged to preach
the word of god / shall take upon him the office or use of prechi^g except he
first present himself to the Dyocesan / and be found apt and mete / and be
than sent to preach by him / and that they which afferme the^ self to have
special priuylege / shall really exhibyt and show their privilege to the
Parsone or Vycare. etc. And they that pretend to be sent by the dyocesan /
shall in likewise show the letter of the Diocesan under his great seal: And
than the said Constitucyon goth further and says thus. The perpetual Curate /
we understand to be sent by the law / to the place and people of his own
cure. Natwithsta^dynge / if it happen any such to be suspended fro such
prechi^g by the Dyocesan / or by any other superyour for errors or heresies /
which is pretended that he has preched affermed / or thought: than may he in
no wise meddle with prechynge in our Dyocyse / until he have purged him self of
that defaute at the just arbyterment of him that did suspende him / and that he
be laufully restored again unto prechynge of which his restitucion he shall
have letters and carry them with him in all places where he shall afterward preche
/ and shall really exhibit the same in manner and form aforsayd. Thus far is
of the said co^stitucion: and as me seems it is no reasonable cause / to
prohibyt any man / specially a curat that has been admytted to preach: that he
shall not preach for errors or heresies / which is pretended that he has
preched / affermed / or taught: for it may be pretended yt a man has affermed
preched and also taught heresies / and yt yet it is not so in deed: for every
pretense is not always true and if there be no such heresy preched nor taught
tha^ there is no defaut whereof he ought to pourge him self. Than the seyde
Constitucyon goth yet further / and says: That if any precher dispyse this
wholesome statute / and do prech on his own heed again: saying obstinatly in
word ordede / declaryng that the seyde sentence of excomunicatyon may not be
decreed and commanded in the church in the persons of their prelates / if
they will not therefore abjure / they shall be taken for heretykes / and they:
goods to be forfayte by the law. and ferthermore it is decreed / that ye
clergy or people shall admytte none to prech / except they first make a proof
of their auctorisynge: And if they do otherwise / the place where the prechynge
is / shall be under church enterditynge in the doing. These be very strayte
laws. And they prohibyt such persons to preach: as peradventure would preach
well and catholycally / and that would happily touch somewhat concerning the
Ordinaryes or their iurisdictyons / which they would not gladlye have spoken
of. And therefore I hold it a very necessary thing for the rulers to look well
upon this matter / to se it set in such order / that nothing be don against the
law of god therein. And I suppose verily / that the rulers be bound in
conscience to do it / and in that the Constitucyon decrees / that their goods
shall be forfayt / that is a void decre: for they had none auctoritye to
decree upon any goods. and the forfyture of the goods / for heresye is ordered
by the statute made in the second year of king Henry the fyfth.

The.xxiii. chapter.
IT is decreed in the seyde fyfth book / in the title of heretykes and
scismatikes / in the constitucion that begins. None may presume. etc. That
none shall dispute openly or preuely of the Artycles determined by the church /
as they be contained in the decrees Decretals and Constitucyons prouyncyall or
Sinodals / except it be done to have the true understanding of them. Ne may
call in to doubt / the auctoritye of the same decrees Decretals / and
Constitucyons prouyncyal or the power of the making of them And specially
concernyge the adoracyon of the gloriouse cross / worshippynge of saints
Images or pylgrymages making / unto their places and relyques: or against
oaths to be made after the used manner in causes accustomed in both courts /
that that is in the spirytuall court and temporal: but that the^sforth all
shall teach comenly and preach / that the cross and Images of the crucyfyxe
and other Images of saints ought to be worshypped in the memory and honor of
them / whom they figure and represent. etc. And here it is to be noted / that
the resonynge and dysputynge of the Artycles of the faith be not only
prohibyte / but the dysputynge of the Articles / determined by the church / as
they be contained in the decrees decretals and Constitucyons prouincyall or
Synodals / and prohibiteth not expressly the resonynge of the Artycles of the
faith / Howbeit in that the Constitucyon excepteth / that a man may reason
such things to have the true understanding of them it seems very reasonable:
but that a man may not call in to dout the auctoritye of the same decrees
decretals or Constitucyons / or the power of making of them. I se not how it
stands with reason or any manner of indyfferencye / that that should be
prohibyt: for there be undoubtedly many of them that the makers had no
auctoritye to make / and that be also dyrectly against the king and his
prerogatyue / and no cause why they should be so / whereof some be remembered in
diverse of these chapiters. And I suppose verilye / that the most part of all
the clergy would confess the^ self that it is so / if they were examyned upon
it. And as to the said Article / that Images should be worshipped. I can not
perceive how it should stand with the laws of god / that the Image self
should be worshypped / howbeit the authorityes that cause me to say so I will
not touch at this time. And I think farther that it were right expedyent /
that children when they come to the years of discrecyon / should be dilygently
admonisshed / that they shall not esteem images in such manner as they did in
their childhod. And furthermore to say that he that affermeth or techeth that
oaths to be made upon the holy gospels / incases in the law expressed / may
not lawfully be given in both courts of all that have entrest to give them /
shall run in to the pains of heresy: as it is decreed there in the said
Constitucyon that he should do / me seems it can not stand with the order of
justice / for though his saying therein be untrue / yet it is no heresye: for
it is not prohibyt by the law of god to say it. And upon this point / that is
to say / that the clergy has made things heresy / that be none by the law
of god / and that they have put them in execucyon / have risen great grudges
against the clergy. And therefore if the clergy would decree that if a man
would obstynatly say / that no man ought to be tenant by the curtesye in this
realm / though his wife were seized in fee during the spousayls / and though
they had issu or that the enheritance in this realm ought not to dyscende to
the eldest son should therefore be taken as an heretyke / yet were he no
heretyke in deed / though he said untruely / for every error is not heresy.
And so in this case / though a man said untruly / that none ought to swear /
neither in the spirytuall court nor temporal yet were he no heretic. And I
thike further / that if the clergy according to the seyde Constitucyon
conuycted a man in the case / or the other cases before remembered / or any
other like of heresy / and delivered him to the lay court / that the king
might not by his laws grant forth his writ. De heretico comburendo, For as I
take it / that writ ought not to be granted but for heresy / whereby a man
falls fro the faith and fro the truth of holy scripture. and over that /
what it should mean / that the said Constitucyon makes it heresy to say that
no man aught to swear in the temporal court. I can not redyly tell / but it
were to the entente / that by mayntenaunce of oaths in temporal courts /
occasyon might be the rather taken to maintain oaths in spiritual courts /
howbeit as I have somewhat touched in the fourth chapyter / some of the oaths
that customably be given in the spirytuall courts / as to inquire of ye
defautes and excesses of the people / ar unreasonable as I have partly touched
the causes in the said fourth chapter.

The.xxiiii. chapter.
THere is a Constitucyon in the fyfth book / in the title of ma^sleye^ge / that
begineth: It is inacted by prouisyon. etc. whereby it is decreed thus: if
patrones / advocates / or Feodatories / (...) vicelordes / through myscheuouse
boldness presume to sley or meyme by the^ self or by other / any Parsone of
church Vycare / or Clerk of the same church / that they shall utterly lose
patronage / aduocation / fee and vycelordshyp which they had in the church.
And their posterite in no wise shall be received in to the college of clerks
unto the fourth generatyon / neither shall obtain the honor of dignytie or
Prelacye in reguler house. And this we will / often times to be denounced in
the church. Thus far goth the Constitucyon / which is very uncertain in it
self / in somoche that it is hard to tell what was the very meaning of them
that made it. And if they me^t / yt as soon as a patro^ had slain a parsone /
a Vycare or a clerk in the church / that forthwith the patronage should be
forfayt / than they mystoke the law of the realm very far / for such
enheritau^ce shall never be forfayt by the deed / till Judgment be given upon
it. And furthermore it is no doubt / but that of such temporal inherytaunce
/ they had no power to make any such laws / that it should so be forfayt. And
if their meaning were / that if he were after the sleyng atteynted at the
common law / that than he should forfayte the patronage: Than the Constytucyon
neded little to have been made / for so he should have done before / wherefore
the Constitucyon is therein every way void. And to the other point of
mayminge / it is certain that though a patron mayme the Parsone / Vycare / or
Clerk in a church / that he shall not forfayte the patronage / though he be
thereof attaited / for there is no enheritaunce forfayte by no such offense.
And the same law that is of a patronage is of all the other things that be
above specifyed in the seyde Constitucyon. And than that the heirs of them
that do any such act shall not be received in to no dygnytie or prelacye of
reguler house / unto the fourth generatyon that byndeth not in the laws of the
realm: for if the patron presented the heir of them that did the deed / and
that is also within the fourth generatyon to a priorye presentable of his
gift. And the Ordynarie refused because of the seyde Constitucyon / it is no
dout, but that a Quare impedit should lie against him / and he should be
admytted: And if the Ordynarie after depreued him by reason of the said
Constitucyon / the patron might present the same self parsone again / and so
should be a great confusyon betwyxte the said laws / and though such matters
be not much like to come in ure: yet to see such things stand / whereof
hurt may come and no good. I think it is not good to be suffered / for many
reders may happily think it is even as the Constytucyon speaks / and yet in
deed it is not so.

The.xxv. chapter.
THere is a Co^stitucyon in the fifth beke / and in the title of canonycall
purgatyo^ / that begineth Statuimus et infra whereby it is decreed yt if clerks
have made their canonycall purgatio^ upon such things as was laid and
obiecred against them / and that yet nevertheless the lay power takes their
goods or with holds the^ / that such takers and witholders shall be compelled
unto restitucyon of the seid goods by censures of ye church. And the
canonycall purgation yt is spoken of in the said co^stitucyon / seems to be
the purgation of clerks co^uycte / that be committed to ye bisshops pryso^ and
there make their purgation / and that the prelates meant at the makige of the
said constitucyon / that if they did so / that they should have their goods
that they had when they were conuycie. But I take the law of the realm to be /
that clerk co^uycte shall forfayte his goods. And if it be so / that
constitucyon can not help it by no manner of purgatyon that can be made by the
clergy.

The.xxvi. chapter.
PRelates have done very much in time past to brige it about that clerks
should not be put to answer before lay men. And because clerks sometime
offended in hunting in forrestes and parkes / whereof many times such great
dyspleasure was taken / that amends must needs be made. The Prelates made a
law to appoint how the ame^des should be made in such case by their own
authority / so that there should need no suit be taken in ye behalf at the
kings law / and the remedy was this: As it appears in the fifth book / in
the title of a clerk that is an hunter in a constitucyon / which begins: We
ordeyne that if any clerk. etc. That if the clerk were conuycted thereof
before the Ordinary or confessed it / that than the Ordinary should make
redemptyon thereof in his goods / and satisfye the party grieved. And if he had
no goods / that tha^ his bishop should grievously punissh him. And surely if
any Ordynarie did execute the seyde Constitucyon / and put the clerk to
answer of the offense before him / and after made redemptyon of his goods
according to the Constitucyon / he should run clearly in to the praemunire.
And furthermore in case that the clerk have no goods / ne can not be found /
he shall be outlawed at the co^mone law / not withsta^dynge any punisshment
that the Ordynaries could make upon him. And yet it seems that the makers of
the said Constitucyon would have prevented that outlagarie if they could. And
now let every man judge what goodness can come by the seid Constytucyon / or
why it should be suffered to contynew any longer / sith it can do no good to
prelates or clerks / ne to none other.

The.xxvii. chapter.
THere is a Constitucyon in the fyfthe book / and in the title of pains / that
begins: Eterne sanctio voluntatis et infra. Wherein it is recyted a monge
other things / that it oftetymes happens Archebisshops / bishops / and
other inferior prelates to be called to seculer judgment / for such thiges as
be known merely to apperteyne to their office / and to the spirytuall court:
whereof I shall recyte part / and part I shall omytte to eschew tedyousnesse.
First it is recyted / that if prelates parchaunce have amitted or not amytted
clerks to churches vacant or not vacant: or have excomunicated their
subjects / have enterdited / have had cognicion of causes spiritual / as of
bounds of parisshes / which as it is said there may in no wise pertayne to the
seculer court / or if they have taken examinacion of the defaultes of their
subjects as of partury / promise brekyng / troublynge of the church lyberties
/ seeing that the violatours thereof be by the sentence made upon the kings
charter excomunicate in the deed doing: or if they hold plee bytwyxt the lay
complaynyng and Clerks defending in personal accyons upon contractes or as
contractes / upon trespass or as trespass. All which matters with diverse other here
omitted is pretended there in the said Constitucion to be mere spirytuall / and
I have here recyted these artycles thereof / that it may the better appear
whether they be mere spiritual or not / And it is euydent ynow that diverse of
them are mere temporal. And nevertheless it is ferther decreed there that
Archebysshoppes / and Bysshoppes / and other prelates shall not appear wha^
they be called before the king or his Justices for such causes for so much
that there is no power given to the lay / to judge the lords anointed / but
ought of necessyte to obey them / and than for reformynge of such things /
the Constitucion gives strayte process against the kings baylyffes and
officers / and against the clerks that do make the writtes of attacheme^tes or
distresses with great excomunicacions and enterdictions / and finally proceed
so far that they set the kings lands in a certain circuit therein lymyted
under interdiction / but he upon the admonicyon of the Bysshoppes reform such
things / and it is after decreed / that if the Bishop or ecclesyastical
judge or inferior prelate be compelled by such distresses to appear / and the
Acts of his (...) be than required of him: so that it may appear thereby /
whether he has proceeded in any of the seyde cases or like / or if oaths /
excusations / or put gacyons / be required therein / that he shall in nowyse
exhibyt his Acts or give any oath / for that the parties may brige the Acts
forth. etc. And why any such laws should be made that they should not in such
case show their Acts or process / ne make any oath before the king or his
justices. I can not parceyue the very cause / but that they be of lykelyhode
very loathe to have it examyned. What is their very Iurisdiccyon and what not.
Thus have I recyted part of the said co^stitucion / and remytte the resydue to
them that will take the pain to read it. And surely they that so do / shall se
diverse hard and extreme clauses and Actycles in it. And if they and such other
like were reformed / I thike it were right good and expedient / as well for
the clergy as for the people.

The.xxviii. chapter.
THere is a Constitucyon in the.v. book / and in ye title of pains / which
begineth / Euenit et infra whereby it is decreed thus The lay shalde compelled
precysely by sentence of excomunicacion to pay all manner penalyties / as well
corporal as pecunarye / which they be enjoined to by their prelaties / and
they that will let or stop such penalyties to be paid / shalde punisshed by
sentence of interdiction and excomunication / and than if the process be made
unto the distraynyng of prelattes for that cause / let process be made against
the distreyners by the penalyties declared in that behalf / and how far that
Constitution is against the kings laws and his prerogatyfe / and how far it
pretends above the common use of ye spiritual turisdiction / and against all
laws that have been made in time paste / concerning the spitytuall
turisdiction / it will appear to all that will take the pain to read them /
and if it should stand in strength / it should follow thereupon that if a man
were enjoined by his prelatte to pay damages for a trespass / or a dysseason /
or to pay a debt or a certain some of money for a covenant broke or such
other / he should be compelled to pay it / and they that would let it should
be enterdit and excomunicate / as appears by ye plain letter of the said
Co^stitucion / and so should the spirytuall court have power to hold plee and
give sentence upon mere Temporal things / and therefore the makers of the said
Constitucion by the making thereof gave a great occasyon to have all such
lyberties and iurisdictio^s / as they had kings grauntes / and by the custom
of the realm taken fro them But yet if the prelates and Clergy that now be /
will endeavor them to refourme such things / than the making thereof can not
be laid to the^.

The.xxix. chapter.
If a man report untruly / that prelates and spiritual Iuges / hold plee
for the Tytell of Patronage / of cattle / and of other things apparteynynge
to the Kings court / whereby the prelates and spyrytuall Iuges be blasphemed
and hurted: I think an accyon lies in the kings laws against him that
makes that untrue report / and yet nevertheless prelates have made a
constitucyon / that such reporters shall be openly accursed / as striuers against
the churches lyberties / unto such time that they have recompensed the Iuges
and also the parties for their expenses and damages. And surely if spirytuall
Iuges execute that constitucyon / and compel a^^ to make recompense in that
behalf / they re^ne in to the praemunire / for the shad none authority to make
that decre. And it is not the very charytable way / ne the way to give good
example to the people / ne to enduce them to sufferau^ce and forberige of
other: to se their prelates upon so light offenses make laws / for reuengynge
of their own quarelles / and to desire to be their own Iuges therein. And the
said constitucion is in the fyfth book and in the title against grefes / and
begins: For as much as it has been. et cetera.

The.xxx. chapter.
IF a pressed craftily imagynnynge to Intrude in to the benyfyce of a another /
afferme that the possessour of the benefyce is deed / or has resygned / and
thereupon he procures him self to be presented in to the same benifyce by the
same patron that presented the other / or his heirs / and so takes the
profytes. The other wha^ he knows of it / may sue him that so enters as an
Intruder in the spyrituall court / for there ye right of patronage bytwixte
those two encombentes / that claim by one patron can not come in debate / but
if the intruder in such case procure himself to be presented by another
patron / and thereupon enters and takes the profytes / there lies no suit
against that Intruder in the spiritual court for there the title of the
patronage may come in debate bytwixte those several patrones. And yet Otho in
his legantyne that begineth: Every lover of justice. etc. Puttyyg no dyuersyte
bytwyxte Intruders that enter by one patron / and by several patrones /
decrees that he which procures him self to entrude / beside the restitucyon
of damages / shall be forth with in the deed doing suspended from office and
benifyce / which thing he will to be extended only to him that presumes of
his own will / vyolently or privily to invade a benifyce / whiles another is
in possessyon / and after enforces him to defend the same. And because the
seyde decre extends it self as well to make process / where the Incombentes
be presented by several patro^s as by one self patron. It is against the
kings laws / and would be reformed.
