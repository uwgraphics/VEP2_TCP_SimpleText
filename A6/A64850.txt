Hodie Mihi Cras Tibi. To the Never Dying MEMORY. Of his Ever honored FRIEND.
Mr. MICHAELL SPARK Iun. Wounded by his unnatural Brother causelessly, Whereof
he dyed Patiently, Changing his Mortal to Immortality, Monday November. 17.
Anno, 1645.
Mourn not for him, whose happy Soul by this,
Enthroned with Angels, in a place of bliss.
Can change no more, death ending all the strife:
Has him translated to a better life,
And to our grief, let this be some restraint;
Earth lost a friend, but Heaven has gained a Saint.
Let Mortals learn, by this his sudden change
Life is uncertain, why should death be strange?
Shall not that P.S.
wretch who most unnatural.
Preventing sickness) caused his Brothers fall,
As cursed Cain, (persu'de with black despair)
Run like a vagabond, he knows not where,
Know God is Just, and blood requires blood,
Earth may connive, but Heaven will see it made good.
So We convey Him to his peaceful Urne,
For Dust We are, and must to Dust return.
Tho. Vere. 6.
