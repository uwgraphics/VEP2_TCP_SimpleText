To the QVEENS most Excellent Majesty. The Humble Petition of diverse
Gentle-women, Citizens Wives, Tradesmens Wives, and other Inhabitants in the
Cities of London and Westminster, and the Suburbs thereof.
In all Humility Prostrate themselves at Your Majesty's Feet, Your Poor
Petitioners.
THat as Your Majesty's Royal Presence amongst us has been the comfort of
our Loyal hearts, And the Glory and Magnificence of Your Princely Court, the
spring and fountain whence has flowed pentifull aliment and maintenance for
us, our Husbands, Children and Families, to the support of many Thousand souls,
Education, whose Trade and labors, have had sole relation to the service of you
Sacred person, and whose subsistence depends wholly upon the Commerce we
receive by occasion of your Majesty's Retinue, and the resort of the Nobility
and Gentry to your Royal Palace, which is the life of Trade. So they cannot
but foresee that your Majesty's withdrawing the comfort of your Royal presence
from amongst them, must necessarily occasion the utter deiection, distraction
and Ruin of them and all their dependants.

Therefore humbly pray, that your Maiestic (not imputing the uncivil Tumults,
nor unjust aspersions of some factious and ill-affected spirits, to proceed
from any unsiderable party of your Loyal Subjects, but rather such as have
been excyted thereto by some sinister practices) will truly affy in the
constant and real affections of your loyal people, who with perfect zeal
hold in due Reverence and admiration your great and exemplar Virtues, and with
cheerful and faithful hearts, as they live by your favor, will willingly die
in your service.

And that your Majesty in your tender Compassion of the afflicted minds, and
distressed estates of your petitioners would renew the spring of al their
hopes, comforts and subsistence, by deserting this intended Journey, and
graciously refreshing their withering spirits, with the Beams of your much
desired presence.

So shall your Petitioners be obliged ever to pray for your Majesty's long life
and prosperity.
