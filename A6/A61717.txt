AN EXPLICATION Of the following DIRECTION For the reading of the BIBLE over in
a year. With an EXHORTATION to the necessary Use and Practice thereof.
THE scope of this Direction is, to guide thee in the Annual reading of the
holy Scriptures. The way of it is plain and familiar, because it most concerns
the weak. Each page has the figures for the day of the Month set in the first
place, which serve for the three Months that are in that page. Each days
task is three Chapters: two in the old Testament, and one in the New, so long
as the New does last. And this order is constant, excepting in the Psalms:
where, because some are so very short, there is sometimes two, sometime more to
be taken together at one reading. Only the Hundred-nineteenth, because it is
too long for one reading, is divided into four Portions: Six parts a piece for
the two former, and Five a piece for the two latter: which Portions exceed not
the length of an ordinary Chapter.

As for the day which is supernumerary in the Leap-yeares (that is, which is
above 365.) I rather leave it to thy Discretion and Piety how to employ it to
God's glory, and thy own solace, then prescribe any thing.

2. For the time: It is very requisite to observe it strictly; that is, to
read one Chapter in the morning, another at noone, and the third at night: so
thou shall never want heavenly matter to take up thy thoughts. But, what ever
is omitted in the day time, must be made out at night. If it so fall out, that
some days or weeks task be omitted, (as by sickness or the like) when thou
come to it again, double the daily task till the loss be repaired. And
whereas the Lord's Day is here made only equal to other days, in it is task
and service; thou must ever make it a Feast of Fat things, by adding to it a
Portion in some Book or other which thy soul most affects: be it Isaiah, or
the Epistle to the Romans, or any of the Gospells, etc. But the Psalms in this
respect, may not wholly be omitted; this day being a singular day above others,
forsinging and rejoyceing.

3. For good success, and proficiencie in this holy employment; pray
constantly to him that has the Key of David, to unlocke thy Understanding, and
use such helps as the Lord affords thee. And when thou Doubtest, fail not
to go to the Master of the Assembly, Eccles. 12.11. Seek the Law at his mouth,
for so thou ought to do, Malac. 2.7.

To help a bad memory, do this; read with Leisure and Intention; Meditate with
Delight, (this feeds the soul) Confer with others at all oportunities,
especially with those whom God has set near thee, or given thee in Charge, as
Psalm. 34.11. Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7, 8, 9. and chapter 11.18, 19, 20.

Apply the Promises to thy self with joy. Consider the Threatenings with Fear
and Trembling, Isaiah, 66.5. Psalm. 119.120. But above all Helps, if thou
would have thy profiting appear indeed, whenever God has taught thee any
Duty, fall straight way in hand therewith, to Practice it thence forward.

4. This course (if carefully observed) will speedily bring thee acquainted
with God and his whole Council, revealed in his Word. It will inform thee of
his good will toward thee, and what great things he has done for thy soul;
and likewise, what duties he requires at thy hand. It will forewarne thee of
all the enemies that Way-lye thee: and of their great wrath, malice, subtilties
and power: and not only so, but (which is all in all) it will furnish thee with
Wisdom, to foresee, with Courage, to stand, and Power, to withstand, and
Armor, (even the whole Armor of God, Ephesians. 6.10, -- 17.) wherewith to
encounter and overcome, the World, the Devil, and the Flesh. It will inform
thee of the endless Joys, and ineffable Treasures of Heaven, that thou may
cover them carnestly, and inherit them: and also, of the insupportable
Torments, and unquenchable Fire of Hell, to avoid them. By this thy
Conscionable Practice, the work of the Minister shall be more profitable unto
thee, and less grievous to him: the Word of God shall dwell richly in thee;
and also thou shall be able to render a reason of the Faith that is in thee,
whereas without this Diligence, he that is Ignorant, does often live and dye
so, even under a Powerful Ministry.

By this means (God blessing it to us) Christ's Kingdom shall come into our
hearts with Power, and his Scepter (which is his word) will bear Sway, and
Rule in all Private Families amangst us: even in those Families which hitherto
have forgotten the Name of their God, and walking on still in Darkness, as
without God in the World, Have counted those great things of God's Law, as a
strange thing, Hos. 8.12.

5. If these Motives avail not to win thee to a likeing of the Word, and the
Practiceing of it; consider further, what need thou have of it, and what it is
which thou despisest, in rejecting it. Thy heart is as hard as a stone in thee,
but this Word is as a hammer, that breaks the Rock in pieces, Jer. 23.29. It
is also a salve, to heal and cure a broken and contrite Heart, Psalm. 107.20.
All holy Zeal and Spiritual desires, are extinction thee, but this Word is a
Fire to kindle How Affections in thee: it is his Furnace to purge out the
dross of thy Natural Corruptions: Yea it is as water to wash away
uncleanness, John, 15.3. In a word, the Virtues and Operations of it are
innumerable: and for it is worth, man cannot utter it. It is strengthving as
Bread: quenching thirst after sin, as Drink: Chearing as Wine: Sweet as
Honny: Enriching as Gold. Quick and Powerful, sharper then any
two-edged-sword. It is the Word of God's power, even The power of God unto
Salvation, to every one that believes, Romans 1.16.

6. Up then and be doing. Work out thy salvation. They that stand all the day
idle, receive no wages: and the ignorant have no promise of life: but they that
are wise, that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the Stars for ever
and ever The hand of the Diligent makes rich: but the field of the man void of
Understanding, is al grown over with Thorns. Ignorance of the Scriptures, is
the mother of Error, Math. 22.29. leaveing a gappe open to all Lewdness, Riot,
and Exorbitancy

Think thou to have Eternal life in the Scriptures, and yet art not
acquainted with them? The Promise is, Seek and you shall find. And that thou
may seek Eternal life, and Jesus Christ (the Author and giver of Life,)
where he is to be found he commands thee to Search the Scriptures, John, 5.39.

To go further yet; our Savior intimates to us, that the Jews would never
have troubled him so often with slight questions, if they had used to read the
Scriptures as diligently as they ought. And when they posed him, he usually
sent them to read the Scriptures for their answer. So Luke, 10.26. He returns
one to learn his Duty, What is written in the Law? How read thou? And so
others of them, Math. 12.3. Have ye not read what David did? And verse. 5. Have
ye not read in the Law? etc. So likewise Math. 21.16.

So that the reading of the Holy Scripture, is a Duty that our Savior pressed
often. And his exhortation (before quoted) John, 5.39. is to all. Neither
should thy wordly employments hinder thy performance of this Duty, for even the
King (though he might plead the greatest hindrances of any whatsoever, even
the weighty affairs of his Kingdom) was not exempted from this daily task,
the reading of the Word of God. Deuteronomy. 17.19.

Here is both Precept and Promise. Yea, this Practice has a Blessing, Rev.
1.3. Blessed is he that reads. etc.

7. And that thou may^st not be discouraged, either through thy own
incapacity, or it is obscurity; know, that this course of exerciseing in the
word of God, is blessed with happy success from the first medleing with it,
and that even to the Weakest, Psalm. 119.130. The entrance of thy words gives
light: it gives understanding to the simple. But if after all these
Incitements, thou count thy self unworthy of eternal Life, and wilt not lay
hold of it; I must also put thee in mind (e're I leave thee) that where these
Blessings take no place, there the Curse enters. When they that search the
Scriptures find Eternal life, they that neglect them will find Eternal
Death. When the Wise and Diligent enter into their Masters Joy, the Slothfall
and Foolish will be thrust into Hell.

Consider what the Scripture says, and the Lord give thee Understanding in all
things. So prays

Thine in the Lord, Randall Sanderson, F. of Q. C. Oxon.
