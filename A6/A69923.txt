THE INTRODVCTION.
Sir Dudley Diggs.
MY LORDS,
I Shall I hope auspiciously begin this Conference this day, with an
observation out of the holy Story, 2. Chro. Cha. 34.
in the days of good King Josiah, when the Land was purged of Idolatry, and
the great men went about to repair the house of God, while money was sought
for, there was found a Book of the Law which had been neglected, 2 Kings Cha.
22.
and afterward being presented to the good King, procured the blessing which
your Lordships may read in the Scriptures.

My good Lords, I am confident your Lordships will ascheerefully join with the
Commons, in acknowledgement of Gods great blessing in our good King Josiah, as
the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of the House of Commons, by me their
unworthiest servant, do thankfully remember your most religiously and truly
honorable invitation of them to the late Petition, for cleansing this Land
from Popish abominations, which I may truly call a necessary and a happy
repairing of the house of God, and to go on with the parallel, whilst we the
Commons out of our good affections were seeking for money, we found I cannot
say a book of the Law, but many and fundamental points thereof neglected and
broken, which has occasioned our desire of this conference, wherein I am first
commanded to show unto your Lordships in general, that the Laws of England
are grounded on reason more ancient then books, consisting much in unwritten
customs, yet so full of Justice and true equity, that your most Honorable
Predecessors, and Ancestors propugned them with a nolumus mutari, and so
ancient, that from the Saxon days, notwithstanding the Injuries and ruins of
time, they have continued in most parts the same, as may appear in old
remaining Monuments of the Laws of Ethelbert, the first Christian King of
Kent, Jna the King of the West Saxons, Offer of the Mertians, and of Alfred the
great Monarch who united the Saxon Heptarchie, whose laws are yet to be seen
published, as some think by Parliament, as he says to that end, Vt qui sub
uno rege, sub una lege rege^entur. And though the Book of Litchfield speaking
of the times of the Danes, says that then Ius sopitum erat in regno, leges and
consuetudines sopitae sunt, and prava voluntas, vis, and violentia magis
regnabant quam judicia vel justitia; yet by the blessing of God a good King,
Edward, commonly called St. Edward, did awaken those laws, and as the old
words are, Excitatas reparavit, reparatas decoravit, decoratas confirmavit;
Which confirmavit, shows that good King Edward did not give those Laws which
William the Conqueror and all his Successors since that time have sworn unto.

And here my Lords, by many Cases frequent in our modern Laws strongly
concurring with those of the ancient Saxon Kings, I might, if time were not
more precious, demonstrate that our Laws and Customs were the same.

I will only entreat your Lordships leave to tell you, that as we have now,
even in those Saxon times they had their Court Barons, and Court Leets, and
Sheriffs Courts, by which, as Tacitus says of the Germans, their Ancestors
Jura reddebant per pagos and vicos; and I do believe, as we have now, they
had their Parliaments, where new laws were made cum consensu Praelatorum
magnatum and totius communitatis; or as another writes, cum consilio
praelatorum, nobilium, and sapientium laicorum. I will add nothing out of
Glanvile that wrote in the time of H. 2. or Bracton that writ in the days of
H. 3. only give me leave to cite that of Fortescue, the learned Chancellor to
H. 6. who writing of this Kingdom, says, Regnum istud moribus nationum, and
Regum temporibus, eisdem quibus nunc Regitur legibus and consuetudinibus
regebatur. But my good Lords, as the Poet said of Fame, I may say of our common
Law; Ingrediturque solo caput inter nubila condit. Wherefore the cloudy part
being mine, I will make have to open way for your Lordships to hear more
certain Arguments, and such as go on more sure grounds.

Be pleased then to know, that it is an undoubted and fundamental point of
this so ancient common law of England, that the Subject has a true property in
his goods and poffessions, which does preserve as sacred that Meum and tuum,
that is the nurse of Industry, and mother of Courage, and without which there
can be no Justice, of which Meum and tuum is the proper object. But the
undoubted birthright of Free Subjects, has lately not a little been invaded
and prejudiced by pressures, the more grievous, because they have been pursued
by imprisonment contrary to the Franchises of this Land, and when according to
the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, redress has been sought for in a
legal way by demanding Habeas Corpus from the Judges, and a discharge or
trial according to the law of the Land, success has failed, that now
inforceth the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, to examine by Acts
of Parliament, presidents and reasons, the truth of the English Subjects
liberty, which I shall leave to learned Gentlemen, whose learned Arguments I
hope will leave no place in your Lordships memories, for the errors and
infirmities of your humblest servant, that does thankfully acknowledge the
great favor of your Honorable and patient Attention.

Sir Edward Littletons Argument.
The Argument made by the Command of the house of Commons out of Acts of
Parliament, and authorities of Law, expounding the same, at the first
Conference with the Lords concerning the liberty of the person of every
Freeman.
Mr. Littleton.
MY LORDS,
Upon the occasions delivered by the Gentleman, your Lordships have heard the
Commons have taken into their serious consideration the matter of personal
liberty, and after long debate thereof on diverse days, as well by solemn
Arguments, as single propositions of doubts and answers, to the end no scruple
might remain in any man's breast unsatisfied, they have upon a full Search, and
clear understanding of all things pertinent to the question, unanimously
declared; That no Freeman ought to be committed or restrained in prison by
the command of the King or Privy Counsel, or any other, unless some cause of
the commitment, detainer, or restraint be expressed, for which by law he
ought to be committed, detained, or restrained. And they have sent me with
other of their members, to represent unto your Lordships the true grounds of
their resolution, and have charged me particularly, leaving the reasons of law,
and presidents, for others, to give your Lordships satisfaction, that this
liberty is established and confirmed by the whole State, the King, the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and Commons, by several Acts of Parliament, the
authority whereof is so great, that it can receive no answer save by
interpretation or repeal by future Statutes. And those that I shall mind your
Lordships of are so direct in point, that they can bear no other exposition at
all, and sure I am they are still in force; The first of them is the grand
Charter of the Liberties of England, first granted in the seventeenth year of
King John, and renewed in the ninth year of Henry the third, and since
confirmed in Parliament above 30. times, the words there are Chap. 29. Nullus
liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisietur de libero tento suo vel
liberis consuetudinibus su is, aut utlageretur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo
destruatur, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per legale
judicium parium suorum vel per legem terrae.

These words nullus liber homo, etc. are express enough, yet it is remarkable,
that Matthew Paris, an Author of special credit, does observe, fol. 432. that
the Charter of 9. H. 3. was the very same as that of 17. King John, in nullo
dissimilis are his words, and that of King John he sets down verbatim, Fo.
342. and there the words are directly, Nec eum in Carcerem mittemus, and such a
corruption as is now in the print might easily happen 'twixt 9. H. 3. and 28.
of Ed. 1. when this Charter was first exemplified, but certainly there is
sufficient left in that which is extant to decide this question, for the words
are, that no Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, but by the lawful
judgment of his Peers, which is by a Jury of Peers, ordinary Jurors for
others, who are their Peers, or by the law of the Land; Which words, Law of
the Land, must of necessity be understood in this notion, to be by due Process
of the Law, and not the law of the Land generally, or otherwise it would
comprehend Bondmen (whom we call Villains) who are excluded by the word
liber; For the general law of the Land does allow their Lords to imprison them
at their pleasure without cause, wherein they only differ from the Freemen in
respect of their persons, who cannot be imprisoned without a cause. And that
this is the true understanding of these words per legem terrae, will more
plainly appeareby diverse other Statutes that I shall use, which do expound the
Law according. And though the words of this grand Charter be spoken in the
third person, yet they are not to be understood of suites betwixt party and
party, at least not of them alone, but even of the Kings suites against his
Subjects, as will appear by the occasion of getting of that Charter, which was
by reason of the differences betwixt those Kings and their people, and
therefore properly to be applied unto their power over them, and not to
ordinary questions betwixt Subject and Subject. Secondly, the words per legale
judicium parium suorum, immediately preceding the other of per legem terrae, are
meant of trials at the Kings suit, and not at the prosecution of a Subject. And
therefore if a Peer of the Realm be arraigned, at the Suit of the King, upon
an Indictement of murder, he shall be tried by his Peers; but if he be
appealed of murder by a Subject, his trial shall be by an ordinary Jury of
12. Freeholders, as appears in 10. Ed. 4. 6. 33. H. 8. Brook title trials
142. Stan. Cor. li. 3. ca. 1. fol. 152. and in 10. Ed. 4. 6. it is said, such
is the meaning of Magna Charta, for the same reason; Sinor indite ferra try
per pares auterment si soit appeal, Br. tit Corone 153. nota bien.
Therefore as per judicium parium suorum, extends to the Kings Suit, so shall
these words per legem terrae; And in 8. Ed. 2. rot. parliament. membrana 7.
there is a Petition that a Writ under the privy Seal went to the Guardians of
the great Seal, to cause lands to be seized into the Kings hands, by force of
which there went a Writ out of the Chancery to the Eschetor, to seize against
the form of the grand Charter, that the King nor his ministers shall out no
man of his Freehold-without reasonable judgment, and the party was restored to
his land, which shows the Statute did extend to the King. There was no
invasion upon this personal liberty, till the time of King Ed. 3. which was
eftsoone resented by the Subject, for in 5. Ed. 3. ca. 9. it is ordained in
these words; Sta. 5. Ed. 3. 9.
It is enacted that no man from henceforth shall be attached by any occasion,
nor fore-judged of life or limb, nor his lands, tenements, goods nor chattels
seized into the Kings hands, against the form of the great Charter, and the
law of the Land. 25. Ed. 3. cap. 4. Sta. 15. Ed. 3. 4.
It is more full, and does expound the words of the grand Charter, and is thus;
Whereas it is contained in the grand Charter of the franchises of England, that
none shall be imprisoned, nor put out of his freehold, nor free custom,
unless it be by the law of the Land, It is awarded, assented, and established,
that from hence none shall be taken by Petition or Suggestion, made to our
Lord the King, or to his Counsel, unless it be by Indictment, or presentment
of his good and lawful people of the same neighborhood, which such Deeds
shall be done in due manner, or by Process made by Writ original at the Common
law, nor that none be Out of his Franchises, nor of his Freehold, unless he be
duly brought in answer, and fore-judged of the same by the course of the law,
and if any thing be done against the same, it shall be redressed and holden for
none.

Out of this Statute I observe, Lex terre expound per process dee faict per bre
original al common ley.
that what in Magna Charta, and the preamble of the Statute is termed by the
law of the Land, is in the body of this Act expounded to be by Process made by
Writ original at the Common law, which is a plain interpretation of the words
(Law of the Land) in the grand Charter. And I note that the Law was made upon
the commitment of diverse to the Tower, no man yet knows for what.

28. Ed. 3. cap. 3. Sta. 28. Ed. 3. ca. 3.
It is more direct, this liberty being followed with fresh Suit by the
Subject, where the words are not many, but very full and significant; That no
man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands nor
tenements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor dis-inherited, nor put to death,
without he be brought in answer by due Process of law.

Here your Lordships see the usual words of The law of the Land, are rendered
by Due Process of the law.

36. Ed. 3. Rot. parliament. numero 9. 36. E. 3. Rot. Parliam. nu. 9. Peticion
del Commons.
Amongst the Petitions of the Commons, one of them being translated into
English out of French, is thus; First, that the great Charter, and the Charter
of the Forest, and other Statutes made in the time of his Progenitors, for the
profit of him, and his Comonaltie, be well and firmly kept, and put in due
execution, without putting disturbance, or making arrest contrary to them by
special command, or in other manner.

Rns al peticion.
The Answer to the Petition, which makes an Act of Parliament. Our Lord the
King, by the Assent of the Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and the
Commonaltie, has ordained or established, that the said Charters and Statutes
be held and put in execution, according to the said Petition. It is observable
that the Statutes were to be put in execution according to the said Petition,
which is, that no arrest should be made contrary to the Statutes, by special
command. This concludes the question, and is of as great force, as if it were
printed, for the Parliament roll is the true warrant of an Act, and many are
omitted out of the books, that are extant in the Roll.

36. Ed. 3. Rot. Parliamenti number. 22. 36. Ed 3. Rot. parl number. 22. Peticion d'
Commons.
explaineth it further, for there the Petition is, Item, as it is contained in
the grand Charter and other Statutes, that no man be taken or imprisoned by
special command without Indictment, or other due Process to be made by the law,
and oftentimes it has been, and yet is, many are hindered, taken, and
imprisoned without Indictment, or other Process made by the Law upon them, as
well of things done out of the Forest of the King, as for other things, that
it would please our said Lord to command those to be delivered, which are so
taken by special command, against the form of the Charter and Statutes as
aforesaid.

Rns al Peticion.
The answer is,

St. 27. Ed 3. ca. 18.
The King is pleased, that if any man find himself grieved, that he come and
make his complaint, and right shall be done unto him. 37 Ed. 3. cap. 8. agrees
in substance with them, it says, Though it be contained in the great Charter,
that no man be taken nor imprisoned, nor put out of his Freehold without Process
of the law; Nevertheless diverse people make false suggestions to the King
himself, as well for malice as otherwise, whereof the King is often grieved,
and diverse of the Realm put in damage against the form of the same Charter;
Wherefore it is ordained, that all they which make Suggestions, shall be sent
with the same Suggestions to the Chancellor, Treasurer, and his grand
Counsel, and that they there find surety to pursue their Suggestions, and
incur the same pain that the other should have had, if he were attainted, in
case that the Suggestion be found evil, and that then Process of law be made
against them without being taken or imprisoned, against the form of the said
Charter, and other Statutes; here the law of the Land in the grand Charter is
explained to be without Process of law.

Sta. 42. Ed. 3. ca. 13.
42. Ed. 3. cap. 13. At the request of the Commons by their Petition put forth
in this Parliament, to eschew mischief and damage done to diverse of his
Commons by false accusers, which oftentimes have made their accusasions, more
for revenge and singular profit, then for the profit of the King, or of his
people, which accused persons, Some have been taken and caused to come before
the Kings Counsel by Writ, and otherwise upon grievous pains against the Law,
It is assented and accorded for the good governance of the Commons, that no man
be put to answer without presentment or matter of record, or by due Process and
Writ original according to the old law of the Land, And if any thing from
hence be done to the contrary, it shall be void in the Law, and holden for
Error.

Sta. 42. Ed. 3. Rot. Parliam. number. 12.
But this is better in the Parliament roll, where the Petition and answer,
which make the Act, are set down at large. 42. Ed. 3. Rot. Parliamenti, numero
12.

Peticion des Commons.
The Petition.

Item, Because that many of your Commons are hurt and destroyed by false
accusers, who make their accusations more for their revenge and particular
gain, then for the profit of the King, or of his people. And those that are
accused by them, some are taken, and others are made to come before the Kings
Counsel by Writ, or other commandment of the King, upon grievous pains
contrary to the Law. That it would please our Lord the King, and his good
Counsel, for the just government of his people, to ordain, that if hereafter
any accuser purpose any matter for the profit of the King, that the same matter
be sent to the Justices of the one bench or of the other, or the Assizes, to be
inquired and determined according to the Law; and if it concern the Accuser or
party, that he take his Suit at the common law, and that no man be put to
answer without presentment before Justices or matter of Record, and by due
Process and original Writ, according to the ancient law of the Land. And if any
thing henceforward be done to the contrary, that it be void in law, and held
for error.

Here by due Process and original Writ, according to the ancient Law of the
Land, is meant the same thing, as per legem terrae, in Magna Charta, and the
abuse was, they were put to answer to the commandment of the King.

Rns al petition.
The Kings Answer is thus.

Because that this Article is an Article of the grand Charter, the King wills
that this be done, as the Petition does demand. By this appears that per
legem terrae, in Magna Charta, is meant by due Process of the Law.

Obi. horse d' l' Sta. de Westminster. 1. cap. 15.
Thus your Lordships have heard act of Parliament in the point. But the Statute
of Westminst, 1. cap. 15. is urged to disprove this opinion, where it is
expressly said, Que ne sont repleviseable que sont commit per le command le Roy.
that a man is not repleviseable, who is committed by the command of the King,
therefore the Command of the King, without any cause showed, is sufficient to
commit a man to prison. And because the strength of the Argument may appear,
and the Answer be better understood, I will read the words of the Statute,
which are thus. Les parols d' Sta.
And forasmuch as Sheriff, and others, which have taken and kept in prison
persons detected for Felony, and oftentimes have let out by Replevin, such as
were not repleviable, and have kept in prison such as were repleviable, because
they would gain of the one party, and grieve the other, And forasmuch as
before this time it was not certainly determined what persons were repleviable,
and what not, but only those that were taken for the death of a man, or by the
commandment of the King, or of his Justices, or for the Forest, It is
provided, and by the King commanded, that such prisoners as were before
outlawed, and they which have abjured the Realm, provers, and such as be taken
with the manner, and those which have broken the Kings prison, Thieves openly
defamed and known, and such as be appealed by approvers, so long as the
approvers are living, if they be not of good name, and such as be taken for
burning of houses feloniously done, or for false money, or for counterfeiting
the Kings Seal, or persons Excommunicate taken at the request of the Bishop,
or for manifest offenses, or for treason touching the King himself, shall be
in no wise repleviable by the common Writ, or without Writ; But such as be
indicted of Larceny by inquests taken before Sheriffs or Bailiffs by their
office, or of light suspicion, or of petit Larceny, that amounts not above
the value of twelve pence, if they were not guilty of some other Larceny
afore-time, or guilty of receipt of Felons, or of commandment, or of force, or
of aid of felony done, or guilty to some other trespass, for which one ought
not to lose either life or member, and a man appealed by an approver, after the
death of the approver, if he be no common thief or defamed, shall from
henceforth be let out by sufficient surety, whereof the Sheriff will be
answerable, and that without giving ought of their goods; and if the Sheriff,
or any other, let any go at large, by surety, that are not repleviable, if he
be Sheriff, or Constable, or any other Bailiffe, or such as has a Fee, which
has keeping of prisons, and thereof be Attainted, he shall lose his Office and
Fee for ever. And if the under Sheriff, Constable or Bailiffe, or such as has
Fee for keeping of Prisons, do it contrary to the will of his Lord, or any
other Bailiffe being not of Fee, they shall have three years imprisonment, and
make a Fine at the Kings pleasure; And if any man withold Prisoners
repleviseable, after that they have offered sufficient Surety, he shall pay a
grievous amercement to the King, and if he take any reward for the deliverance
of such, he shall pay double to the Prisoner, and also shall be in the great
mercy of the King.

The Answer.

It must be acknowledged, that a man taken by the commandment of the King is
not repleviseable, for so are the express words of this Statute, but this
makes nothing against the Declaration of the Commons; For they say not the
Sheriff may replevy such a one by sureties, silicet manucaptores, but he is
bayleable by the Kings Courts of Justice; for the better apprehending whereof,
it is to be known, that there is a difference between repleviseable,
Diversity enter Bayleable and repleviseable.
which is always by the Sheriff upon pledges or Sureties given, and baileable,
which is by a Court of Record, where the Prisoner is delivered to bail, and
they are his Gaolers, and may imprison him, and shall suffer for him body for
body, as appears 33. and 36. Ed 3. titulo mainprise 12. and. 13. where the
difference betwixt Bail and Mainprise is expressly, take, and if the words of
the Statute themselves be observed, it will appear plainly that it extends to
the Sheriff and other inferior Officers, and does not bind the hands of the
Judges. The preamble which is the key that opens the Entrance into the
meaning of the makers of the Law is; Forasmuch as Sherifes and others have
taken and kept in prison persons detected of felony. Out of these words I
observe that it nominateth Sherifes, and then if the Judges should be included,
they must be comprehended under that general word, other, which does not
extend to those of an higher rank, but to inferiors, for the best by all
courses is first to be named. And therefore if a man bring a Writ of Customs
and services, and name rents and other things, the general shall not include
homage, which is a personal service; and of an higher nature, but it shall
extend to ordinary annual service, 31. E. 1. Droit. 67. So the Statute of 13.
El. cap. 10. which begins with Colleges, Deanes and Chapters, Parsons,
Vicars, and concludes with these words, and others having spiritual
promotions, shall not comprehend Bishops that are of an higher degree, as
appears in the Archbishop of Canterburies Case, 2. Reports, fol. 46. B. And
thus much is explained in the very Statute toward the end; when it does
enumerate those were meant by the word, other, namely under Sherifes,
Constables, Bailiffs, etc. Again, the words are Sherifes, and others which
have taken and kept in prison; Now every man knows, Judges do neither
arrest, nor keep men in prison, that is the office of Sherifes and other
inferior Ministers. Therefore this Statute meant such only and not Judges. The
words are further, that they let out by replevin such as are not repleviable,
that is the proper language for a Sheriff; Nay, more express afterward in the
body of the Statute, that such as are there mentioned, shall be in no wise
repleviseable by the common Writ, which is de Homine replegiando, and is
directed to the Sheriff, nor without Writ which is by the Sheriff Ex officio.
But that which receives no answer is this, that the command of the Justices,
who derive their authority from the Crown is the equalled and to this purpose
with the command of the King. And therefore by all reasonable construction, it
must needs relate to Officers that are subordinate to both, as Sherifes,
under-Sherifes, Bailiffes, Constables, and the like. And it were a harsh
exposition to say that the Justices might not discharge their own command, and
yet that reason would conclude as much; And that this was meant of the Sheriff
and other ministers of Justice by the recital 27. Ed. 1. cap. 3. and likewise
by Fleta a manuscript so called, because the Author lay in the Fleet when he
made the book, for he lib. 2. cap. 52. in his Chapter of turns, and the
viewes of the hundred Court in the Country sets down the Articles of the
Charges that are there to be inquired of, amongst which, one of them is De
Replegibilibus injuste detentis and irreplegiabilibus dimissis; which cannot be
meant of not bayling by the Justices, for what has the inferior Courts in the
Country to do with the acts of the Justices? and to make that more plain, he
sets down in that chapter, that concerns Sherifes only, the very Statute
of Westminster 1. which he translates verbatim out of the French into the
Latin, save that he renders, taken by the command of of the Justices, thus,
per judicium Justiciariorum, and his Preface to the Statute plainly shows,
that he understood it of replevine by Sherifs, for he says, Qui debent per
plegios hoc dimitti, qui non declarat hoc Statutum, and per plegios is before
the Sheriff. But for direct authority, 22. H. 6. 46. per Newton Chief Justice.
it is the opinion of Newton, Chief Justice, 22. H. 6 46. where his words are
these; It cannot be intended that the Sheriff did suffer him to go at large by
Mainprise, for where one is taken by the Writ of the King, or the Commandment
of the King, he is irrepleviseable, but in such case his friends may come to
the Justices from him if he be arrested, and purchase a Supersedeas; This Judge
concludes that the Sheriff cannot deliver him that is taken by the command of
the King, for that he is irrepleviseable, which is the very word of the Satute:
but, says he, his friends may come to the Justices and purchase a Supersedeas;
So he declares the very question, that the Sheriff had no power, but the
Justices had power to deliver him that is committed by the Kings command; and
both the ancient and modern practice manifest as much, for he that is taken
for the death of a man, or for the Forest, is not repleviable by the Sheriff,
yet they are ordinarily bayled by the Justice, and were by the Kings Writs
directed to the Sherifs in the times of Ed. 1. and 2. as appears in the close
rolls, which could not be done if they were not baylable. And it is every days
experience, that the Justices of the Kings Bench do bail for Murder, and for
offenses done in the Forest, which they could not do, if they were
irrepleviseable, if Westminst. 1. were meant of the Justices, as well as of the
Sherifs. For authorities that have been offered to prove the contrary, are in
number three, the first is 21. Ed. 3. Rot. 2. which also is in the Book of
Pleas in Parliament at the Tower, upon an action there brought, fol. 44. It is
not an Act of Parliament, but a resolution in Parliament upon an action there
brought, which was usual in those times. And the case is, that Stephen Rabaz,
the Sheriff of the Counties of Leicester and Warwick, was questioned, for that
he had let at large by Surety, amongst others, one William, the son of Walter
le Pesons, against the will and command of the King, whereas the King had
commanded him by Letters under the Privy Seal, that he should do no favor
to any man that was committed by the Earl of Warwick, as that man was,
whereunto the Sheriff answered, that he did it at the request of some of the
Kings household upon their Letters, and because the Sheriff did acknowledge the
receipt of the Kings Letters, thereupon he was committed to prison according to
the form of the Statute. To this I answer, the Sheriff was justly punished,
for that he is expressly bound by the Statute of Westminst. 1. which was agreed
from the beginning, but this is no proof, that the Judges had no power to
bail this man.

The next Authority is 33. H. 6. in the Court of Common Pleas, fo. 28. b. 29.
where Sobert Poyning Esquire, was brought to the Bar upon a Capias, and was
returned, that he was committed Per Duos de Consilio, (which is strongest
against what I maintain) pro diversis causis regem tangent. and he made an
Attorney there in an action, whence it is inferred, that the return was good,
and the party could not be delivered. To this the answer is plain.

First, no opinion is delivered in that book, one way or other, upon the
return, neither is there any testimony whether he were delivered, or bayled,
or not. 2. It appears expressly, that he was brought thither, to be charged in
an action of debt, at another man's suit, and no desire of his own to be
delivered, or bayled, and then if he were remanded, it is in no way material
to the question in hand. But that which is most relied upon, is the opinion of
Stan. in his Book of Pleas of the Crown lib. 2. cap. 18. fol. 72. 73. in his
Chapter of Mainprise, where he recites the Statute of Westminst. 1. cap. 15.
and then says thus; Rns al Obi. horse de Stan. pl. Cor' 72.
By this Statute it appears, that in four cases at the Common law a man was
not repleaviable, to wit, those that were taken for the death of a man, by the
command of the King, or his Justices, or for the Forest, thus far he is most
right, then he goes on, and says, as to the command of the King, that is
understood by the command of his own mouth, or his counsel, which is
incorporated unto him, and speak with his mouth, or otherwise every Writ or
Capias to take a man, which is the Kings command, would be as much; and as to
the command of the Juces, that is meant their absolute commandment, for if it
be by their ordinary commandment, he is repleviable by the Sheriff, if it be
not in some of the cases prohibited by the Statute.

The answer that I give unto this is, that Stanford had said nothing whether a
man may be committed without cause by the Kings command, or whether the Judges
ought not to bail him in such Case, only that such a one is not repleviseable,
which is agreed, for that belongs to the Sheriff. And because no man should
think he meant any such thing, he concludes the whole Sentence touching the
Command of the King and the Justices, that one committed by the ordinary
command of the Justice, is repleviseable by the Sheriff, or at least it
appears not that he meant, that a man committed by the King, or by the Privy
Counsel without cause, should not be bayleable by the Justices, and he has
given no opinion in this case; what he would have said, if he had been asked
the question cannot be known, neither does it appear, that by any thing that
he has said, he meant any such thing as would be inferred out of him. And
now my Lords I have performed the Commands of the Commons, and as I conceive
shall clear the Declaration of personal liberty, an ancient and undoubted
truth, fortified with seven Acts of Parliament, and not opposed by any Statute
or authority of law whatsoever.

The objections of the Kings Counsel, with like answers made thereunto, at the
two other Conferences touching the same matter.
IT was agreed by the Attorney general, that the 7. Statutes urged by the
Commons were in force, and that magna Charta did extend most properly to the
King, but he said, 1. Object.
1. That some of them are in general words, and therefore conclude nothing,
but are to be expounded by the Presidents, and others that be more particular,
are applied to the Suggestions of Subjects, and not to the Kings command simply
of it self; Le Rns.
Hereunto it was answered, that the Statutes were as direct as could be, which
appears by the reading of them, and that though some of them speak of
Suggestions of the Subjects, yet others do not, and they that do are as
effectual, for that they are in equal reason, a commitment by the command of
the King, being of as great force, when it moves from a Suggestion from a
Subject, as when the King takes notice of it himself, the rather for that
Kings seldom intermeddle with matters of this nature, but by information from
some of their people.

2. Object.
2. Master Attorney objected that per legem terrae in Magna Charta (which is
the foundation of this question) cannot be understood for Process of the Law and
original Writs, for that in criminal proceedings no original Writ is used at
all, But every Constable either for Felony or breach of the Peace, or to
prevent the breach of the Peace, may commit without Process or original Writ,
and it were hard the King should not have the power of a Constable. And the
Statute cyted by the Commons, make Process of the Law, and Writ original, to be
all one.

Le Rns.
The answer of the Commons to this Objection was, that they do not intend
original Writs only by the Law of the Land, but all other legal Process, which
comprehends the whole proceedings of Law upon cause, other then trial by Jury,
Judicium parium, unto which it is opposed, thus much is imported ex vi termini
out of the word Process, and by the true acceptance thereof in the Statutes
which have been used by the Commons to maintain their Declaration, and most
especially the Statutes of 25. Ed. 3. cap. 4. where it appears that a man
ought to be brought in to answer by the course of the Law, having former
mention of Process made by original Writ. And in 28. Ed. 3. cap. 3. by the
course of the Law is rendered by the due Process of the Law. And 36. Ed. 3. Rot.
Parliamenti numero 20. The Petition of the Commons says, that no man ought to
be imprisoned by special command without Indictment or other due Process to
be made by the Law. 37. Ed. 3. cap. 18. calls the same thing Process of the
Law, and 42. Ed. 3. cap. 3. styles it by due Process and Writ original, where
the conjunctive must be taken for a dis-junctive, which charge is ordinary to
an exposition of Statutes and Deeds to avoid inconveniences, to make it stand
with the rest, and with reason, as it may be collected by the law of the Land
in Magna Charta, by the course of the Law in 25. Ed. 3. by the due Process of
Law in 28. Ed. 3. other due Process to be made by the Law in 36. Ed. 3. Process
of the Law in 37. Ed. 3. and by due Process and Writ original in 42. Ed. 3. are
one and the same thing, the later of these Statutes referring always to the
former, and that all of them import any due and regular proceedings of law upon
a cause other then the trial by Jurie. And this appears 10. Rep. 74. in the
Case of the Marshalsea, and 11. Rep. 99. James Baggs Case, where it is
understood of giving Jurisdiction by Charter or prescription which is the
ground of a proceeding by course of law. And in Seldens Notes on Fortescue,
fol. 29. where it is expounded for Law wager, which is likewise a trial by law
by the oath of the parties, differing from that by Jurie. And it does truly
comprehend these and all other regular proceedings in law upon cause, which
gives authority to the Constable to arrest upon cause. And if this be not the
true exposition of these words per legem terrae, the Kings Counsel were
desired to declare their meaning, which they never offered to do, and yet
certainly these words were not put into the Statute without some intention of
consequence. 3. Objection.
And thereupon Mr. Serjant Ashley offered an interpretation of them thus,
namely; that there were diverse Laws of this Realm, as the Common law, the law
of the Chancery, the Ecclesiastical law, the law of the Admiraltie, or Marine
law, the law of Merchants, the Marshall law, and the law of State, and that
these words per legem terrae do extend to all these Laws. Rns a ceo.
To this it was answered, that we read of no law of State, and that none of
these Laws can be meant there save the Common law, which is the principal
and general Law, and is always understood by the way of Excellency, when
mention is of the law of the Land generally, and that though each of the other
Laws, which are admitted into this Kingdom by Custom or Act of Parliament,
may justly be called a law of the Land, yet none of them can have the
pre-eminence to be styled the Law of the Land. And no Statute, Law book, or
other authority, printed or unprinted, could be shown, to prove that the Law
of the Land, being generally mentioned, was ever intended of any other then the
Common Law, and yet even by these other Laws a man may not be committed
without a cause expressed. But it stands with the rule of other legal
expositions, that per legem terrae must be meant the Common Law, which is the
general and universal Law, by which men hold their Inheritances, and
therefore if a man speak of Escuage generally, it is understood as Littleton
observes, Sect. 99. of the incertaine Escuage, which is a Knights service
tenure, for the defense of the Realm, by the body of the tenant in time of
wars, and not of a certain Escuage which gives only a contribution in
money, and no personal service. And if a Statute speak of the Kings Courts of
Record, it is meant only of the 4. at Westminster by way of excellency, 6.
Rep. 20. Gregory's Case; So the Canonists by the Excommunication simply spoken,
do intend the greater excommunication. And the Emperor in his Institutions
says, that the Civil Law being spoken generally is meant of the Civil law of
Rome, though the Law of every City is a Civil Law; as when a man names the
Poet, the Graecians understand Homer, the Latinists Virgil. 2. Admit per legem
terrae extend to all the Laws of the Land, yet a man must not be committed by
any of them, but by the due proceedings that are executed by those Laws, and
upon a cause declared. 4. Object.
Again, it was urged that the King was not bound to express a cause of
imprisonment, because there may be in it matter of State, not fit to be
revealed for a time, lest the confederates thereupon make means to escape the
hands of Justice. And therefore the Statute cannot be intended to restrain all
commitments unless a cause be expressed, for that it would be very
inconvenient and dangerous to the State, to publish the Cause at the very
first. Le Rns.
Hereunto it was replied by the Commons, that all danger and inconvenience may
be avoided by declaring a general Cause, as for Treason, suspicion of Treason,
misprision of Treason or felony, without specifying the particular, which can
give no greater light to a confederate, then will be conjectured by the very
apprehension upon the imprisonment, if nothing at all were expressed. 5. Object.
It was further alleged that there was a kind of contradiction in the position
of the House of Commons, when they say a party committed without a cause
showed, ought to be delivered or bayled, Bayling being a kind of imprisonment,
deliverie a total freeing. Le Rns.
To this it has been answered, that it has always been the discretion of
the Judges, to give so much respect to a commitment by the Command of the King,
or the Privy Council, which are ever intended to be don in just and weighty
causes, that they will not presently let them free, but bail them to answer
what shall be objected against them on his Majesty's behalf; but if any other
inferior Officer do commit a man without showing cause, they do instantly
deliver him, as having no cause to expect their leisure. So the delivery is
applied to an imprisonment by the command of some mean minister of Justice,
Bayling when it is done by the command of the King or his Counsel.

6. Object.
It was urged by Mr. Attorney, that Bayling is a grace and favor of a Court of
Justice, and that they may refuse to do it. Le Rns.
This was agreed to be true in diverse cases, as where the cause appears to be
for felony or other crimes expressed, for that there is another way to
discharge them in convenient time by their trial, and yet in these cases the
constant practice has been anciently and modernly to bail men, but where no
cause of the imprisonment is returned, but the Command of the King, there is no
way to deliver such persons by trial or otherwise, but that of the Habeas
Corpus. And if they should be then remanded, they might be perpetually
imprisoned without any remedy at all, and consequently a man that had committed
no offense might be in worse case then a great offender, for the later should
have an ordinary trial to discharge him, the other should never be delivered.
7. Objection.
It was further said, that though the Statute of Westminster 1. cap. 15. be a
Statute which by way of provision did extend only to the Sheriff, yet the
recital of that touching the four causes wherein a man was not repleviseable
at the common law, namely those that were committed for the death of a man, by
the command of the King, or of his Justices, or for the Forest, did declare
that the Justices could not bail such a one, and that repleviseable and
bayleable were Synomina all one, and that Stanford a Judge of great authority
does expound it accordingly, Stan. pl. Cor. 72.
and that neither the Statute nor he say repleviseable by the Sheriff, but
generally without restraint; And that if the chief Justice committed a man,
he is not to be enlarged by any other Court, as appears in the Register. Le
Rns.
To this it was answered, That the recital of the body of the Statute,
relates only to the Sheriff only, as appears by the very words. 2. That
Repleviseable is to the Sheriff, for that the word imports no more, but a man
committed by the chief Justice, is bayleable by the Court of Kings Bench. 3.
That Stanford means all of the Sheriff, or at least he has not sufficiently
expressed that he intended the Justices. 4. It was denied that Repleviseable
and bayleable was the same, for they differ in respect of the place where they
are used, bail being in the Kings Court of record, Repleviseable before the
Sheriff, and they are of several natures, repleviable being a letting at large
upon surety, bayling being when one traditur in Balliv. the bail are his
Iaylors and may imprison him, and shall suffer body for body, which is not of
replevying by Sureties, and differs from Mainprise in this, Diversity enter
bail and mainprise.
Mainprise is an undertaking in a some certain, Bayling to answer the
condemnation in Civil causes, and for criminal, body for body. And the
reasons and authorities in the first Conference were then renewed, and no
exceptions taken to any save that in 22. H. 6. it does not appear that the
command of the King was by his mouth, which must be intended, or by his
Counsel, which is all one, as is observed by Stanford, for the words are that
a man is not repleviseable by the Sheriff, who is committed by the Writ or the
commandment of the King, 21. Ed. 1. Rot. 2. Dors. was Cyted by the Kings
Counsel, that it was answered, that it concerned the Sheriff of Leicester
shire only, and not the power of the Judges, 33. H. 6. the Kings Attorney
confessed was nothing to the purpose, and yet that Book has been usually
cited by those that maintain the contrary to the Declaration of the Commons.
And therefore such sudden opinions as have been given thereupon are not to be
regarded the foundation failing. And where it was said that the French of 36.
Ed. 3. Rot. parliamenti numero 9. which can receive no answer did not warrant
what was inferred thence, but that these words Sauns disturbance mettre, ou
arrest fair, and le contre per special mandement ou autre mannere must be
understood, that the Statute should be put in execution without putting
disturbance, or making arrest to the contrary by special command or in other
manner, The Commons did utterly deny the interpretation given by the Kings
Counsel, and to justify their own, did appeal to all men that understood
the French, and upon the 7. Statutes did conclude, that their Declaration
remained an undoubted truth, not controlled by any thing said to the contrary.

Mr. Seldens Argument.
The Argument which by the Command of the House of Commons was made at their
first conference with the Lords, touching the personal liberty of the person
of every Freeman, out of Presidents of Record, and resolutions of Judges in
former times.
MY LORDS,
YOur Lordships have heard from the Gentleman that last spoke a great part of
the grounds upon which the House of Commons upon mature deliberation proceeded
to that clear resolution touching the right of the liberty of their persons.
The many Acts of Parliament, which are the written laws of the Land, and are
expressly in the point, have been read and opened, and such Objections as have
been by some made to them, and some Objections also made out of another Act of
Parliament, have been cleared and answered. It may seem now perhaps (my
Lords) that little remains needful to be further added, for the inforcement
and maintenance of so fundamental and established a right and liberty
belonging to every Freeman of the Kingdom. But in the examination of
questions of Law of right, besides the Laws or Acts of Parliament, that ought
chiefly to direct and regulate every man's judgment, whatsoever has been put
in practice to the contrary, there are commonly used also former Judgments or
Presidents, and indeed have been so used sometimes, that the weight of reason,
of law, and of Acts of Parliament, has been laid by, and resolutions have
been made, and that in this very point, only upon the interpretation and
apprehension of Presidents. Presidents my Lords are good media or proofs of
illustration or confirmation where they agree with the express Law, but they
can never be proof enough to overthrow any one law much less seven several
Acts of Parliament as the number of them is for the point. The house of Commons
therefore taking into consideration that in this question being of so high a
nature that never any exceeding it in any Court of Justice whatsoever all the
several ways of just examination of the truth should be used, have also most
carefully informed themselves of all former judgments or presidents concerning
this great point either way, and have been no less careful of the due
preservation of his Majesty's just prerogative then of their own rights. The
Presidents here are of two kinds, either merely matter of record, or else the
former resolutions of the Judges after solemn debate in the point.

This point that concerns presidents the House of Commons have commanded me to
present to your Lordships, which I shall as briefly as I may, so I do it
faithfully and perspicuously. To that end my Lords, before I come to the
particulars of any of those Presidents, I shall first remember to your
Lordships, that which will seem as a general key for the opening and true
apprehension of all them of Record, without which key no man unless he be
verst in the entries and course of the Kings Bench can possibly understand them.

In all cases my Lords where any right or liberty belongs to the Subjects by
any positive law written or unwritten, if there were not also a remedy by Law
for the enjoying or regaining this right or liberty when it is violated or
taken from him, the positive law were most vain and to no purpose, and it were
to no purpose, for any man to have any right in any land or other inheritance,
if there were not a known remedy, that is an action or writ, by which in some
Court of ordinary Justice he might recover it. And in this case of right of
liberty of person, if there were not a remedy in the Law for regaining it
when it is restrained, it were of no purpose to speak of laws that ordain it
should not be restrained. Therefore in this case also I shall first show you
the remedy that every Freeman is to use for the regaining of his liberty
when he is against law imprisoned, that so upon the legal course and form to
be held in using that remedy, the Presidents or Judgments upon it, for all
Judgments of Record rise out of this remedy, may be easily understood. There
are in law diverse remedies for enlarging of a Freeman imprisoned, as the
writts of Odio and Atia, and of Homine replegiando, besides the common or most
known Writs of Habeas Corpus, or Corpus cum causa, as it is called also.

The first two Writs are to be directed to the Sherifs of the County, and lie
in some particular Cases, with which it would be untimely for me to trouble
your Lordships, because they concern not that which is committed to my charge.
But that Writ of Habeas Corpus, or Corpus cum causa, is the highest remedy in
Law for any man that is imprisoned, and the only remedy for him that is
imprisoned by the special command of the King, or the Lords of the Privy
Counsel, without showing cause of the commitment, neither is there in the law
any such thing, nor was there ever mention of any such thing in the Laws of
this Land, as a Petition of right to be used in such cases for liberty of the
person, nor is there any legal course for enlargement to be taken in such
cases, howsoever the contrary has upon no ground or color of law been
pretended. Now my Lords, if any man be so imprisoned by any such command, or
other wise, in any prison whatsoever through England, and desire by himself,
or any other in his behalf, this Writ of Habeas Corpus for the purpose in the
Court of the Kings Bench, the Writ is to be granted to him, and ought not to be
denied him, no otherwise then another ordinary original Writ in the Chancery,
or other common Process of law may be denied, which amongst other things the
House resolved also, upon mature deliberation, and I was commanded to let your
Lord sh. know so much. This Writ is directed to the Keeper of the Prison in
whose custody the prisoner remains, commanding him that after a certain day
he bring in the body of the prisoner, ad Subiiciend. and recipiend. juxta quod
curia conceda verit, etc. una cum causa Captionis, and detentionis, and
oftentimes una cum causa detentionis only, captionis being omitted.

The Keeper of the prison thereupon returns by what warrant he detaines the
prisoner, and with his return filed to his Writ, brings the prisoner to the
Bar at the time appointed; When the return is thus made, the Court judges
of the sufficiency or insufficiency of it, only out of the body of it, without
having respect to any other thing whatsoever; that is they to suppose the
return to be true whatsoever it be, if it be false, the prisoner may have his
action on the Case against the Jailer that brought him. Now my Lords, when the
prisoner comes thus to the Bar, if he desire to be bayled, and that the Court
upon the view of the return think him in Law to be bayleable, then he is
always first taken from the keeper of the Prison that brings him, and
committed to the Marshall of the Kings Bench, and afterward bayled, and the
entry perpetually is Committitur Mariscallo and postea traditur in Ball', for
the Court never bayles any man, until he first become their own prisoner, and
be in Custodia Marriscall' of that Court. But if upon the return of the Habeas
Corpus it appear to the Court, that the prisoner ought not to be bayled, nor
discharged from the prison whence he is brought, then he is remanded or sent
back again there to continue, until by course of law he may be delivered, and
the entry in this Case is Remittitur quousque secundum legem deliberatus
fuerit, or Remittitur quousque, etc. which is all one, and the highest award or
judgment that ever was or can be given upon a Habeas Corpus. But if the Judges
doubt only whether in Law they ought to take him from the prison whence he
came, or give a day to the Sheriff to amend his Writ, as often they do, then
they remaund him only, during the time of their doubt, or until the Sheriff
has amended his return, and the Entry upon that is Remittitur only, or
Remittitur prisonae praed, without any more. And so remittitur generally is of
far less moment in the award upon the Habeas Corpus, then remittitur
quousque, etc. howsoever the vulgar opinions raised out of the late Judgment
be to the contrary. All these things are of most known and constant use in the
Court of Kings Bench, as it cannot be doubted but your Lordships will easily
know from the grave and learned my Lords the Judges.

These two courses, the one of the entry of Committitus Marescall. and postea
traditur in Ballium, and the other remittitur quousque, etc. and Remittitur
generally, or Remittitur prisonae pred, together with the nature of the Habeas
corpus, thus stated, it will be easier for me to open, and your Lordships to
observe, whatsoever shall occur to the purpose in the Presidents of record,
to which I shall come now in the particular. But before I am come to the
Presidents, I am to let you know the resolutions of the house of Commons
touching the enlargement of a man committed by the command of the King, or the
Privy Counsel, or any other, without cause showed of such commitment, it is
thus; That if a Freeman be committed or detained in prison or otherwise
restrained by the command of the King, the Privy Counsel, or any other, and
no cause of such commitment, deteiner, or restraint, to be expressed for which
by law he ought to be committed, detained, or restrained, and the same be
returned upon a Habeas Corpus granted for the party, then he ought to be
delivered and bayled.

This resolution as it is grounded upon the Acts of Parliament already shown,
and the reason of the law of the Land, which is committed to the charge of
another, and anon also to be opened to you, is strengthened also by many
Presidents of Record.

But the Presidents of Record that concern this point are of two kinds, for
the House of Commons has informed it self of such as concern it either way.
The first such as show expressly that persons committed by the command of the
King or of the Privy Counsel without other cause showed have been enlarged
upon bail when they prayed it, whence it appears clearly, that by the law
they are bayleable, and so by Habeas Corpus to be set at liberty, for though
they ought not to have been committed without a cause showed of the
commitment, yet it is true that the reverend Judges of this Land did such
respect to such commitments by the command of the King or of the Lords of the
Counsel (as also to the commitment sometimes of inferior persons) that upon
the Habeas Corpus, they rarely used absolutely to discharge the persons
instantly, but only to enlarge them upon Bail, which sufficiently secures and
preserves the liberty of the Subject according to the laws that your Lordships
have already heard, nor in any of the cases is there any difference made
between such co^mitments by the Lords of the Counsel, that are incorporated
with him. The second kind of Presidents of Record are such as have been
pretended to prove the law to be contrary, and that persons so committed ought
not to be set at liberty upon bail, and are in the nature of Objections out
of Record.

I shall deliver them summarily to your Lordships with all faith, and also true
Copies of them, out of which it shall appear clearly to your Lordships, that
of those of the first kind there are no less then 12. most full and directly
in the point to prove that persons so committed are to be delivered upon bail,
and amongst those of the other kind, there is not so much as one, not one, that
proves at all any thing to the contrary; I shall first my Lords go through
them of the first kind, and so observe them to your Lordships, that such
scruples as have been made upon them by some that have excepted against them
shall be cleared also, according as I shall open them severally.

Pasc. 18. Ed. 3. Bildestons Case.
The first of the first kind is of Ed. 3. time, it is in Pasche 18. Ed 3. Rot.
33. The Case was thus;

King Ed. 3. had committed by Writ, and that under his great Seal (as most of
the Kings commands in those times were) one John de Bildeston a Clergy man to
the prison to the Tower without any cause showed of the commitment. The
Lieutenant of the Tower is commanded to bring him to the Kings Bench, where he
is committed to the Marshall, but the Court asks of the Lieutenant, if there
were any cause to keep this Bildeston in prison, besides that commitment of the
King, he answered no, whereupon the Roll says, Quia videtur cur bre. praed.
sufficient. non esse causam praed. Johan, de Bildeston in prisona Dom Regis hic
detinend' idem Johannes admittitur per manucaptionem Willielmi de Wakefield,
and some others, where the Judgment of the point is fully declared in the very
point.

22. H. 8. Parkers Case.
The second in the first kind of Presidents of Record is in the time of H. 8.
one John Parkers Case, who was committed to the Sheriff of London, pro
securitate pacis, at the suite of one Brinton, ac pro suspitione feloniae
committed by him in Glocestershire, ac per mandatu^ Dom. Rs. he is committed to
the Marshall of the Kings Bench, and postea isto eodem termino traditur in
Ball' here were other causes of the commitment, but plainly one was by the
command of the King, signified to the Sheriff of London, of which they took
notice, but some have interpreted this, as if the commitment had been for
suspicion of felony by the command of the King, in which case it is agreeable
of all hands, that the Prisoner is bayleable, but no man can think so of this
president that observes the context and understands the Grammar of it, wherein
most plainly ac per mandatu^ Dom. Regis has no reference to any other cause
whatsoever, but is as a single Cause enumerated in the return by it self, as
the Record clearly shows, it is in 22. H. 8. Rot. 37.

35. H. 8. Bincks Case.
The third is of the same Kings time, it is 35. H. 8. Rot. 33. John Bincks
Case, he was committed by the Lords of the Counsel pro suspitioniae feloniae
ac pro aliis causis illos moventibus qui committitur Mariscallo and immediate
ex gratia curiae speciali traditur in Ball' They committed him for suspicion of
felony and other causes them thereunto moving, wherein there might be matter
of State, or whatsoever else can be supposed, and plainly the cause of their
commitment is not expressed, yet the Court bayled him without having regard to
these unknown causes that moved the Lords of the Counsel. But it is indeed
some difference from either of those other 2. that precede, and from the other
9. also that follow, for it is agreed, that if a cause be expressed in the
return, insomuch that the Court can know why he is committed, that then he may
be bayled, but not if they know not the cause, now a man is committed for a
cause expressed, and pro aliis causis Dominos de Consilio moventibus, certainly
the Court can no more know in such a case what the cause is, then any other.

2. and 3. P and Mar. Overtons Case.
The fourth of these is in the time of Queen Mary, it is Pasche 2. and 3. P.
and Mar. Rot. 58. Overtons Case, Richard Overton was returned upon a Habeas
Corpus, directed to the Sherifes of London, to have been committed to them and
deteyned per mandatum pranobilium Dominorum honorabilis consilij Dominorum
Regis and Reginae, Qui committitur Mar. and immediate traditur in Ball'. In
answer to this President, or by way of objection to the force of it, It has
been said that this Overton at this time stood indicted of high treason. It is
true, he was so indicted, but that appears in another Roll, that has no
reference to the return, as the return has no reference to that Roll, yet
they that object this against the force of this President, say that because he
was Indicted of Treason, therefore though he were committed by the Command of
the Lords of the Counsel without cause showed, yet he was bayleable for the
Treason, and upon that was here bayled; Then which objection nothing is more
contrary, either to law or common reason. It is most contrary to law, for that
clearly every return is to be adjudged by the Court out of the body of it
self, and not by any other collateral or foreign Record whatsoever,
Therefore the matter of Indictment here, cannot in law be cause of bayling of
the Prisoner, And so it is averse to all common reason, that if the objection
be admitted, it must of necessity follow, that whosoever shall be committed by
the King, or the Privy Counsel, without cause showed, and be not indicted of
Treason or some other offense, may not be enlarged, for by reason of
supposition of matter of State, But that whosoever is so committed, and withal
stands so indicted though in another Record may be enlarged, whatsoever the
matter of State be for which he was committed. The absurdity of which
assertion needs not a word for further confutation, as if any of the Gent. in
the last judgment, ought to have been the sooner delivered, if he had been
also Indicted of Treason, if so, Traitors and Fellons have the highest
privilege in personal liberty, and that above all other Subjects of the
Kingdom.

4. and 5. Phil. and Mar. Newports Case.
The fifth of this kind is of Queen Mary's time also, it is Pasch. 4. and 5.
P. and Mar. Rot. 45. the Case of Edward Newport, he was brought into the Kings
Bench by Habeas Corpus out of the Tower of London, Cum causa, vizt. Quod
Commissus fuit per mandatum Concilii Dominae Reginae qui committitur Mar. and
immediate traditur in Ballium.

Un objection Rnde.
To this the like answer has been made, as to that other Case of Overtons
next before cited, they say that in another roll of another term of the same
year, it appears he was in question for suspicion of Coining, and it is true
he was so, But the return and his Commitment mentioned in it have no reference
to any such offense, nor has the Baylement of him relation to any thing but to
the absolute commitment by the privy Counsel: So that the answer to the like
objection made against Overtons Case satisfies this also.

9 El. Lawrences Case.
The sixth of these is of Queen Elizabeth's time, Mich. 9. El. Rot. 35: the
case of Tho. Lawrence; this Lawrence came in by Habeas Corpus, returned by the
Sheriffs of London to be detained in prison per mandat. Consilij Dominae Regina
qui Committitue Mar. and super hoc traditur in Ballium.

Objection Rend.
An objection has been invented against this also, it has been said that
this man was pardoned, and indeed it appears so in the Margin of the roll,
where the word pardonatur is entered, but clearly his in largement by Bail was
upon the body of the return only, unto which that note of pardon in the
Margin of the roll has no relation at all, and can any man think, that a man
pardoned (for what offense soever it be) might not as well be committed for
some Arcanum, or matter of State, as one that is not pardoned, or out of his
innocence wants no pardon?

9 El. Constables Case.
The seventh of these is in the same year, and of Easter Term following, it
is P. 9. El. Rot. 68 To. Constables Case, he was brought by Habeas Corpus out
of the Tower, and in the return it appeared he was committed there, per
mandatum privati Consiliidictae Dominae Reginae qui Comittitur Mar. and
posteae isto eodem ter. traditur in Ball. The like objection has been made to
this, as that before of Lawrence, but the self same answer clearly satisfies
for them both.

20 El. Brownings Case.
The 8. is of the same Queens time in Pas. 20 El Rot. 72. John Brownings Case.
This Browning came by Habeas Corpus out of the Tower, whether he had been
committed, and was returned to have been committed, per private. Consil. Dominae
Reginae qui comittitur Mar. and postea isto codem termino traditur in Ball.
Objection Rnde.
To this it has been said, that it was done at the chief Justice Wrayes
Chamber, and not in the Court: and thus the authority of the President has
been lesned or slighted. If it had been done at his Chamber, it would have
proved at least this much, that Sir Christopher Wray then chief Justice of the
Kings Bench, being a grave learned and upright Judge, knowing the Law to be so,
did Bail this Browning, and enlarge him, and even so far the President were
of value enough; but it is plain, that though the habeas corpus were
returnable, as indeed it appears in the Record it self, at his Chamber in
Sergeants Inn; yet he only committed him to the Kings Bench presently, and
referred the consideration of enlarging him to the Court, who afterward did it:
For the Record says, Et postea isto eodem termino traditur in Ball. which
cannot be of an enlargement at the chief Justice Chamber.

40 El. Hare-Courts Case.
The ninth of this first kind is Hill. 40. El. Rot. 62. Edward Hare Courts
Case, he was imprisoned in the Gatehouse, and that per Domines de private
Consilio Dominae Reginae pro certis causis eos moventibus and ei ignotis, And
upon his habeas corpus was returned to be therefore only detained, Qui
Comittitur Mar. and postea isto eodem termino traditur in Ball. To this never
any color of answer has been yet offered.

43 El. Catesbies Case.
The tenth is Catesbies Case in the vacation after Hill. Term 43. El. Rot.
Robert. Catesbie was committed to the Fleet per war rantum diversor. pro
nobilium viroy de privato Consilio Domine Regina: He was brought before Justice
Fenner, one of the then Justices of the Kings Bench by Habeas Corpus at
Winchester house Southwark, Et homiss. fuit Mar. per prefat. Edwardum Fenner
and statim traditur in Ball.

12 Iac. Beckwiths Case.
The eleventh is Rich Beckwiths Case, which was in Hill. 12 of K. James Rot.
153. He was returned upon his Habeas corpus to have been committed to the
Gatehouse by diverse Lords of the privy Counsel, Qui committitur Mar. and
postea esto eodem termino traditur in Ball.

Objection Rnde.
To this it has bin said by some, that Beckwith was bayled upon a letter,
written by the Lords of the Counsel to that purpose to the Judges, but it
appears not that there was ever any letter written to them to that purpose,
which though it had been, would have proved nothing against the authority of
the Record: for it was never heard of that Judges were to be directed in point
of law by letters from the Lords of the Counsel, although it cannot be
doubted, but that by such letters, sometimes they have been moved to bail men
that would or did not ask their enlargement without such letters, as in some
examples I shall show your Lordships among the presidents of the second kind.

14 Iac. Sir Tho. Mounsons Case.
The 12 and last of these, is that of Sir Tho. Mounsons Case, it is Mich. 14.
Jac. Rot. 147. He was committed to the Tower per warrantum a diversis Dominis
de privato Consilio Domini Regis locum tenenti directum, And he was returned by
the Lieutenant to be therefore detained in prison, qui committitur Mar. and
super hoc traditur in Ball.

Objection Rnde.
To this it has been answered, that every body knows by common fame, that
this Gentleman was committed for suspicion of the death of Sir Tho. Overbury,
and that he was therefore bayleable; a most strange interpretation, as if the
body of the return, and the warrant of the privy Counsel, should be
understood, and adjudged out of fame only; was there not as much a fame why
the Gentlemen that were remanded in the last judgment were committed, and
might not the self same reason have served to enlarge them, their offense (if
any were) being I think much less then that for which this Gentleman was
suspected?

And thus I have faithfully opened the number of 12 Presidents most express in
the very point in question, and cleared the objections that have been made
against them.

And of such presidents of Record as are of the first kind, which prove
plainly the practice of former ages, and judgment of the Court of Kings Bench,
in the very point, on the behalf the Subject, my Lords hitherto.

I am come next to those of the second kind, or such as are pretended that
persons so committed are not to be enlarged by the Judges upon the habeas
corpus brought, but to remain in prison still at the command of the King or
the privy Counsel.

Presidents del 2. sort. vouch per le Roy.
These are of two natures, the first of these are where some assent of the King
or the privy Counsel appears upon the enlargement of a prisoner so
committed, as if that because such assent appears, the enlargement could not
have been without such assent.

The second of this kind are those which have been urged as express
testimonies of the Judges denying bail, and in such cases, I shall open these
also to your ships, which being done, it will most clearly appear, that there
is nothing at all in any of these that makes any thing at all against the
resolution of the house of Commons touching this point: nay, it is so far
from their making any thing against it, that some of them add good weight also
to the proof of that resolution.

Temps H. 7 Brugs Case.
For those of the first nature of this second kind of Presidents, they begun in
the time of H. 7. Tho. Brugge, and diverse others were imprisoned in the Kings
ad mandatum Dom. Regis, they never sought remedy by habeas corpus, or
otherwise, for ought appears: But the Roll says, that Dominus Rex relaxavit
mandatum, and so they were bayled. But can any man think that this is an
Argument either in Law or common reason, that therefore they could not have
been bayled without such assent? It is common in Cases of common persons, that
one being in prison for surety of the peace or the like, at the suit of
another, is bayled upon the release of the party plaintiff; Can it follow,
that therefore he could not have been bayled without such release? nothing is
more plain then the contrary. It were the same thing to say, that if it
appear, that if a plaintiff be non suit, therefore unless he had been non
suit, he could not have been barred in the suit. The Case last cited is, Mich.
7. H. 7 rot. 6.

7 H. 7. Bartholomews Case.
The very like is in the same year, Hill 7. H. 7. Rot. 13. The Case of Will.
Bartholomew, Will. Chase and diverse others, and the self same answer that is
given to the other cleares this.

7 H. 7. Beomonds Case.
So in the same year Pas. 7. H. 7 rot. 18. John Beomonds Case is the same in
substance with those other two, and the self same answer also satisfies that
cleares them.

12 H. 7. Yews Case.
The next Case is, Mich. 12. H. 7. rot. 8. Tho. Yews Case, he was committed ad
sec. pacis, for the security of the peace, at the suit of one Freeman, and
besides, ad mandatum Dom. Regis, And first, Freeman relaxavit sec. pacis, and
then Sir James Hubbard, the then Kings Attomey General relaxavit mandatum Dom
Regis, And hereupon he is bayled, the release of the Kings Attomy, no more
proves that he could not have bin enlarged, without such release or assent,
then that he could not have bin bayled, without release of surety of the peace
by Freeman.

9 H. 7. Bochers Case.
The very like is in Hill. 9. H. 7. rot. 14. The Case of Humphry Boch, which
proves no more here then the rest of this kind already cited.

39 Eliza. Broomes case
Then for this point also Broomes Case of Queen Elizabeth's time, is Trim. 39.
El. rot. 128. Lawrence Broom was committed to the Gatehouse per mandatum Dom.
Consilii Dominae Reginae, And being returned so upon the habeas corpus, is
first committed to the Marshalsey as the course is, and then bayled by the
Court, which indeed is an express president, that might perhaps well have been
added to the number of the first 12, which so plainly show the practice of
enlarging prisoners in this Case, by judgment of the Court upon the habeas
corpus, But it is true, that in the scrowles of that year where the bayles are
entered, but not in the Record of the Habeas Corpus, there was a note, that this
Broom was bayled per mandatum privati Consilii, but plainly this is not any
kind of Argument, that therefore in law he might not have been other wise
bayled.

40 Wendens Case.
The self same is to be said of another of this kind, in Mich. 40. El. rot.
37. Wendens Case, Tho. Wenden was committed to the Gatehouse by the Queen and
the Lords of the Counsel procertis causis generally, he is brought by Habeas
corpus into the Kings Bench, and bayled by the Court. But it is said, that in
the Scrowles of that year it appears, that his enlargement was pro consensum
Dom. privati Consilii, and it is true that the Queens Attorney did tell the
Court, that the Lords of the Counsel did assent to it. Follows it therefore
that it could not have been without such assent.

43 Eliz.
Next is Hill. 43. El. rot. 89. when diverse Gentlemen of special quality were
imprisoned by the command of the Privy Counsel, the Queen being graciously
pleased to enlarge them, sends a commandment to the Judges of the Kings Bench,
that they should take such a course, for the delivering of them upon bail as
they should think fit, and they did so, and enlarged them upon Writs of hab.
corpus. Follows it therefore, that this might not have been done by law, if
the parties themselves had desired it.

Iac. Sir Io. Brockets Case.
So in Tr. 1 Jac. rot. 30. Sir Io. Brocket being committed to the Gatehouse, is
returned to stand committed pro mandatum pravati Consilii, and he is enlarged
virtute warranti. a Consilio predicti. But the same answer that satisfy for
the rest before cited, serves for this also.

12 Iac. James Reynar Case
The last of these, is Reynars case, in Mich. 12. Iac. rot. 119. he was
committed to the Gatehouse, by the Lords of the Counsel, and being brought into
the Kings Bench by Habeas Corpus, is enlarged upon bayl, but this they say was
upon a letter written from one of the Lords of the Counsel to the Judges. It
is true that such a letter was written, but the answer to the former presidents
of this nature, are sufficient to clear this also.

And in all these observe:

1 That it appears not, that the party ever desired to be enlarged by the
Court, or was denied it.

2 Letters either from the King or Counsel cannot alter the law in any case:
So that hitherto, nothing has been brought on the contrary part, that has
any force or color of reason in it.

We come now my Lords to those presidents of the other nature cited against
the liberty of the Subject: That is, such as have been used to mislike, that
persons so committed may not be enlarged by the Court.

They are in number eight, but there is not one of them that proves any such
thing, as your Lordships will plainly see uponopening them.

The first four of them are exactly in the same words, saving that the names
of the persons and the prisons differ, I shall therefore recite them all one
after another, and then clear them together.

7 H. 7. Everards Case.
The first is Richard Everards case, Hill. 7. H. 7. rot. 18. he and others were
committed to the Marshalley of the Household per mandatum Dom. Regis, and so
returned upon a habeas corpus into the Kings Bench, whereupon the entry is
only Qui committitur Mar. etc.

8 H. 7. Cherries Case.
The second is Hill. 8. H. 7. Richard Cherries case he was committed to the
Major of Windsor per mandatum Dom. Regis, and so returned upon a habeas corpus,
and the entry is only Qui committitur Mar. etc.

9 H. 7. Burtons Case.
The third is Hill. 9. H. 7. rot. 14. Christopher Burtons case, who was
committed to the Marshalsey of the Household, per mandatum Dom. Regis, and so
returned upon his habeas corpus, and the entry is likewise Qui committitur
Mar. etc.

19 H. 7. Vrswicks Case.
The fourth is George Vrswicks case, Pas. 19. H. 7 Rot. 19. he was committed to
the Sheriffs of London per mandatum Dom. Regis, and returned so upon his habeas
corpus, Qui committitur Mar. etc.

These four have been used principally, as express presidents, to prove that
a prisoner so committed cannot be enlarged, and perhaps at the first sight, to
men that know not, and observe not the course and entries of the Court of Kings
Bench, they may be apprehended to prove as much, but in truth they rather prove
the contrary, at least there is no color in them of any such matter as they
have been used for. To which purpose I beseech your Lordships to call to your
memories, that which I first observed to you touching the course of that Court.
Where a prisoner is brought in by habeas corpus, he is (if he be not to be
remanded) first committed to the Marshall of the Court, and then bayled as his
case requires. This is so certain as it can never be otherwise. Now these men
being thus committed express command of the King, are first you see taken from
the prisons whither they were first committed, wherein you may observe my
Lords, that if a general suspicion of matter of State were of force in such a
case, it might be as needful in point of State to have the prisoner remain in
the prison where the King by such an absolute command committed him, as to have
him at all committed; when they have taken them from the prisons where before
they were they commit them to the Marshall of their own Court, which is but
the first step to bayling them: now it appears not indeed that they were
bayled, for then Traditur in Ball. had followed, but nothing at all appears
that they were denied it, perhaps they never asked it, perhaps they could not
find such as were sufficient to bail them. And in truth whenever any man is
but removed from any prison in England (though it be for debt or trespass
only) into that Court, the entry is but in the self same sillables as in
these four cases.

And in truth if these proceedings did prove, that any of the prisoners named
in them were not bayleable, or had been thought by the Court not to have been
bayleable, it will necessarily follow, that no man living that is ordinarily
removed from any prison into the Kings Bench, or that is there upon any
ordinary action of debt, or action of trespass, could be bayled, for every
man that is brought thither, and not remanded, and every man that is arested
but for a debt or trespass and was returned into that Court, is likewise
committed to the Marshall of that Court, and by the self same entry, and not
otherwise; yet these four havebeen much stood on, and have strangely misled
the judgment of some that did not, or would not seem to understand the course
of that Court.

7 H. 8. Pages Case.
The fifth of this nature is, Edward Pages case, it is Tr. 7. H. 8. this might
have been well reckoned with the former four, had not the misentry of the
Clerk only made it vary from them. Ed. Page was committed to the Marshalsea of
the Household, and that per mandatum Dom. Regis, and returned to be therefore
detained, and the entry is Qui committitur Mar. Hospitii Dom. Regis, This word
Mar. is written in the Margin of the roll; this has been used to prove,
that the Judges remanded this prisoner, if they had done so, the remanding had
been only while they advised, and not any such award which is given when they
adjudge him not bayleable; but in truth the word Committitur shows, that there
was not any remanding of him, nor does that Court ever commit any man to the
Marshalsea of the Household: and besides the word Mar. for Marrescallo in the
Margin, shows plainly that he was committed to the Marshall of the Kings
Bench, and not remanded to the Marshalsea of the Household, for such entry of
that word in the Margin, is perpetually in cases of that nature, when they
commit a man to their own prison, and so give him the first step to baylement,
which he may have if he ask it, and can find bail; and doubtless these words
of Hospitii pred. were added by the error of the Clerk for wnat of distinction
in his understanding from the Mar. of the Kings Bench to the Marshall of the
Household.

8 Iac. Caesar's Case.
The sixth of these is Tho. Caesar's Case, it is 8 Iac. rot. 99. This Casar was
committed to the Marshalsea of the Household per mandatum Dom. Regis, and
returned to be therefore detained, and indeed a remittitur is in the roll, but
not a remittitur quousque, but only that kind of remittitur which is only
used while the Court advises. And in truth this is so far from proving any
thing against the resolution of the House of Commons, That it appears that the
opinion of the reverend Judges of that time was, that the return was
insufficient, and that if it were not amended, the prisoner should be
discharged. For in the Book of Rules in the Court of Mich. Term (when Caesar's
Case was in question) they expressly ordered, that if the Stewards Marshall did
not amend their return, the prisoner should be absolutely discharged, the
words of the Rule are Nisi Seneschalus and Maniscal. Hospitii Dom Regis
sufficientur returnaverint brevem de Habeas Corpus Thome Caesar dier. mercur.
prox. per ost. quindenam scilicet Martium. def. exonerabitur. And this is also
the force of that President, but yet there has been an interpretation upon
this rule. It has been said that the Judges gave this rule, because the truth
was, that the return was false, and that it was well known, that the prisoner
was not committed by the immediate command of the King, but by the command of
the Lord Chamberlain, and thence (as it was said) they made this rule: but
this kind of interpretation is the first that ever was supposed, that Judges
should take notice of the truth or falsehood of the return otherwise, then the
body of the return could inform them. And the rule it self speaks plainly
of them, sufficiency only, and not of the truth or falsehood of it.

Emersons Case.
The seventh of these is the case of James Desmaistres, Edward Emerson, and
some others that were brewers, and were committed to the Marshalsea of the
Household per mandat. Dom. Regis, and so returned upon habeas corpus, and it is
true, that the roll shows that they were remanded, but the remanding was only
upon advisement, and indeed the grave and upright Judges of the time were so
careful, least upon the entry of the remanding, any such mistake might be, as
might perhaps mislead posterity in so great a point, that they would expressly
have this word (immediate) added to the Remittitur, that so all men that should
meet with the roll might see, that it was done for the present only, and not
upon any debate of the question. And besides, that there is no quousque to it,
which is usually added; when the highest award upon debate or resolution of
this kind is given by them.

12. Iam Sir Samuel Saltonstalls Case.
The eighth of these is the Case of Saltonstall, it is Hill. 12. Iac. Sir.
Samuel Saltonstall was committed to the Fleet, per mandatum Dom. Regis; and
besides, by the Court of Chauncery, for disobeying an order of that Court, and
is returned upon his habeas corpus, to be therefore detained. And it is true
that a Remittitur is entered in the roll, but it is only a remittitur prisoner
prodict'. without quousque secundum legem de liberatus fuerit, and in truth it
appears on the Record, that the Court gave the Warden of the Fleet, three
several days at several times, to amend his return, and in the interim
remittitur person pred'. Certainly if the Court had thought that the return
had been good, they would not have given so many several days to have
amended it, for if that Mandatum Dom. Regis had been sufficient in the Case,
why need it to have been amended.

13. Iac. Sir Samuel Saltonstalls Case.
The ninth and last of these is, Tr. 13. Iac. Rot. 71. The Case of the same Sir
Samuel Saltonstall, he is returned by the Warden of the Fleet, and in the Case
before, and generally remittitur, is in the roll which proves nothing at all,
that therefore the Court thought he might not by law be enlarged; and besides
in both cases he stood committed also for disobeying an order in the Chauncery.

These are all that have been pretended to the contrary in this great point,
and upon the view of them thus opened to our Lordships, it is plain, that
there is not one, not so much as one at all; that proves any such thing, as
that persons committed by the command of the King, or the Lords of the Counsel
without cause showed, might not be enlarged, but indeed the most of them
expressly prove rather the contrary.

Now my Lords, having thus gone through the Presidents of Record, that concern
the point of either side, before I come to the other kind of Presidents, which
are the solemn resolutions of Judges in former times, I shall (as I am
commanded also by the House of Commons) represent unto your Lordships somewhat
else; they have thought very considerable; with which they met, whilst they
were in a most careful enquiry of whatsoever concerned them in this great
question.

It is my Lords a draught of an entry of a judgment in that great case lately
adjudged in the Court of Kings Bench, when diverse Gentlemen imprisoned per
speciale mandatu^ Dom. Regis, were by the award and order of the Court, after
solemn debate, sent back to prison, because it was expressly said, they could
not in Justice deliver them, though they prayed to be bayled. The case is
famous, and well known to your Lordships, therefore I need not further to
mention it, as yet indeed there is no judgment entered upon the Roll, but there
is room enough for any kind of judgment to be entered. But my Lords, there is a
form of a judgment, a most unusual one; such a one as never was in any such
case before (for indeed there was never before any Case so adjudged) and thus
drawn upon by a chief Clerk of that Court (by direction of M. Attorney
general) as the House was informed by the Clerk, in which the reason of the
judgment, and remanding of those Gent. is expressed in such sort, as if it
should be declared upon Record for ever, that the Laws were, that no man could
ever be enlarged from imprisonment that stood committed by such an absolute
command.

The draught is only in Sir John Heninghams Case, being one of the Gent. that
was remanded, and it was made for a form for all the rest. The words of it are
after the usual entry of a Curia advisare vult for a time. That visis retur,
predict. nec non diversis antiquis recordis in Curia hic remaveum consimiles
casus continentibus maturaque deliberatione, inde prius habita eo quod milla
specialis causa captionis sive detentionis pred. Iohanis ex primitur sed
generalitur quod detentus est in prisona pred'. per speciale mandatum Dom.
Regis ideo pred'. Iohanes remittitur prefat. custodi Mar. Hospitii pred'.
Salvo custodiend. quousque etc. that is, quousque legem deliberatus fuerit. And
if that Court that is the highest for ordinary Justice, cannot deliver him
secundem legem. What law is there I beseech you my Lords, that can be sought
for in any other inferior Court to deliver him. Now my Lords, because this
draught, if it were entered in the Roll, (as it was prepared for no other
purpose) would be as great a declaration, contrary to the many Acts of
Parliament already cited, contrary to all Presidents of former times, and to
all reason of Law, to the utter subversion of the highest liberty and right
belonging to every free man of this Kingdom, and for that especially; also it
supposes that diverse ancient Records had been looked into by the Court in like
cases, by which Records their judgments were directed, whereas in truth, there
is not any one Record at all extant that with any color (not so much indeed as
with any color) warrants the judgment, therefore the House of Commons thought
fit also, that I should with the rest that has been said show this draught
also to your Lordships, I come now to the other kind of Presidents, that is,
solemn resolutions of Judges, which being not of Record, remain only in
authentic copies: but of this kind there is but one in this case, that is
the resolution of all the Judges in the time of Queen Elizabeth. It was in the
34 of her reign, when diverse persons had been committed by absolute command,
and delivered by the Justices of the one Bench or the other, whereupon it was
desired, that the Judges would declare in what cases persons committed by such
command were to be enlarged, has been variously cited, and variously
apprehended.

The House of Commons therefore desiring with all care, to inform themselves
as fully of the truth of it, as possibly they might, got into their hands from
a member of their House, a Book of selected cases, collected by a reverend and
learned chief Justice of the common place, that was one of them that gave the
resolution, which is entered at large in that book: I mean the Lord chief
Justice Anderson, it is written in the book with his own hand, as the rest of
the book is, and howsoever it has been cited, and was cited in that great
judgment upon the habeas corpus in the Kings Bench, as if it had been, that
upon such commitments the Judges might not bail the prisoners, yet it is most
plain that in the resolution itself, no such thing is contained, but rather
expressed the contrary, I shall better represent it to your Lordships by
reading it, then by opening it.

Then it was read here.

If this resolution does resolve any thing, it does indeed upon the Jury
resolve fully the contrary to that which has bin pretended, and enough for the
maintenance of the ancient and sundamentall point of liberty of the person, to
be regained by habeas corpus when any is imprisoned. And I the rather thought
it fit now to read it to your Lordships, that it might be at large heard,
because in the great judgment in the Kings Bench, though it were cited at the
bar, as against this point of personal liberty, as also at the Bench, yet
though every thing else of Record that was used, were at large read openly,
this was not read either at Bar or Bench; for indeed if it had, every hearer
would easily have known the force of it, to have been indeed contrary to the
judgment.

My Lords, having thus gone through the Charge committed to me by the House of
Commons, and having thus mentioned to your Lordships, and opened the many
Presidents of Records, and that draught of the judgment in this like case, as
also this resolution, I shall now (as I had leave and direction given me, lest
your Lordships should be put to much trouble, and expense of time in finding or
getting Copies at large of those things which I have cited,) offer also to your
Lordships authentic Copies of them all, and so leave them, and whatsoever
else I have said; to your Lordships further consideration.

the first conference with the Lords touching the liberty of the person of

Finis d' les Presidents.
Sir Edward Cooks Argument.
Iovis 3. Apr. 4. Caroli Regis.
1. REsolved upon the question, that no Freeman ought to be detained or kept
in prison, or other wise restrained by the command of the King, or the Privy
Counsel, or any other, unless some cause of the commitment deteyner or
restraint be expressed, for which by Law he ought to be committed, deteyned or
restrained.

2. That the Writ of Habeas Corpus may not be denied, but ought to be granted
to every man that is committed or deteyned in prison, or otherwise restrained,
though it be by the command of the King, the Privy Counsel or any other, he
praying the same.

That if a Freeman be committed or deteyned in prison or otherwise restrained
by the Command of the King, the Privy Counsel, or any other, no cause of such
commitment, deteyner or restraint being expressed, for which by Law he ought to
be committed, deteyned or restrained, and the same be returned upon a Habeas
Corpus granted for the said party, then he ought to be delivered or bayled. All
these without one negative, that these Acts of Parliament, and these Judicial
presidents in affirmance thereof (recited by my Colleagues) are but
declarations of the fundamental laws of this Kingdom I shall prove by
manifest and legal reasons which are the grounds and mothers of all laws,

The first general reason.
1. The first general reason is drawn are ipsa, from imprisonment, ex
visceribus causae, be it those or other imprisonments, which is divided into
three parts.

1. First, no man can be imprisoned at the will and pleasure of any but he that
is bond, and a villain, for that imprisonment at will is tails luy haut, and
base, are propria quarto modo to villains.

2. But if Freemen of England might be imprisoned at the will and pleasure of
the King by his commandment, then were they in worse case then bondmen and
villains for the lord of a villain cannot command another to imprison his
villain without cause, as of disobedience, or refusing to serve, as it is
agreed in our Books.

3. Imprisonment is accounted in law a civil death, perdit domum, familiam,
vicinos, patriam, his house, is family, his wife, his children his neighbors,
his Country, and to live among wretched wicked men.

39 H. 6. fo. 50. and 41. Ed. 3. 9.
If a man be threatened to be killed, he may avoid a feoffment of lands, gift of
goods, etc. So it is, if he be threatened to be imprisoned, he shall do the
like, for that is a civil death.

The second general reason.
Bracton 105. fo. 15.
The second general reason is a Minore ad majus; paena corporalis est majus
qualibet pecuniaria, but the King himself cannot impose a fine upon any man,
but it must be done juditially by his Judges, per Iusticiar' in Cur' non per
Regem in Camera, 2. R. 3. 11.
and so it has been resolved by all the Judges of England.

The third general reason.
The third general reason is drawn from the number and diversity of remedies,
which the law gives against imprisonment, vizt. brevia de Homine replegiande
de odio and Atia de habeas corpus and bre. de manucaptiene.

The two former of these are antiquated, but the writ de odio and Atia is
revived, for that was given by the Sat. of Magna Car' cap. 26. and therefore
though it were repealed by the Stat. of 28. Ed. 3 ca 9. yet it is revived by
the Stat. of 43. Ed. 3. cap. 1. by which it is provided, that all Statutes made
against Magna Charta are void, now the law would never have given so many
remedies, if the Freemen of England might have been imprisoned at Free will
and pleasure.

The fourth general reason.
The fourth general reason is drawn from the extent and universality of the
pretended power to imprison, for it should not extend only to the Commons of
the Realm and their posterity but to the Nobility and their Honorable
Progenies, to the Bishops and Clergy of the Realm and their Successors; to
all persons of what condition, or sex, or age so ever: to all Judges, Officers,
etc. whose attendance are necessary without exception of any person.

The fifth general reason.
The fifth general reason is drawn from the indefinitenesse of time, the
pretended power being limited to no time, it may be perpetual during life.

The sixth general reason.
The sixth general reason is drawn a dedecore from the loss and dishonor of
the English nation, in two respects. 1. For their valor and power so famous
through the whole world. 2. For their industry; for who will endeavor to
employ himself in any profession, either of War, liberal Science, or
Merchandise, if he be but tennant at will of his liberty, and no tennant at
will, will support or improve any thing, because he has no certain estate;
and thus it should be both dedecus and damnum to the English nation, and it
should be no honor to the King to be King of a slaves.

The seventh general reason.
The seventh general reason is drawn ab utili et inutili, for that appears
by the Stat. of 36 Ed. 3. that the execution of the Statute of Magna Charta 5.
Ed. 3. 25. Ed. 3. and 28. Ed. 3: are adjudged in Parliament to be for the
common profit of the King, and of his people, and therefore the pretended power
being against the profit of the King, and of his people, can be no part of his
prerogative.

The eighth general reason.
The eighth general reason is drawn a tuto, for it is safe for the King to
express the Cause of the Commitment, and dangerous for him to omit it, for if
any be committed without expressing of the Cause, though he escape, albeit the
truth be, it were for treason or felony, yet the escape is neither felony nor
treason; but if the cause be expressed to be for suspicion of treason or
felony, then if he escape, albeit he be innocent, it is treaon or felony.

The last general reason.
The last general reason is drawn from authorities.

Upon conference with the Lords, these objections were made by the Kings
Attorney.
The first objection.
1 That the resolutions of the House of Commons were incompatible with a
Monarch that must govern by rule of State.

Rns.
Whereunto it was answered, Quod nihil tam propr' est imperii quam legibus
vivere. And again, Attribuat Rex legi quod lex attribuat ei vizt. dominationem
and imperium quia sine lege non potest esse Rex. It can be no prejudice to the
King by reason of matter of State: for if it be for suspicion of treason,
misprision of treason, or felony, it may be by general words expressed, vizt.
pro suspitione proditionis, etc. If it be for any contempt, or any other thing,
the particular cause must be showed.

The second objection.
2 To blind those that are committed, one cause must be pretended, and another
intended, especially when it touches matter of State.

Rns.
Whereunto it was answered, that all dissimulation, especially in a cause of
Justice, was to be avoided, and soundness of truth to take place. And
therefore David that was both a King and a Prophet, prayed unto Almighty God
against dissimulation, in these words, Lord send me a sound heart in thy
Statutes, that I be not ashamed: where found in the original signifies
upright without dissimulation, and shame follows dissimulation when the truth
is known.

The third objection.
3 If a Rebel be attainted in Ireland, and his children for safety, and matter
of State be kept in the Tower, what shall be returned upon the habeat corpus?

Rns.
Whereunto it was answered, that their imprisonment might be justified, if they
could not find good sureties for their good behavior. 2. It was charity to
find them meat, drink, and cloth, that by the Attainder of their Father had
nothing.

The fourth objection.
4 Though his Majesty expresses no cause, yet it must be intended there was a
just cause.

Rns.

The fifth objection.
25. Ed. 3. cap. 13 Stat. 4. H. 7. 6.
5 The King in stead of gold or silver, may make money current of any base
metal. 2. He may make wars at his pleasure. 3. He may pardon whom he will.
4. He may make Denizens as many as he will, and these were said to be greater
prerogatives then these in question.

Rns.
Answer to the first. It was denied that the King might make money Current of
base money, but it ought to be of gold or silver. 2. It was answered admitting
that the King might do it, his loss and charge was more then of his Subjects,
both in the Case of money, and in the Case of war; the pardon was private,
out of grace, and no man had danger or loss by it; and so the making of
Denizens the King was only the looser, vizt. where he had double Customs to
have single. 3. It was a non sequitur, the King may do these things, ergo he
may imprison at will.

FINIS.
The substance of the objections made by M. Attorney General, before a
Committee of both Houses, to the Argument that was made by the House of
Commons, at the first conference with the Lords, out of Presidents of Record,
and resolutions of the ludges in former times, touching the liberty of the
person of every Freeman, and the answers and replies then presently made by the
House of Commons to those objections.
M. Attorneyes objections.
AFter the first conference which was desired by the Lords, and had by a
Committee of both Houses in the painted Chamber, touching the reasons, laws,
acts of Parliament, and Presidents concerning the liberty of the person of
every Freeman, M. Attorney General being heard before a Committee of both
Houses, as it was assented by the House of Commons that he might be, before
they went up to the conference, after some preamble made, wherein he declared
the answering of all reasons of Law, and Acts of Parliament, came only to the
Presidents used in the Arguments before delivered, and so endeavored to weaken
the strength of them that had bin brought on the behalf of the Subject, to
show that some were directly contrary to the Law comprehended in the
resolutions of the House of Commons touching the bayling of prisoners returned
upon the Writ of Habeas Corpus to be committed by the special command of the
King, or of the Counsel, without any cause showed for which they ought by Law
to be committed. And the course that was taken (which it pleased the Committee
of both Houses to allow of) was that M. Attorney should make his objections to
every particular President, and that the Gent. appointed and trusted by the
House of Commons by several replies should satisfy the Lords touching the
several objections made by him against or upon every particular, as the order
of the Presidents should lead them. He began with the first 12 Presidents that
were used by the House of Commons, at the conference desired by them, to prove
that prisoners returned to stand so committed were delivered by bail by the
Court of Kings Bench.

Objection al Bildestons Case cite devant. fo. 35. and 55.
The first was, that of Bildestons Case in 18 Ed. 3. Rot. 33. To this he
objected, 1. That in thereturne of him into the Court it did not appear that
this Bildeston was committed by the Kings Command. And secondly, that in the
Record it did appear also that he had been committed for suspicion of
counterfetting of the great Seal, and so by consequence was bayleable in the
Law, in regard there appeared a cause why he was committed, in which case it
was granted by him (as indeed it is plain and agreed of all hands) that the
prisoner is bayleable, though committed by the Command of the King. And he said
that this part of Record by which it appeared he had been committed for this
suspicion of treason was not observed to the Lords in their Argument before
used. And he showed also to the Lords, that there were three several kinds of
Records, by which the full truth of every award or bayling upon a habeat corpus
is known. First, by the remembrance roll wherein the award is given. Secondly,
the file of the Writ, and the return. Thirdly, The Scruet Roll or Scruet
Finn', wherein the Bail is entered, and that only the remembrance roll of this
case was to be found, and that if the other two of it were extant, he doubted
not but that it would appear also, that upon the return it self the cause of
the commitment had been expressed, and so he concluded that this proved not
for the resolution of the House of Commons touching the matter of Bail, where
a prisoner was committed by the Kings command without cause showed.

Rns al dit obj.
To these objections the reply was first, that it was plain, that Bildeston
was committed by the Kings express command, for so are the very words of the
Writ to the Constable of the Tower, quod cum teneri and custodiri facias, etc.
then which nothing can more fully express a commitment by the Kings command.
Secondly, how ever it be true, that in the latter part of the Record it do
appear, that Bildeston had been committed for a suspicion of treason, Yet if
the time of the proceeding expressed in the Record were observed, it would be
plain, that the objection was of no force: for this one ground both of this
one case, and all the rest, is infallible, and never to be doubted of in the
Law, Regula.
That the Justices of every Court adjudge of the force and strength of a
return out of the body of it self only, and according as therein appears to
them. Now in Easter Term 18 Ed. 3. he was returned and brought before them
only as committed by the Writ, wherein No cause is expressed, and the
Lieutenant of the Constable of the Tower that brought him into the Court, said,
that he had no other warrant to detain him nisi bre. predict. wherein there
was no mention of any Cause, And the Court thereupon adjudged, that bre.
predict. or that special command was not sufficient cause to detain him in
prison, and thereupon he is by judgment of the Court in Easter Term let to
mainprise, but that part of the Record, wherein it appears, that he had indeed
been committed for suspicion of treason, is of Trinity Term following, when
the King, after letting him to mainprise, because no man, prosecuted him. And
at that time it appears, but not before, he had been in for suspicion of
treason, so that he was returned to be committed by the Kings special command
only, without any cause showed in Easter Term, and then by judgment of the
Court let to mainprise, which to this purpose is but the same with bail,
though otherwise it differ. And in the Term following, upon another occasion,
the Court knew that he was committed for suspicion of treason, which has no
relation at all to the letting him to mainprise, nor to the judgment of the
Court then given, when they did not, nor could not possibly know any cause for
which the King had committed him, and it was said in the behalf of the House
of Commons, that they had not indeed in their Argument expressly used the
latter part of the Record of Bildestons Case, because it being only of Trinity
term following, it could not concern the reasons of an award given by the
court in Easter term next before, yet notwithstanding that they had most
faithfully at the time of their Argument delivered unto the Lords (as indeed
they had) a perfect Copy at large of the whole record of this Case, as they
had also done of all other Presidents whatsoever cited by them, insomuch as
intruth there was not one president of Record of either side, the Copy whereof
they had not delivered in likewise, nor did Master Attorney mention any one
besides those that were so delivered in by them. And as touching the three
kinds of Records, the remembrance Roll, the return and the file of the Writ,
and the Scruet, it was answered by the Gent. employed by the house of Commons,
that it was true the Scruet and return of this case of Bildestons was not to
be found, but that did not lessen the weight of the president, because always
in the award or Judgment drawn up in the remembrance Roll, the cause
whatsoever it be, when any, is showed, appears clearly by the constant
Entrees of the Court of Kings Bench; So as if any cause had appeared unto the
Court it must have appeared plainly in that part of the Roll which belongs to
Easter term wherein the Judgment was given, but the return of the commitment
by the Kings command without cause showed, and the Judgment of the Court, that
the prisoner was to be let to mainprise appear therein only. And so,
notwithstanding any objection made by Master Attorney, the Cause was maintained
to be clear proof among many others touching that resolution of the House of
Commons.

Objections Horse de Parkers case 22. H 8 cite ante, fo 35 et. 55.
To the second of those 12. which is Parkers Case in 22. H. 8 rot. 37. his
Objections were two, first, that this is true that he was returned that he was
committed per mandatum Dom. Regis, but that it appeared that this command was
certified to the Sherifes of London by one Robert Pecke, and that in regard the
command came no otherwise, the return was held insufficient, and therefore he
was bayled. Secondly, that it appears also in the record, that he was
committed pro suspitione feloniae ac per mandatum Dom Regis; So that in regard
the expression of the cause of his commitment suspicion of felony precedes the
command of the King, therefore it must be intended, that the Court took the
cause why the King committed him to be of less moment then felony, and
therefore bayled him; For he objected that even the house of Commons themselves
in some Arguments used by them touching the interpretation of the Statute of
Westminst. 1. cap. 15. about this point had affirmed, that in enumeration of
particulars those of greatest nature were first mentioned, and that it was
supposed that such as followed were of less nature or moment.

Rns al dit objection.
But the reply was to the first objection, that the addition of certifying of
the Kings command by Robert Pecke altered not the case, first, because the
Sherifes in their returns took notice of the command, as what they were
assured of, and then however it came to them, it was of equal force as if it
had been mentioned without reference to Pecke. Secondly, that as diverse
Pattents pass the great Seal by Writ of privy Seal, and are subscribed per
bre. de privato Sigillo, so diverse per ipsum Regem and are so subscribed, and
oftentimes in the Rolls of former times to the words per ipsum Regem are added
Nuntians A. B. So that the Kings Command general, and the Kings command
related and certified by such a man, is to this purpose of like nature.
Thirdly, in the late great Case of Habeas Corpus, where the return of the
commitment was per speciale mandatum Dom. Regis mihi significat. per Dominos de
privato consilio, and the Court of the Kings Bench did agree that it was the
same, and of the like force, as if mihi significat. etc. had not followed, and
that these words were void, according whereunto here also per mandat. Dom.
Regis nunciat. per Robertu^ Pecke had bin wholly omitted and void likewise; in
truth in that late Case this case of Parker was cited both at the Bar, and at
the Bench, and at the Bench it was interpreted by the Judges no otherwise then
if it had been only per mandatum Dom. Regis in this place of it. But the
objection there was made of another kind, as was delivered in the first
Argument made out of Presidents in behalf of the house of Commons. Then for
the second objection touching the course of enumeration of the causes in the
return, it was said, that however in some acts of Parliament, and elsewhere
in the solemn expression used in the Law, things of greater nature precede,
and the less follow, Yet in this case the contrary was most plain, for in the
return there appears, that there were three causes of deteyning the prisoner,
surety of the peace, suspicion of felony, and the Kings command, and surety
of the peace is first mentioned, which is plainly less then felony, therefore
it is as plain, that (if any force of Argument be here to be taken from this
enumeration) the contrary to that which Master Attorney inferred is to be
concluded, that is, that as felony is a greater cause then Surety of the
Peace, so the matter whereupon the Kings command was grounded, was greater then
the felony. But in truth this kind of Argument holds neither way here. And
whatsoever the cause were why the King committed him, it was impossible for the
Court to know it, And might also have been of very high moment in matter of
State, and yet of far less nature then felony, all which shows that this
President has its full force also, according as it was first used in Argument
by the house of Commons.

35. H. 8. Bincks case cite ante 36. and 56 objections horse de ceo.
To the third of these, which is Bincks Case in 35. H. 8. Rot. 35. the
Objection was, that there was cause expressed, pro suspitione feloniae, and
though pro alijs causis illos moventibus were added in the return, yet because
in the course of enumeration the general name of alia coming after
particulars includes things of less nature then the particular does, therefore
in the Case suspicion of felony being the first, the other causes generally
mentioned must be intended of less nature for which the prisoner was bay
leable for the greater which was suspicion of felony.

Rns al dit objection.
Hereunto it was replied that the Argument of enumeration on in these cases is
of no moment, and is next before showed, and that although it were of any
moment, yet the aliae causae, though less then felony, might be of very great
consequence in matter of State, which is pretended usually upon general
returns of command without cause showed. And it is most plain that the Court
could not possibly know the reasons why the prisoner here was committed, and
yet they bay led him without looking further after any unknown thing under
that title of matter of State, which might as well have been in this Case, as
in any other whatsoever.

rot. 58. and to the fifth, which is Newports Case, Pas. 4. and 5. P. and Mar.
rot. 45. only these observations were said over again by Master Attorney,
which were moved in the Argument made out of the Presidents in the behalf of
the house of Commons at the first conference, and in the same Argument were
fully and clearly satisfied, as they were now again in like manner.

9. El. Lawrences case, et eodem Anno Constables case cite devant fo. 38. et 56.
To the sixth, which is Lawrences Case, in 9. El. rot. 35. and to the seventh,
which is Constables Case, Pas. 9. El. Rot. 68. the same objections were
likewise said over again by Master Attorney that are moved and clearly and
fully answered in the Argument made at the last Conference out of Presidents in
the behalf of the house of Commons. The force of the Objection being only that
it appeared in the margin of the Roll, that the word Pardon was written, but it
is plain that the word there has no reference at all to the reason why they
are bayled, nor could have reference to the cause, why they were committed, is
utterly unknown, and was not showed.

20. El. Brownings case cite devant fo. 38. et 56.
To the eighth, which is Brownings Case, in Pas. 20. El. Rot. 72. it was said
by Master Attomey, that he was bayled by a Letter from the Lords of the
Counsel directed to the Judges of the Court, but being asked for that Letter,
or any testimony of it, he could produce none at all, but said he thought the
testimony of it was burnt amongst many other things of the Counsel table at
the burning of the Banqueting house.

40. El. Harecourts case cite devant, fo 39.
To the ninth, being Harecourts Case. Pas. 40. El' Rot. 620. the selfsame
objection was made by him, but no warrant was showed to maintain his objection.

43. El. cite devant, fo. 39. Catesbies case. Object. a ceo.
To the tenth, which is Catesbies Case in vacatione Hill. 43. El. he said that
it was by direction of a Privy Seal from the Queen, and to that purpose he
showed the Privy Seal of 43. El. which is at Charge among the transcript of
the Records concerning bayles taken in Cases when the King or the Lords of the
Counsel assented.

Rns a ceo.
But it was replied, that the Privy Scale was made only for some particular
Gentleman mentioned in it and none other, as indeed appears in it. And then he
said, that it was likely that Catesby here had a privy Seal in this behalf,
because those other had so, which was all the force of his objection.

12. Iac. Backwiths case cite devant. fo. 39. and 58. Objection a ceo.
To the 11 which is Beckwiths Case, in Hill. 12. Iac. Rot. 183. He said the
Lords of the Counsel sent a letter to the Court of Kings Bench to bail him,
and indeed he produced a letter, which could not by any means be found when
the Arguments were made at the first conference. And this Letter, and a Copy
of an obscure report made by a young Student, that was brought to another
purpose (as is hereafter showed) were the only things written of any kind
that M. Attorney produced, besides the particular showed by the House of
Commons at the first conference.

Rns al objections.
To this it was replied, that the letter was of no moment, being only a
direction to the chief Justice, and no matter of record, nor any way
concernign the rest of the Judges. And besides, the prisoner was bayleable by
the Law, or not bayleable; if bayleable by the Law, then was he to be bayled
without any such Letter; if not bayleable by the Law, then plainly the Judges
could not have bayled him upon the Letter without breach of their oaths, which
is, that they are to do Justice according to the Law, without having respect
to any command whatsoever; so that the Letter in this Case, or the like in any
other case, is for point of Law to no purpose, nor has any weight at all by
way of objection, against what the record and judgment of the Court shows us.

14 Ia. Sir Tho. Mounsons case devant. fo. 40. and 58.
The twelfth and last of these which is Sir Tho. Mounsons Case, in 14. Jac.
Rot. 147. the same objection only was said over by him, which was moved and
clearly answered in the Argument at the first conference, and that one ground
which is infallible, that the judgment upon a return is to be made only out
of what appears in the body of the return it self, was again insisted upon
in this case, as it was also in most of the rest. And indeed that alone (which
is more clear Law) fully satisfies almost all kind of objections that have
been made to any of these Presidents, which thus righty understood, are many
ample testimonies of the judgment of the Court of Kings Bench touching this
great point, in the several ages and reigns of the several Princes under
which they fall.

After his objections to these twelve, and the replies and satisfaction given
to these objections, he came next to those wherein the assent of the King or
privy Counsel appears to have been upon the enlargement, but he made not
to any of these any other kind of objection whatsoever, then such as are moved
and clearly answered (as they were now again) in the Argument made at the
first conference. And for as much as it concerns Letters of Assent or
direction, the same was here said again by way of reply to him, as is before
said touching the Letter in Beckworths Case, hoc supra.

After these were disputed, he came to urge the eight Presidents which seemed
to make for the other side, against the resolution of the house of Commons,
which eight were used, and copies of them also given unto the Lords at the
first conference.

Of these eight, the first four were urged by him, as being of one kind, the
difference of them being only said the same, only in the names of prisons,
and of persons, they were but the self same.

Vide touts ceux cite devant fo. 43 44. and 62. 63 objections horse de eux.
The force of these four being objected thus, that Richard Everard for the
purpose in the first of them, which is 5. H. 7. Rot. 18. Roger Cherry in the
second of them, which is 8. H. 7. Rot. 12. Christopher Burton in the third,
which is 9 H. 7. Rot. 14. and George Vrmsewick in the fourth of them, which is
19 ^. 7. Rot. 13. were returned into the Kings Bench by several Writs of
Habeas corpus, to have been committed, and detained in the prisons whence they
came, per mandatum Dom. Regis, and that upon the return they were committed to
the Marshalsea of the Kings Bench, and that howsoever it had been objected
against those Presidents, that this kind of commitment was by the course of
that Court always done before the Bayling of the prisoner, yet that it did not
appear that they were bayled.

Rns al objections horse des dits presidents.
The reply to these objections was, that the constant course of the Court of
Kings Bench was, whosoever came in upon a hab. corp. or otherwise upon any Writ
into that Court, cannot be bayled, until he be first committed to the Mar. of
that Court, and that thence it was that all those 4 were committed to the
Marshal, as appears by the entry, Marr'. etc. which is the usual entry in such
a case, and that the Clerks of that Court acknowledge this course and entry to
be most constantiso that all the inference that can be made out of these 4 is,
but that 4 prisoners being brought from four several prisons by hab. corp.
into the Kings Bench, and returned to stand committed per mandatum Dom. Regis,
were so far from being to be remanded by the Law, that in all these four
cases, they were first taken from their several prisons wherein they had been
detained by such a general command, which could not have been, if they had
not been adjudged in every of the Cases to have been bayleable by the Court,
and that this Commitment of them to the Marshall of the Kings Bench was the
first step toward the bayling of them, as in all other cases; but that it
appears not, that either they ever demanded to be bayled, or that they were
able to find sufficient Bail. And if they did not the one, or could not do
the other, it may follow indeed that they were not bayled; but the commitment
to the Kings Bench being the first step to bayling, and by constant course it
is, showed most plainly, that they were bayleable by the Law, which is the
only thing in question: so that although the four Presidents were ranked
among them that may seem to make against the resolution of the House of
Commons, which was done, both because they have this small color in them for
the other side, to any man that is not acquainted with the nature and reasons
of the Entries and courses of the Court of Kings Bench, and also because all or
some of them had been used in the late great case in the Kings Bench, as
Presidents that made against this liberty claimed by the Subject, yet in truth
all sour of them do fully prove their resolution, that is, they plainly show
that the Court of Kings Bench in every of them resolved, that the prisoners so
committed were bayleable, otherwise they had been remanded, and not committed
to the Marshall of the Kings Bench. And this was the answer to the objection
made by M. Attorney upon these four Presidents, being all of them in the time
of H. 7.

7 H. 8. Pages cas^ cite devant. fo. 43. and 63.
To the fifth of these being Ed Pages Case in 7. H. 8. Rot. 23. M. Attorney
objected thus, he said, that Edward Page was committed to the Marshalsea of the
Household per mandatum Dom. Regis ibid. salvo custodiend. etc. Qui committitur
Mar. Hospitii Dom. Regis, etc. by which it appears as he said, that the Court
remanded him to the prison of the Marshalsea of the household, and he said,
whereas it had been objected at the first conference, that here was some
mistaking in the Entry, he said he conceived indeed there was a mistaking, but
the mistaking was, that the Clerk had entered committitur for remittitur, and
that it should have been Qui remittitur Hospitii Dom. Regis, for when ever
they remand a prisoner remittitur and not committitur should be entered, and
that mistaking being so rectified and understood, he conceived it was a direct
President against the resolution of the House of Commons.

Rns al dit objection.
To this it was answered by the Gent. of the House of Commons, that there was
no doubt indeed but that a mistaking was by the entry of the Clerk, but that
the mistaking was quite of another nature. The addition of these words Hospitii
Dom. Regis was the mistaking, and the entry should have bin qui committitur
Mar. etc. only, that is, that he is committed to the Marshall of the Kings
Bench, and so indeed the force of the President should be just the same with
the first four, but the ignorance of the Clerk that entered it, knowing not how
to distinguish between the Marshall of the Household, and the Marshall of the
Kings Bench, was the cause of the Addition of these words, and to confirm
fully this kind of interpretation of that President, and of the mistaking in
it, 'twas observed by the Gent. of the House of Commons, that there is in the
Margin of the Roll an infallible Character that justifies so much, for by the
course of that Court whenever a prisoner is committed to the Marshal of the
Kings Bench, and not remanded, the word Marr'. etc. is written in the Margin
short, by Marr' etc. turned up, and that is never written, but when the meaning
and sense of the Entry is, that the prisoner is committed to the prison of the
same Court, now in this Case in the Margin Marr'. is likewise written, which
most plainly shows the truth of the Case was, that this Page was committed to
the Marshall of the Kings Bench, and not remanded, which if he had been,
neither could the Entry have been committitur, nor should the Margin of the
Roll have had Marr' written in it. And thus they answered Master Attorneys
Objection touching this President, and concluded that now besides the first
four of the eight, they had another, and so five, more to prove that a
prisoner committed per mandatum Dom. Regis generally was bayled by the
Judgment of the Court. However it appears not in these particulars that they
were bayled, which perhaps they were not, either because they prayed it not, or
because they could not find sufficient Bail.

8. Iac. Caesar's case cite devant fo. 46. and 64. Objections horse de ceo.
To the sixth of these eight Presidents, being the Case of Tho. Caesar in 8.
Iac. Rot. 99. Master Attorney objected it thus, That Caesar being committed per
mandatum Dom. Regis to the Marshalsea of the Household was returned upon Habeas
Corpus to be so committed, and therefore deteyned in Prison, and that the
entry is qui remittitur prisonae pred. by which it appears clearly, that he
was remanded to the same prison from whence he came.

Rns al dits objections.
To which the Gentlemen of the house of Commons gave this answer, they said
that the usual entry of a remittitur, when it is to show that the Court by
way of Judgment or award upon a resolution or debate remand the prisoner, is
quousque secundum legem deliberatus fuerit, but when they advise, or give day
to the Keeper of the prison to amend his return, or the like, then the entry
is only remittitur generally, or remittitur prisonae pred. But it was indeed
affirmed by Master Keeling, a Clerk of experience in that Court, that the
entry of Remittitur generally, or Remittitur prisonae pred. was indifferently
used for the same that Remittitur quousque etc. yet it was expressly showed by
the Gent. of the house of Commons that there was sometimes a difference, and
that so it might, well be in this case, for in the last of these eight
presidents, which is Saltonstals Case, they observed that Remittitur prisonae
pred. is often used, only for a remanding during the time that the Court gave
leave for the Warden of the Fleet to amend the return, which shows plainly,
though sometimes Remittitur generally, and Remittitur quousque may mean but
the same, yet sometimes also it does not mean the same. And that in this Case
of Caesar it meant only but so much as it does twice in that of Saltonstalls
Case, which was proved also by a rule of the Court, which was cited out of the
Rule Book of the Court of Kings Bench, by which rule the Court expressly
ordered, that unless the Steward and Marshall of the household did
sufficiently return the Writ of Habeas Corpus for Caesar, that he should be
discharged, the words of the Rule are Nisi pred. Seneschall' and Marr' Hospitii
Dom. Regis sufficienter returnabit bre. de Habeas Corpus Thomae Caesar die
Mercur. prox' post festum Sanct. Martin. defendens exonerabitur. And this was
the opinion of the Court, which shows that the Court was so far from
remaunding him upon the re^urne, that they resolved, that unless some better
return was made, the prisoner should be discharged of his first imprisonment,
though it appear to them out of the body of the return upon which they are to
judge, that he was committed per mandatum Dom. Regis only. And the Rule not
only shows the opinion of the Court then to be agreeable with the resolution
of the house of Commons, but also proves that Remittitur generally, and
Remittitur prisonae predict. does not always implie a remanding upon Judgment
or debate. And this answer was given to this of Caesar's Case, and that is the
sixth of this number.

12. Iac. Demestrius and others case cite devant, fo. 46. and 64. Objections
horse de ceo.
The seventh, is the Case of James Demestrius, it was 12. Iac. Rot. 153. Master
Attorney objected, that this Demestrius and diverse others being Brewers, were
committed per Consilium Dom. Regis to the Marshalsea of the household, and that
upon the commitment being so generally returned they were remanded, and that
the entry was immediate remittitur praefat. Marr' hospitij praed. where
observes that immediate shows that the Judges of that time were so resolved of
this question, that they remaunded them presently, as men that well knew what
the Law was herein.

Rns al dit objections.
Hereunto the Gent. of the House of Commons gave this answer; First, that the
remittitur in this Case is but as the other in Caesar's, and so proves nothing
against them. Secondly, that immediate being added to it shows plainly, that
it was done without debate, or any Argument or consideration had of it, which
makes the Authority of the President to be of no force in point of Law. For
Judgments and awards given upon deliberation and debate only are proofs and
Arguments of weight, and not any sudden act of the Court without debate or
deliberation. And the entry of immediate being proposed to Master Keeling, it
was confirmed by him, that by the Entry it appeared by their course, that the
remaunding of him was the selfsame day he was brought, which as it was said
by the Gent. of the house of Commons might be upon the rising of the Court, or
upon advisement, or the like; and this answer was given to this President of
the Brewers.

12. Iac. Saltonstalls case cite devant, fo. 49. and 65 Objections horse de ceo.
To the last of these eight which Master Attorney objected is Saltonstalls Case
12. Jac. he was committed per mandatum a Dom. de privato Consilio, and being
returned by the Warden of the Fleet to be so, Remittitur prisonae pred. and in
13. Iac. in the same Case there is remittitur generally in the Roll, and these
two make but one Case, and are one President.

Rns al dits objections.
To this the Gent. of the house of Commons answered, that it is true the Rolls
have such entries of remittitur in them generally, But that proves nothing upon
the reason before used by them in Caesar's Case. But also Saltonstall was
committed for another cause, besides per mandatum Dom. Regis, for a contempt
against an Order in the Chancery, and that was in the return also. And besides
the Court, as it appears in the Record, gave several days to the Warden of
the Fleet to amend his return, which they would not have done, if they had
conceived it sufficient, for that which is sufficient needs not amendment.

To this Master Attorney replied, that they gave him day to amend his return,
in respect of that part of it which concerns the Order in Chancery, and not in
respect of that which was per mandatum Dom. Regis. But the Gent. of the House
of Commons answered, that that appeared not any where, nor indeed is it likely
at all, nor can be reasonably so understood, because if the other return per
mandatum Dom. Regis had been sufficient by it self, then doubtless they
would have remanded him upon that alone, for then they needed not at all to
have stood upon the other part of the return in this Case. So that out of the
Record it self it appears fully, that the Court conceived the return to be
insufficient. So the Gent. of the house of Commons concluded, that they had a
great number of Presidents, besides diverse Acts of Parliament, and reasons of
Common law, agreeable to their resolution, and that there was not one President
at all that made against them, but indeed, that almost all that were brought as
well against them as for them, if rightly understood, made fully for the
maintenance of their conclusion, and that there was not one Example or
President of a Remittitur in any kind upon the point before that of Caesar's
Case, which is before cleared with the rest, and is but of late time, and of no
moment against the resolution of the House of Commons.

And thus, for so much as concerned the presidents of Record, the first day of
the Conference desired by the Lords ended.

The next day they desired another Conference with the House of Commons, at
which it pleased the Committee of both Houses to hear Master Attorney again
make what Objections he could against other parts of the Argument formerly
delivered from the House of Commons, he objected against the Acts of
Parliament, and against the reasons of the Law, and his objections to those
parts were answered, as it appears by the Answers by order given into the
House of Commons by the Gent. that made them. He objected also upon the second
day against the second kind of Presidents, which are resolutions of Judges in
former times, and not of Record, and brought also some other testimonies of the
opinions of Judges in former times touching this point.

Resolution de touts les Judges, 34. El. Objections horse de ceo per l' Attorney.
First, for that Resolution of all the Judges of England in 34. El. mentioned
and read in the Arguments read at the first Conference, he said, That it was
directly against the resolution of the House of Commons, and observed the words
of it in one place to be, that persons so committed by the King, or by the
Counsel, may not be delivered by any of the Courts etc. And in another, that
if the cause were expressed, either in general or in specialtie, it was
sufficient, and he said that the expressing of a Cause in generaltie, was to
show the King and the Counsels command, and to this purpose he read the whole
words of that resolution of the Judges. Then he objected also, that in a report
of one Roswels Case in the Kings Bench in 13 Jac. he found that the opinion of
the Judges of that Court (Sir Edward Cook being then chief Justice and one of
them) was that a prisoner being committed per mandatum Dom. Regis, or privati
Consilii, without cause showed, and so returned, could not be bayled, because
it might be matter of State, or Arc anum nuperii, for which he stood committed.
And this also he added, an opinion he found in a Journall in the House of
Commons of 18. Iac. wherein Sir Edward Cook speaking to a bill preferred for
the explanation of Magna Charta touching imprisonment, said in the same House,
that one so committed could not be enlarged by the Law, because it might be
matter of State for which he was committed, and amongst these objections, as
his objections of the other nature, also he spoke of the confidence that was
showed in the behalf of the House of Commons: and he said, it was not
confidence on either part could add any thing to the determination of the
question; but if he would, that he had as much reason of Confidence for the
other side against the resolution of the House of Commons, grounding himself
upon the force of his objections, which as he conceived had so weakened the
Arguments of the House of Commons.

Rns al dits objections.
To this a reply was made, and first it was said to the Lords on the behalf of
the House of Commons, that notwithstanding any thing yet objected, they were
upon clear reason still confident of the truth of their first resolution,
grounded upon so just examination, and deliberation taken by them. And it was
observed to the Lords also, that their confidence herein was of another nature,
and of greater weight, then any confidence that could be expressed by M.
Attorney, or whomsoever else being of his Majesty's Counsel learned.

To which purpose the Lords were desired to take into their present memories
the difference between the present qualities of the Gent. that spoke in the
behalf of the House of Commons, and of the Kings learned Counsel in their
speaking there howsoever accidently they were both men of the same profession:
For the Kings Counsel spoke as Counsel perpetually retained by Fee, and if
they made glosses or advantageous interpretations whatsoever for their own
part, they did but what belonged unto them; but the Gent. that spoke in behalf
of the House of Commons, came there, bound on the one side by the trust reposed
in them by their Country that sent them, and on the other side by an oath taken
by every of them before he sit in the House, to maintain and defend the
rights and prerogatives of the Crown, for even in the point of Confidence alone
those of them that speak as retained Counsel by perpetual Fee, and those
that by their place being admitted to speak, are bound to utter nothing but
truth, both by such a trust and such an oath, were no way to be so compared or
counterpoised, as if the one were of no more weight then the other.

Resolution de 34. El. explain and expound.
For that of the resolution of all the Judges in England in 34. El. It was
showed that plainly it agreed with the resolution of the House of Commons, for
although indeed it might have been expressed with more perspicuity, yet the
words of it as they are, sufficiently show that to them. To that purpose,
besides the words of the whole frame of this resolution of the Judges, as it is
in the Copy transcribed out of the Lord chief Justice Andersons Book, written
with his own hand, which book was here offered to be showed in the behalf of
the House of Commons, it was observed, that the words of the first part of it
show plainly, that all the Judges of England then resolved, that the prisoners
spoken of in that first part of their resolution, were only prisoners
committed with cause showed; for they only say they might not be del^vered by
any of the Courts without due trial, by law and judgment of the acquittall
they must be delivered; but it is clear that no trial or acquittall can be
had, where there is not some cause laid to their charge, for which they ought
to stand committed. Therefore in that part of the resolution such prisoners are
only meant as are committed with cause showed, as which also the Judges
expressly in that resolution expressly thought necessary, as appears in the
second part of their resolution, wherein they have these words, If upon the
return of their Habeas Corpus, the cause of their commitment be certified to
the Judges, as it ought to be, etc. By which words they show plainly, that
every return of a commitment is insufficient, that has not a cause showed of
it. And to that which M. Attorney said, as if the Cause were sufficiently
expressed in generality, if the Kings command or the Counsels were expressed in
it, as if that were meant in the resolution for a sufficient general cause, It
was answered, that it was never heard of in Law, that the power or person that
committed the prisoner was understood, for the causa captionis or causa
detentionis, but only the reason why that power or person committed the
prisoner, as also in common speech if any man ask why or for what cause a man
stands committed, the answer is not, that such a one committed him, but his
offense or some other cause is understood in the question, and is to be showed
in the Answer, but to say that such a one committed the prisoner, is an answer
only to the question, who committed him? and not why or for what canse he
stands so committed.

That for that of the Copy of the report in 13 Iac. showed forth by M.
Attorney, it was answered by the Gent. of the House of Commons, that the report
it self which had been before seen, and perused among many other things at a
Committee made by the House, was of slight or no authority, for that it was
taken by one who was at that time a young Student, and as a reporter in the
Kings Bench, and there was not any other report to be found to agree with it.
Secondly, although the reports of young Students, when they take the words of
Judges as they fall from their mouths at the Bench, and in the same person and
form as they have spoken, may be of good credit, yet in this Case there was
not one word so reported, but in truth there being three cases of a time in the
Kings Bench, one Rosewells Case, Allens, and one Saltonstalls case, every of
which had something of like nature in it, the Student having been present in
the Court, made up the frame of one report or case out of all three in his own
words, and so put it into his Book: so that there is not a word in the report,
but it is framed according to the Students fancy, as it is written, and
nothing is expressed in it, as it came from the mouth of the Judges, otherwise
then as his fancy directed him.

Thirdly, there are in the report plain falsehoods of matter of fact, which are
to be attributed either to the Judges, or to the reporter. It is most likely by
all reason that they proceeded from the reporters faults, and howsoever, these
matters of falsehood show sufficiently that the credit of the rest is of light
value. It it said in the report that Harecourt being committed by the Counsel,
was bayled in 40. El. upon a Privy Seal or a Letter, whereas in truth there
is no such thing. And it is said here, that kind of Letters are filed in the
Crown Office, whereas in truth there was any such kind of Letters filed there
in any case whatsoever, that resolution of the Judges in 34. El. is mis-cited
there, and made in 36. El. And it is said there, that by that resolution a
Prisoner returned to be committed by the Command of the King might not at all
be delivered by the Court, whereas no such thing is comprehended in that
resolution.

But that which is of most moment is, that howsoever the truth of the report
were, yet the opinion of the Judges being sudden, and without any debate had of
the Case, is of light moment, for in difficult points especially the most grave
and learned men living may on the sudden let fall (and that without any
disparagement to them) such opinions as they may will, and ought to change upon
further inquiry, examination, and full debate had before them, and mature
deliberation taken by them. Now plainly in that of 13. Jac. there is not so
much as a pretense of any debate at the Bar or Bench. All that is reported to
have been, is reported as spoken of the sudden. And can any man take such a
sudden opinion to be of value against such debates and mature deliberations
since had of the point? And indeed this great point, and all circumstances
belonging to it, has within this half year been so fully examined and
searched into, that it may well be affirmed, that the most learned man
whosoever that has now considered of it, has within that time, or might have
learned more reason of satisfaction in it then ever before he met with.
Therefore the sudden opinion of the Judges to the contrary is of no value here,
which also is to be said by that opinion obliviously delivered in the Commons
house in 18. Iac. as Master Attorney objected out of the Journall of the House.
But besides, neither was the truth of that report of that opinion of the
Journall any way acknowledged, for it was said on the behalf of the house of
Commons, that their Journals were for matters of Orders and resolutions of the
House of such Authority, as that they were as their Records. But for any
particular man's opinion noted in any of them, it was so far from being of any
authority there with them, that in truth no particular opinion is at all to be
entered in them, and that their Clerk offends whenever be does to the
contrary. And to conclude, no such opinion whatsoever can be sufficient to
weaken the clear Law comprehended in these resolutions of the House of Commons
grounded upon so many Acts of Parliament, so much reason of the Common law, and
so many Presidents of Record, and the resolution of all the Judges of England,
and against which not one Law written or unwritten, not one President, not one
reason has been brought that make any thing to the contrary.

And thus to this purpose ended the next day of the Conference desired by the
Lords, and had by a Committee of both Houses.

FINIS.
