The WHIG's Exaltation;
A Pleasant New SONG of 82. To an Old Tune of 41.
^NOw Now the Tories all shall stoop, Religion and the Laws, and Whigs on
Commonwealth ^Get up to Tap the Good Old Cause: Tantivy-Boys shall all go down,
And haughty Monarchy; ^The Leathern Cap shall brave the Throne; Then Hey Boys
up go We.

[2]
When once that Antichristian Crew
Are crushed, and Overthrown,
We Will teach the Nobles how to bow,
And keep their Gentry down;
Good Manners has a bad Repute,
And tends to Pride we see;
We Will therefore cry all Breeding down,
And Hey Boys up go We.
[3]
The Name of Lord shall be Abhorred,
For every Man's a Brother;
What Reason then in Church or State
One Man should Rule another?
Thus having Pill'd and Plundered all,
And Levelled each Degree,
We Will make their plump young Daughters fall,
And Hey Boys up go We.
[4]
What though the KING and Parliament
Cannot accord together,
We have good Cause to be Content,
This is Our Sunshine Weather;
For if good Reason should take place,
And they should both agree,
'Dzowns who'd be in a Roundheads Case,
For Hey then up go We?
[5]
We Will down with all the Versities
Where Learning is Professed;
For they still Practice, and Maintain
The Language of the Beast;
We Will Exercise in every Grove,
And Preach beneath a Tree;
We Will make a Pulpit of a Tub,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
[6]
The Whigs shall Rule Committee Chair,
Who will such Laws Invent,
As shall Exclude the Lawful Heir
By Act of Parliament:
We Will cut His Royal Highness down,
Even shorter by the Knee,
That He shall never reach the Throne,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
[7]
We Will Smite the Idol in Guild Hall,
And Then (as we were wont,)
We Will cry it was a Popish Plot,
And Swear those Rogues have don't;
His Royal Highness to Unthrown
Our Interest will be,
For if He e're Enjoy His own,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
[8]
We Will break the Windows which the Whore
Of Babylon has Painted;
And when their Bishops are pulled down,
Our Elders shall be Sainted:
Thus having quite Enslaved the Throne,
Pretending to set Free,
At last the Gallows claims its own,
Then Hey Boys up go We.
