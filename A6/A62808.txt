To the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of
London in Common Counsel Assembled.
The humble Address of many thousand well-affected, and peaceable minded
Citizens of the said City.
Shows,
THat notwithstanding the repulse formerly given us by your demand of Reasons
for our desires for a Common Hall, which in effect amounted to a denial,
requiring of us that aforehand which should be the only proper subject and
matter of Debate in that free, and general Convention; Yet we cannot so sit
down, but do earnestly press our former desires for your calling a
Common Hall, hoping it may satisfy you at present only to say, That though by
the constitution of this City, we are to own you in Court of Common Council
assembled our Representative, and Trustee for the managery of our ordinary
affairs, yet we do not thereby so exclude our selves but that in time of
extraordinary danger, and miseries approaching, (as this is,) every of us so
far as the Government of Polity of this City will allow, may personally appear
in Council, for the aversion of those evils, which else we are sure to feel
more then representatively. And certainly we have much more reason at this time
to insist upon that our Ancient, indubitate right in this particular, then ever
heretofore, considering how beyond all presidents of former times we were
prelimited, through a force then upon us, in the Election of some Persons still
among you, the sad effects whereof we have ever since found in the disturbance
of your Councels all along. But we shall not desire to look back at all, if we
may yet be satisfied in what is just and necessary for us to obtain, for
prevention of stopage of that blood daily threatened to be spilt over the face
of the whole Kingdom: For which purpose we request,

First, That no self ends of any particularly interessed and engaged Persons
amongst us may be a means to deprive us of that happiness, and honor in
becoming chief Instruments for the settlement of this bleeding and miserable
embroyled Kingdom, which we may now easily attain to, by timely interposing
our Power, and complying with that part of this quarrel which carries justice
and right along with it, there being no safety for us at all by continuing
Newtrals any longer.

Secondly, That without a general consent first obtained in Common Hall, the
Interest and power of this City (which is earnestly sought for by All parties
now in Action) may not be engaged to any Party in a new War, so much as to
permit or countenance any leavies of Horse or Men to be raised or received
amongst us, or near us, (which we may prevent) either upon the public or any
particular score, and if any such have been or are made, we shall expect an
account thereof to the end the heavy imputation likely thereby to fall upon
this City, may be laid at the right door.

Lastly, That a Common Hall be forthwith called; because our expectation of one
upon Midsummerday next according to the Ancient and laudable custom of this
City is likely to be crossed by Ordinance of the Houses absolutely forbidding
the same upon pretense of Tumults they fear may arise thereby: Or if we shall
not be restrained in our meeting then, yet such a force is intended to be held
over us that day by the conjunction of Lieutenant General Cromwels Forces (now
upon their return out of Wales hitherward) with others appointed for that
purpose, that we shall be limited and confined in our Counsels and debates
there to the sense of some few Persons whose determinations backed with force
have hitherto kept us from concurring in that course for the settlement of this
pitifully distracted Kingdom, which we see all others besides our selves now
so busy about, and wherein we hope this City will not come behind any others
if a free and full debate thereof may be granted in Common Hall, not only to
set forward our desires, but to guide our undertakings therein:

To obtain which, as it has often been, so now again it is the most humble
suit of

Your many thousand Petitioners etc.
