LONDON, (...)

His Majesty's Declaration to all His Loving Subjects upon occasion of His late
Messages to both Houses of Parliament, and their refusal to treat with him for
the Peace of the KINGDOM.
IF it had no evidently appeared to all men who h ve carefully examined and
considered our Actions, Messages, and Declarations, how farie We are and have
been from begetting or promoting the present distractions, and that the Arms
we have now taken are for the necess^ry safety and defense of our life, being
not taken up by Us ill our Town and fort of Hull were kept from Us by force of
Arms, our Navy employed against Us to keep all foreign e supply of Arms
and Mon y, when our own here was seized and detained from Us, and an Army
raised in pay, and marching against Us, yet the late reception of our Message
of the Twenty fifth of August sent by persons of Honor and trust, will sure
satisfy the world, that we have omitted nothing on Our part that a Gracious
and Christian Prince could or can do to prevent the effusion of Christian
blood, but that the Malignant party, which have with great subtilty and in
lustry begot this misunderstanding between Us and our good Subjects, resolve to
satisfy and secure their malice and Ambition with the ruin of the kingdom,
and in the blood of Us, and all Our good Subjects.

When they had forced Us, after the neglect of our Message from Beverly, by
raising a great Army and incensing our Subjects against Us, to erect our Royal
Standard, that our Subjects might be informed of our danger, and repair to our
Succor, though we had no great reason to believe any Message of ours would
receive a very good entertainment, if those men might prevail, who had
brought all these miseries upon the Kingdom to satisfy their own private
end: yet observing the miserable Accidents which already befell our good
Subjects by the Soldiers under their command, and well knowing that greater
would ensue, if timely prevention were not applied; and finding that the malice
and cunning of these men had infused into our People a Rumor, that We had
rejected all propositions and offers of Treaty, and desired to engage Our
Subjects in a Civil War, which our soul abhorres, we prevailed with Ourselfe
(for a full expression of Our desire to prevent the effusion of blou^) to send
a gra^cous Message to both Our Houses of Parliament on the 25. of August. In
these words,

WE have with unspeakeable grief of heart long beheld the distractions of this
Our Kingdom, (...) Maje^^^s Gra^^^as Mes^^^e to ^^th hou^^^ of ^ar ^^^ment,
^^^it from ^^^otting^^^. Aug. (...) 42. (...) the ^^^cles of ^^^uthamp (...)
and ^^^^rset, (...) John ^^^alpeper ^^^hancel^^^r of the ^^^chequer ^^^d Sir
William ^^^^dall.
Our very soul is full of anguish until We may find^ some remedy to prevent
the Miseries which are ready to overwhelme this whole Nation by a Civil War:
And though all our endeavors tending to the composing of those unhappy
differences betwixt Us and our two Houses of Parliament (though pursued by Us
with all Zeal and Syncerity) have been hitherto without that success We
hoped for; yet such is our constant and earnest care to preserve the public
Peace, that We shall not be discouraged from using any expedient, which by
the blessing of the God of Mercy may lay a firm foundation of Peace and
happiness to all our good Subjects: To this end observing that many mistakes
have arise^ by the Messages, Petitions and Answers betwixt Us and Our two
Houses of Parliament, which happily may be prevented by some other way of
Treaty, wherein the Matters in difference may be more clearly understood, and
more freely transacted; We have thought fit to propound to you, That some fit
persons may be by you enable I to Treat with the like number to be
authorized by Us, in such manner, and with such freedom of debate, as may best
tend to that happy Conclusion which all good men desire, The peace of the
Kingdom: Wherein as We promise in the word of a King, all safety and
encouragement to such as shall be sent to Us, if you shall choose the place
where We are for the Treaty, which We wholly leave to you, presuming of your
like care of the safety of th se We shall employ if you shall name another
place; So We assure you and all our good Subjects, that (to the best of our
understanding) nothing shall be therein wanting on our parts, which may
advance the true Protestant Religion, oppose Popery and Superstition, s^cure
the Law of the Land (upon which is built as well our just Prerogative, as the
Propriety and Liberty of the Subject) Confirm all just Power and Privileges
of Parliament, and render Us and our people tru^^y happy by a good
nderstanding betwixt Us and our two Houses of Parliament. B^ing with you as
firm Resolutions to do your duty, and let all our good people j^yne with Us
in our prayers to Almighty God for his blessing upon this work.

If this proposit on shall be rejected by you, we have done our duty so amply,
that God will absolve Us from the guilt of any of that blood which must be
spilt, and what opinion soever other men may have of our power, we assure you
nothing but our Christian and pious care to prevent the Eff^sion of blood has
beg t this Motion, our provision of Men, Arms and Money being such as may
secure Us from farther violence, till it shall please God to open the eyes of
our People.

Our Messengers were not suffered to sit in the Houses, and one of them, the
Earl of Southampton (against whom there was not the least color of exception
or so much as a Vot.) not suffered to deliver our Message, but compelled to
send it by the Gentleman V^ber, and then commanded to depart the Town, before
they would prepare any Answer which they shortly sent Us in these words.

May it please Your Majesty,
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, having received your Majesty's
Message of the 25. of August, The Answer of the Lords and Commons to His
Majesti s Message the 25. of August. 1642.
do with much grief resent the dangerous and distracted state of this
Kingdom, which we have by all mean s endeavored to prevent, both by our
several advices and Petitions to your Majesty, which have been not only
without success, but there has followed that, which no ill counsel in former
times has produced, or any age has seen, namly, those several Proclamations
and Declarations against both the Houses of Parliament, whereby their Actions
are declared Treasonable, and their persons traitors; And thereupon your
Majesty has set up your Standard against them, whereby you have put the two
Houses of Parliament, an lin them thu whole kingdom out of your Protection; so
that until your Majesty shall recall those Proclamations and Declarations;
whereby the Earl of Est^x and both Houses of Parliament, and their adherents
and assistants, and such as have obeyed and executed their commands and
directions, according to their duties, are declared traitors, or otherwise
delinquents; And until the Standard set up in pursuance of the said
Proclamations be taken down, your Majesty has put us into such a condition,
that whilst we so remain, we cannot by the sundamentall privileges of
Parliament; the public trust reposed in us; or with the general good and
safety of this kingdom give your Majesty any other answer to this Message.

Ioh. Brown Cler. Parl. H. Elsinge Cler. Parl. D. Com.


THis strange Answer might well have discouraged Us from any thought of
proceeding further this way, and informed Us sufficiently what spirit still
governed amongst those few, who continued still in both Houses, therwise after
so many bitter and invective Messages and Declarations sent to Us, and
published against Us, we should not have been reproached with our
Proclamations and Declarations s^t for^h by Us, as the effect of such ^v l^
Counsel, as was unparalle'd by any former examples. We believe indeed such
Proclamations and Declarations have never been before set forth; but were
former times ever acquainted with such intolerable provocations? were there
ever, before these Twelve Months, Declarations published in the name of either
or both Houses of Parliament to make their King odious to the people? Have
either or both Houses ever before assumed or pretended to a power to raise
Arms or leavie War in an cause, or can both Houses together exercise such a
Power? Are those Actions which the Law has defined literally and expressly to
be treasonable, or such Persons to be Traitors, not so because they are done
by Members of either House, or their appointment? And must not We declare such
who March with Arms and Force to destroy Us, to be Traitors, because the
Earl of Essex is their General? Those whom We have or do accuse, We have
named together with their Crimes, notorious by the known Law of the Land, (a
favor not granted to our Evil Counselors) and appeal to that known Law to
judge between Us: And now that by this we should have put the whole Kingdom
out of our Protection (in whose behalf we do all that we have done) is a
corrupt Gloss upon such a Text, as cannot be perverted but by the cunning
practices of such who wish not well to King or People, yet that no weak
Persons might be misled by that imputation upon Us, we sent a Reply to that
Answer in these words.

WE will not repeat what means We have used to prevent the dangerous and
distracted estate of the Kingdom, ^is Maje^ies Reply (...) an An^wer sent ^y
the two ^ouses of ^arlia^ent to ^is Maje^ies Mes^age of the ^5. of Aug
Concerning a trea^e of acco^^^odation.
nor how those means have been interpreted, because being desirous ^o avoid
effusion of blood, We are willing to decline all memory of former bitterness
that might make Our offer of a Treaty less readily accepted.

We never did Declare, nor ever intended to Declare both Our Houses of
Parliament Traitors, or set up Our Standard against them, and much less to
put them and this Kingdom out of Our Protection: We utterly profess against
it before God and the World. And further to remove all possible Scruples which
may hinder the Treaty so much desired by Us; We hereby promise, so that a day
be appointed by you for the revoking of your declarations, against all Persons
as Traitors or other ways, for assisting of Us, we shall with all
cheerfulness upon the same day recall our Proclamations and Declarations and
take down Our Standard: In which Treaty We shall be ready to grant any thing
that shall be really for the good of Our Subjects; Conjuring you to consider
the bleeding condition of Jreland, and the dangerous condition of England, in
as high a degree as by these Our offers We have declared Our self to do: And
assuring you that Our chief desire in this world is to beg^t a good
understanding and mutual confidence betwixt Us and Our two Houses of
Parliament.

THis Message produced an Answer little differing from the former, like men who
had no other measure of the Justice of their cause, then their power to
oppress Us, forgetting their own duties, they sharply inform Us of Ours in
these words,

May it please Your Majesty;
If We the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, The hu^^ble answer and
Pet^^ on of the Lords a^ Commo^^ Assemb^^ in Parl^ment, u^^ the King^ last
Mes^age.
should Repeal all the ways we have taken, the endeavors we have used, and
the expressions we have made unto Your Majestic to prevent thief distractions,
and dangers Your Majesty speaks of, likely to fall upon this Kingdom, we
should too much enlarge this reply, Therefore as we humbly, so shall we only
let Your Majesty know, that we cannot Recede from our former Answer for the
reasons therein expressed. For that Your Majesty has not taken down^ your
Standard, rec^l led Your Proclamations and Declarations, whereby You have
declared the Actions of both Houses of Parliament to be Treasenable and their
persons Traitors. And you have published the same since Your Message of the
twenty fifth of August by your late instructions sent to your Commissioners of
Array, which Standard bring taken down, and the Declarations, Proclamations and
instructions recalled, If your Majestic shall then upon this our humble
perition, leaving Your Forces, return unto your Parliament, and receive their
faithful advice, Your Majesty will find such expressions of our fidelities
and duties, as shall assure You that Your safety, Honor and greatness can
only be found in the affections of Your people, and the sincere Counsels of
Your Parliament, whose constant, and undiscouraged endeavors, and
consultations have passed through difficulties unheard of, only to secure Your
Kingdoms from the violent Mischiefs and dangers now ready to fall upon them,
and every part of them, who deserve better of Your Majesty, and can never allow
themselves (representing likewise your whole Kingdom) to be balanced with
those persons whose desperate dispositions and counsels prevail, still so to
interrupt all our endeavors for the relieving of bleeding Ireland, as we may
fear our labors, and vast expenses will be fruitless to that distressed
Kingdom. As your presence is thus humbly desired by us; So is it in our hopes
your Majesty will in your reason believe, there is no other way then this, to
make your self happy, and your Kingdom safe.

John Brown Cler. Parliament.


WIthout any bitterness or reprehension of their neglect of Us, and the
public Peace, to express Our deep sense of the Calemities at hand, We yet
once more (hoping to awake them to a Christian tenderness toward the whole
Kingdom) sent to them in these words.

WHo have taken most ways, used most endeavors, and made most real
expressions to prevent the present distractions and dangers, let all the world
judge, as well by former Passages as by our two last Messages, which have been
so fruitless, that (though we have descended to desire and press it) not so
much as a Treaty can be obtained, unless we would denude our self of all
force to defend Us from a visible strength marching against Us, and admit those
Persons as Traitors to Us, who according to their duty, their Oaths of
Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defense of Us their King and Liege
Lord (whom we are bound in Conscience and Honor to preserve) though we
disclaimed all our Proclamations and Declarations, and the erecting of our
Standard as against our Parliament. All we have now left in our Power is to
express the deep sense we have of the public misery of this Kingdom, in
which is involved that of Our distressed Protestants of Ireland, and to apply
our self to our necessary defense, wherein we wholly rely upon the Providence
of God, and the justice of our Cause, and the affection of our good People, so
far we are from putting them out of our protection. When you shall desire a
Treaty of Us, we shall piously remember whose blond is to be spilt in this
quarrel, and cheerfully embrace it: And as no other Reason induced Us to
leave our City of London, but that with honor and safety we could not stay
there, nor raise any force but for the necessary defense of our Person and the
Law, against Leavies in opposition to both, so we shall suddenly and most
willingly return to the one, and disband the other, as soon as those causes
shall be removed. The God of Heaven direct you, and in mercy divert those
judgments which hang over this Nation, and so deal with Us and our Posterity
as We desire the Preservation and Advancement of the true Protestant Religion,
the Laws and the Liberty of the Subject, the just Rights of Parliament, and
the Peace of the Kingdom.

But as if all these Gracious Messages had been the effects only of our
weakness, and instances of Our want of Power to resist that torment, they
deal at last more plainly with Us, and after many sharp, causeless, and
unjust reproaches, they tell Us in plain English, that without putting our
Self absolutely into their hands, and deserting all our own Force, and the
protection of all those who have faithfully appeared for Us according to their
duty, there would be no means of a Treaty, although our extraordinary desire
of Peace had prevailed with Us, to offer to recall our most just Declarations,
and to take down our Standard, set up for our necessary defense, so their
unjustifiable Declarations might be likewise recalled, their Answer follows
in these words,

WE the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, do present this our humble
Answer to Your Majesty's Message of the eleventh of this instant Month of
Septem. when we consider the oppressions, Rapines, Firing of Houses, The
humble Answer of the Lord and Commons A^semble d^ in Parliament un^ His
Maj^sties last Message.
Murders, (even at this time, whilst Your Majesty propounds a Treaty)
committed upon Your good Subjects by Your Soldiers, in the presence, and by
the Authority of their Commanders, being of the number of those whom Your
Majesty holds Your self bound in Honor and Conscience to protect as per ons
doing their duties. We cannot think Your Majesty has done all that in You
lies to prevent, or remove the present distractions; nor so long as Your
Majesty will admit no peace without securing the Authors and Instruments of
these mischi^fes from the Justice of the Parliament, which yet shall be ever
dispensed with all requisite moderation and distinction of offenses, Although
some of those persons be such in whose preservation Your Kingdom cannot be
safe, nor the unquestionable rights and Privileges of Parliament be
maintained, without which the power and dignity thereof will fall into
contempt. We beseech Your Majesty therefore to consider Your expressions, That
God should deal with You and Your posterity, as Your Majesty desir^s the
preservation of the Just Rights of Parliament, which being undeniable in the
trying of such as We have declared to be Delinquents, We shall believe Your
Majesty both toward Your self and Parliament will not in this privilege, We
are most sensible of, deny us that which belongs unto the meanest Court of
Justice in this Kingdom. Neither has Your Majesty cause to complain that You
are denied a Treaty, when We offer all that a Treaty can produce, or Your
Majesty expect, Security, Honor, Service, Obedience, Support, and all other
effects of an Humble, Loyal, and faithful subjection, and seek nothing but
that our Religion, Liberty, peace of the Kingdom, safety of the Parliament may
be secured from the open violence, and cunning practices of a wicked party, who
have long plotted our ruin and destruction; And if there were any cause of
Treaty, we know no competent Persons to Treat betwixt the King and Parliament,
And if both cause and persons were such as to invite Treaty, the season is
altogether unfit, whilst Your Majesty's Standard is up, and Your Preclamations
and Declarations unrecalled, whereby Your Parliament is charged with Treason.

If Your Majesty shall persist to make Your self a shield and defense to those
Instruments, and shall continue to reject our faithful and necessary advice
for securing and main^aing Religion and Liberty, with the Peace of the Kingdom
and safety of the Parliament, We doubt not but to indifferent judgments it
will easily appear who is most tender of that innocent Blood which is like to
be spilt in this cause, Your Majesty, who by such persisting, does endanger
Your self and Your Kingdoms, or We, who are willing to hazard our selves, to
preserve both. We humbly beseech Your Majesty to consider how impossible it
is, that any Protestation, though published in Your Majesty's name, of the
tenderness of the miseries of Your Protestant Subjects in Jreland, of Your
Resolution to maintain the Protestant Religion, and Laws of this Kingdom,
can give satisfaction to reasonable and indifferent Men, (...) of them, and
agents for them, are admitted to Your Majesty's presence with Grace and Favor,
and some of them employed in Your service; when the Clothes, Munition, Horses,
and other Necessaries bought by Your Parliament and sent for the supply of the
Army against the Rebels there, are violently taken away, some by Your
Majesty's command, others by Your Ministers, and applied to the maintenance of
an unnatural War against your people here.

All this notwithstanding as we never gave Your Majesty any just cause of
withdrawing Your self from Your great Council, so it has ever been, and
shall ever be far from us to give any impediment to your return, or to
neglect any proper means of curing the distempers of the Kingdom, and closing
the dangerous Breaches betwixt Your Majesty and Your Parliament, according to
the great trust which lies upon us, and if Your Majesty shall now be pleased to
come back to Your Parliament, without Your Forces, we shall be ready to secure
Your Royal Person, Your Crown, and Dignity, with our Lives and Fortunes, Your
prosence in this Your great Council, being the only means of any Treaty
betwixt Your Majesty and them with hope of Success.

And in none of our desires to Your Majesty shall we be swayed by any
particular man's advantage, but shall give a clear Testimony to Your Majesty,
and the whole World, that in all things done by us, we faithfully intend the
good of your Majesty, and of Your Kingdoms, and that we will not be diverted
from this end by any private, or self respects whatsoever.

John Brown Cler. Parliament.


THey will not believe we have done all that in us lies to prevent and remove
the present Distractions, because of the oppressions, rapines, and the like
committed upon our good Subjects by our soldiers. Let them remember who have
compelled us, and against our souls desire, forced us to raise those
soldiers, and then if the oppressions and rapines were indeed such as are
falsely pretended, our poor Subjects who suffer under them, will look on
them, and only on them, as the Authors of all the miseries they do or can
undergo, we confess with grief of heart some disorders have, and many more may
befall our good people by our soldiers, but we appeal to all those Counties
through which we have passed, what care we have taken to prevent, and what
Justice we daily inflict upon such offenders: neither has the least complaint
been ever made to us of violences and outrages, which we have not to our utmost
power repaired or punished; how ever those false and treasonable Pa^phlets are
suffered which accuse us of giving warrant for plandring of houses. Our Mercy
and Lenity is so well known to the contrary, that it is usually made an excuse
by those who against their consciences assist this rebellion against us, that
they cause rather to offend us upon the confidence of pardon, then provoke
those Malignant persons who without charity or companion destroy all who
concur not with them in faction and opinion. How far we are from rapine and
oppression may appear by our Lenity to the persons and Estates of those who
have not only exercised the Militia (the seed from whence this rebellion
against us has grown) but contributed money and plate to the maintenance of
that Army which now endeavors to destroy us, as of Nottingham, Leicester, and
many other places through which we have passed many of whom then were and now
are in that Army: to let pass our passing by Chartly (the house of the Earl
of Essex) without other pressures then as if he were the General of our own
Army, and our express orders to restrain the Liberty, our soldiers would
otherwise have used upon that place, and his Estate about it. How contrary the
proceedings are of these great Assertors of the public Liberties, appears
fully by the said instances they every ^ay give in the plundring by public
warrant, the houses of all such whose duty, conscience, and loyalty has
engaged them in our Quarrel, which every good man ought to make his own. By
their declaring all persons to be out of the protection of Parliament (and so
exposing them to the fury of their soldiers) who will not assist this
rebellion against us, their anointed King, by the daily outrages committed in
Yorkshire, when contrary to the desire and agreement of that County (signed
under the hands of both parties) they will not suffer the peace to be kept, but
that the distractions and confusion may be universal over the whole Kingdom,
direct their Governor of Hull to make War upon our good Subjects in that
County, and so continue the robbing and plundring the houses of all such who
concur not with them in this rebellion. Lastly, by the barbarous, sacrilegious
inhumanity exercised by their soldiers in Churches, as in Canterbury,
Worcester, Oxford, and other places, where they committed such unheard of
outrages, as I^wes, and Atheists, never practiced before. God in his good time
will make them examples of his vengeance.

We never did, nor ever shall desire to secure the Authors and instruments of
any mischiefs to the Kingdom from the Justice of Parliament, we desire all
such persons may be speedily brought to condign punishment by that rule which
is, or ought to be, the rule of all punishment, the known Law of the Land, if
there have seemed to be any interruption in proceedings of this nature, it must
be remembered, how long persons have been kept under general accusations,
without trial, though earnestly desired, that the Members who were properly to
judge such accusations have by violence been driven thence, or could not with
honor and safety be present at such debates, that notorious Delinquents by the
known Laws were protected against us from the Justice of the Kingdom, and
such called Delinquents, who committing no offense against any known Law were
so voted only for doing their duties to us, and then there will be no cause of
complaint found against us.

And for the privileges of Parliament We have said so much and upon such
reasons, (which have never been answered but by bare positive Assertions) in
our several Declarations, that we may well, and do still use the same
expression, That we desire God may so deal with Us and our posterity, as we
desire the preservation of the just Rights of Parliament.

The violation whereof in truth by these desperate Persons is so clearly known
to all men who understand the privileges of Parliament, that their rage and
malice has not been greater to Our Person and Government then to the Liberty,
privilege, and very being of Parliaments, witness their putting imputting
out, and suspending what persons they please, as they dislike their opinions,
their bringing cowne the Tumults to assault the Members, and awe the
Parliament, their posting and prosecuting such Members of either House as
concurred not with them in their Designs, and so driving them from thence for
the safety of their lives, their denying Us, against the known, established
Law, and the Constitution of the kingdom, to have a negative voice, without
which no Parliament can consist, their making close Committees, from whence the
Members of the Houses are exempted, against the Liberty of Parliament, and
lastly resolving both Houses into a close Committee, of seventeene persons who
undertake and direct all the present outrages and the managery of this
Rebellion against Us, in the absence of four parts of five of both Houses, and
without the privity of those who stay there, which is not only contrary but
destructive to Parliaments themselves. By these gross, unheard of Invasions
and breaches of the Privledges of Parliament, (and without them they could not
have done the other) They made way for their attempts upon the Law of the Land,
and the introduction of that unlimited, Arbitrary power which they have since
exercised to the intolerable da mage and confusion of the whole kingdom, And
We assure Our good Subjects the Vindication of these just Liberties and
Privileges of Parliament, thus violated by these men, is not less the
Argument of our present quarrel and undertaking, then our own Honor,
Interest, and safety, those being no way so securely to be preserved, as by
preserving Parliaments and their just Privileges. Neither is there any
Protestation to our knowledge published in our name of our tenderness of the
miseries of Ireland, and our Resolution to maintain the Protestant Religion,
and Laws of this Kingdom, that is not the Protestation of our Soul, and
manifested in all our actions, and We hope that false Scandal, That diverse
of the Irish Traitors and Rebels, the known favorers of them, and Agents for
them are admitted to our presence with favor and employed in our service, will
gain no credit with good men, who remember well the notorious imputation so
confidently and groundlessly heretofore cast on us by Master Pym, of which as
there could never be the least proof, so we could never receive any
satisfaction for that high in jury, which might have been a warning to them to
have published no more such untruths, if they had not found that truth and
their Ends cannot meet together.

For the Horses taken for our Service, which were provided for the service of
Ireland, It is true, We were compelled for the bringing our own wagons from
Chester for the Carriage of our Munition to make use of them being few in
number and of small value, after they were certified to be of no use for the
service, for which they were provided. And for the Clothes, upon enquiry We
find that some few were taken by our Soldiers (but without any order from Us)
going to Coventry, and as was probably believed for the relief of that place,
then in actual Rebellion against Us, but how far we have bin, and are from
diverting any of those provisions made for the relief of that poor Kingdom
(the thought of whose miserable condition makes our heart bleed) may appear by
our express command given for the speedy transportation of 3000. suites of
Clothes which We found provided at Chester, but neglected to be sent, and
which no necessity of our own Army here could prevail with us to seize. And
how bold soever the reproaches of that kind have ^in upon Us, we are confident
malice it self cannot lay the least probable imputation upon us, for the
neglect of our duty toward that Kingdom. What one thing in our power have we
neglected or omitted, which might contribute to the assistance, or ease of our
poor Protestant Subjects there? we first recommended the case of that
business to both our Houses of Parliament. We consented to all propositions
made on the behalf offered to raise 10000. Volunteers, (which if then accepted
had shortened that work) offered to venture our own person in the service,
what interpretation that offer of ours found, is known to all the world, we
parted with our Interest in the Land of the Rebels, to encourage such who were
willing to adventure in that business, and when Money is raised by our consent
for that sole purpose, they have at once seized on a hundred thousand pound
particularly appointed by Act of Parliament for the relief of Jreland (our
Army being ready to perish for want of it) and employed it to maintain this
unnatural civil War at home. They have Leavied men and entertained
Commanders for that service, and t^ed compelled them to join in this
Rebellion, and to march against us, and though they have complained of our
keeping the Liev tenant of Ireland some weeks with us, (when in truth it was a
season of extraordinary business,) after we had in vain for many Months
pressed his dispatch, yet themselves now detain him, when his going is so
necessary for the preservation of that Kingdom. And no doubt these men (and
these alone) by begetting this miserable distraction of England, are guilty
before God and Man of all the insupportable calamities that our Kingdom of
Jreland endures. Let all the world judge where the desire of peace is, and upon
whose account the blood and confusion which has been shed and must follow,
shall be cast, And whether the several Proclamations and Declarations
published by us, have not been extorted from us, by such unheard of
insolences and injuries, which no former times ever produced, neither can any
sober man wonder when We are publicly reproached, traduced, and reviled to
our people (a practice never known till this Parliament) that We endeavor by
a true relation and Declaration of our Actions and Intentions, and of their
Conspiracies, who have vowed our destruction, to inform our good Subjects of
the cunning and malice they are to encounter with; and when a Combination is
entered into to destroy Us, and to alter the Religion and Law of the Kingdom,
and to that purpose an Army raised and marching against us, that We proclaim
the General of that Army and such who shall assist him in leavying a war
against us, to be Traitors and have set up our Royal Standard, and required
all our good Subjects to come to our defense. And yet both in that Proclamation
and in all our Declarations we have never accused our Parliament, but such
factious, seditious Members of both Houses whom we have named, and whom We are
ready to prove according to the rules of the known Law to be guilty of High
Treason. We well know, and all the Kingdom knows that of near 500. Members,
which the House of Commons contaynes, there remains not now there 100. neither
has above such a number consented almost to any thing of which we have ever
complained, the rest have either been driven away by Tumults and Threats of
the Persons whom we have accused, or out of Conscience withdrawn themselves
from their desperate Consultations, and of about 100. Peers of the Realm,
there are not above 15. or 16. who concur in these miserable Resolutions,
which disturb the public Peace, many of which being of desperate fortunes,
have no other support, then the commands now given them to make war upon us,
and now these men must sit upon the lives and fortunes of all the Nobility,
Gentry, and Commons of England, and because we will not put our self into the
hands, Government, and disposal of them, all our good Subjects are invited and
encouraged to rebel against us, yet we have been, and are still far from
accusing all that small number of both Houses who are yet left together, we
believe many of them are misled by the cunning and malice, and frighted by the
power of those men whom we have accused, against every one of whom we have
evidence of matter of fact, that the known Law of the Land determines to be
High Treason.

And now that all Our good Subjects may see how desirous these men and their
adherents are to prevent the effusion of blood, and the lasting miseries of a
Civil War, they will make themselves so considerable, that except we will
recall our Proclamations and Declarations whereby particular men named for
particular Actions (which the Law has defined to be Treason) are so accused,
and others warned from involving themselves in their guilt, and except we will
take down our Standard, that our good Subjects may not repair to us for our
defense, when so many Armies are raised against us in several parts of the
kingdom, and ready to destroy us, and such of our good Subjects, who dare
continue loyal to us, and except we will return to London, from whence with
violence we have been driven, we must not be treated with, or receive any
Answer to so gracious a Message.

It can no longer be doubted by any man, who has not wilfully forsaken his
understanding, that it is no more a quarrel undertaken by the Parliament, but
contrived and fomented by the persons we have named, and now continued solely
in their defense, to whose Ambition, Faction, and Malice, the true reformed
protestant Religion, the just Right, Honor, Safety, and life of us and our
posterity the Law of the Land, which has so long preserved this Nation happy,
the liberty of the Subject established by that Law, and the glorious frame and
constitution of this kingdom must be sacrificed. But as we have hitherto left
no Action unperformed, which in honor, justice and Conscience we were obliged
to do, or in Christian policy and prudence we could conceave might probably
prevent these Calamities, so we thank God he has given us a full courage and
resolution to run the utmost hazard of our life for the suppression of this
horrible Rebellion, in the which no disproportion of power, Arms, or money
shall discourage us; And we hope that all our good Subjects besides, by the
common duty of Allegiance, will be stirred up for their own sakes, for the
preservation of the blessed Protestant Religion, and for the upholding this
whole admirable frame of Government which being dissolved, all their private
and particular rights and Interest must be immediately confounded, to bring in
their utmost power and assistance unto us in this desperate exigent. And We do
declare that whosoever shall lose his life in this Service for our defense, the
Wardship of his Heir shall be granted by us without rent or Fine to his own
use, and we shall hold our self obliged to take all possible care for the
support, relief, and protection of all their wives, and Children, who shall
have the hard fortune to dye in this Service.

FINIS.
