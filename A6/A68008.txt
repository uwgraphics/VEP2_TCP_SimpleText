Aymon unto his brethren except oonly that he retained for himself the castle
and town of Mountawban / and found the ways that they were al married noble
and rychely. Who yt should speak of the brethren of Reynawde and of their

and made to be brought there speres and sheldes for to assaye theymselfe / and
took with him twenty knights / whom when they were ^omen in the feelde / he
made his children to iouste with. And ye ought to wit that ye two sons of
