THEOLOGIA EKLEKTIK. A DISCOURSE OF The Liberty of Prophesying. SHOWING THE
UNREASONABLENES of prescribing to other men's Faith, and the Iniquity of
persecuting differing opinions.

By IER: TAILOR, D. D. Chaplain in Ordinary to His MAJESTY.

LONDON, Printed for R. ROYSTON, at the Angel in Ivie-lane. 1647.

To the Right Honorable CHRISTOPHER Lord HATTON, Baron HATTON of Kirby;
Comptroler of His Majesty's Household, and one of His Majesty's most Honorable
Priyie Council.
My Lord,
IN this great Storm which has dashed the Vessel of the Church all in pieces,
I have been cast upon the Coast of Wales, and in a little Boat thought to have
enjoyed that rest and quietness, which in England in a greater I could not
hope for: Here I cast Anchor, and thinking to ride safely, the Storm followed
me with so impetuous violence, that it broke a Cable, and I lost my Anchor: And
here again I was exposed to the mercy of the Sea, and the gentleness of an
Element that could neither distinguish things nor persons. And but that he who
stilleth the raging of the Sea, and the noise of his Waves, and the madness of
his people, had provided a Plank for me, I had been lost to all the
opportunities of content or study. But I know not whether I have been more
preserved by the courtesies of my friends, or the gentleness and mercies of a
noble Enemy: (...). And now since I have come ashore, I have been gathering a
few sticks to warm me, a few books to entertain my thoughts, and divert them
from the perpetual Meditation of my private Troubles, and the public
Dyscrasy, but those which I could obtain were so few and so impertinent, and
unusefull to any great purposes, that I began to be sad upon a new stock, and
full of apprehension that I should live unprofitably, and die obscurely, and be
forgotten, and my bones thrown into some common charnell house, without any
name or note to distinguish me from those who only served their Generation by
filling the number of Citizens, and who could pretend to no thanks or reward
from the Public, beyond a jus trium liberorum. While I was troubled with these
thoughts, and busy to find out an opportunity of doing some good in my small
proportion, still the cares of the public did so intervene, that it was as
impossible to separate my design from relating to the present, as to exempt my
self from the participation of the common calamity; still half my thoughts
was (in despite of all my diversions and arts of avocation) fixed upon and
mingled with the present concernments: so that besides them I could not go.
Now because the great Question is concerning Religion, and in that also my
Scene lies, I resolved here to fix my considerations, especially when I
observed the ways of promoting the several opinions which now are busy, to
be such, as besides that they were most troublesome to me, and such as I could
by no means be friends withal, they were also such as to my understanding,
did the most apparently disserve their ends whose design in advancing their own
opinions was pretended for Religion: For as contrary as cruelty is to mercy, as
tyranny to charity, so is war and bloodshed to the meekness and gentleness
of Christian Religion: And however that there are some exterminating spirits
who think God to delight in humane sacrifices, as if that Oracle -- (...), had
come from the Father of Spirits, yet if they were capable of cool and tame
Homilies, or would hear men of other opinions give a quiet account without
invincible resolutions never to alter their persuasions, I am very much
persuaded it would not be very hard to dispute such men into mercies and
compliances, and Tolerations mutual, such I say, who are zealous for Jesus
Christ; then whose Doctrine never was any thing more merciful and humane,
whose lessons were softer then Nard, or the juice of the Candian Olive: Upon
the first apprehension, I designed a Discourse to this purpose, with as much
greediness as if I had thought it possible with my Arguments to have persuaded
the rough and hard handed Soldiers to have disbanded presently: For I had
often thought of the Prophecy that in the Gospel, our swords should be turned
into plowshares, and our Spears into pruning hooks; I knew that no tittle
spoken by Gods Spirit could return unperform'd and ineffectuall, and I was
certain, that such was the excellency of Christ's Doctrine, that if men would
obey it, Christians should never war one against another; in the mean time I
considered not, that it was praedictio consilii, non eventus, till I saw what
men were now doing, and ever had done since the heats and primitive fervours
did cool, and the love of interests sweld higher then the love of
Christianity; but then on the other side, I began to fear that whatever I could
say would be as ineffectuall, as it could be reasonable: For if those excellent
words which our blessed Master spoke, could not charm the tumult of our
spirits, I had little reason to hope that one of the meanest and most ignorant
of his servants could advance the end of that which he calls his great, and his
old, and his new Commandment, so well as the excellency of his own Spirit and
discourses could. And yet since he who knew every event of things, and the
success and efficacy of every Doctrine; and that very much of it to most men,
and all of it to some men would be ineffectuall, yet was pleased to consign our
duty that it might be a direction to them that would, and a conviction and a
Testimony against them that would not obey, I thought it might not misbecome my
duty and endeavors to plead for peace and charity, and forgiveness and
permissions mutual, although I had reason to believe that such is the iniquity
of men, and they so indisposed to receive such impresses, that I had as good
plow the Sands, or till the Air, as persuade such Doctrines, which destroy
men's interests, and serve no end but the great end of a happy eternity, and
what is in order to it. But because the events of things are in Gods
disposition, and I knew them not, and because if I had known my good purposes
would be totally ineffectuall as to others, yet my own designation and purposes
would be of advantage to my self, who might from Gods mercy expect the
retribution which he is pleased to promise to all pious intendments; I resolved
to encounter with all Objections, and to do something to which I should be
determined by the consideration of the present distemperatures and necessities,
by my own thoughts, by the Questions and Scruples, the Sects and names, the
interests and animosities which at this day, and for some years past have
exercised and disquieted Christendom.

Thus far I discourst my self into employment, and having come thus far, I
knew not how to get farther, for I had heard of a great experience, how
difficult it was to make Brick without Straw, and here I had even seen my
design blasted in the bud, and I despaired in the Calends of doing what I
purposed in the Ides before: For I had no Books of my own here, nor any in the
voisinage, and but that I remembered the result of some of those excellent
Discourses, I had heard your Lordship make when I was so happy as in private to
gather up what your temperance and modesty, forbids to be public, I had come
in praelia inermis, and like enough might have fared accordingly. I had this
only advantage besides; that I have chosen a Subject, in which, if my own
reason does not abuse me, I needed no other books or aides, then what a man
carries with him on horseback, I mean the common principles of Christianity,
and those (...) which men use in the transactions of the ordinary occurrences
of civil society; and upon the strength of them and some other collateral
assistances I have run through it utcunque, and the sum of the following
Discourses, is nothing but the sense of these words of Scripture;

That since we know in part, and prophesy in part, 1 Cor. 13.
and that now we see through a glass darkly, we should not despise or contemn
persons not so knowing as our selves, but him that is weak in the faith Romans 14.
we should receive, but not to doubtful disputations; Therefore certainly to
charity, and not to vexations, not to those which are the idle effects of
impertinent wranglings. And provided they keep close to the foundation, which
is Faith and Obedience, let them build upon this foundation matter more or
less precious, yet if the foundation be entire, they shall be saved with or
without loss. And since we profess our selves servants of so meek a Master,
and Disciples of so charitable an Institute, Let us walk worthy of the vocation
wherewith we are called with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering,
forbearing Ephesians. 4. 2, 3.
one another in love; for this is the best endeavoring to keep the unity of
the Spirit, when it is fast tied in the bond of peace. And although it be a
duty of Christianity, that we all speak the 1 Cor. 1. 10.
same thing, that there be no divisions among us, but that we be perfectly
joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, yet this unity is
to be estimated according to the unity of faith, in things necessary, in
matters of Creed, and Articles fundamental; for as for other things, it is
more to be wished then to be hoped for; there are some doubtful Disputations,
and in such the Scribe, the Romans 14.
Wise, the Disputer of this world, are most commonly very far from certainty,
and many times from truth: There are diversity of persuasions in matters
adiaphorous, as meats and drinks, and holy days, etc. and both parties, the
affirmative and the negative, affirm and deny with innocence enough, for the
observer and he that observes not, intend both to God; and God is our common
Master, we all fellow servants, and not the judge of each other, in matters of
conscience or doubtful Disputation: And every man that has faith must have it
to himself before God, but no man must either in such matters judge his
brother or set him at naught; but let us follow after the things which make for
peace, and things wherewith one may edify another: And the way to do that is
not by knowledge, but by charity, for knowledge puffs up, but 1 Cor. 8. 1.
charity edifieth; and since there is not in every man the same knowledge, but
the conscience of some are Verse. 7.
weak; as my liberty must not be judged of another 1 Cor. 10. 29.
man's weak conscience, so must not I please my self so much in my right
opinion, but I must also take order that his weak conscience be not offended or
despised, for no man must seek his own but every man Ibid,
another wealth: And although we must contend earnestly for the faith, yet
above all things we must put on charity which is the bond of perfectness: And
therefore this contention must be with arms fit for the Christian warfare, the
sword of the Spirit, and the shield of Faith, and preparation of the Gospel of
peace instead of shoes, and a helmet of salvation, but not with Colos. 3. 14.
other arms; for a Churchman must not be (...), a striker, for the weapons of
our warfare are not carnal but spiritual, and the persons that use them ought
to be gentle, and easy to be entreated, and we must give an account of our
faith to them that ask us with meekness and humility, for so is the will of
God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.
These and thousands more to the same purpose are the Doctrines of Christianity,
whose sense and intendment I have prosecuted in the following Discourse, being
very much displeased that so many opinions and new doctrines are commenced
among us, but more troubled that every man that has an opinion thinks his own
and other men's salvation is concerned in its maintenance, but most of all that
men should be persecuted and afflicted for disagreeing in such opinions which
they cannot with sufficient grounds obtrude upon others necessarily, because
they cannot propound them infallibly, and because they have no warrant from
Scripture so to do: For if I shall tie other men to believe my opinion,
because I think I have place of Scripture, which seems to warrant it to my
understanding, why may he not serve up another dish to me in the same dress,
and exact the same task of me to believe the contradictory: And then since all
the Heretics in the world have offered to prove their Articles by the same
means by which true believers propound theirs, it is necessary that some
separation either of Doctrine or of persons be clearly made, that all pretenses
may not be admitted, nor any just Allegations be rejected; and yet that in some
other Questions whether they be truly or falsely pretended if not evidently or
demonstratively, there may be considerations had to the persons of men and to
the Laws of charity more then to the triumphing in any opinion or doctrine not
simply necessary. Now because some doctrines are clearly not necessary, and
some are absolutely necessary, why may not the first separation be made upon
this difference, and Articles necessary be only urged as necessary, and the
rest left to men indifferently, as they were by the Scripture indeterminately.
And it were well if men would as much consider themselves as the Doctrines, and
think that they may as well be deceived by their own weakness, as persuaded by
the Arguments of a Doctrine which other men, as wise, call inevident. For it is
a hard case that we shall think all Papists and Anabaptists and Sacramentaries
to be fools and wicked persons, certainly among all these Sects there are very
many wise men and good men, as well as erring; and although some zeales are so
hot, and their eyes so inflamed with their ardors, that they do not think
their Adversaries look like other men, yet certainly we find by the results of
their discourses, and the transactions of their affairs of civil society,
that they are men that speak and make syllogismes, and use reason, and read
Scripture, and although they do no more understand all of it, then we do, yet
they endeavor to understand as much as concerns them, even all that they can,
even all that concerns repentance from dead works, and faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ: And therefore me thinks this also should be another consideration
distinguishing the persons, for if the persons be Christians in their lives,
and Christians in their profession, if they acknowledge the Eternal Son of
God for their Master and their Lord, and live in all relations as becomes
persons making such professions, why then should I hate such persons whom God
loves, and who love God, who are partakers of Christ, and Christ has a title
to them, who dwell in Christ, and Christ in them, because their understandings
have not been brought up like mine, have not had the same Masters, they have
not met with the same books, nor the same company, or have not the same
interest, or are not so wise, or else are wiser, (that is, for some reason or
other which I neither do understand, nor ought to blame) have not the same
opinions that I have, and do not determine their School Questions to the sense
of my Sect or interest.

But now I know before hand, that those men who will endure none but their own
Sect, will make all manner of attemps against these purposes of charity and
compliance, and say I, or do I what I can, will tell all their Proselytes that
I preach indifferency of Religion, that I say it is no matter how we believe,
nor what they profess: But that they may comply with all Sects, and do
violence to their own consciences, that they may be saved in all Religions, and
so make way for a colluvies of Heresies, and by consequence destroy all
Religion. Nay, they will say worse then all this, and but that I am not used to
their phrases and forms of declamation, I am persuaded I might represent fine
Tragedies before hand. And this will be such an objection, that although I am
most confident I shall make apparent to be as false and scandalous as the
Objectors themselves are zealous and impatient, yet besides that, I believe the
Objection will come where my answers will not come, or not be understood; I am
also confident that in defiance and incuriousnesse of all that I shall say,
some men will persist pertinaciously in the accusation, and deny my conclusion
in despite of me: well, but however I will try.

And first I answer, that whatsoever is against the foundation of Faith, or
contrary to good life and the laws of obedience, or destructive to humane
society, and the public and just interests of bodies politic, is out of the
limits of my Question, and does not pretend to compliance or toleration: So
that I allow no indifferency, nor any countenance to those Religions whose
principles destroy Government, nor to those Religions (if there be any such)
that teach ill life, nor do I think that any thing will now excuse from
belief of a fundamental Article, except stupidity or sottishness and
natural inhability. This alone is sufficient answer to this vanity, but I have
much more to say.

Secondly, The intendment of my Discourse is, that permissions should be in
Questions speculative, indeterminable, curious, and unnecessary, and that men
would not make more necessities then God made, which indeed are not many. The
fault I find and seek to remedy is, that men are so dogmaticall and resolute in
their opinions, and impatient of others disagreeings in those things wherein is
no sufficient means of union and determination, but that men should let
opinions and problemes keep their own forms, and not be obtruded as axioms,
nor questions in the vast collection of the systeme of Divinity, be adopted
into the family of Faith: And I think I have reason to desire this.

Thirdly, It is hard to say, that he who would not have men put to death, or
punished corporally for such things, for which no humane Authority is
sufficient either for cognizance or determination, or competent for infliction,
that he persuades to an indifferency, when he referres to another Judicatory,
which is competent, sufficient, infallible, just, and highly severe. No man or
company of men can judge or punish our thoughts, or secret purposes whilst
they so remain, and yet it will be unequal to say, that he who owns this
Doctrine preaches it lawful for men to think or purpose what they will. And so
it is in matters of doubtful disputation (such as are the distinguishing
Articles of most of the Sects of Christendom:) So it is in matters
intellectual (which are not cognoscible by a secular power) in matters
spiritual (which are to be discerned by spiritual Authority, which cannot
make corporal inflictions) and in Questions indeterminate, (which are
doubtfully propounded or obscurely, and therefore may be in utramque partem
disputed or believed;) for God alone must be Judge of these matters, who alone
is Master of our souls, and has a dominion over humane understanding, and he
that says this, does not say that indifferency is persuaded, because God alone
is Judge of erring persons.

Fourthly, No part of this Discourse teaches or encourages variety of Sects,
and contradiction in opinions, but supposes them already in being, and
therefore since there are, and ever were, and ever will be variety of opinions,
because there is variety of humane understandings, and uncertainty in things,
no man should be too forward in determining all Questions, nor so forward in
prescribing to others, nor invade that liberty which God has left to us entire
by propounding many things obscurely, and by exempting our souls and
understandings from all power externally compulsory: So that the restraint is
laid upon men's tyranny, but no license given to men's opinions, they are not
considered in any of the Conclusions, but in the premises only as an Argument
to exhort to charity. So that if I persuade a license of discrediting any thing
which God has commanded us to believe, and allow a liberty where God has not
allowed it, let it be shown, and let the Objection press as hard as it can;
but to say that men are too forward in condemning where God has declared no
sentence nor prescribed any rule; is to dissuade from tyranny, not to encourage
licentiousness, is to take away a license of judging, not to give a license of
dogmatizing what every one please, or as may best serve his turn. And for the
other part of the Objection;

Fifthly, This Discourse is so far from giving leave to men to profess any
thing though they believe the contrary, that it takes order that no man shall
be put to it, for I earnestly contend that another man's opinion shall be no
rule to mine, and that my opinion shall be no snare and prejudice to my self,
that men use one another so charitably and so gently, that no error or
violence tempt men to hypocrisy, this very thing being one of the Arguments I
use to persuade permissions, lest compulsion introduce hypocrisy, and make
sincerity troublesome and unsafe.

Sixthly, If men would not call all opinions by the name of Religion, and
superstructures by the name of fundamental Articles, and all fancies by the
glorious appellative of Faith, this objection would have no pretense or
footing, so that it is the disease of the men, not any cause that is ministered
by such precepts of charity that makes them perpetually clamorous: And it would
be hard to say that such Physicians are incurious of their Patients, and
neglectfull of their health, who speak against the unreasonablenesse of such
Empericks that would cut off a man's head if they see but a Wart upon his cheek,
or a dimple upon his chin, or any lines in his face to distinguish him from
another man; the case is altogether the same, and we may as well decree a Wart
to be mortal as a various opinion in re alioqui non necessaria to be capital
and damnable.

For I consider, that there are but few Doctrines of Christianity, that were
ordered to be preached to all the world, to every single person, and made a
necessary Article of his explicit belief: Other Doctrines which are all of
them not simply necessary, are either such as are not clearly revealed, or such
as are: If they be clearly revealed, and that I know so too, or may, but for
my own fault, I am not to be excused, but for this I am to be left to Gods
judgment, unless my fault be externally such as to be cognoscible and
punishable in humane judicatory: But then, if it be not so revealed but that
wise men and good men differ in their opinions, it is a clear case, it is not
inter dogmata necessaria simpliciter, and then it is certain I may therefore
safely disbelieve it, because I may be safely ignorant of it: For if I may with
innocence be ignorant, then to know it or believe it, is not simply obligatory;
ignorance is absolutely inconsistent with such an obligation, because it is
destructive and a plain negative to its performance, and if I do my honest
endeavor to understand it, and yet do not attain it, it is certain that is
not obligatory to me so much as by accident, for no obligation can press the
person of a man, if it be impossible, no man is bound to do more then his
best, no man is bound to have an excellent understanding, or to be infallible,
or to be wiser then he can, for these are things that are not in his choice,
and therefore not a matter of a Law, nor subject to reward and punishment; so
that where ignorance of the Article is not a sin, there disbelieving it in the
right sense, or believing it in the wrong, is not breach of any duty,
essentially or accidentally necessary, neither in the thing it self, nor to
the person; that is, he is neither bound to the Article, nor to any endeavors
or antecedent acts of volition and choice, and that man who may safely be
ignorant of the proposition, is not tied at all to search it out, and if not at
all to search it, then certainly not to find it: All the obligation we are
capable of, is not to be malicious or voluntarily criminal in any kind, and
then if by accident we find out a truth, we are obliged to believe it; and so
will every wise or good man do; indeed he cannot do otherwise: But if he
disbelieves an Article without malice, or design, or involuntarily, or
unknowingly, it is contradiction to say it is a sin to him who might totally
have been ignorant of it; for that he believes it in the wrong sense, it is his
ignorance, and it is impossible that where he has heartily endeavored to
find out a truth, that this endeavor should make him guilty of a sin, which
would never have been laid to his charge, if he had taken no pains at all: His
ignorance in this case is not a fault at all; possibly it might, if there had
been no endeavor to have cured it.

So that there is wholly a mistake in this proposition: For true it is, there
are some propositions, which if a man never hear of, they will not be required
of him; and they who cannot read might safely be ignorant, that Melchizedeck
was King of Salem; but he who reads it in the Scripture, may not safely
contradict it, although before that knowledge did arrive to him, he might
safely have been ignorant of it: But this although it be true, is not pertinent
to our Question; For in sensu diviso this is true, that which at one time a man
may be ignorant of, at some other time he may not disbelieve: But in sensu
conjuncto it is false; For at what time, and in what circumstance soever it is
no sin to be ignorant, at that time and in that conjuncture, it is no sin
to disbelieve; and such is the nature of all Questions disputable, which are
therefore not required of us to be believed in any one particular sense,
because the nature of the thing is such as not to be necessary to be known at
all simply and absolutely, and such is the ambiguity and cloud of its face and
representment as not to be necessary so much as by accident, and therefore not
to the particular sense of any one person.

And yet such is the iniquity of men, that they suck in opinions as wild Asses
do the wind, without distinguishing the wholesome from the corrupted air, and
then live upon it at a venture, and when all their confidence is built upon
zeal and mistake, yet therefore because they are zealous and mistaken, they
are impatient of contradiction.

But besides that against this I have laid prejudice enough from the dictates
of holy Scripture, it is observable that this with its appendant degrees, I
mean restraint of Prophesying, imposing upon other men's understanding, being
masters of their consciences, and lording it over their Faith, came in with the
retinue and train of Antichrist, that is, they came as other abuses and
corruptions of the Church did, by reason of the iniquity of times, and the
cooling of the first heats of Christianity, and the increase of interest, and
the abatements of Christian simplicity, when the Churches fortune grew better,
and her Sons grew worse, and some of her Fathers worst of all; For in the
first three hundred years there was no sign of persecuting any man for his
opinion, though at that time there were very horrid opinions commenced, and
such which were exemplary and parallel enough to determine this Question; for
they then were assaulted by new Sects which destroyed the common principles of
nature, of Christianity, of innocence and public society; and they who used
all the means Christian and Spiritual for their disimprovement and
conviction, thought not of using corporal force, otherwise then by blaming
such proceedings: And therefore I do not only urge their not doing it as an
Argument of the unlawfulness of such proceeding, but their defying it and
speaking against such practices, as unreasonable and destructive of
Christianity: For so Tertullian is express, Humani Ad Scapulat.
juris and naturalis potestatis, unicuique quod putaverit colere, sed nec
religionis est cogere religionem, quae suscipi debet sponte non vi: The same is
the Doctrine of S. Cyprian, Lactantius, S. Hilary, Minutius Felix, Sulpitius
Severus, S. Chrysostom, S. Hierom, S. Austin, Damascen, Theophylact, Socrates
Scholasticus, and S. Bernard, as they are severally referred to and urged upon
occasion in the following Discourse.

To which I add, that all wise Princes till they were overborn with faction or
solicited by peevish persons, gave Toleration to differing Sects, whose
opinions did not disturb the public interest: But at first, there were some
heretical persons that were also impatient of an Adversary, and they were the
men who at first entreated the Emperors to persecute the Catholics; but till
four hundred years after Christ, no Catholic persons, or very few, did
provoke the secular arm, or implore its aid against the Heretics, save only
that Arrius behaved himself so seditiously and tumultuarily, that the Nicene
Fathers procured a temporary Decree for his relegation, but it was soon taken
off and God left to be his Judge, who indeed did it to some purpose, when he
was trusted with it and the matter wholly left to him.

But as the Ages grew worse, so men grew more cruel and unchristian, and in
the Greek Church Atticus, and Nestorius of Constantinople, Theodosius of
Synada, and some few others who had forgotten the mercies of their great
Master, and their own duty, grew implacable and furious and impatient of
contradiction. It was a bold and an arrogant speech which Nestorius made in his
Sermon before Theodosius the younger, Da mihi, O Imperator, terram ab
haereticis repurgatam, and ego tibi vicissim coelum dabo: Disperde mecum
haereticos, and ego tecum disperdam Persas: It was as groundless and
unwarrantable, as it was bloody and inhumane.

And we see the contrary events prove truer, then this groundless and
unlearned promise; for Theodosius and Valentinian were prosperous Princes, and
have to all Ages a precious memory, and the reputation of a great piety; but
they were so far from doing what Nestorius had suggested, that they
restrained him from his violence and immanity, and Theodosius did highly
commend the good Bishop Proclus for his sweetness of deportment toward erring
persons, far above the cruelty of his Predecessor Atticus: And the experience
which Christendom has had in this last Age is Argument enough, that Toleration
of differing opinions is so far from disturbing the public peace, or
destroying the interest of Princes and Commonwealths, that it does advantage
to the public, it secures peace, because there is not so much as the pretense
of Religion left to such persons to contend for it, being already indulged to
them. When France fought against the Huguenots, the spilling of her own blood
was argument enough of the imprudence of that way of promoting Religion; but
since she has given permission to them, the world is witness how prosperous
she has been ever since: But the great instance is in the differing temper,
Government and success which Margaret of Parma, and the Duke of Alva had: The
clemency of the first had almost extinguished the flame; but when she was
removed, D' Alva succeeded and managed the matter of Religion with fire and
sword; he made the flame so great, that his Religion and his Prince too has
both been almost quite turned out of the Country. Pelli e medio sapientiam,
quoties vi res agitur, said Ennius; and therefore the best of men, and the most
glorious of Princes were always ready to give Toleration, but never to make
executions for matters disputable: Eusebius in his second Book of the life of
Constantine reports these words of the Emperor, Parem cum fidelibus ii qui
errant, pacis and quietis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant: Ipsa siquidem
communicationis and societatis restitutio ad rectam etiam veritatis viam
perducere potest. Nemo cui quam molestus sit, quisque quod animo destinat hoc
etiam faciat.

And indeed there is great reason for Princes to give Toleration to disagreeing
persons, whose opinions by fair means cannot be altered; for if the persons
be confident, they will serve God according to their persuasions; and if they
be publicly prohibited, they will privately convene, and then all those
inconveniences and mischiefs which are Arguments against the permission of
Conventicles, are Arguments for the public permissions of differing Religions,
because the denying of the public worship will certainly produce private
Conventicles, against which all wise Princes and Commonwealths have upon great
reasons made Edicts and severe Sanctions, Quic quid enim agitur absente rege,
in caput ejus plerunque redundat, say the Politics: For the face of a man is
as the face of a Lion, and scatters all base machinations which breath not but
in the dark: It is a proverbiall saying, quod nimia familiaritas servorum est
conspiratio adversus Dominum, and they who for their security run into grots
and cellars, and retirements, think that they being upon the defensive, those
Princes and those Laws that drive them to it are their Enemies, and therefore
they cannot be secure, unless the power of the one, and the obligation of the
other be lessened and rescinded; and then the being restrained and made
miserable, endeares the discontented persons mutually, and makes more hearty
and dangerous Confederations. King James of blessed memory, in his Letters to
the States of the United Provinces, dated 6 March. 1613. Thus wrote.... Magis
autem e re fore si sopiantur authoritate publica, ita ut prohibeatis Ministros
vestros ne eas disputationes in suggestum aut ad plebem ferant, ac districte
imperetis ut pacem colant se invicem Tolerando in ista opinionum ac
sententiarum discrepantia:..... Eoque justius videmur vobis hoc ipsum suadere
debere quod neutram comperimus adeo deviam ut non possint and cum fidei
Christianae veritate, and cum animarum salute consistere, etc. The like
Council in the divisions of Germany, at the first Reformation was thought
reasonable by the Emperor Ferdinand, and his excellent Son Maximilian; For
they had observed that violence did exasperate, was unblessed, unsuccessefull
and unreasonable, and therefore they made Decrees of Toleration, and appointed
tempers and expedients to be drawn up by discreet persons, and George Cassander
was designed to this great work, and did something toward it: And Emanuel
Philibert, D. of Savoy repenting of his war undertaken for Religion against
the Pedemontans, promised them Toleration, and was as good as his word: As much
is done by the Nobility of Polonia. So that the best Princes and the best
Bishops gave Toleration and Impunities; but it is known that the first
Persecutions of disagreeing persons were by the Arrians, by the Circumcellians
and Donatists, and from them, they of the Church took examples, who in small
numbers did sometime persuade it, sometime practice it. And among the Greeks it
became a public and authorized practice, till the Question of Images grew hot
and high; for then the Worshippers of Images having taken their example from
the Empress Irene, who put her Sons eyes out for making an Edict against
Images, began to be as cruel as they were deceived, especially being
encouraged by the Popes of Rome, who then blew the coals to some purpose.

And that I may upon this occasion give account of this affair in the Church
of Rome, it is remarkable that till the time of Justinian the Emperor, A. D.
525. the Catholics and Novatians had Churches indifferently permitted even in
Rome it self, but the Bishops of Rome whose interest was much concerned in it,
spoke much against it, and labored the eradication of the Novatians, and at
last when they got power into their hands they served them accordingly, but it
is observed by Socrates that when the first Persecution was made against them
at Rome by Pope Innocent I, at the same instant the Goths invaded Italy, and
became Lords of all, it being just in God to bring a Persecution upon them for
true belief, who with an incompetent Authority and insufficient grounds do
persecute an error less material, in persons agreeing with them in the
profession of the same common faith. And I have heard it observed as a blessing
upon S. Austin (who was so merciful to erring persons as the greatest part of
his life in all senses, even when he had twice changed his mind, yet to
Tolerate them, and never to endure they should be given over to the secular
power to be killed) that the very night the Vandals set down before his City of
Hippo to besiege it, he dyed and went to God, being (as a reward of his
merciful Doctrine) taken from the miseries to come, and yet that very thing
was also a particular issue of the Divine Providence upon that City, who not
long before had altered their profession into truth by force, and now were
falling into their power, who afterward by a greater force turned them to be
Arrians.

But in the Church of Rome, the Popes were the first Preachers of force and
violence in matters of opinion, and that so zealously, that Pope Vigilius
suffered himself to be imprisoned and handled roughly by the Emperor
Justinian, rather then he would consent to the restitution and peace of certain
disagreeing persons, but as yet it came not so far as death. The first that
preached that Doctrine was Dominick, the Founder of the Begging Orders of
Friars, the Friars Preachers; in memory of which the Inquisition is entrusted
only to the Friars of his Order; and if there be any force in dreams, or truth
in Legends (as there is not much in either) this very thing might be signified
by his Mothers dream, who the night before Dominick was born, dreamed she was
brought to Bed of a huge Dog with a firebrand in his mouth: Sure enough,
however his disciples expound the dream, it was a better sign that he should
prove a rabid, furious Incendiary, then any thing else; whatever he might be in
the other parts of his life, in this Doctrine he was not much better, as
appears in his deportment toward the Albigenses, against whom he so preached,
adeo quidem ut centum haereticorum millia ab octo millibus Catholicorum fusa
and interfecta fuisse perhibeantur, says one of him; and of those who were
taken, 180 were burnt to death, because they would not abjure their Doctrine:
This was the first example of putting erring persons to death, that I find in
the Roman Church; For about 170 years before, B. Bruno Berengarianes e sua
diocesi expulit, non morti aut suppliciis corporalibus tradidit.
Berengarius fell into opinion concerning the blessed Sacrament which they called
Heresy, and recanted, and relapsed, and recanted again, and fell again two or
three times, says Gerson writing against Romant of the Rose, and yet he died
sicca morte his own natural death, and with hope of Heaven, and yet Hildebrand
was once his judge, which shows that at that time Rome was not come to so
great heigths of bloodshed. In England, although the Pope had as great power
here as any where, yet there were no Executions for matter of opinion known
till the time of Henry the Fourth, who (because he Usurped the Crown) was
willing by all means to endeare the Clergy by destroying their Enemies, that so
he might be sure of them to all his purposes. And indeed, it may become them
well enough, who are wiser in their generations then the children of light, it
may possibly serve the policies of evil persons, but never the pure and
chaste designs of Christianity, which admits no blood but Christ's, and the
imitating blood of Martyrs, but knows nothing how to serve her ends, by
persecuting any of her erring children.

By this time I hope it will not be thought reasonable to say, he that teaches
mercy to erring persons, teaches indifferency in Religion, unless so many
Fathers, and so many Churches, and the best of Emperors, and all the world
(till they were abused by Tyranny, Popery, and Faction) did teach indifferency,
for I have shown that Christianity does not punish corporally, persons erring
spiritually, but indeed Popery does; The Donatists, and Circumcellians, and
Arrians, and the Itaciani, they of old did: In the middle Ages, the Patrons of
Images did, and the Papists at this day do, and have done ever since they were
taught it by their S. Dominick.

Seventhly, And yet after all this, I have something more to exempt my self
from the clamor of this Objection: For let all errors be as much and as
zealously suppressed as may be, (the Doctrine of the following Discourse
contradicts not that) but let it be done by such means as are proper
instruments of their suppression, by Preaching and Disputation (so that neither
of them breed disturbance) by charity and sweetness, by holiness of life,
assiduity of exhortation, by the word of God and prayer.

For these ways are most natural, most prudent, most peaceable, and
effectual. Only let not men be hasty in calling every disliked opinion by the
name of Heresy, and when they have resolved, that they will call it so, let
them use the erring person like a brother, not beat him like a dog, or convince
him with a gibbet, or vex him out of his understanding and persuasions.

And now if men will still say, I persuade to indifferency, there is no help
for me, for I have given reasons against it, I must bear it as well as I can,
I am not yet without remedy as they are, for patience will help me, and reason
will not cure them, let them take their course, and He take mine:

Only I will take leave to consider this (and they would do well to do so
too) that unless Faith be kept within its own latitude, and not called out to
patrocinate every less necessary opinion, and the interest of every Sect, or
peevish person; and if damnation be pronounced against Christians believing the
Creed, and living good lives, because they are deceived, or are said to be
deceived in some opinions less necessary, there is no way in the world to
satisfy unlearned persons in the choice of their Religion, or to appease the
unquietness of a scrupulous conscience: For suppose an honest Citizen whose
employment and parts will not enable him to judge the disputes and arguings of
great Clerks, sees factions commenced and managed with much bitterness by
persons who might on either hand be fit enough to guide him; when if he follows
either, he is disquieted and pronounced damned by the other (who also if he be
the most unreasonable in his opinion will perhaps be more furious in his
sentence) what shall this man do, where shall he rest the sole of his foot?
Upon the Doctrine of the Church where he lives? Well! but that he hears
declaimed against perpetually, and other Churches claim highly and pretend
fairly for truth, and condemn his Church: If I tell him that he must live a
good life, and believe the Creed, and not trouble himself with their disputes,
or interesting himself in Sects and Factions, I speak reason: Because no law
of God ties him to believe more then what is of essential necessity, and
whatsoever he shall come to know to be revealed by God: Now if he believes his
Creed, he believes all that is necessary to all, or of it self, and if he do
his moral endeavor beside, he can do no more toward finding out all the
rest, and then he is secured; but then if this will secure him, why do men
press further and pretend every opinion as necessary, and that in so high
degree that if they all said true, or any two indeed of them, in 500 Sects
which are in the world (and for ought I know there may be 5000) it is 500 to
one but that every man is damned, for every Sect damnes all but it self, and
that is damned of 499, and it is excellent fortune then if that escape; and
there is the same reason in every one of them, that is, it is extreme
unreasonablenesse in all of them to pronounce damnation against such persons
against whom clearly and dogmatically holy Scripture has not; In odiosis quod
minimum est sequimur, in favoribus quod est maximum, says the Law, and
therefore we should say any thing, or make any excuse that is in any degree
reasonable, rather then condemn all the world to Hell, especially if we
consider these two things, that we our selves are as apt to be deceived as any
are, and that they who are deceived, when they used their moral industry that
they might not be deceived, if they perish for this, they perish for what they
could not help.

But however, if the best security in the world be not in neglecting all Sects,
and subdivisions of men, and fixing our selves on points necessary and plain,
and on honest and pious endeavors, according to our several capacities and
opportunities for all the rest, if I say all this be not through the mercies of
God, the best security to all unlearned persons, and learned too, where shall
we fix, where shall we either have peace or security? If you bid me follow your
Doctrine, you must tell me why, and perhaps when you have I am not able to
judge, or if I be as able as other people are, yet when I have judged, I may be
deceived too, and so may you, or any man else you bid me follow, so that I am
no whit the nearer truth or peace.

And then if we look abroad, and consider how there is scarce any Church, but
is highly charged by many Adversaries in many things, possibly we may see a
reason to charge every one of them in some things; And what shall we do then?
The Church of Rome has spots enough, and all the world is inquisitive enough
to find out more, and to represent these to her greatest disadvantage. The
Greek Church denies the procession of the holy Ghost from the Son; If that be
false Doctrine, she is highly too blame, if it be not, then all the Western
Churches are too blame for saying the contrary: And there is no Church that is
in prosperity, but alters her Doctrine every Age, either by bringing in new
Doctrines, or by contradicting her old, which shows that none are satisfied
with themselves, or with their own confessions: And since all Churches believe
themselves fallible, that only excepted which all other Churches say is most of
all deceived, it were strange if in so many Articles which make up their
several bodies of Confessions, they had not mistaken every one of them in
something or other: The Lutheran Churches maintain Consubstantiation, the
Zuinglians are Sacramentaries, the Calvinists are fierce in the matters of
absolute Predetermination, and all these reject Episcopacy, which the Primitive
Church would have made no doubt to have called Heresy: The Socinians profess a
portentous number of strange opinions; they deny the holy Trinity, and the
satisfaction of our blessed Savior: The Anabaptists laugh at Paedo-baptism;
The Ethiopian Churches are Nestorian: where then shall we fix our confidence,
or join Communion? to pitch upon any one of these is to throw the dice, if
salvation be to be had only in one of them, and that every error that by
chance has made a Sect, and is distinguished by a name, be damnable.

If this consideration does not deceive me, we have no other help in the midst
of these distractions, and dis-unions, but all of us to be united in that
common term, which as it does constitute the Church in its being such, so it
is the medium of the Communion of Saints, and that is the Creed of the
Apostles, and in all other things an honest endeavor to find out Clem. Alex.
stromat. 1. ait Philosophiam liberam esse praestantissimam, quae scil. versatur
in perspicaciter seligendis dogmatis omnium Sectarum, Polamo Alexandrinus sic
primus philosophatus est, ut ait Laertius in Proemio, unde cognominatus est,
(...).
what truths we can, and a charitable and mutual permission to others that
disagree from us and our opinions. I am sure this may satisfy us, for it will
secure us, but I know not any thing else that will, and no man can be
reasonably persuaded, or satisfied in any thing else, unless he throws
himself upon chance, or absolute predestination, or his own confidence, in
every one of which it is two to one at least but he may miscarry.

Thus far I thought I had reason on my side, and I suppose I have made it
good upon its proper grounds, in the pages following. But then if the result
be, that men must be permitted in their opinions, and that Christians must not
Persecute Christians; I have also as much reason to reprove all those oblique
Arts which are not direct Persecutions of men's persons, but they are indirect
proceedings, ungentle and unchristian, servants of faction and interest,
provocations to zeal and animosities, and destructive of learning and
ingenuity. And these are suppressing all the monuments of their Adversaries,
forcing them to recant, and burning their Books.

For it is a strange industry, and an importune diligence that was used by our
forefathers; of all those Heresies which gave them battle and employment, we
have absolutely no Record or Monument, but what themselves who were Adversaries
have transmitted to us, and we know that Adversaries, especially such who
observed all opportunities to discredit both the persons and doctrines of the
Enemy, are not always the best records or witnesses of such transactions. We
see it now in this very Age, in the present distemperatures, that parties are
no good Registers of the actions of the adverse side: And if we cannot be
confident of the truth of a story now, now I say that it is possible for any
man, and likely that the interessed adversary will discover the imposture, it
is far more unlikely, that after Ages should know any other truth, but such
as serves the ends of the representers: I am sure such things were never taught
us by Christ and his Apostles, and if we were sure that our selves spoke truth,
or that truth were able to justify her self, it were better if to preserve a
Doctrine we did not destroy a Commandment, and out of zeal pretending to
Christian Religion, loose the glories and rewards of ingenuity and Christian
simplicity.

Of the same consideration is mending of Authors, not to their own mind but to
ours, that is, to mend them so as to spoil them; forbidding the publication of
Books, in which there is nothing impious, or against the public interest,
leaving out clauses in Translations, disgracing men's persons, charging
disavowed Doctrins upon men, and the persons of the men with the consequents of
their Doctrine, which they deny either to be true or to be consequent, false
reporting of Disputations and Conferences, burning Books by the hand of the
hangman, and all such Arts, which show that we either distrust God for the
maintenance of his truth, or that we distrust the cause, or distrust our selves
and our abilities: I will say no more of these, but only concerning the last, I
shall transcribe a passage out of Tacitus in the life of Julius Agricola, who
gives this account of it, Veniam non petissem nisi incursaturus tam saeva and
infesta virtutibus tempora. Legimus cum Aruleno Ruslico Paetus Thrasea,
Herennio Senecioni Priscus Helvidius laudatt essent, capitale fuisse, neque in
ipsos modo authors, sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum delegato Triumviris
ministerio ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro urerentur,
scil. illo igne vocem populi Romans and libertatem Senatus and conscientiam
generis humani aboleri arbitrabantur, expulsis insuper sapientiae
professoribus, at que omni bona art in exilium acta, ne quid usquam honestum
occurreret. It is but an illiterate Policy to think that such indirect and
uningenuous proceedings can amongst wise and freemen disgrace the Authors, and
disrepute their Discourses; And I have seen that the price has been trebled
upon a forbidden or a condemned Book, and some men in policy have got a
prohibition that their impression might be the more certainly vendible, and the
Author himself thought considerable.

The best way is to leave tricks and devices, and to fall upon that way which
the best Ages of the Church did use: With the strength of Argument, and
Allegations of Scripture, and modesty of deportment, and meekness, and charity
to the persons of men, they converted misbelievers, stopped the mouths of
Adversaries, asserted truth, and discountenanced error; and those other
stratagems and Arts of support and maintenance to Doctrines, were the issues of
heretical brains; the old Catholics had nothing to secure themselves but the
(...) of truth and plain dealing.

And to my understanding, it is a plain Art and design of the Devil, to make
us so in love with our own opinions, as to call them Faith and Religion, that
we may be proud in our understanding; and besides, that by our zeal in our
opinions, we grow cool in our piety and practical duties, he also by this
earnest contention. does directly destroy good life, by engagement of Zealots
to do any thing rather then be overcome, and loose their beloved propositions:
But I would feign know why is not any vicious habit as bad or worse then a
false opinion? Why are we so zealous against those we call Heretics, and yet
great friends with drunkards, and fornicators, and swearers, and intemperate
and idle persons? Is it because we are commanded by the Apostle to reject a
Heretic after two admonitions, and not to bid such a one God speed? It is a
good reason why we should be zealous against such persons, provided we mistake
them not. For those of whom these Apostles speak, are such as deny Christ to be
come in the flesh, such as deny an Article of Creed; and in such odious things,
it is not safe nor charitable to extend the gravamen and punishment beyond the
instances the Apostles make, or their exact parallels. But then also, it would
be remembered that the Apostles speak as fiercely against communion with
fornicators, and all disorders practical, as against communion with Heretics,
If any man that is called a brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an
Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one no not
to eat: I am certain that a Drunkard is as contrary to God, and lives as
contrary to the Laws of Christianity, as a Heretic; and I am also sure that I
know what drunkenness is, but I am not sure that such an opinion is Heresy,
neither would other men be so sure as they think for if they did consider it
aright, and observe the infinite deceptions, and causes of deceptions in wise
men, and in most things, and in all doubtful Questions, and that they did not
mistake confidence for certainty.

But indeed, I could not but smile at those jolly Friars, two Franciscans
offered themselves to the fire to prove Savonarola to be a Heretic, but a
certain Iacobine offered himself to Commin. l. 8. c. 19.
the fire to prove that Savonarola had true Revelations, and was no Heretic;
in the mean time Savonarola preached, but made no such confident offer, not
durst he venture at that new kind of fire Ordeal; and put case all four had
past through the fire, and dyed in the flames, what would that have proved? Had
he been a Heretic or no Heretic, the more or the less, for the confidence of
these Zealous Idiots? If we mark it, a great many Arguments whereon many Sects
rely, are no better probation then this comes to. Confidence is the first, and
the second, and the third part of a very great many of their propositions.

But now if men would a little turn the Tables, and be as zealous for a good
life, and all the strictest precepts of Christianity (which is a Religion the
most holy, the most reasonable, and the most consummate that ever was taught to
man) as they are for such propositions in which neither the life, nor the
ornament of Christianity is concerned, we should find, that as a consequent of
this piety, men would be as careful as they could, to find out all truths, and
the sense of all revelations which may concern their duty; and where men were
miserable and could not, yet others that lived good lives too would also be so
charitable, as not to add affliction to this misery; and both of them are
parts of good life, to be compassionate, and to help to bear one another
burdens, not to destroy the weak, but to entertain him meekly, that is a precept
of charity, and to endeavor to find out the whole will of God, that also is a
part of the obedience, the choice and the excellency of Faith, and he lives
not a good life, that does not do both these.

But men think they have more reason to be zealous against Heresy then against
a vice in manners, because Heresy is infectious and dangerous, and the
principle of much evil: Indeed if by a Heresy we mean that which is against an
Article of Creed, and breaks part of the Covenant made between God and man by
the mediation of Jesus Christ, I grant it to be a very grievous crime, a
calling Gods veracity into question, and a destruction also of good life,
because upon the Articles of Creed, obedience is built, and it lives or dies,
as the effect does by its proper cause; for Faith is the moral cause of
obedience: But then Heresy, that is, such as this, is also a vice, and the
person criminal, and so the sin is to be esteemed in its degrees of malignity,
and let men be as zealous against it as they can, and employ the whole arsenall
of the spiritual armor against it, such as this, is worse then adultery or
murder, in as much as the soul is more noble then the body, and a false
doctrine is of greater dissemination and extent then a single act of violence
or impurity. Adultery or murder is a duel, but Heresy (truly and indeed such)
is an unlawful war, it slayes thousands: The loosing of Faith is like
digging down a foundation; all the superstructures of hope, and patience, and
charity fall with it: And besides this, Heresy of all crimes is the most
inexcusable and of least temptation; for true faith is most commonly kept with
the least trouble of any grace in the world; and Heresy of it self has not
only no pleasure in it, but is a very punishment; because faith as it opposes
heretical or false opinions, and distinguishes from charity, consists in meare
acts of believing, which because they are of true propositions, are natural
and proportionable to the understanding, and more honorable then false. But
then concerning those things which men now adays call Heresy, they cannot be
so formidable as they are represented, and if we consider that drunkenness is
certainly a damnable sin, and that there are more Drunkards then Heretics, and
that drunkenness is parent of a thousand vices, it may better be said of this
vice then of most of those opinions which we call Heresies, it is infectious
and dangerous, and the principle of much evil, and therefore as fit an object
for a pious zeal to contest against, as is any of those opinions which trouble
men's ease or reputation, for that is the greatest of their malignity.

But if we consider that Sects are made and opinions are called Heresies upon
interest, and the grounds of emolument, we shall see that a good life would
cure much of this mischief. For first, the Church of Rome which is the great
dictatrix of dogmaticall resolutions, and the declarer of Heresy, and calls
Heretic more then all the world besides, has made that the rule of Heresy,
which is the conservatory of interest, and the ends of men. For to recede from
the Doctrine of the Church, with them makes Heresy, that is, to disrepute their
Authority and not to obey them, not to be their subjects, not to give them the
Empire of our conscience, is the great (...) of Heresy.

So that with them, Heresy is to be esteemed clearly by humane ends, not by
Divine Rules; that is formal Heresy which does materially disserve them, and
it would make a suspicious man a little inquisitive into their particular
Doctrins, and when he finds that Indulgences, and Jubilies, and Purgatories,
and Masses, and Offices for the dead, are very profitable; that the Doctrine of
primacy, of infallibility, of superiority over Councels, of indirect power in
temporals, are great instruments of secular honor; would be apt enough to
think that if the Church of Rome would learn to lay her honor at the feet of
the Crucifix, and despise the world, and prefer Jerusalem before Rome, and
Heaven above the Lateran, that these opinions would not have in them any native
strength to support them, against the perpetual assaults of their Adversaries,
that speak so much reason and Scripture against them. I have instanced in the
Roman Religion, but I wish it may be considered also how far men's Doctrines
in other Sects serve men's temporal ends, so far that it would not be
unreasonable or unnecessary to attempt to cure some of their distemperatures or
misperswasions by the salutary precepts of sanctity and holy life: Sure enough,
if it did not more concern their reputation and their lasting interest to be
counted true believers rather then good livers, they would rather endeavor to
live well, then to be accounted of a right opinion in things beside the Creed.

For my own particular I cannot but expect, that God in his Justice should
enlarge the bounds of the Turkish Empire, or some other way punish Christians
by reason of their pertinacious disputing about things unnecessary,
undeterminable, and unprofitable, and for their hating and persecuting their
brethren which should be as dear to them as their own lives, for not consenting
to one another follies, and senseless vanities: How many volumnes have been
writ about Angels, about immaculate conception, about original sin, when that
all that is solid reason or clear Revelation, in all these three Articles, may
be reasonably enough comprised in forty lines! And in these trifles and
impertinencies, men are curiously busy while they neglect those glorious
precepts of Christianity and holy life, which are the glories of our Religion,
and would enable us to a happy eternity.

My Lord, Thus far my thoughts have carried me, and then I thought I had
reason to go further, and to examine the proper grounds upon which these
persuasions might rely and stand firm, in case any body should contest against
them: For possibly men may be angry at me and my design; for I do all them
great displeasure, who think no end is then well served, when their interest is
disserved; and but that I have writ so untowardly and heavily, that I am not
worth a confutation, possibly some or other might be writing against me. But
then I must tell them I am prepared of an answer before hand: For I think I
have spoken reason in my Book, and examined it with all the severity I have,
and if after all this I be deceived, this confirms me in my first opinion, and
becomes a new Argument to me, that I have spoken reason; for it furnishes me
with a new instance, that it is necessary, there should be a mutual
compliance and Toleration, because even then when a man thinks he has most
reason to be confident, he may easily be deceived.

For I am sure, I have no other design but the prosecution and advantage of
truth, and I may truly use the words of Gregory Nazianzen, Non studemus paci in
detrimentum verae doctrinae,.... ut facilitatis and mansuetudinis famam
colligamus: But I have writ this because I thought it was necessary and
seasonable, and charitable, and agreeable to the great precepts and design of
Christianity, consonant to the practice of the Apostles, and of the best Ages
of the Church, most agreeable to Scripture and reason, to revelation and the
nature of the thing; and it is such a Doctrine, that if there be variety in
humane affairs, if the event of things be not settled in a durable
consistence, but is changeable, every one of us all may have need of it: I
shall only therefore desire that they who will read it may come to the reading
it with as much simplicity of purposes and unmixed desires of truth, as I did
to the writing it, and that no man trouble himself with me or my discourse,
that thinks before hand that his opinion cannot be reasonably altered. If he
thinks me to be mistaken before he tries, let him also think that he may be
mistaken too, and that he who judges before he hears, is mistaken though he
gives a right sentence:

(...), Aristoph. in Pluto.
Was as good counsel: But at a venture, I shall leave this sentence of Solomon
to his consideration, A wise man fears, and departs from evil, but a fool
rages and is confident, (...), is a trick of boys and bold young fellows,
says Aristotle; but they who either know themselves, or things, or persons,
(...). Peradventure yea, peradventure no, is very often the wisest
determination of a Question: For there are (...) (as the Apostle notes) 2 Timothy
2.
foolish and unlearned Questions, and it were better to stop the current of
such fopperies by silence, then by disputing them convey them to Posterity. And
many things there are of more profit which yet are of no more certainty, and
therefore boldness of assertion (except it be in matters of Faith and clearest
Revelation) is an Argument of the vanity of the man, never of the truth of the
proposition; for to such matters the saying of Xenophanes in Varro, is
pertinent and applicable, Hominis est haec opinari, Dei scire; God only knows
them, and we conjecture.

(...). And although I be as desirous to know what I should, and what I should
not, as any of my Brethren the Sons of Adam; yet I find that the more I search,
the further I am from being satisfied, and make but few discoveries, save of my
own ignorance, and therefore I am desirous to follow the example of a very wise
Personage, Julius Agricola, of whom Tacitus gave this testimony, Retinuit que
(quod est difficillimum) ex scientia modum; or that I may take my precedent
from within the pale of the Church, it was the saying of S. Austin, Mallem
quidem eorum quae a me quaesivisti habere scientiam quam ignorantiam, sed quia
id nondum potui, magis eligo cautam ignorantiam confiteri, quam falsam
scientiam profiteri; And these words do very much express my sense. But if
there be any man so confident as Luther sometimes was, who said that he could
expound all Scripture, or so vain as Eckius who in his Chrysopassus ventured
upon the highest and most mysterious Question of Predestination, ut in ea
juveniles possit calores exercere; such persons as these, or any that is
furious in his opinion, will scorn me and my Discourse; but I shall not be
much moved at it, only I shall wish that I had as much knowledge as they think
me to want, and they as much as they believe themselves to have. In the mean
time, Modesty were better for us both, and indeed for all men: For when men
indeed are knowing, amongst other things they are able to separate certainties
from uncertainties; If they be not knowing, it is pity that their ignorance
should be triumphant, or discompose the public peace, or private confidence.

And now (my Lord) that I have inscribed this Book to your Lordship, although
it be a design of doing honor to my self, that I have marked it with so
honored and beloved a Name, might possibly need as much excuse as it does
pardon, but that your Lordship knows your own; for out of your Mines. I have
dug the Mineral; only I have stamped it with my own image, as you may
perceive by the deformities which are in it. But your great Name in letters
will add so much value to it, as to make it obtain its pardon amongst all
them that know how to value you, and all your relatives and dependants by the
proportion of relation. For others I shall be incurious, because the number of
them that honor you is the same with them that honor Learning and Piety, and
they are the best Theater and the best judges; amongst which the world must
needs take notice of my ambition, to be ascribed by my public pretense to be
what I am in all heartinesse of Devotion, and for all the reason of the world,

My Honored Lord, Your Lordships most faithful and most affectionate servant,
J. TAILOR.

(...). OF THE LIBERTY OF PROPHESYING.
THe infinite variety of Opinions in matters of Religion, as they have troubled
Christendom, with interests, factions, and partialities; so have they caused
great divisions of the heart, and variety of thoughts and designs amongst
pious and prudent men. For they all seeing the inconveniences which the
disunion of persuasions and Opinions have produced directly or accidentally,
have thought themselves obliged to stop this inundation of mischiefs, and have
made attempts accordingly. But it has happened to most of them as to a mistaken
Physician, who gives excellent physic but mis-applies it, and so misses of his
cure; so have these men, their attempts have therefore been ineffectuall; for
they put their help to a wrong part, or they have endeavored to cure the
symptoms, and have let the disease alone till it seemed incurable. Some have
endeavored to reunite these fractions by propounding such a Guide which they
were all bound to follow; hoping that the Unity of a Guide, would have
persuaded unity of minds; but who this Guide should be at last became such a
Question, that it was made part of the fire that was to be quenched; so far
was it from extinguishing any part of the flame. Others thought of a Rule, and
this must be the means of Union, or nothing could do it. But supposing all
the World had been agreed of this Rule, yet the interpretation of it was so
full of variety, that this also became part of the disease, for which the cure
was pretended. All men resolved upon this, that though they yet had not hit
upon the right, yet some way must be thought upon to reconcile differences in
Opinion, thinking so long as this variety should last, Christ's Kingdom was
not advanced, and the work of the Gospel went on but slowly: Few men in the
mean time considered, that so long as men had such variety of principles, such
several constitutions, educations, tempers, and distempers, hopes, interests
and weaknesses, degrees of light, and degrees of understanding, it was
impossible all should be of one mind. And what is impossible to be done, is
not necessary it should be done: And therefore, although variety of Opinions
was impossible to be cured (and they who attempted it, did like him who claps
his shoulder to the ground to stop an earthquake) yet the inconveniences
arising from it might possibly be cured, not by uniting their beliefes, that
was to be dispaird of, but by curing that which caused these mischiefs, and
accidental inconveniences of their disagreeings. For although these
inconveniences which every man sees and feels were consequent to this
diversity of persuasions, yet it was but accidentally and by chance, in as much
as we see that in many things, and they of great concernment, men allow to
themselves and to each other a liberty of disagreeing, and no hurt neither. And
certainly if diversity of Opinions, were of it self the cause of mischiefs
it would be so ever, that is, regularly and universally (but that we see it is
not:) For there are disputes in Christendom concerning matters of greater
concernment then most of those Opinions that distinguish Sects, and make
factions; and yet because men are permitted to differ in those great matters,
such evils are not consequent to such differences, as are to the uncharitable
managing of smaller and more inconsiderable Questions. It is of greater
consequence to believe right in the Question of the validity or invalidity of a
deathbed repentance, then to believe aright in the Question of Purgatory; and
the consequences of the Doctrine of Predetermination, are of deeper and more
material consideration then the products of the belief of the lawfulness or
unlawfulness of private Masses; and yet these great concernments where a
liberty of Prophesying in these Questions has been permitted, has made no
distinct Communion, no sects of Christians, and the others have, and so have
these too in those places where they have peremptorily been determind on either
side. Since then if men are quiet and charitable in some dis-agreeings, that
then and there the inconvenience ceases, if they were so in all others where
lawfully they might (and they may in most,) Christendom should be no longer
rent in pieces, but would be redintegrated in a new Pentecost, and although the
Spirit of God did rest upon us in divided tongues, yet so long as those tongues
were of fire not to kindle strife, but to warm our affections, and inflame our
charities, we should find that this variety of Opinions in several persons
would be looked upon as an argument only of diversity of operations, while the
Spirit is the same; and that another man believes not so well as I, is only an
argument that I have a better and a clearer illumination than he, that I have a
better gift than he, received a special grace and favor, and excel him in
this, and am perhaps excelled by him in many more. And if we all impartially
endeavor to find a truth, since this endeavor and search only is in our
power, that we shall find it being ab extra, a gift and an assistance
extrinsecall, I can see no reason why this pious endeavor to find out truth
shall not be of more force to unite us in the bonds of charity, then his misery
in missing it shall be to dis-unite us. So that since a union of persuasion is
impossible to be attained, if we would attempt the cure by such remedies as are
apt to enkindle and increase charity, I am confident we might see a blessed
peace would be the reward and crown of such endeavors.

But men are now adays and indeed always have been, since the expiration of
the first blessed Ages of Christianity, so in love with their own Fancies and
Opinions, as to think Faith and all Christendom is concernd in their support
and maintenance, and whoever is not so fond and does not dandle them like
themselves, it grows up to a quarrel, which because it is in materia
theologiae is made a quarrel in Religion, and God is entitled to it; and then
if you are once thought an enemy to God, it is our duty to persecute you even
to death, we do God good service in it; when if we should examine the matter
rightly, the Question is either in materia non revelata, or minus evidenti, or
non necessaria, either it is not revealed, or not so clearly, but that wise
and honest men may be of different minds, or else it is not of the foundation
of faith, but a remote super-structure, or else of mere speculation, or
perhaps when all comes to all, it is a false Opinion, or a matter of humane
interest, that we have so zealously contended for; for to one of these heads
most of the Disputes of Christendom may be reduced; so that I believe the
present fractions (or the most) are from the same cause which St Paul observed
in the Corinthian Schism, when there are divisions among you, are ye not
carnal? It is not the differing Opinions that is the cause of the present
ruptures, but want of charity; it is not the variety of understandings, but the
disunion of wills and affections; it is not the several principles, but the
several ends that cause our miseries: our Opinions commence, and are upheld
according as our turns are served and our interests are preserved, and there is
no cure for us, but Piety and Charity. A holy life will make our belief holy,
if we consult not humanity and its imperfections in the choice of our Religion,
but search for truth without designs, save only of acquiring heaven, and then
be as careful to preserve Charity, as we were to get a point of Faith; I am
much persuaded we should find out more truths by this means; or however
(which is the maine of all) we shall be secured though we miss them; and then
we are well enough.

For if it be evinced that one heaven shall hold men of several Opinions, if
the unity of Faith be not destroyed by that which men call differing Religions,
and if an unity of Charity be the duty of us all even toward persons that are
not persuaded of every proposition we believe, then I would feign know to what
purpose are all those stirs, and great noyses in Christendom; those names of
faction, the several Names of Churches not distinguished by the division of
Kingdoms, ut Ecclesia sequatur Imperium, which was the Primitive Optat. lib. 3.
Rule and Canon, but distinguished by Names of Sects and men; these are all
become instruments of hatred, thence come Schisms and parting of Communions,
and then persecutions, and then wars and Rebellion, and then the dissolutions
of all Friendships and Societies. All these mischiefs proceed not from this,
that all men are not of one mind, for that is neither necessary nor possible,
but that every Opinion is made an Article of Faith, every Article is a ground
of a quarrel, every quarrel makes a faction, every faction is zealous, and
all zeal pretends for God, and whatsoever is for God cannot be too much; we by
this time are come to that pass, we think we love not God except we hate our
Brother, and we have not the virtue of Religion, unless we persecute all
Religions but our own; for luke-warmnesse is so odious to God and Man, that we
proceeding furiously upon these mistakes, by supposing we preserve the body, we
destroy the soul of Religion, or by being zealous for faith, or which is all
one, for that which we mistake for faith, we are cold in charity, and so loose
the reward of both.

All these errors and mischiefs must be discovered and cured, and that is the
purpose of this Discourse.

SECTION I.
Of the nature of Faith, and that its duty is completed in believing the
Articles of the Apostles Creed.

FIrst then it is of great concernment to know the nature and integrity of
faith: For there begins our first and great mistake; Number 1.
for Faith although it be of great excellency, yet when it is taken for a habit
intellectual, it has so little room and so narrow a capacity, that it cannot
lodge thousands of those Opinions which pretend to be of her Family.

For although it be necessary for us to believe whatsoever we Numb. 2.
know to be revealed of God, and so every man does, that believes there is a
God: yet it is not necessary, concerning many things, to know that God has
revealed them that is, we may be ignorant of, or doubt concerning the
propositions, and indifferently maintain either part, when the Question is not
concerning Gods veracity, but whether God has said so or no: That which is of
the foundation of Faith, that only is necessary; and the knowing or not knowing
of that, the believing or dis-believing it, is that only which in genere
credendorum, is in immediate and necessary order to salvation or damnation.

Now all the reason and demonstration of the world convinces Numb. 3.
us, that this foundation of Faith, or the great adequate object of the Faith
that saves us, is that great mysteriousnesse of Christianity which Christ
taught with so much diligence, for the credibility of which he wrought so many
miracles; for the testimony of which the Apostles endured persecutions; that
which was a folly to the Gentiles, and a scandal to the Jews, this is that
which is the object of a Christians Faith: All other things are implicitly in
the belief of the Articles of Gods veracity, and are not necessary in respect
of the Constitution of faith to be drawn out, but may there lie in the bowels
of the great Articles without danger to any thing or any person, unless some
other accident or circumstance makes them necessary: Now the great object which
I speak of, is Jesus Christ crucified; Constitui enim apud vos nihil scire
praeter Jesum Christum and hunc crucifixum; so said S. Paul to the Church of
Corinth: This is the Article upon the Confession of which Christ built his
Church, viz. only upon S. Peter's Creed, which was no more but this simple
enunciation, We believe and are sure that thou Mat. 16. 19.
art Christ, the Son of the living God: And to this salvation particularly is
promised, as in the case of Martha's Creed, Ioh. 11. 27. To this the Scripture
gives the greatest Testimony, and to all them that confess it; For every
spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And
who ever 1 Ioh. 4. 2, 15.
confesses that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he
in God: The believing this Article is the end of writing the four Gospels: For
all these things are written, that Ioh. 20. 31.
ye might believe, that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and then that
this is sufficient follows, and that believing, viz. this Article (for this
was only instanced in) ye might have life through his name: This is that great
Article which in genere credendorum, is sufficient disposition to prepare a
Catechumen to Baptism, as appears in the case of the Ethiopian Eunuch, whose
Creed was only this, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and upon
this Confession (says the story) they both went into the water, and the Ethiop
was washed and became as white as snow.

In these particular instances, there is no variety of Articles, save only that
in the annexes of the several expressions, such Numb. 4.
things are expressed, as besides that Christ is come, they tell from whence,
and to what purpose: And whatsoever is expressed, or is to these purposes
employed, is made articulate and explicate, in the short and admirable
mysterious Creed of S. Paul, Romans 10. 8. This is the word of faith which we
preach, that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall
believe in thine heart, that God has raised him from the dead, thou shall be
saved: This is the great and entire complexion of a Christian's faith, and
since salvation is promised to the belief of this Creed, either a snare is
laid for us, with a purpose to deceive us, or else nothing is of prime and
original necessity to be believed, but this, Jesus Christ our Redeemer; and
all that which is the necessary parts, means, or maine actions of working this
redemption for us, and the honor for him is in the bowels and fold of the
great Article, and claims an explicit belief by the same reason that binds us
to the belief of its first complexion, without which neither the thing could be
acted, nor the proposition understood.

For the act of believing propositions, is not for it self, Numb. 5.
but in order to certain ends; as Sermons are to good life and obedience; for
(excepting that it acknowledges, Gods veracity, and so is a direct act of
Religion) believing a revealed proposition, has no excellency in it self, but
in order to that end for which we are instructed in such revelations. Now Gods
great purpose being to bring us to him by Jesus Christ, Christ is our medium to
God, obedience is the medium to Christ, and Faith the medium to obedience, and
therefore is to have its estimate in proportion to its proper end, and those
things are necessary, which necessarily promote the end, without which
obedience cannot be encouraged or prudently enjoined: So that those Articles
are necessary, that is, those are fundamental points, upon which we build our
obedience; and as the influence of the Article is to the persuasion or
engagement of obedience, so they have their degrees of necessity. Now all that
Christ, when he preached, taught us to believe, and all that the Apostles in
their Sermons propound, all aim at this, that we should acknowledge Christ
for our Lawgiver and our Savior; so that nothing can be necessary by a prime
necessity to be believed explicitly, but such things which are therefore parts
of the great Article, because they either encourage our services, or oblige
them, such as declare Christ's greatness in himself, or his goodness to us:
So that although we must neither deny nor doubt of any thing, which we know our
great Master has taught us: yet salvation is in special and by name annexed
to the belief of those Articles only, which have in them the indearements of
our services, or the support of our confidence, or the satisfaction of our
hopes, such as are; Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Crucifixion
and Resurrection of Jesus, forgiveness of sins by his blood, Resurrection of
the dead, and life eternal, because these propositions qualify Christ for our
Savior and our Lawgiver, the one to engage our services, the other to endeare
them; for so much is necessary as will make us to be his servants, and his
Disciples; and what can be required more? This only. Salvation is promised to
the explicit belief of those Articles, and therefore those only are necessary,
and those are sufficient; but thus, to us in the formality of Christians, which
is a formality super-added to a former capacity, we before we are Christians
are reasonable creatures, and capable of a blessed eternity, and there is a
Creed which is the Gentiles Creed which is so supposed in the Christian Creed,
as it is supposed in a Christian to be a man, and that is, oportet accedentem
ad Deum credere Deum esse, and esse remuneratorem quaerentium eum.

If any man will urge farther, that whatsoever is deducible from these Articles
by necessary consequence, is necessary to be believed explicitly: I Answer. It
is true, if he sees the deduction and coherence of the parts; but it is not
certain that every man shall be able to deduce whatsoever is either
immediately, or certainly deducible from these premises; and then since
salvation is promised to the explicit belief of these, I see not how any man
can justify the making the way to heaven narrower then Jesus Christ has made
it, it being already so narrow, that there are few that find it.

In the pursuance of this great truth, the Apostles or the holy Numb. 7.
men, their Contemporaries and Disciples composed a Creed to be a Rule of Faith
to all Christians, as appears in Irenaeus, Apol. contr. Gent. c. 47. de veland.
virg, c. 1.
Tertullian, In exposit. Symbol.
S. Cyprian, Sermon. 5. de tempore, cap. 2.
S. Austin, In Symbol. apud Cyprian.
Ruffinus, and diverse Omnes orthodoxi Patres affirmant Symbolum ab ipsis
Apostolis conditum, Sext. Senensis, lib. 2. bibl. 5. vide Genebr. l. 3. de Trin.
others; which Creed unless it had contained all the entire object of Faith,
and the foundation of Religion, it cannot be imagined to what purpose it should
serve; and that it was so esteemed by the whole Church of God in all Ages,
appears in this, that since Faith is a necessary pre-disposition to Baptism in
all persons capable of the use of reason, all Catechumens in the Latin Church
coming to Baptism, were interrogated concerning their Faith, and gave
satisfaction in the recitation of this Creed. And in the East they professed
exactly the same Faith, something differing in words, but of the same matter,
reason, design, and consequence; and so they did at Jerusalem, so at Aquileia:
This was that (...). These Articles were (...). L. 5. Cod. de S. Trinit. and
fid. Cath. Cum recta. Now since the Apostles and Apostolical men and Churches
in these their Symbols, did recite particular Articles to a considerable
number, and were so minute in their recitation, as to descend to circumstances,
it is more then probable that they omitted nothing of necessity; and that these
Articles are not general principles, in the bosom of which many more Articles
equally necessary to be believed explicitly and more particular, are infolded;
but that it is as minute an explication of those prima credibilia I before
reckoned, as is necessary to salvation.

And therefore Tertullian calls the Creed regulam fidei, qua salva and forma
ejus manente in suo ordine, possit in Scriptura Numb. 8.
tractari and inquiri si quid videtur vel ambiguitate pendere vel obscuritate
obumbrari. Cordis signaculum and nostrae militiae Sacramentum, S. Ambrose calls
it, lib. 3. de velandis virgin. Comprehensio fidei nostrae atque perfectio, by
S. Austin. Sermon. 115. Confessio, expositio, regula fidei, generally by the
Ancients: The profession of this Creed, was the exposition of that saying of S.
Peter, (...), The answer of a good conscience toward God. For of the
recitation and profession of this Creed in Baptism, it is that Tertullian de
resur. carnis says, Anima non lotione, sed responsione sancitur. And of this
was the prayer of Hillary, lib. 12. de Trinit. Conserva hanc conscientiae meae
vocem ut quod in regenerationis meae Symbolo Baptizatus in Patre, Filio, Spir.
S. professus sum semper obtineam. And according to the Rule and Reason of this
Discourse (that it may appear that the Creed has in it all Articles primo and
per se, primely and universally necessary) the Creed is just such an
explication of that Faith which the Apostles preached, viz. the Creed which S.
Paul recites, as contains in it all those things which entitle Christ to us in
the capacities of our Lawgiver and our Savior, such as enable him to the
great work of redemption, according to the predictions concerning him, and such
as engage and encourage our services. For, taking out the Article of Christ's
descent into Hell (which was not in the old Creed, as appears in some of the
Copies I before referd to, in Tertullian, Ruffinus, and Irenaeus; and indeed
was omitted in all the Confessions of the Eastern Churches, in the Church of
Rome, and in the Nicene Creed, which by adoption came to be the Creed of the
Catholic Church) all other Articles are such as directly constitute the parts
and work of our redemption, such as clearly derive the honor to Christ, and
enable him with the capacities of our Savior and Lord. The rest engage our
services by proposition of such Articles which are rather promises then
propositions; and the whole Creed, take it in any of the old Forms, is but an
Analysis of that which S. Paul calls the word of salvation, whereby we shall be
saved, viz. that we confess Jesus to be Lord, and that God raised him from the
dead: by the first whereof he became our Lawgiver and our Guardian; by the
second he was our Savior: the other things are but parts and maine actions of
those two. Now what reason there is in the world that can inwrap any thing else
within the foundation, that is, in the whole body of Articles simply and
inseparably necessary, or in the prime original necessity of Faith, I cannot
possibly imagine. These do the work, and therefore nothing can upon the true
grounds of reason enlarge the necessity to the enclosure of other Articles.

Now if more were necessary than the Articles of the Creed, I demand why was it
made the Vide Isidor* de Eccles. offic. lib. 1. cap. 20. Suidan. Turnebum. lib.
2. c. 30. advers. Venant. For. in Exeg. Symb. Feuardent. in Iren. lib. 1. c. 2.
Characteristick note of a Numb. 9.
Christian from a Heretic, or a Jew, or an Infidel? or to what purpose was it
composed? Or if this was intended as sufficient, did the Apostles or those
Churches which they founded, know any thing else to be necessary? If they did
not, then either nothing more is necessary (I speak of matters of mere belief)
or they did not know all the will of the Lord, and so were unfit Dispensers of
the mysteries of the Kingdom; or if they did know more was necessary, and yet
would not insert it, they did an act of public notice, and consigned it to all
Ages of the Church to no purpose, unless to beguile credulous people by making
them believe their faith was sufficient, having tried it by that touchstone
Apostolical, when there was no such matter.

But if this was sufficient to bring men to heaven then, why not now? If the
Apostles admitted all to their Communion that Numb. 10.
believed this Creed, why shall we exclude any that preserve the same entire?
why is not our says of these Articles of as much efficacy for bringing us to
heaven, as it was in the Churches Apostolical? who had guides more infallible
that might without error have taught them superstructures enough, if they had
been necessary: and so they did; But that they did not insert them into the
Creed, when they might have done it with as much certainty, as these Articles,
makes it clear to my understanding, that other things were not necessary, but
these were; that whatever profit and advantages might come from other Articles,
yet these were sufficient, and however certain persons might accidentally be
obliged to believe much more, yet this was the one and only foundation of
Faith upon which all persons were to build their hopes of heaven; this was
therefore necessary to be taught to all, because of necessity to be believed by
all: So that although other persons might commit a delinquency in genere morum,
if they did not know or did not believe much more, because they were obliged to
further disquisitions in order to other ends, yet none of these who held the
Creed entire, could perish for want of necessary faith, though possibly he
might for supine negligence or affected ignorance, or some other fault which
had influence upon his opinions, and his understanding, he having a new
supervening obligation ex accidente to know and believe more.

Neither are we obliged to make these Articles more particular and minute then
the Creed. For since the Apostles and indeed Numb. 11.
our blessed Lord himself promised heaven to them who believd him to be the
Christ that was to come into the world, and that he who believes in him, should
be partaker of the resurrection and life eternal, he will be as good as his
word; yet because this Article was very general, and a complexion rather then
a single proposition; the Apostles and others our Fathers in Christ did make it
more explicit, and though they have said no more then what lay entire and
ready formed in the bosom of the great Article, yet they made their extracts,
to great purpose, and absolute sufficiency, and therefore there needs no more
deductions or remoter consequences from the first great Article, than the Creed
of the Apostles. For although whatsoever is certainly deduced from any of these
Articles made already so explicit, is as certainly true, and as much to be
believed as the Article it self, because ex veris possunt nil nisi vera sequi,
yet because it is not certain that our deductions from them are certain, and
what one calls evident, is so obscure to another, that he believes it false; it
is the best and only safe course to rest in that explication the Apostles have
made, because if any of these Apostolical deductions were not demonstrable
evidently to follow from that great Article to which salvation is promised, yet
the authority of them who compiled the Symboll, the plain description of the
Articles from the words of Scriptures, the evidence of reason demonstrating
these to be the whole foundation, are sufficient upon great grounds of reason
to ascertaine us; but if we go farther, besides the easiness of being
deceived, we relying upon our own discourses, (which though they may be true
and then bind us to follow them, but yet no more then when they only seem
truest,) yet they cannot make the thing certain to another, much less
necessary in it self. And since God would not bind us upon pain of sin and
punishment, to make deductions our selves* much less would he bind us to
follow another man's Logic as an Article of our Faith; I say much less
another man's; for our own integrity (for we will certainly be true to our
selves, and do our own business heartily) is as fit and proper to be employed
as another man's ability. He cannot secure me that his ability is absolute and
the greatest, but I can be more certain that my own purposes and fidelity to
my self is such. And since it is necessary to rest somewhere, lest we should
run to an infinity, it is best to rest there where the Apostles and the
Churches Apostolical rested; when not only they who are able to judge, but
others who are not, are equally ascertained of the certainty and of the
sufficiency of that explication.

This I say, not that I believe it unlawful or unsafe for the Numb. 12.
Church or any of the Antistites religionis, or any wise man to extend his own
Creed to any thing may certainly follow from any one of the Articles; but I
say, that no such deduction is fit to be pressed on others as an Article of
Faith; and that every deduction which is so made, unless it be such a thing as
is at first evident to all, is but sufficient to make a humane Faith, nor can
it amount to a divine, much less can be obligatory to bind a person of a
differing persuasion to subscribe under pain of loosing his Faith, or being a
Heretic. For it is a demonstration, that nothing can be necessary to be
believed under pain of damnation, but such propositions of which it is
certain that God has spoken and taught them to us, and of which it is
certain that this is their sense and purpose: For if the sense be uncertain,
we can no more be obliged to believe it in a certain sense, then we are to
believe it at all, if it were not certain that God delivered it. But if it be
only certain that God spoke it, and not certain to what sense, our Faith of
it is to be as indeterminate as its sense, and it can be no other in the nature
of the thing, nor is it consonant to Gods justice to believe of him that he can
or will require more. And this is of the nature of those propositions which
Aristotle calls (...), to which without any further probation, all wise men
will give assent at its first publication. And therefore deductions inevident,
from the evident and plain letter of Faith, are as great recessions from the
obligation as they are from the simplicity, and certainty of the Article. And
this I also affirm, although the Church of any one denomination, or represented
in a Council, shall make the deduction or declaration. For unless Christ had
promised his Spirit to protect every particular Church from all errors less
material, unless he had promised an absolute universal infallibility etiam
in minutioribus, unless super-structures be of the same necessity with the
foundation, and that Gods Spirit does not only preserve his Church in the being
of a Church, but in a certainty of not saying any thing that is less certain;
and that whether they will or no too; we may be bound to peace and obedience,
to silence, and to charity, but have not a new Article of Faith made; and a new
proposition though consequent (as it is said) from an Article of Faith becomes
not therefore a part of the Faith, nor of absolute necessity, Quid unquam aliud

e^isa est, nisi ut quod antea simpliciter credebatur, hoc idem postea
diligentius crederetur, said Vincentius Lirinensis, whatsoever was of necessary
belief before is so still, and has a new degree added by reason of a new
light or a clear explication; but no prositions can be adopted into the
foundation. The Church has power to intend our Faith, but not to extend it; to
make our belief more evident, but not more large and comprehensive. For Christ
and his Apostles concealed nothing that was necessary to the integrity of
Christian Faith, or salvation of our souls; Christ declared all the will of his
Father, and the Apostles were Stewards and Dispensers of the same Mysteries,
and were faithful in all the house, and therefore conceald nothing, but taught
the whole Doctrine of Christ; so they said themselves. And indeed if they did
not teach all the Doctrine of Faith, an Angel or a man might have taught us
other things then what they taught, without deserving an Anathema, but not
without deserving a blessing for making up that Faith entire which the Apostles
left imperfect. Now if they taught all the whole body of Faith, either the
Church in the following Ages lost part of the Faith (and then where was their
infallibility, and the effect of those glorious promises to which she pretends
and has certain Title; for she may as well introduce a falsehood as loose a
truth, it being as much promised to her that the Holy Ghost shall lead her into
all truth, as that she shall be preserved from all errors as appears, Ioh. 16.
13.) Or if she retaind all the Faith which Christ and his Apostles consigned
and taught, then no Age can by declaring any point, make that be an Article of
Faith which was not so in all Ages of Christianity before such declaration. And
indeed if the Vide Jacob Almain. in 3. Sent. d, 25. Q. Vnic. Dub. 3 Patet ergo,

Church by declaring an Article can make that to be necessary, which before was
not necessary, I do not see how it can stand with the charity of the Church so
to do (especially after so long experience she has had that all men will not
believe every such decision or explication) for by so doing she makes the
narrow way to heaven narrower, and chalks out one path more to the Devil then
he had before, and yet the way was broad enough when it was at the narrowest.
For before, differing persons might be saved in diversity of persuasions, and
now afterthis declaration if they cannot, there is no other alteration made,
but that some shall be damned who before even in the same dispositions and
belief should have been beatified persons. For therefore, it is well for the
Fathers of the Primitive Church that their errors were not discovered, for if
they had been contested (for that would have been called discovery enough) vel
errores emendassent, vel ab Ecclesia Bellar. de laici^ l. 3. c. 20.. ad primam
confirmationem.
ejecti fuissent. But it is better as it was, they went to heaven by that good
fortune, whereas otherwise they might have gone to the Devil. And yet there
were some errors, particularly that of S. Cyprian that was discovered, and he
went to heaven, it is thought; possibly they might so too for all this pretense.
But suppose it true, yet whether that declaration of an Article of which with
safety we either might have doubted or been ignorant, does more good, then the
damning of those many souls occasionally, but yet certainly and foreknowingly
does hurt, I leave it to all wise and good men to determine. And yet besides
this, it cannot enter into my thoughts, that it can possibly consist with Gods
goodness, to put it into the power of man so palpably and openly to alter the
paths and in-lets to heaven, and to streighten his mercies, unless he had
furnished these men with an infallible judgment and an infallible prudence,
and a never failing charity, that they should never do it but with great
necessity, and with great truth, and without ends and humane designs, of which
I think no Arguments can make us certain, what the Primitive Church has done
in this case: I shall afterward consider and give an account of it, but for
the present, there is no insecurity in ending there where the Apostles ended,
in building where they built, in resting where they left us, unless the same
infallibility which they had, had still continued, which I think I shall
hereafter make evident it did not: And therefore those extensions of Creed
which were made in the first Ages of the Church, although for the matter they
were most true; yet because it was not certain that they should be so, and they
might have been otherwise, therefore they could not be in the same order of
Faith, nor in the same degrees of necessity to be believed with the Articles
Apostolical; and therefore whether they did well or no in laying the same
weight upon them, or whether they did lay the same weight or no, we will
afterward consider.

But to return. I consider that a foundation of Faith cannot alter, unless a
new building be to be made, the foundation is Numb. 13.
the same still; and this foundation is no other but that which Christ and his
Apostles laid, which Doctrine is like himself, yesterday and to day, and the
same for ever: So that the Articles of necessary belief to all (which are the
only foundation) they cannot be several in several Ages, and to several
persons. Nay, the sentence and declaration of the Church, cannot lay this
foundation, or make any thing of the foundation, because the Church cannot lay
her own foundation; we must suppose her to be a building, and that she relies
upon the foundation, which is therefore supposed to be laid before, because she
is built upon it, or (to make it more explicate) because a cloud may arise from
the Allegory of building and foundation, it is plainly thus; The Church being a
company of men obliged to the duties of Faith and obedience, the duty and
obligation being of the faculties of will and understanding to adhere to such
an object, must pre-suppose the object made ready for them; for as the object
is before the act in order of nature, and therefore not to be produced or
increased by the faculty (which is receptive, cannot be active upon its proper
object:) So the object of the Churches Faith is in order of nature before the
Church, or before the act and habit of Faith, and therefore cannot be enlarged
by the Church, any more then the act of the visive faculty can add visibility
to the object. So that if we have found out what foundation Christ and his
Apostles did lay, that is what body and systeme of Articles simply necessary
they taught and required of us to believe, we need not, we cannot go any
further for foundation, we cannot enlarge that systeme or collection. Now then,
although all that they said is true, and nothing of it to be doubted or
dis-believed, yet as all that they said, is neither written nor delivered
(because all was not necessary) so we know that of those things which are
written, some things are as far off from the foundation as those things which
were omitted, and therefore although now accidentally they must be beliv'd by
all that know them, yet it is not necessary all should know them; and that all
should know them in the same sense and interpretation, is neither probable nor
obligatory; but therefore since these things are to be distinguished by some
differences of necessary and not necessary, whether or no is not the
declaration of Christ's and his Apostles affixing salvation to the belief of
some great comprehensive Articles, and the act of the Apostles rendering them as
explicit as they thought convenient, and consigning that Creed made so
explicit, as a tessera of a Christian, as a comprehension of the Articles of
his belief, as a sufficient disposition and an express of the Faith of a
Catechumen in order to Baptism: whether or no I say, all this be not sufficient
probation that these only are of absolute necessity, that this is sufficient
for mere belief in order to heaven, and that therefore whosoever believes
these Articles heartily and explicitly, (...), as S. John's expression is, God
dwells in him, I leave it to be considered and judged of from the premises:
Only this, if the old Doctors had been made Judges in these Questions, they
would have passed their affirmative; for to instance in one for all, of this it
was said by Tertullian, Regula quidem fidei una omnino est Lib. de veland. Virg,
sola immobilis and irreformabilis etc. Hac lege fidei manente caetera jam
disciplinae and conversationis admittunt novitatem correctionis, operante scil.
and proficiente usque in finem gratia Dei. This Symbol is the one sufficient
immovable unalterable and unchangeable rule of Faith, that admits no increment
or decrement; but if the integrity and unity of this be preserved, in all other
things men may take a liberty of enlarging their knowledges and prophesyings,
according as they are assisted by the grace of God.

SECT. II.
Of Heresy and the nature of it, and that it is to be accounted according to
the strict capacity of Christian Faith, and not in Opinions speculative, nor
ever to pious persons.

ANd thus I have represented a short draught of the Object Numb. 1.
of Faith, and its foundation; the next consideration in order to our maine
design, is to consider what was and what ought to be the judgment of the
Apostles concerning Heresy: For although there are more kinds of vices, than
there are of virtues; yet the number of them is to be taken by accounting the
transgressions of their virtues, and by the limits of Faith; we may also reckon
the Analogy and proportions of Heresy, that as we have seen who was called
faithful by the Apostolical men, we may also perceive who were listed by
them in the Catalogue of Heretics, that we in our judgments may proceed
accordingly.

And first the word Heresy is used in Scripture indifferently, in a good sense
for a Sect or Division of Opinion, and men Numb. 2.
following it, or sometimes in a bad sense, for a false Opinion signally
condemned; but these kind of people were then called Antichrists and false
Prophets more frequently then Heretics, and then there were many of them in
the world. But it is observeable that no Heresies are noted signanter in
Scripture, but such as are great errors practical in matera pietatis, such
whose doctrines taught impiety, or such who denied the coming of Christ
directly or by consequence, not remote or wiredrawn, but prime and immediate:
And therefore in the Code de S. Trinitate and fide Catholica, heresy is called
(...), a wicked Opinion and an ungodly doctrine.

The first false doctrine we find condemned by the Apostles was the opinion of
Simon Magus, who thought the Holy Ghost Numb. 3.
was to be bought with money; he thought very dishonourably to the blessed
Spirit; but yet his followers are rather noted of a vice, neither resting in
the understanding, nor derived from it, but wholly practical; It Is simony, not
heresy, though in Simon it was a false opinion proceeding from a low account of
God, and promoted by his own ends of pride and covetousness: The great heresy
that troubled them was the doctrine of the necessity of keeping the Law of
Moses, the necessity of Circumcision; against which doctrine they were therefore
zealous, because it was a direct overthrow to the very end and excellency of
Christ's coming. And this was an opinion most petinaciously and obstinately
maintained by the Jews, and had made a Sect among the Galathians, and this was
indeed wholly in opinion; and against it the Apostles opposed two Articles of
the Creed, which served at several times according as the Jews changed their
opinion, and left some degrees of their error, I believe in Jesus Christ, and I
believe the holy Catholic Church; For they therefore pressed the necessity of
Moses Law, because they were unwilling to forgo the glorious appellative of
being Gods own peculiar people; and that salvation was of the Jews, and that
the rest of the world were capable of that grace, no otherwise but by adoption
into their Religion, and becoming Proselytes: But this was so ill a doctrine,
as that it overthrew the great benefits of Christ's coming; for if they were
circumcised, Christ profited them nothing, meaning this, that Christ will not
be a Savior to them who do not acknowledge him for their Lawgiver; and they
neither confess him their Lawgiver nor their Savior, that look to be
justified by the Law of Moses, and observation of legal rites; so that this
doctrine was a direct enemy to the foundation, and therefore the Apostles were
so zealous against it. Now then that other opinion, which the Apostles met at
Jerusalem to resolve, was but a piece of that opinion; for the Jews and
Proselytes were drawn off from their lees and sediment, by degrees, step by
step. At first, they would not endure any should be saved but themselves, and
their Profelytes. Being wrought off from this height by Miracles, and preaching
of the Apostles, they admitted the Gentiles to a possibility of salvation, but
yet so as to hope for it by Moses Law. From which foolery, when they were with
much ado dissuaded, and told that salvation was by Faith in Christ, not by
works of the Law, yet they resolved to plow with an Ox and an Ass still, and
join Moses with Christ; not as shadow and substance, but in an equal
confederation, Christ should save the Gentiles if he was helped by Moses but
alone Christianity could not do it. Against this the Apostles assembled at
Jerusalem, and made a decision of the Question, tying some of the Gentiles
(such only who were blended by the Jews in communi patria) to observation of
such Rites which the Jews had derived by tradition from Noah, intending by
this to satisfy the Jews as far as might be with a reasonable compliance
and condescension; the other Gentiles who were unmixt, in the mean while,
remaining free as appears in the liberty S. Paul gave the Church of Corinth of
eating Idol Sacrifices (expressly against the Decree at Jerusalem) so it were
without scandal. And yet for all this care and curious discretion, a little of
the leaven still remained: All this they thought did so concern the Gentiles,
that it was totally impertinent to the Jews; still they had a distinction to
satisfy the letter of the Apostles Decree, and yet to persist in their old
opinion; and this so continued that fifteen Christian Bishops in succession
Eusebius. l. 4. Eccles. hist. c. 5.
were circumcised, even until the destruction of Jerusalem, under Adrian, as
Eusebius reports.

First, By the way let me observe, that never any matter of Numb. 4.
Question in the Christian Church was determined with greater solennity, or
more full authority of the Church then this Question concerning Circumcision:
No less than the whole College of the Apostles, and Elders at Jerusalem, and
that with a Decree of the highest sanction, Visum est spiritui sancto and
nobis. Secondly, Either the case of the Hebrews in particular was omitted, and
no determination concerning them, 2.
whether it were necessary or lawful for them to be circumcised, or else it
was involved in the Decree, and intended to oblige the Jews. If it was omitted
since the Question was de re necessaria (for dico vobis, I Paul say unto you,
If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing) it is very remarkable
how the Apostles to gain the Jews, and to comply with their violent projudice
in behalf of Moses Law, did for a time Tolerate their dissent etiam in re
alioquin necessaria, which I doubt not but was intended as a precedent for the
Church to imitate for ever after: But if it was not omitted, either all the
multitude of the Jews (which S. James then Act. 21. 20.
their Bishop expressed by (...); Thou see how many myriads of Jews that
believe and yet are zelots for the Law; and Eusebius speaking of Justus says,
he was one ex infinite a multitudine L. 3. 32. Eccles. Hist.
eorum qui ex circumcisione in Jesum credebant,) I say all these did perish,
and their believing in Christ served them to no other ends, but in the infinity
of their torments to upbraid them with hypocrisy and heresy; or if they were
saved, it is apparent how merciful God was and pitiful to humane infirmities,
that in a point of so great concernment did pity their weakness, and pardon
their errors, and love their good mind, since their prejudice was little less
than insuperable, and had fair probabilities, at least, it was such as might
abuse a wise and good man (and so it did many) they did bono a^im^ carrare. And
if I mistake not, this consideration S. Paul urged as a reason why God forgave
him who was a Persecutor 1. Tim. 1.
of the Saints, because he did it ignorantly in unbelief, that is, he was not
convinced in his understanding, of the truth of the way which he persecuted, he
in the mean while remaining in that incredulity not out of malice or ill ends,
but the mistakes of humanity and a pious zeal, therefore God had mercy on him:
And so it was in this great Question of circumcision, here only was the
difference, the invincibility of S. Paul's error, and the honesty of his heart
caused God so to pardon him as to bring him to the knowledge of Christ, which
God therefore did because it was necessary, necessitate medii; no salvation was
consistent with the actual remanency of that error; but in the Question of
Circumcision, although they by consequence did overthrow the end of Christ's
coming: yet because it was such a consequence, which they being hindered by a
prejudice not impious did not perceive, God tolerated them in their error till
time and a continual dropping of the lessons and dictates Apostolical did
wear it out, and then the doctrine put on it is apparel, and became clothed
with nenessity; they in the mean time so kept to the foundation, that is,
Jesus Christ crucified and risen again, that although this did make a violent
concussion of it, yet they held fast with their heart, what they ignorantly
destroyed with their tongue, (which Saul before his conversion did not) that
God upon other Titles, then an actual dereliction of their error did bring
them to salvation.

And in the descent of so many years, I find not any one Anathema past by the
Apostles or their Successors upon any Numb. 5.
of the Bishops of Jerusalem, or the Believers of the Circumcision, and yet it
was a point as clearly determined, and of as great necessity as any of those
Questions that at this day vex and crucify Christendom.

Besides this Question, and that of the Resurrection, commenced in the Church
of Corinth, and promoted with some variety Numb. 6.
of sense by Hymenaeus and Philetus in Asia, who said that the Resurrection was
past already, I do not remember any other heresy named in Scripture, but such
as were errors of impiety, seductiones in materia practica, such as was
particularly, forbidding to marry, and the heresy of the Nicolaitans, a
doctrine that taught the necessity of lust and frequent fornication.

But in all the Animadversions against errors made by the Apostles in the New
Testament, no pious person was condemned, Numb. 7.
no man that did invincibly err, or bona mente; but something that was amiss
in genere morum, was that which the Apostles did redargue. And it is very
considerable, that even they of the Circumcision who in so great numbers did
heartily believe in Christ, and yet most violently retain Circumcision, and
without Question went to Heaven in great numbers; yet of the number of these
very men, they came deeply under censure, when to their error they added
impiety: So long as it stood with charity and without humane ends and secular
interests, so long it was either innocent or connived at; but when they grew
covetous, and for filthy lucres sake taught the same doctrine which others did
in the simplicity of their hearts, then they turned Heretics, then they were
termed Seducers; and Titus was commanded to look to them, and to silence them;
For there are many that are intractable and vain bablers, Seducers of minds,
especially they of the Circumcision, who seduce whole houses, teaching things
that they ought not, for filthy lucres sake. These indeed were not to be
endured, but to be silenced, by the conviction of sound doctrine, and to be
rebuked sharply, and avoided.

For heresy is not an error of the understanding, but an error Numb. 8.
of the will. And this is clearly insinuated in Scripture, in the style whereof
Faith and a good life are made one duty, and vice is called opposite to Faith,
and heresy opposed to holiness and sanctity. So in S. Paul, For (says he) the
end of 1 Timothy 1.
the Commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and
faith unfeigned; a quibus quod aberrarunt quidam, from which charity, and
purity, and goodness, and sincerity, because some have wandered, deflexerunt ad
vaniloquium. And immediately after, he reckons the oppositions to faith and
sound doctrine, and instances only in vices that stain the lives of
Christians, the unjust, the unclean, the uncharitable, the liar, the perjured
person, and si quis alius qui sanae doctrinae adversatur; these are the enemies
of the true doctrine. And therefore S. Peter having given in charge, to add to
our virtue, patience, temperance, charity, and the like; gives this for a
reason, for if these things be in you and abound, ye shall be fruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. So that knowledge and faith is inter
praecepta morum, is part of a good life: Quid igitur credulitas vel fides?
opinor fideliter hominem Christo credere, id est, fidelem Deo esse, hoc est,
fideliter Dei mandata servare. So Salvian.
And Saint Paul calls Faith or the form of sound words, (...), the doctrine
that is according to godliness, 1 Timothy 6. 3. (...); That Is our Religion, or
Faith, the whole manner of serving God, C. de summa Trinit. and fide Cathol.
And veritati credere, and in injustitia sibi complacere, are by the same
Apostle opposed, and intimate, that piety and faith is all one thing; faith
must be (...), entire and holy too, or it is not right. It was the heresy of
the Gnostics, that it was no matter how men lived, so they did but believe
aright: Which wicked doctrine Tatianus a learned Christian did so detest, that
he fell into a quite contrary, Non est curandum quid quisque credat, id tantum
curandum est quod quisque faciat; And thence came the Sect Excratites: Both
these heresies sprang from the too nice distinguishing the faith from the piety
and good life of a Christian: They are both but one duty. However, they may be
distinguished, if we speak like Philosophers; they cannot be distinguished,
when we speak like Christians. For to believe what God has commanded, is in
order to a good life; and to live well is the product of that believing, and as
proper emanation from it, as from its proper principle, and as heat is from the
fire. And therefore, in Scripture, they are used promiscuously in sense, and in
expression, as not only being subjected in the same person, but also in the
same faculty; faith is as truly seated in the will as in the understanding, and
a good life as merely derives from the understanding as the will. Both of them
are matters of choice and of election, neither of them an effect natural and
invincible or necessary antecedently (necessaria ut fiant, non necessario
facta.) And indeed if we remember that S. Paul reckons heresy amongst the works
of the flesh, and ranks it with all manner of practical impieties, we shall
easily perceive that if a man mingles not a vice with his opinion, if he be
innocent in his life, though deceived in his doctrine his error is his misery,
not his crime; it makes him an argument of weakness and an object of pity, but
not a person sealed up to ruin and reprobation.

For as the nature of faith is, so is the nature of heresy, contraries having
the same proportion and commensuration. Now Numb. 9.
faith, if it be taken for an act of the understanding merely, is so far from
being that excellent grace that justifies us, that it is not good at all, in
any kind but in genere naturae, and makes the understanding better in it
self, or pleasing to God, just as strength does the arm, or beauty the face,
or health the body; these are natural perfections indeed, and so knowledge and
a true belief is to the understanding. But this makes us not at all more
acceptable to God; for then the unlearned were certainly in a damnable
condition, and all good Scholars should be saved (whereas I am afraid too much
of the contrary is true.) But unless Faith be made moral by the mixtures of
choice, and charity, it is nothing but a natural perfection, not a grace or a
virtue; and this is demonstrably proved in this, that by the confession of all
men of all interests and persuasions, in matters of mere belief, invincible
ignorance is our excuse if we be deceived, which could not be, but that neither
to believe aright is commendable, nor to believe amiss is reprovable; but
where both one and the other is voluntary and chosen antecedently or
consequently, by prime election or ex post facto, and so comes to be considered
in morality, and is part of a good life or a bad life respectively. Just so it
is in heresy, if it be a design of ambition, and making of a Sect (so Erasmus
expounds S. Paul (...), sectarum Alieni sunt a veritate qui se obarmant
multitudine. Christ.
authorem) if it be for filthy lucres sake as it was in some, that were of the
circumcision, if it be of pride and love of pre-eminence, as it was in
Diotrephes (...), or out of pevishnesse and indociblenesse of disposition, or
of a contentious spirit, that is, that their feet are not shod with the
preparation of the Gospel of peace; in all these cases the error is just so
damnable, as is its principle, but therefore damnable not of it self, but by
reason of its adherencie. And if any shall say any otherwise, it is to say that
some men shall be damned when they cannot help it, perish without their own
fault, and be miserable for ever, because of their unhappiness to be deceived
through their own simplicity and natural or accidental, but inculpable
infirmity.

For it cannot stand with the goodness of God, who does Numb. 10.
so know our infirmities, that he pardons many things in which our wills indeed
have the least share (but some they have) but are overborn with the violence of
an impetuous temptation; I say, it is inconsistent with his goodness to
condemn those who err where the error has nothing of the will in it, who
therefore cannot repent of their error, because they believe it true, who
therefore cannot make compensation because they know not that they are tied to
dereliction of it. And although all Heretics are in this condition, that is,
they believe their errous to be true; yet there is a vast difference between
them who believe so out of simplicity, and them who are given over to believe a
lie, as a punishment or an effect of some other wickedness or impiety. For all
have a concomitant assent to the truth of what they believe; and no man can at
the same time believe what he does not believe, but this assent of the
understanding in Heretics is caused not by force of Argument, but the Argument
is made forcible by something that is amiss in his will; and although a
Heretic may peradventure have a stronger Argument for his error then some
true Believer for his right persuasion; yet it is not considerable how strong
his Argument is (because in a weak understanding, a small motive will produce a
great persuasion, like gentle physic in a weak body) but that which here is
considerable, is, what it is that made his Argument forcible. If his invincible
and harmless prejudice, if his weakness, if his education, if his mistaking
piety, if any thing that has no venom, nor a sting in it, there the
heartinesse of his persuasion is no sin, but his misery and his excuse: but if
any thing that is evil in genere morum did incline his understanding, if his
opinion did commence upon pride, or is nourished by covetousness, or continues
through stupid carelessness, or increases by pertinacy, or is confirmed by
obstinacy, then the innocence of the error is disbanded, his misery is changed
into a crime, and begins its own punishment. But by the way I must observe,
that when I reckond obstinacy amongst those things which make a false opinion
criminal, it is to be understood with some discretion and distinction. For
there is an obstinacy of will which is indeed highly guilty of misdemeanour,
and when the School makes pertinacy or obstinacy to be the formality of
heresy, they say not true at all, unless it be meant the obstinacy of the will
and choice; and if they do, they speak imperfectly and inartificially, this
being but one of the causes that makes error become heresy; the adequate and
perfect formality of heresy is whatsoever makes the error voluntary and
vicious, as is clear in Scripture, reckoning covetousness, and pride, and
lust, and whatsoever is vicious to be its causes; (and in habits, or moral
changes and productions, whatever alters the essence of a habit, or gives it a
new formality, is not to be reckoned the efficient but the form) but there is
also an obstinacy (you may call it) but indeed, is nothing but a resolution and
confirmation of understanding, which is not in a man's power honestly to alter,
and it is not all the commands of humanity, that can be Argument sufficient to
make a man leave believing that for which he thinks he has reason, and for
which he has such Arguments as heartily convince him. Now the persisting in an
opinion finally, and against all the confidence and imperiousness of humane
commands, that makes not this criminal obstinacy, if the erring person have so
much humility of will as to submit to whatever God says, and that no vice in
his will hinders him from believing it. So that we must carefully distinguish
continuance in opinion from obstinacy, confidence of understanding from
peevishness of affection, a not being convinced from a resolution never to be
convinced, upon humane ends and vicious principles: Scimus quosdam quod Lib. 2.
Epist. 1.
semel imbiberint nolle deponere, nec propositum suum facile mutare, sed salvo
inter collegas pacis and concordiae vinculo quaedam propriae quae apud se semel
sint usurpata retinere; Qua in re nec nos vim cuiquam facimus, aut legem damus,
says S. Cyprian. And he himself was such a one; for he persisted in his
opinion of rebaptization until death, and yet his obstinacy was not called
criminal, or his error turned to heresy. But to return.

In this sense, it is that a Heretic is (...), self condemned, not by an
immediate express sentence of understanding, Numb. 11.
but by his own act or fault brought into condemnation. As it is in the Canon
Law, Notorius percussor Clerici is ipso jure excommunicate, not per sententiam
latam ab homine, but a jure. No man has passed sentence pro tribunali, but Law
has decreed it pro edicto: So it is in the case of a Heretic. The
understanding which is judge, condemns him not by an express sentence; for he
erres with as much simplicity in the result, as he had malice in the principle:
But there is sententia lata a jure, his will which is his law, that has
condemned him. And this is gathered from that saying of S. Paul, 2 Timothy 3. 13.
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived: First, they are evil men; malice and peevishness is in their wills;
then they turn Heretics and seduce others, and while they grow worse and
worse, the error is master of their understanding, they are deceived
themselves, given over to believe a lie, says the Apostle: They first play the
knave, and then play the fool; they first sell themselves to the purchase of
vain glory or ill ends, and then they become possessed with a lying spirit,
and believe those things heartily, which if they were honest, they should with
Gods Grace discover and disclaim. So that now we see that bona fides in falso
articulo, a hearty persuasion in a false article does not always make the
error to be esteemed involuntary; but then only when it is as innocent in the
principle as it is confident in the present persuasion. And such persons who by
their ill lives and vicious actions, or manifest designs (for by their fruits
ye shall know them) give testimony of such criminal indispositions, so as
competent judges by humane and prudent estimate may so judge them, then they
are to be declared Heretics, and avoided. And if this were not true, it were
vain that the Apostle commands us to avoid an Heretic: For no external act
can pass upon a man for a crime that is not cognoscible.

Now every man that erres, though in a matter of consequence, Numb. 12.
so long as the foundation is entire, cannot be suspected justly guilty of a
crime to give his error a formality of heresy; for we see many a good man
miserably deceived (as we shall make it appear afterward) and he that is the
best amongst men, certainly has so much humility to think he may be easily
deceived, and twenty to one but he is in some thing or other; yet if his error
be not voluntary, and part of an ill life, then because he lives a good life,
he is a good man, and therefore no Heretic: No man is a Heretic against his
will. And if it be pretended that every man that is deceived, is therefore
proud, because he does not submit his understanding to the authority of God or
Man respectively, and so his error becomes a heresy: To this I answer, That
there is no Christian man but will submit his understanding to God, and
believes whatsoever he has said; but always provided, he knows that God has
said so, else he must do his duty by a readiness to obey when he shall know
it. But for obedience or humility of the understanding toward men, that is a
thing of another consideration, and it must first be made evident that his
understanding must be submitted to men; and who those men are, must also be
certain, before it will be adjudg'd a sin not to submit. But if I mistake
not Christ's saying [call no man master upon earth] is so great a prejudice
against this pretense, as I doubt it will go near wholly to make it invalid.
So that as the worshipping of Angels is a humility indeed, but it is voluntary
and a will worship to an ill sense, not to be excused by the excellency of
humility, nor the virtue of Religion: so is the relying upon the judgment of
man, an humility too, but such as comes not under that (...), that obedience of
Faith which is the duty of every Christian; but intrenches upon that duty which
we owe to Christ as an acknowledgement that he is our great Master, and the
Prince of the Catholic Church. But whether it be or be not, if that be the
Question whether the disagreeing person be to be determined by the dictates of
men, I am sure the dictates of men must not determine him in that Question, but
it must be settled by some higher principle: So that if of that Question the
disagreeing person does opine, or believe, or err bona fide, he is not
therefore to be judged a Heretic, because he submits not his understanding,
because till it be sufficiently made certain to him that he is bound to
submit, he may innocently and piously disagree, and this not submitting is
therefore not a crime (and so cannot make a heresy) because without a crime he
may lawfully doubt whether he be bound to submit or no, for that is the
Question. And if in such Questions which have influence upon a whole systeme of
Theology, a man may doubt lawfully if he doubts heartily, because the authority
of men being the thing in Question, cannot be the judge of this Question, and
therefore being rejected, or (which is all one) being questioned, that is, not
believed, cannot render the doubting person guilty of pride, and by consequence
not of heresy, much more may particular questions be doubted of, and the
authority of men examined, and yet the doubting person be humble enough, and
therefore no Heretic for all this pretense. And it would be considered that
humility is a duty in great ones as well as in Idiots. And as inferiors must
not disagree without reason, so neither must superiors prescribe to others
without sufficient authority, evidence and necessity too: And if rebellion be
pride, so is tyranny; and it being in materia intellectuali, both may be guilty
of pride of understanding, sometimes the one in imposing, sometimes the other
in a causeless disagreeing; but in the inferiors it is then only the want of
humility, when the guides impose or prescribe what God has also taught, and
then it is the disobeying Gods dictares, not man's, that makes the sin. But
then this consideration will also intervene, that as no dictate of God obliges
men to believe it, unless I know it to be such: So neither will any of the
dictates of my superiors, engage my faith, unless I also know, or have no
reason to dis believe, but that they are warranted to teach them to me,
therefore, because God has taught the same to them, which if I once know, or
have no reason to think the contrary, if I disagree, my sin is not in
resisting humane authority, but divine. And therefore the whole business of
submitting our understanding to humane authority, comes to nothing; for either
it resolves into the direct duty of submitting to God, or if it be spoken of
abstractedly, it is no duty at all.

But this pretense of a necessity of humbling the understanding, is none of the
meanest arts whereby some persons have Numb. 13.
invaded, and usurpt a power over men's faith and consciences, and therefore we
shall examine the pretense afterward, and try if God has invested any Man or
company of Men with such a power. In the mean time, he that submits his
understanding to all that he knows God has said, and is ready to submit to
all that he has said if he but know it, denying his own affections and ends,
and interests and humane persuasions, laying them all down at the foot of his
great Master Jesus Christ, that man has brought his understanding into
subjection, and every proud thought unto the obedience of Christ, and this is
(...), the obedience of Faith, which is the duty of a Christian.

But to proceed: Besides these heresies noted in Scripture, the age of the
Apostles, and that which followed, was infested Numb. 14.
with other heresies; but such as had the same formality and malignity with the
precedent, all of them either such as taught practical impieties, or denied an
Article of the Creed. Egesippus in Eusebius reckons seven only prime heresies
that sought to defloure the purity of the Church: That of Simon, that of
Thebutes, of Cleobius, of Dositheus, of Gortheus, of Masbotheus; I suppose
Cerinthus to have been the seventh man, though he express him not: But of
these, except the last, we know no particulars; but that Egesippus says, they
were false Christ's, and that their doctrine was directly against God and his
blessed Son. Menander also was the first of a Sect, but he bewitched the
people with his Sorceries. Cerinthus his doctrine pretended Enthusiasm or a new
Revelation, and ended in lust and impious theorems in matter of uncleanness.
The Vid. Hilar. lib. 1. de Trin.
Ebionites denied Christ to be the Son of God, and affirmed him (...), begot
by natural generation, (by occasion of which and the importunity of the Asian
Bishops, S. John writ his Gospel) and taught the observation of Moses Law.
Basilides taught it lawful to renounce the faith, and take false oaths in time
of Persecution. Carpocrates was a very bedlam, halfe-witch, and quite madman,
and practizd lust, which he called the secret operations to overcome the
Potentates of the world. Some more there were, but of the same nature and pest,
not of a nicety in dispute, not a question of secret Philosophy, not of atoms,
and undiscernable propositions, but open defiances of all Faith, of all
sobriety, and of all sanctity, excepting only the doctrine of the Millenaries,
which in the best Ages was esteemed no heresy, but true Catholic Doctrine,
though since it has justice done to it, and has suffered a just condemnation.

Hitherto, and in these instances, the Church did esteem Numb. 15.
and judge of herefies, in proportion to the rules and characters of Faith. For
Faith being a Doctrine of piety as well as truth, that which was either
destructive of fundamental verity, or of Christian sanctity was against Faith,
and if it made a Sect, was heresy; if not, it ended in personal impiety and
went no farther. But those who as S. Paul says, not only did such things, but
had pleasure in them that do them, and therefore taught others to do what they
impiously did dogmatize, they were Heretics both in matter and form, in
doctrine and deportment, toward God, and toward man, and judicable in both
tribunals.

But the Scripture and Apostolical Sermons, having expressed most high
indignation against these masters of impious Numb. 16.
Sects, leaving them under prodigious characters, and horrid representments, as
calling them men of corrupt minds, reprobates concerning the faith, given over
to strong delusions to the belief of a lie, false Apostles, false Prophets,
men already condemned, and that by themselves, Antichrists, enemies of God;
and heresy it self, a work of the flesh, excluding from the kingdom of
heaven; left such impressions in the minds of all their successors, and so
much zeal against such Sects, that if any opinion commenced in the Church, not
heard of before; it oftentimes had this ill luck to run the same fortune with
an old heresy. For because the Heretics did bring in new opinions in matters
of great concernment, every opinion de novo brought in was liable to the same
exception; and because the degree of malignity in every error was oftentimes
undiscernable, and most commonly indemonstrable, their zeal was alike against
all; and those Ages being full of piety, were fitted to be abused with an
overactive zeal, as wise persons and learned are with a too much indifferency.

But it came to pass, that the further the succession went from the Apostles,
the more forward men were in numbering Numb. 17.
heresies, and that upon slighter and more uncertain grounds. Some footsteps
of this we shall find, if we consider the Sects that are said to have sprung
in the first three hundred years, and they were pretty and quick in their
springs and falls; fourscore and seven of them are reckoned. They were indeed
reckoned afterward, and though when they were alive, they were not condemned
with as much forwardness, as after they were dead; yet even then, confidence
began to mingle with opinions less necessary, and mistakes in judgment were
oftener and more public then they should have been. But if they were forward
in their censures (as some times some of them were) it is no great wonder they
were deceived. For what principle or (...) had they then to judge of heresies,
or condemn them, besides the single dictates or decretals of private Bishops?
for Scripture was indifferently pretended by all; and concerning the meaning of
it, was the Question: now there was no general Council all that while, no
opportunity for the Church to convene; and if we search the communicatory
letters of the Bishops and Martyrs in those days, we shall find but few
sentences decretory concerning any Question of Faith, or new sprung opinion.
And in those that did, for ought appears, the persons were mis-reported, or
their opinions mistaken, or at most, the sentence of condemnation was no more
but this; Such a Bishop who has had the good fortune by posterity to be
reputed a Catholic, did condemn such a man or such an opinion, and yet
himself erred in as considerable matters, but meeting with better neighbors
in his life time, and a more charitable posterity, has his memory preserved in
honor. It appears plain enough in the case of Nicholas the Deacon of Antioch,
upon a mistake of his words whereby he taught (...) to abuse the flesh, viz. by
acts of austerity and self denial, and mortification; some wicked people that
were glad to be mistaken and abused into a pleasing crime, pretended that he
taught them to abuse the flesh by filthy commixtures and pollutions: This
mistake was transmitted to posterity with a full cry, and acts afterward found
out to justify an ill opinion of him. For by S. Hierome's time it grew out of
Question, but that he was the vilest of men, and the worst of Heretics;

Accusations that while the Epist. de Fabiano lapso.
good man lived were never thought of; for his daughters were Virgins, and his
Sons lived in holy coelibate all their lives, and himself lived in chaste
Wedlock; and yet his memory had rotted in perpetual infamy, had not God (in
whose sight, the memory of the Saints is precious) preserved it by the
testimony of L. 3. Stromat.
Clemens Alexandrinus, and from him of L. 3. c. 26. Hist.
Eusebius and Nicephorus. But in the Catalogue of Heretics made by Philastrius
he stands marked with a black character as guilty of many heresies: By which one
testimony we may guess what trust is to be given to those Catalogues: Well,
This good man had ill luck to fall into unskilful hands at first; but
Irenaeus, Justin Maryr, Lactantius, (to name no more) had better fortune; for
it being still extant in their writings that they were of the Millenary
opinion, Papias before, and Nepos after were censured hardly, and the opinion
put into the catalogue of heresies and yet these men never suspected as guilty,
but like the children of the Captivity walked in the midst of the flame, and not
so mcuh as the smell of fire passed on them. But the uncertainty of these
things is very memorable, in the Story of Eustathius Bishop of Antioch
contesting with Eusebius Pamphilus: Eustathius accused Eusebius for going about
to corrupt the Nicene Creed, of which slander he then acquitted himself (says
Socrates) and yet he is not cleared by L. 1. c. 23.
posterity, for still he is suspected, and his fame not clear: However
Eusebius then escaped well, but to be quit with his Adversary, he recriminares
and accuses him to be a favourer of Sabellius, rather then of the Nicene
Canons; an imperfect accusation, God knows, when the crime was a suspicion,
proveable only by actions capable of diverse constructions, and at the most,
made but some degrees of probability, and the fact it self did not consist in
indivisibili, and therefore was to stand or fall, to be improved or lessened
according to the will of the Judges, whom in this cause Eustathius by his ill
fortune and a potent Adversary found harsh toward him, in so much that he was
for heresy deposed in the Synod of Antioch; and though this was laid open in
the eye of the world as being most ready at hand, with the greatest ease
charged upon every man, and with greatest difficulty acquitted by any man; yet
there were other suspicions raised upon him privately, or at least talked of ex
post facto, and pretended as causes of his deprivation, least the sentence
should seem too hard for the first offense. And yet what they were no man could
tell, says the story. But it is observable what Socrates says, as in excuse
of such proceedings, (...). L. 1. c. 24.
It is the manner among the Bishops, when they accuse them that are deposed,
they call them wicked, but they publish not the actions of their impiety. It
might possibly be that the Bishops did it in tenderness of their reputation,
but yet hardly; for to punish a person publicly and highly, is a certain
declaring the person punished guilty of a high crime, and then to conceal the
fault upon pretense to preserve his reputation, leaves every man at liberty, to
conjecture what he pleases, who possibly will believe it worse than it is, in
as much as they think his judges so charitable as therefore to conceal the
fault, least the publishing of it should be his greatest punishment, and the
scandal greater then his deprivation. Simpliciter pateat vitium fortasse
pusillum, Quod-tegitur majus creditur esse malum Martial.
However this course, if it were just in any, was unsafe in all; for it might
undo more then it could preserve, and therefore is of more danger, then it can
be of charity. It is therefore too probable that the matter was not very fair;
for in public sentence the acts ought to be public; but that they rather
pretend heresy to bring their ends about, shows how easy it is to impute that
crime, and how forward they were to do it: And that they might and did then as
easily call Heretic as afterward, when Vigilius was condemned of heresy for
saying there were Antipodes; or as the Friars of late did, who suspected Greek
and Hebrew of heresy, and called their Professors Heretics, and had like to have
put Terence and Demosthenes into the Index Expurgatorius; sure enough they
raild at them pro concione, therefore because they understood them not, and had
reason to believe they would accidentally be enemies to their reputation among
the people.

By this instance which was a while after the Nicene Council, where the acts
of the Church were regular, judicial and orderly, Numb. 18.
we may guess at the sentences passed upon heresy, at such times and in such
cases, when their process was more private, and their acts more tumultuary,
their information less certain, and therefore their mistakes more easy and
frequent. And it is remarkable in the case of the heresy of Montanus, the scene
of whose heresy lay within the first three hundred years, though it was
represented in the Caralogues afterward, and possibly the mistake concerning
it, is to be put upon the score of Epiphanius, by whom Montanus and his
Followers were put into the Catalogue of Heretics for commanding abstinence
from meats, as if they were unclean, and of themselves unlawful. Now the truth
was, Montanus said no such thing, but commanded frequent abstinence, enjoined
dry diet, and an ascetick Table, not for conscience sake, but for Discipline;
and yet because he did this with too much rigor and strictness of mandate,
the Primitive Church mislik'd it in him, as being too near their error, who
by a Judaicall superstition abstained from meats as from uncleanness. This by
the way will much concern them who place too much sanctity in such Rites and
Acts of Discipline; for it is an eternal Rule and of never failing truth, that
such abstinences if they be obtruded as Acts of original immediate duty and
sanctity, are unlawful and superstious; if they be for Discipline they may be
good, but of no very great profit; it is that (...) which S. Paul says
profits but little; and just in the same degree the Primitive Church esteemed
them; for they therefore reprehended Montanus, for urging such abstinences with
too much earnestness, though but in the way of Discipline, for that it was no
more, Tertullian, who was himself a Montanist, and knew best the opinions of
his own Sect, testifies; and yet Epiphanus reporting the errors of Montanus,
commends that which Montanus truly and really taught, and which the Primitive
Church condemned in him, and therefore represents that heresy to another sense,
and affixes that to Montanus, which Epiphanius beliv'd a heresy, and yet which
Montanus did not teach. And this also among many other things lessens my
opinion very much of the integrity or discretion of the old Catalogues of
Heretics, and much abates my confidence toward them.

And now that I have mentioned them casually in passing by, I shall give a
short account of them; for men are much Numb. 19.
mistaken; some in their opinions concerning the truth of them, as believing
them to be all true, some concerning their purpose as thinking them sufficient
not only to condemn all those opinions, there called heretical; but to be a
precedent to all Ages of the Church to be free and forward in calling Heretic.
But he that considers the Catalogues themselves, as they are collected by
Epiphanius, Philastrius, and S. Austin, shall find that many are reckoned for
Heretics for opinions in matters disputable, and undetermined, and of no
consequence; and that in these Catalogues of Heretics there are men numbered
for Heretics, which by every side respectively are acquitted; so that there is
no company of men in the world that admit these Catalogues as good Records, or
sufficient sentences of condemnation. For the Churches of the Reformation, I am
certain, they acquit Aerius for denying prayer for the dead, and the
Eustathians for denying invocation of Saints. And I am partly of opinion that
the Church of Rome is not willing to call the Collyridians Heretics for
offering a Cake to the Virgin Mary, unless she also will run the hazard of
the same sentence for offering Candles to her: And that they will be glad with
S. Austin (l. 6. de haeres. c. 86.) to excuse the D. Thom. l. contr. gent. c.
21.
Tertullianists for picturing God in a visible corporal representment. And yet
these Sects are put in the black book by Epiphanius and S. Austin, and Isidore
respectively. I remember also that the Osseni are called Heretics, because they
refused to worship toward the East; and yet in that dissent, I find not the
malignity of a heresy, nor any thing against an Article of Faith or good
manners; and it being only in circumstance, it were hard, if they were
otherwise pious men and true believers, to send them to Hell for such a trifle.
The Parermeneutae refused to follow other men's dictates like sheep, but would
expound Scripture according to the best evidence themselves could find, and
yet were called Heretics whether they expounded true or no. The Euthym. part.
1. tit. 21.* Epiphan. haeres. 64.
Pauliciani for being offended at crosses, the Proclians for saying in a
regenerate man all his sins were not quite dead, but only curbed and
assuaged, were called Heretics, and so condemned; for ought I know for
affirming that which all pious men feel in themselves to be too true. And he
that will consider how numerous the Catalogues are, and to what a volumn they
are come in their last collections, to no less then five hundred and twenty
(for so many heresies and Heretics are reckoned by Prateolus) may think that
if a re-trenchment were justly made of truths, and all impertinencies, and all
opinions, either still disputable, or less considerable, the number would much
decrease; and therefore that the Catalogues are much amiss, and the name
Heretic is made a terriculamentum to affright people from their belief, or to
discountenance the persons of men, and disrepute them, that their Schools may
be empty and their Disciples few.

So that I shall not need to instance how that some men Numb. 20.
were called Heretics by Philastrius for rejecting the translation of the LXX.
and following the Bible of Aquila, wherein the great faults mentioned by
Philastrius, are that he translates (...), not Christum, but unctum Dei, and in
stead of Emanuel writes Deus nobiscum. But this most concerns them of the
Primitive Church with whom the translation of Aquila was in great reputation,
is enim veluti plus a quibusdam..... intellexisse laudatur. It was supposed he
was a greater Clerk and understood more then ordinary; it may be so he did. But
whether yea or no, yet since the other Translators by the Confession of
Philastrius, quaedam praetermisisse necessitate urgente cogerentur, if some
wise men or unwise did follow a Translatour who understood the Original well
(for so Aquila had learnt amongst the Jews) it was hard to call men Heretics
for following his Translation, especially since the other Bibles (which were
thought to have in them contradictories; and, it was confessed, had omitted
some things) were excused by necessity, and the others necessity of following
Aquila, when they had no better was not at all considered, nor a less crime
then heresy laid upon their score Philastr 99. eos inter haereticos numerat qui
spiraculum vitae in libro Genes. interpretantur animam rationalem, and non
potius gratiam Spiritus sancti.
. Such another was the heresy of the Quartodecimani; for the Easterlings were
all proclaimed Heretics for keeping Easter after the manner of the East; and
as Socrates and Nicephorus report, the Bishop of Rome was very forward to
Excommunicate all the Bishops of the lesser Asia for observing the Feast
according to the Tradition of their Ancestors, though they did it modestly,
quietly, and without faction; and although they pretended, and were as well
able to prove their Tradition from S. John, of so observing it, as the Western
Church could prove their Tradition derivative from S. Peter and S. Paul. If
such things as these make up the Catalogues of Heretics (as we see they did)
their accounts differ from the Precedents they ought to have followed, that is,
the censures Apostolical, and therefore are unsafe Precedents for us; and
unless they took the liberty of using the word heresy, in a lower sense, then
the world now does, since the Councels have been forward in pronouncing
Anathema, and took it only for a distinct sense, and a differing persuasion in
matters of opinion and minute Articles, we cannot excuse the persons of the
men: But if they intended the crime of heresy against those opinions as they
laid them down in their Catalogues, that crime (I say) which is a work of the
flesh, which excludes from the Kingdom of Heaven, all that I shall say against
them, is, that the causlesse curse shall return empty, and no man is damned the
sooner, because his enemy cries (...), and they that were the Judges and
Accusers might err as well as the persons accused, and might need as
charitable construction of their opinions and practices as the other. And of
this we are sure they had no warrant from any rule of Scripture or practice
Apostolical, for driving so furiously and hastily in such decretory sentences.
But I am willing rather to believe their sense of the word heresy was more
gentle then with us it is, and for that they might have warrant from Scripture.

But by the way, I observe that although these Catalogues are Numb. 21.
a great instance to show that they whose Age and spirits were far distant
from the Apostles, had also other judgments concerning Faith and heresy, then
the Apostles had, and the Ages Apostolical; yet these Catalogues although they
are reports of heresies in the second and third Ages, are not to be put upon
the account of those Ages, nor to be reckoned as an instance of their
judgment, which although it was in some degrees more culpable then that of
their Predecessors, yet in respect of the following Ages it was innocent and
modest. But these Catalogues I speak of, were set down according to the sense
of the then presentages, in which as they in all probability did differ from
the apprehensions of the former Centuries, so it is certain, there were
differing learnings, other sancies, diverse representments and judgments of men
depending upon circumstances which the first Ages knew, and the following Ages
did not; and therefore the Catalogues were drawn with some truth, but less
certainty, as appears in their differing about the Authors of some heresies;
several opinions imputed to the same, and some put in the roll of Heretics by
one, which the other left out; which to me is an Argument that the Collectors
were determined, not by the sense and sentences of the three first Ages but by
themselves, and some circumstances about them, which to reckon for Heretics,
which not. And that they themselves were the prime Judges, or perhaps some in
their own Age together with them; but there was not any sufficient external
judicatory competent to declare heresy that by any public or sufficient
sentence or acts of Court had furnished them with warrant for their Catalogues.
And therefore they are no Argument sufficient that the first Ages of the
Church, which certainly were the best, did much recede from that which I showed
to be the sense of the Scripture, and the practice of the Apostles; they all
contented themselves with the Apostles Creed as the rule of the Faith; and
therefore were not forward to judge of heresy, but by analogy to their rule of
Faith: And those Catalogues made after these Ages are not sufficient Arguments
that they did otherwise; but rather of the weakness of some persons, or of the
spirit and genius of the Age in which the Compilers lived, in which the device
of calling all differing opinions by the name of heresies, might grow to be a
design to serve ends, and to promote interests, as often as an act of zeal and
just indignation against evil persons destroyers of the Faith and corrupters
of manners.

For whatever private men's opinions were, yet till the Nicene Numb. 22.
Council, the rule of Faith was entire in the Apostles Creed, and provided
they retained that, easily they broke not the unity of Faith, however differing
opinions might possibly commence in such things in which a liberty were better
suffered then prohibited with a breach of charity. And this appears exactly in
the Question between S. Cyprian of Carthage, and Stephan Bishop of Rome, in
which one instance it is easy to see what was lawful and safe for a wise and
good man, and yet how others began even then to be abused by that temptation,
which since has invaded all Christendom. S. Cyprian re. baptized Heretics,
and thought he was bound so to do; calls a Synod in Africa as being
Metropolitan, and confirms his opinion by the consent of his Suffragans and
Brethren, but still with so much modesty that if any man was of another
opinion, he judged him not, but gave him that liberty that he desired himself;
Stephen Bishop of Rome grows angry, Excommunicates the Bishops of Asia and
Africa, that in diverse Synods had consented to rebaptization, and without
peace, and without charity condemns them for Heretics. Indeed here was the
rarest mixture and conjunction of unlikelihoods that I have observed. Here was
error of opinion with much modesty and sweetness of temper on one side; and
on the other, an over-active and impetuous zeal to attest a truth, it uses not
to be so, for error usually is supported with confidence, and truth suppressed
and discountenanced by indifferency. But that it might appear that the error
was not the sin but the uncharitableness, Stephan was accounted a zealous
and furious person, and S. Vid. S. Aug. l. 2. c. 6. de baptis. contra Donat.
Cyprian though deceived, yet a very good man, and of great sanctity. For
although every error is to be opposed, yet according to the variety of
errors, so is there variety of proceedings. If it be against Faith, that is, a
destruction of any part of the foundation, it is with zeal to be resisted, and
we have for it an Apostolical warrant, contend earnestly for the Faith; but
then as these things recede farther from the foundation, our certainty is the
less, and their necessity not so much, and therefore it were very fit, that
our confidence should be according to our evidence, and our zeal according to
our confidence, and our confidence should then be the Rule of our Communion;
and the lightness of an Article should be considered with the weight of a
precept of charity. And therefore, there are some errors to be reproved,
rather by a private friend then a public censure, and the persons of the men
not avoided but admonished, and their Doctrine rejected, not their Communion;
few opinions are of that malignity which are to be rejected with the same
exterminating spirit, and confidence of aversation, with which the first
Teachers of Christianity condemned Ebion, Manes, and Cerinthus; and in the
condemnation of Heretics the personal iniquity is more considerable then the
obliquity of the doctrine, not for the rejection of the Article, but for
censuring the persons; and therefore it is the piety of the man that excused S.
Cyprian, which is a certain Argument that it is not the opinion, but the
impiety that condemns and makes the Heretic. And this was it which Vincentius
Lirinensis Adv. haeres. c. 11.
said in this very case of S. Cyprian, Vnius and ejusdem opinionis (mirum
videri potest) judicamus authors Catholicos, and sequaces haereticos.
Excusamus Magistros, and condemnamus Scholasticos. Qui scripserunt libros sunt
haeredes Coeli, quorum librorum defensores detruduntur ad infernum. Which
saying, if we confront against the saying of Salvian condemning the first
Authors of the Arrian Sect, and acquitting the Followers, we are taught by
these two wise men, that an error is not it that sends a man to Hell, but he
that begins the heresy, and is the author of the Sect, he is the man marked
out to ruin; and his Followers escaped, when the Here siarch commenced the
error upon pride and ambition, and his Followers went after him in simplicity
of their heart; and so it was most commonly: but on the contrary, when the
first man in the opinion was honestly and invincibly deceived, as S. Cyprian
was, and that his Scholars to maintain their credit, or their ends, maintaind
the opinion, not for the excellency of the reason persuading, but for the
benefit and accruments, or peevishness, as did the Donatisis, qui de Cypriani
authoritate fibi carnaliter blandiuntur, as S. Austin said of them; then the
Scholars are the Heretics, and the Master is a Catholic. For his error is
not the heresy formally, and an erring person may be a Catholic. A wicked
person in his error becomes heretic, when the good man in the same error
shall have all the rewards of Faith. For whatever an ill man believes, if he
therefore believe it because it serves his own ends, be his belief true or
false, the man has an heretical mind, for to serve his own ends, his mind
is prepared to believe a lie. But a good man that believes what according to
his light, and upon the use of his moral industry he thinks true, whether he
hits upon the right or no, because he has a mind desirous of truth, and
prepared to believe every truth is therefore acceptable to God, because nothing
hindered him from it, but what he could not help, his misery and his weakness,
which being imperfections merely natural, which God never punishes, he stands
fair for a blessing of his morality, which God always accepts. So that now if
Stephen had followed the example of God Almighty, or retained but the same
peaceable spirit which his Brother of Cathage did, he might with more advantage
to truth, and reputation both of wisdom and piety have done his duty in
attesting what he believed to be true; for we are as much bound to be zealous
pursuers of peace as earnest contenders for the Faith I am sure more earnest we
ought to be for the peace of the Church, then for an Article which is not of
the Faith, as this Question of re-baptization was not; for S. Cyprian died in
belief against it, and yet was a Catholic, and a Martyr for the Christian
Faith.

The sum is this S. Cyprian did right in a wrong cause (as Numb. 23.
it has been since judged) and Stephen did ill in a good cause; as fame then
as piety and charity is to be preferred before a true opinion, so far is S.
Cyprian's practice a better precedent for us, and an example of primitive
sanctity, then the zeal and indiscretion of Stephen: S. Cyprian had not
learned to forbid to any one a liberty of prophesying or interpretation, if he
transgressed not the foundation of Faith and the Creed of the Apostles.

Well thus it was, and thus it ought to be in the first Ages, Numb. 23.
the Faith of Christendom rested still upon the same foundation, and the
judgments of heresies were accordingly, or were amisie; but the first great
violation of this truth was, when General Councels came in, and the Symbols
were enlarged, and new Articles were made as much of necessity to be believed
as the Creed of the Apostles, and damnation threatened to them that did diffent,
and at last the Creeds multiplied in number, and in Articles, and the liberty
of prophesying began to be something restrained.

And this was of so much the more force and efficacy because Numb. 25.
it began upon great reason, and in the first instance, with success good
enough. For I am much pleased with the enlarging of the Creed, which the
Council of Nice made, because they enlarged it to my sense; but I am not sure
that others are satisfied with it; While we look upon the Article they did
determine, we see all things well enough; but there are some wise personages
consider it in all circumstances, and think the Church had been more happy if
she had not been in some sense constrained to alter the simplicity of her
faith, and make it more curious and articulate, so much that he had need be a
subtle man to understand the very words of the new determinations.

For the first Alexander Bishop of Alexandria, in the presence Numb. 26.
of his Clergy, entreats somewhat more curiously of the secret of the
mysterious Trinity, and Unity, so curiously, that Socra. l. 1. c. 8.
Arius (who was a Sophister too subtle as it afterward appeared) misunderstood
him, and thought he intended to bring in the heresy of Sabellius. For while he
taught the Unity of the Trinity either he did it so inartificially, or so
intricately, that Arius thought he did not distinguish the persons, when the
Bishop intended only the unity of nature. Against this Arius furiously drives,
and to confute Sabellius, and in him (as he thought) the Bishop, distinguishes
the natures too, and so to secure the Article of the Trinity, destroys the
Unity. It was the first time the Question was disputed in the world, and in
such mysterious niceties, possibly every wise man may understand something, but
few can understand all, and therefore suspect what they understand not, and are
furiously zealous for that part of it which they do perceive. Well, it happened
in these as always in such cases, in things men understand not they are most
impetuous; and because suspicion is a thing infinite in degrees, for it has
nothing to determine it, a suspicious person is ever most violent; for his
fears are worse then the thing feared, because the thing is limited, but his
fears are not; so that upon this grew contentions on both sides, and Lib. 1.
c. 6.
tumults, railing and reviling each other; and then the Laity were drawn into
parts, and the Meletians abetted the wrong part, and the right part fearing to
be overborn, did any thing that was next at hand to secure it self. Now then
they that lived in that Age, that understood the men, that saw how quiet the
Church was before this stir, how miserably rent now, what little benefit from
the Question, what schism about it, gave other censures of the business, then
we since have done, who only look upon the Article determind with truth and
approbation of the Church generally, since that time. But the Epistle of
Constantine to Alexander and Arius, tells the truth, and Cap. 7.
chides them both for commencing the Question, Alexander for broaching it,
Arius for taking it up; and although this be true, that it had been better for
the Church it never had begun, yet being begun, what is to be done in it? of
this also in that admirable Epistle, we have the Emperors judgment (I suppose
not without the advice and privity of Hosius Bishop of Corduba, whom the
Emperor loved and trusted much, and employed in the delivery of the Letters.)
For first he calls it a certain vain piece of a Question, ill begun and more
unadvisedly published, a Question which no Law or Ecclesiastical Canon
defines, a fruitless contention, the product of idle brains, a matter so
nice, so obscure, so intricate that it was neither to be explicated by the
Clergy, nor understood by the people, a dispute of words, a doctrine
inexpliable, but most dangerous when taught least it introduce discord or
blasphemy; and therefore, the Objector was rash, and the answerer unadvised;
for it concernd not the substance of Faith, or the worship of God, nor any
chief commandment of Scripture, and therefore, why should it be the matter of
discord? For though the matter be grave; yet because neither necessary, nor
explicable, the contention is trifling and toyish. And therefore, as the
Philosophers of the same Sect, though differing in explication of an opinion,
yet more love for the unity of their Profession, then disagree for the
difference of opinion; So should Christians believing in the same God,
retaining the same Faith, having the same hopes, opposed by the same enemies,
not fall at variance upon such disputes, considering our understandings are not
all alike; and therefore, neither can our opinions in such mysterious Articles:
so that the matter being of no great importance, but vain, and a toy in
respect of the excellent blessings of peace and charity, it were good that
Alexander and Arius should leave contending, keep their opinions to themselves,
ask each other forgiveness, and give mutual toleration. This is the substance
of Constantine's letter, and it contains in it much reason, if he did not
undervalue the Question; but it seems it was not then thought a Question of
Faith but of nicety of dispute; they both did believe one God, and the holy
Trinity. Now then that he afterward called the Nicene Council, it was upon
occasion of the vileness of the men of the Arian part, their eternal discord
and pertinacious wrangling, and to bring peace into the Church; that was the
necessity; and in order to it was the determination of the Article. But for the
Article it self, the Letter declares what opinion he had of that, and this
Letter was by Socrates called a wonderful exhortation, full of grace and sober
councels; and such as Hosius himself, who was the messenger, pressed with all
earnestness, with all the skill and Authority he had.

I know the opinion the world had of the Article afterward is quite differing
from this censure given of it before; and Numb. 27.
therefore they have put it into the Creed (I suppose) to bring the world to
unity, and to prevent Sedition in this Question, and the accidental
blasphemies, which were occasioned by their curious talkings of such secret
mysteries, and by their illiterate resolutions. But although the Article was
determined with an excellent spirit, and we all with much reason profess to
believe it; yet it is another consideration, whether or no it might not have
been better determined, if with more simplicity; and another yet, whether or no
since many of the Bishops who did believe this thing, yet did not like the
nicety and curiosity of expressing it, it had not been more agreeable to the
practice of the Apostles to have made a determination of the Article by way of
Exposition of the Apostles Creed, and to have left this in a rescript, for
record to all posterity, and not to have enlarged the Creed with it; for since
it was an Explication of an Article of the Creed of the Apostles, as Sermons
are of places of Scripture, it was thought by some, that Scripture might with
good profit, and great truth be expounded, and yet the expositions not put into
the Canon, or go for Scripture, but that left still in the naked Original
simplicity, and so much the rather since that Explication was further from the
foundation, and though most certainly true, yet not penned by so infallible a
spirit, as was that of the Apostles; and therefore not with so much evidence,
as certainty. And if they had pleased, they might have made use of an admirable
precedent to this and many other great and good purposes, no less then of the
blessed Apostles, whose Symbol they might have imitated, with as much
simplicity as they did the Expressions of Scripture, when they first composed
it. For it is most considerable, that although in reason, every clause in the
Creed should be clear, and so inopportune and unapt to variety of
interpretation, that there might be no place left for several senses or
variety of Expositions: yet when they thought fit to insert some mysteries into
the Creed, which in Scripture were expressed in so mysterious words, that the
last and most explicit sense would still be latent, yet they who (if ever any
did) understood all the senses and secrets of it, thought it not fit to use any
words but the words of Scripture, particularly in the Articles of [Christs
descending into Hell, and sitting at the right hand of God] to show us, that
those Creeds are best which keep the very words of Scripture; and that Faith is
best which has greatest simplicity, and that it is better in all cases humbly
to submit; then curiously to enquire and pry into the mystery under the cloud,
and to hazard our Faith by improving our knowledge: If the Nicene Fathers had
done so too, possibly the Church would never have repented it.

And indeed the experience, the Church had afterward, Numb. 28.
showed that the Bishops and Priests were not satisfied in all circumstances,
nor the schism appeased, nor the persons agreed, nor the Canons accepted, nor
the Article understood, nor any thing right, but when they were overborn with
Authority, which Authority when the scales turned, did the same service and
promotion to the contrary.

But it is considerable, that it was not the Article or the Numb. 29.
thing it self that troubled the disagreeing persons, but the manner of
representing it. For the five Dissenters, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Theognis,
Maris, Theonas, and Secundus, believed Christ to be very God of very God, but
the clause of (...) they derided as being persuaded by their Logic, that he
was neither of the substance of the Father, by division as a piece of a lump
nor derivation as children from their Parents, nor by production as buds from
trees, and no body could tell them any other way at that time, and that made
the fire to burn still. And that was it I said; if the Article had been with
more simplicity, and less nicety determined; charity would have gained more,
and faith would have lost nothing. And we shall find the wisest of them all,
for so Eusebius Pamphilus was esteemed, published a Creed or Confession in the
Synod, and though he and all the rest believed that great mystery of
Godlinesle, Vide Sozomen. lib. 2. c. 18.
God manifested in the flesh, yet he was not fully satisfied, nor so soon of
the clause of one substance, till he had done a little violence to his own
understanding; for even when he had subscribed to the clause of one substance,
he does it with a protestation, that heretofore he never had been acquainted,
nor accustomed himself to such speeches. And the sense of the word was either
so ambiguous, or their meaning so uncertain that Andreas Fricius does with some
probability dispute that Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 26.
the Nicene Fathers by (...), did mean Patris similitudinem, non essentiae
unitatem, Sylva. 4. c. 1. And it was so well undestood by personages
disinterested, that when Arius and Euzoius had confessed Christ to be Deus
verbum, without inserting the clause of one substance, the Emperor by his
Letter approved of his Faith, and restored him to his Country and Office, and
the Communion of the Church. And along time after although the Article was
believed with Non imprudenter dix^t, qui curiosae explicationi hujus mysterii
dictum Aristonis Philosophi applicu^t, H^lleborus niger si crassius sumatur
purgat and senate. Quum autum teritur and comminuitur, suffocat.
nicety enough, yet when they added more words still to the mystery, and
brought in the word (...), saying there were three hypostases in the holy
Trinity; it was so long before it could be understood, that it was believed
therefore, because they would not oppose their Superiors, or disturb the peace
of the Church, in things which they thought could not be understood: in so much
that S. Hierom writ to Damasus, in these words: Discern si placet obsecro, non
timebo tres hypostases dicere, si jubetis; and again, Obtestor beatitudinem
tuam per Crucifixum, mundi salutem, per (...) Trinitatem, ut mihi Epistolis
tuis, sive tacendarum sive dicendarum hypostaseon detur authoritas.

But without all Question, the Fathers determined the Question Numb. 30.
with much truth, though I cannot say, the Arguments upon which they built
their Decrees, were so good as the conclusion it self was certain; But that
which in this case is considerable, is whether or no they did well in putting a
curse to the foot of their Decree, and the Decree it self into the Symbol, as
if it had been of the same necessity? For the curse, Eusebius Pamphilus could
hardly find in his heart to subscribe, at last he did; but with this clause
that he subscribed it because the form of curse did only forbid men to
acquaint themselves with foreign speeches and unwritten languages, whereby
confusion and discord is brought into the Church. So that it was not so much a
magisteriall high assertion of the Article, as an endeavor to secure the peace
of the Church. And to the same purpose for ought I know, the Fathers composed a
Form of Confession, not as a prescript Rule of Faith to build the hopes of our
salvation on but as a tessera of that Communion which by public Authority was
therefore established upon those Articles because the Articles were true,
though not of prime necessity, and because that unity of confession was judged,
as things then stood, the best preserver of the unity of minds.

But I shall observe this, that although the Nicene Fathers Numb. 31.
in that case at that time, and in that conjuncture of circumstances did well
(and yet their approbation is made by after Ages ex post facto) yet if this
precedent had been followed by all Councels (and certainly they had equal
power, if they had thought it equally reasonable) and that they had put all
their Decrees into the Creed, as some have done since, to what a volume had the
Creed by this time swelled? and all the house had run into foundation, nothing
left for super-structures. But that they did not, it appears declarando, not
imperando, as Doctors in their Chaires, not masters of other men's faith and
consciences. not all controversies determined? but even when General
Assemblies of Prelates have been, some controversies that have been very
vexatious, have been pretermitted, and others of less consequence have been
determind: Why did never any General Council condemn in express sentence the
Pelagian heresy, that great pest, that subtle infection of Cristendome? and yet
diverse General Counsels did assemble while the heresy was in the world. Both
these cases in several degrees leave men in their liberty of believing and
prophesying. The latter proclaims that all controversies cannot be determind
to sufficient purposes, and the first declares that those that are, are not all
of them matters of Faith, and themselves are not so secure, but they may be
deceived; and therefore possibly it were better it were let alone; for if the
latter leaves them divided in their opinions, yet their Communions, and
therefore probably their charities are not divided; but the former divides
their Communions, and hinders their interest; and yet for ought is certain, the
accused person is the better Catholic. And yet after all this, it is not
safety enough to say, let the Council or Prelates determine Articles warily,
seldom, with great caution, and with much sweetness and modesty. For though
this be better then to do it rashly, frequently and furiously; yet if we once
transgress the bounds set us by the Apostles in their Creed, and not only
preach other truths, but determine them pro tribunali as well as pro cathedra,
although there be no error in the subject matter (as in Nice there was none)
yet if the next Ages say they will determine another Article with as much care
and caution, and pretend as great a necessity, there is no hindering them, but
by giving reasons against it; and so like enough they might have done against
the decreeing the Article at Nice; yet that is not sufficient; for since the
Authority of the Nicene Council has grown to the height of a mountainous
prejudice against him that should say it was ill done, the same reason and the
same necessity may be pretended by any Age and in any Council, and they think
themselves warranted by the great precedent at Nice, to proceed as peremptorily
as they did; but then if any other Assembly of learned men may possibly be
deceived, were it not better they should spare the labor, then that they
should with so great pomp and solennities engage men's persuasions, and
determine an Article which after Ages must rescind; for therefore most
certainly in their own Age, the point with safety of faith and salvation, might
have been disputed and disbelieved: And that many men's faiths have been tied up
by Acts and Decrees of Councels for those Articles in which the next Age did
see a liberty had better been preserved, because an error was determined, we
shall afterward receive a more certain account.

And therefore the Council of Nice did well, and Constantinople did well, so
did Ephesus and Chalcedon; but it is Numb. 32.
because the Articles were truly determined (for that is part of my belief;)
but who is sure it should be so before hand, and whether the points there
determined were necessary or no to be believed or to be determined, if peace
had been concerned in it through the faction and division of the parties, I
suppose the judgment of Constantine the Emperor and the famous Hosius of
Corduba is sufficient to instruct us, whose authority I rather urge then
reasons, because it is a prejudice and not a reason I am to contend against.

So that such determinations and publishing of Confessions with Authority of
Prince and Bishop, are sometimes of very Numb. 33.
good use for the peace of the Church, and they are good also to determine the
judgment of indifferent persons, whose reasons of either side, are not too
great to weigh down the probability of that Authority: But for persons of
confident and imperious understandings, they on whose side the determination
is, are armed with a prejudice against the other, and with a weapon to affront
them, but with no more to convince them; and they against whom the decision is,
do the more readily betake themselves to the defensive, and are engaged upon
contestation and public enmities, for such Articles which either might safely
have been unknown, or with much charity disputed. Therefore the Nicene
Council, although it have the advantage of an acquired and prescribing
Authority, yet it must not become a precedent to others, least the
inconveniences of multiplying more Articles upon as great pretense of reason as
then, make the act of the Nicene Fathers in straightning Prophesying, and
enlarging the Creed, become accidentally an inconvenience. The first restraint,
although if it had been complaind of, might possibly have been better
considered of; yet the inconvenience is not visible, till it comes by way of
precedent to usher in more. It is like an Arbitrary power, which although by
the same reason it take six pence from the subject, it may take a hundred
pound, and then a thousand, and then all, yet so long as it is within the first
bounds, the inconvenience is not so great; but when it comes to be a precedent
or argument for more, then the first may justly be complaind of, as having in
it that reason in the principle, which brought the inconvenience in the
sequel; and we have seen very ill consequents from innocent beginnings.

And the inconveniences which might possibly arise from Numb. 34.
this precedent, those wise Personages also did foresee, and therefore
although they took liberty in Nice, to add some Articles, or at least more
explicitly to declare the first Creed, yet they then would have all the world
to rest upon that and go no farther, as believing that to be sufficient. S.
Athanasius declares their opinion, (...). Epist ad Epict.
That Faith which those Fathers there confessed, was sufficient for the
refutation of all impiety, and the establishment of all Faith in Christ and
true Religion. And therefore there was a famous Epistle written by Zeno the
Emperor, called the (...) Euagr. l. 3. c. 14.
or the Epistle of reconciliation, in which all disagreeing interests, are
entreated to agree in the Nicene Symbol, and a promise made upon that condition
to communicate with all other Sects, adding withal, that the Church should
never receive any other Symbol then that which was composd by the Nicene
Fathers. And however Honorius was condemnd for a Monothelite; yet in one of the
Epistles which the sixth Synod alleged against him, (viz. the second) he gave
them counsel that would have done the Church as much service as the
determination of the Article did; for he advised them not to be curious in
their disputings, nor dogmaticall in their determinations about that Question;
and because the Church was not used to dispute in that Question, it were better
to preserve the simplicity of Faith, then to ensnare men's consciences by a new
Article. And when the Emperor Constantius was by his Faction engaged in a
contrary practice, the inconvenience and unreasonablenesse was so great, that a
prudent Heathen observed and noted it in this character of Constantius,
Christianam religionem absolutam and simplicem [N. B.] anili superstitione
confudit. In qua scrutanda perplexius quam in componenda gratius, excitavit
dissidia quae progressa fusius aluit concertatione verborum dum ritum omnem ad
suum trahere conatur arbitrium.

And yet men are more lead by Example then either by Reason or by Precept; for
in the Council of Constantinople one Numb. 35.
Article de novo and integro was added, viz. I believe one Baptism for the
remission of sins; and then again they were so confident, that that
Confession of Faith was so absolutely entire, and that no man ever after should
need to add any thing to the integrity of Faith, that the Fathers of the
Council of Ephesus pronounced Anathema to all those that should add any thing
to the Creed of Constantinople. And yet for all this, the Church of Rome in a
Synod at Gentilly added the clause of Filioque, to the Article of the
procession of the holy Ghost, and what they have done since, all the world
knows, Exempla non consistunt, sed quamvis in tenuem recepta tramitem,
latissime evagandi sibi faciunt potestatem. All men were persuaded that it was
most reasonable the limits of Faith should be no more enlarged; but yet they
enlarged it themselves, and bound others from doing it, like an intemperate
Father, who because he knows he does ill himself, enjoins temperance to his
Son, but continues to be intemperate himself.

But now if I should be questioned concerning the Symbol of Numb. 36.
Athanasius (for we see the Nicene Symbol was the Father of many more, some
twelve or thirteen Symbols in the space of a hundred years) I confess I cannot
see that moderate sentence and gentleness of charity in his Preface and
Conclusion as there was in the Nicene Creed. Nothing there but damnation and
perishing everlastingly, unless the Article of the Trinity be believed, as it
is there with curiosity and minute particularities explaind. Indeed Athanasius
had been soundly vexed on one side, and much cried up on the other; and
therefore it is not so much wonder for him to be so decretory and severe in his
censure; for nothing could more ascertain his friends to him, and dis-repute
his enemies, then the belief of that damnatory Appendix; but that does not
justify the thing. For the Articles themselves, I am most heartily persuaded
of the truth of them, and yet I dare not say all that are not so, are
irrevocably damnd, because citra hoc Symbolum, the Faith of the Apostles Creed
is entire, and he that believes and is baptized shall be saved, that is, he
that believes such a belief as is sufficient disposition to be baptized, that
Faith with the Sacrament is sufficient for heaven. Now the Apostles Creed does
one; why therefore do not both entitle us to the promise? Besides, if it were
considered concerning Athanasius Creed, how many people understand it not, how
contrary to natural reason it seems, how little the Vide Hosum de author. S.
Scrip. l. 3. p. 53. and Gordon. Huntlaeum. Tom. 1. controv. 1. de verbo Dei,

Scripture says of those curiosities of Explication, and how Tradition was not
clear on his side for the Article it self, much less for those forms and
minutes (how himself is put to make an answer, and excuse for the Vide

Fathers speaking in favor of the Arrians, at least so seemingly, that the
Arrians appeald to them for trial, and the offer was declind) and after all
this that the Nicene Creed it self went not so far, neither in Article, nor
Anathema nor Explication, it had not been amiss if the final judgment had
been left to Jesus Christ; for he is appointed Judge of all the World, and he
shall Judge the people righteously, for he knows every truth, the degree of
every necessity, and all excuses that do lessen, or take away the nature or
malice of a crime; all which I think Athanasius though a very good man, did not
know so well as to warrant such a sentence. And put case the heresy there
condemnd be damnable, (as it is damnable enough) yet a man may maintain an
opinion that is in it self damnable, and yet he not knowing it so, and being
invincibly lead into it may go to heaven; his opinion shall burn, and himself
be saved. But however, I find no opinions in Scripture called damnable, but what
are impious in materia practica, or directly destructive of the Faith or the
body of Christianity, such of which S. Peter speaks [bringing in damnable
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, these are the false Prophets
who out of covetousness make 2 Pet. 2. 1.
merchandise of you through cozening words.] Such as these are truly heresies,
and such as these are certainly damnable. But because there are no degrees
either of truth or salshood, every true proposition being alike true; that an
error is more or less damnable, is not told us in Scripture, but is determind
by the man and his manners, by circumstance and accidents; and therefore the
censure in the Preface and end, are Arguments of his zeal and strength of his
persuasion; but they are extrinsecall and accidental to the Articles, and
might as well have been spared. And indeed to me it seems very hard to put
uncharitableness into the Creed, and so to make it become as an Article of
Faith, though perhaps this very thing was no Faith of Athanasius who if we may
believe Aquinas, made this manifestation of Faitth, non per modum Symboli, sed
per modum doctrinae, D. Tho. 22ae. q. 1. artic. 1. ad ^um.
that is, if I understood him right, not with a purpose to impose it upon
others, but with confidence to declare his own belief; and that it was
prescribed to others as a Creed, was the act of the Bishops of Rome; so he
said, nay, possibly it was none of his: So said the Patriarch of C. P. Meletius
about one hundred and thirty years since, in his Epistle to John Douza,
Athanasio falso adscriptum Symbolum cum Pontificum Romans appendice illa
adulteratum, luce lucidius contestamur. And it is more then probable that he
said true, because this Creed was written originally in Latin, which in all
reason Athanasius did not, and it was translated into Greek, it being apparent
that the Latin Copy is but one, but the Greek is various, there being three
Editions or Translations rather, expressed by Genebrard, lib. 3. de Trinit. But
in this particular, who list, may better satisfy himself in a disputation de
Symbolo Athanasii, printed at Wertzburg 1590 supposed to be written by
Serrarius or Cleneherus.

And yet I must observe that this Symbol of Athanasius, and Numb. 37.
that other of Nice, offer not at any new Articles; they only pretend to a
further Explication of the Articles Apostolical, which is a certain
confirmation that they did not believe more Articles to be of belief necessary
to salvation: if they intended these further Explications to be as necessary as
the dogmaticall Articles of the Apostles Creed, I know not how to answer all
that may be objected against that; but the advantage that I shall gather from
their not proceeding to new matters, is laid out ready for me in the words of
Athanasius, saying of this Creed [this is the Catholic Faith] and if his
authority be good, or his saying true, or he the Author, then no man can say
of any other Article, that it is a part of the Catholic Faith, or that the
Catholic Faith can be enlarged beyond the contents of that Symbol; and
therefore it is a strange boldness in the Church of Rome, first to add twelve
new Articles, Bulla Pii quarti supra forma juramenti professionis fidei, in
fin. Conc. Trident.
and then to add the Appendix of Athanasius to the end of them, This is the
Catholic Faith, without which no man can be saved.

But so great an example of so excellent a man, has been either mistaken or
followed with too much greediness, all Numb. 38.
the world in factions, all damning one another, each party damnd by all the
rest, and there is no disagreeing in opinion from any man that is in love with
his own opinion, but damnation presently to all that disagree. A Ceremony and a
Rite has caused several Churches to Excommunicate each other, as in the
matter of the Saturday Fast, and keeping Easter. But what the spirits of men
are when they are exasperated in a Question and difference of Religion, as they
call it, though the thing it self may be most inconsiderable, is very evident
in that request of Pope Innocent the Third, desiring of the Greeks (but
reasonably a man would think) that they would not so much hate the Roman manner
of consecrating in unleavened bread, as to wash, and scrape, and pare the
Altars after a Roman Priest had consecrated. Nothing more furious than a
mistaken zeal, and the actions of a scrupulous and abused conscience. When men
think every thing to be their Faith and their Religion, commonly they are so
busy in trifles and such impertinencies in which the scene of their mistake
lies, that they neglect the greater things of the Law, charity, and
compliances, and the gentleness of Christian Communion; for this is the great
principle of mischief, and yet is not more pernicious then unreasonable.

For I demand: Can any man say and justify that the Apostles did deny
Communion to any man that believed the Apostles Numb. 39.
Creed, and lived a good life? And dare any man tax that proceeding of
remissness, and indifferency in Religion? And since our blessed Savior
promised salvation to him that believes (and the Apostles when they gave this
word the greatest extent, enlarged it not beyond the borders of the Creed) how
can any man warrant the condemning of any man to the flames of Hell that is
ready to die in attestation of this Faith, so expounded and made explicit by
the Apostles, and lives accordingly? And to this purpose it was excellently
said by a wise and a pious Prelate, S. Hilary, Non per difficiles nos L. 10. de
Trin. ad finem.
Deus ad b^atam vitam quaestiones vocat, etc. In absoluto nobis and facili est
aeternitas; Jesum suscitatum a mortuis, per Deum credere, and ipsum esse
Dominum confiteri, etc. These are the Articles which we must believe which are
the sufficient and adequate object of that Faith which is required of us in
order to Salvation. And therefore it was, that when the Bishops of Istria
Council. tom. 4. Edit. Paris. p. 473.
deserted the Communion of Pope Pelagius, in causa trium Capitulorum, he gives
them an account of his Faith by recitation of the Creed, and by attesting the
four General Councels, and is confident upon this that de fidei firmitate
nulla poterit esse quaestio vel suspicio generari; let the Apostles Creed,
especially so explicated, be but secured, and all Faith is secured; and yet
that explication too, was less necessary then the Articles themselves; for the
explication was but accidental, but the Articles even before the Explication
were accounted a sufficient inlet to the Kingdom of heaven.

And that there was security enough, in the simple believing Numb. 40.
the first Articles, is very certain amongst them, and by their Principles who
allow of an implicit faith to serve most persons to the greatest purposes; for
if the Creed did contain in it the whole Faith, and that other Articles were in
it implicitly, (for such is the doctrine of the School, and particularly of
Aquinas) then he that explicirely believes all the Creed, does implicitly
believe all the Articles contained in it, and then it 22ae. q. 1. a. 10. cap.
is better the implication should still continue, then that by any explication
(which is simply unnecessary) the Church should be troubled with questions, and
uncertain determinations, and factions enkindled, and animosities set on foot,
and men's souls endangered, who before were secured by the explicit belief of
all that the Apostles required as necessary, which belief also did secure them
for all the rest, because it implied the belief of whatsoever was virtually in
the first Articles, if such belief should by chance be necessary.

The sum of this discourse is this, if we take an estimate of the nature of
Faith from the dictates and promises Evangelicall, Numb. 41.
and from the practice Apostolical, the nature of Faith and its integrity
consists in such propositions which make the foundation of hope and charity,
that which is sufficient to make us to do honor to Christ, and to obey him,
and to encourage us in both; and this is completed in the Apostles Creed. And
since contraries are of the same extent, heresy is to be judged by its
proportion and analogy to faith, and that is heresy only which is against
Faith. Now because Faith is not only a precept of Doctrines, but of manners and
holy life, whatsoever is either opposite to an Article of Creed, or teaches ill
life, that is heresy; but all those propositions which are extrinsecall to these
two considerations, be they true or be they false, make not heresy, nor the man
an Heretic; and therefore however he may be an erring person, yet he is to be
used accordingly, pitied and instructed, not condemned or Excommunicated; And
this is the result of the first ground, the consideration of the nature of
Faith and heresy.

SECT. III.
Of the difficulty and uncertainty of Arguments from Scripture, in Questions
not simply necessary, not literally determined.

GOd who disposes of all things sweetly and according to the nature and
capacity of things and persons, had made those Numb. 1.
only necessary, which he had taken care should be sufficiently propounded to
all persons of whom he required the explicit belief. And therefore all the
Articles of Faith are clearly and plainly set down in Scripture, and the
Gospel is not hid nisi pereuntibus says S. Paul; (...), says Damascen, and
that Orthod. fidei. lib. 4. c. 18.
so manifestly that no man can be ignorant of the foundation of Faith without
his own apparent fault. And this is acknowledged by all wise and good men, and
is evident, besides the reasonableness of the thing, in the testimonies of
Saints Super Psalm. 88. and de util. cred. c. 6.
Austin, Super Isa. c. 19 and in Psalm. 86.
Hierome, Homil. 3. in These. Ep. 2.
Chrysostom, Sermon de confess.
Fulgentius, Miseel. 2. l. 1. tit. 46.
Hugo de Sancto Victore, In Genesis ap. Struch p. 87.
Theodoret, C. 6. c. 21.
Lactantius, Ad Antioch. l. 2. p. 918.
Theophilus Antiochenus, Par. 1. q. 1. art. 9 Numb. 2.
Aquinas, and the latter School men. And God has done more; for many things
which are only profitable, are also set down so plainly, that (as S. Austin
says) nemo inde haurire non possit, si modo ad hauriendum devote ac pie
accedat (ubi supra de util. cred. c. 6.) but of such things there is no
Question commenced in Christendom, and if there were, it cannot but be a crime
and humane interest, that are the Authors of such disputes, and therefore these
cannot be simple errors, but always heresies, because the principle of them
is a personal sin.

But besides these things which are so plainly set down, some for doctrine as
S. Paul says, that is, for Articles and foundation of Faith, some for
instruction, some for reproof, some for comfort, that is, in matters
practical and speculative of several tempers and constitutions, there are
innumerable places containing in them great mysteries, but yet either so
enwrapped with a cloud, or so darkened with umbrages, or heigthened with
expressions, or so covered with allegories and garments of Rhetoric so
profound in the matter, or so altered or made intricate in the manner in the
clothing and in the dressing that God may seem to have left them as trials of
our industry, and Arguments of our imperfections, and incentives to the
longings after heaven, and the clearest revelations of eternity, and as
occasions and opportunities of our mutual charity and toleration to each
other, and humility in our selves, rather then the repositories of Faith, and
furniture of Creeds, and Articles of belief.

For wherever the word of God is kept, whether in Scripture Numb. 3.
alone, or also in Tradition, he that considers that the meaning of the one,
and the truth or certainty of the other are things of great Question, will see
a necessity in these things (which are the subject matter of most of the
Questions of Christendom) that men should hope to be excused by an implicit
faith in God Almighty. For when there are in the Explications of Scripture so
many Commentaries, so many senses and Interpretations, so many Volumnes in all
Ages, and all, like men's faces, exactly none like another, either this
difference and inconvenience is absolutely no fault at all, or if it be, it is
excusable, by a mind prepared to consent in that truth which God intended. And
this I call an implicit Faith in God, which is certainly of as great
excellency as an implicit Faith in any man or company of men. Because they who
do require an implicit Faith in the Church for Articles less necessary, and
excuse the want of explicit Faith by the implicit, do require an implicit
Faith in the Church, because they believe that God has required of them to
have a mind prepared to believe whatever the Church says; which because it is
a proposition of no absolute certainty, whosoever does in readiness of mind
believe all that God spoke, does also believe that sufficiently, if it be
fitting to be believed, that is, if it be true, and if God has said so; for he
has the same obedience of understanding in this as in the other. But because
it is not so certain God has tied him in all things to believe that which is
called the Church, and that it is certain we must believe God in all things,
and yet neither know all that either God has revealed or the Church taught, it
is better to take the certain then the uncertain, to believe God rather then
men, especially since if God has bound us to believe men, our absolute
submission to God does involve that, and there is no inconvenience in the world
this way, but that we implicitly believe one Article more, viz. the Churches
Authority or infallibility, which may well be pardoned, because it secures our
belief of all the rest, and we are sure if we believe all that God said
explicitly or implicitly, we also believe the Church implicitly in case we
are bound to it; but we are not certain, that if we believe any company of men
whom we call the Church, that we therefore obey God and believe what he has
said. But however, if this will not help us, there is no help for us, but good
fortune or absolute predestination; for by choice and industry, no man can
secure himself that in all the mysteries of Religion taught in Scripture he
shall certainly understand and explicitly believe that sense, that God
intended. For to this purpose there are many considerations.

1. There are so many thousands of Copies that were writ by persons of several
interests and persuasions, such different Numb. 4.
understandings and tempers, such distinct abilities and weaknesses, that it is
no wonder there is so great variety of readings both in the Old Testament and
in the New. In the Old Testament the Jews pretend that the Christians have
corrupted many places, on purpose to make symphony between both the Testaments.
On the other side, the Christians have had so much reason to suspect the Jews,
that when Aquila had translated the Bible in their Schools, and had been
taught by them, they rejected the Edition many of them, and some of them called
it heresy to follow it. And Justin Martyr justified it to Tryphon, that the
Jews had defalk'd many sayings from the Books of the old Prophets, and amongst
the rest, he instances in that of the Psalm, Dicite in nationibus quia Dominus
regnavit a ligno. The last words they have cut off, and prevailed so far in
it, that to this day none of our Bibles have it; but if they ought not to have
it, then Justin Martyrs Bible had more in it then it should have, for there it
was; so that a fault there was either under or over. But however, there are
infinite Readings in the New Testament (for in that I will instance) some whole
Verses in one that are not in another, and there was in some Copies of S. Marks
Gospel in the last Chapter a whole verse, a Chapter it was anciently called,
that is not found in our Bibles, as S. Hierom. ad Hedibiam, q. 3. notes. The
words he repeats, Lib. 2. contra Polygamos. Et illi satis faciebant dicentes,
saeculum istud iniquitatis and incredulitatis sub stantia est, quae non sinit
per immundos spiritus veram Dei apprehendi virtutem, idcirco jam nunc revela
justitiam tuam. These words are thought by some, to favor of Manichaisme, and
for ought I can find were therefore rejected out of many Greek Copies, and at
last out of the Latin. Now suppose that a Manichee in disputation should urge
this place, having found it in his Bible, if a Catholic should answer him by
saying it is Apocryphal, and not found in diverse Greek Copies, might not the
Manichee ask how it came in, if it was not the word of God, and if it was, how
came it out? and at last take the same liberty of rejecting any other Authority
which shall be alleged against him; it he can find any Copy that may favor
him, however that favor be procured; and did not the Ebionites reject all the
Epistles of S. Paul upon pretense he was an enemy to the Law of Moses? indeed
it was boldly and most unreasonably done; but if one title or one Chapter of S.
Mark be called Apocryphal, for being suspected of Manicheisme, it is a plea
that will too much justify others in their taking and choosing what they list.
But I will not urge it so far; but is not there as much reason for the fierce
Lutherans to reject the Epistle of S. James for favoring justification by
works, or the Epistle to the Hebrews, upon pretense that the sixth and tenth
Chapters do favor Novatianisme; especially since it was by some famous
Churches at first not accepted, even by the Church of Rome her self? The
Parable of the woman taken in adultery, which is now in Joh. 8. Eusebius says
was not in any Gospel, but the Gospel secundum Hebraeos, and S. Hierom makes it
doubtful, and so does S. Chrysostom and Euthimius, the first not vouchsafing
to explicate it in Homilies upon S. John, the other affirming it not to be
found in the exacter Copies. I shall not need to urge that there are some
words so near in sound, that the Scribes might easily mistake: There is one
famous one of (...), which yet some Copies read (...), the sense is very unlike
though the words be near, and there needs some little luxation to strain this
latter reading to a good sense; That famous precept of S. Paul, that the women
must pray with a covering on their head (...), because of the Angels, has
brought into the Church an opinion that Angels are present in Churches, and are
Spectators of our devotion and deportment. Such an opinion if it should meet
with peevish opposites on one side, and confident Hyperaspists on the other,
might possibly make a Sect, and here were a clear ground for the affirmative,
and yet who knows but that it might have been a mistake of the Transcribers to
double the (...)? for if it were read (...), that the sense be, women in
public Assemblies must wear a veil, by reason of the Companies of the young
men there present, it would be no ill exchange for the loss of a letter, to
make so probable so clear a sense of the place. But the instances in this
kind, are too many, as appears in the variety of readings in several Copies
proceeding from the negligence or ignorance of the Transcribers, or the
malicious Graeci corruperunt novum Testamentum ut testantur Tertul. l. 5. adv.
Marcion. Eusebius. l. 5. Hist. c. ult. Irenae. l. 1. c. 29. allu. haerel. Basil.
l. 2. contr. Eunomium.
endeavor of Heretics, or the inserting Marginall Notes into the Text, or the
neerenesse of several words. Indeed there is so much evidence of this
particular, that it has encouraged the servants of the Vulgar Translation (for
so some are now adays) to prefer that Translation before the Original; for
although they have attempted that proposition with very ill success yet that
they could think it possible to be proved, is an Argument there is much variety
and alterations in diverse Texts; for if they were not, it were impudence to
pretend a Translation, and that none of the best, should be better then the
Original. But so it is that this variety of reading is not of slight
consideration; for although it be demonstrably true, that all things necessary
to Faith and good manners are preserved from alteration and corruption, because
they are of things necessary, and they could not be necessary, unless they
were delivered to us, God in his goodness and his justice having obliged
himself to preserve that which he has bound us to observe and keep; yet in
other things which God has not obliged himself so punctually to preserve, in
these things since variety of reading is crept in, every reading takes away a
degree of certainty from any proposition derivative from those places so read:
And if some Copies (especially if they be public and notable) omit a verse or
title, every argument from such a title or verse loses much of its strength and
reputation; and we find it in a great instance. For when in probation of the
mystery of the glorious Unity in Trinity, we allege that saying of S. John
[there are three which bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word and the
Spirit, and these three are one:] the Antitrinitarians think they have answered
the Argument by saying the Syrian Translation, and diverse Greek Copies have not
that verse in them, and therefore being of doubtful Authority, cannot conclude
with certainty in a Question of Faith. And there is an instance on the
Catholic part. For when the Arrians urge the saying of our Savior, [No man
knows that day and hour (viz. of Judgment) no not the Son, but the Father
only], to prove that the Son knows not all things, and therefore cannot be
God in the proper sense; S. Ambrose thinks he has answered the Argument by
saying, those words [no not the Sonne] was thrust into the Text by the fraud of
the Arrians. So that here we have one objection, which must first be cleared
and made infallible, before we can be ascertained in any such Question as to
call them Heretics that dissent.

2. I consider that there are very many senses and designs of Numb. 5.
expounding Scripture, and when the Grammatical sense is found out, we are
many times never the nearer; it is not that which was intended; for there is in
very many Scriptures a double sense, a literal and a Spiritual (for the
Scripture is a Book written within and without (Apoc. 5.) And both these senses
are sub-divided. For the literal sense is either natural or figurative: And
the Spiritual is sometimes allegorical, sometimes anogogicall, nay, sometimes
there are diverse literal senses in the same sentence, as S. Austin excellently
proves in diverse Lib. 12. confess, cap. 26. Lib. 11. de Civit. Dei. c. 19. Li.
3. de doctrina Christ. cap. 27.
places, and it appears in diverse quotations in the New Testament, where the
Apostles and Divine Writers bring the same Testimony to diverse purposes; and
particularly, S. Paul's making that saying of the Psalm, Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee, to be an Argument of Christ's Resurrection, and a
designation or ordination to his Pontificate is an instance very famous in his
1. and 5. chapter to the Hebrews. But now there being such variety of senses
in Scripture, and but few places so marked out, as not to be capable of diverse
senses, if men will write Commentaries, as Herod made Orations (...), what
infallible (...) will be left whereby to judge of the certain dogmaticall
resolute sense of such places which have been the matter of Question? For put
case a Question were commenced concerning the degrees of glory in heaven, as
there is in the Schools a noted one, To show an inequality of reward, Christ's
Parable is brought of the reward of ten Cities, and of five according to the
diverse improvement of the Talents; this sense is mystical, and yet very
probable, and understood by men for ought I know, to this very sense. And the
result of the Argument is made good by S. Paul, as one star differs from
another in glory; so shall it be in the resurrection of the dead. Now suppose
another should take the same liberty of Expounding another Parable to a
mystical sense and Interpretation, as all Parables must be expounded; then the
Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard, and though differing in labor, yet
having an equal reward, to any man's understanding may seem very strongly to
prove the contrary, and as if it were of purpose, and that it were primum
intentum of the Parable, the Lord of the Vineyard determined the point
resolutely upon the mutiny and repining of them that had born the burden and
heat of the day, I will give unto this last even as to thee; which to my sense
seems to determine the Question of degrees; They that work but little, and they
that work long, shall not be distinguished in the reward, though accidentally
they were in the work: And if this opinion could but answer S. Paul's words, it
stands as fair, and perhaps fairer then the other. Now if we look well upon
the words of S. Paul, we shall find he speaks nothing at all of diversity of
degrees of glory in beatified bodies, but the differences of glory in bodies
heavenly and earthly. There are (says he) bodies earthly, and there are
heavenly bodies: And one is the glory of the earthly, another the glory of the
heavenly; one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, etc. So shall it be in
the Resurrection; for it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.
Plainly thus, our bodies in the Resurrection shall differ as much from our
bodies here in the state of corruption, as one Star does from another. And
now suppose a Sect should be commenced upon this Question (upon lighter and
vainer many have been) either side must resolve to answer the others Arguments,
whether they can or no, and to deny to each other a liberty of expounding the
parable to such a sense, and yet themselves must use it or want an Argument.
But men use to be unjust in their own cases; And were it not better to leave
each other to their liberty and seek to preserve their own charity? For when
the words are capable of a mystical or a diverse sense, I know not why men's
fancies or understandings should be more bound to be like one another then
their faces: And either in all such places of Scripture, a liberty must be
indulged to every honest and peaceable wise man, or else all Argument from such
places must be wholly declined. Now although I instanced in a Question, which by
good fortune never came to open defiance, yet there have been Sects framed upon
lighter grounds, more inconsiderable Questions, which have been disputed on
either side with Arguments less material and less pertinent. S. Austin
laughed at the Donatists, for bringing that saying of the Spouse in the
Canticles to prove their Schism, Indica mihi ubi pascas, ubi cubes in meridie.
For from thence they concluded the residence of the Church was only in the
South part of the world, only in Africa. It was but a weak way of Argument; yet
the Fathers were free enough to use such mediums, to prove mysteries of great
Hieron. in Matthew. 13.
concernment; but yet again, when they speak either against an Adversary, or
with consideration, they deny that such mystical senses can sufficiently
confirm a Question of Faith. But I shall instance in the great Question of
Rebaptization of Heretics, which many Saints, and Martyrs, and Confessors, and
diverse Counsels, and almost all Asia and Africa did once believe and practice.
Their grounds for the invalidity of the baptism by a Heretic, were such
mystical words as these, Oleum peccatoris non impinguet caput meum Ps. 140.
And Qui baptizatur a mortuo, quid proficit lavatio ejus? Ecclus 34. And ab aqua
aliena abstinete, Prove. 5. And Deus peccatores non exaudit, Joh. 9. And he that
is not with me is against me, Luke 11. I am not sure the other part had
Arguments so good. For the great one of una fides, unum baptisma, did not
conclude it to their understandings who were of the other opinion, and men
famous in their generations; for it was no Argument that they who had been
baptized by John's baptism should not be baptized in the name of Jesus, because
unus Deus, unum baptisma; and as it is still one Faith which a man confesses
several times, and one Sacrament of the Eucharist, though a man often
communicates; so it might be one baptism though often ministered. And the unity
of baptism might not be derived from the unity of the ministration, but from
the unity of the Religion into which they are baptized; though baptized a
thousand times, yet because it was still in the name of the holy Trinity, still
into the death of Christ, it might be unum baptisma. Whether S. Cyprian,
Firmilian, and their Colleagues had this discourse or no (I know not) I am sure
they might have had much better to have evacuated the force of that Argument,
although I believe they had the wrong cause in hand. But this is it that I say,
that when a Question is so undetermined in Scripture, that the Arguments rely
only upon such mystical places whence the best fancies can draw the greatest
variety, and such which perhaps were never intended by the holy Ghost, it were
good the rivers did not swell higher then the fountain, and the confidence
higher then the Argument and evidence; for in this case there could not any
thing be so certainly proved, as that the disagreeing party should deserve to
be condemned by a sentence of Excommunication for disbelieving it, and yet they
were; which I wonder at so much the more, because they (who as it was since
judged) had the right cause, had not any sufficient Argument from Scripture,
not so much as such mystical Arguments, but did fly to the Tradition of the
Church, in which also I shall afterward show, they had nothing that was
absolutely certain.

3. I consider that there are diverse places of Scripture containing Numb. 6.
in them mysteries and Questions of great concernment, and yet the fabric and
constitution is such, that there is no certain mark to determine whether the
sense of them should be literal or figurative; I speak not here concerning
extrinsecall means of determination, as traditive Interpretation, Councels,
Fathers, Popes, and the like; I shall consider them afterward in their several
places; but here the subject matter being concerning Scripture in its own
capacity, I say there is nothing in the nature of the thing to determine the
sense and meaning, but it must be gotten out as it can; and that therefore it
is unreasonable, that what of it self is ambiguous should be understood in its
own prime sense and intention, under the pain of either a sin or an
Anathema; I instance in that famous place from whence has sprung that Question
of Transubstantiation, Hoc est corpus meum. The words are plain and clear, apt
to be understood in the literal sense and yet this sense is so hard as it does
violence to reason, and therefore it is the Question whether or no it be not a
figurative speech. But here what shall we have to determine it? What mean
soever we take, and to what sense soever you will expound it, you shall be put
to give an account why you expound other places of Scripture in the same case
to quite contrary senses. For if you expound it literally, then besides that it
seems to entrench upon the words of our blessed Savior, The words that I speak
they are Spirit and they are life, that is, to be spiritually understood (and
it is a miserable thing to see what wretched shifts are used to reconcile the
literal sense to these words, and yet to distinguish it from the
Capernaiticall fancy) but besides this, why are not those other sayings of
Christ expounded literally, I am a Vine, I am the Door, I am a Rock? Why do
we fly to a figure in those parallel words? This is the Covenant which I make
between me and you; and yet that Covenant was but the sign of the Covenant; and
why do we fly to a figure in a precept, as well as in mystery and a
proposition? If thy right hand offend thee cut it off; and yet we have figures
enough to save a limb. If it be said because reason tells us these are not to
be expounded according to the letter; This will be no plea for them who retain
the literal exposition of the other instance* against all reason, against all
Philosophy, against all sense, and against two or three sciences. But if you
expound these words figuratively, besides that you are to contest against a
world of prejudices you give your self the liberty, which if others will use
when either they have a reason or a necessity so to do, they may perhaps turn
all into Allegory, and so may evacuate any precept, and elude any Argument.
Well, so it is that very wise men have expounded things Sic S Hieron. In ad
^es^entia provocatus ardore and studio Scriptuarum allegorice interpretatus sum
Abdiam Prophetam, cujus historiam nesciebam. De sensu Allegorico S. Script.
dixit Basilius, (...).
Allegorically, when they should have expounded them literally. So did the
famous Origin, who as S. Hierom reports of him, turned Paradise so into an
Allegory, that he took away quite the truth of the Story, and not only Adam was
turned out of the Garden, but the Garden it self out of Paradise. Others
expound things literally when they should understand them in Allegory; so did
the Ancient Papias understand (Apocal. 20.) Christ's Millenary reign upon earth,
and so, depressed the hopes of Christianity and their desires to the longing
and expectation of temporal pleasures and satisfactions, and he was followed
by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Lactantius, and indeed the whole Church
generally till S. Austin and S. Hierom's time who first of any whose works are
extant did reprove the error. If such great spirits be deceived in finding out
what kind of senses L. 23. de Civit. Dei, c 7. praefat. ^. 19. in Isai. and in
c. 36. Ezekiel.
be to be given to Scriptures, it may well be endured that we who sit at their
feet, may also tread in the steps of them whose feet could not always tread
aright.

4. I consider that there are some places of Scripture that Numb. 7.
have the self same expressions, the same preceptive words, the same reason
and account in all appearance, and yet either must be expounded to quite
different senses, or else we must renounce the Communion, and the charities of
a great part of Christendom. And yet there is absolutely nothing in the thing
or in its circumstances, or in its adjuncts that can determine it to different
purposes. I instance in those great exclusive negatives for the necessity of
both Sacraments. Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua etc. Nisi manducaveritis
carnem filii hominis, etc. a non introibit in regnum coelorum for both these.
Now then the first is urged for the absolute indispensable necessity of baptism
even in Infants, insomuch that Infants go to part of Hell if (inculpably both
on their own and their Parents part) they miss of baptism, for that is the
doctrine of the Church of Rome, which they learnt from S. Austin, and others
also do from hence baptize Infants, though with a less opinion of its
absolute necessity. And yet the same manner of precept in the same form of
words, in the same manner of threatening, by an exclusive negative, shall not
enjoin us to communicate Infants, though damnation (at least in form of words)
be exactly and per omnia alike appendant to the neglect of holy Baptism and the
venerable Eucharist. If [nisi quis renatus] shall conclude against the
Anabaptist, for necessity of baptizing Infants (as sure enough we say, it does)
why shall not an equal [nisi comederitis] bring Infants to the holy Communion?
The Primitive Church for some two whole Ages did follow their own principles,
where ever they lead them; and seeing that upon the same ground equal results
must follow, they did Communicate Infants as soon as they had baptized them.
And why the Church of Rome should not do so too, being she expounds [nisi
comederitis] of orall manducation, I cannot yet learn a reason. And for others
that expound it of a spiritual manducation, why they shall not allow the
disagreeing part the same liberty of expounding [nisi quis renatus] too, I by
no means can understand. And in these cases no external determiner can be
pretended in answer. For whatsoever is extrinsecall to the words, as Councels,
Tradition, Church Authority, and Fathers, either have said nothing at all, or
have concluded by their practice contrary to the present opinion, as is plain
in their communicating Infants by virtue of [nisi comederitis.]

5. I shall not need to urge the mysteriousnesse of some points in Scripture,
which ex natura rei are hard to be understood Numb. 8.
though very plainly represented. For there are some secreta Theologiae, which
are only to be understood by persons very holy and spiritual, which are rather
to be felt then discoursed of, and therefore if peradventure they be offered to
public consideration, they will therefore be opposed because they run the
same fortune with many other Questions, that is, not to be understood, and so
much the rather because their understanding, that is, the feeling such secrets
of the Kingdom, are not the results of Logic and Philosophy, nor yet of
public revelation, but of the public spirit privately working, and in no man
is a duty but in all that have it, is a reward, and is not necessary for all,
but given to some, producing its operations, not regularly, but upon occasions,
personal necessities and new emergencies. Of this nature are the spirit of
obsignation, belief of particular salvation, special influences and comforts
coming from a sense of the spirit of adoption, actual fervours and great
complacencies in devotion spiritual joys, which are little drawings aside of
the curtains of peace and eternity, and antepasts of immortality. But the not
understanding the perfect constitution and temper of these mysteries (and it is
hard for any man so to understand, as to make others do so too that feel them
not) is cause that in many Questions of secret Theology, by being very apt and
easy to be mistaken, there is a necessity in forbearing one another; and this
consideration would have been of good use in the Question between Soto and
Catharinus, both for the preservation of their charity and explication of the
mystery.

6. But here it will not be unseasonable to consider, that Numb. 9.
all systems and principles of science are expressed so that either by reason
of the Universality of the terms and subject matter or the infinite variety of
humane understandings, and these peradventure swayed by interest, or determined
by things accidental and extrinsecall, they seem to diverse men, nay to the
same men upon diverse occasions to speak things extremly disparate and sometimes
contrary, but very often of great variety. And this very thing happens also in
Scripture; that if it were not in re sacra and seria, it were excellent sport
to observe how the same place of Scripture serves several turns upon occasion,
and they at that time believe the words sound nothing else, whereas in the
liberty of their judgment and abstracting from that occasion, their
Commentaries understand them wholly to a differing sense. It is a wonder of what
excellent use to the Church of Rome, is [tibi dabo claves:] It was spoken to
Peter and none else (sometimes) and therefore it concerns him and his
Successors only; the rest are to derive from him. And yet if you Question them
for their Sacrament of Penance, and Priestly Absolution, then tibi dabo claves
comes in, and that was spoken to S. Peter, and in him to the whole College of
the Apostles, and in them to the whole Hierarchy. If you question why the Pope
pretends to free souls from Purgatory, tibi dabo claves is his warrant; but if
you tell him the Keys are only for binding and loosing on Earth directly, and
in Heaven consequently; and that Purgatory is a part of Hell, or rather neither
Earth nor Heaven nor Hell, and so the Keys seem to have nothing to do with
it, then his Commission is to be enlarged by a suppletory of reason and
consequences, and his Keys shall unlock this difficulty; for it is clavis
scientiae as well as authoritatis. And these Keys shall enable him to expound
Scriptures infallibly, to determine Questions, to preside in Councels, to
dictate to all the World Magisterially, to rule the Church, to dispense with
Oaths, to abrogate Laws: And if his Key of knowledge will not, the Key of
Authority shall, and tibi dabo claves shall answer for all. We have an instance
in the single fancy of one man, what rare variety of matter is afforded from
those plain words of [Oravi pro te Petre] Luke 22. for that place says
Bellarmine, is otherwise to be understood of Peter, otherwise of the Popes, and
otherwise of the Church of Rome. And [pro te] Bellar. lib. 1. de Pontif. c. 3.
respondeo primo.
signifies that Christ prayed that Peter might neither err personally nor
judicially, and that Peter's Successors if they did err personally, might not
err judicially, and that the Roman Church might not err personally. All this
variety of sense is pretended by the fancy of one man, to be in a few words
which are as plain and simple as are any words in Scripture. And what then in
those thousands that are intricate? So is done with pasce oves, which a man
would think were a commission as innocent and guiltless of designs, as the
sheep in the folds are. But if it be asked why the Bishop of Rome calls
himself Universal Bishop, pasce oves is his warrant? Why he pretends to a
power of deposing Princes, Pasce oves, said Christ to Peter, the second time.
If it be demanded why also he pretends to a power of authorizing his subjects
to kill him, Pasce agnos said Christ the third time: And pasce is doce, and
pasce is Impera, and pasce is occide. Now if others should take the same
(unreasonablenesse I will not say, but the same) liberty in expounding
Scripture, or if it be not license taken, but that the Scripture it self is so
full and redundant in senses quite contrary, what man soever, or what company
of men soever shall use this principle, will certainly find such rare
productions from several places, that either the unreasonablenesse of the
thing will discover the error of the proceeding, or else there will be a
necessity of permitting a great liberty of judgment, where is so infinite
variety without limit or mark of necessary determination. If the first, then
because an error is so obvious and ready to our selves, it will be great
imprudence or tyranny to be hasty in judging others; but if the latter, it is
it that I contend for: for it is most unreasonable, when either the thing it
self ministers variety, or that we take license to our selves in variety of
interpretations, or proclaim to all the world our great weakness, by our
actually being deceived, that we should either prescribe to others
magisterially when we are in error, or limit their understandings when the
thing it self affords liberty and variety.

SECT. IV.
Of the difficulty of Expounding Scripture.

THese considerations are taken from the nature of Scripture it self; but then
if we consider that we have no certain Numb. 1.
ways of determining places of difficulty and Question, infallibly and
certainly, but that we must hope to be saved in the belief of things plain,
necessary and fundamental, and our pious endeavor to find out Gods meaning
in such places which he has left under a cloud for other great ends reserved
to his own knowledge, we shall see a very great necessity in allowing a liberty
in Prophesying without prescribing authoritatively to other men's consciences,
and becoming Lords and Masters of their Faith. Now the means of expounding
Scripture are either external, or internal. For the external, as Church
Authority, Tradition, Fathers, Councels and Decrees of Bishops, they are of a
distinct consideration, and follow after in their order. But here we will first
consider the invalidity and uncertainty of all those means of expounding
Scripture which are more proper and internal to the nature of the thing. The
great Masters of Commentaries, some whereof have undertaken to know all
mysteries, have propounded many ways to expound Scripture, which indeed are
excellent helps, but not infallible assistances, both because themselves are
but moral instruments which force not truth ex abscondito, as also because
they are not infallibly used and applied. 1. Sometime the sense is drawn forth
by the context and connection of parts: It is well when it can be so. But when
there is two or three antecedents, and subjects spoken of, what man or what
rule shall ascertain me that I make my reference true by drawing the relation
to such an antecedent; to which I have a mind to apply it, another has not.
For in a contexture where one part does not always depend upon another, Where
things of differing natures intervene and interrupt the first intentions, there
it is not always very probable to expound Scripture, take its meaning by its
proportion to the neighboring words. But who desires satisfaction in this, may
read the observation verified in S. Gregory's moralls upon Job, lib. 5. c. 29.
and the instances he there brings are excellent proof, that this way of
Interpretation does not warrant any man to impose his Expositions upon the
belief and understanding of other men too confidently and magisterially.

2. Another great pretense of medium is the conference of places, which
Illyricus calls ingens remedium and faelicissimam expositionem Numb. 2.
sanctae scripturae; and indeed so it is if well and temperately used; but then
we are beholding to them that do so; for there is no rule that can constrain
them to it; for comparing of places is of so indefinite capacity, that if there
be ambiguity of words, variety of sense, alteration of circumstances, or
difference of style amongst Divine Writers, then there is nothing that may be
more abused by wilful people, or may more easily deceive the unwary, or that
may amuse the most intelligent Observer. The Anabaptists take advantage enough
in this proceeding, (and indeed so may any one that list) and when we pretend
against them the necessity of baptizing all, by authority of nisi quis renatus
fuerit ex aqua and spiritu, they have a parallel for it, and tell us that
Christ will baptize us with the holy Ghost and with fire, and that one place
expounds the other; and because by fire is not meant an Element or any thing
that is natural, but an Allegory and figurative expression of the same thing;
so also by water may be meant the figure signifying the effect or manner of
operation of the holy Spirit. Fire in one place, and water in the other, do
but represent to us that Christ's baptism is nothing else but the cleansing and
purifying us by the holy Ghost; But that which I here note as of greatest
concernment, and which in all reason ought to be an utter overthrow to this
topique, is an universal abuse of it among those that use it most, and when
two places seem to have the same expression, or if a word have a double
signification, because in this place it may have such a sense, therefore it
must, because in one of the places the sense is to their purpose, they conclude
that therefore it must be so in the other too. An instance I give in the great
Question between the Socinians and the Catholics. If any place be urged in
which our blessed Savior is called God, they show you two or three where the
word God is taken in a depressed sense, for a quasi Deus, as when God said to
Moses, Constitui te Deum Pharaonis; and hence they argue, because I can show
the word is used for a Deus factus, therefore no Argument is sufficient to
prove Christ to be Deus verus from the appellative of Deus. And might not
another argue to the exact contrary, and as well urge that Moses is Deus verus,
because in some places the word Deus is used pro Deo aeterno: Both ways the
Argument concludes impiously and unreasonably. It is a fallacy a posse ad esse
affirmative; because breaking of bread is sometimes used for an Eucharisticall
manducation in Scripture; therefore I shall not from any testimony of Scripture
affirming the first Christians to have broken bread together, conclude that
they lived hospitably and in common society. Because it may possibly be eluded,
therefore it does not signify any thing. And this is the great way of
answering all the Arguments that can be brought against any thing that any man
has a mind to defend; and any man that reads any controversies of any side,
shall find as many instances of this vanity almost as he finds Arguments from
Scripture; this fault was of old noted by S. Austin, for then they had got the
trick, and he is angry at it, neque enim putare debemus De doctri. Christian.
lib. 3.
esse praescriptum, ut quod in aliquo loco res aliqua per similitudinem
significaverit, hoc etiam semper significare credamus.

3. Oftentimes Scriptures are pretended to be expounded by Numb. 3.
a proportion and Analogy of reason. And this is as the other, if it be well,
its well. But unless there were some intellectus universalis furnished with
infallible propositions, by referring to which every man might argue
infallibly, this Logic may deceive as well as any of the rest. For it is with
reason as with men's tastes; although there are some general principles which
are reasonable to all men, yet every man is not able to draw out all its
consequences, nor to understand them when they are drawn forth, nor to believe
when he does understand them. There is a precept of S. Paul directed to the
Thessalonians before they were gathered into a body of a Church, 2 These. 3. 6.
To withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly. But if this precept
were now observed, I would feign know whether we should not fall into that
inconvenience which S. Paul sought to avoid in giving the same commandment to
the Church of Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. 9. I wrote to you that ye should not company
with fornicators; And yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world,
for then ye must go out of the world: And therefore he restrains it to a
quitting the society of Christians living ill lives. But now that all the world
has been Christians, if we should sin in keeping company with vicious
Christians, must we not also go out of this world? Is not the precept made
null, because the reason is altered, and things are come about, and that the
(...) are the brethren (...) called brethren, as S. Paul's phrase is? And yet
either this never was considered, or not yet believed; for it is generally
taken to be obligatory, though (I think) seldom practiced. But when we come to
expound Scriptures to a certain sense by Arguments drawn from prudentiall
motives, then we are in a vast plain without any sufficient guide, and we shall
have so many senses, as there are humane prudences. But that which goes further
then this, is a parity of reason from a plain place of Scripture to an obscure,
from that which is plainly set down in a Text to another that is more remote
from it. And thus is that place in S. Matthew forced, If thy brother refuse to
be amended, Dic ecclesiae. Hence some of the Roman Doctors argue, If Christ
commands to tell the Church in case of adultery or private injury, then much
more in case of heresy. Well, suppose this to be a good Interpretation; Why
must I stay here? Why may not I also add by a parity of reason, If the Church
must be told of heresy, much more of treason: And why may not I reduce all
sins to the cognizance of a Church tribunal, as some men do indirectly, and
Snecanus does heartily and plainly? If a man's principles be good, and his
deductions certain, he need not care whether they carry him. But when an
Authority is entrusted to a person, and the extent of his power expressed in
his commission, it will not be safety to meddle beyond his commission upon
confidence of a parity of reason. To instance once more; When Christ in pasce
oves and tu es Petrus, gave power to the Pope to govern the Church (for to that
sense the Church of Rome expounds those Authorities) by a certain consequence
of reason, say they, he gave all things necessary for exercise of this
jurisdiction, and therefore in pasce oves] he gave him an indirect power over
temporalls, for that is necessary that he may do his duty: Well, having gone
thus far, we will go further upon the parity of reason, therefore he has
given the Pope the gift of tongues, and he has given him power to give it; for
how else shall Xavier convert the Indians? He has given him also power to
command the Seas and the winds, that they should obey him, for this also is
very necessary in some cases. And so pasce oves is accipe donum linguarum, and
Impera ventis, and dispone regum diademata, and laicorum praedia, and
influentias caeli too, and whatsoever the parity of reason will judge equally
necessary in order to pasce ovts; when a man does speak reason, it is but
reason he should be heard; but though he may have the good fortune, or the
great abilities to do it, yet he has not a certainty, no regular infallible
assistance, no inspiration of Arguments and deductions; and if he had, yet
because it must be reason that must judge of reason, unless other men's
understandings were of the same air, the same constitution and ability, they
cannot be prescribed unto, by another man's reason; especially because such
reasonings as usually are in explication of particular places of Scripture,
depend upon minute circumstances and particularities, in which it is so easy to
be deceived, and so hard to speak reason regularly and always, that it is the
greater wonder if we be not deceived.

4. Others pretend to expound Scripture by the analogy of Numb. 4.
Faith, and that is the most sure and infallible way (as it is thought:) But
upon stricter survey it is but a Chimera, a thing in nubibus which varies like
the right hand and left hand of a Pillar, and at the best is but like the Coast
of a Country to a Traveller out of his way; It may bring him to his journeyes
end though twenty mile about; it may keep him from running into the Sea, and
from mistaking a river for dry land; but whether this little path or the other
be the right way it tells not. So is the analogy of Faith, that is, if I
understand it right, the rule of Faith, that is the Creed. Now were it not a
fine device to go to expound all the Scripture by the Creed, there being in it
so many thousand places which have no more relation to any Article in the
Creed, then they have to Tityre tu patula? Indeed if a man resolves to keep the
analogy of Faith, that is to expound Scripture, so as not to do any violence
to any fundamental Article, he shall be sure however he erres, yet not to
destroy Faith, he shall not perish in his Exposition. And that was the precept
given by S. Paul, that all Prophesyings should be estimated (...), Romans 6. 12.
and to this very purpose, S. Austin in his Exposition of Genesis, by way of
Preface sets down the Articles of Faith, with this design and protestation of
it, that if he says nothing against those Articles, though he miss the
particular sense of the place, there is no danger, or sin in his Exposition;
but how that analogy of Faith should have any other influence in expounding
such places in which those Articles of Faith are neither expressed, nor
involved, I understand not. But then if you extend the analogy of Faith further
then that which is proper to the rule of Symbol of Faith, then every man
expounds Scripture according to the analogy of Faith; but what? His own Faith:
which Faith if it be questioned, I am no more bound to expound according to the
analogy of another man's Faith, then he to expound according to the analogy of
mine. And this is it that is complained on of all sides that overvalue their
own opinions. Scripture seems so clearly to speak what they believe, that they
wonder all the world does not see it as clear as they do; but they satisfy
themselves with saying that it is because they come with prejudice, whereas if
they had the true belief, that is, theirs, they would easily see what they
see. And this is very true: For if they did believe as others believe, they
would expound Scriptures to their sense; but if this be expounding according to
the analogy of Faith, it signifies no more then this, Be you of my mind and
then my Arguments will seem concluding and my Authorities and Allegations
pressing and pertinent: And this will serve on all sides, and therefore will
do but little service to the determination of Questions, or prescribing to
other men's consciences on any side.

Lastly, Consulting the Originals is thought a great matter Numb. 5.
to Interpretation of Scriptures. But this is to small purpose: For indeed it
will expound the Hebrew and the Greek, and rectify Translations. But I know no
man that says that the Scriptures in Hebrew and Greek are easy and certain
to be understood, and that they are hard in Latin and English: The difficulty
is in the thing however it be expressed, the least is in the language. If the
Original Languages were our mother tongue, Scripture is not much the easier to
us; and a natural Greek or a Jew, can with no more reason, nor authority
obtrude his Interpretations upon other men's consciences, then a man of another
Nation. Add to this that the inspection of the Original, is no more certain
way of Interpretation of Scripture now then it was to the Fathers and Primitive
Ages of the Church; and yet he that observes what infinite variety of
Translations of the Bible were in the first Ages of the Church (as S. Hierom
observes) and never a one like another; will think that we shall differ as much
in our Interpretations as they did, and that the medium is as uncertain to us
as it was to them; and so it is; witness the great number of late
Translations, and the infinite number of Commentaries, which are too pregnant
an Argument that we neither agree in the understanding of the words nor of the
sense.

The truth is, all these ways of Interpreting of Scripture which of themselves
are good helps, are made either by design, Numb. 6.
or by our infirmites ways of intricating and involving Scriptures in greater
difficulty, because men do not learn their doctrines from Scripture, but come
to the understanding of Scripture with preconceptions and idea's of doctrines
of their own, and then no wonder that Scriptures look like Pictures, wherein
every man in the room believes they look on him only, and that wheresoever he
stands, or how often soever he changes his station. So that now what was
intended for a remedy, becomes the promoter of our disease, and our meat
becomes the matter of sicknesses: And the mischief is, the wit of man cannot
find a remedy for it; for there is no rule, no limit, no certain principle, by
which all men may be guided to a certain and so infallible an Interpretation,
that he can with any equity prescribe to others to believe his Interpretations
in places of controversy or ambiguity. A man would think that the memorable
Prophesy of Jacob, that the Scepter should not depart from Judah till Shiloh
come, should have been so clear a determination of the time of the Messiah,
that a Jew should never have doubted it to have been verified in Jesus of
Nazareth; and yet for this so clear vaticination, they have no less then
twenty six Answers. S. Paul and S. James seem to speak a little diversely
concerning Justification by Faith and Works, and yet to my understanding it is
very easy to reconcile them: but all men are not of my mind; for Osiander in
his confutation of the book which Melanchton wrote against him, observes, that
there are twenty several opinions concerning Justification, all drawn from the
Scriptures, by the men only of the Augustan Confession. There are sixteen
several opinions concerning original sin; and as many definitions of the
Sacraments as there are Sects of men that disagree about them.

And now what help is there for us in the midst of these uncertainties? If we
follow any one Translation, or any one Numb. 7.
man's Commentary, what rule shall we have to choose the right by? or is there
any one man, that has translated perfectly, or expounded infallibly? No
Translation challenges such a prerogative as to be authentic, but the Vulgar
Latin; and yet see with what good success: For when it was declared
authentic by the Council of Trent, Sixtus put forth a Copy much mended of
what it was, and tied all men to follow that; but that did not satisfy; for
Pope Clement reviews and corrects it in many places, and still the Decree
remains in a changed subject. And secondly, that Translation will be very
unapt to satisfy, in which one of their own men Isidore Clarius a Monk of
Brescia, found and mended eight thousand faults, besides innumerable others
which he says he pretermitted. And then thirdly, to show how little themselves
were satisfied with it, diverse learned men amongst them did new translate the
Bible, and thought they did God and the Church good service in it. So that if
you take this for your precedent, you are sure to be mistaken infinitely: If
you take any other, the Authors themselves do not promise you any security. If
you resolve to follow any one as far only as you see cause, then you only do
wrong or right by chance; for you have certainty just proportionable to your
own skill, to your own infallibility. If you resolve to follow any one, whether
soever he leads, we shall oftentimes come thither where we shall see our selves
become ridiculous, as it happened in the case of Spiridion Bishop of Cyprus,
who so resolved to follow his old book, that when an eloquent Bishop who was
desired to Preach, read his Text, Tu autem toll cubile tuum and ambula;
Spiridion was very angry with him, because in his book it was toll lectum
tuum, and thought it arrogance in the preacher to speak better Latin then his
Translatour had done: And if it be thus in Translations, it is far worse in
Expositions: [Quia scil. Scripturam sacram pro ipsa sui altitudine non uno
eodemque sensu omnes accipiunt, ut pene quot homines tot illic sententiae erui
posse videantur, said Vincent Lirinensis] in which every man knows In Commonit.
what innumerable ways there are of being mistaken, God having in things not
simply necessary left such a difficulty upon those parts of Scripture which are
the subject matters of controversy ad edomandam labor superbiam, and
intellectum a fastidio revocandum (as S. Austin gives a reason) that all that
err honestly, are therefore to be pityed, and tolerated, because Lib. 2. de
doctr. Christian. c. 6.
it is or may be the condition of every man at one time or other.

The sum is this: Since holy Scripture is the repository Numb. 8.
of divine truths, and the great rule of Faith, to which all Sects of
Christians do appeal for probation of their several opinions, and since all
agree in the Articles of the Creed as things clearly and plainly set down, and
as containing all that which is of simple and prime necessity; and since on the
other side there are in Scripture many other mysteries, and matters of Question
upon which there is a veil; since there are so many Copies with infinite
varieties of reading; since a various Interpunction, a parenthesis, a letter,
an accent may much alter the sense; since some places have diverse literal
senses, many have spiritual, mystical and Allegorical meanings; since there
are so many tropes, metonymies, ironies, hyperboles, proprieties and
improprieties of language, whose understanding depends upon such circumstances
that it is almost impossible to know its proper Interpretation; [now that the
knowledge of such circumstances and particular stories is irrevocably lost:
since there are some mysteries which at the best advantage of expression, are
not easy to be apprehended, and whose explication, by reason of our
imperfections, must needs be dark, sometimes weak, sometimes unintelligle: and
lastly, since those ordinary means of expounding Scripture, as searching the
Originalls, conference of places, parity of reason, and analogy of Faith, are
all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible, he that is the wisest and by
consequence the likelyest to expound truest in all probability of reason, will
be very far from confidence, because every one of these and many more are
like so many degrees of improbability and incertainty, all depressing our
certainty of finding out truth in such mysteries and amidst so many
difficulties. And therefore a wise man that considers this, would not willingly
be prescribed to by others; and therefore if he also be a just man, he will not
impose upon others; for it is best every man should be left in that liberty
from which no man can justly take him, unless he could secure him from error:
So that here also there is a necessity to conserve the liberty of Prophesying,
and Interpreting Scripture; a necessity derived from the consideration of the
difficulty of Scripture in Questions controverted, and the uncertainty of any
internal medium, of Interpretation.

SECT. V.
Of the insufficiency and uncertainty of Tradition to Expound Scripture, or
determine Questions.

IN the next place, we must consider those extrinsecall means Numb. 1.
of Interpreting Scripture, and determining Questions, which they most of all
confide in that restrain Prophesying with the greatest Tyranny. The first and
principal is Tradition, which is pretended not only to expound Scripture
(Necesse enim est Vincent. Lirinens. in Commonitor.
propter tantos tam varii erroris anfractus, ut Propheticae and Apostolicae
interpretationis linea secundum Ecclesiastici and Catholici sensus normam
dirigatur:) but also to propound Articles upon a distinct stock, such Articles
whereof there is no mention and proposition in Scripture. And in this topic,
not only the distinct Articles are clear and plain, like as the fundamentals of
Faith expressed in Scripture, but also it pretends to expound Scripture, and to
determine Questions with so much clarity and certainty, as there shall neither
be error nor doubt remaining, and therefore no disagreeing is here to be
endured. And indeed it is most true if Tradition can perform these
pretensions, and teach us plainly, and assure us infallibly of all truths,
which they require us to believe, we can in this case have no reason to
disbelieve them, and therefore are certainly Heretics if we do, because
without a crime, without some humane interest or collateral design, we cannot
disbelieve traditive Doctrine or traditive Interpretation, if it be infallibly
proved to us that tradition is an infallible guide.

But here I first consider that tradition is no repository of Numb. 2.
Articles of Faith, and therefore the not following it is no Argument of
heresy; for besides that I have showed Scripture in its plain expresses to be
an abundant rule of Faith and manners, Tradition is a topic as fallible as any
other; so fallible that it cannot be sufficient evidence to any man in a matter
of Faith or Question of heresy.

For 1. I find that the Fathers were infinitely deceived in Numb. 3.
their account and enumeration of Traditions, sometimes they did call some
Traditions, such, not which they knew to be so, but by Arguments and
presumptions they concluded them so. Such as was that of S. Austin, ca quae
universalis tenet Ecclesia nec a Conciliis Epist. 118. ad Ianuar. De bapt.
contr. Donat. lib. 4. c. 24.
instituta reperiuntur, credibile est ab Apostolorum traditione descendisse.
Now suppose this rule probable, that is the most, yet it is not certain; It
might come by custom, whose Original was not known, but yet could not derive
from an Apostolical principle. Now when they conclude of particular Traditions
by a general rule, and that general rule not certain, but at the most
probable in any thing, and certainly false in some things, it is wonder if the
productions, that is, their judgments, and pretense fail so often. And if I
should but instance in all the particulars, in which Tradition was pretended
falsely or uncertainly in the first Ages, I should multiply them to a
troublesome variety; for it was then accounted so glorious a thing to have
spoken with the persons of the Apostles, that if any man could with any color
pretend to it, he might abuse the whole Church, and obtrude what he listed
under the specious title of Apostolical Tradition, and it is very notorious to
every man that will but read and observe the Recognitions or stromata of
Clemens Alexandrinus, where there is enough of such false wares showed in every
book, and pretended to be no less then from the Apostles. In the first Age
after the Apostles, Papias pretended he received a Tradition from the Apostles,
that Christ before the day of Judgment should reign a thousand years upon
Earth, and his Saints with him in temporal felicities; and this thing
proceeding from so great an Authority as the testimony of Papias, drew after it
all or most of the Christians in the first three hundred years. For besides,
that the Millenary opinion is expressly taught by Papias, Justin Martyr,
Irenaus, Origin, Lactantius, Severus, Victorinus, Apollinaris, Nepos, and
diverse others famous in their time, Justin Martyr in his Dialogue against
Tryphon says, it was the belief of all Christians exactly Orthodox, (...),
and yet there was no such Tradition, but a mistake in Papias; but I find it
nowhere spoke against, till Dionysins of Alexandria confuted Nepo's Book, and
converted Coracion the Egyptian from the opinion. Now if a Tradition whose
beginning of being called so began with a Scholar of the Apostles (for so was
Papias) and then continued for some Ages upon the mere Authority of so famous a
man, did yet deceive the Church: much more fallible is the pretense, when two
or three hundred years after, it but commences, and then by some learned man is
first called a Tradition Apostolical. And so it happened in the case of the
Arrian heresy, which the Nicene Fathers did confute by objecting a contrary
Tradition Apostolical, as Theodoret reports; Lib. 1. hist. c. 8.
and yet if they had not had better Arguments from Scripture then from
Tradition, they would have faild much in so good a cause; for this very
pretense the Arrians themselves made, and desired to be tried by the Fathers of
the first three hundred years, which was a confutation sufficient to them who
pretended Vide Peta^: in Epiph. her. 69.
a clear Tradition, because it was unimaginable that the Tradition should leap
so as not to come from the first to the last by the middle. But that this
trial was sometime declined by that excellent man S. Athanasius, although at
other times confidently and truly pretended, it was an Argument the Tradition
was not so (...), (...) Matt. di^l ad Tryph. Iud.
clear, but both sides might with some fairness pretend to it. And therefore
one of the prime Founders of their heresy, the Heretic Euse. l. 5. c. ult.
Artemon having observed the advantage might be taken by any Sect that would
pretend Tradition, because the medium was plausible and consisting of so many
particulars, that it was hard to be redargued, pretended a Tradition from the
Apostles, that Christ was (...), and that the Tradition did descend by a
constant succession in the Church of Rome to Pope Victors time inclusively, and
till Zepherinus had interrupted the series and corrupted the Doctrine; which
pretense if it had not had some appearance of truth, so as possibly to abuse
the Church, had not been worthy of confutation, which yet was with care
undertaken by an old Writer, out of whom Eusebius transcribes a large passage
to reprove the vanity of the pretender. But I observe from hence, that it was
usual to pretend to Tradition, and that it was easier pretended then confuted,
and I doubt not but oftener done then discovered. A great Question arose in
Africa concerning the Baptism of Heretics, whether it were valid or no. S.
Cyprian and his party appealed to Scripture; Stephen Bishop of Rome and his
party, would be judged by custom and Tradition Ecclesiastical. See how much
the nearer the Question was to a determination, either that probation was not
accounted by S. Cyprian, and the Bishops both of Asia and Africa, to be a good
Argument, and sufficient to determine them, or there was no certain Tradition
against them; for unless one of these two do it, nothing could excuse them
from opposing a known truth, unless peradventure, S. Cyprian, Firmilian, the
Bishops of Galatia, Cappadocia, and almost two parts of the World were ignorant
of such a Tradition, for they knew of none such, and some of them expressly
denied it. And the sixth general Synod approves of the Canon made in the
Council of Carthage under Cyprian upon this very ground, because in
praedictorum praesulum locis and solum secundum Can. 2.
traditam eis consuetudinem servatus est; they had a particular Tradition for
Rebaptization, and therefore there could be no Tradition Universal against it,
or if there were they knew not of it, but much for the contrary; and then it
would be remembered that a concealed Tradition was like a silent Thunder, or a
Law not promulgated; it neither was known, nor was obligatory. And I shall
observe this too, that this very Tradition was so obscure, and was so obscurely
delivered, silently proclaimed, that S. Austin who disputed against the
Donatists upon this very Question was not able to prove it, but L. 5. de
baptism. contr. Donat. c. 23.
by a consequence which he thought probale and credible, as appears in his
discourse against the Donatists. The Apostles, says S. Austin, prescribed
nothing in this particular: But this custom which is contrary to Cyprian ought
to be believed to have come from their Tradition, as many other things which
the Catholic Church observes. That Is all the ground and all the reason; nay
the Church did waver concerning that Question, and before the decision of a
Council, Cyprian and others might dissent without breach of charity. It was
plain then there was no clear Tradition Lib. 1. de baptism. c. 18.
in the Question, possibly there might be a custom in some Churches postnate
to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition
Apostolical. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they
needed it; and De peccat. original. l. 2. c. 40. contra Pelagi. and Caelest.
S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sin, by the
custom of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the
Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be
proved, that he that shall affirm it, shall gain only the reputation of a bold
man and a confident.

2. I consider if the report of Traditions in the Primitive Numb. 4.
times so near the Ages Apostolical was so uncertain, that they were fain to
aim at them by conjectures, and grope as in the dark, the uncertainty is much
increased since, because there are many famous Writers whose works are lost,
which yet if they had continued, they might have been good records to us, as
Clemens Romanus, Egesippus, Nepos, Coracion, Dionysius Areopagite, of
Alexandria, of Corinth, Firmilian and many more: And since we see pretenses
have been made without reason in those Ages where they might better have been
confuted, then now they can, it is greater prudence to suspect any later
pretenses, since so many Sects have been, so many wars, so many corruptions
in Authors, so many Authors lost, so much ignorance has intervened, and so
many interests have been served, that now the rule is to be altered; and
whereas it was of old time credible, that that was Apostolical whose beginning
they knew not, now quite contrary we cannot safely believe them to be
Apostolical unless we do know their beginning to have been from the
Apostles. For this consisting of probabilities and particulars, which put
together make up a moral demonstration, the Argument which I now urge has
been growing these fifteen hundred years; and if anciently there was so much as
to evacuate the Authority of Tradition, much more is there now absolutely to
destroy it, when all the particulars, which time and infinite variety of humane
accidents have been amassing together, are now concentred, and are united by
way of constipation. Because every Age and every great change, and every
heresy, and every interest, has increased the difficulty of finding out true
Traditions.

3. There are very many Traditions which are lost, and yet they are concerning
matters of as great consequence as most of Numb. 5.
those Questions for the determination whereof Traditions are pretended: It is
more then probable, that as in Baptism and the Eucharist the very forms of
ministration are transmitted to us, so also in confirmation and ordination, and
that there were special directions for visitation of the sick, and explicit
interpretations of those difficult places of S. Paul which S. Peter affirmed to
be so difficult that the ignorant do wrest them to their own damnation, and
yet no Church has conserved these or those many more which S. Basil affirms to
be so many that (...); the day would fail him in the very simple enumeration
of all Cap. 29. despir. Sancto.
Traditions Ecclesiastical. And if the Church has failed in keeping the great
variety of Traditions, it will hardly be thought a fault in a private person to
neglect Tradition, which either the whole Church has very much neglected
inculpably, or else the whose Church is very much too blame. And who can
ascertain us that she has not entertained some which are no Traditions as well
as lost thousands that are? That she did entertain some false Traditions, I
have already proved; but it is also as probable that some of those which these
Ages did propound for Traditions, are not so, as it is certain that some which
the first Ages called Traditions, were nothing less.

4. There are some opinions which when they began to be publicly received,
began to be accounted prime Traditions, Numb. 6.
and so became such not by a native title, but by adoption; and nothing is more
usual then for the Fathers to color their popular opinion with so great an
appellative. S. Austin called the communicating of Infants an Apostolical
Tradition, and yet we do not practice it, because we disbelieve the
Allegation. And that every custom which at first introduction was but a
private fancy or singular practice, grew afterward into a public rite and
went for a Tradition after a while continuance, appears by Tertullian who seems
to justify it, Non enim existimas tu Contra Marcon.
licitum esse cuicunque fideli constituere quod Deo placere illi visum De
coron. milit. c. 3. and 4.
fuerit, ad disciplinam and salutem. And again, A quocunque traditore
censetur, nec authorem respicias sed authoritatem. And S. Hierome most plainly,
Praecepra majorum Apostolicas Tradiones Apud Eusebius. l. 5. c. 20.
quisque existimat. And when Irenaeus had observed that great variety in the
keeping of Lent, which yet to be a forty days Fast is pretended to descend
from Tradition Apostolical, some fasting but one day before Easter, some two,
some forty, and this even long before Irenaeus time, he gives this reason,
Varietas illa jejunii coepit apud Majores nostros qui non accurate
consuetudinem eorum qui vel simplicitate quadam vel privata authoritate in
posterum aliquid statuissent, observarant [ex translatione Christophorsoni:]
And there are yet some points of good concernment, which if any man should
Question in a high manner, they would prove indeterminable by Scripture, or
sufficient reason, and yet I doubt not their confident Defenders would say they
are opinions of the Church, and quickly pretend a Tradition from the very
Apostles, and believe themselves so secure that they could not be discovered,
because the Question never having been disputed, gives them occasion to say
that which had no beginning known, was certainly from the Apostles. For why
should not Divines do in the Question of reconfirmation as in that of
rebaptization? Are not the grounds equal from an indelible character in one as
in the other? and if it happen such a Question as this after contestation
should be determined not by any positive decree, but by the cession of one
part, and the authority and reputation of the other, does not the next Age
stand fair to be abused with a pretense of Tradition, in the matter of
reconfirmation, which never yet came to a serious Question? For so it was in
the Question of rebaptization for which there was then no more evident
Tradition then there is now in the Question of reconfirmation, as I proved
formerly, but yet it was carried upon that Title.

5. There is great variety in the probation of Tradition, so that whatever is
proved to be Tradition, is not equally and Numb. 7.
alike credible; for nothing but universal Tradition is of it self credible;
other Traditions in their just proportion as they partake of the degrees of
universality. Now that a Tradition be universal, or which is all one that it
be a credible Testimony, S. Irenaeus requires that Tradition should derive from
all the Lib. 3. c. 4.
Churches Apostolical. And therefore according to this rule there was no
sufficient medium to determine the Question about Easter, because the Eastern
and Western Churches had several Traditions respectively, and both pretended
from the Apostles. Clemens Alexandrinus says, it was a secret Tradition Li. 1.
Stromat.
from the Apostles that Christ preached but one year: But L. 2. c. 39.
Irenaeus says it did derive from Heretics, and says that he Omnes Seniores
testantur qui in Asia apud Iohannem Discipulum Domini convenerunt id ipsum
tradidisse eis Iohannem, etc. and qui alios Apostolos viderunt haec eadem ab
ipsis audierunt, and testantur de ejusmodi relatione.
by Tradition first from S. John, and then from his Disciples received another
Tradition, that Christ was almost fifty years old when he dyed, and so by
consequence preached almost twenty years; both of them were deceived, and so
had all that had believed the report of either pretending Tradition
Apostolical. Thus the custom in the Latin Church of fasting on Saturday was
against that Tradition which the Greeks had from the Apostles; and therefore by
this division and want of consent, which was the true Tradition was so
absolutely indeterminable, that both must needs lose much of their reputation.
But how then when not only particular Churches but single persons are all the
proof we have for a Tradition? And this often happened; I think S. Austin is the
chief Argument and Authority we have for the Assumption of the Virgin Mary;
the Baptism of Infants is called a Tradition by Origin alone at first, and from
Salmeron. disput. 51. in Romans
him by others. The procession of the holy Ghost from the Son, which is an
Article the Greek Church disavowes, derives from the Tradition Apostolical, as
it is pretended; and yet before S. Austin we hear nothing of it very clearly
or certainly, for as much as that whole mystery concerning the blessed Spirit
was so little explicated in Scripture, and so little derived to them by
Tradition, that till the Council of Nice, you shall hardly find any form of
worship or personal address of devotion to the holy Spirit, as Erasmus
observes, and I think the contrary will very hardly be verified. And for this
particular in which I instance, whatsoever is in Scripture concerning it, is
against that which the Church of Rome calls Tradition, which makes the Greeks
so confident as they are of the point, and is an Argument of the vanity of some
things which for no greater reason are called Traditions, but because one man
has said so, and that they can be proved by no better Argument to be true. Now
in this case wherein Tradition descends upon us with unequal certainty, it
would be very unequal to require of us an absolute belief of every thing not
written, for fear we be accounted to slight Tradition Apostolical. And since
no thing can require our supreme assent, but that which is truly Catholic and
Apostolic, and to such a Tradition is required as Irenaeus says, the consent
of all those Churches which the Apostles planted, and where they did preside,
this topic will be of so little use in judging heresies that (besides what is
deposited in Scripture) it cannot be proved in any thing but in the Canon of
Scripture it self, and as it is now received, even in that there is some
variety.

And therefore there is wholly a mistake in this business; for when the Fathers
appeal to Tradition, and with much earnestness, Numb. 8.
and some clamor they call upon Heretics to conform to or to be tried by
Tradition, it is such a Tradition as delivers the fundamental points of
Christianity, which were also recorded in Scripture. But because the Canon was
not yet perfectly consigned, they called to that testimony they had, which was
the testimony of the Churches Apostolical, whose Bishops and Priests being the
Antistites religionis, did believe and preach Christian Religion and conserve
all its great mysteries according as they had been taught. Irenaeus calls this
a Tradition Apostolical, Christum accepisse calicem, and dixisse sanguinem
suum esse, and docuisse novam oblationem novi Testamenti, quam Ecclesia per
Apostolos accipiens offert per totum mundum. And the Fathers in these Ages
confute Heretics by Ecclesiastical Tradition, that is, they confront against
their impious and blaspemous doctrines that Religion which the Apostles having
taught to the Churches where they did preside, their Successors did still
preach, and for a long while together suffered not the enemy to sow tares
amongst their wheat. And yet these doctrines which they called Traditions, were
nothing but such fundamental truths which were in Scripture, (...), is
Irenaeus in Eusebius observes, in the instance of Polycarpus, and it is
manifest by considering Lib. 5. cap. 20.
what heresies they fought against, the heresies of Ebion, Cerinthus,
Nicolaitans, Valentinians, Carpocratians, persons that Vid. Irenae. l. 3 and 4.
cont. haeres.
denied the Son of God, the Unity of the Godhead, that preached impurity,
that practiced Sorcery and Witchcraft. And now that they did rather urge
Tradition against them then Scripture was, because the public Doctrine of all
the Apostolical Churches was at first more known and famous then many parts of
the Scripture, and because some Heretics denied S. Lukes Gospel, some received
none but S. Matthews, some rejected all S. Paul's Epistles, and it was a long
time before the whole Canon was consigned by universal Testimony, some
Churches having one part some another, Rome her self had not all, so that in
this case the Argument from Tradition was the most famous, the most certain,
and the most prudent. And now according to this rule they had more Traditions
then we have, and Traditions did by degrees lessen as they came to be written,
and their necessity was less, as the knowledge of them was ascetained to us by
a better Keeper of Divine Truths. All that great mysteriousnesse of Christ's
Priesthood, the unity of his Sacrifice, Christ's Advocation and Intercession
for us in Heaven, and many other excellent. Doctrines might very well be
accounted Traditions before S. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews was published to
all the World; but now they are written truths; and if they had not, possibly
we might either have lost them quite, or doubted of them as we do of many
other Traditions, by reason of the insufficiency of the propounder. And
therefore it was that S. Peter took order that the Gospel 2 Pet. 1. 13.
should be Writ, for he had promised that he would do something which after
his decease should have these things in remembrance. He knew it was not safe
trusting the report of men where the fountain might quickly run dry, or be
corrupted so insensibly, that no cure could be found for it, nor any just
notice taken of it till it were incurable. And indeed there is scarce any thing
but what is written in Scripture, that can with any confidence of Argument
pretend to derive from the Apostles, except ritualls, and manners of
ministration; but no doctrines or speculative mysteries are so transmitted to
us by so clear a current, that we may see a visible channel, and trace it to
the Primitive fountains. It is said to be a Tradition Apostolical, that no
Priest should baptize without chrism and the command of the Bishop: Suppose it
were, yet we cannot be obliged to believe it with much confidence, because we
have but little proof for it, scarce any thing but the single testimony of S.
Hierom. And yet if it were, this is but a rituall, of which in passing by, I
shall give that account: That, Dialog. adv. Lucifer.
suppose this and many more ritualls did derive clearly from Tradition
Apostolical (which yet but very few do) yet it is hard that any Church should
be charged with crime for not observing such ritualls, because we see some of
them which certainly did derive from the Apostles, are expired and gone out in
a desuetude; such as are abstinence from blood, and from things strangled, the
coenobitick life of secular persons, the college of widows, to worship
standing upon the Lords day, to give milk and honey to the newly baptized, and
many more of the like nature; now there having been no mark to distinguish the
necessity of one from the indifferency of the other, they are all alike
necessary, or alike indifferent; if the former, why does no Church observe
them? if the later, why does the Church of Rome charge upon others the shame of
novelty, for leaving of some Rites and Ceremonies which by her own practice we
are taught to have no obligation in them, but to be adiaphorous? S. Paul gave
order, that a Bishop should be the husband of one wife; The Church of Rome will
not allow so much; other Churches allow more: The Apostles commanded Christians
to Fast on Wednesday and Friday, as appears in their Canons; The Church of
Rome Fasts Friday and Saturday, and not on Wednesday: The Apostles had their
Agapae or love Feasts, we should believe them scandalous: They used a kiss of
charity in ordinary addresses, the Church of Rome keeps it only in their Mass,
other Churches quite omit it: The Apostles permitted Priests and Deacons to
live in conjugall Society as appears in the 5. Can. of the Apostles (which to
them is an Argument who believe them such) and yet the Church of Rome, by no
means will endure it; nay more, Michael Medina gives Testimony that of 84
Canons Apostolical which Clemens collected, De sacr. hom, continent, li 5. c.
105.
scarce six or eight are observed by the Latin Church, and Peresius gives this
account of it, In illis contineri multa quae temporum corruptione non plene
observantur, aliis pro temporis and De Tradit. part. 3. c. de Author. Can.
Apost.
materiae qualitate aut obliteratis, aut totius Ecclesiae magisterio abrogatis.
Now it were good that they which take a liberty to themselves, should also
allow the same to others. So that for one thing or other, all Traditions
excepting those very few that are absolutely universal, will lose all their
obligation, and become no competent medium to confine men's practices, or limit
their faiths, or determine their persuasions. Either for the difficulty of
their being proved, the incompetency of the testimony that transmits them, or
the indifferency of the thing transmitted, all Traditions both rituall and
doctrinall are disabled from determining our consciences either to a necessary
believing or obeying.

6. To which I add by way of confirmation, that there are some things called
Traditions, and are offered to be proved to Numb. 9.
us by a Testimony, which is either false or not extant. Clemens of Alexandria
pretended it a Tradition that the Apostles preached to them that dyed in
infidelity, even after their death, and then raised them to life, but he proved
it only by the Testimony of the Book of Hermes; he affirmed it to be a
Tradition Apostolical, that the Greeks were saved by their Philosophy, but he
had no other Authority for it but the Apocryphal Books of Peter and Paul.
Tertullian and S. Basil pretend it an Apostolical Tradition, to sign in the
air with the sign of the Cross, but this was only consigned to them in the
Gospel of Nicodemus. But to instance once for all in the Epistle of Marcellus
to the Bishop of Antioch, where he affirms that it is the Canon of the
Apostles, praeter sententiam Romani Pontificis, non posse Conciliae celebrari.
And yet there is no such Canon extant, nor ever was for ought appears in any
Record we have; and yet the Collection of the Canons is so entire, that though
it has something more then what was Apostolical, yet it has nothing less.
And now that I am casually fallen upon an instance from the Canons of the
Apostles, I consider that there cannot in the world a greater instance be given
how easy it is to be abused in the believing of Traditions. For 1. to the first
50. which many did admit for Apostolical, 35 more were added, which most men
now count spurious, all men call dubious, and some of them universally
condemned by peremptory sentence, even by them who are greatest admirers of
that Collection, as 65. 67. and 8 Canons. For the first 50, it is evident that
there are some things so mixed with them, and no mark of difference left, that
the credit of all is much impared, insomuch that Isidor of Sevill says, they
were Apoeryphall, made by Heretics, and published under the Apud Gratian.
did. 16. c. Canones.
title Apostolical, but neither the Fathers nor the Church of Rome did give
assent to them. And yet they have prevailed so far amongst some, that
Damascen is of opinion they should Lib. ^. c. 18 de Orthod. fide.
be received equally with the Canonical writings of the Apostles. One thing
only I observe (and we shall find it true in most writings, whose Authority is
urged in Questions of Theology) that the Authority of the Tradition is not it
which moves the assent, but the nature of the thing; and because such a Canon
is delivered, they do not therefore believe the sanction or proposition so
delivered, but disbelieve the Tradition, if they do not like the matter, and
so do not judge of the matter by the Tradition, but of the Tradition by the
matter. And thus the Church of Rome rejects the 84 or 85 Canon of the Apostles,
not because it is delivered with less Authority, then the last 35 are, but
because it reckons the Canon of Scripture otherwise then it is at Rome. Thus
also the fifth Canon amongst the first 50, because it approves the marriage of
Priests and Deacons does not persuade them to approve of it too, but it self
becomes suspected for approving it: So that either they accuse themselves of
palpable contempt of the Apostolical Authority, or else that the reputation of
such Traditions is kept up to serve their own ends, and therefore when they
encounter them, they are more to be upheld; which what else is it but to teach
all the world to contemn such pretenses and undervalue Traditions, and to
supply to others a reason why they should do that, which to them that give the
occasion is most unreasonable?

7. The Testimony of the Ancient Church being the only Numb. 10.
means of proving Tradition, and sometimes their dictates and doctrine being
the Tradition pretended of necessity to be imitated, it is considerable that
men in their estimate of it, take their rise from several Ages and differing
Testimonies, and are not agreed about the competency of their Testimony; and
the reasons that on each side make them differ, are such as make the Authority
it self the less authentic and more repudiable. Some will allow only of the
three first Ages, as being most pure, most persecuted, and therefore most holy,
least interested, serving fewer designs, having fewest factions, and therefore
more likely to speak the truth for Gods sake and its own, as best complying
with their great end of acquiring Heaven in recompense of losing their lives:
Others Vid. Card. Petron. lettre an Sieur Casaubon.
say, that those Ages being persecuted minded the present Doctrines
proportionable to their purposes and constitution of the Ages, and make little
or nothing of those Questions which at this day vex Christendom: And both
speak true: The first Ages speak greatest truth, but least pertinently. The
next Ages, the Ages of the four general Councels spoke something, not much
more pertinently to the present Questions, but were not so likely to speak
true, by reason of their dispositions contrary to the capacity and circumstance
of the first Ages; and if they speak wisely as Doctors, yet not certainly as
witnesses of such propositions which the first Ages noted not; and yet unless
they had noted, could not possibly be Traditions. And therefore either of them
will be less useless as to our present affairs. For indeed the Questions
which now are the public trouble, were not considered or thought upon for many
hundred years, and therefore prime Tradition there is none as to our purpose,
and it will be an insufficient medium to be used or pretended in the
determination; and to dispute concerning the truth or necessity of Traditions,
in the Questions of out times, is as if Historians disputing about a Question
in the English Story, should fall on wrangling whether Livie or Plutarch were
the best Writers: And the earnest disputes about Traditions are to no better
purpose. For no Church at this day admits the one half of those things, which
certainly by the Fathers were called Traditions Apostolical, and no Testimony
of ancient Writers does consign the one half of the present Questions, to be
or not to be Traditions. So that they who admit only the Doctrine and Testimony
of the first Ages cannot be determined in most of their doubts which now
trouble us, because their Writings are of matters wholly differing from the
present disputes, and they which would bring in after Ages to the Authority of
a competent judge or witness, say the same thing; for they plainly confess
that the first Ages spoke little or nothing to the present Question, or at
least nothing to their sense of them; for therefore they call in aid from the
following Ages, and make them suppletory and auxiliary to their designs, and
therefore there are no Traditions to our purposes. And they who would willingly
have it otherwise, yet have taken no course it should be otherwise; for they
when they had opportunity in the Councels of the last Ages to determine what
they had a mind to, yet they never named the number, nor expressed the
particular Traditions which they would feign have the world believe to be
Apostolical: But they have kept the bridle in their own hands, and made a
reserve of their own power, that if need be, they may make new pretensions, or
not be put to it to justify the old by the engagement of a conciliary
declaration.

Lastly, We are acquitted by the Testimony of the Primitive Fathers, from any
other necessity of believing, then of Numb. 11.
such Articles as are recorded in Scripture: And this is done by them, whose
Authority is pretended the greatest Argument for Tradition, as appears largely
in Irenaeus, who disputes professedly for the sufficiency of Scripture against
certain Heretics, who L. 3. c. 2. contr. haeres.
affirm some necessary truths not to be written. It was an excellent saying of
S. Basil and will never be wipt out with all the eloquence of Perron [in his
Sermon. de fide. Manifestus est fidei lapsus, and liquidum superbiae vitium vel
respuere aliquid eorum quae Scriptura habet, vel inducere quicquam quod
scriptum non est.] And it is but a poor device to say that every particular
Tradition is consigned in Scripture by those places which give Authority to
Tradition; and so the introducing of Tradition is not a super-inducing any
thing over or besides Scripture, because Tradition is like a Messenger, and the
Scripture is like his Letters of Credence, and therefore Authorizes whatsoever
Tradition speaks. For supposing Scripture does consign the Authority of
Tradition (which it might do before all the whole Instrument of Scripture it
self was consigned, and then afterward there might be no need of Tradition)
yet supposing it, it will follow that all those Traditions which are truly
prime and Apostolical, are to be entertained according to the intention of the
Deliverers, which indeed is so reasonable of it self, that we need not
Scripture to persuade us to it; it self is authentic as Scripture is, if it
derives from the same fountain; and a word is never the more the Word of God
for being written, nor the less for not being written; but it will not follow
that whatsoever is pretended to be Tradition, is so, neither is the credit of
the particular instances consigned in Scripture; and dolosus versatur in
generalibus, but that this craft is too palpable. And if a general and
indefinite consignation of Tradition be sufficient to warrant every particular
that pretends to be Tradition, then S. Basil had spoken to no purpose by saying
it is Pride and Apostasy from the Faith, to bring in what is not written: For
if either any man brings in what is written, or what he says is delivered,
then the first being express Scripture, and the second being consigned in
Scripture, no man can be charged with superinducing what is not written, he
has his Answer ready; And then these are zealous words absolutely to no
purpose; but if such general consignation does not warrant every thing that
pretends to Tradition, but only such as are truly proved to be Apostolical;
then Scripture is useless as to this particular; for such Tradition gives
testimony to Scripture, and therefore is of it self first, and more credible,
for it is credible of it self; and therefore unless S. Basil thought that all
the will of God in matters of Faith and Doctrine were written, I see not what
end nor what sense he could have in these words: For no man in the world except
Enthusiasts and madmen ever obtruded a Doctrine upon-the Church, but he
pretended Scripture for it or Tradition, and therefore no man could be pressed
by these words, no man confuted, no man instructed, no not Enthusiasts or
Montanists. For suppose either of them should say, that since in Scripture the
holy Ghost is promised to abide with the Church for ever, to teach, whatever
they pretend the Spirit in any Age has taught them, is not to super-induce any
thing beyond what is written, because the truth of the Spirit, his veracity,
and his perpetual teaching being promised and attested in Scripture, Scripture
has just so consigned all such Revelations, as Perron says it has all such
Traditions. But I will trouble my self no more with Arguments from any humane
Authorities; but he that is surprised with the belief of such Authorities, and
will but consider the very many Testimonies of Antiquity to this purpose, as of
Orat. ad Nicen. PP. apud. Theodor. l. 1. c. 7.
Constantine, In Matthew. l. 4. c. 23. and in Aggaeum.
S. Hierom, De bono viduil. c. 1.
S. Austin, Orat. contr. gent.
S. Athaenasius, In Psalm. 132.
S. Hilary, L. 2. contra. here is. tom. 1. haer. 61.
S. Epiphanius, and diverse others, all speaking words to the same sense, with
that saying of S. 1. Cor. 4.
Paul, Nemo sentiat super quod scriptum est, will see that there is reason,
that since no man is materially a Heretic, but he that erres in a point of
Faith, and all Faith is sufficienly recorded in Scripture, the judgment of
Faith and Heresy is to be derived from thence, and no man is to be condemned
for dissenting in an Article for whose probation Tradition only is pretended;
only according to the degree of its evidence, let every one determine himself,
but of this evidence we must not judge for others; for unless it be in things
of Faith, and absolute certainties, evidence is a word of relation, and so
supposes two terms, the object and the faculty; and it is an imperfect speech
to say a thing is evident in it self (unless we speak of first principles or
clearest revelations) for that may be evident to one that is not so to another,
by reason of the pregnancy of some apprehensions, and the immaturity of others.

This Discourse has its intention in Traditions Doctrinall and Rituall, that
is such Traditions which propose Articles new in materia; but now if Scripture
be the repository of all Divine Truths sufficient for us, Tradition must be
considered as its instrument, to convey its great mysteriousnesse to our
understandings; it is said there are traditive Interpretations as well as
traditive propositions, but these have not much distinct consideration in them,
both because their uncertainty is as great as the other upon the former
considerations; as also because in very deed, there are no such things as
traditive Interpretations universal: For as for particulars, they signify no
more but that they are not sufficient determinations of Questions Theological,
therefore because they are particular, contingent, and of infinite variety, and
they are no more Argument then the particular authority of these men whose
Commentaries they are, and therefore must be considered with them.

The sum is this: Since the Fathers who are the best Numb. 12.
Witnesses of Traditions, yet were infinitely deceived in their account, since
sometimes they guest at them and conjectured by way of Rule and Discourse, and
not of their knowledge, not by evidence of the thing; since many are called
Traditions which were not so, many are uncertain whether they were or no, yet
confidently pretended; and this uncertainty which at first was great enough, is
increased by infinite causes and accidents in the succession of 1600 years;
since the Church has been either so careless or so abused that she could
not, or would not preserve Traditions with carfulness and truth; since it was
ordinary for the old Writers to set out their own fancies, and the Rites of
their Church which had been Ancient under the specious Title of Apostolical
Traditions; since some Traditions rely but upon single Testimony at first, and
yet descending upon others, come to be attested by many, whose Testimony though
conjunct, yet in value is but single, because it relies upon the first single
Relator, and so can have no greater authority, or certainty, then they derive
from the single person; since the first Ages who were most competent to consign
Tradition, yet did consign such Traditions as be of a nature wholly discrepant
from the present Questions, and speak nothing at all or very imperfectly to our
purposes; and the following Ages are no fit Witnesses of that which was not
transmitted to them, because they could not know it at all, but by such
transmission and prior consignation; since what at first was a Tradition, came
afterward to be written, and so ceased its being a Tradition; yet the credit
of Traditions commenced upon the certainty and reputation of those truths first
delivered by word, afterward consigned by writing; since what was certainly
Tradition Apostolical, as many Rituals were, are rejected by the Church in
several Ages, and are gone out into a desuetude; and lastly, since, beside the
no necessity of Traditions, there being abundantly enough in Scripture, there
are many things called Traditions by the Fathers, which they themselves either
proved by no Authors, or by Apocryphal and spurious and Heretical, the matter
of Tradition will in very much be so uncertain, so false, so suspicious, so
contradictory, so improbable, so unproved, that if a Question be contested and
be offered to be proved only by Tradition, it will be very hard to impose such
a proposition to the belief of all men with any imperiousness or resolved
determination, but it will be necessary men should preserve the liberty of
believing and prophesying, and not part with it, upon a worse merchandise and
exchange then Esau made for his birthright.

SECT. VI.
Of the uncertainty and insufficiency of Councels Ecclesiastical to the same
purpose.

BUt since we are all this while in uncertainty, it is necessary that we should
address our selves somewhere, where we Numb. 1.
may rest the soale of our foot: And nature, Scripture, and experience teach
the world in matters of Question to submit to some final sentence. For it is
not reason that controversies should continue till the erring person shall be
willing to condemn himself; and the Spirit of God has directed us by that
great precedent at Jerusalem, to address our selves to the Church, that in a
plenary Council and Assembly, she may synodically determine Controversies. So
that if a General Council have determined a Question, or expounded Scripture,
we may no more disbelieve the Decree, then the Spirit of God himself who
speaks in them. And indeed, if all Assemblies of Bishops were like that first,
and all Bishops were of the same spirit of which the Apostles were, I should
obey their Decree with the same Religion as I do them whole preface was Visum
est Spiritui Sancto and nobis: And I doubt not but our blessed Savior intended
that the Assemblies of the Church should be Judges of Controversies, and guides
of our persuasions in matters of difficulty. But he also intended they should
proceed according to his will which he had revealed, and those precedents which
he had made authentic by the immediate assistance of his holy Spirit: He has
done his part, but we do not do ours. And if any private person in the
simplicity and purity of his soul desires to find out a truth of which he is
in search and inquisition, if he prays for wisdom, we have a promise he
shall be heard and answered liberally, and therefore much more, when the
representatives of the Catholic Church do meet, because every person there
has in individuo a title to the promise, and another title as he is a
governor and a guide of souls, and all of them together have another title in
their united capacity, especially, if in that union they pray, and proceed with
simplicity and purity; so that there is no disputing against the pretense and
promises, and authority of General Councels. For if any one man can hope to be
guided by Gods Spirit in the search, the pious and impartial and unprejudicate
search of truth, then much more may a General Council. If no private man can
hope for it, then truth is not necessary to be found, nor we are not obliged to
search for it, or else we are saved by chance: But if private men can by virtue
of a promise, upon certain conditions be assured of finding out sufficient
truth, much more shall a General Council. So that I consider thus: There are
many promises pretended to belong to General Assemblies in the Church; But I
know not any ground, nor any pretense, that they shall be absolutely assisted,
without any condition on their own parts, and whether they will or no: Faith is
a virtue as well as charity, and therefore consists in liberty and choice, and
has nothing in it of necessity: There is no Question but that they are obliged
to proceed according to some rule; for they expect no assistance by way of
Enthusiasme; if they should, I know no warrant for that, neither did any
General Council ever offer a Decree which they did not think sufficiently
proved by Scripture, Reason, or Tradition, as appears in the Acts of the
Councels; now then, if they be tied to conditions, it is their duty to observe
them; but whether it be certain that they will observe them, that they will
do all their duty, that they will not sin even in this particular in the
neglect of their duty, that is the consideration. So that if any man questions
the Title and Authority of General Councels, and whether or no great promises
appertain to them, I suppose him to be much mistaken; but he also that thinks
all of them have proceeded according to rule and reason, and that none of them
were deceived, because possibly they might have been truly directed, is a
stranger to the History of the Church, and to the perpetual instances and
experiments of the faults and failings of humanity. It is a famous saying of S.
Gregory that he had the four first Councels in esteem and veneration next to
the four Evangelists; I suppose it was because he did believe them to have
proceeded according to Rule, and to have judged righteous judgment; but why
had not he the same opinion of other Councels too which were celebrated before
his death; for he lived after the fifth General? not because they had not the
same Authority; for that which is warrant for one is warrant for all; but
because he was not so confident that they did their duty nor proceeded so
without interest as the first four had done, and the following Councels did
never get that reputation which all the Catholic Church acknowledged due to
the first four. And in the next Order were the three following generals; for
the Greeks and Latins did never jointly acknowledge but seven generals to
have been authentic in any sense, because they were in no sense agreed that
any more then seven had proceeded regularly and done their duty: So that now
the Question is not whether General Councels have a promise that the holy
Ghost will assist them; For every private man has that promise, that if he
does his duty he shall be assisted sufficiently in order to that end to which
he needs assistance; and therefore much more shall General Councels in order
to that end for which they convene, and to which they need assistance, that is,
in order to the conservation of the Faith, for the doctrinall rules of good
life, and all that concerns the essential duty of a Christian, but not in
deciding Questions to satisfy contentious or curious or presumptuous spirits.
But now can the Bishops so convened be factious, can they be abused with
prejudice, or transported with interests, can they resist the holy Ghost, can
they extinguish the Spirit, can they stop their ears, and serve themselves
upon the holy Spirit and the pretense of his assistances, and cease to serve
him upon themselves, by captivating their understandings to his dictates, and
their wills to his precepts? Is it necessary they should perform any condition?
is there any one duty for them to perform in these Assemblies, a duty which
they have power to do or not do? If so, then they may fail of it, and not
do their duty: And if the assistance of the holy Spirit be conditional, then
we have no more assurance that they are assisted, then that they do their duty
and do not sin.

Now let us suppose what this duty is: Certainly, if the Gospel Numb. 2.
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; and all that come to the knowledge of
the truth, must come to it by such means which are spiritual and holy
dispositions, in order to a holy and spiritual end. They must be shod with the
preparation of the Gospel of peace, that is, they must have peaceable and
docible dispositions, nothing with them that is violent, and resolute to
encounter those gentle and sweet assistances: and the Rule they are to follow,
is the Rule which the holy Spirit has consigned to the Catholic Church, that
is the holy Scripture, either Vid. Optat. Milev. l. 5. adv. Parm. Baldvin. in
eundem. and S. August. in Psa. 21. Expos. 2.
entirely or at least for the greater part of the Rule: So that now if the
Bishops be factious and prepossest with persuasions depending upon interest,
it is certain they may judge amiss; and if they recede from the Rule, it is
certain they do judge amiss: And this I say upon their grounds who most
advance the authority of General Councels: For if a General Council may err
if a Pope confirm it not, then most certainly if in any thing it recede from
Scripture, it does also err; because that they are to expect the Popes
confirmation they offer to prove from Scripture: now if the Popes confirmation
be required by authority of Scripture, and that therefore the defaillance of it
does evacuate the Authority of the Council, then also are the Councels Decrees
invalid, if they recede from any other part of Scripture: So that Scripture is
the Rule they are to follow, and a man would have thought it had been needless
to have proved it, but that we are fallen into Ages in which no truth is
certain, no reason concluding, nor is there any thing that can convince some
men. For Stapleton with extreme boldness against the piety of Christendom,
against the public sense of the ancient Relect. centrov. 4. q. 1. a. 3
Church, and the practice of all pious Assemblies of Bishops affirms the
Decrees of a Council to be binding, etiamsi non confirmetur ne probabili
testimonio Scripturarum; nay, though it be quite extra Scripturam, but all wise
and good men have ever said that sense which S. Hilary expressed in these
words, Quae extra Evangelium sunt non defendam; This was it which the good
Emperor Constantine propounded to the Fathers I. 2. ad Constant.
met at Nice, libri Evangelici, oracula Apostolorum, and veterum Prophetarum
clare nos instruunt quid sentiendum in Divinis, Apud Theodor. l 1. c. 7.
and this is confessed by a sober man of the Roman Church it self, the
Cardinal of Cusa, Oportet qnod omnia talia quae legere debent, contineantur in
Authoritatibus sacrarum Scripturarum: Concord. Cathol. l. 2. c 10.
Now then all the advantage I shall take from hence, is this, That if the
Apostles commended them who examined their Sermons by their conformity to the
Law and the Prophets, and the men of Berea were accounted noble for searching
the Scriptures whether those things which they taught were so or no; I suppose
it will not be denied, but the Councels Decrees, may also be tried whether they
be conform to Scripture yea or no; and although no man can take cognizance and
judge the Decrees of a Council pro Authoritate publica, yet pro informatione
privata they may; the Authority of a Council is not greater then the Authority
of the Apostles, nor their dictates more sacred or authentic. Now then put
case a Council should recede from Scripture; whether or no were we bound to
believe its Decrees? I only ask the Question: For it were hard to be bound to
believe what to our understanding seems contrary to that which we know to be
the Word of God: But if we may lawfully recede from the Councels Decrees, in
case they be contrariant to Scripture, it is all that I require in this
Question. For if they be tied to a Rule, then they are to be examined and
understood according to the Rule, and then we are to give our selves that
liberty of judgment which is requisite to distinguish us from beasts, and to
put us into a capacity of reasonable people, following reasonable guides. But
how ever if it be certain that the Counsels are to follow Scripture, then if
it be notorious that they do recede from Scripture, we are sure we must obey
God rather then men, and then we are well enough. For unless we are bound to
shut our eyes, and not to look upon the Sun, if we may give our selves
liberty to believe what seems most plain, and unless the Authority of a
Council be so great a prejudice as to make us to do violence to our
understanding, so as not to disbelieve the Decree, because it seems contrary
to Scripture, but to believe it agrees with Scripture, though we know not how,
therefore because the Council has decreed it, unless I say we be bound in
duty to be so obediently blind, and sottish, we are sure that there are some
Councels which are pretended General, that have retired from the public
notorious words and sense of Scripture. For what wit of man can reconcile the
Decree of the thirteenth Session of the Council of Constance with Scripture,
in which Session the half Communion was decreed, in defiance of Scripture, and
with a non obstante to Christ's institution. For in the Preface of the Decree,
Christ's institution and the practice of the Primitive Church is expressed, and
then with a non obstante, Communion in one kind is established. Now then suppose
the non obstante in the form of words relates to the Primitive practice; yet
since Christ's institution was taken notice of in the first words of the Decree,
and the Decree made quite contrary to it, let the non obstante relate whither
it will, the Decree (not to call it a defiance) is a plain recession from the
institution of Christ, and therefore the non obstante will refer to that
without any sensible error; and indeed for all the excuses to the contrary, the
Decree was not so discreetly framed but that in the very form of words, the
defiance and the non obstante is too plainly relative to the first words. For
what sense can there be in the first licet else? licet Christus in utraque
specie, and licet Ecclesia Primitiva, etc. tamen hoc non obstante, etc. the
first licet being a relative term, as well as the second licet, must be
bounded with some correspondent. But it matters not much; let them whom it
concerns enjoy the benefit of all excuses they can imagine, it is certain
Christ's institution and the Councels sanction are as contrary as light and
darkness. Is it possible for any man to contrive a way to make the Decree of
the Council of Trent, commanding the public Offices of the Church to be in
Latin, friends with the fourteenth chapter of the Corinthians? It is not
amiss to observe how the Hyperaspists of that Council sweat to answer the
Allegations of S. Paul, and the wisest of them do it so extremly poor, that
it proclaims to all the world that the strongest man, that is, cannot eat Iron
or swallow a Rock. Now then, would it not be an unspeakable Tyranny to all wise
persons, (who as much hate to have their souls enslaved as their bodies
imprisoned) to command them to believe that these Decrees are agreeable to the
word of God? Upon whose understanding soever these are imposed, they may at the
next Session reconcile them to a crime, and make any sin sacred, or persuade
him to believe propositions contradictory to a Mathematical demonstration. All
the Arguments in the world that can be brought to prove the infallibility of
Councels, can not make it so certain that they are infallible, as these two
instances do prove infallibly that these were deceived, and if ever we may
safely make use of our reason and consider whether Councels have erred or no,
we cannot by any reason be more assured, that they have or have not, then we
have in these particulars: so that either our reason is of no manner of use, in
the discussion of this Question, and the thing it self is not at all to be
disputed, or if it be, we are certain that these actually were deceived, and we
must never hope for a clearer evidence in any dispute. And if these be, others
might have been, if they did as these did, that is, depart from their Rule. And
it was wisely said of Cusanus: Notandum est experimento rerum universale
Concilium posse deficere: The experience L. 2. c. 14. Concord. Cathol.
of it is notorious, that Councels have erred: And all the Arguments against
experience are but plain sophistry.

And therefore I make no scruple to slight the Decrees of such Councels,
wherein the proceedings were as prejudicate Numb. 3.
and unreasonable, as in the Council wherein Abailardus was condemned, where
the presidents having pronounced Damnamus, they at the lower end being awaked
at the noise, heard the latter part of it, and concurred as far as Mnamus
went, and that was as good as Damnamus, for if they had been awake at the
pronouncing the whole word, they would have given sentence accordingly. But by
this means S. Bernard numbered the Epist. Abailardi. ad Heliss. conjugem.
major part of voices against his Adversary Abailardus: And as far as these
men did do their duty, the duty of Priests and Judges, and wise men; so we may
presume them to be assisted: But no further. But I am content this (because but
a private Assembly) shall pass for no instance: But what shall we say of all
the Arrian Councels celebrated with so great fancy, and such numerous
Assemblies? we all say that they erred. And it will not be sufficient to say
they were not lawful Councels: For they were convened by that Authority which
all the world knows did at that time convocate Councels, and by which (as it
is Cusanus, l. 2. cap. 25, Concord.
confessed and is notorious) the first eight Generals did meet, that is by the
Authority of the Emperor all were called, and as many and more did come to
them, then came to the most famous Council of Nice: So that the Councels were
lawful, and if they did not proceed lawfully, and therefore did err, this is
to say that Councels are then not deceived, when they do their duty, when they
judge impartially, when they decline interest, when they follow their Rule; but
this says also that it is not infallibly certain that they will do so; for
these did not, and therefore the others may be deceived as well as these were.
But another thing is in the wind; for Councels not confirmed by the Pope, have
no warrant that they shall not err, and they not being confirmed, therefore
faild. But whether is the Popes confirmation after the Decree or before? It
cannot be supposed before; for there is nothing to be confirmed till the Decree
be made, and the Article composed. But if it be after, then possibly the Popes
Decree may be requisite in solemnity of Law, and to make the Authority popular,
public and humane; but the Decree is true or false before the Popes
confirmation, and is not at all altered by the supervening Decree, which being
postnate to the Decree, alters not what went before, Nunquam enim crescit ex
postfacto praeteriti aestimatio, is the voice both of Law and reason. So that
it cannot make it divine, and necessary to be heartily believed. It may make it
lawful, not make it true, that is, it may possibly by such means become a Law
but not a truth. I speak now upon supposition the Popes confirmation were
necessary, and required to the making of conciliary and necessary sanctions.
But if it were, the case were very hard: For suppose a heresy should invade,
and possess the Chair of Rome, what remedy can the Church have in that case,
if a General Council be of no Authority without the Pope confirm it? will the
Pope confirm a Council against himself; will he condemn his own heresy? That
the Pope may be a Heretic appears in the Did. 40. Can. si Papa.
Canon Law, which says he may for heresy be deposed, and therefore by a
Council which in this case has plenary Authority without the Pope. And
therefore in the Synod at Rome held under Pope Adrian the Second, the Censure
of the Sixth Synod against Honorius who was convict of heresy, is approved with
this Appendix, that in this case the case of heresy, minores possint de
majoribus judicare: And therefore if a Pope were above a Council, yet when the
Question is concerning heresy, the case is altered; the Pope may be judged by
his inferiors, who in this case which is the maine case of all, become his
Superiors. And it is little better then impudence to pretend that all
Counsels were confirmed by the Pope, or that there is a necessity in respect
of divine obligation, that any should be confirmed by him, more then by another
of the Patriarchs. For the Council of Chalcedon it self one of those four
which S. Gregory did revere next to the four Evangelists, is rejected by Pope
Leo, who in his 53 Epistle to Anatolius, and in his 54 to Martian, and in his
55 to Pulcheria, accuses it of ambition and inconsiderate temerity, and
therefore no fit Assembly for the habitation of the holy Spirit, and Gelasius
in his Tome de vinculo Anathematis, affirms that the Council is in part to be
received, in part to be rejected, and compares it to heretical books of a mixed
matter, and proves his assertion by the place of S. Paul, Omnia probate, quod
bonum est retinete. And Bellarmine says the same; In Concilio Chalcedonensi
quaedam sunt bona, quaedam mala, quaedam recipienda, quaedam rejicienda; De
laicis, l. 3. c. 20. ad hoc ult.
ita and in libris haereticorum, and if any thing be false, then all is
Questionable, and judicable and discernable, and not infallible antecedently.
And however, that Council has ex postfacto, and by the voluntary consenting
of after Ages obtained great reputation; yet they that lived immediately after
it, that observed all the circumstances of the thing, and the disabilities of
the persons, and the uncertainty of the truth of its decrees, by reason of the
unconcludingnesse of the Arguments brought to attest it, were of another mind,
Quod autem ad Concilium Chalcedonense attinet, illud id temporis (viz.
Anastasii Imp.) neque palam in Ecclesiis sanctissimis praedicatum fuit, neque
ab omnibus rejectum, nam singuli Evagr. lib. 3. cap. 30.
Ecclesiarum praesides pro suo arbitratu in ea re egerunt. And so did all men
in the world that were not mastered with prejudices and undone in their
understanding with accidental impertinencies; they judged upon those grounds
which they had and saw, and suffered not themselves to be bound to the
imperious dictates of other men, who are as uncertain in their determinations
as other in their Questions. And it is an evidence that there is some
deception, and notable error either in the thing or in the manner of their
proceeding, when the Decrees of a Council shall have no authority from the
Compilers, nor no strength from the reasonableness of the decision, but from
the accidental approbation of Posterity: And if Posterity had pleased, Origin
had believed well and been an Orthodox person. And it was pretty sport to see
that Papias was right for two Ages together, and wrong ever since; and just so
it was in Councels, particularly in this of Chalcedon, that had a fate
alterable according to the Age, and according to the Climate, which to my
understanding is nothing else but an Argument that the business of
infallibility is a later device, and commenced to serve such ends as cannot be
justified by true and substantial grounds, and that the Pope should confirm it
as of necessity, is a fit cover for the same dish.

In the sixth General Council, Honorius Pope of Rome was condemned; did that
Council stay for the Popes Confirmation Numb. 4.
before they sent forth their Decree? Certainly they did not think it so
needful, as that they would have suspended or cassated the Decree, in case the
Pope had then disavowed it: For besides the condemnation of Pope Honorius for
heresy, the 13th and 55th Canons of that Council are expressly against the
custom of the Church of Rome. But this particular is involved in that new
Question, whether the Pope be above a Council. Now since the Contestation of
this Question, there was never any free or lawful Council Vid. postea de
Council. Sinvessane.. 6. N. 9.
that determined for the Pope, it is not likely any should, and is it likely
that any Pope will confirm a Council that does not? For the Council of Basil
is therefore condemned by the last Lateran which was an Assembly in the Popes
own Palace, and the Council of Constance is of no value in this Question, and
slighted in a just proportion, as that Article is disbelieved. But I will not
much trouble the Question with a long consideration of this particular; the
pretense is senseless and illiterate, against reason and experience, and
already determined by S. Austin sufficiently as to this particular, Epist. 162.
ad Glorium.
Ecce putemus illos Episcopos qui Romae judicaverunt non bonos judices fuisse,
Restabat adhuc plenarium Ecclesiae universae Concilium ubi etiam cum ipsis
judicibus causa possit agitari, ut si male judicasse convicti essent, eorum
sententiae solverentur. For since Popes may be parties, may be Simoniacks,
Schismatics, Heretics, it is against reason that in their own causes, they
should be judges, or that in any causes they should be superior to their
judges. And as it is against reason, so is it against all experience too; for
the Council Sinvessanum (as it said) was convened to take Cognizance of Pope
Marcellinus; and diverse Councels were held at Rome to give judgment in the
causes of Damasus, Sixtus the III, Symmachus, and Leo III and IV, as is to be
seen in Platina, and the Tomes of the Councels. And it is no answer to this and
the like allegations to say in matters of fact and humane constitution, the
Pope may be judged by a Council, but in matters of Faith all the world must
stand to the Popes determination and authoritative decision: For if the Pope
can by any color pretend to any thing, it is to a suprem Judicature in matters
Ecclesiastical, positive and of fact; and if he fails in this pretense, he
will hardly hold up his head for any thing else; for the ancient Bishops
derived their Faith from the fountain, and held that in the highest tenure,
even from Christ their Head; but by reason of the Imperial Vide Council.
Chalced act. 15.
City it became the principal Seat, and he surpised the highest Judicature,
partly by the concession of others, partly by his own accidental advantages,
and yet even in these things although he was major singulis, yet he was minor
universis: And this is no more then what was decreed of the eighth General
Act. ult. can. 21.
Synod; which if it be sense, is pertinent to this Question; for General
Councels are appointed to take Cognizance of Questions and differences about
the Bishop of Rome, non tamen audacter in eum far sententiam: By audacter, as
is supposed, is meant praecipitanter hastily and unreasonably; but if to give
sentence against him be wholly forbidden, it is nonsense, for to what purpose
is an Authority of taking Cognizance, if they have no power of giving sentence,
unless it were to deserre it to a superior Judge, which in this case cannot
be supposed? for either the Pope himself is to judge his own cause after their
examination of him, or the General Council is to judge him: So that although
the Council is by that Decree enjoined to proceed modestly and warily, yet
they may proceed to sentence, or else the Decree is ridiculous and impertinent.

But to clear all, I will instance in matters of Question and opinion: For not
only some Councels have made their Decrees Numb. 5.
without or against the Pope, but some Councels have had the Popes
confirmation, and yet have not been the more legitimate or obligatory, but are
known to be heretical. For the Canons of the sixth Synod although some of them
were made against the Popes, and the custom of the Church of Rome, a Pope a
while after did confirm the Council, and yet the Canons are impious and
heretical, and so esteemed by the Church of Rome her self. I instance in the
second Canon which approves of that Synod of Carthage under Cyprian for
rebaptization of Heretics, and the 72 Canon that dissolves marriage between
persons of differing persuasion in matters of Christian Religion; and yet these
Canons were approved by Pope Adrian I. who in his Epistle to Tharasius, which
is in the second action of the seventh Synod, calls them Canones divine and
legaliter praedicatos. And these Canons were used by Pope Nicholas I. in his
Epistle ad Michaclem, and by Innocent III. c. a multis. extra. de aetat.
ordinandorum. So that now (that we may apply this) there are seven General
Councels which by the Church of Rome are condemned of error. The Vid. Socra.
l. z. c. 5. and Sozom. l. 3. c. 5.
Council of Antioch, A. D. 345. in which S. Athanasius was condemned: The
Council of Millaine A. D. 354. of above 300 Bishops: The Council of Ariminum,
consisting of 600 Bishops: The second Council of Ephesus, A. D. 449. in which
the Eutychian heresy was confirmed, Gregor. in Regist. li. 3. cause. 7. ait.
Concilium Numidiae errasse. Concilium Aquisgrani erravit. De ra ptore and
raptadist. 20. can. de libellis. in glossa.
and the Patriarch Flavianus killed by the faction of Dioscorus: The Council of
Constantinople under Leo Isaurus, A. D. 730: And another at Constantinople 35
years after: And lastly, the Council at Pisa 134 years since. Now that these
General Councels are condemned, is a sufficient Argument that Councels may
err; and it is no answer to say they were not confirmed by the Pope; for the
Popes confirmation I have shown not to be necessary, or if it were, yet even
that also is an Argument that General Councels may become invalid, either by
their own fault, or by some extrinsecall supervening accident, either of which
evacuates their Authority; and whether all that is required to the legitimation
of a Council, was actually observed in any Council, is so hard to determine,
that no man can be infallibly sure that such a Council is authentic and
sufficient probation.

2. And that is the second thing I shall observe, There are so many Questions
concerning the efficient, the form, the Numb. 6.
matter of General Counsels, and their manner of proceeding, and their final
sanction, that after a Question is determined by a Conciliary Assembly, there
are perhaps twenty more Questions to be disputed before we can with confidence
either believe the Council upon its mere Authority, or obtrude it upon
others. And upon this ground, how easy it is to elude the pressure of an
Argument drawn from the Authority of a General Council, is very remarkable in
the Question about the Popes or the Councels Superiority, which Question
although it be defined for the Council against the Pope by five General
Councels, the Council of Florence, of Constance, of Basil, of Pisa, and one of
the Lateran's, yet the Jesuits to this day, account this Question pro non
definita, and have rare pretenses for their escape; as first, It is true, a
Council is above a Pope, in case there be no Pope, or he uncertain; which is
Bellarmine's answer, never considering whether he spoke sense or no, nor yet
remembering that the Council of Basil deposed Eugenius who was a true Pope and
so acknowledged. Secondly, sometimes the Pope did not confirm these Councels,
that is their Answer: (And although it was an exception that the Fathers never
thought of, when they were pressed with the Authority of the Council of
Ariminum or Syrmium, or any other Arrian Convention;) yet the Council of Basil
was convened by Pope Martin V. then, in its sixteenth Session, declared by
Eugenius the IV. to be lawfully continued and confirmed expressly in some of its
Decrees by Pope Nicholas, and so stood till it was at last rejected by Leo X.
very many years after; but that came too late, and with too visible an
interest; and this Council did decree fide Catholica tenendum Concilium esse
supra Papam: But if one Pope confirms it, and another rejects it, as it
happened in this case and in many more, does it not destroy the competency of
the Authority? and we see it by this instance, that it so serves the turns of
men, that it is good in some cases, that is, when it makes for them, and
invalid when it makes against them. Thirdly, but it is a little more ridiculous
in the case of the Council of Constance, whose Decrees were confirmed by
Martin V. But that this may be no Argument against them, Bellarmine tells you
he only confirmed those things quae facta fuerant Conciliariter, re diligenter
examinata, of which there being no mark, nor any certain Rule to judge it, it
is a device that may evacuate any thing we have a mind to, it was not done
Conciliariter, that is, not according to our mind; for Conciliariter is a fine
new nothing, that may signify what you please. Fourthly, but other devices yet
more pretty they have: As, Whether the Council of Lateran was a General
Council or no, they know not, (no nor will not know) which is a wise and
plain reservation of their own advantages, to make it General or not
General, as shall serve their turns. Fifthly, as for the Council of Florence,
they are not sure, whether it has defined the Question satis aperte; aperte
they will grant, if you will allow them not satis aperte. Sixthly and lastly,
the Council of Pisa is neque approbatum neque reprobatum, which is the
greatest folly of all and most prodigious vanity; so that by Bellar. de conc.
l. 1. c. 8.
something or other, either they were not convened lawfully, or they did not
proceed Conciliariter, or it is not certain that the Council was General or
no, or whether the Council were approbatum, or reprobatum or else it is partim
confirmatum partim reprobatum, or else it is neque approbatum neque reprobatum;
By one of these ways or a device like to these, all Councels and all Decrees
shall be made to signify nothing, and to have no Authority.

3. There is no General Council that has determined Numb. 7.
that a General Council is infallible: No Scripture has recorded it; no
Tradition universal has transmitted to us any such proposition; So that we
must receive the Authority at a lower rate, and upon a less probability then
the things consigned by that Authority. And it is strange that the Decrees of
Councels should be esteemed authentic and infallible, and yet it is not
infallibly certain, that the Councels themselves are infallible, because the
belief of the Councels infallibility is not proved to us by any medium, but
such as may deceive us.

4. But the best instance that Councels are some and may all be deceived, is
the contradiction of one Council to another; Numb. 8.
for in that case both cannot be true, and which of them is true, must belong
to another judgment, which is less then the solennity of a General Council;
and the determination of this matter can be of no greater certainty after it is
concluded, then when it was propounded as a Question, being it is to be
determined by the same Authority or by a less then it self. But for this
allegation, we cannot want instances; The Council of Trent allows picturing
of God the Father; The Council of Nice altogether disallowes it; The same
Nicene Sess. 25.
Council, which was the seventh General, allows of picturing Christ in the
form of a Lamb; But the sixth Synod by no Act. 2.
means will endure it, as Caranza affirms: The Council of Neocaesarea
confirmed by Leo IV, did. 20. de libellis, and approved Can. 82.
by the first Nicene Council as it is said in the seventh Session of the
Council of Florence, forbids second Marriages, and imposes Penances on them
that are married the second time, forbidding Priests to be present at such
Marriage Feasts: Besides, that this is expressly against the Doctrine of S.
Paul, it is also against the Doctine of the Council of Laodicea which took off
such Cap. 1.
Penances, and pronounced second Marriages to be free and lawful: Nothing is
more discrepant then the third Council of Carthage and the Council of
Laodicea, about assignation of the Canon of Scripture, and yet the sixth
General Synod approves both: And I would feign know if all General Councels
are of the same mind with the Fathers of the Council of Carthage, who reckon
into the Canon five Books of Solomon. I am sure S. Austin reckoned but three,
and I think all Christendom L. 17. de cul. Dei. c. 20.
beside are of the same opinion. And if we look into the title of the Law de
Conciliis, called Concordantia discordantiarum, we shall find instances enough
to confirm that the Decrees of some Councels are contradictory to others, and
that no wit can reconcile them: And whether they did or no, that they might
disagree, and former Councels be corrected by later, was the belief of the
Doctors in those Ages in which the best and most famous Councels were convened,
as appears in that famous saying of S. Austin speaking concerning the
rebaptizing of Heretics; and how much the Africans were deceived in that
Question, he answers the Allegation of the Bishops Letters, and those National
Councels which confirmed S. Cyprians opinion by saying that they were no final
determination. For Episcoporum literae emendari possunt a Conciliis
nationalibus, L. 2. de bapt. Donat. c. 3.
Concilia nationalia a plenariis, ipsaque plenaria priora a posterioribus
emendari. Not only the occasion of the Question being a matter not of fact, but
of Faith, as being instanced in the Question of rebaptization: but also the
very fabric and economy of the words, put by all the answers of those men who
think themselves pressed with the Authority of S. Austin. For as National
Councels may correct the Bishops Letters, and General Councels may correct
National, so the later General may correct the former, that is, have contrary
and better Decrees of manners, and better determinations in matters of faith.
And from hence has risen a Question whether is to be received the former or
the later Councels, in case they contradict each other. The former are nearer
the fountains Apostolical, the later are of greater consideration; The first,
have more Authority, the later more reason; The first are more venerable, the
later more inquisitive and seeing. And now what rule shall we have to determine
out beliefes, whether to Authority, or Reason the Reason and the Authority both
of them not being the highest in their kind, both of them being repudiable,
and at most but probable? And here it is that this great uncertainty is such as
not to determine any body, but fit to serve every body; and it is sport to see
that Bellarmine will by all means have the Council of Carthage preferred
before the Council of Laodicea, because it is later, and L. 2. de Conc. c. 8.
respondeo in primis.
yet he preferres the second Nicene Ibid. de Concilio autem.
Council before the Council of Frankfurt, because it is elder: S. Austin
would have the former Generals to be mended by the later; but Isidore in
Gratian says when Councels do differ scandum esse antiquioribus, the elder
must carry it: And indeed these probables are Did. 20. Can. Domino Sancto.
buskins to serve every foot, and they are like magnum and parvum, they have
nothing of their own, all that they have is in comparison of others; so these
topics have nothing of resolute and dogmaticall truth, but in relation to such
ends as an interessed person has a mind to serve upon them.

5. There are many Councels corrupted, and many pretended and alleged, when
there were no such things, both which Numb. 9.
make the topic of the Authority of Councels to be little and inconsiderable:
There is a Council brought to light in the edition of Councels by Binius, viz.
Sinvessanum, pretended to be kept in the year 303, but it was so private till
then, that we find no mention of it in any ancient Record: Neither Eusebius,
nor Ruffinus, S, Hierom, nor Socrates, Sozomen, nor Theodoret, nor Eutropius,
nor Bid knew any thing of it, and the eldest allegation of it is by Pope
Nicholas I, in the ninth Century. And he that shall consider that 300 Bishops
in the midst of horrid Persecutions (for so then they were) are pretended to
have convened, will need no greater Argument to suspect the imposture; besides,
he that was the framer of the engine did not lay his ends together handsomely,
for it is said that the deposition of Marcellinus by the Synod was told to
Diocletian, when he was in the Persian War, when as it is known before that
time he had returned to Rome, and triumphed for his Persian Conquest as
Eusebius in his Chronicle reports: And this is so plain that Binius and
Baronius pretend the Text to be corrupted and to go to Pro [cum esset in bello
Persarum] legi volunt [cum reversus esset e bello Persarum] Eusebius. Chronicon
vide Binium in notis ad Council. Sinvessanum. Tom. 1. Council. and Baron. Annal.
Tom. 3. A. D. 303. number. 107.
mend it by such an emendation as is a plain contradiction to the sense, and
that so un-clerk-like, viz. by putting in two words and leaving out one, which
whether it may be allowed them by any license less then Poetical let Critics
judge. S. Gregory says that the Constantinopolitans had corrupted the Synod of
I. 5. Ep. 14. ad Narsem.
Chalcedon, and that he suspected the same concerning the Ephesine Council:
And in the fifth Synod there was a notorious prevarication, for there were
false Epistles of Pope Vigilius and Menna the Patriarch of Constantinople
inserted, and so they passed for authentic till they were discovered in the
sixth General Synod, Actions the 12. and 14: And not only false Decrees and
Actions may creep into the Codes of Councels; but sometimes the authority of a
learned man may abuse the Church with pretended Decrees, of which there is no
Copy or shadow in the Code it self: And thus Thomas Aquinas says that the
Epistle to the Hebrews was reckoned in the Canon Comment. in Hebr.
by the Nicene Council, no shadow of which appears in those Copies we now have
of it; and this pretense and the reputation of the man prevailed so far with
Melchior Canus the learned Bishop of Canaries, that he believed it upon this
ground, Vir sanctus rem adeo gravem non astrueret, nisi compertum habuisset;
and there are many things which have prevailed upon less reason and a more
slight Authority. And that very Council of Nice, has not only been pretended
by Aquinas, but very much abused by others, and its Authority and great
reputation has made it more liable to the fraud and pretenses of idle people:
For whereas the Nicene Fathers made but twenty Canons, for so many and no more
were received by Con. Carthag. VI. cap. 9.
Cecilian of Carthage, that was at Nice in the Council; by S. Con. African.
Austin, and 200 African Bishops with him, by S. Ibid. c. 102. etc. 133.
Cyrill of Alexandria, by Lib. 1. Eccl. Hist. c. 6.
Atticus of Constantinople, by Ruffinus, In princ. Con. de Synod. Princ.
Isidore and Theodoret, as Baronius, tom. 3. A. D. 325. n. 156. Tom. 3. ad A.
D. 325. n. 62 63.
Baronius witnesses, yet there are fourscore lately found out in an Arabian M.
S. and published in Latin by Turrian and Alfonsus of Pisa Jesuits surely, and
like to be masters of the mint. And not only the Canons, but the very Acts of
the Nicene Council are false and spurious, and are so confessed by Baronius;
though how he and Panopl. l. 2. c. 6.
Lindanus will be reconciled upon the point, I neither know well nor much care.
Now if one Council be corrupted, we see by the instance of S. Gregory, that
another may be suspected and so all; because he found the Council of Chalcedon
corrupted, he suspected also the Ephesine, and another might have suspected
more, for the Nicene was tampered foully with, and so three of the four
Generals were fullied and made suspicious, and therefore we could not be secure
of any; If false Acts be inserted in one Council, who can trust the actions of
any, unless he had the keeping the Records himself, or durst swear for the
Register: And if a very learned man (as Thomas Aquinas was,) did either
wilfully deceive us, or was himself ignorantly abused in Allegation of a Canon
which was not, it is but a very fallible Topic at the best, and the most holy
man that is, may be abused himself, and the wisest may deceive others.

6. And lastly, To all this and to the former instances, by way of Corollary, I
add some more particulars in which it is notorious Numb. 10.
that Councels General, and National, that is, such as were either General
by Original, or by adoption into the Canon of the Catholic Church did err,
and were actually deceived. The first Council of Toledo admits to the
Communion him that has a Concubine, so he have no wife besides, and this
Council is approved by Pope Leo in the 92 Epistle to Rusticus Bishop of
Narbona: Gratian says that the Council means by a Concubine, a wife married
sine dote and solennitate; but this is Did. 34. can. omnibus.
dawbing with untemper'd mortar. For though it was a custom amongst the Jews
to distinguish Wives from their Concubines, by Dowry and legal Solennities,
yet the Christian distinguished them no otherwise, then as lawful and
unlawful, then as Chastity and Fornication: And besides, if by a Concubine is
meant a lawful wife without a Dowry, to what purpose should the Council make
a Law that such a one might be admitted to the Communion? for I suppose it was
never thought to be a Law of Christianity, that a man should have a Portion
with his Wife, nor he that married a poor Virgin should deserve to be
Excommunicate. So that Gratian and his Followers are pressed so with this Canon,
that to avoid the impiety of it, they expound it to a signification without
sense or purpose. But the business then was, that Adultery was so public and
notorious a practice that the Council did choose rather to endure simple
Fornication, that by such permission of a less, they might slacken the public
custom of a greater, just as at Rome they permit Stews to prevent unnatural
sins; But that by a public sanction Fornicators, habitually and notoriously
such, should be admitted to the holy Communion was an act of Priests, so unfit
for Priests, that no excuse can make it white or clean. The Council of Worms
does authorize a superstitious custom at that time too much used, of Cap. 3.
discovering stolen goods by the holy Sacrament, which Part. 3. q 80. a. 6. ad 3
m.
Aquinas justly condemns for Superstition. The Can. 72.
sixth Synod separates persons lawfully married upon an accusation and crime of
heresy: The Roman Council under Can ego Berengar. de consecrat. did. 2.
Pope Nicholas II. defined that not only the Sacrament of Christ's body, but the
very body it self of our blessed Savior is handled and broke by the hands of
the Priest, and chewed by the teeth of the Communicants, which is a manifest
error derogatory from the truth of Christ's beatificall Resurrection, and
glorification in the Heavens, and disavowed by the Church of Rome it self: But
Bellarmine that answers all the Arguments in the world, whither it be possible
or not possible, would feign make the Lib. 2. c. 8. de Council.
matter fair, and the Decree tolerable, for says he, the Decree means that
the body is broken not in it self but in the sign, and yet the Decree says
that not only the Sacrament (which if any thing be, is certainly the sign) but
the very body it self is broken and champed with hands and teeth respectively;
which indeed was nothing but a plain over-acting the Article in contradiction
to Berengarius. And the answer of Bellarmine is not sense; for he denies that
the body it self is broken in it self (that was the error we charged upon
the Roman Synod) and the sign abstracting from the body is not broken, (for
that was the opinion that Council condemned in Berengarius) but says
Bellarmine, the body in the sign: What Is that? for neither the sign, nor the
body, nor both together are broken: For if either of them distinctly, they
either rush upon the error which the Roman Synod condemned in Berengarius, or
upon that which they would fain excuse in Pope Nicholas; but if both are broken
then it is true to affirm it of either, and then the Council is blasphemous in
saying that Christ's glorified body is passible and frangible by natural
manducation: So that it is and it is not, it is not this way, and yet it is no
way else, but it is some way, and they know not how, and the Council spoke
blasphemy, but it must be made innocent; and therefore, it was requisite a
cloud of a distinction should be raised, that the unwary Reader might be
amused, and the Decree escape untoucht; but the truth is, they that undertake to
justify all that other men say, must be more subtle then they that said it,
and must use such distinctions which possibly the first Authors did not
understand. But I will multiply no more instances, for what instance soever I
shall bring, some or other will be answering it, which thing is so far from
satisfying me in the particulars, that it increases the difficulty in the
general, and satisfies me in my first belief: For Illa demum cis videntur
edicta and Concilia quae in rem suam faciunt; reliqua non pluris aestimant quam
conventum muliercularum in textrina vel thermis. Ludo. Vives. in Scholiis lib.
20. Aug. de Civit. Dei. c. 26.
if no Decrees of Councels can make against them though they seem never so
plain against them, then let others be allowed the same liberty, (and there is
all the reason in the world they should) and no Decree shall conclude against
any Doctrine, that they have already entertained; and by this means the Church
is no fitter instrument to Decree Controversies then the Scripture it self,
there being as much obscurity and disputing in the sense, and the manner, and
the degree, and the competency, and the obligation of the Decree of a Council,
as of a place of Scripture. And what are we the nearer for a Decree, if any
Sophister shall think his elusion enough to contest against the Authority of a
Council? yet this they do, that pretend highest for their Authority, which
consideration or some like it might possibly make Gratian prefer S. Hierom's
single 36. q. 2. c. placuit.
Testimony before a whole Council, because he had Scripture of his side;
which says, that the Authority of Councels is not (...), and that Councels may
possibly recede from their Rule, from Scripture; and in that case, a single
person proceeding according to Rule is a better Argument; which indeed was the
saying of Panormitan, in concernentibus Part. 1. de election. Et elect. potest.
cap. significant.
fidem etiam dictum unius privati esset dicto Pape aut totius Concilii
praeferendum, si ille moveretur melioribus Argumentis.

I end this Discourse with representing the words of Gregory Nazianzen in his
Epistle to Procopius; Ego si vera scribere Numb. 11.

fugiam, quoniam nullius Concilii finem laetum faustumque vidi, nec quod
depulsionem malorum potius quam accessionem and incrementum habuerit: But I
will not be so severe and dogmaticall against them: For I believe many Councels
to have been called with sufficient Authority, to have been managed with singular
piety and prudence, and to have been finished with admirable success and
truth. And where we find such Councels, he that will not with all veneration
believe their Decrees, and receive their sanctions, understands not that great
duty he owes to them who have the care of our souls, whose faith we are bound
to follow (says S. Paul) that is so long as they follow Christ, and certainly
many Councels have done so: But Heb. 13. 7.
this was then when the public interest of Christendom was better conserved
in determining a true Article, then in finding a discreet temper, or a wise
expedient to satisfy disagreeing persons; (As the Fathers at Trent did, and
the Lutherans and Calvinists did at Sendomir in Polonia; and the Sublapsarians
and Supralapsarians did at Dort:) It was in Ages when the sum of Religion did
not consist in maintaining the Grandezza of the Papacy; where there was no
order of men with a fourth Vow upon them to advance S. Peter's Chair; when
there was no man, nor any company of men, that esteemed themselves infallible,
and therefore they searched for truth as if they meant to find it, and would
believe it if they could see it proved, not resolved to prove it because they
had upon chance or interest believed it; then they had rather have spoken a
truth, then upheld their reputation, but only in order to truth. This was done
sometimes, and when it was done, God's Spirit never failed them, but gave them
such assistances as were sufficient to that good end for which they were
Assembled, and did implore his aid: And therefore it is that the four general
Councels so called by way of eminency, have gained so great a reputation above
all others, not because they had a better promise, or more special
assistances, but because they proceeded better according to the Rule, with
less faction, without ambition and temporal ends.

And yet those very Assemblies of Bishops had no Authority by their Decrees to
make a Divine Faith, or to constitute Numb. 12.
new objects of necessary Credence; they made nothing true that was not so
before, and therefore they are to be apprehended in the nature of excellent
Guides, and whose Decrees are most certainly to determine all those who have no
Argument to the contrary of greater force and efficacy then the Authority or
reasons of the Council. And there is a duty owing to every Parish Priest, and
to every Dioecesan Bishop; these are appointed over us and to answer for our
souls, and are therefore morally to guide us, as reasonable Creatures are to
be guided, that is, by reason and discourse: For in things of judgment and
understanding, they are but in form next above Beasts, that are to be ruled by
the imperiousness and absoluteness of Authority, unless the Authority be
Divine, that is, infallible. Now then in a juster height, but still in its true
proportion, Assemblies of Bishops are to guide us with a higher Authority,
because in reason it is supposed they will do it better, with more Argument
and certainty, and with Decrees, which have the advantage by being the results
of many discourses of very wise and good men: But that the Authority of
general Councels, was never esteemed absolute, infallible and unlimited,
appears in this, that before they were obliging, it was necessary that each
particular Church respectively should accept them, Concurrente universali
totius Ecclesiae consensu, etc. Vid. S. August. 1. l. c. 18. de bapt. contr.
Donat.
in declaratione veritatum quae credendae sunt etc. That Is the way of making
the Deerees of Councels become authentik, and be turned into a Law as Gerson
observes; and till they did, their Decrees were but a dead letter (and
therefore it is that these later Popes have so labored, that the Council of
Trent should be received in France; and Carolus Molineus a great Lawyer, and of
the Roman Communion disputed So did the third Estate of France in the
Convention of the three Estates under Lewis the 13th earnestly contend against
it.
against the reception,) and this is a known condition in the Canon Law, but it
proves plainly that the Decrees of Councels have their Authority from the
voluntary submission of the particular Churches, not from the prime sanction
and constitution of the Council. And there is great reason it should; for as
the representative body of the Church derives all power from the diffusive body
which is represented, so it resolves into it, and though it may have all the
legal power, yet it has not all the natural; for more able men may be
unsent, then sent; and they who are sent may be wrought upon by stratagem,
which cannot happen to the whole diffusive Church; it is therefore most fit
that since the legal power, that is, the external was passed over to the body
representative, yet the efficacy of it, and the internal should so still
remain in the diffusive, as to have power to consider whether their
representatives did their duty yea or no, and so to proceed accordingly: For
unless it be in matters of justice, in which the interest of a third person is
concerned, no man will or can be supposed to pass away all power from himself
of doing himself right, in matters personal, proper, and of so high
concernment: It is most unnatural and unreasonable. But besides, that they are
excellent instruments of peace, the best humane Judicatories in the world, rare
Sermons for the determining a point in Controversy, and the greatest
probability from humane Authority, besides these advantages (I say) I know
nothing greater that general Councels can pretend to with reason and Argument
sufficient to satisfy any wise man: And as there was never any Council so
general, but it might have been more general; for in respect of the whole
Church, even Nice it self was but a small Assembly; so there is no Decree so
well constituted, but it may be proved by an Argument higher then the Authority
of the Council: And therefore general Councels, and National, and
Provincial, and Dioecesan in their several degrees, are excellent Guides for
the Prophets and directions and instructions for their Prophesyings, but not of
weight and Authority to restrain their Liberty so wholly, but that they may
dissent when they see a reason strong enough so to persuade them, as to be
willing upon the confidence of that reason and their own sincerity, to answer
to God for such their modesty, and peaceable, but (as they believe) their
necessary disagreeing.

SECT. VII.
Of the fallibility of the Pope, and the uncertainty of his Expounding
Scripture, and resolving Questions.

BUt since the Question between the Council and the Pope Numb. 1.
grew high, there have not wanted abettors so confident on the Popes behalf,
as to believe General Councels to be nothing but Pompes and Solennities of the
Catholic Church, and that all the Authority of determining Controversies is
formally and effectually in the Pope. And therefore to appeal from the Pope to
a future Council is a heresy, yea, and Treason too said Pope Pius II, and
therefore it concerns us now Epist. ad Norimberg.
to be wise and wary. But before I proceed, I must needs remember that Pope
Pius II, while he was the wise and learned Patrum and avorum nostrorum tempore
pauci audebant dicere Papam esse supra Concilium. l. 1. de gestis Council. Basil.
Aeneas Sylvius, was very confident for the pre-eminence of a Council, and
gave a merry reason why more Clerks were for the Popes then the Council,
though the truth was on the other side, even because the Pope gives Bishoprics
and Abbeys, but Councels give none; and yet as soon as he was made Pope, as if
he had been inspired, his eyes were open to see the great privileges of S.
Peter's Chair, which before he could not see, being amused with the truth, or
else with the reputation of a General Council. But however, there are many
that hope to make it good, that the Pope is the Universal and the infallible
Doctor, that he breathes Decrees as Oracles, that to dissent from any of his
Cathedral determinations is absolute heresy, the Rule of Faith being nothing
else but consormity to the Chair of Peter. So that here we have met a
restraint of Prophecy indeed; but yet to make amends, I hope we shall have an
infallible Guide, and when a man is in Heaven, he will never complain that his
choice is taken from him, and that he is confined to love and to admire, since
his love and his admiration is fixed, upon that which makes him happy, even upon
God himself. And in the Church of Rome there is in a lower degree, but in a
true proportion as little cause to be troubled, that we are confined to believe
just so, and no choice left us for our understandings to discover or our wills
to choose, because though we be limited, yet we are pointed out where we ought
to rest, we are confined to our Center, and there where our understandings will
be satisfied, and therefore will be quiet, and where after all our strivings,
studies and endeavors we desire to come, that is, to truth, for there we are
secured to find it, because we have a Guide that is infallible: If this prove
true, we are well enough. But if it be false or uncertain, it were better we
had still kept our liberty, then be cozened out of it with gay pretenses. This
then we must consider.

And here we shall be oppressed with a cloud of Witnesses: For what more plain
then the Commission given to Peter? Numb. 2.
Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church. And to thee will I
give the Keys. And again, for thee have I prayed that thy faith fail not; but
thou when thou art converted confirm thy brethren; And again, If thou love me
feed my sheep: Now nothing of this being spoken to any of the other Apostles,
by one of these places S. Peter must needs be appointed Foundation or Head of
the Church, and by consequence he is to rule and govern all. By some other of
these places he is made the supreme Pastor, and he is to teach and determine
all, and enabled with an infallible power so to do: And in a right
understanding of these Authorities, the Fathers speak great things of the
Chair of Peter; for we are as much bound to believe that all this was spoken
to Peter's Successors, as to his Person; that must by all means be supposed,
and so did the old Doctors, who had as much certainty of it as we have, and no
more; but yet let us hear what they have said, Irenae. contra. haeres. l. 3. c.

that is his final sentence: But if you would have all this proved by an
infallible Argument, L. 2. contra. Parmenian.

operculum! This long harangue must needs be full of tragedy to all them that
take liberty to themselves to follow Scripture and their best Guides, if it
happens in that liberty that they depart from the persuasions or the Communion
of Rome: But indeed, if with the peace of the Bishops of Rome I may say it,
this Scene is the most unhandsomely laid, and the worst carried of any of those
pretenses that have lately abused Christendom.

1. Against the Allegations of Scripture, I shall lay no greater Numb. 3.
prejudice then this, that if a person dis-interested should see them, and
consider what the products of them might possibly be, the last thing that he
would think of, would be how that any of these places should serve the ends or
pretenses of the Church of Rome: For to instance in one of the particulars,
that man had need have a strong fancy who imagines that because Christ prayed
for S. Peter, that (being he had designed him to be one of those upon whose
preaching and Doctrine he did mean to constitute a Church) that his faith
might not fail, (for it was necessary that no bitterness or stopping should
be in one of the first springs, least the current be either spoiled or
obstructed) that therefore the faith of Pope Alexander VI, or Gregory, or
Clement 1500 years after, should be be preserved by virtue of that prayer,
which the form of words, the time, the occasion, the manner of the address,
the effect it self, and all the circumstances of the action and person did
determine to be personal: And when it was more then personal, S. Peter did
not represent his Successors at Rome, but 22ae. q. 2. a. 6. ar. 6. ad 3 m.
the whole Catholic Church, says Aquinas and the Divines of the University of
Paris, Volunt enim pro sola Ecclesia esse L. 4. de Roman. Pont. c. 3. 1.
oratum, says Bellarmine of them, and the gloss upon the Canon Law plainly
denies the effect of this prayer at all to appertain to the Pope: Quaere de qua
Ecclesia intelligas quod hoc dicitur quod Cause. 21. cap. a recta. q. 1.
non possit errare, si de ipso Papa qui Ecclesia dicitur? sed certum est quod
Papa errare potest -- Respondeo ipsa Congregatio fidelium hic dicitur Ecclesia,
and talis Ecclesia non potest non esse, 29. did. Ana. statius 60. did. si
Papa.
nam ipse Dominus orat pro Ecclesia, and voluntate labiorum suorum non
fraudabitur. But there is a little danger in this Argument when we well
consider it; but it is likely to redound on the head of them whose turns it
should serve: For it may be remembered that for all this prayer of Christ for S.
Peter, the good man sell foully, and denied his Master shamefully: And shall
Christ's prayer be of greater efficacy for his Successors, for whom it was made
but indirectly and by consequence, then for himself, for whom it was directly
and in the first intention? And if not, then for all this Argument, the Popes
may deny Christ as well as their chief and Decessor Peter. But it would not be
forgotten how the Roman Doctors will by no means allow that S. Peter was then
the chief Bishop or Pope, when he denied his Master. But then much less was
he chosen chief Bishop, when the prayer was made for him, because the prayer
was made before his fall; that is, before that time in which it is confessed,
he was not as yet made Pope: And how then the whole Succession of the Papacy
should be entitled to it, passes the length of my hand to span. But then also
if it be supposed and allowed, that these words shall intaile infallibility
upon the Chair of Rome, why shall not also all the Apostolical Sees be
infallible as well as Rome? why shall not Constaentinople or Byzantium where S.
Andrew sat? why shall not Ephesus where S. John sat? or Jerusalem where S.
James sat? for Christ prayed for them all, ut Pater sanctificaret eos sua
veritate, Joh. 17.

2. For [tibi dabo claves,] was it personal or not? If it were, then the
Bishops of Rome have nothing to do with it: Numb. 4.
If it were not, then by what Argument will it be made evident that S. Peter,
in the promise represented only his Successors, and not the whole College of
Apostles, and the whole Hierarchy? For if S. Peter was chief of the Apostles,
and Head of the Church, he might fair enough be the representative of the
whole College, and receive it in their right as well as his own; which also is
certain that it was so, for the same promise of binding and loosing, (which
certainly was all that the keys were given for) was made afterward to all the
Apostles, Mat. 18. and the power of remitting and retaining which in reason and
according to the style of the Church is the same thing in other words, was
actually given to all the Apostles, and unless that was the performing the
first and second promise, we find it not recorded in Scripture how or when or
whether yet or no, the promise be performed: That promise I say which did not
pertain to Peter principally and by origination, and to the rest by
Communication, society and adherence, but that promise which was made to Peter
first, but not for himself, but for all the College and for all their
Successors, and then made the second time to them all, without representation
but in diffusion, and performed to all alike in presence except S. Thomas. And
if he went to S. Peter to derive it from him, I know not; I find no record for
that, but that Christ conveyed the promise to him by the same Commission, the
Church yet never doubted, nor had she any reason. But this matter is too
notorious: I say no more to it, but repeat the words and Argument of S. Austin,
Si hoc Petro tantum dictum est, non facit hoc Ecclesia: If the Keys were only
given and so promised to S. Peter, that Tra. 50. in Ioann.
the Church has not the Keys, then the Church can neither bind nor loose,
remit nor retain, which God forbid; if any man should endeavor to answer this
Argument, I leave him and S. Austin to contest it.

3. For pasce oves there is little in that Allegation, besides the boldness of
the Objectors; for were not all the Apostles Numb. 5.
bound to feed Christ's sheep? had they not all the Commission from Christ, and
Christ's Spirit immediately? S. Paul had certainly; did not S. Peter himself
say to all the Bishops of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithinia, that
they should feed the flock of God, and the great Bishop and Shepherd should
give them an immarcescible Crown; plainly implying, that from whence they
derived their Authority, from him they were sure of a reward: In pursuance of
which S. Cyprian laid his Argument upon this basis, Nam cum statutum sit
omnibus L. 1. Epist. 3.
nobis, etc. and singulis pastoribus portio gregis, etc. Did not S. Paul call
to the Bishops of Ephesus to feed the flock of God, of which the holy Ghost
has made them Bishops or Overseers? and that this very Commission was spoken
to Peter not in a personal, but a public capacity, and in him spoke to all
the Apostles we see attested by S. Austin, and S. Ambrose and generally by all
Antiquity; De agone Christi, c, 30.
and it so concerned even every Priest that Damasus was willing enough to have
S. Hierom explicate many questions for him. And Liberius writes an Epistle to
Athanasius with much modesty requiring his advice in a Question of Faith,
Epist. ad Athanas. apud Athanas. tom. 1. page 42. Paris.
(...). That I also may be persuaded without all doubting of those things which
you shall be pleased to command me. Now Liberius needed not to have troubled
himself to have writ into the East to Athanasius; for if he had but seated
himself in his Chair, and made the dictate, the result of his pen and ink
would certainly have taught him and all the Church; but that the good Pope was
ignorant that either pasce oves was his own Charter, and Prerogative, or that
any other words of Scripture had made him to be infallible, or if he was not
ignorant of it, he did very ill to complement himself out of it. So did all
those Bishops of Rome that in that troublesome and unprofitable Question of
Easter, being unsatisfied in the supputation of the Egyptians, and the
definitions of the Mathematical Bishops of Alexandria, did yet require and
entreat S. Ambrose to tell them his opinion, as he himself witnesses; If pasce
oves belongs only to the Pope by primary title, in these L. 10. Epist. 83.
cases the sheep came to feed the Shepherd, which though it was well enough in
the thing, is very ill for the pretensions of the Roman Bishops; and if we
consider how little many of the Popes have done toward feeding the sheep of
Christ, we shall hardly determine which is the greater prevarication, that the
Pope should claim the whole Commission to be granted to him, or that the
execution of the Commission should be wholly passed over to others; and it may
be there is a mystery in it, that since S. Peter sent a Bishop with his staff
to raise up a Disciple of his from the dead, who was afterward Bishop of
Triers, the Popes of Rome never wear a Pastoral staff except it be in that
Diocese (says Aquinas) for great reason that he who does not do the office,
should not bear the M. 4. Sent. did. 24.
Symbol; but a man would think that the Popes Master of the Ceremonies was ill
advised not to assign a Pastoral staff to him, who pretends the Commission
of pasce oves to belong to him by prime right and origination. But this is not
a business to be merry in.

But the great support is expected from Tu es Petrus and super Numb. 6.
hanc Petram adificabo Ecclesiam, etc. Now there being so great difference in
the exposition of these words, by persons dis-interressed, who, if any, might
be allowed to judge in this Question, it is certain that neither one sense nor
other can be obtruded for an Article of faith, much less as a Catholicon
instead of all, by constituting an Authority which should guide us in all
Faith, and determine us in all Questions: For if the Church was not built upon
the person of Peter, then his Successors can challenge nothing from this
instance; now that it was the confession of Peter upon which the Church was to
rely for ever, we have witnesses very credible, Ad Philadelph.

S. Cyrill of Alexandria, L. 1. Ep. 235.
Isidore Pelusiot, and very many more. And although all these witnesses
concurring cannot make a proposition to be true, yet they are sufficient
witnesses, that it was not the Universal belief of Christendom that the
Church was built upon S. Peter's person. Cardinal Perron has a fine fancy to
elude this variety of Exposition, and the consequents of it; For (says he)
these Expositions are not contrary or exclusive of each other, but inclusive
and consequent to each other: For the Church is founded causally upon the
confession of S. Peter, formally upon the ministry of his person, and this was
a reward or a consequent of the former: So that these Expositions are both
true, but they are conjoined as mediate and immediate, direct and collateral,
literal and moral, original and perpetual, accessory and temporal, the one
consigned at the beginning, the other introduced upon occasion: For before the
spring of the Arrian heresy, the Fathers expounded these words of the person of
Peter; but after the Arrians troubled them, the Fathers finding great
Authority, and Energy in this confession of Peter for the establishment of the
natural siliation of the Son of God, to advance the reputation of these words
and the force of the Argument, gave themselves lience to expound these words to
the present advantage, and to make the confession of Peter to be the foundation
of the Church, that if the Arrians should encounter this Authority, they might
with more prejudice to their persons declaime against their cause by saying
they overthrew the foundation of the Church. Besides that this answer does much
dishonor the reputation of the Fathers integrity, and makes their
interpretations less credible as being made not of knowledge or reason but of
necessity and to serve a present turn, it is also false: For Epist. ad
Philadelph. In c. 16. Mat. tract. 1.
Ignatius expounds it in a spiritual sense, which also the Liturgy attibuted
to S. James calls (...): And Origin expounds it mystically to a third purpose,
but exclusively to this: And all these were before the Arrian Controversy. But
if it be lawful to make such unproved observations, it would have been to
better purpose, and more reason to have observed it thus: The Fathers so long
as the Bishop of Rome kept himself to the limits prescribed him by Christ, and
indulged to him by the Constitution or concession of the Church, were unwary
and apt to expound this place of the person of Peter; but when the Church began
to enlarge her phylacteries by the favor of Princes, and the Sunshine of a
prosperous fortune, and the Pope by the advantage of the Imperial Seat, and
other accidents began to invade upon the other Bishops and Patriarchs, then
that he might have no color from Scripture for such new pretensions, they did
most generally turn the stream of their expositions from the person to the
confession of Peter, and declared that to be the foundation of the Church. And
thus I have required fancy with fancy; but for the maine point, that these two
Expositions are inclusiue of each other, I find no warrant; for though they may
consist together well enough, if Christ had so intended them; yet unless it
could be shown by some circumstance of the Text, or some other extrinsecall
Argument that they must be so, and that both senses were actually intended. it
is but gratis dictum and a begging of the Question, to say that they are so,
and the fancy so new, that when S. Austin had expounded this place of the
person of Peter, he reviewes it again, and in his Retractations leaves every
man to his liberty, which to take; as having nothing certain in this Article:
which had been altogether needless if he had believed them to be inclusively
in each other, neither of them had need to have been retracted, both were
alike true, both of them might have been believed: But I said the fancy was
new, and I had reason; for it was so unknown till yesterday, that even the late
Writers of his own side, expound the words of the confession of S. Peter
exclusively to his person or any thing else, as is to be seen in Desens. pacis
part. 2. c. 28.
Marsilius, Recommend. sacr. Script.
Petrus de Aliaco and the gloss upon Did. 19. can. ita Dominus, ut supra,
which also was the Interpretation of Phavorinus Camers their own Bishop, from
whom they learnt the resemblance of the word (...) and (...), of which they
have made so many gay discourses, (...).

5. But upon condition I may have leave at another time to Numb. 7.
recede from so great and numerous Testimony of Fathers, I am willing to
believe that it was not the confession of S. Peter, but his person upon which
Christ said he would build his Church, or that these Expositions are consistent
with and consequent to each other that this confession was the objective
foundation of Faith, and Christ and his Apostles the subjective, Christ
principally, and S. Peter instrumentally; and yet I understand not any
advantage will hence accrue to the Sea of Rome: For upon S Peter it was built,
but not alone, for it was upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; and when S. Paul reckoned
the Economy of Hierarchy, he reckons not Peter first, and then the Apostles.
But first Apostles secondarily Prophets, etc. And whatsoever is first, either
is before all things else, or at least nothing is before it: So that at least
S. Peter is not before all the rest of the Apostles, which also S. Paul
expressly averres, I am in nothing inferior to the very chiefest of the
Apostles, no not in the very being a Rock and a foundation; and it was of the
Church of Ephesus, that S. Paul said in particular it was columna and
firmamentum veritatis, that Church was, not excluding others, for they also
were as much as she; for so we keep close and be united to the corner stone,
although some be master builders, Vid. Socrat. l. 1. c. 19. 20. Sozom. l. 2. c
14. Niceph. l. 14. c. 40.
yet all may build, and we have known whole Nations converted by Laymen and
women, who have been builders so far as to bring them to the corner stone.

6. But suppose all these things concern S. Peter in all the Numb. 8.
capacities can be with any color pretended, yet what have the Bishops of Rome
to do with this? For how will it appear that these promises and Commissions
did relate to him as a particular Bishop, and not as a public Apostle? Since
this later is so much the more likely, because the great pretense of all seems
in reason more proportionable to the founding of a Church, then its
continuance: And yet if they did relate to him as a particular Bishop (which
yet is a further degree of improbability, removed further from certainty) yet
why shall S. Clement or Linus rather succeed in this great office of headship
then S. John or any of the Apostles that survived Peter: It is no way likely a
private person should skip over the head of an Apostle; or why shall his
Successors at Rome more enjoy the benefit of it then his Successors at Antioch,
since that he was at Antioch and preached there, we have a Divine Authority,
but that he did so at Rome at most we have but a humane; and if it be replied
that because he dyed at Rome, it was Argument enough that there his Successors
were to inherit his privilege, this besides that at most it is but one little
degree of probability, and so not of strength sufficient to support an Article
of faith: it makes that the great Divine Right of Rome, and the Apostolical
presidency was so contingent and fallible as to depend upon the decree of Nero;
and if he had sent him to Antioch there to have suffered Martyrdom, the
Bishops of that Town had been heads of the Catholic Church. And this thing
presses the harder, because it is held by no mean persons in the Church of
Rome, that the Bishopric of Rome and the Papacy are things separable: And the
Pope may quit that Sea and sit in another, which to my understanding is an
Argument, that he that succeeded Peter at Antioch, is as much supreme by Divine
Right as he that sits at Rome; both alike, that is, Vid. Cameracens. Qu. vel^
est.
neither by Divine Ordinance: For if the Roman Bishops by Christ's intention
were to be Head of the Church, then by the same intention, the Succession must
be continued in that Sea, and then let the Pope go whether he will, the Bishop
of Rome must be the Head, which they themselves deny, and the Pope himself did
not believe, when in a schism he sat at Avignon; and that it was to be
continued in the Sea of Rome, it is but offered to us upon conjecture, upon an
act providence, as they fancy it, so ordering it by vision, and this proved by
an Author which themselves call fabulous and Apocryphal, under the name of
Linus, in Biblioth. PP. de passione Petri and Pauli: A goodly building which
relies upon an event that was accidental, whose purpose was but infinuated,
the meaning of it but conjectured at, and this conjecture so uncertain, that it
was an imperfect aim at the purpose of an event, which whether it was true or
no, was so uncertain, that it is ten to one there was no such matter. And yet
again another degree of uncertainty is, to whom the Bishops of Rome do
succeed: For S. Paul was as much Bishop of Rome, as S. Peter was; there he
presided, there he preached, and he it was that was the Doctor of the
Uncircumcision and of the Gentiles, S. Peter of the Circumcision, and of the
Jews only; and therefore the converted Jews at Rome, might with better reason
claim the privilege of S. Peter, then the Romans and the Churches in her
Communion, who do not derive from Jewish Parents.

7. If the words were never so appropriate to Peter, or also Numb. 9.
communicated to his Successors, yet of what value will the consequent be? what
prerogative is entailed upon the Chair of Rome? For that S. Peter was the
Ministerial Head of the Church, is the most that is desired to be proved by
those and all other words brought for the same purposes, and interests of that
Sea: Now let the Ministerall Head have what Dignity can be imagined, let him be
the first (and in all Communities that are regular, and orderly there must be
something that is first, upon certain occasions where an equal power cannot be
exercised, and made pompous or ceremonial:) But will this Ministerial
Headship infer an infallibility? will it infer more then the Headship of
the Jewish Synagogue, where clearly the High Priest was supreme in many senses,
yet in no sense infallible? will it infer more to us, then it did amongst the
Apostles? amongst whom if for orders sake, S. Peter was the first, yet he had
no compulsory power over the Apostles; there was no such thing spoke of, nor
any such thing put in practice. And that the other Apostles were by a personal
privilege as infallible as himself, is no reason to hinder the exercise of
jurisdiction or any compulsory power over them; for though in Faith they were
infallible, yet in manners and matter of fact as likely to err as S. Peter
himself was, and certainly there might have something happened in the whole
College, that might have been a Record of his Authority, by transmitting an
example of the exercise of some Judicial power over some one of them: If he
had but withstood any of them to their faces as S. Paul did him, it had been
more then yet is said in his behalf. Will the Ministerial Headship infer
any more then when the Church in a Community or a public capacity, should do
any Act of Ministry Ecelesiasticall, he shall be first in Order? Suppose this
to be a dignity to preside in Councels, which yet was not always granted him;
Suppose it to be a power of taking cognizance of the Major Causes of Bishops
when Councels cannot be called; Suppose it a double voice or the last decisive,
or the negative in the causes exterior; Suppose it to be what you will of
dignity or external regiment, which when all Churches were united in
Communion, and neither the interest of States, nor the engagement of opinions
had made disunion, might better have been acted then now it can; yet this will
fall infinitely short of a power to determine Controversies infallibly, and to
prescribe to all men's faith and consciences. A Ministerial Headship or the
prime Minister cannot in any capacity become the foundation of the Church to
any such purpose. And therefore men are causlessely amused with such premises,
and are afraid of such Conclusions which will never follow from the admission
of any sense of these words that can with any probability be pretended.

8. I consider that these Arguments from Scripture, are too weak to support
such an Authority which pretends to give Numb. 10.
Oracles, and to answer infallibly in Questions of Faith, because there is
greater reason to believe the Popes of Rome have erred, and greater certainty
of demonstration, then these places can be that they are infallible, as will
appear by the instances and perpetual experiment of their being deceived, of
which there is no Question, but of the sense of these places there is: And
indeed, if I had as clear Scripture for their infallibility, as I have against
their half Communion, against their Service in an unknown tongue, worshipping
of Images, and diverse other Articles, I would make no scruple of believing, but
limit and conform my understanding to all their Dictates, and believe it
reasonable all Prophesying should be restrained: But till then, I have leave to
discourse, and to use my reason; And to my reason, it seems not likely that
neither Christ nor any of his Apostles, S. Peter himself, not S. Paul writing
to the Church of Rome, should speak the least word or tittle of the
infallibility of their Bishops, for it was certainly as convenient to tell us
of a remedy, as to foretell that certainly there must needs be heresies, and
need of a remedy. And it had been a certain determination of the Question, if
when so rare an opportunity was ministered in the Question about Circumcision
that they should have sent to Peter, who for his infallibility in ordinary, and
his power of Headship would not only with reason enough as being infallibly
assisted, but also for his Authority have best determined the Question, if at
least the first Christians had known so profitable and so excellent a secret;
and although we have but little Record, that the first Council at Jerusalem
did much observe the solennities of Law, and the forms of Conciliary
proceedings, and the Ceremonials; yet so much of it as is recorded, is against
them, S. James and not S. Peter gave the final sentence, and although S. Peter
determined the Question pro liberate, yet S. James made the Decree, and the
Assumentum too, and gave sentence they should abstain from some things there
mentioned, which by way of temper he judged most expedient: And so it passed.
And S. Peter showed no sign of a Superior Authority, nothing of S. Chrysostom.
hom. 3. in. act. Apost.
Superior jurisdiction, (...).

So that if this Question be to be determined by Scripture, it Numb. 11.
must either be ended by plain places or by obscure; plain places there are
none, and these that are with greatest fancy pretended, are expounded by
Antiquity to contrary purposes. But if obscure places be all the (...), by what
means shall we infallibly find the sense of them? The Popes interpretation
though in all other cases it might be pretended, in this cannot; for it is the
thing in Question, and therefore cannot determine for it self; either
therefore we have also another infallible guide besides the Pope, and so we
have two Foundations and two Heads (for this as well as the other upon the same
reason) or else (which is indeed the truth) there is no infallible way to be
infallibly assured that the Pope is infallible. Now it being against the common
condition of men, above the pretenses of all other Governors Ecclesiastical,
against the Analogy of Scripture, and the deportment of the other Apostles,
against the Economy of the Church, and S. Peter's own entertainment, the
presumption lies against him, and these places, are to be left to their prime
intentions and not put upon the rack, to force them to confess what they never
thought.

But now for Antiquity, if that be deposed in this Question, there are so many
circumstances to be considered to reconcile Numb. 12.
their words and their actions, that the process is more troublesome, then the
Argument can be concluding, or the matter considerable: But I shall a little
consider it, so far at least as to show either Antiquity said no such thing
as is pretended, or if they did, it is but little considerable, because they
did not believe themselves; their practice was the greatest evidence in the
world against the pretense of their words. But I am much cased of a long
disquisition in this particular (for I love not to prove a Question by
Arguments whose Authority is in it self as fallible, and by circumstances made
as uncertain as the Question) by the saying of Aeneas Sylvius, that before the
Nicene Council every men lived to himself, and small respect was had to the
Church of Rome, which practice could not well consist with the Doctrine of
their Bishops infallibility, and by consequence supreme judgment and last
resolution in matters of Faith; but especially by the insinuation and
consequent De Romans Pont. l, 4. c. 2. secunda sententia.
acknowledgement of Bellarmine, that for 1000 years together the Fathers knew
not of the Doctrine of the Popes infallibility, for Nilus, Gerson, Alemain, the
Divines of Paris, Alphonsus de Castro, and Pope Adrian VI, persons who lived
1400 after Christ, affirm, that infallibility is not seated in the Popes
person, that he may err and sometimes actually has, which is a clear
demonstration that the Church knew no such Doctrine as this; there had been no
Decree nor Tradition, nor general opinion of the Fathers, or of any age before
them; and therefore this opinion which Bellarmine would feign blast if he
could, yet in his Conclusion he says it is not proprie haeretica. A device,
and an expression of his own without sense or precedent. But if the Fathers had
spoken of it and believed it, why may not a disagreeing person as well reject
their Authority when it is in behalf of Rome, as they of Rome without scruple
cast them off when they speak against it? For as Bellarmine being pressed with
the Authority of Nilus Bishop of Thessalonica and other Fathers, he says that
the Pope acknowledges no Fathers but they are all his children, and therefore
they cannot depose against him; and if that be true, why shall we take their
Testimonies for him? for if Sons depose in their Fathers behalf, it is
twenty to one, but the adverse party will be cast, and therefore at the best it
is but suspectum Testimonium. But indeed this discourse signifies nothing, but
a perpetual uncertainty in such topics, and that where a violent prejudice,
or a concerning interest is engaged, men by not regarding what any man says,
proclaim to all the world that nothing is certain, but Divine Authority.

But I will not take advantage of what Bellarmine says, nor what Stapleton, or
any one of them all say, for that will be Numb. 13.
but to press upon personal persuasions, or to urge a general Question with
a particular defaillance, and the Question is never the nearer to an end; for
if Bellarmine says any thing that is not to another man's purpose or
persuasion, that man will be tried by his own Argument, not by another: And so
would every man do that loves his liberty, as all wise men do, and therefore
retain it by open violence, or private evasions: But to return.

An Authority from Irenaeus in this Question, and on behalf of the Popes
infallibility, or the Authority of the Sea of Rome, Numb. 14.
or of the necessity of communicating with them is very fallible; for besides
that there are almost a dozen answers to the words of the Allegation, as is to
be seen in those that trouble themselves in this Question with the Allegation,
and answering such Authorities, yet if they should make for the affirmative of
this Question, it is protestatio contra factum. For Irenaeus had no such great
opinion of Pope Victors infallibity, that he believed things in the same degree
of necessity that the Pope did, for therefore he chides him for Excommunicating
the Asian Bishops (...) all at a blow in the Question concerning Easter day;
and in a Question of Faith he expressly disagreed from the doctrine of Rome; for
Irenaeus was of the Millenary opinion, and believed it to be a Tradition
Apostolical; now if the Church of Rome was of that opinion, then why is she
not now? where is the succession of her doctrine? But if she was not of that
opinion then, and Irenaeus was, where was his belief of that Churches
infallibility? The same I urge concerning S. Cyprian who was the head of a Sect
in opposition to the Church of Rome, in the Question of rebaptization, and he
and the abettors, Firmilian and the other Bishops of Cappadocia, and the
voisinage spoke harsh words of Stephen, and such as become them not to speak to
an infallible Doctor, and the supreme Head of the Church. I will urge none of
them to the disadvantage of that Sea, but only note the Satyrs of Firmilian
against him, because it is of good use, to show that it is possible for them in
their ill carriage to blast the reputation and efficacy of a great Authority:
For he says that that Church did pretend the Authority of the Apostles, cum in
multis sacramentis divinae rei, a Epist. Firmiliani contr. Steph. ad Cyprian.
Vid. etiam Ep. Cypriani ad Pompeium.
principio discrepet, and ab Ecclesia Hierosolymitana, and defamet Petrum and
Paulum tanquam authors. And a little after just dedignor (says he) apertam
and manifestam stultitiam Stephani, per quam veritas Christianae petrae
aboletur, which words say plainly that for all the goodly pretense of
Apostolical Authority, the Church of Rome did then in many things of Religion
disagree from Divine Institution (and from the Church of Jerusalem, which they
had as great esteem of for Religion sake, as of Rome for its principality) and
that still in pretending to S. Peter and S. Paul they dishonored those blessed
Apostles, and destroyed the honor of their pretense by their untoward
prevarication; which words I confess pass my skill to reconcile them to an
opinion of infallibility; and although they were spoken by an angry person, yet
they declare that in Africa they were not then persuaded, as now they were at
Rome: Nam Cyprian Epist, ad Quintum. (...).
nec Petrus quem primum Dominus clegit vendicavit sibi aliquid insolenter aut
arroganter assumpsit, ut diceret se primatum tenere: That was their belief
then, and how the contrary has grown up to that height where now it is all the
world is witness: And now I shall not need to note concerning S. Hierome, that
he gave a complement to Damasus, that he would not have given to Liberius, Qui
tecum non colligit spargit. For it might be true enough of Damasus who was a
good Bishop and a right believer; but if Liberius's name had been put instead
of Damasus, the case had been altered with the name; for S. Hierom did believe
and write it so, that Liberius had subscribed to Arrianism. And if either he or
any of the rest had believed the De Script, Eccles. in Fortunatiano.
Pope could not be a Heretic nor his Faith fail, but be so good and of so
competent Authority as to be a Rule to Christendom; Why did they not appeal
to the Pope in the Arrian Controversy? why was the Bishop of Rome made a Party
and a concurrent as other good Bishops were, and not a Judge and an Arbitrator
in the Question? Why did the Fathers prescribe so many Rules and cautions and
provisoes for the discovery of heresy? Why were the Emperors at so much
charge, and the Church at so much trouble as to call and convene in Councels
respectively, to dispute so frequently, to write so: sedulously, to observe all
advantages against their Adversaries, and for the truth, and never offered to
call for the Pope to determine the Question in his Chair? Certaindly no way
coud have been so expedite, none so concluding and peremptory, none could have
convinced so certainly, none could have triumphed so openly over all
discrepants as this, if they had known of any such thing as his being
infallible, or that he had been appointed by Christ to be the Judge of
Controversies. And therefore I will not trouble this discourse to excuse any
more words either pretended or really said to this purpose of the Pope, for
they would but make books swell and the Question endless, I shall only to this
purpose observe that the Old Writers were so far from believing the
infallibility of the Roman Church or Bishop, that many Bishops and many
Churches did actually live and continue out of the Roman Communion;
particularly Vbi illa Augustini and reliquorum prudentia? quis jam ferat

S. Austin, who with 217 Bishops and their Successors for 100 years together
stood separate from that Church, if we may believe their own Records: So did
Ignatius of Constantinople, S. Chrysostom, S. Cyprian, Firmilian, those
Bishops of Asia that separated in the Question of Easter, and those of Africa
in the Question of rebaptization: But besides this, most of them had opinions
which the Church of Rome disavowes now, and therefore did so then, or else she
has innovated in her Doctrine, which though it be most true and notorious, I
am sure she will never confess. But no excuse can be made for S. Austins
disagreeing, and contesting in the Question of appeals to Rome, the necessity
of Communicating Infants, the absolute damnation of Infants to the pains of
Hell, if they die before Baptism, and diverse other particulars. It was a famous
act of the Bishops of Liguria and Istria who seeing the Pope of Rome consenting
to the fifth Synod in disparagement of the famous Council of Chalcedon, which
for their own interests they did not like of, they renounced subjection to his
Patriarchate, and erected a Patriarch at Aquileia who was afterward translated
to Venice, where his name remains to this day. It is also notorious that most
of the Fathers were of opinion that the souls of the faithful did not enjoy
the beatifick Vision before Doomesday; whether Rome was then of that opinion or
no, I know not, I am sure now they are not; witness the Councels of Florence
and Trent; but of this I shall give a more full account afterward. But if to
all this which is already noted, we add that great variety of opinions amongst
the Fathers and Councels in assignation of the Canon, they not consulting with
the Bishop of Rome, nor any of them thinking themselves bound to follow his
Rule in enumeration of the books of Scripture, I think no more need to be said
as to this particular.

8. But now if after all this, there be some Popes which were notorious
Heretics, and Preachers of false Doctrine, some that Numb. 15.
made impious Decrees both in faith and manners; some that have determined
Questions with egregious ignorance and stupidity, some with apparent Sophistry,
and many to serve their own ends most openly, I suppose then the infallibility
will disband, and we may do to him as to other good Bishops, believe him when
there is cause; but if there be none, then to use our Consciences, Non enim
salvat Christianum quod Pontifex Tract. de interdict. Compos. a Theol. Venet.
prop. 13.
constanter affirmat praeceptum suum esse justum, sed oportet illud examinari,
and se juxta regulam superius datum dirigere: I would not instance and repeat
the errors of dead Bishops, if the extreme boldness of the pretense did not
make it necessary: But if we may believe Tertullian, Pope Zepherinus approved
the Lib. adver. Praxeam.
Prophecies of Montanus, and upon that approbation granted peace to the
Churches of Asia and Phrygia, till Praxeas persuaded him to revoke his act: But
let this rest upon the credit of Tertullian, whether Zepherinus were a
Montanist or no; some such thing there was for certain. Pope Vigilius denied
Vid. Liberal. in breviatio, cap. 22. Durand. 4. did. 7. q. 4.
two natures in Christ, and in his Epistle to Theodora the Empress
anathematized all them that said he had two natures in one person; S. Gregory
himself permitted Priests to give confirmation, which is all one as if he
should permit Deacons to consecrate, they being by Divine Ordinance annexed to
the higher orders; and upon this very ground Adrianus affirms that the Pope may
err in definiendis dogmatibus fidei. And that we may not fear we shall want
instances, we may to secure it Quae. de confirm. art. ult.
take their own confession, Nam multae sunt decretales haereticae says Occham
as he is cited by Almain, and firmiter hoc credo 3. did. 24. q. unica.
(says he for his own particular) sed non licet dogmatizare oppositum quoniam
sunt determinatae. So that we may as well see that it is certain that Popes may
be Heretics, as that it is dangerous to say so; and therefore there are so few
that teach it: All the Patriarchs and the Bishop of Rome himself subscribed to
Arrianism (as Baronius confesses;) and Did. 19. c. 9. L. 4. Ep. 2.
Gratian affirms that Pope Anastasius the Second was stricken of God for
communicating A. D. 357. n. 44.
with the Heretic Photinus. I know it will be made light of that Gregory the
Seventh says, the very exorcists of the Roman Church are Superior to Princes.
But what shall we think of that decretall of Gregory the Third, who wrore to
Bonaface his Legate in Germany, quod illi quorum uxores infirmitate aliqua
morbidae debitum reddere noluerunt, aliis poterant Vid. C^iranz. Sum. Council.

nubere? was this a Doctrine fit for the Head of the Church, an infallible
Doctor? it was plainly, if any thing ever was doctrina Daemoniorum, and is
noted for such by Gratian, cause. 32. q. 7. can. quod proposuisli. Where the
gloss also intimates that the same privilege was granted to the Englishmen by
Gregory, quia novi erant in fide. And sometimes we had little reason to expect
much better; for, not to instance in that learned discourse in the * Canon Law
de majoritate and obedientia, where the Popes Supremacy over Kings is proved
from the first chapter of Genesis, and the Pope is the Sun, and the Cap per
venerabitem. qui filii sint legitimi.
Emperor is the Moon, for that was the fancy of one Pope perhaps; though made
authentic and doctrinall by him; it was (if it be possible) more ridiculous,
that Pope Innocent the Third urges that the Mosaicall Law was still to be
observed, and that upon this Argument, Sane, says he, cum Deuteronomium
secunda lex interpretetur ex vi vocabuli comprobatur ut quod ibi decernitur in
Testamento novo debeat observari: Worse yet; for when there was a corruption
crept into the Decree called Sancta Romana, where instead of these words
Sedulii opus Did. 15. ^pud Gratian.
heroicis versibus descriptum, all the old Copies till of late read haereticis
versibus descriptum; this very mistake made many wise men, (as Pierius says)
yea Pope Adrian the Sixth, no De Sacord. b^^b.
worse man, believe that all Poetry was heretical, because (forsooth) Pope
Gelasius whose Decree that was, although he believed Sedulius to be a good
Catholic, yet as they thought, he concluded his Verses to be heretical: But
these were ignorances; it has been worse amongst some others, whose errors
have been more malicious. Pope Honorius was condemned by the sixth General
Synod, and his Epistles burnt, and in the seventh action of the eigth Synod,
the Acts of the Roman Council under Adrian the Second are recited, in which
it is said that Honorius was justly Anathematized, because he was convict of
heresy. Bellarmine says it is probable that Pope Adrian and the Roman Council
were deceived with false Copies of the sixth Synod, and that Honorius was no
Heretic. To this I say, that although the Roman Synod and the eighth general
Synod, and Pope Adrian, altogether are better witnesses for the thing then
Bellarmines conjecture is against it, yet if we allow his conjecture we shall
lose nothing in the whole, for either the Pope is no infallible Doctor, but may
be a Heretic as Honorius was, or else a Council is to us no infallible
determiner; I say, as to us, for if Adrian and the whole Roman Council and the
eighth General were all cozened with false Copies of the sixth Synod, which
was so little a while before them, and whose acts were transacted and kept in
the Theater and Records of the Catholic Church; he is a bold man that will be
confident that he has true Copies now. So that let which they please stand or
fall, let the Pope be a Heretic or the Councels be deceived and palpably
abused, (for the other, we will dispute it upon other instances and arguments
when we shall know which part they will choose) in the mean time we shall get
in the general what we loose in the particular. This only, this device of
saying the Copies of the Councels were false, was the stratagem of Albertus
Pighius 900 years after the thing was Vid. diatrib. de act. 6. and 7ae. Synod.
praefatione ad Lectorem and Dominicum Bannes 22ae. q. 1. a. 10. dub. 2.
done, of which invention Pighius was presently admonished, blamed, and wished
to recant. Pope Nicholas explicated the Mystery of the Sacrament with so much
ignorance and zeal that in condemning Berengarius he taught a worse impiety.
But what need I any more instances; it is a confessed case by Baronius, by
Biel, by Stella, Almain, Occham, and Canus, and generally by the best Scholars
in the Church of Rome, that a Pope Picus Mirand. in exposit. theorem. 4.
may be a Heretic, and that some of them actually were so, and no less then
three general Councels did believe the same thing: viz. sixth, seventh, and
eighth, as Bellarmine is pleased to acknowledge in his fourth book de Pontifice
Romano. c. 11. resp. ad Arg. 4. And the Canon si Papadist. 40. affirms it in
express terms, that a Pope is judicable and punishable in that case. But
there is no wound but some Emperick or other will pretend to cure it, and there
is a cure for this too. For though it be true that if a Pope were a Heretic,
the Church might depose him, yet no Pope can be a Heretic, not but that the
man may, but the Pope cannot, for he is ipso facto no Pope, for he is no
Christian; so Bellarmine: and so when you think you have L. 2. c. 30. ubi
supra.. est ergo.
him fast, he is gone, and nothing of the Pope left; but who sees not the
extreme folly of this evasion? For besides that out of fear and caution he
grants more then he needs, more then was sought for in the Question, the Pope
has no more privilege then the Abbot of Cluny, for he cannot be a Heretic,
nor be deposed by a Council, for if he be manifestly a Heretic he is ipso
facto no Abbot, for he is no Christian; and if the Pope be a Heretic
privaetely and occultly, for that, he may be accused and judged said the Gloss
upon the Canon si Papa did. 40. And the Abbot of Cluny and one of his meanest
Monks can be no more, therefore the case is all one. But Vide Alphons. a Castr.
l b. 1. adv. haeres. c. 4. hoc lemma ridentem affabre.
this is fitter to make sport with then to interrupt a serious discourse. And
therefore although the Canon Sanctae Romana approves all the Decretals of
Popes, yet that very Decretall has not decreed it firm enough, but that they
are so warily received by them, that when they list they are pleased to dissent
from them; And it is evident in the Extravagant of Sixtus IV. Com. De
reliquiis; who appointed a Vid. etiam Innocentium Sermon. 2. de conserat. Pontif.

Feast of the immaculate conception, a special Office for the day, and
Indulgences enough to the observers of it: And yet the Dominicans were so far
from believing the Pope to be infallible and his Decree authentic, that they
declaimed against it in their Pulpits so furiously and so long till they were
prohibited under pain of Excommunication, to say the Virgin Mary was conceived
in Original sin; Now what sollennity can be more required for the Pope to make
a Cathedral determination of an Article? The Article was so concluded, that a
Feast was instituted for its celebration, and pain of Excommunication threatened
to them which should preach the contrary; Nothing more solemn, nothing more
confident and severe: And yet after all this, to show that whatsoever those
people would have us to believe, they will believe what they list themselves:
This thing was not determined de fide says Victorellus; Nay, the Author of the
Gloss of the Canon Law has these express words, De festo Conceptionis nihil
dicitur quiae celebrandum non est, sicut in multis De Angelo custod. fol. 59.
de consecrat. did. 3. can. pronunciand. gloss. verb. Nativit.
regionibus fit, and maxim in Anglia, and haec est ratio, quia in peccatis
concepta fuit sicut and caeteri Sancti. And the Commissaries, of Sixtus V. and
Gregory XIII. did not expunge these words, but left them upon Record, not only
against a received and more approved opinion of the Jesuits and Franciscans,
but also in plain defiance of a Decree made by their visible head of the
Church, who (if ever any thing was decreed by a Pope, with an intent to oblige
all Christendom) decreed Hac in perpetuum valitura constitutione statuimus,
etc. De reliquiis, etc. Extrav. Com. Sixth. 4, cap. 1.
this to that purpose.

So that without taking particular notice of it, that egregious sophistry and
flattery of the late Writers of the Roman Church is in this instance, besides
diverse others before mentioned, clearly made invalid. For here the Bishop of
Rome not as Numb. 16.
a private Doctor, but as Pope, not by declaring his own opinion, but with an
intent to oblige the Church, gave sentence in a Question which the Dominicans
will still account pro non determinata. And every decretall recorded in the
Canon Law if it be false in the matter, is just such another instance: And
Alphonsus a Castro says it to the same purpose, in the instance of Celestine
dissolving Marriages for heresy, Neque Caelestini error talis fuit qui soli
negligentiae imputari debeat, ita ut illum errasse dicamus velut privatam
personam and non ut Papam, quoniam hujusmodi Caelestini definitio habetur in
antiquis decretalibus in cap. Laudabilem, titulo de conversione infidelium;
quam ego ipse vidi and legi, lib. 1. adv. haeres. cap. 4. And therefore it is a
most intolerable folly to pretend that the Pope cannot err in his Chair,
though he may err in his Closet, and may maintain a false opinion even to his
death: For besides that, it is sottish to think that either he would not have
the world of his own opinion (as all men naturally would) or that if he were
set in his Chair, he would determine contrary to himself in his study (and
therefore to represent it as possible, they are feign to fly to a Miracle for
which they have no color, neither instructions, nor insinuation, nor warrant,
nor promise; besides that, it were impious and unreasonable to depose him for
heresy, who may so easily, even by setting himself in his Chair and reviewing
his Theorems, be cured:) it is also against a very great experience: For
besides the former Allegations it is most notorious, that Pope Alexander III in
a Council at Rome of 300 Archbishops and Bishops A. D. 1179. condemned Peter
Lombard of heresy in a matter of great concernment, no less then something
about the incarnation; from which sentence he was, after 36 years abiding it,
absolved by Pope Innocent III, without repentance or dereliction of the
opinion: Now if this sentence was not a Cathedral Dictate, as solemn and great
as could be expected, or as is said to be necessary to oblige all Christendom,
let the great Hyperaspists of the Roman Church be Judges, who tell us that a
particular Council with the Popes confirmation is made Oecumenicall by
adoption, and is infallible and obliges all Christendom; so Bellarmine: And
therefore he says, that it is temerarium, erroneum, and proximum haeresi, to
L. 2. de. Council. cap. 5.
deny it, but whether it be or not it is all one, as to my purpose: For it is
certain, that in a particular Council confirmed by the Pope, if ever; then and
there the Pope sat himself in his Chair, and it is as certain that he sat
besides the cushion and determined ridiculously and falsely in this case: But
this is a device De Pontif. Romans c. 14. respondeo. In 3. sent. d. 24. q. in
conl. 6. dub. 6. in fine.
for which there is no Scripture, no Tradition, no one dogmaticall resolute
saying of any Father, Greek or Latin, for above 1000 years after Christ: And
themselves when they list can acknowledge as much. And therefore Bellarmine's
saying, I perceive is believed by them to be true: That there are many things
in the Proverbialiter olim dictu^ erat, de Decretalibus. Male cum rebus humanis
actum esse, ex quo decretis alae accesserunt. scil. cum Decretales post
decretum Gratiani sub nomine Gregorii noni edebantur.
Decretall Epistles, which make not Articles to be de fide. And therefore, Non
est necessario credendum determinatis per summum Pontific^m, says Almain: And
this serves their turns in every thing they do not like, and therefore I am
resolved it shall serve my turn also for some thing, and that is, that the
matter of the Pope's infallibility is so ridiculous and improbable, that they
do not believe it themselves: Some of them clearly practiced the contrary, and
although Pope Leo X has determined the Pope to be above a Council, yet the
Sorbon to this day scorn it at the very heart. And I might urge upon them that
scorn that Almain truly enough by way of Argument alleges. It is a wonder that
they who affirm the Pope cannot De Authorit. Eccles. cap, 10. in fine.
err in judgment, do not also affirm that he cannot sin: they are like
enough to say so says he, if the vicious lives of the Popes did not make a
daily confutation of such flattery: Now for my own particular, I am as
confident and think it as certain, that Popes are actually deceived in matters
of Christian Doctrine, as that they do prevaricate the laws of Christian
piety: And therefore L. 1. ca. 4. advers. haeres. edit. Paris 1534. In seqq.
non expurgantur ista verba. at idem sensus manner.
Alphonsus a Castro calls them impudentes Papae assentatores, that ascribe to
him infallibility in judgment or interpretation of Scripture.

But if themselves did believe it heartily, what excuse is there Numb. 11.
in the world, for the strange uncharitableness or supine negligence of the
Popes, that they do not set themselves in their Chair and write infallible
Commentaries, and determine all Controversies without error, and blast all
heresies with the word of their mouth, declare what is and what is not de fide,
that his Disciples and Confidents may agree upon it; reconcile the Franciscans
and Dominicans, and expound all Mysteries? for it cannot be imagined but he
that was endued with so supreme power in order to so great ends, was also
fitted with proportionable, that is, extraordinary personal abilities,
succeeding and derived upon the persons of all the Popes. And then the Doctors
of his Church, need not trouble themselves with study, nor writing explications
of Scripture, but might wholly attend to practical devotion, and leave all
their Scholasticall wranglings, the distinguishing opinions of their Orders,
and they might have a fine Church, something like Fairy land, or Lucians
Kingdom in the Moon: But if they say they cannot do this when they list, but
when they are moved to it by the Spirit, then we are never the nearer; for so
may the Bishop of Angolesme write infallible Commentaries when the holy Ghost
moves him to it, for I suppose his motions are not ineffectuall, but he will
sufficiently assist us in performing of what he actually moves us to: But among
so many hundred Decrees which the Popes of Rome have made or confirmed and
attested (which is all one) I would feign know in how many of them did the holy
Ghost assist them? If they know it, let them declare it, that it may be certain
which of their Decretals are de fide; for as yet none of his own Church knows:
If they do not know, then neither can we know it from them, and then we are as
uncertain as ever, and besides, the holy Ghost may possibly move him, and he
by his ignorance of it may neglect so profitable a motion, and then his promise
of infallible assistance will be to very little purpose, because it is with
very much fallibility applicable to practice: And therefore it is absolutely
useless to any man or any Church, because, suppose it settled in Thesi, that
the Pope is infallible, yet whether he will do his duty, and perform those
conditions of being assisted which are required of him, or whether he be a
secret Simoniack (for if he be, he is ipso facto, no Pope) or whether he be a
Bishop, or Priest, or a Christian, being all uncertain; every one of these
depending upon the intention and power of the Baptizer or Ordainer, which also
are fallible, because they depend upon the honesty and power of other men; we
cannot be infallibly certain of any Pope that he is infallible, and therefore
when our Questions are dermin'd, we are never the nearer, but may hug our
selves in an imaginary truth, the certainty of finding truth out depending upon
so many fallible and contingent circumstances. And therefore, the thing, if it
were true, being so to no purpose, it is to be presumed that God never gave a
power so impertinently, and from whence no benefit can accrue to the Christian
Church, for whose use and benefit, if at all, it must needs have been appointed.

But I am too long in this impertinency: If I were bound Numb. 18.
to call any man Master upon earth, and to believe him upon his own affirmative
and authority; I would of all men least follow him that pretends he is
infallible and cannot prove it. For that he cannot prove it, makes me as
uncertain as ever, and that he pretends to infallibility makes him careless
of using such means which will morally secure those wise persons, who knowing
their own aptness to be deceived, use what endeavors they can to secure
themselves from error, and so become the better and more probable guides.

Well! Thus far we are come: Although we are secured in fundamental points
from involuntary error, by the plain, Numb. 19.
express, and dogmaticall places of Scripture, yet in other things we are not
but may be invincibly mistaken, because of the obscurity and difficulty in the
controverted parts of Scripture, by reason of the incertainty of the means of
its Interpretation, since Tradition is of an uncertain reputation, and
sometimes evidently false, Councels are contradictory to each other, and
therefore certainly are equally deceived many of them, and therefore all may;
and then the Popes of Rome are very likely to mislead us, but cannot ascertain
us of truth in matter of Question; and in this world we believe in part, and
prophecy in part, and this imperfection shall never be done away till we be
translated to a more glorious state; either we must throw our chances, and get
truth by accident or predestination, or else we must lie safe in a mutual
toleration, and private liberty of persuasion, unless some other Anchor can
be thought upon where we may fasten our floating Vessels, and ride safely.

SECT. VIII.
Of the disability of Fathers, or Writers Ecclesiastical, to determine our
Questions, with certainty and Truth.

THere are some that think they can determine all Questions Numb. 1.
in the world by two or three sayings of the Fathers, or by the consent of so
many as they will please to call a concurrent Testimony: But this consideration
will soon be at an end; for if the Fathers, when they are witnesses of
Tradition do not always speak truth, as it happened in the case of Papias and
his numerous Followers for almost three Ages together, then is their Testimony
more improbable when they dispute or write Commentaries.

2. The Fathers of the first Ages spoke unitedly concerning Numb. 2.
diverse Questions of secret Theology, and yet were afterward contradicted by
one personage of great repution, whose credit had so much influence upon the
world, as to make the contrary opinion become popular; why then may not we have
the same liberty, when so plain an uncertainty is in their persuasions, and so
great contrariety in their Doctrines? But this is evident in the case of
absolute predestination, which till S. Austine's time no man preached, but all
taught the contrary, and yet the reputation of this one excellent man altered
the scene. But if he might dissent from so General a Doctrine, why may not we
do so too, it being pretended that he is so excellent a precedent to be
followed, if we have the same reason? he had no more Authority nor dispensation
to dissent, then any Bishop has now. And therefore S. Austin has dealt
ingeniously, and as he took this liberty to himself, so he denies it not to
others, but indeed forces them to preserve their own liberty: And Sess. ult.
therefore when S. Hierom had a great mind to follow the Fathers in a point
that he fancyed, and the best security he had, was, Patiaris me cum talibus
errare, S. Austin would not endure it, but answered his reason, and neglected
the Authority. And therefore it had been most unreasonable that we should do
that now, though in his behalf, which he toward greater personages (for so
they were then) at that time judged to be unreasonable. It is a plain
recession from Antiquity, which was determined by the Council of Florence,
piorum animas purgatas, etc. mox in Caelum recipi, and intueri clare ipsum Deum
trinum and unum sicuti est: As who please to try, may see it dogmatically
resolved to the contrary by Q. 60. ad Christian.

S. Bernard are known to be of opinion that the souls of the Saints are in
abditis receptaculis, and exterioribus atriis, where they expect the
resurrection of their bodies, and the glorification of their souls, and though
they all believe them to be happy, yet they enjoy not the beatifick Vision
before the resurrection: Now there being so full a consent of Fathers (for many
more may be added) and the Decree of Pope John XXII, besides, who was so
confident for his Decree that he commanded the University of Paris to swear
that they would preach it and no other, and that none should be promoted to
degrees in Theology, that did not swear the like, (as In oper. 90. dierum.

hope no man will be so unjust to press other men to consent to an Authority

enough, but if more were necessary I could instance in the opinion of the

S. Bernard besides some Writers of after Ages as Hugo de S. Victore, and the
Doctors generally his contemporaries. And it would not be inconsiderable to
observe, that if any Synod, General, National, or Provincial, be receded
from by the Church of the later Age, (as there have been very many) then, so
many Fathers as were then assembled and united in opinion are esteemed no
Authority to determine our persuasions. Now suppose 200 Fathers assembled in
such a Council, if all they had writ Books, and Authorities, 200 Authorities
had been alleged in confirmation of an opinion, it would have made a mighty
noise, and loaded any man with an insupportable prejudice that should dissent:
And yet every opinion maintained against the Authority of any one Council,
though but Provincial, is in its proportion such a violent recession and
neglect of the Authority and doctrine of so many Fathers as were then
assembled, who did as much declare their opinion in those Assemblies by their
Suffrages, as if they had writ it in so many books; and their opinion is more
considerable in the Assembly then in their writings, because it was more
deliberate, assisted, united and more dogmaticall. In pursuance of this
observation, it is to be noted by way of instance, that S. Austin and two
hundred and seventeene Bishops and all their Successors Vid. Epist. Bonifacii
11. apud Nicolinum, Tom. 2. Council. page 544. and exemplar precum Eulalii apud
eundem. ibid. p. 525. Qui anathematizat omnes decisores suos qui in in ea^

for a whole Age together did consent in denying appeals to Rome; and yet the
Authority of so many Fathers (all true Catholics) is of no force now at Rome
in this Question; but if it be in a matter they like, one of these Fathers
alone is sufficient. The Doctrine of S. Austin alone brought in the festival
and veneration of the assumption of the blessed Virgin, and the hard sentence
passed at Rome upon unbaptized Infants and the Dominican opinion concerning
predetermination, derived from him alone as from their Original: so that if a
Father speaks for them, it is wonderful to see what Tragedies are stirred up
against them that dissent, as is to be seen in that excellent nothing of
Campian's ten reasons. But if the Fathers be against them, then Patres in
quibusdam non leviter lapsi sunt says Berllarmine, and constat quosdam ex
praecipuis, it is certain the chiefest of them have foully erred. Nay, Posa,
Salmeron, De verb. Dei l. 3. c. 10.. dices.
and Wadding in the Question of the immaculate conception make no scruple to
dissent from Antiquity; to prefer new Doctors before the Old, and to justify
themselves, bring instances in which the Church of Rome had determined against
the Fathers. And it is not excuse enough to say that singly the Fathers may
err, but if they concur they are certain Testimony. For there is no question
this day disputed by persons that are willing to be tried by the Fathers, so
generally attested on either side, as some points are which both sides dislike
severally or conjunctly. And therefore it is not honest for either side to press
the Authority of the Fathers, as a concluding Argument in matter of dispute,
unless themselves will be content to submit in all things to the Testimony of
an equal number of them, which I am certain neither side will do.

3. If I should reckon all the particular reasons against the certainty of this
topic, it would be more then needs as to this Numb. 3.
Question, and therefore I will abstain from all disparagement of those worthy
Personages, who were excellent lights to their several Dioceses, and Cures.
And therefore I will not instance that Clemens Alexandrinus taught that Christ
felt no hunger or thirst, but eat only to make demonstration of the verity of
his Strom. l. 3. and 6.
humane nature: Nor that S. Hilary taught that Christ in his sufferings had no
sorrow; nor that Origin taught the pains of Hell not to have an eternal
duration: Nor that S. Cyprian taught rebaptization; nor that Athenagoras
condemned second marriages; nor that S. John Damascen said, Christ only prayed
in appearance, not really and in truth; I will let them all rest in peace, and
their memories in honor; for if I should enquire into the particular
probations of this Article, I must do to them as I should be forced to do
now; if any man should say that the Writings of the Schoolmen were excellent
Argument and Authority to determine men's persuasions; I must consider their
writings, and observe their defaillances, their contradictions, the weakness
of their Arguments, the mis-allegations of Scripture, their inconsequent
deductions, their false opinions, and all the weaknesses of humanity, and the
failings of their persons, which no good man is willing to do, unless he be
compelled to it by a pretense that they are infallible, or that they are
followed by men even into errors or impiety. And therefore since there is
enough in the former instances, to cure any such misperswasion and prejudice, I
will not instance in the innumerable particularities that might persuade us to
keep our Liberty entire or to use it discreetly. For it is not to be denied but
that great advantages are to be made by their writings, and probabile est quod
omnibus, quod pluribus, quod sapientibus videtur; If one wise man says a
thing, it is an Argument to me to believe it in its degree of probation, that
is, proportionable to such an assent as the Authority of a wise man can
produce, and when there is nothing against it that is greater; and so in
proportion higher and higher as more wise men (such as the old Doctors were)
do affirm it. But that which I complain of is that we look upon wise men that
lived long ago with so much veneration and mistake, that we reverence them not
for having been wise men, but that they lived long since. But when the Question
is concerning Authorty, there must be something to build it on; a Divine
Commandment, humane Sanction, excellency of spirit, and greatness of
understanding, on which things all humane Authority is regularly built. But now
if we had lived in their times (for so we must look upon them now, as they did
who without prejudice beheld them) I suppose we should then have beheld them,
as we in England look on those Prelates, who are of great reputation for
learning and sanctity; here only is the difference; when persons are living,
their authority is depressed by their personal defaillances, and the contrary
interests of their contemporaries, which disband when they are dead, and leave
their credit entire upon the reputation of those excellent books, and monuments
of learning and piety which are left behind: But beyond this why the Bishop of
Hippo shall have greater Authority then the Bishop of the Canaries, caeteris
paribus, I understand not. For did they that lived (to instance) in S.
Austine's time believe all that he wrote? If they did, they were much too
blame, or else himself was too blame for retracting much of it a little before
his death; And if while he lived, his affirmative was no more Authority, then
derives from the credit of one very wise man, against whom also very wise men
were opposed; I know not why his Authority should prevail further now; For
there is nothing added to the strength of his reason, since that time, but only
that he has been in great esteem with posterity: And if that be all, why the
opinion of the following Ages, shall be of more force then the opinion of the
first Ages, against whom S. Austin in many things clearly did oppose himself,
I see no reason; or whether the first Ages were against him or no, yet that he
is approved by the following Ages is no better Argument; for it makes his
Authority not to be innate, but derived from the opinion of others, and so to
be precaria, and to depend upon others, who if they should change their
opinions, and such examples there have been many, then there were nothing left
to urge our consent to him; which when it was at the best, was only this,
because he had the good Fortune to be believed by them that came after, he must
be so still; and because it was no Argument for the old Doctors before him,
this will not be very good in his behalf: The same I say of any company of
them, I say not so of all of them, it is to no purpose to say it, for there is
no Question this day in contestation, in the explication of which all the old
Writers did consent: In the assignation of the Canon of Scripture, they never
did consent for six hundred years together, and then by that time the Bishops
had agreed indiffently well, and but indifferently, upon that, they fell out in
twenty more; and except it be in the Apostels Creed, and Articles of such
nature, there is nothing which may with any color be called a consent, much
less Tradition Universal.

4. But I will rather choose to show the uncertainty of this Numb. 4.
Topic by such an Argument, which was not in the Fathers power to help, such
as makes no invasion upon their great reputation, which I desire should be
preserved as sacred as it ought. For other things, let who please read Mr
Daille du vray usage des Peers; But I shall only consider that the Writings of
the Fathers have been so corrupted by the intermixture of Heretics, so many
false books put forth in their names, so many of their Writings lost which
would more clearly have explicated their sense, and at last an open profession
made and a trade of making the Fathers speak, not what themselves thought, but
what other men pleased, that it is a great instance of God's providence and
care of his Church, that we have so much good preserved in the Writings which
we receive from the Fathers, and that all truth is not as clear gone, as is the
certainty of their great Authority and reputation.

The publishing books with the inscription of great names began in S. Paul's
time; for some had troubled the Church of Numb. 5.
Thessalonica with a false Epistle in S. Paul's name against the inconvenience
of which he arms them in 2 Thessalonians. 2. 1. And this increased daily in the Church.
The Arrians wrote an Epistle to Constantine, under the name of Athanasius, and
the Eutychians Apolog. Athanas. ad Constant.
wrote against Cyrill of Alexandria under the name of Theodoret; and of the Age
in which the seventh Synod was kept, Erasmus reports, Libris falso celebrium
virorum titulo commendatis Vid. Baron. A. D. 553.
scatere omnia. It was then a public business, and a trick not more base then
public: But it was more ancient then so, and it is memorable in the books
attributed to S. Basil, containing thirty Chapters de Spiritu Sancto, whereof
fifteen were plainly added by another hand under the covert of S. Basil, as
appears in the difference of the style, in the impertinent digressions, against
the custom of that excellent man, by some passages contradictory to others of
S. Basil, by citing Meletius as dead before him, who yet lived three Vid.
Baron, in Annal.
years after him, and by the very frame and manner of the discourse; and yet it
was so handsomely carried, and so well served the purposes of men, that it was
quoted under the title of S. Basil by many, but without naming the number of
chapters, and by S. John Damascen in these words, Basilius in opere triginta
capitum de Spiritu S. ad Amphilochium, and to the same purpose, and in the
number L^. de imagine. orat. 1.
of 27 and 29. chapters he is is cited by Nomocan. tit. 1. cap. 3.

for this see more in Erasmu's his Preface upon this book of S. Basil. There is

is of great use in the Question of Predestination, with its appendices, and yet
a very V. Beda. de gratia Christi adv. Iulianum.
learned man 800 years agone did believe it to be written by a Pelagian, and
undertakes to confute diverse parts of it, as being high and confident
Pelagianisme, and written by Julianus Episc. Eclanensis, but Gregorius
Ariminensis from S. Austin affirms it to have been written by Pelagius
himself. I might instance in too many; Greg. Arim. in 2. sent. did. 26. q. 1.
a. 3.
There is not any one of the Fathers who is esteemed Author of any considerable
number of books, that has escaped untouched; But the abuse in this kind has
been so evident that now if any interessed person of any side be pressed with
an Authority very pregnant against him, he thinks to escape by accusing the
Edition, or the Author, or the hands it passed through, or at last he therefore
suspects it, because it makes against him; both sides being resolved that they
are in the right, the Authorities that they admit, they will believe not to be
against them; and they which are too plainly against them, shall be no
Authorities: And indeed the whole world has been so much abused that every man
thinks he has reason to suspect whatsoever is against him, that is, what he
please; which prooceeding only produces this truth, that there neither is nor
can be any certainty, nor very much probability in such Allegations.

But there is a worse mischief then this, besides those very many which are
not yet discovered, which like the pestilence Numb. 6.
destroys in the dark, and grows into inconvenience more insensibly and more
irremediably, and that is, corruption of particular places, by inserting words
and altering them to contrary senses: A thing which the Fathers of the sixth
General Synod complained of concerning the constitutions of S. Clement, quibus
jam olim ab iis qui a side aliena sent iunt adulterina quaedam etiam pietate
aliena introducta sunt quae divinorum nobis Decretorum Can. 2.
elegantem and venustam speciem obscurarunt: And so also have his Recognitions,
so have his Epistles been used, if at least they were his at all, particularly
the fifth Decretall Epistle that goes under the name of S. Clement, in which
community of Wives is taught upon the Authority of S. Luke saying the first
Christians had all things common; if all things, then Wives also says the
Epistle; a forgery like to have been done by some Nicolaitan, or other impure
person: There is an Epistle of Cyrill extant to Successus Bishop of
Diocaesarea, in which he relates that he was asked by Budus Bishop of Emessa,
whether he did approve of the Epistle of Athanasius to Epictetus Bishop of
Corinth, and that his answer was, Si haec apud vos scripta non sint adultera:
Nam plura ex his ab hostibus Ecclesiae Eusebius. l. 4. c. 23.
deprehenduntur esse depravata: And this was done even while the Authors
themselves were alive; for so Dionysius of Corinth complan'd that his writings
were corrupted by Heretics, and Pope Leo, that his Epistle to Flavianus was
perverted by the Greeks: And in the Synod of Constantinople before quoted (the
Act. 8. vid. etiam. Synod 7. act. 4.
sixth Synod) Macarius and his Disciples were convicted quod Sanctorum
testimonia aut truncarint aut depravarint: Thus the third Chapter of S.
Cyprians book de unitate Ecclesiae in the Edition of Pamelius suffered great
alteration: These words [Primatus Petro datur] wholly inserted, and these
[super Cathedram Petri fundata est Ecclesia] and whereas it was before, super
unum aedificat Ecclesiam Christus, that not being enough they have made it
super [illum] unum. Now these Additions are against the faith of all old
Copies, before Minutius and Pamelius, and against Gratian, even after himself
had been chastised by the Roman Correctors, the Commissaries of Gregory XIII,
as is to be seen where these words are alleged, Decret. c. 24. Q. 1. can.
loquitur Dominus ad Petrum. So that we may say of Cyprians works as Pamelius
himself said concerning his writings and the writings of other of the Fathers,
unde colligimus (says he) Cypriani scripta ut and aliorum Veterum a librariis
vary fuisse Annot. Cyprian. super. Council. Carthage. n. 1.
interpolata. But Gratian himself could do as fine a feat when he listed, or
else some body did it for him, and it was in this very Question, their beloved
Article of the Popes Supremacy; for de paenit. did. 1. c. potest fieri. he
quotes these words out of S. Ambrose, Non habent Petri haereditatem qui non
habent Petri sedem; sidem, not sedem, it is in S. Ambrose; but this error was
made authentic by being inserted into the Code of the Law of the Catholic
Church; and considering how little notice the Clergy had of Antiquity, but what
was transmitted to them by Gratian, it will be no great wonder that all this
part of the world swallowed such a bole and the opinion that was wrapped in it.
But I need not instance in Gratian any further, but refer any one that
desires to be satisfied concerning this Collection of his, to Augustinus
Archbishop of Tarracon in emendatione Gratiani, where he shall find fopperies
and corruptions good store noted by that learned man: But that the Indices
Expurgatorii Vid. Ind. Expurg. Belg. in Bertram. and Flandr. Hispan. Portugal.

commanded by Authority, and practiced with public license profess to alter
and correct the sayings of the Fathers, and to reconcile them to the Catholic
sense by putting in and leaving out, is so great an Imposture, so unchristian a
proceeding, that it has made the faith of all books and all Authors justly to
be suspected; For considering their infinite diligence and great opportunity,
as having had most of the Copies in their own hands, together with an
unsatisfiable desire of prevailing in their right or in their wrong, they have
made an absolute destruction of this Topic, and when the Fathers speak Videat
Lector Andream Cristovium in Bello Iesuitico, and Ioh. Reinolds in hbr. de
idol. Romans
Latin, or breathe in a Roman Diocese, although the providence of God does
infinitely overruled them, and that it is next to a miracle that in the
Monuments of Antiquity, there is no more found that can pretend for their
advantage then there is, which indeed is infinitely inconsiderable: Yet our
Questions and uncertainties are infinitely multiply^ed in stead of a probable
and reasonable determination. For since the Latins always complained of the
Greeks for privately corrupting the Ancient Records both of Councels and Vid.
Ep. Nicolai ad Michael. Imperat.
Fathers, and now the Latins make open profession not of corrupting, but of
correcting their writings (that is the word) and at the most it was but a humane
authority, and that of persons not always learned, and very often deceived;
the whole matter is so unreasonable, that it is not worth a further
disquisition. But if any one desires to enquire further, he may be satisfied in
Erasmus, in Henry and Robert Stephens, in their Prefaces before the Editions of
Fathers, and their Observations upon them: in Bellarmine de script. Eccles. in
Dr. Reynolds, de libris Apocryphis, in Scaliger, and Robert Coke of Leedes in
Yorkshire, in his Book De censura Patrum.

SECT. IX.
Of the incompetency of the Church in its diffusive capacity to be judge of
Controversies, and the impertinency of that pretense of the Spirit.

ANd now after all these considerations of the several Topics, Numb. 1.
Tradition, Councels, Popes and ancient Doctors of the Church, I suppose it
will not be necessary, to consider the authority of the Church apart. For the
Church either speaks by Tradition, or by a representative body in a Council, by
Popes, or by the Fathers: for the Church is not a Chimaera, not a shadow, but a
company of men believing in Jesus Christ, which men either speak by themselves
immediately, or by their Rulers, or by their proxies and representatives; now I
have considered it in all senses but in its diffusive capacity; in which
capacity she cannot be supposed to be a Judge of Controversies, both because in
that capacity she cannot teach us, as also because if by a Judge we mean all
the Church diffused in all its parts and members, so there can be no
controversy, for if all men be of that opinion, then there is no question
contested; if they be not all of a mind, how can the whole diffusive Catholic
Church be pretended in defiance of any one article, where the diffusive Church
being divided, part goes this way, and part another? But if it be said, the
greatest part must carry it; Besides that it is impossible for us to know which
way the greatest part goes in many questions, it is not always true that the
greater part is the best, sometimes the contrary is most certain, and it is
often very probable, but it is always possible. And when paucity of followers
was objected to Liberius, he gave this in answer, There was a time when but
three Children of the Captivity Theod. l. 2. c. 16. hist.
resisted the Kings Decree. And Athanasius wrote on purpose against those that
did judge of truth by multitudes, and indeed Tom. 2.
it concerned him so to do, when he alone stood in the gap against the
numerous armies of the Arrians.

But if there could in this case be any distinct consideration of Numb. 2.
the Church, yet to know which is the true Church is so hard to be found out,
that the greatest questions of Christendom are judged before you can get to
your Judge, and then there is no need of him. For those questions which are
concerning the Judge of questions must be determined before you can submit to
his judgment, and if you can your selves determine those great questions which
consist much in universalities, then also you may determine the particulars as
being of less difficulty. And he that considers how many notes there are given
to know the true Church, no less then 15. by Bellarmine, and concerning every
one of them almost whether it be a certain note or no there are very many
questions and uncertainties, and when it is resolved which are the notes, there
is more dispute about the application of these notes then of the (...), will
quickly be satisfied that he had better sit still then to go round about a
difficult and troublesome passage, and at last get no further, but return to
the place from whence he first set out. And there is one note amongst the rest,
Holiness of Doctrine, that is, so as to have nothing false either in Doctrina
fidei or morum, (for so Bellarmine explicates it) which supposes all your
Controversies, judged before they can be tried by the authority of the Church,
and when we have found out all true Doctrine (for that is necessary to judge of
the Church by, that as Saint Austin's council is Ecclesiam in verbis Christi
investigemus) then we are bound to follow because we judge it true, not because
the Church has said it, and this is to judge of the Church by her Doctrine,
not of the Doctrine by the Church. And indeed it is the best and only way; But
then how to judge of that Doctrine will be afterward inquired into. In the
mean time, the Church, that is, the Governors of the Churches are to judge
for themselves, and for all those who cannot judge for themselves. For others,
they must know that their Governors judge for them too, so as to keep them in
peace and obedience, though not for the determination of their private
persuasions. For the Economy of the Church requires that her authority be
received by all her children. Now this authority is divine in its original,
for it derives immediately from Christ, but it is humane in its ministration.
We are to be lead like men not like beasts; A rule is prescribed for the guides
themselves to follow, as we are to follow the guides; and although in matters
indeterminable or ambiguous the presumption lies on behalf of the Governors,
(for we do nothing for authority if we suffer it not to weigh that part down of
an indifferency and a question which she chooses) yet if there be error
manifestus, as it often happens, or if the Church Governors themselves be rent
into innumerable sects, as it is this day in Christendom, then we are to be as
wise as we can in choosing our guides, and then to follow so long as that
reason remains for which we first chose them. And even in that Government which
was an immediate sanction of God, I mean the Ecclesiastical government of the
Synagogue, where God had consigned the Highpriests authority with a menace of
death to them that should disobey, that all the world might know the meaning
and extent of such precepts, and that there is a limit beyond which they cannot
command, and we ought not to obey: it came once to that pass, that if the
Priest had been obeyed in his Conciliary decrees, the whole Nation had been
bound to believe the condemnation of our blessed Savior to have been just, and
at another time the Apostles must no more have preached in the name of JEsus.
But here was manifest error. And the case is the same to every man that
invincibly and therefore innocently believes it so. Deo potius quam hominibus
is our rule in such cases. For although every man is bound to follow his guide,
unless he believes his guide to mislead him; yet when he sees reason against
his guide, it is best to follow his reason: for though in this he may fall into
error, yet he will escape the sin; he may do violence to truth, but never to
his own conscience; and an honest error is better then an hypocritical
profession of truth, or a violent luxation of the understanding, since if he
retains his honesty and simplicity, he cannot err in a matter of faith or
absolute necessity: Gods goodness has secured all honest and careful persons
from that; for other things, he must follow the best guides he can, and he
cannot be obliged to follow better then God has given him.

And there is yet another way pretended of infallible Numb. 3.
Expositions of Scripture; and that is, by the Spirit. But of this I shall say
no more, but that it is impertinent as to this question. For put case the
Spirit is given to some men enabling them to expound infallibly, yet because
this is but a private assistance, and cannot be proved to others, this
infallible assistance may determine my own assent, but shall not enable me to
prescribe to others, because it were unreasonable I should, unless I could
prove to him that I have the Spirit, and so can secure him from being deceived,
if he relyes upon me. In this case I may say as S. Paul in the case of praying
with the Spirit, He verily gives thanks well, but the other is not edified. So
that let this pretense be as true as it will, it is sufficient that it cannot
be of consideration in this question.

The result of all is this; Since it is not reasonable to limit and prescribe
to all men's understandings by any external rule in the Numb. 4.
interpretation of difficult places of Scripture which is our rule: Since no
man nor company of men is secure from error, or can secure us that they are
free from malice, interest and design; and since all the ways by which we
usually are taught, as Tradition, Councels, Decretals, etc. are very uncertain
in the matter, in their authority, in their being legitimate and natural, and
many of them certainly false, and nothing certain but the divine authority of
Scripture, in which all that is necessary is plain, and much of that that is
not necessary is very obscure, intricate and involved, either we must set up
our rest, only upon articles of faith, and plain places, and be incurious of
other obscurer revelations, (which is a duty for persons of private
understandings, and of no public function) or if we will search further (to
which in some measure the guides of others are obliged) it remains we inquire
how men may determine themselves, so as to do their duty to God, and not to
diserve the Church, that every such man may do what he is bound to, in his
personal capacity, and as he relates to the public as a public minister.

SECT. X.
Of the authority of Reason, and that it proceeding upon best grounds is the
best judge,

HEre then I consider, that although no man may be trusted to judge for all
others, unless this person were infallible and Numb. 1.
authorized so to do, which no man nor no company of men is, yet every man may
be trusted to judge for himself, I say every man that can judge at all, (as for
others they are to be saved as it pleases God) but others that can judge at
all must either choose their guides who shall judge for them, (and then they
oftentimes do the wisest, and always save themselves a labor, but then they
choose too) or if they be persons of greater understanding, then they are to
choose for themselves in particular, what the others do in general, and by
choosing their guide; and for this any man may be better trusted for himself
then any man can be for another: For in this case his own interest is most
concerned; and ability is not so necessary as honesty, which certainly every
man will best preserve in his own case, and to himself, (and if he does not,
it is he that must smart for it) and it is not required of us not to be in
error, but that we endeavor to avoid it.

2. He that follows his guide so far as his reason goes along with him, or
which is all one, he that follows his own reason Numb. 2.
(not guided only by natural arguments, but by divine revelation, and all
other good means) has great advantages over him that gives himself wholly to
follow any humane guide whatsoever, because he follows all their reasons and
his own too; he follows them till reason leaves them, or till it seems so to
him, which is all one to his particular, for by the confession of all sides, an
erroneous Conscience binds him, when a right guide does not bind him. But he
that gives himself up wholly to a guide is oftentimes (I mean, if he be a
discerning person) forced to do violence to his own understanding, and to lose
all the benefit of his own discretion, that he may reconcile his reason to his
guide. And of this we see infinite inconveniences in the Church of Rome, for we
find persons of great understanding, oftentimes so amused with the authority
of their Church, that it is pity to see them sweat in answering some
objections, which they know not how to do, but yet believe they must, because
the Church has said it. So that if they read, study, pray, search records,
and use all the means of art and industry in the pursuit of truth, it is not
with a resolution to follow that which shall seem truth to them, but to confirm
what before they did believe: and if any argument shall seem unanswerable
against any Article of their Church, they are to take it for a temptation, not
for an illumination, and they are to use it accordingly: which makes them make
the Devil to be the Author of that which Gods Spirit has assisted them to
find in the use of lawful means and the search of truth. And when the Devil
of falsehood is like to be cast out by Gods Spirit, they say that it is through
Beelzebub; which was one of the worst things that ever the Pharisees said or
did: And was it not a plain stifling of the just and reasonable demands made by
the Emperor, by the Kings of France and Spain, and by the ablest Divines
among them which was used in the Council of Trent, when they demanded the
restitution of Priests to their liberty of marriage, the use of the Chalice,
the Service in the vulgar Tongue, and these things not only in pursuance of
Truth, but for other great and good ends, even to take away an infinite
scandal and a great schism? And yet when they themselves did profess it, and
all the world knew these reasonable demands were denied merely upon a politic
consideration, yet that these things should be framed into articles, and
decrees of faith, and they for ever after bound not only not to desire the
same things, but to think the contrary to be divine truths: never was Reason
made more a slave or more useless. Must not all the world say, either they must
be great hypocrites, or do great violence to their understanding, when they
not only cease from their claim, but must also believe it to be unjust? If the
use of their reason had not been restrained by the tyranny and imperiousness
of their guide, what the Emperor, and the Kings, and their Theologues would
have done, they can best judge who consider the reasonableness of the demand,
and the unreasonableness of the denial. But we see many wise men who with
their Optandum esset ut Ecclesia licentiam daret, etc. proclaim to all the
world, that in some things they consent and do not consent, and do not
heartily believe what they are bound publicly to profess and they themselves
would clearly see a difference, if a contrary decree should be framed by the
Church, they would with an infinite greater confidence rest themselves in other
propositions then what they must believe as the case now stands, and they would
find that the authority of a Church is a prejudice as often as a free and
modest use of reason is a temptation.

3. God will have no man pressed with another inconveniences in matters
spiritual and intellectual, no man's salvation to depend Numb. 3.
upon another, and every tooth that eats sour grapes shall be set on edge for
it self, and for none else: and this is remarkable in that saying of God by
the Prophet, If the Prophet ceases to Ezekiel. 33.
tell my people of their sins, and leads them into error, the people shall die
in their sins, and the blood of them I will require at the hands of that
Prophet: Meaning, that God has so set the Prophets to guide us, that we also
are to follow them by a voluntary assent by an act of choice and election. For
although accidentally and occasionally the sheep may perish by the shepherds
fault, yet that which has the chiefest influence upon their final condition,
is their own act and election, and therefore God has so appointed guides to
us, that if we perish, it may be accounted upon both our scores, upon our own
and the guides too, which says plainly, that although we are entrusted to our
guides, yet we are entrusted to our selves too. Our guides must direct us, and
yet if they fail, God has not so left us to them, but he has given us enough
to our selves to discover their failings, and our own duties in all things
necessary. And for other things we must do as well as we can. But it is best
to follow our guides, if we know nothing better; but if we do, it is better to
follow the pillar of fire, than a pillar of cloud, though both possibly may
lead to Canaan: But then also it is possible that it may be otherwise. But I am
sure if I do my own best, then if it be best to follow a Guide, and if it be
also necessary, I shall be sure by Gods grace and my own endeavor, to get to
it; But if I without the particular engagement of my own understanding, follow
a guide, possibly I may be guilty of extreme negligence, or I may extinguish
Gods Spirit, or do violence to my own reason. And whether intrusting my self
wholly with another, be not a laying up my talent in a napkin, I am not so well
assured. I am certain the other is not. And since another man's answering for me
will not hinder, but that I also shall answer for my self; as it concerns him
to see he does not wilfully misguide me, so it concerns me to see that he shall
not if I can help it, if I cannot it will not be required at my hands: whether
it be his fault, or his invincible error, I shall be charged with neither.

4. This is no other then what is enjoined as a duty. For since Numb. 4.
God will be justified with a free obedience, and there is an obedience of
understanding as well as of will and affection, it is of great concernment, as
to be willing to believe what ever God says, so also to enquire diligently
whether the will of God be so as is pretended. Even our acts of understanding
are acts of choice, Mat. 15. 10. Joh. 5. 40. 1 John 4. 1. Ephesians. 5. 17. Luke
24. 25. Romans 3. 11. 1. 28. Apoc. 2. 2. Act. 17. 11.
and therefore it is commanded as a duty, to search the Scriptures, to try the
spirits whether they be of God or no, of our selves to be able to judge what is
right, to try all things, and to retain that which is best. For he that
resolves not to consider, resolves not to be careful whether he have truth or
no, and therefore has an affection indifferent to truth or falsehood, which is
all one as if he did choose amiss; and since when things are truly propounded
and made reasonable and intelligible we cannot but assent, and then it is no
thanks to us; we have no way to give our wills to God in matters of belief,
but by our industry in searching it and examining the grounds upon which the
propounders build their dictates. And the not doing it is oftentimes a cause
that God gives a man over (...), into a reprobate and undiscerning mind and
understanding.

5. And this very thing (though men will not understand it) is Numb. 5.
the perpetual practice of all men in the world that can give a reasonable
account of their faith. The very Catholic Church it self is rationabilis and
ubique diffusa, says Optatus, reasonable, as Lib. 3.
well as diffused, every where. For take the Proselites of the Church of Rome,
even in their greatest submission of understanding, they seem to themselves to
follow their reason most of all. For if you tell them, Scripture and Tradition
are their rules to follow, they will believe you when they know a reason for
it, and if they take you upon your word, they have a reason for that too,
either they believe you a learned man, or a good man, or that you can have no
ends upon them, or something that is of an equal height to fit their
understandings. If you tell them they must believe the Church, you must tell
them why they are bound to it, and if you quote Scripture to prove it, you must
give them leave to judge, whether the words alleged speak your sense or no,
and therefore to dissent if they say no such thing. And although all men are
not wise, and proceed discreetly, yet all make their choice some way or other.
He that chooses to please his fancy takes his choice as much as he that
chooses prudently. And no man speaks more unreasonably, then he that denies to
men the use of their Reason in choice of their Religion. For that I may by the
way remove the common prejudice, Reason and Authority are not things
incompetent or repugnant, especially when the Authority is infallible and
supreme: for there is no greater reason in the world then to believe such an
authority. But then we must consider, whether every authority that pretends to
be such, is so indeed. And therefore Deus dixit, ergo hoc verum est, is the
greatest demonstration in the world for things of this nature. But it is not so
in humane dictates, and yet reason and humane authority are not enemies. For it
is a good argument for us to follow such an opinion, because it is made sacred
by the authority of Counsels and Ecclesiastical Tradition, and sometimes it
is the best reason we have in a question, and then it is to be strictly
followed; but there may also be at other times a reason greater than it that
speaks against it, and then the authority must not carry it. But then the
difference is not between reason and authority, but between this reason and
that, which is greater: for authority is a very good reason, and is to
prevail, unless a stronger comes and disarms it, but then it must give place.
So that in this question by [Reason] I do not mean a distinct Topic, but a
transcendent that runs through all Topics; for Reason, like Logic, is
instrument of all things else, and when Revelation, and Philosophy, and
public Experience, and all other grounds of probability or demonstration have
supplied us with matter, then Reason does but make use of them; that is, in
plain terms, there being so many ways of arguing, so many sects, such
differing interests, such variety of authority, so many pretenses, and so many
false beliefes, it concerns every wise man to consider which is the best
argument, which proposition relies upon the truest grounds: and if this were
not his only way, why do men dispute and urge arguments, why do they cite
Councels and Fathers, why do they allege Scripture and Tradition, and all this
on all sides, and to contrary purposes? If we must judge, then we must use our
reason; if we must not judge, why do they produce evidence? Let them leave
disputing and decree propositions magisterially, but then we may choose whether
we will believe them or no; or if they say we must believe them, they must
prove it, and tell us why. And all these disputes concerning Tradition,
Counsels, Fathers, etc. are not arguments against or besides reason, but
contestations and pretenses to the best arguments, and the most certain
satisfaction of our reason. But then all these coming into question, submit
themselves to reason, that is, to be judged by humane understanding, upon the
best grounds and information it can receive. So that Scripture, Tradition,
Counsels, and Fathers, are the evidence in a question, but Reason is the
Judge: That is, we being the persons that are to be persuaded, we must see that
we be persuaded reasonably, and it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser
evidence, when a greater and cleerer is propounded, but of that every man for
himself is to take cognizance if he be able to judge, if he be not, he is not
bound under the tie of necessity to know any thing of it; that, that is
necessary shall be certainly conveyed to him, God that best can, will certainly
take care for that; for if he does not, it becomes to be not necessary; or if
it should still remain necessary, and he damned for not knowing it, and yet to
know it be not in his power, then who can help it? there can be no further care
in this business. In other things, there being no absolute and prime necessity,
we are left to our liberty to judge that way that makes best demonstration of
our piety and of our love to God and truth, not that way that is always the
best argument of an excellent understanding, for this may be a blessing, but
the other only is a duty.

And now that we are pitched upon that way which is most natural Numb. 6.
and reasonable in determination of our selves rather then of questions, which
are often indeterminable, since right reason proceeding upon the best grounds
it can, viz. of divine revelation and humane authority, and probability is our
guide, (Stando in humanis) and supposing the assistance of Gods Spirit (which
he never denies them that fail not of their duty in all such things in which
he requires truth and certainty) it remains that we consider how it comes to
pass that men are so much deceived in the use of their reason, and choice of
their Religion, and that in this account we distinguish those accidents which
make error innocent from those which make it become a heresy.

SECT. XI.
Of some causes of Error in the exercise of Reason which are inculpate in
themselves.

1. THen I consider, that there are a great many inculpable causes of Error,
which are arguments of humane imperfections, Numb. 1.
not convictions of a sin. And (1.) the variety of humane understandings is
so great, that what is plain and apparent to one, is difficult and obscure to
another; one will observe a consequent from a common principle, and another
from thence will conclude the quite contrary. When S. Peter saw the vision of
the sheet let down with all sorts of beasts in it, and a voice saying, Surge
Petre, macta and manduca, if he had not by a particular assistance been
directed to the meaning of the holy Ghost, possibly he might have had other
apprehensions of the meaning of that vision, for to my self it seems
naturally to speak nothing but the abolition of the Mosaicall rites, and the
restitution of us to that part of Christian liberty which consists in the
promiscuous eating of meats; and yet besides this, there want not some
understandings in the world, to whom these words seem to give Saint Peter a
power to kill heretical Princes. Me thinks it is a strange understanding that
makes such extractions, but Bozius and Baronius did so. But men may understand
what they please, especially when they are to expound Oracles. It was an
argument of some wit, but of singularity of understanding, that happened in the
great contestation between the Missalls of Saint Ambrose and Saint Gregory.
The lot was thrown, and God made to be Judge, so as he was tempted to a
miracle, to answer a question which themselves might have ended without much
trouble. The two Missals were laid upon the Altar, and the Church door shut and
sealed. By the morrow Mattins they found S. Gregory's Missall torn in pieces
(says the story) and thrown about the Church, but S. Ambrose's opened and laid
upon the Altar in a posture of being read. If I had been to judge of the
meaning of this Miracle, I should have made no scruple to have said it had been
the will of God that the Missall of S. Ambrose which had been anciently used,
and publicly tried and approved of, should still be read in the Church, and
that of Gregory let alone, it being torn by an Angelical hand as an argument
of its imperfection, or of the inconvenience of innovation. But yet they judged
it otherwise, for by the tearing and scattering about, they thought it was
meant, it should be used over all the world, and that of S. Ambrose read only
in the Church of Millaine. I am more satisfied that the former was the true
meaning, then I am of the truth of the story: But we must suppose that. And now
there might have been eternal disputings about the meaning of the miracle, and
nothing left to determine, when two fancies are the litigants, and the
contestations about probabilities hinc inde. And I doubt not this was one cause
of so great variety of opinions in the Primitive Church, when they proved their
several opinions which were mysterious questions of Christian Theology, by
testimonies out of the obscurer Prophets, out of the Psalms and Canticles, as
who please to observe their arguments of discourse and actions of Council shall
perceive they very much used to do. Now although men's understandings be not
equal, and that it is fit the best understandings should prevail, yet that
will not satisfy the weaker understandings, because all men will not think
that another understanding is better then his own, at least not in such a
particular, in which with fancy he has pleased himself. But commonly they that
are least able, are most bold, and the more ignorant is the more confident,
therefore it is but reason if he would have another bear with him, he also
should bear with another, and if he will not be prescribed to, neither let him
prescribe to others. And there is the more reason in this; because such modesty
is commonly to be desired of the more imperfect; for wise men know the ground
of their persuasion, and have their confidence proportionable to their
evidence, others have not, but over-act their trifles: and therefore I said it
is but a reasonable demand, that they that have the least reason should not be
most imperious; and for others it being reasonable enough, for all their great
advantages upon other men, they will be soon persuaded to it; for although
wise men might be bolder, in respect of the persons of others less discerning,
yet they know there are but few things so certain as to create much boldness
and confidence of assertion, If they do not, they are not the men I take them
for.

2. When an action or opinion is commenced with zeal and piety against a
known vice or a vicious person, commonly all the Numb. 2.
mistakes of it is proceeding are made sacred by the holiness of the principle,
and so abuses the persuasions of good people, that they make it as a
Characteristick note to distinguish good persons from bad; and then whatever
error is consecrated by this means, is therefore made the more lasting, because
it is accounted holy, and the persons are not easily accounted heretics,
because they erred upon a pious principle. There is a memorable instance in one
of the greatest questions of Christendom, viz. concerning Images. For when
Philippicus had espied the images of the six first Synods upon the front of a
Church, he caused them to be pulled down; now he did it in hatred of the sixth
Synod: for he being a Monothelite, stood condemned by that Synod. The
Catholics that were zealous for the sixth Synod, caused the images and
representments to be put up again, and then sprung the question concerning the
lawfullness of images in Churches; Philippicus and his party strived by
suppressing images to do disparagement to the sixth Synod: the Catholics to
preserve the honor Vid. Paulum Diaconum.
of the sixth Synod, would uphold images. And then the question came to be
changed, and they who were easy enough to be persuaded to pull down images,
were overawed by a prejudice against the Monothelites, and the Monothelites
strived to maintain the advantage they had got by a just and pious pretense
against images. The Monothelites would have secured their error by the
advantage and consociation of a truth, and the other would rather defend a
dubious and disputable error, than lose and let go a certain truth. And thus
the case stood, and the successors of both parts were led invincibly. For when
the Heresy of the Monothelites disbanded, (which it did in a while after) yet
the opinion of the Iconoclasts, and the question of Images grew stronger. Yet
since the Iconoclasts at the first were Heretics, not for their breaking
Images, but for denying the two wills of Christ, his Divine and his Humane: that
they were called Iconoclasts was to distinguish their opinion in the question
concerning the Images, but that then Iconoclasts so easily had the reputation
of Heretics, was because of the other opinion which was conjunct in their
persons; which opinion men afterward did not easily distinguish in them, but
took them for Heretics in gross, and whatsoever they held to be heretical.
And thus upon this prejudice grew great advantages to the veneration of Images,
and the persons at first were much to be excused, because they were misguided
by that which might have abused the best men. And if Epiphanius who was as
zealous against Images in Churches as Philippicus or Leo Isaurus, had but begun
a public contestation, and engaged Emperors to have made Decrees against
them, Christendom would have had other apprehensions of it, then they had when
the Monothelites began it. For few men will endure a truth from the mouth of
the Devil, and if the person be suspected, so are his ways too. And it is a
great subtlety of the Devil so to temper truth and falsehood in the same
person, that truth may lose much of its reputation by its mixture with error,
and the error may become more plausible by reason of its conjunction with
truth. And this we see by too much experience, for we see many truths are
blasted in their reputation, because persons whom we think we hate upon just
grounds of Religion, have taught them. And it was plain enough in the case of
Maldonat, that said of an explication of a place of Scripture, that it was In
cap 6. Johan.
most agreeable to Antiquity, but because Calvin had so expounded it, he
therefore chose a new one. This was malice. But when a prejudice works
tacitly, undiscernably, and irresistabl^ of the person so wrought upon, the
man is to be pityed, not condemned, though possibly his opinion deserves it
highly. And therefore it has been usual to discredit doctrines by the
personal defaillances of them that preach them: or with the disreputation of
that sect that maintains them in conjunction with other perverse doctrines.
Faustus the Manichee in S. Austin, glories much, that in their Religion God was
worshipped purely and without Images. L. 20. c. 3. cont. Faustum Man. L. 1. c.
ult. de Imagine.
S. Austin liked it well, for so it was in his too, but from hence Sanders
concludes, that to pull down Images in Churches was the heresy of the
Manichees. The Jews endure no Images, therefore Bellarmine makes it to be a
piece of Judaisme to oppose them. He might as well have concluded against
saying our prayers, and Church music, that it is Judaicall, because the Jews
used it. And De reliq. SS. l. 2. c. 6. Sect. Nicolaus.
he would be loath to be served so himself, for he that had a mind to use such
arguments, might with much better probability conclude against their Sacrament
of extreme unction, because when the miraculous healing was ceased, then they
were not Catholics, but Heretics that did transfer it to the use of dying
persons, (says Irenaeus;) for so did the Valentinians: And indeed L. 1. c. 8.
adv. haer.
this argument is something better then I thought for at first, because it was
in Irenaeus time reckoned among the heresies. But there are a sort of men that
are even with them, and hate some good things which the Church of Rome teaches,
because she who teaches so many errors, has been the publisher, and is the
practicer of those things. I confess the thing is always unreasonable, but
sometimes it is invincible and innocent; and then may serve to abate the fury
of all such decretory sentences, as condemn all the world but their own
Disciples.

3. There are some opinions that have gone hand in hand with Numb. 3.
a blessing, and a prosperous profession; and the good success of their
defenders has amused many good people, because they thought they heard Gods
voice where they saw Gods hand, and therefore have rushed upon such opinions
with great piety and as great mistaking. For where they once had entertained a
fear of God, and apprehension of his so sensible declaration, such a fear
produces scruple, and a scrupulous conscience is always to be pityed, because
though it is seldom wise, it is always pious. And this very thing has
prevailed so far upon the understandings even of wise men, that Bellarmine
makes it a note of the true Church. Which opinion when it prevails is a ready
way to make, that instead of Martyrs all men should prove heretics or
apostates in persecution; for since men in misery are very suspicious, out of
strong desires to find out the cause, that by removing it they may be
relieved, they apprehend that to be it that is first presented to their fears;
and then if ever truth be afflicted, she shall also be destroyed. I will say
nothing in defiance of this fancy, although all the experience in the world
says it is false, and that of all men Christians should least believe it to be
true, to whom a perpetual cross is their certain expectation, (and the
argument is like the Moon, for which no garment can be fit, it alters
according to the success of humane affairs, and in one age will serve a Papist,
and in another a Protestant) yet when such an opinion does prevail upon
timorous persons, the malignity of their error (if any be consequent to this
fancy, and taken up upon the reputation of a prosperous heresy) is not to be
considered simply and nakedly, but abatement is to be made in a just proportion
to that fear, and to that apprehension.

4. Education is so great and so invincible a prejudice, that he Numb. 4.
who masters the inconvenience of it, is more to be commended than he can
justly be blamed that complyes with it. For men do not always call them
principles which are the prime fountains of reason, from whence such
consequents naturally flow, as are to guide the actions and discourses of men;
but they are principles which they are first taught, which they sucked in next
to their milk, and by a proportion to those first principles they usually take
their estimate of propositions. For whatsoever is taught to them at first they
believe infinitely, for they know nothing to the contrary, they have had no
other masters, whose theoremes might abate the strength of their first
persuasions, and it is a great advantage in those cases to get possession; and
before their first principles can be dislodged, they are made habitual and
complexionall, it is in their nature then to believe them, and this is helped
forward very much by the advantage of love and veneration which we have to the
first parents of our persuasions. And we see it in the orders of Regulars in
the Church of Rome. That opinion which was the opinion of their Patron or
Founder, or of some eminent Personage of the Institute, is enough to engage all
the Order to be of that opinion; and it is strange that all the Dominicans
should be of one opinion in the matter of Predetermination and immaculate
conception, and all the Franciscans of the quite contrary, as if their
understandings were formed in a different mold, and furnished with various
principles by their very rule. Now this prejudice works by many principles, but
how strongly they do possess the understanding is visible in that great
instance of the affection and perfect persuasion the weaker sort of people have
to that which they call the Religion of their Forefathers. You may as well
charm a fever asleep with the noise of Optima vati ea quae magno ossensu,
recepta sunt, quorumque exempla multa sant, nec ad rationem, sed ad
similitudinem vivimus. Sen. Vid. Minut. Fell. octav.
bells, as make any pretense of reason against that Religion which old men have
intayl'd upon their heirs male so many generations till they can prescribe. And
the Apostles found this to be most true in the extremest difficulty they met
with, to contest against the rites of Moses, and the long superstition of the
Gentiles, which they therefore thought fit to be retained, because they had
done so formerly, Pergentes non quo eundum est, sed quo itur, and all the
blessings of this life which God gave them, they had in conjunction with their
Religion, and therefore they believed it was for their Religion, and this
persuasion was bound fast in them with ribs of iron, the Apostles were forced
to unloose the whole conjuncture of parts and principles in their
understandings, before they could make them malleable and receptive of any
impresses. But the observation and experience of all wise men can justify this
truth. All that I shall say to the present purpose, is this, that consideration
is to be had to the weakness of persons when they are prevailed upon by so
innocent a prejudice, and when there cannot be arguments strong enough to
over-master an habitual persuasion bred with a man, nourished up with him,
that always eat at his table, and lay in his bosom, he is not easily to be
called Heretic, for if he keeps the foundation of faith, other articles are
not so clearly demonstrated on either side, but that a man may innocently be
abused to the contrary. And therefore in this case to handle him charitably, is
but to do him justice: And when an opinion in minoribus articulis, is
entertained upon the title and stock of education, it may be the better
permitted to him, since upon no better stock nor stronger arguments, most men
entertain their whole Religion, even Christianity it self.

5. There are some persons of a differing persuasion, who therefore Numb. 5.
are the rather to be tolerated, because the indirect practices and impostures
of their adversaries have confirmed them, that those opinions which they
disavow, are not from God, as being upheld by means not of Gods appointment:
For it is no unreasonable discourse to say, that God will not be served with a
lie, for he does not need one, and he has means enough to support all those
truths which he has commanded, and has supplied every honest cause with
enough for its maintenance, and to contest against its adversaries. And (but
that they which use indirect arts will not be willing to lose any of their
unjust advantages, nor yet be charitable to those persons, whom either to gain
or to undo, they leave nothing unattempted) the Church of Rome has much
reason not to be so decretory in her sentences against persons of a differing
persuasion, for if their cause were entirely the cause of God, they have given
wise people reason to suspect it, because some of them have gone to the Devil
to defend it. And if it be remembered what tragedies were stirred up against
Luther, for saying, the Devil had taught him an argument against the Mass, it
will be of as great advantage against them, that they go to the Devil for
many arguments to support not only the Mass, but the other distinguishing
Articles of their Church: I instance in the notorious forging of Miracles, and
framing of false and ridiculous Legends. For the former I need no other
instances then what happened in the great contestation about the immaculate
conception, when there were Miracles brought on both sides to prove the
contradictory parts; and though it be more then probable that both sides played
the jugglers, yet the Dominicans had the ill luck to be discovered, and the
actors burned at Berne. But this discovery happened by providence; for the
Dominican opinion has more degrees of probability then the Franciscan; is
clearly more consonant both to Scripture and all antiquity, and this part of it
is acknowledged by the greatest Patrons themselves, as Salmeron, Posa and
Wadding, yet because they played the knaves in a just question, and used false
arts to maintain a true proposition, God Almighty to show that he will not be
served by a lie, was pleased rather to discover the imposture in the right
opinion then in the false, since nothing is more dishonorable to God, then to
offer a sin in sacrifice to him, and nothing more incongruous in the nature of
the thing, then that truth and falsehood should support each other, or that true
doctrine should live at the charges of a lie. And he that considers the
arguments for each opinion will easily conclude, that if God would not have
truth confirmed by a lie, much less would he himself attest a lie with a true
miracle. And by this ground it will easily follow, that the Franciscan party,
although they had better luck then the Dominicans, yet had not more honesty,
because their cause was worse, and therefore their arguments no whit the
better. And although the argument drawn from miracles is good to attest a holy
doctrine, which by its own worth will support it self, after way is a little
made by miracles, yet of it self and by its own reputation it will not
support any fabric; for instead of proving a doctrine to be true, it makes
that the miracles themselves are suspected to be illusions, if they be
pretended in behalf of a doctrine, which we think we have reason to account
false. And therefore the Jews did not believe Christ's doctrine for his
Miracles, but dis-beleeved the truth of his Miracles, because they did not like
his doctrine. And if the holiness of his doctrine, and the Spirit of God by
inspirations and infusions, and by that which Saint Peter calls a surer word of
prophecy, had not attested the Divinity both of his Person and his Office, we
should have wanted many degrees of confidence which now we have upon the truth
of Christian Religion. But now since we are foretold by this surer word of
prophecy, that is, the prediction of Jesus Christ, Vid. Baron. AE. D. 68. n.
22. Philostrat. l. 4. T. 485. compend. Cedren. p. 202.
that Antichrist should come in all wonders, and signs, and lying miracles, and
that the Church saw much of that already verified in Simon Magus, Apollonius
Tyaneus, and Manetho, and diverse Stapleton. prompt. Moral. pars aestiva, p. 627.
Heretics, it is now come to that pass, that the argument in its best
advantage proves nothing so much as that the doctrine which it pretends to
prove, is to be suspected, because it was foretold that false doctrine should
be obtruded under such pretenses. But then when not only true miracles are an
insufficient argument to prove a truth since the establishment of Christianity,
but that the miracles themselves are false and spurious, it makes that doctrine
in whose defense they come, justly to be suspected, because they are a
demonstration that the interested persons use all means, leave nothing
unattempted to prove their propositions; but since they so fail as to bring
nothing from God, but something from the Devil for its justification, it is a
great sign that the doctrine is false, because we know the Devil, unless it
be against his will, does nothing to prove a true proposition that makes
against him. And now then those persons who will endure no man of another
opinion, might do well to remember how by their exorcismes, their Devils
tricks at Lowdon, and the other side pretending to cure mad folks and persons
bewitched, and the many discoveries of their juggling, they have given so much
reason to their adversaries to suspect their doctrine, that either they must
not be ready to condemn their persons who are made suspicious by their
indirect proceeding in attestation of that which they value so high as to call
their Religion, or else they must condemn themselves for making the scandal
active and effectual.

As for false Legends, it will be of the same consideration, because Numb. 4.
they are false Testimonies of Miracles that were never done, which differs
only from the other as a lie in words from a lie in action, but of this we
have witness enough in that decree of Pope Leo X. session the eleventh, of the
last Lateran Council, where he excommunicates all the forgers and inventors of
visions and false Miracles, which is a testimony that it was then a practice so
public as to need a Law for its suppression; and if any man shall doubt
whether it were so or not, let him see the Centum gravamina of the Princes of
Germany where it is highly complained of. But the extreme stupidity and
sottishness of the inventors of lying stories is so great, as to give occasion
to some persons to suspect the truth of all Church (...). I^d. Pelus.
story, witness the Legend of Lombardy: of the author of which the Bishop of
the Canaries gives this Testimony, In illo enim libro miraculorum monstra
saepius quam vera miracula legas. Hanc homo scripsit ferrei oris, plumbei
cordis, animi certe parum severi and prudentis. But I need not descend so low,
for Saint Gregory and V. Bid themselves reported miracles, for the authority
of which they only had the report of the common people, and it is not certain
that S. Hierome Vid. L. 11. loc. Theol. cap. 6.
had so much in his stories of S. Paul and S. Anthony, and the Fauns and the
Satyrs which appeared to them, and desired their Canus ibid.
Prayers. But I shall only by way of eminency, note what Sir Thomas More says
in his Epistle to Ruthal the Kings Secretary before the Dialogue of Lucian
[Philopseudes] that therefore he undertook the translation of that dialogue, to
free the world from a superstition that crept in under the face and title of
Religion. For such lies (says he) are transmitted to us with such authority
that a certain impostor had persuaded S. Austin, that the very fable which
Lucian scoffs, makes sport withal in that Viz. De duobus spu inis, altero
decedente, altero in vitam redeunte post viginti dies; quam in ali is nominibus
videt ^^cianus. Vide etiam argumentum Gilberti Cognati, in Annotat. in hunc
Dialog.
Dialogue was a real story, and acted in his own days. The Epistle is worth
the reading to this purpose; but he says this abuse grew to such a height,
that scarce any life of any Saint or Martyr is truly related, but is full of
lies and lying wonders, and some persons thought they served God if they did
honor to God's Saints by inventing some prodigious story, or miracle for their
reputation. So that now it is no wonder if the most pious men are apt to
believe, and the greatest historians are easy enough to report such stories,
which serving to a good end, are also consigned by the report of persons,
otherwise pious and prudent enough. I will not instance in Vincentius his
speculum, Turonensis, Thomas Cantipratanus, John Herolt, Vitae Patrum, nor the
revelations of Vid. Palaeot. de sacra sindone, part 1. Epist. ad Lector.
Saint Briget though confirmed by two Popes, Martin V. and Boniface IX. even
the best and most deliberate amongst them, Lippoman, Surius, Lipsius Bzovius,
and Baronius are so full of fables that they cause great disreputation to the
other Monuments and records of antiquity, and yet do no advantage to the cause
under which they serve and take pay. They do no good and much hurt; but yet
accidentally they may procure this advantage to charity, since they do none to
faith; that since they have so abused the credit of story that our confidences
want much of that support we should receive from her records of antiquity, yet
the men that dissent and are scandalized by such proceedings should be excused
if they should chance to be afraid of truth that has put on garments of
imposture: and since much violence is done to the truth and certainty of their
judging, let none be done to their liberty of judging: since they cannot meet a
right guide, let them have a charitable judge. And since it is one very great
argument against Simon Magus and against Mahomet that we can prove their
miracles to be impostures, it is much to be pitied if timorous and suspicious
persons shall invincibly and honestly less apprehend a truth which they see
conveyed by such a testimony which we all use as an argument to reprove the
Mahumetan superstition.

6. Here also comes in all the weaknesses and trifling prejudices which operate
not by their own strength, but by advantage taken Numb. 7.
from the weakness of some understandings. Some men by a Proverb or a common
saying are determined to the belief of a proposition, for which they have no
argument better then such a Proverbiall sentence. And when diverse of the common
People in Jerusalem were ready to yield their understandings to the belief of
the Messiah, they were turned clearly from their apprehensions by that proverb,
look and see, does any good thing come from Galilee? And this, when Christ
comes, no man knows from whence he is; but this man was known of what
parents, of what City. And thus the weakness of their understanding was
abused, and that made the argument too hard for them. And the whole seventh
Chapter of Saint John's Gospel is a perpetual instance of the efficacy of such
trifling prejudices, and the vanity and weakness of popular understandings.
Some whole ages have been abused by a definition, which being once received,
as most commonly they are upon slight grounds, they are taken for certaintyes
in any science respectively, and for principles, and upon their reputation men
use to frame conclusions, which must be false or uncertain according as the
definitions are. And he that has observed anything of the weaknesses of men,
and the successions of groundless doctrines from age to age, and how seldom
definitions which are put into systemes, or that derive from the Fathers, or
approved among Shool-men are examined by persons of the same interests, will
bear me witness, how many and great inconveniences press hard upon the
persuasions of men, who are abused and yet never consider who hurt them.
Others, and they very many, are lead by authority or examples of Princes, and
great personages, Numquis credit ex Principibus? Some by the reputation of one
learned man are carried into any persuasion whatsoever. Joh. 7.
And in the middle and latter ages of the Church, this was the more
considerable, because the infinite ignorance of the Clerks, and the men of the
long robe gave them over to be lead by those few guides which were marked to
them by an eminency, much more then their ordinary: which also did the more
amuse them, because most commonly they were fit for nothing but to admire what
they understood not; their learning then was in some skill in the Master of the
Sentences, in Aquinas or Scotus whom they admired next to the most intelligent
order of Angels; hence came opinions that made Sects and division of names,
Thomists, Scotists, Albertists, Nominalls, Realls, and I know not what monsters
of names; and whole families of the same opinion, the whole institute of an
Order being engaged to believe according to the opinion of some leading man of
the same Order, as if such an opinion were imposed upon them in vitute sanctae
obedientiae. But this inconvenience is greater when the principle of the
mistake runs higher, when the opinion is derived from a Primitive man and a
Saint, for then it often happens that what at first was but a plain innocent
seduction, comes to be made sacred by the veneration which is consequent to the
person for having lived long agone; and then, because the person is also since
canonized, the error is almost made eternal, and the cure desperate. These and
the like prejudices which are as various as the miseries of humanity or the
variety of humane understandings are not absolute excuses, unless to some
persons, but truly if they be to any, they are exemptions to all, from being
pressed with too peremptory a sentence against them, especially if we consider
what leave is given to all men by the church of Rome to follow any one probable
Doctor in an opinion which is contested against by many more. And as for the
Doctors of the other side, they being destitute of any pretenses to an
infallible medium to determine questions, must of necessity allow the same
liberty to the people, to be as prudent as they can in the choice of a fallible
guide; and when they have chosen, if they do follow him into error, the matter
is not so inexpiable for being deceived in using the best guides we had, which
guides because themselves were abused, did also against their wills deceive me.
So that this prejudice may the easier abuse us, because it is almost like a
duty to follow the dictates of a probable Doctor, or if it be over-acted or
accidentally pass into an inconvenience, it is therefore to be excused because
the principle was not ill, unless we judge by our event, not by the antecedent
probability. Of such men as these it was said by Saint Austin, Caeteram turbam
non intelligendi vivacitas, sed Contr. Fund. c. 4.
credendi simplicitas tutissimam facit. And Gregory Nazianzen, (...). The
common sort of people are Orat. 21.
safe in their not inquiring by their own industry, and in the simplicity of
their understanding relying upon the best guides they can get.

But this is of such a nature in which as we may inculpably be deceived, so we
may turn it into a vice or a design, and then Numb. 6.
the consequent errors will alter the property, and become heresies. There are
some men that have men's persons in admiration because of advantage, and some
that have itching ears, and heap up teachers to themselves. In these and the
like cases the authority of a person, and the prejudices of a great reputation
is not the excuse but the fault: And a sin is so far from excusing an
Error, that Error becomes a sin by reason of it is relation to that sin as
to it is parent and principle.

SECT. XII.
Of the innocence of Error in opinion in a pious person.

ANd therefore as there are so many innocent causes of Error, as there are
weaknesses within, and harmless and unavoydable Numb. 1.
prejudices from without, so if ever error be procured by a vice it has no
excuse, but becomes such a crime, of so much malignity, as to have influence
upon the effect and consequent, and by communication makes it become criminal.
The Apostles noted two such causes: Covetousness and Ambition, the former in
them of the Circumcision, and the latter in Diotrephes and Simon Magus; and
there were some that were (...) 2 Timothy 3.
they were of the long robe too, but they were the she-Disciples, upon whose
Consciences some false Apostles had influence by advantage of their wantonness,
and thus the three principles of all sin become also the principles of
heresy, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. And
in pursuance of these arts the Devil has not wanted fuel to set aworke
incendiaries in all ages of the church. The Bishops were always honorable,
and most commonly had great revenues, and a Bishopric would satisfy the two
designs of Covetousness and Ambition, and this has been the golden apple very
often contended for, and very often the cause of great fires in the Church.
Thebulis quia rejectus ab Episcopatu Hierosolymitano, turbare coepit Ecclesiam,
said Egesippus in Eusebius. Tertullian turned Montanist in discontent for
missing the Bishopric of Carthage after Agrippinus, and so did Montanus
himself for the same discontent, says Nicephorus. Novatus would have been
Bishop of Rome, Donatus of Carthage, Arrius of Alexandria, Aerius of Sebastia,
but they all missed, and therefore all of them vexed Christendom. And this was
so common a thing, that oftentimes, the threatening the Church with a schism,
or a heresy, was a design to get a Bishopric: And Socrates reports of
Asterius, that he did frequent the Conventicles of the Arrians; Nam Episcopatum
aliquem ambiebat. And setting aside the infirmities of men, and their innocent
prejudices; Epiphanius makes pride to be the only cause of heresies, (...),
Pride and Prejudice cause them all, the one criminally, the other innocently.
And indeed S. Paul does almost make pride the only cause of heresies, his
words cannot be expounded, unless it be at least the principal, (...), and
consents not to sound words, and the doctrine that is according to godliness,
(...).

The sum is this, If ever an opinion be begun with pride, or managed with
impiety, or ends in a crime; the man turns Heretic: Numb. 2.
but let the error be never so great, so it be not against an Article of Creed,
if it be simple and has no confederation with the personal iniquity of the
man, the opinion is as innocent as the person, though perhaps as false as he is
ignorant, and therefore shall burn though he himself escape. But in these
cases and many more, (for the causes of deception increase by all accidents,
and weaknesses, and illusions) no man can give certain judgment upon the
persons of men in particular, unless the matter of fact and crime be accident
and notorious. The man cannot by humane judgment be concluded a heretic,
unless his opinion be an open recession from plain demonstrative divine
authority (which must needs be notorious, voluntary, vincible and criminal) or
that there be a palpable serving of an end accidental and extrinsecall to the
opinion.

But this latter is very hard to be discerned, because those accidental and
adherent crimes which makes the man a heretic, Numb. 3.
in questions not simply fundamental or of necessary practice, are actions so
internal and spiritual, that cognizance can but seldom be taken of them. And
therefore (to instance) though the opinion of Purgatory be false, yet to
believe it cannot be heresy, if a man be abused into the belief of it
invincibly, because it is not a Doctrine either fundamentally false or
practically impious, it neither proceeds from the will, nor has any immediate
or direct influence upon choice and manners. And as for those other ends of
upholding that opinion which possibly its Patrons may have, as for the
reputation of their Churches infallibility, for the advantage of Derges,
Requiems, Masses, Monthly minds, Anniversaries, and other offices for the dead,
which usually are very profitable, rich and easy, these things may possibly
have sole influences upon their understanding, but whether they have or no God
only knows. If the proposition and article were true, these ends might justly
be subordinate and consistent with a true proposition. And there are some
truths that are also profitable, as the necessity of maintenance to the Clergy,
the Doctrine of restitution, giving Alms, lending freely, remitting debts in
cases of great necessity: and it would be but an ill argument that the
preachers of these doctrines speak false, because possibly in these articles
they may serve their own ends. For although Demetrius and the Crafts-men were
without excuse for resisting the Preaching of S. Paul, because it was notorious
they resisted the truth upon ground of profit and personal emoluments, and the
matter was confessed by themselves, yet if the Clergy should maintain their
just rites and Revenues which by pious dedications and donatives were long
since ascertained upon them, is it to be presumed in order of Law and charity,
that this end is in the men subordinate to truth, because it is so in the thing
it self, and that therefore no judgment in prejudice of these truths can be
made from that observation?

But if aliunde we are ascertained of the truth or falsehood of Numb. 4.
a proposition respectively, yet the judgment of the personal ends of the
men, cannot ordinarily be certain and judicial, because most commonly the
acts are private, and the purposes internal, and temporal ends may sometimes
consist with truth, and whether the purposes of the men make these ends
principal or subordinate, no man can judge; and be they how they will, yet
they do not always prove that when they are conjunct with error, that the
error was caused by these purposes and criminal intentions.

But in questions practical, the doctrine it self and the person Numb. 5.
too, may with more ease be reproved, because matter of fact being evident, and
nothing being so certain as the experiments of humane affairs, and these
being the immediate consequents of such doctrines, are with some more certainty
of observation redargued, then the speculative; whose judgment is of it self
more difficult, more remote from matter and humane observation, and with less
curiosity and explicitenesse declared in Scripture as being of less
consequence and concernment in order to Gods and Man's great end. In other
things which end in notion and ineffective contemplation, where neither the
doctrine is malicious, nor the person apparently criminal, he is to be left to
the judgment of God, and as there is no certainty of humane judicature in this
case, so it is to no purpose it should be judged. For if the person may be
innocent with his Error, and there is no rule whereby he can certainly be
pronounced, that he is actually criminal; (as it happens in matters
speculative.) Since the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure
conscience, and faith unfeigned; and the Commandment may obtain its end in a
consistence with this simple speculative Error, Why should men trouble
themselves with such opinions, so as to disturb the public charity or the
private confidence? Opinions and persons are just so to be judged as other
matters and persons criminal. For no man can judge any thing else: it must be
a crime, and it must be open, so as to take cognizance, and make true humane
judgment of it. And this is all I am to say concerning the causes of heresies,
and of the distinguishing rules for guiding of our judgments toward others.

As for guiding our judgments and the use of our reason Numb. 6.
in judging for our selves, all that is to be said is reducible to this one
proposition. Since errors are then made sins when they are contrary to
charity or inconsistent with a good life and the honor of God, that judgment
is the truest, or at least that opinion most innocent that 1. best promotes the
reputation of Gods Glory, and 2. is the best instrument of holy life. For in
questions and interpretations of dispute, these two analogies are the best to
make propositions, and conjectures and determinations. Diligence and care in
obtaining the best guides, and the most convenient assistances, prayer, and
modesty of spirit, simplicity of purposes and intentions, humility and aptness
to learn, and a peaceable disposition, are therefore necessary to finding out
truths, because they are parts of good life, without which our truths will do
us little advantage, and our errors can have no excuse, but with these
dispositions as he is sure to find out all that is necessary, so what truth he
inculpably misses of, he is sure is therefore not necessary, because he could
not find it when he did his best and his most innocent endeavors. And this I
say to secure the persons; because no rule can antecedently secure the
proposition in matters disputable. For even in the proportions and explications
of this rule there is infinite variety of disputes: And when the dispute is
concerning free will, one party denies it because he believes it magnifies the
grace of God, that it works irresistably; the other affirms, because he
believes it engages us upon greater care and piety of our endeavors. The one
opinion thinks God reapes the glory of our good actions, the other thinks it
charges our bad actions upon him. So in the question of merit, one part chooses
his assertion because he thinks it incourages us to do good works, the other
believes it makes us proud, and therefore he rejects it. The first believes it
increases piety, the second believes it increases spiritual presumption and
vanity. The first thinks it magnifies God's justice, the other thinks it
derogates from his mercy. Now then, since neither this nor any ground can
secure a man from possibility of mistaking, we were infinitely miserable if it
would not secure us from punishment, so long as we willingly consent not to a
crime, and do our best endeavor to avoid an error. Only by the way, let me
observe, that since there are such great differences of apprehension concerning
the consequents of an article, no man is to be charged with the odious
consequences of his opinion. Indeed his doctrine is, but the person is not, if
he understands not such things to be consequent to his Doctrine; for if he did,
and then avows them, they are his direct opinions, and he stands as chargeable
with them as with his first propositions; but if he dis-avowes them, he would
certainly rather quit his opinion then avow such errors or impieties, which
are pretended to be consequent to it, because every man knows that can be no
truth, from whence falsehood naturally and immediately does derive, and he
therefore believes his first proposition, because he believes it innocent of
such errors as are charged upon it directly or consequently.

So that now, since no error neither for its self nor its consequents Numb. 7.
is to be charged as criminal upon a pious person, since no simple error is a
sin, nor does condemn us before the throne of God, since he is so pitiful to
our crimes, that he pardons many de toto and integro, in all makes abatement
for the violence of temptation, and the surprizall and invasion of our
faculties, and therefore much less will demand of us an account for our
weaknesses; and since the strongest understanding cannot pretend to such an
immunity and exemption from the condition of men, as not to be deceived and
confess its weakness; it remains we inquire what deportment is to be used
toward persons of a differing persuasion, when we are (I do not say doubtful
of a proposition, but) convinced that he that differs from us is in Error, for
this was the first intention, and the last end of this discourse.

SECT. XIII.
Of the deportment to be used toward persons disagreeing, and the reasons why
they are not to be punished with death, etc.

FOr although every man may be deceived, yet some are right and may know it
too, for every man that may err, does Numb. 1.
not therefore certainly err, and if he erres because he recedes from his
rule, then if he follows it he may do right, and if ever any man upon just
grounds did change his opinion, then he was in the right and was sure of it
too, and although confidence is mistaken for a just persuasion many times, yet
some men are confident, and have reason so to be. Now when this happens, the
question is what deportment they are to use toward persons that disagree from
them, and by consequence are in error.

1. Then no Christian is to be put to death, dismembered, or otherwise directly
persecuted for his opinion, which does not Numb. 2.
teach impiety or blasphemy. If it plainly and apparently brings in a crime,
and himself does act it or encourage it, then the matter of fact is punishable
according to its proportion or malignity; as if he preaches treason or
sedition, his opinion is not his excuse, because it brings in a crime, and a
man is never the less traitor, because he believes it lawful to commit
treason; and a man is a murderer if he kills his brother unjustly, although he
thinks he does God good service in it. Matters of fact are equally judicable
whether the principle of them be from within or from without: And if a man
could pretend to innocence in being seditious, blasphemous, or perjured by
persuading himself it is lawful, there were as great a gate opened to all
iniquity, as will entertain all the pretenses, the designs, the impostures,
and disguises of the world. And therefore God has taken order that all rules
concerning matters of fact and good life shall be so clearly explicated, that
without the crime of the man, he cannot be ignorant of all his practical duty.
And therefore the Apostles and primitive Doctors made no scruple of condemning
such persons for heretics, that did dogmatize a sin. He that teaches others
to sin, is worse then he that commits the crime, whether he be tempted by his
own interest, or encouraged by the others doctrine. It was as bad in Basilides
to teach it to be lawful to renounce Faith and Religion, and take all manner
of Oaths and Covenants in time of persecution, as if himself had done so; nay
it is as much worse, as the mischeife is more universal, or as a fountain is
greater then a drop of water taken from it. He that writes Treason in a book,
or preaches Sedition in a Pulpit, and persuades it to the people, is the
greatest Traitor and incendiary, and his opinion there is the fountain of a
sin, and therefore could not be entertained in his understanding upon
weakness, or inculpable or innocent prejudice; he cannot from Scripture or
divine revelation have any pretense to color that so fairly as to seduce
either a wise or an honest man. If it rest there and goes no further, it is not
cognoscible, and so scapes that way; but if it be published and comes a stylo
ad Machaeram (as Tertullians phrase is) then it becomes matter of fact in
principle and in persuasion, and is just so punishable, as is the crime that it
persuades: such were they of whom S. Paul complains, who brought in damnable
doctrines and lusts. S. Paul's Gal. 5.
Utinam abscindantur is just of them, take it in any sense of rigor and
severity, so it be proportionable to the crime, or criminal doctrine. Such
were those of whom God spoke in Deuteronomy. 13. If any Prophet tempts to idolatry,
saying, let us go after other Gods, he shall be slain. But these do not come
into this question. But the proposition is to be understood concerning
questions disputable in materia intellectuali, which also for all that law of
killing, such false Prophets were permitted with impunity in the Synagogue, as
appears beyond exception in the great divisions and disputes between the
Pharisees and the Sadduces. I deny not but certain and known idolatry or any
other sort of practical impiety with its principiant doctrine may be punished
corporally, because it is no other but matter of fact, but no matter of mere
opinion, no errors that of themselves are not sins are to be persecuted or
punished by death or corporal inflictions. This is now to be proved.

2. All the former discourse is sufficient argument how easy it is for us in
such matters to be deceived. So long as Christian Religion Numb. 3.
was a simple profession of the articles of belief, and a hearty prosecution
of the rules of good life, the fewness of the articles and the clearness of
the rule, was cause of the seldom prevarication. But when divinity is swelled
up to so great a body, when the several questions which the peevishness and
wantonness of sixteen ages have commenced, are concentred into one, and from
all these questions something is drawn into the body of Theology till it has
ascended up to the greatness of a mountain, and the sum of Divinity
collected by Aquinas, makes a volume as great as was that of Livy mocked at in
the Epigramme,

Quem mea vix totum bibliotheca capit. It is impossible for any industry to
consider so many particulars in the infinite numbers of questions as are
necessary to be considered before we can with certainty determine any. And
after all the considerations which we can have in a whole age, we are not sure
not to be deceived. The obscurity of some questions, the nicety of some
articles, the intricacy of some revelations, the variety of humane
understandings, the windings of Logic, the tricks of adversaries, the
subtilty of Sophisters, the engagement of educations, personal affections, the
portentous number of writers, the infinity of authorities, the vastness of
some arguments, as consisting in enumeration of many particulars, the
uncertainty of others, the several degrees of probability, the difficulties of
Scripture, the invalidity of probation of tradition, the opposition of all
exterior arguments to each other, and their open contestation, the public
violence done to authors and records, the private arts and supplantings, the
falsifyings, the indefatigable industry of some men to abuse all
understandings, and all persuasions into their own opinions, these and
thousands more, even all the difficulty of things, and all the weaknesses of
man and all the arts of the Devil, have made it impossible for any man in so
great variety of matter not to be deceived. No man pretends to it but the Pope,
and no man is more deceived then he is in that very particular.

3. From hence proceeds a danger which is consequent to this proceeding, for if
we, who are so apt to be deceived, and so insecure Numb. 4.
in our resolution of questions disputable, should persecute a dis-agreeing
person, we are not sure we do not fight against God, for if his proposition be
true and persecuted, then, because all truth derives from God, this proceeding
is against God, and therefore this is not to be done upon Gamaliel's ground,
lest peradventure we be found to fight against God, of which because we can
have no security (at least) in this case, we have all the guilt of a doubtful
or an uncertain Conscience. For if there be no security in the thing as I have
largely proved, the Conscience in such cases is as uncertain as the question
is, and if it be not doubtful where it is uncertain, it is because the man is
not wise, but as confident as ignorant, the first without reason, and the
second without excuse. And it is very disproportionable for a man to persecute
another certainly, for a proposition, that if he were wise, he would know is
not certain, at least, the other person may innocently be uncertain of it. If
he be killed, he is certainly killed, but if he be called heretic, it is not
so certain that he is an heretic. It were good therefore, that proceedings
were according to evidence, and the rivers not swell over the banks, nor a
certain definitive sentence of death passed upon such persuasions which cannot
certainly be defined. And this argument is of so much the more force, because
we see that the greatest persecutions that ever have been, were against truth,
even against Christianity it self, and it was a prediction of our blessed
Savior, that persecution should be the lot of true believers: and if we
compute the experience of suffering Christendom, and the prediction, that
truth should suffer, with those few instances of suffering heretics, it is
odds, but persecution is on the wrong side, and that it is error and heresy,
that is, cruel and tyrannical, especially since the truth of Jesus Christ,
and of his Religion are so meek, so charitable, and so merciful: and we may
in this case, exactly use the words of S. Paul, But as then, he that was borne
after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the spirit; even so it is
now: and so it ever will be till Christ's second coming. Numb. 5.


4. Whoever persecutes a disagreeing person, arms all the Quo comperto illi in
nostram pemiciem licentiore audacia grassabuntur. S Aug. epist. ad Dona.

world against himself, and all pious people of his own persuasion, when the
scales of authority return to his adversary, and attest his contradictory; and
then, what can he urge for mercy for himself, or his party that shows none
to others? If he says, that he is to be spared because he believes true, but
the other was justly persecuted because he was in error, he is ridiculous. For
he is as confidently believed to be a heretic, as he believes his adversary
such, and whether he be or no, being the thing in question, of this he is not
to be his own judge, but he that has authority on his side, will be sure to
judge against him. So that, what either side can indifferently make use of, it
is good that neither would, because neither side can with reason sufficient do
it in prejudice of the other. If a man will say, that every man must take his
adventure, and if it happens authority to be with him, he will persecute his
adversaries, and if it turns against him he will bear it as well as he can,
and hope for a reward of Martyrdom, and innocent suffering; besides that this
is so equal to be said of all sides, and besides, that this is a way to make
an eternal disunion of hearts and charities, and that it will make
Christendom nothing but a shambles, and a perpetual butchery, and as fast as
men's wits grow wanton, or confident, or proud, or abused, so often there will
be new executions and massacres. Besides all this, it is most unreasonable and
unjust, as being contrariant to those Laws of Justice and Charity, whereby we
are bound with greater zeal to spare and preserve an innocent, then to
condemn a guilty person, and there is less malice and iniquity in sparing the
guilty, then in condemning the good. Because it is in the power of men to remit
a guilty person to divine judicature, and for diverse causes, not to use
severity, but in no case is it lawful, neither has God at all given to man a
power to condemn such persons as cannot be proved other than pious and
innocent. And therefore it is better, if it should so happen, that we should
spare the innocent person, and one that is actually deceived, then that upon
the turn of the wheel, the true believers should be destroyed.

And this very reason, he that had authority sufficient, and absolute to make
Laws, was pleased to urge as a reasonable inducement Numb. 6.
for the establishing of that Law which he made for the indemnity of erring
persons. It was in the parable of the tares mingled with the good seed in Agro
dominico the good seed (Christ himself being the interpreter) are the Children
of the Kingdom, the tares are the children of the wicked one, upon this comes
the precept, gather not the tares by themselves, but let them both grow
together till the harvest, that is, till the day of Judgment. This Parable
has been tortured infinitely to make it confess its meaning, but we shall
soon dispatch it. All the difficulty and variety of exposition is reducible to
these two questions; What is meant by [Gather not,] and what by [Tares.] That
is, what kind of sword is forbidden, and what kind of persons are to be
tolerated. The former is clear; for the spiritual sword is not forbidden to
be used to any sort of criminals, for that would destroy the power of
excommunication. The prohibition therefore lies against the use of the
temporal sword, in cutting off some persons. Who they are, is the next
difficulty. But by tares, or the children of the wicked one, are meant either
persons of ill lives, wicked persons only in re practica, or else another kind
of evil persons, men criminal or faulty in re intellectuali. One or other of
these two must be meant; a third I know not. But the former cannot be meant,
because it would destroy all bodies politic, which cannot consist without
laws, nor laws without a compulsory and a power of the sword, therefore if
criminalls were to be let alone till the day of Judgment, bodies politic
must stand or fall ad arbitrium impiorum, and nothing good could be protected,
not Innocence it self, nothing could be secure but violence and tyranny. It
follows then that since a kind of persons which are indeed faulty are to be
tolerated, it must be meant of persons faulty in another kind, in which the
Gospel had not in other places clearly established a power externally
compulsory, and therefore since in all actions practically criminal a power of
the sword is permitted, here where it is denied must mean a crime of another
kind, and by consequence errors intellectual, commonly called heresy. Numb. 7.


And after all this the reason there given confirms this Vide S. Chrysostom.

interpretation, for therefore it is forbidden to cut off these tares, lest we
also pull up the wheat with them, which is the sum of these two last
arguments. For because Heresy is of so nice consideration, and difficult
sentence, in thinking to root up heresies, Quest. in cap. 13 Mat. S. Cyprian.

mistakes destroy true doctrine, which although it be possible to be done in
all cases of practical question, by mistake, yet because external actions are
more discernable then inward speculations and opinions, innocent persons are
not so Theophyl. in 13. Matthew.
easily mistaken for the guilty, in actions criminal, as in matters of inward
persuasion. And upon that very reason Saint Martin was zealous to have procured
a revocation of a Commission granted to certain Tribunes to make enquiry in
Spain for sects and opinions; for under color of rooting out the
Priscilianists, there was much mischief done, and more likely to happen to the
Orthodox. For it happened then, as oftentimes since, Pallore potius and vest
quam fide haeretieus dijudicari solebat aliquando per Tribunos Maximi. They
were no good inquisitors of heretical pravity, so Sulpitius witnesses. But
secondly, the reason says, that therefore these persons are so to be permitted
as not to be persecuted, lest when a revolution of humane affairs sets
contrary opinions in the throne or chair, they who were persecuted before,
should now themselves become persecutors of others, and so at one time or
other, before or after, the wheat be rooted up, and the truth be persecuted.
But as these reasons confirm the Law, and this sense of it, so abstracting
from the Law, it is of it self concluding by an argument ab incommodo, and
that founded upon the Numb. 8.
principles of justice, and right reason, as I formerly alleged.

4. We are not only uncertain of finding out truths in matters disputable,
but we are certain that the best and ablest Illi in vos saeviant qui nesciunt

Doctors of Christendom have been actually deceived in matters of great
concernment, which thing is evident in all those instances of persons from
whose doctrines all sorts of Christians respectively take liberty to dissent.
The errors of Papias, Irenaeus, Lactantius, Justin Martyr in the Millenary
opinion, of Saint Cyprian, Firmilian, the Asian and African Fathers in the
question of Re-baptization, Saint Austin in his decretory and uncharitable
sentence against the unbaptized children of Christian parents, the Roman or the
Greek Doctors in the question of the procession of the holy Ghost, and in the
matter of images, are examples beyond exception. (...). Now if these great
personages had been persecuted or destroyed for their opinions, who should have
answered the invaluable loss the Church of God should have sustained in
missing so excellent, so exemplary, and so great lights? But then if these
persons erred, and by consequence, might have been destroyed, what should have
become of others whose understanding was lower, and their security less, their
errors more, and their danger greater? At this rate all men should have passed
through the fire, for who can escape, when Saint Cyprian and Saint Austin
cannot? Now to say these persons were not to be persecuted because although
they had errors, yet none condemned by the Church, at that time or before, is
to say nothing to the purpose, nor nothing that is true. Not true, because
Saint Cyprians S. August. Contr. Ep. Fund.
error was condemned by Pope Stephen, which in the present sense of the
prevailing party in the Church of Rome, is to be condemned by the Church. Not
to the purpose; because it is nothing else but to say that the Church did
tolerate their errors. For since those opinions were open and manifest to the
world, that the Church did not condemn them, it was either because those
opinions were by the Church not thought to be errors, or if they were, yet she
thought fit to tolerate the error and the erring person. And if she would do
so still, it would in most cases be better then now it is. And yet if the
Church had condemned them, it had not altered the case as to this question, for
either the persons upon the condemnation of their error should have been
persecuted or not. If not, why shall they now, against the instance and
precedent of those ages who were confessedly wise and pious, and whose practice
are often made to us arguments to follow? If yea, and that they had been
persecuted, it is the thing which this argument condemns, and the loss of the
Church had been invaluable in the losing or the provocation and temptation of
such rare personages: and the example and the rule of so ill consequence, that
all persons might upon the same ground have suffered, and though some had
escaped, yet no man could have any more security from punishment then from
error.

5. Either the disagreeing person is in error, or not, but a true believer; in
either of the cases to persecute him is extremely imprudent. Numb. 9
For if he be a true believer, then it is a clear case that we do open
violence to God, and his servants, and his truth. If he be in error, what
greater folly and stupidity then to give to error the glory of Martyrdom, and
the advantages which are accidentally consequent to a persecution? For as it
was true of the Martyrs Quoties morimur toties nascimur, and the increase of
their trouble was the increase of their confidence and the establishment of
their persuasions: so it is in all false opinions; for that an opinion is true
or false is extrinsecall or accidental to the consequents and advantages it
gets by being afflicted. And there is a popular pity that follows all persons
in misery, and that compassion breeds likeness of affections, and that very
often produces likeness of persuasion; and so much the rather, because there
arises a jealousy and pregnant suspicion that they who persecute an opinion
are destitute of sufficient arguments to confute it, and that the hangman is
the best disputant. For if those arguments which they have for their own
doctrine were a sufficient ground of confidence and persuasion, men would be
more willing to use those means arguments which are better complyances with
humane understanding, which more naturally do satisfy it, which are more
humane and Christian, then that way which satisfies none, which destroys many,
which provokes more, which makes all men jealous. To which add that those who
dye for their opinion, leave in all men, great arguments of the heartinesse of
their belief, of the confidence of their persuasion, of the piety and
innocence of their persons, of the purity of their intention and simplicity of
purposes; that they are persons totally disinterest, and separate from design.
For no interest can be so great as to be put in balance against a man's life and
his soul, and he does very imprudently serve his ends who seeingly and
fore-knowingly loses his life in the prosecution of them. Just as if Titius
should offer to dye for Sempronius upon condition he might receive twenty
talents when he had done his work. It is certainly an argument of a great love,
and a great confidence, and a great sincerity, and a great hope when a man
lays down his life in attestation of a proposition. Greater love then this
has no man, then to lay down his life, says our Blessed Savior. And
although laying of a wager is an argument of confidence more then truth, yet
laying such a wager, staking of a man's Soul, and pawning his life gives a
hearty testimony that the person is honest, confident, resigned, Charitable and
Noble. And I know not whether truth can do a person or a cause more
advantages, then these can do to an error. And therefore besides the impiety,
there is great imprudence in Canonizing a heretic, and consecrating an error
by such means, which were better preserved as encouragements of truth, and
comforts to real and true Martyrs. And it is not amiss to observe that this
very advantage was taken by heretics who were ready to show and boast their
Catalogues of Martyrs, in particular the Circumcellians did so, and the
Donatists, and yet the first were heretics, the second Schismatics. And it
was remarkable in the Scholars of Priscillian, who, as they had their Master
in the reputation of a Saint while he was living, so when he was dead, they had
him in veneration as a Martyr; they with reverence and devotion carried his,
and the bodies of his slain companions to an honorable sepulture, and counted
it Religion to swear by the name of Priscillian. So that the extinguishing of
the person, gives life and credit to his doctrine, and when he is dead he yet
speaks more effectually.

6. It is unnatural and unreasonable to persecute disagreeing opinions.
Unnatural; for Understanding being a thing wholly Numb. 10.
spiritual, cannot be restrained, and therefore neither punished by corporal
afflictions. It is in aliena republica, a matter of another world; you may as
well cure the colic by brushing a man's clothes, or fill a man's belly with a
syllogism: these things do not communicate in matter, and therefore neither
in action nor passion; and since all punishments in a prudent government punish
the offender to prevent a future crime, and so it proves more medicinal then
vindictive, the punitive act being in order to the cure and prevention: and
since no punishment of the body can cure a disease in the soul, it is
disproportionable in nature, and in all civil government, to punish where the
punishment can do no good. It may be an act of tyranny, but never of justice.
For is an opinion ever the more true or false for being persecuted? Some men
have believed it the more, as being provoked into a confidence, and vexed into
a resolution, but the thing it self is not the truer, and though the hangman
may confute a man with an inexplicable dilemma, yet not convince his
understanding, for such premises can infer no conclusion, but that of a man's
life: and a Wolf may as well give laws to the understanding, as he whose
dictates are only propounded in violence, and writ in blood. And a dog is as
capable of a law as a man, if there be no choice in his obedience, nor
discourse in his choice, nor reason to satisfy his discourse. And as it is
unnatural, so it is unreasonable, that Sempronius should force Caius to be of
his opinion, because Sempronius is Consul this year, and commands the Lictors:
As if he that can kill a man cannot but be infallible: and if he be not, why
should I do violence to my conscience, because he can do violence to my
person?

7. Force in matters of opinion can do no good, but is very Numb. 11.
apt to do hurt; for no man can change his opinion when he will, or be
satisfied in his reason that his opinion is false, because discountenanced. If
a man could change his opinion when he lists, he might cure many inconveniences
of his life: all his fears and his sorrows would soon disband, if he would
but alter his opinion, whereby he is persuaded, that such an accident that
afflicts him is an evil, and such an object formidable; let him but believe
himself impregnable, or that he receives a benefit when he is plundered,
disgraced, imprisoned, condemned, and afflicted, neither his sleeps need to be
disturbed, nor his quietness discomposed. But if a man cannot change his
opinion when helists, nor ever does heartily or resolutely but when he cannot
do otherwise, then to use force, may make him an hypocrite, but never to be a
right believer, and so instead of erecting a trophee to God and true Religion,
we build a Monument for the Devil. Infinite examples are recorded in Church
story to this very purpose: But Socrates instances in one for all; for when
Eleusius Bishop of Cyzicum was threatened by the Emperor Ualens with banishment
and confiscation, if he did not subscribe to the decree of Ariminum, at last he
yielded to the Arrian opinion, and presently fell into great torment of
Conscience, openly at Cyzicum recanted the error, asked God and the Church
forgiveness, and complained of the Emperors injustice, and that was all the
good the Arrian party got by offering violence to his Conscience. And so many
families in Spain which are as they call them new Christians, and of a
suspected faith, into which they were forced by the tyranny of the
Inquisition, and yet are secret Moors, is evidence enough, of the Ejusmodi
fuit Hipponensium conversio, cujus quidem species decepit August. ita ut
opinaretur haereticos licet non morte trucidandos vi tamen coercendos.
Experientiaenim demonstravit eos tam facile ad Arianismum transiisse atque ad
Cathelicismum, cum Arriani Principes rerum in ed civitate petirentur.
inconvenience of preaching a doctrine in ore gladii cruentandi. For it either
punishes a man for keeping a good conscience, or forces him into a bad; it
either punishes sincerity, or persuades hypocrisy; it persecutes a truth, or
drives into error: and it teaches a man to dissemble and to be safe, but never
to be honest.

8. It is one of the glories of Christian Religion, that it was so pious,
excellent, miraculous and petswasive, that it came in upon its own piety and
wisdom, with no other force but a torrent Numb. 12.
of arguments and demonstration of the Spirit; a mighty rushing wind to beat
down all strong holds, and every high thought and imagination; but toward the
persons of men it was always full of meekness and charity, compliance and
toleration, condescension and bearing with one another, restoring persons
overtaken with an error, in the spirit of meekness, considering lest we also
be tempted. The consideration is as prudent, and the proposition as just as the
precept is charitable, and the precedent was pious and holy. Now things are
best conserved with that which gives it the first being, and which is agreeable
to its temper and constitution. That precept which it chiefly preaches in order
to all the blessedness in the world, that is, of meekness, mercy and charity,
should also preserve it self and promote its own interest. For indeed nothing
will do it so well, nothing does so excellently insinuate it self into the
understandings and affections of men, as when the actions and persuasions of a
sect, and every part and principle and promotion are univocall. And it would be
a mighty disparagement to so glorious an institution, that in its principle it
should be merciful and humane, and in the promotion and propagation of it so
inhumane: And it would be improbable and unreasonable that the sword should be
used in the persuasion of one proposition, and yet in the persuasion of the
whole Religion nothing like it. To do so, may serve the end of a temporal
Prince, but never promote the honor of Christ's Kingdom; it may secure a
design of Spain, but will very much disserve Christendom, to offer to
support it by that which good men believe to be a distinctive cognizance of the
Mahumetan Religion, from the excellency and piety of Christianity, whose sense
and spirit is described in those excellent words of S. Paul, 2 Timothy 2. 24. The
servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, in meekness
instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them
repentance to the acknowledging the truth. They that oppose themselves, must
not be stricken by any of Gods servants; and if yet any man will smite these
who are his opposites in opinion, he will get nothing by that, he must quit the
title of being a servant of God for his pains. And I think a distinction of
persons Secular and Ecclesiastical will do no advantage for an escape,
because even the Secular power if it be Christian, and a servant of God must
not be (...), I mean in those cases where meekness of instruction is the
remedy, or if the case be irremediable, abscission by Censures is the penalty.

9. And if yet in the nature of the thing it were neither unjust Numb. 13.
nor unreasonable, yet there is nothing under God Almighty that has power over
the soul of man, so as to command a persuasion, or to judge a disagreeing:
Humane positive Laws direct all external acts in order to several ends, and
the Judges take cognizance accordingly, but no man can command the will, or
punish him, that obeys the Law against his will: for because its end is served
in external obedience, it neither looks after more, neither can it be served
by more, nor take notice of any more. And yet possibly the understanding is
less subject to humane power then the will, for that humane power has a
command over external acts which naturally and regularly flow from the will,
and ut plurimum suppose a direct act of will, but always either a direct or
indirect volition, primary or accidental; but the understanding is a natural
faculty subject to no command, but where the command is it self a reason fit
to satisfy and persuade it. And therefore God commanding us to believe such
revelations, persuades and satisfies the understanding, by his commanding and
revealing: for there is no greater probation in the world that a proposition is
true, then because God has commanded us to believe it. But because no man's
command is a satisfaction to the understanding, or a verification of the
proposition, therefore the understanding is not subject to humane authority.
They may persuade, but not enjoyne where God has not; and where God has, if
it appears so to him, he is an Infidel if he does not believe it. And if all
men have no other efficacy or authority on the understanding but by
persuasion, proposal and entreaty, then a man is bound to assent but according
to the operation of the argument, and the energie of persuasion, neither indeed
can he, though he would never so feign, and he that out of fear and too much
compliance and desire to be safe, shall desire to bring his understanding with
some luxation to the belief of humane dictates and authorities, may as often
miss of the truth as hit it, but is sure always to lose the comfort of truth,
because he believes it upon indirect, insufficient, and incompetent arguments:
and as his desire it should be so is his best argument that it is so, so the
pleasing of men is his best reward, and his not being condemned and
contradicted all the possession of a truth.

SECT. XIIII.
Of the practice of Christian Churches toward persons disagreeing, and when
persecution first came in.

ANd thus this truth has been practiced in all times of Christian Religion,
when there were no collateral designs on foot, nor interests to be served,
nor passions to be satisfied. In S. Paul's time, though the censure of heresy
were not so loose and forward as afterward, and all that were called
Heretics were clearly such, and highly criminal; yet as their crime was, so
was, their censure, that is, spiritual. They were first admonished, once at
least, for so l. 3. cap. 3.
Irenaeus, de prescript.
Tertullian, lib. ad Quirinum.
Cyprian, in hunc locum.
Ambrose, and ibidem.
Hierome read that place of Titus 3. But since that time all men, and at that
time some read it, Post unam and alteram admonitionem, reject a Heretic.
Rejection from the communion of Saints after two warnings, that is the penalty.
Saint John expresses it by not eating with them, not bidding them God speed,
but the persons against whom he decrees so severely, are such as denied Christ
to become in the flesh, direct Antichrists: and let the sentence be as high as
it lists in this case, all that I observe is, that since in so damnable
doctrines nothing but spiritual censure, separation from the communion of the
faithful was enjoined and prescribed, we cannot pretend to an Apostolical
precedent, if in matters of dispute and innocent question, and of great
uncertainty and no malignity we should proceed to sentence of death.

For it is but an absurd and illiterate arguing, to say that excommunication is
a greater punishment, and killing, a less; and therefore Numb. 2.
whoever may be excommunicated may also be put to death (which indeed is the
reasoning that Bellarmine uses) for first, excommunication is not directly, and
of it self a greater punishment then corporal death. Because it is indefinite,
and incomplete, and in order to a further punishment, which if it happens, then
the excommunication was the inlet to it, if it does not, the excommunication
did not signify half so much as the loss of a member, much less, death. For
it may be totally ineffectuall, either by the iniquity of the proceeding, or
repentance of the person: and in all times and cases it is a medicine if the
man please; if he will not, but perseveres in his impiety, then it is himself
that brings the Censure to effect, that actuates the judgment and gives a
sting, and an energy upon that which otherwise would be (...). Secondly, but
when it is at worst, it does not kill the Soul, it only consignes it to that
death which it had deserved, and should have received independently from that
sentence of the Church. Thirdly, and yet excommunication is to admirable
purpose; for whether it referres to the person censured or to others, it is
prudentiall in it self, it is exemplary to others, it is medicinal to all.
For the person censured, is by this means threatened into piety, and the
threatening made the more energeticall upon him because by fiction of Law, or as
it were by a Sacramental representment the pains of hell are made presentiall
to him; and so becomes an act of prudent judicature, and excellent discipline,
and the best instrument of spiritual Government: Because the nearer the
threatening is reduced to matter, and the more present and circumstantionable it
is made, the more operative it is upon our spirits while they are immerged in
matter. And this is the full sense and power of excommunication in its direct
intention: consequently and accidentally other evils might follow it, as in
the times of the Apostles, the censured persons were buffeted by Satan, and
even at this day there is less security even to the temporal condition of
such a person whom his spiritual parents have Anathematized. But besides this,
I know no warrant to affirm any thing of excommunication, for the sentence of
the Church does but declare, not effect the final sentence of damnation.
Whoever deserves excommunication deserves damnation; and he that repents shall
be saved, though he dye out of the Churches external Communion, and if he does
not repent, he shall be damned though he was not excommunicate.

But suppose it greater then the sentence of corporal death, yet Numb. 3.
it follows not, because heretics may be excommunicate, therefore killed, for
from a greater to a less, in a several kind of things the argument concludes
not. It is a greater thing to make an excellent discourse then to make a shoe,
yet he that can do the greater cannot do this less. An Angel cannot beget a
man, and yet he can do a greater matter in that kind of operations which we
term spiritual and Angelical. And if this were concluding that whoever may
be excommunicate may be killed, then, because of excommunications the Church is
confessed the sole and entire Judge, she is also an absolute disposer of the
lives of persons. I believe this will be but ill doctrine in Spain: for in
Bulla Coenae Domini the King of Spain is every year excommunicated on Maunday
Thursday; but if by the same power he might also be put to death (as upon this
ground he may) the Pope might with more ease be invested in that part of S.
Peter's patrimony which that King has invaded and surpised. But besides this,
it were extreme harsh Doctrine in a Roman Consistory, from whence
excommunications issue for trifles, for fees, for not suffering themselves
infinitely to be oppressed, for any thing; if this be greater then death, how
great a tyranny is that which does more then kill men for less then trifles,
or else how inconsequent is that argument which concludes its purpose upon so
false pretense and supposition?

Well, however zealous the Apostles were against heretics, yet none were by
them, or their dictates put to death. The death of Numb. 4.
Ananias and Saphira, and the blindness of Elymas the Sorcerer amount not to
this, for they were miraculous inflictions: and the first was a punishment to
Vow-breach and Sacrilege, the second of Sorcery, and open contestation against
the Religion of Jesus Christ; neither of them concerned the case of this
present question: or if the case were the same, yet the authority is not the
same: For he that inflicted these punishments was infallible, and of a power
competent: But no man at this day is so. But as yet, people were converted by
Miracles, and Preaching, and Disputing, and Heretics by the same means were
redargued, and all men instructed, none tortured for their opinion. And this
continued till Christian people were vexed by disagreeing persons, and were
impatient and peevish, by their own too much confidence and the luxuriancy of
a prosperous fortune: but then they would not endure persons that did dogmatize
any thing which might entrench upon their reputation or their interest. And it
is observable that no man, nor no age did ever teach the lawfullnesse of
putting heretics to death, till they grew wanton with prosperity. But when the
reputation of the Governors was concerned, when the interests of men were
endangered, when they had something to lose, when they had built their
estimation upon the credit of disputable questions, when they began to be
jealous of other men, when they over-valued themselves and their own opinions,
when some persons invaded Bishoprics upon pretense of new opinions, then they
as they thrived in the favor of Emperors, and in the success of their
disputes, solicited the temporal power to banish, to fine, to imprison, and
to kill their adversaries.

So that the case stands thus. In the best times, amongst the Numb. 5.
best men, when there were fewer temporal ends to be served, when Religion and
the pure and simple designs of Christianity were only to be promoted; in
those times and amongst such men, no persecution was actual, nor persuaded nor
allowed toward disagreeing persons. But as men had ends of their own and not
of Christ's, as they receded from their duty, and Religion from its purity, as
Christ anity began to be compounded with interests, and blended with temporal
designs, so men were persecuted for their opinions. This is most apparent, if
we consider when persecution first came in, and if we observe how it was
checked by the holiest and the wisest persons.

The first great instance I shall note was in Priscillian and his Numb. 6.
followers, who were condemned to death by the Tyrant Maximus. Which instance
although S. Hierom observes as a punishment, and judgment for the crime of
heresy, yet is of no use in the present question, because Maximus put some
Christians of all sorts to death promiscuously, Catholic and Heretic without
choice, and therefore the Priscilianists might as well have called it a
judgment upon the Catholics, as the Catholics upon them.

But when Ursatus and Stacius, two Bishops, procured the Priscilianists death
by the power they had at Court: S. Martin Numb. 7.
was so angry at them for their cruelty, that he excommunicated them both. And
S. Ambrose upon the same stock denied his communion to the Itaciani. And the
account that Sulpitius gives of the story is this, Hoc modo (says he) homines
luce indignissimi pessimo exemplo necati sunt. The example was worse then the
men. If the men were heretical, the execution of them however was unchristian.

But it was of more authority that the Nicene Fathers supplicated Numb. 8.
the Emperor, and prevailed for the banishment of Arius, Sozom. l. 1. c. 20
of this we can give no other account, but that by the history of the time we
see baseness enough, and personal misdemeanour, Socrat. l. 1. c. 26 Cont.
Crescon. Grammat. lib. 3. c. 50. vide etiam Epist. 61. ad dulcilium. et Epist.
158. et 159. et lib. 1. c. 29. cont. tit. petilian. vide etiam Socrat. li. 3.
c. 3, et c. 29.
and factiousnesse of spirit in Arius, to have deserved worse then banishment,
though the obliquity of his opinion were not put into the balance; which we
have reason to believe was not so much as considered, because Constantine gave
toleration to differing opinions, and Arius himself was restored upon such
conditions to his country and office, which would not stand with the ends of
the Catholics, if they had been severe exactors of concurrence and union of
persuasions.

I am still within the scene of Ecclesiastical persons, and am considering
what the opinion of the learnedest and the holiest prelates were concerning
this great question. If we will believe Lib. 2. Cap. 5. retractat. vide Epist.
48. ad vincent. script. post. retract. et Epist. 50. ad Bonifac.
Saint Austin (who was a credible person) no good man did allow it. Nullis
tamen bonis in Catholica hoc placet, si usque ad mortem in quenquam licet
haereticum saeviatur. This was S. Austins final opinion; For he had first been
of the mind that it was not honest to do any violence to mis-perswaded
persons; and when upon an accident happening in Hippo he had altered and
retracted that part of the opinion, yet then also he excepted death, and would
by no means have any mere opinion made capital. But for ought appears, S.
Austin had greater reason to have retracted that retractation, then his first
opinion. For his saying of nullis bonis placet was as true as the thing was
reasonable it should be so. Witness those known testimonies of ad S capula^.

Against this concurrent testimony my reading can furnish me with no
adversary, nor contrary instances, but in Attious of C. P. Theodosius of
Synada, in Stacius and Ursaeus before reckoned. Only indeed some of the later
Popes of Rome began to be busy and unmercifull, but it was then when
themselves were secure, and their interests great, and their temporal
concernments highly considerable.

For it is most true, and not amiss to observe it, that no man who was under
the ferula did ever think it lawful to have opinions Numb. 11.
forced, or heretics put to death, and yet many men who themselves have
escaped the danger of a pile and a faggot, have changed their opinion just as
the case was altered, that is, as themselves were unconcerned in the suffering.

themselves the Church. And there were some Divines in the Lower Germany, who
upon great reasons spoke against the tyranny of the Inquisition, and
restraining Prophesying, who yet when they had shaked off the Spanish yoke,
began to persecute their Brethren. It was unjust in them, in all men
unreasonable and uncharitable, and often increases the error, but never lessens
the danger.

But yet although the Church, I mean, in her distinct and Clericall capacity,
was against destroying or punishing difference in opinion, Numb. 12.
till the Popes of Rome did super-seminate and persuade the contrary, yet the
Bishops did persuade the Emperors to make Laws against Heretics, and to
punish disobedient persons with fines, with imprisonment, with death and
banishment respectively. This indeed calls us to a new account. For the
Churchmen might not proceed to blood nor corporal inflictions, but might they
not deliver over to the Secular arm, and persuade Temporal Princes to do it?
For this, I am to say, that since it is notorious that the doctrine of the
Clergy was against punishing Heretics, the Laws which were made by the
Emperors against them might be for restraint of differing Religion in order to
the preservation of the public peace, which is too frequently violated by the
division of opinions. But I am not certain whether that was always the
reason, or whether or no some Bishops of the Court did not also serve their
own ends in giving their Princes such untoward counsel; but we find the Laws
made severally to several purposes, in diverse cases and with different
severity. Constantine the Emperor made a Sanction, Ut parem cum fidelibus Apud
Eusebius. de vita Constant.
ii qui errant pacis and quietis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant. The Emperor
Gratian decreed, Ut quam quisque vellet religionem sequeretur; and conventus
Ecclesiasticos semoto metu omnes agerent. But he excepted the Manichees, the
Photinians, and Eunomians. Theodosius the elder made a law of death against the
Anabaptists of his time, and banished Eunomius, and against other erring
persons vide Socrat. l 7. c. 12.
appointed a pecuniary mulct; but he did no executions so severe as his
sanctions, to show they were made in terrorem only. Vid. Cod. de heretic. L.
manichees. and leg. Arriani, and l. Quicunque.
So were the Laws of Valentinian and Martian, decreeing contra omnes qui prava
docere tenent, that they should be put to death; so did Apud Paulum Diac. l.
16. and l. 24.
Michael the Emperor, but Justinian only decreed banishment.

But what ever whispers some Politiques might make to their Princes, as the
wisest and holiest did not think it lawful for Churchmen alone to do
executions, so neither did they transmit such Numb. 11.
persons to the Secular Judicature. And therefore when the Edict of Macedonius
the President was so ambiguous, that it seemed to threaten death to Heretics,
unless they recanted; S. Austin admonished him carefully to provide that no
Heretic should be put to death, alleging it also not only to be
unchristian, but illegal also, and not warranted by imperial constitutions;
for before his time no Laws were made for their being put to death: but
however he prevailed, that Macedonius published another Edict, more explicit,
and less seemingly severe. But in his Epistle to Donatus, the African
Proconsul, he is more confident and determinate, Necessitate nobis impacta and
indicta, ut potius occidi ab eis eligamus, quam eos occidendos vestris judiciis
ingeramus.

But afterward many got a trick of giving them over to the Secular power,
which at the best is no better then hypocrisy, removing Numb. 12.
envy from themselves, and laying it upon others, a refusing to do that in
external act, which they do in council and approbation: which is a
transmitting the act to another, and retaining a proportion of guilt unto
themselves, even their own and the others too. I end this with the saying of
Chrysostom, Dogmuta Serw. de Anathemate.
impia and quae ab haereticis profecta sunt arguere and anathematizare oportet,
hominibus autem parcendum and pro salute eorum candum.

SECT. XV.
How far the Church or Governors may act to the restraining false or
differing opinions.

BUt although Heretical persons are not to be destroyed, yet heresy being a
work of the flesh, and all heretics criminal persons, whose acts and doctrine
have influence upon Communities of men whether Ecclesiastical or civil, the
governors of the Republique, or Church respectively are to do their duties in
restraining those mischiefs which may happen to their several charges, for
whose indemnity they are answerable. And therefore according to the effect or
malice of the doctrine or the person, so the cognizance of them belongs to
several judicatures. If it be false doctrine in any capacity and does
mischief in any sense, or teaches ill life in any instance, or incourages
evil in any particular, (...), these men must be silenced, they must be
convinced by sound doctrine, and put to silence by spiritual evidence, and
restrained by authority Ecclesiastical, that is, by spiritual censures
according as it seems necessary to him who is most concerned in the regiment
of the Church. For all this we have precept and precedent Apostolical, and
much reason. For by thus doing, the governor of the Church uses all that
authority that is competent, and all the means that is reasonable, and that
proceeding which is regular, that he may discharge his cure and secure his
flock. And that he possibly may be deceived in judging a doctrine to be
heretical, and by consequence the person excommunicate suffers injury, is no
argument against the reasonableness of the proceeding. For all the injury that
is, is visible and in appearance, and so is his crime. Judges must judge
according to their best reason guided by law of God as their rule, and by
evidence and appearance as their best instrument, and they can judge no better.
If the Judges be good and prudent, the error of proceeding will not be great,
nor ordinary, and there can be no better establishment of humane judicature,
then is a fallible proceeding upon an infallible ground; And if the judgment
of heresy be made by estimate and proportion of the opinion to a good or a bad
life respectively, supposing an error in the deduction, there will be no malice
in the conclusion; and that he endeavors to secure piety according to the best
of his understanding, and yet did mistake in his proceeding, is only an
argument that he did his duty after the manner of men, possibly with the piety
of a Saint, though not with the understanding of an Angel. And the little
inconvenience that happens to the person injuriously judged is abundantly made
up in the excellency of the Discipline, the goodness of the example, the care
of the public, and all those great influences into the manners of men which
derive from such an act so publicly consigned. But such public judgment in
matters of opinion must be seldom and curious, and never but to secure piety,
and a holy life; for in matters speculative, as all determinations are
fallible, so scarce any of them are to purpose, nor ever able to make
compensation of either side, either for the public fraction, or the particular
injustice if it should so happen in the censure.

But then as the Church may proceed thus far, yet no Christian man, or
Community of men may proceed farther. For if they Numb. 2.
be deceived in their judgment and censure, and yet have passed only
spiritual censures, they are totally ineffectuall, and come to nothing, there
is no effect remaining upon the soul, and such censures are not to meddle with
the body so much as indirectly. But if any other judgment pass upon persons
erring, such judgments whose effects remain, if the person be unjustly
censured nothing will answer and make compensation for such injuries. If a
person be excommunicate unjustly, it will do him no hurt, but if he be killed
or dismembered unjustly, that censure and infliction is not made ineffectuall by
his innocence, he is certainly killed and dismembered. So that as the Churches
authority in such cases so restrained and made prudent, cautelous, and orderly,
is just and competent: so the proceeding is reasonable, it is provident for the
public, and the inconveniences that may fall upon particulars so little, as
that the public benefit makes ample compensation, so long as the proceeding
is but spiritual.

This discourse is in the case of such opinions, which by the former rules are
formal heresies, and upon practical inconveniences. Numb. 3.
But for matters of question which have not in them an enmity to the public
tranquillity, as the Republique has nothing to do, upon the ground of all the
former discourses; so if the Church meddles with them where they do not derive
into ill life, either in the person or in the consequent, or else are
destructions of the foundation of Religion, which is all one, for that those
fundamental articles are of greatest necessity in order to a virtuous and
godly life, which is wholly built upon them, (and therefore are principally
necessary) If she meddles further, otherwise then by preaching, and conferring,
and exhortation, she becomes tyrannical in her government, makes her self an
immediate judge of consciences and persuasions, lords it over their faith,
destroys unity, and charity; and as if he that dogmatizes the opinion becomes
criminal, if he troubles the Church with an immodest, peevish, and
pertinacious proposal of his article, not simply necessary; so the Church does
not do her duty, if she so condemns it pro tribunali as to enjoyne him and
all her subjects to believe the contrary. And as there may be pertinacy in
doctrine, so there may be pertinacy in judging, and both are faults. The peace
of the Church and the unity of her doctrine is best conserved when it is judged
by the proportion it has to that rule of unity which the Apostles gave, that
is the Creed for Articles of mere belief, and the precepts of Jesus Christ,
and the practical rules of piety, which are most plain and easy, and without
controversy, set down in the Gospels, and Writings of the Apostles. But to
multiply articles, and adopt them into the family of the faith, and to require
assent to such articles which (as S. Paul's phrase is) are of doubtful
disputation, equal to that assent we give to matters of faith, is to build a
Tower upon the top of a Bulrush, and the further the effect of such proceedings
does extend, the worse they are; the very making such a Law is unreasonable,
the inflicting spiritual censures upon them that cannot do so much violence
to their understanding as to obey it, is unjust and ineffectuall; but to punish
the person with death, or with corporal infliction, indeed it is effectual,
but it is therefore tyrannical. We have seen what the Church may do toward
restraining false or differing opinions, next I shall consider by way of
Corollarie what the Prince may do as for his interest, and only in securing
his people, and serving the ends of true Religion.

SECT. XVI.
Whether it be lawful for a Prince to give toleration to several Religions.

FOr upon these very grounds we may easily give account of Numb. 1.
that great question, Whether it be lawful for a Prince to give toleration to
several Religions.

For first, it is a great fault that men will call the several sects of
Christians by the names of several Religions. The Religion of JESUS CHRIST is
the form of sound doctrine and wholesome words, which is set down in Scripture
indefinitely, actually conveyed to us by plain places, and separated as for
the question of necessary or not necessary by the Symbol of the Apostles. Those
impertinencies which the wantonness and vanity of men has commenced, which
their interests have promoted, which serve not truth so much as their own ends,
are far from being distinct Religions; for matters of opinion are no parts of
the worship of God, nor in order to it, but as they promote obedience to his
Commandments; and when they contribute toward it, are in that proportion as
they contribute parts and actions, and minute particulars of that Religion to
whose end they do, or pretend to serve. And such are all the sects and all the
pretenses of Christians, but pieces and minutes of Christianity, if they do
serve the great end, as every man for his own sect and interest believes for
his share it does.

2. Tolleration has a double sense or purpose, for sometimes by it men
understand a public license and exercise of a sect: Sometimes it is only an
indemnity of the persons privately to convene and to opine as they see cause,
and as they mean to answer to God. Both these are very much to the same
purpose, unless some persons whom we are bound to satisfy be scandalized, and
then the Prince is bound to do as he is bound to satisfy. To God it is all
one. For abstracting from the offense of persons, which is to be considered
just as our obligation is to content the persons, it is all one whether we
indulge to them to meet publicly or privately, to do actions of Religion
concerning which we are not persuaded that they are truly holy. To God it is
just one to be in the dark and in the light, the thing is the same, only the
Circumstance of public and private is different, which cannot be concerned in
any thing, nor can it concern any thing but the matter of Scandal and
relation to the minds and fantasies of certain persons.

3. So that to tolerate is not to persecute. And the question Numb. 3.
whether the Prince may tolerate diverse persuasions, is no more then whether
he may lawfully persecute any man for not being of his opinion. Now in this
case he is just so to tolerate diversity of persuasions as he is to tolerate
public actions, for no opinion is judicable, nor no person punishable, but for
a sin, and if his opinion by reason of its managing, or its effect, be a sin
in it self, or becomes a sin to the person, then as he is to do toward
other sins, so to that opinion or man so opining. But to believe so, or not
so, when there is no more but mere believing, is not in his power to enjoyne,
therefore not to punish. And it is not only lawful to tolerate disagreeing
persuasions, but the authority of God only is competent to take notice of it,
and infallible to determine it, and fit to judge, and therefore no humane
authority is sufficient to do all those things which can justify the
inflicting temporal punishments upon such as do not conform in their
persuasions to a rule or authority which is not only fallible, but supposed by
the disagreeing person to be actually deceived.

But I consider that in the toleration of a different opinion, Numb. 4.
Religion is not properly and immediately concerned, so as in any degree to be
endangered. For it may be safe in diversity of persuasions, and it also a part
of Christian Humani iuris and naturalis peteslatis, unicuique quod putaverit,
colere Sed nec religionis est cogere religionem, quae suscipi sponte debet, non
vi. Tertul. ad Scapulam.
Religion that the liberty of men's Consciences should be preserved in all
things, where God has not set a limit and made a restraint; that the soul of
man should be free, and acknowledge no master but Jesus Christ; that matters
spiritual should not be restrained by purishments corporal; that the same
meekness and charity should be preserved in the promotion of Christianity,
that gave it foundation and increment, and firmness in its first publication;
that conclusions should not be more dogmaticall then the vertuall resolution
and efficacy of the premises: And that the persons should not more certainly be
condemned then their opinions confuted; and lastly, that the infirmities of men
and difficulties of things should be both put in balance to make abatement in
the definitive sentence against men's persons. But then because tolleration of
opinions is not properly a question of Religion, it may be a question of
policy: And although a man may be a good Christian, though he believe an error
not fundamental, and not directly or evidently impious, yet his opinion may
accidentally disturb the public peace through the over-activenesse of the
person, and the confidence of their belief and the opinion of its appendant
necessity, and therefore tolleration of differing persuasions in these cases is
to be considered upon political grounds, and is just so to be admitted or
denied as the opinions or tolleration of them may consist with the public and
necessary ends of Government. Only this: As Christian Princes must look to
the interest of their Government, so especially must they consider the
interests of Christianity, and not call every redargution or modest discovery
of an established error, by the name of disturbance of the peace. For it is
very likely that the peevishness and impatience of contradiction in the
Governors may break the peace. Let them remembut the gentleness of
Christianity, the Liberty of Consciences which ought to be preserved, and let
them do justice to the persons, whoever they are that are peevish, provided no
man's person be overborn with prejudice. For if it be necessary for all men to
subscribe to the present established Religion, by the same reason at another
time a man may be bound to subscribe to the contradictory, and so to all
Religions in the world. And they only, who by their too much confidence entitle
God to all their fancies, and make them to be questions of Religion, and
evidences for Heaven, or consignations to Hell, they only think this doctrine
unreasonable, and they are the men that first disturb the Churches peace, and
then think there is no appeasing the tumult but by getting the victory. But
they that consider things wisely, understand that since salvation and damnation
depend not upon impertinencies, and yet that public peace and tranquillity
may, the Prince is in this case to seek how to secure Government, and the
issues and intentions of that, while there is in these cases directly no
insecurity to Religion, unless by the accidental uncharitableness of them
that dispute: Which uncharitableness is also much prevented when the public
peace is secured, and no person is on either side engaged upon Dextera
praecipue capit indulgentia mentes, A^peritas oditi saevaque bella parit.
revenge, or troubled with disgrace, or vexed with punishments by any decretory
sentence against him. It was the saying of a wise statesman (I mean Thuanus)
Haeretici qui pace data factionibus scinduntur, persecutione uniuntur contra
Remp. If you persecute heretics or discrepants, they unite themselves as to a
common defense: If you permit them, they divide themselves upon private
interest, and the rather, if this interest was an ingredient of the opinion.

The Sum is this, it concerns the duty of a Prince because it concerns the
Honor of God, that all vices and every part of Numb. 5.
ill life be discountenanced and restrained: And therefore in relation to that,
opinions are to be dealt with. For the understanding being to direct the will,
and opinions to guide our practices, they are considerable only as they teach
impiety and vice, as they either dishonor God or disobey him. Now all such
doctrines are to be condemned; but for the persons preaching such Doctrines, if
they neither justify nor approve the pretended Consequences which are
certainly impious, they are to be separated from that consideration. But if
they know such consequences and allow them, or if they do not stay till the
doctrines produce impiety, but take sin before hand, and manage them
impiously in any sense; or if either themselves or their doctrine do really
and without color or fained pretext, disturb the public peace Extat prudens

and just interests, they are not to be suffered. In all other cases it is not
only lawful to permit them, but it is also necessary, that Princes and all in
authority should not persecute discrepant opinions. And in such cases wherein
persons not otherwise incompetent are bound to reprove an error, (as they are
in many) in all these if the Prince makes restraint, he hinders men from doing
their duty, and from obeying the Laws of JESUS CHRIST.

SECT. XVII.
Of compliance with disagreeing persons or weak constiences in general.

Upon these grounds it remains that we reduce this doctrine Numb. 1.
to practical Conclusions, and consider among the differing sects and opinions
which trouble these parts of Christendom, and come into our concernment, which
sects of Christians are to be tolerated, and how far? and which are to be
restrained and punished in their several proportions?

The first consideration is, that since diversity of opinions does Numb. 2.
more concern public peace then religion, what is to be done to persons who
disobey a public sanction upon a true allegation; that they cannot believe it
to be lawful to obey such constitutions, although they dis-believe them upon
insufficient grounds, that is, whether in constituta lege disagreeing persons
or weak consciences are to be complied withal, and their disobeying and
disagreeing tolerated?

1. In this question there is no distinction can be made between Numb. 3.
persons truly weak, and but pretending so. For all that pretend to it, are
to be allowed the same liberty whatsoever it be; for no man's spirit is known
to any, but to God and himself: and therefore pretenses and realityes in this
case, are both alike in order to the public toleration. And this very thing is
one argument to persuade a Negative. For the chief thing in this case is the
concernment of public government, which is then most of all violated, when
what may prudently be permitted to some purposes, may be demanded to many more,
and the piety of the Laws abused to the impiety of other men's ends. And if
laws be made so malleable, as to comply with weak consciences, he that has a
mind to disobey, is made impregnable against the coercitive power of the Law by
this pretense. For a weak conscience signifyes nothing in this case, but a
dislike of the Law upon a contrary persuasion. For if some weak consciences do
obey the law, and others do not, it is not their weakness indefinitely that
is the cause of it, but a definite and particular persuasion to the contrary.
So that if such a pretense be excuse sufficient from obeying, then the law is a
sanction obliging every one to obey that has a mind to it, and he that has
not, may choose, that is, it is no Law at all, for he that has a mind to it
may do it if there be no Law, and he that has no mind to it need not for all
the Law.

And therefore the wit of man cannot prudently frame a law Numb. 4.
of that temper, and expedient, but either he must lose the formality of a law,
and neither have power coercitive nor obligatory, but ad arbitrium inferiorum,
or else it cannot antecedently to the particular case give leave to any sort of
men to disagree or disobey.

2. Suppose that a Law be made with great reason so as to satisfy diverse
persons pious and prudent, that it complyes with the necessity Numb. 5.
of government, and promotes the interest of Gods service and public order, it
may easily be imagined that these persons which are obedient sons of the
Church, may be as zealous for the public order and discipline of the Church,
as others for their opinion against it, and may be as much scandalized if
disobedience be tolerated, as others are if the Law be exacted, and what shall
be done in this case? Both sorts of men cannot be complied withal, because as
these pretend to be offended at the Law, and by consequence (if they understand
the consequents of their own opinion) at them that obey the Law: so the others
are justly offended at them that unjustly disobey it. If therefore there be any
on the right side as confident and zealous as they who are on the wrong side,
then the disagreeing persons are not to be complied with, to avoid giving
offense; for if they be, offense is given to better persons, and so the
mischief, which such complying seeks to prevent, is made greater and more
unjust, obedience is discouraged, and disobedience is legally canonized for the
result of a holy and a tender conscience.

3. Such complying with the disagreeings of a sort of men, is Numb. 6.
the total overthrow of all Discipline, and it is better to make no Laws of
public worship, then to rescind them in the very constitution: and there can
be no end in making the sanction, but to make the Law ridiculous, and the
authority contemptible. For to say that complying with weak consciences in the
very framing of a Law of Discipline, is the way to preserve unity, were all one
as to say, To take away all Laws is the best way to prevent disobedience. In
such matters of indifferency, the best way of cementing the fraction, is to
unite the parts in the authority, for then the question is but one, viz.
Whether the authority must be obeyed or not? But if a permission be given of
disputing the particulars, the questions become next to infinite. A Mirror
when it is broken represents the object multiplied and divided: but if it be
entire and through one center transmits the species to the eye, the Vision is
one and natural. Laws are the Mirror in which men are to dress and compose
their actions, and therefore must not be broken with such clauses of exception
which may without remedy be abused to the prejudice of authority, and peace,
and all humane sanctions. And I have known in some Churches that this pretense
has been nothing but a design to discredit the Law, to dismantle the
authority that made it, to raise their own credit, and a trophey of their
zeal, to make it a characteristick note of a sect, and the cognizance of holy
persons, and yet the men that claimed exemption from the Laws, upon pretense
of having weak consciences, if in hearty expression you had told them so to
their heads, they would have spit in your face, and were so far from
confessing themselves weak, that they thought themselves able to give Laws to
Christendom, to instruct the greatest Clerks, and to Catechize the Church her
self; And which is the worst of all, they who were perpetually clamorous that
the severity of the Laws should slacken as to their particular, and in matter
adiaphorous (in which, if the Church has any authority, she has power to make
Laws) to indulge a leave to them to do as they list, yet were the most
imperious amongst men, most decretory in their sentences, and most impatient of
any disagreeing from them though in the least minute and particular: whereas by
all the justice of the world, they who persuade such a compliance in matters of
fact, and of so little question, should not deny to tolerate persons that
differ in questions of great difficulty and contestation.

4. But yet since all things almost in the world have been Numb. 7.
made matters of dispute, and the will of some men, and the malice of others,
and the infinite industry and pertinacie of contesting and resolution to
conquer has abused some persons innocently into a persuasion, that even the
Laws themselves, though never so prudently constituted, are superstitious or
impious, such persons who are otherwise pious, humble and religious, are not to
be destroyed for such matters, which in themselves are not of concernment to
salvation, and neither are so accidentally to such men and in such cases where
they are innocently abused, and they err without purpose and design. And
therefore if there be a public disposition in some persons to dislike Laws of
a certain quality, if it before-seene it is to be considered in lege dicenda;
and whatever inconvenience or particular offense is foreseen, is either to be
directly avoided in the Law, or else a compensation in the excellency of the
Law, and certain advantages, made to outweigh their pretensions: But in lege
jam dicta, because there may be a necessity some persons should have a liberty
indulged them, it is necessary that the Governors of the Church should be
entrusted with a power to consider the particular case, and indulge a liberty
to the person, and grant personal dispensations. This I say is to be done at
several times, upon particular instance, upon singular consideration, and new
emergencies. But that a whole kind of men, such a kind to which all men without
possibility of being confuted may pretend, should at once in the very frame of
the Law be permitted to disobey, is to nullify the Law, to destroy Discipline,
and to hallow disobedience; it takes away the obliging part of the Law, and
makes that the thing enacted shall not be enjoined, but tolerated only: it
destroys unity and uniformity, which to preserve was the very end of such
laws of Discipline: it bends the rule to the thing which is to be ruled, so
that the law obeyes the subject, not the subject the law: it is to make a law
for particulars, not upon general reason and congruity, against the prudence
and design of all Laws in the world, and absolutely without the example of
any Church in Christendom; it prevents no scandal, for some will be
scandalized at the authority it self, some at the complying, and remissness of
Discipline, and several men at matters, and upon ends contradictory: All which
cannot, some ought not to be complied withal.

6. The sum is this. The end of the Laws of Discipline are in an immediate
order to the conservation and ornament of the Numb. 8.
public, and therefore the Laws must not so tolerate, as by conserving
persons to destroy themselves and the public benefit, but if there be cause
for it, they must be cassated, or if there be no sufficient cause, the
complyings must be so as may best preserve the particulars in conjunction with
the public end, which because it is primarily intended, is of greatest
consideration. But the particulars whether of case or person are to be
considered occasionally and emergently by the Judges, but cannot antecedently
and regularly be determined by a Law.

But this sort of men is of so general pretense, that all Laws Numb. 9.
and all Judges may easily be abused by them. Those sects which are signified
by a Name, which have a systeme of Articles, a body of profession, may be more
clearly determined in their question concerning the lawfulness of permitting
their professions and assemblies.

I shall instance in two, which are most troublesome and most disliked; and by
an account made of these, we may make judgment what may be done toward others
whose errors are not apprehended of so great malignity. The men I mean are the
Anabaptists and the Papists.

SECT. 18.
A particular consideration of the opinions of the Anabaptists.

IN the Anabaptists I consider only their two capital opinions, the one
against the baptism of infants, the other against Numb. 1.
Magistracy: and because they produce different judgments and various effects,
all their other fancyes which vary as the Moon does, may stand or fall in their
proportion and likeness to these.

And first I consider their denying baptism to infants; although it be a
doctrine justly condemned by the most sorts of Numb. 2.
Christians, upon great grounds of reason, yet possibly their defense may be so
great, as to take off much, and rebate the edge of their adversaries assault.
It will be neither unpleasant nor unprofitable to draw a short scheme of plea
for each party, the result of which possibly may be, that though they be
deceived, yet they have so great excuse on their side, that their error is not
impudent or vincible. The baptism of infants rests wholly upon this discourse.

When God made a covenant with Abraham for himself and his posterity, into
which the Gentiles were reckoned by sprituall Numb. 3.
adoption, he did for the present consigne that covenant with the Sacrament of
circumcision. The extent of which rite, was to all his family, from the Major
domo, to the Proselytus domicilio, and to infants of eight days old. Now the
very nature of this covenant being a covenant of faith for its formallity, and
with all faithful people for the object; and circumcision being a seal of
this covenant, if ever any rite do supervene to consigne the same covenant,
that rite must acknowledge circumcision for its type and precedent. And this
the Apostle tells us in express doctrine. Now the nature of types, is to give
some proportions to its successor the Antitype, and they both being seals of
the same righteousness of faith, it will not easily be found where these two
seals have any such distinction in their nature or purposes, as to appertain
to persons of differing capacity, and not equally concern all, and this
argument was thought of so much force by some of those excellent men which were
Bishops in the primitive church, that a good Bishop writ an Epistle to S.
Cyprian, to know of him whether or no it were lawful to baptize infants before
the eighth day, because the type of baptism was ministered in that
circumcision, he in his discourse supposing that the first rite was a direction
to the second, which prevailed with him so far as to believe it to limit
every circumstance.

And not only this type, but the acts of Christ which were Numb. 4.
previous to the institution of baptism did prepare our understanding by such
impresses as were sufficient to produce such persuasion in us, that Christ
intended this ministry for the actual advantage of infants as well as of
persons of understanding. For Christ commanded that children should be brought
unto him, he took them in his arms, he imposed hands on them and blessed them,
and without question did by such acts of favor consigne his love to them, and
them to a capacity of an eternal participation of it. And possibly the
invitation which Christ made to all to come to him, all them that are heavy
laden, did in its proportion concern infants as much as others, if they be
guilty of Original sin, and if that sin be a burden, and presses them to
any spiritual danger or inconvenience. And it is all the reason of the world,
that since the grace of Christ is as large as the prevarication of Adam, all
they who are made guilty by the first Adam, should be cleansed by the second.
But as they are guilty by another man's act, so they should be brought to the
Font, to be purifyed by others, there being the same proportion of reason, that
by others acts, they should be relieved who were in danger of perishing by the
act of others. And therefore S. Austin argues excellently to this purpose.
Accommodat illis matter Ecclesia aliorum pedes, ut veniant; aliorum cor, ut
credant; aliorum linguam, ut fateantur: ut quoniam quod aegri sunt, alio
peccante praegravantur, sic cum Sermon. 10. de verb. Apost.
sani fiant alio confitente salventur. And Justin Martyr, (...). Resp. ad
Orthodoxos.


But whether they have original sin or no, yet take them in puris
naturalibus, they cannot go to God, or attain to eternity: Numb. 5.
to which they were intended in their first being and creation, and therefore
much less since their naturals are impaired by the curse on humane nature,
procured by Adams prevarication. And if a natural agent cannot in puris
naturalibus attain to heaven, which is a supernatural end, much less when it
is laden with accidental and grievous impediments. Now then since the only
way revealed to us of acquiring Heaven is by Jesus Christ; and the first inlet
into Christianity, and access to him is by Baptism, as appears by the
perpetual Analogy of the New Testament; either Infants are not persons capable
of that end which is the perfection of humane nature, and to which the soul of
man in its being made immortal was essentially designed, and so are miserable
and deficient from the very end of humanity, if they die before the use of
reason; or else they must be brought to Christ by the Church doors, that is by
the Font and waters of Baptism.

And in reason, it seems more pregnant and plausible that Infants rather then
men of understanding should be baptized: For Numb. 6.
since the efficacy of the Sacraments depends upon Divine Institution and
immediate benediction, and that they produce their effects independently upon
man, in them that do not hinder their operation; since Infants cannot by any
act of their own promote the hope of their own salvation, which men of reason
and choice may, by acts of virtue and election; it is more agreeable to the
goodness of God, the honor and excellency of the Sacrament, and the necessity
of its institution that it should in Infants supply the want of humane acts and
free obedience. Which the very thing it self seems to say it does, because
its effect is from God, and requires nothing on man's part, but that its
efficary be not hindered: And then in Infants, the disposition is equal, and
the necessity more: they cannot ponere obicens, and by the same reason cannot
do others acts, which without the Sacraments do advantage us toward our
hopes of heaven, and therefore have more need to be supplied by an act, and an
Institution Divine and supernatural.

And this is not only necessary in respect of the condition of Infants in
capacity, to do acts of grace, but also in obedience Numb. 7.
to Divine precept. For Christ made a Law whose Sanction is with an exclusive
negative to them that are not baptized, [Unlesse a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven;] If then Infants
have a capacity of being co-heires with Christ in the Kingdom of his Father,
as Christ affirms they have, by saying [for of such is the kingdom of heaven]
then there is a necessity that they should be brought to Baptism, there being
an absolute exclusion of all persons unbaptized, and all persons not spiritual
from the kingdom of heaven.

But indeed, it is a destruction of all the hopes and happiness of Infants, a
denying to them an exemption from the final Numb. 8.
condition of Beasts and Insectiles, or else a designing of them to a worse
misery, to say that God has not appointed some external or internal means
of bringing them to an eternal happiness: Internal they have none; for Grace
being an improvement and heigthning the faculties of nature, in order to a
heigthen'd and supernatural end, Grace has no influence or efficacy upon
their faculties, who can do no natural acts of understanding: And if there be
no external means, then they are destitute of all hopes, and possibilities of
salvation.

But thanks be to God, he has provided better and told us Numb. 9.
accordingly, for he has made a promise of the holy Ghost to Infants as well
as to men: The Promise is made to you and to your children, said S. Peter; The
Promise of the Father, the Promise that he would send the holy Ghost: Now if
you ask how this Promise shall be conveyed to our children, we have an express
out of the same Sermon of S. Peter, Be baptized, and ye Act. 2. 38. 39.
shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost; So that therefore because the holy
Ghost is promised, and Baptism is the means of receiving the Promise,
therefore Baptism pertaines to them, to whom the Promise which is the effect of
Baptism does appertain. And that we may not think this Argument is fallible,
or of humane collection, observe that it is the Argument of the same Apostle in
express terms: For in the case of Cornelius and his Family, he justified his
proceeding by this very medium, Shall we deny Baptism to them who have received
the gift of the holy Ghost as well as we? Which Discourse if it be reduced to
form of Argument says this; They that are capable of the same Grace are
receptive of the same sign; but then (to make the Syllogism up with an
assumption proper to our present purpose) Infants are capable of the same
Grace, that is of the holy Ghost (for the Promise is made to our Children as
well as to us, and S. Paul says the Children of believing Parents are holy,
and therefore have the holy Ghost who is the Fountain of holiness and
sanctification) therefore they are to receive the sign and the seal of it,
that is, the Sacrament of Baptism.

And indeed since God entered a Covenant with the Jews, Numb. 10.
which did also actually involve their Children, and gave them a sign to
establish the Covenant, and its appendant Promise, either God does not so much
love the Church as he did the Synagogue, and the mercies of the Gospel are more
restrained, then the mercies of the Law, God having made a Covenant with the
Infants of Israel, and none with the Children of Christian Parents; or if he
has, yet we want the comfort of its Consignation; and unless our Children are
to be baptized, and so entitled to the Promises of the new Covenant, as the
Jewish Babes were by Circumcision, this mercy which appertains to Infants is
so secret and undeclar'd and unconsign'd, that we want much of that mercy and
outward Testimony which gave them comfort and assurance.

And in proportion to these Precepts and Revelations was the practice
Apostolical: For they (to whom Christ gave in Numb. 11.
Precept to make Disciples all Nations baptizing them, and knew that Nations
without Children never were, and that therefore they were passively concerned
in that commission,) baptized whole Families, particularly that of Stephanus
and diverse others, in which it is more then probable there were some Minors if
not sucking Babes. And this practice did descend upon the Church in after Ages
by Tradition Apostolical: Of this we have sufficient Testimony from Origin,
Pro hoc Ecclesia In Romans 6. tom. 2. page 543.
ab Apostolis traditionem accepit, etiam parvulis baptismum dare: And S.
Austin, Hoc Ecclesia a majorum fide percepit: And Sermon. 10. de verb. Apost. c.
2.
generally all Writers (as Calvin says) affirm the same thing: For nullus est
Scriptor tam vetustus, qui non ejus originem ad Apostolorum saeculum pro certo
referat. From hence the Conclusion 4. Instir. cap. 16.. 8.
is, that Infants ought to be baptized, that it is simply necessary, that they
who deny it are Heretics, and such are not to be endured because they deny to
Infants hopes and take away the possibility of their salvation, which is
revealed to us on no other condition of which they are capable but Baptism. For
by the insinuation of the Type, by the action of Christ, by the title Infants
have to Heaven, by the precept of the Gospel, by the Energy of the Promise, by
the reasonableness of the thing, by the infinite necessity on the Infants
part, by the practice Apostolcall, by their Tradition, and the universal
practice of the Church; by all these God and good people proclaim the
lawfulness, the convenience, and the necessity of Infants Baptism.

To all this, the Anabaptist gives a soft and gentle Answer, that it is a
goodly harangue, which upon strict examination will Numb. 12.
come to nothing, that it pretends fairly and signifies little; That some of
these Allegations are false, some impertinent, and all the rest insufficient.

For the Argument from Circumcision is invalid upon infinite Numb. 13.
considerations; Figures and Types prove nothing, unless a Commandment go
along with them, or some express to signify such to be their purpose: For the
Deluge of Waters and the Ark of Noah were a figure of Baptism said Peter; and
if therefore the circumstances of one should be drawn to the other, we should
make Baptism a prodigy rather then a Rite: The Paschall Lamb was a Type of the
Eucharist which succeeds the other as Baptism does to Circumcision; but because
there was in the manducation of the Paschall Lamb, no prescription of
Sacramental drink, shall we thence conclude that the Eucharist is to be
ministered but in one kind? And even in the very instance of this Argument,
supposing a correspondence of analogy between Circumcision and Baptism, yet
there is no correspondence of identity: For although it were granted that both
of them did consign the Covenant of Faith, yet there is nothing in the
circumstance of childrens being circumcised that so concerns that Mystery, but
that it might very well be given to Children, and yet Baptism only to men of
reason; because Circumcision left a Character in the flesh, which being
imprinted upon Infants did its work to them when they came to age; and such a
Character was necessary because there was no word added to the sign; but
Baptism imprints nothing that remains on the body, and if it leaves a
Character at all it is upon the soul, to which also the word is added which is
as much a part of the Sacrament as the sign it self is; for both which
reasons, it is requisite that the persons baptized should be capable of reason,
that they may be capable both of the word of the Sacrament, and the impresse
made upon the Spirit: Since therefore the reason of this parity does wholly
fail, there is no thing left to infer a necessity of complying in this
circumstance of age any more then in the other annexes of the Type: And the
case is clear in the Bishop's Question to Cyprian, for why shall not Infants
be baptized just upon the L. 3. Epist. 8. ad Fidum.
eighth day as well as circumcised? If the correspondence of the Rites be an
Argument to infer one circumstance which is impertinent and accidental to
the mysteriousnesse of the Rite, why shall it not infer all? And then also
Femals must not be baptiezd, because they were not circumcised: But it were
more proper if we would understand it right, to prosecute the analogy from the
Type to the Antitype by way of letter and spirit, and signification, and as
Circumcision figures Baptism, so also the adjuncts of the Circumcision shall
signify something, spiritual, in the adherencies of Baptism: And therefore as
Infants were circumcised, so spiritual Infants shall be baptized, which is
spiritual Circumcision; for therefore Babes had the ministry of the Type, to
signify that we must when we give our names to Christ become (...) children in
malice, [for unless you become like one of these little ones, you cannot enter
into the Kingdom of heaven] said our blessed Savior, and then the Type is
made complete. And this seems to have been the sense of the Primitive Church;
for in the Age next to the Apostles they gave to all baptized persons milk and
honey to represent to them their duty, that though in age and understanding
they were men, yet they were Babes in Christ, and children in malice. But to
infer the sense of the Paedo-baptists is so weak a manner of arguing that
Austin whose device it was (and men use to be in love with their own fancies)
at the most pretended it but as probable and a meare conjecture.

And as ill success will they have with the other Arguments as with this; For
from the action of Christ's blessing Infants Numb. 14.
to infer that they are to be baptized, proves nothing so much as that there
is great want of better Arguments; The Conclusion would be with more
probability derived thus: Christ blessed children and so dismissed them, but
baptized them not, therefore Insants are not to be baptized: But let this be as
weak as its enemy, yet that Christ did not baptize them, is an Argument
sufficient that Christ has other ways of bringing them to heaven then by
baptism, he passed his act of grace upon them by benediction and imposition of
hands.

And therefore, although neither Infants nor any man in puris naturalibus can
attain to a supernatural end without the addition Numb. 15.
of some instrument or means of Gods appointing ordinarily and regularly, yet
where God has not appointed a Rule nor an Order, as in the case of Infants we
contend he has not, the Argument is invalid. And as we are sure that God has
not commanded Infants to be baptized; so we are sure God will do them no
injustice, nor damn them for what they cannot help.

And therefore, let them be pressed with all the inconveniences that are
consequent to Original sin, yet either it will not be Numb. 16.
laid to the charge of Infants, so as to be sufficient to condemn them; or if
it could, yet the mercy and absolute goodness of God will secure them, if he
takes them away before they can glorify him with a free obedience; Quid ergo
festinat innocens aetas ad remissionem peccatorum, was the Question of
Tertullian, (lib. de bapt.) he knew no such danger from their Original guilt
as to drive them to a laver of which in that Age of innocence they had no need,
as he conceived. And therefore, there is no necessity of flying to the help of
others, for tongue, and heart, and faith, and predispositions to baptism; for
what need all this stir? as Infants without their own consent, without any
act of their own; and without any exterior solennity contracted the guilt of
Adams sin, and so are liable to all the punishment which can with justice
descend upon his posterity who are personally innocent; so Infants shall be
restored without any solennity or act of their own, or of any other men for
them, by the second Adam, by the redemption of Jesus Christ, by his
righteousness and mercies applied either immediately, or how or when he shall
be pleased to appoint. And so Austin's Argument will come to nothing without
any need of Godfathers, or the faith of any body else. And it is too narrow a
conception of God Almighty, because he has tied us to the observation of the
Ceremonies of his own institution, that therefore he has tied himself to it.
Many thousand ways there are by which God can bring any reasonable soul to
himself: But nothing is more unreasonable, then because he has tied all men
of years and discretion to this way, therefore we of our own heads shall carry
Infants to him that way without his direction: The conceit is poor and low,
and the action consequent to it is too bold and ventrous, mysterium meum mihi
and filiis domus meae: Let him do what he please to Infants, we must not.

Only this is certain, that God has as great care of Infants as of others, and
because they have no capacity of doing such acts Numb. 17.
as may be in order to acquiring salvation, God will by his own immediate mercy
bring them thither where he has intended them; but to say that therefore he
will do it by an external act and ministry, and that confined to a
particular, viz. This Rite and no other, is no good Argument, unless God could
not do it without such means, or that he had said he would not: And why
cannot God as well do his mercies to Infants now immediately, as he did before
the institution either of Circumcision or Baptism?

However, there is no danger that Infants should perish for want of this
external Ministry, much less for prevaricating Numb. 18.
Christ's precept of Nisiquis renatus fuerit, etc. For first, the Water and the
Spirit in this place signify the same thing; and by Water is meant the effect
of the Spirit, cleansing and purifying the Soul, as appears in its parallel
place of Christ baptizing with the Spirit and with Fire. For although this was
literally fulfilled in Pentecost, yet morally there is more in it, for it is
the sign of the effect of the holy Ghost, and his productions upon the soul;
and it was an excellency of our blessed Savior's office, that he baptizes all
that come to him with the holy Ghost and with fire; for so S. John preferring
Christ's mission and office before his own, tells the Jews, not Christ's
Disciples, that Christ shall baptize them with Fire and the holy Spirit, that
is, all that come to him, as John the Baptist did with water, for so lies the
Antithesis: And you may as well conclude that Infants must also pass through
the fire as through the water. And that we may not think this a trick to elude
the pressure of this place, Peter says the same thing; for when he had said
that Baptism saves us, he adds by way of explication [not the washing of the
flesh, but the confidence of a good Conscience toward God] plainly saying that
it is not water, or the purifying of the body, but the cleansing of the Spirit,
that does that which is supposed to be the effect of Baptism; and if our
Savior's exclusive negative be expounded by analogy to this of Peter, as
certainly the other parallel instance must, and this may, then it will be so
far from proving the necessity of Infants Baptism, that it can conclude for
no man that he is obliged to the Rite; and the doctrine of the Baptism is only
to derive from the very words of Institution, and not be forced from words
which were spoken before it was Ordained. But to let pass this advantage, and
to suppose it meant of external Baptism, yet this no more inferres a necessity
of Infant's Baptism, then the other words of Christ infer a necessity to give
them the holy Communion, Nisi comederitis carnem filii hominis, and biberitis
sangninem, non introibitis in regnum coelonum; and yet we do not think these
words sufficient Argument to communicate them; if men therefore will do us
Justice, either let them give both Sacraments to Infants, as some Ages of the
Church did, or neither. For the wit of man is not able to show a disparity in
the Sanction, or in the Energie of its expression. And therefore they were
honest that understood the obligation to be parallel, and performed it
accordingly, and yet because we say they were deceived in one instance, and yet
the obligation (all the world cannot reasonably say but) is the same; they are
as honest and as reasonable that do neither. And since the Ancient Church did
with an equal opinion of necessity give them the Communion, and yet men
nowadayes do not, why shall men be more burdened with a prejudice and a name
of obloquy, for not giving the Infants one Sacrament more then they are
disliked for not affording them the other. If Anabaptist shall be a name of
digrace, why shall not some other name be invented for them that deny to
communicate Infants, which shall be equally disgraceful, or else both the
opinions signified by such names, be accounted no disparagement, but receive
their estimate according to their truth?

Of which truth since we are now taking account from pretenses Numb. 19.
of Scripture, it is considerable that the discourse of S. Peter which is
pretended for the intitling Infants to the Promise of the holy Ghost, and by
consequence to Baptism, which is supposed to be its instrument and conveyance,
is wholly a fancy, and has in it nothing of certainty or demonstration, and
not much probability. For besides that the thing it self is unreasonable, and
the holy Ghost works by the heigthning and improving our natural faculties,
and therefore is a promise that so concerns them as they are reasonable
creatures, and may have a title to it, in proportion to their nature, but no
possession or reception of it, till their faculties come into act; besides
this, I say, the words mentioned in S. Peter's Sermon (which are the only
record of the promise) are interpreted upon a weak mistake: The promise belongs
to you and to your children, therefore Infants are actually receptive of it in
that capacity. That Is the Argument; but the reason of it is not yet discovered,
nor ever will, for [to you and your children] is to you and your posterity, to
you and your children when they are of the same capacity, in which you are
effectually receptive of the promise: But he that when ever the word [children]
is used in Scripture shall by [children] understand Infants, must needs believe
that in all Israel there were no men, but all were Infants; and if that had
been true, it had been the greater wonder they should overcome the Anakims and
beat the King of Moab, and march so far, and discourse so well, for they were
all called the children of Israel.

And for the Allegation of S. Paul that Infants are holy, if Numb. 20.
their Parents be faithful, it signifies nothing but that they are holy by
designation, just as Jeremy and John Baptist were sanctified in their Mothers
womb, that is they were appointed and designed for holy Ministeries; but had
not received the Promise of the Father the gift of the holy Ghost, for all that
sanctification; and just so the Children of Christian Parents are sanctified,
that is designed to the service of Jesus Christ, and the future participation
of the Promises.

And as the Promise appertains not (for ought appears) to Numb. 21.
Infants in that capacity and consistence, but only by the title of their being
reasonable creatures, and when they come to that act of which by nature they
have the faculty; so if it did, yet Baptism is not the means of conveying the
holy Ghost. For that which Peter says, be baptized and ye shall receive the
holy Ghost, signifies no more then this: First be baptized and then by
imposition of the Apostles hands (which was another mystery and rite,) ye shall
receive the Promise of the Father: And this is nothing but an insinuation of
the rite of confirmation, as is to this sense expounded by diverse Ancient
Authors, and in ordinary ministry the effect of it is not bestowed upon any
unbaptized persons; for it is in order next after Baptism; and upon this ground
Peter's Argument in the case of Cornelius was concluding enough a majori ad
minus: Thus the holy Ghost was bestowed upon him and his Family, which gift by
ordinary ministry was consequent to Baptism, (not as the effect is to the
cause or to the proper instrument, but as a consequent is to an antecedent in a
chain of causes accidentally and by positive institution depending upon each
other) God by that miracle did give testimony, that the persons of the men were
in great dispositions toward Heaven, and therefore were to be admitted to
those Rites, which are the ordinary inlets into the Kingdom of Heaven. But
then from hence to argue that wherever there is a capacity of receiving the
same grace, there also the same sign is to be ministered, and from hence to
infer Paedo-baptism, is an Argument very fallacious upon several grounds.
First, because Baptism is not the sign of the holy Ghost, but by another
mystery it was conveyed ordinarily, and extraordinarily, it was conveyed
independently from any mystery, and so the Argument goes upon a wrong
supposition. Secondly, if the supposition were true, the proposition built upon
it is false; for they that are capable of the same grace, are not always
capable of the same sign; for women under the Law of Moses, although they were
capable of the righteousness of Faith, yet they were not capable of the sign
of Circumcision: For God does not always convey his graces in the same manner,
but to some mediately, to others immediately; and there is no better instance in
the world of it, then the gift of the holy Ghost (which is the thing now
instanced in this contestation) for it is certain in Scripture, that it was
ordinarily given by imposition of hands, and that after Baptism; (And when this
came into an ordinary ministry, it was called by the Ancient Church Chrism or
Confirmation) but yet it was given sometimes without imposition of hands, as at
Pentecost and to the Family of Cornelius; sometimes before Baptism, sometimes
after, sometimes in conjunction with it.

And after all this, least these Arguments should not ascertaine Numb. 22.
their Cause, they fall on complaining against God, and will not be content
with God, unless they may baptize their Children, but take exceptions that God
did more for the Children of the Jews. But why so? Because God made a Covenant
with their Children actually as Infants, and consigned it by Circumcision:
Well; so he did with our children too in their proportion. He made a Covenant
of spiritual Promises on his part, and spiritual and real services on ours;
and this pertains to Children when they are capable, but made with them as soon
as they are alive, and yet not so as with the Jews Babes; for as their rite
consigned them actually, so it was a National and temporal blessing and
Covenant, as a separation of them from the portion of the Nations, a marking
them for a peculiar people, (and therefore while they were in the Wilderness
and separate from the commixture of all people, they were not at all
circumcised) but as that rite did seal the righteousness of Faith, so by
virtue of its adherency, and remanency in their flesh, it did that work when
the Children came to age. But in Christian Infants the case is otherwise; for
the new Covenant being established upon better Promises, is not only to better
purposes, but also in distinct manner to be understood; when their spirits are
as receptive of a spiritual act or impresse as the bodies of Jewish Children
were of the sign of Circumcision, then it is to be consigned: But this
business is quickly at an end, by saying that God has done no less for ours,
then for their Children; for he will do the mercies of a Father and Creator
to them, and he did no more to the other; but he has done more to ours; for he
has made a Covenant with them and built it upon Promises of the greatest
concernment; he did not so to them: But then for the other part which is the
maine of the Argument, that unless this mercy be consigned by Baptism, as good
not at all in respect of us, because we want the comfort of it; this is the
greatest vanity in the world: For when God has made a Promise pertaining also
to our Children (for so our Adversaries contend, and we also acknowledge in its
true sense) shall not this Promise, this word of God be of sufficient truth,
certainty, and efficacy to cause comfort, unless we tempt God and require a
sign of him? May not Christ say to these men as sometime to the Jews, a wicked
and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign shall be given unto
it? But the truth on it is, this Argument is nothing but a direct quarrelling
with God Almighty.

Now since there is no strength in the Doctrinall part, the Numb. 23.
practice and precedents Apostolical and Ecclesiastical, will be of less
concernment, if they were true as is pretended, because actions Apostolical
are not always Rules for ever; it might be fit for them to do it pro loco and
tempore as diverse others of their Institutions, but yet no engagement past
thence upon following Ages; for it might be convenient at that time, in the new
spring of Christianity, and till they had engaged a considerable party, by that
means to make them parties against the Gentiles Superstition, and by way of
pre-occupation to ascertain them to their own sect when they came to be men; or
for some other reason not trasmitted to us, because the Question of fact it
self is not sufficiently determined. For the insinuation of that precept of
baptizing all Nations, of which Children certainly are a part, does as little
advantage as any of the rest, because other parallel expressions of Scripture
do determine and expound themselves to a sense that includes not all persons
absolutely, but of a capable condition, as adorate eum omnes gentes, and
psallite Deo omnes nationes terrae and diverse more.

As for the conjecture concerning the Family of Stephanus, Numb. 24.
at the best it is but a conjecture, and besides that it is not proved that
there were Children in the Family; yet if that were granted, it follows not
that they were baptized, because by [whole Families] in Scripture is meant all
persons of reason and age within the Family; for it is said, of the Ruler at
Capernaum, Ioh. 4.
that he believed and all his house: Now you may also suppose that in his house
were little Babes, that is likely enough, and you may suppose that they did
believe too before they could understand, but that is not so likely; and then
the Argument from baptizing of Stephen's household may be allowed just as
probable: But this is unman-like to build upon such slight aerie conjectures.

But Tradition by all means must supply the place of Scripture, Numb. 25.
and there is pretended a Tradition Apostolical, that Infants were baptized:
But at this we are not much moved; For we who rely upon the written Word of God
as sufficient to establish all true Religion, do not value the Allegation of
Tradions: And however the world goes, none of the Reformed Churches can pretend
this Argument against this opinion, because they who reject Tradition when it is
against them, must not pretend it at all for them: But if we should allow the
Topic to be good, yet how will it be verified? for so far as it can yet
appear, it relies wholly upon the Testimony of Origin, for from him Austin had
it. Now a Tradition Apostolical if it be not consigned with a fuller Testimony
then of one person whom all after-Ages have condemned of many errors, will
obtain so little reputation amongst those who know that things have upon
greater Authority pretended to derive from the Apostles, and yet falsely, that
it will be a great Argument that he is credulons and weak, that shall be
determined by so weak probation in matters of so great concernment. And the
truth of the business is, as there was no command of Scripture to oblige
Children to the susception of it, so the necessity of Paedobaptism was not
determined in the Church till in the eighth Age after Christ, but in the year
418 in the Milevitan Council, a Provincial of Africa, there was a Canon made
for Paedo-baptism; never till then! I grant it was practiced in Africa before
that time, and they or some of them thought well of it, and though that be no
Argument for us to think so, yet none of them did ever before, pretend it to be
necessary, none to have been a precept of the Gospel. S. Austin was the first
that ever preached it to be absolutely necessary, and it was in his heat and
anger against Pelagius who had warmed and chafed him so in that Question that
it made him innovate in other doctrines possibly of more concernment then this.
And that although this was practiced anciently in Africa, yet that it was
without an opinion of necessity, and not often there, nor at all in other
places, we have the Testimony of a learned Paedo-baptist, Ludovicus Vives, who
in his Annotations upon S. Austin, De Civit. Dei. l. 1. c. 27. affirms, Neminem
nisi adultum antiquitus solere baptizari.

But besides that the Tradition cannot be proved to be Apostolical; we have
very good evidence from Antiquity, that it Numb. 26.
was the opinion of the Primitive Church, that Infants ought not to be
baptized; and this is clear in the sixth Canon of the Council of Neocaesarea,
The words are these, (...): The sense is this, A woman with child may be
baptized when she please; For her Baptism concerns not the child. The reason
of the connection of the parts of that Canon is in the following words, because
every one in that Confession is to give a demonstration of his own choice and
election: Meaning plainly, that if the Baptism of the Mother did also pass
upon the child, it were not fit for a pregnant woman to receive Baptism,
because in that Sacrament there being a Confession of Faith, which Confession
supposes understanding, and free choice, it is not reasonable the child should
be consigned with such a mystery, since it cannot do any act of choice or
understanding: The Canon speaks reason, and it intimates a practice which was
absolutely universal in the Church, of interrogating the Catechumens
concerning the Articles of Creed: Which is one Argument that either they did
not admit Infants to Baptism, or that they did prevaricate egregiously in
asking Questions of them, who themselves knew were not capable of giving answer.

And to supply their incapacity by the Answer of a Godfather, Numb. 27. Quid ni
necesse est (sie legit Franc. Iunius in notis ad Tertul.) sponsores eti. am
periculo ingeri qui and ipsi per mortalitatem destituere promissiones suas
possint, and proventu malae indolis falli? Tertul. lib. de baptis cap. 18.
is but the same unreasonablenesse acted with a worse circumstance: And there
is no sensible account can be given of it; for that which some imperfectly
murmr concerning stipulations civil performed by Tutors in the name of their
Pupils, is an absolute vanity: For what if by positive Constitution of the
Romans such solennities of Law are required in all stipulations, and by
indulgence are permitted in the case of a notable benefit accruing to Minors,
must God be tied, and Christian Religion transact her mysteries by proportion
and compliance with the Law of the Romans? I know God might if he would have
appointed Godfathers to give Answer in behalf of the Children, and to be
fidejussors for them; but we cannot find any Authority or ground that he has,
and if he had, then it is to be supposed he would have given them Commission to
have transacted the solennity with better circumstances, and given Answers with
more truth. For the Question is asked of believing in the present. And if the
Godfathers answer in the name of the child, [I do believe] it is Lib. de
baptis. prope finem, cap. 18. itaque pro personae cujusque condition ac
dispositione, etiam aetate, cunctatio baptismi utilior est, praecipue tamen
circa parvulos....Fiant Christiani cum Christum nosse potuerint.
notorious they speak false and ridiculously; for the Infant is not capable of
believing, and if he were, he were also capable of dissenting, and how then do
they know his mind? And therefore Tertullian gives advice that the Baptism of
Infants should be deferred till they could give an account of their Faith, and
the same also is the Council of Orat. 40, quaest in S. Baptisma.
Gregory Bishop of Nazianzum, although he allows them to hasten it in case of
necessity; for though his reason taught him what was fit, yet he was overborn
with the practice and opinion of his Age, which began to bear too violently
upon him, and yet in another place he makes mention of some to whom Baptism was
not adminstred (...), by reason of Infancy; To which if we add that the
Parents of S. Austin, S. Hierom, and S. Ambrose although they were Christian,
yet did not baptize their children before they were; o years of age, it will be
very considerable in the example, and of great efficacy for destroying the
supposed necessity or derivation from the Apostles.

But however, it is against the perpetual analogy of Christ's Numb. 28.
Doctrine to baptize Infants: For besides that Christ never gave any precept to
baptize them, nor ever himself nor his Apostles (that appears) did baptize any
of them; All that either he or his Apostles said concerning it, requires such
previous dispositions to Baptism of which Infants are not capable, and these
are Faith and Repentance: And not to instance in those innumerable places that
require Faith before this Sacrament, there needs no more but this one saying of
our blessed Savior, He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he
that believes not Mar. 16.
shall be damned; plainly thus, Faith and Baptism in conjunction will bring a
man to heaven; but if he have not Faith, Baptism shall do him no good. So that
if Baptism be necessary then, so is Faith, and much more; for want of Faith
damnes absolutely; it is not said so of the want of Baptism. Now if this
decretory sentence be to be understood of persons of age, and if Children by
such an Answer (which indeed is reasonable enough) be excused from the
necessity of Faith, the want of which regularly does damn, then it is sottish
to say the same incapacity of reason and Faith shall not excuse from the
actual susception of Baptism, which is less necessary, and to which Faith and
many other acts are necessary predisposions when it is reasonably and humanely
received. The Conclusion is, that Baptism is also to be deferred till the time
of Faith: And whether Infants have Faith or no, is a Question to be disputed by
persons that care not how much they say, nor how little they prove.

1. Personal and actual Faith they have none; for they have Numb. 29.
no acts of understanding; and besides how can any man know that they have,
since he never saw any sign of it, neither was he told so by any one that could
tell? 2. Some say they have imputative Faith; but then so let the Sacrament be
too, that is, if they have the Parents Faith or the Churches, then so let
Baptism be imputed also by derivation from them, that as in their Mothers womb,
and while they hang on their breasts, they live upon their Mothers nourishment,
so they may upon the Baptism of their Parents or their Mother the Church. For
since Faith is necessary to the susception of Baptism (and they themselves
confess it by striving to find out new kinds of Faith to dawb the matter up)
such as the Faith is, such must be the Sacrament: for there is no proportion
between an actual Sacrament and an imputative Faith, this being in immediate
and necessary order to that: And whatsoever can be said to take off from the
necessity of actual Faith, all that and much more may be said to excuse from
the actual susception of Baptism. 3. The first of these devices was that of
Luther and his Scholars, the second of Calvin and his; and yet there is a third
device which the Church of Rome teaches, and that is, that Infants have
habitual Faith: But who told them so? how can they prove it? what Revelation,
or reason teaches any such thing? Are they by this habit so much as disposed
to an actual belief without a new master? Can an Infant sent into a Mahumetan
Province be more confident for Christianity when he comes to be a man, then if
he had not been baptized? Are there any acts precedent, concomitant or
consequent to this pretended habit? This strange invention is absolutely
without art, without Scripture, Reason or Authority: But the men are to be
excused unless there were a better; But for all these stratagemes, the
Argument now alleged against the Baptism of Infants is demonstrative and
unanswerable.

To which also this consideration may be added, that if Baptism Numb. 30.
be necessary to the salvation of Infants, upon whom is the imposition laid? To
whom is the command given? to the Parents or to the Children? not to the
Children, for they are not capable of a Law; not to the Parents, for then God
has put the salvation of innocent Babes into the power of others; and Infants
may be damned for their Fathers carelessnesse or malice. It follows that it is
not necessary at all to be done to them, to whom it cannot be prescribed as a
Law, and in whose behalf it cannot be reasonably entrusted to others with the
appendant necessity; and if it be not necessary, it is certain it is not
reasonable, and most certain it is nowhere in terms prescribed, and therefore
it is to be presumed, that it ought to be understood and administered according
as other precepts are with reference to the capacity of the subject, and the
reasonableness of the thing.

For I consider, that the baptizing of Infants does rush us upon Numb. 31.
such inconveniences which in other Questions we avoid like Rocks, which will
appear if we Discourse thus.

Either Baptism produces spiritual effects, or it produces them not: If it
produces not any, why is such contention about it, what are we the nearer
heaven if we are baptized? and if it be neglected, what are we the farther off?
But if (as without all peradventure all the Paedo-baptists will say) Baptism
does do a work upon the soul, producing spiritual benefits and advantages,
these advantages are produced by the external work of the Sacrament alone, or
by that as it is helped by the cooperation and predispositions of the
suscipient.

If by the external work of the Sacrament alone, how does this differ from the
opus operatum of the Papists, save that it is worse? for they say the Sacrament
does not produce its effect but in a suscipient disposed by all requisites and
due preparatives of piety, faith, and repentance; though in a subject so
disposed, they say the Sacrament by its own virtue does it; but this opinion
says it does it of it self without the help, or so much as the coexistence of
any condition but the meare reception.

But if the Sacrament does not do its work alone, but per modum recipientis
according to the predispositions of the suscipient, then because Infants can
neither hinder it, nor do any thing to further it, it does them no benefit at
all. And if any man runs for succor to that exploded (...), that Infants have
Faith, or any other inspired habit of I know not what or how, we desire no
more advantage in the world, then that they are constrained to an answer
without Revelation, against reason, common sense, and all the experience in the
world.

The sum of the Argument in short, is this though under another representment.

Either Baptism is a meare Ceremony, or it implies a Duty on our part. If it be
a Ceremony only, how does it sanctify us, or make the comers thereunto
perfect? If it implies a Duty on our part, how then can Children receive it,
who cannot do duty at all?

And indeed, this way of Ministration makes Baptism to be wholly an outward
duty, a work of the Law, a carnal Ordinance, it makes us adhere to the letter,
without regard of the Spirit, to be satisfied with shadows, to return to
bondage, to relinquish the mysteriousnesse, the substance and Spirituality of
the Gospel. Which Argument is of so much the more consideration, because under
the Spiritual Covenant, or the Gospel of Grace, if the mystery goes not before
the Symbol (which it does when the Symbols are Seals and Consignations of the
Grace, as it is said the Sacraments are) yet it always accompanies it, but
never follows in order of time: And this is clear in the perpetual analogy of
holy Scripture.

For Baptism is never propounded, mentioned or enjoined as a means of
remission of sins, or of eternal life, but something of duty, choice and
sanctity is joined with it, in order to production of the end so mentioned,
Know ye not that as many Romans 6. 3.
as are baptized into Christ Jesus, are baptized into his death? There is the
mystery and the Symbol together, and declared to be perpetually united, (...).
All of us who were baptized into one, were baptized into the other, Not only
into the Name of Christ, but into his death also: But the meaning of this as it
is explained in the following words of S. Paul, makes much for our purpose: For
to be baptized into his death, signifies to be buried with him in Baptism,
that as Christ rose from the dead, we also should walk in newness of life:
That Is Verse. 4.
the full mystery of Baptism; For being baptized into his death, or which is
all one in the next words, (...) into the likeness of his death, cannot go
alone; if we be so planted Verse. 5.
into Christ, we shall be partakers of his Resurrection, and that is not here
instanced in precise reward, but in exact Duty, for all this is nothing but
crucifixion of the old man, a destroying the Verse. 6.
body of sin, that we no longer serve sin.

This indeed is truly to be baptized both in the Symbol and the Mystery:
Whatsoever is less then this, is but the Symbol only, a meare Ceremony, an
opus operatum, a dead letter, an empty shadow, an instrument without an agent
to manage, or force to actuate it.

Plainer yet: Whosoever are baptized into Christ have put on Christ, have put
on the new man: But to put on this new man, is to be formed in righteousness,
and holiness, and truth: This whole Argument is the very words of S. Paul: The
Major proposition is dogmatically determined, Gal. 3. 27. The Minor in Ephesians.
4. 24. The Conclusion then is obvious, that they who are not formed new in
righteousness, and holiness, and truth, they who remaining in the present
incapacites cannot walk in newness of life, they have not been baptized into
Christ, and then they have but one member of the distinction, used by S. Peter,
they have that Baptism which is a putting away the filth of the flesh; but they
have not that Baptism which is the answer of a 1 Pet. 3. 21.
good conscience toward God, which is the only Baptism that saves us: And
this is the case of children; And then the case is thus.

As Infants by the force of nature cannot put themselves into a supernatural
condition, (and therefore say the Paedo-baptists, they need Baptism to put them
into it:) so if they be baptized before the use of reason, before the works of
the Spirit, before the operations of Grace, before they can throw off the works
of darkness, and live in righteousness and newness of life, they are never
the nearer: From the pains of Hell they shall be saved by the mercies of God
and their own innocence, though they die in puris naturalibus, and Baptism will
carry them no further. For that Baptism that saves us, is not the only washing
with water, of which only, Children are capable, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God, of which they are not capable till the use of reason,
till they know to choose the good and refuse the evil.

And from thence I consider anew, That all vows made by persons under others
Names, stipulations made by Minors, are not valid till they by a supervening
act after they are of sufficient age do ratify them. Why then may not Infants
as well make the vow de novo, as de novo ratify that which was made for them
ab antiquo when they come to years of choice? If the Infant vow be invalid till
the Manly confirmation, why were it Vide Erasmum in praefat. ad Annotat. in
Matthew.
not as good they staid to make it till that time, before which if they do
make it, it is to no purpose? This would be considered.

And in Conclusion, Our way is the the surer way, for not to baptize Children
till they can give an account of their Faith, is Numb. 32.
the most proportionable to an act of reason and humanity, and it can have no
danger in it: For to say that Infants may be damned for want of Baptism, (a
thing which is not in their power to acquire, they being persons not yet
capable of a Law) is to affirm that of God which we dare not say of any wise
and good man. Certainly it is much derogatory to Gods Justice and a plain
defiance to the infinite reputation of his goodness.

And therefore, who ever will pertinaciously persist in this opinion Numb. 33.
of the Paedo-baptists and practice it accordingly, they pollute the blood of
the everlasting Testament, they dishonor and make a pageantry of the
Sacrament, they ineffectually represent a sepulture into the death of Christ,
and please themselves in a sign without effect, making Baptism like the
fig tree in the Gospel, full of leaves but no fruit; And they invocate the holy
Ghost in vain, doing as if one should call upon him to illuminate a stone, or
a tree.

Thus far the Anabaptists may argue, and men have Disputed Numb. 34.
against them with so much weakness and confidence, that they have been
encouraged in their error (...) as Nazianzen observes of the case of the
Church in his time.
more by the accidental advantages we have given them by our weak arguings,
then by any truth of their cause, or excellency of their wit. But the use I
make of it as to our present Question is this: That since there is no direct
impiety in the opinion, nor any that is apparently consequent to it, and they
with so much probability do or may pretend to true persuasion, they are with
all means, Christian, fair, and humane, to be redargued, or instructed, but
if they cannot be persuaded they must be left to God, who knows every degree
of every man's understanding, all his weaknesses and strengths, what impresse
each Argument makes upon his Spirit, and how unresistible every reason is, and
he alone judges his innocence and sincerity; and for the Question, I think
there is so much to be pretended against that, which I believe to be the truth,
that there is much more truth then evidence on our side, and therefore we may
be confident as for our own particulars, but not too forward peremptorily to
prescribe to others, much less damn, or to kill, or to persecute them that
only in this particular disagree.

SECT. XIX.
That there may be no Toleration of Doctrines inconsistent with piety or the
pulique good.

BUt then for their other capital Opinion, with all its branches, Numb. 1.
that it is not lawful for Princes to put Malefactors to death, nor to take up
desensive Arms, nor to minister an Oath, nor to contend in judgment, it is
not to be disputed with such liberty as the former: For although it be part of
that Doctrine which Clemens Alexandrinus says was delivered per secretam
traditionem Apostolorum, Non licere Christianis contendere L. 7. Stromat.
in Iudicio, nec coram gentibus, nec coram sanctis, and perfectum non debere
Iurare; and the other part seems to be warranted by the eleventh Canon of the
Nicene Council, which enjoynes penance to them that take Arms after their
conversion to Christianity; yet either these Authorities are to be slighted, or
be made receptive of any interpretation rather then the Commonwealth be
disarmed of its necessary supports, and all Laws made ineffectuall and
impertinent: For the interest of the republique, and the well being of bodies
politic is not to depend upon the nicety of our imaginations, or the fancies
of any peevish or mistaken Priests, and there is no reason a Prince should ask
John-a-Brunck, whether his understanding will give him leave to reign, and be a
King: Nay, suppose there were diverse places of Scripture which did seemingly
restrain the Political use of the Sword, yet since the avoiding a personal
inconvenience, has by all men been accounted sufficient reason to expound
Scripture to any sense rather then the literal, which inferres an unreasonable
inconvenience, (and therefore the pulling out an eye, and the cutting off a
hand, is expounded by mortifying a vice, and killing a criminal habit) much
rather must the Allegations against the power of the Sword endure any sense
rather then it should be thought that Christianity should destroy that which is
the only instrument of Justice, the restraint of vice and support of bodies
politic. It is certain that Christ and his Apostles, and Christian Religion
did comply with the most absolute Government, and the most imperial that was
then in the world; and it could not have been at all endured in the world if it
had not; for indeed the world it self could not last in regular and orderly
communities of men, but be a perpetual confusion, if Princes and the Supreme
Power in Bodies Politic, were not armed with a coercive power to punish
Malefactors: The public necessity, and universal experience of all the world
convinces those men of being most unreasonable, that make such pretenses which
destroy all Laws, and all Communities, and the bands of civil Societies, and
leave it arbitrary to every vain or vicious person whether men shall be safe,
or Laws be established, or a Murderer hanged, or Princes Rule. So that in this
case men are not so much to Dispute with particular Arguments, as to consider
the Interest and concernment of Kingdoms and Public Societies: For the
Religion of Jesus Christ is the best establisher of the felicity of private
persons, and of public Communities; it is a Religion that is prudent and
innocent, humane, and reasonable, and brought infinite advantages to mankind,
but no inconvenience, nothing that is unnatural, or unsociable, or unjust. And
if it be certain that this world cannot be governed without Laws, and Laws
without a compulsory signify nothing, then it is certain, that it is no good
Religion that teaches Doctrine whose consequents will destroy all Government;
and therefore it is as much to be rooted out, as any thing that is the greatest
pest and nuisance to the public interest: And that we may guess at the
purposes of the men, and the inconvenience of such Doctrine; these men that did
first intend by their Doctrine to disarme all Princes, and bodies Politic, did
themselves take up arms to establish their wild, and impious fancy; and
indeed that Prince or Commonwealth that should be persuaded by them; would be
exposed to all the insolences of forraingners, and all mutinies of the
teachers themselves, and the Governors of the people could not do that duty
they owe to their people of protecting them from the rapine and malice which
will be in the world as long as the world is. And therefore, here they are to
be restrained from preaching such Doctrine, if they mean to preserve their
Government, and the necessity of the thing will justify the lawfulness of the
thing: If they think it to themselves, that cannot be helped; so long it is
innocent as much as concerns the Public; but if they preach it, they may be
accounted Authors of all the consequent inconveniences, and punished
accordingly: No Doctrine that destroys Government is to be endured; For
although those Doctrines are not always good that serve the private ends of
Princes, or the secret designs of State, which by reason of some accidents or
imperfections of men may be promoted by that which is false and pretending, yet
no Doctrine can be good that does not comply with the formality of Government
it self, and the well being of bodies Politic; Augur cum esset Cato, dicere
ausus est, optimis auspiciis ea geri Cicero de senectute.
quae pro Reipub. salute gererentur; quae contra Rempub. fierent contra
auspicia fieri: Religion is to meliorate the condition of a people, not to do
it disadvantange, and therefore those Doctrines that inconvenience the Public,
are no parts of good Religion; ut Respub. salva fit, is a necessary
consideration in the permission of Prophecyings; for according to the true,
solid, and prudent ends of the Republic, so is the Doctrine to be permitted or
restrained, and the men that preach it according as they are good Subjects, and
right Commonwealths men: For Religion is a thing superinduced to temporal
Government, and the Church is an addition of a capacity to a Commonwealth, and
therefore is in no sense to disserve the necessity and just interests of that
to which it is super-added for its advantage and conservation.

And thus by a proportion to the Rules of these instances, all Numb. 2.
their other Doctrines are to have their judgment, as concerning Toleration or
restraint; for all are either speculative, or practical, they are consistent
with the Public ends or inconsistent, they teach impiety or they are innocent,
and they are to be permitted or rejected accordingly. For in the Question of
Toleration, the foundation of Faith, good life and Government is to be secured;
in all others cases, the former considerations are effectual.

SECT. XX.
How far the Religion of the Church of Rome is Tolerable.

But now concerning the Religion of the Church of Rome (which was the other
instance I promised to consider) we Numb. 1.
will proceed another way, and not consider the truth or falsity of the
Doctrines; for that is not the best way to determine this Question concerning
permitting their Religion or Assemblies; because that a thing is not true, is
not Argument sufficient to conclude that he that believes it true is not to be
endured; but we are to consider what inducements there are that possess the
understanding of those men; whether they be reasonable and innocent, sufficient
to abuse or persuade wise and good men, or whether the Doctrines be commenced
upon design, and managed with impiety, and then have effects not to be endured.

And here first, I consider that those Doctrines that have Numb. 2.
had long continuance and possession in the Church, cannot easily be supposed
in the present Professors to be a design, since they have received it from so
many Ages, and it is not likely that all Ages should have the same purposes, or
that the same Doctrine should serve the several ends of diverse Ages. But
however; long prescription is a prejudice, oftentimes so insupportable, that it
cannot with many Arguments be retrenched, as relying upon these grounds, that
truth is more ancient then falsehood, that God would not for so many Ages
forsake his Church, and leave her in an error; that whatsoever is new, is not
only suspicious, but false; which are suppositions, pious and plausible enough.
And if the Church of Rome had communicated Infants so long as she has prayed
to Saints, or baptized Infants, the communicationg would have been believed
with as much confidence, as the other Articles are, and the dissentients with
as much impatience rejected. But this consideration is to be enlarged upon all
those particulars, which as they are apt to abuse the persons of the men and
amuse their understandings, so they are instruments of their excuse, and by
making their errors to be invincible, and their opinions, though false, yet
not criminal, make it also to be an effect of reason and charity, to permit
the men a liberty of their Conscience, and let them answer to God for
themselves and their own opinions: Such as are the beauty and splendour of their
Church; their pompous Service; the stateliness and solennity of the Hierarchy;
their name of Catholic, which they suppose their own due, and to concern no
other Sect of Christians; the Antiquity of many of their Doctrines; the
continual Succession of their Bishops; their immediate derivation from the
Apostles; their Title to succeed S. Peter; the supposall and pretense of his
personal Prerogatives; the advantages which the conjunction of the Imperial
Seat with their Episcopal has brought to that Sea; the flattering expressions
of minor Bishops, which by being old Records, have obtained credibility; the
multitude and variety of people which are of their persuasion; apparent consent
with Antiquity in many Ceremonialls which other Churches have rejected; and a
pretended, and sometimes an apparent consent with some elder Ages in many
matters doctrinall; the advantage which is derived to them by entertaining some
personal opinions of the Fathers, which they with infinite clamours see to be
cried up to be a Doctrine of the Church of that time; The great consent of one
part with another in that which most of them affim to be de fide; the great
differences which are commenced amongst their Adversaries, abusing the Liberty
of Prophesying unto a very great licentiousness; their happiness of being
instruments in converting diverse Nations; the advantages of Monarchical
Government, the benefit of which as well as the inconveniences (which though
they feel they consider not) they daily do enjoy; the piety and the austerity
of their Religious Orders of men and women; the single life of their Priests
and Bishops; the riches of their Church; the severity of their Fasts and their
exterior observances; the great reputation of their first Bishops for Faith
and sanctity; the known holiness of some of those persons whose Institutes the
Religious Persons pretend to imitate; their Miracles false or true,
substantial or imaginary; the casualties and accidents that have happened to
their Adversaries, which being chances of humanity are attributed to several
causes according as the fancies of men and their Interests are pleased or
satisfied; the temporal selicity of their Professors; the oblique arts and
indirect proceedings of some of those who departed from them; and amongst many
other things, the names of Heretic and Schismatic, which they with infinite
pretinacy fasten upon all that disagree from them; These things and diverse
others may very easily persuade persons of much reason and more piety, to
retain that which they know to have been the Religion of their Forefathers,
which had actual possession and seizure of men's understandings before the
opposite professions had a name; And so much the rather because Religion has
more advantages upon the fancy and affections, then it has upon Philosophy and
severe discourses, and therefore is the more easily persuaded upon such grounds
as these, which are more apt to amuse then to satisfy the understanding.

Secondly, If we consider the Doctrines themselves, we shall Numb. 3.
find them to be superstructures ill built, and worse managed, but yet they
keep the foundation, they build upon God in Jesus Christ, they profess the
Apostles Creed, they retain Faith and Repentance as the supporters of all our
hopes of Heaven, and believe many more truths then can be proved to be of
simple and original necessity to salvation: And therefore all the wisest
Personages of the adverse party allowed to them possibility of salvation,
whilst their errors are not faults of their will, but weaknesses and
deceptions of the understanding. So that there is nothing in the foundation of
Faith, that can reasonably hinder them to be permitted: The foundation of Faith
stands secure enough for all their vain and unhandsome superstructures.

But then on the other side, if we take account of their Doctrines as they
relate to good life, or are consistent or inconsistent with civil Government,
we shall have other considerations.

Thirdly, For I consider, that many of their Doctrines do Numb. 4.
accidentally teach or lead to ill life, and it will appear to any man that
considers the result of these propositions: Attrition (which is a low and
imperfect degree of sorrow for sin, or as others say a sorrow for sin
commenced upon any reason of temporal hope, or fear or desire or any thing
else) is a sufficient disposition for a man in the Sacrament of penance to
receive absolution, and be justified before God, by taking away the guilt of
all his sins, and the obligation to eternal pains. So that already the
fear of Hell is quite removed upon conditions so easy, that many men take
more pains to get a groat, then by this Doctrine we are obliged to, for the
curing and acquitting all the greatest sins of a whole life, of the most
vicious person in the world: And but that they affright their people with a
fear of Purgatory, or with the severity of Penances in case they will not
venture for Purgatory (for by their Doctrine they may choose or refuse either)
there would be nothing in their Doctrine or Discipline to impede and slacken
their proclivity to sin; but then they have as easy a cure for that too, with
a little more charge sometimes, but most commonly with less trouble: For there
are so many confraternities, so many privileged Churches, Altars, Monasteries,
Coemeteries, Offices, Festivals, and so free a concession of Indulgences
appendant to all these, and a thousand fine devices to take away the fear of
Purgatory, to commute or expiate Penances, that in no sect of men, do they
with more ease and cheapnesse reconcile a wicked life with the hopes of heaven,
then in the Roman Communion.

And indeed if men would consider things upon their true Numb. 5.
grounds, the Church of Rome should be more reproved upon Doctrines that
infer ill life, then upon such as are contrariant to Faith. For false
superstructures do not always destroy: Faith; but many of the Doctrines they
teach if they were prosecuted to the utmost issue would destroy good life: And
therefore my quarrel with the Church of Rome is greater and stronger upon such
points which are not usually considerd, then it is upon the ordinary disputes,
which have to no very great purpose so much disturbed Christendom: And I am
more scandalized at her for teaching the sufficiency of Attrition in the
Sacrament, for indulging Penances so frequently, for remitting all Discipline,
for making so great a part of Religon to consist in externalls and
Ceremonialls, for putting more force and Energy and exacting with more severity
the commandments of men then the precepts of Justice, and internal Religion:
Lastly, besides many other things, for promising heaven to persons after a
wicked life upon their impertinent cries and Ceremon alls transacted by the
Priest and the dying Person: I confess I wish the zeal of Christendom were a
little more active against these and the like Doctrines, and that men would
write and live more earnestly against them then as yet they have done.

But then what influence this just zeal is to have upon the Numb. 6.
persons of the Professors is another consideration: For as the Pharisees did
preach well and lived ill, and therefore were to be heard not imitated: So if
these men live well though they teach ill, they are to be imitated not heard:
their Doctrines by all means, Christian and humane, are to be discountenanced,
but their persons tolerated eatenus; their Profession and Decrees to be
rejected and condemned, but the persons to be permitted, because by their good
lives they confute their Doctrines, that is, they give evidence, that they
think no evil to be consequent to such opinions, and if they did, that they
live good lives, is argument sufficient that they would themselves cast the
first stone against their own opinions, if they thought them guilty of such
misdemeanors.

Fourthly, But if we consider their Doctrines in relation to Numb. 7.
Government, and Public societies of men, then if they prove faulty, they are
so much the more intolerable by how much the consequents, are of greater danger
and malice: Such Doctrines as these, The Pope may dispense with all oaths
taken to God or man: He may absolve Subjects from their Allegiance to their
natural Prince: Faith is not to be kept with Heretics, Heretical Princes may
be slain by their Subjects. These Propositions are so deprest, and do so
immediately communicate with matter, and the interests of men, that they are of
the same consideration with matters of fact, and are to be handled accordingly.
To other Doctrines ill life may be consequent; but the connection of the
antecedent and the consequent is not (peradventure) perceived or acknowledged
by him that believes the opinion with no greater confidence then he disavowes
the effect, and issue of it. But in these, the ill effect is the direct
profession and purpose of the opinion, and therefore the man and the man's
opinion is to be dealt withal, just as the matter of fact is to be judged; for
it is an immediate, a perceived, a direct event, and the very purpose of the
opinion. Now these opinions are a direct overthrow to all humane society, and
mutual commerce, a destruction of Government, and of the laws and duty and
subordination which we owe to Princes; and therefore those men of the Church of
Rome that do hold them, and preach them, cannot pretend to the excuses of
innocent opinions, and hearty persuasion, to the weakness of humanity, and the
difficulty of things; for God has not left those truths which are necessary
for conservation of public societies of men, so intricate and obscure, but
that every one that is honest and desirous to understand his duty, will
certainly know that no Christian truth destroys a man's being sociable and a
member of the body Politic, cooperating to the conservation of the whole as
well as of it self. However, if it might happen that men should sincerely err
in such plain matters of fact (for there are fools enough in the world) yet
if he hold his peace, no man is to persecute or punish him, for then it is
meare opinion which comes not under Political Cognizance, that is, that
Cognizance which only can punish corporally; but if he preaches it, he is
actually a Traitor, or Seditious, or Author of Perjury, or a destroyer of
humane Society, respectively to the nature of the Doctrine; and the preaching
such Doctrines cannot claim the privilege and immunity of a meare opinion,
because it is as much matter of fact, as any the actions of his disciples and
confidents, and therefore in such cases is not to be permitted, but judged
according to the nature of the effect it has or may have upon the actions of
men.

Fifthly: But lastly, In matters mearly speculative, the case is wholly
altered, because the body Politic which only may lawfully Numb. 8.
use the sword, is not a competent Judge of such matters which have not direct
influence upon the body Politic, or upon the lives and manners of men as they
are parts of a Community (not but that Princes or Judges Temporal may have as
much ability as others, but by reason of the incompetency of the Authority;)
And Gallio spoke wisely, when he discoursed thus to the Jews, If it were a
matter of wrong or Act. 18. 14.
wicked lewdness o ye Jews, reason would that I should hear you; But if it be
a question of words, and names, and of your Law, look ye to it, for I will be
no Judge of such matters: The man spoke excellent reason; for the Cognisnance
of these things did appertain to men of the other robe: but the Ecclesiastical
power, which only is competent to take notice of such questions, is not of
capacity to use the Temporal sword or corporal inflictions: The meare
doctrines and opinions of men are things Spiritual, and therefore not
Cognoscible by a temporal Authority; and the Ecclesiastical Authority, which
is to take Cognizance is it self so Spiritual, that it cannot inflict any
punishment corporal.

And it is not enough to say that when the Magistrate restraines Numb. 9.
the preaching such opinions, if any man preaches them he may be punished (and
then it is not for his opinion but his disobedience that he is punished) for
the temporal power ought not to restrain Prophecyings, where the public
peace and interest is not certainly concerned. And therefore it is not
sufficient to excuse him, whose Law in that case being by an incompetent power
made a scruple where there was no sin.

And under this consideration, come very many Articles of the Church of Rome,
which are wholly speculative, which do Numb. 10.
not derive upon practice, which begin in the understanding and rest there, and
have no influence upon life and government, but very accidentally, and by a
great many removes, and therefore are to be considered only so far as to
guide men in their persuasions, but have no effect upon the persons of men,
their bodies, or their temporal condition: I instance in two; Prayer for the
dead, and the Doctrine of Transubstantion, these two to be instead of all the
rest.

For the first, This Discourse is to suppose it false, and we are Numb. 11.
to direct our proceedings accordingly: And therefore I shall not need to urge
with how many fair words and gay pretenses, this Doctrine is set off, apt
either to conzen or instruct the conscience of the wisest according as it is
true or false respectively. But we find (says the Romanist) in the History of
the Maccabees, that the Jews did pray and make offerings for the dead (which
also appears by other Testimonies, and by their form of prayers still extant
which they used in the Captivity) it is very considerable, that since our
blessed Savior did reprove all the evil Doctrines and Traditions of the
Scribes and Pharisees, and did argue concerning the dead and the Resurrection
against the Sadduces, yet he spoke no word against this public practice, but
left it as he found it, which he who came to declare to us all the will of his
Father would not have done, if it had not been innocent, pious and full of
charity. To which by way of consociation, if we add that S. Paul did pray for
Onesiphorus, That God would show him a mercy in that day, 2 Timothy 1. 18.
that is, according to the style of the New Testament, the day of Judgment:
The result will be, that although it be probable, that Onesiphorus at that time
was dead (because in his salutations he salutes his household, without naming
him who was the Major domo, against his custom of salutitions in other
places:) Yet besides this, the prayer was for such a blessing to him whose
demonstration and reception could not be but after death; which implies
clearly, that then there is a need of mercy, and by consequence the dead people
even to the day of Judgment inclusively are the subject of a misery, the
object of Gods mercy, and therefore fit to be commemorated in the duties of our
piety and charity, and that we are to recommend their condition to God, not
only to give them more glory, in the reunion, but to pity them to such
purposes in which they need; which because they are not revealed to us in
particular, it hinders us not in recommending the persons in particular to Gods
mercy, but should rather excite our charity and devotion: For it being certain
that they have a need of mercy, and it being uncertain how great their need is,
it may concern the prudence of charity to be the more earnest as not knowing
the greatness of their necessity.

And if there should be any uncertainty in these Arguments, Numb. 12.
yet its having been the universal practice of the Church of God in all
places, and in all Ages till within these hundred years, is a very great
inducement for any member of the Church to believe that in the first Traditions
of Christianity, and the Institutions Apostolical, there was nothing delivered
against this practice, but very much to insinuate or enjoin it; because the
practice of it was at the first, and was universal. And if any man shall doubt
of this, he shows nothing but De corona milit. c. 3. and de monogam. c. 10.
that he is ignorant of the Records of the Church, it being plain in
Tertullian and S. Ep. 66.
Cyprian (who were the eldest Writers of the Latin Church) that in their times
it was ab antiquo, the custom of the Church to pray for the Souls of the
Faithful departed, in the dreadful mysteries: And it was an Institution
Apostolical (says one of them) and so transmitted to the following Ages of
the Church, and when once it began upon slight and discontent to be contested
against by Aerius, the man was presently condemned for a Heretic, as appears
in Epiphanius.

But I am not to consider the Arguments for the Doctrine Numb. 13.
it self, although the probability and fair pretense of them may help to
excuse such persons who upon these or the like grounds do heartily believe it.
But I am to consider that whether it be true or false, there is no manner of
malice in it, and at the worst, it is but a wrong error upon the right side of
charity, and concluded against by its Adversaries upon the confidence of such
Arguments, which possibly are not so probable as the grounds pretended for it.

And if the same judgment might be made of any more of Numb. 14.
their Doctrines, I think it were better men were not furious, in the
condemning such Questions which either they understood not upon the grounds of
their proper Arguments, or at least consider not, as subjected in the persons,
and lessened by circumstances, by the innocence of the event, or other
prudentiall considerations.

But the other Article is harder to be judged of, and has made greater stirs
in Christendom, and has been dashed at Numb. 15.
with more impetuous objections, and such as do more trouble the Question of
Toleration. For if the Doctrine of Transubstantiation be false (as upon much
evidence we believe it is) then it is accused of introducing Idolatry, giving
Divine worship to a Creature, adoring of bread and wine, and then comes in the
precept of God to the Jews, that those Prophets who persuaded to Idolatry
should be slain.

But here we must deliberate, for it is concerning the lives Deuteronomy. 13.
of men, and yet a little deliberation may suffice: For Idolatry Numb. 16.
is a forsaking the true God, and giving Divine Worship to a Creature or to an
Idol, that is, to an imaginary god, who has no foundation in essence or
existence: And is that kind of superstition which by Divines is called the
superstition of an undue object: Now it is evident that the Object of their
Adoration (that which is represented to them in their minds, their thoughts,
and purposes, and by which God principally if not solely takes estimate of
humane actions) in the blessed Sacrament, is the only true and eternal God,
hypostatically joined with his Holy humanity, which humanity they believe
actually present under the veil of the Sacramental signs: And if they
thought him not present, they are so far from worshipping the bread in this
case, that themselves profess it to be Idolatry to do so, which is a
demonstration that their soul has nothing in it that is Idololatricall. If
their confidence and fancyfull opinion has engaged them upon so great mistake
(as without doubt it has) yet the will has nothing in it, but what is a great
enemy to Idolatry, Et nihil ardet in inferno nisi propria voluntas: And
although they have done violence to all Philosophy, and the reason of man, and
undone and cancelled the principles of two or three Sciences, to bring in this
Article, yet they have a Divine Revelation whose literal and Grammatical
sense, if that sense were intended, would warrant them to do violence to all
the Sciences in the Circle; and indeed that, Transubstantiation is openly and
violently against natural reason, is an Argument to make them disbelieve, who
believe the mystery of the Trinity in all those niceties of explication which
are in the School (and which now adays pass for the Doctrine of the Church)
with as much violence to the principles of natural and supernatural
Philosophy, as can be imagined to be in the point of Transubstantiation.

1. But for the Article it self, we all say that Christ is there Numb. 17.
present some way or other extraordinary; and it will not be amiss to worship
him at that time, when he gives himself to us in so mysterious a manner, and
with so great advantages; especially since the whole Office is a Consociation
of diverse actions of Religion and Divine Worship. Now in all opinions of those
men who think it an act of Religion to communicate and to offer; a Divine
Worship is given to Christ, and is transmitted to him by mediation of that
action and that Sacrament, and it is no more in the Church of Rome, but that
they differ and mistake infinitely in the manner of his presence; which error
is wholly seated in the Understanding, and does not communicate with the will;
for all agree that the Divinity and the Humanity of the Son of God is the
ultimate and adequate object of Divine Adoration, and that it is incommunicable
to any creature whatsoever, and before they venture to pass an Act of
Adoration, they believe the bread to be annihilated or turned into his
substance who may lawfully be worshipped; and they who have these thoughts, are
as much enemies of Idolatry, as they that understand better how to avoid that
inconvenience which is supposed to be the crime, which they formally hate, and
we materially avoid: This consideration was concerning the Doctrine it self.

2. And now for any danger to men's persons for suffering Numb. 18.
such a Doctrine, this I shall say, that if they who do it, are not formally
guilty of Idolatry, there is no danger that they whom they persuade to it
should be guilty; and what persons soever believe it to be Idolatry, to worship
the Sacrament, while that persuasion remains will never be brought to it,
there is no fear of that: And he that persuades them to do it by altering
their persuasions and beliefes, does no hurt but altering the opinions of the
men, and abusing their understandings; but when they believe it to be no
Idolatry, then their so believing it is sufficient security from that crime
which has so great a tincture and residency in the will, that from thence only
it has its being criminal.

3. However, if it were Idolatry, I think the Precept of God Numb. 19.
to the Jews of killing false and Idolatrous Prophets will be no warrant for
Christians so to do: For in the case of the Apostles and the men of Samaria,
when James and John would have called for fire to destroy them even as Elias did
under Moses Law, Christ distinguished the spirit of Elias from his own Spirit,
and taught them a lesson of greater sweetness, and consigned this truth to all
Ages of the Church, that such severity is not consistent with the meekness
which Christ by his example and Sermons has made a precept Evangelicall: At
most it was but a Judicial Law and no more of Argument to make it necessary to
us, then the Mosaicall precepts of putting Adulterers to death, and trying the
accused persons by the waters of jealousy.

And thus in these two Instances, I have given account what Numb. 20.
is to be done in Toleration of diversity of opinions: The result of which is
principally this: Let the Prince and the Secular Power have a care the
Commonwealth be safe. For whether such or such a Sect of Christians be to be
permitted is a question rather Political then Religious; for as for the
concernments of Religion, these instances have furnished us with sufficient to
determine us in our duties as to that particular, and by one of these all
particulars may be judged.

And now it were a strange inhumanity to permit Jews in Numb. 21.
a Commonwealth, whose interest is served by their inhabitation, and yet upon
equal grounds of State and Policy, not to permit differing Sects of
Christians: For although possibly there is more danger, men's persuasions should
be altered in a commixture of diverse Sects of Christians, yet there is not so
much danger when they are changed from Christian to Christian, as if they be
turned from Christian to Jew, as many are daily in Spain and Portugal.

And this is not to be excused by saying the Church has no Numb. 22.
power over them qui foris sunt as Jews are: For it is true the Church in the
capacity of Spiritual regiments has nothing to do with them, because they
are not her Diocese: Yet the Prince has to do with them, when they are
subjects of his regiment: They may not be Excommunicate any more then a stone
may be killed, because they are not of the Christian Communion, but they are
living persons parts of the Commonwealth, infinitely deceived in their
Religion, and very dangerous if they offer to persuade men to their opinions,
and are the greatest enemies of Christ whose honor and the interest of whose
Service a Christian Prince is bound with all his power to maintain. And when
the Question is of punishing disagreeing persons with death, the Church has
equally nothing to do with them both, for she has nothing to do with the
temporal sword, but the Prince whose Subjects equally Christians and Jews
are, has equal power over their persons; for a Christian is no more a subject
then a Jew is, The Prince has upon them both the same power of life and death,
so that the Jew by being no Christian is not foris, or any more an exempt
person for his body, or his life then the Christian is: And yet in all Churches
where the secular power has temporal reason to tolerate the Jews, they are
tolerated without any scruple in Religion; which thing is of more
consideration, because the Jews are direct Blasphemers of the Son of God,
and Blasphemy by their own Law the Law of Moses is made capital; And might
with greater reason be inflicted upon them, who acknowledge its obligation then
urged upon Christians as an Authority, enabling Princes to put them to death,
who are accused of accidental and consequutive Blasphemy and Idolatry
respectively, which yet they hate and disavow with much zeal and heartinesse
of persuasion. And I cannot yet learn a reason why we shall not be more
complying with them, who are of the household of Faith; for at least they are
children though they be but rebellious children (and if they were not, what
has the Mother to do with them any more then with the Jews?) they are in
some relation or habitude of the Family, for they are consigned with the same
Baptism, profess the same Faith delivered by the Apostles, are erected in the
same hope, and look for the same glory to be reaveled to them, at the coming
of their Common Lord and Savior, to whose Service according to their
understanding they have vowed themselves: And if the disagreeing persons be to
be esteemed as Heathens and Publicans, yet not worse, Have no company with
them, that is the worst that is to be done to such a man in S. Paul's judgment,
Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

SECT. XXI.
Of the duty of particular Churches in allowing Communion.

FRom these premises, we are easily instructed concerning the lawfulness or
duty respectively of Christian Communion, Numb. 1.
which is differently to be considered in respect of particular Churches to
each other, and of particular men to particular Churches: For as for particular
Churches, they are bound to allow Communion to all those that profess the same
Faith upon which the Apostles did give Communion; For whatsoever preserves us
as Members of the Church, gives us title to the Communion of Saints, and
whatsoever Faith or belief that is to which God has promised Heaven, that
Faith makes us Members of the Catholic Church: Since therefore the Judicial
Acts of the Church are then most prudent and religious when they nearest
imitate the example and piety of God: To make the way to Heaven straighter then
God made it, or to deny to communicate with those whom God will vouchsase to be
united, and to refuse our charity to those who have the same Faith, because
they have not all our opinions, and believe not every thing necessary which we
overvalue; is impious and Schismatic, it inferres Tyranny on one part, and
persuades and tempts to uncharitableness and animosities on both; It dissolves
Societies, and is an enemy to peace, it busies men in impertinent wranglings,
and by names of men and titles of factions it consignes the interessed parties
to act their differences to the height, and makes them neglect those advantages
which piety and a goodlife bring to the reputation of Christian Religion and
Societies.

And therefore Vincentius Lirinensis, and indeed the whole Numb. 2.
Church accounted the Donatists Heretics upon this very ground, Cap. 11. Vid.
Pacian. Epist. ad Sempron. 2.
because they did imperiously deny their Communion to all that were not of
their persuasion; whereas the Authors of that opinion for which they first did
separate, and make a Sect, because they did not break the Churches peace nor
magisterially prescib d to others, were in that disagrecing and error
accounted Catholics, Divisio enim and disunio facit vos haereticos, pax and
unit as L. 2. c. 95. contra liter. Petilian.
faciunt Catholicos said S. Austin; and to this sense is that of S. Paul, If I
had all faith and had not charity, I am nothing: He who upon confidence of his
true belief denies a charitable Communion to his brother, loses the reward of
both. And if Pope Victor had been as charitable to the Asiaticks as Pope
Anicetus, and S. Polycarp were to each other in the same disagreeing concerning
Easter, Victor had not been (...), so bitterly reproved and condemned as he was
for the uncharitable managing of his disagreeing by Polycrates and Eusebius. l. 5.
c. 25, 26.
Irenaeus; Concordia enim quae est charitat is effectus est unio voluntatum non
opinionum. True Faith which leads to charity Aquin. 22ae. q 37 a 1.
leads on to that which unites wills and affections, not opinions.

Upon these or the like considerations, the Emperor Zeno Numb. 3.
published his (...) in which he made the Nicene Creed to be the medium of
Catholic Communion, and although he lived after the Council of Chalcedon, yet
he made not the Decrees of that Council an instrument of its restraint and
limit, as preferring the peace of Christendom, and the union of charity far
before a forced or pretended unity of persuasion, which never was or ever will
be real and substantial; and although it were very convenient if it could be
had, yet it is therefore not necessary because it is impossible; and if men
please, whatever advantages to the public would be consequent to it, may be
supplied by a charitable compliance and mutual permission of opinion, and the
offices of a brotherly affection prescribed us by the Laws of Christianity:
And we have seen it, that all Sects of Christians, when they have an end to be
served upon a third, have permitted that liberty to a second, which we now
contend for, and which they formerly denied but now grant, that by joining
hands, they might be the stronger to destroy the third. The Arrians and
Meletians joined against the Catholics: The Catholics and Novatians joined
against the Arrians. Now if men would do that for charity which they do for
interest, it were handsomer and more ingenuous; For that they do permit each
others disagreeings for their interest's sake, convinces them of the
lawfulness of the thing, or else the unlawnesse of their own proceedings, and
therefore it were better they would serve the ends of charity then of faction,
for then that good end would hallow the proceeding and make it both more
prudent and more pious, while it serves the design of religious purposes.

SECT. XXII.
That particular men may communicate with Churches of different persuasions,
and how far they may do it.

AS for the duty of particular men in the Question of communicating with
Churches of different persuasions, it is Numb. 1.
to be regulated according to the Laws of those Churches; for if they require
no impiety, or any thing unlawful as the condition of their Communion, then
they communicate with them as they are Servants of Christ, as Disciples of his
Doctrine and subjects to his Laws, and the particular distinguishing Doctrine
of their Sect has no influence or communication with him who from another Sect
is willing to communicate with all the Servants of their Common Lord: For since
no Church of one name is infallible, a wise man may have either the misfortune
or a reason to believe of every one in particular, that she erres in some
Article or other, either he cannot communicate with any, or else he may
communicate with all, that do not make a sin or the profession of an error
to be the condition of their Communion. And therefore, as every particular
Church is bound to Tolerate disagreeing persons in the senses and for the
reasons above explicated; so every particular person is bound to Tolerate her,
that is, not to refuse her Communion when he may have it upon innocent
conditions: For what is it to me if the Greek Church denies Procession of the
third Person from the second, so she will give me the right hand of Fellowship,
(though I affirm it) therefore because I profess the Religion of Jesus Christ,
and retain all matters of Faith and necessity? But this thing will scarce be
reduced to practice, for few Churches that have framed bodies of Confession,
and Articles, will endure any person that is not of the same confession; which
is a plain demonstration that such bodies of Confession and Articles do much
hurt, by becoming instruments of separating and dividing Communions, and
making unnecessary or uncertain propositions a certain means of Schism and
disunion: But then men would do well to consider whether or no such
proceedings do not derive the guilt of Schism upon them who least think it,
and whether of the two is the Schismatic? he that makes unnecessary and
(supposing the state of things) inconvenient impositions, or he that disobeyes
them, because he cannot without doing violence to his conscience believe them?
He that parts Communion, because without sin he could not entertain it, or
they that have made it necessary for him to separate, by requiring such
conditions which to man are simply necessary, and to his particular are either
sinful or impossible?

The Sum of all is this, There is no security in any thing Numb. 2.
or to any person, but in the pious and hearty endeavors of a good life, and
neither sin nor error does impede it from producing its proportionate and
intended effect: because it is a direct deletery to sin and an excuse to
errors, by making them innocent, and therefore harmless. And indeed this is
the intendment and design of Faith: For (that we may join both ends of this
Discourse together) therefore certain Articles are prescribed to us, and
propounded to our understanding, that so we might be supplied with
instructions, with motives and engagements to incline and determine our wills
to the obedience of Christ. So that obedience is just so consequent to Faith,
as the acts of will are to the dictates of the understanding: Faith therefore
being in order to obedience, and so far excellent as it self is a part of
obedience or the promoter of it, or an engagement to it; it is evident that if
obedience and a good life be secured upon the most reasonable and proper
grounds of Christianity, that is, upon the Apostles Creed, then Faith also is
secured. Since whatsoever is beside the duties, the order of a good life,
cannot be a part of Faith, because upon Faith, a good life is built; all other
Articles by not being necessary, are no otherwise to be required, but as they
are to be obtained and fourd out, that is, morally, and fallibly, and humanely;
It is fit all truths be promoted fairly and properly, and yet but few Articles
prescribed Magisterially, nor framed into Symbols and bodies of Confession;
least of all after such composures, should men proceed so furiously as to say
all disagreeing after such declarations to be damnable for the future, and
capital for the present. But this very thing is reason enough to make men more
limited in their prescriptions, because it is more charitable in such
suppositions so to do.

But in the thing it self, because few kinds of errors are damnable, it is
reasonable as few should be capital. And because Numb. 3.
every thing that is damnable in it self and before Gods Judgment Seat, is
not discernable before men (and questions disputable are of this condition) it
is also very reasonable that fewer be capital then what are damnable, and that
such Questions should be permitted to men to believe because they must be left
to God to judge. It concerns all persons to see that they do their best to
find out truth, and if they do, it is certain that let the error be never so
damnable, they shall escape the error or the misery of being damned for it. And
if God will not be angry at men for being invincibly deceived, why should men
be angry one at another? For he that is most displeased at another man's error,
may also be tempted in his own will, and as much deceived in his understanding:
For if he may fail in what he can choose, he may also fail in what he cannot
choose: His understanding is no more secured then his will, nor his Faith more
then his obedience. It is his own fault if he offends God in either but
whatsoever is not to be avoided; as errors, which are incident oftentimes even
to the best and most inquisitive of men, are not offenses against God, and
therefore not to be punished, or restrained by men; but all such opinions* in
which the public interests of the Commonwealth, and the foundation of Faith,
and a good life, are not concerned, are to be permitted freely, Quisque abundet
in sensu suo was the Doctrine of S. Paul, and that is Argument and Conclusion
too; and they were excellent words which S. Ambrose said in attestation of this
great truth, Nec Imperiale est libertatem dicendi negare, nec sacerdotale quod
sentias non dicere.

A Discourse concerning PRAYER Ex tempore, etc.
I Have read over this Book which the Assembly of Divines is pleased to call
The Directory for Prayer; I confess I came to it with much expectation, and
was in some measure confident I should have found it an exact and unblameable
model of Devotion, free from all those objections which men of their own
persuasion had obtruded against the public Liturgy of the Church of England;
or at least, it should have been composed with so much artifice and finenesse,
that it might have been to all the world an Argument of their learning and
excellency of spirit, if not of the goodness and integrity of their Religion
and purposes. I shall give no other character of the whole, but that the
public disrelish which I find amongst persons of great piety, of all
qualities, not only of great, but even of ordinary understandings, is to, me
some argument that it lies so open to the objections even of common spirits,
that the Compilers of it did intend more to prevail by the success of their
Armies, then the strength of reason, and the proper grounds of persuasion,
which yet most wise and good men believe to be the more Christian way of the
two. But Sir, you have engaged me to say something in particular to satisfy
your conscience. In which also I desire I may reserve a leave to my self to
conceal much, if I may in little do you satisfaction.

I shall therefore decline to speak of the Efficient cause of this Directory,
and not quarrel at it that is was composed, against Numb. 2.
the Laws both of England and all Christendom. If the thing were good and
pious, I should learn to submit to the imposition, and never quarrel at the
incompetency of his authority that engaged me to do pious and holy things. And
it may be when I am a little more used to it, I shall not wonder at a Synod, in
which not one Bishop sits (in the capacity of a Bishop) though I am most
certain this is the first example in England, since it was first Christened. But
for present it seems something hard to digest it, because I know so well that
all Assemblies of the Church have admitted Priests to consultation and dispute,
but never to authority and decision, till the Pope enlarging the phylacteries
of the Archimandrites and Abbots, did sometimes by way of privilege and
dispensation give to some of them decisive voices in public Councels. But this
was one of the things in which he did innovate and invade against the public
resolutions of Christendom, though he durst not do it often, and when he did
it, it was in very small and inconsiderate numbers.

I said I would not meddle with the Efficient, and I cannot meddle with the
Final cause, nor guess at any other ends and Numb. 3.
purposes of theirs then at what they publicly profess, which is the
abolition and destruction of the Book of Common Prayer; which great change,
because they are pleased to call Reformation, I am content in charity to
believe they think it so, and that they have Zelum Dei, but whether secundum
scientiam, according to knowledge or no, must be judged by them who consider
the matter and the form.

But because the matter is of so great variety and minute consideration, every
part whereof would require as much scrutiny Numb. 4.
as I purpose to bestow upon the whole, I have for the present chosen to
consider only the form of it; and because it pretends against the form of set
Lyturgy; and that ex tempore forms do succeed in room of the established and
determined services, I shall give you my judgment of it, without any
sharpness or bitterness of spirit, for I am resolved not to be angry with any
man of another persuasion, as knowing that I differ just as much from them as
they do from me.

And first, I consider that the true state of the Question is only this,
Whether it is better to pray to God with consideration Numb. 5.
or without? whether is the wiser man of the two, he who thinks, and
deliberates what to say, or he that utters his mind as fast as it comes?
Whether is the better man, he who out of reverence to God is most careful and
curious that he offend not in his tongue, and therefore he himself deliberates
and takes the best guides he can, or he who out of the confidence of his own
abilities or other exterior assistances, speaks what ever comes uppermost?

And here I have the advice and council of a very wise man, no less than
Solomon, Eccles. 5. 2. Be not rash with thy mouth, Numb. 6.
and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God, for God is in
heaven and thou upon earth, therefore, let thy words be few. The consideration
of the vast distance between God and us, Heaven and Earth, should create such
apprehensions in us, that the very best and choycest of our offertoryes are not
acceptable but by Gods gracious vouchsafeing and condescension: and therefore
since we are so much indebted to God for accepting our best, it is not safe
ventured to present him with a dowbaked sacrifice, and put him off with that
which in nature and humane consideration is absolutely the worst; for such is
all the crude and imperfect utterance of our more imperfect conceptions. But
let Solomon's reason be what it will, good we are sure it is. Let us consider
who keeps the precept best; He that deliberates, or he that considers not but
when he speaks: What man in the world is hasty to offer any thing before God,
if he be not who prays ex tempore? And then add to it but the weight of
Solomon's reason, and let any man answer me if he thinks it can well stand with
that reverence we owe to the Immense, the infinite, and to the eternal God,
the God of wisdom, to offer him a sacrifice which we durst not present to a
Prince, or a prudent Governor in re seria, such as our prayers ought to be.

And that this may not be dashed with a pretense it is carnal Numb. 7.
reasoning I desire it may be remembered, that it is the argument God himself
uses against lame, maimed, and imperfect sacrifices, Go and offer this to thy
Prince, see if he will accept it: Implying, that the best person is to have the
best present; and what the Prince will slight as truly unworthy of him, much
more is it unfit for God. For God accepts not of any thing we give or do, as
if he were bettred by it: for therefore its estimate is not taken by its
relation or natural complacency to him, it is all alike to him, for in it
self it is to him as nothing. But God accepts it by its proportion, and
commensuration to us. That which we call our best, and is truly so in humane
estimate, that pleases God, for it declares that if we had better, we would
give it him. But to reserve the best, says too plainly, that we think any
thing is good enough for him. As therefore God in the Law would not be served
by that which was imperfect in genere naturae: so neither now nor ever will
that please him which is imperfect in genere morum, or materia intellectuali,
when we can give a better.

Well then, in the nature of the thing, ex tempore forms have much the worse of
it. But it is pretended that there is such Numb. 8.
a thing as the gift of Prayer, a praying with the Spirit, Et nescit tarda
molimina spiritus sancti gratia. Gods Spirit (if he pleases) can do his work
as well in an instant, as in long premeditation. And to this purpose are
pretended those places of Scripture which speak of the assistance of Gods
Spirit in our prayers, Zech. 12. 10. And I will pour upon the house of David,
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplication. But
especially Romans 8. 26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities; for we
know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it self makes
intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered, etc. From whence the
Conclusion that is inferred is in the words of Saint Paul, That we must pray
with the spirit, therefore not with set forms, therefore ex tempore.

The Collection is somewhat wild; for there is great independence in the
several parts, and much more is in the Conclusion, Numb. 9.
then was virtually in the premises. But such as it is, the Authors of it I
suppose will own it. And therefore we will examine the maine design of it and
then consider the particular means of its persuasion, quoted in the objection.

It is one of the privileges of the Gospel, and the benefit of Numb. 10.
Christ's ascension, that the holy Ghost is given unto the Church, and is become
to us the fountain of gifts and graces. But these gifts and graces are
improvements and helps of our natural faculties, of our art and industry not
extraordinary, miraculous, and immediate infusions of habits and gifts. That
without Gods Spirit we cannot pray aright; that our infirmities need his help;
that we know not what to ask of our selves, is most true: and if ever any
Heretic was more confident of his own naturals, or did ever more undervalue
Gods grace then ever the Pelagians did, yet he denies not this. But what then?
Therefore without study, without art, without premeditation, without learning,
the spirit gives the gift of prayer, and it is his grace, that without any
natural or artificial help makes us pray ex tempore? No such thing: The
Objection proves nothing of this.

Here therefore we will join issue, whether the gifts and helps Numb. 11.
of the Spirit be immediate infusions of the Faculties, and powers, and perfect
abilities? Or that he does assist us only by his aids external and internal,
in the use of such means which God and nature has given to man, to ennoble his
soul, better his Faculties, and to improve his understanding? That the aids of
the holy Ghost are only assistances to us in the use of natural and
artificial means, I will undertake to prove, and from thence it will evidently
follow, that labor, and hard study, and premeditation will soonest purchase
the gift of prayer, and ascertain us of the assistance of the spirit; and
therefore set forms of prayer, studied and considered of are in a true and
proper sense, and without enthusiasm, the fruits of the spirit.

1. Gods Spirit did assist the Apostles by ways extraordinary, Numb. 12.
and fit for the first institution of Christianity: but does assist us now by
the expresses of those first assistances which he gave to them immediately. So
that the holy Ghost is the author of our says, and we believe with the spirit
(it is Saint Paul's expression) and yet our belief comes by hearing and reading
the holy Scriptures and their interpretations. Now reconcile these two
together, Faith comes by hearing, and yet is the gift of the Spirit, and it
says, that the gifts of the Spirit are not ecstasies, and immediate infusions
of habits, but helps from God to enable us upon the use of the means of his
own appointment to believe, to speak, to understand, to prophecy, and to pray.

2. And that these are for this reason called gifts, and graces, and issues of
the Spirit, is so evident and notorious, that the Numb. 13.
speaking of an ordinary revealed truth, is called in Scripture a speaking by
the Spirit, 1 Cor. 12. 8. No man can say that Jesus Vid. Act. 19. 21. Act. 16.
7, 8, 9. 10.
is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost. For if the holy Ghost supplies us with
materials, and fundamentals for our building, it is then enough to denominate
the whole edifice to be of him, although the labor and the workmanship be
ours, upon another stock. And this is it which the Apostles speaks, 1 Cor. 2.
13. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches,
but which the holy Ghost teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
The holy Ghost teaches, yet it is upon our cooperation, our study and
endeavor, while we compare spiritual things with spiritual; the holy Ghost
is said to teach us, because these spirituals were of his suggestion and
revelation.

3. For it is a rule of the Schools, and there is much reason Numb. 14.
in it. Habitus infusi infunduntur per modum acquisitorum, whatsoever is
infused into us, is in the same manner infused as other things are acquired,
that is, step by step, by humane means and cooperation, and grace does not
give us new faculties, and create another nature, but meliorates and improves
our own. And what S. Paul said in the Resurrection, is also true in this
Question. That is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,
and then that which is spiritual. The graces and gifts of the Spirit are
postnate, and are additions to art and nature. God directs our councels, opens
our understandings, regulates our will, orders our affections, supplies us with
Objects, and Arguments, and opportunities, and revelations in scriptis, and
then most when we most employ our own endeavors, God loving to bless all the
means, and instruments of his service, whether they be natural or acquisite.

But whosoever shall look for any other gifts of the spirit besides Numb. 15.
the parts of nature helped by industry and Gods blessing upon it, and the
revelations or the suppplyes of matter in holy Scripture, will be very far to
seek, having neither reason, promise, nor experience of his side. For why
should the spirit of Prayer be any other than as the gift and spirit of says
(as S. Paul calls it, 2 Cor. 4. 13) acquired by humane means using divine
aids? that is, by our endeavors in hearing, reading, Catechizing, desires to
obey, and all this blessed and promoted by God, this produces faith. And if the
spirit of Prayer be of greater consequence, and has a promise of a special
prerogative, let the first be proved, and the second be shown in any good
record, and then I will believe it too.

4. And the parallel of this Argument I the rather urge, because Numb. 16.
I find praying in the holy Ghost joined with graces, which are as much Gods
gifts and productions of the spirit as any thing in the world, and yet which
the Apostle presses upon us as duties and things put into our power, and to be
improved by our industry, and those are faith (in which I before instanced) and
charity, Epist. Jud. ver. 20. But ye (beloved) building up your selves on your
most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost, keep your selves in the love of
God. All of the same consideration, Faith, and Prayer and Charity, all gifts of
the Spirit, and yet build up your selves in faith, and keep your selves in love
and therefore by a parity of reason, improve your selves in the spirit of
prayer, that is, God by his Spirit having supplied us with matter, let our
industry and co-operations per modum naturae, improve these gifts, and build
upon this foundation.

So that in effect, praying in the holy Ghost or with the Spirit, Numb. 17.
is nothing but prayer for such things and in such manner which God by his
Spirit has taught us in holy Scripture. Holy prayers, spiritual songs, so the
Apostle calls one part of prayer, viz. Eucharisticall or thanksgiving, that is,
prayers or songs which are spiritual in materia. And if they be called
spiritual for the efficient cause too, the holy Ghost being the Author of
them, it comes all to one, for therefore he is the cause and giver of them,
because he has in his word revealed, what things we are to pray for, and there
also has taught us the manner.

And this is exactly the Doctrine I plainly gather from the objected Numb. 18.
words of Saint Paul, (The spirit helps our infirmities) How so? it follows
immediately, For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: So that
therefore he is the Spirit of supplication and prayer, because he teaches us
what to ask, and how to pray, so he helps our infirmities, (...), it is in the
Greek Collaborantem adjuvat. It is an ingeminate expression of helping us in
our labors together with him. Now he that shall say this is not sufficiently
done by Gods Spirit in Scripture by Prayers, and Psalms, and Hymns, and
Spiritual Songs, and precepts concerning prayer, set down in that holy
repository of truth and devotion, undervalues that inestimable treasure of the
Spirit; and if it be sufficiently done there, he that will multiply his hopes
farther, then what is sufficient, may possibly deceive himself, but never
deceive God, and make him multiply and continue miracles, to justify his fancy.

5. Better it is to follow the Scriptures for our guide, as in all Numb. 19.
things else, so in this particular, Ephesians. 6. 17, 18. Take the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God. Praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the spirit. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit; praying
in the Spirit is one way of using it, indeed the only way that he here
specifies. Praying in the Spirit then being the using of this Sword, and this
Sword being the Word of God, it follows evidently, that praying in the Spirit,
is praying in or according to the Word of God, that is, in the directions,
rules and expresses of the Word of God, that is, of the holy Scriptures.

The sum is this. Whatsoever this gift is, or this spirit of Numb. 20.
Prayer, it is to be acquired by humane industry, by learning of the
Scriptures, by reading, by conference, and by whatsoever else faculties are
improved, and habits enlarged. Gods Spirit has done his work sufficiently this
way, and he loves not either in nature or grace (which are his two great
sanctions) to multiply miracles when there is no need.

6. So that now I demand, Whether or no, since the expiration Numb. 21.
of the Age of Miracles, does not Gods Spirit most assist us, when we most
endeavor and most use the means? He that says, No, discourages all men from
reading the Scriptures, from industry, from meditation, from conference, from
humane Arts and Sciences, and from whatsoever else God and good Laws provoke
us to by proposition of rewards: But if, Yea, (as most certainly God will best
crown the best endeavors) then the spirit of Prayer is greatest in him, who
(supposing the like capacities and opportunities) studies hardest, reads most,
practices most religiously, deliberates most prudently; and then by how much
want of means is worse then the use of means, by so much ex tempore Prayers
are worse then deliberate and studied. Excellent therefore is the council of
S. Peter, 1 Ep. Chap. 4. ver. 11. If any man speak, let him speak as the
Oracles of God, (not lightly then and inconsiderately) If any man minister, let
him do it as of the ability which God gives: (great reason then to put all
his abilities and faculties to it) and whether of the two does most likely do
that, he that takes pains, and considers, and discusses, and so approves and
practices a form, or he that never considers what he says, till he says it,
needs not much deliberation to pass a sentence.

7. Lastly, did not the Penmen of the Scripture, write the Epistles and Gospels
respectively all by the Spirit? Most certainly, Numb. 22.
holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost, says Saint Peter.
And certainly they were moved by a more immediate motion, and a motion nearer
to an Enthusiasme, then now adays in the gift and spirit of Prayer. And yet in
the midst of those great assistances and motions they did use study, art,
industry, and humane abilities. This is more then probable in the different
styles of the several Books, some being of admirable art, others lower and
plain. The words were their own, at least sometimes, not the holy Ghosts. And
if the Fathers and Grammarians were not deceived by false Copies, but that they
truly did observe, sometimes to be propriety of expression in the language,
sometimes not true Greek, who will think those errors or imperfections in
Grammar, were (in respect of the words I say precisely) immediate inspirations
and dictates of the holy Ghost, and not rather their own productions of
industry and humanity? But clearly some of their words were the words of
Aratus, some of Epimenides, some of Menander, some of Saint Paul, [This speak
I, not the Lord, 1 Cor. 7.] and yet because the holy Ghost renewed their
memory, improved their understanding, supplied to some their want of humane
learning, and so assisted them that they should not commit an error in fact or
opinion, neither in the narrative nor dogmaticall parts, therefore they writ by
the Spirit. Since then we cannot pretend upon any grounds of probability to an
inspiration so immediate as theirs, and yet their assistances which they had
from the Spirit did not exclude humane arts, and industry, but that the ablest
Scholar did write the best, much rather is this true in the gifts and
assistances we receive, and particularly in the gift of Prayer, it is not an ex
tempore and an inspired faculty, but the faculties of nature and the abilities
of art and industry are improved and ennobled by the supervening assistances of
the Spirit.

And now let us take a man that pretends he has the gift of Numb. 23.
Prayer, and loves to pray ex tempore, I suppose his thoughts go a little
before his tongue; I demand then, Whether cannot this man, when it is once come
into his head, hold his tongue, and write down what he has conceived? If his
first conceptions were of God, and Gods Spirit, then they are so still, even
when they are written. Or is the Spirit departed from him, upon the sight of a
pen and Ink-horn? It did use to be otherwise among the old and new Prophets,
whether they were Prophets of Prediction, or of ordinary Ministry. But if his
conception may be written, and being written is still a production of the
Spirit, then it follows that set-forms of Prayer deliberate and described, may
as well be a praying with the Spirit, as sudden forms and ex tempore out lets.

Now the case being thus put, I would feign know what the difference is between
deliberate and ex tempore Prayers, save Numb. 24.
only that in these there is less consideration and prudence; for that the
other are (at least as much as them) the productions of the Spirit, is evident
in the very case put in this very Argument: and whether to consider and to
weigh them, be any disadvantage to our devotions, I leave it to all wise men to
determine. So that in effect, since after the pretended assistance of the
Spirit in our Prayers, we may write them down, consider them, try the spirits,
and ponder the manner, the reason and the religion of the address; let the
world judge whether this sudden utterance and ex tempore forms be any thing
else, but a direct resolution not to consider beforehand what we speak.

But let us look a little further into the mystery, and see what Numb. 25.
is meant in Scripture by praying with the Spirit. In what sense the holy Ghost
is called the spirit of Prayer, I have already shown, viz. by the same reason,
as he is the spirit of faith, of prudence, of knowledge, of understanding, and
the like. But praying with the spirit has besides this other senses also in
Scripture. I find in one place, that then we pray with the Spirit, when the
holy Ghost does actually excite us to desires and earnest tendencies to the
obtaining our holy purposes, when he gives us zeal and devotion, charity and
fervor, spiritual violence and holy importunity. This sense is also in the
latter part of the objected words of Saint Paul, Romans 8. The Spirit it self
makes intercession for us with groanings, etc. Indeed this is truly a praying
in the spirit; but this will do our reverend Brethren of the Assembly little
advantage as to the present Question. For this spirit is not a spirit of
utterance; not at all clamorous in the ears of the people, but cries loud in
the ears of God with [groanes unutterable] so it follows, and only [He that
searches the heart, he understands the meaning of the spirit.] This is the
spirit of the Son, which God has sent into our hearts, (not into our tongues)
whereby we cry, Abba, Father, Gal. 4. 6. And this is the great (...) for
mental Prayer, which is properly and truly praying by the Spirit.

Another praying with the Spirit I find in that place of S Paul, Numb. 26.
from whence this expression is taken, and commonly used, I will pray with the
spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. Here they are opposed, or
at least declared to be things several and disparate: where by the way
observe, that praying with the spirit, even in sense of Scripture, is not
always most to edification of the people. Not always with understanding. And
when these two are separated, St Paul prefers five words with understanding,
before ten thousand in the spirit. For this praying with the spirit was indeed
then a gift extraordinary and miraculous, like as prophesying with the spirit,
and expired with it. But while it did last, it was the lowest of gifts, Inter
dona linguarum, it was but a gift of the tongue, and not to be the benefit of
the Church directly or immediately.

By the way only. If Saint Paul did so undervalve the praying Numb. 27.
with the Spirit, that he preferred edifying the Church a thousand degrees
beyond it. I suppose he would have been of the same mind, if this Question had
been between praying with the Spirit and obeying our superiors, as he was when
it was between praying with the Spirit and edification of the Church, because
(if I be not mistaken) it is matter of great concernment toward the
edification of the Church to obey our superiors, not to innovate in public
forms of worship, especially with the scandal and offense of very wise and
learned men, and to the disgrace of the dead Martyrs, who sealed our Liturgy
with their blood.

But to return. In this place praying with the Spirit, is no Numb. 28.
more then my spirit praying. For so S. Paul joins them as terms identicall,
and expressive one of another meaning, as you may please to read ver. 14. and
15. 1 Cor. 14. I will pray with the Spirit, and my Spirit truly prays. It is
the act of our inner man, praying holy and spiritual Prayers. But then indeed
at that time there was something extraordinary joined, for it was in an unknown
tongue, the practice of which S. Paul there dislikes. This also will be to none
of their purposes. For whether it were ex tempore, or by premeditation, is not
here expressed; or if it had, yet that assistance extraordinary in prayer, if
there was any beside the gift of tongues (which I much doubt) is no more
transmitted to us, then the speaking tongues in the spirit, or prophesying ex
tempore and by the spirit.

But I would add also one experiment which S. Paul also there adds by way of
instance. If praying with the spirit in this place Numb. 29.
be praying ex tempore, then so is singing too. For they are expressed in the
same place, in the same manner, to the same end, and I know no reason why there
should be differing senses put upon them to serve purposes. And now let us have
some Churchmusick too, though the Organs be pulled down, and let any the best
Psalmist of them all, compose a hymn in metricall form, and sing it to a new
tune with perfect and true music, and all this ex tempore. For all this the
holy Ghost can do if he pleases. But if it be said that the Corinthian
Christians composed their songs and hymns according to art and rules of
music, by study and industry, and that to this they were assisted by the
Spirit; and that this together with the devotion of their spirit, was singing
with the spirit, then say I, so composing set forms of Lyturgy by skill and
prudence, and humane industry, may be as much praying with the spirit as the
other is singing with the spirit. Plainly enough. In all the senses of praying
with the spirit, and in all its acceptations in Scripture, to pray or sing with
the spirit, neither of them of necessity implies ex tempore.

The sum or Collecta of the premises is this, Praying with Numb. 30.
the spirit, is either when the spirit stirs up our desires to pray, Per
motionem actualis auxilii, or when the spirit teaches us what, or how to pray,
telling us the matter, and manner of our prayers. Or lastly, dictating the very
words of our prayers. There is no other way in the world to pray with the
spirit, or in the holy Ghost, that is pertinent to this Question. And of this
last manner the Scripture determines nothing, nor speaks any thing expressly
of it, and yet suppose it had, we are certain the holy Ghost has supplied us
with all these, and yet in set forms of prayer best of all, I mean there
where a difference can be. For as for the desires, and actual motions or
incitements to pray, they are indifferent to one or the other, to set-forms or
to ex tempore. 2. But as to the matter and manner of prayer, it is clearly
contained in the expresses, and set forms of Scriptures, and it is supplied to
us by the spirit, for he is the great Dictator of it.

Now then for the very words. No man can assure me that the Numb. 31.
words of his ex tempore prayer are the words of the holy Spirit: it is not
reason nor modesty to expect such immediate assistances to so little purpose,
he having supplied us with abilities more then enough to express our desires
aliunde, otherwise then by immediate dictate. But if we will take David's
Psalter, or the other hymns of holy Scripture, or any of the Prayers which are
respersed over the Bible, we are sure enough that they are the words of Gods
Spirit, mediately or immediately, by way of infusion or ecstasy, by vision, or
at least by ordinary assistance. And now then, what greater confidence can any
man have for the excellency of his Prayer, and the probability of their being
accepted, then when he prays his Psalter, or the Lords Prayer, or another
office which he finds consigned in Scripture? When Gods Spirit stirs us up to
an actual devotion, and then we use the matter he has described and taught,
and the very words which Christ, and Christ's Spirit, and the Apostles, and
other persons full of the holy Ghost did use; if in the world there be any
praying with the Spirit, (I mean in vocal prayer) this is it.

And thus I have examined the entire and full scope of this Question, and
rifled their Objection. Now I shall proceed to some few Arguments which are
more extrinsecall to the nature of the thing.

It is a practice prevailing among those of our Brethren that are Numb. 32.
zealous for ex tempore prayers, to pray their Sermons over, to reduce their
doctrine into Devotion and Lyturgy. I mislike it not for the thing it self, if
it were done regularly for the manner, and the matter were always pious and
true. But who shall assure me when the preacher has disputed, or rather
dogmatically decreed a point of predestination, or of prescience, of
contingency, or of liberty, or any of the most mysterious parts of Divinity,
and then prays his Sermon over, that he then prays with the Spirit? Unless I
be sure that he also preached with the Spirit, I cannot be sure that he prays
with the spirit, for all he prays ex tempore. Nay, if I hear a Protestant
preach in the morning, and an Anabaptist in the afternoon, to day a
Presbyterian, to morrow an Independent, am I not most sure that when they have
preached Contradictories, and all of them pray their Sermons over, that they
do not all pray with the spirit? More than one in this case cannot pray with
the spirit, possibly all may pray against him.

2. From whence I thus argue in behalf of set forms of Numb. 33.
prayer. That in the case above put, how shall I or any man else say Amen to
their prayers that preach and pray contradictories? At least I am much hindered
in my devotion. For besides that, it derives our opinions into our devotions,
makes every school point become our religion, and makes God a party, (so far
as we can) intitling him to our impertinent wranglings. Besides this, I say,
while we should attend to our addresses toward God, we are to consider whether
the point be true or no, and by that time we have tacitly discoursed it, we are
upon another point which also perhaps is as Questionable as the former, and by
this time our spirit of devotion is a little discomposed and something out of
countenance, there is so much other employment for the spirit, the spirit of
discerning and judging. All which inconveniences are avoided in set forms of
Liturgy. For we know before hand the conditions of our Communion, and to what
we are to say Amen, to which if we like it we may repair; if not, there is no
harm done; your devotion shall not be surprised, nor your Communion invaded, as
it may be and often is in your ex tempore prayers. And this thing has another
collateral inconvenience, which is of great consideration; for upon what
confidence can we solicit any Recusants to come to our Church, where we
cannot promise them that the devotions there to be used, shall be innocent, nor
can we put him into a condition to judge for himself? If he will venture he
may, but we can use no Argument to make him choose our Churches, though he
should quit his own.

3. But again, let us consider with sobriety. Are not those Numb. 34.
prayers and hymns in holy Scripture, excellent compositions, admirable
instruments of devotion, full of piety, rare and incomparable addresses to God?
Dare any man with his gift of prayer pretend, that he can ex tempore or by
study make better? Who dares pretend that he has a better spirit then David
had, or then the Apostles and Prophets, and other holy persons in Scripture,
whose Prayers and Psalms are by Gods Spirit consigned to the use of the Church
for ever? Or will it be denied but that they also are excellent directories and
patterns for prayer? And if patterns, the nearer we draw to our example, are
not the imitations and representments the better? And what then if we took the
samplers themselves, is there any imperfection in them, and can we mend them
and correct Magnificat?

In a just porportion and commensuration, I argue so concerning the primitive
and ancient forms of Church service, which are composed Numb. 35.
according to those so excellent patterns, which if they had remained pure as
in their first institution, or had always been as they have been reformed by
the Church of England, they would against all defiance put in for the next
place to those forms or Liturgy which Mutatis mutandis are nothing but the
Words of Scripture. But I am resolved at this present not to enter into
Question concerning the matter of prayers. But for the form this I say further.

4. That the Church of God has the promise of the spirit made to her in
general, to her in her Catholic and united capacity, Numb. 36.
to the whole Church first, then to particular Churches, then in the lowest
seat of the Category to single persons. Now then I infer, if any single persons
will have us to believe without all possibility of proof (for so it must be)
that they pray with the Spirit, (for how shall they be able to prove the spirit
actually to abide in those single persons) then much rather must we believe it
of the Church, which by how much the more general it is, so much the more of
the spirit she is likely to have; and then if there be no errors in the
matter, the Church has the advantage and probability on her side, and if there
be an error in matter in either of them, they fail of their pretenses,
neither of them have the spirit. But the public spirit in all reason is to be
trusted before the private, when there is a contestation, the Church being
Prior and potior in premissis, she has a greater and prior title to the
spirit. And why the Church has not the spirit of prayer in her compositions as
well as any of her children, I desire once for all to be satisfied upon true
grounds either of reason or revelation.

5. Or if the Church shall be admitted to have the gift, and the spirit of
prayer given unto her by virtue of the great promise Numb. 37.
of the spirit, to abide with her for ever, yet for all this she is taught to
pray in a set form of prayer, and yet by the spirit too. For what think we?
When Christ taught us to pray in that incomparable model, the Lords Prayer, if
we pray that prayer devoutly, and with pious and actual intention, do we not
pray in the Spirit of Christ, as much as if we prayed any other form of words
pretended to be taught us by the Spirit? We are sure that Christ and Christ's
Spirit taught us this Prayer; they only gather by conjectures and opinions,
that in their ex tempore forms the spirit of Christ teaches them. So much then
as certainties are better then uncertaines, and God above man, so much is this
set form (besides the infinite advantages in the matter) better then their ex
tempore forms in the form it self.

6. If I should descend to minutes and particulars, I could instance Numb. 38.
in the behalf of set forms, that God prescribed to Moses a set form of prayer
and benediction to be used when he did bless the people. 7. That Moses
composed a song or hymn for the children of Israel to use to all their
generations. 8. That David composed many for the service of the tabernacle. 9.
That Solomon and the holy Kings of Judah brought them in and continued them in
the ministration of the temple. 10. That all Scripture is written for our
learning, and since all these and many more set forms of prayer are left there
upon record, it is more then probable that they were left there for our use and
devotion. 11. That S. John Baptist taught his Disciples a form of prayer. 12.
And that Christ's Disciples begged the same favor, and it was granted as they
desired it. 13. And that Christ gave it not only in massa materiae, but in
forma verborum; not in a confused heap of matter, but in an exact composure of
words, it makes it evident, he intended it not only pro regula petendorum, for
a direction of what things we are to ask, but also pro forma orationis, for a
set form of Prayer. In which also I am most certainly confirmed (besides the
universal testimony of Gods Church so attesting it) in the precept which
Christ added, When ye pray, pray after this manner: and indeed it points not
the matter only of our prayers, but the form of it, the manner and the matter
of the address both. But in the repetition of it by Saint Luke, the preceptive
words seem to limit us, and direct us to this very form of words, when ye
pray, say, Our Father, etc. 14. I could also add the example of all the Jews,
and by consequence of our blessed Savior, who sung a great part of David's
Psalter in their feast of Passover, which part is called by the Jews the
great Hallelujah, it begins at the 113 Psalm, and ends at the 118 inclusively.
And the Scripture mentions it as part of our blessed Saviors devotion, and of
his Disciples, that they sung a Psalm. 15. That this afterward became a
Precept Evangelicall, that we should praise God in Hymns, Psalms, and
spiritual Songs, which is a form of Liturgy, in which we sing with the spirit,
but yet cannot make our Hymns ex tempore, (it would be wild stuff if we
should go about it.) 16. And lastly, that a set form of worship and address
to God was recorded by Saint John, and sung in heaven, and it was Apoc. 15.
composed out of the songs of Moses, (Exodus 15.) of David, Psalm. 145.) and of
Jeremy, (Chap. 10. 6, 7.) which certainly is a very good precedent for us to
imitate, although but revealed to Saint John by way of vision and ecstasy. All
which and many more are to me as so many Arguments of the use, excellency, and
necessity of set forms of Prayer for public Liturgies, and of greatest
conveniencie, even for private devotions.

17. And so the Church of God in all Ages did understand it. Numb. 39.
I shall not multiply Authorities to this purpose, for they are too many and
various; but shall only observe two great instances of their belief and
practice in this particular. 1. The one is the perpetual use and great
Eulogies of the Lords Prayer, assisted by the many Commentaries of the Fathers
upon it. 2. The other is that solemn form of benediction and mystical prayer
(as Saint Augustine calls it, Lib. 3. de Trinit. c. 4.) which all Churches (and
themselves said it was by Ordinance Apostolical) used in the Consecration of
the blessed Sacrament. But all of them used the Lords Prayer in the Canon, and
office of Consecration, and other prayers taken from Scripture, (so Justin
Martyr testifies, that the Consecration is made per preces verbi Dei, by the
prayers taken from the Word of God) and the whole Canon was short, determined
and mysterious.

Who desires to be further satisfied in this particular, shall Numb. 40.
find enough in Walafridus Strabo, Aymonius, Cassander, Elacius Illyrious,
Josephus Vicecomes, and the other Ritualists, and the other Ritualists, and in
the old offices themselves. So that I need not put you in mind of that famous
doxology of Gloria Patria, etc. nor the Trisagion, nor any of those memorable
hymns used in the Ancient Church, so knownly and frequently, that the
beginning of them came to be their name, and they were known more by their own
words, then the Authors inscription.

At last when some men that thought themselves better gifted Numb. 41.
would be venturing at conceived forms of their own, there was a timely
restraint made in the Council of Milevis in Africa, Placuit ut preces quae
probatae fuerint in Concilio ab omnibus celebrentur, nec aliae omnino dicantur
in Ecclesia, nisi quae a prudentioribus factae fuerint in Synodo. That Is the
restraint and prohibition, public prayers must be such as are publicly
appointed, and prescribed by our Superiors; and no private forms of our
conceiving must be used in the Church. The reason follows, Ne forte aliquid
contra fidem, vel per ignorantiam, vel per minus studium sit compositum: Lest
through ignorance or want of deliberation any thing be spoken in our prayers
against faith [and good manners.] The reason is good, and they are
eare-witnesses of it that hear the variety of prayers before and after Sermons,
there, where the Directory is practiced, where (to speak most modestly) not
only their private opinions, but also humane interests, and their own personal
concernments, and wild fancies, born perhaps not two days before, are made the
objects of the peoples hopes, of their desires, and their prayers, and all in
the mean time pretend to the holy Spirit.

I will not now instance in the vainglory that is appendant Numb. 42.
to these ex tempore forms of prayer, where the gift of the man is more then
the devotion of the man: nor will I consider that then his gift is best, when
his prayer is longest: and if he take a complacency in his gift (as who is not
apt to do it?) he will be sure to extend his Prayer, till a suspicious and
scrupulous man would be apt to say, his prayer pressed hard upon that which our
blessed Savior reprehended in the Pharisees, who thought to be heard for
their much babbling. But these things are accidental to the nature of the
thing. And therefore though they are too certainly consequent to the person,
yet I will not be too severe, but preserve my self on the surer side of
charitable construction, which truly I desire to keep, nor only to their
persons whom I much reverence, but also to their actions. But yet I durst not
do the same thing, even for these last reasons, though I had no other.

But it is objected, that in set forms of Prayer, we restrain and Numb. 43.
confine the blessed Spirit; and in conceived forms, when every man is left to
his liberty, then the Spirit is free, unlimited and unconstrained.

I answer, either their conceived forms (I use their own words, Numb. 44.
though indeed the expression is very inartificiall) are premeditate and
described or they are ex tempore. If they be premeditate and described, then
the Spirit is as much limited in their conceived forms as in the Churches
conceived forms. For as to this particular, it is all one who describes and
limits the form, whether the Church, or a single man does it, still the Spirit
is in constraint and limit. So that in this case they are not angry at set
forms of Prayer, but that they do not make them. And if it be replied, that if
a single person composes a set form, he may alter it if he please, and so his
spirit is at liberty. I answer, so may the Church, if she see cause for it: and
unless there be cause the single person will not alter it, unless he do
things unreasonable and without cause. So that it will be an unequal and a
peevish quarrel to allow of set forms of prayer made by private persons, and
not of set forms made by the public spirit of the Church. It is evident, that
the Spirit is limited in both alike.

But if by [Conceived forms] in this objection they mean Numb. 45.
ex tempore prayers (for so they most generally practice it) and that in the
use of these the liberty of the spirit is best preserved. To this I answer,
that the being ex tempore or premeditate will be wholly impertinent to this
Question of limiting the spirit. For there may be great liberty in set forms,
even when there is much variety; and there may be great restraint in ex tempore
prayers, even then when it shall be called unlawful to use set forms. That the
spirit is restrained, or that it is free in either, is accidental to them
both; for it may be either free or not free in both as it may happen.

But the restraint is this, that every one is not left to his liberty Numb. 46.
to pray how he list, (with premeditation or without, it makes not much matter)
but that he is prescribed unto by the spirit of another. But if it be a fault
thus to restrain the spirit, I would feign know, is not the spirit restrained
when the whole Congregation shall be confined to the form of this one man's
composing? or it shall be unlawful, or at least a disgrace and disparagement
to use any set forms, especially of the Churches composition. More plainly thus.

2. Does not the Minister confine and restrain the spirit of the Lords People,
when they are tied to his form? It would Numb. 47.
sound of more liberty to their spirits, that every one might make a prayer of
his own and all pray together; and not be forced or confined to the Ministers
single dictate, and private spirit. It is true, it would breed confusions, and
therefore they might pray silently till the Sermon began, and not for the
avoiding one inconvenience run into a greater, and to avoid the disorder of a
popular noise restrain the blessed Spirit; for even in this case as well as in
the other, Where the spirit of God is, there must be liberty.

3. If the spirit must be at liberty, who shall assure us this liberty must be
in forms of prayer? And if so, whether also it Numb. 48.
must be in public prayer, and will it not suffice that it be in private? And
if in public prayers, is not the liberty of the spirit sufficiently preserved
in that the public spirit is free? That is, the Church has power upon
occasion to alter and increase her Litanyes. By what Argument shall any man
make it so much as probable, that the holy Ghost is injured, if every private
Ministers private spirit shall be guided (and therefore by necessary
consequence limited) by the Authority of the Churches public spirit?

4. Does not the Directory that thing which is here called restraining Numb. 49.
of the spirit? Does it not appoint every thing but the words? And after this
is it not a goodly Palladium that is contended for, and a princely liberty that
they leave unto the Spirit, to be free only in the supplying the place of a
Vocabulary and a Copia Verborum? For as for the matter, it is all there
described and appointed, and to those determined senses the spirit must assist
or not at all only for the words he shall take his choice. Now I desire it may
be considered sadly and seriously: Is it not as much injury to the spirit to
restrain his matter, as to appoint his words? Which is the more considerable
of the two, sense or Language, Matter or Words? I mean when they are taken
singly and separately. For so they may very well be (for as if men prescribe
the matter only, the spirit may cover it with several words and expressions,
so if the spirit prescribe the words, I may still abound in variety of sense,
and preserve the liberty of my meaning; we see that true in the various
interpretations of the same words of Scripture.) So that in the greater of the
two, the Spirit is restrained, when his matter is appointed, and to make him
amends, for not trusting him with the matter without our directions and
limitations, we trust him to say what he pleases, so it be to our sense, to our
purposes. A goodly compensation surely!

5. Did not Christ restrain the spirit of his Apostles, when he Numb. 50.
taught them to pray the Lords Prayer, whether his precept to his Disciples
concerning it, was Pray this, or Pray thus, Pray these words, or pray after
this manner? or though it had been less then either, and been only a Directory
for the matter, still it is a thing which our Brethren in all other cases of
the same nature are resolved perpetually to call a restraint. Certainly then
this pretended restraint, is no such formidable thing. These men themselves do
it by directing all the matter, and much of the manner, and Christ himself did
it, by prescribing both the matter, and the words too.

6. These restraints (as they are called) or determinations of the Spirit are
made by the Spirit himself. For I demand, when Numb. 51.
any Assembly of Divines appointed the matter of Prayers to all particular
Ministers as this has done, is that appointment by the Spirit or no? If no,
then for ought appears, this Directory not being made by Gods Spirit, may be an
enemy to it. But if this appointment be by the Spirit, then the determination
and limitation of the Spirit, is by the Spirit himself, and such indeed is
every pious and prudent constitution of the Church in matters spiritual: Such
as was that of S. Paul to the Corinthians, when he prescribed orders for
public prophesying, and interpretation, and speaking with tongues. The spirit
of some he so restrained, that he bound them to hold their peace, he permitted
but two or three to speak at one meeting, the rest were to keep silence, though
possibly six or seven might at that time have the Spirit.

7. Is it not a restraint of the Spirit to sing a Psalm in meeter by
appointment? Clearly as much as appointing forms of Numb. 52.
prayer or Eucharist. And yet that we see done daily, and no scruple made. Is
not this to be partial in judgment, and inconsiderate of what we do?

8. And now after all this strife, what harm is there in restraining the spirit
in the present sense? What prohibition, what law, Numb. 53.
what reason or revelation is against it? What inconvenience in the nature of
the thing? For can any man be so weak as to imagine a despite is done to the
spirit of grace, when those gifts to his Church are used regularly and by
order? As if prudence were no gift of Gods spirit, as if helps in Government,
and the ordering spiritual matters were none of those graces which Christ when
he ascended up on high gave unto Men. But this whole matter is wholly a
stranger to reason, and never seen in Scripture.

For Divinity never knew any other vicious restraining of the Spirit, but
either suppressing those holy incitements to virtue and Numb. 54.
good life, which Gods Spirit ministers to us externally or internally, or else
a forbidding by public Authority the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, to
speak such truths as God has commended, and so taking away the liberty of
Prophesying. The first is directly vicious In materia speciale, the second is
tyrannical and Antichristian. And to it persecution of true Religion is to be
reduced. But as for this pretended limiting or restraining the spirit, viz. by
appointing a regular form of prayer, it is so very a Chimera, that it has no
footing or foundation upon any ground where a wise man may build his confidence.

9. But lastly, how if the spirit must be restrained, and that by Numb. 55.
precept Apostolical? That calls us to a new account. But if it be not true,
what means S. Paul, by saying The spirits of the Prophets must be subject to
the Prophets? What greater restraint then subjection? If subjected, then they
must be ruled; if ruled, then limited, prescribed unto, and as much under
restraint as the spirits of the superior Prophets shall judge convenient. I
suppose by this time this objection will trouble us no more. But perhaps
another will.

For why are not the Ministers to be left as well to their liberty in making
their Prayers as their Sermons? I answer, the Numb. 56.
Church may if she will, but whether she does well or no, let her consider.
This I am sure, there is not the same reason, and I fear the experience the
world has already had of it, will make demonstration enough of the
inconvenience. But however the differences are many.

1. Our prayers offered up by the Minister, are in behalf and in the name of
the people, and therefore great reason they should know beforehand, what is to
be presented, that if they like not the message, they may refuse to
communicate; especially since people are so divided in their opinions, in their
hopes, and in their faiths: it being a duty to refuse Communion with those
prayers which they think to have in them the matter of sin or doubting. Which
reason on the other part ceases, for the Minister being to speak from God to
the people, if he speaks what he ought not, God can right himself, however is
not partner of the sin, as in the other case, the people possibly may be.

2. It is more fit a liberty be left in preaching then praying, Numb. 58.
because the address of our discourses and exhortations are to be made
according to the understanding and capacity of the audience, their prejudices
are to be removed, all advantages to be taken, and they are to be surprised
that way they lie most open [But being crafty I caught you, says Saint Paul to
the Corinthians] and discourses and arguments ad hominem, upon their particular
principles and practices may more move them then the most polite and accurate
that do not comply and wind about their fancies and affections. S. Paul from
the absurd practice of being baptized for the dead, made an excellent Argument
to convince the Corinthians of the Resurrection. But this reason also ceases in
our prayers. For God understands what we say sure enough, he has no
prejudices to be removed, no infirmities to be wrought upon, and a fine figure
of Rhetoric, a pleasant cadence, and a curious expression, move not him at
all; no other twinings and complyances stir him but charity, and humility,
and zeal, and importunity, which all are things internal and spiritual. And
therefore of necessity there is to be great variety of discourses to the
people, and permissions accordingly, but not so to God, with whom a Deus
miserere prevails as soon as the great office of 40 hours not long since
invented in the Church of Rome, or any other prayers spun out to a length
beyond the extension of the office of a Pharisee.

3. I fear it cannot stand with our reverence to God, to permit Numb. 59.
to every spirit a liberty of public address to him in behalf of the people.
Indeed he that is not fit to pray, is not always fit to preach; but it is more
safe to be bold with the people then with God, if the persons be not so fit. In
that there may be indiscretion, but there may be impiety and irreligion in this
The people may better excuse and pardon an indiscretion or a rudeness (if any
such should happen) then we may venture to offer it to God.

4. There is a latitude of Theology, much whereof is left to Numb. 60.
us, so, without precise and clear determination, that without breach either of
faith or charity, men may differ in opinion: and if they may not be permitted
to abound in their own sense, they will be apt to complain of tyranny over
consciences, and that men Lord it over their faith. In Prayer this thing is so
different, that it is imprudent and full of inconvenience to derive such things
into our prayers, which may with good profit be matter of Sermons. Therefore
here a liberty may well enough be granted, when there it may better be denied.

5. But indeed, if I may freely declare my opinion, I think Numb. 61.
it were not amiss if the liberty of making Sermons were something more
restrained then it is, and that either such persons only were entrusted with
liberty for whom the Church her self may safely be responsall, that is, to
men learned and pious, and that the other part, the Vulgus Cleri, should
instruct the people out of the fountains of the Church, and upon the public
stock, till by so long exercise and discipline in the Schools of the Prophets,
they may also be entrusted to minister of their own unto the people. This I am
sure was the practice of the Primitive Church when Preaching was as ably and
religiously performed as now it is. But in this I prescribe nothing. But truly
I think the reverend Divines of the Assembly are many of my mind in this
particular, and that they observe a liberty indulged to some persons to preach,
which I think they had rather should hold their peace, and yet think the Church
better edified in your silence then their Sermons.

6. But yet me thinks the Argument objected, if it were Numb. 62.
turned with the edge the other way would have more reason in it: and instead
of arguing [Why should not the same be allowed in praying as in preaching] it
were better to substitute this. If they can pray with the spirit, why also do
they not preach with the spirit? and if praying with the spirit be praying ex
tempore, why shall they not preach ex tempore too, or else confess that they
preach without the spirit, or that they have not the gift of Preaching? For to
say that the gift of prayer, is a gift ex tempore, but the gift of Preaching is
with study and deliberation, is to become vain and impertinent. Quis enim
discrevit? Who has made them of a different consideration? I mean as to this
particular, as to their efficient cause. Nor reason, nor revelation, nor God,
nor man.

To sum up all. If any man has a mind to exercise his Numb. 63.
gift of Prayer, let him set himself to work, and compose Books of Devotion,
(we have great need of them in the Church of England, so apparent need, that
the Papists have made it an objection against us) and this his gift of Prayer
will be to edification. But otherwise, I understand it is more fit for
ostentation, then any spiritual advantage. For God hears us not the sooner for
our ex tempore, long, or conceived prayers; possibly they may become a
hindrance, as in the cases before instanced. And I am sure if the people be
intelligent, and can discern, they are hindered in their Devotion, for they dare
not say Amen till they have considered; and many such cases will occur in ex
tempore prayers, that need much considering before we attest them. But if the
people be not intelligent, they are apt to swallow all the inconveniences
which may multiply in so great a license; and therefore it were well that the
Governors of the Church who are to answer for their souls, should judge for
them, before they say Amen, which judgment cannot be without set-forms of
Liturgy. My sentence therefore is, (...), Let us be as we are already. Few
changes are for the better.

For if it be pretended, that in the Liturgy of the Church of Numb. 64.
England, which was composed with much art and judgment by a Church that has
as much reason to be confident she has the Spirit and gifts of Prayer, as any
single person has, and each learned man that was at its first composition, can
as much prove that he had the Spirit, as the objectors now adays: (and he that
boasts most, certainly has the least.) If I say it be pretended, there are
many errors and inconveniences both in the order and the matter of the
Common Prayer Book, made by such men, with so much industry: How much more, and
with how much greater reason may we all dread the inconveniences and disorders
of ex tempore prayers? where there is neither conjunction of heads, nor
premeditation, nor industry, nor method, nor art, nor any of those things (or
at least not in the same degree) which were likely to have exempted the
Common Prayer Book from errors and disorders. If these things be in the green
tree, what will be done in the dry?

But if it be said, the ex tempore and conceived prayers will Numb. 65.
be secured from error by the Directory, because that chalks them out the
matter. I answer, it is not sufficient, because if when men study both the
matter and the words too, they may be (and it is pretended are actually)
erroneous; much more may they when the matter is left much more at liberty, and
the words under no restraint at all. And no man can avoid the pressure and the
weight of this, unless the Compilers of the Directory were infallible, and
that all their followers were so too, of the certainty of which I am not yet
fully satisfied.

And after all this I would fain know, what benefit and advantages Numb. 66.
shall the Church of England in her united capacity, and every particular in
the diffused capacity receive by this new device? For the public it is clear,
that whether the Ministers pray before they study, or study before they pray,
there must needs be infinite deformity in the public worship, and all the
benefits which were before the consequents of conformity and unity, will be
lost, and if they be not valuable, I leave it to all them to consider, who know
the inconveniences of public disunion, and the public disunion that is
certainly consequent to them who do not communicate in any common forms of
worship. And to think that the Directory will bring conformity, is as if one
should say, that all who are under the same Hemisphere are joined in communi
patria, and will love like Countrymen; for under the Directory there will be as
different Religions, and as different desires, and as differing forms as there
are several varieties of men and manners under the one half of heaven, who
yet breath under the same half of the Globe. But I ask again, what benefit can
the public receive by this form, or this no form, for I know not whether to
call it. Shall the matter of prayers be better in all Churches? shall God be
better served? shall the word of God and the best patterns of prayers be
always exactly followed? It is well if it be. But there is security given us
by the Directory; for the matter is left at every man's dispose for all that,
and we must depend upon the honesty of every particular for it; and if any man
proves a Heretic, or a Knave, then he may introduce what impiety he please,
into the public forms of Gods worship; and there is no law made to prevent
it, and it must be cured afterward if it can; but beforehand it is not
prevented at all by the Directory, which trusts every man. But I observe, that
all the benefit which is pretended, is, that it will make an able Ministry,
which I confess I am very much from believing, and so will every man be that
considers what kind of men they are that have been most zealous for that way of
conceived prayer. I am sure that very few of the learned, very many
ignorants, most those who have made least abode in the Schools of the Prophets.
And that I may disgrace no man's person, we see Tradesmen of the most illiberall
arts, and women pretend to it, and do it with as many words (and that is the
maine thing) with as much confidence, and speciousnesse, and spirit, as the
best among them. And it is but a small portion of learning that will serve a
man to make conceived forms of prayer, which they have easily upon the stock
of other men, or upon their own fancy, or upon any thing in which no learning
is required. He that knows nothing of the craft may be in the Preachers trade.
But what? Is God better served? I would feign see any Authority, or any reason,
or any probability for that. I am sure ignorant men offer him none of the best
sacrifices ex tempore, and learned men will be sure to deliberate, and know.
God is then better (...) when he served by a public, then when by a private
(...) I cannot imagine what accruements will hence come to (...) (...): it may
be some advantages may be to the private (...). For there are a sort of men
whom our blessed (...) do devour widows houses, and for a pre(...). They make
prayers, and they make (...) means they receive double advantages, for (...)
to their ability, and to their piety. And although the Common Prayer Book in
the Preface to the Directory be charged with unnecessary length, yet we see
that most of these men, they that are most eminent or would be so, make their
prayers longer, and will not lose the benefits which their credit gets, and
they by their credit, for making their prayers.

Add to this that there is no promise in Scripture, that he who prays ex
tempore shall be heard the better, or that he shall be assisted at all to such
purposes; and therefore to innovate in so high a matter without a warrant to
command us, or a promise to warrant us, is no better then vanity in the thing,
and presumption in the person. He therefore that considers that this way of
prayer is without all manner of precedent in the Primitive Church, against the
example of all famous Churches in all Christendom in the whole descent of 15.
Ages, without all command and warrant of Scripture, that it is unreasonable in
the nature of the thing, against prudence and the best wisdom of humanity,
because it is without deliberation, that it is innovation in a high degree
without that Authority which is truly and by inherent and ancient right to
command and prescribe to us in external forms of worship, that it is much to
the disgrace of the first reformers of our Religion, that it gives
encouragement to the Papists, to quarrel with some reason and more pretense
against our Reformation, as being by the Directory confessed to have been done
in much blindness, and therefore might err in the excess as well as in the
defect, in the throwing out too much, as casting off too little, which is the
more likely, because they wanted zeal to carry it far enough. He that
considers the universal deformity of public worship and the no means of
union, no Symbol of public communion being publicly consigned, that all
Heresies may with the same Authority be brought into our prayers, and offered
to God in behalf of the people, with the same Authority that any truth may all
the matter of our prayers being left to the choice of all men, of all
persuasions, and then observes that actually there are in many places, heresy,
and blasphemy, and impertinency, and illiterate rudenesses put into the
devotions of the most Solemn days, and the most public meetings; and then
lastly, that there are diverse parts of Lyturgy, for which no provisions at all
is made in the Directory, and the very administration of the Sacraments left so
loosely, that if there be any thing essential in the forms of Sacraments the
Sacrament may come ineffectuall by want of due words, and due ministration. I
say, he that considers all these things (and many more he may consider) will
find that particular men are not fit to be entrusted to offer in public with
their private spirit, to God, for the people, in such solemnities, in matters
of so great concernment, where the honor of God, the benefit of the people,
the interest of Kingdoms, the being of a Church, the unity of minds, the
conformity of practice, the truth of persuasions, and the salvation of souls,
are so very much concerned, as they are in the public prayers of a whole
National Church. An unlearned man is not to be trusted, and a wise man dare
not trust himself; he that is ignorant cannot, he that is knowing will not.

LONDON, Printed for RICHARD ROYSTON, at the Angel in Ivie-lane. 1647.

TO THE TRVLY WORTHY AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED Sr CHRISTOPHER HATTON Knight of the
Honorable Order of the BATH.
SIR,
I AM engaged in the defense of a Great Truth, and J would willingly find a
shroud to cover my self from danger, and calumny; and although the cause both
is and ought to be defended by Kings, yet my person must not go thither to
Sanctuary, unless it be to pay my devotion, and I have now no other left for
my defense, I am robbed of that which once did bless me, and indeed still does,
(but in another manner) and I hope will do more; but those distillations of
celestial dewes are conveyed in Channels not pervious to an eye of sense, and
now adays we seldom look with other, be the object never so beauteous or
alluring. You may then think, Sir, I am forced upon You; may that beg my pardon
and excuse, but I should do an injury to Your Nobleness, if I should only
make You a refuge for my need, (pardon this truth) you are also of the fairest
choice, not only for Your love of Learning, (for although that be eminent in
You, yet it is not Your eminence) but for Your duty to H. Church, for Your
loyalty to His sacred Majesty. These did prompt me with the greatest
confidence to hope for Your fair encouragement, and assistance in my pleadings
for Episcopacy, in which cause Religion, and Majesty, the King, and the Church
are interested as parties of mutual concernment.

There was an odd observation made long ago, and registered in the Law to make
it authentic, Laici sunt infensi Clericis. Now the Clergy pray, but fight not,
and therefore if not specially protected by the King contra Ecclesiam
Malignantium, they are made obnoxious to all the contumelies, and injuries,
which an envious multitude will inflict upon them. It was observed enough in
King Edgars time, Quamvis decreta In Charte^ Edgar. Regis. A. D. 485. apud Hen.
Spelman.
Pontificum, and verba Sacerdotum in convulsis ligaminibus velut fundamenta
montium fixa sunt, tamen plerumque tempestatibus, and turbinibus saecularium
rerum Religio S. Matris Ecclesiae maculis reproborum dissipatur, acrumpitur.
Idcirco Decrevimus Nos etc. There was a sad example of it in K. John's time.
For when he threw the Clergy from his Protection, it is incredible what
injuries, what affronts, what robberies, yea what murders were committed upon
the Bishops, and Priests of H. Church, whom neither the Sacredness of their
persons, nor the Laws of God, nor the terrors of Conscience, nor fears of
Hell, nor Church Censures, nor the Laws of Hospitality could protect from
Scorn, from blows, from slaughter. Now there being so near a tie as the
necessity of their own preservation in the midst of so apparent danger, it will
tie the Bishops hearts, and hands to the King faster then all the ties of
Lay-Allegiance, (all the Political ties I mean,) all that are not precisely
religious, and obligations in the Court of Conscience.

2. But the interest of the Bishops is conjunct with the prosperity of the
King, besides the interest of their own security; by the obligation of secular
advantages. For they who have their livelihood from the King, and are in
expectance of their fortune from him are more likely to pay a tribute of
exacter duty, then others, whose fortunes are not in such immediate dependancy
on His Majesty. Aeneas Sylvius once gave a merry reason why Clerks advanced the
Pope above a Council, viz. because the Pope gave spiritual promotions, but
the Councels gave none. It is but the Common expectation of gratitude, that a
Patron Paramount shall be more assisted by his Beneficiaries in cases of
necessity, then by those, who receive nothing from him but the common
influences of Government.

3. But the Bishops duty to the King derives it self from a higher fountain.
For it is one of the maine excellencies in Christianity, that it advances the
State, and well being of Monarchies, and Bodies Politic. Now then the Fathers
of Religion the Reverend Bishops, whose peculiar office it is to promote the
interests of Christianity, are by the nature and essential requisites of their
office bound to promote the Honor and Dignity of Kings, whom Christianity
would have so much honored, as to establish the just subordination of people
to their Prince, upon better principles then ever, no less then their precise
duty to God, and the hopes of a blissful immortality. Here then is utile,
honestum, and necessarium, to tie Bishops in duty to Kings, and a threefold
Cord is not easily broken.

In pursuance of these obligations Episcopacy pays three returns of tribute
to Monarchy.

1. The first is the Duty of their people. For they being by God himself set
over souls, judges of the most secret recesses of our Consciences, and the
venerable Priests under them, have more power to keep men in their duteous
subordination to the Prince, then there is in any secular power, by how much
more forcible the impressions of the Conscience are, then all the external
violence in the world. And this power they have fairly put into act, for there
was never any Protestant Bishop yet in Rebellion, unless he turned recreant to
his Order, and it is the honor of the Church of England, that all her
Children, and obedient people are full of indignation against Rebels, be they
of any interest, or party whatsoever. For here (and for it wethanke God and
good Princes) Episcopacy has been preserved in fair privileges and honor,
and God has blessed and honored Episcopacy with the conjunction of a loyal
people. As if because in the law of Nature the Kingdom and Priesthood were
joined in one person, it were natural, and consonant to the first justice,
that Kings should defend the rights of the Church, and the Church advance the
honor of Kings. And when I consider that the first Bishop that was
exauctorated was a Prince too, Prince, and Bishop of Geneva, me thinks it was
an ill Omen, that the cause of the Prince, and the Bishop should be in
Conjunction ever after.

2. A second return that Episcopacy makes to Royalty is that which is the Duty
of all Christians, the paying tributes, and impositions. And though all the
Kings Liege people do it, yet the issues of their duty, and liberality are
mightily disproportionate if we consider their unequal Number, and Revenues.
And if Clergy-subsidies be estimated according to the smallness of their
revenue, and paucity of persons, it will not be half so short of the number,
and weight of Crowns from Lay Dispensation, as it does far exceed in the
proportion of the Donative.

3. But the assistance that the Kings of England had in their Counsels, and
affairs of greatest difficulty, from the great ability of Bishops, and other
the Ministers of the Church, I desire to represent in the words of K. Alvred to
Walfsigeus the Bishop, in an Epistle where he deplores the misery of his own
age by comparing it with the former times, when the Bishops were learned, and
exercised in public Counsels. Faelicia tum tempora fuerunt inter omnes Angliae
populos; Reges Deo, and scriptae ejus voluntati obsecundarunt in sua pace, and
bellicis expeditionibus, atque regimine domestico domi se semper tutati
fuerint, atque etiamforis nobilitatem suam dilataverint. The reason was, as he
insinuates before, Sapientes extiterunt in Anglica gente de spirituali gradu
etc. The Bishops were able by their great learning, and wisdom to give
assistance to the Kings affairs. And they have prosper'd in it, for the most
glorious issues of Divine Benison upon this Kingdom were conveyed to us by
Bishops hands, I mean the Union of the houses of York and Lancaster, by the
Counsels of John Speeds Hist. l. 9. c. 19. n. 23. p. 716.
Bishop Morton, and of England and Scotland by the treaty of Ibid. c. 20. n.
64. p. 747.
Bishop Fox, to which if we add two other in Materia religionis, I mean the
conversion of the Kingdom from Paganism, by St Augustine Archbishop of
Canterbury; and the reformation, begun and promoted by Bishops, I think we
cannot call to mind four blessings equal to these in any age or Kingdom, in
all which God was pleased by the mediation of Bishops, as he uses to do, to
bless the people. And this may not only be expected in reason, but in good
Divinity, for amongst the gifts of the spirit, which God has given to his
Church, are reckoned Doctors Teachers, and 1. Cor. ca 12. v. 28.
helps in government. To which may be added this advantage, that the services
of Churchmen are rewardable upon the Churches stock; no need to disimprove the
Royal Banks to pay thanks to Bishops.

But, Sir, I grow troublesome. Let this discourse have what ends it can; the
use J make of it, is but to pretend reason for my Boldness, and to entitle You
to my Book: for I am confident you will own any thing that is but a friends
friend to a cause of Loyalty. I have nothing else to plead for your acceptance,
but the confidence of your Goodness, and that I am a person capeable of your
pardon, and of a fair interpretation of my address to you, by being

SIR Your most affectionate Servant J. TAILOR.

OF THE Sacred Order, and Offices of EPISCOPACY BY DIVINE INSTITUTION,
APOSTOLICAL TRADITION, and Catholic practice etc.
IN all those accursed machinations, which the device, and artifice of Hell
has invented, for the supplanting of the Church, Inimicus homo, that old
superseminator of heresies, and crude mischiefs, has endeavored, to be
curiously compendious, and with Tarquin's device, put are sum a papaverum. And
therefore in the three ages of Martyrs, it was a ruled case in that Burgundian
forge, Qui prior erat dignitate prior trahebatur ad Martyrium. The Priests, but
to be sure the Bishops must pay for all. Tolleimpios, Polycarpus requiratur.
Away with these pedling persecutions, (...). Lay the axe at the root of the
tree. Insomuch that in Rome from S. Peter, and S. Paul to S. Sylvester, thirty
three Bishops of Rome, in immediate succession, suffered an Honorable, and
glorious Martyrdom, unless Maximini jussu Martyrio coronatur. Says Platina,
but that is wholly uncertain.
Meltiades be perhaps excepted, whom Eusebius, and Optatus report to have lived
till the time of the third Consulship of Constantine and Licinius. Conteret
caput ejus, was the glorious promise, Christ should break the Divell's head,
and though the Divell's active part of the Duel was far less, yet he would
venture at that too, even to strike at the heads of the Church, capita vicaria,
for the head of all was past his striking now; And this, I say, he offered to
do by Martyrdom, but that instead of breaking, crowned them.

His next onset was by Julian, and occidere Presbyterium, that was his
Province. To shut up public Schools, to force Christians to ignorance, to
impoverish, and disgrace the Clergy, to make them vile, and dishonorable,
these were his arts; and he did the Devil more service in this finenesse of
undermining, then all the open battery of the ten great Rams of persecution.
But this would not take. For, that which is without cannot defile a man. So it
is in the Church too. Cedunt in bonum, all violences ab extra.

But therefore besides these he attempted by heresies to rent the Churches
bowels all in pieces; but the good Bishops gathered up the scattered pieces and
reunited them at Nice, at Constantinople, at Ephesus, at Chalcedon, at
Carthage, at Rome, and in every famous place of Christendom, and by God's
goodness, and the Bishops industry Catholic religion was conserved in Unity,
and integrity. Well! however it is, Antichrist must come at last, and the great
Apostasy foretold must be, and this, not without means proportionable to the
production of so great declensions of Christianity. When ye hear of wars,
and rumors of wars, be not afraid (said our B. Savior,) the end is not yet.
It is not war that will do this great work of destruction, for then it might
have been done long 'ere now. What then will do it? We shall know when we see
it. In the mean time when we shall find a new device, of which indeed the
platform was laid, in Aerius, and the Acephali, brought to a good possibility
of completing, a thing that whosoever shall hear, his ears shall tingle, an
abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, in sacris, in holy
persons, and places, and offices, it is too probable that this is the
praeparatory for the Antichrist, and grand Apostasy.

For if Antichrist shall exalt himself above all that is called God, and in
Scripture none but Kings, and Priests are such, Dii vocati, Dii facti, I think
we have great reason to be suspicious, that he that devests both of their power
(and they are, if the King be Christian, in very near conjunction,) does the
work of Antichrist for him; especially if the men, whom it most concerns, will
but call to mind, that the discipline, or Government, which Christ has
instituted, is that Kingdom, by which he governes all Christendom (so
themselves have taught us) so that, in case it be proved, that Episcopacy is
that government, then they (to use their own expressions) throw Christ out of
his Kingdom; and then, either they leave the Church without a head, or else
put Antichrist in substitution.

We all wish, that our fears in this, and all things else, may be vain, that
what we fear, may not come upon us; but yet that the abolition of Episcopacy
is the forerunner, and praeparatory to the great Apostasy, I have these
reasons to show, at least the probability. First, Because here is a concurse of
1.
times; for now after that these times have been called the last times, for
1600 years together, our expectation of the Great revelation is very near
accomplishing; and what a Grand innovation of Ecclesiastical government,
contrary to the faith, and practice of Christendom, may portend now in these
times, when we all expect Antichrist to be revealed is worthy of a jealous man's
inquiry. Secondly, Episcopacy, 2.
if we consider the final cause, was instituted as an obstructive to the
diffusion of Schism and Heresy. So in 1. ad Titu^
S. Hierome. In toto orb decretum est, ut unus de Presbyteris electus
superponeretur coeteris, VT SCHISMATVM SEMINA TOLLERENTUR. And therefore if
Unity and division be destructive of each other, then Episcopacy is the best
deletery in the world for Schism: and so much the rather because they are in
eadem materia; for Schism is a division for things either personal, or
accidental, which are matters, most properly the subject of government, and
there to be tried, there to receive their first, and last breath, except where
they are starved to death by a desuetude; and Episcopacy is an Unity of person
governing, and ordering persons, and things, accidental, and substantial; and
therefore a direct confronting of Schism, not only in the intention of the
author of it, but in the nature of the institution, Now then, although Schisms
always will be, and this by divine prediction (which clearly shows the
necessity of perpetual Episcopacy, and the intention of its perpetuity, either
by Christ himself ordaining it, who made the prophecy, or by the Apostles and
Apostolic men at least, who knew the prophecy:) yet to be sure, these
divisions, and dangers shall be greater about, and at the time of the Great
Apostasy; for then, were not the hours turned into minutes, an universal
ruin should seize all Christendom [No flesh should be saved if those days
were not shortened.] is it not next to an evidence of fact, that this
multiplication of Schisms must be removendo prohibens? and therefore that must
be by invalidating Episcopacy, ordayn'd as the remedy and obex of Schism,
either tying their hands behind them, by taking away their coercion, or by
putting out their eyes, by denying them cognizance of causes spiritual, or by
cutting off their heads, and so destroying their order. How far these will
lead us, I leave to be considered. This only; Percute pastores, atque oves
despergentur; and I believe it will be verified at the coming of that wicked
one, I saw all Israel scattered upon the Mountains as sheep having no
sheapheard.

I am not new in this conception, I learned it of S. Cyprian; Christi
adversarius, and Ecclesiae ejus inimicus Epist. 55.
ad hoc, ECCLESIae PRAEPOSITVM sua infestatione persequitur, ut, Gubernatore
sublato, atrocius, atque violentius circa Ecclesiae naufragin grassetur. The
adversary of Christ and enemy of his Spouse therefore persecutes the Bishop,
that having taken him away, he may without check pride himself in the ruins
of the Church; and a little after speaking of them, that are enemies to
Bishops, he says, that, Antichristi jam propinquantis adventum imitantur,
their deportment is just after the guise of Antichrist who is shortly to be
revealed.

But be this conjecture vain, or not, the thing, of it self is of deep
consideration, and the Catholic practice of Christendom for 1500 years is so
insupportable a prejudice against the enemies of Episcopacy, that they must
bring admirable evidence of Scripture, or a clear revelation proved by
Miracles, or a contrary undoubted tradition Apostolical for themselves, or
else hope for no belief against the prescribed possession of so many ages.

But before I begin, me thinks in this contestation, ubi potior est conditio
possidentis, it is a considerable Question; what will the Adversaries stake
against it? For if Episcopacy cannot make its title good, they loose the
benefit of their prescribed possession. If it can; I fear they will scarce
gain so much, as the obedience of the adverse party by it, which yet already is
their due. It is very unequal; but so it is ever, when Authority is the matter
of the Question. Authority never gains by it; for although the cause go on
its side, yet it looses costs, and damages; for it must either by fair
condescension to gain the adversaries, loose something of it self, or, if it
asserts it self to the utmost, it is but where it was; but that seldom or
never happens, for the very questioning of any authority, hoc ipso, makes a
great intrenchment even to the very skirts of its clothing.

But huc deventumest. Now we are in, we must go over.

FIrst then, that we may build upon a Rock.. 1. Christ did institute a
government in his Church.
Christ did institute a government to order and rule his Church by his
authority, according to his laws, and by the assistance of the B. Spirit.

1. If this were not true, how shall the Church be governed? For I hope the
adversaries of Episcopacy, that are so punctual to pitch all upon Scripture
ground, will be sure to produce clear Scripture for so maine a part of
Christianity, as is the form of the Government of Christ's Church. And, if for
our private actions; and duties Oeconomicall, they will pretend a text, I
suppose, it will not be thought possible, Scripture should make default in
assignation of the public Government, insomuch as all laws intend the
public, and the general directly; the private, and the particular, by
consequence only, and comprehension within the general.

2. If Christ himself did not take order for a government, then we must derive
it from humane prudence, and emergency of conveniences, and concurse of new
circumstances, and then the Government must often be changed, or else time must
stand still, and things be ever in the same state and possibility. Both the
consequents are extremely full of inconvenience. For if it be left to humane
prudence, then either the government of the Church is not in immediate order to
the good, and benison of souls, or if it be, that such an institution, in such
immediate order to eternity, should be dependant upon humane prudence, it were
to trust such a rich commodity in a cock-boat, that no wise Pilot will be
supposed to do. But if there be often changes in government Ecclesiastical
(which was the other consequent) in the public frame I mean, and constitution
of it; either the certain infinity of Schisms will arise, or the dangerous
issues of public inconsistence, and innovation, which, in matters of religion,
is good for nothing, but to make men distrust all; and, come the best that can
come, there will be so many Church governments, as there are humane Prudences.
For so (if I be not misinformed) it is abroad in some towns that have
discharged Simler: de rep: Helvet: fol. 148. and 172.
Episcopacy. At St Galls in Switzerland there the Ministers, and Laymen rule
in Common, but a Layman is president. But the Consistories of Zurick and Basil
are wholly consistent of Laymen, and Ministers are joined as assistants only,
and Counselors, but at Schaffhausen the Ministers are not admitted to so much,
but in the Huguenot Churches of France, the Ministers do all.

3. In such cases, where there is no power of the sword for a compulsory (and
confessedly of all sides there can be none in causes and Courts
Ecclesiastical) if there be no opinion of Religion, no derivation from a
divine authority, there will be sure to be no obedience, and indeed nothing but
a certain, public, calamitous irregularity. For why should they obey? Not for
Conscience, for there is no derivation from divine authority. Not for fear,
for they have not the power of the sword.

4. If there be such a thing as the power of the keys, by Christ concredited
to his Church, for the binding and loosing delinquents, and penitents
respectively on earth, then there is clearly a Court erected by Christ in his
Church, for here is the delegation of Judges, Tu Petrus, vos Apostoli,
whatsoever ye shall bind. Here is a compulsory, ligaveritis; Here are the
causes of which they take cognizance, Quodcunque; viz. in materia scandali. For
so it is limited Matthew. 18. but it is indefinite Matthew. 16. and Universal,
John. 20. which yet is to be understood secundum materiam subjectam, in causes,
which are emergent from Christianity, ut sic, that secular jurisdictions may
not be entrenched upon. But of this hereafter. That Christ did in this place
erect a Jurisdiction, and establish a government (besides the evidence of fact)
is generally asserted by primitive exposition of the Fathers, affirming, that
to S. Peter the Keys were given, that to the Church of all ages a power of
binding and loosing might be communicated. Has igitur claves dedit Ecclesiae,
ut quae solveret interra soluta essent in coelo; scil. ut quisquis in Ecclesia
ejus dimitti sibi peccata crederet, seque ab iis correctus averteret in ejusdem
Ecclesiae gremio constitutus eadem fide atque correctione sanaretur. So De

inseparabiliter pertinentibus propter hujus vitae procellosissima gubernaculum
ad liganda and solvenda peccata claves regni coelorum primus Apostolorum Petrus
accepit; Quoniam nec ille solus, sed universa Ecclesia ligat, solvitque
peccata. S. Peter first received the government in the power of binding and
loosing. But not he alone but all the Church, to wit, all succession, and ages
of the Church. Vniversa Ecclesia, viz. in Pastoribus solis, as De Sacerd. lib.

5. When our blessed Savior had spoken a parable of the sudden coming of the
son of Man, and commanded them therefore with diligence to stand upon their
watch, the Disciples asked him, speak thou this parable to us, or even to
all? And the Lord said, who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his
Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in
due season? As if he had said, I speak to You, for to whom else should I speak
and give caution for the looking to the house in the Masters absence? You are
by office and designation my stewards, to feed my servants, to govern my house.

6. In Scripture, and other writers, to Feed, and to Govern, is all one when
the office is either Political or Oeconomicall, or Ecclesiastical. So he
Psalm: 78.
FED them with a faithful and true heart, and RULED them prudently with all
his power. And S. Peter joins, (...) and (...) together. 1. Pet. 5. 2. Acts.
20.
(...). So does S. Paul, (...). Rulers or overseers in a flock. Pastors. It is
ordinary. (...). Homer. (...). Euripides calls the Governors and guides of
Chariots, (...). And our blessed Savior himself is called the Great
sheapheard of our souls; and that we may know the intentum of that
compellation, it is in conjunction also with (...). He is therefore our
sheapheard, for he is our Bishop, our Ruler, and Overseer. Since then Christ
has left Pastors or Feeders in his Church, it is also as certain he has left
Rulers, they being both one in name, in person, in office. But this is of a
known truth to all that understand either laws or languages: (...) says in
lib: de eo quod deterior potiori insidiatur.
Philo, they that feed have the power of Princes and rulers; the thing is an
undoubted truth to most men, but because all are not of a mind something was
necessary for confirmation of it.

THis government was by immediate substitution 2. This government was first
committed to the Apostles by Christ
delegated to the Apostles by Christ himself, in traditione clavium, in
spiratione Spiritus, in missione in Pentecoste. When Christ promised them the
Keys, he promised them power to bind and loose; when he breathed on them the
holy Ghost, he gave them that actually, to which by the former promise they
were entitled; and in the octaves of the Passion, he gave them the same
authority, which he had received from his Father, and they were the faithful
and wise stewards whom the Lord made RULERS over his Household. vide Hilarium in
hunc locum and pp. communiter,
But I shall not labor much upon this. Their founding all the Churches from
East to West, and so, by being Fathers, derived their authority from the nature
of the thing, their appointing rulers in every Church, their Synodall decrees
de Suffocato and Sanguine, and letters missive to the Churches of Syria and
Cilicia, their excommunications of Hymeneus, Alexander, and the incestuous
Corinthian, their commanding, and requiring obedience of their people in all
things, as S. Paul did of his subjects of Corinth, and the Hebrews by precept
Apostolical, their threatening the Pastoral rod, their calling Synods and
public assemblies, their ordering rites and ceremonies, composing a Symbol as
the tessera of Christianity, their public reprehension of delinquents, and
indeed the whole execution of their Apostolate is one continued argument of
their superintendency, and superiority of jurisdiction.

THis power so delegated was not to expire with 3. With a power of joining
others and appointing successors in the Apostolate
their Persons; For when the Great sheapheard had reduced his wandering sheep
into a fold, he would not leave them without guides to govern them, so long as
the wolf might possibly prey upon them, and that is, till the last separation
of the Sheep from the Goats. And this Christ intimates in that promise, Ero
vobiscum (Apostolis) usque ad consummationem saeculi. Vobiscum; not with your
persons, for they dyed long ago, but vobiscum and vestri similibus, with
Apostles to the end of the world. And therefore that the Apostolate might be
successive and perpetual, Christ gave them a power of ordination, that by
imposing hands on others they might impart that power which they received from
Christ. For in the Apostles there was something extraordinary; something
ordinary. Whatsoever was extraordinary, as immediate mission, unlimited
jurisdiction, and miraculous operations, that was not necessary to the
perpetual regiment of the Church, for then the Church should fail when these
privileges extraordinary did cease. It was not therefore in extraordinary
powers and privileges that Christ promised his perpetual assistance; not in
speaking of tongues, not in doing miracles, whether in Materia censurae, as
delivering to Satan; or, in materia misericordiae, as healing sick people; or
in re Naturali, as in resisting the venom of Vipers, and quenching the
violence of flames; in these Christ did not promise perpetual assistance, for
then it had been done, and still these signs should have followed them that
believe. But we see they do not. It follows then, that in all the ordinary
parts of power and office Christ did promise to be with them to the end of the
world, and therefore there must remain a power of giving faculty, and capacity
to persons successively for the execution of that, in which Christ promised
perpetual assistance. For since this perpetual assistance could not be meant
of abiding with their persons, who in few years were to forsake the world, it
must needs be understood of their function, which either it must be succeeded
to, or else it was as temporary as their persons. But in the extraordinary
privileges of the Apostles they had no successors, therefore of necessity a
succession must be constituted in the ordinary office of Apostolate. Now what
is this ordinary office? Most certainly since the extraordinary (as is evident)
was only a help for the founding and beginning, the other are such as are
necessary for the perpetuating of a Church. Now in clear evidence of sense,
these offices and powers are Preaching, Baptizing, Consecrating, Ordaining, and
Governing. For these were necessary for the perpetuating of a Church, unless
men could be Christians that were never Christened, nourished up to life without
the Eucharist, become Priests without calling of God and Ordination, have their
sins pardoned without absolution, be members and parts and sons of a Church
whereof there is no coadunation, no authority, no Governor. These the Apostles
had without all Question, and whatsoever they had, they had from Christ, and
these were eternally necessary, these then were the offices of the Apostolate,
which Christ promised to assist for ever, and this is that which we now call
the Order and Office of Episcopacy.

FOR although Deacons and Priests have part of 4. This succession into the
ordinary office of Apostolate is made by Bishops
these offices, and therefore (though in a very limited sense) they may be
called successores Apostolorum, to wit, in the power of Baptizing, consecrating
the Eucharist, and Preaching (an excellent example whereof, though we have none
in Scripture, yet if I mistake him not we have in Ignatius. calling the
College of Presbyters (...), a Combination of Apostles) yet the Apostolate and
Episcopacy which did communicate in all the power, and offices which were
ordinary and perpetual, are in Scripture clearly all one in ordinary
ministration, and their names are often used in common to signify exactly the
same ordinary function.

1. The name was borrowed from the Prophet For the Apostle and the Bishop are
all one in name and person.
David in the prediction of the Apostasy of Judas, and Surrogation of S.
Matthias; (...). His Bishopric, that is, his Astolate let another take. The
same word according to the translation of the 70. is used by the Prophet
Isaiah, in an Evangelicall prediction, (...) I will give thy Princes in peace,
and thy Bishops in righteousness. Principes Ecclesiae vocat futuros Episcopos,
says In cap. 60. Isai. v. 17.
S. Hierome, herein admiring Gods Majesty in the destination of such Ministers
whom himself calls Princes. And to this issue it is cited by S. Clement in his
famous epistle to the Corinthians. But this is no ways unusual in Scripture.
For,

2. S. James the Brother of our Lord is called an Apostle, and yet he was not
in the number of the twelve, but he was Bishop of Jerusalem. 1. That S. James
was called an Apostle appears by the testimony of S. Paul, [But other Apostles
saw I none, 1. Galat. 19.
save James the Lords Brother.] 1. That he was none of the twelve, appears also
because among the twelve Apostles, there were but two James's. The son of
Alpheus, and James the son of Zebedee, the Brother of John. But neither of
these was the James whom S. Paul calls the Lords brother. And this S. Paul
intimates in making a distinct enumeration 1. Corin. 15.
of all the appearances which Christ made after the resurrection. First to
Cephas, then to the twelve, then to the 500. Brethren, then to James, then to
all the Apostles. So that here S. James is reckoned distinctly from the twelve,
and they from the whole College of the Apostles, for there were (it seems)
more of that dignity then the twelve. But this will also safely rely upon the
concurrent testimony of Vide Carol. Bovium in constable it. Apost. Schol. Hieron.
de Script. Eccl. in Jacobo. and in 1. Galat. Epiphan. haeres. 78, 79.
Hegesippus, Vide Carol. Bovium in constable it. Apost. Schol. Hieron. de Script.
Eccl. in Jacobo. and in 1. Galat. Epiphan. haeres. 78, 79.
S. Clement, Eusebius, Epiphanius, S. Ambrose, and S. Hierome. 3. That S. James
was Bishop of Jerusalem, and therefore called an Apostle, appears by the often
commemoration of his presidency, and singular eminency in holy Scripture.
Priority of order is mentioned, Galat. 2. even before S. Peter, who yet was
primus Apostolorum, natura unus homo, Gratia unus Christianus, abundantiore
gratia unus idemque primus Apostolus; (as S. Austin) yet in his own diocese S.
James had priority of Tract. 124. in Johan.
order before him. v. 9. And when 1 James, 2 Cephas, and 3 John, etc. First
James before Cephas i. e. S. Peter. S. James also was president of that Synod
which the Apostles convocated at Jerusalem about the Question of circumcision;
as is to be seen Vide page
Act. 15. to him S. Paul made his address, Act. 21. to him the brethren
carried him, where he was found sitting in his College of Presbyters, there he
was always resident, and his seat fixed, and that he lived Bishop of Jerusalem
for many years together, is clearly testified by all the faith of the Primitive
Fathers and Historians. But of this hereafter.

3. Epaphroditus is called the Apostle of the Philippians. I have sent unto you
Epaphroditus (...), My compeere Philip. 2. 25.
and your Apostle. Gradum Apostolatus recepit Epaphroditus, says Primasius,
and what that is In hunc locum uterque and Theod. in 1. Tim 3.
we are told by Theodoret, dictus Philippensium Apostolus a S. Paulo, quid hoc
aliud nisi Episcopus? Because he also had received the office of being an
Apostle among them, says S. Jerome upon the same place; and it is very
observeable, that those Apostles to whom our blessed Savior gave immediate
substitution are called (...), Apostles of Jesus Christ, but those other men
which were Bishops of Churches, and called Apostles by Scripture, are called
(...), Apostles of Churches, or sometime Apostles, alone, but never are
entitled of Jesus Christ. Other of the Apostles saw I none but James the Lords
Brother, Gal. 1. There S. James the Bishop of Jerusalem is called an Apostle
indefinitely. But S. Paul calls himself often the Apostle of Jesus Christ, not
of man, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ. So, Peter an Apostle of Jesus
Christ, but S. James in his Epistle to the Jews of the dispersion, writes not
himself the Apostle of Jesus Christ, but (...). James the servant of God and
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Further yet: S. Paul, although as having an immediate calling from Christ to
the office of Apostolate at large, calls himself the Apostle of Jesus Christ,
yet when he was sent to preach to the Gentiles by the particular direction
indeed of the holy Acts. 13. v. 2, 3.
Ghost, but by Humane constitution, and imposition of hands; in relation to
that part of his office, and his cure of the uncircumcision, he limits his
Apostolate to his Diocese and calls himself, (...), Romans 11. 13.
The Apostle of the Gentiles; as S. Peter for the same reason, and in the same
modification is called Galat. 2. 8.
(...), that is, the Apostle of those who were of the Circumcision. And thus
Epaphroditus is called the Apostle of the Philippians, who clearly was their
Bishop (as I shall show in the sequel) that is, he had an Apostolate limited to
the Diocese of Philippi. Paulatim vero tempore procedente, and alie ab his
quos Dominus eleger at ordinati sunt Apostoli, sicut ille ad Philippenses sermo
declarat, dicens, necessarium In 1. cap. Galat.
autem existimo Epaphroditum, etc. So S. Jerome. In process of time others
besides those whom the Lord had chosen, were ordained Apostles; and
particularly he instances in Epaphroditus from the authority of this instance,
adding also that by the Apostles themselves Judas and Silas were called
Apostles.

4. Thus Titus, and some other with him, who came to Jerusalem with the
Corinthian benevolence, 2. Corinthians. 8. 23.
are called (...). The Apostles of the Churches. Apostles, I say, in the
Episcopal sense. They were none of the twelve, they were not of immediate
divine mission, but of Apostolic ordination, they were actually Bishops as I
shall show hereafter. Titus was Bishop of Crete, and Epaphroditus of Philippi,
and these were the Apostles, for Titus came with the Corinthian, Epaphroditus
with the Colossian liberality. Now these men were not (...), called, Messengers
in respect of these Churches sending them with their contributions. 1. Because
they are not called the Apostles of these Churches, to wit, whose alms they
carried, but simply (...), of the Churches, viz. of their own of which they
were Bishops. For if the title of [Apostle] had related to their mission from
these Churches, it is unimaginable that there should be no term of relation
expressed. 2. It is very clear that although they did indeed carry the
benevolence of the several Churches, yet S. Paul, not those Churches sent
Verse. 22.
them, And we have sent with them our Brother, etc. 3. They are called Apostles
of the Churches, not going from Corinth with the money, but before they came
thither from whence they were to be dispatched in legation to Jerusalem. [If
any enquire of V. 23.
Titus....or the Brethren, they are the Apostles of the Church, and the glory
of Christ.] So they were Apostles before they went to Corinth, not for their
being employed in the transportation of their charity. So that it is plain,
that their Apostolate being not relative to the Churches whose benevolence they
carried, and they having Churches of their own, as Titus had Crete,
Epaphroditus had Philippi, their Apostolate was a fixed residence, and
superintendency of their several Churches.

But in holy Scripture the identity of the ordinary 5. And office,
office of Apostleship and Episcopacy, is clearer yet. For when the holy Spirit
had sent seven letters to the seven Asian Bishops, the Angel of the Church
Apocal. 2.
of Ephesus is commended for trying them, which say they are Apostles and are
not, and hathfound themlyars. This Angel of the Church of Ephesus, as
Antiquity has taught us, was at that time Timothy, or Doroth. Synops.
Gajus, the first a Disciple, the other had been an entertainer of the
Apostles, and either of them knew them well enough; it could not be that any
man should dissemble their persons and counterfeit himself S. Paul, or S.
Peter. And if they had, yet little trying was needful to discover their folly
in such a case, and whether it was Timothy or Gajus he could deserve but small
commendations for the mere believing of his own eyes and memory. Besides the
Apostles all were then dead, and he known to live in Patmos, known by the
public attestation of the sentence of relegation ad insulam. These men
therefore dissembling themselves to be Apostles, must dissemble an ordinary
function, not an extraordinary person. And indeed by the concurse of of story,
place, and time, Diotrephes was the Man S. John chiefly pointed at. For he
seeing that of Ephesus there had been an Episcopal chair placed, and Timothy
a long while possessed of it, and Vide Constit. Apost. per Clement. ubt quidam
Johannes in Epheso Episc. post Timoth. collocatur.
perhaps Gajus after him, if we may trust Dorotheus, and the like in some other
Churches, and that S. John had not constituted Bishops in all the other
Churches of the lesser Asia, but kept the Jurisdiction to be ministered by
himself, would arrogantly take upon him to be a Bishop without Apostolical
ordination, obtruding himself upon the Church of Ephesus, so becoming (...), a
busy man in another Diocese. This, and such impostors as this the Angel of
the Church of Ephesus did try, and discover, and convict, and in it he was
assisted by S. John himself, as is intimated in S. John's third Epistle written
to this Gajus [v. 9.] I wrote unto the Church (to wit of Asia) but Diotrephes
who loves to have the pre-eminence among them receives us not.] Clearly this
(...) would have been a Bishop. It was a matter of ambition, a quarrel for
superintendency and pre-eminence that troubled him; and this also appears
further in that he exercised jurisdiction, and excommunication where he had
nothing to do, [v. 10.] He forbids them that would receive the Brethren, and
casts them out of the Church. So that here it is clear, this false
Apostolate, was his ambitious seeking of Episcopal pre-eminence and
jurisdiction without lawful ordination. (...), that was his design, He loved
to be the first in the Church, esse Apostolum, esse Episcopum, to be an
Apostle, or a Bishop.

But this office of the ordinary Apostleship or Episcopacy, 6. Which Christ
himself has made distinct from Presbyters
derives its fountain from a Rock; Christ's own distinguishing the Apostolate
from the function of Presbyters. For when our blessed Savior had gathered many
Disciples who believed him at his first preaching, Vocavit Discipulos suos, and
elegit duodecem ex ipsis quos and Apostolos nominavit, says S. Luke. He called
his Disciples, and out Luke 10.
of them chose twelve, and called them Apostles. That was the first election.
Post haec autem designavit Dominus and alios septuaginta duos. That was his
second election; the first were called Apostles, the second were not, and yet
he sent them by two and two.

We hear but of one commission granted them, which when they had performed and
returned joyful at their power over Devils, we hear no more of them in the
Gospel, but that their Names were written in heaven. We are likely therefore
to hear of them after the passion, if they can but hold their own. And so we
do. For after the Passion the Apostles gathered them together, and joined them
in Clericall commission by virtue of Christ's first ordination of them, for a
new ordination we find none in holy Scripture recorded, before we find them
doing Clericall offices. Ananias we read baptizing of Saul, Philip the
Evangelist we find preaching in Samaria, and baptizing his Converts; Others
also we find, Presbyters at Jerusalem, especially at the first Council, for
there was Judas surnamed Iustus, and Silas, and S. Mark, and John (a
Presbyter, not an Apostle as Eusebius Lib. 3. cap. 3.
reports him) and Simeon Cleophas who tarried there till he was made Bishop of
Jerusalem, these and diverse others, are reckoned to be of the number of the
72, by Eusebius and Dorotheus.

Here are plainly two offices of Ecclesiastical Ministeries. Apostles and
Presbyters, so the Scripture calls them. These were distinct, and not
temporary, 7. Giving to Apostles a power to do some offices perpetually
necessary, which to others he gave not.
but succeeded to, and if so, then here is clearly a Divine institution of two
Orders, and yet Deacons neither of them. Here let us fix a while.

1. THen; It is clear in Scripture that the Apostles did some acts of
Ministry which were necessary to be done for ever in the Church, and therefore
to be committed to their Successors, which acts the seventy Disciples or
Presbyters could not do. (...), says S. Denis Eccles. hierarch. c. 5.
of the Highest Order of the Hierarchy. The law of God has reserved the
Greater and Diviner Offices to the Highest Order.

First, the Apostles imposed hands in Ordinations, As of Ordination,
which the 72 did not, the case is known, Act. 6. The Apostles called the
Disciples, willing them to choose seven men whom they might constitute in the
ministration and oversight of the poor, They did so, and set them before the
twelve Apostles, so they are specified and numbered verse. 2. cum 6. and when
they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. They, not the Disciples, not
the 72 who were there actually present, and seven of them were then ordayn'd
to this Ministry, for they were not now ordayn'd to be (...), but (...), as
the In Trullo. can. 16.
Council of Constantinople calls them, and that these were of the number of
the 72. Disciples, Epiphanius bears witness. He sent other 72. to Haeres. 20.
preach (...), of which Number were those seven ordained and set over the
widows. And the same is intimated by S. Chrysostom, if I understand him
right, (...). Homil. 14. in Act. 6.
What dignity had these seven here ordained? of Deacons? No; for this
dispensation is made by Priests not Deacons; and Theophylact more clearly
repeating the In hunc locu^.
words of S. Chrysostom, promore suo, adds this, (...). The name and dignity
of these seven was no less, but even the dignity of Presbyters, only for the
time they were appointed to dispense the goods of the Church for the good of
the faithful people. Presbyters they were say S. Chrysostom and Theophylact;
of the number of the 72. says Epiphanius. But however, it is clear that the
72. were present, for the whole multitude of the Disciples was as yet there
resident, they were not yet sent abroad, they were not scattered with
persecution till the Martyrdom of S. Stephen, [but the twelve called the whole
multitude of the Disciples] to them about this affair. verse. 2. But yet
themselves only did ordain them.

2. An instance parallel to this, is in the imposition of hands upon S. Paul
and Barnabas, in the Acts. 13.
first ordination that was held at Antioch. [Now there were in the Church that
was at Antioch certain Prophets and Teachers, as Barnabas and Simeon, and
Lucius, and Manaen, and Saul. (...), while these men were Ministering, the holy
Ghost said to them, separate me Barnabas and Saul.] They did so, they [fasted,
they prayed, they laid their hands on them, and sent them away. So they being
sent forth by the holy Ghost, departed into Seleucia.] This is the story, now
let us make our best on it. Here then was the ordination and imposition of hands
complete, and that was said to be done by the holy Ghost which was done by the
Prophets of Antioch. For they sent them away, and yet the next words are, so
they being sent forth by the holy Ghost. So that here was the thing done, and
that by the Prophets alone, and that by the command of the Holy Ghost, and said
to be his act. Well! but what were these Prophets? They were Prophets in the
Church of Antioch, not such as Prophetas duplici genere intelligamus, and
futura dicentes and Scripturas revelantes. S. Ambros: in 1. Corinthians. 12.
Agabus, and the daughters of Philip the Evangelist, Prophets of prediction
extraordinary, but Prophets of ordinary office and ministration, (...),
Prophets and Teachers and Ministers. More then ordinary Ministers, for they
were Doctors or Teachers, and that is not all, for they were Prophets too. This
even at first sight is more then the ordinary office of the Presbytery. We
shall see this clear enough in S. Paul Ephesians. 4.
where the ordinary office of Prophets is reckoned before Pastors, before
Evangelists, next to Apostles, that is next to such Apostles (...), as S. Paul
there expresses it, next to those Apostles to whom Christ has given immediate
mission. And these are therefore Apostles too, Apostles secundi ordinis, none
of the twelve, but such as S. James, and Epaphroditus, and Barnabas and S. Paul
himself. To be sure they were such Prophets as S. Paul and Barnabas, for they
are reckoned in the number by S. Luke, for here it was that S. Paul although he
had immediate vocation by Christ, yet he had particular ordination to this
Apostolate or Ministry of the Gentiles. It is evident then what Prophets these
were, they they were at the least more then ordinary Presbyters, and therefore
they imposed hands, and they only. And yet to make the business up complete,
S. Mark was amongst them, but he imposed no hands, he was there as the Deacon
and Minister [vers. 5.] but he meddled not, S. Luke fixes the whole action upon
the Prophets, such as S. Paul himself was, and so did the Holy Ghost too, but
neither did S. Mark who was an Evangelist, and one of the 72 Disciples (as he
is reckoned in the Primitive Catalogues by Eusebius and Dorotheus) nor any of
the College of the Antiochian Presbyters, that were less then Prophets, that
is, who were not more then mere Presbyters.

The sum is this: Imposition of hands is a duty and office necessary for the
perpetuating of a Church, ne Gens sit Vnius aetatis, least it expire in one
age: this power of imposition of hands for Ordination was fixed upon the
Apostles and Apostolic men, and not communicated to the 72 Disciples or
Presbyters; for the Apostles, and Apostolic men, did so de facto, and were
commanded to do so, and the 72 never did so, therefore this office and
Ministry of the Apostolate is distinct, and superior to that of Presbyters,
and this distinction must be so continued to all ages of the Church, for the
thing was not temporary but productive of issue and succession, and therefore
as perpetual as the Clergy, as the Church it self.

2. THe Apostles did impose hands for confirmation 8. And Confirmation,
of Baptized people, and this was a perpetual act of a power to be succeeded
to, and yet not communicated, nor executed by the 72, or any other mere
Presbyter. That the Apostles did confirm Baptized people, and others of the
inferior Clergy could not, is beyond all exception clear in the case of the
Samaritan Christians. Acts. 8. For when S. Philip had converted, and Baptized
the Men of Samaria, the Apostles sent Peter and John to lay their hands on them
that they might receive the Holy Ghost. S. Philip he was an Evangelist, he was
one of the 72 Disciples, S. Cyprian: ad Iubajan.
a Presbyter, and appointed to the same ministration that S. Stephen was about
the poor Widows, yet he could not do this, the Apostles must and did. This
giving of the Holy Ghost by imposition of the Apostles hands, was not for a
miraculous gift, but an ordinary Grace. For S. Philip could, and did do
miracles enough, but this Grace he could not give, the Grace of consigning or
confirmation. The like case is in Acts. 19. where some people having been
Baptized at Ephesus, S. Paul confirmed them, giving them the Holy Ghost by
imposition of hands. The Apostles did it; not the twelve only, but Apostolic
men, the other Apostles. S. Paul did it. S. Philip could not, nor any of the
72, or any other mere Presbyters ever did it, that we find in Holy Scripture.

Yea; but this imposition of hands, was for a Miraculous issue, for the
Ephesine Christians received the Holy Ghost, and spoke with tongues and
prophesied, which effect because it is ceased, certainly the thing was
temporary and long ago expired. 1. Not for this reason to be sure. For
extraordinary effects may be temporary, when the function which they attest may
be eternal, and therefore are no signs of an extraordinary Ministry. The
Apostles preaching was attended by Miracles, and extraordinary conversions of
people [ut in exordio, Apostolos divinorum signorum comitabantur effectus and
Spiritus Sancti gratia, itdut videres una alloquutione integros simul populos
ad cultum divinae religionis adduci, and praedicantium verb is non esse
tardiorem audientium fidem,] as lib: 3 hist: cap. 37.
Eusebius tells of the success of the preaching of some Evangelists; yet I hope
preaching must not now cease because no Miracles are done, or that to convert
one man now would be the greatest Miracle. The Apostles when they cursed and
anathematized a delinquent, he dyed suddenly, as in the case of Ananias and
Saphira, whom S. Peter flew with the word of his Ministry, and yet now
although these extraordinary issues cease, it is not safe venturing upon the
curses of the Church. When the Apostles did excommunicate a sinner, he was
presently delivered over to Satan to be buffeted, that is, to be afflicted
with corporal punishments, and now although no such exterminating Angels beat
the bodies of persons excommunicate, yet the power of excommunication I hope
still remains in the Church, and the power of the Keys is not also gone: So
also in the power of confirmation, vide August. tract. 6. in 1. Epict. Johan.
which however attended by a visible miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost in
gifts of languages and healing, yet like other miracles in respect of the whole
integrity of Christian faith, these miracles at first did confirm the
function, and the faith for ever.

Now then that this right of imposing hands for confirming of baptized people,
was not to expire with the persons of the Apostles, appears from these
considerations.

1. Because Christ made a promise of sending Vicarium suum Spiritum, the Holy
Ghost in his stead; and this by way of appropriation is called the promise of
the Father; This was pertinent to all Christendom. Effundam de spiritu meo
super omnem carnem, so it was in the Prophecy. For the promise is to you and to
your Children (...), and to all them that are a Act. 2. 39.
far off, even to as many as the Lord shall call. So it was in the first
accomplishing. To all. and this for ever, for [I will send the Holy Ghost unto
you, and he shall abide with you for ever] for it was in subsidium, to supply
the comforts of his desired presence, and must therefore ex vi intentionis be
remanent till Christ's coming again. Now then this promise being to be
communicated to all, and that for ever, must either come to us by 1
extraordinary and miraculous mission, or by 2 an ordinary Ministry. No^ the
first; for we might as well expect the gift of Miracles. If the second (as it
is most certain so) then the main Question is evicted, viz: that something
perpetually necessary was in the power of the Apostles, which was not in the
power of the inferior Ministers, nor of any, but themselves and their
Colleagues, to wit, Ministerium S. Spiritus, or the ordinary office of giving
the holy Ghost by imposition of hands. For this promise was performed to the
Apostles in Pentecost, to the rest of the faithful after Baptism, Quodn. nunc
in confirmandis Neophyt is manus impositio tribuit singulis, hoc tunc spiritus
sancti descensio, in credentium populo donavit Vniversis, says Eusebius
Emissenus. Now we find no other way of performing it, nor Sermon. de Penticoste.
any ordinary conveyance of the Spirit to all people, but this; and we find
that the H. Ghost actually was given this way. Therefore the effect, to wit,
the H. Ghost being to continue forever, and the promise of Universal
concernement, this way also of it is communication, to wit, by Apostolical
imposition of hands, is also perpetuum ministerium, to be succeeded to and to
abide for ever.

2 This Ministry of imposition of hands for confirmation of baptized people is
so far from being a temporary Grace, and to determine with the persons of the
Apostles, that it is a fundamental point of Christianity, an essential
ingredient to it is composition. S. Paul is my Author. [Therefore leaving Hebr.
6. 2.
the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not
laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead works, faith to wards God,
the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands. etc. Here is imposition of
hands reckoned as part of the foundation and a principle of Christianity in S.
Paul's Catechism. Now, imposition of hands is used by Name in Scripture but for
two Ministrations. 1 For ordination, and 2 for this whatsover it is. Imposition
of hands for ordination does indeed give the Holy Ghost, but not as he is that
promise which is called the promise of the Father. For the Holy Ghost for
ordination was given before the ascension. John. 20. But the promise of the H.
Ghost the comforter [the Paraclete, I say, not the Ordayner or fountain of
Priestly order, that] was not given till the day of Pentecost; and besides, it
was promised to all Christian people, and the other was given only to the
Clergy.

* Add to this, that S. Paul having laid this in the foundation makes his
progress from this to perfection (as he calls it) that is to higher mysteries,
and then his discourse is immediately of the Priesthood Evangelicall, which is
Originally in Christ, ministerially in the Clergy; so that unless we will
either confound the terms of his progress, or imagine him to make the
Ministry of the Clergy, the foundation of Christ's Priesthood, and not rather
contrary, it is clear that by imposition of hands, S. Paul means not
ordination, and therefore confirmation, there being no other ordinary Ministry
of imposition of hands but these two specifyed in Holy Scripture. For, as for
benediction in which Christ used the ceremony, and as for healing in which
Ananias and the Apostles used it; the first is clearly no Principle or
fundamental point of Christianity; and the Second is confessedly
extraordinary, therefore the argument is still firm upon it is first principles.

3. Lastly, the Primitive Church did de facto, and believed themselves to be
tied de jure to use this rite of Confirmation and giving of the Holy Ghost
after Baptism.

S. Clemens Alexandrinus in Eusebius tells a story lib: 3. hist: cap. 17.
of a young man whom S. John had converted and committed to a Bishop to be
brought up in the faith of Christendom, Qui (says S. Clement) eum baptismi
Sacramento illuminavit, postea vero sigillo Domini tanquam perfecta and tuta
ejus animi custodia obsignavit. The Bishop first baptized him, then consigned
him. Justin Martyr says (speaking pro more Quaest. 137. ad Orthod:
Ecclesiae, according to the Custom of the Church) that when the mysteries of
baptism were done, then the faithful are consigned, or confirmed.

S. Cyprian relates to this story of S. Philip and Epist: 73 ad Iubajan:
the Apostles, and gives this account of the whole affayre, Et idcirco quia
legitimum and Ecclesiasticum baptismum consequuti fuerant, baptizari eos ultra
non oportebat; Sed tantummodo id quod deerat, id a Petro and Iohanne factum
erat, ut oratione pro eis habita and manu imposita invocaretur, and
infunderetur super eos Spiritus S. Quod nunc quoque apud nos geritur, ut qui in
Ecclesia baptizantur, Praeposit is Ecclesiae offerantur, ut per nostram
orationem ac manus impositionem Spiritum S. consequantur, and signaculo
Dominico confirmentur. S. Peter and S. John by imposing their hands on the
Converts of Samaria, praying over them, and giving them the Holy Ghost, made
supply to them of what was wanting after Baptism: and this is to this day done
in the Church, for new baptized people are brought to the Bishops, and by
imposition of their hands obtain the Holy Ghost.

But for this who pleases to be farther satisfied in the Primitive faith of
Christendom, may see it in the decretall Epistles of Cornelius the Martyr to
Faebianus recorded by Eusebius; in the Lib. 6. hist. cap: 33.

Christian prudence it was, in all true respects to disadvantage Heretics,
least their poison should infect like a Pest, laid it in Novatus dish as a
crime, He was baptized in his bed, and was not confirmed, Vnde nec Spiritum
sanctum unquam potuerit promereri, therefore he could never receive the gift of
the holy Ghost. So Cornelius in the forequoted Epistle. Whence it is evident,
that then it was the belief of Christendom, that the holy Ghost was by no
ordinary ministry given to faithful people after Baptism, but only by
Apostolical, or Episcopal consignation and imposition of hands.

What also the faith of Christendom was concerning the Minister of
confirmation, and that Bishops only could do it, I shall make evident in the
descent of this discourse. Here the scene lies in Scripture, where it is clear
that S. Philip, one of the 72. Disciples, as antiquity reports him, and an
Evangelist and a Disciple, as Scripture also expresses him, could not impose
hands for application of the promise of the Father, and ministerial giving of
the holy Ghost, but the Apostles must go to do it; and also there is no
example in Scripture of any that ever did it but an Apostle, and yet this is an
ordinary Ministry which de jure ought, and de facto always was continued in
the Church. Therefore there must always be an ordinary office of Apostleship
in the Church to do it, that is, an office above Presbyters, for in Scripture
they could never do it, and this is it which we call Episcopacy.

3. THe Apostles were rulers of the whole 9. And Superiority of Jurisdiction,
Church, and each Apostle respectively of his several Diocese, when he would
fix his chair; and had superintendency over the Presbyters, and the people,
and this by Christ's donation, the Charter is by the Fathers said to be this.
Sicut misit me Pater, John. 20. 21.
sic ego mitto vos. As my Father has sent me, even so send I you. Manifesta
enim est sententiae Domini nostri Jesus Christi Apostolos suos mittentis, Lib.
7. de baptism. Contra Donatist. c. 43. vide etiam S. Cyprian, de Unit. Eccles.
and S. Cyrill. in Ioh. lib. 12. c. 55.
and ipsis solis potestatem a Patre sibi datam permittentis quibus nos
successimus eadem potestate Ecclesiam Domini gubernantes, said Clarus a
Muscula, the Bishop in the Council of Carthage related by S. Cyprian and S.
Austin. But however it is evident in Scripture, that the Apostles had such
superintendency over the inferior Clergy (Presbyters I mean and Deacons) and a
superiority of jurisdiction, and therefore it is certain that Christ gave it
them, for none of the Apostles took this honor, but he that was called of God
as was Aaron.

1. Our blessed Savior gave to the Apostles plenitudinem potestatis. It was
sicut misit me Pater, etc. As my Father sent, so I send. You, my Apostles whom
I have chosen. This was not said to Presbyters, for they had no commission at
all given to them by Christ, but at their first mission to preach repentance, I
say no commission at all, they were not spoken to, they were not present. Now
then consider. Suppose that as Aerius did deny the Divine institution of
Bishops over the Presbyters cum grege, another as confident as he should deny
the Divine institution of Presbyters, what proof were there in all the holy
Scripture to show the Divine institution of them as a distinct order from
Apostles or Bishops. Indeed Christ selected 72. and gave them commission to
preach, but that commission was temporary and expired before the crucifixion
for ought appears in Scripture. If it be said the Apostles did ordain
Presbyters in every City, it is true, but not sufficient, for so they ordained
Deacons at Jerusalem, and in all established Churches, and yet this will not
tant' amount to an immediate Divine institution for Deacons, and how can it
then for Presbyters? If we say a constant Catholic traditive interpretation of
Scripture, does teach us, that Christ did institute the Presbyterate together
with Episcopacy, and made the Apostles Presbyters as well as Bishops; this is
true. But then 1. We recede from the plain words of Scripture, and rely upon
tradition, which in this question of Episcopacy will be of dangerous
consequence to the enemies of it, for the same tradition, if that be admitted
for good probation, is for Episcopal pre-eminence over Presbyters, as will
appear in the sequel. 2. Though no use be made of this advantage, yet to the
allegation it will be quickly answered, that it can never be proved from
Scripture, that Christ made the Apostles Priests first, and then Bishops or
Apostles, but only that Christ gave them several commissions, and parts of the
office Apostolical, all which being in one person, cannot by force of
Scripture prove two orders. Truth is, if we change the scene of war, and say
that the Presbyterate, as a distinct order from the ordinary office of
Apostleship, is not of Divine institution, the proof of it would be harder then
for the Divine institution of Episcopacy. Especially if we consider, that in
all the enumerations of the parts of Clericall Ephesians. 4. 1. Corinthians. 12.
offices, there is no enumeration of Presbyters, but of Apostles there is; and
the other members of the induction are of gifts of Christianity, or parts of
the Apostolate, and either must infer many more orders, then the Church ever
yet admitted of, or none, distinct from the Apostolate, insomuch as Apostles
were Pastors, and Teachers, and Evangelists, and Rulers, and had the gift of
tongues, of healing, and of Miracles. This thing is of great consideration, and
this use I will make of it: That either Christ made the 72 to be Presbyters,
and in them instituted the distinct order of Presbyterate, as the ancient
Church always did believe, or else he gave no distinct commission for any such
distinct order. If the second be admitted, then the Presbyterate is not of
immediate divine institution, but of Apostolical only, as is the Order of
Deacons, and the whole plenitude of power is in the order Apostolical alone,
and the Apostles did constitute Presbyters with a greater portion of their own
power, as they did Deacons with a less. But if the first be said, then the
commission to the 72 Presbyters being only of preaching that we find in
Scripture, all the rest of their power which now they have is by Apostolical
ordinance, and then although the Apostles did admit them in partem
sollicitudinis, yet they did not admit them in plenitudinem potestatis, for
then they must have made them Apostles, and then there will be no distinction
of order neither by Divine nor Apostolical institution neither.

I care not which part be chosen, one is certain; but if either of them be
true, then since to the Apostles only, Christ gave a plenitude of power, it
follows, that either the Presbyters have no power of jurisdiction, as affixed
to a distinct order, and then the Apostles are to rule them by virtue of the
order and ordinary commission Apostolical; or if they have jurisdiction they
do derive it a font Apostolorum, and then the Apostles have superiority of
Jurisdiction over Presbyters, because Presbyters only have it by delegation
Apostolical. And that I say truth (besides that there is no possibility of
showing the contrary in Scripture, by the producing any other commission given
to Presbyters, then what I have specified,) I will hereafter show it to have
been the faith and practice of Christendom not only that Presbyters were
actually subordinate to Bishops (which I contend to be the ordinary office of
Apostleship) but that Presbyters have no Jurisdiction essential to their
order, but derivative only from Apostolical pre-eminence.

2. Let us now see the matter of fact. They that can inflict censures upon
Presbyters have certainly superiority of Jurisdiction over Presbyters, for
Aequalis aequalem coercere non potest, says the Law. Now it is evident in the
case of Diotrephes a Presbyter, and a Bishop Would be, that for his peremptory
rejection of some faithful people from the Catholic communion without cause,
and without authority, S. John the Apostle threatened him in his Epistle to
Gajus, (...) and c. Wherefore when I come I will remember him, and all that
would have been to very little purpose, if he had not had coercitive
jurisdiction to have punished his delinquency.

3. Presbyters many of them did succeed the Apostles by a new ordination, as
Matthias succeeded Judas, who before his new ordination was one of the 72. as
Lib. 1. hist. c 12. and l. 2. c. 9.
Eusebius, Haeres. 20.
Epiphanius, and De script. Eccles. in Matthew. vide Irenaeum l. 4. c. 63. Tertul
de praescript.
S. Jerome affirm, and in Scripture is expressed to be of the number of them
that went in and out with Jesus; S. Clement succeeded S. Peter at Rome, S.
Simeon Cleophae succeeded S. James at Jerusalem, S. Philip succeeded S. Paul at
Caesarea, and diverse others of the 72, reckoned by Dorotheus, Eusebius, and
others of the Fathers, did govern the several Churches after the Apostles
death which before they did not. Now it is clear that he that receives no more
power after the Apostles, then he had under them, can no way be said to succeed
them in their Charge, or Churches. It follows then, since (as will more fully
appear anon) Presbyters did succeed the Apostles, that under the Apostles they
had not such jurisdiction as afterward they had. But the Apostles had the same
to which the Presbyters succeeded to, therefore greater then the Presbyters had
before they did succeed. When I say Presbyters succeeded the Apostles, I mean,
not as Presbyters, but by a new ordination to the dignity of Bishops, so they
succeeded, and so they prove an evidence of fact, for a superiority of
Jurisdiction in the Apostolical Clergy. *** Now that this superiority of
Jurisdiction was not temporary, but to be succeeded in, appears from Reason,
and from ocular demonstration, or of the thing done.

1. If superiority of Jurisdiction was necessary in the ages Apostolical for
the regiment of the Church, there is no imaginable reason why it should not be
necessary in succession, since upon the emergency of Schisms and Heresies
which were foretold should multiply in descending ages, government and
superiority of jurisdiction, unity of supremacy, and coercion was more
necessary then at first, when extraordinary gifts might supply, what now we
expect to be performed by an ordinary authority.

2. Whatsoever was the regiment of the Church in the Apostles times that must
be perpetual (not so as to have Ut puta, viduarum collegium, and Diaconorum,
and coenobium fidelium. etc:
all that which was personal, and temporary, but so as to have no other) for
that, and that only is of Divine institution which Christ committed to the
Apostles, and if the Church be not now governed as then, We can show no Divine
Authority for our government, which we must contend to do, and do it too, or
be called usurpers. For either the Apostles did govern the Church as Christ
commanded them, or not. If not, then they fayl'd in the founding of the Church,
and the Church is not built upon a Rock. If they did (as most certainly they
did) then either the same disparity of jurisdiction must be retayn'd, or else
we must be governned with an Unlawful and unwarranted equality, because not by
that which only is of immediate divine institution; and then it must needs be a
fine government, where there is no authority, and where no man is superior.

3. We see a disparity in the Regiment of Churches warranted by Christ
himself, and confirmed by the Holy Ghost in fairest intimation. I mean the
seven Angel-Presidents of the seven Asian Churches. If these seven Angels
were seven Bishops, that is, Prelates or Governors of these seven Churches,
in which it is evident and confessed of all sides, there were many Presbyters,
then it is certain that a Superiority of Jurisdiction was intended by Christ
himself, and given by him, insomuch as he is the fountain of all power
derived to the Church; For Christ writes to these seven Churches, and directs
his Epistles to the seven Governors of these Churches calling them Angels,
which it will hardly be supposed he would have done, if the function had not
been a ray of the Sun of righteousness, they had not else been Angels of
light, nor stars held in Christ's own right hand.

This is certain, that the function of these Angels (whatsoever it be) is a
Divine institution. Let us then see what is meant by these stars and Angels.
[The seven stars are the Angels of the seven Revel. 1. verse. 20.
Churches, and the seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches.]

1. Then it is evident, that although the Epistles were sent with a final
intention for the edification and confirmation of the whole Churches or people
of the Diocese, with an [Attendite quid Spiritus dicit Ecclesijs] yet the
personal direction was not to the whole Church, for the whole Church is called
the Candlestick, and the superscription of the Epistles is not to the seven
Candlesticks, but to the seven stars which are the Angels of the seven
Churches, viz. the lights shining in the Candlesticks. By the Angel therefore
is not, cannot be meant the whole Church.

2. It is plain that by the Angel is meant the Governor of the Church, 1.
Because of the title of eminency, The Angel (...), that is, the Messenger, the
Legate, the Apostle of the Church. (...). For these words, Angel, or Apostle,
although they signify Mission or Legation, yet in Scripture they often relate
to the persons to whom they are sent. As in the examples before specified.
(...). Their Angels. (...). The Apostles of the Churches. (...). The Angel of
the Church of Ephesus, and diverse others. Their compellation therefore being a
word of office in respect of him that sends them, and of Eminence in relation
to them to whom they are sent, shows that the Angel was the Ruler of each
Church respectively. 2. Because acts of jurisdiction are concredited to him;
as, not to suffer false Apostles; So to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus,
which is clearly a power of cognizance and coercion in causis Clericorum: to be
watchful and strengthen the things that remain; as to the Angel of the Church
in Sardis, (...), The first is the office of Rulers, for they Watch for your
Souls; And the Hebr. 13.
second, of Apostles, and Apostolic men. (...), Judas and Silas confirmed the
Brethren, for these men, although they were but of the 72 at first, yet by this
time were made Apostles and [cheife men among the Brethren.] S. Paul also was
joined in this work, (...), Act. 15.
He went up and down confirming the Churches. And (...). S. Paul. To confirm
1. Cor. 11.
the Churches, and to make supply of what is deficient in discipline and
government, these were offices of power and jurisdiction, no less then
Episcopal or Apostolical; and besides the Angel here spoken of had a
propriety in the people of the Diocese [Thou have a few names even in Sardis]
they were the Bishops people, the Angel had a right to them. And good reason
that the people should be his, for their faults are attributed to him, as to
the Angel of Pergamus, and diverse others, and therefore they are deposited in
his custody, He is to be their Ruler and Pastor, and this is called his
Ministry. To the Angel of the Church of Thyatira (...), I have known thy
Ministry. His office therefore was Clericall, it was an Angel-Minister, and
this his office must make him the guide and superior to the Rest, even all the
whole Church, since he was charged with all.

3. By the Angel is meant a singular person, for the reprehensions and the
commendations respectively imply personal delinquency, or suppose personal
excellencyes. Add to this that the compellation is singular, and of
determinate number, so that we may as well multiply Churches as persons, for
the seven Churches had but seven stars, and these seven stars were the
Angels of the seven Churches. And if by seven stars they may mean 70 times
seven stars (for so they may if they begin to multiply) then by one star
they must mean many stars, and so they may multiply Churches too, for there
were as many Churches as stars, and no more Angels then Churches, and it is
as reasonable to multiply these seven Churches into 7000, as every star into
a Constellation, or every Angel into a Legion.

But besides the Exigency of the thing it self, these seven Angels are by
Antiquity called the seven Governors or Bishops of the seven Churches, and
their very names are commemorated. Unto these seven Churches S. John, says
Arethas, reckons in 1. Apocal.
(...), an equal number of Angel-Governours, and Oecumenius in his scholia
upon this place, says the very same words. Septem igitur Angelos Rectores
septem Ecclesiarum debemus intelligere, ibid:
eo quod Angelus Nuntius interpretatur, says S. Ambrosc, and again, Angelos
Episcopos dicit sicut docetur in Apocalypsi Iohannis. Let the woman in 1. Cor.
11.
have a covering on her head because of the Angels, that is, in reverence and
subjection to the Bishop of the Church, for Bishops are the Angels as is taught
in the Revelation of S. John. Divina voce sub Angeli Nomine laudatur
praepositus Ecclesiae so S. Austin. By the voice of God the Bishop Epist. 162.
and in Apocal.
of the Church is commended under the title of an Angel. Eusebius names some of
these Angels who were then Presidents and actually Bishops of these Churches.
S. Policarpe was one to be sure, apud Smyrnam and Episcopus and Martyr, says
Eusebius, lib. 5. c. 24.
He was the Angel of the Church of Smyrna; And he had good authority for it,
for he reports it out of Polycrates who a little after, was himself an Angel
of the Church of Ephesus, and he also lib. 4 c. 10.
quotes S. Irenaeus for it, and out of the Encyclicall Epistle of the Church of
Smyrna it self, and besides lib. 4. cap. 15.
these authorities it is attested by S. Epist. ad Policarp.
Ignatius, and de praescrip.
Tertullian. S. Timothy was another Angel, to wit, of the Church of Ephesus;
to be sure had been, and most likely was still surviving. Antipas is reckoned
by Name in the Revelation, and he had been the Angel of Pergamus, but before
this book written vide Aretha. in 1. Apoc.
he was turned from an Angel to a Saint. Melito in all probability was then the
Angel of the Church of Sardis. Melito quoque Sardensis Ecclesiae Antistes, and
Apollinaris apud Hierapolim Ecclesiam regens celeberrimi inter caeteros
habebantur, says Eusebius. These men were actually living when S. John writ
lib. 4. cap. 26.
his Revelation, for Melito writ his book de Paschate when Sergius Paulus was
Proconsul of Asia, and writ after the Revelation, for he writ a treatise of it,
as says Eusebius. However, at least some of these were then, and all of these
about that time were Bishops of these Churches, and the Angels S. John speaks
of were such who had Jurisdiction over their whole Diocese, therefore these,
or such as these were the Angels to whom the Spirit of God writ hortatory and
commendatory letters, such whom Christ held in his Right hand and fixed them in
the Churches like lights set on a Candlestick that they might give shine to the
whole house.

The Sum of all is this; that Christ did institute Apostles and Presbyters or
72 Disciples. To the Apostles he gave a plenitude of power, for the whole
commission was given to them in as great and comprehensive clauses as were
imaginable, for by virtue of it, they received a power of giving the Holy Ghost
in confirmation, and of giving his grace in the collation of holy Orders, a
power of jurisdiction and authority to govern the Church: and this power was
not temporary, but successive and perpetual, and was intended as an ordinary
office in the Church, so that the successors of the Apostles had the same right
and institution that the Apostles themselves had, and though the personal
mission was not immediate, as of the Apostles it was, yet the commission and
institution of the function was all one. But to the 72 Christ gave no
commission but of preaching, which was a very limited commission. There was all
the immediate Divine institution of Presbyterate as a distinct order, that can
be fairly pretended. But yet farther, these 72 the Apostles did admit in
partem sollicitudinis, and by new ordination or delegation Apostolical, did
give them power of administering Sacraments, of absolving sinners, of governing
the Church in conjunction and subordination to the Apostles, of which they had
a capacity by Christ's calling them at first in sortem Ministerii, but the
exercise, and the actuating of this capacity they had from the Apostles. So
that not by Divine ordination, or immediate commission from Christ, but by
derivation from the Apostles (and therefore in minority and subordination to
them) the Presbyters did exercise acts of order and jurisdiction in the absence
of the Apostles or Bishops, or in conjunction consiliary, and by way of advice,
or before the consecration of a Bishop to a particular Church. And all this I
doubt not, but was done by the direction of the Holy Ghost, as were all other
acts of Apostolical ministration, and particularly the institution of the
other order, viz. of Deacons. This is all that can be proved out of Scripture
concerning the commission given in the institution of Presbyters, and this I
shall afterward confirm by the practice of the Catholic Church, and so
vindicate the practices of the present Church, from the common prejudices that
disturb us, for by this account, Episcopacy is not only a Divine institution,
but the only order that derives immediately from Christ.

For the present only, I sum up this with that saying of Theodoret speaking
of the 72 Disciples. In Lucae cap. 10.
Palmae sunt isti qui nutriuntur ac erudiuntur ab Apostolis. Nam quanquam
Christus hos etiam elegit, erant tamen duodecem illis inferiores, and
posteaillorum Discipuli and sectatores. The Apostles are the twelve fountains,
and the 72 are the palms that are nourished by the waters of those fountains.
For though Christ also ordained the 72, yet they were inferior to the Apostles,
and afterward were their followers and Disciples.

I know no objection to hinder a conclusion; only two or three words out of
Ignatius, are pretended against the maine question, viz. to prove that he,
although a Bishop, yet had no Apostolical authority, (...), I do not command
Epist. ad Philadelph.
this as an Apostle; (for what am I, and what is my Fathers house, that I
should compare my self with them) but as your fellow soldier and a Monitor.
But this answers it self, if we consider to whom he speaks it. Not to his own
Church of Antioch, for there he might command as an Apostle, but to the
Philadelphians he might not, they were no part of his Diocese, he was not
their Apostle, and then because he did not equal the Apostles in their
commission extraordinary, in their personal privileges, and in their
universal jurisdiction, therefore he might not command the Philadelphians,
being another Bishops charge, but admonish them with the freedom of a
Christian Bishop, to whom the souls of all faithful people were dear and
precious. So that still Episcopacy and Apostolate may be all one in ordinary
office, this hinders not, and I know nothing else pretended, and that Antiquity
is clearly on this side, is the next business.

For, hitherto the discourse has been of the immediate Divine institution of
Episcopacy, by arguments derived from Scripture; I shall only add two more
from Antiquity, and so pass on to tradition 10. So that Bishops are successors
in the office of Apostleship, according to the general tenent of Antiquity.
Apostolical.

1. THE belief of the primitive Church is, that Bishops are the ordinary
successors of the Apostles, and Presbyters of the 72, and therefore did believe
that Episcopacy is as truly of Divine institution as the Apostolate, for the
ordinary office both of one and the other is the same thing. For this there is
abundant testimony. Some I shall select, enough to give fair evidence of a
Catholic tradition.

S. Irenaeus is very frequent and confident in this Lib. 3. cap. 3.
particular, Habemus annumerare eos qui ab Apostolis instituti sunt Episcopi in
Ecclesiis, ET SUCCESSORES EORUM usque ad nos... Etenim si recondita mysteria
scissent Apostoli... his vel maxim traderent ea quibus etiam ipsas Ecclesias
committebant... quos and SUCCESSORES relinquebant SUUM IPSORUM LOCUM MAGISTERII
tradentes. We can name the men the Apostles made Bishops in their several
Churches, appointing them their successors, and most certainly those mysterious
secrets of Christianity which them selves knew; they would deliver to them to
whom they committed the Churches, and left to be their successors in the same
power and authority themselves had.

Tertullian reckons Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica, Ephesus and others to be
Churches Apostolical, Lib. de praescript. c. 36.
apud quas ipsae adhuc Cathedrae Apostolorum suis locis praesident.
Apostolical they are from their foundation, and by their succession, for
Apostles did found them, and Apostles, or men of Apostolic authority still do
govern them.

S. Cyprian; Hoc enim vel maxim Frater, and laboramus and laborare debemus ut
Vnitatem a Domino, and Epist. 42. ad Cornelium.
per Apostolos NOBIS SUCCESSORIBUS traditam quantum possumus obtinere curemus.
We must preserve the Unity commanded us by Christ, and delivered by his
Apostles to us their Successors. To us Cyprian and Cornelius, for they only
were then in view, the one Bishop of Rome, the other of Carthage. And in his
Epistle ad Florentium Pupianum; Nec haec jacto, Epist. 69.
sed dolens profero, cum te Iudicem Dei constituas and Christi, qui dicit ad
Apostolos ac per hoc adomnes praepositos qui Apostolis Vicaria ordinatione
succedunt, quivos audit, me audit, etc. Christ said to his Apostles, and in
them to the Governors or Bishops of his Church who succeeded the Apostles as
Vicars in their absence, he that hears you hears me.

Famous is that saying of Clarus a Muscula the Bishop, spoken in the Council
of Carthage and repeated by S. Austin, Manifesta est sententia Domini Lib. 7.
c. 43. de baptis. cont. Donatist.
nostri Jesus Christi Apostolos suos mittentis and ipsis solis potestatem a
patre sibi datam permittentis, quibus nos successimus eadem potestate Ecclesiam
Domini gubernantes. Nos successimus. We succeed the Apostles governing the
Church by the same power. He spoke it in full Council in an assembly of
Bishops, and himself was a Bishop.

The Council of Rome under S. Sylvester speaking of the honor due to Bishops
expresses it thus, Non oportere quenquam Domini Discipulis, id est, Apostolorum
successoribus detrahere. No man must detract from the Disciples of our Lord,
that is, from the Apostles successors.

S. Hierome speaking against the Montanists for Epist. 54.
undervaluing their Bishops, shows the difference of the Catholics honoring,
and the Heretics disadvantaging that sacred order. Apud nos (says he)
Apostolorum locum Episcopi tenent, apud eos Episcopus tertius est. Bishops with
us [Catholicks] have the place or authority of Apostles, but with them
[Montanists] Bishops are not the first but the third state of Men. And upon
that of the Psalmist, pro Patribus nati sunt tibi filii, S. Hierome, and
diverse others of the Fathers make this gloss, Pro Patribus Apostolis filii
Episcopi ut Episcopi Apostolis tanquam filii Patribus succedant; The Apostles
are Fathers, instead of whom Bishops do succeed, whom God has appointed to be
made Rulers in all lands. So S. Hierome, S. Austin, and Euthymius upon the 44.
Psalm. alias 45.

But S. Austin for his own particular makes good De verbis Dom, sermon. 24
use of his succeeding the Apostles, which would do very well now also to be
considered. Si solis Apostolis dixit, qui vos spernit me spernit, spernite nos:
si autem sermo ejus pervenit ad nos, and vocavit nos, and in eorum loco
constituit nos, videte ne spernatis nos. It was good counsel not to despise
Bishops, for they being in the Apostles places and offices are concerned and
protected by that saying, he that despises you, despises me. I said it was
good counsel, especially if besides all these, we will take also S.
Chrysostomes testimony, Potestas anatthematizandiab Apostolis ad successores
eorum nimirum Episcopos transiit. A power of anathematizing delinquents is
derived from the Apostles to their successors, even to Bishops.

S. Ambrose upon that of S. Paul Ephesians. 4. Quosdam In Ephesians. 4.
dedit Apostolos, Apostoli Episcopi sunt, He has given Apostles, that is, he
has given some Bishops. In 1. Corinthians. 12. 28.
That Is down right, and this came not by chance from him; he doubles his
assertion. Caput itaque in Ecclesi a Apostolos posuit, qui legati Christi sunt,
sicut dicit idem Apostolus [pro quo legatione fungimur.] Ipsisunt Episcopi,
firmante istud Petro Apostolo, and dicente inter caetera de Judah, and
Episcopatum ejus accipiat alter. And a third time. Numquid omnes Apostoli? In
verse. 29. ibid.
verum est; Quia in Ecclesia Vnus est Episcopus. Bishop and Apostle was all one
with S. Ambrose, when he spoke of their ordinary offices; which puts me in
mind of the fragment of Polycrates Biblioth. Phot. n. 254.
of the Martyrdom of Timothy in Photius, (...). The Apostle Timothy was
ordained Bishop in the Metropolis of Ephesus by S. Paul, and there enthroned.
To this purpose are those compellations and titles of Bishoprics usually in
antiquity. S. Basil calls a Bishopric, (...), and (...). So Theodoret. An
Apostolical presidency. Lih. 4. c. 18.
The sum is the same which S. Peter himself taught the Church, as S. Clement
his Scholar, or some other primitive man in his name reports of him. Epis^^pos
ergo vicem Apostolorum gerere Dominum Epist. 1.
docuisse dicebat, and reliquorum Discipulorum vicem tenere Presbyteros debere
insinuabat. He [Peter] said that our Lord taught that Bishops were to succeed
in the place of the Apostles, and Presbyters in the place of the Disciples. Who
desires to be farther satisfied concerning Catholic consent, for Bishops
succession to Apostles in their order and ordinary office, he may see it in
Epist. 1. ad Simpron.
Pacianus the renowned Bishop of Barcinona, in Homil. 26. in Evang.
S. Gregory, Orat. 2. de imagine.
S. John Damascen, in S. Sixtus the first his second decretall Epistle, and
most plentifully in Epist. 7.
S. Caelestine writing to the Ephesine Council, in the Epistle of Habetur Can.
in Novo distinct. 21.
Anacletus de Patriarchis and Primatibus etc. In In synod. Hispal.
Isidore, and in Lib. 3. c. 15. super Lucam.
Venerable Bede. His words are these, sicut duodecem Apostolos formam
Episcoporum exhibere simul and demonstrare nemo est qui dubitet: sic and 72
figuram Presbyterorum gessisse sciendum est, tametsi primis Ecclesiae
temporibus, ut Apostolica Scriptura testis est, utrique Presbyteri, and utrique
vocabantur Episcopi, quorum unum scientiae maturitatem, aliud industriam curae
Pastoralis significat. Sunt ergo jure Divino Episcopi a Presbyteris praelatione
distincti. As no man doubts but Apostles were the order of Bishops; so the 72
of Presbyters, though at first they had names in common. Therefore Bishops by
Divine right are distinct from Presbyters, and their Prelates or Superiors.

TO the same issue drive all those testimonies of 11. And particularly of S.
Peter,
Antiquity that call all Bishops ex aequo successors of S. Peter. So S.
Cyprian. Dominus noster cujus praecepta metuere and observare debemus, Episcopi
honorem and Ecclesiae suaerationem disponens in Evangelio, loquitur and dicit
Petro, ego tibi dico, Quia tu es Petrus, etc. Inde per temporum and
successionum vices, Epist. 27. ad Lapsos.
Episcoporum ordinatio and Ecclesiae ratio decurrit, ut Ecclesia super
Episcopos constituatur, etc. When our B. Savior was ordering his Church and
instituting Episcopal dignity, he said to Peter, thou art Peter, and on this
rock will I build my Church. Hence comes the order of Bishops, and the
constitution or being of the Church, that the Church be founded upon Bishops.
etc.

The same also S Jerome intimate's, Non est facile Epist. 1.
stare loco Pauli, tenere gradum Petri. It is not a small thing, to stand in
the place of Paul, to obtain the degree of Peter, so he, while he disswades
Heliodorus from taking on him the great burden of the Episcopal office.
Pasceoves meas, said Christ to Peter, and feed the flock of God which is
amongst you said S. Peter to the Bishops of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bithynia. Similia enim Successoribus suis Petrus scripsit praecepta, says
Theodoret, S. Peter gave the same precepts to his successors which Lib. 12.
these. cap. 13. Orat. de laud. Basil:
Christ gave to him; And S. Ephrem speaking of S. Basil the Bishop of Caesarea
Cappadocia, and sicut rursus Petrus Ananiam and Saphiram fraudantes de precio
agri enecavit: ita and Basilius, locum Petri obtinens ejusque pariter
authoritatem libertatemque participans, suam ipsius promissionem fraudantem
Valentem redarguit ejusque filium morte mulctavit. As S. Peter did to Ananias
and Saphira, So Basil did to Valens and his Son for the same delinquency, for
he had the place, liberty, and authority of S. Peter.

Thus Gaudentius of Brixia calls S. Ambrose the tract. prima die suae ordinat.
Successor of S. Peter, and Gildas surnamed the wise, says that all evil
Bishops whatsoever do with unhallowed and unclean feet usurp the seat of
S. Peter. But this thing is of Catholic belief, and of this use. If the order
and office of the Apostolate Biblioth, S S. P P. ton. 5 in Eccles. ord. in
crepat.
be eternal and to be succeeded in, and this office Superior to Presbyters,
and not only of Divine institution, but indeed the only order which can
clearly show an immediate Divine commission for it is power and authority (as I
have proved of the function Apostolical) then those which do succeed the
Apostles in the ordinary office of Apostolate, have the same institution and
authority the Apostles had, as much as the successors of the Presbyters have
with the first Presbyters, and perhaps more.

For in the Apostolical ordinations, they did not proceed as the Church since
has done. Themselves had the whole Priesthood, the whole commission of the
Ecclesiastical power and all the offices. Now they in their ordayning
assistant Ministers, did not in every ordination give a distinct order, as the
Church has done since the Apostles. For they ordained some to distinct
offices, some to particular places, some to one part, some to another part of
Clericall employment, as S. Paul who was an Apostle yet was ordained by
imposition of hands to go to the Churches of the Uncircumcision, so was
Barnabas: S. John, and James, and Cephas to the Circumcision, and there was
scarce any public design or Grand employment but the Apostolic men had a new
ordination to it, a new imposition of hands as is evident in the Acts of the
Apostles. So that the Apostolical ordinations of the inferior Clergy were
only a giving of partilar commissions to particular men to officiate such
parts of the Apostolical calling as they would please to employ them in. Nay
sometimes their ordinations were only a delivering of Jurisdiction when the
persons ordained had the order before, as it is evident in the case of Paul and
Barnabas. Of Acts, 13.
the same consideration is the institution of Deacons to spiritual offices,
and it is very pertinent to this Question. For there is no Divine institution
for these rising higher then Apostolical ordinance; and so much there is for
Presbyters as they are now authorized; for such power the Apostles gave to
Presbyters as they have now, and sometimes more, as to Judas and Silas, and
diverse others, who therefore were more then mere Presbyters as the word is
now used.

* The result is this. The office and order of a Presbyter is but part of the
office and order of an Apostle, so is a Deacon, a lesser part, so is an
Evangelist, so is a Prophet, so is a Doctor, so is a helper, or a Surrogate in
Government, but these will not be called orders, every one of them will not I
am sure, atleast not made distinct orders by Christ, for it was in the Apostles
power to give any one or all these powers to any one man, or to distinguish
them into so many men, as there are offices, or to unite more or fewer of them.
All these I say, clearly make not distinct orders, and why are not all of them
of the same consideration? I would be answered from Grounds of Scripture. For
there we fix as yet.

* Indeed the Apostles did ordain such men, and scattered their power at
first, for there was so much employment in any one of them, as to require one
man for one office; but a while after they united all the lesser parts of power
into two sorts of men whom the Church has since distinguished by the Names of
Presbyters and Deacons, and called them two distinct orders. But yet if we
speak properly and according to the Exigence of Divine institution, there is
Vnum Sacerdotium, one Priesthood appointed by Christ, and that was, the
commission given by Christ to his Apostles, and to their Successors precisely,
and those other offices of Presbyter and Deacon are but members of the Great
Priesthood, and although the power of it, is all of Divine institution, as the
power to baptize, to preach, to consecrate, to absolve, to Minister, yet that
so much of it should be given to one sort of men, so much less to another,
that is only of Apostolical ordinance. For the Apostles might have given to
some only a power to absolve, to some only to consecrate, to some only to
baptize. We see that to Deacons they did so. They had only a power to baptize
and preach, whether all Evangelists had so much or no, Scripture does not tell
us.

* But if to some men they had only given a power to use the Keys, or made
them officers spiritual to restore such as are overtaken in a fault, and not
to consecrate the Eucharist, (for we see these powers are distinct, and not
relative and of necessary conjunction, no more then baptizing and consecrating)
whether or no had those men who have only a power of absolving or consecrating
respectively, whether (I say) have they the order of a Presbyter? If yea, then
now every Priest has two orders besides the order of Deacon, for by the power
of Consecration he has the power of a Presbyter, and what is he then by his
other power? But if such a man ordayn'd with but one of these powers have not
the order of a Presbyter, then let any man show me where it is ordained by
Christ, or indeed by the Apostles, that an order of Clerks should be
constituted with both these powers, and that these were called Presbyters. I
only leave this to be considered.

* But all the Apostolical power we find instituted by Christ, and we also
find a necessity, that all that power should be succeeded in, and that all that
power should be united in one order, for he that has the highest, viz. a power
of ordination, must needs have all the other, else he cannot give them to any
else, but a power of ordination I have proved to be necessary and perpetual.

So that, we have clear evidence of the Divine institution of the perpetual
order of Apostleship, mary for the Presbyterate I have not so much either
reason or confidence for it, as now it is in the Church; but for the
Apostolate, it is beyond exception. And to this Bishops do succeed. For that
it is so, I have proved from Scirpture, and because [no Scripture is of private
interpretation] I have attested it with the Catholic testimony of the
Primitive Fathers, calling Episcopacy, the Apostolate, and Bishops successors
of S. Peter in particular, and of all the Apostles in general in their ordinary
offices in which they were Superior to the 72, the Antecessors of the
Presbyterate.

One objection, I must clear. For sometimes Presbyters are also called
Apostles, and Successors of the Apostles, as in Ignatius, in Irenaeus, in S.
Hierome. I answer,

1. They are not called Successores Apostolorum by any dogmaticall resolution
or interpretation of Scripture, as the Bishops are in the examples above
alleged; but by allusion, and participation at the most. For true it is that
they succeed the Apostles in the offices of baptizing, consecrating, and
absolving in privato foro, but this is but part of the Apostolical power, and
no part of their office as Apostles were superior to Presbyters.

2. It is observeable that Presbyters are never affirmed to succeed in the
power and regiment of the Church, but in subordination, and derivation from the
Bishop, and therefore they are never said to succeed in Cathedris Apostolorum,
in the Apostolic Sees.

3. The places which I have specifyed, and they are all I could ever meet
with, are of peculiar answer. For as for Ignatius in his Epistle to the Church
of Trallis, Jdem fere habet in Epist. ad Magnes: and Smyrnens.
he calls the Presbytery or company of Priests, the College, or combination of
Apostles. But here S. Ignatius as he lifts up the Presbyters to a comparison
with Apostles, so he also raises the Bishop to the similitude and resemblance
with God. Episcopus typum Dei Patris omnium gerit, Presbyteri vero sunt
conjunctus Apostolorum caetus. So that although Presbyters grow high yet they
do not overtake the Bishops, or Apostles, who also in the same proportion grow
higher then their first station. This then, will do no hurt.

As for S. Irenaeus, he indeed does say that Presbyters succeed the Apostles,
but what Presbyters he means, he tells us, even such Presbyters as were also
Bishops, such as S. Peter and S. John was, who call themselves Presbyters, his
words are these. Propterea Lib. 4. c. 43.
eis qui in Ecclesia sunt Presbyteris abaudire oportet his qui successionem
habent ab Apostolis, qui cum Episcopatus successione charisma veritatis certum
secundum placitum Patris acceperunt. And a little after, Cap. 44.
Tales Presbyteros nutrit Ecclesia, de quibus and Propheta ait, and dabo
Principes tuos in pace, and Episcopos tuos in Iustitia. So that he gives
testimony for us, not against us. As for S. Hierome, the third man, he in the
succession to the honor of the Apostolate joins Presbyters with Bishops, and
that is right enough, for if the Bishop alone does succeed in plenitudinem
potestatis Apostolicae ordinariae, as I have proved he does, then also it is as
true of the Bishop together with his consessus Presbyterorum. Epist. 13.
Episcopi and Presbyteri habeant in exemplum Apostolos and Apostolicos viros,
quorum honorem possidentes, habere nitantur and meritum, those are his words,
and enforce not so much as may be safely granted, for reddendo singula
singulis, Bishops succeed Apostles, and Presbyters Apostolic men, and such
were many that had not at first any power Apostolical, and that is all that can
be inferred from this place of S. Hierome. I know nothing else to stay me, or
to hinder our assent to those authorities of Scripture I have alleged, and
the full voice of traditive interpretation.

THE second argument from Antiquity is the 12. And the institution of
Episcopacy as well as of the Apostolate expressed to be Divine, by primitive
authority, Epist. 27.
direct testimony of the Fathers for a Divine institution. In this S. Cyprian
is most plentiful. Dominus noster. ** Episcopi honorem and Ecclesiae suae
rationem disponens in Evangelio, dicit Petro etc: Inde per temporum and
successionum vices Episcoporum ordinatio and Ecclesiae ratio decurrit, ut
Ecclesia super Episcopos constituatur and omnis actus Ecclesiae per eosdem
Praepositos gubernetur. Cum hoc itaque Divina lege fundatum sit etc: Our Lord
did institute in the Gospel the honor of a Bishop. Hence comes the ordination
of Bishops, and the Church is built upon them, and every action of the Church
is to be governed by them, and this is founded upon a Divine law. Meminisse
autem Diaconi debent quoniam Epist. 65. ad Rogatian.
Apostolos, i. e. Episcopos, and praepositos Dominus elegit. Our Lord has
chosen Apostles, that is, Bishops and Church Governors. And a little after.
Quod si nos aliquid audere contra Deum possumus qui Episcopos facit, possunt
and contranos audere Diaconi, a quibus fiunt. We must not attempt any thing
against God who has instituted Bishops. The same Father in his Epistle to
Magnus disputes against Novatianus his being a Bishop. Novatianus in Ecclesia
non Epist. 76.
est, nec Episcopus computari potest, qui Evangelica and Apostolica traditione
contempta, nemini succedens a seipso ordinatus est. If there was both an
Evangelicall, and an Apostolic tradition, for the successive ordination of
Bishops, by other Bishops, (as S. Cyprian affirms there is, by saying
Novatianus contemned it,) then certainly the same Evangelicall power did
institute that calling, for the modus of whose election, it took such
particular order.

S. Ignatius long before him, speaking concerning his absent friend Sotion the
Deacon, (...). Epist, ad Magnes.
He wishes for the good man's company, because by the grace of God, and
according to the law of Jesus Christ, he was obedient to the Bishop and his
Clergy. And a little after. (...). It is home enough. Ye ought to obey your
Bishop, and to contradict him in nothing. It is a fearful thing to contradict
him: For whosoever does so, does not mock a visible man, but the invisible,
undeceiveable God. For this contumely relates not to man but to God. So S.
Ignatius, which could not be true, were it a humane constitution and no Divine
ordinance. But more full are those words of his in his Epistle to the
Ephesians, (...). He that obeyes the Bishop and Clergy obeyes Christ, who did
constitute and ordain them. This is plain and dogmaticall, I would be loath to
have two men so famous, so Ancient, and so resolute, speak half so much
against us.

But it is a general resolve, and no private opinion. Quaest. Vet. and N.
Testam. qu. 97.
For S. Austin is confident in the case with a Nemo ignorant Episcopos
Salvatorem Ecclesiis instituisse. Ipse enim priusquam in coelos ascenderet,
imponens manum Apostolis, ordinavit eos Episcopos. No man is so ignorant but he
knows that our blessed Savior appointed Bishops over Churches, for before his
ascension into Heaven, he ordained the Apostles to be Bishops. But long before
him,

Hegesippus going to Rome, and by the way calling Eusebius. lib. 4. c. 22.
in at Corinth, and diverse other Churches, discoursed with their several
Bishops, and found them Catholic and Holy, and then staid at Rome three
successions of Bishops, Anicetus, Soter, and Eleutherius. Sed in omnibus is it is
ordinationibus, vel in caeteris quas per reliquas urbes videram it a omnia
habebantur, sicut lex antiquitus tradidit, and Prophetae indicaverunt, ET
DOMINUS STATUIT. All things in these ordinations or successions were as our
Lord had appointed. All things, therefore both of doctrine and discipline, and
therefore the ordinations themselves too. Further yet, and it is worth
observing, there was never any Bishop of Rome from S. Peter to S. Sylvester,
that ever writ decretall Epistle now extant and transmitted to us, but either
professedly or accidentally he said or intimated, that the order of Bishops did
come from God.

S. Irenaeus speaking of Bishops successors to the Lib. 4. c. 43.
Apostles, says that with their order of Bishopric, they have received
charisma veritatis certum, a true, and certain or indelible character;
secundum placitum Patris, according to the will of God the Father. And this
also is the doctrine of S. Ambrose, Ideo quanquam melior In 1. Corinthians. 12.
Apostolus aliquando tamen eget Prophetis, and quia ab uno Deo Patre sunt
omnia, singulos Episcopos singulis Ecclesiis praeesse decrevit. God from whom
all good things do come, did decree that every Church should be governed by a
Bishop. And again, De dignit. Sacerd. cap. 2.
Honorigitur, Fratres, and sublimit as Episcopalis, nullis poterit
comparationibus adaequari; Si Regum fulgori compares etc: and a little after,
Quid jam de plebeia dixerim multitudine, cui non solum praeferri a Domino
meruit, sed ut eam quoque jure tueatur patrio, praeceptis imperatum est
Evangelicis. The honor and sublimity of the Bishop is an incomparable
pre-eminence and is by God set over the people, and it is commanded by the
precept of the holy Gospel that he should guide them by a Fathers right. And
in the close of his discourse, Sic certe a Domino ad B. Petrum dicitur, Petre
amas me?.... repetitum est a Domino tertio, Pasce oves meas. Quas oves, and
quem gregem non solum tunc B. suscepit Petrus, sed and cum illo nos suscepimus
omnes. Our blessed Lord committed his sheep to S. Peter to be fed, and in him
we (who have Pastoral or Episcopal authority) have received the same
authority and commission. Thus also diverse of the Fathers speaking of the
ordination of S. Timothy to be Bishop, and of S. Paul's intimation, that it was
by Prophecy, affirm it to be done by order of the Holy Ghost. (...), says S.
Chrysostom he was ordained by Prophecy, Homil. 4. Graec. 5. lat. in 1. Tim. 1.
cap. In 1. Tit.
that is by the Holy Ghost. (...), Thou were not made Bishop by humane
constitution. (...), so Oecumenius, By Divine revelation, says Theodoret. By
the command of the Holy Ghost, so Theophylact; and indeed so S. Paul, to the
assembly of Elders and Bishops met at Miletus, Spiritus S. posuit vos
Episcopos, Acts 20.
the Holy Ghost has made you Bishops: and to be sure S. Timothy was amongst
them, and he was a Bishop, and so were diverse others there present; therefore
the order it self is a ray streaming from the Divine beauty, since a single
person was made Bishop by revelation. I might multiply authorities in this
particular, which are very frequent and confident for the Divine institution of
Episcopacy, in Hom. 32. in Johan.
Origin, in the Council of Carthage recorded by S. Cyprian, in the collection
of the Can. 6.
Oriental Canons by Martinus Bracarensis: in the Counsels of C. 25.
Aquisgrane, and Octauum Can. 7.
Toledo, and many more. The sum is that which was taught by Epist. 2.
S. Sixtus, Apostolorum dispositione, ordinante Domino Episcopi primitus sunt
constituti. The Lord did at first ordain, and the Apostles did so order it,
and so Bishops at first had their Original constitution.

These and all the former who affirm Bishops to be successors of the Apostles,
and by consequence to have the same institution, drive all to the same issue,
and are sufficient to make faith, that it was the dodoctrine Primitive, and
Catholic that Episcopacy is a divine institution, which Christ Planted in the
first founding of Christendom, which the Holy Ghost Watered in his first
descent on Pentecost, and to which we are confident that God will give an
increase by a never failing succession, unless where God removes the
Candlestick, or which is all one, takes away the star, the Angel of light
from it, that it may be invelop'd in darkness, usque ad consummationem saeculi
and aperturam tenebrarum. The conclusion of all, I subjoyne in the words of
Venerable Bede before quoted, sunt ergo jure Divino Episcopi Lib. 3. in Lucam.
c. 15.
a Presbyter is praelatione distincti. Bishops are distinct from Presbyters,
and Superior to them by the law of God.

THE second Basis of Episcopacy is Apostolical tradition. We have seen what
Christ did, now we shall see what was done by his Apostles. And since they
knew their Masters mind so well, we can never better confide in any argument
to prove Divine institution of a derivative authority then the practice
Apostolical. Apostoli enim Discipuli Lib. 3. cap. 5.
veritatis existentes, extra omne mendacium sunt, non enim communicate mendacium
veritati, sicut non communicant tenebraeluci, sed praesentia alterius 13. In
pursuance of the Divine institution, the Apostles did ordain Bishops in
several Churches,
excludit alterum. says S. Irenaeus.

FIrst, then, the Apostles did presently after the ascension fix an Apostle or
a Bishop in the chair of Jerusalem. For they knew that Jerusalem was shortly
to be destroyed, they themselves foretold of miseryes and desolations to ensue,
(Petrus and Paulus praedicunt cladem Hierosolymitanam, says Lactantius l. 4.
inst.) famines and wars, and not a stone left upon another was the fate of
that Rebellious City by Christ's own prediction, which themselves recorded in
Scripture. And to say they understood not what they writ, is to make them
Enthusiasts, and neither good Doctors nor wise seers. But it is (...) that the
holy Spirit which was promised to lead them into all truth would instruct them
in so concerning an issue of public affairs, as was so Great desolation, and
therefore they began betimes to establish that Church, and to fix it upon it is
perpetual base. 2ly The Church of Jerusalem was to be the president and
platform for other Churches. [The word of God went forth into all the world,
beginning first at Ierusalem], and therefore also it was more necessary a
Bishop should be there placed betimes, that other Churches might see their
government from whence they received their doctrine, that they might see from
what stars their continual flux of light must stream. 3ly The Apostles
were actually dispersed by persecution, and this to be sure they looked for,
and therefore (so implying the necessity of a Bishop to govern in their
absence or decession any ways) they ordayn'd S. James the first Bishop of
Jerusalem; there he fixed As S. James at Jerusalem.
his chair, there he lived Bishop for 30 years, and finished his course with
glorious Martyrdom. If this be proov'd we are in a fair way for practice
Apostolical.

First, let us see all that is said of S. James in Scripture, that may concern
this affayre. Acts. 15. We find S. James in the Synod at Jerusalem, not
disputing, but giving final determination to that Great Qu: about
Circumcision. [And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said
etc:] He first drove the question to an issue, and told them what he believed
concerning it, with a (...), we trust it will go as well with us without
circumcision, as with our Forefathers who used it. But S. James when he had
summed up what had been said by S. Peter, gave sentence and final
determination. (...) wherefore I judge or give sentence. So he. The Acts of
Council which the Brethren or Presbyters did use were deliberative, they
disputed, v. 7. S. Peter's act was declarative, but S. James his was decisive;
which proves him clearly (if by reasonableness of the thing and the
successive practice of Christendom in imitation of this first Council
Apostolical we may take our estimate) that S. James was the President of this
Synod, which considering that he was none of the twelve (as I proved formerly)
is unimaginable, were it not for the advantage of the place, it being held in
Jerusalem, where he was Hierosolymorum Episcopus (as S. Clement call's him)
especially in the presence of S. Peter, who was primus Apostolus, and decked
with many personal privileges and prerogatives.

* Add to this, that although the whole Council did consent to the sending of
the Decretall Epistle, and to send Judas and Silas, yet because they were of
the Presbytery, and College of Jerusalem, S. James his Clergy, they are said,
as by way of appropriation to come from S. James. Gal. 2. v. 12. Upon which
place S. Austin says thus, Cum vidisset quosdam venisse a Iacobo, i. e. a
Iudaea, nam Ecclesiae Hierosolymitanae Iacobus praefuit. To this purpose that
of Ignatius is very pertinent calling S. Stephen the Deacon of S. James, and in
his Epistle to Epist. ad Trall,
Hero, saying that he did Minister to S. James and the Presbyters of Jerusalem,
which if we expound according to the known discipline of the Church in
Ignatius time (who was Suppar Apostolorum, only not a contemporary Bishop)
here is plainly the eminency of an Episcopal chair, and Jerusalem the seat
of S. James, and the Clergy his own, of a College of which he was the
praepositus Ordinarius, he was their Ordinary.

* The second evidence of Scripture is [Acts. 21. And when we were come to
Jerusalem the Brethren received us gladly, and the day following Paul went in
with us unto James, and all the Elders were present.] Why unto James? Why not
rather into the Presbytery, or College of Elders, if James did not eminere,
were not the (...), the Praepositus or Bishop of them all?

Now that these conjectures are not vain and impertinent, see it testified by
Antiquity, to which in matter of fact, and Church-story, he that will not give
faith upon concurrent testimonies, and uncontradicted by Antiquity is a mad
man, and may as well disbeleive every thing that he has not seen himself,
and can no way prove that himself was Christened, and to be sure, after 1600
years there is no possibility to disprove a matter of fact that was never
questioned or doubted of before, and therefore can never obtain the faith of
any man to his contradictory, it being impossible to prove it.

Eusebius reports out of S. Clement. (...). lib. 2. hist. cap. 1.
S. Peter and S. John although they were honored of our Lord, yet they would
not themselves be, but made James surnamed the Just, Bishop of Jerusalem; And
the reason is that which is given by Hegesippus in Eusebius for his successor
Simeon Cleophae, for when S. James was crowned with Martyrdom, and immediately
the City destroyed, Traditur Apostolos qui supererant in lib. 3. c. 11.
commune consilium habuisse quem oportere dignum SUCCESSIONE IACOBI Judicari.
It was concluded for Simeon, because he was the Kinsman of our Lord as S. James
also his Predecessor. The same concerning S. James is also repeated by
Eusebius. Iudaeiergo cum Paulus provocasset ad Caesarem.....In Iacobum fratrem
Domini cur AB APOSTOLIS SEEDS lib. 2. c. 22.
HIEROSOLYMITANA DELATA FUIT, Omnem suam malevolentiam convertunt.

In the Apostolical constitutions under the name of S. Clement the Apostles
are brought in speaking lib. 7. c. 46. and lib. 8. cap. ult:
thus. De ordinatis autem a nobis Episcopis in vita nostra, significamus vobis
quod hi sunt; Hierosolymis ordinatus est Iacobus Frater Domini. S. James the
Brother of our Lord was ordained Bishop of Jerusalem by us [Apostles.] The same
is witnessed by Anacletus. Porro and Hierosolymitarum primus Episcopus Epist. 2.
B. Iacobus qui Iustus dicebatur, and secundum carnem Domini nuncupatus est
frater, a Petro, Iacobo, and Iohanne Apostolis est ordinatus. And the same
thing in terms is repeated by Anicetus, with a Scimus enim Beatissimum Iacobum
etc: Just as Anacletus before. Epist. decret. Unic:
S. James was Bishop of Jerusalem, and Peter, James, and John were his
Ordayners.

But letus see the testimony of one of S. James his Successors in the same
Chair, who certainly was the best witness of his own Church Records. S.
Cyrill of Jerusalem is the man. Nam de his non mihi solum, sed etiam Apostolis,
and IACOBO HUIVS ECCLESIae Catech. 4.
OLIM EPISCOPO curae fuit, speaking of the question of circumcision, and things
sacrificed to Idols, and again, he calls S. James, primum hujus parochiae
Catech. 16.
Episcopum, the first Bishop of this Diocese. S. Austin also attests this
story. Cathedratibi quid lib: 2. cont. lit: Petilic. 51. and lib: 2. cont:
Crescon: c. 37.
fecit Ecclesiae Romanae, in qua Petrus sedit, and in qua hodie Anastasius
sedet? Vel Ecclesiae Hierosolymitanae IN QVA IACOBUS SEDIT, and in qua hodie
Johannes sedet? I must not omit the testimony of S. Jerome, for it will be of
great use in the sequel, Iacobus lib: de Script. Eccles. in lacobo.
(says he) post passionem Domini statim ab Apostolis Hierosolymorum Episcopus
ordinatus, and the same also he repeates out of Hegesippus. * There are many
more testimonies to this purpose, as of S. homil: 38. in 1. Cor. 15. and 33.
hom: in 15. Act.
Chrysostom, haeres. 66.
Epiphanius, S. in 1. Galat.
Ambrose, the Council of cap. 33.
Constantinople in Trullo. But Gregorius Turonensis rises a little higher,
Iacobus Frater Domini vocitatus, ab ipso Domino nostro Jesus Christo Episcopus
dicitur ordinatus. S. James the Brother of our Lord is said to have been
ordained Bishop by our Lord Jesus Christ himself. If by [Ordinatus] he means
[designatus] he agrees with S. Chrysostom: But either of them both will serve
the turn for the present. homil. 3. in Act.
But either in one sense or the other it is true, and attested also by
Epiphanius, and primus hic accepit Cathedram Episcopatus, cui concredidit
Dominus haeres. 78.
thronum suum in terra primo. S. James had first the Episcopal chair, for our
Lord first entrusted his earthly throne to him. And thus we are incircled with
a cloud of witnesses, to all which if we add what I before observed, that S.
James is in Scripture called an Apostle, and yet he was none of the twelve, and
that in the sense of Scripture and the Catholic Church, a Bishop and an
Apostle is all one, it follows from the premises, (and of them already there
is faith enough made) that S. James was by Christ's own designation, and
ordination Apostolical made Bishop of the Church of Jerusalem, that is, had
power Apostolical concredited to him which Presbyters had not, and this
Apostolate was limited and fixed, as his Successors since have been.

But that this also was not a temporary business, and to expire with the
persons of S. James and the S. Simeon to be his successor,
first Apostles, but a regiment of ordinary and successive duty in the Church,
it appears by the ordination of S. Simeon the son of Cleophas to be his
Successor. It is witnessed by Eusebius, Post martyrium lacobi....traditur
Apostolos etc. habuisse in commune lib. 3. hist. cap. 11.
Concilium quem oporteret dignum successione Iacobi judicari; omnesque uno
consilio, atque uno consensu Simeonem Cleophae filium decrevisse ut Episcopatus
sedem susciperet. The same also he transcribes out of Hegesippus, Posteaquam
Iacobus Martyr effectus est lib 4. cap. 22.
....electione divina Simeon Cleophae filius Episcopus ordinatur, electus ab
omnibus pro eo quod esset consobrinus Domini. S. Simeon was ordayn'd Bishop by
a Divine election; And Epiphanius in the Catalogue of the Bishops of Jerusalem,
reckons first haeres. 66.
James, and next Simeon, qui sub Trajano crucifixus est.

THe next Bishop we find ordayn'd by the Apostles 14. S. Timothy at Ephesus,
was Timothy at Ephesus. That he was ordayn'd by an Apostle appears in
Scripture. For S. Paul imposed hands on him, that is certain, Excita Gratiam
quae in te est per impositionem manuum mearum, by the laying on of MY HANDS.
That he was there a Bishop is also apparent, from the power and 2. Tim. 1. 6.
offices concredited to him. 1. He was to be 1. Tim. 1. 3.
resident at Ephesus. And although for the public necessityes of the Church,
and for assistance to S. Paul he might be called sometimes from his Charge, yet
there he lived and dyed as the Church story writes, there was his ordinary
residence, and his avocations were but temporary and occasional, and when it
was, his Cure was supplied by Tychicus, whom S. Paul sent to Ephesus as his
Vicar, as I shall show hereafter.

2. S. Paul in his epistles to him, gave directions to him for Episcopal
deportment as is plain. A Bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
etc. 1. Tim. 3.


3. S. Paul concredits jurisdiction to S. Timothy. Over the people; (...) is of
as great extent in S. Timothies commission as (...). Commanding as teaching.
Over Presbyters; but yet so as to make difference between them and the
Neotericks in Christianity, the one as Fathers, the other as Brethren. (...) is
denied to be used toward 1. Tim. 5. 1.
either of them. (...) says Suidas, a dishonorable upbraiding or objurgation.
Nay it is more; (...) is castigo, plagam infero, says Budaeus: so that, that
kind of Rebuking the Bishop is forbidden to use, either toward Priest or
Deacon, Clergy or Laity, Old or Young. [for a Bishop must be no striker.] but
(...), that is given him in commission both to old and young, Presbyters and
Catechumens, that is, Require them; postula, provoca, (...). Synesius. To be
provoked to a Duel, to be challenged. and (...), Chrysostom. Ad precandum vos
provoco. (...). Eurip. Thou make me, or compellest me to shed tears.
Suaviter omnia. That Is the way S. Paul takes. Meekely; but yet so as to do his
office, to keep all in their several duties, and that is by a (...), command
these things, for so he sums up the Bishops duty toward Presbyters,
Neophytes, and Widows. Give all these things in charge. Command all to do 1.
Tim. 5. 7.
their duty. Command, but not objurgate. Et quid negotii esset Episcopo ut
Presbyterum non objurgaret si super Presbyterum non haberet potestatem. So
Epiphanius urges this argument to advantage. For indeed, haeres. 7 5.
it had been to little purpose for S. Paul to have given order to Timothy, how
he should exercise his jurisdiction over Presbyters and people, if he had had
no jurisdiction and coercitive authority at all. Nay, and howsoever S. Paul
forbids to Timothy to use (...), which is (...), yet S. Paul in his second
Epistle bids him use it, intimating, upon great occasion. (...). To be sure
(...), if it be but an urging, or an exhortation, 2. Tim. 4. 2.
is not all, for S. Paul gives him coercitive jurisdiction, as well as
directive. Over Widows. (...). Reject the younger Widows, viz. a collegio
viduarum, ab eleemosynis Ecclesiae. Over Presbyters. for he commands him to
have sufficient probate in the accusation of Presbyters, of which if he was not
to take cognizance, it was to no purpose to number witnesses. (...). Receive
not a public accusation [in foro externo] against a Priest, Non vocabis in jus
nisi in testimonio duorum, etc. to wit, in causes criminal. That is sufficient
intimation of the Bishops power TO TAKE COGNIZANCE in causes criminal; then
for his punishing in such causes, it follows in the next words, (...). 1. Tim.
5. 20.
Reprehend them publicly, that is, disgrace them. For (...) is (...),
indecorus..... (...), Homer Iliad. g. So that (...) in S. Paul, is to call them
to public account; that is one part of the jurisdiction. (...), is to examine.
Plato Epist. (...), to give an account of one's life. idem in Apolog. And then
also it implies punishment upon conviction, (...)

(...). Hom. c. Iliad. But the words in S. Paul will clear this business. Let
them that sin be publikly shamed, (...), that the rest may fear; A
punishment most certainly, something that is (...), Malum in genere poenae.
What else should they fear? to sin? Most true. But why upon this
reprehension, if not for fear of being punished?

Add to all this, that here is in this chapter the plain giving of a
jurisdiction, an erection of a judicatory, and is all the way, direction for
his proceeding in causes criminal, appears most evidently, v. 21. I charge
thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect Angels, that thou
observe these things, (...), without prejudging the cause of any man before it
comes in open contestatio^ under public test of witnesses, (...), doing
nothing for favor or partiality. Nothing in the world is plainer for the
erection of a Consistory then these mandates of S. Paul.

Lastly, to make up his Episcopal function complete S. Paul gives him also
direction concerning giving of orders. [Lay hands suddenly on no man.] sub
testatione ergo ea quae ad ordinationem Ecclesiae mandat Verse. 22.
custodiri....Ne facile aliquis accipiat Ecclesiasticam dignitatem....peccat
enim si non probat and sic ordinet. Melior enim caeteris debet probari qui
ordinandus est. Haec Episcopus custodiens, castum se exhibebit religioni, cujus
rei in futuro praemium consequetur. So S. Ambrose upon the place, who is so
far from exempting Presbyters from being submitted to the Bishops consistory,
that he does appropriate all his former cautions concerning the judicature, and
coercitive jurisdiction to causes of the Clergy.

Add to this evidence of Scripture the testimony of Catholic and unquestioned
Antiquity affirming S. Timothy to have been ordained Bishop of Ephesus by S.
Paul. Eusebius speaking of the successions to S. Paul, sed and Lucas (says he)
in actibus Apostolorum Lib. 3. c. 4.
plurimos ejus socios memorat, sicut Timothei and Titi, quorum alter in Ephesi
Episcopus...ab eo ordinatus praeficitur. S. Ambrose affirms that S. Paul
having Praefat. in 1. Tim.
ordained him Bishop writes his first Epistle to him to instruct him in his
Episcopal office. Hunc igitur jam creatum Episcopum instruit per Epistolam
quomodo deberet Ecclesiam ordinare. And that this Epistle was written to
instruct S. Timothy for his own person, and all Bishops in him for their
deportment in the office of a Bishop is the united, concurrent testimony of S.
Contrhaeres.
Vincentius, contr. Marcion. l. 5.
Tertullian, S. hom. ^0 in 1. Timoth.
Chrysostom, S. in 6. cap. in 1. Tim.
Ambrose, in 1. Tim. 4. c. and 5. c.
Oecumenius, hoeres. 75.
Epiphanius, ad Timoth. cap. 4.
Primasius, and S. in Pastor. part. 2. c. 11. Acts. 11.
Gregory. As for Epiphanius in the place now quoted he uses it as an argument
against the madness and stupidity of Aerius contending a Bishop and a
Presbyter to be all one; docet Divinus Apostoli sermo quis sit Episcopus and
quis Presbyter quum dicit ad Timotheum qui erat Episcopus, Presbyterum ne
objurges, etc. I shall transcribe no more testimonies for this particular but
that of the general Council of Chalcedon in the case of Bassianus and
Stephanus; Leontius the Bishop of Magnesia spoke it in full Council, (...).
From S. Timothy until now there have been 27 Bishops or dayned in Ephesus.
Who desires a multitude of testimonies (though enough already have deposed in
the cause, beside the evidence of Scripture) may to these add that saying of
S. Chrysostom, that to Timothy was committed Jn Titum. and 1. Philip. In 1.
Tim. 3.
(...); of Theodoret, calling him Episcopum Asianorum; the subscription to the
first Epistle to Timothy, (which if it were not writ by S. Paul, yet at least,
will prove a primitive record, and very Ancient,) the fragment of the
Martyrdom of S. Timothy in Photius, De script. Eccles.
S. Jerome, In praefat. in 1. Timoth.
Theophylact, Biblioth: Photij. n. 254.
De vita and morte 88. 87, and 88.
Isidore, and Lib. 2. c. 34. 2. Tim. 4. 5.
Nicephorus.

And now all is well if after all this Timothy do not prove an Evangelist, for
this one objection will be sufficient to catch at to support a drowning cause,
and though neither pertinent nor true, yet shall be laid in the balance
against all the evidence of Scripture and Catholic antiquity. But [doe the
work of an Evangelist] (says S. Paul) therefore it is clear S. Timothy was no
Bishop. No, was not? That Is hard. But let us try however.

1. (...), those are the next words, fulfill thy Deaconship. And therefore he
was no Bishop? As well this as the other, for if Deaconship do not exclude
Episcopacy, why shall his being an Evangelist exclude it? Or why may not his
being a Deacon exclude his being an Evangelist, as well as his being an
Evangelist, exclude his being a Bishop? Whether is higher, a Bishopric, or the
office of an Evangelist? If a Bishops office be higher, and therefore cannot
consist with an Evangelist, then a Bishop cannot be a Priest, and a Priest
cannot be a Deacon, and an Evangelist can be neither, for that also is thought
to be higher then them both. But if the office of an Evangelist be higher, then
as long as they are not disparate, much less destructive of each other, they
may have leave to consist in subordination. For as for the pretense that an
Evangelist is an office of a moveable employment, and a Bishopric of fixed
residence, that will be considered by and by.

2. All the former discourse is upon supposition, that the word (...), implies
the office of a Deacon, and so it may as well as S. Paul's other phrase implies
S. Timothy to be an Evangelist. For if we mark it well it is (...), do the
work, not the office of an Evangelist. And what is that? We may see it in the
verses immediately going before, (...). And if this be the work of an Evangelist
which S. Paul would have Timothy perform, viz. to preach, to be instant in
season, and out of season, to reprove, to rebuke, to exhort, there is no harm
done, a Bihop may, nay he must do all this.

3. Consider we what an Evangelist is, and thence take our estimate for the
present. 1. He that writes the story of the Gospel is an Evangelist, so the
Greek Scholiast calls him. And in this sense indeed. S. Timothy was not an
Evangelist, but yet if he had, he might have been a Bishop, because S. Mark was
an Evangelist to be sure, and perhaps as sure that he was a Bishop; sure
enough; for they are both delivered to us by the Catholic testimony of the
Primitive Church, as we shall see hereafter, so far as concerns our
Question. But then again; an Apostle might be an Evangelist, S. Matthew was,
and S. John was, and the Apostolical dignity is as much inconsistent with the
office of an Evangelist, as Episcopal pre-eminence, for I have proved these
two names Apostle and Bishop to signify all one thing. 2. S. Ambrose gives
another exposition of In 4. Ephesians.
[Evangelists.] Evangelistae Diaconi sunt sicut fuit Philippus. S. Philip was
one of the seven, commonly called Deacons, and he was also a Presbyter, and
yet an Evangelist, and yet a Presbyter in it is proportion is an office of as
necessary residence as a Bishop, or else why are Presbyters cried out against
so bitterly in all cases, for non-residence, and yet nothing hinders, but that
S. Timothy, as well as S. Philip, might have been a Presbyter and an Evangelist
together, and then why not a Bishop too, for why should a Deaconship, or a
Presbyterate consist with the office of an Evangelist, more then a Bishopric?
3. Another acceptance of [Evangelist] is also in Eusebius. Sed and alii
plurimi per idem Lib. 3. hist. cap. 37.
tempus Apostolorum Discipuli superstites erant....Nonnulli ex his ardentiores
Divinae Philosophiae....animas suas verbo Dei consecrabant....ut si quibus
forte provinciis nomen fidei esset incognitum praedicarent, primaque apud eos
Evangelii fundamenta collocantes....Evangelistarum fungebantur officio. They
that planted the Gospel first in any Country, they were Evangelists. S.
Timothy might be such a one, and yet be a Bishop afterward. And so were some
of this sort of Evangelists. For so Eusebius, Primaque apudeos fundamenta
Evangelii collocantes, atque ELECTIS QUIBUS QUE EX IPSIS officium regendae
Ecclesiae quam fundaverant committentes, ipsi rursum ad alias gentes
properabant. So that they first converted the Nation, and then governed the
Church, first they were Evangelists and afterward Bishops; and so was Austin
the Monk that converted England in the time of S. Gregory and Ethelbert, he
was first our Evangelist, and afterward Bishop of Dover. Nay why may they not
in this sense be both Evangelists and Bishops at the same time, insomuch as
many Bishops have first planted Christianity in diverse Countries, as S.
Chrysostom Lib. 10. tripart. hist. cap. 5. Theodoret.
in Scythia, S. Trophimus, S. Denis, S. Mark, and many more. By the way only,
according to all these acceptations of the word [Evangelist] this office does
not imply a perpetual motion. Evangelists many of them did travel, but they
were never the more Evangelists for that, but only their office was writing or
preaching the Gospel, and thence they had their name.

4. The office of an Evangelist was but temporary, and take it in either of the
two senses of Eusebius or Oecumenius, which are the only true and genuine, was
to expire when Christianity was planted every where, and the office of
Episcopacy, if it was at all was to be succeeded in, and therefore in no
respect could these be inconsistent, at least, not always. * And how S. Paul
should intend that Timothy should keep those rules he gave him, [to the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ,] if the office for the execution of which he gave him
the rules, 1. Tim. 6. 14.
was to expire long before, is not so easily imagined. For if S. Paul did
direct him in a temporary and expiring office, then in no sense, neither in
person, nor in succession could those rules of S. Paul be kept till Christ's
coming, to wit, to judgment. But if he instructed him in the perpetual office
of Episcopacy, then it is easy to understand that S. Paul gave that caution to
Timothy, to intimate that those his directions were not personal, but for his
successors in that charge, to which he had ordained him, viz. in the sacred
order and office of Episcopacy.

5. Lastly, After all this stir, there are some of the Fathers, that will by
no means admit S. Timothy to have been an Evangelist. So S. Chrysostom, so
Theophylact, so the Greek Scholiast, now though we have no need to make any use
of it, yet if it be In Ephesians. 4.
true, it makes all this discourse needless, we were safe enough without it,
if it be false, then it self we see is needless, for the allegation of S.
Timothy's being an Evangelist, is absolutely impertinent, though it had been
true.

But now I proceed.

TItus was also made a Bishop by the Apostles. S. Paul also was his ordainer.
1. Reliqui te 15. S. Titus at Crete,
Cretae. There S. Paul fixed his seat for him, at Crete. 2. His work was (...),
to set in order things that are wanting, viz. to constitute rites and forms of
public Liturgy, to erect a Consistory for cognizance of causes criminal, to
dedicate houses for prayer by public destination for divine Service, and in a
word, by his authority to establish such Discipline and Ritualls, as himself
did judge to be most for edification and ornament of the Church of God. For he
that was appointed by S. Paul, to rectify, and set things in order, was most
certainly by him supposed to be the Judge of all the obliquities which he was
to rectify. 2. The next work is Episcopal too, and it is the ordaining
Presbyters in every City. Not Presbyters collectively in every City, but
distributively, (...), City by City, that is Elders in several Cities, one
in one City, Many in many. For by these Elders are certainly meant Bishops. Of
the identity of Names I shall afterward give an account, but here it is plain
S. Paul expounds himself to mean Bishops.

1. In terms and express words. [To ordain Elders in every City; If any be
the husband of one wife, etc. For a Bishop must be blameless.] That is, the
elders that you are to ordain in several Cities must be blameless, for else
they must not be Bishops. 2. The word (...) cannot hinder this exposition, for
S. Peter calls himself (...), and S. John, Presbyter electae Dominae, and
Presbyter dilectissimo Gajo. Such Presbyters as these were Apostolical, and
that is as much as Episcopal to be sure. 3. S. Paul adds farther [a Bishop
must be blameless As THE STEWARD OF GOD. Who then is that faithful and wise
Steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler?] S. Paul's Bishop is Gods steward,
Titus. 1.
and Gods steward is the ruler of his hous-hold, says our blessed Savior
himself, and therefore not a mere Presbyter, amongst whom indeed there is a
parity, but no superintendency of Gods making. 4. S. Paul does in the sequel
still qualify his Elders or Bishops with more proprieties of rulers. A Bishop
must be no striker, not given to wine. They are exactly the requisites which
our blessed Savior exacts in his Stewards or Rulers accounts. [If the Steward
of the house will drink and be DRUNK, and BEAT his fellow servants, then the
Lord of that servant shall come and divide him his portion with unbelievers.]
The steward of the household, this Ruler, must not be (...), nor (...), no more
must a Bishop, he must not be given to wine, no striker; Neque enim pugilem
describit sermo Apostolicus, sed Pontificem instituit quid facere non debeat,
says S. Hierome: still then, these are the Rulers of the Church, which S.
Titus was to ordain, and Advers: Iovinian.
therefore it is required should Rule well his own house, for how else shall
he take charge of the Church of God, implying that this his charge is to Rule
the house of God. 5. The reason why S. Paul appointed him to ordain these
Bishops in Cities is in order to coercitive jurisdiction, because [many unruly
and vain talkers were crept in, verse. 10.] and they were to be silenced (...).
Their mouths must be stopped. Therefore they must be such Elders as had
superiority of jurisdiction over these impertinent Preachers, which to a single
Presbyter, either by Divine or Apostolical institution no man will grant, and
to a College of Presbyters S. Paul does not intend it, for himself had given
it singly to S. Titus. For I consider,

Titus alone had coercitive jurisdiction before he ordayn'd these Elders, be
they Bishops, be they Presbyters. The Presbyters which were at Crete before his
coming had not Episcopal power, or coercitive jurisdiction, for why then was
Titus sent? As for the Presbyters which Titus ordayn'd, before his ordayning
them, to be sure they had no power at all, they were not Presbyters. If they
had a coercitiv jurisdiction afterward, to wit, by their ordination, then
Titus had it before in his own person, (for they that were there before his
coming had not, as I showed) and therefore he must also have it still, for he
could not loose it by ordaining others, or if he had it not before, how could
he give it unto them whom he ordained? For plus juris in alium transfer nemo
potest, quam ipse habet.

Howsoever it be then, to be sure, Titus had it in his own person and then it
follows Undeniably, that either this coercitive jurisdiction was not necessary
for the Church (which would be either to suppose men impcccable, or the Church
to be exposed to all the inconveniences of Schism and tumutuary factions
without possibility of releife) or if it was necessary, then because it was in
Titus not as a personal prerogative, but a power to be succeeded to; he might
ordain others, he had authority to do it, with the same power he had
himself, and therefore since he alone had this coercion in his own person, so
should his Successors, and then because a single Presbyter, could not have it
over his brethren by the confession of all sides, nor the College of
Presbyters which were there before his coming had it not, for why then was
Titus sent with a new commission, nor those which he was to ordain if they
were but mere Presbyters could not have it, no more then the Presbytes that
were there before his coming, it follows that those Elders which S. Paul sent
Titus to ordain being such as were to be constituted in opposition and power
over the false Doctors and prating Preachers, and with authority to silence
them, (as is evident in the first chapter of that Epistle) these Elders (I say)
are verily, and indeed such as himself call's Bishops in the proper sense, and
acceptance of the word.

6. The Cretan Presbyters who were there before S. Titus coming, had not power
to ordain others, that is, had not that power which Titus had. For Titus was
sent thither for that purpose, therefore to supply the want of that power. And
now, because to ordain others was necessary for the conservation and
succession of the Church, that is, because new generations are necessary for
the continuing the world, and mere Presbyters could not do it, and yet this
must be done, not only by Titus himself, but after him, it follows
undeniably that S. Paul sent Titus to ordain men with the same power that
himself had, that is with more then his first Cretan Presbyters, that is
Bishops, and he means them in the proper sense.

7. That by Elders in several Cities he means Bishops is also plain from the
place where they were to be ordaind, (...), not (...), or (...). In populous
Cities, not in village Towns, For no Bishops were ever suffered to be in
village Towns, as is to be seen in the Council of cap. 6.
Sardis, of can. 17.
Chalcedon, and S. Epist 87. ad Episc. Afric.
Leo, the Cities therefore do at least highly intimate that the persons to be
ordained were not mere Presbyters.

The issue of this discourse is, that since Titus was sent to Crete to ordain
Bishops, himself was a Bishop to be sure, at least. If he had ordained only
Presbyters, it would have proved that. But this inferres him to be a
Metropolitan, forasmuch as he was Bishop of Crete, and yet had many suffragans
in subordination to him, of his own constitution, and yet of proper diocesses.
However, if this discourse concludes nothing peculiar, it frees the place from
popular prejudice and mistakes, upon the confusion of Episcopus, and Presbyter;
and at least inferres his being a Bishop, if not a great deal more.

Yea; but did not S. Titus ordain no mere Presbyters? yes most certainly.
But, so he did Deacons too, and yet neither one nor the other are otherwise
mentioned in this Epistle but by consequence and comprehension within the
superior order. For he that ordaines a Bishop, first makes him a Deacon, (and
then he obtaines (...) a good degree) and then a Presbyter, and then a Bishop.
So that those inferior orders are presupposed in the authorizing the Supreme,
and by giving direction for the qualifications of Bishops, he sufficiently
instructs the inferior orders in their deportment, insomuch as they are
probations for advancement to the higher.

2. Add to this, that he that ordaines Bishops in Cities sets there (...),
ordinem generativum Patrum, as Epiphanius calls Episcopacy, and therefore most
certainly with intention, not that it should be (...) Manus Mortua, but, to
produce others, and therefore Presbyters and Deacons.

3. S. Paul made no express provision for villages, and yet most certainly
did not intend to leave them destitute, and therefore he took order that such
ordinations should be made in Cities which should be provisionary for Villages,
and that is, of such men as had power to ordain and power to send Presbyters
to what part of their charge they pleased. For since Presbyters could not
ordain other Presbyters, as appears by S. Paul's sending Titus to do it
there, where, most certainly, many Presbyters before were actually resident,
if Presbyters had gone to Villages they must have left the Cities destitute, or
if they staid in Cities the Villages would have perished, and atlast, when
these men had dyed both one and the other, had been made a prey to the wolf,
for there could be no shcapheard after the decay of the first generation.

But let us see further into S. Titus his commission and letters of orders, and
institution. [A man Tit. 3. 10.
that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject.] Cognizance
of heretical pravity, and animadversion against the heretic himself is most
plainly concredited to S. Titus. For first he is to admonish him, then to
reject him upon his pertinacy, from the Catholic communion. Cogere autem illos
videtur qui saepe corripit, says S. Ambrose, upon the establishing acoactive,
or coercitive jurisdiction over the Clergy and whole Diocese.

But I need not specify any more particulars, for S. Paul committed to S.
Titus (...), all authority 2. Titus. 15.
and power. The consequence is that which S. Ambrose prefixes to the Comentary
on this Epistle. Titum Apostolus consecravit Episcopum, and ideo commonet eum
ut sit sollicitus in Ecclesiastica ordinatione, id est, ad quosdam qui
simulatione quadam dignos se ostentabant ut sublimem ordinem tenerent, simulque
and haereticos ex circumcisione corripiendos.

And now after so fair preparatory of Scripture we may hear the testimonies
of Antiquity witnessing that Titus was by S. Paul made Bishop of Crete. Sed and
Lucas (says Eusebius) in actibus Apostolorum....Timothei meminit and Titi
quorum alter in Epheso lib. 3. c. 4.
Episcopus: alter ordinandis apud Cretam Ecclesiis ab eo ordinatus praeficitur.
That is it which S. ubi supra.
Ambrose expresses something more plainly, Titum Apostolus consecravit
Episcopum, The Apostle consecrated Titus Bishop; and Theodoret, calling Titus,
Cretensium Episcopum. The Bishop of the Cretians. And in 1. Tim. 3.
for this reason says S. Chrysostom. S. Paul did not write to Sylvanus, or
Silas, or Clemens, but to Timothy and Titus (...), because to these he had
already committed the government of Churches. But a fuller testimony of S.
Titus being a Bishop who please may see in S. de Script: Eccl. in Tito.
Hierome, in in Sinopsi.
Dorotheus, in de vita and morte. SSanct.
Isidore, in lib. 38. c. 10.
Vincentius, in apud Oecumen in praefat. in Tit. and in. 1 Timoth. 3.
Theodoret, in in pastor. part. 2. c. 11.
S. Gregory, in praefat: in 1. Tim. and in 2. Tim. 1.
Primatius, in 1. Tim. 1. and in 2. Tim. 1. 6.
Sedulius, in 1. Tit.
Theophilact and lib. 2. c. 34.
Nicephorus. To which if we add the subscription of the Epistle asserted from
all impertinent objections by the clearer testimony of S. In Synop si Sacr.
Script.
Athanasius, S ad Paulam and Eustoch.
Jerome, the Syriack translation, Comment. ad Titum.
Oecumenius and ibid:
Theophylact, no confident denial can ever break through, or escape conviction.

And now I know not what objection can fairly be made here; for I hope S.
Titus was no Evangelist, he is not called so in Scripture, and all Antiquity
calls him a Bishop, and the nature of his offices, the eminence of his dignity,
the superiority of jurisdiction, the cognizance of causes criminal, and the
whole exigence of the Epistle proclaim him Bishop. But suppose a while Titus
had been an Evangelist, I would feign know who succeeded him? Or did all his
office expire with his person? If so, then who shall reject Heretics when
Titus is dead? Who shall silence factious Preachers? If not, then still who
succeeded him? The Presbyters: How can that be? For if they had more power
after his death then before, and governed the Churches which before they did
not, then to be sure their government in common, is not an Apostolical
Ordinance, much less is it a Divine right, for it is postnate to the^ both.
But if they had no more power after Titus then they had under him, how then
could they succeed him? There was indeed a dereliction of the authority, but no
succession. The succession therefore both in the Metropolis of Crete, and also
in the other Cities was made by singular persons, not by a College, for so we
find in the (...) recorded by Eusebius that in Gnossus of Crete, Pinytus was a
most eminent Bishop, and that Philip was the Metropolitan at Gortyna. Sed and
Pinytus nobilissimus apud Cretam in Episcopis fuit, says Eusebius. But of
this, lib. 4. c. 21.
enough.

MY next instance shall be of one that was an Evangelist. 16. S. Mark at
Alexandria,
indeed, one that writ the Gospel, and he was a Bishop of Alexandria. In
Scripture we find nothing of him but that he was an Evangelist, and a Deacon,
for he was Deacon to S. Paul and Barnabas, when they went to the Gentiles, by
ordinanation and special designement made at Antioch; (...), Acts. 12. and
Acts. 13.
They had John to be their Minister; viz: John whose surname was Mark. * But
we are not to expect all the ordinations made by the Apostles in their acts
written by S. Luke, which end at S. Paul's first going to Rome; but many other
things, their founding of diverse Churches, their ordination of Bishops, their
journeyes, their persecutions, their Miracles and Martyrdomes are recorded, and
rely upon the faith of the primitive Church. And yet the ordination of S. Mark
was within the term of S. Lukes story, for his successor Anianus was made
Bishop of Alexandria in the eight year of Nero's reign, five or six years
before the death of S. Paul. Igitur Neronis PRIMO Imperij anno post Marcum
Evangelistam Ecclesiae apud Alexandriam Anianus Sacerdotium suscepit. So the
Latin of Ruffinus reads it, in stead of octavo. Sacerdotium, (...), that is the
Bishopric, for else there were many (...), and Priests in Alexandria besides
him, and how then he should be S. Marks successor more then the other
Presbyters, is not so soon to be contrived. But so the Collecta of the Chapter
runs. Quod post Marcum primus Episcopus Alexandrinae Ecclesiae ordinatus sit
Anianus, Anianus was consecrated the first Bishop of Alexandria after S. Mark.
* And Philo the lew telling the story of the Christians in Alexandria, called
by the inhabitants, Cultores, and Cultrices, The worshippers, Addit autem adhuc
his (says Eusebius) quomodo sacerdotes vel Ministri exhibeant officia sua, vel
quae sit supra lib. 2 hist. cap. 17.
omnia Episcopalis apicis seeds, intimating that beside the offices of Priests
and Ministers, there was an Episcopal dignity which was apex super omnia, a
height above all employments, established at Alexandria; and how soon that
was, is soon computed, for Philo lived in our blessed Saviors time, and was
Ambassador to the Emperor Cajus, and survived S. Mark a little.

But S. Jerome will strike up this business, A Marco Epist. ad Evagr.
Evangelista ad Heraclam usque, and Dionysium Episcopos, Presbyteri Egypti
semper unum ex se electum in celsiori gradu collocatum Episcopum nominabant.
And again, Marcus interpres Apostoli Petri, and Alexandrinae Ecclesiae primus
Episcopus. The same is de Script: Eccles. and in proem in Matthew.
witnessed by lib. 6. Epist. 371.
S. Gregory, lib 14. cap 39.
Nicephorus, and diverse others.

Now although the ordination of S. Mark is not specified in the Acts, as
innumerable multitudes of things more, and scarce any thing at all of any of
the twelve but S. Peter, nothing of S. James the son of Thaddaeus, nor of
Alpheus, but the Martyrdom of one of them, nothing of S. Bartholomew, of S.
Thomas, of Simon zelotes, of S. Jude the Apostle, scarce any of their names
recorded, yet no wise man can distrust the faith of such records, which all
Christendom hitherto, so far as we know, has acknowledged as authentic,
and these ordinations cannot possibly go less then Apostolical, being done
in the Apostles times, to whom the care of all the Churches was concredited,
they seeing and beholding several successions in several Churches before
their death, as here at Alexandria, first Saint Mark, then Anianus, made
Bishop five or six years before the death of S. Peter and S. Paul. But yet who
it was that ordained S. Mark Bishop of Alexandria (for Bishop he was most
certainly) is not obscurely intimated by the most excellent man S. Gelasius in
the Roman Council, Marcus a Petro Apostolo in Aegyptum directus verbum
veritatis praedicavit, In decret. de lib. authent. and apocryph.
and gloriose consummavit Martyrium. S. Peter sent him into Egypt to found a
Church, and therefore would furnish him with all things requisite for so great
employment, and that could be no less, then the ordinary power Apostolical.

BUt in the Church of Rome, the ordination of 17. S. Linus, and s. Clement at
Rome.
Bishops by the Apostles, and their successions during the times of the
Apostles, is very manifest by a concurrent testimony of old writers. Fundantes
igitur, and instruentes beati Apostoli Ecclesiam Lino Episcopatum
administrandae Ecclesiae tradiderunt. Hujus Lini Paulus in his quae sunt ad
Timotheum Epistolis meminit. Succedit autem ei Anacletus, post eum tertio loco
ab Apostolis Episcopatum sortitur Clemens, qui and vidit ipsos Apostolos, and
con^ulit cum eis, cum adhuc insonantem praedicationem Apostolorum, and
traditionem ante oculos haberet. So S. Irenaeus. lib. 3. cap. 3.
Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 4.
Memoratur autem ex comitibus Pauli Crescens quidam ad Gallias esse praefectus.
Linus vero and Clemens in urbe Roma Ecclesiae praefuisse. Many more testimonies
there are of these men's being ordained Bishops of Rome by the Apostles, as of
de praescript.
Tertullian, lib, 2. contr. Parmen.
Optatus, Epist. 165.
S. Austin, and de Script. Eccles.
S. Hierome. But I will not cloy my Reader with variety of one dish, and be
tedious in a thing so evident and known.

S. John ordained S. Polycarpe Bishop at Smyrna.... sicut Smyrnaeorum Ecclesia

ab Iohanne conlocatum refert; sicut Romanorum Clementem a Petro ordinatum
edit, proinde utique and caeterae exhibent quos ab Apostolis in Episcopatum
constitutos Apostolici scminis traduces habeant. So Tertullian. The Church of
Smyrna says that Polycarpe De praescript.
was placed there by S. John, as the Church of Rome says that Clement was
ordained there by S. Peter, and other Churches have those whom the Apostles
made to be their Bishops. Polycarpus autem De Script. Eccles. lib. 3. c. 35.

est Smyrnis Ecclesia constitutus Episcopus.... and testimonium his perhibent
quae sunt in Asia Ecclesiae omnes, and qui usque adhuc successerunt Polycarpo
etc. The same also is witnessed by S. Jerome, and In Martyrologio Roman:
Eusebius: Quoniam autem valde longum est in tali volumine omnium Ecclesiarum
successiones enumerare, to use S. Irenaeus his expression; It were an infinite
labor to reckon up all those whom the Apostles made Bishops with their own
hands, as Eusebius. l. 4. c. 23. and lib. 3. c. 4.

Epaphroditus at Philippi, Eusebius. l. 3. c. 4. apud Galtias. So Ruffinus reads
it. In Galatia, so is intimated in Scripture, and so the Roman Martyrol.
Crescens among the Gauls, Ignatius Epist. ad Antioch. and Eusebius. lib 3. c. 22.
Evodias at Antioch, In Martyrologio Roman:
Sosipater at Iconium, Erastus in Macedonia, Trophimus at Arles, Jason at
Tarsus, Silas at Corinth, Onesiphorus at Colophon, Quartus at Berytus, Paul the
Proconsul at Narbona, besides many more whose names are not recorded in
Scripture, as these forecited are, so many as lib. 3. cap. 37.
Eusebius counts impossible to enumerate; it shall therefore suffice to sum
up this digest of their acts and ordinations in those general foldings used by
the Fathers, saying that the Apostles did ordain Bishops in all Churches, that
the succession of Bishops down from the Apostles first ordination of them was
the only argument to prove their Churches Catholic, and their adversaries who
could not do so, to be Heretical; This also is very evident, and of great
consideration in the first ages while their tradition was clear, and evident,
and not so be pudled as it since has been with the mixture of Heretics,
striving to spoil that which did so much mischief to their causes.

Edant origines Ecclesiarum suarum, evolvant ordinem Episcoporum suorum it a
per successiones ab initio decurrentem, ut primus ille Episcopus aliquemex
Apostolis, aut Apostolicis viris habuerit authorem and antecessorem, hoc modo
Ecclesiae Apostolicae census suos deferunt, etc. And when S. Irenaeus had
reckoned Lib. 3. cap. 3.
twelve successions in the Church of Rome from the Apostles, nunc duodecimo
loco ab Apostolis Episcopatum habet Eleutherius. Hac ordinatione (says he) and
successione, and ea quae est ab Apostolis in Ecclesia traditio and veritat is
praeconiatio pervenit usque ad nos; and est plenissima haec ostensio unam and
eandem vivatricem fidem esse quae in Ecclesia ab Apostolis usque nunc sit
conservata, and tradita in veritate. So that this succession of Bishops from
the Apostles ordination, must of it self be a very certain thing, when the
Church made it a maine probation of their faith; for the books of Scripture
were not all gathered together, and generally received as yet. Now then, since
this was a main pillar of their Christianity, viz. a constant reception of it
from hand to hand, as being delivered by the Bishops in every chair, till we
come to the very Apostles that did ordain them, this (I say) being their proof,
although it could not be more certain then the thing to be proved, which in
that case was a Divine revelation, yet to them it was more evident as being
matter of fact, and known almost by evidence of sense, and as verily believed
by all, as it was by any one, that himself was baptized, both relying upon the
report of others. * Radix Christianae societatis Epist. 42.
per seeds Apostolorum, and successiones Episcoporum, certa per orbem
propagatione diffunditur, says S. Austin. The very root and foundation of
Christian communion is spread all over the world, by the successions of
Apostles and Bishops.

And is it not now a madness to say there was no such thing, no succession of
Bishops in the Churches Apostolical, no ordination of Bishops by the Apostles,
and so (as S. Paul's phrase is) overthrow the faith of some, even of the
Primitive Christians, that used this argument as a great weapon of offense
against the invasion of haereticks and factious people? It is enough for us
that we can truly say with S. Irenaeus, Habemus annumerare eos qui ab Apostolis
Ubi supra
postolis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis usque ad nos. We can reckon
those who from the Apostles until now were made Bishops in the Churches; and
of this we are sure enough, if there be any faith in Christians.

THe sum is this. Although we had not prooved 19. So that Episcopacy is at
least an Apostolical ordinance: of the same authority with many other points
generally believed.
the immediate Divine institution of Episcopal power over Presbyters and the
whole flock, yet Episcopacy is not less then an Apostolical ordinance, and
delivered to us by the same authority that the observation of the Lord's day
is. For, for that in the new Testament we have no precept, and nothing but the
example of the Primitive Disciples meeting in their Synaxes upon that day, and
so also they did on the saturday in the Jewish Synagogues, but yet (however
that at Geneva, they were once in meditation to have changed it into a Thursday
meeting to have shown their Christian liberty) we should think strangely of
those men that called the Sunday-Festivall less then an Apostolical
ordinance, and necessary now to be kept holy with such observances as the
Church has appointed.

* Baptism of infants is most certainly a holy and charitable ordinance, and
of ordinary necessity to all that ever cried, and yet the Church has founded
this rite upon the tradition of the Apostles; and wise men do easily observe
that the Anabaptists can by the same probability of Scripture enforce a
necessity of communicating infants upon us, as we do of baptizing infants upon
them, if we speak of immediate Divine institution, or of practice Apostolical
recorded in Scripture, and therefore a great Master of Geneva in a book he writ
against the Anabaptists, was forced to fly to Apostolicail traditive
ordination, and therefore the institution of Bishops, must be served first, as
having fairer plea, and clearer evidence in Scripture, then the baptizing of
infants, and yet they that deny this, are by the just anathema of the Catholic
Church, confidently condemned for Heretics.

* Of the same consideration are diverse other things in Christianity, as the
Presbyters consecrating the Eucharist; for if the Apostles in the first
institution did represent the whole Church, Clergy and Laity, when Christ said
[Hoc facite, Do this] then why may not every Christian man there represented,
do that which the Apostles in the name of all were commanded to do? If the
Apostles did not represent the whole Church, why then do all communicate? Or
what place, or intimation of Christ's saying is there in all the four
Gospells, limiting [Hoc facite, id est, benedicite] to the Clergy, and
extending [Hoc facite, id est, accipite and manducate] to the Laity? This also
rests upon the practice Apostolical and traditive interpretation of H. Church,
and yet cannot be denied that so it ought to be, by any man that would not have
his Christendom suspected.

* To these I add the communion of Women, the distinction of books
Apocryphal, from Canonical, that such books were written by such Evangelists,
and Apostles, the whole tradition of Scripture it self, the Apostles Creed,
the feast of Easter (which amongst all them that cry up the Sunday-Festivall
for a Divine institution, must needs prevail as Caput institutionis, it being
that for which the Sunday is commemorated.) These and diverse others of greater
consequence (which I dare not specify for fear of being misunderstood) rely
but upon equal faith with this of Episcopacy (though I should wave all the
arguments for immediate Divine ordinance) and therefore it is but reasonable it
should be ranked amongst the Credenda of Christianity, which the Church has
entertained upon the confidence of that which we call the faith of a Christian,
whose Master is truth it self.

What their power and eminence was, and 20. And was an office of power and
great authority,
the appropriates of their office so ordained by the Apostles, appears also by
the testimonies before alleged, the expressions whereof run in these high
terms. Episcopatus administrandae Ecclesiae in Lino. Linus his Bishopric was
the administration of the whole Church. Ecclesiae praefuisse was said of him
and Clemens, they were both Prefects of the Church, or Prelates, that is the
Churchword. Ordinandis apud Cretam Ecclesiis praeficitur, so Titus, he is set
over all the affairs of the newfounded Churches in Crete. In celsiori gradu
collocatus, placed in a higher order or degree, so the Bishop of Alexandria,
chosen ex Presbyteris, from amongst the Presbyters. Supra omnia Episcopalis
apicis seeds, so Philo of that Bishopric, The seat of Episcopal height above
all things in Christianity. These are its honors. Its offices these. (...)
etc. To set in order whatsoever he sees wanting, or amiss; to silence vain
prating Preachers, that will not submit to their superiors, to ordain elders,
to rebuke delinquents, to reject Heretics, viz. from the communion of the
faithful (for else why was the Angel of the Church of Pergamus reproved for
tolerating the Nicolaitan heretics, but that it was in his power to eject
them? And the same is the case of the Angel of Thyatir a in permitting the
woman to teach and seduce the people) but to the Bishop was committed the
cognizance of causes criminal and particular of Presbyters, (so to Timothy in
the instance formerly alleged) nay, (...), all authority, so in the case of
Titus, and officium regendae Ecclesiae, the office of ruling the Church, so to
them all whom the Apostles left in the several Churches respectively which
they had new founded. So Eusebius. Vbi supra. apud Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 23.
For the Bishop was (...), set over all, Clergy and Laity, says S. Clement.

This was given to Bishops by the Apostles themselves, and this was not given
to Presbyters, as I have already prooved, and for the present, it will
sufficiently appear in this, that Bishops had power over Presbyters, which
cannot be supposed they had over themselves, unless they could be their own
superiors.

BUt a Council, or College of Presbyters. 21. Not lessened by the assistance
and Council of Presbyters,
might have jurisdiction over any one, and such Colleges there were in the
Apostles times, and they did in communi Ecclesiam regere, govern the Church in
common with the Bishop, as says S. Hierom, viz. where there was a Bishop, and
where there was none they ruled without him. * This indeed will call us to a
new account, and it relies upon the testimony of S. Hierome which I will set
down here, that we may leave the sun without a cloud. S. Ierom's words are
these. Comment. in ep. ad Titum.


Idem est enim Presbyter quod Episcopus, and antequam Diaboli instinctu studia
in religione fierent, and diceretur in populis, ego sum Pauli ego Apollo, ego
autem Cephae, communi Presbyterorum consitio Ecclesiae gubernabantur. Postquam
vero unusquisque eos quos baptizabat suos put abat esse, non Christi, in toto
or be decretum est, ut unus de Presbyter is electus superponeretur caeteris ut
Schismatum semina tollerentur.

Then he brings some arguments to confirm his saying, and sums them up thus.

Haec diximus ut ostenderemus apud veteres eosdem fuisse Presbyteros quos
Episcopos, and ut Episcopi noverint se magis consuetudine quam Dominicae
dispositionis veritate Presbyteris esse majores: and in communi debere
Ecclesiam regere, etc.

The thing S. Hierome aims to prove, is the identity of Bishop, Presbyter, and
their government of the Church in common. * For their identity, It is clear
that S. Hierome does not mean it in respect of order, as if a Bishop and a
Presbyter had both one office per omnia, one power; for else he contradicts
himself most apertly, for in his Epistle ad Evagrium, Quid facit (says he)
Episcopus excepta ordinatione quod Presbyter non faciat? A Presbyter may not
ordain, a Bishop does, which is a clear difference of power, and by S.
Hierome is not expressed in matter of fact, but of right [quod Presbyter non
FACIAT] not [non facit;] that a Priest may not, must not do, that a Bishop
does, viz. he gives holy orders. * And for matter of fact S. Hierome knew that
in his time a Presbyter did not govern in common, but because he conceived it
was fit he should be joined in the common regiment and care of the Diocese,
therefore he asserted it as much as he could; And therefore if S. Hierome had
thought that this difference of the power of ordination, had been only
customary, and by actual indulgence, or incroachment, or positive
constitution, and no matter of primitive and original right, S. Hierome was
not so diffident but out it should, come what would have come. And suppose S.
Hierome, in this distinct power of ordination had intended it only to be a
difference in fact, not in right (for so some of late have muttered) then S.
Hierome had not said true according to his own principles, for [Quid facit
Episcopus excepta ordinatione quod Presbyter non faciat?] had been quickly
answered, if the Question had only been de facto; For the Bishop governed the
Church alone, and so in Jurisdiction was greater then Presbyters, and this was
by custom, and in fact at least, S. Hierome says it, and the Bishop took so
much power to himself, that de facto Presbyters were not suffered to do any
thing sine literis Episco* palibus, without leave of the Bishop, and this S.
Hierome complained of; so that de facto the power of Ad Nepotian. and de 7.
ordin. Eccles.
ordination was not the only difference: That then (if S. Hierome says true)
being the only difference between Presbyter and Bishop, must be meant de
jure, in matter of right, not humane positive, for that is coincident with the
other power of jurisdiction which de facto, and at least by a humane right the
Bishop had over Presbyters, but Divine, and then this identity of Bishop and
Presbyter by S. Hierom's own confession cannot be meant in respect of order,
but that Episcopacy is by Divine right a superior order to the Presbyterate.

* Add to this that the arguments which S. Hierome uses in this discourse are
to prove that Bishops are sometimes called Presbyters. To this purpose he urges
Act. 20. And Philippians 1. and the Epistles to Timothy, and Titus, and some
others, but all driving to the same issue. To what? Not to prove that
Presbyters are sometimes called Presbyters; For who doubts that? But that
Bishops are so may be of some consideration and needs a proof, and this he
Undertook. Now that they are so called must needs infer an identity and a
disparity in several respects. An identity, at least of Names, for else it had
been wholly impertinent. A disparity, or else his arguments were to prove idem
affirmari de eodem, which were a business next to telling pins. Now then this
disparity must be either in order, or jurisdiction. By the former probation it
is sure that he means the orders to be disparate; If jurisdiction too, I am
content, but the former is most certain, if he stand to his own principles.

This identity then which S. Hierome expresses of Episcopus and Presbyter, must
be either in Name or in jurisdiction. I know not certainly which he means,
for his arguments conclude only for the identity of Names, but his conclusion
is for identity of jurisdiction, and in communi debere Ecclesiam regere, is the
intent of his discourse. If he means the first, viz: that of Names, it is well
enough, there is no harm done, it is in confesso apud omnes, but concludes
nothing (as I shall show hereafter) but because he intends (so far as may be
guessed by his words) a parity and concurrence of jurisdiction, this must be
considered distinctly.

1. Then; in the first founding of Churches the Apostles did appoint
Presbyters, and inferior Ministers with a power of baptizing, preaching,
consecrating and reconciling in privato foro, but did not in every Church at
the first founding it, constitute a Bishop. This is evident in Crete, in
Ephesus, in Corinth, at Rome, at Antioch.

2. Where no Bishops were constituted there the Apostles kept the jurisdiction
in their own hands [There comes upon me (says S. Paul) daily the care or
Supravision of all the Churches] Not all absolutely, for not all of the
Circumcision, but all of his charge, with which he was once charged, and of
which he had not exonerated himself by constituting Bishops there, for of
these there is the same reason. And again [If any man obey not our word,
(...), 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14.
signify him to me by an Epistle] so he charges the Thessalonians, and
therefore of this Church, S. Paul as yet, clearly kept the power in his own
hands. So that the Church was ever in all the parts of it, governed by
Episcopal, or Apostolical authority.

3. For ought appears in Scripture, the Apostles never gave any external, or
coercitive jurisdiction in public, and criminal causes, nor yet power to
ordain Rites or Ceremonies, or to inflict censures, to a College of mere
Presbyters. * The contrary may be greedily swallowed, and I know not with how
great confidence, and prescribing prejudice; but there is not in all Scripture
any commission from Christ, any ordinance or warrant from the Apostles to any
Presbyter, or College of Presbyters without a Bishop, or express delegation
of Apostolical authority (tanquam vicario suo, as to his substitute in absense
of the Bishop or Apostle) to inflict any censures, or take cognizance of
persons and causes criminal. Presbyters might be surrogati in locum Episcopi
absentis, but never had any ordinary jurisdiction given them by virtue of their
ordination, or any commission, from Christ or his Apostles.

This we may best consider by induction of particulars.

1. There was a Presbytery at Jerusalem, but they had a Bishop always, and the
College of the Apostles sometimes, therefore whatsoever act they did, it was
in conjunction with, and subordination to the Bishop and Apostles. Now it
cannot be denied both that the Apostles were superior to all the Presbyters in
Jerusalem, and also had power alone to govern the Church. I say they had power
to govern alone, for they had the government of the Church alone before they
ordayn'd the first Presbyters, that is before there were any of capacity to
join with them, they must do it themselves, and then also they must retain
the same power, for they could not loose it by giving Orders. Now if they had a
power of sole jurisdiction, then the Presbyters being in some public acts in
conjunction with the Apostles cannot challenge a right of governing as affixed
to their Order, they only assisting in subordination, and by dependency.

This only by the way; In Jerusalem the Presbyters were some thing more then
ordinary, and were not mere Presbyters in the present, and limited sense of
the word. For Barnabas, and Judas, and Silas [(...) S. Luke calls them] were of
that Presbytery. (...). They were Rulers, and Prophets, Chief men amongst the
Act. 15.
Brethren, and yet called Elders, or Presbyters though of Apostolical power
and authority, (...) says Oecumenius. For truth is, in Act. Apost.
that diverse of them were ordained Apostles with an Unlimited jurisdiction,
not fixed upon any See, that they also might together with the twelve, exire in
totum mundum. * So that in this Presbytery either they were more then mere
Presbyters, as Barnabas, and Judas, and Silas, men of Apostolical power, and
they might well be in conjunction with the twelve, and with the Bishop, they
were of equal power, not by virtue of their Presbyterate, but by their
Apostolate; or if they were but mere Presbyters, yet because it is certain,
and proov'd, and confessed that the Apostles had power to govern the Church
alone, this their taking mere Presbyters in partem regiminis, was a voluntary
act, and from this example was derived to other Churches, and then it is most
true, that Presbyteros in communi Ecclesiam regere, was rather, consuetudine
Ecclesiae, then dominicae dispositionis veritate, (to use S. Hierom's own
expression) for this is more evident then that Bishops, do eminere caeteris,
by custom rather then Divine institution. For if the Apostles might rule the
Church alone, then that the Presbyters were taken into the Number was a
voluntary act of the Apostles, and although fitting to be retained where the
same reasons do remain, and circumstances concur, yet not necessary because
not affixed to their Order; not, Dominicae dispositionis veritate, and not
laudable when those reasons cease, and there is an emergency of contrary causes.

2. The next Presbytery we read of is at Antioch, but there we find no acts
either of concurrent, or single jurisdiction, but of ordination indeed we do,
Act. 13.
and that performed by such men as S. Paul was, and Barnabas, for they were two
of the Prophets reckoned in the Church of Antioch, but I do not remember them
to be called Presbyters in that place, to be sure they were not mere
Presbyters as we now Understand the word; as I proved formerly.

3. But in the Church of Ephesus there was a College of Presbyters and they
were by the Spirit Act. 20.
of God called Bishops, and were appointed by him to be Pastors of the Church
of God. This must do it or nothing. In quo spiritus S. posuit vos Episcopos,
In whom the holy Ghost has made you Bishops. There must lay the exigence of
the argument, and if we can find who is meant by [Vos] we shall, I hope, gain
the truth. * S. Paul sent for the Presbyters, or Elders to come from Ephesus to
Miletus, and to them he spoke. * * It Is true, but that is not all the [vos], For
there were present at that Sermon, Sopater, and Aristarchus, and Secundus, and
Gaius, and Timothy, and Tychicus, and Trophimus; Act. 20. 4.
And although he sent to Ephesus as to the Metropolis, and there many Elders
were either accidentally, or by ordinary residence, yet those were not all
Elders of that Church, but of all Asia, in the Scripture sense, the lessar
Asia. For so in the preface of his Sermon S. Paul intimates [ye know that from
the first day I came into Asia after what manner I have verse. 18.
been with you at all seasons] His whole conversation in Asia was not confined
to Ephesus, and yet those Elders who were present were witnesses of it all, and
therefore were of dispersed habitation, and so it is more clearly inferred from
verse. 25. And now behold I know that YE ALL AMONG WHOM I HAVE GONE preaching
the Kingdom of God etc: It was a travail to preach to all that were present,
and therefore most certainly they were inhabitants of places very considerably
distant.

Now upon this ground I will raise these considerations.

1. If there be a confusion of Names in Scripture, particularly of Episcopus
and Presbyter, as it is contended for, on one side, and granted on all sides,
then where both the words are used, what shall determine the signification? For
whether (to instance in this place) shall Presbyter limit Episcopus, or
Episcopus extend Presbyter? Why may not Presbyter signify one that is verily a
Bishop, as Episcopus signify a mere Presbyter? For it is but an ignorant
conceit, where ever Presbyter is named, to fancy it in the proper and limited
sense, and not to do so with Episcopus, and when they are joined together,
rather to believe it in the limited and present sense of Presbyter, then in the
proper and present sense of Episcopus. So that as yet we are indifferent upon
the terms. These men sent for from Ephesus, are called (...), Elders or
Presbyters of the Church, but at Miletus, Spiritus S. posuit vos Episcopos,
there they are called Bishops or overseers. So that I may as well say here were
properly so called Bishops, as another may say, here were mere Presbyters. *
And least it be objected in prejudice of my affirmative, that they could not be
Bishops, because they were of Ephesus, there never being but one Bishop in one
Church. I answer, that in the Apostles times this was not true. For at
Jerusalem there were many at the same time that had Episcopal, and
Apostolical authority, and so at Antioch; as at Jerusalem, where James, and
Judas, and Silas, and the Apostles, and Paul and Barnabas at Antioch, and at
Rome, at the same time Peter and Paul, and Linus, and Clemens, but yet but one
of them was fixed, and properly the Bishop of that place. But 2ly All these were
not of Ephesus, but the Elders of all Asia, but some from other countries as
appears verse. 4. So that although they were all Bishops, we might easily find
distinct Diocesses for them, without incumbring the Church of Ephesus with a
multiplied incumbency. Thus far then we are upon even terms, the community
of compellations used here, can no more force us to believe them all to be
mere Presbyters, then Bishops in the proper sense.

2. It is very certain that they were not all mere Presbyters at his farewell
Sermon, for S. Timothy was there, and I proved him to be a Bishop by abundant
testimony, and many of those which are reckoned v. 4. were companions of the
Apostle in his journey, and employed in mission Apostolical for the founding
of Churches, and particularly, Sosipater was there, and he was Bishop of
Iconium, and Tychicus of Chalcedon in Bythinia, as Dorotheus and Eusebius
witness; and Trophimus of Arles in France, Vbi supra.
for so is witnessed by the suffragans of that province in their Epistle to S.
Leo. But without all doubt here were Bishops present as well as Presbyters, for
besides the premises we have a witness beyond exception, the ancient S.
Irenaeus, In Mileto enim convocatis Episcopis, and Presbyteris qui erant eb
Lib. 3. cap. 14.
Epheso, and a reliquis proximis civitatibus, quoniam ipse festinavit
Hierosolymis Pentecosten agere, etc. S. Paul making have to keep his Pentecost
at Jerusalem, at Miletus, did call together the Bishops and Presbyters, from
Ephesus, and the neighboring Cities. * Now to all these in conjunction S.
Paul spoke, and to these indeed the Holy Ghost had concredited his Church to be
fed, and taught with Pastoral supravision, but in the mean while here is no
commission of power, or jurisdiction to Presbyters distinctly, nor supposition
of any such praeexistent power,

3. All that S. Paul said in this narration, was spoken in the presence of them
all, but not to them all. For that of v. 18. [ye know how I have been with you
in Asia in all seasons,] that indeed was spoke to all the Presbyters that came
from Ephesus and the voisinage, viz. in a collective sense, not in a
distributive, for each of them was not in all the circuit of his Asian
travailes; but this was not spoken to Sopater the Beraean, or to Aristarchus
the Thessalonian, but to Tychicus, and Trophimus, who were Asians it might be
addressed. And for that of v. 25. [yee all among whom I have gone preaching
shall see my face no more,] this was directed only to the Asians, for he was
never more to come thither; but Timothy to be sure, saw him afterward, for S.
Paul sent for him, a little before his death, to Rome, and it will not be
supposed he neglected to attend him. So that if there were a conjunction of
Bishops, and Presbyters at this meeting, as most certainly there was, and of
Evangelists, and Apostolical men besides, how shall it be known, or indeed
with any probability suspected that, that clause of verse. 28. Spiritus S.
posuit vos Episcopos pascere Ecclesiam Dei, does belong to the Ephesine
Presbyters, and not particularly to Timothy, who was now actually Bishop of
Ephesus, and to Gajus, and to the other Apostolical men who had at least
Episcopal authority, that is, power of founding, and ordering Churches without
a fixed and limited jurisdiction?

4. Either in this place is no jurisdiction at all intimated de antiquo, or
concredited de novo, or if there be, it is in the word (...), and (...) v. 28.
Bishops, and Feeders; and then it belongs either to the Bishops alone, or to
the Presbyters in conjunction with, and subordination to the Bishops, for to
the mere Presbyters it cannot be proved to appertain, by any intination of
that place.

5. How and if these Presbyters, which came from Ephesus and the other parts of
Asia were made Bishops at Miletus? Then also this way all difficulty will be
removed. And that so it was is more then probable; for to be sure, Timothy was
now entering, and fixing upon his See; and it was consonant to the practice of
the Apostles, and the exigence of the thing it self, when they were to leave a
Church to fix a Bishop in it; for why else was a Bishop fixed in Jerusalem, so
long before in other Churches, but because the Apostles were to be scattered
from thence, and there the first bloody field of Martyrdom was to be fought.
And the case was equal here, for S. Paul was never to see the Churches of Asia
any more, and he foresaw that ravening wolves would enter into the folds, and
he had actually placed a Bishop in Ephesus, and it is unimaginable, that he
would not make equal provision for other Churches, there being the same
necessity from the same danger, in them all, and either S. Paul did it now, or
never; and that about this time the other six Asian Churches had Angels, or
Bishops set in their candlesticks, is plain, for there had been a succession in
the Church of Pergamus, Antipas was dead, and S. Timothy had sat in Ephesus,
and S. Polycarpe at Smyrna many years before S. John writ his Revelation.

6. Lastly, that no jurisdiction was in the Ephesine Presbyters, except a
delegate, and subordinate, appears beyond all exception, by S. Paul's first
epistle to Timothy, establishing in the person of Timothy power of coercitive
jurisdiction over Presbyters, and ordination in him alone, without the
conjunction of any in commission with him, for ought appears either there, or
elsewhere.

* 4. The same also in the case of the Cretan Presbyters is clear. For what
power had they of Jurisdiction? For that is it, we now speak of. If they had
none before S. Titus came, we are well enough at Crete. If they had, why did S.
Paul take it from them to invest Titus with it? Or if he did not, to what
purpose did he send Titus with all those powers before mentioned? For either
the Presbyters of Crete had jurisdiction in causes criminal equal to Titus
after his coming, or they had not. If they had, then what did Titus do there?
If they had not, then either they had no jurisdiction at all, or whatsoever it
was, it was in subordination to him, they were his inferiors, and he their
ordinary Judge and Governor.

5. One thing more before this be left, must be considered concerning the
Church of Corinth, for there was power of excommunication in the Presbytery
when they had no Bishop, for they had none of diverse years after the founding
of the Church, and yet S. Paul reprooves them for not ejecting the incestuous
person out of the Church.

* This is it that I said before, that the Apostles kept the jurisdiction in
their hands where they had founded a Church, and placed no Bishop. For in this
case of the Corinthian incest the Apostle did make himself the sole Judge.
[For I verily as 1. Cor. 5. 3.
absent in body but present in spirit have judged already] and then secondly,
S. Paul gives the Church V. 4.
of Corinth commission and substitution to proceed in this cause [In the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and MY SPIRIT, that
is, My power, My authority, for so he explaines himself, MY SPIRIT, WITH THE
POWER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, to deliver him over to Satan. And 3. As all
this power is delegate, so it is but declarative in the Corinthians, for S.
Paul had given sentence before, and they of Corinth were to publish it. 4. This
was a commission given to the whole assembly, and no more concerns the
Presbyters, then the people, and so some have contended; but so it is, but will
serve neither of their turns, neither for an independent Presbytery, nor a
conjunctive popularity. As for S. Paul's reprooving them for not inflicting
censures on the peccant, I have often heard it confidently averred, but never
could see ground for it. The suspicion of it is v. 2. [And ye are puffed up,
and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be TAKEN
AWAY FROM AMONG YOU] Taken away. But by whom? That Is the Question. Not by them,
to be sure. For TAKEN AWAY FROM You, implies that it is by the power of
another, not by their act, for no man can take away any thing from himself. He
may put it away, not take it, the expression had been very imperfect if this
had been his meaning. * Well then: In all these instances, viz. of Jerusalem,
Antioch, Ephesus, Crete, and Corinth (and these are all I can find in Scripture
of any consideration in the present Question) all the jurisdiction was
originally in the Apostles while there was no Bishop, or in the Bishop when
there was any; And yet that the Presbyters were joined in the ordering Church
affairs I will not deny, to wit, by voluntary assuming them, in partem
sollicitudinis, and by delegation of power Apostolical, or Episcopal, and by
way of assistance in acts deliberative, and consiliary, though I find this no
where specified but in the Church of Jerusalem, where I prooved that the Elders
were men of more power then mere Presbyters, men of Apostolical authority.
But here lies the issue, and strain of the Question.

Presbyters had no jurisdiction in causes criminal, and pertaining to the
public regiment of the Church, by virtue of their order, or without particular
substitution, and delegation. For there is not in all Scripture any commission
given by Christ to mere Presbyters, no divine institution of any power of
regiment in the Presbytery; no constitution Apostolical, that mere Presbyters
should either alone, or in conjunction with the Bishop govern the Church; no
example in all Scripture of any censure inflicted by any mere Presbyters,
either upon Clergy or Laity; no specification of any power that they had so to
do; but to Churches where Colleges of Presbyters were resident, Bishops were
sent by Apostolical ordination; not only with power of imposition of hands,
but of excommunication, of taking cognizance even of causes, and actions of
Presbyters themselves, as to Titus, and Timothy, the Angel of the Church of
Ephesus; and there is also example of delegation of power of censures from the
Apostle to a Church where many Presbyters were fixed, as in the case of the
Corinthian delinquent before specified, which delegation was needless, if
coercitive jurisdiction by censures had been by divine right in a Presbyter, or
a whole College of them.

Now then, return we to the consideration of S. Hieromes saying: The Church
was governed (says he) communi Presbyterorum consilio, by the common Counsel
of the Presbyters. But,

1. Quo jure was this? That the Bishops were Superior to those which were then
called Presbyters, by custom rather then Divine disposition S. Hierome
affirms; but that Presbyters were joined with the Apostles and Bishops at
first, by what right was that? Was not that also by custom and condescension
rather then by Divine disposition? S. Hierome does not say but it was. For he
speaks only of matter of fact, not of right, It might have been otherwise,
though de facto it was so in some places.

* 2. [Communi Presbyterorum consilio] is true in the Church of Jerusalem,
where the Elders were Apostolical men, and had Episcopal authority and
something superadded, as Barnabas, and Judas and Silas, for they had the
authority and power of Bishops, and an unlimited Diocese besides, though
afterward Silas was fixed upon the Sea of Corinth. But yet even at Jerusalem
they actually had a Bishop, who was in that place superior to them in
Jurisdiction, and therefore does clearly evince, that the common-counsell of
Presbyters is no argument against the superiority of a Bishop over them.

* 3. [Communi Presbyterorum consilio] is also true, because the Apostles
called themselves Presbyters, as S. Peter, and S. John, in their Epistles. Now
at the first, many Prophets, many Elders (for the words are sometimes used in
common) were for a while resident in particular Churches, and did govern in
common; As at Antioch were Barnabas, and Simeon, and Lucius, and Manaen, and
Paul. Communi horum Presbyterorum consilio the Church of Antioch for a time was
governed; for all these were Presbyters, in the sense that S. Peter and S. John
were, and the Elders of the Church of Jerusalem.

* 4. Suppose this had been true in the sense that any body please to imagine,
yet this not being by any divine ordinance, that Presbyters should by their
Counsel assist in external regiment of the Church, neither by any intimation
of Scripture, nor by affirmation of S. Hierome, it is sufficient to stifle this
by that saying of S. Ambrose, Postquam omnibus in Ephesians. 4.
locis Ecclesiae sunt constitutae, and officia ordinata, aliter composita res
est quam caperat. It might be so at first de facto, and yet no need to be so
neither then, nor after. For at first Ephesus had no Bishop of it is own, nor
Crete, and there was no need, for S. Paul had the supra-vision of them, and S.
John, and other of the Apostles, but yet afterward S. Paul did send Bishops
thither; for when themselves were to go away, the power must be concredited to
another; And if they in their absence before the constituting of a Bishop had
entrusted the care of the Church with Presbyters, yet it was but in dependence
on the Apostles, and by substitution, not by any ordinary power, and it ceased
at the presence or command of the Apostle, or the sending of a Bishop to
reside. (...). Epist. ad Antioch.
So S. Ignatius being absent from his Church upon a business of being
persecuted, he writ to his Presbyters, Do you feed the flock amongst you, till
God shall show you who shall be your Ruler, viz. My Successor. No longer. Your
commission expires when a Bishop comes.

* 5. To the conclusion of S. Hieromes discourse, viz. That Bishops are not
greater then Presbyters by the truth of divine disposition; I answer, that this
is true in this sense, Bishops are not by Divine disposition greater then all
those which in Scripture are called Presbyters, such as were the Elders in the
Council at Jerusalem, such as were they of Antioch, such as S. Peter and S.
John, (...), all, and yet all of them were not Bishops in the present sense,
that is of a fixed and particular Diocese, and Jurisdiction.

* 2ly S. Hieromes meaning is also true in this sense, [Bishops by the truth of
the Lords disposition are not greater then Presbyters,] viz. quoad exercitium
actus, that is, they are not tied to exercise jurisdiction solely in their own
persons, but may asciscere sibi Presbyteros in commune consilium, they may
delegate jurisdiction to the Presbyters; and that they did not so, but kept the
exercise of it only in their own hands in S. Hieromes time, this is it, which
he says is rather by custom, then by Divine dispensation, for it was
otherwise at first, viz. de facto, and might be so still, there being no law of
God against the delegation of power Episcopal. * As for the last words in the
objection, [Et in communi debere Ecclesiam regere,] it is an assumentum of S.
Hieromes own; for all his former discourse was of the identity of Names, and
common regiment de facto, not de jure, and from a fact to conclude with a
Debere, is a Non sequitur, unless this Debere be understood according to the
exigence of the former arguments, that is, THEY OUGHT, not by Gods law, but in
imitation of the practice Apostolical; to wit, when things are as they were
then, when the Presbyters are such as then they were; THEY OUGHT, for many
considerations, and in Great cases, not by the necessity of a Divine precept.

* And indeed to do him right he so explaines himself, [Et in communi debere
Ecclesiam regere, imitantes Moysen qui cum haberet in potestate solus praeesse
populo Israel, septuaginta elegit, cum quibus populum judicaret.] The
Presbyters ought to Judge in common with the Bishop, for the Bishops ought to
imitate Moses, who might have ruled alone, yet was content to take others to
him, and himself only to rule in chief. Thus S. Hierome would have the
Bishops do, but then he acknowledges the right of sole jurisdiction to be in
them, and therefore though his Council perhaps might be good then, yet it is
necessary at no time, and was not followed then, and to be sure is needless
now. * For the arguments which S. Hierome uses to prove this his intention what
ever it is, I have and shall else where produce, for they yield many other
considerations then this collection of S. Hierome, and prove nothing less then
the equality of the offices of Episcocy and Presbyterate. The same thing is per
omnia respondent to the parallel place of In 1. Tim. 3. (...). Homil. 11.
S. Chrysostom, It is needless to repeat either the objection, or answer.

* But however this saying of S. Hierome, and the parallel of S. Chrysostom is
but like an argument against an Evident truth, which comes forth upon a
desperate service, and they are sure to be killed by the adverse party, or to
run upon their own Swords; For either they are to be understood in the
senses above explicated, and then they are impertinent, or else they contradict
evidence of Scripture and Catholic antiquity, and so are false, and dye within
their own trenches.

I end this argument of tradition Apostolical with that saying of S. Hierome
in the same place. Postquam Vnusquisque eos quos baptizabat suos putabat esse,
non Christi, and diceretur in populis, Ego sum Pauli, Ego Apollo, Ego autem
Cephae, in toto orb decretum est ut Vnus de Presbyteris electus superponeretur
caeteris, ut schismatum semina tollerentur. That is, a public decree issued
out in the Apostles times, that in all Churches one should be chosen out of the
Clergy, and set over them, viz. to rule and govern the flock committed to his
charge. This I say was in the Apostles times, even upon the occasion of the
Corinthian schism, for then they said I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and then
it was, that he that baptized any Catechumens, took them for his own not as
Christ's disciples. So that it was, tempore Apostolorum, that this decree was
made, for in the time of the Apostles S. James, and S. Mark, and S. Timothy,
and S. Titus were made Bishops by S. Hieromes express attestation; It was also
[toto orb decretum] so that if it had not been proved to have been an
immediate Divine institution, yet it could not have gone much less, it being,
as I have proved, and as S. Hierome acknowledges CATHOLIC, and APOSTOLIC. *

Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ, is an Apostolical precept. We have
22. And all this has been the faith and practice of Christendom.
seen how the Apostles have followed Christ, how their tradition is consequent
of Divine institution; Next let us see, how the Church has followed the
Apostles, as the Apostles have followed Christ. CATHOLIC PRACTICE is the next
Basis of the power and order of Episcopacy. And this shall be in subsidium to
them also that call for reduction of the state Episcopal to a primitive
consistence, and for the confirmation of all those pious sons of Holy Church,
who have a venerable estimate of the public and authorized facts of Catholic
Christendom.

* For Consider we, Is it imaginable, that all the world should immediately
after the death of the Apostles conspire together to seek themselves, and not,
ea quae sunt Jesus Christi; to erect a government of their own devising, not
ordayn'd by Christ, not delivered by his Apostles, and to relinquish a Divine
foundation, and the Apostolical superstructure, which if it was at all, was a
part of our Masters will, which whosoever knew, and observed not, was to be
beaten with many stripes? Is it imaginable, that those gallant men who could
not be brought off from the prescriptions of Gentilisme to the seeming
impossibilities of Christianity, without evidence of Miracle, and clarity of
Demonstration upon agreed principles, should all upon their first adhesion to
Christianity, make an Universal dereliction of so considerable a part of their
Masters will, and leave Gentilisme to destroy Christianity, for he that erects
another Economy then what the Master of the family has ordayn'd, destroys
all those relations of mutual dependence which Christ has made for the
coadunation of all the parts of it, and so destroys it in the formality of a
Christian congregation or family?

* Is it imaginable, that all those glorious Martyrs, that were so curious
observers of Divine Sanctions, and Canons Apostolical, that so long as that
ordinance of the Apostles concerning abstinence from blood was of force, they
would rather dye then eat a strangled hen, or a pudding, (for so Eusebius
relates of the Christians in the particular instance of Biblis and Blandina)
that they would be so sedulous in the contemning the government that Christ
left for his family, and erect another?

* To what purpose were all their watchings, their banishments, their fears,
their fastings, their penances and formidable austerities, and finally their so
frequent Martyrdomes, of what excellency or avail, if after all, they should
be hurried out of this world and all their fortunes and possessions, by
untimely, by disgraceful, by dolourous deaths, to be set before a tribunal to
give account of their universal neglect, and contemning of Christ's last
testament, in so great an affair, as the whole government of his Church?

* If all Christendom should be guilty of so open, so united a defiance
against their Master, by what argument, or confidence can any misbeliever be
persuaded to Christianity, which in all its members for so many ages together
is so unlike its first institution, as in its most public affair, and for
matter of order of the most general concernement, is so contrary to the first
birth?

* Where are the promises of Christ's perpetual assistance, of the impregnable
permanence of the Church against the gates of Hell, of the Spirit of truth to
lead it into all truth, if she be guilty of so grand an error, as to erect a
throne where Christ had made all level, or appointed others to sit in it, then
whom he suffers. * Either Christ has left no government, or most certainly the
Church has retained that Government whatsoever it is, for the contradictory to
these would either make Christ improvident, or the Catholic Church extremely
negligent (to say no worse) and incurious of her depositum. * But upon the
confidence of all * Christendom (if there were no more in it) I * suppose we
may fairly venture. Sit anima mea * cum Christianis.

THE first thing done in Christendom, upon the 23. Who first distinguished
Names used before in common.
death of the Apostles in this matter of Episcopacy, is the distinguishing of
Names, which before were common. For in holy Scripture all the names of
Clericall offices were given to the superior order, and particularly all
offices, and parts, and persons designed in any employment of the sacred
Preisthood, were signified by Presbyter and Presbyterium. And therefore least
the confusion of Names might persuade an identity and indistinction of office,
the wisdom of H. Church found it necessary to distinguish and separate orders,
and offices by distinct and proper appellations. [For the Apostles did know by
our Lord Jesus Christ that contentions would arise, (...), about the name of
Episcopacy,] says S. Clement, and so it did in the Church of Corinth, as soon
as their Apostle had expired his Epist. ad Corinth.
last breath. But so it was.

1. The Apostles, which I have proved to be the supreme ordinary office in the
Church, and to be succeeded in, we called in Scripture (...), Elders or
Presbyters, (...), says S. Peter the Apostle, the Elders, 1. Pet. 5. 1.
or Presbyters that are among you, I also who am an Elder, or Presbyter do
entreat. Such elders S. Peter spoke to, as he was himself, to wit, those to
whom the regiment of the Church was committed; the Bishops of Asia, Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bithynia, that is to Timothy, to Titus, to Tychicus,
to Sosipater, to the Angels of the Asian Churches, and all others whom
himself in the next words points out by the description of their office,
(...), etc. Feed the flock of God as Bishops, or being Bishops and overseers
over it; And that to rulers he then spoke is evident by his (...), for it was
impertinent to have warned them of tyranny, that had no rule at all. * The
mere Presbyters, I deny not, but are included in this admonition; for as their
office is involved in the Bishops office, the Bishop being Bishop and Presbyter
too, so is his duty also in the Bishops; so that pro rata the Presbyter knows
what lies on him by proportion and intuition to the Bishops admonition. But
again. * (...), says S. John the Apostle; and, (...). The Presbyter to Gajus;
the Presbyter to the elect Lady.

2. * If Apostles be called Presbyters, no harm though Bishops be called so
too, for Apostles, and Bishops are all one in ordinary office as I have proved
formerly. Thus are those Apostolical men in the College at Jerusalem called
Presbyters, whom yet the Holy Ghost calls, (...), principal men, ruling men,
and (...), the Presbyters that rule well. By Presbyters are meant Bishops, to
whom only according to the intention, and exigence of Divine institution the
Apostle had concredited the Church of Ephesus, and the neighboring Cities, ut
solus quisque Episcopus praesit omnibus, as appears in the former discourse.
The same also is Acts 20. The Holy Ghost has made you Bishops, and yet the
same men are called (...). The one place expounds the other, for they are both
ad idem, and speak of Elders of the same Church.

* 3. Although Bishops be called Presbyters, yet even in Scripture names are so
distinguished, that mere Presbyters are never called Bishops, unless it be in
conjunction with Bishops, and then in the General address, which, in all
fair deportments, is made to the more eminent, sometimes Presbyters are, or
may be comprehended. This observation if it prove true, will clearly show,
that the confusion of names of Episcopus, and Presbyter, such as it is in
Scripture, is of no pretense by any intimation of Scripture, for the
indistinction of offices, for even the names in Scripture it self are so
distinguished, that a mere Presbyter alone is never called a Bishop, but a
Bishop an Apostle is often called a Presbyter, as in the instances above. But
we will consider those places of Scripture, which use to be pretended in those
impertinent arguings from the identity of Name, to confusion of things, and
show that they neither enterfere upon the maine Question, nor this observation.
* Paul and Timotheus to all the saints which are in Christ Jesus which are at
Philippi, with the Bishops and Deacons. I am willinger to choose this instance,
because the place is of much consideration in the whole Question, and I shall
take this occasion to clear it from prejudice and disadvantage.

* By Bishops are here meant Presbyters, because * many Bishops in a Church
could not be, and yet * S. Paul speaks plurally of the Bishops of the * Church
of Philippi, and therefore must mean * mere Presbyters * so it is pretended.

1. Then; By [Bishops] are, or may be meant the whole superior order of the
clergy, Bishops and Priests, and that he speaks plurally, he, may besides the
Bishops in the Church, comprehend under their name the Presbyters too; for why
may not the name becomprehended as well as the office, and order, the inferior
under the superior, the lesser within the greater; for since the order of
Presbyters is involved in the Bishops order, and is not only inclusively in it,
but derivative from it; the same name may comprehend both persons, because it
does comprehend the distinct offices and orders of them both. And in this sense
it is (if it be at all) that Presbyters are sometimes in Scripture called
Bishops.

* 2. Why may not [Bishops] be understood properly; For there is no necessity
of admiitting that there were any mere Presbyters at all at the first founding
of this Church, It can neither be proved from Scripture, nor antiquity, if it
were denied: For indeed a Bishop or a company of Episcopal men as there were
at Antioch, might do all that Presbyters could, and much more. And considering
that there are some necessities of a Church which a Presbyter cannot supply,
and a Bishop can, it is more imaginable that there was no Presbyter, then that
there was no Bishop. And certainly it is most unlikely, that what is not
expressed, to wit, Presbyters should be only meant, and that which is
expressed should not be at all intended.

* 3. [With the Bishops] may be understood in the proper sense, and yet no more
Bishops in one Diocese then one, of a fixed residence; for in that sense is S.
Chrysostom and the fathers to be understood (...). Chrysostom. in 1. Phil.
in their commentaries on this place, affirming that one Church could have but
one Bishop; but then take this along, that it was not then unusual in such
great Churches, to have many men who were temporary residentiaries, but of an
Apostolical and Episcopal authority, as in the Churches of Jerusalem, Rome,
Antioch, there was as I have proved in the premises. Nay in Philippi it self,
If I mistake not, as instance may be given, full, and home to this purpose.
Salutant te Episcopi One simus, Bitus, Demas, Polybius, and omnes qui sunt
Philippis in Christo, unde and haec vobis Scripsi, says Ignatius in his
Epistle to Hero his Deacon. So that many Bishops (we see) might be at Philippi,
and many were actually there long after S. Paul's dictate of the Epistle.

* 4. Why may not [Bishops] be meant in the proper sense? Because there could
not be more Bishops then one, in a Diocese. No? By what law? If by a
constitution of the Church after the Apostles times, that hinders not, but it
might be otherwise in the Apostles times. If by a Law in the Apostles times,
then we have obtained the main question by the shift, and the Apostles did
ordain that there should be one, and but one Bishop in a Church, although it is
evident they appointed many Presbyters. And then let this objection be admitted
how it will, and do its worst, we are safe enough.

* 5. [With the Bishops] may be taken distributively, for Philippi was a
Metropolis, and had diverse Bishoprics under it, and S. Paul writing to the
Church of Philippi, wrote also to all the daughter Churches within its circuit,
and therefore might well salute many Bishops, though writing to one Metropolis,
and this is the more probable, if the reading of this place be accepted
according to Oecumenius, for he reads it not (...), but (...), Coepiscopis, and
Diaconis, Paul and Timothy to the Saints at Philippi, and to our fellow Bishops.

* 6. S. Ambrose referres this clause of [Cum Episcopis, and Diaconis,] to S.
Paul and S. Timothy, intimating In 1. Philip.
that the benediction, and salutation was sent to the Saints at Philippi from
S. Paul and S. Timothy with the Bishops and Deacons, so that the reading must
be thus; Paul, and Timothy with the Bishops and Deacons, to all the Saints at
Philippi etc. Cum Episcopis and Diaconis, hoc est, cum Paulo, and Timotheo, qui
utique Episcopi erant, simul and significavit Diaconos qui ministrabant ei. Ad
plebem enim scribit. Nam si Episcopis scriberet, and Diaconi, ad personas eorum
scriberet, and loci ipsius Episcopo scribendum erat, non duobus, vel tribus,
sicut and ad Titum and Timotheum.

* 7. The like expression to this is in the Epistle of S. Clement to the
Corinthians, which may give another light to this; speaking of the Apostles,
(...). Page 54.
They delivered their first fruits to the Bishops and Deacons. Bishops here
indeed may be taken distributively, and so will not infer that many Bishops
were collectively in any one Church, but yet this gives intimation for another
exposition of this clause to the Philippians. For here either Presbyters are
meant by (...), Ministers, or else Presbyters are not taken care of in the
Ecclesiastical provision, which no man imagines, of what interest soever he
be; it follows then that [Bishops and Deacons] are no more but Majores, and
Minores Sacerdotes in both places; for as Presbyter, and Episcopus were
confounded, so also Presbyter and Diaconus; And I think it will easily be
shown in Scripture, that the word [Diaconus,] is given oftener to Apostles, and
Bishops, and Presbyters, then to those ministers which now by way of
appropriation we call Deacons. But of this anon. Now again to the main
observation.

* Thus also it was in the Church of Ephesus, for S. Paul writing to their
Bishop, and giving order for the constitution and deportment of the Church
orders 1. Timoth. 3.
and officers, gives directions first for Bishops, then for Deacons. Where are
the Presbyters in the interim? Either they must be comprehended in Bishops or
in Deacons. They may as well be in one as the other; for [Diaconus] is not in
Scripture any more appropriated to the inferior Clergy, then Episcopus to the
Superior, nor so much neither. For Episcopus was never used in the new
Testament for any, but such, as had the care, regiment, and supra-vision of a
Church, but Diaconus was used generally for all Ministeries.

But yet supposing that Presbyters were included under the word Episcopus, yet
it is not because the offices and orders are one, but because that the order of
a Presbyter is comprehended within the dignity of a Bishop. And then indeed the
compellation is of the more principal, and the Presbyter is also comprehended,
for his conjunction, and involution in the Superior, which was the principal
observation here intended. Nam in Episcopo omnes ordines sunt, quia primus
Sacerdos est, hoc est, Princeps est Sacerdotum, and Propheta and Evangelista,
and caetera adimplenda officia Ecclesiae in Ministerio Fidelium. says S.
Ambrose. * So that if in the description of in Ephis. 4. * Idem ait S.
Dionysius Eccles. hierarch. cap. 5. (...).
the qualifications of a Bishop, he intends to qualify Presbyters also, then
it is Principally intended for a Bishop, and of the Presbyters only by way of
subordination and comprehension. This only by the way, because this place is
also abused to other issues; To be sure it is but a vain dream that because
Presbyter is not named, that therefore it is all one with a Bishop, when as it
may be comprehended under Bishop as a part in the whole, or the inferior,
within the superior, (the office of a Bishop having in it the office of a
Presbyter and something more) or else it may be as well intended in the word
[Deacons,] and rather then the word, [Bishop] 1. Because [Bishop] is spoken of
in the singular number, [Deacons] in the Plural, and so liker to comprehend
the multitude of Presbyters. 2. Presbyters, or else Bishops, and therefore much
more Presbyters, are called by S. Paul, (...), Ministers, Deacons is the word,
(...), Deacons by whose Ministration ye believed; and 3. By the same argument
Deacons may be as well one with the Bishop too, for in the Epistle to Titus, S.
Paul describes the office of a Bishop, and says not a word more either of
Presbyter or Deacons office; and why I pray, may not the office of Presbyters
in the Epistle to Timothy be omitted, as well as Presbyters, and Deacons too in
that to Titus? or else why may not Deacons be confounded, and be all one with
Bishop, as well as Presbyter? It will, it must be so, if this argument were any
thing else but an aerie and impertinent nothing.

After all this yet, it cannot be shown in Scripture that any one single, and
mere Presbyter is called a Bishop, but may be often found that a Bishop, nay
an Apostle is called a Presbyter, as in the instances above, and therefore
since this communication of Names is only in descension, by reason of the
involution, or comprehension of Presbyter within (Episcopus), but never in
ascension, that is, an Apostle, or a Bishop, is often called Presbyter, and
Deacon, and Prophet, and Pastor, and Doctor, but never retro, that a mere
Deacon or a mere Presbyter, should be called either Bishop, or Apostle, it can
never be brought either to depresse the order of Bishops below their throne, or
erect mere Presbyters above their stalls in the Quire. For we may as well
confound Apostle, and Deacon, and with clearer probability, then Episcopus, and
Presbyter. For Apostles, and Bishops, are in Scripture often called Deacons. I
gave one instance of this before, but there are very many. (...) was said of S.
Matthias when he succeeded Judas in the Apostolate. (...), said S. Paul to
Timothy Bishop of Ephesus. S. Paul is called (...). 2 Cor. 6. 4.
A Deacon of the New Testament, and (...), 1. Cor. 3. 5.
is said of the first founders of the Corinthian Church; Deacons by whom ye
believed. Paul and Apollos were the men. It is the observation of S.
Chrysostom, (...), in 1. Philip:
And a Bishop was called a Deacon, wherefore writing to Timothy he says to him
being a Bishop, Fulfillthy Deaconship.

* Add to this, that there is no word, or designation of any Clericall office,
but is given to Bishops, and Apostles. The Apostles are called [Prophets] Acts
13. The Prophets at Antioch, were Lucius and Manaen, and Paul and Barnabas; and
then they are called [Pastors] too; and indeed, hoc ipso that they are Bishops,
they are Pastors. Spiritus S. posuit vos Episcopos PASCERE ECCLESIAM DEI.
Whereupon trhe Geeke Scholiast expounds the word [Pastors] to signify Bishops,
(...). And ever since that S. Peter set us a copy in the compellation of the
Prototype calling him the Great Sheapherd, and Bishop of our souls, it has
obtained in all antiquity, that Pastors and Bishops are coincident, and we
shall very hardly meet with an instance to the contrary.

* If Bishops be Pastors, then they are Doctors also, for these are conjunct,
when other offices which may in person be united, yet in themselves are made
disparate. For [God has given some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists,
some PASTORS AND Ephesians. 4.
TEACHERS,] (...), If Pastors, then also Doctors, and Teachers. And this is
observed by S. Austin. Pastors, and Doctors whom you would Epist. 59. ad
Paulinum.
have me to distinguish, I think are one and the same. For Paul does not say;
some Pastors, some Doctors, but to Pastors he joyneth Doctors, that Pastors
might understand it belongs to their office to teach. The same also is
affirmed by Sedulius upon this place.

Thus it was in Scripture; But after the Churches were settled and Bishops fixed
upon their several Sees, then the Names also were made distinct, only those
names which did design temporary offices did expire (...) says S.
Chrysostom, Thus far the names were common, viz. in the sense above
explicated, (...). But immediately the names were made proper and distinct, and
to every order it is own Name is left, of a Bishop to a Bishop, of a Presbyter
to a Presbyter. * This could not be supposed at first, for when they were to
borrow words from the titles of secular honor, or offices, and to transplant
them to an artificial, and imposed sense, USE, which is the Master of
language, must rule us in this affair, and USE is not contracted but in some
process, and descent of time. * For at first, Christendom it self wanted a
Name, and the Disciples of the Glorious Nazarene were Christ'ned first in
Antioch, for they had their baptism some years before they had their Name. It
had been no wonder then, if per omnia it had so happened in the compellation of
all the offices and orders of the Church.

But immediately after the Apostles, and still more 24. Appropriating the word
Episcopus or Bishop to the Supreme Church Officer,
in descending ages Episcopus signified only the Superintendent of the Church,
the Bishop in the present, and vulgar conception. Some few examples I shall give
instead of Myriads. In the Canons of the Apostles the word (...), or Bishop is
used 36 times in appropriation to him that is the Ordinary Ruler and president
of the Church above the Clergy and the Laity, being 24 times expressly
distinguished from Presbyter, and in the other 14 having particular care for
government, jurisdiction, censures and Ordinations committed to him as I shall
show hereafter, and all this is within the verge of the first 50 which are
received as Authentic, by the Council of Can. 15. and 16.
Nice; of c. 9. and alibi.
Antioch, 25 Canons whereof are taken out of the Canons of the Apostles: the
Council of Gangra calling them Canones Ecclesiasticos, and Apostolicas
traditiones; by the Epistle of the first Council of Constantinople to Damasus,
which Theodoret has inserted into his story; by the post advent. Episc. Cypri.
Council of Ephesus; by advers. Praxeam.
Tertullian; by lib. 3. c. 59. de vita Constable.
Constantine the Great; and are sometimes by way of eminency called THE CANONS,
sometimes, THE ECCLESIASTICAL CANONS, sometimes, the ancient and received
Canons of our Fathers, sometimes the Apostolical Canons, (...), said the
Fathers of the Council in Ca. 4. cap. 18. de Ortbod: fide
Trullo: and Damascen puts them in order next to the Canon of Holy Scripture:
so in effect does I sidore in his preface to the work of the Counsels, for he
sets these Canons in front, because Sancti Patres eorum sententias authoritate
Synodali roborarunt, and inter Canonicas posuerunt Constitutiones. The H.
Fathers have established these Canons by the authority of Counsels, and have
put them amongst the Canonical Constitutions. And great reason, for in Pope
Stephens time, they were translated into Latin by one Dionysius at the
entreaty of Laurentius, because then Anno Dom: 257.
the old Latin copies were rude and barbarous. Now then this second
translation of them being made in Pope Stephens time, who was contemporary with
S. Irenaeus and S. Cyprian, the old copy, elder then this, and yet after the
Original to be sure, shows them to be of prime antiquity, and they are
mentioned by S. Stephen in an Epistle of his to Bishop Hilarious, where he is
severe in censure of them who do prevaricate these Canons.

* But for farther satisfaction I refer the Reader to the Epistle of Gregory
Holloander to the Moderators of the City of Norimberg. I deny not but they are
called Apocryphal by Gratian, and some others, viz. in the sense of the
Church, just as the wisdom of Solomon, or Ecclesiasticus, but yet by most,
believed to be written by S. Clement, from the dictate of the Apostles, and
without all Question, are so far Canonical, as to be of undoubted
Ecclesiastical authority, and of the first Antiquity.

Ignatius his testimony is next in time and in authority. Epist. ad Trall.
(...). The Bishop bears the image and representment of the Father of all. And
a little after, (...) etc. What is the Bishop, but he that has all authority
and rule? What is the Presbytery, but a sacred College, Counselors and
helpers or assessors to the Bishop? what are Deacons etc: So that here is the
real, and exact distinction of dignity, the appropriation of Name, and
intimation of office. The Bishop is above all, the Presbyters his helpers, the
Deacons his Ministers, (...), imitators of the Angels who are Ministering
Spirits. But this is of so known, so evident a truth, that it were but
impertinent to insist longer upon it. Himself in three of his Epistles uses it
nine times in distinct enumeration, viz. to the Trallians, to the
Philadelphians, to the Philippians. * And now I shall insert these
considerations.

1. Although it was so that Episcopus, and Presbyter were distinct in the
beginning after the Apostles death, yet sometimes the names are used
promiscuously, which is an evidence, that confusion of names is no intimation,
much less an argument for the parity of offices, since themselves, who
sometimes though indeed very seldom, confound the names, yet distinguish the
offices frequently, and dogmatically. (...). Epist. ad Heron.
Where by (...), he means the Presbyters of the Church of Antioch, so indeed
some say, and though there be no necessity of admitting this meaning, because
by (...) he may mean the suffragan Bishops of Syria, yet the other may be
fairly admitted, for himself their Bishop was absent from his Church, and had
delegated to the Presbytery Episcopal jurisdiction to rule the Church till he
being dead another Bishop should be chosen, so that they were Episcopi Vicarii,
and by representment of the person of the Bishop and execution of the Bishops
power by delegation were called (...), and this was done least the Church
should not be only without a Father, but without a Guardian too; and yet what a
Bishop was, and of what authority no man more confident and frequent then
Ignatius. * Another example of this is in Eusebius, speaking of the youth whom
S. John had converted and commended to a Bishop. Clemens, whose story this was,
proceeding in the relation says, (...) etc. But the Presbyter; unless by
(...) here S. Clement means not the Order, but age of the Man, as it is like
enough he did, for a little after, he calls him [(...)] The old man, Tum vero
PRESBYTER in domum suam suscipit adolescentem. Read depositum, O EPISCOPE,
says S. John to him. Tunc graviter suspirans SENIOR etc. So S. Clement. * But
this, as it is very unusual, so it is just as in Scripture, viz. in descent
and comprehension, for this Bishop also was a Presbyter, as well as Bishop, or
else in the delegation of Episcopal power, for so it is in the allegation of
Ignatius.

2. That this name Episcopus or Bishop was chosen to be appropriate to the
supreme order of the Clergy, was done with fair reason and design. For this
is no fastuous, or pompous title, the word is of no dignity, and implies none
but what is consequent to the just and fair execution of its offices. But
Presbyter is a name of dignity and veneration, Rise up to the gray head, and it
transplants the honor and Reverence of age to the office of the Presbyterate.
And yet this the Bishops left, and took that which signifies a mere
supra-vision, and overlooking of his charge, so that if we take estimate from
the names, Presbyter is a name of dignity, and Episcopus, of office and burden.
* [He that desires the office of a Bishop, desires a good work.] (...). Says
S. Chrysostom. Nec dicit si quis Episcopatum desider at, bonum desider at
gradum, sed bonum opus desider at, quod in majore ordine constitutus possit si
velit occasionem habere exercendarum virtutum. So S. Hierome. It is not an
honorable title, but a good office, and a great opportunity of the exercise of
excellent virtues. But for this we need no better testimony then of S. Isidore.
Episcopatus autem vocabulum inde dictum, quod ille qui superefficitur Lib. 7.
etymolog. c. 12.
superintendat, curam scil. gerens subditorum. But, Presbyter Greece, latin
senior interpretatur, non pro aetate, vel decrepita senectute, sed propter
honorem and dignitatem quam acceperunt. (...), says Julius Pollux.

3. Supposing that Episcopus and Presbyter had been often confounded in
Scripture, and Antiquity, and that, both in ascension and descension, yet as
Priests may be called Angels, and yet the Bishop be THE ANGEL of the Church,
[THE ANGEL,] for his excellency, [OF THE CHURCH,] for his appropriate
pre-eminence, and singularity, so though Presbyters had been called Bishops in
Scripture (of which there is not one example but in the senses above
explicated, to wit, in conjunction and comprehension;) yet the Bishop is (...)
by way of eminence, THE BISHOP: and in descent of time, it came to pass, that
the compellation, which was always his, by way of eminence was made his by
appropriation. And a fair precedent of it we have from the compellation given
to our blessed Savior, (...), The great sheapheard, and Bishop of our souls.
The name [Bishop] was made sacred by being the appellative of his person, and
by fair intimation it does more immediately descend upon them, who had from
Christ more immediate mission, and more ample power, and therefore [Episcopus]
and [Pastor] by way of eminence are the most fit appellatives for them who in
the Church have the greatest power, office and dignity, as participating of the
fullness of that power and authority for which Christ was called the Bishop of
our souls. * And besides this so fair a Copy; besides the useing of the word
in the prophecy of the Apostolate of Matthias, and in the prophet Isaiah, and
often in Scripture, as I have shown before; any one whereof is abundantly
enough, for the fixing an appellative upon a Church officer; this name may also
be intimated as a distinctive compellation of a Bishop over a Priest, because
(...) is indeed often used for the office of Bishops, as in the instances
above, but (...) is used for the office of the inferiors, for S. Paul writing
to the Romans, who then had no Bishop fixed in the chair of Rome, does command
them (...), Romans 16. 17.
not (...), this for the Bishop, that for the subordinate Clergy. So then, the
word [Episcopus] is fixed at first, and that by derivation, and example of
Scripture, and fair congruity of reason.

But the Church used other appellatives for Bishops, 25. Calling the Bishop and
him only the Pastor of the Church,
which it is very requisite to specify, that we may understand diverse
authorities of the Fathers useing those words in appropriation to Bishops,
which of late have bin given to Presbyters, ever since they have begun to set
Presbyters in the room of Bishops.

And first, Bishops were called [Pastors] in antiquity, in imitation of their
being called so in Scripture. Eusebius writing the story of S. Ignatius, lib.
3. hist. c. 36.
Denique cum Smyrnam venisset, ubi Polycarpus erat, scribit inde unam epistolam
ad Ephesios, eorumque Pastorem, that is, Onesimus, for so follows, in
quameminit Onesimi. Now that Onesimus was their Bishop, Epist. ad Ephesians.
himself witnesses in the Epistle here mentioned, (...) etc. Onesimus was
their Bishop, and therefore their Pastor, and in his Epistle ad Antiochenos
himself makes mention of Evodius (...) your most Blessed and worthy PASTOR.

* When Paulus Samosatenus first broached his heresy against the divinity of
our blessed Savior, presently a Council was called where S. Denis Bishop of
Alexandria could not be present, Caeteri vero Ecclesiarum PASTORES diversis e
locis and urbibus.... convenerunt Antiochiam. In quibus in signs and caeteris
praecellentes erant Firmilianus a Caesarea Cappadociae, Gregorius, and
Athenodorus Fratres.... and Eusebius. lib. 7. cap. 24.
Helenus Sardensis Ecclesiae Episcopus.... Sed and Maximus Bostrensis Episcopus
dignus eorum consortio cohaerebat. These Bishops, Firmilianus, and Helenus, and
Maximus were the PASTORS; and not only so, but Presbyters were not called
PASTORS, for he proceeds, sed and Prebyteri quamplurimi, and Diaconiad
supradictam Vrbem.... conventrunt. So that these were not under the general
appellative of Pastors. * And the Council of Sardis Can. 6.
making provision for the manner of election of a Bishop to a Widdow-Church,
when the people is urgent for the speedy institution of a Bishop, if any of the
Comprovincialls be wanting he must be certifi'd by the Primate, (...), that the
multitude require a Pastor to be given unto them. * The same expression is also
in the Epistle of Julius Bishop of Rome to the Presbyters, Deacons, and People
of Alexandria in behalf of their Bishop Athanasius, Suscipite itaque Fratres
hist. tripartlib. 4. c. 29.
charissimi cumomni divina gratia PASTOREM VESTRUM ACPRAESULEM tanquam vere
(...), And a little after, and gaudere fruentes orationibus qui PASTOREM VESTRUM
esuritis and sititis etc: The same is often used in S. Hilary and S. Gregory
Nazianzen, where Bishops are called PASTORES MAGNI, Great sheapheards, or
PASTORS; * When Eusebius the Bishop of Samosata was banished, Vniversi
lachrymis prosequuti sunt ereptionem PASTORIS sui, says Theodoret, they wept
for the loss of their PASTOR. And lib. 4. cap. 14.
Eulogius a Presbyter of Edessa when he was arguing with the Prefect in behalf
of Christianity, and PASTOREM (inquit) habemus, and nutus illius sequimur, we
have a PASTOR (a Bishop certainly for himself was a Priest) and his commands
we follow. But, I Theodoret. lib. 4. c. 18.
need not specify any more particular instances; I touched upon it before. *
He that shall consider, that to Bishops the regiment of the whole Church was
concredited at the first, and the Presbyters were but his assistants in Cities
and Villages, and were admitted in partem sollicitudinis, first casually and
cursorily, and then by station and fixed residency when Parishes were divided,
and endowed, will easily see, that this word [Pastor] must needs be
appropriated to Bishops to whom according to the conjunctive expression of S.
Peter, and the practice of infant Christendom (...) and (...), was entrusted,
first solely, then in communication with others, but always principally.

* But now of late, especially in those places where Bishops are exauctorated,
and no where else, that I know, but amongst those men that have complying
designs, the word [Pastor] is given to Parish Priests against the manner and
usage of Ancient Christendom; and though Priests may be called Pastors in a
limited, subordinate sense, and by way of participation (just as they may be
called Angels, when the Bishop is the Angel, and so Pastors when the Bishop is
the Pastor, and so they are called Pastores ovium in S. Cyprian) but never are
they called Pastores simply, or Pastores Ecclesiae for above 600 Epist. 11.
years in the Church, and I think 800 more. And therefore it was good counsel
which S. Paul gave, to avoid vocum Novitates, because there is never any
affectation of New words contrary to the Ancient voice of Christendom, but
there is some design in the thing too, to make an innovation: and of this we
have had long warning, in the New use of the word [Pastor].

IF Bishops were the Pastors, then Doctors also; it 26. And Doctor.
was the observation which S. Austin made out of Ephesians. 4. as I quoted him even
now, [For God has given some Apostles, some Prophets.... some Pastors and
Doctors]. So the Church has learned to speak. In the Greeks Council of
Carthage it was decreed, that places which never had a Bishop of their own
should not now have (...), a DOCTOR of their own, that is a Bishop, but still
be subject to the Bishop of the Diocese to whom formerly they gave obedience;
and the title of the chapter is, that the parts of the Diocese without the
Bishops consent (...), must not have another Bishop. He who in the title is
called Bishop, in the chapter is called the DOCTOR. And thus also, Epiphanius
haeres. 75.
speaking of Bishops calls them, (...), Fathers and DOCTORS, Gratia enim
Ecclesiae laus DOCTORIS est, says S. Ambrose, speaking of the eminence of the
Bishop, over the Presbyters and subordinate Clergy. The same also is to be seen
in S. Epist 59.
Austin, Sedulius, and diverse others. I deny not but it is in this
appellative, as in diverse of the rest, that the Presbyters may in
subordination be also called DOCTORS, for every Presbyter must be (...), apt to
teach (but yet this is expressed as a requisite in the particular office of a
Bishop) and no 1. Tim. 3.
where expressly of a Presbyter that I can find in Scripture, but yet because
in all Churches, it was by license of the Bishop, that Presbyters did Preach,
if at all, and in some Churches the Bishop only did it, particularly of
Alexandria ((...), says Sozomen) therefore it was that the lib. 7. c. 19.
Presbyter, in the language of the Church was not, but the Bishop, was often
called, DOCTOR of the Church.

THe next word which the Primitive Church 27. And Pontifex.
did use as proper to express the offices and eminence of Bishops, in
PONTIFEX, and PONTIFICATUS for Episcopacy. Sed a Domino edocti consequentiam
rerum, Episcopis PONTIFICATUS munera assignavimus, said the Apostles, as lib.
8. c. ult. Apost. constitut.
. S. Clement reports. PONTIFICALE (...) S. John the Apostle wore in his
forehead, as an Ensign of his Apostleship, a gold plate or medall, when he was
IN PONTIFICALIBUS, in his pontifical or Apostolical habit, says Eusebius.
lib. 3. hist. cap. 31.
. * De dispensationibus Ecclesiarum Antiqua sanctio tenuit and definitio SS.
Patrum in Nicaea convenientium.... and si PONTIFICES voluerint, ut cum cis
vicini propter utilitatem celebrent ordinationes. Said the Fathers of the
Council of Constantinople. lib. 9. c. 14. hist. tripart.
. * Qua tempestate in urbe Roma Clemens quoque tertius post Paulum and Petrum,
PONTIFICATUM tenebat, says lib. 3. c. 21.
Eusebius according to the translation of Ruffinus. * Apud Antiochiam vero
Theophilus per idem tempus sextus ab Apostolis Ecclesiae PONTIFICATUM tenebat,
says the same Eusebius. lib. 4. c. 20.
. * And there is a famous story of Alexander Bishop of Cappadocia, that when
Narcissus Bishop of Jerusalem, was invalid and unfit for government by reason
of his extreme age, he was designed by a particular Revelation and a voice
from Heaven, Suscipite Episcopum qui vobis a Deo destinatus est; Receive your
Bishop whom God has appointed for you, but it was when Narcissus jam senio
fessus PONTIFICATUS Ministerio sufficere non posset, says the story. Eusebius.
lib. 6. c 9.
. * Eulogius the confessor discoursing with the Prefect, that wished him to
comply with the Emperor, asked him; Numquid ille una cum Imperio etiam
PONTIFICATUM est consequutus? He has an Empire, but has he also a Bishopric?
PONTIFICATUS is the word. * But Eccles. hierarch.
S. Dionysius is very exact in the distinction of clericall offices, and
particularly gives this account of the present. Est igitur PONTIFICATUS ordo
qui praeditus vi perficiente munera hierarchiae quae perficiunt etc. And a
little after, Sacerdotum autem ordo subjectus PONTIEICUM ordini etc. To which
agrees Lib. 7. 12.
S. Isidore in his etymologies, Ideo autem and Presbyteri Sacerdotes vocantur,
quia sacrum dant sicut and Episcopi, qui licet Sacerdotes sint, tamen
PONTIFICATUS apicem non habent, quia nec Chrismate frontem signant, nec
Paracletum spiritum dant, quod solis deberi Episcopis lectio actuum
Apostolicorum demonstrat; and in the same chapter, PONTIFEX Princeps Sacerdotum
est.

One word more there is often used in antiquity And Sacerdos.
for Bishops, and that is SACERDOS. Sacerdotum autem bipartitus est ordo, say S.
Clement and Anacletus, for they are Majores and Minores. The Majores, Bishops,
the Minores, Presbyters, for so it is in the Apostolical Constitutions
attributed to Lib. 8. c. 46.
S. Clement, Episcopis quidem assignavimus, and attribuimus quae ad PRINCIPATUM
SACERDOTII pertinent, Presbyteris vero quae ad Sacerdotium. And in Lib. 3. Ep.
1.
S. Cyprian, Presbyteri cum Episcopis Sacerdotali honor conjuncti. But
although in such distinction and subordination and in concretion a Presbyter is
sometimes called Sacerdos, yet in Antiquity Sacerdotium Ecclesiae does evermore
signify Episcopacy, and Sacerdos Ecclesiae the Bishop. Theotecnus SACERDOTIUM
Ecclesiae tenens in Episcopatu, says Lib. 7. c. 28.
Eusebius, and summus Sacerdos, the Bishop always, Dandi baptismum jus habet
summus SACERDOS, qui est Episcopus, says Lib. de baptism.
Tertullian: and indeed Sacerdos alone is very seldom used in any respect but
for the Bishop, unless when there is some distinctive term, and of higher
report given to the Bishop at the same time.

Ecclesia est plebs SACERDOTI adunata, and Grex pastori suo adhaerens, says S.
Epist. 69.
Cyprian. And that we may know by [Sacerdos] he means the Bishop, his next
words are, Vnde scire debes Episcopum in Ecclesia esse, and Ecclesiam in
Episcopo. And in the same Epistle, qui ad Cyprianum Episcopum in carcere
literas direxerunt, SACERDOTEM Dei agnoscentes, and contestantes. * Eusebius. lib.
3. c. 21.
Eusebius reckoning some of the chief Bishops assembled in the Council of
Antioch, In quibus erant Helenus Sardensis Ecclesiae Episcopus, and Nicomas ab
Iconio, and Hierosolymorum PRAECIPUUS SACERDOS Hymenaeus, and vicinae huic
urbis Caesareae Theotecnus; and in the same place the Bishops of Pontus are
called Ponti provinciae SACERDOTES. Abilius apud Alexandriam tredecem annis
SACERDOTIO, ministrato diem obiit, for so long he was Bishop, cui succedit
Cerdon tertius in SACERDOTIUM. Et Papias similiter apud Hierapolim SACERDOTIUM
gerens, for he was Bishop of Hierapolis says Lib. 3. c. 35.
Eusebius, and the Epist. Comprovinc. ad S. Leonem.
Bishops of the Province of Arles, speaking of their first Bishop Trophimus,
ordained Bishop by S. Peter, say, quod prima inter Gallias Arelatensis civit as
missum a Beatissimo Petro Apostolo sanctum Trophimum habere meruit SACERDOTEM.
* * * The Bishop also was ever designed when ANTISTES Ecclesiae was the word.
Melito Lib. 4. c. 26.
quoque Sardensis Ecclesiae ANTISTES, says Eusebius out of Irenaeus: (...) is
the name in Greek, and used for the Bishop by Justin Martyr (and is of the
same authority and use with PRAELATUS and praepositus Ecclesiae.) ANTISTES
autem SACERDOS dictus, ab eo quod antestat. Primus est enim in ordine
Ecclesiae: and suprase nullum habet, says S. Isidore. Lib 7. Etymol c. 12.


* * * But in those things which are of no Question, I need not insist. One
title more I must specify to prevent misprision upon a mistake of theirs of a
place in S. Ambrose. The Bishop is sometimes called PRIMUS PRESBYTER. Nam and
Timotheum Episcopum Comment. in 4. Ephesians.
a secreatum Presbyterum vocat: quia PRIMI PRESBYTERI Episcopi appellabantur,
ut recedente eo sequens ei succederet. Elections were made of Bishops out of
the College of Presbyters (Presbyteri unum ex se electum Episcopum nominabant,
says S. Hierome) but at first this election was made not according to merit,
but according to seniority, and therefore Bishops were called PRIMI PRESBYTERI,
that is S. Ambrose his sense. But S. Austin gives Quast. Vet. et N. Testam. Qu.
101.
another, PRIMI PRESBYTERI, that is chief above the Presbyters. Quid est
Episcopus nisi PRIMUS PRESBYTER, h. e. summus Sacerdos (says he) And S.
Ambrose himself gives a better exposition of his words, then is intimated in
that clause before, Episcopi, and Presbyteri una ordinatio est? Vterque enim
Sacerdos est, sed Episcopus PRIMUS est, ut omnis Episcopus In 1. Tim. 3.
Presbyter sit, non omnis Presbyter Episcopus. Hic enim Episcopus est, qui
inter Presbyteros PRIMUS est. The bishop is PRIMUS PRESBYTER, that is, PRIMUS
SACERDOS, h. e. PRINCEPS EST SACERDOTUM, so he expounds it, not Princeps, or
Primus INTER In 4. Ephesians.
PRESBYTEROS, himself remaining a mere Presbyter, but PRINCEPS PRESBYTERORUM;
for PRIMUS PRESBYTER could not be Episcopus in another sense, he is the chief,
not the senior of the Presbyters. Nay Princeps Presbyterorum is used in a sense
lower then Episcopus, for Theodoret speaking of S. John Chrysostom, says,
that having been the first Presbyter at Antioch, yet refused to be made Bishop,
for a long time. Johannes enim qui diutissimi Princeps fuit Presbyterorum
Antiochiae, ac saepe electus praesul perpetuus vitator dignitatis illius de hoc
admirabili solo pullulavit.

* * * The Church also in her first language when she spoke of Praepositus
Ecclesiae, meant the Bishop of the Diocese. Of this there are innumerable
examples, but most plentifully in S. Cyprian in his 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 15, 23, 27
Epistles; and in Tertullian his book ad Martyrs; and infinite places more. Of
which this advantage is to be made, that the Primitive Church did generally
understand those places of Scripture which speak of Prelates, or Praepositi, to
be meant of Bishops; Obedite praepositis, Heb. 13. says S. Paul, Obey your
Prelates, or them that are set over you. Praepositi autem Pastores sunt, says
S. Austin, Prelates are they that are Pastors. But S. Cyprian sums up many of
them together, and insinuates the several relations, expressed in the several
compellations of Bishops. For writing against Florentius Epist. 69.
Pupianus, ac nisi (says he) apud te purgati fuerimus....eccejam sex annis nec
fraternitas habuerit Episcopum, nec plebs praepositum, nec grex Pastorem, nec
Ecclesia gubernatorem, nec Christus antistatem, nec Deus Sacerdotes; and all
this he means of himself, who had then been six years Bishop of Carthage, a
Prelate of the people, a governor to the Church, a Pastor to the flock, a
Priest of the most high God, a Minister of Christ.

The sum is this; When we find in antiquity any thing asserted of any order
of the hierarchy, under the names of Episcopus, or Princeps Sacerdotum, or
Presbyterorum primus, or Pastor, or Doctor, or Pontifex, or Major, or Primus
Sacerdos, or Sacerdotium Ecclesiae habens, or Antistes Ecclesiae, or Ecclesiae
sacerdos; (unless there be a specification, and limiting of it to a
parochial, and inferior Minister) it must be understood of Bishops in its
present acceptance. For these words are all by way of eminency, and most of
them by absolute appropriation, and singularity the appellations, and
distinctive names of Bishops.

BUT, (...) (says the Philosopher) 28. And these were a distinct order from
the rest.
and this their distinction of Names did amongst the Fathers of the Primitive
Church denote a distinction of calling, and office, supereminent to the rest.

For first Bishops are by all Antiquity reckoned as a distinct office of
Clergy. Si quis Presbyter, aut Diaconus, aut quilibet de Numero Clericorum....
pergat ad alienam parochiam praeter Episcopi sui conscientiam, etc. So it is in
the fifteenth Canon of the Apostles, and so it is there plainly distinguished
as an office different from Presbyter, and Deacon, above thirty times in those
Canons, and distinct powers given to the Bishop, which are not given to the
other, and to the Bishop above the other. * The Council of Ancyra inflicting
censures upon Presbyters first, then Deacons which had fallen in time of
persecution, gives leave to the Bishop to mitigate Can. 1. and 2.
the pains as he sees cause. Sed si ex Episcopis aliqui in iis vel
afflictionem aliquam.... viderint, in eorum potestate id esse. The Canon would
not suppose any Bishops to fall, for indeed they seldom did, but for the rest,
provision was made both for their penances, and indulgence at the discretion of
the Bishop. And yet sometimes they did fall; Optatus bewailes it, but withal
gives evidence of their distinction of order. Quid commemorem Laicos qui Lib.
1. ad Parmen.
tunc in Ecclesia nulla fuerant dignitate suffulti? Quid Ministros plurimos,
quid Diaconos in tertio, quid Presbyteros in secundo Sacerdotio constitutos?
Ipsi apices, and Principes omnium aliqui Episcopi aliqua instrumenta Divinae
Legis impie tradiderunt. The Laity, the Ministers, the Deacons, the Presbyters,
nay the Bishops themselves, the Princes and chief of all, proved traditors.
The diversity of order is herefairely intimated, but dogmatically affirmed by
him in his 2d book adv. Parmen. Quatuor genera capitum sunt in Ecclesia,
Episcoporum, Presbyterorum, Diaconorum, and fidelium. There are four sorts of
heads in the Church, Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and the faithful Laity. And
it was remarkable that when the people of Hippo had as it were by violence
carried S. Austin to be made Priest by their Bishop Valerius, some seeing the
good man weep in consideration of the great hazard and difficulty accruing to
him in his ordination to such an office, thought he had wept because he was not
Bishop, they pretending comfort told him, quia locus Presbyterii De vita
August. c. 4.
licet ipse majore dignus esset appropinquaret tamen Episcopatui. The office of
a Presbyter though indeed he deserved a greater, yet was the next step in order
to a Bishopric. So Possidonius tells the story. It was the next step, the next
in descent, in subordination, the next under it. So the Council of Chalcedon,
(...). It is sacrilege to bring down a Bishop to the degree Can. 29.
and order of a Presbyter, (...), so the Council permits in case of great
delinquency, to suspend him from the execution of his Episcopal order, but
still the character remains, and the degree of it self is higher.

* Nos autem idcirco haec scribimus (Fratres chariss.) quia novimus quam
Sacrosanctum debeat esse Episcopale Sacerdotium, quod and clero, and plebi
debet esse exemplo, said the Fathers of the Council of Antioch, in Eusebius,
The office of a Bishop is sacred, Lib. 7. c. 26.
and exemplary both to the Clergy, and the People. Inter dixit per omnia, Magna
Synodus, non Episcopo, non Presbytero, non Diacono licere, etc. And it was Can.

a remarkable story that Arius troubled the Church for missing of a Prelation
to the order and dignity of a Bishop. Post Achillam enim Alexander....ordinatur
Episcopus. Hoc autem tempore Arius in ordine Presbyterorum fuit, Alexander was
ordained a Bishop, and Arius still left in the order of mere Presbyters. * Of
the same exigence are all those clauses of commemoration of a Bishop and
Presbyters of the same Church. Julius autem Romanus Episcopus propter
senectutem defuit, erantque pro eo praesentes Vitus, and Vincentius
Presbyteriejusdem Ecclesiae. They were his Vicars, and deputies for their
Bishop in the Nicene Council, says Sozomen. But most pertinent is that of the

persecution related by the same man. Many of them were put to death. Erant
autem horum alii quidem Lib. 3. tripart. c. 2.
Episcopi, alii Presbyteri, alii diversorum ordinum Clerici. * And this
difference of Order is clear in the Epistle of the Bishops of Illyricum to the
Bishops of the Levant, De Episcopis autem constituendis, vel comministris jam
constitutis si permanserint usque ad finem sani, been....Similiter Presbyteros
atque Diaconos in Sacerdotali ordine definivimus, etc. And of Sabbatius it is
said, Nolens in suo ordine Manner Presbyteratus, desiderabat Episcopatum; he
would not stay in the order of a Presbyter, but desired a Bishopric. Ordo
Episcoporum quadripartitus est, in Patriarchis, Hist. tripart. l. 11. c. 5.

But it were infinite to reckon authorities, and clauses of exclusion for the
three orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons; we cannot almost dip in any tome
of the Counsels but we shall find it recorded: And all the Martyr Bishops of
Rome did ever acknowledge, and publish it, that Episcopacy is a peculiar
office, and order in the Church of God; as is to be seen in their decretall
Epistles, in the first tome of the Counsels. * I only sum this up with the
attestation of the Church of England, in the Per Binium Paris.
preface to the book of ordination. It is evident to all men diligently reading
holy Scripture and Ancient Authors, that from the Apostles times, there have
been these ORDERS of Ministers in Christ's Church, Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons. The same thing exactly that was said in the second Council of
Carthage, (...), Can. 2.
But we shall see it better, and by more real probation, for that Bishops
were a distinct order appears by this;

1. THe Presbyterate was but a step to Episcopacy, 29. To which the
Presbyterate was but a degree. Can. 10.
as Deaconship to the Presbyterate, and therefore the Council of Sardis
decreed, that no man should be ordained Bishop, but he that was firsta Reader,
and a Deacon, and a Presbyter, (...)* That by every degree he may pass to the
sublimity of Episcopacy. (...) etc. But the degree of every order must have the
permanence and trial of no small time. Here there is clearly a distinction of
orders, and ordinations, and assumptions to them respectively, all of the same
distance and consideration; And Theodoret out of the Synodicall Epistle of the
Lib. 5. c. 8.
same Council, says that they complained that some from Arrianisme were
reconciled, and promoted from Deacons to be Presbyters, from Presbyters to be
Bishops, calling it (...), a greater degree, or Order: And S. Gregory Nazianz.
in his Encomium of S. Athanasius, speaking of his Canonical Ordination, and
election to a Bishopric, says that he was chosen being (...), most worthy,
and (...), coming through all the inferior Orders. The same commendation S.
Cyprian Epist. 52.
gives of Cornelius. Non iste ad Episcopatum subito pervenit, sed per omnia
Ecclesiastica officia promotus, and in divinis administrationibus Dominum sepe
promeritus ad Sacerdotii sublime fastigium cunctis religionis gradibus
ascendit....and factus est Episcopus a plurimis collegiis nostris qui tunc in
Vrbe Roma aderant, qui ad nos liter as....de ejus ordinatione miserunt. Here is
evident, not only a promotion, but a new Ordination of S. Cornelius to be
Bishop of Rome; so that now the chair is full (says S. Cyprian) and quis quis
jam Episcopus fieri voluerit for is fiat necesse est, nec habeat Ecclesiasticam
ordinationem etc. No man else can receive ordination to the Bishopric.

2. THe ordination of a Bishop to his chair was 30. There being a peculiar
manner of Ordination to a Bishopric. Can. Apost. 1, and 2.
done de Novo after his being a Presbyter, and not only so, but in another
manner then he had when he was made Priest. This is evident in the first
Ecclesiastical Canon that was made after Scripture. (...). A Priest and Deacon
must be ordained of one Bishop, but a Bishop must be ordained by two or three
at least. And that we may see it yet more to be Apostolical, S. Anacletus in
his second Epistle reports, Hierosolymitarum primus Episcopus B. Iacobus a
Petro, Iacobo, and Iohanne Apostolis est ordinatus. Three Apostles went to the
ordaining of S. James to be a Bishop, and the self same thing is in words
affirmed by Anicetus; ut in ore duorum, veltrium stet omnis veritas; And S.
Cyprian observes that when Cornelius was made Bishop of Rome, there happened
Epist. Vnica,
to be many of his fellow Bishops there, and factus est Episcopus a plurimis
collegis nostris qui tunc in urbe Roma aderant. These Collegae could not be
mere Priests, for then the ordination of Novatus had been more Canonical, then
that of Cornelius, and all Christendom had been deceived, for not Novatus who
was ordained by three Bishops, but Cornelius had been the Schismatic, as being
ordained by Priests, against the Canon. But here I observe it for the word
[plurimis,] there were many of them ordination.

* In pursuance of this Apostolical ordinance, Nicene Fathers decreed that a
Bishop should be ordayn'd, Can. 4.
(...) by all the Bishops in the Province, unless it be in case of necessity,
and then it must be done by three being gathered together, and the rest
consenting; so the ordination to be performed. * The same is ratified in the
Council of Antiech, (...). Can. 19.
A Bishop is not to be ordained without a Synod of Bishops, and the presence of
the Metropolitan of the province. But if this cannot be done conviniently, yet
however it is required (...), the ordinations must be performed by many. The
same was decreed in the Council of Laodicea, can: 12. in the 13. Canon of the
African Code, in the 22th Canon of the first Council of Arles, and the Can. 12.
fifth Canon of the second Council of Arles, and was ever the practice of the
Church; and so we may see it descend through the bowels of the fourth Council
of Carthage to the inferior ages. Episcopus Can. 4.
qunm ordinatur, duo Episcopi ponant, and teneant Evangeliorum codicem super
caput, and cervicem ejus, and uno super eum fundente benedictionem,
reliquiomnes Episcopi qui adsunt manibus suis caput ejus tangant.

The thing was Catholic, and Canonical. It was prima, and immutabilis
constitutio, so the first Canon of the Council of A. D. 509.
Epaunu^ calls it; And therefore after the death of Meletius Bishop of Antioch,
a schism was made about his successor, and Evagrius his ordination Theodoret.
l. 9. cap 44.
condemned; because, praeter Ecclesiasticam regulam fuerit ordinatus, it was
against the rule of Holy Church. Why so? Solus enim Paulinus eum instituerat
plurimas regulas praevaricatus Ecclesiasticas. Non enim praecipiunt ut per se
quilibet ordinare possit, sed convocare Vniversos provinciae Sacerdotes, and
praeter tres Pontifices ordinationem penitus fieri, interdicunt. Which because
it was not observed in the ordination of Evagrius who was not ordayn'd by three
Bishops, the ordination was cassated in the Council of Rhegium. And we read
that when Novatus would feign be made a Bishop in the schism against
Cornelius, he did it tribus adhibitis Episcopis Cap. 1. 2.
(says Eusebius,) he obtained three Bishops, for performance lib. 6. hist.
cap. 33.
of the action.

Now besides these Apostolical, and Catholic Canons, and precedents, this
thing according to the constant, and United interpretation of the Greek
Fathers was actually done in the ordination of S. Timothy to the Bishopric of
Ephesus. [Neglect not the grace that is in thee by the laying on of the hands
of the Presbytery.] The Latin Fathers expound it abstractly, viz. to signify
the office of Priesthood, that is, neglect not the grace of Priesthood that
is in thee by the imposition of hands, and this Erasmus helps by making
[Presbyterij] to pertain to [Gratiam] by a new inter-punction of the words;
but however, Presbyterij with the Latin Fathers signifies Presbyteratus, not
Presbyterorum, and this Presbyteratus is in their sense used for Episcopatus
too. But the Greek Fathers understand it collectively, and (...) is put for
(...), not simply such, but Bishops too, all agree in that, that Episcopacy is
either meant in office, or in person. (...). So Oecumenius; and S. Chrysostom,
(...). So Theophilact, So Theodoret. The probation of this lies upon right
reason, and Catholic tradition; For,

3. THE Bishops ordination was peculiar in 31. To which Presbyters never did
assist by imposing hands,
this respect above the Presbyters, for a Presbyter did never impose hands on a
Bishop. On a Presbyter they did ever since the fourth Council of Carthage; but
never on a Bishop. And that was the reason of the former exposition. By the
Presbytery S. Paul means Bishops, (...). Presbyters did not impose hands on a
Bishop, and therefore Presbyterium is not a College of mere Presbyters, for
such could never ordain S. Timothy to be a Bishop. The same reason is given by
the Latin Fathers why they expound Presbyterium to signify Episcopacy. For
(says S. Ambrose) S. Paul had ordained Timothy to be a Bishop, Vnde and
quemadmodum Episcopum ordinet ostendit. Neque enim fas erat, aut licebat, ut
inferior ordinaret Majorem. So he; and subjoynes this reason, Nemo n. tribuit
quodnon accepit. The same is affirmed by S. Chrysostom, and generally by the
authors of the former expositions, that is, the Fathers both of the East, and
West. For it was so General and Catholic a truth, that Priests could not,
might not lay hands on a Bishop, that there was never any example of it in
Christendom till almost 600 years after Christ, and that but once, and that
A. D. 555.
irregular, and that without imitation in his Successors, or example in his
Antecessors. It was the case of Pope Pelagius the first, and dum non essent
Episcopi, qui eum ordinarent, inventi sunt duo Episcopi, Johannes de Perusio,
and Bonus de Ferentino, and Andraeas Presbyter de O stia, and ordinaverunt eum
Pontificem. Tunc enim non erant in Clero qui eum possent promovere. Says
Damasus. It was in case of necessity, in libr. Pontificali. vit. Pelag. 1.
because there were not three Bishops, therefore he procured two, and a Priest
of O stia to supply the place of the third, that three, according to the
direction Apostolical, and Canons of Nice, Antioch, and Carthage, make
Episcopal ordination. * The Church of Rome is concerned in the business to
make fair this ordination, and to reconcile it to the Council of Rhegium, and
the others before mentined, who if ask't would declare it to be invalid.

* But certainly as the Canons did command three to impose hands on a Bishop,
so also they commanded that those three, should be three Bishops, and Pelagius
might as well not have had three, as not three Bishops; and better, because, so
they were Bishops the first Canon of the Apostles, approves the ordination if
done by two, (...). And the Nicene Canon is as much exact, in requiring the
capacity of the person, as the Number of the Ordainers. But let them answer it.
For my part, I believe that the imposition of hands by Andreas, was no more in
that case then if a lay man had done it; it was (...), and though the
ordination was absolutely Un-canonicall, yet it being in the exigence of
Necessity, and being done by two Bishops according to the Apostolical Canon,
it was valid in natura rei, though not in forma Canonis, and the addition of
the Priest was but to cheat the Canon, and cozen himself into an impertinent
belief of a Canonical ordination. (...), Can. 6. Council. Sardic.
says the Council of Sardis. Bishops must ordain Bishops; It was never heard
that Priests did, or de jure might.

These premises do most certainly infer a real difference, between
Episcopacy, and the Presbyterate. But whether or no they infer a difference
of order, or only of degree; or whether degree, and order be all one, or no,
is of great consideration in the present, and in relation to many other
Questions.

1. Then it is evident, that in all Antiquity, Ordo, and Gradus were used
promiscuously. [(...)] was the Greek word, and for it the Latins used [Ordo]
as is evident in the instances above mentioned, to which, add, that Anacletus
says, that Epist. 3.
Christ did instituere duos Ordines, Episcoporum, and Sacerdotum. And S. Leo
affirms; Primum ordinem Epist. 84. c. 4.
esse Episcopalem, secundum Presbyteralem, tertium Leviticum; And these among
the Greeks are called (...), three degrees. So the order of Deaconship in S.
Paul is called (...), a good degree; and (...), etc: is a censure used alike in
the censures of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. They are all of the same Name,
and the same consideration, for order, distance, and degree, amongst the
Fathers; Gradus, and ordo are equally affirmed of them all; and the word gradus
is used sometimes for that which is called Ordo most frequently. So Felix
writing to S. Lib. 1 c. 12. de act is cum Felice Manich.
Austin, Non tantum ego possum contratuam virtutem, quia mira virtus est GRADUS
EPISCOPALIS; and S. Cyprian of Cornelius, Ad Sacerdotij sublime lib 4. Epist. 2.
fastigium cunctis religionis GRADIBUS ascendit. Degree, and Order, are used in
common, for he that speaks most properly will call that an Order in persons,
which corresponds to a degree in qualities, and neither of the words are
wronged by a mutual substitution.

2. The promotion of a Bishop ad Munus Episcopale, was at first called
ordinatio Episcopi. Stir up the Grace that is in the, juxta ORDINATIONEM tuam
in Episcopatum, says Sedulius; And S. Hierome; Prophetiae gratiam habebat cum
ORDINATIONE Episcopatus. *. Neque enim fas erat aut licebat ut inferior
ORDINARET majorem, says S. Ambrose, in 1. Tim. 3.
proving that Presbyters might not impose hands on a Bishop. * Romanorum
Ecclesia Clementem a Petro ORDINATUM edit, says Tertullian; and S. Hierome
affirms that S. James was ORDAIND Bishop de praescript. cap. 32.
of Jerusalem immediately after the Passion of our Lord. [Ordinatus] was the
word at first, and afterward [CONSECRATUS] came in conjunction with it, When
Moses the Monk was to be ordained, to wit, a Bishop, for that is the title of
the story in Theodoret, and spyed that Lucius was there ready to impose hands
on him, absit (says he) vt manus tua lib. 4. cap. 23.
me CONSECRET.

3. In all orders, there is the impresse of a distinct Character; that is, the
person is qualified with a new capacity to do certain offices, which before
his ordination he had no power to do. A Deacon has an order or power

-- Quo pocula vitae
Misceat, and latices, cum Sanguine porrigat agni,
as Arator himself a Deacon expresses it. A Presbyter has an higher order, or
degree in the office or ministry of the Church, whereby he is enabled, (...),
as the Council of Ancyra does intimate. But a Bishop has a higher yet; for
besides all the offices communicated to Priests, and Deacons; he can give cap.
1.
orders, which very one thing makes Episcopacy to be a distinct order. For,
Ordo, is defined by the Schools to be, traditio potestatis spiritualis, and
collatio gratiae, ad obeunda Ministeria Ecclesiastica; a giving a spiritual
power, and a conferring grace for the performance of Ecclesiastical
Ministrations. Since then Episcopacy has a new ordination, and a distinct
power (as I shall show in the descent) it must needs be a distinct order, both
according to the Name given it by antiquity, and according to the nature of the
thing in the definitions of the School.

There is nothing said against this but a fancy of some of the Church of Rome,
obtruded indeed upon no grounds; for they would define order to be a special
power in relation to the Holy Sacrament, which they call corpus Christi
natural; and Episcopacy indeed to be a distinct power in relation ad corpus
Christi Mysticum, or the regiment of the Church, and ordayning laborers for
the harvest, and therefore not to be a distinct order.

But this to them that consider things sadly, is true or false according as any
man list. For if these men are resolved they will call nothing an order but
what is a power in order to consecration of the Eucharist, who can help it?
Then indeed, in that sense, Episcopacy is not a distinct order, that is, a
Bishop has no new power in the consecration of the Venerable Eucharist, more
then a Presbyter has. But then why these men should only call this power [an
order] no man can give a reason. For, 1. in Antiquity the distinct power of a
Bishop was ever called an Order, and I think, before Hugo de S. Victore, and
the Master of the Sentences, no man ever denied it to be an order. 2. According
to this rate, I would feign know how the office of a Subdeacon, and of an
Ostiary, and of an Acolouthite, and of a Reader, come to be distinct Orders;
for surely the Bishop has as much power in order to consecration de Novo, as
they have de integro. And if I mistake not; that the Bishop has a new power to
ordain Presbyters who shall have a power of consecrating the Eucharist, is
more a new power in order to consecration, then all those inferior officers
put together have in all, and yet they call them Orders, and therefore why not
Episcopacy also, I cannot imagine, unless because they will not.

*** But however in the mean time, the denying the office and degree of
Episcopacy to be a new and a distinct order is an Innovation of the production
of some in the Church of Rome, without all reason, and against all antiquity.
This only by the way.

The Enemies of Episcopacy call in aid from all places for support of their
ruinous cause, and therefore take their maine hopes from the Church of Rome by
advantage of the former discourse. For since (say they) that consecration of
the Sacrament is the Greatest work, of the most secret mystery, S. Hieron: ad
Rusticum Narbonens: apud Gratian. did: 95. can: ecce ego. casus, ibid.
greatest power, and highest dignity that is competent to man, and this a
Presbyter has as well as a Bishop, is it likely that a Bishop should by Divine
institution be so much Superior to a Presbyter, who by the confession of all
sides communicates with a Bishop in that which is his highest power? And shall
issues of a lesser dignity distinguish the Orders, and make a Bishop higher to
a Presbyter, and not rather the Greater raise up a Presbyter to the
Counter-poise of a Bishop? Upon this surmise the men of the Church of Rome,
would infer an identity of order, though a disparity of degree, but the Men
of the other world would infer a parity both of order and degree too. The
first are already answered in the premises. The second must now be served.

1. Then, whether power be greater, of Ordaining Priests, or Consecrating the
Sacrament is an impertinent Question; possibly, it may be of some danger;
because in comparing Gods ordinances, there must certainly be a depression of
one, and whether that lights upon the right side or no, yet peradventure it
will not stand with the consequence of our gratitude to God, to do that, which
in Gods estimate, may tant' amount to a direct Undervaluing; but however it is
unprofitable, of no use in case of conscience either in order to faith, or
manners, and besides, cannot fix it self upon any basis, therebeing no way of
proving either to be more excellent then the other.

2. The Sacraments, and mysteries of Christianity if compared among themselves,
are greater, and lesser in several respects. For since they are all in order
to several ends, that is, productive of several effects, and they all are
excellent, every rite, and sacrament in respect of its own effect, is more
excellent then the other not ordained to that effect. For example. Matrimony is
ordained for a means to preserve chastity, and to represent the mystical union
of Christ and his Church, and therefore in these respects is greater then
baptism, which does neither. But The Nicene Creed.
baptism is for remission of sins and in that is more excellent then
Matrimony; the same may be said for ordination, and consecration, the one being
in order to Christ's natural body (as the Schools speak) the other in order to
his mystical body, and so have their several excellencies respectively; but
for an absolute pre-eminence of one above the other, I said there was no basis
to fix that upon, and I believe all men will find it so that please to try.
But in a relative, or respective excellency, they go both before, and after
one another. Thus Wool, and a Jewel, are better then each other; for wool is
better for warmth, and a jewel for ornament. A frogge has more sense in it,
then the Sun; and yet the Sun shines brighter.

3. Suppose consecration of the Eucharist were greater then ordaining Priests,
yet that cannot hinder, but that the power of ordaining may make a higher and
distinct order, because the power of ordaining, has in it the power of
consecrating and something more; it is all that which makes the Priest, and it
is something more besides, which makes the Bishop. Indeed if the Bishop had it
not, and the Priest had it, then supposing consecration to be greater then
ordination, the Priest would not only equal, but excel the Bishop, but
because the Bishop has that, and ordination besides, therefore he is higher
both in Order, and Dignity.

4. Suppose that Consecration were the greatest Clericall power in the world,
and that the Bishop, and the Priest, were equal in the greatest power, yet a
lesser power then it, superadded to the Bishop's, may make a distinct order,
and superiority. Thus it was said of the son of Man. Constituit eum paulo
minorem Angelis, he was made a little lower then the Angels. It was but a
little lower, and yet so much as to distinguish their Natures, for he took not
upon him the NATURE of Angels, but the seed of Abraham. So it is in proportion
between Bishop, and Priest; for though a Priest communicating in the greatest
power of the Church, viz. consecration of the venerable Eucharist, yet
differing in a less is paulo minor Angelis, a little lower then the Bishop,
the Angel of the Church, yet this little lower, makes a distinct order, and
enough for a subordination. * An Angel, and a man communicate in those great
excellencies of spiritual essence, they both discourse, they have both
election, and freedom of choice, they have will, and understanding, and
memory, impresses of the Divine image, and loco-motion, and immortality. And
these excellencies are (being precisely considered) of more real and eternal
worth, then the Angelical manner of moving so in an instant, and those other
forms and modalities of their knowledge and volition, and yet for these
superadded parts of excellency, the difference is no less then specificall. If
we compare a Bishop and a Priest thus, what we call difference in nature there,
will be a difference in order here, and of the same consideration.

5. Lastly it is considerable, that these men that make this objection, do not
make it because they think it true, but because it will serve a present turn.
For all the world sees, that to them that deny the real presence, this can be
no objection; and most certainly the Anti-episcopall men do so, in all senses;
and then what excellency is there in the power of consecration, more then in
ordination? Nay is there any such thing as consecration at all? This also would
be considered from their principles. But I proceed.

One thing only more is objected against the maine Question. If Episcopacy be a
distinct order, why may not a man be a Bishop that never was a Priest, as
(abstracting from the laws of the Church) a man may be a Presbyter that never
was a Deacon, for if it be the impresse of a distinct character, it may be
imprinted per saltum, and independantly, as it is in the order of a Presbyter.

To this I answer, It is true if the powers and characters themselves were
independent; as it is in all those offices of humane constitution, which are
called the inferior orders; For the office of an Acolouthite, of an Exorcist,
of an Ostiary, are no way dependant on the office of a Deacon, and therefore a
man may be Deacon, that never was in any of those, and perhaps a Presbyter too,
that never was a Deacon, as it was in the first example of the Presbyterate in
the 72. Disciples. But a Bishop though he have a distinct character, yet it is
not disparate from that of a Presbyter, but supposes it ex vi ordinis. For
since the power of ordination (if any thing be) is the distinct capacity of a
Bishop, this power supposes a power of consecrating the Eucharist to be in the
Bishop, for how else can he ordain a Presbyter with a power, that himself
has not? can he give, what himself has not received?

* I end this point with the saying of Epiphanius, Haeres 75.
Vox est Aerii haeretici unus est ordo Episcoporum, and Presbyterorum, una
dignitas. To say that Bishops are not a distinct order from Presbyters, was a
heresy first broached by Aerius, and has lately been (at least in the manner
of speaking) countenanced by many of the Church of Rome.

FOR to clear the distinction of order, it is evident 32. For Bishops had a
power distinct, and Superior to that of Presbyters.
in Antiquity, that Bishops had a power of imposing hands, for collating of
Orders, which Presbyters have not. * What was done in this affair in the times
of the Apostles I have already explicated; but now the inquiry is, what the
Church did in pursuance of the practice, and tradition Astolicall. As of
Ordination.
The first, and second Canons of the Apostles command that two, or three
Bishops should ordain a Bishop, and one Bishop should ordain a Priest, and a
Deacon. A Presbyter is not authorized to ordain, a Bishop is. * S. Dionysius
affirms, Sacerdotem Eccles. hier. c. 5.
non posse initiari, nisi per invocationes Episcopales, and acknowledges no
ordainer but a Bishop. No more did the Church ever; Insomuch that when Novatus
the Father of the old Puritans, did ambire Episcopatum, he was feign to go to
the utmost parts of Italy, and seduce or entreat some Bishops to impose hands
on him, as Cornelius witnesses in his Epistle to Fabianus, in Eusebius. * To
Lib. 6. cap. 33.
this we may add as so many witnesses, all those ordinations made by the
Bishops of Rome, mentioned in the Pontifical book of Damasus, Platina, and
others. Habitis de more sacris ordinibus Decembris mense, Presbyteros december,
Diaconos duos, etc. creat (S. Clemens) Anacletus Presbyteros quinque, Diaconos
tres, Episcopos diversis in locis sex numero creavit, and so in descent, for
all the Bishops of that succession for many ages together.

But let us see how this power of ordination went in the Bishops hand alone, by
Law and Constitution; for particular examples are infinite.

In the Council of Ancyra it is determined (...). Can. 13.
That Rural Bishops shall not ordain Presbyters or Deacons in another
diocese without letters of license from the Bishop. Neither shall the Priests
of the City attempt it. * First not Rural Bishops, that is, Bishops that are
taken in adjutorium Episcopi Principalis, Vicars to the Bishop of the diocese,
they must not ordain Priests and Deacons. For it is (...), It is another
diocese, and to be (...), is prohibited by the Canon of Scripture. But then
they may with license? Yes; for they had Episcopal Ordination at first, but
not Episcopal Jurisdiction, and so were not to invade the territories of their
neighbor. The tenth Canon of the Council of Antioch clears this part. The
words are these as they are rendered by Dionysius Exiguus. Qui in villis, and
vicis constituti sunt Chorepiscopi tametsi manus impositionem ab Episcopis
susceperunt, [and ut Episcopi sunt consecrati] tamen oportet eos modum proprium
retinere, etc. (...), the next clause [and ut Episcopi consecrati sunt]
although it be in very ancient Latin copies, yet is not found in the Greek,
but is an assumentum for exposition of the Greek, but is most certainly employed
in it; for else, what description could this be of Chorepiscopi, above
Presbyteri rurales, to say that they were (...), for so had country Priests,
they had received imposition of the Bishops hands. Either then the Chorepiscopi
had received ordination from three Bishops, and (...) is to be taken
collectively, not distributively, to wit, that each Country Bishop had received
ordination from Bishops, many Bishops in conjunction, and so they were very
Bishops, or else they had no more then Village Priests, and then this caution
had been impertinent.

* But the City Priests were also included in this prohibition. True it is, but
it is in a Parenthesis, with an (...), in the midst of the Canon, and there was
some particular reason for the involving them, not that they ever did actually
ordain any, but that since it was prohibited to the chorepiscopi to ordain
(to them I say who though for want of jurisdiction they might not ordain
without license, it being in aliena Parochia, yet they had capacity by their
order to do it) if these should do it, the City Presbyters who were often
dispatched into the Villages upon the same employment, by a temporary mission,
that the Chorepiscopi were by an ordinary, and fixed residence might perhaps
think that their commission might extend farther then it did, or that they
might go beyond it, as well as the Chorepiscopi, and therefore their way was
obstructed by this clause of (...).

* Add to this; The Presbyters of the City were of great honor, and peculiar
privilege, as appears in the thirteenth Canon of the Council of
Neo-Caesarea, and therefore might easily exceed, if the Canon had not been
their bridle.

The sum of the Canon is this. With the Bishops license the Chorepiscopi
might ordain, for themselves had Episcopal ordination, but without license
they might not, for they had but delegate, and subordinate jurisdiction; And
therefore in the fourteenth Canon of Neo-Caesarea are said to be (...), like
the 70 Disciples, that is, inferior to Bishops, and the 70 were to the twelve
Apostles, viz. in hoc particulari, not in order, but like them in subordination
and inferiority of jurisdiction: but the City Presbyters might not ordain,
neither with, nor without license; for they are in the Canon only by way of
parenthesis, and the sequence of procuring a faculty from the Bishops to
collate orders, is to be referred to Chorepiscopi, not to Presbyteri Civitatis,
unless we should strain this Canon into a sense contrary to the practice of
the Catholic Church. Res enim ordinis non possunt delegari, is a most certain
rule in Divinity, and admitted by men of all sides, and most different
interests.

* However we see here, that they were prohibited, and we never find before
this time, that any of them actually did give orders, neither by ordinary
power, nor extraordinary dispensation; and the constant tradition of the
Church, and practice Apostolical is, that they never could give orders;
therefore this exposition of the Canon is liable to no exception, but is clear
for the illegality of a Presbyter giving holy orders, either to a Presbyter, or
a Deacon, and is concluding for the necessity of concurrence both of Episcopal
order, and jurisdiction for ordinations, for, reddendo singula singulis, and
expounding this Canon according to the sense of the Church, and exigence of
Catholic Custom, the Chorepiscopi are excluded from giving orders for want of
jurisdiction, and the Priests of the City for want of order; the first may be
supplied by a delegate power in liter is Episcopalibus, the second cannot, but
by a new ordination, that is, by making the Priest a Bishop. For if a Priest of
the City have not so much power as a Chorepiscopus, as I have proved he has
not, by showing that the Chorepiscopus then had Episcopal ordination, and yet
the Chorepiscopus might not collate orders without a faculty from the Bishop,
the City Priests might not do it, unless more be added to them, for their
want was more. They not only want jurisdiction, but something besides, and that
must needs be order.

* But although these Chorepiscopi at the first had Episcopal Ordination, yet
it was quickly taken from them for their incroachment upon the Biships
Diocese, and as they were but Vicarij, or visitatores Episcoporum in villis,
so their ordination was but to a mere Presbyterate. And this we find, as soon
as ever we hear that they had had Episcopal Ordination. For those who in the
beginning of the 10th Canon of Antioch we find had been consecrated as Bishops,
in the end of the same Canon, we find it decreed de novo: (...), The
Chorepiscopus or. Country Bishop must be ordayn'd by the Bishop of the City,
in whose jurisdiction he is; which was clearly ordination to the order of a
Presbyter, and no more. And ever after this all the ordinations they made were
only to the inferior Ministeries, with the Bishop's License too, but they
never ordayn'd any to be Deacons, or Priests; for these were Orders of the Holy
Ghost's appointing, and therefore were gratiae Spiritus Sancti, and issues of
order; but the inferior Ministeries, as of a Reader, an Ostiary etc. were
humane constitutions, and required not the capacity of Episcopal Order to
collate them; for they were not Graces of the Holy Ghost, as all Orders
properly so called are, but might by humane dispensation be bestowed, as well
as by humane Ordinance, they had their first constitution. *

* The Chorepiscopi lasted in this consistence till they were quite taken away
by the Council of Hispalis: save only, that such men also were called
Chorepiscopi who had been Bishops of Cities, but had fallen from their honor
by communicating in Gentile Sacrifices, and by being traditors, but in case
they repented and were reconciled, they had not indeed restitution to their
See, but, because they had the indelible character of a Bishop, they were
allowed the Name, and honor, and sometime the execution of offices
Chorepiscopall. Now of this sort of Chorepiscopi no objection can be pretended,
if they had made ordinations; and of the other nothing pertinent, for they also
had the ordination, and order of Bishops. The former was the case of Meletius
in the Nicene Council, as is to be seen in the Epistle of the Fathers to the
Church of Alexandria. tripart hist. lib. 2. c. 12. ex Theodoret.
* But however all this while, the power of ordination is so fast held in the
Bishops hand, that it was communicated to none though of the greatest
privilege.

* I find the like care taken in the Council Can: 19.
of Sardis, for when Musaeus, and Eutychianus had ordained some Clerks,
themselves not being Bishops, Gaudentius (one of the moderate men, it is likely)
for quietness sake, and to comply with the times, would feign have had those
Clerks received into Clericall communion; but the Council would by no means
admit that any should be received into the Clergy (...), (as Balsamon
expresses upon that Canon,) but such as were ordained by them who were Bishops
verily, and indeed. But with those who were ordained by Musaeus and
Eutychianus, (...), we will communicate as with Laymen: (...), for they were no
Bishops that imposed hands on them; and therefore the Clerks were not ordained
truly, but were (...), dissemblers of ordination. Quae autem de Musaeo and
Eutychiano dicta sunt, trahe etiam ad alios qui non ordinati fuerunt, etc.
Says Balsamon, intimating, that it is a ruled case and of public interest.

* The same was the issue of those two famous cases, the one of Ischiras
ordained of Colluthus (...), one that dreamed only he was a Bishop. Ischiras
being ordained by him could be no Priest, nor any else of his ordaining, (...),
and Ischyras himself was reduced into lay communion, being deposed by the
Synod of Alexandria, (...), falling from the imagination of his Presbyterate,
say Apud Athanas. Apolog. 2. epist, Presb. and Diacon: Mareotic: ad Curiosum
and Philagrium.
the Priests and Deacons of Mareotis; And of the rest that were ordained with
Ischiras, (...) says S. Athanasius, and this so known a business, (...), No
man made scruple of the Nullity. * * The parallel case is of the Presbyters
ordained by Maximus, who was another Bishop in the air too; all his
ordinations were pronounced null, by the Fathers of the Council in
Constantinople. A third is of the blind Bishop of Agabra imposing hands while
his Presbyters read Cap. 4.
the words of ordination, the ordination was pronounced invalid by the first
Council of Sevill. These cases are so known, I need not insist on them. Cap. 5.
This only,

In diverse cases of Transgression of the Canons, Clergy men were reduced to
lay communion, either being suspended, or deposed; that is, from their place of
honor, and execution of their function, with, or without hope of restitution
respectively; but then still they had their order, and the Sacraments conferred
by them were valid, though they indeed were prohibited to Minister; but in the
cases of the present instance, the ordinations were pronounced as null, to have
bestowed nothing, and to be merely imaginary.

* But so also it was in case that Bishops ordained without a title, or in the
diocese of another Bishop, as in the Council of Can. 6.
Chalcedon, and of Can, 13.
Antioch (...). And may be it was so in case of ordination by a Presbyter, it
was by positive constitution pronounced void, and no more, and therefore may be
rescinded by the Counter-mand of an equal power; A Council at most may do
it, and therefore without a Council, a probable necessity will let us loose.
But to this the answer is evident.

1. The expressions in the several cases are several, and of diverse issue,
for in case of those nullities which are merely Canonical, they are expressed
as then first made, but in the case of ordination by a Non-Bishop, they are
only declared voy'd ipso facto. And therefore in that decree of Chalcedon
against Sinetitular ordinations, the Canon says; (...), IRRITAM EXISTIMARI
manus impositionem, to be esteemed as null, that is, not to have Canonical
approbation, but is not declared null, in Natura rei, as it is in the foregoing
instances.

2. In the cases of Antioch, and Chalcedon, the decree is pro futuro, which
makes it evident that those nullities are such as are made by Canon, but in the
cases of Colluthus, and Maximus, there was declaration of a past nullity and
that before any Canon was made; and though Synodall declarations pronoun'd such
ordinations invalid, yet none decreed so for the future, which is a clear
evidence, that this nullity, viz: in case of ordination by a Non-Presbyter, is
not made by Canon, but by Canon declared to be invalid in the nature of the
thing.

3. If to this be added, that in antiquity it was dogmatically resolved that by
the Nature, and institution of the Order of Bishops; ordination was appropriate
to them, then it will also from hence be evident, that the nullity of
ordination without a Bishop is not dependant upon positive constitution, but on
the exigence of the institution. * * Now that the power of ordination was only
in the Bishop, even they, who to advance the Presbyters, were willing enough to
speak less for Episcopacy, give testimony; making this the proper distinctive
cognizance of a Bishop from a Presbyter, that the Bishop has power of
ordination, the Presbyter has not. So S. Jerome, Quid facit Episcopus (except
a ordinatione) quod Presbyter non faciat. All things (says ad Evagrium.
he) [to wit all things of precise order] are common to Bishops with Priests,
except ordination, for that is proper to the Bishop. And S. Chrysostom, Sola
homil. 2. in. 1. Tim. 2.
la quippe ordinatione superiores illis sunt [Episcopi] atque hoc tantum
plusquam Presbyteri habere videntur. Ordination is the proper, and peculiar
function of a Bishop; and therefore not given him by positive constitution of
the Canon.

4. No man was called an heretic for breach of Canon, but for denying the
power of ordination to be proper to a Bishop: Aerius was by Epiphanius,
Philastrius, and S. Austin condemned, and branded for heresy, and by the
Catholic Church says Epiphanius. This power therefore came from a higher
spring, then positive and Canonical Sanction. But now proceed.

The Council held in Trullo, complaining that Can. 37.
the incursion of the barbarous people upon the Churches inheritance, says
that it forced some Bishops from their residence, and made that they could not
(...), according to the guise of the Church, give Orders and do such things as
DID BELONG TO THE BISHOP; and in the sequel of the Canon they are permitted in
such cases, ut and diversorum Clericorum ordinationes canonice faciant, to make
Canonical ordinations of Clergy men. Giving of Orders is proper, it belongs to
a Bishop. So the Council. And therefore Theodoret expounding that place of S.
Paul [by the laying on the hands of the Presbytery] interprets it of Bishops;
for this reason, because Presbyters did not impose hands. * There is an
imperfect Canon in the Arausican Council that has an expression very
pertinent to Can. 20.
this purpose, Ea quae non nisi per Episcopos geruntur, those things that are
not done, but by Bishops, they were decreed still to be done by Bishops, though
he that was to do them regularly, did fall into any infirmity whatsoever, yet
non sub praesentia sua Presbyteros agere permittat, sed evocet Episcopum. Here
are clearly by this Canon some things supposed to be proper to the Bishops, to
the action of which Presbyters must in no case be admitted. The particulars,
what they are, are not specified in the Canon, but are named before, viz:
Orders, and Confirmation, for almost the whole Council was concerning them,
and nothing else is properly the agendum Episcopi, and the Canon else is not to
be Understood. * To the same issue is that circum-locutory description, or name
of a Bishop, used by S. Chrysostom, (...). The man that is to ordain Clerks.

* And all this is but the doctrine of the Catholic Church which S. Epiphanius
opposed to the haeres. 75.
doctrine of Aerius, denying Episcopacy to be a distinct order (...) (speaking
of Episcopacy) (...), speaking of Presbytery. The order of Bishops begets
Fathers to the Church of God, but the order of Presbyters begets sons in
baptism, but no Fathers or Doctors by ordination. * It is a very remarkable
passage related by Eusebius in the ordination of Novatus to be Presbyter, the
Bishop did it (...), all the whole Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 33.
Clergy was against it, yet the Bishop did ordain him, and then certainly
scarce any conjunction of the other Clergy can be imagined; I am sure none is
either expressed or intimated. For it was a ruled case, and attested by the
Uniforme practice of the Church, which was set down in the third Council of
Carthage, Episcopus vnus esse potest per quem Can. 45.
dignatione Divina Presbyteri multi constitui possunt. This case I instance the
more particularly, because it is an exact determination of a Bishops sole power
of ordination. Aurelius made a motion, that, if a Church wanted a Presbyter to
become her Bishop, they might demand one from any Bishop. It was granted; But
Posthumianus the Bishop put this case. Deinde qui vnum habuerit, numquid debet
illi ipse vnus Presbyter auferri? How if the Bishop have but one Priest, must
his Bishop part with him to supply the necessity of the Neighbor
widdow-Church? Yea, that he must. But how then shall he keep ordinations when
he has never a Presbyter to assist him? That indeed would have been the
objection now, but it was none then. For Aurelius told them plainly, there was
no inconvenience in it, for though a Bishop have never a Presbyter, no great
matter, he can himself ordain many (and then I am sure, there is sole
ordination) but if a Bishop be wanting to a Church, he is not so easily found.

** Thus it went ordinarily in the style of the Church, ordinations were made
by the Bishop, and the ordainer spoken of as a single person. So it is in the
Nicene Council, the Council of Cap. 9.
Antioch, the Cap. 19.
Council of Cap. 2. and 6.
Chalcedon, and S. Jerome who writing to Pammachius against the errors of John
of Jerusalem; If thou speak (says he) of Paulinianus, he comes now and then
to visit us, not as any of your Clergy, but ejus a quo ordinatus est, that
Bishop's who ordained him.

* So that the issue of this argument is this. The Canons of the Apostles, and
the rules of the Ancient Counsels appropriate the ordination of Bishops to
Bishops, of Presbyters to one Bishop, (for I never find a Presbyter ordained by
two Bishops together, but only Origin by the Bishops of Jerusalem, and
Caesarea) Presbyters are never mentioned in conjunction with Bishops at their
ordinations, and if alone they did it, their ordination was pronounced invalid
and void ab initio.

* To these particulars add this, that Bishops alone were punished if
ordinations were Vncanonicall, which were most unreasonable if Presbyters did
join in them, and were causes in conjunction. But unless they did it alone,
we never read that they were punishable; indeed Bishops were pro toto, and
integro, as is reported by Sozomen in the case of Elpidius, Eustathius,
Basilius of Ancyra, and Eleusius. Thus also it was decreed in the second, and
sixth Chapters of the Council of Chalcedon, and in the Imperial constitutions.
Since therefore we neither find Presbyters joined with Bishops in commission,
or Novell: constit: 6. and 1. 223. cap. 16.
practice, or penalty all this while. I may infer from the premises the same
thing which the Council of Hispales expresses in direct, and full sentence,
Episcopus Sacerdotibus, ac Ministris solus honorem dare potest, solus auferre
non potest. The Bishop alone Cap. 6.
lone may give the Priestly honor, he alone is not suffered to take it away. *
This Council was held in the year 657, and I set it down here for this
purpose to show that the decree of the fourth Council Can: 2, and 3.
of Carthage which was the first that licensed Priests to assist Bishops in
ordinations yet was not obligatory in the West; but for almost 300 years
after, ordinations were made by Bishops alone. But till this Council no
pretense of any such conjunction, and after this Council sole ordination did
not expire in the West for above 200 years together; but for ought I know,
ever since then, it has obtained, that although Presbyters join not in the
consecration of a Bishop, yet of a Presbyter they do; but this is only by a
positive subintroduced constitution first made in a Provincial of Africa, and
in other places received by insinuation and conformity of practice.

* I know not what can be said against it. I only find a piece of an objection
out of S. Cyprian, who was a Man so complying with the Subjects of his
Diocese, that if any man, he was like to furnish us with an Antinomy. * Hunc
igitur (Fratres Dilectissimi) Epist. 33.
a me, and a Collegis qui praesentes aderant ordinatum sciatis. Here either by
his Colleagues he means Bishops, or Presbyters. If Bishops, then many Bishops
will be found in the ordination of one to an inferior order, which because it
was (as I observed before) against the practice of Christendom, will not
easily be admitted to be the sense of S. Cyprian. But if he means Presbyters by
[Collegae] then sole ordination is invalidated by this example, for Presbyters
joined with him in the ordination of Aurelius.

I answer, that it matters not whether by his Colleagues he means one, or the
other, for Aurelius the Confessor who was the man ordained, was ordained but to
be a Reader, and that was no Order of Divine institution, no gift of the Holy
Ghost, and therefore might be dispensed by one, or more; by Bishops, or
Presbyters, and no way enters into the consideration of this question
concerning the power of collating those orders which are gifts of the Holy
Ghost, and of divine ordinance; and therefore, this, although I have seen it
once pretended, yet has no validity to impugn the constant practice of
Primitive antiquity.

But then are all ordinations invalid which are done by mere Presbyters
without a Bishop? What think we of the reformed Churches?

1. For my part I know not what to think. The question has been so often asked
with so much violence, and prejudice; and we are so bound by public interest
to approve all that they do, that we have disabled our selves to justify our
own. For we were glad at first of abettors against the Errors of the Roman
Church, we found these men zealous in it, we thanked God for it (as we had
cause) and we were willing to make them recompense, by endeavoring to justify
their ordinations; not thinking what would follow upon our selves. But now it
is come to that issue, that our own Episcopacy is thought not necessary,
because we did not condemn the ordinations of their Presbytery.

2. Why is not the question rather, what we think of the Primitive Church, then
what we think of the reformed Churches? Did the Primitive Counsels, and
Fathers do well in condemning the ordinations made by mere Presbyters? If
they did well, what was a virtue in them, is no sin in us. If they did ill,
from what principle shall we judge of the right of ordinations? since there is
no example in Scripture of any ordination made but by Apostles, and Bishops,
and the Presbytery that imposed hands on Timothy, is by all antiquity expounded
either of the office, or of a College of Presbyters; and S. Paul expounds it
to be an ordination made by his own hands, as appears by comparing the two
epistles to S. Timothy together; and may be so meant by the principles of all
sides, for if the names be confounded, then Presbyter may signify a Bishop, and
that they of this Presbytery were not Bishops, they can never prove from
Scripture, where all men grant that the Names are confounded.

* So that whence will men take their estimate for the rites of ordinations?
From Scripture? That gives it always to Apostles, and Bishops (as I have
proved) and that a Priest did ever impose hands for ordination can never be
shown from thence. From whence then? From Antiquity? That was so far from
licensing ordinations made by Presbyters alone, that Presbyters in the
primitive Church did never join with Bishops in Collating holy Orders of
Presbyter, and Deacon, till the 4th Council of Carthage; much less do it
alone, rightly, and with effect. So that, as in Scripture there is nothing for
Presbyters ordaining, so in Antiquity there is much against it; And either in
this particular we must have strange thoughts of Scripture, and Antiquity, or
not so fair interpretation of the ordinations of reformed Presbyteries. But
for my part I had rather speak a truth in sincerity, then err with a glorious
correspondence.

But will not necessity excuse them who could not have orders from Orthodoxe
Bishops? shall we either sin against our consciences by suscribing to
heretical, and false resolutions in materia fidei, or else loose the being of
a Church, for want of Episcopal ordinations? * Indeed if the case were just
thus it was very hard with the good people of the transmarine Churches; but I
have here two things to consider.

1. I am very willing to believe that they would not have done any thing either
of error, or suspicion, but in cases of necessity. But then I consider that M.
Du Plessis, a man of honor, and Great learning de Eccles. cap. 11.
does attest, that at the first reformation there were many Archbishops and
Cardinals in Germany, England, France, and Italy that joined in the
reformation, whom they might, but did not employ in their ordinations; And what
necessity then can be pretended in this case, I would feign learn that I might
make their defense. But, which is of more, and deeper consideration; for this
might have been done by inconsideration, and irresolution, as often happens in
the beginning of great changes, but, it is their constant and resolved practice
at least in France, that if any returns to them they will reordayne him by
their Presbytery, though he had before Episcopal Danaeus part. 2. Isagog, lib.
2. cap. 22. Perron. repl. fol: 92. impress. 1605.
Ordination, as both their friends and their enemies bear witness.

2. I consider that necessity may excuse a personal delinquency; but I never
heard that necessity did build a Church. Indeed no man is forced for his own
particular to committ a sin, for if it be absolutely a case of necessity, the
action ceases to be a sin; but indeed if God means to build a Church in any
place, he will do it by means proportionable to that end; that is, by putting
them into a possibility of doing, and acquiring those things which himself
has required of necessity to the constitution of a Church. * So that,
supposing that Ordination by a Bishop is necessary for the vocation of Priests,
and Deacons (as I have proved it is) and therefore for the founding, or
perpetuating of a Church, either God has given to all Churches opportunity and
possibility of such Crdinations, and then, necessity of the contrary, is but
pretense and mockery, or if he has not given such possibility, then there is
no Church there to be either built, or continued, but the Candlestick is
presently removed.

There are diverse stories in Ruffinus to this purpose. Eccles. hist: lib. 10.
cap. 9. per Ruffinum.
When Aedesius and Frumentius were surprised by the Barbarous Indians, they
preached Christianity, and baptized many, but themselves being but Laymen
could make no Ordinations, and so not fix a Church. What then was to be done
in the case? Frumentius Alexandriam pergit.... and rem omnem, ut gesta est,
narrat EPISCOPO, ac monet, ut provideat virum aliquem dignum quem congregatis
jam plurimis Christianis in Barbarico solo Episcopum mittat. Frumentius comes
to Alexandria to get a Bishop. Athanasius being then Patriarch ordayn'd
Frumentius their Bishop, and tradito ei Sacerdotio, redire eum cum Domini
Gratia unde venerat jubet.... ex quo (says Ruffinus) in Indiae partibus, and
populi Christianorum and Ecclesiae factae sunt, and Sacerdotium caepit.

The same happened in the case of the Iberians Ibidem c. 10. and apud
Theodoret. l. 1.
converted by a Captive woman; postea vero quam Ecclesia magnifice constructa
est, and populi fidem Dei majore ardore sitiebant, captivae monitis ad
Imperatorem Constantinum totius Gentis legatio mittitur: Res gesta exponitur:
SACERDOTES mittere oratur qui caeptum erga se Dei munus implerent. The work of
Christianity could not be completed, nor a Church founded without the Ministry
of Bishops.

* Thus the case is evident, that the want of a Bishop will not excuse us from
our endeavors of acquiring one; and where God means to found a Church there
he will supply them with those means, and Ministeries which himself has made
of ordinary and absolute necessity. And therefore if it happens that those
Bishops which are of ordinary Ministration amongst us, prove heretical, still
Gods Church is Catholic, and though with trouble, yet Orthodoxe Bishops may be
acquired. For just so it happened when Mauvia Queen of the Saracens was so
earnest to have Moses the Hermit made the Bishop of her Nation, and offered
peace to the Catholics upon that condition; Lucius an Arrian troubled the
affayre by his interposing and offering to ordain Moses; The Hermit discovered
his vileness, and it a Eccles: hist. lib. 11. cap. 6. per Ruffinum.
majore dedecore deformatus compulsus est acquiescere. Moses refused to be
ordayn'd by him that was an Arrian. So did the reformed Churches refuse
ordinations by the Bishops of the Roman communion. But what then might they
have done? Even the same that Moses did in that necessity; compulsus est ab
Episcopis quos in exilium truserat (Lucius) sacerdotium sumere. Those good
people might have had orders from the Bishops of England, or the Lutheran
Churches, if at least they thought our Churches Catholic, and Christian.

If an ordinary necessity will not excuse this, will not an extraordinary
calling justify it? Yea, most certainly, could we but see an ordinary proof
for an extraordinary calling, viz: an evident prophecy, demonstration of
Miracles, certainety of reason, clarity of sense, or any thing that might make
faith of an extraordinary mission.

But shall we then condemn those few of the Reformed Churches whose
ordinations always have been without Bishops? No indeed. That must not be.
They stand, or fall to their own Master. And though I cannot justify their
ordinations, yet what degree their Necessity is of, what their desire of
Episcopal ordinations may do for their personal excuse, and how far a good
life, and a Catholic belief may lead a man in the way to heaven, (although
the forms of external communion be not observed) I cannot determine. * For
ought I know, their condition is the same with that of the Church of Pergamus
[I know thy works, and where thou dwell, even where Satan's seat is, and
thou heldest fast my FAITH, and have not denied my Name; Nihilominus habeo
adversus te pauca, some few things I have against thee;] and yet of them, the
want of Canonical ordinations is a defect which I trust themselves desire to
be remedied; but if it cannot be done, their sin indeed is the less, but
their misery the Greater. * I am sure I have said sooth, but whether or no it
will be thought so, I cannot tell; and yet why it may not I cannot guess,
unless they only be impeccable, which I suppose will not so easily be thought
of them, who themselves think, that all the Church possibly may fail. But
this I would not have declared so freely, had not the necessity of our own
Churches required it, and that the first pretense of the legality, and validity
of their ordinations been boyed up to the height of an absolute necessity; for
else why shall it be called Tyranny in us to call on them to conform to us,
and to the practice of the Catholic Church, and yet in them be called a good
and a holy zeal to exact our conformity to them; But I hope it will so happen
to us, that it will be verifyed here, what was once said of the Catholics
under the fury of Iustina, sed tanta fuit persever antia fidelium populorum, vt
animas prius amittere, quam Episcopum mallent; If it were put to our choice,
rather to dye (to wit the death of Martyrs, not rebels) then loose the sacred
order, and offices of Episcopacy, without which no Priest, no ordination, no
consecration of the Sacrament, no absolution, no rite, or Sacrament
legitimately can be performed in order to eternity.

The sum is this. If the Canons, and Sanctions Apostolical, if the decrees
of eight famous Counsels in Christendom, of Ancyra, of Antioch, of Sardis, of
Alexandria, two of Constantinople, the Arausican Council, and that of
Hispalis; if the constant successive Acts of the famous Martyr Bishops of Rome
making ordinations, if the testimony of the whole Pontifical book, if the
dogmaticall resolution of so many Fathers, S. Denis, S. Cornelius, S.
Athanasius, S. Hierome, S. Chrysostom, S. Epiphanius, S. Austin, and diverse
others, all appropriating ordinations to the Bishops hand: if the constant
voice of Christendom, declaring ordinations made by Presbyters, to be null,
and void in the nature of the thing: and never any act of ordination by a
Non-Bishop, approoved by any Council, decretall, or single suffrage of any
famous man in Christendom: if that ordinations of Bishops were always made,
and they ever done by Bishops, and no pretense of Priests joining with them in
their consecrations, and after all this it was declared heresy to communicate
the power of giving orders to Presbyters either alone, or in conjunction with
Bishops, as it was in the case of Aerius: if all this, that is, if whatsoever
can be imagined, be sufficient to make faith in this particular; then it is
evident that the power, and order of Bishops is greater then the power, and
order of Presbyters, to wit, in this Great particular of ordination, and that
by this loud voice, and united vote of Christendom.

* BUT this was but the first part of the power 33. And Confirmation,
which Catholic antiquity affixed to the order of Episcopacy. The next is of
Confirmation of baptized people. And here the rule was this, which was thus
expressed by Damascen: Apostolorum, and Successorum eorum est per manus
impositionem donum Epist. de Chorepisc.
Spiritus sancti tradere. It belongs to the Apostles and their successors to
give the Holy Ghost by imposition of hands. But see this in particular instance.

The Council of Eliberis giving permission to faithful people of the Laity to
baptize Catechumens in cases of necessity, and exigence of journey; it a tamen
ut si supervixerit [baptizatus] ad Episcopum eum perducat, ut per manus
impositionem proficere possit. Let him be carried to the Bishop to be improved
by imposition of the BISHOPS hands. This was Law.

It was also custom says S. Cyprian, Quod nunc Epist. ad Iubaian.
quoque apud nos geritur, ut qui in Ecclesia baptizantur, per Praepositos
Ecclesiae offerantur, and per nostram orationem, and manus impositionem
Spiritum sanctum consequantur, and signaculo Dominico consummentur. And this
custom was Catholic too, and the Law was of Universal concernement. OMNES
Fideles per manuum impositionem EPISCOPORUM Spiritum Sanctum post baptismum
accipere debent, ut pleni Christiani accipere debent. So S. Vrbane in his
decretall Epistle; And, Omnibus festinandum est sine Apud Sev. Binium in 1.
tom. Council.
mora renasci, and demum CONSIGNARI AB EPISCOPO Et septiformem Spiritus
sanctigratiam recipere; so says the old Author of the fourth Epistle under the
name of S. Clement. ALL FAITHFUL baptized people must go to the Bishop to be
consigned, and so by imposition of the Bishops hands to obtain the seven fold
gifts of the Holy Ghost.

Meltiades in his Epistle to the Bishops of Spain affirms confirmation in
this, to have a special excellency besides baptism, quod solum a summis
Sacerdotibus confertur, because Bishops only can give confirmation; And the
same is said, and proov'd by S. Eusebius in his third Epistle enjoining great
veneration to this holy mystery, quod ab aliis perfici non potest nisi a summis
Sacerdotibus. It cannot, it may not be performed by any, but by the Bishops.

Thus S. Chrysostom speaking of S. Philip converting Homil. 18. in Act.
the Samaritans, (...). Philip baptizing the men of Samaria, gave not the Holy
Ghost to them whom he had baptized. For HE HAD NOT POWER. For this gift was
only of the twelve Apostles. And a little after: (...). This was PECULIAR to
the Apostles. (...), whence it comes to pass, that the principal and chief
of the Church do it, and none else. And George Pachymeres, the Paraphrast of
S. Dionysius; (...). In cap. 5. de Eccles. hierarch.
It is required that a Bishop should consigne faithful people baptized. For
this was the Ancient practice.

I shall not need to instance in too many particulars, for that the Ministry of
confirmation was by Catholic custom appropriate to Bishops in all ages of the
Primitive Church is to be seen by the concurrent testimony of Counsels, and
Fathers; particularly of S. Clemens Alexandrinus in Lib. 3. hist. cap. 17.
Eusebius, De Baptismo.
Tertullian, S. Epist. 1. cap. 3. ad Decent.
Innocentius the first, Epist. 4.
Damasus, Epist. 88.
S. Leo, in Epist. ad Episc. German.
John the third, in S. Lib. 3. ep. 9.

Sevill which affirms, Non licere Presbyteris.... per impositionem manus

Presbyters to give confirmation, for it is properly an act of Episcopal
power.... Chrismate spiritus S. superinfunditur. Vtraque vero ista manu, and
ore Antistitis impetramus. These are enough for authority, and dogmaticall
resolution from antiquity. For truth is, the first that ever did communicate
the power of confirming to Presbyters was Photius, the first author of that
unhappy and long lasting schism between the Latin, and Greek Churches, and it
was upon this occasion too. For when the vide Anastabiblioth praefat. in Can.
8. Synodi.
Bulgarians were first converted, the Greeks sent Presbyters to baptize, and
to confirm them. But the Latins sent again to have them re-confirmed, both
because (as they pretended) the Greeks had no jurisdiction in Bulgaria, nor
the Presbyters a capacity of order to give confirmation.

The matters of fact, and acts Episcopal of confirmation are innumerable, but
most famous are those confirmations made by S. Rembert Bishop of vide Optatum.
lib. 2. S. Bernard. in vita S Malachiae. Surium. tom. 1. in Febr.
Brema, and of S. Malchus attested by S. Bernard, because they were ratified by
miracle, says the Ancient story. I end this with the saying of S. Hierome,
Exigis ubi scriptum sit? In Actibus Apostolorum. Sed etiamsi Scripturae
authoritas non subesset, totius orbis in hanc partem consensus instar praecepti
dial. adv. Lucifer.
obtineret. If you ask where it is written? (viz. that Bishops alone should
confirm) It is written in the Acts of the Apostles (meaning, by precedent,
though not express precept) but if there were no authority of Scripture for
it, yet the consent of all the world upon this particular is instead of a
command. *** It was fortunate that S. Hierome has expressed himself so
confidently in this affair, for by this we are armed against an objection from
his own words, for in the same dialogue, speaking of some acts of Episcopal
privilege and peculiar ministration, particularly, of Confirmation, he says,
it was ad honorem potius Sacerdotii quam ad legis necessitatem. For the honor
of the Priesthood, rather then for the necessity of a law.

To this the answer is evident from his own words: That Bishops should give the
Holy Ghost in confirmation, is written in the Acts of the Apostles; and now
that this is reserved rather for the honor of Episcopacy, then a simple
necessity in the nature of the thing makes no matter. For the question here
that is only of concernment, is not to what end this power is reserved to the
Bishop, but by whom it was reserved? Now S. Hierome says it was done apud
Acta, in the Scripture, therefore by Gods Holy Spirit, and the end he also
specifies, viz. for the honor of that sacred order, non propter legis
necessitatem, not that there is any necessity of law, that confirmation should
be administered by the Bishop. Not that a Priest may do it, but that, as S.
Hierome himself there argues, the Holy Ghost being already given in baptism,
if it happens that Bishops may not be had (for he puts the case concerning
persons in bondage, and places remore, and destitute of Bishops) then in that
case there is not the absolute necessity of a Law, that Confirmation should be
had at all: A man does not perish if he have it not; for that this thing was
reserved to a Bishops peculiar ministration, was indeed an honor to the
function, but it was not for the necessity of a Law tying people in all cases
actually to acquire it. So that this [non necessarium] is not to be referred to
the Bishops ministration, as if it were not necessary for him to do it when it
is to be done, not that a Priest may do it if a Bishop may not be had; but
this non necessity is to be referred to confirmation it self; so that if a
Bishop cannot be had, confirmation, though with much loss, yet with no danger,
may be omitted. This is the sum of S. Hieroms discourse, this reconciles him
to himself, this makes him speak conformably to his first assertions, and
consequently to his arguments; and to be sure, no exposition can make these
words to intend that this reservation of the power of confirmation to Bishops,
is not done by the spirit of God, and then let the sense of the words be what
they will, they can do no hurt to the cause; and as easily may we escape from
those words of his, to Rusticus Bishop of Narbona. Sed quia scriptum est,
Presbyteri duplici honor honorentur.... praedicare eos decet, utile est
benedicere, congruum confirmare, etc. It is quoted by Gratian did. 95. can.
ecce ego. But the gloss upon the place expounds him thus, i. e. in fide, the
Presbyters may preach, they may confirm their Auditors, not by consignation of
Chrisme, but by confirmation of faith; and for this, quotes a parallel place
for the use of the word [Confirmare] by authority of S. Gregory, who sent
Zachary his legate Cause. 11. q. 3. can. Quod praedecessor.
into Germany from the Sea of Rome, ut Orthodoxos Episcopos, Presbyteros, vel
quoscunque reperire potuisset in verbo exhortationis perfectos, amplius
confirmaret. Certainly S. Gregory did not intend that his legate Zachary should
confirm Bishops and Priests in any other sense but this of S. Hieroms in the
present, to wit, in faith and doctrine, not in rite, and mystery, and neither
could S. Hierome himself intend that Presbyters should do it at all but in
this sense of S. Gregory, for else he becomes an Antistrephon, and his own
opposite.

* Yea, but there is a worse matter then this. S. in Ephesians. 4.
Ambrose tells of the Egyptian Priests, that they in the absence of the Bishop
do confirm. Denique apud Egyptum Presbyteri consignant si praesens non sit
Episcopus. But,

1. The passage is suspicious, for it interrupts a discourse of S. Ambrose's
concerning the Primitive Order of election to the Bishopric, and is no way
pertinent to the discourse, but is incircled with a story of a far different
consequence, which is not easily thought to have been done by any considering
and intelligent Author.

2. But suppose the clause is not surreptitious, but natural to the discourse,
and borne with it, yet it is matter of fact, not of right, for S. Ambrose
neither approves, nor disproves it, and so it must go for a singular act
against the Catholic practice and Laws of Christendom.

3. If the whole clause be not surreptitious, yet the word [Consignant] is, for
S. Austin who has the same discourse, the same thing, viz: of the dignity of
Presbyters, tells this story of the Act and honor of Presbyters in Alexandria,
and all Egypt, almost in the other words of his Master S. Ambrose, but he
tells it thus, Nam and in Alexandria and per totum Aegyptum si desit Episcopus,
Consecrat Presbyter. So that it should not be consignat, but consecrat; Quaest.
101. Vet. and N. Testam. Basileae.
for no story tells of any confirmations done in Egypt by Presbyters, but of
consecrating the Eucharist in cases of Episcopal absence, or commission I
shall give account in the Question of Jurisdiction; that was indeed permitted
in Egypt, and some other places, but Confirmation never, that we can find else
where, and this is too improbable to bear weight against evidence and practice
Apostolical, and four Counsels, and 16 ancient Catholic Fathers, testifying
that it was a practice and a Law of Christendom that Bishops only should
confirm, and not Priests, so that if there be no other scruple, this Question
is quickly at an end.

* * But S. Gregory is also pretended in objection; for he gave dispensation to
the Priests of Sardinia, vt baptizatos Vguant, to aneale baptized lib. 3. eist
p. 26.
people. Now anointing the forehead of the baptized person, was one of the
solemnityes of confirmation, so that this indulgence does arise to a power of
Confirming; for Vnctio and Chrismatio in the first Arausican Council, and
since that time Sacramentum Chrismatis has been the usual word for
confirmation. But this will not much trouble the buisinesse.

Because it is evident that he means it not of confirmation, but of the
Chrisme in those times by the rites of the Church used in baptism. For in his
9th Epistle he forbids Priests to anoint baptized people, now here is precept
against precept, therefore it must be understood of several anoyntings, and so
S. Gregory expounds himself in this 9th Epistle, Presbyteri baptizatos
infantes signare bis in front Chrismate non praesumant. Presbyters may not
anoint baptized people twice, oncethey might; now that this permission of
anointing was that which was a ceremony of baptism, not an act of
confirmation, we shall see by comparing it with other Canons. * In the
collection of the Oriental Canons by Martinus Bracarensis, It is decreed thus,
[Presbyter Can. 52.
praesente Episcopo non SIGNET infantes, nisi forte ab Episcopo fuerit illi
praeceptum. A Priest must not sign infantes without leave of the Bishop if he
be present. Must not sign them] that is with Chrisme in their foreheads, and
that in baptism; for the circumstant Canons do expressly explicate, and
determine it; for they are concerning the rites of baptism, and this in the
midst of them. And by the way this may answer S. Ambrose his [Presbyteri
consignant absente Episcopo] in case it be so to be read; for here we see a
consignation permitted to the presbyters in the Eastern Churches to be used in
baptism, in the absence of the Bishop, and this an act of indulgence and
favor, and therefore extraordinary, and of use to S. Ambrose his purpose of
advancing the Presbyters, but yet of no objection in case of confimation. * And
indeed [Consignari] is used in Antiquity for any signing with the Cross, and
anealing. Thus it is used in the first Arausican Council for extreme Unction,
which is there in case of extreme necessity permitted to Presbyters:
Haereticos Can. 2.
in mortis discrimine positos, Si Catholici esse desiderent, si desit Episcopus
a Presbyteris came Chrismate, and benedictione CONSIGNARI placet. Consigned is
the word, and it was clearly in extreme Unction, for that rite was not then
ceased, and it was in anealing a dying body, and a part of reconciliation, and
so limited by the sequent Canon and not to be fancyed of any other
consignation. But I return. *** The first Council of Toledo prohibites Can.
20.
any from making Chrisme, but Bishops only, and takes order, ut de singulis
Ecclesiis ad Episcopum ante diem Paschae Diaconi destinentur, ut confectum
Chrisma ab Episcopo destinatum ad diem Paschae possit occurrere; that the
Chrisme be fetched by the Deacons from the Bishop to be used in all Churches.
But for what use? why, it was destinatum ad diem Paschae says the Canon,
against the Holy time of Easter, and then, at Easter was the solemnity of
public baptismes, so that it was to be used in baptism. And this sense being
premised, the Canon permits to Presbyters to sign with Chrisme, the same thing
that S. Gregory did to the Priests of Sardinia. Statutum vero est, Diaconum non
Chrismare, sed Presbyterum absente Episcopo, praesente vero, si ab ipso fuerit
praeceptum. Now although this be evident enough, yet it is something clearer in
the first Arausican Council, Nullus ministrorum qui BAPTIZANDI recipit
officium sine Chrismate usquam debet Can. 1.
progredi, quia inter nos placuit semel in baptismate Chrismari. The case is
evident that Chrismation or Consigning with ointment was used in baptism, and
it is as evident that this Chrismation was it which S. Gregory permitted to the
Presbyters, not the other, for he expressly forbad the other and the exigence
of the Canons, and practice of the Church expound it so, and it is the same
which S. Innocent the first decreed in more express and distinctive terms,
Presbyteris Chrismate baptizatos ungere licet, sed quod ab Episcopo fuerit
Consecratum; Epist. 1. ad Decent. Cap. 3.
there is a clear permission of consigning with Chrisme in baptism, but he
subjoynes a prohibition to Priests for doing it in confirmation; non tamen
frontem eodem oleo signare, quod solis debetur Episcopis cum tradunt Spiritum
Sanctum Paracletum.

By the way; some, that they might the more clearly determine S. Gregory's
dispensation to be only in baptismall Chrisme, read it, [Vt baptizandos ungant]
not [baptizatos] so Gratian, so S. Thomas, but it is needless to be troubled
with that, for Innocentius in the decretall now quoted uses the word
[Baptizatos] and yet clearly distinguishes this power from the giving the
Chrisme in Confirmation.

I know no other objection, and these we see hinder not but that having such
evidence of fact in Scripture of confirmations done only by Apostles, and this
evidence urged by the Fathers for the practice of the Church, and the power of
cofirmation by many Counsels, and Fathers appropriated to Bishops, and denied
to Presbyters, and in this they are not only Doctors teaching their own
opinion, but witnesses of a Catholic practice, and do actually attest it as
done by a Catholic consent; and no one example in all antiquity ever produced
of any Priest that did, no law that a Priest might impose hands for
confirmation; we may conclude it to be a power Apostolical in the Original,
Episcopal in the Succession, and that in this power, the order of a Bishop is
higher then that of a Presbyter, and so declared by this instance of Catholic
Practice.

THus far I hope we are right. But I call to 34. And jurisdiction,
mind, that in the Nosotrophium of the old Philosopher that undertook to cure
all Calentures by Bathing his Patients in water; some were up to the Chin, some
to the Middle, some to the Knees; So it is amongst the enemies of the Sacred
Order of Episcopacy; some endure not the Name, and they indeed deserve to be
over head and ears; some will have them all one in office with Presbyters, as
at first they were in Name; and they had need bath up to the Chinne; but some
stand shallower, and grant a little distinction, a precedence perhaps for order
sake, but no pre-eminence in reiglement, no superiority of Jurisdiction; Others
by all means would be thought to be quite thorough in behalf of Bishops
order, and power such as it is, but call for a reduction to the primitive
state, and would have all Bishops like the Primitive, but because by this
means they think to impair their power, they may well endure to be up to the
ankles, their error indeed is less, and their pretense fairer, but the use
they make of it, of very ill consequence. But curing the mistake will quickly
cure this distemper, That then shall be the present issue, that in the
Primitive Church Bishops had more power, and greater exercise of absolute
jurisdiction, then now Men will endure to be granted, or then themselves are
very forward to challenge.

1. Then; The Primitive Church expressing Which they expressed in attributes of
authority, and great power,
the calling and offices of a Bishop, did it in terms of presidency and
authority. Episcopus typum Dei Patris omnium gerit, says S. Ignatius; The
Bishop carries the representment of God the Father, that is, in power and
authority to be sure, (for how else:) so as to be the supreme in suo ordine, in
offices Ecclesiastical. And again, Quid enim aliud est Episcopus quam is
quiomni Prineipatu, and potestate superior Epist. ad Trallian.
est? Here his superiority and advantage is expressed to be in his power; A
Bishop is greater and higher then all other power, viz: in materia, or gradu
religionis. And in his Epistle to the Magnesians; Hortor ut hoc sit omnibus
studium in Dei concordia omnia agere EPISCOPO PRESIDENTE LOCO DEI. Do all
things in Unity, the Bishop being PRESIDENT IN THE PLACE OF GOD. President in
all things. And with a fuller tide yet, in his Epistle to the Church of Smyrna,
Honora Episcopum ut PRINCIPEM SACERDOTUM imaginem Dei referentem, Dei quidem
propter Principatum, Christi vero propter Sacerdotium. It is full of fine
expression both for Eminency of order, and Jurisdiction. The Bishop is the
PRINCE OF THE PRIESTS bearring the image of God for his Principality (that is
his jurisdiction and power) but of Christ himself for his Priesthood, (that is
his Order.) S. Ignatius has spoken fairly, and if we consider that he was so
primitive a man that himself saw Christ in the flesh, and lived a man of
exemplary sanctity, and dyed a Martyr, and has been honored as holy Catholic
by all posterity, certainly these testimonies must needs be of Great pressure,
being Sententiae repetiti dogmatis, not casually slipped from him, and by
incogitancy, but resolutely and frequently.

But this is attested by the general expressions of after ages. Fungaris circa
eum POTESTATE HONORIS tui, says S. Cyprian to Bishop Rogatianus. Execute lib.
3. epist. 9.
the POWER OF THY DIGNITY upon the refractary Deacon; And VIGOR EPISCOPALIS,
and AUTHORITAS CATHEDRae are the the words expressive of that power whatsoever
it be which S. Cyprian calls upon him to assert, in the same Epistle. This is
high enough. So is that which he presently subjoynes, calling the Bishops power
Ecclesiae gubernandae sublimem ac divinam potestatem, a high and a divine power
and authority in regiment of the Church. * Locus Magisterij traditus ab

Alexandria, Scribit ad Fabianum lib. 2. adv. Parmen.

The Fathers of the Council of Constantinople in Trullo ordayn'd that the
Bishops dispossessed of their Churches by encroachments of Barbarous people
upon the Church's pale, so as the Bishop had in effect no Diocese, yet they
should enjoy (...) the authority of their PRESIDENCY according to their proper
state; their appropriate presidency. And the same Council calls the Bishop
(...) the PRELATE or PREFECT of the Church; I know not how to expound it
better. But it is something more full in the Greeks Council of Carthage
Commanding that the convert Can. 69.
Donatists should be received according to the will and pleasure of the Bishop,
(...), that GOVERNES the Church in that place. * And in the Council of Antioch
(...), Can. 25.

Romanae Ecclesiae Sylvester retinacula gubernabat. S. Sylvester [the Bishop]
held the Reins or the stearne of the Roman Church, says Theodoret. hist:
tripart: lib. 1. cap. 12.


But the instances of this kind are infinite, two may be as good as twenty, and
these they are. The first is of S. Ambrose; HONOR, and SUBLIMITAS Episcopalis
de dignit. sacerdot. c. 2.
nullis poterit comparationibus adaequari. The HONOR and SUBLIMITY of the
Episcopal Order is beyond all comparison great. And their commission he
specifyes to be in Pasce oves meas; Vnde regendae Sacerdotibus contraduntur,
merito RECTORIBUS suis subdi dicuntur etc: The sheep are delivered to Bishops,
as to RULERS and are made their Subjects; And in the next chapter, Haec vero
cuncta, Fratres, Cap. 3.
ideo nos praemisisse cognoscere debetis, vt ostenderemus nihil esse in hoc
saeculo excellentius Sacerdotibus, nihil SUBLIMIUS EPISCOPIS reperiri vt cum
dignitatem Episcopatus Episcoporum oraculis demonstramus, and digne noscamus
quid sumus....action potius, quam Nomine demonstremus. These things I have
said that you may know nothing is higher, nothing more excellent then the
DIGNITY, AND EMINENCE OF A BISHOP, andC. * The other is of S. Hierome, CURA
TOTIUS ECCLESIAE AD EPISCOPUM PERTINET, The care of the whole Church
appertains to the Bishop. But more confidently spoken is that in his dialogue
adversus Luciferianos; Ecclesiae salus in SUMMI SACERDOTIS DIGNITATE pendet,
cuisi non exors quaedam and ab Cap. 4.
omnibus EMINENS DETUR POTESTAS, tot in Ecclesiis efficientur schismata, quot
Sacerdotes, The safety of the Church consists in the DIGNITY OF A BISHOP, to
whom unless an EMINENT and UNPARALLELED POWER be given by all, there will be
as many Schisms as Priests.

Here is dignity, and authority, and power enough expressed; and if words be
expressive of things, (and there is no other use of the^) then the Bishop is
SUPERIOR IN A PEERLESS, AND INCOMPARABLE AUTHORITY, and all the whole
Diocese are his subjects, viz: in regimine Spirituali.

BUT from words let us pass to things. For the 35. Requiring Universal
obedience to be given to Bishops by Clergy and Laity.
Faith and practice of Christendom requires obedience, Universal obedience,
to be given to Bishops. I will begin again with Ignatius, that these men who
call for reduction of Episcopacy to Primitive consistence, may see what they
gain by it, for the more primitive the testimonies are, the greater exaction
of obedience to Bishops; for it happened in this, as in all other things; at
first, Christians were more devout more pursuing of their duties, more zealous
in attestation of every particle of their faith; and that Episcopacy is now
come to so low an ebb, it is nothing, but that it being a great part of
Christianity to honor, and obey them, it has the fate of all other parts of
our Religion, and particularly of Charity, come to so low a declension, as it
can scarce stand alone; and faith, which shall scarce be found upon earth at
the coming of the Son of Man.

But to our business.

S. Ignatius in his epistle to the Church of Trallis, Necesse itaque est (says
he) quicquid facitis, ut sine EPISCOPO NIHIL TENTETIS. So the Latin of
Vedelius, which I the rather choose, because I am willing to give all the
advantage I can. It is necessary (says the good Martyr) that whatsoever ye
do, you should attempt nothing without your BISHOP. And to the Magnesians,
Decet itaque vos obedire EPISCOPO, ET IN NULLO ILLI REFRAGARI. It is sitting
that ye should obey your BISHOP, and in NOTHING to be refractory to him. Here
is both a Decet, and a Necesse est, already. It is very fitting, it is
necessary. But if it be possible, we have a fuller expression yet, in the same
Epistle; Quemadmodum enim Dominus sine Patre nihil facit, nec enim possum
facere a me ipso quicquam: sic and vos SINE EPISCOPO, nec Presbyter, nec
Diaconus, nec Laicus. Nec QUICQUAM videatur VOEIS CONSENTANEUM quod sit PRAETER
ILLIUs IUDICIUM, quod enim tale est, iniquum est, and Deo inimicum. Here is
obedience Universal, both in respect of things, and persons; and all this no
less then absolutely necessary. For as Christ obeyed his Father in all things,
saying, of my self I can do nothing: so nor you without your BISHOP; whoever
you be, whether Priest, or Deacon, or Layman. Let nothing please you, which
the Bishop mislikes, for all such things are wicked, and in enmity with God. *
But it seems S. Ignatius was mightily in love with this precept, for he gives
it to almost all the Churches he writes to. We have already reckoned the
Trallians, and the Magnesians. But the same he gives to the Priests of Tarsias,
(...). Ye Presbyters be subject to your Bishop. The same to the Philadelphians.
Sine EPISCOPO nihil facite, Do nothing without your BISHOP. But this is better
explicated in his Epistle to the Church of Smyrna. Sine EPISCOPO NEMO QUICQUAM
FACIAT eorum quae ad Ecclesiam spectant. No man may do ANY THING WITHOUT THE
BISHOP, viz. of those things which belong to the Church. So that this saying
expounds all the rest, for this universal obedience is to be understood
according to the sense of the Church, viz. to be in all things of
Ecclesiastical cognizance, all Church affairs. And therefore he gives a
charge to S. Polycarpe their Bishop; that he also look to it, that nothing be
done without his leave. Nihil sine TUO ARBITRIO agatur, nec item tu quicquam
praeter Dei facies voluntatem. As thou must do nothing against Gods will, so
let nothing (in the Church) be done without thine. By the way, observe, he
says not, that as the Presbytery must do nothing without the Bishop, so the
Bishop nothing without them; But, so the Bishop nothing without God. But so it
is. Nothing must BE DONE without the Bishop; And therefore although he
incourages them that can, to remain in Virginity, yet this, if it be either
done with pride, or without the Bishop, it is spoiled. For, si gloriatus
fuerit, periit, and si id ipsum statuatur SINE EPISCOPO, corruptum est. His
last dictate in this Epistle to S. Polycarpe, is with an [Episcopo attendite,
sicut and Deus vobis] The way to have God to take care of us, is to observe our
Bishop. Hinc and vos decet accedere SENTENTIAE EPISCOPI, qui secundum Deum vos
pascit, quemadmodum Episl. ad Ephesians.
and facitis, edocti a spiritu; you must therefore conform to the sentence of
the BISHOP, as indeed ye do already, being taught so to do by Gods holy
Spirit.

There needs no more to be said in this cause, if the authority of so great a
man will bear so great a burden. What the man was, I said before: what these
Epistles are, and of what authority, let it rest upon Apologiae pro Ignatio.
Vedelius, a man who is no ways to be suspected as a party for Episcopacy, or
rather upon the credit of Lib. 3. hist. c. 30.
Eusebius, De Script. Eccles.
S. Hierome, and Apud Eusebquem Latin reddidit.
Ruffinus who reckon the first seven out of which I have taken these excerpta,
for natural and genuine. And now I will make this use of it; Those men that
call for reduction of Episcopacy to the Primitive state, should do well to
stand close to their principles, and count that the best Episcopacy which is
first; and then consider but what S. Ignatius has told us for direction in
this affair, and see what is gotten in the bargain. For my part, since they
that call for such a reduction hope to gain by it, and then would most
certainly have abidden by it, I think it not reasonable to abate any thing of
Ignatius his height, but expect such subordination and conformity to the Bishop
as he then knew to be a law of Christianity. But let this be remembered all
along, in the specification of the parts of their Jurisdiction. But as yet I am
in the general demonstration of obedience.

The Council of Laodicea having specified some Can. 56.
particular instances of subordination, and dependence to the Bishop, sums
them up thus, Idem videre est apud Damasum. Epist. de Chorepiscopis.
(...). So likewise the Presbyters let them do nothing without the precept and
counsel of the Bishop, so is the translation of Isidore, ad verbum. This
Council is ancient enough, for it was before the first Nicene. So also was
that of Arles commanding the same thing exactly. * Vt Presbyteri sine
conscientia Episcoporum Can. 19.
nihil faciant. Sed nec Presbyteris civitatis sine Episcopi praecepto amplius
aliquid imperare, vel sine authoritate literarum ejus in Vnaquaque parochia
aliquid agere, says the thirteenth Canon of the Ancyran Council according to
the Latin of Isidore. The same thing is in the first Council of Toledo, the
very Can. 20.
same words for which I cited the first Council of Arles, viz. That Presbyters
do nothing without the knowledge or permission of the Bishop. * Esto SUBIECTUS
Epist. ad Nepotian.
PONTIFICI Tuo, and quasi animae parentemsuscipe. It is the counsel of S.
Hierome. Be subject to thy Bishop and receive him as the Father of thy soul.

I shall not need to derive hither any more particular instances of the duty,
and obedience owing from the Laity to the Bishop. For this account will
certainly be admitted by all considering men. God has entrusted the souls of
the Laity to the care of the Ecclesiastical orders; they therefore are to
submit to the government of the Clergy in matters Spiritual with which they
are entrusted. For either there is no Government at all, or the Laity must
govern the Church, or else the Clergy must. To say there is no Government, is
to leave the Church in worse condition then a tyranny. To say that the Laity
should govern the Church, when all Ecclesiastical Ministeries are committed
to the Clergy, is to say, Scripture means not what it says; for it is to say,
that the Clergy must be Praepositi, and (...), and praelati, and yet the
prelation, and presidency, and rule is in them who are not ever by Gods spirit
called Presidents or Prelates, and that it is not in them who are called so. *
In the mean time if the Laity in matters Spiritual are inferior to the Clergy,
and must in things pertaining to the Soul be ruled by them, with whom their
Souls are entrusted; then also much rather they must obey those of the Clergy,
to whom all the other Clergy themselves are bound to be obedient. Now since by
the frequent precept of so many Counsels, and Fathers, the Deacons and
Presbyters must submit in all things to the Bishop, much more must the Laity,
and since the Bishop must rule in chief, and the Presbyters at the most can
but rule in conjunction, and assistance, but ever in subordination to the
Bishop, the Laity must obey de integro. For that is to keep them in that state,
in which God has placed them.

But for the maine, S. Clement in his Epistle to S. James translated by
Ruffinus, says it was the doctrine of Peter, according to the institution of
Christ, that Presbyters should be obedient to their Bishop in all things; and
in his third Epistle; that Presbyters, and Deacons and others of the Clergy
must take heed that they do nothing without the license of the Bishop. * And
to make this business up complete, all these authorities of great antiquity,
were not the prime constitutions in those several Churches respectively, but
mere derivations from tradition Apostolical, for not only the thing, but the
words so often mentioned are in the 40th Canon of the Apostles. (...) (the same
is repeated in the twenty fourth Canon of the Council of Antioch) (...).
Presbyters and Deacons must do nothing without leave of the Bishop, for to him
the Lords people is committed, and he must give an account for their souls. *
And if a Presbyter shall contemn his own Bishop making conventions apart, and
erecting another altar, he is to be deposed, (...) (says the 32. Canon) as a
lover of Principality: intimating, that he arrogates Episcopal dignity, and so
is ambitious of a Principality. The issue then is this. * The Presbyters, and
Clergy, and Laity must obey, therefore the Bishop must govern and give them
laws. It was particularly instanced in the case of S. Chrysostom, (...) says
Theodoret, He adorned, and instructed Pontus with these Laws, so he, reckoning
up the extent Lib. 5. cap. 28.
of his jurisdiction.

* But now descend we to a specification of the power and jurisdiction * of
Bishops.

36. Appointing them to be Judges of the Clergy and spiritual causes of the
Laity.
THe Bishops were Ecclesiastical Judges over the Presbyters, the inferior
Clergy and the Laity. What they were in Scripture who were constituted in
presidency over causes spiritual, I have already twice explicated; and from
hence it descended by a close succession that they who watched for souls they
had the rule over them, and because no regiment can be without coercion,
therefore there was inherent in them a power of cognition of causes, and
coercion of persons. * The Canons of the Apostles appointing censures to be
inflicted on delinquent person's makes the Bishop's hand to do it. (...). Can.
33.
If any Presbyter or Deacon be excommunicated BY THE BISHOP he must not be
received by any else, but by him that did so censure him, unless the BISHOP
THAT CENSURED HIM be dead. The same is repeated in the Nicene Council; only it
is Can. 5.
permitted that any one may appeal to a Synod of BISHOPS, si forte aliqua
indignatione, aut contentione aut qualibet commotione Episcopi sui,
excommunicati sint, if he thinks himself wronged by prejudice or passion; and
when the Synod is met, hujusmodi examinent Quaestiones. But by the way it must
be Synodus Episcoporum, so the Canon; ut ita demum hi qui ob culpas suas
EPISCOPORUM SUORUM OFFENSAS merito contraxerunt digne etiam a caeteris
excommunicati habeantur, quousque in communi, vel IPSI EPISCOPO SUO UISUM
FUERIT humaniorum circa eos far sententiam. The Synod of Bishops must ratify
the excommunication of all those who for their delinquencies have justly
incurred the displeasure of their Bishop, and this censure to stick upon them
till either the Synod, or their own Bishop shall give a more gentle sentence.
* * This Canon we see, relates to the Canon of the Apostles, and affixes the
judicature of Priests, and Deacons to the Bishops: commanding their censures to
be held as firm and valid; only as the Apostles Canon names Presbyters, and
Deacons particularly; so the Nicene Canon speaks indefinitely and so
comprehends all of the Diocese and jurisdiction.

The fourth Council of Carthage gives in express terms the cognizance of
Clergy-causes to the Bishop, Can. 59.
calling aid from a Synod in case a Clergyman prove refractary, and
disobedient. Discordantes Clericos Episcopus vel ratione, vel potestate ad
concordiam trahat, inobedientes Synodus per audientiam damnet. If the Bishops
reason will not end the controversies of Clergymen, his power must; but if any
man list to be contentious, intimating (as I suppose out of the Nicene
Council) with frivolous appeals, and impertinent protraction, the Synod [of
Bishops] must condemn him, viz. for his disobeying his Bishops sentence. * The
Council of Antioch is yet more particular in it is Sanction for this affayre,
intimating a clear distinction of proceeding in the causes of a Bishop, and
the other of Priests, and Deacons. (...) Can. 4.
etc. If a Bishop shall be deposed by a Synod (viz. of Bishops, according to
the exigence of the Nicene Canon) or a PRIEST, OR DEACON BY HIS OWN BISHOP, if
he meddles with any Sacred offices he shall be hopeless of absolution. But
here we see that the ordinary Judge of a Bishop is a Synod of Bishops; but of
Priests and Deacons the Bishop alone: And the sentence of the Bishop is made
firm omnimodo in the next Canon; Si quis Presbyter, vel Diaconus proprio
contempto Episcopo.... privatim congregationem effecerit, and altar erexerit,
and Episcopo accersente non obedierit nec velit ei parere, nec morem gerere
primo and secundo vocanti, hic damnetur omni modo..... Quod si Ecclesiam
conturbare, and sollicitare persistat tanquam seditiosus per potestates exter
as opprimatur. What Presbyter soever refuses to obey his Bishop and will not
appear at his first, or second Summons, let him be deposed, and if he shall
persist to disturb the Church, let him be given over to the secular powers. *
Add to this the first Canon of the same Council, (...) etc: If any one be
excommunicate by his own Bishop etc: as it is in the foregoing Canons of Nice
and the Apostles. The Result of these Sanctions is this. The Bishop is the
Judge: the Bishop is to inflict censures; the Presbyters, and Deacons are
either to obey, or to be deposed: No greater evidence in the world of a
Superior jurisdiction, and this established by all the power they had; and
this did extend, not only to the Clergy, but to the Laity; for that is the close
of the Canon, (...). This constitution is concerning the Laity, and the
Presbyters, and the Deacons, and all that are within the rule, viz: that if
their Bishop have sequestered them from the holy Communion, they must not be
suffered to communicate elsewhere.

But the AUDIENTIA EPISCOPALIS, The Bishops Audience-Court is of larger power
in the Council of Chalcedon, (...). Can. 9.
If any Clergy man have any cause against a Clergy man, let him by no means
leave his own Bishop and run to SECULAR COURTS, (...). But first let the
cause be examined before their own BISHOP, or by the BISHOPS LEAVE before such
persons as the contesting parties shall desire. (...). Whosoever does otherwise
let him suffer under the censures of the Church. Here is not only a
subordination of the Clergy in matters criminal, but also the civil causes of
the Clergy must be submitted to the Bishop, under pain of the Canon. * I end
this with the at estation of the Council of Sardis, exactly of the same
Spirit, the same injunction, and almost the same words with the former Canons.
Hosius the President said; If any Deacon, or Priest, or Can. 13. and 14.
of the inferior Clergy being excommunicated shall go to another Bishop
(...), knowing him to be excommunicated by his own BISHOP, that other Bishop,
must by no means receive him into his communion.

Thus far we have matter of public right, and authority declaring the Bishop
to be the Ordinary Judge of the causes, and persons of Clergy men; and have
power of inflicting censures both upon the Clergy, and the Laity. And if there
be any weight in the concurrent testimony of the Apostolical Canons, of the
General Counsels of Nice, and of Chalcedon, of the Counsels of Antioch, of
Sardis, of Carthage; then it is evident, that the Bishop is the Ordinary Judge
in all matters of Spiritual cognizance, and has power of censures, and
therefore a Superiority of jurisdiction.

This thing only by the way; in all these Canons there is no mention made of
any Presbyters assistant with the Bishop in his Courts. For though I doubt not
but the Presbyters were in some Churches, and in sometimes (...), and (...) as
S. Ignatius calls them; counselors and assessors with the Bishop; yet the
power, and the right of inflicting censures is only expressed to be in the
Bishop, and no concurrent jurisdiction mentioned in the Presbytery: but of this
hereafter more particularly.

* Now we may see these Canons attested by practice, and dogmaticall
resolution. S. Cyprian is the man whom I would choose in all the world to
depose in this cause; because he, if any man, has given all dues to the
College of Presbyters: and yet if he reserves the Superiority of jurisdiction
to the Bishop, and that absolutely, and independently of conjunction with the
Presbytery, we are all well enough, and without suspicion. * Diu patientiam
meam tenui (Fratres Charissimi) says he, writing Epist. 10.
to the Presbyters and Deacons of his Church. He was angry with them for
admitting the lapsi without his consent; and though he was as willing as any
man to comply both with the Clergy, and people of his Diocese, yet he also
must assert his own privileges, and peculiar. Quod enim non periculum metuere
debemus de offensa Domini, quando aliqui de Presbyteris nec Evangelij nec loci
sui memores, sed neque futurum Domini judicium, neque nunc praepositum sibi
Episcopum cogitantes, quod nunquam omnino sub antecessoribus factum est ut cum
co^tumelia and contemptu Praepositi totum sibi vendicent. The matter was, that
certain Presbyters had reconciled them that fell in persecution without the
performance of penance according to the severity of the Canon; and this was
done without the Bishops leave, by the Presbyters [Forgetting their own place
and the GOSPEL and their BISHOP set over them] a thing that was never heard
of, till that time. Totum sibi vendicabant, They that might do nothing without
the Bishops leave, yet did this whole affair of their own heads. Well! Upon
this S. Cyprian himself, by his own authority alone, suspends them till his
return, and so shows that his authority was independent, theirs was not, and
then promises they shall have a fair hearing before him, in the presence of
the Confessors, and all the people. Vtar ea admonitione qua me vti Dominus
jubet, ut interim prohibeantur offerre, acturi and apud nos, and apud
Confessores ipsos, and apud plebem Vniversam causam suam. * Here it is plain
that S. Cyprian suspended these Presbyters, by his own authority, in absence
from his Church, and reserved the further hearing of the cause till it should
please God to restore him to his See.

But this fault of the Presbyters S. Cyprian in the two next Epistles does
still more exaggerate; saying, they ought to have asked the Bishops leave,
Sicut in praeteritum semper sub antecessoribus factum est, for so was the
Catholic custom ever, that nothing should be done without the Bishops leave;
but now by doing otherwise they did prevaricate the divine commandment, and
dishonor the Bishop. Yea, Epist. 11.
but the Confessors interceeded for the lapsi, and they seldom were
discountenanced in their requests. What should the Presbyters do in this case?
S. Cyprian tells them, writing to the Confessors. Petitiones itaque and
desideria vestra EPISCOPO servent. Let them ketpe your petitions for the BISHOP
to consider of. But they did not, therefore he suspended Epist. 12.
them, because they did not reservare Episcopo honorem Sacerdotij sui, and
cathedrae; Preserve the honor of the Bishops chair, and the Episcopal
authority in presuming to reconcile the penitents without the Bishops leave.

The same S. Cyprian in his Epistle to Rogatianus Epist. 65.
resolves this affayre; for when a contemptuous bold Deacon had abused his
Bishop, he complained to S. Cyprian who was an Archbishop, and indeed S.
Cyprian tells him he did honor him in the business that he would complain to
him, cum pro EPISCOPATUS VIGORE, and CATHEDRAE AUTHORITATE haberes potestatem
qua posses de illo statim vindicari; When as he had power Episcopal and
sufficient authority himself to have punished the Deacon for his petulancy.
The whole Epistle is very pertinent to this Question, and is clear evidence
for the great authority of Episcopal jurisdiction, the sum whereof is in
this encouragement given to Rogatianus by S. Cyprian; Fungaris circa eum
POTESTATE HONORIS TUI, ut eum vel deponas, vel abstineas. Exercise the power of
your honor upon him, and either suspend him, or depose him. * And therefore he
commends Cornelius the Bishop of Rome for driving Felicissimus the Schismatic
from Epist. 55.
the Church* vigore pleno quo Episcopum agere oportet, with full authority, as
becomes a Bishop.

Socrates telling of the promotion, and qualities of S. John Chrysostom,
says, that in reforming the lives of the Clergy, he was too fastuous and
severe. Mox Tripart. hist. lib. 10. cap. 3.
igitur in ipso initio quum Clericis asper videretur Ecclesiae, erat plurimis
exosus, and veluti furiosum universi declinabant. He was so rigid in
animadversions against the Clergy, that he was hated by them; which clearly
shows that the Bishop had jurisdiction, and authority over them; for tyranny
is the excess of power, and authority is the subject matter of rigor, and
austerity. But this power was intimated in that bold speech of his Deacon
Serapio, nunquam poteris, o Episcope, hos corrigere, nisi uno baculo
percusseris Vniversos. Thou can not amend the Clergy unless thou strikest
them all with thy Pastoral rod. S. John Chrysostom did not indeed do so; but
non multum post temporis plurimos clericorum pro diversis exemit causis. He
deprived, and suspended most of the Clergy men for diverse causes: and for this
his severity he wanted no slanders against him; for the delinquent Ministers
set the people on work against him.

* But here we see that the power of censures was clearly, and only in the
Bishop, for he was incited to have punished all his Clergy, [Vniversos;] And he
did actually suspend most of them, [plurimos:] and I think it will not be
believed the Presbytery of his Church should join with their Bishop to supend
themselves. Add to this that Theodoret Ibid. cap. 4.
also affirms that Chrysostom entreated the Priests to live Canonically
according to the sanctions of the Church, quas quicunque praevaricari
praesumerent eos ad templum prohibebat accedere, ALL them that transgressed the
Canons he forbad them entrance into the Church.

*** Thus S. Hierome to Riparius, Miror sanctum Advers. Vigilant. Epist. 53.
Episcopum, in cujus Parochia esse Presbyter dicitur, acquiescere furori ejus,
and non virga APOSTOLICA, virgaque ferrea confringere vas inutile, and tradere
in interitum carnis, ut spiritus salvus fiat. I wonder (says he) that the holy
Bishop is not moved at the fury of Vigilantius, and does not break him with
his APOSTOLICAL rod, that by this temporary punishment his soul might be
saved in the day of the Lord.

* Hither to the Bishops Pastoral staff is of fair power and coercion.

The Council of Aquileia convoked against the Arians, is full and mighty in
asserting the Bishops power over the Laity, and did actually exercise censures
upon the Clergy, where S. Ambrose was the Man that gave sentence against
Palladius the Arian. Palladius would have declined the judgment of the
Bishops, for he saw he should certainly be condemned and would feign have been
judged by some honorable personages of the Laity. But S. Ambrose said,
Sacerdotes de Laicis judicare debent, non Laici de Sacerdotibus. Bishops must
judge of the Laity, not the Laity of Bishops. That Is for the jus; and for the
factum it was the shutting up of the Council; S. Ambrose Bishop of Millaine
gave sentence [Pronuncio illum indignum Sacerdotio, and carendum, and in loco
ejus Catholicus ordinetur.] * The same also was the case of Marcellus Bishop of
Ancyra in Galatia whom for heresy the Bishops at Constantinople deposed,
Eusebius giving sentence, and chose Basilius in his Tripart. hist. lib. 3. cap.
9.
Room.

* But their Grandfather was served no better. Alexander Bishop of Alexandria
served him neither better nor worse. So Theodoret. Alexander Tripart. hist.
lib. 1. c. 12.
autem Apostolicorum dogmatum praedicator, prius quidem revocare eum
admonitionibus, and consilijs n^tebatur. Cum vero eum superbire vidisset, and
aperte impietatis facinora praedicare, ex ordine Sacerdotali removit. The
Bishop first admonished the heretic, but when to his false doctrine he added
pertinacy he deprived him of the execution of his Priestly function.

This crime indeed deserved it highly. It was for a less matter that Triferius
the Bishop excommunicated Exuperantius a Presbyter, viz. for a personal
misdemeanour, and yet this censure was ratified by the Council of Taurinum,
and his restitution was Can. 4. Ann. Dom. 397.
left arbitrio Episcopi, to the good will and pleasure of the Bishop who had
censured him. Statuit quoque de Exuperantio Presbytero sancta Synodus, qui ad
injuriam sancti Episcopi sui Triferii gravia and multa congesserat, and
frequentibus eum contumeliis provocaverat.... propter quam causam ab eo fuerat
Dominica communione privatus, ut in ejus sit arbitrio restitutio ipsius, in
cujus potestate ejus fuit abjectio. His restitution was therefore left in his
power, because originally his censure was. * The like was in the case of
Palladius a Laick in the same Council, qui a Triferio Sacerdote fuerat
mulctatus, who was punished by Triferius the Bishop; hoc ei humanitate Concilii
reservato, ut ipse Triferius in potestate habeat, quando voluerit eirelaxare.

Here is the Bishop censuring Palladius the Laick, and excommunicating
Exuperantius the Priest, and this having been done by his own sole authority
was ratified by the Council, and the absolution reserved to the Bishop too,
which indeed was an act of favor; for they having complained to the Council,
by the Council might have been absolved, but they were pleased to reserve to
the Bishop his own power.

These are particular instances, and made public by acts conciliary
intervening. But it was the General Canon and Law of H Church.

Thus we have it expressed in the Council of Agatho. Cap. 2.
Contumaces vero Clerici prout dignitatis ordo permiserit ab Episcopis
corrigantur. Refractary Clerks must be punished by their Bishops, according as
the order of their dignity allows. I end this particular with some Canons
commanding Clerks to submit to the judgment and censures of their Bishop,
under a Canonical penalty; and so go on ad alia.

In the second Council of Carthage, Alypius Episcopus Ca. 8.
dixit, nec illud praetermittendum est, ut si quis forte Presbyter ab Episcopo
suo correptus, aut excommunicatus, rumore vel superbia inflatus, putaverit
separatim Deosacrificia offerenda, vel aliud erigendum altar contra
Ecclesiasticam fidem disciplinamque crediderit, non exeat impunitus. And the
same is repeated in the Greek Code of the African Canons. If any Presbyter
being excommunicated, or Can. 10.
otherwise punished by his Bishop, shall not desist, but contest with his
Bishop, let him by no means go unpunished. * The like is in the Council of
Chalcedon, Act. 4. can. 83.
the words are the same that I before cited out of the Canons of the Council
of Antioch, and of the Apostles. But Carosus the Archimandrite spoke home in
that action. (...). Post epist. Archimandritarum ad Concilium pro Dioscori
rehabilitatione.
The faith of the 318 Fathers of the Council of Nice into which I was baptized
I know, Other faith I know not. They are Bishops; They have power to
excommunicate and condemn, and they have power to do what they please: other
faith then this I know none.

* This is to purpose, and it was in one of the four great Counsels of
Christendom which all ages since have received, with all veneration and devout
estimate.

Another of them was that of Ephesus convened Council. Ephesians. c. 5.
against Nestorius, and this ratifies those acts of condemnation which the
Bishops had passed upon delinquent Clerks. (...) etc. They who are for their
unworthy practices condemned by the Synod or by their OWN BISHOPS; although
Nestorius did endeavor to restore them, yet their condemnation should still
remain vigorous and confirmed. Upon which Canon Balsamon makes this
observation, which indeed of it self is clear enough in the Canon. (...).
Hence you have learned that Metropolitans and Bishops can judge their Clergy,
and suspend them, and sometimes depose them. Nay, they are bound to it,
Pastoralis tamen necessitas habet (ne per plures serpant dira contagia)
separare ab ovibus sanis morbidam. It is necessary that the BISHOP should
separate the scabbed sheep from the sound, least their infection scatter, so S.
Austin. Can. 55.
And therefore Cap. 15. de corrept. and gratia.
the fourth Council of Can. 55.
Carthage commands, ut Episcopus accusatores Fratrum excommunicet, That the
Bishop excommunicate the accuser of their Brethren (viz. such as bring
Clergy-causes and Catholic doctrine, to be punished in secular tribunalls;)
For Excommunication is called by the Fathers Mucro Episcopalis, the Bishops
sword to cut offenders off from the Catholic communion. I add no more but
that excellent saying of S. Austin, which does freely attest both the
preceptive, ubi supra. cap. 3.
and vindictive power of the Bishop over his whole Diocese. Ergo praecipiant
tantummodo nobis quid facere debeamus qui nobis praesunt, and faciamus orent
pro nobis, non autem nos corripiant, and arguant, si non fecerimus. Imo omnia
fiant, quoniam Doctores Ecclesiarum Apostoli omnia faciebant, and praecipiebant
quae fierent, and corripiebant si non fierent etc. And again; Corripiantur
itaque a praepositis suis subditi correptionibus de charitate venientibus pro
culparum, Cap. 15 ibid.
diversitate diversis, vel minoribus, vel amplioribus, quia and ipsa quae
damnatio nominatur quam facit Episcopale judicium, qua poena in Ecclesia nulla
major est, potest, si Deus voluerit, in correptionem saluberrimam cedere, atque
proficere. Here the Bishops have a power acknowledged in them to command their
Diocese, and to punish the disobedient, and of excommunication by way of
proper Ministry, [damnatio quam facit Episcopale judicium] a condemnation of
the Bishops infliction.

Thus it is evident by the constant practice of Primitive Christendom, by the
Canons of three General Counsels, and diverse other Provincial, which are
made Catholic by adoption, and inserting them into the Code of the Catholic
Church, that the Bishop was Judge of his Clergy, and of the Lay People of his
Diocese; that he had power to inflict censures upon them in case of
delinquency; that his censures were firm and valid; and as yet we find no
Presbyters joining either in commission, or fact; in power, or exercise: but
excommunication and censures to be appropriated to Bishops and to be only
dispatched by them, either in full Council, if it was a Bishops cause, or in
his own Consistory, if it was the cause of a Priest, or the inferior Clergy, or
a Laick, unless in cases of appeal; and then it was in pleno Concilio
Episcoporum, in a Synod of Bishops; And all this was confirmed by secular
authority, as appears in the Imperial Constitutions. Novel. constit. 123. c.
11.


For the making up this Paragraph complete, I must insert two considerations.
First concerning universality of causes within the Bishops cognizance. And
secondly of Persons.

The Ancient Canons asserting the Bishops power in Cognitione causarum speak
in most large, and comprehensive terms. (...). They have power to do what
they list. Their power is as large as their will. So the Council of Chalcedon
before cited. It was no larger though, then S. Paul's expression, [for to this
end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be
obedient 2. Corinthians. 2. 9.
IN ALL THINGS.] A large extent of power when the Apostles expected an
Universal obedience. (...). And so the style of the Church run in
descention, (...), so Ignatius, ye must do NOTHING without your BISHOP, (...),
to contradict him in NOTHING. Vbi supra.
The expression is frequent in him, (...), to comprehend all things in his
judgment, or cognizance, so the Council of Antioch. Ca. 9.


* But these Universal expressions must be understood secundum Materiam
subjectam, so S. Ignatius expresses himself. Ye must without your Bishop do
nothing; nothing (...), of things pertaining to the Church. So also the
Council of Antioch, (...), The things of the Church, are (...) committed to
the Bishop to whom all the people is entrusted. They are Ecclesiastical
persons, it is an Ecclesiastical power they are endowed with, it is for a
spiritual end, viz. the regiment of the Church, and the good of souls, and
therefore only those things which are in this order are of Episcopal
cognizance. And what things are those:

1. Then, it is certain that since Christ has professed, his Kingdom is not
of this world, that government which he has constituted de novo does no way in
the world make any intrenchment upon the Royalty.

Host is Herodes impie
Christum venire quid times?
Non eripit mortalia
Qui regna dat Coelestia.
So the Church used to sing. Whatsoever therefore the secular tribunal did
take cognizance of before it was Christian, the same it takes notice of after
it is Christ'ned. And these are; all actions civil, all public violations of
justice, all breach of Municipall laws. These the Church has nothing to do
with, unless by the favor of Princes and commonwealths it be indulged to
them in honorem Dei and S. Matris Ecclesiae; but then when it is once indulged,
that act which does annull such pious vows, is just contrary to that religion
which first gave them, and then unless there was sin in the donative, the
ablation of it is contra honorem Dei and S. Matris Ecclesiae. But this it may
be is impertinent.

2. The Bishops ALL, comes in after this; And he is judge of all those causes
which Christianity has brought in upon a new stock, by it is new distinctive
Principles. I say, by it is new Principles; for there where it extends justice,
and pursues the laws of nature, there the secular tribunal is also extended
if it be Christian; The Bishop gets nothing of that: But those things which
Christianity (as it prescinds from the interest of the republike) has
introduced all them, and all the causes emergent from them the Bishop is judge
of. Such are causes of faith, Ministration of Sacraments, and Sacramentals,
subordination of inferior Clergy to their Superior, censures, irregularities,
Orders hierarchicall, rites and ceremonies, liturgyes, and public forms of
prayer, (as is famous in the Ancient story of Ignatius teaching his Church the
first use of Antiphona's and Doxologyes, tripart. hist. lib. 10. cap. 9.
and thence was derived to all Churches of Christendom) and all such things as
are in immediate dependence of these, as dispensation of Church Vessels, and
Ornaments, and Goods, receiving and disposing the Patrimony of the Church, and
whatsoever is of the same consideration, according to the 41 Canon of the
Apostles. Praecipimus ut in potestate sua Episcopus Ecclesiae res habeat. Let
the Bishop have the disposing the goods of the Church; adding this reason. Si
enim animae hominum pretiosae illi sint creditae, multo magis eum oportet curam
pecuniarum gerere. He that is entrusted with our precious souls, may much more
be entrusted with the offertoryes of faithful people.

3. There are somethings of a mixed nature; and something of the secular
interest, and something of the Ecclesiastical concur to their constitution,
and these are of double cognizance: the secular power, and the Ecclesiastical
do both in their several capacities take knowledge of them. Such are the
delinquencyes of Clergymen, who are both Clergy, and subjects too; Clerus
Domini, and Regis subditi; and for their delinquencyes which are in materia
justitiae the secular tribunal punishes as being a violation of that right
which the State must defend, but because done by a person who is a member of
the sacred hierarchy, and has also an obligation of special duty to his
Bishop, therefore the Bishop also may punish him; And when the commonwealth
has inflected a penalty, the Bishop also may impose a censure, for every sin
of a Clergyman is two. But of this nature also are the convening of Synods,
the power whereof is in the King, and in the Bishop severally, insomuch as both
the Church and the commonwealth in their several respects have peculiar
interest; The commonwealth for preservation of peace and charity, in which
religion has the deepest interest; and the Church, for the maintenance of
faith. And therefore both Prince and Bishop have indicted Synods in several
ages, upon the exigence of several occasions, and have several powers for the
engagement of Clericall obedience, and attendance upon such solemnities.

4. Because Christianity is after the commonwealth, and is a capacity
superadded to it, therefore those things which are of mixed cognizance are
chiefly in the King; The Supremacy here is his, and so it is in all things of
this nature, which are called [Ecclesiasticall] because they are in materia
Ecclesiae, ad finem religionis, but they are of a different nature, and use
from things [Spirituall] because they are not issues of those things which
Christianity has introduced de integro, and are separate from the interest of
the commonwealth in it is particular capacity, for such things only, are
properly spiritual.

5. The Bishops jurisdiction has a compulsory derived from Christ only, viz.
infliction of censures by excommunications, or other minores plagae which are
in order to it. But yet this internal compulsory through the duty of good
Princes to God, and their favor to the Church, is assisted by thesecular arm,
either superadding a temporal penalty in case of contumacy, or some other way
abetting the censures of the Church, and it ever was so since commonwealths
were Christian. So that ever since then, Episcopal Jurisdiction has a double
part; an external, and an internal; this is derived from Christ, that from
the King, which because it is concurrent in all acts of Jurisdiction, therefore
it is, that the King is supreme of the Jurisdiction, viz. that part of it which
is the external compulsory.

* And for this cause we shall sometimes see the Emperor, or his Prefect, or
any man of consular dignity sit Judge when the Question is of Faith, not that
the Prefect was to Judge of that, or that the Bishops were not; But in case of
the pervicacy of a peevish heretic who would not submitt to the power of the
Church, but flew to the secular power for assistance, hoping by taking
sanctuary there, to engage the favor of the Prince: In this case the Bishops
also appealed thither, not for resolution, but assistance, and sustentation of
the Church's power.

* It was so in the case of Aetius the Arian, and Honoratus the Prefect,
Constantius being Emperor. For, all that the Prefect did, or the Emperor in
this case, Tripart. hist. lib. 5. c. 35.
was by the prevalency of his intervening authority to reconcile the
disagreeing parties, and to encourage the Catholics; but the precise act of
Judicature even in this case was in the Bishops, for they deposed Aetius for
his heresy, for all his confident appeal, and Macedonius, Eleusius, Basilius,
Ortasius, and Dracontius for personal delinquencyes. * And all this is but to
reconcile this act to the resolution, and assertion of S. Ambrose, who refused
to be tried in a cause of faith by Lay-Iudges, though Delegates of the
Emperor. Quando audisti (Clementissime Imperator S. Ambros. Epist. lib. 2.
Epist. 13.
) in causa fidei Laicos de Episcopo judicasse? When was it ever known that
Laymen in a cause of Faith did judge a Bishop? To be sure, it was not in the
case of Honoratus the Prefect; for if they had appealed to him, or to his
Master Constantius for judgment of the Article, and not for encouragement and
secular assistance, S. Ambrose his confident Question of [Quando audisti?] had
quickly been answered, even with saying; presently after the Council of
Ariminum in the case of Aetius, and Honoratus.

* Nay it was one of the causes why S. Ambrose deposed Palladius in the
Council of Aquileia, because he refused to answer, except it were before some
honorable personages of the Laity. And it is observeable that the Arians were
the first (and indeed they offered at it often) that did desire Princes to
judge matters of faith, for they despayring of their cause in a Conciliary
trial, hoped to engage the Emperor on their party, by making him Umpire. But
the Catholic Bishops made humble, and fair remonstrance of the distinction of
powers, and Jurisdictions; and as they might not entrench upon the Royalty, so
neither betray that right which Christ concredited to them to the incroachment
of an exterior jurisdiction and power. It is a good story that Suidas tells of
Leontius Bishop of Tripolis in Lydia, In verbo (...).
a man so famous and exemplary, that he was called (...), the rule of the
Church that when Constantius the Emperor did preside amongst the Bishops, and
undertook to determine causes of mere spiritual cognizance, instead of a
Placet, he gave this answer, (...). I wonder that thou being set over things of
a different nature, medlest with those things that only appertain to Bishops.
The MILITIA, and the POLITIA are thine, but matters of FAITH, and SPIRIT, are
of EPISCOPAL cognizance. (...). Such was the freedom of the ingenuous
Leontius. Answerable to which, was that Christian and fair acknowledgement of
Valentinian when the Arian Bishops of Bithynia and the Hellespont sent
Hypatianus their legate to desire him, ut dignaretur ad emendationem dogmatis
interesse, that he would be pleased to mend the Article. Respondens
Valentinianus, ait, Mihi quidem quum vnus de populo sim fas non est talia
perscrutari. Verum Sacerdotes apud se ipsos congregentur vbi voluerint. Cumque
haet respondisset Princeps in Lampsacum convenerunt Episcopi. So Sozomen
reports the story. The Emperor would not meddle with matters of faith, but
hist. tripart. lib. 7. c. 12.
referred the deliberation, and decision of them to the Bishops to whom by
God's law they did appertain; Upon which intimation given, the Bishops
convened in Lampsacum. And thus a double power met in the Bishops. A divine
right to decide the article. Mihi fas non est, (says the Emperor) it is not
lawful for me to meddle; And then a right from the Emperor to assemble, for
he gave them leave to call a Council. These are two distinct powers, One from
Christ, the other from the Prince. ***

And now upon this occasion, I have fair opportunity to insert a
consideration, The Bishops have power over all causes emergent in their
diocesses; all, (I mean) in the sense above explicated; they have power to
inflict censures, excommunication is the highest, the rest are parts of it, and
in order to it. Whether or no must Church Censures be used in all such causes
as they take cognizance of, or may not the secular power find out some
external compulsory instead of it, and forbid the Church to use
excommunication, in certain cases?

1. To this, I answer, that if they be such cases in which by the law of Christ
they may, or such in which they must use excommunication, then, in these cases
no power can forbid them. For what power Christ has given them, no man can
take away.

2. As no humane power can disrobe the Church of the power of excommunication;
so no humane power can invest the Church with a lay Compulsory. For if the
Church be not capable of a jus gladij, as most certainly she is not, the
Church cannot receive power to put men to death, or to inflict lesser pains in
order to it, or any thing above a salutary penance; I mean in the formality of
a Church-tribunall, then they give the Church what she must not, cannot take.
I deny not but Clergy men are as capable of the power of life and death, as any
men; but not in the formality of Clergymen. A Court of life and death, cannot
be an Ecclesiastical tribunal; and then if any man, or company of Men should
persuade the Church not to inflict her censures upon delinquents, in some cases
in which she might lawfully inflict them, and pretend to give her another
compulsory; they take away the Church-consistory, and erect a very secular
Court, dependant on themselves, and by consequence to be appealed to from
themselves, and so also to be prohibited as the Lay-Superiour shall see cause
for. * Whoever therefore should be consenting to any such permutation of power,
is traditor potestatis quam S. Matter Ecclesia a sponso suo acceperat, he
betrays the individual, and inseparable right of holy Church. For her
censures she may inflict upon her delinquent children without asking leave.
Christ is her (...) for that, he is her warrant and security. The other is
begged, or borrowed, none of her own, nor of a fit edge to be used in her
abscissions, and coercions. * I end this consideration with that memorable
Canon of the Apostles of Can. 39.
so frequent use in this Question, (...). Let the Bishop have the care or
provision for all affairs of the Church, and let him dispense them velut Deo
contemplante as in the sight of God, to whom he must be responsive for all his
Diocese.

The next Consideration concerning the Bishop's jurisdiction is of what persons
he is Judge? And because our Scene lies herein Church-practice I shall only set
down the doctrine of the Primitive Church in this affair, and leave it under
that representation.

Presbyters, and Deacons, and inferior Clerks, and the Laity are already
involved in the precedent Canons; No man there, was exempted of whose soul any
Bishop had charge. And all Christ's sheep hear his voice, and the call of his
sheap-heard-Ministers. * Theodoret tells a story that when the Bishops of the
Province were assembled by the command of Valentinian the Emperor for the
choice of a Successor to Auxentius in the Sea of Millayne, the Emperor wished
them to be careful in the choice of a Bishop, in these words, (...).
Theodoret. lib. 4. c. 5.
Set such an one in the Archiepiscopall throne, that we who rule the Kingdom
may sincerely submitt our head unto him, viz: in matters of spiritual import.
* And since all power is derived from Christ, who is a King, and a Priest, and
a Prophet, Christian Kings are Christi Domini, and Vicars in his Regal power,
but Bishops in his Sacerdotall, and Prophetical. * So that the King has a
Supreme Regal power in causes of the Church, ever since his Kingdom became
Christian, and it consists in all things, in which the Priestly office is not
precisely by Gods law employed for regiment, and cure of souls, and in these
also, all the external compulsory and jurisdiction in his own. For when his
Subjects became Christian Subjects, himself also upon the same terms becomes
a Christian Ruler, and in both capacities he is to rule, viz: both as Subjects,
and as Christian Subjects, except only in the precise issues of Sacerdotall
authority. And therefore the Kingdom, and the Priesthood are excelled by each
other in their several capacities. For superiority is usually expressed in
three words, (...), and (...), Excellency, Impery, and Power. The King is
supreme to the Bishop in Impery; The Bishop has an Excellency, viz. of
Spiritual Ministration which Christ has not concredited to the King; but in
Power, both King, and Bishop have it distinctly in several capacity; the King
in potentia gladii, the Bishop in potestate clavium. The Sword, and the Keys
are the emblems of their distinct power. Something like this is in the third
Epistle of S. Clement translated by Ruffinus. Quid enim in praesenti saeculo
prophet a gloriosius, Pontifice clarius, Rege sublimius? King, and Priest, and
Prophet, are in their several excellencies, the Highest powers under heaven.
*** In this sense it is easy to understand those expressions often used in
Antiquity, which might seem to make intrenchment upon the sacredness of Royal
prerogatives; were not both the piety, and sense of the Church sufficiently
clear in the issues of her humblest obedience. * And this is the sense of S.
Ignatius that holy Martyr, and Epist. ad Philadelph.
disciple of the Apostles: Diaconi, and reliquus Clerus, una cum populo
Vniverso, Militibus, Principibus, and Caesare, ipsi Episcopopareant. Let the
Deacons and all the Clergy, and all the people, the Soldiers, the Princes, and
Caesar himself obey the Bishop. * This is it, which S. Ambrose said;
Sublimitas Episcopalis Lib. de dignit. Sacerd, cap. 2.
nullis poterit comparationibus adaequari. Si Regum fulgori compares, and
Principum diademati, erit inferius etc. This also was acknowledged by the great
Constantine, that most blessed Prince, Deus vos constituit Sacerdotes, and
potestatem vobis dedit, de nobis quoque judicandi, and ideo nos a vobis recte
judicamur. Vos autem non potest is ab hominibus judicari, [viz. saecularibus,
and incausis simplicis religionis.] So that good Emperor in his oration to
Lib. 10. Eccles hist. c. 2.
the Nicene Fathers.

It was a famous contestation that S. Ambrose had with Auxentius the Arian
pretending the Emperors command to him to deliver up some certain Churches in
his Diocese to the Arians. His answer was, that Palaces belonged to the
Emperor, but Churches to the Bishop; and so they did, by all the laws of
Christendom. The like was in the case of S. Athanasius, and Constantius the
Emperor, exactly the same per omniae, as it is related by Ruffinus. * S.
Ambrose his sending his Deacon to the Emperor, Lib. 10. Eccles hist. cap. 19.
to desire him to go forth of the Cancelli, in his Church at Millain, shows
that then the powers were so distinct, that they made no intrenchment upon each
other. * It was no greater power, but a more considerable act, and higher
exercise, the forbidding the communion to Theodosius, till he had Theodor. lib.
5 c. 18.
by repentance, washed out the blood that stuck upon him ever since the
Massacre at Thessalonica. It was a wonderful concurrence of piety in the
Emperor, and resolution and authority in the Bishop. But he was not the first
that did it; For Philip the Emperor was also guided by the Pastoral rod, and
the severity of the Bishop. De hoc traditum est nobis, Eusebius lib. 6. cap. 25.
quod Christianus fuerit, and in die Paschae, i. e. in ipsis vigiliis cum
interesse voluerit, and communicare mysteriis, ab Episcopo loci non prius esse
permissum, nisi confiteretur peccata, and inter poenitentes staret, nec ullo
modo sibi copiam mysteriorum futuram nisi prius per poenitentiam, culpas quae
de eo ferebantur plurimae, deluisset. The Bishop of the place would not let him
communicate till he had washed away his sins by repentance. And the Emperor
did so. Ferunt igitur libenter eum quod a Sacerdote imperatum fuer at,
suscepisse. He did it willingly, undertaking the impositions laid upon him by
the Bishop.

I doubt not but all the world believes the dispensation of the Sacraments
entirely to belong to Ecclesiastical Ministry. It was S. Chrysostomes command
Homil. 83. in 26. Matthew.
to his Presbyters, to reject all wicked persons from the holy Communion. If he
be a Captain, a Consul, or a Crowned King that comes unworthily, forbid him
and keep him off, thy power is greater then his. If thou dare not remove him,
tell it me, I will not suffer it, etc. And had there never been more error in
the managing Churchcensures, then in the foregoing instances, the Church might
have exercised censures, and all the parts of power that Christ gave her,
without either scandal or danger to her self, or her penitents. But when in
the very censure of excommunication there is a new ingredient put, a great
proportion of secular inconveniences, and humane interest, when
excommunications, as in the Apostles times they were deliverings over to Satan,
so now, shall be deliverings over to a foreign enemy, or the peoples rage; as
then, to be buffeted, so now to be deposed, or disinterest in the allegiance of
subjects; in these cases, excommunication being nothing like that which Christ
authorized, and no way cooperating toward the end of its institution, but to an
end of private designs, and rebellious interest, Bishops have no power of such
censures, nor is it lawful to inflict the^, things remaining in that
consistence, and capacity. And thus is that famous saying to be understood
reported by S. Thomas to be S. Austin's, In 3. partis Supplem. q. 22 a. 5. Vide
Aug. ep. 75. and Gratian. did. 24. q. 2. c. Sihabet. sed ibi [Princeps] non
inseritur, sed tantum in glossa ordinaria.
but is indeed found in the Ordinary Gloss upon Matthew. 13. Princeps and
multitudo non est excommunicanda. A Prince or a Common wealth are not to be
excommunicate.

Thus I have given a short account of the Persons, and causes of which Bishops
according to Catholic practice did, and might take cognizance. This use only I
make of it. Although Christ has given great authority to his Church in order
to the regiment of souls, such a power, quae nullis poterit comparationibus
adaequari, yet it has its limits, and a proper cognizance, viz. things
spiritual, and the emergencies, and consequents from those things which
Christianity has introduced de novo, and superadded, as things totally
disparate from the precise interest of the Commonwealth; And this I the rather
noted, to show how those men would mend themselves that cry down the tyranny
(as they list to call it) of Episcopacy, and yet call for the Presbytery. ***
For the Presbytery does challenge cognizance of all causes whatsoever, which
are either sins directly, or by reduction. * [All crimes which Vide the book
of Order of Excomm. in Scotland. and the Hist. of Scotland. Admonit. 2. p. 46.
Knox his exhortation to England.
by the Law of God deserve death.] There they bring in Murders, Treasons,
Witchcrafts, Felonies. Then the Minor faults they bring in under the title of
[Scandalous and offensive] Nay [Quodvis peccatum,] says Snecanus, to which if
we add this consideration, that they believe every action of any man to have
in it the malignity of a damnable sin, there is nothing in the world, good or
bad, vicious or suspicious; scandalous, or criminal; true, or imaginary; real
actions, or personal, in all which, and in all contestations, and complaints
one party is delinquent, either by false accusation, or real injury; but they
comprehend in their vast gripe, and then they have power to nullify all Courts,
and judicatories, besides their own: and being, for this their cognizance they
pretend Divine institution, there shall be no causes IMPERFECT in their
Consistory, no appeal from them, but they shall hear, and determine with
final resolution, and it will be sin, and therefore punishable, to complain
of injustice and illegality. * If this be confronted but with the pretenses of
Episcopacy, and the Modesty of their several demands, and the reasonableness,
and divinity of each vindication examined, I suppose, were there nothing but
Prudentiall motives to be put into balance to weigh down this Question, the
cause would soon be determined, and the little finger of Presbytery, not only
in it is exemplary, and tried practices, but in its dogmaticall pretensions, is
heavier then the loins, nay then the whole body of Episcopacy; but it seldom
happens otherwise, but that they who usurp a power, prove tyrants in the
execution, whereas the issues of a lawful power are fair and moderate.

BUT I must proceed to the more particular instances 37. Forbidding Presbyters
to officiate without Episcopal license,
of Episcopal Jurisdiction. The whole power of Ministration both of the Word
and Sacraments was in the Bishop by prime authority, and in the Presbyters by
commission and delegation, insomuch that they might not exercise any ordinary
ministration without license from the Bishop. They had power and capacity by
their order to Preach, to Minister, to Offer, to Reconcile, and to Baptize.
They were indeed acts of order, but that they might not by the law of the
Church exercise any of these acts, without license from the Bishop, that is an
act or issue of jurisdiction, and shows the superiority of the Bishop over his
Presbyters, by the practice of Christendom.

S. Ignatius has done very good offices in all the parts of this Question, and
here also he brings in succor. (...). Epist. ad Smyrn.
It is not lawful without the Bishop (viz. without his leave) either to
baptize, or to offer Sacrifice, or to make oblation, or to keep feasts of
charity: and a little before; speaking of the B. Eucharist, and its
ministration, and having premised a general interdict for doing any thing
without the Bishops consent, (...). But let that Eucharist (says he) be held
valid which is celebrated under the Bishop, or under him, to whom the Bishop
shall permit. ***

* I do not here dispute the matter of right, and whether or no the Presbyters
might de jure do any offices without Episcopal license, but whether or no de
facto it was permitted them in the primitive Church? This is sufficient to
show, to what issue the reduction of Episcopacy to a primitive consistence will
drive; and if I mistake not, it is at least a very probable determination of
the question of right too. For who will imagine that Bishops should at the
first in the calenture of their infant devotion, in the new spring of
Christianity, in the times of persecution, in all the public disadvantages of
state and fortune, when they anchored only upon the shore of a Holy Conscience,
that then they should have thoughts ambitious, incroaching, of usurpation and
advantages, of purpose to divest their Brethren of an authority entrusted them
by Christ, and then too when all the advantage of their honor did only set
them upon a hill to feel a stronger blast of persecution, and was not, as
since it has been, attested with secular assistance, and fair arguments of
honor, but was only in a mere spiritual estimate, and ten thousand real
disadvantages. This will not be supposed either of wise or holy men. But
however. Valeat quantum valere potest. The question is now of matter of fact,
and if the Church of Martyrs, and the Church of Saints, and Doctors, and
Confessors now regnant in heaven, be fair precedents for practices of
Christianity, we build upon a rock, though we had dug no deeper then this
foundation of Catholic practice.

Upon the hopes of these advantages, I proceed. (...). Can. Apost. 32
If any Presbyter disrespecting his own Bishop shall make conventions apart, or
erect an altar (viz. without the Bishops license) let him be deposed; clearly
intimating that potestas faciendi concionem, the power of making of
Church-meetings and assemblies, for preaching or other offices is derived from
the Bishop; and therefore the Canon adds (...). He is a lover of Rule, he is a
Tyrant, that is, an usurper of that power and government which belongs to the
Bishop. The same thing is also decreed in the Council of Antioch, and in the
Council of Chalcedon, (...), Ca. 5. Act. 4.
All the most Reverend Bishops cried out, this is a righteous law, this is the
Canon of the holy Fathers. [This] viz. The Canon Apostolical now cited. *
Tertullian is something De baptism.
more particular, and instances in Baptism. Dandi baptismum jus habet summus
Sacerdos, qui est Episcopus. Dehinc Presbyteri and Diaconi, non tamen sine
Episcopi authoritate, propter honorem Ecclesiae, quo salvo salva pax est;
alioquin etiam Laicis jus est. The place is of great consideration, and carries
in it its own objection and its answer. The Bishop has the right of giving
baptism. Then after him, Presbyters and Deacons, but not without the authority
of the Bishop.(So far the testimony is clear) and this is for the honor of
the Church. * But does not this intimate it was only by positive constitution,
and neither by Divine nor Apostolical ordinance? No indeed. It does not. For
it might be so ordained by Christ or his Apostles propter honorem Ecclesiae;
and no harm done. For it is honorable for the Church, that her Ministrations
should be most ordinate, and so they are when they descend from the superior to
the subordinate. But the next words do of themselves make answer, [Otherwise
laymen have right to baptize] That is, without the consent of the Bishop
Laymen can do it as much as Presbyters and Deacons. For indeed baptism
conferred by Laymen is valid and not to be repeated, but yet they ought not
to administer it, so neither ought Presbyters without the Bishops license: so
says Tertullian, let him answer it. Only the difference is this, Laymen
cannot jure ordinario receive a leave or commission to make it lawful in them
to baptize any; Presbyters and Deacons may, for their order is a capacity or
possibility. * * But besides the Sacrament of Baptism, Tertullian affirms De
corona milit. c. 3. vide S. Chrysostom. hom. 11. in 1. Tim. and S. Hieron. dial.
adv. Lucifer.
the same of the venerable Eucharist. Eucharistiae Sacramentum non de aliorum
manu quam Praesidentium sumimus. The former place will expound this, if there
be any scruple in [Praesidentium] for clearly the Christians receive the
Sacrament of the Eucharist from none but Bishops. I suppose he means [without
Episcopal license.] whatsoever his meaning is, these are his words.

The Council of Gangra, forbidding conventicles, Can. 6.
expresses it with this intimation of Episcopal authority. If any man shall
make assemblies privately, and out of the Church, so despising the Church, or
shall do any Church-offices (...), without the presence of a Priest by THE
DECREE OF A BISHOP, let him be anathema. The Priest is not to be assistant at
any meeting for private offices without the Bishops license. If they will
celebrate Synaxes privately, it must be by a Priest, and he must be there by
leave of the Bishop, and then the assembly is lawful.

* And this thing was so known, that the Fathers of the second Council of
Carthage call it ignorance or hypocrisy in Priests to do their offices without
a Ca. 9.
license from the Bishop. Numidius Episcopus Massilytanus dixit, In quibusdam
locis sunt Presbyteri qui aut ignorantes simpliciter, aut dissimulantes
audacter, praesente, and inconsulto Episcopo complurimis in domicilijs agunt
agenda, quod disciplinae incongruum cognoscit esse Sanctitas vestra. In some
places there are Priests that in private houses do offices (houseling of
people is the office meant, communicating them at home) without the consent or
leave of the Bishop, being either simply ignorant, or boldly dissembling;
Implying, that they could not else but know their duties to be, to procure
Episcopal license for their ministrations. Ab Vniversis Episcopis dictum est.
Quisquis Presbyter inconsulto Episcopo agenda in quolibet loco voluerit
celebrare, ipse honroi suo contrarius existit. All the Bishops said, if any
Priest without leave of his Bishop shall celebrate the mysteries, be the place
what it will be, he is an Enemy to the Bishops dignity.

After this in time, but before in authority is the great Council of
Chalcedon. (...). Can. 8. part. 2. Act. 14.
Let the Clergy according to the tradition of the Fathers, remain under the
power of the Bishops of the City. So that they are for their offices in
dependence of the authority of the Bishop. The Canon instances particularly to
Priests officiating in Monasteries and Hospitalls, but extends it self to an
indefinite expression (...), They must not dissent or differ from their Bishop.
(...) etc: All they that transgress this Constitution in ANY WAY, not
submitting to their Bishop, let them be punished canonically. So that now these
general expressions of obedience and subordination to the Bishop being to be
Understood according to the exigence of the matter, to wit, the Ministeries of
the Clergy in their several offices, the Canon extends it is prohibition to all
ministrations without the Bishops authority.

But it was more clearly and evidently law and practice in the Roman Church,
we have good witness for it; S. Leo the Bishop of that Church is my author.
Sed neque coram Episcopo licet Presbyter is in baptisterium introire, nec
praesente Antistite infantem Epist. 86.
tingere, aut fignare, nec poenitentem sine praeceptione Episcopi sui
reconciliare, nec eo praesente nisi illo jubente Sacramentum corporis and
Sanguinis Christi conficere, nec eo coram posito populum docere, vel benedicere
etc. It is not lawful for the Presbyters to enter into the baptistery, nor to
baptize any Catechumens, nor to consecrate the Sacrament of Christ's body and
blood in the presence of the Bishop without his command. From this place of S.
Leo, if it be set in conjunction with the precedent, we have fair evidence of
this whole particular. It is not lawful to do any offices without the Bishops
leave; So S. Ignatius, so the Canons of the Apostles, so Tertullian, so the
Counsels of Antioch and Chalcedon. It is not lawful to do any offices in the
Bishops presence without leave, so S. Leo. The Council of Carthage joins them
both together, neither in his presence, nor without his leave in any place.

Now against this practice of the Church, if any man should discourse as S.
Hierome is pretended to do by Gratian, Qui non vult Presbyteros facere quae
jubentur a Deo, dicat quis major est Christo. He did. 95. cap. Ecce ego.
that will not let Presbyters do what they are commanded to do by God, let
him tell us if any man be greater then Christ, viz: whose command it is, that
Presbyters should preach. Why then did the Church require the Bishop's leave?
might not Presbyters do their duty without a license? This is it which the
practice of the Church is abundantly sufficient to answer. * For to the Bishop
is committed the care of the whole diocese, he it is that must give the
highest account for the whole charge, he it is who is appointed by peculiar
designation to feed the flock, so the Canon of the Can. 40.
Apostles, so Epist. ad Ephesians.
Ignatius, so the Council of Cap. 24.
Antioch, so every where; The Presbyters are admitted in partem sollicitudinis,
but still the jurisdiction of the whole Diocese is in the Bishop, and without
the Bishop's admission to a part of it per traditionem subditorum, although the
Presbyter by his ordination have a capacity of preaching and administering
Sacraments, yet he cannot exercise this without designation of a particular
charge either temporary or fixed. And therefore it is, that a Presbyter may not
do these acts without the Bishops leave, because they are actions of relation,
and suppose a congregation to whom they must be administered, or some particular
person; for a Priest must not preach to the stones as some say Venerable Bede
did, nor communicate alone, the word is destructive of the thing, nor baptize
unless he have a Chrysome Child, or a Catechumen; So that all of the Diocese
being the Bishop's charge, the Bishop must either authorize the Priest, or the
Priest must not meddle, least he be (what S. Peter blamed) (...), a Bishop in
another Diocese: Not that the Bishop did license the acts precisely of
baptizing, of consecrating etc. For these he had by his ordination, but that in
giving license he did give him a subject to whom he might apply these relative
actions, and did quoad hoc take him in partem sollicitudinis and concredit some
part of his diocese to his administration cum cura animarum.

But then on the other side because the whole cure of the Diocese is in the
Bishop, he cannot exonerate himself of it, for it is a burden of Christ's
imposing, or it is not imposed at all, therefore this taking of Presbyters into
part of the regiment and care does not divest him of his own power, or any part
of it, nor yet ease him of his care, but that as he must still (...), visit and
see to his Diocese, so he has authority still in all parts of his Diocese,
and this appears in these places now quoted; insomuch as when the Bishop came
to any place, there the Vicaria of the Presbyters did cease. In praesentia
Majoris cessat potest as minoris. And, though because the Bishop could not do
all the Minor and daily offices of the Priesthood in every congregation of his
Diocese, therefore he appointed Priests severally to officiate, himself
looking to the Metropolis and the daughter Churches by a general supravision;
yet when the Bishop came into any place of his Diocese, there he being present
might do any office, because it was in his own charge, which he might
concredit to another, but not exonerate himself of it; And therefore praesente
Episcopo (says the Council of Carthage, and S. Leo) if the Bishop be present,
the Presbyter without leave might not officiate; For he had no subjects of his
own, but by trust and delegation, and this delegation was given him to supply
the Bishops absence, who could not simul omnibus interesse, but then, where he
was present, the cause of delegation ceasing, the jurisdiction also ceased, or
was at least absorpt in the greater, and so without leave might not be
exercised; like the stars which in the noon day have their own natural
light, as much as in the night, but appear not, shine not in the presence of
the Sun.

This perhaps will seem uncouth to those Presbyters, who (as the Council of
Carthage's expression is) are contrarii honori Episcopali; but yet if we keep
our selves in our own form, where God has placed us, and where we were in
the Primitive Church, we shall find all this to be sooth, and full of order.
For Consider. The elder the prohibition was, the more absolute and indefinite
it runs. [Without the Bishop it is not lawful to baptize, to consecrate] etc.
So Ignatius. The prohibition is without limit. But in descent of the Church it
runs, [praesente Episcopo] the Bishop being present they must not without
leave. The thing is all one, and a derivation from the same original, to wit,
the Universality of the Bishops Jurisdiction, but the reason of the difference
of expression is this. At first Presbyters were in Cities with the Bishop, and
no parishes at all concredited to them. The Bishops lived in Cities, the
Presbyters preached and offered (...) from house to house according as the
Bishop directed them. Here they had no ordinary charge, and therefore the first
prohibitions run indefinitely, they must not do any Clericall offices sine
Episcopo, unless the Bishop sends them. But then afterward when the Parishes
were distinct, and the Presbyters fixed upon ordinary charges, then it was
only, praesente Episcopo, if the Bishop was present, they might not officiate
without leave. For in his absence they might do it, I do not say without
leave, but I say they had leave given them, when the Bishop sent them to
officiate in a Village with ordinary or temporary residence; as it is to this
day, when the Bishop institutes to a particular charge, he also gives power hoc
ipso, of officiating in that place. So that at first when they did officiate in
places by temporary missions, then they were to have leave, but this license
was also temporary; but when they were fixed upon ordinary charges they might
not officiate without leave, but then they had an ordinary leave given them in
traditione sub ditorum, and that was done in subsidium Muneris Episcopalis,
because it was that part of the Bishops charge, which he could not personally
attend for execution of the Minor offices, and therefore concredited it to a
Presbyter, but if he was present, a new leave was necessary, because as the
power always was in the Bishop, so now the execution also did return to him
when he was there in person, himself if he listed, might officiate.

All this is excellently attested in the example of S. Austin, of whom
Possidonius in his life reports that being but a Presbyter, Valerius the Bishop
being a Greek borne, and not well spoken in the Latin tongue, and so unfit for
public orations, eidem Presbytero (viz. to Austin) potestatem dedit coram se
in Ecclesia Evangelium praedicandi, ac frequentissime tractandi contra USUM
quidem, and CONSUETUDINEM Africanarum Ecclesiarum. He gave leave to Austin then
but Presbyter, to preach in the Church, even while himself was present, indeed
against the USE and CUSTOM of the African Churches. And for this act of his he
suffered soundly in his report.

* For the case was thus. In all Africa ever since the first spring of the
Arian heresy, the Church had then suffered so much by the preaching of Arius
the Presbyter, that they made a Law not to suffer any Presbyter to preach at
all, at least in the Mother Church, and in the Bishops presence. (...) (says
Socrates.) Lib. 5. c. 22.
Thence came this Custom in the African Churches. But because Valerius saw S.
Austin so able, and himself for want of Latin so unfit, he gave leave to
Austin to preach before him, against the Custom of the African Churches. But
he adds this reason for his excuse too; it was not indeed the custom of
Africa, but it was of the Oriental Churches. For so Possidonius proceeds, sed
and ille vir venerabilis, ac providus, in orientalibus Ecclesiis id ex more
fieri sciens, in the Levant it was usual for Bishops to give Presbyters leave
to preach, dummodo factitaretur a Presbytero quod a se Episcopo impleri minime
posse cernebat, which determines us fully in the business. For this leave to
do offices was but there to be given where the Bishop himself could not
fulfill the offices, which shows the Presbyters in their several charges,
whether of temporary mission, or fixtt residence, to be but Delegates, and
Viears of the Bishop admitted in partem Sollicitudinis, to assist the Bishop in
his great charge of the whole Diocese.

Against this it is objected out of S. Hierome, and Ad (...) Narbon. did. 95.
can. Ecce ego.
it is recorded by Gratian, Ecce ego dico praesentibus Episcopis suis, atque
adstantibus in altari Presbyteros posse Sacramenta conficere. Behold, I say
that Presbyters may minister Sacraments in presence of the Bishop. So Gratian
quotes it indeed, but S. Hierome says the express contrary, unless we all
have false copies. For in S. Hierome it is not [Ecce ego dico] but [Nec ego
dico.] He does not say it is lawful for Presbyters to officiate in the
presence of their Bishop. Indeed S. Hierome is angry at Rusticus Bishop of
Narbona because he would not give leave to Presbyters to preach, nor to bless
etc. This, perhaps it was not well done, but this makes not against the former
discourse; for though it may be fit for the Bishop to give leave, the Church
requiring it still more and more in descent of ages, and multiplication of
Christians, and Parishes, yet it is clear that this is not to be done without
the Bishops leave, for it is for this very thing that S. Hierome disputes
against Rusticus, to show he did amiss, because he would not give his
Presbyters license. * And this he also reprehends in his epistle ad Nepotianum,
Pessimae consuetudinis est in quibusdam Ecclesiis tacere Presbyteros, and
praesentibus Episcopis non loqui. That Presbyters might not be suffered to
preach in presence of the Bishop, that was an ill custom, to wit, as things
then stood, and it was mended presently after, for Presbyters did preach in the
Bishops presence, but it was by license from their Ordinary. For so Possidonius
relates, that upon this act of Valerius before mentioned, Postea currente and
volante hujusmodi fama, bono praecedente exemplo, ACCEPTA AB EPISCOPIS
POTESTATE Presbyteri nonnulli coram Episcopis, populis tractare caeperunt
verbum Dei. By occasion of this precedent it came to pass, that some
Presbyters did preach to the people in the Bishops presence, having first
obtained faculty from the Bishop so to do. And a little after it became a
custom from a general faculty and dispensation indulged to them in the second
Council of Vase. Can. 12.
Now if this evidence of Church practice be not sufficient to reconcile us to
S. Hierome, let him then first be reconciled to himself, and then we are sure
to be helped. For in his dialogue against the Luciferians, his words are these,
Cui si non exors quaedam and ab omnibus eminens detur potest as, tot
efficientur Schismata quot sunt Sacerdotes. Inde venit ut sine Episcopi
missione neque Presbyter, neque Diaconus jus habeant baptizandi. Because the
Bishop has an eminent power, and this power is necessary, thence it comes that
neither Presbyter nor Deacon may so much as baptize without the Bishops leave.

** This whole discourse shows clearly not only the Bishops to be superior
in jurisdiction, but that they have sole jurisdiction, and the Presbyters only
in substitution and vicaridge.

** 38. Reserving Church goods to Episcopal dispensation,
Diverse other acts there are to attest the superiority of the Bishops
jurisdiction over Priests and Deacons, as, that all the goods of the Church
were in the Bishops sole disposing, and as at first they were laid at the
Apostles feet, so afterward, at the Bishops. So it is in the 41. Canon of the
Apostles, so it is in the Council of Gangra, and all the world are excluded
from intervening in the dispensation, without express delegation from the
Bishop, as appears in the seventh and eight Canons, and that under pain of an
anathema by the holy Council. * And therefore when in success of time, some
Patrons that had founded Churches and endowed them, thought that the
dispensation of those lands did not belong to the Bishop; of this the third
Council of Toledo complains, and makes remedy, An. Dom. 589.
commanding, ut omnia SECUNDUM CONSTITUTIONEM ANTIQUAM, ad Episcopi
ordinationem and potestatem pertineant. The same is reniewed in the fourth
Council of Toledo. Noverint autem Cap. 32.
conditores basilicarum in rebus quas eisdem Ecclesiis conferunt, nullam se
potestatem habere, SED IUXTA CANONUM INSTITUTA, sicut Ecclesiam, ita and dotem
ejus ad ordinationem Episcopi pertinere. These Counsels I produce not as
Judges, but as witnesses in the business, for they give concurrent testimony
that as the Church it self, so the dowry of it too did belong to the Bishops
disposition by the Ancient Canons. For so the third Council of Toledo calls
it, antiquam Constitutionem, and it self is almost 1100. years old, so that
still I am precisely within the bounds of the Primitive Church though it be
taken in a narrow sense. For so it was determined Can. 26. vide Zonaram in hunc
Canonem.
in the great Council of Chalcedon, commanding that the goods of the Church
should be dispensed by a Clergy steward, (...), Videatur Council. Carthag.
Graec. can. 36. 38. and 41. and Balsam. ibid. and apologia 2. Iustini Martyris.
according to the pleasure or sentence of the Bishop.

Add to this, that without the Bishop's dimissory letters Presbyters might not
go to another Diocese. So it is decreed in the fifteenth Canon of the
Apostles, under pain of suspension or deposition, 39. Forbidding Presbyters to
leave their own Diocese, or to travel without leave of the Bishop.
(...) is the censure; and that especially, (...), if he would not return when
his Bishop calls him. The same is renewed in the Council of Antioch, cap. 3.
and in the Council of Constantinople in Trullo, cap. 17. the censure there is,
(...) let him be deposed that shall without dimissory letters from his Bishop,
(...), fix himself in the Diocese of another Bishop. But with license of his
Bishop, he may. Sacerdotes, vel alii Clerici concessione suorum Episcoporum
possunt ad alias Ecclesias transmigrare. But this is frequently renewed Vide
Council. Epaun. c. 5. and venet. c. 10.
in many other Synodall decrees, these may suffice for this instance.

* But this not leaving the Diocese is not only meant of promotion in another
Church, but Clergy men might not travail from City to City, without the
Bishops license; which is not only an argument of his regiment in genere
politico, but extends it almost to a despotick; But so strict was the Primitive
Church in preserving the strict tie of duty, and Clericall subordination to
their Bishop. The Council of Laodicea commands a Priest, or Clergy Can. 41.
man (...), not to travail without Canonical, or dimissory letters. And who
are to grant these letters, is expressed in the next Canon which repeats the
same prohibition, Can. 42.
(...), a Priest or a Clerk must not travail without the command of his
Bishop; and this prohibition is inserted into the body of the Law, de
consecrat. did 5. can. non oportet, which puts in the clause of [Neque etiam
Laicum,] but this was beyond the Council. The same is in the Council of Can.
38.
Agatho. The Council of Can. 5.
Venice adds a ce^sure, that those Clerks should be like persons excommunicate
in all those places whither they went, without letters of license from their
Bishop. The same penalty is inflicted by the Council of Epaunum, Presbytero,
vel Diacono Can. 6.
sine Antistitis sui Epistolis ambulanti communionem nullus impendat. The first
Council of Tourayne in France, and the third Council of Orleans attest the
self same power in the Bishop, and duty in all his Clergy.

BUT a Coercitive authority makes not a complete 40. And the Bishop had power
to prefer which of his Clerks he pleased,
jurisdiction, unless it be also remunerative, and [the Princes of the Nations
are called (...) Benefactors] for it is but half a tie to indeare obedience,
when the Subject only fears quod prodesse non poterit, that which cannot
profit. And therefore the primitive Church, to make the Episcopal jurisdiction
up entire, gave power to the Bishop to present the Clerks of his Diocese to
the higher Orders and nearer degrees of approximation to himself, and the
Clerks might not refuse to be so promoted. Item placuit ut quicunque Clerici
vel Diaconi pro necessitatibus Ecclesiarnm non obtemperaverint EPISCOPIS SUIS
VOLENTIBUS EOS AD HONOREM AMPLIOREM IN SUA ECCLESIA PROMOVERE, nec illic
ministrent in gradu suo unde recedere noluerunt. So it is decreed in the
African Code, They that will not by their Bishop be promoted to a Greater
honor Can. 31.
in the Church, must not enjoy what they have already.

But it is a question of great consideration, and worth a strict inquiry, in
whom the right and power of electing Clerks was resident in the Primitive
Church: for the right and the power did not always go together, and also
several Orders had several manner of election; Presbyters and inferior Clergy
were chosen by the Bishop alone, the Bishop by a Synod of Bishops, or by their
Chapter; And lastly, because of late, strong outcries are made upon several
pretensions, amongst which the people make the biggest noise, though of all,
their title to election of Clerks be most empty, therefore let us consider it
upon all its grounds.

1. In the Acts of the Apostles, which are most certainly the best precedents
for all acts of holy Church we find that [Paul and Barnabas ordained Elders in
every Church] and [they passed thorough Lystra, Iconium, Antioch, and Derbe
(...), appointing them Elders. * S. Paul chose Timothy Bishop of Ephesus, and
he says of himself and Titus, [For this cause I SENT thee to Crete, (...),
that thou should oppoint Presbyters, or Bishops (be they which they will) in
every City]. The word (...), signifies that the whole action was his. For that
he ordained them no man questions, but he also APPOINTED THEM, and that was,
says S. Paul, (...), 1. Titus. V: 5.
as I commanded thee. It was therefore an Apostolical ordinance, that the
BISHOP SHOULD APPOINT PRESBYTERS. Let there be half so much shown for the
people, and I will also endeavor to promote their interest. **** There is
only one pretense of a popular election in Scripture; It is of the seven that
were set over the widows. * But first, this was no part of the hierarchy:
This was no cure of souls: This was no divine institution: It was in the
dispensation of monyes: it was by command of the Apostles the election was
made, and they might recede from their own right: it was to satisfye the
multitude: it was to avoid scandal, which in the dispensation of moneys might
easily arise: it was in a temporary office: it was with such limitations, and
conditions as the Apostles prescribed them: it was out of the number of the 70
that the election was made, if we may believe S. Epiphanus, so that they were
Presbyters before this choice: and lastly, it was only a Nomination of seven
Men, the determination of the buisinesse, and the authority of rejection was
still in the Apostles, and indeed the whole power [Whom WE MAY APPOINT over
this businesse] and after all this, there can be no hurt done by the objection,
especially since clearly and indubiously the clection of Bishops, and
Presbyters was in the Apostles own persons (...), says S. Ignatius of
Evodias; Evodias was first APPOINTED to be your Governor, or Bishop, by the
APOSTLES) and themselves did committ Epist. ad Antioch.
it to others that were Bishops, as in the instances before reckoned. Thus the
case stood in Scripture.

2. In the practice of the Church it went according to the same law, and
practice Apostolical. The People did not, might not choose the Ministers of
holy Church. So the Council of Laodicea, (...). Can. 13.
The people must not choose those that are to be promoted to the Priesthood.
The prohibition extends to their Non-election of all the Superior Clergy,
Bishops and Presbyters. But who then must elect them? The Council of Nice
determines that, for in 16 and 17 Canons the Council forbids any promotion of
Clerks to be made, but by the Bishop of that Church where they are first
ordained, which clearly reserves to the Bishop the power of retayning, or
promoting all his Clergy.

* 3. All Ordinations were made by Bishops alone, (as I have already prooved.)
Now let this be confronted with the practice of Primitive Christendom, that no
Presbyter might be ordained sine titulo without a particular charge, which was
always custom, and at last grew to be a law in the Council of Chalcedon, and
we shall perceive that the ordainer was the only chooser; for then to ordain
a Presbyter was also to give him a charge; and the Patronage of a Church was
not a lay inheritance, but part of the Bishops cure, for he had (...), the care
of the Churches in all the Diocese; as I have already shown. And therefore
when S. Jerome, according to the custom of Christendom, had specified some
particular ordinations or election of Presbyters by Bishops, Epist. 61. and 62.
as how himself was made Priest by Paulinus, and Paulinus by Epiphanius of
Cyprus, Gaudeat Episcopus judicio suo, cum tales Christo elegerit Sacerdotes,
Hieron. ad Nepotian.
let the Bishop rejoice in his own act, having chosen such worthy Priests for
the service of Christ.

Thus S. Ambrose gives intimation that the dispensing all the offices in the
Clergy was solely in the Bishop. Haec spectet Sacerdos, and quod cuique
congruat, lib. 1. offic. cap. 44.
id officij deputet. Let the Bishop observe these rules, and appoint every one
his office as is best answerable to his condition and capacity. And Theodoret
reports of Leontius the Bishop of Antioch, how being an Arian, adversarios
recti dogmatis suscipiens, licet turpem Tripart. hist. lib. 5. cap. 32.
habentes vitam, ad Presbyteratus tamen ordinem, and Diacontus evexit. Eos
autem qui Vniversis virtutibus ornabantur, and Apostolica dogmata defendebant,
absque honor deseruit. He advanced his own faction, but would not promote any
man that was Catholic and pious. So he did. The power therefore of Clericall
promotion was in his own hands. This thing is evident and notorious; And there
is scarce any example in Antiquity of either Presbyters, or people choosing any
Priest, but only in the case of S. Austin whom the Peoples have snatched, and
carried him to their Bishop Valerius entreating him to ordain him Priest. This
indeed is true, that the testimony of the people, for the life of them that
were to be ordayn'd was by S. Cyprian ordinarily required; In ordinandis
Clericis (Fratres Charissimi) solemus vos ante consulere, and mores, ac merita
singulorum lib. 1. Epist. 5.
communi consilio ponderare. It was his custom to advise with his people
concerning the public fame of Clerks to be ordayn'd; It was usual (I say)
with him, but not perpetual, for it was otherwise in the case of Celerinus,
and diverse others, as I showed elsewhere.

4. In election of Bishops (though not of Priests) the Clergy and the people
had a greater actual interest, and did often intervene with their silent
consenting suffrages, or public acclamations. But first; This was not
necessary. It was otherwise among the Apostles, and in the case of Timothy, of
Titus, of S. James, of S. Mark, and all the Successors whom they did
constitute in the several chayres. 2ly. This was not by law, or right, but in
fact only. It was against the Canon of the Laodicean Council, and the 31th
Canon of the Apostles, which under pain of deposition commands that a Bishop
be not promoted to his Church by the intervening of any lay power.

Against this discourse S. Cyprian is strongly pretended. Quando ipsa [plebs]
maxim habeat potestatem Epist. 68.
vel eligendi dignos Sacerdotes, vel indignos recusandi. Quod and ipsum videmus
de divina authoritate descendere etc. Thus he is usually cited. The people have
power to choose, or to refuse their Bishops, and this comes to them from Divine
authority. No such matter. The following words expound him better, [Quod and
ipsum videmus de divina authoritate descendere, ut Sacerdos PLEBE PRaeSENTE sub
omnium oculis deligatur, and dignus, atque idoneus publico judicio ac
testimonio comprobetur: that the Bishop is chosen publicly, in the presence of
the people, and he only be thought fit who is approved by public judgment,
and testimony; or as S. Paul's phrase is [he must have a good report of all
men] that is indeed a divine institution, and that to this purpose, and for the
public attestation of the act of election and ordination the peoples presence
was required, appears clearly by S. Cyprian's discourse in this Epistle. For
what is the divine authority that he mentions? It is only the example of Moses
whom God commanded to take the Son of Eleazer and cloth him with his Fathers
robes coram omni Synagoga, before all the congregation. The people chose not,
God chose Eleazar, and Moses consecrated him, and the people stood, and looked
on; that is all that this argument can supply. * Just thus Bishops are, and ever
were ordayn'd, non nisi sub populi assistentis conscientia, in the sight of the
people standing by; but to what end? Vt plebe praesente detegantur malorum
crimina, vel bonorum merita praedicentur. All this while the election is not in
the people, nothing but the public testimony, and examination, for so it
follows, and sit ordinatio justa and legitima quae omnium suffragio, and
judicio fuerit examinata.

* * But S. Cyprian has two more proof's whence we may learn either the
sense, or the truth of his assertion. The one is of the Apostles ordayning the
seven Deacons (but this we have already examined,) the other of S. Peter
choosing S. Matthias into the Apostolate; it was indeed done in the presence of
the people. * But here it is considerable that at this surrogation of S.
Matthias the Number of the persons present was but 120, of which eleven were
Apostles, and 72 were Disciples and Presbyters, they make up 83, and then there
remains but 37 of the Laity, of which many were women, which I know not yet
whether any man would admit to the election of an Apostle, and whether they
do or do not, the Laity is a very inconsiderable Number if the matter had
been to be carried by plurality of voices; so that let the worst come that is
imaginable, the whole business was in effect carried by the Clergy, whom in
this case we have no reason to suspect to be divided, and of a distinct, or
disagreeing interest. * 2. Let this discourse be of what validity it will, yet
all this whole business was miraculous, and extraordinary; For though the
Apostles named two Candidates yet the holy Ghost chose them by particular
revelation. And yet for all this, it was lawful for S. Peter alone to have
done it without casting lots. An non licebat ipsi [Petro] eligere? licebat, and
quidem maxim; verum id non facit ne cui videretur gratificari. Quanquam
alioqui non erat particeps Spiritus. For all, he had not as yet received the
holy Ghost, yet he had power himself to have completed the election. So S.
homil. 3. in Act.
Chrysostom.

So that now, if S. Cyprian means more then the presence of the people for
suffrage of public testimony, and extends it to a suffrage of formal choice,
his proofs of the divine authority are invalid, there is no such thing can be
deduced from thence, and then this is his complying so much with the people
(which has been the fault of many a good man) may be reckoned together with
his rebaptization. But truth is, he means no more then suffrage of testimony,
viz: That he who is to be chosen Bishop be for his good life a man of good
fame, and approved of before God and all the people, and this is all the share
they have in their election. * And so indeed himself sums up the whole
business and tells us of another jus Divinum too. [Propter quod diligenter de
traditione Divina, and Apostolica observatione, observandum est and tenendum,
quod apud nos quoque, and fere apud Provincias Vniversas tenetur, ut ad
ordinationes rite celebrandas ad eam plebem cui Praepositus ordinatur, Episcopi
ejusdem provinciae proximi quique conveniant, and Episcopus deligatur plebe
praesente quae singulorum vitam plenissime novit. It is most diligently to be
observed, for there is a Divine tradition, and an Apostolical ordinance for
it, and it is used by us and almost by all Churches, that all the Bishops of
the Province assemble to the making of right ordinations, and that a Bishop be
chosen in the face of the people who best know their life and conversation.] So
that the Bishops were to make the formal election, the people to give their
judgment of approbation in this particular, and so much as concerned the
exemplary piety, and good life of him that was to be their Bishop. Here we see
in S. Cyprian is a jus Divinum for the Bishops choosing a Colleague, or a
Brother -Bishop, as much as for the presence of the people, and yet the
presence was all. And howsoever the people were present to give this testimony,
yet the election was clearly in the Bishops, and that by Divine tradition, and
Apostolical observation says S. Cyprian; And thus it was in all Churches
almost.

In Africa this was, and so it continued till after S. Austins time,
particularly in the choice of Eradius Epist. 120. lib. 3. de Sacerd.
his successor. It was so in the Greek Church as S. Chrysostom tells us. It was
so in Spain, as S. lib. 2. de offic.
Isidore tells us; and in many other places, that the people should be present,
and give acclamation, and tumultuary approbation; but to the formal election
of the Clergy, made by enumeration of votes and subscription, the people never
were admitted.

5. Although that in times of persecution, at first, and to comply with the
people who were in all respects to be sweetened, to make them with easier
appetite swallow the bitter pill of persecution, and also to make them more
obedient to their Bishop; if they did, though but in a tumult and noise cry him
up in his ordination, ne plebs invita Episcopum non optatum, aut contemnat, aut
oderit, and fiat minus religiosa quam convenit, cui non licuerit habere quem
voluit, (for so S. Leo expresses the cause) yet the formality, Epist. 84. c. 5.
and right of proper election was in the Clergy, and often so practiced without
any consent at all, or intervening act of the people. The right, I say, was in
the Bishops, so it was decreed in the Nicene Council, (...). Can. 4.
The Bishop must be appointed or constituted by all the BISHOPS of the
province, (...). It must be confirmed, and established by the METROPOLITAN. No
Presbyters here all this while, no people. * But the exercise of this power is
more clearly seen in the Acts of some Counsels, where the Fathers degraded
some Bishops, and themselves appointed others in their Rooms. * The Bishops in
the Council of Constantinople deposed Marcellus. In cujus locum Basilium in
Ancyram miserunt. They sent Basilius Bishop in his room, says Sozomen.
Tripart. hist. lib. 3. cap. 9.
* Ostendat Bassianus si per Synodum Reverendissimorum Episcoporu^, and
consueta lege Episcopus Ephesiorum Metropolis est constitutus, (said the
Fathers of the Council of Chalcedo^.) Let Bassianus show that Act. 11.
he was made BISHOP OF EPHESUS BY A SYNOD OF BISHOPS, and according to the
accustomed Law. The Law I showed before, even the Nicene Canon. The fathers of
which Council sent a Synodall Epistle to the Church of Alexandria, to tell
them they had deposed Militius from the office of a Bishop, only left him the
name, but took from him all power, nullam vero omnimodo habere potestatem,
neque Tripart. hist. lib. 2. cap. 12.
ELIGENDI, NEQUE ORDINANDI: etc. Neither suffering him to choose nor to ordain
Clerks. It seems then that was part of the Episcopal office in ordinary,
placitos sibi eligere, as the Epistle expresses it in the sequel, to choose
whom they listed. But the Council deposed Melitius, and sent Alexander their
Bishop, and Patriarch to rule the Church again. * * And particularly to come
home to the case of the present question, when Auxentius Bishop of Millaine was
dead, and the Bishops of the Province; and the Clergy of the Church, and the
people of the City, were assembled at the choosing of another, the Emperor
makes a speech to the Theodor. lib. 4. c. 5.
Bishops only, that they should be careful in their choice. So that although
the people were present, quibus pro fide, and religione etiam honor deferendus
est (as S. Cyprians phrase is) to whom respect is to be had, and fair
complyings to be used so long as they are pious, catholic, and obedient, yet
both the right of electing, and solemnity of ordaining was in the Bishops, the
peoples interest did not arrive to one half of this.

6. There are in Antiquity diverse precedents of Bishops, who chose their own
successors; it will not be imagined the people will choose a Bishop over his
head, and proclaim that they were weary of him. In those days they had more
piety. * Agelius did so, he chose Sisinnius, and that it may appear it was
without the people, they came about him, and entreated him to choose Marcian,
to whom they had been beholding in the time of Valens the Emperor; he complied
with them, and appointed Marcian to be his successor, and Sisinnius Socrat.
lib. 5. c. 21.
whom he had first chosen, to succeed Marcian. * Thus did Valerius choose his
successor, S. Austin; for though the people named him for their Priest, and
carried him to Valerius to take Orders, yet Valerius chose him Bishop. And this
was usual; (...), (as Epiphanius expresses this case,) it was ordinary to do
so in many Churches.

7. The manner of election in many Churches was various, for although indeed
the Church had commanded it, and given power to the Bishops to make the
election, yet in some times and in some Churches the Presbyters, or the
Chapter, chose one out of themselves. S. Hierome says they always did so in
Alexandria, from S. Marks time to Heraclas and Dionysius. * S. Ambrose says
that at the first, In Ephesians. 4.
the Bishop was not, by a formal new election promoted, but recedente uno
sequens ei succedebat. As one dyed so the next senior did succeed him. In both
these cases no mixture of the peoples votes.

8. In the Church of England the people were never admitted to the choice of a
Bishop from its first becoming Christian to this very day, and therefore to
take it from the Clergy, in whom it always was by permission of Princes, and
to interest the people in it, is to recede a traditionibus Majorum, from the
religion of our forefathers, and to INNOVATE in a high proportion.

9. In those Churches where the peoples suffrage (by way of testimony, I mean,
and approbation) did concur with the Synod of Bishops in the choice of a
Bishop, the people at last according to their usual guise grew hot, angry, and
tumultuous, and then were engaged by divisions in religion to Name a Bishop of
their own sect; and to disgrace one another by public scandal, and
contestation, and often grew up to Sedition, and Murder; and therefore although
they were never admitted, (unless where themselves usurped) farther then I
have declared, yet even this was taken from them, especially, since in
tumultuary assemblies, they were apt to carry all before them, they knew not
how to distinguish between power, and right, they had not well learned to take
denial, but began to obtrude whom they listed, to swell higher like a torrent
when they were checked; and the soleship of election, which by the Ancient
Canons was in the Bishops, they would have asserted wholly to themselves both
in right, and execution.

* I end this with the annotation of Zonaras upon the twelfth Canon of the
Laodicean Council. Populi suffragiis olim Episcopi eligebantur (understand him
in the senses above explicated) Sed cum multae inde seditiones existerent, hinc
factum est ut Episcoporum Vnius cujusque provinciae authoritate eligi Episcopum
quemque oportere decreverint Patres: of old time Bishops were chosen, not
without the suffrage of the people (for they concurred by way of testimony and
acclamation) but when this occasioned many seditions and tumults, the Fathers
decreed that a Bishop should be chosen by the authority of the Bishops of the
Province. And he adds that in the election of Damasus 137 men were slain, and
that six hundred examples more of that nature were producible.

Truth is, the Nomination of Bishops in Scripture was in the Apostles alone,
and though the Kindred of our Blessed Savior were admitted to the choice of
Simeon Cleophae, the Successor of S. James to the Bishopric of Jerusalem, as
Eusebius witnesses; it was lib. 3. hist. cap. 11.
propter singularem honorem, an honorary, and extraordinary privilege indulged
to them for their vicinity and relation to our Blessed Lord the fountain of
all benison to us; and for that very reason Simeon himself was chosen Bishop
too. Yet this was praeter regulam Apostolicam. The rule of the Apostles, and
their precedents were for the sole right of the Bishops to choose their
Colleagues in that Sacred order. * And then in descent, even before the Nicene
Council the people were forbidden to meddle in election, for they had no
authority by Scripture to choose; by the necessity oftimes and for the reasons
before asserted they were admitted to such a share of the choice as is now
folded up in a piece of paper, even to a testimonial; and yet I deny not but
they did often take more as in the case of Nilammon, quem cives elegerunt,
says the story out of Sozomen, they chose him alone, Tripart. hist. lib. 10.
c. 14.
(though God took away his life before himself would accept of their choice)
and then they behaved themselves oftentimes with so much insolency, partiality,
faction, sedition, cruelty, and Pagan baseness that they were quite
interdicted it, above 1200 years agone. * So that they had their little in
possession but a little while, and never had any due, and therefore now, their
request for it is no petition of right, but a popular ambition and a snatching
at a sword to hew the Church in pieces. vide did. 63. per tot. Gratian.


But I think I need not have troubled my self half so far, for they that
strive to introduce a popular election, would as feign have Episcopacy out, as
popularity of election let in. So that all this of popular election of Bishops,
may seem superfluous. For I consider, that if the peoples power of choosing
Bishops be founded upon Gods law, as some men pretend from S. Cyprian (not
proving the thing from Gods law, but Gods law from S. Cyprian) then Bishops
themselves must be by Gods law: For surely God never gave them power to choose
any man into that office which himself has no way instituted. And therefore I
suppose these men will desist from their pretense of Divine right of popular
election, if the Church will recede from her divine right of Episcopacy. But
for all their plundering, and confounding, their bold pretenses have made this
discourse necessary.

IF we add to all these foregoing particulars the 41.
Bishops only did Vote in Counsels and neither Presbyters, nor People.
power of making laws to be in Bishops, nothing else can be required to the
making up of a spiritual Principality. Now as I have shown that the Bishop of
every Diocese did give laws to his own Church for particulars, so it is
evident that the laws of Provinces and of the Catholic Church, were made by
conventions of Bishops without the intervening, or concurrence of Presbyters,
or any else for sentence and decision.

The instances of this are just so many as there are Counsels. S. Athanasius
reprehending Constantius the Arian for interposing in the Conciliary
determinations of faith, si judicium Episcoporum est (says Epist. ad Solitar.
he) quid cum eo commune habet Imperator? It is a judgment to be passed BY
BISHOPS, (meaning the determination of the article,) and not proper for the
Emperor. And when Hosius of Corduba reproved him for sitting President in a
Council, Quis enim videns eum IN DECERNENDO PRINCIPEM SE, FACERE EPISCOPORUM,
non merito dicat illum eam ipsam abhominationem desolationis? He that sits
President, makes himself chief of the Bishops, etc. intimating Bishops only
to preside in Counsels, and to make decision. And therefore conventus
Episcoporum, and Concilium Episcoporum are the words for General, and
Provincial Counsels. Bis in anno Episcoporum Concilia celebrentur, said the
38th Canon of the Apostles; and Congregatio Episcopalis the Council of Sardis
is called by Theodoret. And when lib. 2. cap. 7.
the Question was started in the time of Pope Victor about the celebration of
Easter, ob quam causam (says Eusebius) conventus Episcoporum, and Concilia
lib. 5. cap. 23.
per singulas quasque provincias convocantur. Where by the way, it is to be
observeable, that at first, even provincial Synods were only held by Bishops,
and Presbyters had no interest in the decision; however we have of late sat so
near Bishops in Provincial assemblies, that we have sat upon the Bishops
skirts. But my Lords the Bishops have a concerning interest in this. To them I
leave it; And because the four general Counsels are the Precedents and
chief of all the rest, I shall only instance in them for this particular.

1. The title of the Nicene Council runs thus. (...). The Canons of the 318
Fathers met in Nice. These Fathers were all that gave suffrage to the Canons,
for if there had been more, the title could not have appropriated the Sanction
to 318. And that there were no more S. Ambrose gives testimony in that he makes
it to be a mystical number; proem. in lib. de fide.
Nam and Abraham trecentos december and octo duxit ad bellum.... De Concilijs id
potissimum sequor quod trecenti december and octo Sacerdotes.... velut trophaeum
extulerunt, ut mihi videatur hoc esse Divinum, quod eodem numero in Concilijs,
fidei habemus oraculum, quo in historia, pietatis exemplum. Well! 318 was the
Number of the Judges, the Nicene Fathers, and they were all Bishops, for so is
the title of the subscriptions, Subscripserunt trecenti december and octo EPISCOPI
qui in eodem Concilio convenerunt; 13. whereof were Chorepiscopi, but not one
Presbyter, save only that Vitus, and Vincentius subscribed as legates of the
Bishop of Rome, but not by their own authority.

2. The great Council of Constantinople was celebrated by 150 Bishops: (...),
That Is the title of the Canons. The Canons of 150 holy Fathers who met in C. P.
and that these were all Bishops appears by the title of S. Gregory Nazianzen's
oration in the beginning of the Council. (...). The oration of S. Gregory
Nazianzen in the presence of 150 Bishops. And of this Council it was that
Socrates speaking, Imperator (says he) nulla mora interposita Concilium
EPISCOPORUM lib. 5. cap. 8.
convocat. Here indeed some few Bishops appeared by Proxy as Montanus Bishop of
Claudiopolis by Paulus a Presbyter, and Atarbius Bishop of Pontus by Cylus a
Reader, and about some four or five more. * This only, amongst the
subscriptions I find Tyrannus, Auxanon, Helladius, and Elpidius calling
themselves Presbyters. But their modesty hinders not the truth of the former
testimonies; They were Bishops, says the title of the Council, and the
Oration, and the Canons, and Socrates; And least there be scruple concerning
Auxanon Presbyter Apameae, because before, Johannes Apameensis subscribed,
which seems to intimate that one of them was the Bishop, and the other but a
Presbyter indeed, without a subterfuge of modesty, the titles distinguishes
them. For John was Bishop in the Province of Caele Syria, and Auxanon of Apamea
in Pisidia.

3. The third was the Council of Ephesus, Episcoporum plurium quam ducentorum,
as is often said in the acts of the Council [of above 200 Bishops] But no
Presbyters, for, Cum Episcopi supra ducentos extiterint qui Nestorium
deposuerunt, horum subscriptionibus contenti fuimus. We were content with the
subscription of the 200 and odd Bishops, says the Council; and Theodosius
junior, in his Epistle Epist Synod. ad Clerum C. Ptanum. part. 2. act. 3. part.
1. c. 32. Vide. 36. de simil. fere quaestione in fine.
to the Synod, Illicitum est (says he) eum qui non sit in ordine
sanctissimorum Episcoporum Ecclesiasticis immisceri tractatibus. It is
unlawful for any but them who are in the order of the most holy Bishops, to be
in. terest in Ecclesiastical assemblies.

4. The last of the four great conventions of Christendom was, sexcentorum
triginta Episcoporum, of 630 Bishops at Chalcedon in Bithynia. But in all these
assemblies, no mere Presbyters gave suffrage except by legation from his
Bishop, and delegation of authority. And therefore when in this Council some
Laics, and some Monks, and some Clergymen, not Bishops, would interest
themselves Pulcheria the Empress sent letters to Consularius to repel them by
force; si praeter nostram evocationem, aut permissionem suorum Episcoporum
ibidem commorantur, who come without command of the Empress, or the Bishops
permission. Where it is observeable that the Bishops might bring Clerks with
them to assist, to dispute, and to be present in all the action; And thus they
often did suffer Abbots, or Archimandrites to be there, and to subscribe too,
but that was praeter regulam, and by indulgence only, and condescension; For
when Martinus the Abbot was requested to subscribe he answered, Nec Action. 1.
Council. Chalced.
suum esse, sed Episcoporum tantum subscribere, it belonged only to Bishops to
subscribe to Counsels. For this reason the Fathers themselves often called out
in the Council, Mitte for as superfluos, Concilium Episcoporum est.

But I need not more particular arguments, for till the Council of Basil, the
Church never admitted Presbyters as in their own right to voice in Counsels,
and that Council we know savourd too much of the Schismatic, but before this
Council, no example, no president of subscriptions of the Presbyters either to
Oecumenicall, or Provincial Synods. Indeed to a Diocesan Synod, viz. that of
Auxerre in Burgundy, I find 32 Presbyters subscribing. This Synod was neither
Oecumenicall nor Provincial, but merely the Convocation of a Diocese. For
here was but one Bishop, and some few Abbots, and 32 Presbyters. It was indeed
no more then a visitation, or the calling of a Chapter, for of this we receive
intimation in the seventh Canon of that assembly, ut in medio Maio omnes
Presbyteri ad Council. Antisiodor. can. 7.
Synodum venirent, that was their summons, and in Novembri omnes Abbates ad
Concilium: so that here is intimation of a yearly Synod besides the first
convention, the greatest of them but Diocesan, and therefore the lesser but
conventus Capitularis, or however not enough to give evidence of a subscription
of Presbyters to so much as a Provincial Council. For the guise of
Christendom was always otherwise, and therefore it was the best argument that
the Bishops in the Arian hurry used to acquit themselves from the suspicion of
heresy, Neque nos sumus Arii sectatores; Qui namque fieri potest, ut cum simus
Episcopi Ario Presbytero auscultemus? Socrat. lib. 2. c. 7.
Bishops never receive determination of any article from Priests, but Priests
do from Bishops. Nam vestrum est eos instruere (says S. Clement speaking
Epist. 3. per Ruffinum.
of the Bishops office and power over Priests and all the Clergy, and all the
Diocese) eorum est vobis obedire, ut Deo cujus legatione fungimini. And a
little after; Audire ergo eum attentius oportet, and ab ipso suscicere
doctrinam fidei, monita autem vitae a Presbyteris inquirere. Of the Priests we
must inquire for rules of good life, but of the Bishop receive positions and
determinations of faith.

Against this if it be objected, Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus tractari debet,
That which is of general concernement, must also be of general Scrutiny. I
answer, it is true, unless where God himself has entrusted the care of
others in a body, as he has in the Bishops, and will require the souls of his
Diocese at his hand, and commanded us to require the Law at their mouths, and
to follow their faith, Hebr. 13. 7. and 17. 1. Pet. 5. 2. Act. 20.
whom he has set over us. And therefore the determination of Counsels
pertains to all, and is handled by all, not in diffusion but in representation.
For, Ecclesia est in Episcopo, and Episcopus in Ecclesia, (says S. Cyprian)
the Church is in the Bishop (viz. by representment) and the Bishop is in the
Church Epist. 69.
(viz. as a Pilot in a ship, or a Master in a family, or rather as a steward,
and Guardian to rule in his Masters absence) and for this reason the Synod of
the Nicene Bishops is called (in Eusebius) conventus orbis Lib. 3. de vita
Constant. lib. de baptis. cap. 18.
terrarum, and by S. Austin, consensus totius Ecclesiae, not that the whole
Church was there present in their several persons, but was there represented
by the Catholic Bishops, and if this representment be not sufficient for
obligation to all, I see no reason but the Ladies too, may vote in Counsels,
for I doubt not, but they have souls too.

But however, if this argument were concluding in it self, yet it looses its
force in England, where the Clergy are bound by Laws of Parliament, and yet in
the capacity of Clergymen are allowed to choose neither Procurators to
represent us as Clergy, nor Knights of the shire to represent us as Commons. *
In conclusion of this I say to the Presbyters as S. Ambrose said of the
Lay-judges, whom the Arians would have brought to judge in Council (it was an
old heretical trick.) Veniant plane si qui sunt ad Ecclesiam, audiant cum
populo, non ut Epist. 32.
QUIS QUAM IUDEX resideat, sed unus quisque de suo affectu habeat examen, and
eligat quem sequatur. So may Presbyters be present, so they may judge, not for
others, but for themselves. And so may the people be present, and anciently
were so; and therefore Counsels were always kept in open Churches, [ubi
populus judicat] not for others, but for themselves, not by external sentence,
but internal conviction, so S. Ambrose expounds himself in the forecited
allegation.

There is no considerable objection against this discourse but that of the
first Council of Jerusalem; where the Apostles, and ELDERS did meet together
to DETERMINE of the question of circumcision. For although in the story of
celebration of it, we find no man giving sentence but Peter, and James; yet in
16. Acts, they are called (...), decrees JUDGED by the Apostles, and Elders.
But first, in this the difficulty is the less, because [Presbyter] was a
general word for all that were not of the number of the twelve, Prophets,
Evangelists, Pastors, and Doctors. And then secondly, it is none at all,
because Paul, and Barnabas are signally, and by name reckoned as present in the
Synod, and one of them Prolocutor, or else both. So that such Presbyters may
well define in such conventuall assemblies. 3. If yet there were any difficulty
latent in the story, yet the Catholic practice of Gods Church, is certainly
the best expositor of such places where there either is any difficulty, or
where any is pretended. And of this, I have already given account.

* I remember also that this place is pretended for the peoples power of
voycing in Counsels. It is a pretty pageant; only that it is against the
Catholic practice of the Church, against the exigence of Scripture, which bids
us require the law at the Mouth of our spiritual Rulers, against the gravity
of such assemblies, for it would force them to betumultuous, and at the best,
are the worst of Sanctions, as being issues of popularity, and to sum up all,
it is no way authorized by this first copy of Christian Counsels. The pretense
is, in the Synodall Acts 15. 23.
letter written in the name of [the Apostles, and Elders, and Brethren] that
is, (says Geta,) The Apostles, and Presbyters, and People. But why not
BRETHREN, that is, all the Deacons, and Evangelists, and Helpers in
Government, and Ministers of the Churches? There is nothing either in words,
or circumstances to contradict this. If it be asked who then are meant by
Elders, if by [Brethren] S. Luke understands these Church officers? I answer,
that here is such variety, that although I am not certain which officers he
precisely comprehends under the distinct titles of Elders, and Brethren, yet
here are enough to furnish both with variety, and yet neither to admit mere
Presbyters in the present acceptance of the word, nor yet the Laity to a
decision of the question, nor authorizing the decretall. For besides the twelve
Apostles, there were Apostolical men which were Presbyters, and something
more, as Paul and Barnabas, and Silas; and Evangelists, and Pastors besides,
which might furnish out the last appellative sufficiently. But however without
any further trouble it is evident, that this word [Brethren] does not
distinguish the Laity from the Clergy. [Now when they heard this, they were
pricked in their hearts, and said unto PETER, and to the rest of the APOSTLES,
Men and BRETHREN what shall we do. Judas and Silas who were Apostolical men,
are called in Scripture, chief men among the BRETHREN. But this is too known,
to need a contestation.

I only insert the saying of Basilius the Emperor in the 8th Synod. De vobis
autem Laicis tam qui in dignitatibus, quam qui absolute versamini quid amplius
dicam non habeo, quam quod nullo modo vobis licet de Ecclesiasticis causis
sermonem movere, neque penitus resistere integritati Ecclesiae, and universali
Synodo adversari. Laymen (says the Emperor) must by no means meddle with
causes Ecclesiastical, nor oppose themselves to the Catholic Church, or
Counsels Oecumenicall. They must not meddle, for these things appertain to
the cognizance of Bishops and their decision. * And now after all this, what
authority is equal to this LEGISLATIVE of the Bishops? (...), (says
Aristotle,) Lib. 4. polit. c. 15.
They are all evidences of power and authority, to deliberate, to determine, or
judge, to make laws. But to make laws is the greatest power that is
imaginable. The first may belong fairly enough to Presbyters, but I have
proved the two latter to be appropriate to Bishops.

LAstly, as if all the acts of jurisdiction, and every 42.
imaginable part of power were in the Bishop, over And the Bishop had a
propriety in the persons of his Clerks,
the Presbyters and subordinate Clergy, the Presbyters are said to be
Episcoporum Presbyteri, the Bishops Presbyters; as having a propriety in them,
and therefore a superiority over them, and as the Bishop was a dispenser of
those things which were in bonis Ecclesiae, so he was of the persons too, a
Ruler in propriety. * S. Hilary in the book which himself delivered to
Constantine, Ecclesiae adhuc (says he) per Presbyteros MEOS communionem
distribuens, I still give the holy Communion to the faithful people by MY
Presbyters. And therefore in the third Council of Carthage a great
deliberation was had about requiring a Clerk of his Bishop, to be promoted in
another Church,.... Denique qui unum habuerit numquid debet illi ipse unus
Presbyter auferri? (says Posthumianus.) If the Bishop have Can. 45. Council.
Carthag. 3.
but one Presbyter must that one be taken from him? Idsequor (says Aurelius)
ut conveniam Episcopum ejus, atque ei inculcem quod ejus Clericus a qualibet
Ecclesia postuletur. And it was resolved, ut Clericum alienum nisi concedente
ejus Episcopo. No man shall retain another Bishop's without the consent of the
Bishop whose Clerk he is.

* When Athanasius was abused by the calumny of the heretics his adversaries,
and entered to purge himself, Athanasius ingreditur cum Timotheo Presbytero
Eccles. hist. lib. 10. cap. 17.
Suo. He comes in with Timothy HIS Presbyter; and, Arsenius, cujus brachium
dicebatur excisum, lector aliquando fuerat Athanasii. Arsenius was Athanasius
HIS Reader. Vbi autem ventum est ad Rumores de poculo fracto a Macario
Presbytero Athanasii, etc. Macarius was another of Athanasius HIS Priests. So
Theodoret. Peter, and Irenaeus were two Lib. 2. cap. 8.
more of his Presbyters, as himself witnesses. Paulinianus comes sometimes to
visit us (says S. Hierome to Pammachius) but not as your Clerk, sed Athanas.
Epist. a^ vitam solitar: agentes.
ejus a quo ordinatur. His Clerk who did ordain him. But these things are too
known to need a multiplication of instances.

The sum is this. The question was, whether or no, and how far the Bishops
had Superiority over Presbyters in the Primitive Church. Their doctrine, and
practice have furnished us with these particulars. The power of Church goods,
and the sole dispensation of them, and a propriety of persons was reserved to
the Bishop. For the Clergy, and Church possessions were in his power, in his
administration: the Clergy might not travail without the Bishops leave: they
might not be preferred in another Diocese without license of their own Bishop:
in their own Churches the Bishop had sole power to prefer them, and they must
undertake the burden of any promotion if he calls them to it: without him they
might not baptize, not consecrate the Eucharist, not communicate, not reconcile
penitents, not preach; not only, not without his ordination, but not without a
special faculty besides the capacity of their order: The Presbyters were bound
to obey their Bishops in their sanctions, and canonical impositions, even by
the decrce of the Apostles themselves, and the doctrine of Ignatius, and the
constitution of S. Clement, of the Fathers in the Council of Arles, Ancyra,
and Toledo, and many others: The Bishops were declared to be Judges in ordinary
of the Clergy, and people of their Diocese by the concurrent suffrages of
almost 2000 holy Fathers assembled in Nice, Ephesus, Chalcedon, in Carthage,
Antioch, Sardis, Aquileia, Taurinum, Agatho, and by the Emperor, and by the
Apostles; and all this attested by the constant practice of the Bishops of the
Primitive Church inflicting censures upon delinquents, and absolving them as
they saw cause, and by the dogmaticall resolution of the old Catholics
declaring in their attributes, and appellatives of the Episcopal function that
they have supreme, and universal spiritual power, (viz. in the sense above
explicated) over all the Clergy and Laity of their Diocese, as [that they are
higher then all power, the image of God, the figure of Christ, Christ's Vicar,
President of the Church, Prince of Priests, of authority incomparable,
unparalleled power] and many more, if all this be witness enough of the
superiority of Episcopal jurisdiction, we have their depositions, we may
proceed as we see cause for, and reduce our Episcopacy to the primitive state,
for that is truly a reformation [id Dominicum quod primum, id haereticum quod
posterius] and then we shall be sure Episcopacy will loose nothing by these
unfortunate contestations.

BUT against the cause, it is objected super totam. 43.
Their Jurisdiction was over many congregations, or Parishes,
Materiam, that Bishops were not Diocesan, but Parochial, and therefore of so
confined a jurisdiction that perhaps our Village, or City Priests shall
advance their Pulpit, as high as the Bishops throne.

* Well! put case they were not Diocesan, but parish Bishops, what then? yet
they were such Bishops as had Presbyters, and Deacons in subordination to them,
in all the particular advantages of the former instances.

2. If the Bishops had the Parishes, what cure had the Priests? so that this
will debase the Priests as much as the Bishops, and if it will confine a Bishop
to a Parish, it will make that no Presbyter can be so much as a Parish Priest.
If it brings a Bishop lower then a Diocese, it will bring the Priest lower
then a Parish. For set a Bishop where you will, either in a Diocese, or a
Parish, a Presbyter shall still keep the same duty and subordination, the same
distance still. So that this objection upon supposition of the former
discourse, will no way mend the matter for any side, but make it far worse,
it will not advance the Presbytery, but it will depresse the whole hierarchy,
and all the orders of H. Church.

* But because, this trifle is so much used amongst the enemies of Episcopacy,
I will consider it in little, and besides that it does no body any good
advantage, I will represent it in it is fucus and show the falsehood of it.

1. Then. It is evident that there were Bishops before there were any distinct
Parishes. For the first division of Parishes in the West was by Evaristus, who
lived almost 100 years after Christ, and divided Rome into seven parishes,
assigning to every one a Presbyter. So Damasus reports of him in the
Pontifical book. Hic titulos in urbe Roma divisit Presbyteris, and septem
Diaconos ordinavit qui custodirent Episcopum praedicantem propter stylum
veritatis. He divided the Parishes, or titles in the City of Rome to
Presbyters. The same also is by Damasus reported of Dionysius in his life, hic
Presbyteris Ecclesias divisit, and caemiteria, parochiasque and dioeceses
constituit. Marcellus increased the number in the year 305. Hic fecit
caemiterium via Salaria, and 25 Titulos in urbe Roma constituit quasi dioeceses
propter baptismum, and poenitentiam multorum qui convertebantur ex Paganis, and
propter sepulturas Martyrum. He made a Sepulture, or caemitery for the burial
of Martyrs, and appointed 25. Titles or Parishes: but he adds [quasi
Dioeceses] as it had been diocesses, that is, distinct and limited to
Presbyters, as diocesses were to Bishops; and the use of parishes which he
subjoynes, cleares the business; for he appointed them only propter
baptismum, and poenitentiam multorum and sepulturas, for baptism, and penance,
and burial; for as yet there was no preaching in Parishes, but in the
Mother Church. Thus it was in the West.

* But in Egypt we find Parishes divided something sooner then the earliest of
these, for Eusebius reports out of Philo that the Christians in S. Marks Lib.
2. hist. cap. 17.
time had several Churches in Alexandria. Etiam DE ECCLESIIS quae apud eos
sunt, it a dicit. Est autem in singulis locis consecrata orationi domus etc:
But even before this, there were Bishops. For in Rome there were four Bishops
before any division of Parishes, though S. Peter be reckoned for none. And
before Parishes were divided in Alexandria, S. Mark himself who did it was
the Bishop, and before that time S. James was Bishop of Jerusalem, and in
diverse other places where Bishops were, there were no distinct Parishes of a
while after Evaristus time, for when Dionysius had assigned Presbyters to
several Parishes, he writes of it to Severus Bishop of Corduba, and desires
him to do so too in his Diocese, as appears in his Epistle to him.

* For indeed necessity required it, when the Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 43. Apolog.
c. 37.
Christians multiplied and grew to be (...), as apud Binium. tom. 1. Council
Cornelius called the Roman Christians, a great and innumerable people; and did
implere omnia, as Tertullians phrase is, filled all places, and public and
great assemblies drew danger upon themselves, and increased jealousies in
others, and their public offices could not be performed with so diffused and
particular advantage, then they were forced to divide congregations, and
assign several Presbyters to their cure, in subordination to the Bishop, and
so we see, the elder Christianity grew, the more Parishes there were. At first
in Rome there were none, Evaristus made seven, Dionysius made some more, and
Marcellus added 15, and in Optatus lib. 2. contr. Parmenian.
time there were 40.

Well then! The case is thus. Parishes were not divided at first, therefore to
be sure they were not of Divine institution. Therefore it is no divine
institution that a Presbyter should be fixed upon a Parish, therefore also a
Parish is not by Christ's ordinance an independent body, for by Christ's
ordinance there was no such thing at all, neither absolute, nor in dependence
neither; and then for the maine issue, since Bishops were before Parishes (in
the present sense) the Bishops in that sense could not be Parochial.

* But which was first, a private congregation, or a Diocese? If a private
congregation, then a Bishop was at first fixed in a private congregation, and
so was a Parochial Bishop. If a Diocese was first, then the Question will be,
how a Diocese could be without Parishes, for what is a Diocese but a
jurisdiction over many Parishes?

* I answer, it is true that DIOCESE and PARISH are words used now in
contradistinction; And now, a Diocese is nothing but the multiplication of of
many Parishes: Sed non fuit sic ab initio. For at first, a Diocese was the
City and the Regio suburbicaria, the neighboring towns, in which there was
no distinction of Parishes: That which was a Diocese in the secular sense,
that is, a particular Province, or division of secular prefecture, that was the
assignation of a Bishops charge. * Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Laodicea, were
(...), heads of the Diocesses, (says Pliny,) meaning in respect of secular
lib. 5. cap. 29. and 30. Vide Baron. A. D. 39. n. 10. and B. Rhenan. in notit.
provinc. Imperial. in descript. Illyrici.
jurisdiction; and so they were in Ecclesiastical regiment. And it was so upon
great reason, for when the regiment of the Church was extended just so as the
regiment of the Commonwealth, it was of less suspicion to the secular power,
while the Church regiment was just fixed together with the political, as if of
purpose to show their mutual consistence, and it is own subordination. ** And
besides this, there was in it a necessity; for the subjects of another
Province, or Diocese, could not either safely, or conveniently meet where the
duty of the Commonwealth did not engage them; but being all of one prefecture,
and Diocese, the necessity of public meetings in order to the Commonwealth
would be fair opportunity for the advancement of their Christendom. And this,
which at first was a necessity in this case, grew to be a law in all, by the
sanction of the Council of Can. 17.
Chalcedon, and of Constantinople in Can. 38.
Trullo, (...). Let the order of the Church, follow the order and guise of the
Common wealth, viz. in her regiment, and prefefecture.

* But in the modern sense of this division a Bishops charge was neither a
Parish, nor a Diocese, as they are taken in relation; but a Bishop had the
supreme care of all the Christians which he by himself, or his Presbyters had
converted, and he also had the charge of endeavoring the conversion of all the
Country. So that although he had not all the Diocese actually in communion and
subjection, yet his charge, his Diocese was so much. Just as it was with the
Apostles, to whom Christ gave all the world for a Diocese, yet at first they
had but a small congregation that did actually obey them.

And now to the Question. Which was first, a particular congregation or a
Diocese? I answer, that a Diocese was first, that is, the Apostles had a
charge before they had a congregation of converts; And S. Mark was sent Bishop
to Alexandria by S. Peter before any were converted. * But ordinarily the
Apostles, when they had converted a City or Nation, then fixed Bishops upon
their charge, and there indeed the particular congregation was before the
Bishop's taking of the Diocese; But then, this City, or Nation although it was
not the Bishops Diocese before it was a particular congregation, yet it was
part of the Apostles Diocese, and this they concredited to the Bishops
respectively.

S. Paul was ordained by the Prophets at Antioch, Apostle of the
Uncircumcision; All the Gentiles was his Diocese, and even of those places he
then received power which as yet he had not converted. So that, absolutely, a
diocese was before a particular congregation. But if a diocese be taken
collectively, as now it is, for a multitude of Parishes united under one
Bishop, then one must needs be before 20, and a particular congregation before
a diocese; but then that particular congregation was not a parish, in the
present sense, for it was not a part of a Diocese taking a Diocese for a
collection of Parishes; but that particular Congregation was the first fruits
of his Diocese, and like a Grain of Mustard Seed that in time might, and did
grow up to a considerable height, even to a necessity of distinguishing titles,
and parts of the Diocese, assigning several parts, to several Priests.

2. We see that the Primitive Bishops, before the division of parishes, had the
City, and Country; and after the division of parishes, had them all under his
jurisdiction, and ever, even from the Apostles times had several provinces
(some of them I mean) within their limits and charges. * The 35 Canon of the
Apostles gives power to the Bishop to dispose only of those things (...), which
are under his Diocese and the Neighbor-villages, and the same thing is
repeated in the ninth and tenth Canons of the Council of Antioch calling it
(...), the Ancient Canon of our forefathers; and yet it self is elder then
three of the general Counsels, and if then it was an Ancient Canon of the
Fathers, that the City and Villages should be subject to the Bishop, surely a
Primitive Bishop was a Diocesan.

But a little before this was the Nicene Council, Can. 6.
and there I am sure we have a Bishop that is at least a Diocesan. (...). Let
the old Customs be kept. What are those? (...). Let the Bishop of Alexandria
have power over ALL Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis: It was a good large Parish;
And yet this parish if we have a mind to call it so, was (...), according to
the old custom of their forefathers, and yet that was so early that S. Anthony
was then alive, who was borne in S. Irenaeus his time, who was himself but
second from the Apostles.

It was also a good large parish that Ignatius was Bishop of, even all Syria,
Caelesyria, Mesopotamia, and both the Ciliciae. (...), The Bishop of Syria he
calls himself in his epistle to the Romans, and (...), so Theodoret: and
besides lib. 5. ca. 23.
all these, his Successors, in the Council of Chalcedon, had the two
Phaeniciae, and Arabia yielded Action. 7.
to them by composition. These alone would have made two or three reasonable
good parishes, and would have taken up time enough to perambulate, had that
been then the guise of Christendom. * But examples of this kind are infinite.
Theodorus Bishop Epist. ad Leon. 1. Episc. Romans Haeres. 68.
of Cyrus was Pastor over 800 parishes, Athanasius was Bishop of Alexandria,
Egypt, Thebais, Mareotis, Libya, Ammoniaca, and Pentapolis, says S.
Epiphanius; And his predecessor Iulianus, successor of Agrippinus, was Bishop
Council Chalced. act. 16.
(...), of the Churches about Alexandria. Either it was a Diocese, or at least
a plurality. * Theodoret. lib. 5. c. 28.
S. Chrysostom had Pontus, Asia, and all Thrace in his parish, even as much as
came to sixteen prefectures; a fair bounds surely; and so it was with all the
Bishops, a greater, or a lesser Diocese they had; but all were Diocesan; for
they had several parishes, singuli Ecclesiarum Episcopi habent sub se
Ecclesias, says Epiphanius in his epistle to John of Jerusalem, and in his
Apud. S. Hieron. haeres. 69.
book contra haereses, Quotquot enim in Alexandria Catholicae Ecclesiae sunt,
sub uno Archiepiscopo sunt, privatimque ad has destinati sunt Presbyteri
propter Ecclesiasticas necessitates, it aut habitatores vicini sint
uniuscujusque Ecclesiae. * All Italy was the parish of Lib. 4. c. 12. Encom.
Cyprian. Sozom. lib. 5. c. 18. Vide apud Eusebius. lib. ^. c. 22.
Liberius (says Socrates.) Africa was S. Cyprians parish, says S. Gregory
Nazianzen, and S. Basil the Great was Parish Priest to all Cappadocia. But I
rather believe if we examine their several stories they will rather prove
Metropolitans, then mere parochians.

3ly The ancient Canons forbad a Bishop to be ordained in a Village, Castle, or
Town. It was so decreed in the Council of Laodicea before the first Nicene.
(...). Can. 56.
In the Villages, or Countries, Bishops must not be constituted. And this was
renewed in the Council of Sardis, (...). Can. 6.
It is not lawful to ordain Bishops in Villages or little Towns to which one
Presbyter is sufficient, (...), but Bishops must ordain Bishops in those
Cities where Bishops formerly have been. * So that this Canon does not make a
new Constitution, but perpetuates the old sanction. Bishops ab antiquo were
only ordained in great Cities, and Presbyters to little Villages. Who then was
the Parish Curate? the Bishop or the Priest? The case is too apparent.

Only, here it is objected that some Bishops were of small Towns, and
therefore these Canons were not observed, and Bishops might be, and were
parochial, as S. Gregory of Nazianzum, Zoticus of Comana, Maris in Dolicha.
The one of these is called (...) by Lib. y. c. 16.
Eusebius; and another (...) by Lib. 5. cap. 4.
Theodoret, a little Town. This is all is pretended for this great Scarcrow of
parochial Bishops.

* But, first, suppose these had been parishes, and these three parochial
Bishops, it follows not that all were; not those to be sure, which I have
proved to have been Bishops of Provinces, and Kingdoms. 2ly It is a clear
case, that Nazianzum though a small City, yet was the seat of a Bishops
throne, so it is reckoned in the (...) made by Leo the Emperor, where it is
accounted inter thronos Ius Graecc-Rom. p. 89.
Ecclesiarum Patriarchae Constantinopolitano subjectarum, and is in the same
account with Caesarea, with Ephesus, with Crete, with Philippi, and almost
fourscore more. * As for Zoticus, he indeed came from Vide Baron. An. Dom. 205
n. 27.
Comana, a Village town, for there he was born, but he was Episcopus Otrenus,
Bishop of Otrea in Armenia, says Lib. 4. c. 25.
Nicephorus. * And for Maris the Bishop of Dolicha, it was indeed such a small
City as Nazianzus was, but that proves not but his Diocese and territory was
large enough. Thus was Asclepius Gennad. apud Hieron. Johan. de Trittenheim de
script. Eccles.
vici non grandis, but yet he was Vagensis territorii Episcopus. His seat might
usually be in a little City, if it was one of those towns in which according
to the exigence of the Canons (...) in which Bishops anciently were ordained,
and yet the appurtenances of his Diocese large, and extended, and too great
for 100 Parish Priests.

4ly. The institution of Chorepiscopi proves most evidently that the Primitive
Bishops were Diocesan, not Parochial: for they were instituted to assist the
Bishop in part of his Country-charge, and were (...), Visiters, (as the
Council of Laodicea calls them.) But what need such Suffragans, such
coadjutors to the managing of a Parish. Indeed they might possibly have been
needful for the managing of a Citty-parish, especially if a whole City was a
Parish, as these objectors must pretend, or not say Primitive Bishops were
Parochial. But being these Chorepiscopi were Suffragans to the Bishop, and did
their offices in the country, while the Bishop was resident in the City,
either the Bishops parish extended it self from City to Country; and then it
is all one with a Diocese, or else we can find no employment for a
Chorepiscopus, or Visiter. * The tenth Canon of the Council of Antioch,
describes their use and power. Qui in villis and vicis constituti sunt
Chorepiscopi.... placuit sanctae Synodo ut modum proprium recognoscant, ut
gubernent sibi subjectas Ecclesias. They were to govern the Churches delegated
to their charge. It seems they had many Churches under their provision, and yet
they were but the Bishops Vicars, for so it follows in the Canon; he must not
ordain any Presbyters, and Deacons absque urbis Episcopo cui ipse subjicitus,
and Regio; Without leave of the Bishop of the City to whom both himself, and
all the Country is subordinate.

5. The Bishop was one in a City wherein were many Presbyters. (...), says S.
Ignatius. There is one Altar in every Church, and Epist. ad Philadelph.
ONE BISHOP together with the Presbytery, and the Deacons. Either then a whole
City, such as Rome, or Jerusalem (which as Josephus reports had 400
Synagogues,) must be but one Parish, and then they had as good call a Bishops
charge a Diocese, as a Parish in that latitude; or if there were many Parishes
in a City, and the Bishop could have but one of them, why, what hindered but
that there might in a City be as many Bishops, as Presbyters? For if a Bishop
can have but one Parish, why may notevery Parish have a Bishop? But by the
ancient Canons, a City though never so great, could have but one for it self
and all the Country, therefore every Parish Priest was not a Bishop, nor the
Bishop a mere Parish Priest.

Ne in una civitate duo sint Episcopi, was the Constitution Lib. 10. Eccles.
hist.
of the Nicene Fathers as says Ruffinus; and long before this, it was so known
a business that one City should have but one Bishop, that Cornelius
exprobrates to Novatus his ignorance, is ergo qui Apud Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 33.
Evangelium vendicabat, nesciebat in Ecclesia Catholica unum Episcopum esse
debere, ubi videbat esse Presbyteros quadraginta and sex. Novatus (the Father
of the old Puritans) was a goodly Gospeller that did not know that in a
Catholic Church there should be but one Bishop wherein there were 46
Presbyters; intimating clearly that a Church that had two Bishops is not
Catholic, but Schismatic at least, (if both be pretended to be of a fixed
residence) what then is he that would make as many Bishops in a Church as
Presbyters? He is (...), he fights against God, if S. Ambrose say true. Deus
enim singulis In 1. Cor. 12.
Ecclesiis singulos Episcopos praeesse decrevit. God has decreed that one
Bishop should rule in one Church; and of what extent his ONE CHURCH was, may
easily be guessed by himself who was the Ruler, and Bishop of the great City,
and province of Millaine. * And therefore when Valerius (...). Epiphan. haeres.
66. n. 6. Possidon. in vita S. Aug. cap. 8.
as it was then sometimes used in several Churches had ordained S. Austin to
be Bishop of Hippo, whereof Valerius was also Bishop at the same time, S.
Austin was troubled at it as an act most Uncanonicall, and yet he was not
ordained to rule in common with Valerius, but to rule in succession and after
the consummation of Valerius. It was the same case in Agelius, a Novatian
Bishop ordaining Marcian Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 21*
to be his successor, and Sisinnius to succeed him, the acts were indeed
irregular, but yet there was no harm in it to this cause, they were ordained
to succeed, not in conjunction. * (...), (says Sozomen) It is a Lib. 4. cap.
15.
note of Schism, and against the rule of H. Church to have two Bishops in one
chair. Secundus Episcopus nullus est (says S. Lib. 4. Epist. 2.
Cyprian) And as Cornelius reports it in his epistle to S. Cyprian, it was the
voice of the Confessors that had been the instruments and occasions of the
Novatian Schism by erecting another Bishop; Nec non ignoramus unum Deum esse,
unum Christum esse Dominum quem confessi sumus, unum spiritum sanctum, unum
Episcopum in Catholica Ecclesia esse debere. And these very words the people
also used in the contestation about Liberius, and Faelix. For when the Emperor
was willing that Liberius should return to his See, on condition that Faelix
the Arian might be Bishop there too, they derided the suggestion, crying out,
One God, one Christ, one Bishop. So Theodoret reports. But who lists to see
more of this, may be satisfied Lib. 2. c. 11.

Cyprian, de Vnitate Ecclesiae, sive de singularitate Prelatorum.

6ly. Suppose the ordinary Diocesses had been parishes, yet what were the
Metropolitans, and the Primates, were they also parish-Bishops? Surely if
Bishops were parochial, then these were at least diocesan by their own
argument, for to be sure they had many Bishops under them. But there were none
such in the Primitive Church? yes most certainly. The 35 Canon of the Apostles
tells us so, most plainly, and at the worst, they were a very primitive
record. Episcopos gentium singularum scire convenit quis inter eos PRIMUS
HABEATUR, quem velut caput existiment, and nihil amplius praeter ejus
conscientiam gerant, quam ea sola quae parochiae propriae, and villis quae sub
ea sunt, competunt. The Bishops of every Nation must know who is their PRIMATE,
and esteem him as their HEAD, and do NOTHING without his consent, but those
things that appertain to their own Diocese. And from hence the Fathers of
the Council of Antioch derived their sanction, per singulas regiones Episcopos
convenit nosse METROPOLITANUM Council. Antioch. ca. 9.
Episcopum sollicitudinem totius provinciae gerere etc. The Bishops of every
province must know that their METROPOLITAN. Bishop does take cure of all the
province. For this was an Apostolical Constitution (says S. Clement) that in
the conversion of Gentile Epist. 1. ad Iacobum Fratrem Domini.
Cities in place of the Archflamines, Archbishops, Primates, or Patriarchs
should be placed, qui reliquorum Episcoporum judicia, and majora (quoties
necesse foret) negotia in fide agitarent, and secundum Dei voluntatem, sicut
constituerunt Sancti Apostoli, definirent. * Alexandria was a Metropoliticall
See long before the Nicene Council, as appears in the sixth Canon before
cited; Nay, Dioscorus the Bishop of vide Council. Chalced. act. 1. in epist.
Theod. and Valentin. Imp.
that Church was required to bring ten of the METROPOLITANS that he had UNDER
HIM to the Council of Ephesus, by Theodosius and Valentinian Emperors, so
that it was a PATRIARCHAT.

These are enough to show that in the Primitive Church there were Metropolitan
Bishops. Now then either Bishops were Parochial, or no: If no, then they were
Diocesan; if yea, then at least many of them were Diocesan, for they had
(according to this rate) many Parochial Bishops under them.

* But I have stood too long upon this impertinent trifle, but as nowadayes it
is made, the consideration of it is material to the maine Question. Only this
I add; That if any man should trouble the world with any other fancy of his
own, and say that our Bishops are nothing like the Primitive, because all the
Bishops of the Primitive Church had only two towns in their charge, and no
more, and each of these towns had in them 170 families, and were bound to have
no more, how should this man be confuted? It was just such a device as this in
them that first meant to disturb this Question, by pretending that the Bishops
were only parochial, not diocesan, and that there was no other Bishop but the
Parish Priest. Most certainly, themselves could not believe the allegation,
only they knew it would raise a dust. But by God's providence, there is water
enough in the Primitive fountains to allay it.

ANother consideration must here be interposed. 44.
concerning the intervening of Presbyters in And was aided by Presbyters but
not impaired.
the regiment of the several Churches. For though I have twice already shown
that they could not challenge it of right either by Divine institution, or
Apostolical ordinance, yet here also it must be considered how it was in the
practice of the Primitive Church, for those men that call the Bishop a Pope,
are themselves desirous to make a Conclave of Cardinals too, and to make every
Diocese a Roman Consistory.

1. Then, the first thing we hear of Presbyters (after Scripture I mean, for
of it I have already given account) is from the testimony of S. Hierome, in
Epist. ad Titum. cap. 1.
Antequam studia in religione fierent, and diceretur in populis ego sum Pauli
etc: communi Presbyterorum consilio Ecclesiae gubernabantur. Before factions
arose in the Church, the Church was governed by the common Counsel of
Presbyters. Here S. Hierome either means it of the time before Bishops were
constituted in particular Churches, or after Bishops were appointed. If, before
Bishops were appointed, no hurt done, the Presbyters might well rule in common,
before themselves had a ruler appointed to govern both them and all the
diocese beside. For so S. Ignatius writing to the Church of Antioch Epist. ad
Antioch.
exhorts the Pres byters to feed the flock until God should declare (...) whom
he would make their ruler. And S. Cyprian speaking of Etecusa Epist. 2. 1.
and some other women that had made defaillance in time of persecution, and so
were put to penance, praeceperunt eas Praepositi tantisper sic esse, donec
Episcopus constituatur. The Presbyters, whom sede vacant he praeter morem
suum calls Praepositos, they gave order that they should so remain till the
Consecration of a Bishop. * But, if S. Hierome means this saying of his, after
Bishops were fixed, then his expression answers the allegation, for it was but
communi CONSILIO Presbyterorum, the IUDICIUM might be solely in the Bishop, he
was the JUDGE, though the Presbyters were the COUNSELORS, For so himself
adds, that upon occasion of those first Schisms in Corinth, it was DECREED in
ALL THE WORLD, vt omnis Ecclesiae cura ad unum pertineret, all the care of the
diocese was in the Bishop, and therefore all the power, for it was
unimaginable that the burden should be laid on the Bishop, and the strength put
into the hands of the Presbyters. * And so S. Ignatius styles them, [(...),]
Assessors, and Counselors to the Bishop. But yet if we take our estimate from
Ignatius, The Bishop is THE RULER, without him though all concurred, yet
nothing could be done, nothing attempted; The Bishop was Superior in ALL POWER
and AUTHORITY, He was to be obeyed in ALL THINGS, and contradicted in NOTHING;
The Bishops judgment was to sway, and nothing must seem Ad Trallian. Ad
Magnes.
pleasing to the Presbyters that was cross to the Bishops sentence: this, and
a great deal more which I have formerly made use of, is in Ignatius; And now
let their assistance and Counsel extend as far as it will, the Bishops
authority is invulnerable. But I have already enough discussed this instance of
S. Hierome's.. thither I refer the Reader.

2. But S. Cyprian must do this business for us, if any man, for of all the
Bishops, he did acts of the greatest condescension, and seeming declination of
Episcopal authority. But let us see the worst. Ad id vero quod scripserunt
mihi compresbyteri nostri Epist. 6.
.... solus rescribere nihil potui, quando a primordio Episcopatus mei statuerim
nihil sine consilio vestro, and sine consensu plebis meae privata sententia
gerere. And again, quamvis mihi videantur debere Epist. 19.
pacem accipere, tamen ad consultum vestrum eos dimisi, ne videar aliquid
temere praesumere. And a third time, Quae res cum omnium nostrum consilium
Epist. 18.
and sententiam spectet, praejudicare ego and soli mihi rem communem vindicare
non audeo. These are the greatest steps of Episcopal humility that I find in
materia juridica, The sum whereof is this, that S. Cyprian did consult his
Presbyters and Clergy in matters of consequence, and resolved to do nothing
without their advice. But then, consider also, it was, statui apud me, I have
resolved with my self to do nothing without your Counsel. It was no
necessity ab extra, no duty, no Sanction of holy Church that bound him to such
a modesty, it was his own voluntary act. 2. It was as well Diaconorum, as
Presbyterorum consilium that he would have in conjunction, as appears by the
titles of the sixth and eighteenth Epistles; Cyprianus Presbyter is, ac
DIACONIS fratribus salutem: So that here the Presbyters can no more challenge a
power of regiment in common, then the Deacons, by any Divine law, or Catholic
practice. 3. S. Cyprian also would actually have the consent of the people too,
and that will as well disturb the Ius Divinum of an independent Presbytery, as
of an independent Episcopacy.

But indeed neither of them both need to be much troubled, for all this was
voluntary in S. Cyprian, like Moses, qui cum in potestate sua habuit vt solus
possit praeesse populo, seniores elegit (to use S. Hierome's expression) who
when it was in his power alone to rule the people, yet chose seaventy Elders
for in 1. ad Titum.
assistants. For as for S. Cyprian, this very Epistle cleares it that no part
of his Episcopal authority was impaired. For he shows what himself alone
could do. Fretus igitur dilectione vestra, and religione, quam satis novi, his
literis and hortor and mando etc. I entreat and COMMAND you.... vice mea
fungamini circa gerenda ea quae administratio religiosa deposcit, Be my
substitutes in the administration of Church affairs. He intreates them pro
dilectione, because they loved him, he COMMANDS THEM PRO RELIGIONE, by their
religion; for it was a piece of their religion to obey him, and in him was the
government of his Church, else how could he have put the Presbyters, and
Deacons in substitution?

* Add to this; It was the custom of the Church that although the Bishop did
only impose hands in the ordination of Clerks, yet the Clergy did approve, and
examine the persons to be ordained, and it being a thing of public interest,
it was then not thought fit to be a personal action both in preparation, and
ministration too (and for this S. Chrysostom was accused in Concilio nefario
[as the title of the edition of it, expresses it] that he made ordinations
(...)) yet when S. Ius Graecc Romans page 556.
Cyprian saw occasion for it, he did ordain without the consent of the Clergy
of his Church, for so he ordained Celerinus, so he ordained Optatus, and
Saturus, when himself was from his Church, and in great want of Clergymen to
assist in the ministration of the daily offices. *** He did as much in
jurisdiction too, and censures; for HIMSELF did excommunicate Felicissimus and
Augendus, and Repostus, and Irene, and Paula, as appears in his 38, and 39
epistles; and tells Epist. 65.
Rogatianus that he might have done as much to the petulant Deacon that abused
him by virtue of his Episcopal authority. And the same power singly, and
solely, he exercised in his acts of favor and absolution; Vnus atque alius
Epist. 55.
OBNITENTE PLEBE ET CONTRADICENTE, MEA tamen FACILITATE suscepti sunt. Indeed
here is no contradiction of the Clergy expressed, but yet the absolution said
to be his owneact, against the people and without the Clergy. For he alone was
the JUDGE, insomuch that he declared that it was the cause of Schism and
heresy that the Bishop was not obeyed, nec UNUs in Ecclesia ad tempus
Sacerdos, and ad tempus IUDEX VICE CHRISTI COGITATUR, ibidem.
and that ONE high Priest in a Church, and JUDGE INSTEAD OF CHRIST is not
admitted. So that the Bishop must be ONE, and that ONE must be JUDGE, and to
acknowledge more, in S. Cyprians Lexicon is called schism and heresy. Farther
yet, this Iudicatory of the Bishop is independent, and responsive to none but
Christ. Actum suum disponit, and dirigit Vnusquisque Episcopus rationem
propositi sui Domino Epist. 52.
redditurus, and again, habetin Ecclesiae administratione Epist. 72.
voluntatis suae arbitrium liberum unusquisque Praepositus: rationem actus sui
Domino redditurus. The Bishop is Lord of his own actions, and may do what
seems good in his own eyes, and for his actions he is to account to Christ.

This general account is sufficient to satisfy the allegations out of the
6th, and 18th epistles, and indeed, the whole Question. But for the 18th
epistle, there is something of peculiar answer. For first, It was a case of
public concernement, and therefore he would so comply with the public
interest as to do it by public counsel. 2ly, It was a necessity of times
that made this case peculiar. NECESSITAS TEMPORUM facit ut non temere pacem
demus, they are the first words of the next epistle, which is of the same
matter; for if the lapsi had been easily, and without a public and solemn
trial reconciled, it would have made Gentile Sacrifices frequent, and
Martyrdom but seldom. 3ly, The common counsel which S. Cyprian here said he
would expect, was the Council of the Confessors, to whom for a peculiar honor
it was indulged that they should be interested in the public assoyling of such
penitents who were overcome with those fears which the Confessors had
overcome. So that this is evidently an act of positive, and temporary
discipline; and as it is no disadvantage to the power of the Bishop, so to be
sure, no advantage to the Presbyter.

* But the clause of objection from the 19th epistle is yet unanswered, and
that runs something higher,.... tamen ad consultum vestrum eos dimisi ne videar
aliquid temere praesumere. It is called presumption to reconcile the penitents
without the advice of those to whom he writ. But from this we are fairly
delivered by the title. Cypriano, and Compresbyteris Carthagini consistentibus;
Caldonius, salutem. It was not the epistle of Cyprian to his Presbyters, but of
Caldonius one of the suffragan Bishops of Numidia to his Metropolitan; and now,
what wonder if he call it presumption to do an act of so public consequence
without the advice of his Metropolitan. He was bound to consult him by the
Canons Apostolical, and so he did, and no harm done to the present Question,
of the Bishops sole and independent power, and unmixt with the conjunct
interest of the Presbytery, who had nothing to do beyond ministry, counsel,
and assistance.

3. In all Churches where a Bishops seat was, there were not always a College
of Presbyters, but only in the greatest Churches; for sometimes in the lesser
Cities there were but two. Esse oportet, and aliquantos Presbyteros, ut bini
sint per Ecclesias, and unus incivitate Episcopus. So S. Ambrose, sometimes
there was but one in a Church. Posthumianus in In 1. Timoth. 3.
the third Council of Carthage put the case. Deinde qui unum [Presbyterum]
habuerit, numquid debet illi ipse unus Presbyter auferri? The Church of Hippo
had but one. Valerius was the Bishop, and Austin was the Priest; and after him
Austin was the Bishop, and Eradius the Priest. Sometimes not one, as in the
case Aurelius put in the same Council I now cited, of a Church that had never
a Presbyter to be consecrated Bishop in the place of him that dyed; and once at
Hippo they had none, even then when the people snatched S. Austin and carried
him to Valerius to be ordained. In these cases I hope it will not be denied but
the Bishop was Judge alone, I am sure he had but little company, sometimes none
at all.

4. But suppose it had been always done that Presbyters were consulted in
matters of great difficulty, and possibility of Scandal, for so S. Ambrose
intimates, Ecclesia seniores habuit sine quorum Consilio nihil gerebatur in
Ecclesia (understand, in these 1. Tim. 1.
Churches where Presbyteries were fixed) yet this might be necessary, and was so
indeed in some degree at first, which in succession as it proved troublesome to
the Presbyters; so unnecessary and impertinent to the Bishops. At first I say
it might be necessary. For they were times of persecution, and temptation, and
if both the Clergy and people too were not complied withal in such exigence of
time, and agonies of spirit, it was the way to make them relapse to Gentilisme;
for a discontented spirit will hide it self, and take sanctuary in the reeds
and mud of Nilus, rather then not take complacence in an imaginary security and
revenge. 2. As yet there had been scarce any Synods to determine cases of
public difficulty, and what they could not receive from public decision, it
was fitting they should supply by the maturity of a Consiliary assistance, and
deliberation. For although, by the Canons of the Apostles, Bishops were bound
twice a year to celebrate Synods, yet persecution intervening, they were
rather twice a year a (...) then (...), a dispersion then a Synod. 3. Although
Synods had been as frequently convened as was intended by the Apostles, yet it
must be length of time, and a successive experience that must give opportunity
and ability to give general rules for the emergency of all particulars, and
therefore till the Church grew of some considerable age, a fixed standing
College of Presbyters was more requisite then since it has been, when the
frequency of General Counsels, and Provincial Synods, and the peace of the
Church, and the innumerable volumes of the Fathers, and Decretalls of Bishops,
and a digest of Ecclesiastical Constitutions, has made the personal
assistance of Presbyters unnecessary. 4. When necessity required not their
presence and Counsel, their own necessity required that they should attend
their several cures. For let it be considered; they that would now have a
College of Presbyters assist the Bishop whether they think of what follows.
For either they must have Presbyters ordained without a title, which I am sure
they have complained of these threescore years, or else they must be forced to
Non-residence. For how else can they assist the Bishop in the ordinary, and
daily occurrences of the Church, unless either they have no cure of their own,
or else neglect it? And as for the extraordinary, either the Bishop is to
consult his Metropolitan, or he may be assisted by a Synod, if the Canons
already constitute do not aid him, but in all these cases the Presbytery is
impertinent.

5. As this assistance of Presbyters was at first for necessity, and after by
Custom it grew a Law; so now retro, first the necessity failed, and then the
desuetude abrogated the Law, which before, custom had established. [quod qua
negligentia obsolever Vbi supra.
it nescio] says S. Ambrose, he knew not how it came to be obsolete, but so it
was, it had expired before his time. Not but that Presbyters were still in
Mother-Churches (I mean in Great ones) In Ecclesia enim habemus Senatum
nostrum, actum Presbyterorum, In Isaiae c. 3.
we have still (says S. Hierome) in the Church our Senate, a College, or
Chapter of Presbyters, (he was then at Rome, or Jerusalem) but they were not
consulted in Church affairs, and matter of jurisdiction, that was it, that S.
Ambrose wondered how it came to pass. And thus it is to this day. In our Mother
Churches we have a Chapter too, but the Bishop consults them not in matters of
ordinary jurisdiction, just so it was in S. Ambrose his time, and therefore our
Bishops have altered no custom in this particular, the alteration was pregnant
even before the end of the four general Counsels, and therefore is no
violation of a divine right, for then most certainly a contrary provision would
have been made in those conventions, wherein so much sanctity, and authority,
and Catholicisme and severe discipline were conjunct; and then besides, it is
no innovation in practice which pretends so fair antiquity, but however it was
never otherwise then voluntary in the Bishops, and positive discipline in the
Church, and convenience in the thing for that present, and Council in the
Presbyters, and a trouble to the Presbyters persons, and a disturbance of their
duties when they came to be fixed upon a particular charge.

* One thing more before I leave. I find a Canon of the Council of Hispalis
objected. Episcopus Presbyteris solus honorem dare potest, solus autem auferre
Can. 6.
non potest. A Bishop may alone ordain a Priest, a Bishop may not alone depose
a Priest. Therefore in censures there was in the Primitive Church a necessity
of conjunction of Presbyters with the Bishop in imposition of censures.

* To this I answer, first it is evident, that he that can give an honor, can
also take it away, if any body can; for there is in the nature of the thing no
greater difficulty in pulling down, then in raising up. It was wont always to
be accounted easier; therefore this Canon requiring a conjunct power in
deposing Presbyters is a positive constitution of the Church, founded indeed
upon good institution, but built upon no deeper foundation, neither of nature
or higher institution, then its own present authority.

But that is enough, for we are not now in question of divine right, but of
Catholic and Primitive practice. To it therefore I answer, that the conjunct
hand required to pull down a Presbyter, was not the Chapter, or College of
Presbyters; but a company of Bishops, a Synodall sentence, and determination,
for so the Canon runs, qui profecto nec ab uno damnari, nec uno judicante
poterunt honoris sui privilegiis exui: sed praesentati SYNODALI IUDICIO, quod
canon de illis praeceperit definiri. And the same thing was determined in the
Greeks Council of Carthage. If a Presbyter or a Deacon be accused, Can. 20.
their own Bishop shall judge them, not alone, but with the assistance of six
Bishops more, in the case of a Presbyter; three, of a Deacon; (...). But the
causes of the other Clergy the Bishop of the place must ALONE hear and
determine them. So that by this Canon, in some things the Bishop might not be
alone, but then his assistants were Bishops, not Presbyters, in other things he
alone was judge without either, and yet his sentences must not be clancular,
but in open Court, in the full Chapter; for his Presbyters must be present; and
so it is determined for Africa in the fourth Council of Carthage, Vt Episcopus
nullius causam audiat absque praesentia Can. 23.
Clericorum suorum: alioquin irrita erit sententia Episcopi nisi praesentia
Clericorum confirmetur. Here is indeed a necessity of the presence of the
Clergy of his Church where his Consistory was kept, least the sentence should
be clandestine, and so illegal, but it is nothing but praesentia Clericorum,
for it is sententia Episcopi, the Bishops sentence, and the Clerks presence
only; for (...), the Bishop ALONE might give sentence in the causes of the
inferior Clergy, even by this Canon it self, which is used for objection
against the Bishops sole jurisdiction.

*** I know nothing now to hinder our process; for the Bishops jurisdiction is
clearly left in his own hand, and the Presbyters had no share in it, but by
delegation and voluntary assumption. Now I proceed in the maine question.

WE have seen what Episcopacy is in it self, 45. So that the government of
the Church by Bishops was believed necessary.
now from the same principles let us see what it is to us. And first; Antiquity
taught us it was simply necessary, even to the being and constitution of a
Church. That runs high, but we must follow our leaders. * S. Ignatius is
express in this question. Qui intra altar est, mundus est, quare and
obtemperat Episcopo, and Sacerdotibus. Qui vero foris Epist. ad Tral.
est hic is est* qui sine Episcopo, Sacerdote, and Diacono quicquam agit, and
ejusmodi inquinatam habet conscientiam, and infideli deterior est. He that is
within the Altar, that is, within the Communion of the Church, he is pure, for
he obeyes the Bishop, and the Priests. But he that is without, that is, does
any thing without his Bishop and the Clergy, he has a filthy conscience and is
worse then an infidel. NECESSE itaque est, quicquid facitis, ut SINE EPISCOPO
NIHIL faciatis. It is NECESSARY that what ever ye do, ye be sure to do
nothing without the Bishop. Quid enim aliud est Episcopus, etc. For what else
is a Bishop but he that is greater then all power? So that the obeying the
Bishop is the necessary condition of a Christian, and Catholic communion; he
that does not, is worse then an infidel. The same also he affirms again.
Quotquot enim Christi sunt partium Episcopi, Epist. ad Philadelph.
qui vero ab illo declinant, and cum maledict is communionem amplectuntur, hi
cum illis excidentur. All them that are on Christ's side, are on the Bishops
side, but they that communicate with accursed Schismatics, shall be cut off
with them. * If then we will be Christ's servants, we must be obedient and
subordinate to the Bishop. It is the condition of Christianity. We are not
Christians else. So is the intimation of S. Ignatius. * As full and pertinent
is the peremptory resolution of S. Cyprian in that admirable epistle of his ad
Lapsos, where after he had Epist. 27. alibi.
spoken how Christ instituted the honor of Episcopacy in concrediting the
Keys to Peter and the other Apostles, Inde (says he) per temporum and
successionum vices, Episcoporum ordinatio, and. ECCLESIAE RATIO decurrit, VT
ECCLESIA SUPER EPISCOPOS CONSTITUATUR, and omnis actus Ecclesiae per EOSDEM
PRAEPOSITOS gubernetur. Hence is it, that by several succcession of Bishops
the Church is continued, so that the CHURCH HAS IT IS BEING, OR CONSTITUTION BY
BISHOPS, and every act of Ecclesiastical regiment is to be disposed by them.
Cum hoc itaque divina lege fundatum sit, miror etc. Since therefore this is so
ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW OF GOD, I wonder any man should question it, etc. And
therefore as in all buildings, the foundation being gone, the fabric falls, so
IF YE TAKE AWAY BISHOPS, the Church must ask a writing of divorce from God,
for it can no longer be called a Church. This account we have from S. Cyprian,
and he reenforces again upon the same charge in his Epist. 69.
Epistle ad Florentium Pupianum, where he makes a Bishop to be ingredient into
the DEFINITION of a Church. [Ecclesia est plebs sacerdoti adunata, and Pastori
suo Grex adhaerens, The Church is a flock adhering to it is Pastor, and a people
united to their Bishop] for that so he means by Sacerdos, appears in the words
subjoined, Vnde and scire debes Episcopum in Ecclesia esse, and Ecclesiam in
Episcopo, and si qui Cum EPISCOPO NON SIT IN ECCLESIA NON ESSE, and frustra
sibi blandiri eos qui pacem cum Sacerdotibus Dei non habentes obrepunt, and
latenter apud quosaam communicarese credunt etc. As a Bishop is in the Church,
so the Church is in the Bishop, and he that does not communicate with the
Bishop is not in the Church; and therefore they vainly flatter themselves that
think their case fair and good, if they communicate in conventicles, and
forsake their Bishop.

And for this cause the holy Primitives were so confident, and zealous for a
Bishop, that they would rather expose themselves and all their tribes to a
persecution, then to the greater misery, the want of Bishops. Fulgentius tells
an excellent story to this purpose. When Frasamund King of Byzac in Africa vide
Council. Byzacenum. An. Dom. 504. and Surium die 1. Ianuar. and Baron. in A. D.
504.
had made an edict that no more Bishops should be consecrate; to this purpose
that the Catholic faith might expire (so he was sure it would, if this device
were perfected) vt arescentibus truncis absque palmitibus omnes Ecclesiae
desolarentur, the good Bishops of the Province met together in a Council, and
having considered of the command of the tyrant, Sacra turba Pontificum qui
remanser ant communicato inter se consilio definierunt adversus praeceptum
Regis in omnibus locis celebrare ordinationes Pontificum, cogitantes aut Regis
iracundiam, si qua forsan existeret, mitigandam, quo facilius ordinatiin suis
plebibus viverent, aut si persecutionis violentia nasceretur, coronandos etiam
fidei confessione, quos dignos inveniebant promotione. It was full of bravery,
and Christian sprite. The Bishops resolved for all the edict against new
ordination of Bishops to obey God, rather then man, and to consecrate Bishops
in all places, hoping the King would be appeased, or if not, yet those whom
they thought worthy of a Mitre were in a fair disposition to receive a Crown
of Martyrdom. They did so. Fit repent communis assumptio, and they all
strived who should be first, and thought a blessing would outstrip the
hindmost. They were sure they might go to heaven (though persecuted) under the
conduct of a Bishop, they knew, without him the ordinary passage was obstructed.

Pius the first, Bishop of Rome, and Martyr, speaking of them that calumniate,
and disgrace their Bishops Epist. 2.
endeavoring to make them infamous, they add (says he) evil to evil, and
grow worse, non intelligentes quod Ecclesia Dei in Sacerdotibus consistit, and
crescit in templum Dei; Not considering that THE CHURCH OF GOD DOES CONSIST, or
is established in BISHOPS, and grows up to a holy Temple? To him I am most
willing to add S. Hierome, because he is often obtruded in defiance of advers.
Lucifer. cap. 4.
the cause. Ecclesiae salus in summi Sacer dot is dignitate pendet, The safety
of the Church depends upon the Bishops dignity.

THE Reason which S. Hierome gives, presses this 46. For they are schismatics
that separate from their Bishop.
business to a further particular. For if an eminent dignity, and an
Unmatchable power be not given to him, tot efficientur schismata, quot
Sacerdotes. So that he makes Bishops therefore necessary because without them
the Unity of a Church cannot be preserved; and we know that unity, and being,
are of equal extent, and if the Unity of the Church depends upon the Bishop,
then where there is no Bishop, no pretense to a Church; and therefore to
separate from the Bishop makes a man at least a Schismatic; For Unity which
the Fathers press so often, they make to be dependant on the Bishop. Nihil sit
in vobis quod possit vos dirimere, sed Vnimini Episcopo, subjecti Deo per illum
in Christo (says S. Ignatius.) Let nothing divide you, but be united to your
Bishop, Epist. ad Magnes.
being subject to God in Christ through your Bishop. And it is his conge to the
people of Smyrna to whom he writ in his epistle to Polycarpus, opto vos semper
valere in Deo nostro Jesus Christo, in quo manete per Vnitatem Dei and EPISCOPI,
Farewell in Christ Jesus, in whom remain by the Unity of God and of the
BISHOP. * Quanto vos beatiores judico qui dependetis ab illo [Episcopo] vt
Ecclesia a Domino Jesus, Ad Ephesians.
and Dominus a Patre suo, vt omnia per Vnitatem consentiant. Blessed people are
ye that depend upon your Bishop, as the Church on Christ, and Christ on God,
that all things may consent in Unity.

* Neque enim aliunde haereses obortae sunt, aut nata sunt schismata, quam inde
quod Sacerdoti Dei non obtemperatur, S. Cyprian. ep. 55.
nec unus in Ecclesia ad tempus Sacerdos, and ad tempus Iudex vice Christi
cogitatur. Hence come SCHISMS, hence spring HERESIES that the Bishop is not
obeyed, and admitted alone to be the high Priest, alone to be the Judge. The
same, S. Cyprian Epist. 69.
repeates again, and by it, we may see his meaning clearer. Qui vos audit, me
audit etc: Indeenim haereses and schismata obortae sunt and oriuntur, dum
Episcopus qui unus est, and Ecclesiae praeest superba quorundam praesumptione
contemnitur, and homo dignatione Dei honoratus, indignus hominibus judicatur.
The pride and peevish haughtiness of some factious people that contemn their
Bishops is the cause of all heresy and Schism. And therefore it was so
strictly forbidden by the Ancient Canons, that any Man should have any
meetings, or erect an Altar out of the communion of his Bishop, that if any man
proved delinquent in this particular, he was punished with the highest
censures, as appears in the 32 Canon of the Apostles, in the 6th Canon of the
Council of Gangra, the 5th Canon of the Council of Antioch, and the great
Council of Chalcedon, all Act. 4.
which I have before cited. The sum is this, The Bishop is the band, and
ligature of the Churches Unity; and separation from the Bishop is (...), as
Theodorets expession is; a Symbol of faction, and he that separates is a
Schismatic.

But how if the Bishop himself be a heretic, or schismatic? May we not then
separate? Yes, if he be judged so by a Synod of Bishops, but then he is sure to
be deposed too, and then in these cases no separation from a Bishop. For till
he be declared so, his communion is not to be forsaken by the subjects of his
diocese, least they by so doing become their Judges judge, and when he is
declared so, no need of withdrawing from obedience to the Bishop, for the
heretic, or schismatic must be no longer Bishop. * But let the case be what
it will be, no separation from a Bishop, ut sic, can be lawful; and yet if
there were a thousand cases in which it were lawful to separate from a Bishop,
yet in no case is it lawful to separate from Episcopacy; That is the
quintessence, and spirit of schism, and a direct overthrow to Christianity,
and a confronting of a Divine institution.

* BUt is it not also heresy? Aerius was condemned. 47. And Heretics,
for heresy by the Catholic Church. The heresy from whence the Aerians were
denominated was, sermo furiosus magis quam humanae conditionis, and dicebat,
Quid est Episcopus ad Presbyterum, nihil differt hic ab illo. A mad, and an
unmanly heresy, to say that a Bishop, and a Priest are all one. So Epiphanius.
Assumpsit autem Ecclesia, and IN TOTO haeres. 75.
MUNDO ASSENSUS FACTUS EST, antequam esset Aerius, and qui ab ipso appellantur
Aeriani. And the good Catholic Father is so angry at the heretic Aerius, that
he thinks his name was given him by Providence, and he is called Aerius, ab
aerijs spiritibus pravitatis, for he was possessed with an unclean spirit, he
could never else been the inventer of such heretical pravity. S. Austin also
reckons him in the accursed roll of heretics, and adds at the conclusion of
his Catalogue, that he is NO CATHOLIC CHRISTIAN that assents to any of the
foregoing Doctrines, amongst which, this is one of the principal. Philastrius
does as much for him.

But against this it will be objected. first, That heresies in the Primitive
Catalogues are of a large extent, and every dissent from a public opinion, was
esteemed heresy. 2ly, Aerius was called heretic, for denying prayer for the
dead. And why may he not be as blameless in equalling a Bishop, and a
Presbyter, as in that other, for which he also is condemned by Epiphanius, and
S. Austin. 3ly, He was never condemned by any Council, and how then can he be
called heretic?

I answer; that dissent from a public, or a received opinion was never called
heresy, unless the contrary truth was indeed a part of Catholic doctrine.
For the Fathers many of them did so, as S. Austin from the Millenary opinion;
yet none ever reckoned them in the Catalogues of heretics; but such things
only set them down there, which were either directly opposite to Catholic
belief, though in minoribus articulis, or to a holy life. 2ly, It is true that
Epiphanius and S. Austin reckon his denying prayer for the dead to be one of
his own opinions, and heretical. But I cannot help it if they did, let him
and them agree it, they are able to answer for themselves. But yet they accused
him also of Arianisme; and shall we therefore say that Arianisme was no
heresy, because the Fathers called him heretic in one particular upon a wrong
principal? We may as well say this, as deny the other. 3ly, He was not
condemned by any Council. No. For his heresy was ridiculous, and a scorn to
all wise men; as Epiphanius observes, and it made no long continuance, neither
had it any considerable party. * But yet this is certain, that Epiphanius, and
Philastrius, and S. Austin called this opinion of Aerius a heresy and against
the Catholic belief. And themselves affirm that the Church did so; and then
it would be considered, that it is but a sad employment to revive old heresies,
and make them a piece of the New religion.

And yet after all this, if I mistake not, although Aerius himself was so
inconsiderable as not to be worthy noting in a Council, yet certainly the one
half of his error is condemned for heresy in one of the four General
Counsels, viz. the first Council of Constantinople. (...) Can. 6.
We call all them heretics whom the Ancient Church has condemned, and whom we
shall anathematize. Will not Aerius come under one of these titles for a
condemned heretic? Then see forward. (...). Here is enough for Aerius and all
his hyperaspists, new and old; for the holy Council condemns them for
heretics who do indeed confess the true faith, but separate from their
Bishops, and make conventicles apart from his Communion. Now this I the rather
urge because an Act of Parliament made Io of Elizabeth does make this Council,
and the other three of Nice, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, the rule of judging
heresies.

I end this particular with the saying of the Council of Paris against the
Acephali (who were the branch of a Crabstock and something like Aerius,) cited
by Burchard; Nulla ratione Clerici aut Sacerdotes lib. 2. decret. cap. 226.
habendi sunt, qui sub nullius Episcopi disciplina and providentia gubernantur.
Tales enim Acephalos, id est sine capite Priscae Ecclesiae consuetudo
nuncupavit. They are by no means to be accounted Clergymen, or Priests, that
will not be governed by a Bishop. For such men the Primitive Church called
(...), that is, headless, wittlesse people.

This only. Acephali was the title of a Sect, a formal heresy, and condemned
by the Ancient Church, say the Fathers of the Council of Paris. Now if we can
learn exactly what they were, it may perhaps be another conviction for the
necessity of Episcopal regiment. Nicephorus can best inform us. lib. 18. ca.
45 Eccles. hist.
Eodem tempore, and Acephali, quorum dux Severus Antiochenus fuit etc: Severus
of Antioch was the first broacher of this heresy. But why were they called
Acephali? id est, sine capite, quem sequuntur haeretici; Nullus enim eorum
reperitur author a quo exorti sunt (says Isidore). But this cannot be, for
their lib. 8. cap. 5. Etymol.
head is known, Severus was the heresiarch. But then why are they called
Acephali? Nicephorus gives this reason, and withal a very particular account
of their heresy, Acephali autem ob eam causam dicti sunt, quod sub Episcopis
non fuerint. They refused to live under Bishops. Thence they had their Name.
what was their heresy? They denied the distinction of Natures in Christ. That
was one of their heresies, but they had more; for they were trium capitulorum
in Chalcedone impugnatores, says Isidore, they opposed three Canons of the
Council of Chalcedon. One we have heard, what their other vbi supra.
heresies were, we do not so well know, but by the Canon of the Council of
Paris, and the intimation of their name we are guided to the knowledge of a
second; They refused to live under the government of a Bishop. And this also
was impugnatio unius articuli in Chalcedone, for the eighth Canon of the
Council of Chalcedon commands that the Clergy should be under Episcopal
government. But these Acephali would not, they were antiepiscopall men, and
therefore they were condemned heretics; condemned, In the Council of Paris,
of Sevill, and of Chalcedon.

But the more particular account that Nicephorus gives of them I will now
insert, because it is of great use. Proinde Episcopis, and Sacerdotibus apud
eos defunctis, neque baptismus juxta solennem, atque receptum Ecclesiae morem
apud eos administratur, neque oblatio, autres aliqua divina facta,
ministeriumve Ecclesiasticum, sicuti mos est, celebratum est. Communionem vero
illi a plurimo tempore asservatam habentes ferijs pascalibus in minutissimas
incisam parts convenientibus adse hominibus dederunt. Quo temport quam quisque
voluisset placitam sibi sumebat potestatem. Et proptere a quod quilibet, quod
si visum essct, fidei insertum volebat, quamplurima defectorum, atque
haereticorum turba exortaest. It is a story worthy observation. When any Bishop
dyed they would have no other consecrated in succession, and therefore could
have no more Priests when any of them dyed. But how then did they to baptize
their Children? Why, they were feign to make shift, and do it without any
Church-solemnity. But, how did they for the Holy Sacrament, for that could not
be consecrated without a Priest, and he not ordained without a Bishop? True,
but therefore they, while they had a Bishop, got a great deal of bread
consecrated, and kept a long time, and when Easter came, cut it into small
bitts, or crummes rather, to make it go the farther, and gave it to their
people. And must we do so too? God forbid. But how did they when all that was
gone? For crummes would not last always. The story specifies it not, but yet I
suppose they then got a Bishop for their necessity to help them to some more
Priests, and some more crummes; for I find the Council of Sevill the Fathers
saying, Ingressus est ad nos quidem ex haeresi Can. 12.
Acephalorum Episcopus; They had then it seems got a Bishop, but this they
would seldom have, and never but when their necessity drove them to it. But
was this all the inconvenience of the want of Bishops? No. For every man (says
Nicephorus) might do what he list, and if he had a mind to it, might put his
fancy into the Creed, and thence came innumerable troops of Schismatics and
Heretics. So that this device was one simple heresy in the root, but it was
forty heresies in the fruit, and branches; clearly proving that want of
Bishops is the cause of all Schism, and recreant opinions that are imaginable.

I sum this up with the saying of S. Clement Epist. 3.
the Disciple of S. Peter, Si autem vobis Episcopis non obedierint omnes
Presbyteri, etc. tribus, and linguae non obtemperaverint, non solum infames,
sed and extorres a regno Dei, and consortio fidelium, ac a limitibus Sancti Dei
Ecclesiae alieni erunt. All Priests, and Clergymen, and People, and Nations,
and Languages that do not obey their Bishop shall be shut forth of the
communion of Holy Church here, and of Heaven hereafter. It runs high, but I
cannot help it, I do but translate Ruffinus, as he before translated S.
Clement.. 48. And Bishops were always in the Church, men of great Honor.


IT seems then we must have Bishops. But must we have Lord Bishops too? That
is the question now, but such an one as the Primitive piety could never have
imagined. For, could they, to whom Bishops were placed in a right and a true
light, they who believed, and saw them to be the Fathers of their souls, the
Guardian of their life and manners (as King Edgar called S. Dunstan) the guide
of their consciences, the instruments and conveyances of all the Blessings
heaven uses to power upon us, by the ministration of the holy Gospel; would
they, that thought their lives a cheap exchange for a free, and open communion
with a Catholic Bishop; would they have contested upon an aerie title, and the
imaginary privilege of an honor, which is far less then their spiritual
dignity, but infinitely less then the burden, and charge of the souls of all
their Diocese? Charity thinks nothing too much, and that love is but little,
that grutches at the good words a Bishopric carries with it.

However; let us see whether titles of honor be either unfit in themselves to
be given to Bishops, or what the guise of Christendom has been in her
spiritual heraldry.

1. S. Ignatius in his Epistle to the Church of Smyrna gives them this command.
Honora Episcopum ut Principem Sacerdotum, imaginem Dei referentem. Honor the
Bishop as the image of God, as the PRINCE OF PRIESTS. Now since honor, and
excellency are terms of mutual relation, and all excellency that is in men,
and things, is but a ray of divine excellency; so far as they participate of
God, so far they are honorable. Since then the Bishop carries the impresse
of God upon his forehead, and bears Gods image, certainly this participation of
such perfection makes him very honorable. And since honor est in honorante, it
is not enough that the Bishop is honorable in himself, but it tells us our
duty, we must honor him, we must do him honor: and of all the honors in the
world, that of words is the cheapest, and the least.

S. Paul speaking of the honor due to the Prelates of the Church, (...). Let
them be accounted worthy of double honor. And one of the honors that he there
means is a costly one, an honor of Maintenance, the other must certainly be an
honor of estimate, and that is cheapest. * The Council of Sardis Can. 10.
Graec.
speaking of the several steps and capacities of promotion to the height of
Episcopacy, uses this expression, (...). He that shall be found worthy of so
Divine a Priesthood, let him be advanced to the HIGHEST HONOR. * Ego procidens
ad pedes ejus rogabam, excusans me, and declinans HONOREM CATHEDRAE, and
potestatem, (says S. Clement, when S. Peter Epist. 1. ad Iacobum.
would have advanced him to the Honor and power of the Bishops chair.) But in
the third epistle speaking of the dignity of Aaron the High Priest, and then by
analogy, of the Bishop, who although he be a Minister in the order of
Melchisedek, yet he has also the honor of Aaron, Omnis enim Pontifex sacro
crismate perunctus, and in civitate constitutus, and in Scripturis sacris
conditus, charus and preciosus hominibus oppido esse debet. Every High Priest
ordained in the City (viz. a Bishop) ought forthwith to be Dear, and Precious
in the eyes of men. Quem quasi Christi locum tenentem honorare omnes debent,
eique servire, and obedientes ad salutem suam fideliter existere, scientes quod
sive honor, sive injuria quae ei desertur, in Christum redundat, and a Christo
in Deum. The Bishop is Christ's vicegerent, and therefore he is to be obeyed,
knowing that whether it be honor, or injury that is done to the Bishop, it is
done to Christ, and so to God. * And indeed what is the saying of our blessed
Savior himself? He that despises you, despises me. If Bishops be Gods
Ministers and in higher order then the rest, then although all discountenance,
and disgrace done to the Clergy reflect upon Christ, yet what it done to the
Bishop is far more, and then there is the same reason of the honor. And if
so, then the Question will prove but an odd one; even this, whether Christ be
to be honored or no, or depressed to the common estimate of Vulgar people? for
if the Bishops be, then he is. This is the condition of the Question.

2. Consider we, that all Religions, and particularly all Christianity did
give titles of honor to their Highpriests, and Bishops respectively. * I
shall not need to instance in the great honor of the Priestly tribe among the
Jews, and how highly Honorable Aaron was in proportion. Prophets were called
[Lords] in holy Scripture. [Art not thou MY LORD Elijah?] said Obed Edom to the
Prophet. [Knowest thou not that God will take THY LORD from thy head this day?]
said the children in the Prophets Schools. So it was then. And in the New
Testament we find a Prophet HONORED every where, but in his own Country. And to
the Apostles and Presidents of Churches greater titles of honor given, then
was ever given to man by secular complacence and insinuation. ANGELS, and
Apocal. 1. 1. Corinthians. 9.
GOVERNORS, and FATHERS OF OUR FAITH, and STARS, LIGHT OF THE WORLD, the
CROWN OF THE CHURCH, APOSTLES OF John 10.
JESUS CHRIST, nay, GODS, viz. to whom the word of God came; and of the
compellation of Apostles, particularly, S. Hierom says, that when S. Paul
called himself the Apostle of Jesus Christ, it was as Magnifically spoken, as
if he had said, Praefectus In Titum.
praetorio Augusti Caesaris, Magister exercitus Tiberii Imperatoris; And yet
Bishops are Apostles, and so called in Scripture. I have prooved that already.

Indeed our blessed Savior in the case of the two sons of Zebedee, forbad
them to expect by virtue of their Apostolate any Princely titles, in order to a
Kingdom, and an earthly Principality. For that was it which the ambitious
woman sought for her sons, viz. fair honor, and dignity in an earthly
Kingdom; for such a Kingdom they expected with their Messiah. To this their
expectation, our Saviors answer is a direct antithesis; And that made the
Apostles to be angry at the two Petitioners, as if they had meant to supplant
the rest, and yet the best preferment from them, to wit, in a temporal
Kingdom. No; (says our blessed Savior) ye are all deceived. [The Kings of
the Nations indeed do exercise authority, and are called (...), Benefactors
Matthew. 20. Mark 10.
] so the word signifies, [Gracious Lords] so we read it, [But it shall not be
so with you.] what shall not be so with them? shall not they exercise
authority? Luke 22.
[Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his Lord made ruler over his
Household?] Surely the Apostles, or no body. Had Christ authority? Most
certainly. Then so had the Apostles, for Christ gave them his, with a sicut
misit me Pater, etc. Well! the Apostles might, and we know they did exercise
authority. What then shall not be so with them? shall not they be called (...);
Indeed if S. Mark had taken that title upon him in Alexandria, the Ptolomies,
whose Honourary appellative that was, would have questioned him Highly for it.
But if we go to the sense of the word, the Apostles might be Benefactors, and
therefore might be called so. But what then? Might they not be called Gracious
Lords? The word would have done no hurt if it had not been an ensign of a
secular Principality.

For as for the word [Lord] I know no more prohibition for that, then for being
called RABBI, or MASTER, or DOCTOR, or FATHER. What shall we think now? May we
not be called DOCTORS? Matthew. 23. 8, 9. 10. Ephesians. 4.
[God has constituted in his Church Pastors, and Doctors, says S. Paul.]
Therefore we may be called so. But what of the other, the prohibition runs
alike for all, as is evident in the several places of the Gospells, and may no
man be called MASTER, or FATHER? let an answer be thought upon for these, and
the same will serve for the other also without any sensible error. It is not
the word, it is the ambitious seeking of a temporal principality as the issue
of Christianity, and an affixe of the Apostolate that Christ interdicted his
Apostles. * And if we mark it, our B. Savior points it out himself. [The
Princes of the Nations (...), exercise authority over them, and are called
Benefactors, (...). It shall not be so with you. Not so how? Not as the Princes
of the Gentiles, for theirs is a temporal regiment, your Apostolate must be
Spiritual. They rule as Kings, you as fellow servants, (...). He that will be
first amongst you, let him be your Minister, or servant; It seems then among
Christ's Disciples there may be a Superiority, when there is a Minister or
servant; But it must be (...) that this greatness does consist, it must be in
doing the greatest service and ministration that the superiority consists in.
But more particularly, it must be (...). It must not be [as the Princes of the
Gentiles] but it must be [as the son of man] so Luke 22.
Christ says expressly. And how was that? why, he came to Minister and to
serve, and yet in the lowest John 13.
act of his humility (the washing his Disciples feet) he told them, [ye call me
Lord, and Master, and ye say well, for so I am] It may be so with you. Nay it
must be as the son of Man; But then, the being called Rabbi, or Lord, nay the
being Lord in spirituali Magisterio and regimine, in a spiritual
superintendency, and (...), may stand with the humility of the Gospel, and
office of Ministration.

So that now I shall not need to take advantage of the word In locis ubi supra.
(...), which signifies to rule with more then a political regiment, even with
an absolute, and despotick, and is so used in holy Scripture, viz. in sequiorem
partem. God gave authority to Man over the creatures, (...) is the word in the
septuagint, and we know the power that man Genesis 1.
has over beasts, is to kill, and to keep alive. And thus to our blessed
Savior, the power that God gave him over his enemies is expressed by (...).
Psalm. 110.
And this we know how it must be exercised, (...) with a rod of iron, (...).
He shall Psalm. 2.
break them in pieces like a potters vessel. That Is (...). But it shall not be
so with you.

But let this be as true as it will. The answer needs no way to rely upon a
Criticisme. It is clear, that the form of Regiment only is distinguished, not
all Regiment, and authority taken away. (...), but (...), Not as the Kings of
the Gentiles, but as the son of man; so must your regiment be, for sicut
misit me Pater, etc. As my father has sent me, even so send I you. It must be
a government, not for your Impery, but for the service of the Church. So that
it is not for your advancement, but the public ministry that you are put to
rule over the Household.

* And thus the Fathers express the authority and regiment of Bishops. * Qui
vocatur ad Episcopatum non ad Principatum vocatur, sed ad servitutem totius
siae (says Origin.) And S. Hierom; Episcopi Sacer dotes se esse noverint, non
Dominos; And yet S. Hierom homil. 6. in Isai.
himself writing to S. Austin, calls him, Domine vere sancte, and suscipiende
Papa. * Forma Apostolica haec est, Dominatio interdicitur, indicitur
Ministratio. S. Bernard. lib. 10. de considerat.
It is no Principality that the Apostles have, but it is a Ministry; a
Ministry in chief, the officers of which Ministration must govern, and we
must obey. They must govern not in a temporal regiment by virtue of their
Episcopacy, but in a spiritual, not for honor to the Rulers, so much as for
benefit and service to the subject. So S. Austin. Nomen est operis, non
honoris, ut intelligat se non esse lib. 19. de civit. Dei. cap. 19.
Episcopum qui praeesse dilexerit, non prodesse. And in the fourteenth chapter
of the same book, Qui imperant serviunt ijs rebus quibus videntur Imperare. Non
enim dominandi cupidine imperant, sed officio confulendi, nec principandi
superbia, sed providendi misericordia. And all this is intimated in the
Prophetical visions, where the regiment of Christ is designed by the face of a
man; and the Empire of the world, by Beasts. The first is the regiment of a
Father, the second of a King. The first spiritual, the other secular. And of
the Fatherly authority it is that the Prophet says, Instead of Fathers thou
shall have Children, whom thou may make Princes in all lands. This (say the
Fathers) is spoken of the Apostles and their Successors the Bishops, who may be
(...), Princes or Rulers of Churches, not Princes of Kingdoms by virtue or
challenge of their Apostolate. But if this Ecclesiastical rule, or cheifty be
interdicted, I wonder how the Presidents of the Presbyters, the (...) in the
Reformed Churches will acquit themselves? How will their Superiority be
reconciled to the place, though it be but temporary? For is it a sin, if it
continues, and no sin if it lasts but for a week? or is it lawful to sin,
and domineere, and Lord it over their Brethren for a week together? * But
suppose it were, what will they say, that are perpetual Dictators? Calvin was
perpetual president, and Beza, till Danaeus came to Geneva, even for many
years together? * But beyond all this how can the Presbytery which is a fixed
lasting body rule and govern in causes Spiritual and Consistoriall, and that
over all Princes, and Ministers, and people, and that for ever? For is it a
sin in Episcopacy to do so, and not in the Presbytery? If it be lawful
here, then Christ did not interdict it to the Apostles, for who will think that
a Presbytery shall have leave to domineere, and (as they call it now a days)
to Lord it over their Brethren, when a College of Apostles shall not be
suffered to govern? but if the Apostles may govern, then we are brought to a
right understanding of our Saviors saying to the sons of Zebedee, and then
also, their successors, the Bishops may do the same.

If I had any further need of answer or escape, it were easy to pretend, that
this being a particular directory to the Apostles, was to expire with their
persons. So S. Cyprian intimates. Apostoli pari fuere De Vnitat. Eccles.
consortio praediti, and honoris, and dignitatis; and indeed this may be
concluding against the Supremacy of S. Peter's Successors, but will be no ways
pertinent to impugn Episcopal authority. For inter se they might be equal,
and yet Superior to the Presbyters, and the people.

Lastly, [It shall not be so with you] so Christ said, non designando officium,
but Sortem; not their duty, but their lot; intimating that their future
condition should not be honorary, but full of trouble, not advanced, but
persecuted. But I had rather insist on the first answer; in which I desire it
be remembered, that I said, seeking temporal Principality to be forbidden the
Apostles, as an Appendix to the office of an Apostle. For in other capacities
Bishops are as receptive of honor and temporal principalities as other men.
Bishops vt sic are not secular Princes, must not seek for it; But some secular
Princes may be Bishops, as in Germany, and in other places to this day they
are. For it is as unlawful for a Bishop to have any Land, as to have a
Country, and a single acre is no more due to the Order, then a Province; but
both these may be conjunct in the same person, though still by virtue of
Christ's precept, the functions and capacities must be distinguished; according
to the saying of Synesius (...). To confound and intermixe the Kingdom and the
Priesthood, is to join things incompossible and inconsistent, Inconsistent (I
say) not in person, but absolutely discrepant in function.

3. Consider we, that S. Peter, when he speaks of the duteous subordination of
Sarah to her Husband Abraham, he propunds her as an example to all married
women, in these words [shee obeyed Abraham, and called him Lord] why was this
spoken to Christian women, but that they should do so too? And is it
imaginable that such an Honorable compellation as Christ allows every woman
to give to her husband, a Mechanic, a hard-handed artisan, he would forbid to
those eminent pillars of his Church, those lights of Christendom whom he
really endued with a plenitude of power for the regiment of the Catholic
Church. Credat Apella.

4. PASTOR, and FATHER, are as honorable titles as any. They are honorable in
Scripture. Honor thy Father etc: Thy Father, in all senses. They are also made
sacred by being the appellatives of Kings, and Bishops, and that not only in
secular addresses, but even in holy Scripture, as is known.

* Add to this; (...), and (...) are Acts. 15. Romans 12. Hebr. 13.
used in Scripture for the Prelates of the Church, and I am certain, that,
Duke, and Captain, Rulers, and Commanders are but just the same in English,
that the other are in Greek, and the least of these is as much as (...), or
Lord. And then if we consider that since Christ erected a spiritual regiment,
and used words of secular honor to express it, as in the instances above,
although Christ did interdict a secular principality, yet he forbad not a
secular title; He used many himself.

5. The voice of the Spouse, the holy Church has always expressed their
honorable estimate in reverentiall compellations and Epithets of honor to
their Bishops, and have taught us so to do. * Bishops were called Principes
Ecclesiarum, Princes of the Churches. I had occasion to instance it in the
question of Jurisdiction. Indeed the third Council of Carthage forbad the
Bishop of Carthage to be called Princeps Sacerdotum, or summus Sacerdos, or
aliquid hujusmodi, but only primae sedis Episcopus. I know not what their
meaning was, unless they would dictate a lesson of humility to their Primate,
that he might remember the principality not to be so much in his person, as in
the Sea, for he might be called Bishop of the prime See. But whatsoever fancy
they had at Carthage, I am sure it was a guise of Christendom, not to speak
of Bishops sine praefatione honoris, but with honorable mention. (...), To our
most blessed LORD. So the letters were superscribed to Julius Bishop of Rome
from some of his Brethren; in Sozomen. Let no man lib. 3. cap. 23.
speak Untruths of me (...), Epist. ad Greg. Nyssen.
Nor of MY LORDS THE BISHOPS, said S. Gregory Nazianzen. The Synodicall book of
the Council of Constantinople is inscribed DOMINIS REVERENDISSIMIS, Theodoret.
lib. 5. ca. 9.
ac pijssimis Fratribus ac Collegis, Damaso, Ambrosio etc: To our most Reverend
LORDS, and holy Brethren etc: And the Council of Illyricum sending their
Synodall letters to the Bishops of Asia, by Bishop Elpidius, Haec pluribus (say
they) persequi non est visum, quod miserimus vnum ex omnibus, DOMINUM, and
Collegam nostrum Elpidium, Theodor. lib. 4. cap. 9.
qui cognosceret, esset ne sicut dictum fuerat a DOMINO, and Collega nostro
Eustathio. Our Lord, and Brother Elpidius. Our Lord and Brother Eustathius. *
The oration in the Council of Epaunum begins thus. Quod praecipientibus tantis
DOMINIS MEIS ministerium proferendi sermonis assumo etc: The Prolocutor took
that office on him, at the command of so many GREAT LORDS THE BISHOPS. * When
the Church of Spain became Catholic, and abjured the Arian heresy, King
Recaredus in the third Council of Toledo made a speech to the Bishops, Non
incognitum reor esse vobis, REVERENDISSIMI Sacerdotes etc: Non credimus vestram
latere SANCTITATEM etc: vestra Cognovit BEATITUDO etc: VENERANDI PATRES etc:
And these often. Your Holiness, your Blessedness, Most Reverend, Venerable
Fathers; Those were the addresses the King made to the Fathers of the Synod.
Thus it was when Spain grew Catholic; But not such a Speech to be found in
all the Arian records. They amongst them used but little Reverence to their
Bishops. But the instances of this kind are innumerable. Nothing more ordinary
in Antiquity then to speak of Bishops with the titles of (...), Domine vere
Sancte, and suscipiende Thedor. lib. 1. c. 4. etc. 5. Athanas. Apolog. 2.
Papa, So S. Hierome a Presbyter, to S. Austin a Bishop. Secundum enim honorum
vocabula quae jam Ecclesiae usus obtinuit Episcopatus Presbyterio major est,
says S. Austin. Episcopacy is Greater then the office Epist. 17. 18. 19. apud.
S. Augustine.
and dignity of a Presbyter according to the TITLES OF HONOR which the custom
of the Church has introduced. * But I shall sum up these particulars in a
total, which is thus expressed by S. Chrysostom. Haeretici a Diabolo HONORUM
VOCABULA in Psalm. 13. apud Baron. An. Dom. 58. n. 2.
Episcopis non dare didicerunt. Heretics have learned of the Devil not to
give due titles of honor to Bishops. The good Patriarch was angry surely when
he said so. * For my own particular, I am confident that my Lords the Bishops
do so undervalue any fastuous, or pompous title, that were not the duty of
their people in it, they would as easily reject them, as it is our duties
piously to use them. But if they still desire appellatives of honor, we must
give them, they are their due, if they desire them not, they deserve them much
more. So that either for their humility, or however for their works sake we
must [highly honor them that have the rule 1. Thessal. 5. 13.
over us] It is the precept of S. Paul, and S. Cyprian observing how Curious
our blessed Savior was that he might give honor to the Priests of the Jews,
even then when they were reeking in their malice hot as the fire of Hell; he
did it to teach us a duty. Docuit enim Sacerdotes veros LEGITIME Epist. 65.
ET PLENE HONORARI dum circa falsos Sacerdotes ipse talis extitit. It is the
argument he uses to procure a full honor to the Bishop.

* To these I add; If fitting in a THRONE even above the seat of Elders be a
title of a great dignity, then we have it confirmed by the voice of all
Antiquity calling the Bishops chair, A THRONE, and the investiture of a Bishop
in his Church AN INTHRONIZATION. Quando INTHRONIZANTUR propter communem
utilitatem Episcopi etc: says P. Anterus in his decretall Epistle to the
Bishops of Boetica and Toledo. INTHRONING is the Primitive word for the
consecration of a Bishop. Seeds in Episcoporum Ecclesi is excelsae constitutae
and praeparatae, UT THRONUS speculationem and potestatem judicandi a Domino
sibi datam materiam docent, (says Urban). And S. Ignatius to his Deacon Hero,
(...), Epist. decret.
(...), I trust that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ will show to me Hero
sitting upon my Epist. ad Hero^.
THRONE.

** The sum of all is this. Bishops if they must be at all, most certainly
must be beloved, it is our duties, and their work deserves it. S. Paul was as
dear to the Galathians, as their eyes, and it is true eternally, Formosipedes
Evangelizantium, the feet of the Preachers of the Gospel are beauteous, and
then much more of the chief. Ideo ista praetulimus (charissimi) vt
intelligatis potestatem Episcoporum vestrorum, in eisque Deum veneremini, and
eos UTANIMAS Urban. ibid.
VESTRAS diligatis, vt quibus illi non communicant, non communicetis etc: Now,
love to our Superiors is ever honorable, for it is more then amicitia, that is
amongst Peers, but love to our Betters, is Reverence, Obedience, and high
Estimate. And if we have the one, the dispute about the other would be a mere
impertinence. I end this with the saying of S. Ignatius, and vos decet non
contemnere aetatem Episcopi, sed juxta Dei Patris arbitrium OMNEM Epist. ad
Magnes.
ILLI IMPERTIRI REVERENTIAM. It is the WILL OF GOD the Father, that we should
give all REVERENCE, HONOR, or veneration to our Bishops.

WELL! However things are now, It was. 49. And trusted with affairs of
Secular interest.
otherwise in the Old Religion; for no honor was thought too great for them
whom God had honored with so great degrees of approximation to himself in
power, and authority. But then also they went further. For they thought whom
God had entrusted with their souls, they might with an equal confidence trust
with their personal actions, and employments of greatest trust.

For it was Great Consideration that they who were Antistites religionis the
Doctors, and great Dictators of Faith and conscience, should be the composers
of those affairs in whose determination, a Divine wisdom, and interests of
conscience and the authority of religion were the best ingredients.

But, it is worth observing how the Church and the Commonwealth did actions
contrary to each other, in pursuance of their several interests. The
Commonwealth still enabled Bishops to take cognizance of causes, and the
confidence of their own people would be sure to carry them thither where they
hoped for fair issue, upon such good grounds as they might fairly expect from
the Bishops abilityes, authority, and religion; But on the other side, the
Church did as much decline them as she could, and made sanctions against it so
far as she might without taking from themselves all opportunities both of
doing good to their people, and engaging the secular arm to their own
assistance. But this we shall see by consideration of particulars.

1. It was not in Natura rei unlawful for Bishops to receive an office of
secular employment. S. Paul's tent-making was as much against the calling of an
Apostle, as sitting in a secular tribunal is against the office of a Bishop.
And it is hard, if we will not allow that to the conveniences of a Republike
which must be indulged to a private, personal necessity. But we have not S.
Paul's example only, but his rule too, according to Primitive exposition.
[Dare any of you having a matter before another go to law 1. Cor. 6.
before the Unjust, and not before the Saints? If then ye have judgments of
things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the
Church] who are they? The Clergy I am sure, now adays. But S. Ambrose also
thought that to In hunc locum.
be his meaning seriously. Let the Ministers of the Church be the Judges. For
by [least esteemed] he could not mean the most ignorant of the Laity, they
would most certainly have done very strange justice, especially in such causes
which they Understand not. No, but set them to judge who by their office are
Servants, and Ministers of all, and those are the Clergy who (as S. Paul's
expression is) Preach not themselves, but Jesus to be the Lord, and themselves
your servants for Jesus sake. Melius dicit apud Dei Ministros agere causam. Yea
but S. Paul's expression seems to exclude the Governors of the Church from
intermedling. [Is there not one wise man among you that is able to Judge
between his Brethren?] Why Brethren, if Bishops and Priests were to be the
Judges, they are Fathers? The objection is not worth the noting, but only for
S. Ambrose his answer to it. Ideo autem Fratrem Iudicem eligendum dicit, quia
adhuc Rector Ecclesiae illorum non erat ordinatus. S. Paul used the word
[Brethren] for as yet a Bishop was not ordained amongst them of that Church,
intimating that the Bishop was Vide etiam August. de opere Monach. ca. 29.
to be the man, though till then, in subsidium any prudent Christian man might
be employed.

2. The Church did always forbid to Clergymen A VOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION of
engagements in REBUS SAECULI. So the sixth Canon of the Apostles, Can. 7. Latin.
(...). A Bishop, and a Vide Zonarin Can. Apostol.
Priest, and a Deacon, must not assume, or take on himself worldly cares. If
he does, let him be deposed. Here the Prohibition is general. No worldly
cares. Not domestic. But how if they come on him by Divine imposition, or
accident? That Is nothing, if he does not assume them; that is, by his voluntary
act acquire his own trouble. So that if his secular employment be an act of
obedience, indeed it is trouble to him, but no sin. But if he seeks it, for
it self, it is ambition. In this sense also must the following Canon be
understood. (...). A Clerk must not be a Tutor, or Guardian, viz: of secular
trust, that is must not seek a diversion from his employment by voluntary
Tutorship,

3. The Church also forbad all secular negotiation for base ends, not precisely
the employment it self, but the illness of the intention, and this indeed
she expressly forbids in her Canons. * Pervenit ad Sanctam Synodum quod
quidam qui in Clero sunt allecti PROPTER LUCRA TURPIA conductores alienarum
Council. Chalced. Act. 15. can. 3.
possessionum fiant, and saecularia negotia sub cura sua suscipiant, Dei quidem
Ministerium parvipendentes, Saecularium vero discurrentes domos and PROPTER
AVARITIAM patrimoniorum sollicitudinem sumentes. Clergy men farmers of lands,
and did take upon them secular employment FOR COVETOUS DESIGNS, and with
neglect of the Church. These are the things the Council complained of, and
therefore according to this exigence the following Sanction is to be
understood. Decrevit itaque hoc Sanctum magnumque Concilium, nullum deinceps,
non Episcopum, non Clericum vel Monachum aut possessiones conducere, aut
negotijs saecularibus se immiscere. No Bishop, No Clergy man, No Monk must
farm grounds, nor engage himself in secular business. What in none? No,
none, praeter pupillorum, si forte leges imponant inexcusabilem curam, aut
civitatis Episcopus Ecclesiasticarum rerum sollicitudinem habere praecipiat,
aut Orphanorum, and viduarum earum quae sine ulla defensione sunt, ac
personarum quae maxim Ecclesiastico indigent adjutorio, and propter timorem
Domini causa deposcat. This Canon will do right to the Question.

All secular affairs, and bargains either for covetousness, or with
considerable disturbance of Church offices are to be avoided. For a Clergy man
must not be covetous, much less for covetise must he neglect his cure. To this
purpose is that of the second Council of Arles, Clericus turpis lucri Can. 14.
gratia aliquod genus negotiationis non exerceat. But nor here, nor at
Chalcedon is the prohibition absolute, nor declaratory of an inconsistence and
incapacity; for, for all this, the Bishop or Clerk may do any office that is
in pia cura. He may undertake the supravision of Widows, and Orphans. And
though he be forbid by the Canon of the Apostles to be a guardian of pupills,
yet it is expounded here by this Canon of Chalcedon, for a voluntary seeking it
is forbidden by the Apostles, but here it is permitted only with, si forte
leges imponant, if the Law, or Authority commands him, then he may undertake
it. That is, if either the Emperor commands him, or if the Bishop permits him,
then it is lawful. But without such command or license it was against the
Canon of the Apostles. And therefore S. Cyprian did himself severely punish
Geminius Faustinus, one of the Priests of Carthage, for undertaking the
executorship of the Testament of Geminius Victor: he Epist. 66.
had no leave of his Bishop so to do, and for him of his own head to undertake
that which would be an avocation of him from his office, did in S. Cyprians
Consistory, deserve a censure. 3. By this Canon of Chalcedon, any Clerk may be
the Oeconomus or steward of a Church, and dispense her revenue if the Bishop
command him. 4. He may undertake the patronage, or assistance of any distressed
person that needs the Churches aid. * From hence it is evident that all
secular employment did not hoc ipso avocate a Clergyman from his necessary
office and duty; for some secular employments are permitted him, all causes of
piety, of charity, all occurrences concerning the revenues of the Church, and
nothing for covetousness, but any thing in obedience, any thing Vide Synod.
Roman. sub Sylvestr. c. 4. Council. Chalced. c. 26. and Zonar. ibid.
I mean of the forenamed instances. Nay the affairs of Church revenues, and
dispensation of Ecclesiastical Patrimony was imposed on the Bishop by the
Canons Apostolical, and then considering how many possessions were deposited
first at the Apostles feet, and afterward in the Bishops hands, we may quickly
perceive that a case may occur in which something else may be done by the
Bishop and his Clergy besides prayer and preaching. (...). says Ignatius to S.
Polycarpe of Smyrna. Let not the Widows be neglected: after God, do thou
take care of them. * Qui locupletes sunt, and volunt, pro arbitrio Justin.
Martyr. Apolog. 2.
quisque suo quod libitum est contribuit; and quod collectum est apud Praesidem
deponitur, atque is inde opitulatur Orphanis, and viduis, iisque qui vel morbo,
vel alia de causa egent: tum iis qui vincti sunt, and peregre advenientibus
hospitibus: and ut uno verbo dicam, omnium indigentium Curator est. All the
Collects and Offerings of faithful people are deposited with the Bishop, and
thence he dispenses for the relief of the widows, and Orphans, thence he
provides for travelers, and in one word, he takes care of all indigent, and
necessitous people. So it was in Justin Martyrs time and all this, a man would
think, required a considerable portion of his time, besides his studies and
prayer and preaching.

This was also done even in the Apostles times, for first they had the
provision of all the Goods, and persons of the coenobium, of the Church at
Jerusalem. This they themselves administered till a complaint arose, which might
have proved a Scandal; then they chose seven men, men full of the holy Ghost;
men that were Priests, for they were of the 70 Disciples says Epiphanius, and
such men as Preached, and Baptized, so S. Stephen, and S. Philip, therefore to
be sure they were Clergymen, and yet they left their preaching for a time, at
least abated of the height of the employment, for therefore the Apostles
appointed them, that themselves might not leave the word of God and serve
Tables; plainly implying that such men who were to serve these Tables, must
leave the Ministry of the word, in some sense or degree, and yet they chose
Presbyters, and no harm neither, and for a while themselves had the
employment. I say there was no harm done, by this temporary office, to their
Priestly function and employment. For to me it is considerable. If the calling
of a Presbyter does not take up the whole man, then what inconvenience though
his employment be mixed with secular allay. But if it does take up the whole
man, then it is not safe for any Presbyter ever to become a Bishop, which is a
dignity of a far greater burden, and requires more then a Man's all, if all
was required to the function of a Presbyter. But I proceed.

4. The Church prohibiting secular employment to Bishops and Clerks, do
prohibit it, only in gradu impedimenti officii Clericalis; and therefore when
the offices are supplied by any of the Order, it is never prohibited but that
the personal abilities of any man may be employed for the fairest advantages
either of Church, or Commonwealth. And therefore it is observeable that the
Canons provide that the Church be not destitute, not that such a particular
Clerk should there officiate. Thus the Council of Arles decreed, ut
Presbyteri SICUT HACTENUS FACTUM EST, INDISCRETE per diver Apud Burchard. lib.
2. decret. cap. 99.
sa non mittantur loca....ne forte propter eorum absentiam, and animarum
pericula, and Ecclesiarum in quibus constituti sunt, negligantur officia. So
that here we see, 1. That it had been usual to send Priests on Embassyes
[sicut hactenus factum est] 2. The Canon forbids the indiscreet or promiscuous
doing of it; not that men of great ability and choice be not employed, but that
there be discretion, or discerning in the choice of the men. viz. that such men
be chosen whose particular worth did by advancing the legation, make
compensation for absence from their Churches; and then I am sure there was no
indiscretion in the Embassy, quoad hoc at least; for the ordinary offices of
the Church might be dispensed by men of even abilities, but the extraordinary
affairs of both states require men of an heightened apprehension. 3. The Canon
only took care that the cure of the souls of a Parish be not relinquished, for
so is the title of the Canon, Ne Presbyteri causa legationis per diversa
mittantur loca, cura animarum relicta. But then if the cure be supplied by
delegation, the fears of the Canon are prevented.

* In pursuance of this consideration the Church forbad Clergymen to receive
honor, or secular preferment; and so it is expressed where the prohibition is
made. It is in the Council of Chalcedon. Qui semel in clero deputati sunt, aut
Monachorum Part. 2. Act. 15. Can. 7.
vitam expetiverunt, statuimus neque ad militiam, neque ad dignitatem aliquam
venire mundanam. That Is the inhibition; But the Canon subjoynes a temper; aut
hoc tentantes, and non agentes poenitentiam, quo minus redeant ad hoc quod
propter Deum primitus elegerunt, anathematizari, they must not turn Soldiers,
or enter upon any worldy dignity to make them leave their function, which for
the honor of God they have first chosen: for then, it seems, he that took on
him military honors, or secular prefectures, or consular dignity, could not
officiate in holy Orders, but must renounce them to assume the other; It was in
obstruction of this abuse that the Canon directed its prohibition, viz. in this
sense clearly, that a Clerk must not so take on him secular offices, as to
make him redire in saeculum, having put his hand to the plow, to look back, to
change his profession, or to relinquish the Church, and make her become a
Widow. The case of S. Matthew and S. Peter, distinguish, and clear this
business. Ecce reliquimus omnia, was the profession of their Clericall office.
S. Matthew could not return to his trade of Publican at all, for that would
have taken him from his Apostolate. But S. Peter might and did return to his
nets, for all his reliqui omnia. Plainly telling us that a SECULAR CALLING, a
CONTINUED FIXED ATTENDANCE on a business of the world is an impediment to the
Clericall office, and ministration, but not a temporary employment or secession.

5. The Canons of the Church do as much for bid the cares of household, as the
cares of public employment to Bishops. So the fourth Council of Carthage
decrees. Vt Episcopus nullam rei familiaris curam adserevocet, sed lectioni,
and orationi, Can. 20.
and verbi Dei praedicationi tantummodo vacet. Now if this Canon be confronted
with that saying of S. Paul [He that provides not for them of his own household
is worse then an infidell] it will easily inform us of the Churches intention.
For they must provide, says S. Paul, But yet so provide as not to hinder their
employment, or else they transgress the Canon of the Council; but this caveat
may be as well entered, and observed in things Political, as Oeconomicall.

Thus far we have seen what the Church has done in pursuance of her own
interest, and that was that she might with sanctity, and without distraction,
tend her Grand employment; but yet many cases did occur in which she did
canonically permit an alienation of employment, and revocation of some persons
from an assiduity of Ecclesiastical attendance, as in the case of the seven
set over the widows, and of S. Peter, and S. Paul, and all the Apostles and
the Canon of Chalcedon.

Now let us see how the Commonwealth also pursued her interest, and because
she found Bishops men of Religion and great trust, and confident abilities,
there was no reason that the Commonwealth should be disserv'd in the promotion
of able men to a Bishops throne. * Who would have made recompense to the
Emperor for depriving him of Ambrose his prefect, if Episcopal promotion had
made him incapable of serving his Prince in any great Negotiation? It was a
remarkable passage in Ignatius, (...), Epist. ad Ephesians.
(...). As our Lord is to be observed so also must we observe the BISHOP,
because he assists and serves the Lord. And wisemen, and of great understanding
must SERVE KINGS, for he must not be served with men of small parts. Here
either Ignatius commends Bishops to the service of Kings, or else propounds
them as the fittest men in the world to do them service. For if only men of
great abilities are fit to serve Kings, surely as great abilities are required
to enable a man for the service of God in so peculiar manner of approximation.
He then that is fit to be a Bishop, is most certainly fit for the service of
his King. This is the sense of Ignatius his discourse.

For consider. Christianity might be suspected for a design; and if the Church
should choose the best, and most pregnant Understandings for her employment,
and then these men become incapable of ayding the Republike, the promotion of
these men, would be an injury to those Princes whose affairs would need
support. * The interest of the Subjects also is considerable. For we find by
experience, that no authority is so full of regiment, and will so finely force
obedience, as that which is seated in the Conscience; And therefore Numa
Pompilius made his laws, and imposed them with a face of religious solemnity.
For the people are stronger then any one Governor, and were they not awed by
Religion, would quickly miscere Sacra prophanis, jumble heaven and earth into a
miscellany, and therefore not only in the Sanction of laws, but in the
execution of them, the Antistites religionis are the most competent
instruments; and this was not only in all religions that ever were, and in
ours ever till now, but even now we should quickly find it, were but our
Bishops in that Veneration, and esteem that by the law of God they ought, and
that actually they were in the Calenture of primitive devotion, and that the
Doctors of Religion were ever even amongst the most barbarous and untaught
Pagans.

Upon the confidence of these advantages, both the Emperors themselves when
they first became Christian allowed appeals from secular tribunalls to the *
Bishops Consistory, even in causes of secular Sozom. lib. cap. 9.
interest, and the people would choose to have their difficulties there ended
whence they expected the issues of justice, and religion. * I say this was done
as soon as ever the Emperors were Christian. Before this time, Bishops, and
Priests (to be sure) could not be employed in state affairs, they were odious
for their Christianity; and then no wonder if the Church forbad secular
employment in meaner offices, the attendance on which could by no means make
recompense for the least avocation of them from their Church employment. So
that it was not only the avocation but the sordidnesse of the employment that
was prohibited the Clergy in the Constitutions of holy Church. But as soon as
ever their employment might be such as to make compensation for a temporary
secession, neither Church nor State did then prohibit it; And that was as
soon as ever the Princes were Christian, for then immediately the Bishops were
employed in honorary negotiations. It was evident in the case of S. Ambrose.
For the Church of Millaine had him for their Bishop, and the Emperor had him
one of his prefects, and the people their judge in causes of secular
cognizance. For when he was chosen Bishop the Emperor who was present at the
election cried out, Gratias tibi ago Domine... quoniam huic viro ego quidem
commisi corpora; tu autem animas, Tripart. hist. lib. 7. cap. 8.
and meam electionem ostendisti tuae justitiae convenire. So that he was
Bishop, and Governor of Millaine at the same time; And therefore by reason of
both these offices S. Austin was forced to attend a good while before he could
find him at leisure. Non enim S. August. lib. 6. Confess. cap. 4.
quaerere ab eo poteram quod volebam sicut volebam, secludentibus me ab ejus
aure, atque ore catervis negotiosorum hominum, quorum infirmitatibus serviebat.
And it was his own condition too, when he came to sit in the chair of Hippo;
Non permittor Epist. 110.
ad quod volo vacare ante meridiem; post meridiem occupationibus hominum
teneor. And again, and homines quidam causas suas saeculares apua nos finire
cupientes, quando eis necessarij fuerimus, sic nos Sanctos, Epist. 147.
and Dei servos appellant, ut negotiaterrae suae peragant. Aliquando and agamus
negotium salutis nostrae and salutis ipsorum, non de auro, non de argento non
de fundis, and pecoribus, pro quibus rebus quotidie submisso capite salutamur
ut dissensiones hominum terminemus. It was almost the business of every day to
him, to judge causes concerning Gold, and Silver, Cattle, and glebe, and all
appertenances of this life. This S. Austin would not have done, if it had not
been lawful, so we are to suppose in charity; but yet this we are sure of, S.
Austin thought it not de^pare Monach. cap: 29.
only lawful, but a part of his duty, [quibus nos molestijs idem affixit
Apostolus, and that by the authority, not of himself, but of him that spoke
within him, even the H. Ghost:] so he.

Thus also it was usual for Princes in the Primitive Church to send Bishops
their Ambassadors. Constans the Emperor sent two Bishops chosen out of the
Council of Sardis together with Salianus Tripart. hist: lib: 4. cap. 25.
the Great Master of his Army to Constantius * S. Chrysostom was sent
Ambassador to Gainas. Maruthus the Bishop of Mesopotamia was sent Ambassador
lib: 10. cap; 6. ibid. 11. cap. 8. ibid.
from the Emperor to Isdigerdes the King of Persia. S. Ambrose from
Valentinian the younger lib. 5. Epist. Ambros. 33. Eusebius: lib. 8. cap. 1.
to the Tyrant Maximus. * Dorotheus was a Bishop and a chamberlain to the
Emperor. Many more examples there are of the concurrence of the Episcopal
office, and a secular dignity or employment. Now then Consider. * The Church
did not, might not challenge any secular honor, or employment by virtue of her
Ecclesiastical dignity precisely. 2. The Church might not be ambitious, or
indagative of such employment. 3. The Church's interest abstractly considered
was not promoted by such employment, but where there was no greater way of
compensation was interrupted and depressed. 4. The Church (though in some cases
she was allowed to make secession, yet) might not relinquish her own charge,
to intervene in another aid. 5. The Church did by no means suffer her Clerks,
to undertake any low secular employment, much more did she forbid all sordid
ends, and Covetous designs. 6. The Bishop, or his Clerks might ever do any
action of piety, though of secular burden. Clerks were never forbidden to read
Grammar, or Philosophy to youth, to be Masters of Schools, of Hospitalls, they
might reconcile their Neighbors that were fallen out, about a personal
trespass, or real action, and yet since now adays a Clergy-man's employment
and capacity is bounded within his Pulpit, or reading deske, or his study of
Divinity at most, these that I have reckoned are as verily secular as any
thing, and yet no law of Christendom ever prohibited any of these or any of
the like Nature to the Clergy, nor any thing that is ingenuous, that is fit for
a Scholar, that requires either finenesse of parts, or great learning, or
overruling authority, or exemplary piety. 7. Clergymen might do any thing that
was imposed on them by their Superiors. 8. The Bishops, and Priests were men
of Great ability and surest confidence for determinations of Justice, in which,
religion was ever the strongest binder. And therefore the Princes and People
sometimes forced the Bishops from their own interest to serve the
Commonwealth, and in it they served themselves directly, and by consequence
too, the Church had not only a sustentation from the secular arm, but an
addition of honor, and secular advantages, and all this warranted by precedent
of Scripture, and the practice of the Primitive Church, and particularly of men
whom all succeeding ages have put into the Calender of Saints. * So that it
would be considered, that all this while, it is the kings interest, and the
Peoples that is pleaded, when we assert a capacity to the Bishops to undertake
charges of public trust. It is no addition to the calling of Bishops. It
serves the King, it assists the republike, and in such a plethory, and almost a
surfeit of Clergymen as this age is supplied with, it can be no disservice to
the Church, whose daily offices may be plentifully supplied by Vicars, and for
the temporary avocation of some few, abundant recompense is made to the Church
(which is not at all injured) by becoming an occasion of indearing the Church,
to those whose aid she is.

* There is an admirable epistle written by Petrus Blesensis in the name of the
Arch bishop of Canterbury Epist. 84.
to P. Alexander the third in the defense of the Bishop of Ely, Winchester and
Norwich that attended the Court upon service of the King. Non est novum (says
he) quod Regum Consiliis intersint Episcopi. Sicut enim honestate, and
sapientia caeteros antecedunt, sic expeditiores, and efficaciores in reip
administratione censentur. Quia sicut Scriptum est [minus salubriter disponitur
regnum, quod non regitur consilio sapientum] In quo not atur eos consiliis
Regum debere assistere, qui sciant and velint, and possint patientibus compati,
paciterrae, ac populi saluti prospicere, crudire adjustitiam Reges,
imminentibus occursare periculis, vitaeque maturioris exemplis informare
subditos and quadam authoritate potestativa praesumptionem malignantium
cohibere. It is no new thing for Bishops to be Counselors to Princes (says
he) their wisdom and piety that enables them for a Bishopric proclaims them
fit instruments to promote the public tranquillity of the Commonwealth. They
know how to comply with oppressed people, to advance designs of peace, and
public security; It is their office to instruct the King to righteousness, by
their sanctity to be a rule to the Court, and to diffuse their exemplary piety
over the body of the Kingdom, to mix influences of religion with designs of
state, to make them have as much of the dove as of the serpent, and by the
advantage of their religious authority to restrain the malignity of accursed
people in whom any image of a God, or of religion is remaining. * He proceeds
in the discourse and brings the examples of Samuel, Isaiah, Elisha, Iojada,
Zecharias, who were Priests and Prophets respectively, and yet employed in
Princes Courts, and Counsels of Kings, and adds this; Vnum noveritis, quia
nisi familiares, and Consiliarii Regis essent Episcopi, supra dorsum Ecclesiae
hodie fabricarent peccatores, and immaniter, ac intolerabiliter opprimeret
Clerum praesumptio Laicalis. That Is most true. If the Church had not the
advantage of additionall honorary employments, the plowers would plow upon the
Churches back, and make long furrows. * The whole Epistle is worth
transcribing, But I shall content my self with this summary of the advantages
which are acquired both to policy and Religion by the employment of Bishops in
Princes Courts. Is It is me diantibus mansuescit circa simplices judiciarius
rigor, admittitur clamor pauperum, Ecclesiarum dignitas erigitur, relevatur
pauperum indigentia, firmatur in clero libertas, pax in populis, in Monasteriis
quies, justitia libere exercetur, superbia opprimitur, augetur Laicorum
devotio, religio fovetur, diriguntur judicia, etc. When pious Bishops are
employed in Princes Counsels, then the rigor of Laws is abated, equity
introduced, the cry of the poor is heard, their necessities are made known,
the liberties of the Church are conserved, the peace of Kingdoms labored for,
pride is depressed, religion increases, the devotion of the Laity multiplies,
and tribunalls are made just, and incorrupt, and merciful. Thus far Petrus
Blesensis. * These are the effects which though perhaps they do not always
fall out, yet these things may in expectation of reason be looked for from the
Clergy, their principles and calling promises all this, and quia in Ecclesia
magis lex est, ubi Dominus legis timetur, melius dicit apud Dei Ministros agere
causam. Facilius enim Dei timore sententiam legis veram promunt; (says S.
Ambrose,) In 1. Corinthians. 6.
and therefore certainly the fairest reason in the world that they be employed.
But if personal defaillance be thought reasonable to disimploy the whole
calling, then neither Clergy nor Laity should ever serve a Prince.

And now we are easily driven into an understanding of that saying of S. Paul
[No man that 2. Timoth. 2. 4.
warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life.] For although this
be spoken of all Christian people, and concerns the Laity in their proportion
as much as the Clergy, yet nor one, nor the other is interdicted any thing that
is not a direct hinderance to their own precise duty of Christianity. And such
things must be pared away from the fringes of the Laity, as well as the long
robe of the Clergy. But if we should consider how little we have now left for
the employment of a Bishop, I am afraid a Bishop would scarce seem to be a
necessary function, so far would it be from being hindered by the collateral
intervening of a Lay-judicature. I need not instance in any particulars; for if
the judging matters and questions of religion be not left alone to them, they
may well be put into atemporall employment, to preserve them from suspicion of
doing nothing.

I have now done with this; only entreating this to be considered. Is not the
King fons utriusque jurisdictionis? In all the senses of Common Law, and
external compulsory he is. But if so, then why may not the King as well make
Clergy-Iudges, as Lay-Delegates? For (to be sure) if there be an incapacity in
the Clergy of meddling with secular affairs, there is the same at least in the
Laity of meddling with Church affairs. For if the Clergy be above the affairs
of the World, then the Laity are under the affairs of the Church; or else, if
the Clergy beincapable of Lay-businesse, because it is of a different and
disparate nature from the Church, does not the same argument exclude the Laity
from intervening in Church affairs? For the Church differs no more from the
commonwealth, then the commonwealth differs from the Church. And now after
all this, suppose a King should command a Bishop to go on Embassy to a
foreign Prince, to be a Commissioner in a treaty of pacification, if the
Bishop refuse, did he do the duty of a Subject? If yea, I wonder what
subjection that is which a Bishop owes to his Prince, when he shall not be
bound to obey him in any thing but the saying, and doing of his office, to
which he is obliged, whether the Prince commands him yea or no. But if no, then
the Bishop was tied to go, and then the calling makes him no way incapable of
such employment, for no man can be bound to do a sin.

BUt then did not this employment, when the occasions. 50. And therefore were
enforced to delegate their power and put others in substitution.
were great, and extraordinary, force the Bishops to a temporary absence? And
what remedy was there for that? For the Church is not to be left destitute,
that is agreed on by all the Canons. They must not be like the Sicilian Bishops
whom Petrus Blesensis complains of, that attended the Court, and never visited
their Churches, or took care either of the cure of souls, or of the Church
possessions. What then must be done? The Bishops in such cases may give
delegation of their power, and offices to others, though now adays they are
complained of for their care. I say, for their care; For if they may intervene
in secular affairs, they may sometimes be absent, and then they must delegate
their power, or leave the Church without a Curate. *** But for this matter the
account need not be long. For since I have proved that the whole Diocese is in
cura Episcopali, and for all of it, he is responsive to God Almighty, and yet,
that instant necessity and the public act of Christendom has ratified it,
that Bishops have delegated to Presbyters so many parts of the Bishops charge
as there are parishes in his Diocese, the (...) which is pretended for
delegation of Episcopal charge, is no less then the act of all Christendom.
For it is evident at first, Presbyters had no distinct cure at all, but were in
common assistant to the Bishop, and were his emissaries for the gaining souls
in City, or Suburbs; But when the Bishops divided parishes, and fixed the
Presbyters upon a cure, so many Parishes as they distinguished, so many
delegations they made; And these we all believe to be good both in law, and
conscience. For the Bishop per omnes divinos ordines propriae hierarchiae
exercet mysteria (says S. Denis, Eccles. hierar. c. 5.
) he does not do the offices of his order by himself only, but by others
also, for all the inferior orders do so operate, as by them he does his proper
offices.

* But besides this grand act of the Bishops first, and then of all
Christendom in consent, we have fair precedent in S. Paul; for he made
delegation of a power to the Church of Corinth to excommunicate the incestuous
person. It was a plain delegation; for he commanded them to do it, and gave
them his own spirit, that is, his own authority; and indeed without it, I
scarce find how the delinquent should have been delivered over to Satan in the
sense of the Apostolic Church, that is, to be buffeted, for that was a
miraculous appendix of power Apostolic.

* When S. Paul sent for Timothy from Ephesus, he sent Tychicus to be his
Vicar. [Doethy diligence 2. Timoth. 4. v. 9. and 12.
to come unto me shortly, for Demas has forsaken me etc. And Tychicus have I
sent to Ephesus] Here was an express delegation of the power of jurisdiction
to Tychicus, who for the time was Curate to S. Timothy. Epaphroditus for a
while attended on S. Paul, although he was then Bishop of Philippi, and either
S. Paul, or Epaphroditus appointed one in substitution, or the Church was
relinquished, Philip. 2. v. 25. 26.
for he was most certainly non-resident.

* Thus also we find that S. Ignatius did delegate his power to the Presbyters
in his voyage to his Martyrdom. Presbyteri pascite gregem qui inter Epist. ad
Antioch.
vos est, donec Deus designaverit eum qui principatum in vobis habiturus est.
Ye Presbyters do you feed the flock till God shall design you a Bishop. Till
then. Therefore it was but a delegate power, it could not else have expired in
the presence of a Superior. * To this purpose is that of the Laodicean Can. 56.
Council. Non oportet Presbyteros ante ingressum Episcopi ingredi, and sedere
in tribunalibus, nisi forte aut aegrotet Episcopus, aut in peregrinis eum esse
constiterit. Presbyters must not sit in Consistory without the Bishop, unless
the Bishop be sick, or absent. So that it seems what the Bishop does when he
is in his Church, that may be committed to others in his absence. And to this
purpose S. Cyprian sent a plain commission to his Presbyters. Fretus ergo
dilectione and religione vestra.... his literis hortor, and Epist. 9.
Mando vt vos.... VICE MEA FUN GAMINI circa gerenda ea quae administratio
religiosa deposcit. I entreat and command you, that you do my office in the
administration of the affairs of the Church; and another time he put
Herculanus, and Caldonius, two of his Suffragans, together with Rogatianus, and
Numidicus, two Priests, in substitution for the excommunicating Epist. 38. and
39.
Faelicissimus and four more. [Cum ego vos pro me VICARIOS miserim.] So it was
just in the case of Hierocles Bishop of Alexandria and haeres. 68.
Melitius his Surrogate in Epiphanius. Videbatur autem and Melitius praeminere
etc: vt qui secundum locum habebat post Petrum in Archiepiscopatu, velut
adjuvandi ejus gratia sub ipso existens, and sub ipso Ecclesiastica curans. He
did Church offices under, and for Hierocles; And I could never find any Canon
or personal declamatory clause in any Council, or Primitive Father against a
Bishop's giving more or less of his jurisdiction by way of delegation.

* Hitherto also may be referred, that when the goods of all the Church which
then were of a perplexe and buisy dispensation, were all in the Bishops hand as
part of the Episcopal function, yet that part of the Bishops office, the
Bishop by order of the Council of Chalcedon might delegate to a steward;
provided he were a Clergyman; and upon this intimation and decree of Chalcedon
the Fathers in the Council of Sevill forbid any laymen to be stewards for the
Church. Elegimus vt vnusquisque nostrum secundum Chalcedonensium Patrum decreta
Council. Hispal. cap. 6.
ex proprio Clero Oeconomum sibi constituat. But the reason extends the Canon
further. Indecorum est enim laicum VICARIUM esse Episcopi, and Saeculares in
Ecclesia judicare. VICARS OF BISHOPS the Canon allows, only forbids laymen
to be Vicars. In uno enim eodemque officio non decet dispar professio, quod
etiam in divina lege prohibetur, etc: In one and the same office the law of God
forbids to join men of disparate vapacities. This then would be considered.
For the Canon pretends Scripture, Precepts of Fathers, and Tradition of
antiquity for it is Sanction.

* FOR although antiquity approves of Episcopal. 51. But they were ever
Clergymen, for there never was any lay Elders in any Church office heard of in
the Church. Socrat. lib. 7. cap. 37.
delegations of their power to their Vicars, yet these Vicars and delegates
must be Priests at least. Melitius was a Bishop, and yet the Chancellor of
Hierocles Patriarch of Alexandria, So were Herculanus, and Caldonius to S.
Cyprian. But they never delegated to any layman any part of their Episcopal
power precisely. Of their lay-power or the cognizance of secular causes of the
people, I find one delegation made to some Gentlemen of the Laity, by Sylvanus
Bishop of Troas, when his Clerks grew covetous, he cured their itch of gold, by
trusting men of another profession so to shame them into justice, and contempt
of money. * Si quis autem Episcopus posthac Ecclesiasticam rem aut LAICALI
PROCURATIONE administrandam elegerit Council. Hispal. ubi supra.
.... non solum a Christo derebus Pauperum judicatur reus, sed etiam and
Concilio manebit obnoxious. If any Bishop shall hereafter concredit any Church
affairs to LAY ADMINISTRATION, he shall be responsive to Christ, and in danger
of the Council. But the thing was of more ancient constitution. For in that
Epistle which goes under the Name of S. Clement, Epist. ad Jacob. Fratr. Dom.
which is most certainly very ancient whoever was the author of it, it is
decreed, Si qui ex Fratribus negotia habent inter se apud cognitores saeculi
non judicentur, sed apud Presbyteros Ecclesiae quicquid illud est dirimatur. If
Christian people have causes of difference and judicial contestation, let it
be ended before the PRIESTS. For so S. Clement expounds [Presbyteros] in the
same Epistle, reckoning it as a part of the sacred Hierarchy. * To this or some
parallel constitution S. Hierome relates, saying that [Priests from the
beginning were appointed judges of de 7. Ordin. Eccles.
causes]. He expounds his meaning to be of such Priests as were also Bishops,
and they were Judges ab initio, from the beginning (says S. Hierom). So that
this saying of the Father may no way prejudge the Bishops authority, but it
excludes the assistance of laymen from their Consistories. Presybter, and
Episcopus was instead of one word to S. Hierom, but they are always Clergy,
with him and all men else,

* But for the main Question, S. Ambrose did represent it to Valentinian the
Emperor with Epist. 13. ad Valent.
confidence, and humility, In causa fidei, vel Ecclesiastici alicujus ordinis
eum judicare debere, qui nec Munere impar sit, nec jure dissimilis. The whole
Epistle is admirable to this purpose, Sacerdotes de Sacerdotibus judicare, that
Clergymen must only judge of Clergy-causes; and this S. Ambrose there call's
judicium Episcopale. The Bishops judicature. Si tractandum est, tractare in
Ecclesia didici, quod Majores feceruntmei. Si conferendum de fide, Sacerdotum
debet esse ista collatio, sicut factum est sub Constantino Aug. memoriae
Principe. So that, both matters of Faith and of Ecclesiastical Order are to be
handled in the Church, and that by Bishops, and that sub Imperatore, by
permission and authority of the Prince. For so it was in Nice, under
Constantine. Thus far S. Ambrose.

* S. Athanasius reports that Hosius Bishop of Epist. ad Solitar.
Corduba, president in the Nicene Council, said, it was the abomination of
delolation that a layman should be judge in Ecclesiasticis judicijs, in
Churchcauses; And Leontius calls Church-affayres, Res Suidas in vita Leontij.
alienas a Laicis, things of another Court, of a distinct cognizance from the
Laity. * To these add the Council of Venice, for it is very considerable in
Can. 9. A. D. 453.
this Question. Clerico nisi ex permissu Episcopi sui servorum suorum
saecularia judicia adire non liceat. Sed si fortasse Episcopi sui judicium
caeperit habere suspectum, aut ipsi de proprietate aliqua adversus ipsum
Episcopum fuerit nata contentio, aliorum Episcoporum audientiam, NON
SAECULARIUM POTESTATUM debebit ambire. Aliter a communione habeatur alienus.
Clergymen without delegation from their Bishop may not hear the causes of
their servants, but the Bishop, unless the Bishop be appealed from, then other
Bishops must hear the cause, but NO LAY JUDGES by any means.

* These Sanctions of holy Church it pleased the Emperor to ratify by an
Imperial edict, for so Novell. constit. 123.
Justinian commanded that in causes Ecclesiastical, Secular Judges should have
no interest, SED SANCTISSIMUS EPISCOPUS SECUNDUM SACRAS REGULAS CAUSAE FINEM
IMPONAT. The Bishop according to the Sacred Canons must be the sole judge of
Church Matters. I end this with the decretall of S. Gregory one of the four
Doctors of the Church. Cavendum est a Fraternitate vestra, ne saecularibus
viris, atque non sub regula nostra degentibus res Ecclesiasticae lib. 7. epist.
66.
committantur. Heed must be taken that matters Ecclesiastical be not any ways
concredited to secular persons. But of this I have twice spoken already.. 36.
and. 41.

The thing is so evident, that it is next to impudence to say that in Antiquity
Laymen were parties and assessors in the Consistory of the Church. It was
against their faith, it was against their practice; and those few pigmy
objections, out of Tertull. Apol. c. 33. S. Ambros. in. 1. Tim. 5. 1. and lib.
1. de offic. c. 20. S. August. lib. 3. contra Crescon. and Epist. 137.
Tertullian, S. Ambrose, and S. Austin using the word Seniores, or Elders,
sometimes for Priests, as being the latin for the Greek (...), sometimes for
a secular Magistrate, or Alderman, (for I think S. Austin did so in his third
book against Cresconius) are but like Sophoms to prove that two and two are
not four; for to pretend such slight, aerie imaginations, against the constant,
known, open, Catholic practice and doctrine of the Church, and history of all
ages, is as if a man should go to fright an Imperial army with a single
bulrush. They are not worth further considering.

* But this is; That in this Question of Lay Elders the Modern Aerians and
Acephali do wholly mistake their own advantages. For whatsoever they object
out of antiquity for the white, and watery colors of Lay Elders is either a
very misprision of their allegations, or else clearly abused in the use of
them. For now adays they are only used to exclude and drive forth Episcopacy,
but then they misalledge antiquity, for the men with whose Heifers they would
feign plough in this Question were themselves Bishops for the most part, and he
that was not, would feign have been, it is known so of Tertullian, and
therefore most certainly if they had spoken of lay-Iudges in Church matters
(which they never dreamed of) yet meant them not so as to exclude Episcopacy,
and if not, then the pretended allegations can do no service in the present
Question.

I am only to clear this pretense from a place of Scripture totally
misunderstood, and then it cannot have any color from any (...), either
divine, or humane, but that Lay-Iudges of causes Ecclesiastical as they are
unheard of in antiquity, so they are neither named in Scripture, nor receive
from thence any instructions for their deportment in their imaginary office,
and therefore may be remanded to the place from whence they came, even the lake
of Gebenna, and so to the place of the nearest denomination. The objection is
from S. Paul, (...). let the Elders that rule well, be 1. Tim. 5. 17.
accounted worthy of double honor, especially they that labor in the word and
doctrine. especially they -- therefore all Elders do not so. Here are two
sorts of Elders, Preaching Ministers, and Elders not Preachers. Therefore
Lay Elders, and yet all are governors.

1. But why therefore Lay Elders? Why may there not be diverse Church Officers,
and yet but one, or two of them the Preacher? [Christ sent me not to Baptize
but to Preach] says S. Paul, and yet the commission of [baptizate] was as
large as [praedicate] and why then might not another say, Christ sent me not to
Preach, but to Baptize, that is, in S. Paul's sense, not so much to do one, as
to do the other, and if he left the ordinary ministration of Baptism, and
betook himself to the ordinary office of Preaching, then to be sure, some
Minister must be the ordinary Baptizer, and so, not the Preacher, for if he
might be both ordinarily, why was not S. Paul both? For though their power was
common to all of the same order, yet the execution and dispensation of the
Ministeries was according to several gifts, and that of Prophecy, or Preaching
was not dispensed to all in so considerable a measure, but that some of them
might be destined to the ordinary execution of other offices, and yet because
the gift of Prophecy was the greatest, so also was the office, and therefore
the sense of the words is this, that all Presbyters must be honored, but
especially they that Prophecy, doing that office with an ordinary execution and
ministry. So no Lay Elders yet. Add to this, that it is also plain that all
the Clergy did not Preach. Valerius Bishop of Hippo could not well skill in the
Latin tongue being a Greek borne, and yet a Godly Bishop, and S. Austin his
Presbyter preached for him. The same case might occur in the Apostles times.
For then was a concurse of all Nations to the Christian Synaxes, especially in
all great Imperial Cities, and Metropolitans, as Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem,
Caesarea, and the like. Now all could not speak with tongues, neither could all
Prophecy, they were particular gifts given severally, to several men
appointed to minister in Church-offices. Some Prophesied, some interpreted; and
therefore is is an ignorant fancy to think that he must needs be a Laick,
whosoever in the ages Apostolical was not a Preacher.

2. None of the Fathers ever expounded this place of Lay Elders, so that we
have a traditive interpretation of it in prejudice to the pretense of our new
office.

3. The word Presbyter is never used in the new Testament for a Layman, if a
Church officer be intended. If it be said, it is used so here, that is the
question, and must not be brought to prove it self.

4. The Presbyter that is here spoken of must be maintained by Ecclesiastical
revenue, for so S. Paul expounds [honour] in the next verse. Presbyters that
rule well must be honored etc. For it is written, thou shall not muzzle the
mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn. But now, the Patrons of this new
devise are not so greedy of their Lay-Bishops as to be at charges with them,
they will rather let them stand alone on their own rotten legs, and so perish,
then fix him upon this place with their hands in their purses. But it had been
most fitting for them to have kept him, being he is of their own begetting.

5. This place speaks not of diverse persons, but diverse parts of the Pastoral
office, (...), and (...). To rule, and to labor in the word. Just as if the
expression had been in materia politica. All good Counselors of State are
worthy of double honor, especially them that disregarding their own private,
aim at the public good. This implies not two sorts of Counselors, but two
parts of a Counselors worth, and quality. Judges that do righteousness are
worthy of double honor, especially if they right the cause of Orphans, and
Widows, and yet there are no righteous judges that refuse to do both.

6. All Ministers of H. Church did not preach, at least not frequently. The
seven that were (...), set over the Widows were Presbyters, but yet they were
forced to leave the constant ministration of the word to attend that
employment, as I showed. 48.
formerly; and thus it was in descent too, for (...), lib. 5: cap. 22.
(said Socrates) A Presbyter does not Preach in Alexandria, the Bishop only did
it. And then the allegation is easily understood. For laboring in the word
does not signify, only making Homilies or exhortations to the people, but
whether it be by word, or writing, or traveling from place to place, still,
the greater the sedulity of the person is, and difficulty of the labor, the
greater increment of honor is to be given him. So that here is no Lay Elders;
for all the Presbyters S. Paul speaks of, are to be honored, but especially
those who take extraordinary pains in propagating the Gospel. For though all
preach, (suppose that) yet all do not (...), take such great pains in it, as
is intimated in, (...). For (...) is to take bodily labor, and travail, usque
adlassitudinem, (so Budaeus renders it.) And so it is likely S. Paul here
means. Honor the good Presbyters, but especially them that travel for
disseminating the Gospel. And the word is often so used in Scripture. S. Paul,
(...). I have traveled in the word more then they all. Not that S. Paul
preached more then all the Apostles, for most certainly, they made it their
business as well as he. But he traveled further and more then they all for
the spreading it. And thus it is said of the good Woman that traveled with the
Aposties, for supply of the necessities of their diet and household offices,
[they labored much in the Lord.] (...) is the word for them too. So it is said
of Persis, of Mary, of Tryphaena, of Triphosa. And Romans 16.
since these women were (...), that traveled with the Apostolical men and
Evangelists, the men also traveled to, and preached, and therefore were (...),
that is travelers in the word. [We ought therefore to receive such] (says S.
John) 1. Epist. cap. 3.
intimating a particular reception of them, as being toward us of a peculiar
merit. So that the sense of S. Paul may be this also, All the Rulers of the
Church, that is, all Bishops, Apostles, and Apostolic men, are to be honored,
but especially them who, besides the former ruling, are also travelers in the
word, or Evangelists.

7. We are furnished with answer enough to infatuate this pretense for
Lay Elders, from the common draught of the new discipline. For they have some
that Preach only, and some that Rule, and Preach too, and yet neither of them
the Lay-Elder, viz. their Pastors, and Doctors.

8. Since it is pretended by themselves in the Question of Episcopacy, that
Presbyter, and Episcopus is all one, and this very thing confidently obtruded
in defiance of Episcopacy, why may not Presbyteri in this place signify
[Bishops?] And then either this must be Lay-Bishops as well as Lay-Presbyters
or else this place is to none of their purposes.

9. If both these offices of RULING and PREACHING may be conjunct in one
person, then there is no necessity of distinguishing the Officers by the
several employments, since one man may do both. But if these offices cannot
be conjunct, then no Bishops must preach, nor no preachers be of the Consistory
(take which government you list) for if they be, then the offices being united
in one person, the inference of the distinct officer, the Lay-Elder, is
impertinent. For the meaning of S. Paul would be nothing but this. All
Church-Rulers must be honored, Especially for their preaching. For if the
offices may be united in one person (as it is evident they may) then this may
be comprehended within the other, and only be a vital part and of peculiar
excellency. And indeed so it is, according to the exposition of S. Chrysostom,
and Primasius, (...). They rule well, that spare nothing for the care of the
flock. So that this is the general charge, and preaching is the particular.
For the work in general they are to receive double honor, but this of
preaching, as then preaching was, had a particular excellency, and a plastic
power to form men into Christianity, especially it being then attested with
miracles.

But the new office of a Lay-Elder, I confess I cannot comprehend in any
reasonable proportion, his person, his quality, his office, his authority, his
subordination, his commission has made so many divisions and new emergent
Questions: and they, none of them all asserted either by Scripture or
Antiquity, that if I had a mind to leave the way of God and of the Catholic
Church, and run in pursuit of this meteor, I might quickly be amused, but
should find nothing certain but a certainty of being misguided. Therefore if
not for conscience sake, yet for prudence, bonum est esse hic, it is good to
remain in the fold of Christ, under the guard, and supravision of those
sheapheards Christ has appointed, and which his sheep have always followed.

For I consider this one thing to be enough to determine the Question. [My
sheep (says our blessed Savior) hear my voice, if a stranger, or a thief
come, him they will not heare] Clea ly thus. That Christ's sheep hear not the
voice of a stranger, nor will they follow him, and therefore those sheapheards
whom the Church has followed in all ages, are no strangers, but Sheapheards or
Pastors of Christ's appointing, or else Christ has had no sheep; for if he
has, then Bishops are the sheapheards, for them they have ever followed. I end
with that golden rule of Vincentius Lirinensis, Magnopere Cap. 3. adv. haereses.
curandum est ut id teneamus, quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus
creditum est. Hoc est enim vere, proprieque Catholicum. For certainly the
Catholic belief of the Church against Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius,
Apollinaris, and (the worst of heretics) the Cataphrygians was never more
truly received of all, and always, and every where then is the government of
the Church by Bishops. Annunciare ergo Christianis Catholicis praeter id quod
Cap. 14.
acceperunt, nunquam licuit, nunquam licet, nunquam licebit. It never was, is,
nor ever shall be lawful to teach Christian people any new thing then what
they have received from a primitive fountain, and is descended in the stream of
Catholic, uninterrupted succession.

* I only add, that the Church has insinuated it to be the duty of all good
Catholic Christians to pray for Bishops, and as the case now stands, for
Episcopacy it self, for there was never any Church-Liturgy but said Letanyes
for their KING, and for their BISHOP.

A SERMON PREACHED IN SAINT MARY'S Church in OXFORD. Upon the Anniversary of
the GUNPOWDER-TREASON.

Nolite tangere Christos meos. OXFORD, Printed by LEONARD LICHFIELD Printer to
the University.

M. DC. XXXVIII.

TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD WILLIAM by Divine providence LORD
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY His Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan,
CHANCELLOR of the University of OXFORD, and one of his MAJESTY'S most
Honorable Privy Council. My most Honorable good LORD.
May it please your GRACE,
IT was obedience to my Superior that engaged me upon this last Anniversary
commemoration of the great Goodness of God Almighty to our King and Country in
the discovery of the most damnable Powder Treason. It was a blessing which no
tongue could express, much less mine, which had scarce learned to speak, at
least, was most unfit to speak in the Schools of the Prophets. Delicata autem
est illao bedientia quae causas quaerit. It had been no good argument of my
obedience to have disputed the inconvenience of my person, and the unaptnesse
of my parts for such an employment. I knew God, out of the mouth of Infants,
could acquire his praise, and if my heart were actually as Uotive as my tongue
should have been, it might be one of Gods Magnalia to perfect his own praise
out of the weakness and imperfection of the Organ. So as I was able, I
endeavored to perform it, having my obedience ever ready for my excuse to
men, and my willingness to perform my duty, for the assoylment of my self
before God; part of which I hope was accepted, and I have no reason to think,
that the other was not pardoned.

When I first thought of the Barbarism of this Treason, I wondered not so much
at the thing it self as by what means it was possible for the Devil to gain
so strong a party in men's resolutions, as to move them to undertake a business
so abhorring from Christianity, so evidently full of extreme danger to their
lives, and so certainly to incur the highest wrath of God Almighty. My
thoughts were thus rude at first; but after a strict inquisition I fond it was
apprehended as a business (perhaps full of danger to their bodies, but)
advantageous to their souls, consonant to the obligation of all Christians,
and meritorious of an exceeding weight of Glory, for now it was come to pass
which our dear Master foretold, men should kill us, and think they did God
good service in it. I could not think this to be a part of any man's religion,
nor do I yet believe it. For it is so apparently destructive of our dear
Master his Royal laws of Charity and Obedience, that I must not be so
uncharitable as to think they speak their own mind truly, when they
profess their belief of the lawfullnesse and necessity in some cases of
rebelling against their lawful Prince, and using all means to throw him from
his kingdom, though it be by taking of his life. But it is but just that they
who break the bonds of duty to their Prince, should likewise forfeit the laws
of charity to themselves, and if they say not true, yet to be more
uncharitable to their own persons, then I durst be, though I had their own
warrant. Briefly (Most R. Father) I found amongst them of the Roman party such
prevailing opinions, as could not consist with loyalty to their Prince, in case
he were not the Popes subject, and these so generally believed, and somewhere
obtruded under peril of their souls, that I could not but point at these
dangerous rocks, at which I doubt not, but the loyalty of many has suffered
shipwreck, and of thousands more might, if a higher Star had not guided them
better, then their own Pilots.

I could not therefore but think it very likely that this Treason might spring
from the same Fountain, and I had concluded so in my first meditations, but
that I was willing to consider, whether or no it might not be that these men
were rather exasperated then persuaded, and whether it were not that the
severity of our laws against them might rather provoke their intemperate zeal,
then religion thus move their settled conscience. It was a material
consideration, because they ever did and still do fill the world with outcries
against our laws for making a rape upon their consciences, have printed
Catalogues of their English Martyrs, drawn Schemes of most strange tortures
imposed on their Priests, such as were unimaginable, by Nero, or Dioclesian, or
any of the worst and cruellest enemies of Christianity, endeavoring thus to
make us partly guilty of our own ruin, and so washing their hands in token of
their own innocence, even then when they were dipping them in the blood
Royal, and would have emptyed the best veins in the whole Kingdom to fill
their Lavatory. But I found all these to be but Calumnies, strong accusations
upon weak presumptions, and that the cause did rest where I had begun, I
mean, upon the pretense of the Catholic cause, and that the imagined
iniquity of the Laws of England could not be made a veil to cover the
deformity of their intentions, for our Laws were just, Honorable, and
Religious.

Concerning these and some other appendices to the business of the day; I
expressed some part of my thoughts, which because happily they were but a just
truth, and this truth not unseasonable for these last times, in which (as S.
Paul prophesied) men would be fierce, Traitors, heady, and high minded,
creeping into houses, leading silly women captive, it pleased some who had
power to command me, to wish me to a publicatio^ of these my short and sudden
meditations, that (if it were possible) even this way I might express my duty
to God and the King.

Being thus far encouraged, I resolved to go something further, even to the
boldness of a dedication to your Grace, that since I had no merit of my own to
move me to the confidence of a public view, yet I might dare to venture under
the protection of your Graces favor. But since my boldness does as much need
a defense, as my Sermon a Patronage, I humbly crave leave to say, that though
it be boldness, even to presumption, yet my address to your Grace is not
altogether unreasonable.

For since all know that your Grace thinks not your life your own, but when it
spends it self in the service of your King, opposing your great endeavors
against the zelots of both sides who labor the disturbance of the Church and
State, I could not think it (...) to present to your Grace this short discovery
of the Kings enemies, (...), and proper to your Grace who is so true, so
zealous a lover of your Prince and Country. It was likewise appointed to be the
public voice of thanksgiving for your University (though she never spoke
weaker then by so mean an instrument) and therefore is accountable to your
Grace to whom under God and the King we owe the Blessing and Prosperity of all
our Studies. Nor yet can I choose but hope, that my Great Obligations to your
Grace's Favor may plead my pardon, (since it is better that my Gratitude
should be bold, then my diffidence ungrateful) but that this is so far from
expressing the least part of them, that it lays a greater bond upon me, either
for a debt of delinquency in presenting it, or of thankfulness, if your Grace
may please to pardon it.

I humbly crave your Grace's Benediction, pardon, and acceptance of the
humblest duty and observance of

Your GRACES most observant and obliged CHAPLAIN IER. TAILOR.

A SERMON PREACHED UPON THE Anniversary of the GUNPOWDER-TREASON.
LUKE 9. Cap. verse. 54. But when James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will thou that we command fire to come from Heaven and consume them even as Elias
did?
I Shall not need to strain much to bring my Text and the day together, Here is
fire in the text, consuming fire, like that whose Antevorta we do this day
commemorate. This fire called for by the Disciples of Christ: so was ours too;
by Christ's Disciples at least, and some of them entitled to our Great Master by
the compellation of his holy name of JESUS.

I would say the parallel holds thus far, but that the persons of my Text,
however Boanerges, sons of thunder and of a reproveable spirit, yet are no
way considerable in the proportion of malice with the persons of the day. For
if I consider the cause that moved James and John to so inconsiderate a wrath,
it bears a fair excuse: The men of Samaria Verse 53.
turned their Lord and Master out of doors, denying to give a nights lodging
to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. It would have disturbed an excellent patience
to see him, whom but just before they beheld trans figured, and in a glorious
Epiphany upon the Mount, to be so neglected by a company of hated Samaritans,
as to be fore'd to keep his vigils where nothing but the welkin should have
been his roof, not any thing to shelter his precious head from the descending
dew of heaven. -- Quis talia fando Temperet?

It had been the greater wonder if they had not been angry. But now if we
should level our progress by the same line and guess that in the present
affair there was an equal cause, because a greater fire was intended, we
shall too much betray the ingenuity of apparent truth, and the blessing of this
Anniversary. They had not half such a case for an excuse to a far greater
malice; it will prove they had none at all, and therefore their malice was
so much the more malicious because causeless and totally inexcusable.

However, I shall endeavor to join their consideration in as near a parallel
as I can; which if it be not exact (as certainly it cannot, where we have
already discovered so much difference in degrees of malice,) yet by laying them
together we may better take their estimate, though it be only by seeing their
disproportion.

The words as they lay in their own order, point out, 1. The persons that ask't
the question. 2. The cause that moved them. 3. The person to whom they
propounded it; 4. The Question it self. 5. And the precedent they urged to
move a grant, drawn from a very fallible Topic, a singular Example, in a
special and different case. The persons here were Christ's Disciples; and so
they are in our case, designed to us by that glorious Surname of Christianity:
they will be called Catholics, but if our discovery perhaps rise higher, and
that the Sea Apostolic prove sometimes guilty of so reproveable a spirit,
then we are very near to a parallel of the persons, for they were Disciples of
Christ, and Apostles. 2. The cause was the denying of toleration of abode upon
the grudge of an old schism, Religion was made the instrument. That which
should have taught the Apostles to be charitable, and the Samaritans
hospitable, was made a pretense to justify the unhospitablenesse of the one and
the uncharitableness of the other. Thus far we are right, for the malice of
this present Treason, stood upon the same base. 3. Although neither Side much
doubted of the lawfulness of their proceedings; yet S. James and S. John were
so discreet as not to think themselves infallible, therefore they asked their
Lord: so did the persons of the day, ask the question too, but not of Christ,
for he was not in all their thoughts; but yet they asked of Christ's Delegates,
who therefore should have given their answer ex eodem tripode, from the same
spirit. They were the Fathers Confessors who were asked. 4. The question is of
both sides concerning a consumptive sacrifice, the destruction of a Town
there, of a whole Kingdom here, but differing in the circumstance of place
whence they would fetch their fire. The Apostles would have had it from Heaven,
but these men's conversation was not there. (...), things from beneath, from an
artificial hell, but breathed from the natural and proper, were in all their
thoughts. 5. The example, which is the last particular, I fear I must leave
quite out, and when you have considered all, perhaps you will look for no
example.

First of the persons; they were Disciples of Christ and Apostles. [But when
James and John saw this,] When first I considered they were Apostles, I
wondered they should be so intemperatly angry; but when I perceived they were
so angry, I wondered not that they sinned. Not the privilege of an Apostolical
spirit, not the nature of Angels, not the condition of immortality can guard
from the danger of sin, but if we be overrul'd by passion, we almost subject
our selves to its necessity. It was not therefore without reason altogether,
that the Stoics affirmed wisemen to be void of passions, for sure I am, the
inordination of any passion is the first step to folly. And although of them,
as of waters of a muddy residence we may make good use, and quench our thirst,
if we do not trouble them, yet upon any ungentle disturbance we drink down
mud in stead of a clear stream, and the issues of sin and sorrow, certain
consequents of temerarious or inordinate anger. And therefore when the Apostle
had given us leave to be angry, as knowing the condition of human nature, he
quickly enters a Caveat that we sin not; he knew sin was very likely to be
handmaid where Anger did domineer, and this was the reason why S. James and S.
John are the men here pointed at, for the Scripture notes them for Boanerges,
sons of thunder, men of an angry temper, and quid mirum est filios tonitrui
fulgurasse voluisse? said S. Ambrose. But there was more in it then thus. Their
spirits of themselves hot enough, yet met with their education under the Law,
(whose first tradition was in fire and thunder, whose precepts were just but
not so merciful;) and this inflamed their distemper to the height of a
revenge. It is the Doctrine of S. Epist. ad Algas.
Hierome and in Lucam.
Titus Bostrensis; The Law had been their Schoolmasters, and taught them the
rules of justice both Punitive and Vindictive: But Christ was the first that
taught it to be a sin to retaliate evil with evil, it was a Doctrine they
could not read in the killing letter of the Law. There they might meet with
precedents of revenge and anger of a high severity, an eye for an eye, and a
tooth for atooth, and let him be cut off from his people: But forgiving
injuries, praying for our persecutors, loving our enemies, and relieving them,
were Doctrines of such high and absolute integrity, as were to be reserved for
the best and most perfect Lawgiver, the bringer of the best promises, to which
the most perfect actions have the best proportion; and this was to be when
Shiloh came. Now then the spirit of Elias is out of date,

-- I am ferrea primum
Desinit, ac toto surgit Gens Aurea Mundo.
And therefore our blessed Master reproves them of ignorance, not of the Law,
but of his spirit, which had they but known or could but have guessed at the
end of his coming, they had not been such Abecedarij in the School of Mercy.

And now we shall not need to look far for persons, Disciples professing at
least in Christ's school, yet as great strangers to the merciful spirit of our
Savior, as if they had been sons of the Law, or foster-brothers to Romulus
and sucked a wolse, and they are Romanists too; this days solemnity presents
them to us, (...), and yet were that washed off, underneath they write
Christian and Jesuit.

One would have expected that such men, set forth to the worlds acceptance with
so merciful a cognomentum, should have put a hand to support the ruinous
fabric of the worlds charity, and not have pulled the frame of heaven and
earth about our ears. But yet -- Necredite Teucri! Give me leave first to make
an Inquisition after this Antichristian pravity, and try who is of our side,
and who loves the King, by pointing at those whose Sermons do blast Loyalty,
breathing forth Treason, slaughters and cruelty, the greatest imaginable
contrariety to the spirit and Doctrine of our Dear Master. So we shall quickly
find out more then a pareil for S. James and S. John the Boanerges of my Text.

It is an act of faith, by faith to conquer the enemies Sanderus de Clave David
Lib. 2. c. 15.
of God and Holy Church, says Sanders our Countryman. Hitherto nothing but
well; If James and John had offered to do no more then what they could have
done with the sword of the spirit and the shield of Faith, they might have
been inculpable, and so had he if he had said no more; but the blood boyles
higher, the manner spoils all. For it is not well done unless a warlike
Captain be appointed by Christ's Vicar to bear a Croisade in a field of blood.
And if the other Apostles did not proceed such an angry way as James and John,
it was only discretion that detained them, not religion. For so they might, and
it were no Ibid. cap. 14.
way unlawful for them to bear arms to propagate Religion, had they not
wanted an opportunity; if you believe the same author: for fighting is proper
for S. Peter and his Successors, therefore because Christ gave him Commission
to feed his Lambs. A strange reason!

I had thought Christ would have his Lambs fed with the sincere milk of his
word, not like to Canibals,

-- solitisque cruentum
Lac potare Getis, and pocula tingere venis,
To mingle blood in their sacrifices (as Herod to the Galilaeans) and quaffe it
off for an auspicium to the propagation of the Christian faith. Me thinks here
is already too much clashing of armor and effusion of blood for a Christian
cause; but this were not altogether so unchristian-like, if the sheep, though
with blood, yet were not to befed with the blood of their shepherd Cyrus, I
mean their Princes. But I find many such Nutritij in the Nurseries of Rome,
driving their Lambs from their folds unless they will be taught to wory the
Lion. Tyrannice gubernans just acquisitum dominium non potest spoliari sine
publico iudicio: Lata vero sententia quisque potest fieri executor. Potest
autem a populo etiam qui iuravit ei obedientiam, simonitus non vult corrigi.
Verb. Tyrannus.


Emanuel Sa, in his Aphorisms, affirms it lawful to kill a King, indeed not
every King, but such a one as rules with Tyranny, and not then, unless the
Pope has sentenced him to death, but then he may; though he be his lawful
Prince. Not the necessitude which the Law of nations has put between Prince
and people, not the obligation of the oath of Allegiance, not the Sanctions of
God Almighty himself, must reverse the sentence against the King when once
past, but any one of his subjects, of his own sworn subjects, may kill him.

This perfidious treasonable position of Sa, is not a single Testimony. For 1.
it slipped not from his pen by inadvertency; it was not made public, until

that old Henry of Castile was cured of his sickness. 4. Lastly, this may be
done, not only if the Pope judge the King a Tyrant (which was the utmost

learned men, though but few, and those seditious too do but murmr it, or
begin to call him so. I Postquam ae paucis seditiosis, sed doctis caeperit

hope this Doctrine was long since disclaimed by the whole Society, and
condemned ad umbras Acherunticas. Perhaps so, but yet these men who use to
object to us an infinity of divisions among our selves, who boast so much of
their own Union and consonancy in judgment, with whom nothing is more ordinary
then to maintain some opinions quite throughout their Order (as if they were
informed by some common Intellectus agens) should not be divided in a matter of
so great moment, so much concerning the Monarchy of the Sea Apostolic, to
which they are vowed leigemen. But I have greater reason to believe them United
in this Doctrine, then is the greatness of this probability. For 1. There was
an Apology printed in Italy, permissu superiorum, in the year 1610. that
says, They were all enemies of that holy Name of Jesus that condemned Mariana
for any such Doctrine. I understand not why, but sure I am that the Jesuits do
or did think his Doctrine innocent: for in their Apology put forth in the name
of the whole Society against the accusations of Anticoton, they deny that the
Assasine of Henry 4. I mean Ravaillac, was moved to kill the King by reading
of Mariana, and are not ashamed to wish that he had read him. Perhaps they
mean it might have Quodamodo optandum esse ut ille Alastor Marianam legisset.
wrought the same effect upon him which the sight of a drunkard did upon the
youth of Lacedaemon, else I am sure it is not very likely he should have been
dissuaded from his purpose by reading in Mariana that it was lawful to do
what he intended. 3. I add they not only thought it innocent, and without
positive Cap. 6. Cum cognito a Theologis quos erat. sciscitatus, Tyrannum jure

hurt, but good and commendable; so that it is apparent that it was not the
opinion of Mariana alone, but that the Moors of Spain had more disciples then
Mariana. 1. He says it himself, for commending the young Monk that killed
Henry 3. he says, he did it having been informed by several Divines that a
Tyrant might lawfully be killed. 2. The thing it self speaks it, for his book

What negligence is sufficient that such a Doctrine as this should pass so
great supravisors, if in their hearts they disavow it? The children of this
world are not such fools in their generations. The Fathers of the Society
cannot but know how apt these things of themselves are to public mischief,
how invidious to the Christian world, how scandalous to their Order; and yet
they rather excuse then condemn Mariana: speaking of him at the hardest but
very gently, as if his only fault had been his speaking a truth in tempore non
opportuno, something out of season, or as if they were forced to yield to the
current of the times, and durst not profess openly of what in their hearts
they were persuaded: I speak of some of them, for others you see are of the
same opinion. But I would feign learn why they are so sedulous and careful to
procure the decrees of the Rector and Deputies of Paris, Rescripts of the
Bishop, Revocation of Arrest of the Parliament which had been against them, and
all to acquit the Fathers of the Society from these scandalous opinions; as if
these laborious devices could make what they have said and done, to be unspoken
and undone, or could change their opinions from what indeed they are, whereas
they never went ex animo to refute these Theorems, never spoke against them in
the real and serious dialect of an adversary, never condemned them as
heretical, but what they have done they have been shamed to, or forced upon,
as Pere Coton by the King of France, and Servin to a confutation of Mariana,
(from which he desired to be excused, and after the Kings death, writ his
declaratory letter to no purpose;) the Apologists of Paris by the outcryes of
Christendom against them; and when it is done, done so coldly in their
reprehensions with a greater readiness to excuse all, then condemn any, I say
these things to a considering man do increase the suspicion if at least that
may be called suspicion for which we have had so plain testimonies of their own.

I add this more, to put the business past all question, that when some
things of this nature were objected to them by Arnald the French Kings
Advocate, they were so far from denying them or excusing them, that they
maintained them in spite of opposition, putting forth a Book entitled Veritas
defensa contra actionem Antonii Arnaldi. What the things were for which they
stood up patrons, hear themselves speaking, Tum enim id non solum potest Page
7. 1. edit.
Papa, sed etiam debet se ostendere superiorem illis [Principibus.] Exceptio
haec stomachum tibi commovet, facit ut ringaris, sed oportet haurias, and de

The Advocate is affirmed to be void both of reason and honesty for denying the
Popes dominion over Kings. The reason follows, The Pope could not keep them to
their duties, unless he kept them in awe with threatening them the loss of
their Kingdoms. But this is but the least part of it. Page 67. 1. edit.
They add, If the subjects had been but disposed as they should have been,
there was no time but it might have been profitable to have exercised the sword
upon the persons of Kings. Let them construe their meaning, those are their
words. But see farther.

The damned act of Jacques Clement the Monk upon the life of Henry the third of
France, of Iean Chastel and Ravaillac upon Henry the fourth, are notorious in
the Christian world, and yet the first of these was commended by Voyez. le
process de Parliam. de Paris contre le pere Guignard presire Jesuit.
F. Guignard in a discourse of purpose, and by Mariana as I before cited him.
The second had two Apologies made for him, the one by Vid. cap. 3.

other without a name indeed, but with the mark and cognizance of the Jesuits
order, and the last was publicly commended in a Sermon by a Monk of Colein,
as it is reported by the excellent Thuanus.

Not much less then this is that of Baronius, just I am sure of the same
spirit with James and John, for he calls for a ruin upon the Venetians for
opposing of his Holiness. Arise Peter, not to feed the sowandring sheep, but
to destroy them, throw away thy Pastoral staff and take thy sword. I confess
here is some more ingenuity, to oppose Murdering to Feeding then to make them
all one, as Sanders does, but yet De clave David cap. 14. Vide page 7.
the same fiery spirit inflames them both, as if all Rome were on fire, and
would put the world in a combustion.

Farther yet. Guignard a Jesuit of Clerimont College in Paris was executed by
command of the Parliament for some conclusions he had writ which Arrest. de
Parliam. 7. de Tanv. 1595.
were of a high nature treasonable, and yet as if, either there were an
infallibility in every person of the Society, or as if the Parliament had done
in justice in condemning Guignard, or lastly as if they approved his Doctrine,
he was Apologiz'd for by Expostul. Apologet. pro Societ. Jesus.
Jews Richeome, and Amphith. honor. lib. 1.
Bonarscius. I know they will not say that every Jesuit is infallible, they are
not come to that yet, it is plain then they are of the same mind with Guignard,
or else (which I think they dare not say) the Parliament was unjust in the
condemnation of him, but if they do, they thus proclaim their approbation of
these Doctrines he was hanged for; for that he had such, was under his own
hand, by his own confession, and of it self evident; as is to be seen in the
Arrest of the Parliament against him.

Lastly, more pertinent to the day is the fact of Garnet, who because a Jesuit
could have done nothing for which he should not have found an Apologist, for
even for this his last act of high treason he was Apologiz'd for, by Apol. adv.
R. Angliae.
Bellarmine, Stigm. Miseric.
Gretser, and Apol. pro Garnetto.
Eudaemon Johannes.

Thus far we have found out persons fit enough to match any malice; Boanerges
all, and more then a pareil for James and John: but I shall anon discover the
disease to be more Epidemicall, and the pest of a more Catholic infection, and
yet if we sum up our accounts, we shall already find the doctrine to be too
Catholic. For we have already met with Emanuel Sa a Portugal, Mariana and
Ribadineira Spaniards, Bonarscius a bas Almain, Gretser a German, Eudaemon
Johannes a false Greek, Guignard, Richeome and the Apologists for Chastell,
Frenchmen, Bellarmine and Baronius, Italians, Garnet and Sanders, English.

The Doctrine you see they would fain make Catholic, now if it prove to be but
Apostolic too, then we have found out an exact parallel for James and John,
great Disciples and Apostles, and whether or no the Sea Apostolic may not
sometime be of a fiery and consuming spirit, we have so strange examples, even
in our own home, that we need seek no farther for resolution of the Quaere. In
the Bull of excommunication put forth by Pius quintus against Q. Elizabeth of
blessed memory, there is more then a naked encouragement, as much as comes to a
Volumus and Iubemus ut adversus Elizabetham Angliae Reginam subditi arma
capessent. Bone Jesus! in quae nos reservasti tempora? Here is a command to
turn rebels, a necessity of being Traitors. Quid eo infelicius, cui iam esse
malum necesse est?

The business is put something farther homeby Catena and Gabutius, who writ
the life of Pius quintus, were resident at Rome, one of them an advocate in the
Roman Court; their Books both printed at Rome, con licenza, and con
privilegio. And now hear 1588. 1605.
their testimonies of the whole business between the Queen and his Holiness.

Pius quintus published a Bull against Q. Elizabeth, declared her a Heretic,
and deprived her of her Kingdom, absolved her subjects from their oath of
Allegiance, Pio publico una bolla and sentezza co^tra Elisabetta, dichiarandola
heretica, and priva delregno,.... in tal forma concedendo che ciascuno andar
contra le potesse etc. Girolamo Catena p. 114. Il quale.... muovesse gli animi
al sollevamento per distruttione d' Elizabetta. Page 113. L^andare in persona,
inpegnae tutte le softanze della sede Apostolica, and calici, e^i proprii
vestimenti. Page 117.
excommunicated her, and gave power to any one to rebel against her etc. This
was but the first step, he therefore thus proceeds, He procures a gentleman of
Florence to move her Subjects to a rebellion against her for her destruction.
Farther yet, he thought this would be such a real benefit to Christendom to
have her destroyed, that the Pope was ready to aid in person, to spend the
whole revenew of the Sea Apostolic, all the Chalices and crosses of the
Church, and even his very cloths to promote so pious a business as was the
destruction of Q. Elizabeth.

The witnesses of truth usually agree in one. The same story is told by De*
vita and Gestis Pii 5. lib. 3. cap. 9.
Antonius Gabutius, and some more circumstances added. First he names the end
of the Popes design, it was to take her life away, in case she would not turn
Roman Catholic. To atchieve this, because no Legate could come into England,
nor any public messenger from the Sea Apostolic he employed a Florentine
Merchant to stir her subjects to a rebellion for her perdition. Nothing but
Sollevamento, Qui incolaru^ animos ad Elizabethae perditionem. rebellione facta
commoveret.
Rebellion, Perdition and destruction to the Queen could be thought upon by his
Holiness.

More yet; for when the Duke of Alva had seized upon the English Merchants
goods which were at Antwerp, the Pope took the occasion, instigated the King of
Spain to aid the pious attempts of those who conspired against the Queen: they
are the words of Gabutius. This rebellion was intended to be under Efflagitabat
ab Rege ut Anglorum in Elizabetham pie conspiranrium studio foveret.
the conduct of the Duke of Norfolk, Viro Catholico, a Roman Catholic,
Gabutius notes it, for fear some Heretik might be suspected of the design, and
so the Catholics loose the glory of the action. However Pius quintus intended
to use the utmost and most extreme remedies to cure her heresy, and all means
to increase and strengthen the rebellion. I durst not have thought so much of
his Holiness, if his own had not said it; but if this be not worse then the
fiery spirit which our blessed Savior reproved in James and John, I know not
what is.

I have nothing to do to specify the spirit of Paulus quintus in the Venetian
cause; this only, Baronius propounded the example of Gregory the seventh
Hildebrand.
to him, of which how far short he came, the world is witness. Our own
business calls to mind the Bulls of Pope Clement the eight, in which the
Catholics in England were commanded to see that however the right of
succession did entitle any man to the Crown of England, yet if he were not a
Catholic, they should have none of him, but with all their power they should
hinder his coming in. This Bull Bellarmine does extremely magnify, and indeed
Apol. adv. R. Angl.
it was for his purpose, for it was (if not author) yet the main encourager of
Cates by to the Powder Treason. For when Garnet would willingly have known the
Popes mind in the business, Cates by eased him of the trouble of sending to
Rome, since the Popes mind was clear. I doubt not (said Cates by) at all of
Proced agt. Traitors.
the Popes mind, but that he, who commanded our endeavors to hinder his coming
in, is willingenough we should throw him out. It was but a reasonable
collection.

I shall not need to instance in the effects which this Bull produced; the
Treason of Watson and Cleark, two English Seminaries are sufficiently known, it
was as a Praeludium or warning piece to the great Fougade, the discharge of the
Powder Treason. Briefly, the case was so, that after the Publication of the
Bull of Pius quintus, these Catholics in England durst not be good Subjects
till F. Parsons and Campian got a dispensation that they might for a while do
it, and rebus sic stantibus with a safe conscience profess a general
obedience in causes Temporal: and after the Bull of Clement a great many of
them were not good subjects, and if the rest had not taken to themselves the
Privilege which the Pope ^^noc. Decretal de rescript cap. si quando.
sometimes gave to the Archbishop of Ravenna, either to do as the Pope bid
them, or to pretend a reason why they would not: we may say as Creswell in
defense of Cardinal Allen; Certainly we might have had Philop page 212. n. 306.
more bloody tragedies in England, if the moderation of some more discreetly
temperd had not been interposed. However it is no thank to his Holiness, his
spirit blew high enough.

But I will open this secret no farther, if I may have but leave to instance
once more. If I mistake not, it was Sixtus Quintus who sometimes pronounced
^ep. 11. 1589
a speech in full Consistory, in which he compares the assasinat of Jacques
Clement upon Henry the third, to the exploits of Eleazar and Judith, where
after having aggravated the faults of the murdered King, concluded him to have
died impenitent, denied him the solemnities of Mass, Dirge and Requiem, for
his soul, at last he ends with a prayer, that God would finish what in this
(bloody) manner had been begun. I will not aggravate the foulness of the
thing by any circumstances (though I cannot but wonder that his Holiness
should say a prayer of so much abomination,) it is of it self too bad.

If his Holiness be wronged in the business I have no hand in it; the speech
was printed at Paris three By Nichol. Nivelle, and Rollin Thierry.
months after the murder of the King, and avouched for authentic by the
approbation of three Doctors, Boucher, Decreil, and Ancelein; let them answer
it, I wash my hands of the accusation, and only consider the danger of such
Doctrines, if set forth with so great authority and practiced by so
uncontrollable persons.

If the Disciples of Christ, if Apostles, if the Sea Apostolic, if the
fathers Confessors prove Boutefeu's and Incendiaries, I Will no more wonder if
the people call for fire to consume us, but rather wonder if they do not. And
indeed although it be no rare or unusual thing for a Papist to be de facto
loyal and duteous to his Prince, yet it is a wonder that he is so since such
Doctrines have been taught by so great Masters, and at the best he depends
but upon the Popes pleasure for his Loyalty, which upon what security it rests,
you may easily guess from the antecedents.

Thus much for consideration of the persons who asked the Question; they were
Christ's Disciples, they were James and John.

But when James and John [saw this] Our next inquiry shall be of the cause of
this their angry Question. This we must learn from the foregoing story.
Christ was going to the feast at Jerusalem, and passing through a Village of
Samaria asked lodging for a night; but they perceiving that he was a Jew Ver.

would by no means entertain him, as being of a different Religion. For
although God appointed that all of the seed of Jacob should go up to Jerusalem
to worship, (...), yet the Chrysostom. in hunc locum.

will make it good by turning their Adversaries out of doors. They shall not
come near their blessed Mount of Gerezim, but fastening an Anathema on them let
them go to Ebal, and curse there. And now I wonder not that these Disciples
were very angry at them who had lost the true Religion, and neglected the
offices of humanity to them that kept it. They might go near now to make it a
cause of Religion; (...) (as Nazianzene speaks) might seem to Apologize Orat.

for them, and so it might if it had not led them to indiscreet and
uncharitable zeal. But men care not how far they go if they do but once
think they can make God a party of their Quarrel. For when Religion which
ought to be the antidote of our malice, proves its greatest incentive, our
uncharitableness must needs run faster to a mischief, by how much that
which stopped it is course before, drives it on with the greater violence. And
therefore as it is ordinary for charity to be called coldness in Religion, so
it is as ordinary for a pretense of Religion to make cold charity.

The present case of the Disciples and the same spirit which, for the same
pretended cause, is takenup by the persons of the day, proves all this true;
with whom fire and faggot is esteemed the best argument to convince the
understanding, and the Inquisitors of heretical pravity, the best Doctors and

mulieribus. For thus we had like to have suffered, it was mistaken Religion
that moved these Traitors to so damnable a Conspiracy, not for any defense of
their own cause, but for extirpation of ours. For else what grievances, did
they groan under? In quos Orat 2. in Julian.
eorum populum exaestuantem sollicitavimus? quibus vitae periculum attulimus?
It was Nazianzen's question to the Apostate. Give me leave to consider it as
appliable to our present case, and try if can make a just discovery of the
cause that moved these Traitors to so accursed a Conspiracy.

1 Then there was no cause at all given them by us; none put to death for being
a Roman Catholic nor any of them punished for his Religion. Vid. L. Burleighs
book called Execution for Treason not religion. King James his declaration to
all Christian Kings and Princes, and the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his
speech in Star Chamber in Burtons case.


This has been the constant attestation of our Princes and State since the
first Laws made against Recusants and the thing it self will bear them record.

From primo of Elizabeth to undecimo, the Papists made no scruple of coming to
our Churches, Recusancy was not then so much as a Chrysome, not an Embrio. But
when Pius quintus sent forth his Breves of Excommunication and Deposition of
the Queen, then first they forbore to pray with us, or to have any religious
communion. This although every where known, yet being a matter of fact and so
as likely to be denied by others as affirmed by us without good evidence, see
it therefore affirmed expressly by an Act of Parliament in Decimo tertio of
Elizabeth, which specifies this as one inconvenience and ill consequence of the
Bull. [Whereby has grown great disobedience and boldness in many, not only to
withdraw and absent themselves from divine service, now most Godly set forth
and used within this Realm, but also have thought themselves discharged of all
obedience etc.] Not only Recusancy, but like wise disobedience; therefore both
Recusancy and disobedience.

Two years therefore after this Bull* this Statute was made if it was possible
to nullify the effects of it, to hinder its execution, and if it might be, by
this means to keep them, as they had been before, in Communion with the Church
of England, and obedience to her Majesty. This was the first Statute that
concerned them in special, but yet their Religion was not meddled with; For
this Statute against execution of the Popes Bulls was no more the^ what had
been established by Act of Parliament, in the 16th year of Richard the second,
by which it was made praemunire to purchase Bulls from Rome, and the
delinquents in this kind with all their [abettors, fautors, procurators, and
maintainers to be referred to the Kings Council for farther punishment.] There
was indeed this severity expressed in the Act of 130 of the Queen, that the
putting them in Execution should be Capital; and yet this severity was no more
then what was inflicted upon the Bishop of Ely in Edward the thirds time, for
publishing of a Bull against the Earl of Chester without the Kings leave, and
on the Bishop of Carlisle, in the time of Henry the fourth, for the like
offense. Thus far our Laws are innocent.

But when this Statute did not take the good effect for which it was intended,
neither keeping them in their ancient Communion not obedience, but for all
this, Main, Campian, and many others, came as the Popes Emissaries for
execution of the Bull, the State proceeded to a farther severity, making Laws
against Recusancy, against Seditious and Traiterous Books, and against the
residence of Romish Priests in England, making the first fineable with a
pecuniary mulct, the two later, Capital, as being made of a Treasonable
nature. Of these in order.

1 The mulct which was imposed for Recusancy, was not soul money, or paid for
Religion; and that for these reasons. 1. Because it is plain Religion did not
make them absent themselves from our Churches, unless they had changed their
Religion since the Bull came over. For if Religion could consist with their
Communion with us before the Bull (as it is plain it did) then why not after the
Bull, unless it be part of their Religion to obey the Pope, rather then to
obey God commanding us to obey our Prince? 2. Their Recusancy was an apparent
mischief to our Kingdom, and it was the prevention or diversion of this that
was the only or special and of these Laws.

The mischief is apparent these two ways. 1. Because by their Recusancy they
gave attestation that they held the Bull to be valid; for else why should they
after the Bull deny their Communion, which before they did not? Either they
must think the Queen for a just cause, and by a just power excommunicate, or
why did they separate from her Communion? Now if the Queen by virtue of the
Bull was excommunicate, why should they stop here? She was by the same deposed,
they absolved from all Allegiance to her, and commanded to take arms against
her. I confess it is no good argument of it self, to say, The Pope might
excommunicate the Queen, therefore depose her from her Kingdom; But this
concludes with them sufficiently, with whom excommunication not only drives
from Spiritualls, but deprives of Temporalls, and is not to mend our lives but
to take them away; I speak how it is in the case of Princes, (and I shall anon
prove it) for they being public persons from whose Deposition more may be
gotten, are like to suffer more, ui ex tunc ipse (Pontifex) vasallos ab ejus
fidelitate denuntiet absolutos, and terram exponat Catholic is occupandam, as
they are taught by Pope Innocent the third, in the eight Lateran Council: such
is their Excommunication for matter of Heresy, as was this pretended in the
Queens case, so that in respect of them the danger was apparent.

2 It is plain that Recusancy and disobedience came actually hand in hand, I
say not that one was the issue of the other, but that they were coetaneous, for
the same persons that moved them to Recusancy by virtue of the Bull, moved them
to the execution of it per omnia. Now see whither this would tend! They by
Recusancy were better able to judge of their forces in England, and what party
they were able to make for execution of the Bull, whilst by that as by a
discriminative cognizance they were pointed at, as Abettors of the Catholic
cause.

Thus far they suffered not for their Religion or conscience, unless it were
against their conscience to be good subjects, and then it was not Religion, at
least not Christian, that was inconsistent with their Loyalty, and so hitherto
inrespect of us, their machination was altogether causeless.

2. For the second (I mean the writing and publishing of Seditious and
Traiterous Books, I shall not need to say any thing in defense of its being
made Capital, though sometimes they accuse our laws for it) for Apud Linwood
de senten. excommunicat. Item omnes illos excommunicationis innodanus sententia
qui pacem and tranquillitatem Domini Regis and Regni, iniuriose perturhare
praesumunt, and qui iura Domini Regis iniusle detinere contendunt.
they were ever so, and of a high nature Treasonable, and the Publishers of
the^ by the Canons of the Church were ipsofacto excommunicate. This I noted,
because the same censure involves more, by virtue of the same Canon: I mean,
not only the seditious Libellers but impugners of the Kings Regalties, as also
the Bringers, Publishers, and Executioners of the Bull; as is to be seen in
the constitution of Archbishop Stephen, in a Council held at Oxford. But
secondly, whether they were or were not, it matters nothing; this I suppose was
no part of their Religion, therefore this might be made Treason, and yet their
Religion and peace of conscience undistarbed. 3. But the next is the main
outcry of all, the very Conclamatum est of the Catholic cause, if suffered;
it was made Treason to be a Priest, or at least if any of their Priests should
be found in England he should be adjudged a Traitor, and these Laws were not
yet repealed, but then in execution.

When certain Sycophants told Philip of Macedon, that some of his discontented
Subjects called him Tyrant, his answer was, Rudes sunt Macedones, and scapham
vocant scapham. I wish these men who object this, had the same ingenuity, and
would acknowledge that the rudeness of a Macedonian teltroth is no apparent
calumny. And truly, as the case then stood, it was no worse. For consider that
the statute against Priests was not made till sixteen years after the Bull of
Pius quintus, and after much evidence both by the confession of some Priests
themselves, and diverse Lay-persons, that at least, many of them came into
England with this errand, that they might instigate the Queens liege people to
the Execution of it. This is very plain in the case of Main the Jesuit, and
M. Tregion who were executed 1577.
at Launston for the same business.

The state could not certainly know what would be the issue, but yet could not
but think it likely to produce more and worse consequences for the future.
Leges aute^ justae in facta constituuntur quia futura Tacitus lib. 3. Annal.
in incerto sunt. The Queen then providing for her safety banished these
Priests out of her dominions. This was all, and this done with so much lenity
and moderation as if of purpose to render good for their evil; such was her
innocence, and yet to provide for her safety, such was her prudence. She gave
them forty days time of preparation for their journey, imposed no penalty for
their longer stay in case that any of them were less healthful, or that the
winds were cross, or that the wether served not: provided that during their
stay, they gave security for their due obedience to her laws, and that they
should attempt nothing against her person or government, for this was all she
aimed at; but if they obeyed not the Proscriptio^, having no just cause to the
contrary, such as were expressed in the Act, then it should be adjudged their
errand was not right, and therefore (not their Religion, but) their
disobedience Treasonable.

This was the highest (...) of the severity of this state against them, now
first I shall briefly show that this proscription which was the highest
penalty, was for just cause as the case then stood, and deserved on their part.
2. It was but reasonable, in case they obeyed not the proscription, their stay
should be made Treason. 1. Because the Priests did generally preach the Popes
power either directly over temporalls, or else in order to spiritualls, of
which the Pope being judge it would come to the same issue, and this was
dangerous to the peace of the Kingdom, and entrenched too much upon the
Regalty. In particular, the case of bringing from the Sea of Rome, and
publishing of Bulls, was by the Lords of the Parliament in the sixteenth year
of Richard the second, judged to be [cleerely in derogation of the Kings Crown
and of his Regalty, as it is well known and has been of a long time known,]
and therefore they protested [together and every one severally by himself,
that they would be with the same Crown and Regalty in these cases specially,
and in all other cases which shall be attempted against the same Crown and
Regalty in all points with all their power,] I hope then if the State in the
time of Queen Elizabeth having far greater reason then ever, shall judge that
these Bulls, the publishing of them, the Preaching of their validity, and
reconciling by virtue of them her Subjects to the Sea of Rome, be derogatory to
her Crown and Regalty, I see no reason She should be frighted from her just
defense with the bugbear of pretended Religion, for if it was not against
Religion then, why is it now? I confess there is a reason for it, to wit,
because now the Popes power is an Article of Faith (as I shall show anon) but
then it was not with them, any more then now it is with us: but whether this
will convince any man of reason I leave it to himself to consider.

But one thing is observeable in that Act of Parliament of Richard the second,
I mean this clause [as it is well known, and has been of a long time
known.] The Popes encroachments upon the State of England had been an old
sore, and by its eld almost habituate; but yet it grieved them nevertheless,
nor was the less a fever for being hecticall: but so it is that I am confident
upon very good grounds, it may be made as apparent as the noon Sun, for these
600 years and upwards, that the Bishops of Rome have exercised so extreme and
continual Tyranny and exactions in this Kingdom, that our condition was under
him worse then the State of the Athenians under their thirty Tyrants, or then
our neighbors are now under their Belgic Tributes. So many greivances of the
people, expilations of the Church, abuses to the State, intrenchments upon the
Royalties of the Crown were continued, that it was a great blessing of Almighty
God, our Kingdom was delivered from them upon so easy terms, which Grosthead
Bishop of Lincoln thought would never be done, but in Oregladii cruentandi:
and now to have all these mischiefs return with more strength upon us by the
attempts of these Priests, had been the highest point of indiscretion and
sleepiness. I said [with more strength] because what anciently at the highest
was thought but a privilege of the Church began now to be an Article of Faith,
and therefore if admitted would have bound stronger and without all possibility
of redress.

And now if after all this any man should doubt of the justice of these Laws
against the Priests obtruding upon the State the Popes power, I only refer
him to the Parliament of Paris, where let him hold his Plea against those great
Sages of the Law, for their just censures upon Florentinus Iacobus, Thomas
Blanzius, and John Tanquerell, who were all condemned 1561.
to a solemn honorary penance and satisfaction to the State, and not without
extreme difficulty escaped death, for the same cause. But this is not all. I
add.

Secondly, the Pope had his Agent in England to stir up the Subjects to
rebel against the Queen, as I proved before by the testimonies of Catena and
Gabutius. It is not then imaginable that he should so poorly intend his own
designs, to employ one on purpose, and he but a Merchant, and that the Priests
who were the men, if any, most likely to do the business, should be
un-imployed. I speak not of the argument from matter of fact, (for it is
apparent that they were employed, as I showed but now,) but it is plain also
that they must have been employed, if we had had no other argument but a
presumption of the Popes ordinary discretion.

Things then remaining in this condition what security could the Queen or State
have without the absence of those men who must be the instruments of their
mischief? Thirdly, there was great reason those men might be banished who
might from their own principles plead immunity from all Laws, and
subordination to the Prince. But that so these Priests might, I only bring two
witnesses, leading men of their own Side. Thus Bellarmine: The Pope has
exempted all Clerks from subjection to Princes Lib. 1. cap. 2^. de Cleri^^^.
The same is taught by Emanuel S a in his Aphorisms, Verbo Clericus. I must
not dissemble that this Aphorism however it passed the Press at first, yet in
the Edition of Paris it was left out. The cause is known to every man: For that
it was merely to serve their ends is apparent; for their French freedom was
there taken from them, they durst not parler tout so near the Parliament; but
the Aphorism is to this day retained in the Editions of Antwerp and Colein.

If this be their Doctrine, as it is plain it is taught by these leading
Authors, I mean Sa and Bellarmine, I know no reason but it may be very just and
most convenient to deny those men the Country from whose Laws they plead
exemption.

Secondly, it was but reasonable, in case they obeyed not the proscriptio^,
their disobedience should be made Capital. For if they did not obey, then
either they sinned against their conscience in disobeying their lawful Prince,
and so are (...), and inexcusable from the Laws penalty, which may be extended
at the pleasure of the Lawgiver, where there is no positive injustice in the
disproportion; or if they did not sin against their conscience, then of
necessity must they think her to be no lawful Prince or not their lawful
Prince, nor they her Subjects, and so ipso facto are guilty of high Treason,
and their execution De simply. Pralat.
was for Treason not Religion, and so the Principal is evicted which I shall
beg leave to express in S. Cyprians language, Non erat illa fidei Corona, sed
poena per fidiae; nec religiosae virtutis exitus gloriosus, sed desperationis
interitus.

For if Valentius banish Eusebius from Samosata, and Eusebius obey not the
edict, if Valentius puts him to death, it is not for his being a Christian that
Theodoret. l. 4. c. 14.
he suffers death, but for staying at Samosata against the command of
Valentius. Such was the case of the Priests, whom for just cause (as I have
proved) and too apparent proof of seditious practices the Queen banished. Now
if the Queen was their lawful Sovereign, then were they bound to obey her
Decree of exile, though it had been unjust as was the case of Eusebius; or if
they did not obey, not to think the Laws unjust for punishing their
disobedience. I say again, their Disobedience, not their Religion: for that it
was not their Religion that was struck at by the justice of these Laws, but
the security of the Queen and State only aimed at, (besides what I have already
said,) is apparent to the evidence of sense. For when Heart, and Bosgrave,
Jesuits both, came into England against the Law, they were apprehended and
imprisoned: (for the Laws without just Execution were of no force for the
Queens safety;) but when these men had acknowledged the Queens legitimate
power, and put in their security for their due obedience, they obtained their
pardon and their liberty. The same proceedings were in the case of Horton and
Rishton, all which I hope were not Apostates from their Order or Religion, but
so they must have been or not have escaped death, in case that their Religion
had been made Capital. Lastly, this Statute extended only to such Priests who
were made Priests since Primo of Elizabeth, and were born in England. It was
not Treason for a French Priest to be in England, but yet so it must have been
if Religion had been the thing they aimed at. But it is so foul a Calumny, I am
ashamed to stand longer to efute it. The proceedings of the Church and State of
England were just, honorable and religious, full of mercy and discretion, and
unless it were that as C. Fimbria complained of Q. Scaevola, we did not open
our breasts wide enough to receive the danger, there is no cause imaginable, I
mean on our parts, to move them to so damned a conspiracy, or indeed to any
just complaint.

Secondly, if these were not the causes (as they would feign abuse the world
into a persuasion that they were,) what was? I shall tell you, if you will give
me leave (...), to derive it from its very head, and then I will leave it to
you to judge whether or no my Augury fails me.

First, I guess that the Traitors were encouraged and primarily moved to this
Treason from the prevailing opinion which is most generally received on that
side of the lawfulness of deposing Princes that are Heretical. I say
generally received, and I shall make my words good, or else the blame shall lay
on themselves for deceiving me when they declare their own minds. I instance
first in the Fathers of the Society. Nec ulla eis injuria fire si deponantur.

Bellarmine teaches that Kings have no wrong done them if they be deprived of
their Kingdoms when they prove Heretics. Creswell in his Philopater goes
farther, saying, that if his Heresy be manifest he is deposed without any
explicit judicial sentence of the Pope, the Law it self has passed the
sentence of deposition. And therefore

Bonarscius is very angry at Arnald the French Kings Advocate for affirming
that Religion could be no just cause to depose a lawful Prince, If he had
been brought up in their Schools he might have learnt another lesson; papa

Cap. ^.


This Doctrine is not the private opinion of these Doctors, but est certa,
definita, atque indubitata virorum clarissimorum sententia, says F. Creswell,
I suppose Vbi sapra p. 107.
he means in his own Order; and yet I must take heed what I say, for
Eudaemon Johannes is very angry with Sr Edward Cook for saying it is the
Doctrine of the Jesuits. Do they then deny it? No surely, but Non est
Iesuitarum propria, it is not theirs alone, Apol. pro Garnet. ^. ^.
sed ut Garnett us respondit, totius Ecclesiae, and quidem ab antiquissimis
temporibus consensione recepta Doctrina nostra est, and there he reckons up
seven and twenty famous Authors of the same opinion. Creswell in his Philopater
says as much, if not more: Hinc etiam infert Vniversa Theologorum and Iuris

and de fide, quemcunque Principem Christianum, si a religione Catholica
manifest deflexerit, and alios avocare voluerit, excidere statim omni
potestate ac dignitate ex ipsa vi juris tum Humani tum Divini. You see how
easily they swallow this great camel. Add to this that Bellarmine himself
prooves that the Popes temporal power, or of disposing of Princes Kingdoms is
a Catholic Doctrine, for he reckons Contra Barclaium in prin cip. fere.
up of this opinion, one and twenty Italians, fourteen French, nine Germans,
seven English and Scotch, nineteen Spaniards, and these not e faece plebis, but
e primoribus, all very famous and very leading Authors.

You see it is good Divinity amongst them, and I have made it good that it is a
general opinion received by all their Side if you will believe themselves and
now let us see if it will pass for good Law as well as good Divinity.

It is not for nothing that the Church of France protests against some of their
received Canons; if they did not I know not what would become of their Princes.
Their Lillies may be to day, and to morrow be cast into the oven, if the Pope
either call their Prince Huguenot, as he did Henry the fourth, or Tyrant as
Henry the third, or unprofitable for the Church or Kingdom, as he did King
Childeric, whom Pope Zechary, de facto did depose for the same cause, and
inserted his act into the body of the Law as a precedent for the future, quod
etiam ex authoritate Can. Alius. cause. 15. q. 6.
frequenti agit sancta Ecclesia, it is impaled in a parenthesis in the body of
the Canon, least deposition of Princes should be taken for news. The law is
clear for matter of fact; the lawfulness follows.

[Haereticis licitum est auferri quae habent,] and this not only from a private
man, but even from Princes, Cl. 1. in Summa 23. q. 7.
[nam qui in majore dignitate, est plus punitur] or take it if you please in
more proper terms. [Dominus Gl. cap. Exco^munica^^^ tit. de (...). l. 5.
Papa Principem saecularem deponere potest propter haeresim,] and so another
may be chosen like the Palatines and Castellans in Poland, just as if the King
were dead, Nam per haeresim plusquam civiliter mortuus censetur, says
Simancha, and that by virtue of a constitution of Gregory the ninth, by which
every Cap. 45. de paenit.
man is freed from all duty, homage, allegiance or subordination whatsoever due
to a Heretic, whether due by a natural, civil, or political right; [aliquo
pacto, aut quacunque firmitate vallatum.] Et sic nota (says the gloss) quod
Papa potest absolvere La^cum de iur amento fidelitatis.

I end those things with the attestation of Bellarmine, Contra Barclaiumc. ap.
3.
Est res certa and explorata a posse Pontificem maximum just is de causis
temporalibus iudicare, atque ipsos Temporales Principes aliquando deponere. And
again that we may be sure to know of what nature this doctrine is, he repeats
it; Sic igitur de potestate in Temporalibus quod ea sit in Papa non Opinio, sed
Certitudo apud Catholicos est. And now let any man say if this be not a
Catholic Doctrine, and a likely antecedent to have Treason to be its
consequent.

But I fix not here, only this, it is plain that this proposition is no
friend to Loyalty; but that which follows is absolutely inconsistent with it,
in case our Prince be of a different persuasion in matters of Religion. For,

2 It is not only lawful to depose Princes that are heretical, but it is
necessary, and the Catholics are bound to do it sub mortali. I know not
whether it be so generally, I am sure it is as confidently taught as the
former, and by as great Doctors.

Ecclesia nimis graviter erraret si admitteret allquem Lib. 5. de Romans Pout c.
7.
Regem, qui vellet impune fovere quamlibet Sectam, and defendere haereticos. So
Bellarmine. And again, Non licet Christianis tolerare Regem haereticum, si
conetur pertrahere subditos ad suam haeresim. But F. Creswell puts the
business home to purpose, Certe Ibid.
non tantum licet, sed summa etiam iuris Divini necessitate, ac praecepto, imo
conscientiae vinculo arctissimo, Philopat p. 110 n. 162.
and extremo animarum suarum periculo ac discrimine Christianis omnibus hoc
ipsum incumbit, si praestare rem possint. Under peril of their souls they
must not suffer an heretical Prince to reign over them. Possunt and debent
eum arcere ex hominum Christianorum Page 106. n. 157.
dominatu, ne alios inficiat etc.

3 He that says Subjects may and are bound to depose their Princes, and to
drive them from all rule over Christians, if they be able, means something
more: For what if the Prince resist? still he is bound to depose him if he be
able. How if the Prince make a war? The Catholic subject must do his duty
nevertheless, and war too, if he be able. He that says he may wage a war
with his Prince, I doubt not but thinks he may kill him; and if the fortune of
the war lights so upon him, the subject cannot be blamed, for doing of his
duty.

It is plain that killing a Prince is a certain consequent of deposing him,
unless the Prince be bound in conscience to think himself a Heretic, when
the Pope declares him so, and be likewise bound not to resist, and besides all
this will perform these his obligations, and as certainly think himself
heretical, and as really give over his Kingdom quietly, as he is bound. For
in case any of these should fail, there can be but very slender assurance of
his life. I would be loath to obtrude upon men the odious consequences of their
opinions, or to make any thing worse which is capable of a fairer construction;
but I crave pard on in this particular, the life of Princes is sacred, and is
not to be violated so much as in thought, or by the most remote consequence of
a public doctrine: But here indeed it is so immediate and natural a
consequent of the former that it must not be dissembled. But what shall we
think if even this blasphemy be taught in terminis? See this too.

In the year 1407. when the Duke of Orleans had been slain by John of
Burgundy, and the fact notorious beyond a possibility of concealment, he
thought it his best way to employ his Chaplain to justify the act, pretending
that Orleans was a Tyrant. This stood him in small stead; for by the
procurement of Gerson, it was decreed in the Council of Constance, that
Tyranny was no sufficient cause for a man to kill a Prince. But yet I find
that even this decree will not stand Princes in much stead. First, because the
decree runs [ut nemo privata Authoritate etc.] but if the Pope commands it,
then it is Iudicium publicum, and so they are never the more secure for all
this. Secondly, because Marianae tells us, that this Decree is nothing. Namque
id decretum (Concilij Constantiensis) Romano Pontifici Martino quinto probatum
non invenio, non Eugenio aut De Reg and R. instit. lib. 1. c. 6
Successoribus, quorum consensu Conciliorum Ecclesiasticorum sanctitas stat.
Thirdly, because though the Council had forbidden killing of Tyrannical
Princes even by public authority, though this Decree had been confirmed by
the Pope, which yet it was not, yet Princes are never the more secure if they
be convict of Heresy, and therefore let them but add Heresy to their Tyranny,
and this Council Non obstante they may be killed by any man; for so it is
determined in an Apology made for Chastel, Licitum esse privatis and singulis
Reges and Principes Haereseos Franc. Verum. Constable. p. 2. c. 2.
and Tyrannidis condemnatos occidere, non obstante Decreto Concilij
Constantiensis; And the Author of the Book de iusta abdicatione Henrici. 3.
affirms it not only lawful but meritorious.

How much less then this is that of Bellarmine? De Pont. R. lib. 5. c 6.
Si Temporalia obsint fini Spirituali, Spiritualis potestas potest and debet
coercere Temporalem, omni ratione ac via. If omni ratione, then this of killing
him in case of necessity or greater convenience, must not be excluded. But to
confess the business openly and freely; It is known that either the Consent
of the people, or the Sentence of the Pope, or Consent of learned men is with
them held to be a publicum Iudicium, and sufficient to sentence a Prince and
convict him of Heresy or Tyranny. That opinion which makes the people Judge is
very rare amongst them but almost generally exploded, that opinion which Vide
(...). Image of both Churches.
makes the learned to be their Judge is I think proper to Mariana or to a few
more with him, but that the sentence of the Pope is a sufficient conviction of
him, and a complete Judicial act, is the most Catholic opinion on that
Side, as I shall show anon. Now whether the Pope, or learned men, or the people
be to pass this sentence upon the Prince, it is plain that it is an
Universal Doctrine amongst them that after this sentence (whosesoever it be)
it is then without Question lawful to kill him, and the most that ever they
say is, that it is indeed not lawful to kill a King, not lawful for a private
man, of his own head, without the public sentence of his Judge, but when this
Judge (whom they affirm to be the Pope) has passed his sentence, then they
doubt not of its being lawful. That I say true I appeal to Tom. 3. disp. 5.

All these and many more that I have seen teach the lawfulness of killing
Kings after public sentence, and then to beautify the matter profess that
they deny the lawfulness of Regicidium, by a private authority. For if the
Pope sentence him then he is no longer a King, and so the killing of him is not
Regicidium, and if any man does kill him after such sentence, then he kills him
not privata Authoritate, or sine judicio publico, which is all they affirm to
be unlawful.

And thus they hope to stop the clamor of the world against them, yet to have
their opinions stand entire, the way to their own ends fair, but the Prince no
jot the more secure of his life. I do them no wrong, I appeal to the Authors
themselves, there. I will be tried. For that either the People, or that a
Company of learned men, or to be sure the Pope may license a man to kill the
King, they speak it with one voice, and tongue. And now after all this we may
better guess what manner of counsel or threatening (for I know not which to
call it) that In lib. sub nomine Torti. edit. Colon. Agrip. 1610. page 21.
was which Bellarmine gave sometimes to K. James of B. M. Si securus regnare
velit Rex, si vitae sitae and suorum consulere cupiat, sinat Catholicos frist
religione sua! If this be good counsel, then in case the Catholics were
hindered from the free profession of their Religion, at the best it was full of
danger if not certain ruin. But I will no more rake this Augaean Stable, in
my first Part I showed it was too Catholic a Doctrine, and too much practiced
by the great Cisalpine Prelate. I add no more, least truth it self should
blush, fearing to become incredible.

Now if we put all these things together, and then we should prove to be
Heretics in their account, we are in a fair case both Prince and people, if
we can but guess rightly at this we shall need I think to look no further
why fire was called for to consume both our King and Country, nor why we may
fear it another time.

The Author of the Epistle of comfort to the Catholics in prison printed by
authority in the year of the Powder Treason, is very earnest to persuade his
Catholics not to come to our Churches or communicate with us in any part of
our divine service, affrighting them with the strange terriculamenta of half
Christians, Hypocrites, Denyers of Christ, in case they joined with us in our
Liturgy. Strange affrightments these yet not much more then what is (...) 36
Can. Apost 33. Laodic. (...).
true if they esteem us Heretics. For if they think us so, we are so to
them, and they communicating with us do as much sin, as if we were so
indeed.

But if we be not Heretics what need all this stir permissu Superiorum. the
Counsel of Recusancy was unreasonable, dangerous, schismatic, and as the
case then stood, very imprudent. In charity to their discretion we cannot but
think them uncharitable in their opinion of us.

But there is no need we should dispute our selves into a conjecture,
themselves speak out and plain enough. Hear Bellarmine under the visor of
Tortus, affirming that the Kings Edict commanded the Catholics Apol ad ^^
Angl.
to go to Heretics Churches, speaking of ours But more plain is that of
Champ the Sorbonist Cap. 11. page 149 Doway. 1616.
in his Treatise of Vocation of Bishops. Therefore as Arrianisme is a condemned
Heresy, and the Professors thereof be Heretics, so likewiseis Protestantisme
a condemned Heresy, and those that Profess it be also Heretics.

By this time we see too plainly that the state of Protestant Princes is full
of danger where these men have to do. They may be deposed and expelled from
the Government of their Kingdoms, they must be deposed by the Catholics
under peril of their souls, it may be done any way that is most convenient,
they may be rebelled against, fought with, slain. For all this, it weresome
ease, if here we might fix a Nonultra. For perhaps these Princes might put in
a Plea for themselves, and go near to prove themselves to be no Heretics.
All Is one, for though they do, yet unless they can persuade his Holiness not
to judge them so, or declare them Heretics, all is to no purprse, for to him
they must stand or fall. Nam iudicare an Rex pertrahat ad haeresim necne
pertinet ad Pontificem. So Bellarmine They need not stay till his Heresy be of
it self manifest, he is then to be used like a Heretic when by the Pope of
Rome he shall be judged Heretical.

But what matter is it if the Pope be judge, for if they may be deposed, as
good he as any else. What greivance then, can this be to the state of Princes
more then the former? Yes, very much. 1. Because the Pope by his order to
spiritualls may take away Kingdoms upon more pretenses then actual heresy. It
is a large title, and may do any thing. Bellarmine expresses it handsomely,
and it is the doctrine Vbi supra.
of their great Aquinas. The Pope (says he) by De regim, Princip.
his Spiritual power may dispose of the Temporalties of all the Christians in
the World, when it is requisite to the end of the Spiritual power. The words
are plain that he may do it for his own ends (for his is the Spiritual power)
that is, for the advancement of the Sea Apostolic, and thus (to be sure) he
did actually wish Frederick Barbarossa, John of Navarre, the Earl of Toulouse,
and our own King John. 2. The Pope pretends to a power that to avoid the
probable danger of the increase of heresy he may take away a Territory from the
right owner, as is reported by the Cardinal D'Ossat, and this is soon
pretended, for who is there that cannot make probabilities, especially when a
Kingdom is at stake? 3. We find examples that the Pope has excommunicate
Princes, and declared them heretics when all the heresy has been a not laying
their crowns at the feet of S. Peter. The case of Lewis the fourth is every
where known, whom John the twenty third Excommunicated. Platina tells the
reason. He called himself In Clement. quinto.
Emperor without the Popes leave, and aided the Italian deputies to recover
Millaine. Doubtless a most damnable and fundamental heresy. 4. How if it
proves in the Popes account to be a heresy to defend the immediate right of
Princes to their Kingdoms, dependant only on God, not on the Sea Apostolic.
If this be no heresy, nor like heresy to say it, I would feign learn the
meaning of Baronius concerning the book of Johannes de Roa, who sometimes had
been a Jesuit, but then changed his order, and became Augustinian, saying, it
was sentenced to the Baron, tom. 6. Annal. An. Dom 447. n 8
fire before it had escaped the press. And good reason, Nihil enim tale a
Patribus societatis didicit. Good men, they never taught him any such doctrine
as is contained in that pestilent book, de iuribus principalibus defendendis
and moderandis just. Now if this be heresy or like it, to preach such a
Doctrine, then likely it will be judged heresy in Princes to do so, that is,
to hold their crowns without acknowledgment of subordination to S. Peter's
chair. And if it be not heresy to do so, it is in their account as bad, for
so the Jesuits in their Veritas defensa against the Action of Arnald the
Advocate affirm in terminis, that the actions of some Kings of France against
the Pope in defense of their Regalties, were but examples of rebellion, and
spots to disgrace the purity of the French Lillies. 5. Put case the Pope should
chance to mistake in his sentence against a Prince, for the cause of heresy,
yet for all this mistake, he can secure any man to take away the Princes life
or Kingdom. His Lawyers will be his security for this point. For although in
this case, the deposition of the Prince should be, and be acknowledged to be
against Gods law, the Prince being neither Tyrant nor heretic, yet his
Holiness commanding it, takes away the unlawfulness of it, by his
dispensation. So D. Marta, and for this doctrine he quotes Hostiensis, Felinus,
Gratus, the Abbat, the De Iurisd cas. 64. n. 14.
Arch bishop of Florence, Ancharanus, Johannes Andreas, Laurentius de Pinu, and
some others. Indeed his Divines deny this, sed contrarium tamen observatur, as
it is very well observed by the same Doctor, Number. 17.
for he brings the practice and example of Pope Martin the fifth, Julius the
second, Celestine the third, Alexander the third, and Sixtus quintus, all which
dispensed in cases acknowledged to be expressly against Gods law. 6. Lastly.
How if the Pope should lay a claim to all the Kingdoms of the world, as
belonging to S. Peter's patrimony by right of spiritual pre-eminence? I know no
great security we have to the contrary. For first, It is known he has claimed
the Kingdom of England, as feudatary to the Sea Apostolic. Which when I
considered I wondered Rex Angloru^ est subditus Romano Pontisici ratione directi
domini^ quod in Regnum Angliae and Hiberniae Romana habet Ecclesia. Bellarm.
Apol. adv. R. Angl. c. 3.
not at that new and insolent title which Mosconius gives his Holiness of
Desensor fidei. He might have added the title of Rex Catholicus, and
Christianissimus. For D. Marta in his treatise of Jurisdiction, which he
dedicated to Paulus quintus, has that for an argument why he dedicated his
Book to him, because for sooth the Pope is the only Monarch of the World. But
of greater authority is that of Thomas Aquinas affirming, the Pope to be the
vertical top of all power Ecclesiastical b De May, milit. Eccles. c. 1.
page 25.

Rex, omnium Principum superior, rerumque and personarum supremus and Dominus.

and Civil. So that now it may be true which the Bishop of Patara told the
Emperor, in behalse of Pope Sylverius. Multos esse Reges, sed nullum talem,

Mundi totius.

For these reasons I think it is true enough that the constituting the Pope the
judge of Princes in the matter of deposition, is of more danger then the thing
it self. The sum is this. However schism or heresy may be pretended, yet it
is but during the Popes pleasure that Kings or subjects shall remain firm in
their mutual necessitude. For if our Prince be but excommunicate or declared
heretic, then to be a good subject will be accounted no better then irreligion
and Anti-Catholicisme. If the conclusion be too hard and intolerable then so
are the Premises, and yet they pass for good Catholic doctrine among
themselves.

But if truly and ex animo they are otherwise affected, they should do well to
unsay what has been said, and declare themselves by public authority against
such doctrines. And say whether or no their determinations shall be de fide? If
they be, then all those famous Catholic Doctors, Thomas Aquinas, Bellarmine,
Creswell, Mariana, Emanuel Sa, etc. are heretics, and their Canons teach
heresy, and Many of their Popes to be condemned as heretical, for practicing
and teaching deposition of Princes by an authority usurped against, and in
prejudice of the Christian faith. But if their answers be not de fide, then
they had as good say nothing, for the danger is not at all decreased, because
if there be Doctors on both sides by their own Charity maintaind by Cath. cap.
7.
assertion they may without sin follow either, but yet more safely if they
follow the most received and the most authorized, and whether this rule will
lead them, I will be judged by any man that has considered the premises.
Briefly either this thing must remain in the same state it is, and our Princes
still exposed to so extreme hazards, or else let his Holiness seat himself in
his chair, condemn these doctrines, vow against their future practice, limit
his or do ad spiritualia, contain himself within the limits of causes
directly and merely Ecclesiastical, disclaim all power, so much as indirect
over Princes temporalls, and all this with an intent to oblige all
Christendom. Which when I see done, I shall be most ready to believe that
nothing in Popery, does either directly or by a necessary consequence destroy
Loyalty to our lawful Prince, but not till then, having so much evidence to
the contrary.

Thus much was occasioned by consideration of the cause of the Disciples Quaere
which was when they saw this, that their L. and M. for his difference in
Religion was turned forth of doors, which when they saw,

They said Lord]. It was well they asked at all, and would not too hastily act
what they too sudde^ly had intended, but it was better that they asked Christ,
it had been the best warrant they could have had, could they have obtained but
a Magister dixit. But this was not likely, it was too strange a Question to
ask of such a Mr. A Magistro mansuetudinis licentiam crudelitat is? Nothing
could have come more cross to his disposition. His spirit never was addicted
to blood, unless it were to shed his own. He was a Prince of peace and set
forth to us by all the Symboles of peace and gentleness, as of a sheep, a
lamb, a hen, a gentle twining vine, the healing Olive. and is it likely that
such a oneshould give his placet to the utter ruin of a company of poor
Villagers for denying him a nights lodging moved thereto by the foregoing
scandal of a Schism? He knew better what it cost to redeem aman, and to save
his life from destruction then to be so hasty for his ruin. And if the
Fathers Confessors who were to answer the Question of the day had but
reflected upon this Gospel, they might have informed their penitents better
then to have engaged them upon such Antichristian, and Treasonable practices,
as to destroy an assembly of Christians, as to depose or kill a King.

It is the proper cognizance of Mahumetanisme, by fire and sword to maintain
their cause, and to propagate their Religion, by ruin of Princes and
conquering their Kingdoms. But it is the excellency of Christianity, that by
humility and obedience it made Princes tributary to our Dear Master, and
homagers to his Kingdom. When Valentinian sent Calligonus his Chamberlain to
S. Ambrose to threaten him from his faith, his answer was, Deus permittit tibi
ut impleas quod minaris. Ego patiar, quod est Episcopi, tu facies quod est
spadonis. He did not stir up the numerous people of his Diocese to rebel
against the Emperor, or depose him, employed no agent in his Court to
undermine his security, nor assasine to take his life. He and the rest of those
good Fathers, would not have lost their possibility of being Martyrs, for the
world, unless it were by persuading the Emperors to the Christian faith. We
pray for all our Governors, that they might have long life, a secure
government, a safe house, strong armies, good subjects, quiet world. So
Tertullian. Apologet.


I had thought that the Doctrine and example of our B. Savior, the practice
Apostolical and primitive, had been ties enough to keep us in our obedience
to God and the King, and in Christian charity to all, but I find that all
these precepts come to nothing, for the Apostles and primitive Christians did
not actually depose Kings, nor alter states, nor call for fire to consume their
enemies: not because it was simply unlawful so to do, or any way adverse to
the precepts of Christ, but because they wanted Power. So Bellarmine: The
Church gave De Pontif. R. l. 5. c. 7.
leave that the faithful should obey Julian, because then they wanted forces.
And F. Creswell is very confident of the business, They might without all
Question have appointed to themselves other Kings and Princes, if Philopater P.
107. n. 158.
the Christians had been strong enough to bring their intendments to pass.
But because they could not, therefore it was not lawful for them to go about
it, nor is it for us in the same case, especially if the Prince has quiet
possession, and a strong guard about him, then by no means is it lawful for a
single man by Disp. 5. in c. 13. ad Roman.
his own authority to assault his Prince that rules Tyrannically. So Salmeron.
But who sees not that this way murder may be lawful. For true it is God
commanded us, saying, Thou shall not kill, that is, if thou art not able to
lift up thy hand, or strike a stroke; thou shall not blaspheme, that is, if
thou be speechless, thou must be obedient to thy Prince, that is, if thou
can not tell how to help it. Good Doctrine this! And indeed it might
possibly be something if God had commanded our subordination to Princes only
for wrath, for then sivires adsint, if we can defend our selves we are secure,
we need not fear his wrath, but when he adds, also for conscience sake, I
cannot sufficiently wonder that any man should obtrude so senseless, so
illiterate, and so impious an interpretation upon the Christian world, under
the Title of Catholic Doctrine.

Christ when he was betrayed and seized upon by his Murderers could have
commanded twelve Legions of Angels for his Guard, Non defuerunt vires; and in
all humane likelihood such a Satellitium as that would have moved them to a
belief in him, or else I am sure, might have destroyed the unbelievers. Shall
I say more against this rude glossema? Then thus. It is false that the
Primitive Christians had not power to defend themselves against their
Persecutors. Hear S. Cyprian; Nemo nostrum quando apprehenditur reluctatur,
nec se adversus iniustitiam, and violentiam vestram quamvis nimius and copiosus
noster sit Populus, ulciscitur. They could have resisted and that to blood, but
they had not so learned Christ. Prayers and tears were the arms of
Christians, and then they had a defense beyond all this, when they were hard
put to it, Mori potuerunt, a submission of their bodies to Martyrdom was their
last refuge.

Thus S. Agnes, Lucia, Agatha, Christina, Domitilla saved both their faith and
chastity, non armis, sed ignibus and carnificis manu, the tormentors last
cruelty defended them from all succeeding danger.

I will not yet conclude, that, that which these men obtrude for Catholic
Doctrine is flat and direct heresy, I will instance but once more and then I
shall. In the fourth Council of Toledo which was assembled when the usurping
and Tyrannizing Goths did domineere in Europe, the most where of were Tyrants,
Usurpers, or Arrians; the Council decreed that if any man did violate the life
or person of his King, aut potestate Regni exuerit, kill him or depose him,
Anathema sit etc. He should be accursed in the sight of God and his Holy
Angels, and together withal the companions of his iniquity, he should be
separated from the Catholic Church. And now I hope I may say that these men
who either practice or advise such practices as killing or deposing Kings, are
as formally condemned for heresy, and anathematized, as ever was Manichee or
Cataphrygian. I know not, but perhaps this might be thought of when the Jesuits
were inscribed heretics upon the public pillar before the Louure in Paris,
upon their banishment: however, let them answer it as they may, it concerns
them as much as their being Catholics comes to, Et considerent, quia quae
praedicant tantopere verba, aut ipsorum summorum Pontificum sunt suas fimbrias
extendentium, aut illorum qui eis adulantur, as said Aeneas Sylvius, but at De
gestis council. Basil. lib. 1.
no hand can it be Christian Doctrine.

I instanced in these things to show the Antithesis between the spirit of our
B. Savior who answered the Question of the text, and the Fathers Confessors of
whom was asked the Question of the day.

But give me leave to consider them not only as mis-informing their penitents,
but as concealing their intended purpose, for even this way, the persons to
whom the Question was propounded made Cap. quantae de senten. excom. and. c.
delicto ibid. in 6. 13. q. 3. q. 3.
themselves guilty of the intended machination. For by all Law Ecclesiastical
and Civil he that conceales an intended Murder or Treason makes himself l.
1. occisorum ad I. c. Syllanian. and l 1.. 1. ad l. Cornel. de falsis l.
quisquis ad l lul. May.
as much a party for concealing, as is the Principal for contriving.

Ob. But these Fathers Confessors could not be accused by virtue of these
general Laws, as being exempt by virtue of special case, for they received
notice of these things only in confession, the seal of which is so sacred and
inviolable, that he is sacrilegious who in any case does break it open, though
it be to avoid the greatest evil that can happen, so Bellarmine; to save the
lives of all the Kings in Christendom, Apol. adv. R. Angl. Casaub. ad Front.
Duc. In 3. part. D. Thom. disp. 33. Sect. 1. n. 2.
so Binet; though to save a whole common wealth from damage temporal or
spiritual, of body or soul, so Suarez.

A considerable matter! On the one side we are threatened by sacrilege, on the
other by danger of Princes and commonwealths, for the case may happen, that
either the Prince and whole State may be suffered to perish bodily and ghostly,
or else the Priest must certainly damn himself by the sacrilegious breach of
the holy Seal of confession. Give me leave briefly to consider it, and, both
for the acquittance of our state in its proceedings against these Traitors, and
for the regulating of the case it self, to say these two things.

1 This present Treason was not revealed to these Fathers Confessors in formal
confession. 2. If it had, it did not bind to secresy in the present case. Of
the first, only a word.

1 It was only propounded to them in way of Question or consultation (like this
in the text) as appeared Vide Casaub. ep. ad Front. D. p. 133.
by their own confessions, and the attestation of then Sr Henry Mountague
Recorder of London to Garnet himself. It could not therefore be a formal D.
Soto. in. 4. l. Sent. d. 18. q. 4 art. 5. concl. 5. Navar. c. 8. n. 18. Suarez.
disp. 33 Sect 2. Coninck des^gil conf. dub. 1. n. 7.
confession, and therefore not bind to the seal. It is the common opinion of
their own Doctors: Non enim inducitur obligatio sigilli in confessione quam
quis facit sine ullo animo accipiendi absolutionem, sed solum consilij petendi
causa.

2 It was propounded to these Fathers Confessors as a thing not subjicible to
their penitential, judicature, because it was a fact not repented of, but then
in agitation, and resolved upon for the future. How then could this be a
confession, whose institution must certainly be in order to absolution, and how
could this be in any such order; when it was a business of which they could
not expect to be absolved unless they hoped to sin with a pardon about their
necks; and on condition God would be merciful to them in its remission, would
come and profess that they were resolved to anger him? In reason this could be
no act of repentance, neither could it, by confession of their own side. It is
the doctrine of Hostiensis: and Cap Sacerdos. 3. q. n. 116.
Navarre, and In lucubrat: ad Bartolum. in L. ut vim. n. 22 ff. de iustitia and
iure
Cardinal Alban confess it to be most commonly received.

3 It was not only not repented of, but by them reputed to be a good action,
and so could not be a matter of confession. I appeal to any of their own
Manuals and penitentiary books. It is culpable say they. I am sure it is
ridiculous in any man to confess and shrive himself of a good action, and
that this was such in their opinion, it is plain, by that impious answer of
Garnet, affirming it a business See proceed. against late Traitors.
greatly meritorious, if any good might thence accrue to the Catholic cause.

4 By this their pretended confession they endeavored to acquire new
accomplices, as is evident in the proceedings against the Traitors. They were
therefore bound to reveal it, for it neither was nor could be a proper and
formal confession. That this is the common opinion of their own Schools, see
it affirmed by Aegidius Coninck. Vbisupra.


The first particular then is plain. Here neither was the form of confession,
nor yet could this thing be a matter of confession, therefore supposing the
seal of confession to be sacredly inviolable in all cases, yet they were
highly blameable for their concealment in the present.

2 But the truth of the second particular is more to be inquired of. That is,
that though these things had been only revealed in confession, and this
confession had been formal and direct, yet they were bound in the present case
to reveal it, because the seal of confession is not so inviolable, as that in
no case it is to be broken up, and if in any, especially it may be opened in
the case of treason.

I never knew any thing cried up with so general a voice upon so little
ground, as is the Over-hallowed seal of confession.

True it is that an ordinary secret committed to a friend in civil commerce is
not to be revealed upon every cause, nor upon many, (but upon some it may as
they all confess.) If thus, then much rather is this to be observed in the
revelation of the secrets of our consciences, not only from the ordinary tie to
secrecy, but likewise least sins should grow more frequent, if so great a
remedy of them be made so odious, as to expose us to a public infamy or danger
of the law. The Council therefore that first introduced this obligation was
very prudent and reasonable, pleads a thousand years prescription, and relies
upon good conveniences. This is all that ever could be proved of it (as may
appear anon) but these are too weak a base, to build so great a structure on
it, as to make it sacrilege, or any sin at all, to reveal confessions in
some cases.

1 For first, if because it is delivered as a secret, and such a secret, it is
the more closely and religiously to be kept; it is true, but concludes no more,
but that it must be a greater cause that must authorize a publication of this,
then of the secrets of ordinary commerce between friend and friend.

2 If the licensing of publicatio^ of confession be a way to make confession
odious, and therefore that it may not be published, I say if this concludes,
then on the contrary it concludes far more strongly, that therefore in some
cases it may be published, because nothing can make a thing more odious and
intolerable, then if it be made a cover for grand impieties, so as to engage a
true subject, quietly and Knowingly to see his Prince murdered.

3 If it be discouragement to the practice of confession that some sins
revealed in it must be published though with peril to the delinquents fame and
life, then it will be a far greater discouragement to the sin, when that it
shall by an universal judgment be so detested, that its concealment may not
be permitted, though it be with the hazard of discouraging the Holy duty of
confession: and when the being guilty of such a sin, shall reduce men into
such streights, that either they shall want the benefit of absolution, or
submit themselves to a public satisfaction, and so even in this particular the
benefit is far greater then the imaginary inconvenience.

The conveniences of the Seal force no more then that it is convenient to be
observed, not simply and absolutely in all cases necessary. And perhaps Suarez
the great patron of it perceived it, however he lays the burden, super communi
consensu Ecclesiae, In 3. Part. D. Thom. disp. 33. sect. 1. n. 2
eiusque perpetua traditione. If then I can show, that there is no such
Catholic consent of the present Church, nor any universal tradition of the
ancient Church for the inviolable Seal, but plainly the contrary, then our
Church in her permission of the Priests to reveal some confessions is as
inculpable as those of the present Church, who (besides her self) teach and
practice it, and as the Primitive Church whose, example in this (as in other
things) she strictly follows.

Of the first. The Church of England, which observes the seal of confession as
sacredly as reason or religion it self can possibly permit, yet forbids not
disclosure in case of Murder or Treason, but in these particulars leaves us
entire in our obedience to Can. 113. A. D. 1604.
the common laws of England, and these command it.

That the Church of England gives leave in some cases to reveal confessions,
is argument enough to prove that the Seal is not founded upon the consent of
the present Catholic Church. For it is no more a begging of the Question (nor
apparently so much) to say, the Church of England is a part of the Catholic
Church, and therefore her consent is required to make a thing universal, then
to say, the Church of Rome is the whole Catholic Church, therefore her consent
is sufficient to make a thing Catholic. But I shall not need to proceed this
way. For,

1 It is apparent that of their own side Altisidiorensis largely and
professedly proves the iawfulnesse of publication in some cases as is to be
seen. Lib. 4. Summae tract. 6. cap. 3. q. 7. and Garnet himself, the man who
if any had most need to stand in defense of the Seal that the pretense of it
might have defended him, yet confessed of his own accord, Leges quae celare
haec prohibent apprime esse justas and salutares. He Actio in prodit. lat. p.
99.
adds his reason, and that is more then his authority, for (says he) it is
not fitting that the life and safety of a Prince should depend upon the private
niceties of any man's conscience. If two, nay if one dissent, it is enough to
destroy a consent. But see farther.

There are many cases, generally confessed amongst themselves, in which the
seal of formal and (as they love to speak) Sacramental confession may be
broken open. I instance but in two or three.

First, confession may be revealed to clear a doubtful case of marriage. It is
the opinion of many great Practic. crim. Ecclesiast. cap. 109.
Canonists, as you may see them quoted by Suarez de Paz. and Covaruvias, and
the case of the Venetian Resol. de Matrimon*
who married a Virgin that was both his sister and daughter: and that at Rome
under Pope Paul the third almost to like purpose, were long disputed on both
sides, whether they were to be revealed or not, so that at most, it is but a
doubtful matter in such cases, whether the tie of secrecy does oblige. Now if
for the proof of marriage the seal may be broken up, that man and wife might
live contentedly and as they ought, strange it should be unlawful to reveal
confessions in case of Treason, for the safety of a Prince or State!

2 In case of heresy the seal binds not, by their own general confession. It
is a rule amongst them,

Haeresis est crimen quod non confessio celat.

Now I would fain learn why Treason is not as revealeable as Heresy? Is heresy
dangerous to souls? Then surely, so is Treason, unless it be none, or a very
small crime. May heresy infect others? So may Treason, as it did in the
present. It may then as well be revealed as heresy. Now that it may something
rather, I have these reasons. 1. Because it is not so certain that such an
opinion is heresy as that such a fact is Treason. 2. Because although both
Treason and real heresy be damnable and dangerous to souls, yet heresy killes
no Kings as treason does. I confess that heresy may, and does teach it, but
then it degenerates into Treason. Now if some heresy may be Treason, then that
Treason is heresy, and so a case of Treason may occur, in which from their
own confession, treason is revealeable.

3 By the most general voice of their own side any man may license his
confessor to reveal his confession. It is the doctrine of Scotus, Durandus,
Almain, Navarre, Medina, and generally of all the Thomists. I infer, if a
private man may license his Confessor to reveal his confession, then the seal
of confession is not founded upon any divine commandment, for if it were, the
penitent could not give the Priest license to break it. But if the penitent may
give his Confessor leave, because the tie of secrecy is a bond in which the
Priest stands bound to the penitent, and he giving him leave, remits of his own
right, then much rather may a whole State authorize this publication, for what
ever personal right a private man has, that the whole State has much rather,
L. quod Mayor ff. ad Municipalem.
for he is included in it as a part of the whole, and in such cases as concern
the whole commonwealth (as this of treason does most especially) the rule of
the Law holds without exception, Refertur ad universos quod public fit per
maiorem partem, the delinquent ff. de regut juris. ad. refertur. L. 7. ult. ff.
de pact.
gives leave to the publication of confession, therefore because the whole
state does, whereof he is one member. I add, that in the case of Treason this
is much rather true, for here the delinquent loses all his right whatsoever,
praediall, personal, and of privilege, and therefore the Commonwealth can the
better license the publication, and the breach of the bond of secrecy, in which
the Confessor stood tied to the penitent by virtue of implicit stipulation.

4 Lastly, even in special in the very case of Treason confessed, many of
their own do actually practice a publication, when either they are loyal of
themselves, or dare not be otherwise.

In instance first in the Church of France. For this See Bodinus, who reports
of a Norman Gentleman whom his Confessor discovered for having confessed De
republ. lib. 2. cap. 5.
a Treasonable purpose he sometimes had, of killing Francis the first, of which
he was penitent, did his penance, craved absolutio^ obtained it but yet was
sentenced to the axe by express commission from the Histoire de lapaiz.
King to the Parliament of Paris. The like confession was made by the Lord of
Haulteville when he was in danger of death, which when he had escaped, he
incurred it with the disadvantage of public infamy upon the Scaffold. I
instance not in the case of Barriere, it is every where known as it is
reported partly by Thuanus, but more fully by the Author of Histoire de la
paix. Nor yet is France singular in the practice of publication of confessed
Treason. For at Rome there have been examples of the like, I mean of those who
confessed their purpose of killing the Dominic. a Soto. memb. 3. q 4. concl. 2
derat. regendi secret.
Pope, who were revealed by their Confessors, and accordingly punished.

Thus then the first pretense proves a nullity, and either our Laws are just in
commanding publication of confession in case of Treason, or themselves very
culpable in teaching and practicing it in the same, and in cases of less
moment. The 2d is like the first for it is extremly vain to pretend that the
seal of confession is founded upon Catholic tradition. Judge by the sequel.

The first word I hear of concealing confessions Lib 7. hist. c. 16.
is in Sozomen, relating how the Greek Church about the time of Decius the
Emperor, set over the penite^ts (...).
a public penitentiary Priest, who was bound to be Vir bonae conversationis,
servansque secretum, a good man and a keeper of secrets, for indeed he was
bound to conceal some crimes, in particular those which an Adulteress had
confessed, I mean concerning her Adultery, as appears in the Canons of S.
Basil. But yet this Priest who was so tied to a religious secrecy did publish
many of them in the Congregation Epist. ad Amphil.
before the people, that they might reprove the delinquent and discountenance
the sin. The same story is reported by Cassiodore, and Nicephorus from the
same Author.

The lawfulness and practice of publication in some cases is as clear in
Origin. If (says he) the Physician Homil. 2. in 37. Psalm.
of thy soul perceives thy sins to be such as to need so harsh a remedy as
to have them published before the assemblies of the people, that others may be
admonished, and thou the better cured, he need be very deliberate, and skillful
in the application of it. Hitherto no such thing as an Universal tradition for
the pretended inviolable sacramental seal, for Origin plainly, and by them
confessedly speaks of such sins as first were privately confessed to the
Priest; how else should he deliberate of their publication? but yet he did so,
and for all the seal of confession, sometimes opened many of them, to no fewer
witnesses then a whole assembly. Thus it was in the Greek Church both Law and
Custom. But now if we look into the Latin Church we shall find that it was
taken up from example of the Greeks and some while practiced, that some
particular sins should be published in the Church before the Congregation, as
it is confessed in the Council of Mentz, and Cap. 10. and 21. l. 19. c. 37.
inserted by Burchard into his Decree.

But when the Lay piety began to cool, and the zeal of some Clergy men wax
too hot, they would needs heighten this custom of publication of some sins
to a Law of the publishing of all sins. This being judged to be inconvenient,
expressed the first decree for the seal of confession in the Latin Church. Now
see how it is uttered, and it will sufficiently inform us both of the practice
and the opinion which Antiquity had of the obligation to the seal.

Illam contra Apostolicam regulam praesumptionem, etc. that is, it was against
the Apostolical ordinance that a Law should enjoin that the Priest should
reveal Decret S. Leonis. P. M. Epist. 80. ad episc. Campan.
all those sins which had been told him in confession. It might be done so
it were not required and exacted, and yet might be so required, so it were not
a publication of all. Non enim omnium hujusmodi sunt peceata; says S. Leo,
some sins are inconvenient to be published, it is not fit the world should
know all, therefore, some they might, or else he had said nothing. The reason
which he gives makes the business somewhat clearer, for he derives it not
from any simple necessity of the thing or a Divine Right, but least men out of
inordinate love to themselves, should rather refuse to be washed then buy their
purity with so much shame. The whole Epistle has many things in it excellently
to the same purpose.

I say no more, the Doctrine and practice of antiquity is sufficiently evident,
and that there is nothing less then an Universal tradition for the seal of
confession to be observed in all cases, even of sins of the highest malignity.

Thus these Fathers Confessors are made totally inexcusable by concealing a
Treason which was not revealed to them in a formal confession, and had been
likewise culpable though it had, there being as I have shown, no such
sacredness of the Seal as to be inviolable in all cases whatsoever.

I have now done with the several considerations of the persons to whom the
Question was propounded, they were the Fathers Confessors in the day, but it
was Christ the Lord in my text. The Question it self follows.

Shall we command fire to come from heaven and consume them?

The Question was concerning the fate of a whole Town of Samaria, in our case
it was more; of the Fate of a whole Kingdom. It had been well if such a
Question had been silenced by a direct negative or (as the Judges of the
Areopage used to do) put off ad diem longissimum, that they might have
expected the answer three ages after.

De morte hominis nulla est cunctatio longa, No demurre had been too long in a
case of so much and so royal blood, the blood of a King, of a Kings Children,
of a Kings Kingdom. (...), King and Kingdom should have and been made a
solemn sacrifice to appease theirsolemndeliberate malice. I said deliberate,
for they were loath to be malicious without good advice, and therefore they asked
their question, worthy of an Oracle, even no less then Delphick, where an
evil spirit was the Numen, and a Witch the Prophet. For the Question was such
of which a Christian could not doubt though he had been fearfully scrupulous
in his resolutions. For whoever questioned the unlawfulness of murder, of
murdering innocents, of murdering them who were confessed righteous? for such
was their proposal, being rather willing that Catholics should perish with
those whom they thought, heretics, then that their should be no blood spilt.
But to the question: it was fire they called for. The most merciless of all
the Elements. No possibility of relenting when once kindled and had its object.
It was the fittest instrument for merciless men, men of no bowels whose malice
like their instrument did agere ad extremum suarnm virium, work to the highest
of its possibility. Secondly, It was fire indeed they called for, but not like
that in my text, not fire from heaven, They might have called as long and as
loud as those Priests did, who contested with Elisha, no fire would have come
from heaven to have consumed what they had intended for a sacrifice. Gods
Anathema's post not so fast as ours do. Deus non est sicut homo. Man curses
often when God blesses, men condemn whom God acquits, and therefore they were
loath to trust God with their cause, they therefore take it into their own
hands. And certainly if to their Anathemas they add some fagots of their own
and gunpowder, it is odds but then we may be consumed indeed, and so did they,
their fire was not from heaven.

Lastly, it was a fire so strange, that it had no example. The Apostles indeed
pleaded a mistaken precedent for the reasonableness of their demand, they
desired leave to do but even as Elias did. [The Greeks only retain this
clause, it is not in the Bibles of the Church of Rome] and really these
Romano-barbari could never pretend to any precedent for an act so barbarous as
theirs. Adrimelech indeed killed a King, but he spared the people, Haman would
have killed the people, but spared the King, but that both King and people,
Princes and Judges, branch, and rush and root should dye at once (as if
Caligula's were actuated and all England upon one head) was never known till
now, that all the malice in the world met in this as in a center. The Sicilian
evensong, the mattins of S. Bartholomew, known for the pitiless and damned
massacres, were but (...), the dream of the shadow of smoke if compared with
this great fire. In tam occupato saeculo fabulas Vulgaris nequitia non invenit.
This was a busy age; Herostratus must have invented a more sublimed malice then
the burning of one Temple, or not have been so much as spoke of since the
discovery of the Powder Treason. But I must make more have I shall not else
clime the sublimity of this impiety. Nero was sometimes the populare ^dium was
popularly hated, and deserved it too, for he slew his Master, and his wife and
all his family once or twice over, opened his mothers womb, fired the City,
laughed at it, slandred the Christians for it, but yet all these were but
principia malorum, the very first rudiments of evil. Add then to these,
Herod's Masterpiece at Ramah as it was deciphred by the tears and sad threnes
of the Matrons in an Universal mourning for the loss of their pretty infants,
yet this of Herod will prove but an infant wickedness, and that of Nero, the
evil but of one city. I would willingly have found out an example, but I see
I cannot, should I put into the scale the extract of all the old Tyrants famous
in Antique stories,

Bristoni; stabulum Regis, Busiridis ar as,
Antiphatae mensas and Tauricaregna Thoantis,
Should I take for true story the highest cruelty as it was fancied by the most
hieroglyphicall Egyptian, this alone would weigh them down, as if the Alps
were put in scale against the dust of a balance. For had this accursed Treason
prosper'd, we should have had the whole Kingdom mourn for the inestimable
loss of its chiefest glory, its life, its present joy, and all its very hopes
for the future. For such was their destind malice, that they would not only
have inflicted so cruel a blow, but have made it incurable, by cutting off our
supplies of joy, the whole succession of the line Royal. Not only the Vine it
self but all the Gemmulae, and the tender O live branches should either have
been bent to their intentions, and made to grow crooked, or else been broken.

And now after such a sublimity of malice, I will not instance in the
sacrilegious ruin of the neighboring Temples which needs must have perished
in the flame, nor in the disturbing the ashes of our entombed Kings devouring
their dead ruins like Sepulchrall dogs, these are but minutes, in respect of
the ruin prepared for the living Temples.

Stragem sed istam non tulit
Christus cadentum Principum Prudent. hymn.

Impune, ne for sansui
Patris periret fabrica.
Ergo quae poterit lingua retexere
Lauds Christ tuas, qui domitum struis
Infidum populum cum Duce perfido?
Let us then return to God the cup of thanks giving, he having powered forth so
largely to us of the cup of salvation. We cannot want where withal to fill it,
here is matter enough for an eternal thankfulness, for the expressiou of
which a short life is too little, but let us here begin our Hallelujahs hoping
to finish them hereafter, where the many quires of Angels will fill the consort.

Praise the Lord ye house of Levi, ye that fear the Lord, Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord out of Sion, Psalm. 135. v. 20. 21.
which dwells at Jerusalem.

FINIS.
