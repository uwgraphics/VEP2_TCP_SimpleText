Honors may leave their Owners Riches may
Assume swift wings and quickly fly away
Pleasure like lightning but salutes our Eyes
With one bright Flash and then falls sick and dies
But Learning and the knowledge of rare Arts
That Man the most enjoyes that most imparts
Endeavor therefore that your Breast and Brain
The best of Learnings Treasures may retain
Humility is a voluntary inclination of the Mind grounded upon a perfect
Knowledge of our own Condition A virtue by which a Man in the most true
consideration of his inward Qualities makes least Account of Himself

This is my Body whether she thought that was Christ's body or no after a little

And what the Word did make it
That J believe and take it
