Balaams Reply to the Ass, OR THE Clergies Answer TO THE Countries Complaint.
[1]
To the Reverend Bishops.
YOu learned Prelates of the House of Peers!
That sit in Moses Chair, and bow your ears
To Widows just Complaints, and Orphans Tearal
[2]
Grave (Fathers of the Church) to you we come!
Begging for Justice! though they say we are dumb;
If we were so indeed twere well for some.
[3]
To you we send or our complaints alas,
None fitter then an Angel to appease.
The fray, betwixt poor Bala'm and his Ass?
[4]
And that your Lordships are concerned I Am sure;
Unless you can both scorn, and loss endure,
The livings are your own, our's but the cure!
[5]
Twill be no wonder to your learned Train,
That Issacar of Levy should complain!
The Asses spleen will in his mouth remain.
[6]
Nor will it I hope seem sttrange to any one,
That there is amongst us such division,
Proud Jack did evermore abuse poor John!
[7]
In vain it is for Bala'm to reply
Unto the Asses charge, when all men cry,
A switch and spurr's the heft Philosophy!
[8]
Yet in my heart I think no wise men do,
Think us false Prophets, for they all do know,
They are but Asses, that do count us so.
[9]
But oh we cannot hold, should we not speak,
And sigh aloud, our very hearts would break,
Twould vex a Moses were he nere so meek!
[10]
Say can it chose but greive our souls to see?
Simeon and Levy fight, both disagree?
And sorry boys, old Fathers villifie?
[11]
Did ever any since the cursed Ca^,
Turn up his fathers skirt, divulge his shame?
Yes, yes, mine own dear sons have done the same!
[12]
And as if God were deaf, and Conscience dumb,
Rebellion but a peccadillo, some
Like Nero have displayed their Mothers Womb.
[13]
Lord did thou send, the wild and Savage Bear,
To slay the unto'ward boys that sooffing were;
At the good Prophet for his want of hair?
[14]
How can thou stay thy hand, when men and all,
Do join together and us scoffing call,
Though not bald Priests by chance, yet Priests of Ba'al
[15]
And why on John what mean those names and words,
Or has the Church her Knights, as well as Lords?
Or, tell me are het Keys exchanged for Swords?
[16]
True not long since he lay dead in a sown,
Of civil Wars, the cross, and waining Moon,
Parted her Ensigns, and the was undone.
[17]
But that some gallane hearts that scornd the loss
Of life and goods, at heft but splended dross
Stayed for to help their Mother bear her Cross.
[18]
But why Sir John would not St. George have been
A better Epethite, but chiefly when
Griffins; and Dragons are so never a kin?
[19]
Or wa'st a greater piece of eminence,
To be a Mother, then a Maids defense,
Is love inferior to obedience?
[20]
Why the rude Vulgar folk do call us John,
And add a sir, I must profess I Am one
As must go seek a Revelation?
[21]
True, we have been as we do all confess,
A long time in the howling wilderness,
Save that we might not preach up righteousness!
[22]
Besides our Commons too were very small,
Like to the Baptist's, yet they differ all!
John fed on Honey, but we fed on Gall.
[23]
Yet we embrace the title, it is no shame
For to be Christn'd with the Baptists name,
May we be like him all a burning flame!
[24]
But ah this is not all that you do see,
A thousand harder names as yet here be
In the poor Persons Genealogy.
[25]
Dogs, Bears and Wolves, Tigers and such as they
That range the silent Woods live on the pray
Are Hieroglypicks fit for as they say.
[26]
And yet God know a our hearts, and and souls we could
Nor fight, nor fews, be infolent, nor prond,
Or flush our selves with quaffing humane blood!
[27]
But so the Tyrant Monarchs of the East,
Used in (their Triumphs, o^ the^ solemn (...),
To bias poor Christ^^^ in the skins of (...)
[28]
What it is we have done, truly we do not know,
To merit ill of them, did we weed go,
With bended knee to supplicate our Fo!
[29]
If we have took away from any one,
More then our Tent'hs, on this condition,
We are ready to make restitution!
[30]
If Altars, Tapers, be Idolatry,
Gowns, Cassack, Tippets, rags of Popery,
Shew'us good reason for it we will lay (...) by
[31]
But if the reading prayers be all our bl^^^
'Cause (...) and (...) maybe taught the same,
The Ass may then (...) from (...)
[32]
For is the (...) men does (...)
Of so much (...) that he (...)
To this, (...) ^ye may sooner speak the^ (...)
[33]
But oh we cannot pray our hearts are scant,
Strange that we cannot pray, and yet can cant
The poor Man never did expressions want
[34]
True, we cant hang the head, and look demure,
Talk fast, and loud like Monkeys in a Lure,
And then not question but to sin secure!
[35]
We do not love a long and tedious story,
Full of Perenthesis, pride and vain glory,
The Pater Noster's the best Directory!
[36]
We do profess that we are none of those,
That Circumflex their Sermonas with their Nose,
And mingle Hopkins Rimes, with Wisdowes Prose!
[37]
Yet would you but vouchsafe to view the prayers,
Of your good Mother sinoe these latter years,
Mixed with the incense of a Prelates Tears?
[38]
Would you but hearken to her groans, and cries,
Her sweet Patheticksand Apostrophies,
You Would say there was no richer Sacrafice!
[39]
The penitent Disciple I d^^^ sw^^^,
Never wept so much, when the pert (...),
Fastened his Fetters, and did him scure*
[40]
Even so the B^^^ tree, lovingly bestows
It Is Tears (...) that do ^^
Tears healing as the blood that from it flows!
[41]
But stay here ^^^ fright
Just like a Tailors Bill, a threadbare Knight,
They say we are (...), loose, profane, and ^ight!
[42]
I do not wish these Articles may be,
As false a charge, as manifest a ly,
As those were of a former Century!
[43]
For then the bribed Person that should go,
To prove the imputation to be so,
Would be the greater scandal of the two.
[44]
But yet I pray, that we may be no less
Religious in plenty then distress
In Canaan, then in the Wilderness*
[45]
But we are Drunkards, men will lie and swear,
Though we with modesty and tears declare,
True is our Doctrine, (...) our prayer!
[46]
Then us for Theives, and Robbers they do brand,
Though we profess we would upon no hand,
Purchase an (...) of the Churches Land!
[47]
But we are wanton, lustful, fond and fickle,
And in our Neighbors Corn do thrust our Sickle
When we God won all hate a Conventickle.
[48]
Lastly we are dark Lights, blind Guides by name,
Though if we were, say which deserves must blame,
A glimering Taper, or a wandering flame?
[49]
And yet the faults not ours, we had no doubt,
Remained till now, bright shining and devout,
Had not a Sequestration blew us out*
[50]
That Northern gust, that fatal Hurrican,
That rushed through all the quarters of the Land,
Rooted up Oaks, (...) the Mushroms stand!
[51]
Good Lord how prejudice and passion blea^s,
Our eyes; how self (...) by the ears,
Which way the wind blow, the Saylor steers!
[52]
If we say nothing then they spur^ and kick,
Call us dumb dogs, and throw us bones to pick,
The Ass will vapor when the ^yons sick!
[53]
When we resufe to see at least to mind,
Their gross abuses, then the Priest is blind,
Weeping perhaps to see them so unkind!
[54]
But if we justisie our holiness,
And prove by reason, what we do profess,
The wisdom of the world is foolishness!
[55]
At last when envy cannot find a hole,
To shroud her-self, down they sit and (...),
It Is a poor silly superctitious soul
[56]
These are the scoffs and Jears, the cruel hits,
That wicked heads invent in drunken fits,
To vex good men, and exercise their wits!
[57]
O wicked World, O monstrous Commonweal,
When men with great applause might kill and steal,
Censure was Saintship, Sacrilege was zeal!
[58]
When Churches (...) like stables, Altars bare,
Or Turned to Mangers, Priests and Organs were,
Both silenced, none might preach unless they would swane!
[59]
No Music in the Church but Widows cries,
No Sacraments but Oaths, no Rites but lies,
No Christian Burial, and no Sacrifice!
[60]
But thanks be to our gracious God, for why?
He heard our prayers, and harkn'd to our Cry,
And thereupon turned our captivity!
[61]
We'are all in peace, long may we so remain,
May the Grown flourish on our Sovereign,
And Aarons Rod blosom and bloom again!
[62]
May all the Kings and Churches Enemies
All their plots, projects, and conspiracies,
Be blown away like silly Gnats and Flies!
[63]
And (...)my Lord since we to you have cried,
And nothing that (...) you hide,
Pict your sorrows, pardon us beside^,
[64]
O Father (...) how can thou see,
The bondsman scoff at Isaac and not be,
In love to him offended presently?
[65]
Alas we don't sigh and complain because,
Our honor's lie at stake, but the good laws,
Your reputation, and the Churches cause.
[66]
It Is time, it is time my Lords, or to keep in
For your own safeties, or go armed when
The Lions couchant, in the Asses skin!
[67]
I Will say but this take it on a Levits word,
When once the Ass does of his own accord
Thus kick Sir John He Will quickly ^^ng my Lord.
FINIS.
