UPON TITUS:
To the Tune of, Hail to the Myrtle Shade.
ALL Hail to the Chief of the Post,
To Titus the Saint of the Town,
Titus who vainly does boast
Of a Salamanca Gown:
Titus, who saw the World round,
From his Tower at Valladolid,
From Mounsieur Le Chese the Seas over,
To the White Horse Tavern Deed.
Hail Titus at Watton in May,
And Titus at Islington,
Titus, the self same day
Both here and there again:
Titus, that never swore truth in the Court,
His Plot for to maintain;
Nor never could be positive for it,
When called to the Test again.
Then Titus was meekest of all,
When never a penny in's Purse,
He often upon Pickering did call,
His Charity to disburse.
But when he made false most damnable Oaths,
And lying no Sin,
Then Titus was one of those,
Whom the Devil had entered in.
Titus, the Frowns of Heaven,
And Titus a Plague upon Earth:
Titus never to be forgiven,
But cursed in his fatal Birth:
Titus the Scourge and bane of the Poor,
And Just Man too --
O Titus thou Son of a W --
What (a Plague!) do thou mean to do.
FINIS.
