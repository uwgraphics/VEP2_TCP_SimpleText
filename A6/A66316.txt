their respective Dwellings.

THeir Majesty's having received Information, That diverse Popish Recusants
holding Correspondence with, or Favoring Their Majesty's Enemies, do withdraw
from their Habitations, Designing and Endeavoring to Corrupt and Seduce Their
Majesty's Subjects, and them Excite to Sedition and Rebellion, at this time,
whilst Their Majesty's with most of the Princes of Christendom are Engaged in a
necessary War against the French King, for Their common Security, and the
particular Preservation of these Kingdoms, whereon the Interest and Safety of
all and singular Their Majesty's Subjects do depend; have thought fit (with the
Advice of Their Privy Council) to Issue this Their Royal Proclamation, and do
hereby strictly Charge and Command all Popish Recusants, being above the Age of
Sixteen years, born within any of Their Majesty's Realms or Dominions, or made
Denizens, That they and every of them do (according to the Statutes in that
behalf made) repair to their respective Places of Abode, and if they have no
Places of Abode, then to the Places where the Father or Mother of such
respective Person is, or shall be then dwelling, and do not thereafter Remove
or Pass above Five Miles from thence. And Their Majesty's do hereby further
straightly Charge and Command all Their Judges, Justices, Magistrates, Ministers
and Officers, That if such Popish Recusant, or Person reputed so to be, shall
not repair to his or her Place of Abode, and there continue without Removing or
Passing above Five Miles from thence, according to the true Intent and Tenor
of the Statutes in that behalf, That then such Popish Recusants, or Persons so
reputed respectively, be Prosecuted and brought to Punishment, as well by
Tendering unto them the Oaths mentioned in an Act of Parliament made in the
First Year of Their Majesty's Reign, Entitled [An Act for the Abrogating the

Execution the severest Laws which are now in Force against them.
