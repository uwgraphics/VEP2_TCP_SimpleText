some particular heads of Doctrine, which for more plainness sake were shortly
touched in the former Sum.

Heb. 6.1. Therefore leaving the Doctrine of the b^ginning of Christ. etc.

London, Printed for Geo. Badger. 1646.

THE Method of the Doctrine OF Christian Religion.
Question. WHat certain rule have we left us for our direction in the
knowledge of the true Religion whereby we must be saved?

Ephesians. 1.9. 2 Pet. 1.21. 2 Timothy 3.15, 16.
Ans. The holy Scriptures of the Old, and New Testament, which God delivered
unto us, by the Ministry of his servants the Prophets, and Apostles, to
inform us perfectly in all things that are needful for us to know in matters
of Religion.

What be the general heads of Religion, which in these holy writings are
delivered unto us?

Psalm. 103.8. 1 Chr. 29.11. Psalm. 145.3, 4, 11, 13. Mat. 6.13.
Ans. The knowledge of Gods nature and kingdom.

What are we to consider in Gods nature?

Ans. First, Col. 1.1^. Heb. 1.3. 1 John 5.
his Essence or being, which is but one, and then the persons which are three
in number.

What do you consider in Gods Essence or being?

Ans. His Perfection and Life.

How are we to conceive of God in regard of his Perfection?

Ans. That he is a Spirit most single and infinite, Ioh. 117, 8. 1 Timothy 6.16.
Psalm. 145.3. Rev. 1.8. Romans 11.36. Act^ 17.24.
having his being from himself, and having need of nothing which is without
himself.

Why do you call God a Spirit?

Ans. To declare his being to be such as has no body, and is not subject to
our outward senses, that we admit not any base conceit of his Majesty, in
thinking him to be like unto any thing which can be seen by the eye of man.

What understand you by this singleness or simplicity of Gods nature?

Ans. That he has no parts nor qualities in him, Exo 33.19, 20. Rev. 1.8. Isa.
14.17. cap* 43.29. v. 8.14.
but whatsoever is in him is God, and Gods whole Essence.

What gather you of this that God has no parts nor qualities?

Ans. That he neither can be divided, Mal. 3.6. Jam. 1.17.
nor changed, but remains always in the same state without any alteration at
all.

In what respect do you call Gods Essence infinite?

Ans. In that it is free from all measure, both of time and place.

How is God free from all measure of time?

Ans. In that he is eternal without beginning, Rev. 1.8. Psalm 92.4. 2 Pet.
3.8. John 8.58.
and without ending, never elder nor younger, and has all things present, unto
him neither former or later, past or to come.

How is God infinite in regard of place?

1 Kin 8.27. Psalm. 145.3. Jer. 1.23, 24.
Ans. In that he fills all things and places both within and without the
world, present every where, contained no where.

How is he present every where? has he one part of himself here, and another
there?

Ans. No, for he has no parts at all whereby he might be divided, and
therefore must be wholly wheresoever he is.

What do you call the life of God?

Ans. That by which the divine nature is in perpetual action, Deuteronomy. 10.6. cap.
30.40. John 3.10. Heb. 10.31. 1 Timothy 4.16. cap. 6.17.
most simply and infinitely moving it self, in respect whereof the Scripture
calls him the Living GOD.

What gather you of the comparing this infinitenes and simplicity (or
singleness) of Gods nature, with his life and motion?

Answ. That when strength, justice, Prove. 8.14. 1 John 4.17. Isa. 43.2^.
and mercy are attributed unto God, we must conceive that they are in him
without all measure, and further also that they be not diverse virtues whereby
his nature is qualified; but that all they and every one of them is nothing
else but God himself, and his entire Essence.

Wherein does the life of God show it self? Jer. 32.17. Nahu. 1.3. Deuteronomy. 32.4.
Exo. 34 6, 7 Psalm. 89.13.


Ans. In his alsufficiencie, and in his holy will.

Wherein stands his Alsufficiency? Jer. 52.19. cap. 13.13. Job 9.4 Psalm.
147.5. Prove. 8.14. Jer. 8.10.


A. In his All-knowing wisdom, and his Almighty power.

Wherein does his wisdom consist?

Ans. In perfect knowledge of all things that either are or might be. Psalm.
147.5. Prove. 8.14. Jer. 8.10. cap. 52.19. cap. 13.13. Job. 9.4.


In what sort does God know all things? does he as we do, see one thing after
another?

Ans. No, Heb. 4.19.
but with one sight he continually beholds all things distinctly, whether
they be past, present, or to come.

How is He God Almighty?

Ans. Because he has power to bring to pass all things that can be, howsoever
to us they may seem impossible. Rev. 18. Mat. 19.26. Luke 1.37. Mar. 14 36.


Wherein is the holiness of his will seen? Mat. 19.17. Romans 9.18. Ex. 34.6, 7.
Neh. 9.17, 31, 32, 33. Psalm. 103.8, 9, 10. Lam. 3.22.


Ans. In his goodness and in his justice.

Wherein does he show his goodness?

Ans. In being beneficial unto his creatures, John 4.16. Psalm. 33.5. 1 Timothy
4.10. Psalm. 145.7, 8, 9, 17.
and showing mercy unto them in their miseries.

Wherein shows he his justice?

Deuteronomy. 32.4.
Ans. Both in his word, and in his deeds.

How shows he justice in his Word?

Ans. Because the truth thereof is most certain.

How shows he justice in his deeds?

Ans. By ordering and disposing all things rightly, Job 34.10, 1 Deuteronomy. 32.4.
Ps. 145.17. Romans 2.2. Rev. 5.6. Rev. 22.12. 1 Pet. 1.17. Psalm. 11.5.
and rendering to his creatures according to their works.

What do you call Persons in the Godhead?

Ans. Such as having one Essence or being equally common, are distinguished
(not divided) one from another by some incommunicable property.

How comes it to pass that there should be this diversity of Persons in the
Godhead?

Ans. Though the Essence or being of the Godhead be the same, and most simply
as has been declared; yet the manner of this being is not the same, and hence
arises the distinction of persons, in that beside the being which is common to
all, and the selfsame in all, they have every one some especial property which
cannot be common to the rest.

Which are these persons, and what are these personal Properties?

Ans. The first Person in order is the Father, who begets the Son. The
second is, the Son begotten of the Father. The third is, the Holy Ghost,
proceeding from the Father and the Son.

Does the Godhead of the Father beget the Godhead of the Son?

Ans. No, but the Person of the Father begets the Person of the Son.

Thus much of Gods nature, what are we to consider in his Kingdom?

Ans. First, Ephesians. 1.11. Acts 4.28*
the decree made from all eternity; and then the execution thereof accomplished
in time.

How was the decree made?

Ans. All things whatsoever should in time come to pass, with every small
circumstance appertaining thereunto, was ordained to be so from all eternity,
by Gods certain and unchangeable counsel.

Did God then before he made man, determine to save some, and reject others?

Ans. Yes surely, before they had done either good or evil, 2 Timothy 1.9. Romans
9.11, 21, 22* 23. Man 2.5, 34, 41. 2 Timothy 2.20. 1 These. 3.9.
God in his eternal counsel set some apart, upon whom he would in time show
the riches of his mercy, and determined to withhold the same from others, on
whom he would show the severity of his wrath.

What should move God to make this difference between Man and Man?

Ans. Only his own pleasure, Romans 9.11, 21, 22, 23. Prove. 16.4. Mat. 11.25,
26. Ephesians. 1.11. Jude 4.
whereby having purposed to create man for his own Glory, forasmuch as he was
not bound to show mercy unto any, and his Glory should appear as well in
executing of justice, as in showing mercy; It seemed good unto His Heavenly
wisdom to choose out a certain number toward whom he would extend his
undeserved mercy, leaving the rest to be spectacles of his justice.

Wherein does the execution of Gods decree consist? Psalm. 33.6. Psalm 148.5.
Neh. 9 6. Ps. 146.6, 7. Heb. 11.13.


Ans. In the works of the Creation and providence.

What was the manner of the Creation?

Ge* 2.1, 2, 3. Exo. 20.11. cap. 31.17. Col. 1.16. Genesis 1.4, 31.
Ans. In the beginning of time when no creature had any being, God by his Word
alone, did in the space of six days create all things, both visible and
invisible, making every one of them good in their kind.

What are principal creatures which were ordained unto an everlasting
condition?

Ans. Angels altogether spiritual and void of bodies: And Man consisting of
two parts, the body which is earthly, and the ^^ule which is spiritual, and
therefore not subject to mortality.

In what regard is man said to be made according to the likeness and Image of
God?

Ans. In regard especially of the perfections of the powers of the soul;
namely, the wisdom of the mind, and the true holiness of his free will.

How are you to consider of Gods Providence?

Ans. Both as it is common unto all the creatures which are thereby sustained
in their being, and ordered according to the Lords will, and as it properly
concerns the everlasting condition of the principal creatures; to wit,
Angels, and men.

What is that which concerns Angels?

Ans. Some of them remained in that blessed condition wherein they were
created, and are by Gods grace for ever established therein. Others kept it
not, but wilfully left the same, and therefore are condemned to everlasting
torment in Hell, without all hope of recovery.

How is the state of mankind ordered?

Ans. In this Life by the tenor of a twofold Covenant, Gal. 3.10.11, 12, 13,
14. Romans 3.27. cap. 10.46. Heb. 9.27. Romans 14.10, 12. Mat. 25.31, 32.
and in the World to come, by the sentence of a twofold judgment.

What is the first of these Covenants?

Ans. The Law, or the covenant of works, whereby God promises everlasting
life unto man, upon condition that he perform entire and perfect obedience
unto his Law, according to that strength wherewith he was endued by nature of
his creation, and in like sort threatens death unto him if he do not perform
the same.

What Seal did God use for the strengthening of his Covenant? Genesis 2.9.17. cap.
3.17. Genesis 3.3, 7, 11, 17, 22, 24 Rev. 2 7. Prove. 3.18.


Ans. The two Trees which he planted in the middle of Paradise, the one of
life, the other of knowledge of good and evil.

What did the Tree of life signify?

Ans. That man should have assurance of everlasting life if he continued in
obedience.

What did the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil signify?

Ans. That if man did fall from obedience, he should be surely punished with
everlasting death, and so know by experience in himself, what evil was, as
before he knew by experience that only which was good.

What was the event of this Covenant?

Ans. By one man sin entered into the World, Romans 5.12.
and Death by sin, and so Death went over all men, forasmuch as all men have
sinned.

How did sin enter?

Ans. Whereas God had threatened unto our first Parents, Genesis 3.
that whatsoever day they did eat of that forbidden fruit they should certainly
die. They believing rather the word of the Devil that they should not dye, and
subscribing unto his reproachful blasphemy, whereby he charged God with envy
toward their estate, as if he had therefore forbidden the fruit, least by
eating thereof they should become like God himself, entered into action of
rebellion against the Lord who made them, and openly transgressed his
Commandment.

What follows from this?

Ans. First, Jam. 1.4. Gal. 5.19. Col. 2 3, 9, 10.
the corruption of nature, called original sin, derived by continual
descent from Father to Son, wherewith all the powers of the soul and body
are infected, and that in all men equally, and then actual sin arises from
hence.

Show how the principal powers of the soul are defiled by this corruption of
our nature?

Ans. First, the understanding is blinded with ignorance and infidelity. Titus
1.15.
Secondly, the memory is prone to forget the good things which the
understanding has conceived. Thirdly, the will is disobedient unto the will of
God, understood and remembered by us, the freedom and holiness which it had at
the first being lost, and is now wholly bent to sin. Fourthly, the affections
are ready to overrule the will, and are subject to all disorder. Lastly, the
conscience it self is distempered and polluted.

In what sort is the conscience thus distempered?

Ans. The duties thereof being two, Romans 2.15. John 8.9. Romans 14.23
especially to give direction in things to be done, and to give both witness
and judgment in things done: Gal. 1.4. 1 Chr. 13.9. John 16.2. Ephesians. 4.18, 19.
1 Timothy 4.2. Col. 2.22. Rom, 7.9. Prove. 28.1. Act. 24.26.
for the first, it sometimes gives no direction at all, and thereupon makes a
man to sin in doing of an action, otherwise good and lawful; sometimes it
gives a direction, but a wrong one, and so becomes a blind guide, forbidding
to do things which God allows, and commanding to do things which God
forbids. For the second, it sometimes gives no judgment at all, nor
checking the offender as it should; but being benumbed, and as it were seared
with an hot iron; It sometimes gives judgment, but falsely condemning where it
should excuse, and excusing where it should condemn, thereby filling the mind
with false fears, or feeding it with vain comforts, and sometimes gives true
judgment, but uncomfortable and fearful, tormenting the guilty soul as it
were with the flashes of hellfire.

What are the kinds of actual sinn^?

Ans. Such as are inward in the thoughts of the mind and lusts of the heart,
Jam. 1.14, 15. Ephesians. 2.3. Mat. 5.28. cap. 11.34. cap. 13.19. c. 25.42, 43. Isa.
1.16, 17. Romans 3.10.
or outward, in word or deed, whereby the things are done which should be
omitted, and those things omitted, which should be done.

What is the death which all men are subject unto, by reason of these sins?

Ans. The curse of God both upon the things that belong unto them (such as are
their Wife and Children, Romans 7.10. Gal. 3.10. Deuteronomy. 28.15, 16. Psalm. 119.10,
12. Prove. 10.7.
honor, possessions, use of Gods Creatures) and upon their own persons in life
and death.

What are the curses they are subject to in this life?

Ans. All temporal calamities both in body (which is subject unto infinite
miseries) and in soul, Deu. 28.21.22. Lev. 26.16, 17. John 5.^4. Deuteronomy. 28.28,
66, 67. Psalm. 69.12. 1 John 2.16. Ephesians. 2.2. Col. 1.13. cap. 4.4.
which is plagued sometime with madness, sometime with the terror of a guilty
conscience, sometimes with a benumbed and seared conscience, sometime with
hardness of heart, which cannot repent; and finally, a spiritual slavery
under the power of the world and the devil.

What is the death that follows this miserable life?

Luke 16.23, 24, 26. Rev. 21 8. 2 These. 1.9.
Ans. First, a separation of the soul from the body, and then an everlasting
separation of the whole man from the presence of God with unspeakable torment
in hellfire, never to be ended, which is the second death.

If all mankind be subject to this damnation, how then shall any man be saved?

Ans. Surely by this first Covenant of the Law, Romans 3.19, 20. cap. 8.3. Gal.
2.16. cap. 3.10, 11, 12, 21, 22. Ep. 2.3, 4, 5
no flesh can be saved, but every one must receive in himself the sentence of
condemnation; yet the Lord being a God of mercy, has not left us here, but
entered into a second Covenant with mankind.

What is the second Covenant?

A. The Gospel or the Covenant of grace, Gal. 3.16, 17. John 1.12. Romans 5.17.
Ephesians. 2.13, 14. Romans 2.21, 22. John 10.3. Psalm. 3.9.
whereby God promises everlasting life unto man, upon condition that he be
reconciled to him in Christ; for as the condition of the 1. was the continuance
of that justice, which was to be found in man's own person; so the condition of
the second is the obtaining of that justice which is found without himself in
the person of the Mediator Jesus Christ.

What are we to consider in Christ our Mediator?

Ans. Two things, his nature and his office.

How many natures be there in Christ?

Ans. Two, the Godhead, and the Manhood; remaining still distinct in their
substance, properties and actions.

How many persons has he?

Ans. Only one, which is the person of the Son of God, for the second person in
the Trinity took upon him, not the person, but the nature of man; to wit, a
body and a reasonable soul, which do not subsist alone, (as we see in all
other men) but are wholly sustained in the person of the Son of God.

What is the use of this wonderful union of the two natures in one Person?

Ans. Our nature being received into the Union of the Person of the Son of God,
the sufferings and the obedience which it performed became of infinite value,
as being the sufferings of him who was God, equal with the Father.

What is the Office of Christ?

Ans. To be a Mediator betwixt God and Man. 1 Timothy 2.5.


What part of his Office did he exercise concerning God?

Heb. 2.7. cap. 5.1. cap. 7.24.
Ans. His Priesthood.

What are the parts of his Priestly Office?

Heb. 7.24, 35, 26, 27.
Ans. The satisfaction of Gods justice, and his intercession.

What is required of Christ for the satisfaction of Gods justice?

Ans. The paying of the price which was due for the breach of the Law committed
by mankind, and the performance of that righteousness, which man by the Law
was bound unto, but unable to accomplish.

How was Christ to pay the price which was due for the sin of mankind?

Ans. By that wonderful humiliation, Psalm. 2.7, 8. Gal. 3.13.
whereby he that was equal with God, made himself of no reputation, and became
obedient unto the death, sustaining both in body and soul, the curse that was
due to the transgression of the Law.

What righteousness was there required of Christ in our behalf?

Ans. Both original which he had from His conception (being conceived by the
Holy Ghost, in all pureness and holiness of nature) and actual which he
performed by yielding perfect obedience, in the whole course of His life, unto
all the precepts of Gods Law.

What is the Intercession of Christ?

Ans. That part of His Priesthood, Acts 7.25. Heb. 9.10. Jam. 8.34: Joh. 17.20,
44. Exo. 28.38. 1 Pet. 2.5. Rev. 8.3.
whereby He makes request unto His Father for us, and presents unto Him both
our Persons, and our imperfect obedience, making both of them (however in
themselves polluted) by the merit of His satisfaction, to be acceptable in Gods
sight.

Thus much of that part of the office of the Mediator which is exercised in
things concerning God; how does He exercise himself in things concerning man?

Romans 5.15, 17, 19. John 5.21. cap. 17.2, 6. Luke 4.18, 19.
Ans. By communicating unto man that grace and redemption which he has
purchased from His Father.

What parts of His Office does He exercise here?

An. His Prophetical and Kingly Office.

What is His Prophetical Office? Deu. 18.18. John 1.18. cap. 8.26. cap 15.15.
Ephesians. 2.17. Isa. 61.12. Heb. 1.2. cap. 2 3. cap. 3.1, 2. Mat. 27.17. cap. 23.10.
Luke 24, 25. Acts 16.4. 1 Cor. 2.10, 11, 12.


Ans. That whereby He informs us of the benefits of our redemption, and
reveals the whole will of His Father unto us, both by the outward means
which He has provided for the instruction of His Church, and by inward
enlightening of our minds by His Holy Spirit.

What is the Kingly office?

Ans. That whereby He rules His Subjects, Psa. 26.8, 9. John 18.36. Zac. 9.9,
10. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22. Mat. 22.7, 13. Luke 19.14.25, 27. Ps. 22. 1 Cor. 15.25,
27.
and confounds all his enemies.

How does He rule His Subjects?

Ans. By making the Redemption which He has wrought effectual in the Elect, 1
Cor. 15.45. Ephesians. 4.1, 15, 16. Col. 1.13. cap. 2.12. John 5.25, 26, 27. cap.
17.2. 1 Cor. 13.9. Romans 14.17. 2 Pet. 1.3, ^.
calling those whom by His Prophetical office He has taught to embrace the
benefits offered unto them, and governing them being called both by these
outward Ordinances which He has instituted in the Church, Romans 8.10. 1 Cor.
1.24. 1 Pet. 5.10. Ephesians. 1.22. cap. 5.24. Luke 1.31. Isa. 9.6, 7. Ephesians. 4.11.
Math. 18.17, 18. Acts 20.31. Mat. 3.11. 1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9. 2 Cor. ^2. 2 Cor.
33. Ephesians. 2.
and by the inward operation of His blessed Spirit.

Having thus declared the Natures and Office of Christ, the Mediator of the New
Covenant; What are you now to consider in the condition of mankind which hold
by Him?

Ans. Two things, the perticipation of the grace of Christ, 1 John 1.3. Ephesians.
4.11, 12, 15, 16. Gal 3.2, 5, 6.
effectually communicated by the operation of Gods Spirit unto the Catholic
Church, 1 These. 2.13. Ephesians. 1.13, 22, 23. Ephesians. 5.26, 27, 29.
which is the Body and Spouse of Christ, out of which there is no salvation;
and the outward means ordained for the offering and effecting of the same,
vouchsafed unto the Visible Church.

How is the Grace of God effectually communicated to the Elect, of whom the
Catholic Church does consist?

Ans. By that wonderful Union, John 17.21, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 1.13. Ephesians. 2.2. c.
5.^9, 30.
, whereby Christ and His Church are made one; so that all the Elect being
ingrafted into him, John 15.1, 2, 4, 5. Ephesians. 4.15, 16. Col. 2.19.
grow together into one Mystical Body, whereof He is the Head.

What is the bond of this union?

1 Cor. 13.13. 1 John 4.24. Romans 5.5, 8, 9. Ephesians. 2.22. Phil. 2.1.
Ans. The communion of Gods Spirit, which being derived from that Man Christ
Jesus, upon all the Elect, as from the Head unto the Members, gives unto them
Spiritual life, and makes them pertakers of Christ with all His benefits,

What are the benefits which arise to Gods children from hence?

Ans. Reconciliation and Sanctification. 1 Cor 6.11. 1 John 2.5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.2.
2 Pet. 2.3, 4. Col. 1.21, 22. Heb. 9.10, 14.


What is Reconciliation?

A. That grace whereby we are freed from Gods curse, Romans 5 10. 2 Cor. 5.8, 9
Ephesians. 2.16. 1 Col. 2.21.
and restored unto His Fatherly favor.

What are the branches of this Reconciliation?

Ans. Justification and Adoption.

What is Justification?

Ans. That Grace whereby we are freed from the gilt of sin, Gal. 3.8, 13, 14.
1 Cor. 3.21. Romans 4.23, 24.
and accounted righteous in Christ Jesus our Redeemer.

How then must sinful man look to be justified in the sight of God?

Ans. By the mercy of God alone, Romans 13.24, 25, 26. Ephesians. 2.8* 9. Romans 8.32.
Isa. 9.6. Gal. 3.5, 9. Col. 1.14, 21, 22. and ver. 12, 13 Acts 13.38, 39.
whereby he freely bestows His Son upon him, imputing man's sins unto
Christ, and Christ's Righteousness unto man, whereby the sinner being possessed
of Jesus Christ, obtains of God remission of sins, and imputation of
Righteousness.

What is Adoption?

Romans 8.13. Gal. 2.26. Ephesians. 1.3.
Ans. That grace whereby we are not only made friends with God, but also His
Sons and heirs with Christ.

What is Sanctifica^^^n?

A. That grace whereby we are freed from that bondage of sin remaining in us,
and restored unto the freedom of Righteousness.

What be parts of Sanctification?

Ans. Mortification, Ephesians. 4.22, 23. Romans 6.4, 11, 13. Col. 2.12.
whereby our natural corruption is subdued, and vivification or quickening,
whereby inherent holiness is renewed in us.

Is there no distinction to be made among them that thus receive Christ?

Acts 2.3^. 1 Cor. 2.14. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Ephesians. 3.17. 1 These. 1.3. Titus 3.8. 1 Timothy 1.5. Gal. 3.6. Acts 23.9.
Ans. Yes, for some are not capable of knowledge, as Infants, and such as we
term Naturals. Othersome are of discretion in the former sort, we are not to
proceed further then Gods election, and the secret operation of the Holy Ghost.
In the other there is further required, a lively faith bringing forth fruit of
true holiness

Is it in man's power to attain this Faith and Holiness? 1 Cor. 2.12, 14.
Phil. 1.16. cap. 2.3, 15.


Ans. No, but God works them in his children according to that measure which
he in his children sees fit. 1 Cor. 3.3. 2 Timothy 2.23 Jer. 31.18. 1 Pet. 1.9.
Ephesians. 3.20.


What do you understand by Faith?

Ans. A gift of God, Ephesians. 1.18. Heb. 11.1, 2, 3. Col. 2.7, 12. Ephesians. 3.12, 17.
Joh. 11.12, 16. Gal. 3.16, 20. Phil. 3.8, 9. 2 Timothy 1.6. Heb. 10.22, 23. 2 Cor.
13.5.
whereby man being persuaded not only of the truth of Gods Word in general;
but also of the promises of the Gospel in particular, applies Christ with all
his benefits, unto the comfort of his own soul.

How are we said to be justified by Faith?

Ans. Not as though we were just, Act. 2.41, 42 c. 10.47, 48. Mat. 3.6, 11.
cap. 28.19. c. 8.36, 37.
for the worthiness of this virtue, for in such respect Christ alone is our
righteousness; but because faith, and faith only is the instrument fit to
apprehend and receive, not to work or procure our justification, and so to
knit us unto Christ that we may be made per^akers of all his benefits.

What is that holiness which accompanies this justifying faith?

Ans. A gift of God, whereby the heart of the believer is withdrawn from
evil, Romans 8.1. 1 John 3.9. 1 Pet. 3.9. 1 Pet. 1.4. Titus 2.12. Gal. 6.15.
and converted unto newnes of life.

Wherein does this virtue show it self?

Ans. First, in unfeigned repentance, and then in cheerful obedience springing
from the same.

What are the parts of repentance?

Ans. Two, 2 Cor. 7.10, 11. Jer. 31.18, 19. Act. 11.2^, 23. Acts 26.20*
a true grief wrought in the heart of the believer, for offending so gracious
a God by his former transgressions. And a conversion unto God again, with full
purpose of heart, ever after to cleave unto him, and to refrain from that
which shall be displeasing in his sight.

What is the direction of that obedience which God requires of man?

A. The moral Law, whereof the ten Commandments are an abridgement.

What is the sum of the Law? Romans 13.8. 1 Timothy 1.5. Col. 3.14.


Ans. Love.

What be the parts thereof?

Ans. The love which we owe unto God, Mat. 22.37, 38, 39, 40. Mark 12.30, 31,
32.
commanded in the first; and the love which we owe unto our Neighbors,
commanded in the second Table.

How do you distinguish the four Commandments which belong unto the first
Table?

Ans. They do either respect the conforming of the inward powers of the soul,
to the acknowledgement of the true God, as the first Commandment; or the holy
use of the outward means of Gods worship, as in the three following.

What are the duties which concern the outward means of Gods worship?

Ans. They are either such as are to be performed every day as occasion shall
require, or such as are appointed for a certain day.

What Commandments do belong unto the first kind?

Ans. The second concerning the solemn worship of Religion; and the third,
concerning that respect which we are to have of Gods honor in the common
carriage of our life.

What Commandment belongs to the second kind?

Ans. The fourth, injoyning the special sanctification of the Sabbath day.

How do you distinguish the six Commandments belonging to the second Table?

Ans. The first five do ordain such actions as are enjoined with consent of
the mind at least: The last, respects the first motions that arise in the
heart before any consent be given.

What are the duties ^ppertaining to the first kind?

Ans. They are either due unto certain persons, in regard of some special
bonds; or to all men in general, by a certain rite; the first sort is set
down in the first Commandment; the other, in the four next.

What is the outward means whereby the Gospel is offered unto mankind?

A. The Ministry of the Gospel, which is exercised in the visible Church of
Christ.

Of whom does the visible Church cons^st?

Ans. Of public Officers, Rev. 1.20. Phil. 1.1. Act. 20, 17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1,
2, 3. 1 Timothy 3.2, 13. Romans 12.7, 8 1 Cor. 4.1. Heb. 13.17, 24.
ordained to be Ministers of Christ, and disposers of Heavenly things,
according to the Prescript of the Lord, and the rest of the Saints, who with
obedience are to subject themselves to the Ordinance of God.

What are the parts of the outward Ministry?

Ans. The administration of the Word, and of the Ordinances exercised
thereunto, which are especially Sacraments and Censures.

What is the Word?

2 Chr. 17.7. Act. 2.40, 41 cap. 11.20. 1 Cor. 4.13. Romans 10.17. John 17.10.
Ephesians. 1.13.
Ans. That part of the outward Ministry which consists in the delivery of
Doctrine, and this is the ordinary instrument which God uses in begetting
Faith.

What order is there used in the delivery of the Word for the begetting of
Faith?

Ans. First, Romans 3 10. cap. 7.9, 10. Gal 3.12, 23. Acts 2.37. Mat. 13.24. cap.
11.28. Gal. 2.18, 19. Heb. 4.16. Hos. 14, 2, 3. Romans 8.13, 26,
the Covenant of the Law is urged to make sin and the punishment thereof known,
whereupon the sting of conscience pricketh the heart with a sense of Gods wrath,
and makes man utterly to despair of any ability in himself to obtain
everlasting life; after this preparation the mercies of the Gospel are
propounded, whereupon the sinner resuming hope of pardon, sueth unto God for
mercy, and particularly applies unto his own soul those comfortable promises,
and has wrought in him by the Spirit of God, an earnest desire at the least to
believe and repent.

What is a Sacrament?

Ans. A visible sign ordained by God, to be a seal for confirmation of the
promises of the Gospel, unto those who perform the conditions required in the
same.

How is this done by a Sacrament?

A. By a fit similitude between the sign and the things signified; 1 Cor.
10.^, 2, 3, 4* 16. Genesis 17.10, 11. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Romans 2.28, 29. Mat. 3 11. 1 Pet.
3.21. Col. 2.11, 12, 13. Act. 2.41, 42 cap. 14.22. cap. 20.32. Romans 4.11.
the benefit of the Gospel is represented unto the eye, and the assurance of
enjoying the same, confirmed to such as are within the Covenant: Wherefore as
the preaching of the word is the ordinary means of begetting Faith; so both it
and the holy use of the Sacraments, be the instruments of the Holy Ghost, to
increase and confirm the same.

How many kinds of Sacraments be there?

Ans. Two, the first of Admission of Gods children: 1 Cor. 10.23.1, 2, 3, 4,
16. cap. 4.12, 13. Exo. 12.28.
into the Church, there to be pertakers of an everlasting communion with them;
the second, of his preservation or nourishment therein, to assure him of his
continual increase in Christ, in which respect the former is once, the lat^er
often to be administered.

What do you understand by Censures?

Ans. The Ordinance which God has appointed for the confirmation of the
threatenings of the Gospel against the disobedient. Mat. 18.17, 18. 1 Cor. 5.4,
5.


How are these Censures exercised?

Ans. First, Mat. 18.1^^ 16, 17, 18. 2 These. 3.14. 1 Cor. 5.4* 5, 11, 13. 2
Cor. 1.6, 7.8. 2 Timothy 2.2^. 1 Cor. 16.22 John 9.22.
by the word alone by admonition. Secondly, by afflicting a penalty, either by
shutting up the offender in the Lords prison, till such time as he show tokens
of repentance, or by cutting off the rotten member from the rest of the body.

Has this administration of the Gospel been always after the same manner?

Ans. For substance it has always bin the same, Heb. 11.2, 8, 9, 10.15. cap.
13.8 9, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8. Acts 10 43. cap. 13.11. cap. 26.6, 7. Luke
16.16. John 1.17.
but in regard of the m^nner proper to certain times, it is distinguished into
two kinds, the old and the new.

What call you the old Ministry*

A. That which was delivered unto the Fathers, to continue until the fullness
of time, Heb. 11. c. 9 1, 9, 10. Acts 7.44. 2 Cor. 3.7, 11.
wherein, by the coming of Christ it was to be reformed.

What were the Properties of this Ministry?

Ans. First, the Commandments of the Law were more largely, Mal. 4.4. Jer. 21
31, 32, 33. Heb. 11.13. 2 Cor. 3.13, 18. Heb. 8. 9, 13. 2 Cor. 3 11, 13. Gal.
4.3, 4. Col. 2.16, 17.
and the promises of Christ more sparingly and darkly propounded, these la^ter
being so much the more generally and obscurely delivered, as the manifesting of
them was further off. Secondly, these promises of things to come were shadows,
with a similitude of Types and Figures; which when the truth should be
exhibited were to vanish away.

What were the chief States and Periods of this old Ministry?

Ans.. The first from Adam to Abraham, the second from Abraham to Christ.

What were the special Properties of the latter of these two Periods?

Ans. First, it was more especially restrained unto a certain Family and
Nation. Luke 1.44, 45. Ps. 44.19, 26. Romans 9.4. Act. 13.17. Deuteronomy. 4.1, 6, 7, 8,
17. cap. 1.6, 7, 8, 14. cap. 2.26. cap. 26.18, 19. John 1.16, 17. Ex. 24 7, 8.
Deuteronomy. 4.12. Romans 10.5. H^. 9 ^, 2, 3. John 7.^2.
Secondly, it had joined with it a solemn repetition and declaration of the
first Covenant of the Law. Thirdly, besides the Ceremonies which were greatly
enlarged under Moses, it had Sacraments also added unto it.

What were the ordinary Sacraments of this Ministry?

Ans. The Sacrament of Admission in the Exo. 12 48. Acts 7.8. John 7.22.
Church was Circumcision, Genesis 7.9, 10 Romans 4.11. Col. 2.11. Deuteronomy 30.6, 7. Exo
12.3, 4. Number. 9.11, 12. Deu 16.2. 1 Cor. 5.7. 1 Pet. 5.19. John ^9.36. Exo.
12.46.
instituted in the days of Abraham: The other of continual preservation and
nourishment, the Paschall Lamb instituted in the time of Moses.

What is the new Administration of the Gospel?

John 1.17. Heb. 1.2. cap. 2.3, 4. cap 3.5, 6. 1 Cor. 3.11. Heb. 12.27, 28.
Ans. That which is delivered unto us by Christ to continue unto the end of the
world.

What are the Properties thereof?

Ans. First, it is indifferently propounded unto all people, Is^. 41.1, 2. c 61
3, 4, 5* cap 65.12. cap. 66.12, 19, 21. John 16.10. Mat. 18.19, 20. Romans 15.25,
26. Ephesians. 3.5, 6, 8, 9. Col. 1.5, 6. John 1.17. cap. 14.21. Romans 11.2, 3. 1 Pet.
1.10, 11, 12. 1 Cor. 1.23, 2^.
whether they be Jews or Gentiles, and in that respect is Catholic or
Universal. Secondly, it is full of grace and truth, bringing joyful tidings
unto mankind, that whatsoever was formerly promised of Christ, is now
accomplished, and so in stead of the ancient types and shadows exhibited, the
things themselves, with a large declaration of all the benefits of the Gospel.

What be the principal points of the word of this Ministry?

Heb 9.12, 16, 18. 1 Timothy 3.16. Luke 1.35. Romans 1.1, 2, 3. Job. 1.14, 45. John
19.28, 30. Mat. 1.18.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Mat. 27.2, 26, 51. cap. 12.12. c
27.^9, 60. Romans 6.9. Luke 23.43, 46, 47. Mat. 16.21. cap. 28.16. 1 Cor. 15.4,
6, 8.
Ans. That Christ our Savior (whom God by his Prophets had promised to send
into the World is come in the flesh, and has accomplished the work of our
redemption: That he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified and dyed upon the Cross: That
Body and Soul being thus separated, 1 Timothy 2.8. Man. 16.19. Acts 1.9, 10, 11.
Ephesians. 4.10. Heb. 1.3. 2 Timothy 4.1.
his body was laid in the grave, and remained under the power of death, and his
soul went into the place appointed for the souls of the righteous; namely
Paradise, the Seat of the Blessed. That the third day body and soul being
joined together again, he rose from the dead, and afterward ascended up into
Heaven, where he sits at the right hand of His Father, until such time as He
shall come unto the last Judgment.

What are the Sacraments of this Ministry?

Ans. The Sacrament of Admission into the Church is B^ptisme, (which seals
unto us our Spiritual Birth) the other Sacrament of our continual
preservation is the Lords Supper, which seals unto us our continual
nourishment.
