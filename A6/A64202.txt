indeed from the Tower-staires to Westminster Ferry, For want of a stirring
Midsummer Term, This year of Disasters, 1642.

SAINT HILLARIES TEARS.
WHat? Middsomer? How comes it then the Sun, and Moon, of Gold and Silver,
which had wont to disperse their radiant luster with greater brightness, and
consolation then those that shine in the Zodiac, have now withdrawn their
splendour, and left us in this Cimmerian night of small takings? A Term so like
a vacation? you would take them to be the Gemini, which constellation never
appears but out of darkness, There is no plague to fright away the Termers,
unless it be that plague of plagues, want of trading, which their money would
easily cure.

At Westminster Hall wherein pristine ages you might without offense shoulder a
Lord to get through the press, now you may walk in the same posture a Justice
of peace does in his own great Hall at the examination of a Delinquent, play
with your bandstrings, and twist your beard with the same gravity, and not an
elbow-rub to disturb you, The Benchers better half empty, and those few
Judges left have time enough to get a nap, and no noise to awake them, The
barr^ that had wont to swell with a fivefould row of listed gowns, where the
favorites in the front imburs'd more Fees then would supply an Army, and the
rest (by Lady) had good doings, a motion or a short cause to open, are now so
empty that boys may peep over them, The surly Tipstaves and messengers whom
your best Oratory, and money to boot, would hardly persuade to admit you
within the bench-roome, stands looking over the door as it were through a
Pillory, to ask you Sir shall I open? and for the teaster you give him, kisses
his hand and scrapes you a leg, as fawningly, as a hungry Spanill takes a bone
from his master, The Lawyers in stead of perusing the breviates, and reducing
the matter in question to Cases, now buying up all the pamphlets, and
dispersing themselves into corners to read them, thereby to keep their
tongues in use, lest the faculties of brawling should be dried up with
unwilling silence.

The prime Court the Chancery, (wherein the Clerks had wont to dash their
clients out of countenance with long dashes, The examiners to take the
depositions in Hyperboles, and round about Robin-hood circumstances, with said
and aforesaids to enlarge the number of streets, The Registers to whom you used
to come, in the same equipage as if you had a suit to the council board, and
had this ready answer, well you must wait till the latter end o'th term)
now as silent as a Puritan conventicle when the lights are out, no waiting, no
Hyperboles, no Dashes, nor any employment, toward maintenance of Taffata,
Sack, Wenches, and other the usual prodigalities, and luxuries, whereunto the
Gentlemen that practice there are addicted. That Court that has been known
to decree pro, reveiw, and decree Con, has the Bar now empty of Pro's, and
Con's, no wrangling, no noise but the lamentation of my Lords escape.

The Court of Requests to whom so many thousands of loyal, faithful, and
obedient Subjects have come humbly complaining, and showing, can show you at
this present no subject but his own humble complaint, you that knew it when
the necessity of over great employment, caused it to double the number of its
Clerks, and they to treble theirs, when it was solicited by petitions as
numberless as Hops, or Ants, which all her Welsh kindred had brought two
hundred and twelve and and twenty miles, to get admitted in Forma pauperis, and
thereby enabled to do more mischief then the best purs't Clyents in England,
would wonder how it should tumble from such a throng, to such a vacation of
employment. That that Court that has made two hundred Orders in one cause,
should be in danger not to have one cause to Order, It is me thinks a
lamentable change.

The Ministers of the Court of Wards, do all wear mourning liveries in their
faces, as if Fate had granted out writs in the nature of a Diem clausit
extremum, after the death of Feoda multa, to find their Offices for Vacua
plurima, And of all Courts else the Chequers must needs come within the
limitation of this calamity, because they stand so much for the King, and in
that predicament is the Kings Bench, marry if any thrive it must needs be the
Common Pleas, for as the times go nothing stands stiff, but what pertaines to
the Commons and yet they meet with revolts too as well as the rest.

On both sides of the Hall they complain, At Heaven they say there is not a
Lawier no Clerk comes near them: And at hell where they had wont to flock
like Swallows to a Reed bush, they come but dropping in now and then one, as
apportunity of business makes them able, the Coaches which had wont to rumble
up and down as they would challenge Heaven to thunder for a wager, and did use
to lie in the Palace yard, and before the Innes of Court gates, like so many
Busses, or fleetes of fisherboats in harbor, pearing over the haven keys, now
seem like western Barges on the Thames at a high tide, here and there one.

And you are no sooner out of the Hall-yard but entering into Kings street, you
find the Cooks leaning against the Dore-postes, ruminating upon those Halcion
Terms, when whole herds of Clerks, Solicitors and their Clyents, had wont to
come with their sharpe-set noses, and stomach, from the Hall, and devour the
Puddings, and minc't Pyes by dozins, as swiftly as a kennell of Hounds would
worry up a dead Horse, And now the Courts are risen before they are hungry, The
Tavernes, where an Iron Mill would hardly have drowned the noise of the yawling
boys, the Bar-bell, the fidling, and roreing above stairs, now so silent you
may rock a child asleep: The spruce Mistress that had wont to sit in the Bar,
domineering over the Drawers, and not to be spoken withal if you would kiss
her arse to speak with her, now so familiar, bids you so heartily welcome, and
will come and join her half pint with ye, and let you salute her, and thank
you, And think it very well if all that courtesy will invite you to mount the
reckoning to a pottle, The Alehouses and Tobacko-shops are grown sweet for
want of takings, you may walk by them without danger of being choack't.

All along the strand, (lodgings being empty) you shall find the housekeepers
generally projecting where to borrow, and what to pawn, toward payment of
their quarters rents, thereby to preserve their Leases from forfeiture, and
themselves, from the tyranny of their stern Landlords, who are very infidells
in trusting, and will not forbear a minute; Nay the mischief on it is, there
are no Courtiers nor bad paymaisters to curse, and rail at for want of money,
and that is the heaviest torment of all.

If you step aside into Coven-Garden, long Acre, and Drury Lane, where those
D^ves of Venus, those Birds of youth, and beauty, (the wanton Ladies) do build
their nests, you shall find them in such a dump of amazement, to see the hopes
of their trading frustrate, their beauties decayed for want of means to
procure Pomatum, and Fucus, Their eyes which like glistering comets had wont to
dazzle their Idolaters, now shadowed with clouds of griese, their golden tresses
which had wont to flag about their shoulders, like so many ensigns in Cupides
Regiment, and every hair thereof had a servant or visitant, which did
superstitiously dote on it, now for want of curling, and ordering grown to the
fashion of an Irish rugge, And what a misery it is to see the Velvets, Sattins,
and Taffaties, nay the curious smockes, sent to the brokers, and the whole
wardrope that was purchased with so large a proportion of free favors, and
communities, now reduced to one pore tufted holland suit? It is not pity to
see them (pore souls) who had wont to shine like so many constellations in the
Firmament of the suburbs, and be hurried in Coaches to the Tavernes, and
Sparagus Gardens, where ten or twenty pounds suppers were but trifles with
them, should now go to the Chandlers, and herbe-wives in slip-shooes, for
Cheese and Onions to dinner? Well content your selves, (you attractive
Load-stones, of delicious and smooth damnation) And doubtless the Arch-angell
my successor, will bring your angels to redeem all, And your Champions and
Cavaliers, will return with their pockets doubly furnished, for you are as sure
of them as they are of your diseases, They are now but only purchasing, and
laying up for you against their coming home, This dearth of traffic, is but
a preparation to a large mart to follow, and this devowring winter of penury,
does but presage a lively spring in the hot bloods of the young Gallantry,
which when it comes, you shall again enjoy those blessings of Wine, music,
good clothes, money, and dainty fare, be enabled to pay your railing
Land-ladies, and desie the beadle with as much impudence, as ever you did.

Well from you, I must follow the steps of many an old Letcherous Citizen, and
walk into London, where at the Exchange, the only question that is ask't is
what news? not from Aleppo, Constantinople the Straits, or Indies, but from
York, Ireland, and the Parliament, the answer is, why the King is still
obstinate, we shall have all our throats cut, those Expicurean throats of ours
are doomed to be cut, for swallowing so many luxurious cates, we had need to
prick up our ears, and elevate our broad overgrown horns for the safty of our
selves estates and children, marry as for our Wives, they know well enough
already, the danger of Courtiers, and Cavaliers, and therefore dare meet the
roughest Gamester of them all in any posture whatsoever.

From hence I travel to Guild Hall, where I find the Lawyers complaining of
infinite numbers of Banckerouts, men so far decayed in estate, that they will
compound to pay more then half, confess judgments, render their bodies to
prison, prostitute their wives, or any thing rather then stand out the
prosecution of a suit at Law.

Then at the Halls of every several Company, where in former ages, all the
Elements would scarce afford variety, to please the ingenuous gluttony of one
single feast, now you shall hear the meaner sort of Tradesmen, cursing those
devowring Foxes, the Masters, and Wardens, for the infinite charge their
insatiate stomachs do put them to; from hence go to their particular shops,
where there is nothing amongst the Tradesmen, but condoling the want of the
Courtiers money, and their wives and daughters almost distracted for want of
their company, There are no upstart Gallants, to draw into their books, no
yongb heirs to exchange shopware for Lordships withal, nor any trading ut one
with another, in which they are so familiarly acquainted with each others
knaveries, that alas, their gains are as good as nothing: And amongst them all
that quintessence of unquestionable simplicity, the very spirit of villainy,
extracted out of all compounded villainies, That Masterpeece or Idea of
dissimulation, which nature made her example to portraicture a Rogue by, the
Roundhead, who had wont to eat and pray, for the propagation of the Brethren
and sisters, of the sedicious faction, now is invoking of curses, upon the
malignant party, (the Achi^ophells as he calls them of the Kings Counsel) he
sneakes into the corners of the City, and after a licking of his lips, a
spitting, and a casting up his ugly eyes toward the place he is not worthy to
look at he whispers a tale through his rotten Nose, of a great danger that is
falling upon the Kingdom, And strange discoveries of imminent mischiefs,
which had happened if by some providence toward the Brethren of the selected
sedition, and for their sakes only it had not been prevented, And then at
length he tells you, that if the Prince were but at Saint Jameses, there would
be something done that Saint Hillary dares not repeat after him: This
thin-jaw'd, illooking, hungry rascal, this betle-brow'd, hollow-ey'd,
longnos'd, wide-mouthed cur: This carrion that stincks worse then the corrupted
River of Egypt, This Cockatrise that has hatched more Serpentine distempers,
then all the grave wisdom of a pregnant Kingdom can pacify, has been the
sole cause of poor S. Hillaries Tears; Who would think that this Idiot, this
Fathomlesse bellyed, Thingutted Snake should begin to hiss, and show his
sting, before the glorious splendour of those excellent worthies of our hopeful
Parliament, could have leisure to disperse it self upon this starved Kingdom,
that this Owl, this Buzzard, should be the instrument to bring clouds upon all
their proceedings, and yet without doubt will be the first that will oppose,
and curse them, when they shall please to declare that in the title of
Puritan, they never intended, blew-apron Preachers, Brownist, or Anabaptist;
And yet this seem confident, impudent, malignant, twenty times damned Heretic
dares attribute all their favor to himself, well may Saint Hillaries curse
pursue him: Nay the unquenchable zeal of his next Prayer, prolong the nonsense
and foolery thereof to so large a measure of time, that all the Roast-meate be
burned off the spit, before he have done, the White-broth boiled dry, and the
stewed and backed meat scorch't to cincers, (which in his opinion is one of
the greatest earthly curses that can befall him) May his wife be caught in the
spiritual act of her next carnal copulation, that all the World may discover
what yet they carry so closely, may the fervency of his hot zeal to the
younger sisters burn his reins, and kindneyes to ashes, and in stead of an
Hospital let him be cast into the Sawpit he so often defiled under pretense
of edification, Let him be burried amongst the Dunghills, as not worthy to come
near the Church he so abused, where none may find his grave but Dogs to piss
against it, may the ashes of his loathed carcass be collected from the
pestiferous urne, by Murderers and Mountebancks, to mix with their killing
potions, And may no poisons ever hereafter be operative, but what is compounded
with that infernal dust that as he lived to the confusion of all goodness,
and virtue, so he may after death be known or mentioned by no other notion,
then some fateboading character, that brings with it the dreadful summons of a
woeful horror to ensue, till which end be fallen upon him we shall never see
day of good trading again, but when it is accomplished S. Hillary will make a
Holiday, and in stead of his Tears will send you himnes and madrigalls for joy
of the Roundheads confusion, and your more full employment.

FINIS.
