UPON HER MAJESTY'S New Buildings at SOMERSET HOUSE.
GReat Queen, That does our Island bless
With Princes, and with Palaces;
Treated so ill, chased from your throne,
Returning you adorn the town,
And with a brave revenge do show,
Their glory went, and came with you;
While Peace from hence, and you were gone
Your houses in that Storm overthrown,
Those wounds which Civil Rage did give,
At once you pardon and Relieve:
Constant to England in your love,
As Birds are to their wonted Grove,
(...)hough by rude hands their Nests are spoiled,
There, the next Spring, again they build:
Accusing some malignant Star,
Not Britain, for that fatal War,
Your kindness banishes your fear,
Resolved to fix for ever here:
But what new Mine this work supplies?
Can such a pile from Ruin rise?
This like the first Creation shows,
As if at your Command it rose;
Frugality, and Bounty too,
Those differing virtues, meet in you;
From a Confined well managed store
You both employ, and feed the poor:
Let Foreign Princes vainly boast
The rude effects of Pride, and Cost,
Of vaster Fabriques, to which They
Contribute nothing, but the Pay:
This, by the Queen her self designed,
Gives us a pattern of her mind;
The state, and order does proclaim
The Genius of that Royal Dame,
Each part with just proportion graced,
And all to such advantage placed
That the fair view her Window yields,
The Town, the River, and the Fields
Entering, Beneath us, we descry,
And wonder how we came so high;
She needs no weary steps ascend,
All seems before her feet to bend,
And here, as She was born, She lies
High, without taking pains to rise.
London, Printed for Henry Herringman at the Anchor in the Lower Walk in the
New-Exchange. Anno Dom. 1665.
