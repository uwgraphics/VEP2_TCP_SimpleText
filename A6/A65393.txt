To my most Honored, and truly Noble Lady, the Lady Elizabeth Sidley of South
fleet.
Madam,
I Here present you with an Epitomee of some secret Passages, in the whole
reign of one King, part of another: Of which, my self have been either an Ear
or Eyewitness, or, from the testimony of such as have been Authors or
Actors, therefore unquestionable Truths.

It is the Conception and Birth of four days, with the help of some scattered
Papers (as a Midwife) to bring them into the world.

Being therefore but an Embryon, you cannot expect any perfect shape: But, what
it wants in that, you shall find in the most perfect form of undeniable Truths.

The honorable esteem I have ever had of you, and your brave Parts, is my
first motive of presenting it to your view: That it comes from no ordinary
Author (this being the first, and for ought I know the last) a second: That it
was written in a Melancholy humor, therefore fittest for your Melancholy
Temper, the last.

I dare no more trust any other hand to write this than (willingly) any but
your self, or some such good friends to read it.

Which is the reason it appears no fairer to your view. And it treads too
near* the heels of truth, and these Times, to appear in public.

If you shall please to accept of it, as worthy to cast a glance upon at your
idle, or melancholy hours, I have my full desires. If cast from you, it has
just Deserts.

Mine ambition only is, that so Noble a Lady shall be the God mother of the
first and only heir, that ever shall come of this quality, from

Your Ladyships most humble Servant. A. W.

THE Court of King James: OR, A general Discourse of some secret passages in
State, since the death of that ever glorious Queen Elizabeth, until this
present.
By the Authors own observation, who was either an eye, or ear witness, or
from such as were actors in them, from their own Relation.
Upon the Twenty fourth of March, 1602. did set the most glorious Sun that ever
shined in our Firmament of England (the never to be forgotten Queen Elizabeth,
Q. E. death*
of happy memory) about three in the morning, at her Manor of Richmond; not
only to the unspeakable grief of her Servants in particular, but of all her
Subjects in general.

And although many of her Courtiers adored that rising Sun appearing in the
North, yet since, not without regret of their monstrous ingratitude to her
(that Sun) now set, and in peace:

For no sooner was that Sun set* but Sir Robert Carew (Her near Kinsman, and
whose Family, and himself, she had raised from the degree of a mean Gentleman,
to high Honor, in title and place) most ingratefully did catch at Her last
breath, to carry it to the rising Sun then in Scotland, notwithstanding a
strict Charge laid to keep fast all the Gates, yet (his Father being Lord
Chamberlain) he by that means found favor to get out, to carry the first
news; which although it obtained for him the Governourship of the Duke of
York, yet has set so wide a mark of ingratitude on him, that it will remain
to Posterity a greater blot, then the honor he obtained afterward will ever
wipe out.

About nine in the morning of that day, was proclaimed King James of blessed
memory, K. James proclaimed King.
by the name of James the first; and now nothing on all hands, but preparations
for accommodating him in his journey for England, many posting into Scotland
for preferment, either by indearing themselves by some merit of their own to
the King, or by purchasing friends with their purses (Gold and Silver being a
precious commodity in that Climate, and would procure any thing) and did
procure Suits, Honors, and Offices to any that first came; of all which the
King afterward extended his bounty in so large and ample a manner, as procured
his own impoverishment, to the pressure of his Subjects, so far as set some
distance between him and them, which his wisdom, and King-craft, could easily
at all times reconcile.

The first that came from the King to the Lords in England, to give order for
all things necessary for the expediting his journey toward England, was Sir
Roger Aston an Englishman borne, Sir Roger Aston K. James his Barber.
but had his breeding wholly in Scotland, and had served the King many years
as his Barber, an honest and free-hearted man, and of an ancient Family in
Cheshire, but of no breeding answerable to his birth; yet he was the only man
ever employed, as a Messenger from the King to Queen Elizabeth, as a Letter
carrier only, which expressed their own intentions without any help from him
(besides the delivery) but even in that capacity was in very good esteem with
her Majesty, and received very royal rewards, which did enrich him, and gave
him a better Revenue then most Gentlemen in Scotland; for the Queen did find
him as faithful to Her as to his Master, in which he showed much wisdom,
though of no breeding. In this his employment I must not pass over one pretty
passage, I have heard himself relate; That he did never come to deliver any
Letters from his Master, but ever he was placed in the Lobby; the Hangings
being turned him, where he might see the Queen dancing to a little Fiddle,
which was to no other end, then that he should tell his Master, by her
youthful disposition, how likely he was to come to the possession of the
Crown he so much thirsted after; for you must understand, the wisest in that
Kingdom did believe the King should never enjoy this Crown, as long as there
was an old Wife in England, which they did believe we ever set up, as the other
was dead.

Sir Roger Aston presenting himself before the Council; being but a plain
untutored man, being asked how he did, and courted by all the Lords, lighted
upon this happy reply; Even my Lords, like a poor man, wandering above forty
years in a Wilderness, and barren Soil, am now arrived at the Land of
Promise. After made gentleman of the Bedchamber, etc
This man was afterward made Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Master of the
Wardrobe, and invested with such Honors, and Offices as he was capable of, and
that enabled him to live in a noble way, during his life, and to leave his
Daughters great Fortunes; but had you seen how the Lords did vye courtesies to
this poor Gentleman, striving who should ingrosse that Commodity by the
largest bounty; you could not but have condemned them of much baseness
(especially, seeing when at this time Offices, and great places of Honor will
not be accepted from that Son) that the very Barber of whose Father was so
much courted, but to speak a good word in their behalfes Surely the times are
much altered.

And now all preparation was made to meet the King in York, that he might in
that Northern Metropolis appear like a King of England, and take that State on
him there, which was not known in Scotland; There met him all the Lords of the
Council, and there did they all make Court to the Scotch-men that were most in
favor with the King, and there did the Scotch Courtiers lay the first
foundation of their English Fortunes; the chief of them was Sir George Hewme,
Sir Georg^ Hewme a kind of Favourit^
a kind of Favorite, but not such as after appeared with young Faces, and
smooth Chins, but one that for his wisdom and gravity, had been in some
secret Councels with his Master, which created that dearnesse between them; and
the chief of those secrets, was that of Gowries Conspiracy, though that Nation
gave little credit to the Story, but would speak both slightly and
despitefully of it, and those of the wisest of that Nation; yet there was a
weekly commemoration by the Tuesday Sermon, and an anniversary Feast, as great
as it was possible, for the Kings preservation, ever on the fifth of August;
upon which day as Sir John Ramsey after E. of Holdernesse, for his good service
in that preservation, was the principal guest, so did the King grant him any
Boon he would ask that day; but had such limitations set to his asking, as
made his suit as unprofitable unto him, as that he asked it for, was
unserviceable to the King, and indeed did make the English believe as little
the truth of that story, as the Scots themselves did, and yet on my conscience
the good Gentleman did in that as a Liar often does, by telling a Lie often,
believes it to be a very truth; but the truth was, (although he was not a man
capable of much himself) yet had it been true; there was too little done for
him, being* not true, too much; for, being an Earl, he was in very little
esteem, either with his Master, or with the better sort of Courtiers. And I
pray God that the effects of those Sermons in the Fathers time for that
service, cause no ill effects, or be not one cause of Gods anger toward us in
the Sons reign.

This Sir George Hewme being the only man that was the Guider of the King, and
his affairs, all the wiser sort of English made their addresses unto him,
amongst those Sir Robert Cicill, Sir Robert Cicill a favorite.
a very wise man, but much hated in England, by reason of the fresh bleeding of
that universally beloved Earl of Essex, and for that, was clouded also in the
Kings favor; he came to York, but lay close, unseen, or scarce known to be
in the City, until he knew what entertainment he should receive from the King;
for he was in his own, and all men's opinions, so under the Hatches, as not
ever to appear above board again (nor did any of the Countre-faction to Essex
besides himself, ever attain to the Kings favor;) but those friends raised
by his wit, and purse, did so cooperate (of which Sir Roger Aston, that plain
man was principal, for which he lost not his labor) that Sir George Hewme,
and Sir Robert Cicill had many secret meetings, and did so comply, that Sir
Robert Cicill, to the admiration of all, did appear, and come out of his
Chamber like a Giant, to run his race, for Honor, and Fortune, and who in such
dearnesse, and privacy with the King as Sir Robert Cicill! as if he had been
his faithful Servant many years before; yet did not either his Friends, wit,
or wealth, raise him so much (as some believe) as the ill offices done by him
to this Nation, in discovering the nature of the people, and showing the King
the way, how to enhance his Prerogative so above the Laws, that he might
inslave the Nation, which though it took well then, yet it has been of sad and
dangerous consequence in after times:

For first, He caused a whole Cartload of Parliament Presidents (that spoke the
Subjects Liberty) to be burnt:

Next, raising two hundred thousand pound for making two hundred Baronets,
telling the King he should find his English Subjects like Asses, on whom he
might lay any burden, and should need neither Bit, nor Bridle, but their Asses
ears; And when the King said, It would discontent the generality of the
Gentry: He replied, Tush Sir, you want the money, that will do you good, the
Honor will do them very little; And by these courses he raised himself,
friends, and family, to Offices, Honors, and great Possessions; Yet as a
punishment, he lived long enough to have lost all, had not Death prevented him
between the Bath and London: For the Duke of Bullion being then here, (about
the overture of that unfortunate Match between the Palsgrave, and the Lady
Elizabeth) had so done his errand, and discovered his juggling; It is most
certain, he had been stripped of all at his return, which he well understanding
from his Friends at Court, did expedite his end; but he dyed opportunely to
save his honor, and his estate for his posterity, though to leave a mark of
ignominy on himself by that Herodian disease, and that for all his great
Honors, and Possessions, and stately Houses, he found no place but the top of
a Molehill, near Marleborough to end his miserable life; so that it may be
said of him, and truly, he dyed of a most loathsome disease, and remarkable,
without house, without pity, without the favor of that Master that had raised
him to so high an estate; and yet must he have this right done him (which is
also a note of the misfortune of our times) there has not been any since his
time that equalled him, to fulfill the Proverb, Seldom comes a better; he had
great parts, was very wise, full of honor, and bounty, a great lover and
rewarder of Virtue, and able parts in others; so they did not appear too high
in place, or look too narrowly into his actions.

The next that came on the public Theater in favor, was Henry Howard, a
younger Son of the Duke of Norfolk, and Lord Thomas Howard, the one after
Earl of Northampton* the other Earl of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain, and after
Lord Treasurer, who by Salisburies greatness with that Family, rather then by
any merit, or wisdom in themselves, raised many great Families of his
Children: Northampton though a great Clerk, yet not a wise man, but the
grossest Flatterer of the World; and as Salisbury by his Wit, so this by his
Flattery, raised himself; yet one great motive to the raising all of that Name
of Howards was, the Duke of Norfolk, suffering for the Queen of Scots, the
Kings Mother, yet did Suffolk so far get the start of Northampton, that
Northampton never after loved him but from the teeth outward, only had so much
discretion as not to fall to actual enmity, to the overthrow of both, and the
weakening that faction; Suffolk also using him with all submissive respect, not
for any love, but hope of gaining his great estate, and sharing it amongst his
Children; but Northamptons distaste was such, by his loss of the Treasurers
place, which he had with such assurance promised to himself in his thoughts,
that except what he gave to Master Henry Howard, the rest he gave to the Earl
of Arundell, who by his observance, but more especially by giving Northampton
all his Estate if he never returned from travel, had wrought himself so far
into his affections, that he doted on him.

And now the principal managers of the English affairs were Salisbury,
Suffolk, Northampton, Buckhurst, Egerton Lord Keeper, Worcester, and the Old
Admiral; For the Scots, Sir George Hewme, now Earl of Dunbar, Secretary
Elfeston, after Earl of Balmerino, and as wise a man as was in England, or
Scotland, the Lord of Kinlosse, a very honest, but weak man.

You are now to observe, that Salisbury had shaken off all that were great with
him, and of his Faction in Queen Elizabeth's days, as Sir Walter Rawleigh, Sir
George Carew, the Lord Gray, the Lord Cobham: the three first, very able men as
the world had, the last, but one degree from a fool, yet served their turns
better then a wiser man, by his greatness with the Queen, for they would put
him on any thing, and make him tell any Lie, with as great confidence as a
truth. Three of these were utterly ruined, as you shall hear in the following
Discourse, the fourth being a very wise man, contented himself with a mean
place, that was worthy of a much greater; and although very active formerly,
called to mind this saying: Foelix quem faciunt, etc. and meddled with no State
business, his wisdom foretelling his Fate, if he had done otherwise; for he
did see one better head-peece then his own, sit tottering at that time, and
fell off afterward, which made him think it was good sleeping in a whole skin.

The King no sooner came to London, but notice was taken of a rising Favorite,
the first Meteor of that nature appearing in our climate; as the King cast his
eye upon him for affection, so did all the Courtiers, Mr. James Hay a Favorite.
to adore him, his name was Mr. James Hay, a Gentleman that lived long in
France, and some say, of the Scottish Guard to that King; this Gentleman
coming over to meet the King, and share with him in his new Conquest
(according to the Scots phrase) it should seem had some former acquaintance
with the then Leiger Ambassador in Scotland for the French King, His rise.
who coming with his Majesty into England, presented this Gentleman (as a well
accomplished Gentleman) to the King, in such an high commendation as engendered
a liking that produced a favorite; in thankful acknowledgement whereof, he
did him many fair offices for the present, and coming afterward an
extraordinary Ambassador to our King, made him the most sumptuous Feast at
Essex house, His sumptuous feast.
that ever was seen before, never equalled since, in which was such plenty
(and Fish of that immensity, brought out of Muscovia, that Dishes were made to
contain them (no Dishes in all England before could near hold them) and after
that, a costly Voydee, and after that, a Mask of choice Noblemen; and
Gentlemen, and after that, a most costly and magnificent Banquet, the King,
Lords, and all the prime Gentlemen then about London being invited thither.
Truly, he was a most complete, His accomplishment.
and well accomplished Gentleman, modest, and Courtlike, and of so fair a
demeanor, as made him be generally beloved; and for his wisdom, I shall give
you but one character for all: He was ever great with all the Favorites of
his time, and although the King did often change, yet he was semper idem with
the King, and Favorites, and got by both; for although Favorites had that
exorbitant power over the King, to make him grace, and disgrace whom they
pleased; yet he was out of their power, and the only exception to that general
rule; and for his gettings, it was more then almost all the Favorites of his
time, which appeared in those vast expenses of all sorts, and had not the
bounty of his mind exceeded his gettings, he might have left the greatest
estate that ever our age or climate had heard of; he was indeed made for a
Courtier, who wholly studied his Master, and understood him better then any
other.

He was employed in very many of the most weighty Affairs, and sent with the
most stately Embassies of our times, which he performed with that wisdom, and
magnificence, that he seemed an honor to his King and Country. For his
carriage in State-affaires, he was termed by some Princes the Kings Juggler. He
married the Daughter and Heir of the Lord Denny, after the Earl of
Northumberlands daughter, and was hated of none that ever I heard of, but the
Earl of Northampton, who had no patience to see him, being himself of so
venomous and cankred a disposition, that indeed he hated all men of noble
parts, nor loved any but Flatterers like himself; yet it was a great question,
whether he hated the Earl of Carlisle, or Sir Robert Mansell most, by whom he
has been heard to say; Body of God, I will be content to be damned perpetually
in Hell, to be revenged of that proud Welshman; and did so hate him, that he
kept an Inquisition on him seven years, to prove that he had cousened the King
of fourteen thousand pounds, which at the seven years end at an hearing before
the King, the Lords, the Queen, and all the Ladies being present, with all the
gallantry of the Court, ended in one pair of silk Stockins, given by one for
a New-yeares Gift to Master Wels, Sir Robert Mansells Servant; at which, the
King stood up and swear very deeply; Do you believe I will take a pair of
silk Stockins for my fourteen thousand pounds? give me that, give me that; is
this all the fruit of seven years Commission? at which words Sir Robert
Mansell kneeled down, and said, I will now Sir take all the faults they can
charge my servant with, upon my self; at which the King was very angry, that
so noble a Gentleman, who had so well acquitted himself, and Honor, should
entrust it in the keeping of a Servant; at the end of all, the Earl of
Salisbury kneeled down, and said; Sir, if you will suffer malice so far to
prevail, as to have your honest Servants traduced, to satisfy the humors of
any, I beseech you take my staff, for were my self, and the Earl of Worcester
here present, put in the balance against Sir Robert Mansell, we should prove
too light; I am in a great Place, and cannot say, but by my self, or servants,
I may fail, yet not with our own wills; therefore Sir, if you will suffer such
inquisitions, there will be no serving your Majesty, in such places as I hold,
by your Majesty's favor; thus ended the Earl of Northamptons malice, which
only served to honor Sir Robert Mansell, and make a scorn of himself, and
this only to make the venom of this Monster appear, who did flatter the King,
and dissemble with God.

And now begin Ambassadors to appear from diverse Princes, the principal
were, Roney Duke of Sullice, from the French King; the Constable of Castile
from the Spanish King, the Count Arremberg from the Arch Duke; the former came
to congratulate only, and desired the confirmation of the ancient amity betwixt
the two Crowns; the latter two about the establishing a firm peace betwixt
these two Kingdoms, that had lived in perpetual War, and hatred of each
other, by which it might appear where the advantage of such a peace would
fall, by those that sought, or rather bought it with an infinite mass of
treasure, prodigally cast about the English Court.

To bring these Ambassadors over, were appointed Sir Robert Mansell, being
Admiral of the narrow Seas, and Sir Jerome Turner his Vice Admiral, the first
commanded to attend at Graveling for the Spanish Ambassador, the latter at
Calis for the French; but the French coming first, and hearing the
Vice Admiral was to attend him, the Admiral the other; in a scorn put
himself in a Passage-boat of Calis, came forth with flagge in top; instantly
Sir Jerome Turner sent to know of the Admiral what he should do; Sir Robert
Mansell sent him word, to shoot, and sink him, if he would not take in the
flag; this as it made the flag be pulled in, so a great complaint, and 'twas
believed it would have undone Sir Robert Mansell, the French Faction pressing
it so home: but he maintained the act, and was the better beloved of his Master
ever after, to his dying day.

This makes it appear how jealous old Commanders were of their own honor,
and of their Masters, and Kingdoms honors, which since has been so
prodigally wasted, as we are utterly bankerupt, having spent our old Stock, and
have not bravery enough to erect a new.

The Constable of Castile so plied his Masters business (in which he spared
for no cost) that he procured a peace so advantageous for Spain, and so
disadvantageous for England, that it and all Christendom have since both seen
and felt the lamentable effects thereof. There was not one Courtier of note,
that tasted not of Spaines bounty, either in Gold, or Jewels and among them,
not any in so large a proportion as the Countess of Suffolk, who shared in
her Lords interest, being then a potent man, and in that interest which she
had, in being Mistress to that little great Secretary (little in body and
stature, but great in wit and policy) the sole manager of State affairs; so it
may be said, she was a double sharer, and in truth Audley-end, that famous and
great structure, had its foundation of Spanish Gold.

The King was a peaceable and merciful Prince; yet God (for some secret intent
best known to himself) laid the foundation of his reign, with the greatest
mortality ever before heard of in this Kingdom, by a fearful Plague, A great
Plague.
and some by that judged what his future reign would be, yet their wisdoms
failed, for he was a King of mercy as well as peace, never cruel, yet surely
it had some moral.

He was forced by that contagion to leave the Metropolis, and go into a by
corner in Wiltshire, Wilton the Earl of Pembrookes House, in which time of his
abode there, a kind of Treason brake forth, but what it was, as no man could
then tell, so it is left with so dark a Comment, that posterity will never
understand the Text, or remember any such treason; it is true, some lost their
lives, yet the world was never satisfied of the justice, and one of them, (and
that the only mark of Tyranny upon this good Kings reign) executed many
years after without all president, and on my conscience without any just
cause, and even against that good Kings will, who in many things was overawed
by his timorous disposition.

But the Spanish Faction, and Spanish Gold betrayed his life, as they had done
the Kingdom before, and I believe it was one of the greatest Master-peeces of
that Ambassador, to purchase Rawleighs head, yet had not Bristol co-operated,
the King would never have consented, and it may be he had his secret ends,
fearing his wisdom might once again have raised him, to have looked over
Sherborne Castle, once his own, and how unjustly taken from him God will one
day judge; I know not whether there be a curse on those that are owners of it,
as Fables report, but I am confident there is a curse on Bristol for taking
away his life; I will not take upon me too far to pry into God's Ark, yet
what is like to befall him, and has already, his Son (as hopeful a Gentleman
as any in the Kingdom) may give some token of Gods anger against him and his
family.

But because I will not leave you altogether blinde-folded, A narration of the
Treason charged on Rawleigh.
I shall as near as I can lead you to the discovery of this Treason, which
consisted of Protestants, Puritans, Papists, and of an Atheist: a strange
medley you will say, to meet in one and the same Treason, and keep counsel,
which surely they did, because they knew not of any; the Protestants were the
Lord Cobham, and George Brook his Brother, the one very learned and wise, the
other a most silly Lord, the Puritan the Lord Gray of Wilton, a very hopeful
Gentleman, blasted in the very Bud; the Papists Watson, and Clarke, Priests;
and Parham a Gentleman, the Atheist Sir Walter Rawleigh, then generally so
believed, though after brought by affliction (the best School-Mistris) to be,
and so dyed, a most religious Gentleman. This Treason was compounded of strange
ingredients (and more strange then true) it was very true, most of these were
discontented, to see Salisbury their old friend so high, to trample on them,
that before had been his chief supporters, and (being ever of his faction) now
neglected and contemned: it was then believed an errand trick of State to
overthrow some, and disable others, knowing their strong abilities might
otherwise live to overthrow Salisbury, for they were intimate in all his
secret Councels for the ruin of Essex, especially Rawleigh, Gray, and Cobham;
though the latter was a fool, yet had been very useful to them (as the Tool
in the hand of the Workman) and to have singled out these without some Priests,
which were Traitors by the Law, had smelt too rank, and appeared too poor and
plain a trick of State; and Salisbury in this had a double benefit: First, in
ridding himself of such as he feared would have been thorns in his sides.
Secondly, by endearing himself to the King, by showing his diligence, and
vigilance for his safety; so that it might be said of him as of Caesar in
another case ( Inveniam aut saciam) I will either find out a Treason or make
one, and this had been a pretty trick had it been only to disgrace, without
taking away life; but how this piece of policy may stand with Religion, I fear
by this time he too well understands; and this plot as near as I can tell you
(and I dare say my intelligence gave me as near a guess as ever any man had)
was, that all these in a discontented humor had by Watson, and Clarke, being
Confessors, dealt with Count Aremberge, the Arch Dukes Ambassador, to
negotiate with the Arch Duke to raise an Army, and invade England, and they
would raise another of Papists, and Malcontents to join: for you must
understand the King was believed an errand Puritan, ( Cujus contrarium verum
est) how likely this Plot was, let the world judge, that the King of Spain,
who had bought peace at so dear a rate, and found it so advantageous to him,
by the lamentable experience he had formerly in the Wars with this formidable
State, should seek to break it so soon: and had it been a real Treason, the
State had been bound to have rewarded these Traitors, as the best piece of
service done in England all that Kings reign (it was indeed those that made
the Peace, not those that endeavored the breaking of it, were the Traitors,
and are to be cursed by all Posterity) yet this foolish Plot served well enough
to take some blocks out of the way, that might afterward have made some of them
stumble, to the breaking of their own necks.

They were all Arraigned of Treason at Winchester, whither the King having sent
some secretly to observe all passages, upon whose true and faithful relations
of the innocencies of the Persons Arraigned, and the slight proofs, upon
which they were condemned: he would not be drawn to sign any Warrant for the
execution of Rawleigh, Cobham, and Gray, very hardly for any of the rest, the
two Priests excepted.

For Rawleighs defense, it was so brave and just, as (had he not wilfully cast
himself, out of very weariness, as unwilling to detain the company longer)
no Jury could ever have cast him; all the Evidence brought against him was
Cobhams Accusation, which he only desired might appear ( viva voce) and he
would yield without further defense, but that they knew full well Cobham would
not, nor could not accuse him, having been tampered with by Wade, then
Lieutenant of the Tower, and Salisburies great Creature; Wade desired it under
his hand, that also he refused, at last Wade got a trick by his cunning, to
surprise Cobhams weakness, to get him write his name to a Blank, to which,
Wade, no question, wrote the accusation, as will appear hereafter; for
Salisbury urging Rawleigh often, if Cobham had accused him under his hand,
would he then yield? Rawleigh replied, He knew Cobham weak of judgment, and
did not know how that weakness might be wrought upon, but was confident he
would not to his face accuse him, and therefore would not put his life,
fortune, and all on that; at which fence he stood til nine at night: at last
his fate carried him against his reason, and he yielded upon the producing his
hand, which was instantly pulled out, and was in truth his hand, but not his
act, or deed: so at that present was George Brook, Watson, and Clarke
executed, Parham acquitted, and Sir Walter Rawleigh executed many years after
for the same treason, as much against all justice, as beyond all reason, or any
president: yea after he had been a General by the Kings Commission, and had by
that, power of the Lives of many others, utterly against the Civil Law, which
says, He that has power of the Lives of others, ought to be Master of his
own. But the Spaniard was so powerful at that time in Court, as that Faction
could command the life of any man that might prove dangerous to his designs;
Gray and Cobham dyed in their restraint, the one much pitied, the other
scorned, and his death as base, for he dyed lousie for want of Apparel, and
Linen; and had starved, had not a Trencher-scraper, sometime his Servant in
Court, releived him with scraps, in whose house he dyed, being so poor a house
as he was forced to creep up a Ladder into a little hole to his Chamber; which
was a strange judgment, and unpresidented, that a man of seven thousand pounds
per annum, and of a personal estate of thirty thousand pounds, of all which
the King was so cheated of what should have Escheated to him, that he could not
give him any maintenance, as in all cases the King does, unless out of his
own Revenue of the Crown, which was the occasion of this Lords want, (his Wife
being very rich, would not give him the crumbs that fell from her Table;) and
this was a just judgment of God on him.

And now, because it will be pertinent in this place to let you understand,
that Rawleigh had his life surrepticiously taken away, I shall give you a true
story.

Queen Anne, that brave Princess, was in a desperate (and some believed an
incurable) Disease, whereof the Physicians were at the furthest end of their
studies to find the cause, at a Nonplus for the Cure; Sir Walter Rawleigh,
being by his long studies an admirable Chemist, undertook, and performed the
Cure, for which he would receive no other reward, but that her Majesty would
procure that certain Lords might be sent to examine Cobham, whether he had
accused Sir Walter Rawleigh of Treason at any time under his hand; the King, at
the Queens request (and in Justice could do no less) sends six Lords, (which
I take were, the Duke of Leonox, Salisbury, Worcester, Suffolk, Sir George
Carew, and Sir Julius Caesar) to demand of Cobham, whether he had not under his
hand accused Sir Walter Rawleigh at Winchester, upon that Treason he was
Arraigned for; Cobham did protest, never, nor could he; but, said he, That
Villain Wade did often solicit me, and not prevailing that way, got me by a
trick to write my name upon a piece of white Paper; which I, thinking nothing,
did, so that if any Charge came under my hand, it was forged by that Villain
Wade, by writing something above my hand without my consent or knowledge. These
six returning to the King, the rest made Salisbury their Spokes-man, who said,
Sir, my Lord Cobham has made good all that ever he wrote, or said. Where it
is to be noted, that this was but an equivocating trick in Salisbury; for it
was true, that Cobham had made good whatever he had writ (that being but in
truth to very nothing) but never wrote he any thing to accuse Rawleigh; by
which you may see the baseness of these Lords, the credulity of the King, and
the ruin of Sir Walter Rawleigh. I appeal now to the judgment of all the
world, whether these six Lords were not the immediate Murderers of Sir Walter
Rawleigh, and no question shall be called to a sad account for it.

And thus have you a true relation of the Treason, and Traitors, with all the
windings and turnings in it, and all passages appertaining to it; and by it you
may see the slavery these great men were inslaved in by Salisbury, that none
durst testify such a truth, as the not testifying, lost their most precious
Souls.

And now does the King return to Windsor, where there was only an apparition
of Southamptons being a Favorite to his Majesty, by that privacy and dearnesse
was presented to the Court-view; but Salisbury (liking not that any of Essex
his faction should come into play) made that apparition appear as it were in
transitu, and so vanished, by putting some jealousies into the Kings head, who
was so far from jealousy, that he did not much desire to be in his Queens
company, yet love and regality must admit of no partnership.

Then was there in requital of the Spanish Ambassadors, two stately Embassies
addressed, the one to Spain, the other to the Arch Duke, to have that peace
they so dearly purchased confirmed, and sworn to by ours, as formerly by them;
the old Lord Admiral was sent to Spain, the Earl of Hartford for Bruxels,
that the Duke of Leonox might have the better opportunity. The Spaniard was
astonished at the bravenesse of our Embassy, and the handsome Gentlemen (in both
which, few Embassies ever equalled this) for you must understand the Jesuits
reported our Nation to be ugly, and like Devils, as a punishment sent to our
Nation for casting off the Popes supremacy; and they pictured Sir Francis Drake
generally half a Man, half a Dragon; When they beheld them after the shape of
Angels, they could not well tell whether to trust their own eyes, or their
Confessors reports, yet they then appeared to them, as to all the world,
monstrous Liars.

The Ambassador had his reception with as much state, as his entertainment
with bounty, the King defraying all charges, and they were detained at their
Landing longer then ordinary, to have provisions prepared in their passage to
Madrid, with all the bounty was possible, to make the whole Country appear a
Land of Canaan, which was in truth, but a Wilderness.

In their abode there, although they gave them Roast-meat, yet they beat them
with the spits, by reporting that the English did steal all the Plate, when in
truth it was themselves, who thought to make Hay while the Sun shined, not
thinking ever more to come to such a Feast, to fill their purses as well as
their bellyes* (for food and coin are equally alike scarce with that Nation)
this report passed for current, to the infinite dishonor of our Nation, there
being at that time the prime gallantry of our Nation.

Sir Robert Mansell, who was a man borne to vindicate the Honor of his Nation,
as of his own, being Vice Admiral, and a man on whom the old Admiral wholly
relied, having dispatched the Ships to be gone the next morning, came in very
late to Supper; Sir Richard Levison sitting at the upper end of the Table
amongst the Grandees, the Admiral himself not supping that night, being upon
the dispatch of Letters, the Table upon Sir Robert Mansells entrance offered to
rise, to give him place: But he sat down instantly at the lower end, and would
not let any man stir, and falling to his meat, did espy a Spaniard, as the
Dishes emptied, ever putting some in his bosom, some in his breeches, that
they both strutted: Sir Robert Mansell sent a Message to the upper end of the
table to Sir Richard Levison to be delivered in his ear, that whatsoever he
saw him do, he should desire the Gentlemen and Grandees to sit quiet, for
there should be no cause of any disquiet; on the sudden, Sir Robert Mansell
steps up, takes this Spaniard in his arms, (at which the table began to rise;
Sir Richard Levison quiets them,) brings him up to the end amongst the
Grandees, then pulls out the Plate from his bosom, breeches, and every part
about him, which did so amaze the Spaniard, and vindicate that aspersion cast
on our Nation, that never after was there any such syllable heard, but all
honor done to the Nation, and all thanks to him in particular.

From thence, next day they went for Madrid, where all the royal entertainment
Spain could yield was given them, and at the end of the Grand entertainment and
Revells, which held most part of the night, as they were all returning to their
Lodgings, the street being made light by white Wax lights, and the very night
forced into a day, by shining light, as they were passing in the street, a
Spaniard catches off Sir Robert Mansells Hat, with a very rich jewel in it,
and away he flies; Sir Robert not being of a spirit to have any thing violently
taken from him, nor of such a Court-like complement, to part with a jewel of
that price, to one no better acquainted with him, hurls open the Boot,
follows after the fellow, and some three Gentlemen did follow him, to secure
him, houseth the Fellow in the house of an Allagozy, which is a great Officer,
or Judge in Spain; this Officer wondering at the manner of their coming, the
one without his hat and sword in his hand, the other with all their swords;
Demands the cause, They tell him; He says, surely none can think his house a
sanctuary, who is to punish such offenders.

But Sir Robert Mansell would not be so put off with his Spanish gravity, but
enters the House, leaving two at the Gate, to see that none should come out
whiles he searched; A long while they could find nothing, and the Allagozy
urging this as an affront, at last, looking down into a Well of a small depth,
he saw the fellow stand up to the neck in Water: Sir Robert Mansell seized on
his Hat, and Jewel, leaving the fellow to the Allagozy, but he had much rather
have fingered the Jewel, and in his gravity told Sir Robert Mansell, he could
not have it without form of Law, which Sir Robert dispensed with, carrying
away his Hat, and Jewel, and never heard further of the business; now the
truth was, this fellow knew his Borough well enough, as well as some Thieves
of our Nation, after they have done a Robbery, would put themselves into a
Prison of their acquaintance, assuring themselves none would search there, or
rather as our Recorders of London, whose chief revenue for themselves, and
servants, is from Thieves, Whores, and Bawds, therefore this story cannot seem
strange in England.

The other Ambassador sent to the Arch Duke, was, the old Earl of Hertford,
who was conveyed over in one of the Kings Ships, by Sir William Munson, in
whose passage a Dutch Man of War coming by that ship, would not veil, as
the manner was, acknowledging by that, our Sovereignty over the Sea, Sir
William Munson gave him a shot to instruct him in manners, but instead of
learning, he taught him by returning another, he acknowledged no such
Sovereignty; this was the very first indignity and affront ever offered to the
Royal Ships of England, which since have been most frequent; Sir William
Monson desired my Lord of Hertford to go into the Hold, and he would instruct
him by stripes, that refused to be taught by fair means; but the Earl charged
him on his Allegiance first to land him, on whom he was appointed to attend; so
to his great regret, he was forced to endure that indignity, for which I have
often heard him wish he had been hanged, rather then live that unfortunate
Commander of a Kings Ship, to be Chronicled for the first that ever endured
that affront, although it was not in his power to have helped it; yet by his
favor, it appeared but a copy of his countenance, for it had been but
hazarding hanging to have disobeyed my Lords Commandment, and it had been
infinite odds he had not been hanged, having to friend him, the House of
Suffolk; nor would he have been so sensible of it, had he not been of the
Spanish Faction, and that a Dutch ship.

Now did those great Mannagers of the State (of which Salisbury was chief)
after they had packed the Cards begin to deal the government of the Kingdom
amongst themselves, and persuaded the King to leave the State affairs to them,
and to betake himself to some Country recreations, which they found him
addicted unto, for the City, and business, did not agree with him; to that end
purchased, built, and repaired at New Market, and Royston, and this pleased the
Kings humor well, rather that he might enjoy his Favorite with more privacy,
then that he loved the sports; then must Theobolds be in his own possession,
as not fit for a King to be beholding to a Subject for an House of daily use,
but because the King had so much want of moneys (to express his love, and
bounty to his Native Nation) Salisbury would exchange, and take Land for his
House, and Park; in which exchange, he made such an advantage, that he sold
his House for fifty years purchase, and that so cunningly, as hardly to be
discerned, but by a curious sight, for he fleeted off the Cream of the Kings
Mannours in many Counties, not any two lying in any one County, and made choice
of the most in the remotest Counties, only built his nest at Hatfield, within
the County where his Father had built his, yet kept he still the house of
Theobolds, for he and his posterity were to be perpetual Keepers of that
House, and many Parkes adjacent; by this he not only showed his wisdom for
his own benefit, but to the world what the Kings natural disposition was, to
be easily abused, and would take counterfeit Coin for current payment.

And to fit the Kings humor, and dissolve him in that delight he was most
addicted to, as well as to serve Salisburies own ends, and satisfy his
revenge upon some neighbor Gentlemen, that formerly would not sell him some
convenient parcels of Land neighboring on Theobalds, he puts the King on
enlarging the Park, walling, and storing it with red Dear; and I dare
affirm, with that work the King was so well pleased, and did more glory in,
then his Predecessors did in the conquest of France; and as it was most true,
so an ill Omen, that the King loved Beasts better then Men, and took more
delight in them, and was more tender over the life of a Stag then of a Man; yet
this was the weakness of his judgment, and poorness of his Spirit, rather
then any innate cruelty, for he was not naturally cruel over lives, though in
displacing Officers, which naturally he did believe, was as glorious, as to
overthrow, and conquer Kings.

But yet for all their setting their Cards, and playing their Games to their
own advantages, of getting much for themselves, and friends, there was one
Knave in the Pack, would cross their designs, and Trump in their way, if he
might not share with them in their winning; that was one Lake, a Clerk of the
Signet, after, Secretary, and after that turned out in disgrace; and in truth,
was only wise in the worlds opinion, could swim being held up by the chin; but
at his fall all his weaknesses were discovered: and that the world had been
deceived in him, I will instance in one particular amongst many, that shall
give you full assurance; being in disgrace, he gave two thousand pounds but to
kiss the Kings hand, believing that after that, he might have access as
formerly; after he had paid his money, he was never suffered to see the King
more, only jeered at by all the Court for his folly, and went sneaking up and
down contemned of all men.

This Lake was a fellow of mean birth, and meaner breeding, being an under
Servant to make Fires in Secretary Walsinghams chamber, and there got some
experience, which afterward in the Kings time made him appear an able man,
which in the Queens time, when there was none in Court but men of eminencies,
made him an inconsiderable Fellow. He had linked himself in with the Scottish
Nation, progging for Suits, and helping them to fill their Purses; as they did
believe, there was not so able a man in the Kingdom (for in truth ever since
Queen Elizabeth's death, the raising money has been the only way to raise men,
as being held the essential property of a wise man, to know how to bring in
money ( per fas aut nefas) and amongst all the Scots, he wholly applied
himself to those of the Bedchamber, and of nearest access to his Majesty.

For his good service of abusing his Country, and Countrymen, he was made
Clerk of the Signet, to wait on the King in his Hunting journies, and in
these journies got all the Bills signed, even for the greatest Lords (all
Packets being addressed to him) so that even Salisbury; and Northampton, and
the greatest Lords made Court to him; by this means did he raise himself from
a mean to a great fortune, but so overawed by his Wife, that if he did not
what she commanded, she would beat him, and in truth his Wife was afterward
his overthrow; besides, he would tell Tales, and let the King know the
passages of Court, and great men, as who was Salisburies Mistress, and governed
all; who governed Northampton, and discovered their Bawdery, which did
infinitely please the Kings humor: and in truth had so much craft, as he
served his turn upon all, but was engrossed by none but by the Bedchamber,
who stuck so close to him, that they could not yet remove him. And now do the
English Faction (seeing they could not sever the Scots from him) endeavor to
raise a mutiny against the Scots that were his supporters, their Agents
divulging every where, the Scots would get all, and would beggar the Kingdom;
the Scots on the other side complain to the King, they were so poor, they
under-went the byword of beggarly Scots; to which the King returned this
answer (as he had a very ready wit) Content your selves, I will shortly make
the English as beggarly as you, and so end that controversy; this is as true
as he truly performed it, for however he enriched many in particular, as
Salisbury, Suffolk, Northampton, Worcester, Lake, etc. yet he did beggar
himself, and the Nation in general.

This also was inculcated into the ears of the Parliament, when that great
business about the union was in debate, which was much crossed by that
opinion; if they had already impoverished the kingdom, by the union, they
would bankerupt it. But since, you see by their own valor and bravery of
spirit, they have made us beg a reunion with them, and for ought we see, all
our happiness is derived from their favors.



They that then lived at Court, and were curious observers of every man's
actions, could have affirmed, that Salisbury, Suffolk, and Northampton, and
their friends did get more then the whole Nation of Scotland (Dunbar excepted)
for whatever others got, they spent here, only Dunbar laid a foundation of a
great Family, which did all revert into England again, with his Daughters
marriage with the House of Suffolk, so in truth, all the water run to their
Mills.

It is most true, that many Scots did get much, but not more with one hand,
then they spent with the other, witness the Earl of Kelly, Annandale, etc.
nay, that great Getter, the Earl of Carlisle also, and some private Gentlemen;
as Gideon Murrey, John Achmoty, James Baily, John Gib, and Bernard Lindley, got
some pretty estates, not worthy either the naming or envying, that old Servants
should get some moderate estates to leave to posterity.

But (...), and all the Scots in general, got scarce the Tithe of those
English Getters, that can be said did stick by them, or their posterity;
besides, Salisbury had one trick to get the kernel, and leave the Scots but
the shell, yet cast all the envy on them; He would make them buy Books of
Fee-farmes, some one hundred pounds per annum, some one hundred Marks, and he
would compound with them for a thousand pounds, which they were willing to
embrace, because they were sure to have them pass without any control, or
charge, and one thousand pounds appeared to them that never saw ten pounds
before, an inexhaustible treasure; then would Salisbury fill up this Book with
such prime Land, as should be worth ten or twenty thousand pounds, which was
easy for him, being Treasurer, so to do; and by this means Salisbury
enriched himself

infinitely, yet cast the envy on the Scots, in whose names these Books
appeared, and are still upon Record to all posterity; though Salisbury had the
Honey, they poor Gentlemen but part of the Wax; Dunbar only had his Agents,
and could play his own game, which they durst not cross; so was the poor
King and State cheated on all hands.

And now did a contention arise between the English and Scots, about the
election of a Favorite, out of whether Nation he should come; now was
Montgomery in the wane, being given more to his own pleasures, then to observe
the King, so that always the Earl of Carliste did invest him in his room; he
as soon by his neglective carriage did divest himself, yet was he ever in the
Kings good opinion, and one that he put more trust in at the time of his death,
then in all his other servants.

Then was there a young Gentleman, Mr. Carre his rise.
Master Robert Carre, who had his breeding in France, and was newly returned
from Travail, a Gentleman very handsome, and well bred, and one that was
observed to spend his time in serious studies, and did accompany himself with
none but men of such eminencies, as by whom he might be bettered; this
Gentleman, the Scots so wrought it, that they got him into a Grooms place of
the Bedchamber, and was very well pleasing to all; he did more then any other
Associate himself, with Sir Thomas Overbury, a man of excellent parts, (but
those made him proud, over-valuing himself, and under-valuing others, and was
infected with a kind of insolency) with this Gentleman spent he most of his
time, and drew the eyes of the Court, as well as the affection of his Master
upon him, yet very few, but such as were the curious observers of those times
could discern the drawing of the Kings affection* (...) upon a Coronation day,
riding in with the Lord Dingwell to the Tilt-yard, his horse fell with him, and
brake his leg, he was instantly carried into Master Riders house at
Charing-crosse, and the news as instantly carried to the King, having little
desire to behold the triumph, but much desired to have it ended, and no sooner
ended, but the King went instantly to visit him, and after by his daily
visiting, and mourning over him, taking all care for his speedy recovery, made
the daybreake of his glory appear, every Courtier now concluding him, actually
a favorite.

Lord! how the great men flocked then to see him, and to offer to his Shrine in
such abundance, that the King was forced to lay a restraint, least it might
retard his recovery by spending his spirits; and to facilitate the cure, care
was taken for a choice Diet for himself, and Chirurgions, with his Attendants,
and no sooner recovered but a proclaimed Favorite.

Then the English Lords, who formerly coveted an English Favorite (and to that
end the Countess of Suffolk did look out choice young men, whom she daily
curled, and perfuming their breaths) left all hope, and she her curling and
perfuming, all adoring this rising Sun, every man striving to invest himself
into this man's favor (not sparing for bounty nor flattery) which was not hard
to be obtained, being naturally more addicted to the English then to the
Scotch, in so much that he endeavored to forget his native Country, and his
Fathers house, having none of note about him but English, and but one besides
English, in any familiarity with him, which was Sir Robert Carre his Kins-man;
but above all, was Sir Thomas Overbury his Pythias. Then was the strife between
Salisbury and Suffolk, who shonld ingrosse him, and make him their Monopoly;
each presenting, proffering, and accumulating favors upon Overburyes Kindred,
the Father made a Judge in Wales, and himself offered Offices; but Overbury,
naturally of an insolent spirit, which was elevated by being so intimate with a
Favorite, and wholly having engrossed that commodity, which could not be
retayled, but by him and his favor; with a kind of scorn neglected their
friendships, yet made use of both.

Now was Carre Knighted, Mr. Carre Knighted.
and made Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and Overburies pride rose with the
others honors, still scorning the Chapmen, as they did by their cheap offices
undervalue so precious a commodity.

Northampton finding himself neglected by so mean a fellow, Northamptons plot
upon him.
cast about another way, and followed Balaams council, by sending a Moabitish
Woman unto him, in which he made use of Copinger a Gentleman, who had spent a
fair fortune left by his Ancestors, and now for maintenance, was forced to
lead the life of a Serving-man (that formerly kept many to serve him) and as an
addition, the worst of that kind, a flat Bawd.

This Gentleman had lived a scandalous life, by keeping a Whore of his own,
which for the honor of her Family I will not name, therefore was fittest to
trade in that commodity for another, and in truth was fit to take any
impression baseness could stamp on him, as the sequel of this story will
manifest; This Moabitish woman, was a Daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, married
to a young noble Gentleman the Earl of Essex.

This Train took, and the first private meetings were at Copingers house, and
himself Bawd to their lust, which put him into a far greater bravery for a
time* then when he was master of his own, but i^ had bitterness on all hands
in the end. This privacy in their stolen pleasures, made Copinger a friend to
Northampton, and Suffolk, though but a Servant to Viscount Rochester, for so
now was he called, and now had they linked him so close, as no breaking from
them.

Overbury was that John Baptist that reprooved the Lord, for the sin of using
the Lady, and abusing the young Earl of Essex; would call her Strumpet, her
mother and brother Bawds, and used them with so much scorn, as in truth was
not to be endured from a fellow of his Rank; to persons of that quality, how
faulty soever otherwise they were.

Then to satisfy Overbury, and blot out the name of Sin, his love led him into
a more desperate way by a resolution to marry another man's wife, against this
then did Overbury bellow louder, and in it, showed himself more like an
affectionate, then a discreet and moderate friend: had he compounded but one
dram of discretion with an ounce of affection, he might with such a receipt,
have preserved his own life, and their fortunes and honors.

For, those that infinitely hated that Family, did as infinitely condemn his
insolent carriage and behavior toward them; so that had any of those
Brothers, or name, killed Overbury, either by picking a quarrel with him, or
pistolling him, or any other desperate way, or bravely in a Duel, upon some
other ground of a quarrel, then blemishing their Sister; the World would have
justified the action, however he had stood with God; but Buchanans character of
that Family bars all expectation of so much bravery of spirit; but a Counsel
must be held to put him to death by some baser means.

The Plot them must be, The plot against Overbury.
he must be sent a Leidger Ambassador into France, which by obeying, they
should be rid of so great an eyesore, by disobeying, he incurred the
displeasure of his Prince; a contempt, that he could not expect less then
imprisonment for, and by that means be sequestered from his friend.

And thus far I do believe the Earl of Somerset, (for so was he now created)
was consenting; this stratagem took, and Overbury might truly say Video
meliora, deteriora sequor: for he indeed made the worst choice; it could not be
thought, but such an employment was far above his desert, and much better for
him to have accepted then to be confined to a loathsome Prison, and for want
of judgment, had his sufferings been less then loss of life he had not bin
worthy of pity; but, Jupiter quos vult perdere, hos dementat; he would to the
Tower, from whence he never returned, rather then accept of an honorable
employment, from whence he might not only have returned, but done his friends
acceptable service, either in private, or public.

In his managing of this business, that wisdom of his which formerly he had
been esteemed for, suffered under the censure of Wise men, as well as Fools.
Having him now fast in Prison; Herodias by pleasing her Herod must also ask,
and have his life; for, per scelus ad scelera tutior est via. To that end they
preferred Empoysoners to be servants to Sir Gervase Elwayes then Lieutenant of
the Tower; The Gentleman was ever held wise, and honest, but unfortunate in
having this place thrust upon him without his thought; he was also so
religious, that few in the Court did equal him; so wise, as he obtained the
Character of wise Sir Gervase Elwayes, yet neither could his wisdom, nor the
opinion of his Religion and honesty, prevent that Fate, he was so ignorant of
the plot, as he never did dream of any such matter; until one day (as it
should seem) Weston being told, Elwayes did know wherefore he was preferred
unto him, to wait on Overbury; he asked the Lieutenant one day before dinner
whether he should now do it, Elwayes asked him, what? Weston at that being
somewhat abashed, Elwayes espying it, presently said, no not yet; for he did
believe there was something known to Weston, which was a secret to himself.
Whereupon, Elwayes could not chew any meat, for chewing upon those words of
Weston, but instantly commanded his Table to be voyded, and thence he went into
his Study, and sent for Weston to come unto him, examining him of the meaning
of that question; at last by fair means, and threatening together, got the
truth; then Elwayes (as he well could) laid before Weston the horridness of
the Fact, the torments of Hell, and the unassurance of his momentary inioying
of either reward or favor after the Fact done, but that it must follow so many
Personages of Honor, would never cabinet such a secret in his breast, that
might ruin them; at last made him so sensible of his danger in this life; but
more sensible of the torments in the other, that Weston falling on his knees,
said; O Lord, how good and gracious art thou, and thy mercy is above all thy
works; for this day is salvation come to my soul, and I would not for all the
world have had such a sin upon me; giving the Lieutenant humble thanks, that
had been the instrument of saving his soul, by putting him off from so foul
intentions.

The Lieutenant having now thus renewed grace in him, by making him (as he
thought) a new man; said, thou and I have a dangerous part to act, yet be
honest and true to me, and I doubt not, but with Gods help, we shall perform it
well, both before God and the World; Weston faithfully promised him, and for a
long time as faithfully performed with him; the Lieutenant willed him, to bring
all such things as were sent him (to give Overbury) unto him, which he
accordingly did; the Lieutenant gave them to Cats and Dogs which he ever had
ready in his study for that purpose; some died presently, some lay lingering a
longer time: all the Jellies and Tarts sent to Overbury, he cast into his
Privy, they destaining the very Dishes,

This continued long, the Earl often sending to visit Overbury, assuring him
he did not forget his release, which would not be long deferred, wherein most
men did verily believe he meant both nobly and truly, though others conjectured
his meaning was a dissolution: At last the Countess sent for Weston, reviling
him, and calling him, Treacherous Villain, for had he given those things sent,
Overbury had not been now alive; vowing, she would be revenged on him; upon the
very fear whereof, he then gave those poisons after sent, without acquainting
the Lieutenant; yet for all this schooling of Weston, and his assurance given
of his future fidelity to the Countess, she would not trust him single any
more, but put another Co-adjutor to him, one Franklin, a verier Villain then
Weston, and truly they themselves may be deemed very ill, that could seek out
such wicked instruments.

These two Villains, out of a desire to see the success of their hellish
employment, coming shortly after it, into Overburyes chamber, found him in
infinite torment, with contention between the strength of Nature and the
working of the Poison, and it being very like Nature had gotten the better in
that contention, by the thrusting out of boyls, botches, and blains, they
fearing it might come to light, upon the judgment of Physicians, that foul
play had been offered him, consented to stifle him with the Bed-cloathes, which
accordingly was performed, and so ended he his miserable life, with the
assurance of the Conspirators, that he dyed by poison; none thinking (much
less knowing) otherwise, but these two Murderers.

Now was all (as they believed) quiet, and in the depth of security, and the
Earl and Countess began to carry their loves more openly and impudently: But,
they understanding that the world did talk very loudly, and broadly of this
adulterous meeting; it must (from that ground) proceed to an adulterous
Marriage, as well to the wronging a young Noble man, as to the dishonor and
shame of themselves; But they must needs go whom the Devil drives: yet know
they not how, and somely to effect this, but by making the King a Party in this
bawdy business, which was no hard matter to effect; for the Kings eye began to
wander after a new Favorite, being satiated with the old; therefore for the
bringing this bawdery to a marriage, the Bishops must be principal actors (as
I know not in what bad action they would not be lookerson,) and the Bishop of
Winchester, an excellent Civilian, and a very great Scholar, must be the
principal, for which his Son was Knighted, and will never lose that by-title of
Sir Nullity Bilson.

For, by a nullity of the first Marriage, must the second take place; For the
canvasing whereof, there were many meetings of the Bishops and the prime
Civillians, in which there wanted no bribes from the Lord, Lady, and their
Friends, to have this nullity brought to pass, wherein the discourse would
have better befitted the mouths of Bawds and Ruffians, then the grave Divines;
among them* Bishop Neal, (then Bishop of Rochester, a Creature and Favorite of
the house of Suffolk) took up a learned discourse in the Science of Bawdery,
how many degrees in that Science must produce a Nullity, wherein were so many
beastly expressions, as for modesty sake I will not recite them, being
offensive to my very thoughts and memory; Aristotle's Problemes was a modest
discourse to his, and he appeared to be better studied in that, then in
Divinity, and to wind up his learned Discourse, concluded, all those met in
this Lord, (meaning Essex) and this Lady.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Abbot, to his everlasting fame, mainly opposed
all the proceedings, and protested against them, for which he ever after lived
in disgrace, excluded from the Council Table, and dyed in the disgrace of the
King on Earth, though in favor with the King of Kings.

Yet, forsooth, to make up the full measure of Bawdery, and to justify Neales
Discourse, that all things in the former Marriage conduced to a nullity; a
search must be made, to find whether there had been a penetration, and a Jury
of grave Matrons were found fit for that purpose, with their Spectacles,
ground, to lessen, not to make the letter larger; who after their inspection
gave their (false) verdict, that she was intacta virgo: which was thought very
strange, for the World took notice that her way was very near beaten, so
plain, as by regia via, and in truth so it was, and a way more common than
that, before Somerset did ever travel that way; besides, the World took
notice they two had long lived in Adultery, yet had this old Kettle a trick for
that also.

The Lady of Essex, for modesty sake, makes humble suit to the reverend bawdy
Bishops, (who were also plotters in this stratagem) that she might not appear
barefaced, for blushing; but desired to come veiled, with a Taffity over her
face; this by all means was thought so reasonable (for a pretty modest Lady)
that the bawdy Bishops, and pur-blinde Ladies, which had forgotten modesty
themselves, could not think it worthy the denial; one Mistress Fines, near
Kinswoman to old Kettle, was dressed up in the Countesses Clothes, at that
time too young to be other then virgo intacta, though within two years after*
had the old Ladies made their inspection, the orifice would not have appeared
so small, to have delivered such a verdict as they did (and a just one) upon
their views: though upon some of their knowledges it was not that Lady they
were to give verdict upon; if any make doubt of the truth of this Story, the
Author delivers upon the reputation of a Gentleman, he had it verbatim from a
Knight, (otherwise of much Honor, S. W. B.
though the very dependency on that Family may question it) which did usher the
Lady into the place of inspection, and has told it often to his friends in
mirth.

Now is the Nullity pronounced, and the Marriage with Somerset with speed
solemnized, for which they and the whole Family of Suffolk paid dear in after
time; and had sour sauce to that sweet meat of their great Son in Law

And surely he was the most unfortunate man in that marriage, being as
generally beloved for himself, and disposition, as hated afterward for his
linking himself in that Family; for in all the time of this man's favor,
before this Marriage, he did nothing obnoxious to the State, or any base thing
for his private gain, but, whether it was his own nature that curbed him, or
that there was then a brave Prince living, and a noble Queen that did awe him,
we cannot so easily judge, because after this Marriage, and their death, he did
many very ill things.

In this Favorites flourishing time, came over the Palsgrave to marry our
Kings Daughter, which for the present, gave much content, and with the general
applause; yet it proved a most unfortunate Match to him and his Posterity, and
all Christendom; for his Alliance with so many great Princes, put on him
aspiring thoughts, and so ambitious was he as not to content himself with his
hereditary Patrimony of one of the greatest Princes in Germany; but must aspire
to a Kingdom, believing that his great alliance would carry him through any
enterprise, or bring him off with honor, in both which he failed; being cast
out of his own Country with shame, and he and his, ever after, living upon the
devotion of other Princes; but had his Father in Law spent half the money in
Swords he did in words, (for which he was but scorned) it had kept him in his
own inheritance, and saved much Christian blood since shed; but whiles he,
being wholly addicted to peace, spent much treasure, in sending costly
Ambassadors to treat his Enemies (which he esteemed friends) might have sent
Armies with a less charge, to conquer, so that it may be concluded, that this
then thought the most happy Match in Christendom, was the greatest unhappines
to Christendom, themselves and Posterity.

And, as if to foretell the sad event, presently after the Gallantry and
triumphing of that Marriage, the Kingdom was clad all in mourning, for the sad
obsequies of that most hopeful Prince Henry, who dyed not without vehement
suspicion of Poison, and I wish I could say but suspicion only; but our future
discourse will tell you otherwise: He was only showed to this Nation, as the
Land of Canaan was to Moses, to look on, not to enjoy: we did indeed joy in
that happiness we expected in him, but God found us so unthankful, and took
so lightly the death of that ever famous Queen Elizabeth, as he intended, to
make us an example of scorn now, that were formerly, of all glory.

His death was foretold by one Bruce, Pr. Henry and Salisbury's death.
a most famous Astrologer of the Scottish Nation, for which the Earl of
Salisbury (a great Statesman) caused him to be banished, who left this
farewell with the Earl, that it should be too too true, yet his Lordship
should not live to see it, the Earl dying in May, the Prince in November
following, to the infinite grief of all the Kingdom; but the Earl of
Somerset and Family of Howards, who by his death thought themselves secured
from all future dangers; for, he being a Prince of an open heart, hating all
baseness, would often say, If ever he were King, he would not leave one of
that Family to piss against a wall.

This brave Prince being dead, Somerset and that Faction bare all down before
them, disposing of all offices; yet Somerset never turned any out (as did the
succeeding favorite) but places being void, he disposed of them, and who would
give most, was the word, yet not by Somerset himself, but by his Lady and her
Family; for he was naturally of a noble disposition, and it may be justly said
of him, that never could be said of any before, or ever will be of any after
him; He never got suite for himself or friends that was burdensome to the
Commonwealth, no Monopolies, no Impositions; yet in his time, and by his
favor, (though not for his use) were brought into the Court two mean fellows
grand Projectors, the one, Ingram, an ordinary Waiter of the Customs, Ingram
and Cranfield Projectors.
the other, Cranfield, an Apprentice, who had served three broken Citizens, and
it is probable by his wit and honesty he might thrive by them all, and lay that
for his first a foundation of his future projecting; the one a creature of
Northamptons, the other of the house of Suffolk, and these like ill birds
defiled their own nests, and discovered the secrets of the Custom house; yet
their projects seemed for the Kings profit only, though much water ran by his
Mill, and Suffolk did very well lick his own fingers; for, Salisbury being
dead, Suffolk was Treasurer (the proper place for Customs) and his Son in Law*
Chamberlain and Favorite, and then what could not they two do?

Yet Somerset ever kept them but like Projectors, which after Favorites raised
to the degrees of Nobility, only Suffolk by Somersets power made Ingram a
Cofferer of the Kings House, which was the first apparent step to Somersets
downfall; for, however the King made fair semblance to maintain that Act, yet
made he the Earl of Kelly his instrument to set the Officers of his household
to petition him against it, and ever from the Kings own directions to take
their instructions, in which, one of the Principal given, was, not to seek to
Somerset upon any terms, nay, to deny to accept his favor though offered to
disannul his own act, but to carry it with an high hand against Somerset, by
which, assurance was given of prevailing. Here was pretty juggling; (the Court
being then but an Academy of Juglers.) Somerset did often Court the Officers
(to make him that Achilles his Weapon, that could wound and heal again) but
was entertained with s^orne; yet ambition so dazzled his eyes, he could not see
the precipice on which he stood ready for his downfall; for, surely no
Astrologers could have given him truer notions of his ruin then this:
Cranfield, the other Projector soared higher, though not in Somersets time
could he have his feathers imped, but Buckingham after did so impe them, that
Cranfield endeavored to pull out his, and gave him the first affront; by this
you may observe how the times altered from better to worse, and so fittest for
worthless men.

For now began to appear a glimering of a new Favorite, Mr. George Villiers a
Favorite.
one Mr. George Villiers, a younger Son, (by a second Venture) of an ancient
Knight in Leicestershire, as I take it, his Father of an ancient Family, his
Mother but of a mean, and a waiting Gentlewoman, whom the old man fell in
love with and married, by whom he had three sons, all raised to the Nobility,
by means of their brother-Favourite: this Gentleman was come also but newly
from Travel, and at that time did believe it a great fortune to marry a
Daughter of Sir Roger Astons, and in truth it was the height of his ambition,
and for that only end was an hanger on upon the Court; the Gentlewoman loved
him so well, as could all his friends have made (her for her great fortune) but
an hundred Marks Jointure, she had married him presently, in despite of all
her friends; and no question would have had him without any Jointure at all.

But, as the Fates would have it, before the closing up of this Match, the King
cast a glancing eye toward him, which was easily perceived by such as observed
their Princes humor, and then the Match was laid aside, some assuring him a
greater Fortune was coming toward him. Then, one gave him his place of
Cup Bearer, that he might be in the Kings eye; another sent to his Mercer and
Tailor to put good Clothes on him; a third, to his Sempster for curious
Linen, and all as prefacive insinuations to obtain Offices upon his future
Rise; then others took upon them to be his Bravoes, to undertake his quarrels
upon affronts put on him by Somersets Faction, so all hands helped to the
piecing up this new Favorite.

Then begun the King to eat abroad, who formerly used to eat in his
Bedchamber, or if by chance supped in his Bedchamber, after supper would come
forth to see pastimes and fooleries; in which Sir Ed. Zouch, Sir George Goring,
and Sir John Finit were the chief and Master Fools, and surely this Fooling
got them more then any others wisdom, far above them in desert: Zouch his
part it was to sing bawdy songs, and tell bawdy tales; Finits, to compose these
Songs: then was a set of Fiddlers brought to Court on purpose for this Fooling,
and Goring was Master of the game for Fooleries, sometimes presenting David
Droman, and Archee Armstrong the Kings Fool, on the back of the other fools,
to tilt one at another, till they fell together by the ears; sometimes the
property was presented by them in Antic Dances. But Sir John Millicent (who
was never known before) was commended for notable fooling, and so was he indeed
the best extemporary fool of them all: with this jollity was this Favorite
ushered in. This made the house of Suffolk fret, and Somerset carried himself
now more proudly, and his Bravado's, ever quarrelling with the others, which,
by his Office of Lord Chamberlain, for a while carried it. But, Somerset using
of Sir Ralph Wynwood (whom himself brought in for a Secretary of State) in so
scornful a manner (he having but only the title, the Earl himself keeping
the Seals, and doing the business) made Wynwood endeavor to ruin him, who
soon got an opportunity thereto, by frequenting the Countess of Shrewsbury
(then Prisoner in the Tower) who told Wynwood on a time, that Overbury was
poisoned, which she had so understood from Sir Gervase Elwaies; who did labor
by her means to deal with her two sons in Law, Arundell and Pembrooke,
(Wynwood also being great-with that faction) that when it came into question,
he might save his own stake, who truly was no otherwise guilty, but that he
did not discover it at Westons first disclosing it (he being Keeper of the
prison) so by inference, his not disclosing it, was Overburies death; and had
he revealed it then, I dare say he had been brought into the Star Chamber for
it, and undone (for yet was not the time fit for discovery.) Wynwood, it was
thought, acquainted the King with it, knowing how willingly he would have been
rid of Somerset, yet the King durst not bring it in question, nor any question
ever would have been, had not Somerset sought to cross him in his passion of
love to his new Favorite, in which the King was more impatient, then any woman
to enjoy her love.

Not long after, Thrumball, Agent at Bruxels, had (by an Apothecaries boy one
Reeve, after an Apothecary himself in London, and dyed very lately) gotten
hold of this poisoning business, for Reeve having under his Master, made some
of those desperate Medicines, either run away, or else his Master sent him out
of the way, and fell in company of Thrumbals servants at Bruxels, to whom he
revealed it, they to their Master, who examining the boy, discovered the truth;
Thrumball presently wrote to Secretary Wynwood he had business of consequence
to discover, but would not send it, therefore desired license to come over. The
King would not yield to his return, but willed him to send an Express: That
Thrumball utterly refused; and very wisely, for had any thing appeared under
his hand, the boy might have dyed, or run away, and then had he made himself
the Author of that which the courtesy of another must have justified.

The King being of a longing disposition, rather then he would not know,
admitted Thrumbals return, and now they had good testimony by the Apothecary,
who revealed Weston, Mrs. Turner, and Franklyn to be principal Agents, yet
this (being near the time of progress) was not stirred in till about
Michaelmas following; yet Wynwood did now carry himself in a braving way of
contestation against Somerset, struck in with the Faction of Villiers, now on
progress. The King he went westward, where he was feasted at Cranborne, by a
Son in Law of that Family; at Lulworth, and Bindon, by the Lord Walden; at
Charlton, by Sir Thomas Howard; and every where nothing but one Faction braving
the other; then was the King feasted at Purbeck by the Lord Hatton, who was of
the contrary Faction, and at a Jointure house of Sir George Villiers mother,
called Gotly, where he was magnificently entertained.

After all this feasting, homeward came the King, who desired by all means to
reconcile this clashing between his declining, and rising Favorite; to which
end, at Lulworth the King employed Sir Humphrey May, a great servant to
Somerset, and a wise servant to Villiers, but with such instructions as if it
came from himself: and Villiers, had order presently after Sir Humphrey Mayes
return, to present himself and service to Somerset. My Lord, said he, Sir
George Villers, will come to you to offer his service, and desire to be your
creature; and therefore refuse him not, embrace him, and your Lordship shall
still stand a great man, though not the sole Favorite: My Lord seemed averse,
Sir Humphrey then told him in plain terms, that he was sent by the King to
advise it, and that Villiers would come to him to cast himself into his
protection, to take his rise under the shadow of his wings: Sir Humphrey May
was not parted from my Lord half an hour, but in comes Sir George Villiers,
and used these very words, My Lord, I desire to be your servant, and your
creature, and shall desire to take my Court-preferment under your favor, and
your Lordship shall find me, as faithful a servant unto you, as ever did
serve you. My Lord returned this quick and short answer, I will none of your
service, nor shall you have any of my favor, I will, if I can, break your
neck, and of that be confident. This was but a harsh Complement, and savoured
more of spirit then wisdom; and since that time, breaking each others necks
was their aims, and its verily believed, had Somerset complied with Villiers,
Overburyes death had still lain raked up in his own ashes; but, God, who will
never suffer murder to go unpunished, will have what he will, maugre all the
wisdom of the World.

To Windsor does the King return, to end His Progress, from thence to
Hampton Court, then to White Hall, and shortly after to Royston, to begin His
Winter-Iourney.

And now begins the game to be played, in which, Somerset must be the loser,
the Cards being shuffled, cut, and dealt between the King and Sir Edward Cook,
Chief Justice (whose Daughter Turbeck, Villers his Brother had married, or was
to marry, and therefore a fit instrument to ruin Somerset) and Secretary
Winwood; these all played: The stake, Somersets life, and his Ladies, and their
Fortunes, and the Family of Suffolk; some of them played booty, and in truth
the Game was not played above-board.

The day the King went from White Hall to Theobalds, and so to Royston, the
King sent for all the Judges (his Lords and Servants encircling him) where
kneeling down in the midst of them, he used these very words:

My Lords the Judges; It is lately come to my hearing, that you have now in
examination a business of poisoning: Lord in what a most miserable condition
shall this Kingdom be, (the only famous Nation for hospitality in the World)
if our Tables should become such a snare, as none could eat without danger of
life, and that Italian custom should be introduced amongst us! (Therefore, my
Lords, I charge you, as you will answer it at that great and dreadful day of
Judgment, that you examine it strictly without favor, affection, or
partiality; and if you shall spare any guilty of this crime, Gods curse light
upon you and your posterity: And if I spare any that are found guilty, Gods
curse light on me, and my posterity for ever. But how this dreadful
thunder-Curse or imprecation was performed, shall be showed hereafter; and I
pray God, the effect be not felt amongst us, even at this day (as it has been,
I fear, on that virtuous Lady Elizabeth, and her children,) for God treasures
up such imprecations and deprecations, and poures them out when a Nation least
dreams, even when they cry, peace, peace, to their souls; and it may well be at
this time (our other sins concurring) that he is pouring them out upon King,
Judges, and the whole State.

It appears how unwilling the King was to ruin Somerset, a creature of his
own making, But, immedicabile vulnus, Ense rescin^endum est; Grace was offered
by the King, had he had grace to have apprehended it.

The King with this, took his farewell for a time of London, and was
accompanied with Somerset to Royston, where no sooner he brought him, but
instantly took his leave, little imagining what viper lay amongst the herbs;
nor must I forget to let you know how perfect the King was in the art of
dissimulation, or, (to give it his own phrase) King-craft; The Earl of
Somerset (to his apprehension) never parted from him with more seeming
affection then at this time, when intentionally the King had so exposed him to
Cooks dressing, that he knew Somerset should never see him more; and had you
seen that seeming affection (as the Author himself did) you would rather have
believed he was in his rising, then setting: The Earl when he kissed his hand,
K. James his parting with Somerset*
the King hung about his neck, slabboring his cheeks; saying, for Gods sake
when shall I see thee again? On my soul, I shall neither eat, nor sleep,
until you come again; the Earl told him, on Monday (this being on the Friday,)
for Gods sake let me, said the King, shall I? shall I? Then lolled about his
neck; then, for Gods sake, give thy Lady this kiss for me: in the same manner
at the stayres head, at the middle of the stairs, and at the stayres foot; the
Earl was not in his Coach, when the King used these very words (in the hearing
of four servants, of whom, one was Somersets great creature, and of the
Bedchamber, who reported it instantly to the Author of this History) I shall
never see his face more. I appeal therefore to the Reader, whether this Motto
of Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare, was not as well performed in this
passage, as his Beati pacifici, in the whole course of his life; and his love
to the latter, made him to be beaten with his own weapon in the other, by all
Princes and States that had to do with him.

But, before Somersets approach to London his Countess was apprehended; at his
arrival, himself; and the King being that night at supper, said to Sir Thomas
Monson, My Lord chief Justice has sent for you; he asked the King, when he
should wait on him again, who replied, you may come when you can: And (as in
the story of Byron, and many others) there have been many foolish observations,
as presage; so was there in this Gentleman, who was the Kings Mr. Faulconer,
and in truth such an one, as no Prince in Christendom had; for, what Flights
other Princes had, he would excel them for his Master, in which one was at the
Kite.

The French sending over his Faulconers to show that sport, his Master
Faulconer lay long here, but could not kill one Kite, (ours being more
magnanimous then the French Kite; Sir Thomas Monson desired to have that flight
in all exquisitnesse, and to that end was at 1000l. charge in Ger-Faulcons for
that flight, in all that charge, he never had but one cast would perform it;
and those had killed nine Kites, which were as many as they were put off unto,
not any one of them escaping. Whereupon the Earl of Pembrooke with all the
Lords, desired the King but to walk out of Royston Towns end, to see that
Flight, which was one of the most stateliest Flights of the world, for the high
mountee: the King went unwillingly forth, the Flight was showed, but the Kite
went to such a mountee, and the Hawke after her, as all the field lost sight of
Kite and Hawke and al, and neither Kite nor Hawke were either seen or heard of
to this present, which made all the Court conjecture it a very ill omen.

So that you see, the plot was so well laid, as they could be all within the
toil at one instant, not knowing of each other.

Now are in hold, the Earl, his Countess, Sir Thomas Monson, Mris. Turner (a
very lewd and infamous woman of life) Weston and Franklin, with some others of
less note, of which one Simon a servant to Sir Thomas Monson, who was employed
in carrying Ielly and Tart to the Tower, who upon his examination, for his
pleasant answer, was instantly dismissed, My Lord told him, Simon you have had
a hand in this poisoning business; He replied, no, my good Lord, I had but one
finger in it, which almost cost me my life, and at the best cost me all my Hair
and Nails; for the truth was Simon was somewhat liquorish, and finding the
syrrup swim from the top of a Tart, as he carried it, he did with his finger
scum it off, and it was to be believed, had he known what it had been, he
would not have been his Taster at so dear a rate; and that you may know Simons
interest with that Family, I shall tell you a story.

Sir Thomas Monson was a great lover of Music, and had as good as England
had, especially for voices, and was at infinite charge in breeding some in
Italy. This Simon was an excellent Musician, and did sing delicately, but was a
more general Musician than ever the world had, and in one kind he surpassed
all. He had a Catzo of an immense length and bigness, with this, being his
Tabor stick, his palm of his hand his Tabor, and his mouth his Pipe, he would
so imitate a Tabor and Pipe, as if it had been so indeed: To this Music,
would Mrs. Turner, the young Ladies, and some of that Ging dance ever after
Supper; the old Lady, who loved that Music as well, as her Daughters, would
sit and laugh, she could scarce sit for laughing; and it was believed, that
some of them danced after that Pipe without the Tabor: his Master coming to
hear of it turned him away, who was infinitely importuned to take him again,
but would not: however he could not have wanted a service elsewhere, but he
never durst use his pipe amongst them, for their dancing recreation, however he
might for any other.

And now poor Mrs. Turner, Weston and Franklin began the Tragedy, Mrs. Turners
day of mourning being better then the day of her birth: for she dyed very
penitently, and showed much modesty in her last act, which is to be hoped was
accepted with God, after that dyed Weston; and then was Franklin arraigned, who
confessed that Overbury was smothered to death, not poisoned to death; though
he had poison given him.

Here was Cook glad, how to cast about to bring both ends together, Mrs.
Turner, and Weston being already hanged for killing Overbury with poison, but
he being the very quintessence of Law, presently informs the Jury, that if a
man be done to death, with Pistols, Poniards, swords, Halter, Poison, etc. so
he be done to death, the Indictment is good, if but indicted for any of those
ways; but the good Lawyers of those times were not of that opinion, but did
believe, that Mrs. Turner was directly murdered by my Lord Cooks Law, as
Overbury was without any Law.

In the next place, comes the Countess to her Trial, at whose Arraignment, as
also at Mrs. Turners before, were showed many Pictures, Puppits, etc. with some
Exorcismes and Magic spells, which made them appear more odious, as being known
to converse with Witches and Wizards; and amongst those tricks, Formans book
was showed. This Forman was a fellow dwelt in Lambeth, a very silly fellow, yet
had wit enough to cheat Ladies, and other women, by pretending skill in
telling their Fortunes, as, whether they should bury their Husbands, and what
second Husbands they should have, and whether they should enjoy their Loves, or
whether Maids should get Husbands, or enjoy their servants to themselves
without Corrivals; but, before he would tell any thing, they must write their
names to his Alphabeticall book, with their own hand writing; by this trick he
kept them in awe, if they should complain of his abusing them, as in truth he
did nothing else: Besides, it was believed, some meetings were at his house,
wherein the art of a Bawd was more beneficial to him, then that of a Conjurer;
and that he was a better Artist in the one then other; and that you may know
his skill, he was himself a Cuckold, having a very pretty wench to his Wife,
which would say, she did it to try his skill, but it fared with him as with
Astrologers, that cannot foresee their own destiny. I well remember, there was
much mirth made in the Court, upon the showing this book, for it was reported,
the first leaf my Lord Cook lighted on, he found his own wives name.

The next that came on the stage was Sir Thomas Monson; but the night before he
was to come to his Trial, the King being at the game of Maw, said, To morrow
comes Tom Monson to his Trial; yea, said the Kings S. H. M.
Card-holder, where if he do not play his Master-prize, your Majesty shall
never trust me; this so run in the Kings mind, as the next game, he said he
was sleepy, and would play out that Set next night; the Gentleman departed to
his lodging, but was no sooner gone, but the King sent for him, what
communication they had, I know not, (yet it may be can more easily guess then
any other) but it is most certain, next under God, that Gentleman saved his
life, for the King sent a Post presently to London, to let the Lord chief
Justice know, he would see Monsons examination and confession, to see if it
were worthy to touch his life, for so small a matter; Monson was too wise to
set any thing but fair in his confession; what he would have stabbed with,
should have been ( viva voce) at his Arraignment. The King sent word, he saw
nothing worthy of death, or of bonds, in his Accusation or Examination: Cook
was so mad, he could not have his will of Monson, that he said, Take him away,
we have other matters against him of an higher nature; with which words, out
issues about a dozen Warders of the Tower, and took him from the Bar; and
Cooks malice was such against him, as though it rained extremely, and Monson
not well, he made him go a foot from the Guild Hall to the Tower, which almost
cost him his life; there he lay a close prisoner above three months, to the end
to get a Recorders place, (that Cranfield desired) every man thinking him in
some Treason, would not lend him any Money, and if so much money had not been
paid by such a time, his place had been forfeited. And in this let me commend
the part of a true friend in Sir Humphrey May, who in 24 hours, (after Sir
Thomas his deep sensiblenesse of all other his friends deserting him in that
great exigency) made his Brother Herick take up 2000. l. and pay it, to save
his Office, without so much as any security from Sir Thomas Monson, (for he was
close prisoner) or from any friend of his; and that you may know it was for his
office only, this hard measure was showed him, the Money was no sooner paid,
but his friends might come unto him; and I must not let pass the skill of the
Lord Loriskeine, a Scotch-man, who long before, by his physiognomy, told Sir
George Marshall that Sir Thomas Monson would escape hanging nearer then ever
any man did, which was true, for he was twice brought to his trial, put
himself both times upon his Country, yet was only indicted, never tried, and
yet he had harder measure then ever any man had, for he lost his Office, being
but indicted, and not condemned, which is without any president.

And now for the last act, enters Somerset himself on the Stage, who (being
told, as the manner is, by the Lieutenant, that he must provide to go next day
to his trial) did absolutely refuse it, and said, they should carry him in his
Bed; that the King had assured him, he should not come to any trial, neither
durst the King bring him to trial; this was in an high strain, and in a
language not well under stood by Sir George Moore (then Lieutenant in Elwaies
his room) that made Moore quiver and shake, and however he was accounted a
wise man, yet he was near at his wits end.

Yet away goes Moore to Greenewich, as late as it was (being 12. at night)
bounseth at the back-staires, as if mad, to whom came Jo. Leveston, one of the
Grooms out of his Bed, enquires the reason of that distemper at so late a
season; Moore tells him he must speak with the King; Leveston replies, he is
quiet (which in the Scottish dialect, is fast asleep) Moore says, you must
awake him; Moore was called in, (the Chamber left to the King and Moore) he
tells the King those passages, and desired to be directed by the King, for he
was gone beyond his own reason, to hear such bold and undutifull expressions,
from a faulty Subject, against a just Sovereign: The King falls into a passion
of tears: On my soul, Moore, I wot not what to do, thou art a wise man,
help me in this great straight, and thou shall find thou do it for a
thankful Master, with other sad expressions; Moore leaves the King in that
passion, but assures him he will prove the utmost of his wit, to serve his
Majesty, and was really rewarded with a suit worth to him 1500. l. (although
Annandale his great friend, did cheat him of one half, so was there falsehood
in friendship.)

Sir George Moore returns to Somerset about three next morning, Somersets
Trial.
of that day he was to come to trial, enters Somersets chamber, tells him he
had been with the King, found him a most affectionate Master unto him, and full
of grace in his intentions toward him, but (said he) to satisfy Justice, you
must appear, although return instantly again, without any further
proceedings, only you shall know your enemies, and their malice, though they
shall have no power over you: With this trick of wit, he allayed his fury, and
got him quietly, about eight in the morning, to the Hall, yet feared his former
bold language might revert again, and being brought by this trick into the
toil, might have more enraged him to fly out into some strange discovery, for
prevention whereof he had two servants placed on each side of him, with a Cloak
on their arms, giving them withal a peremptory order, if that Somerset did
any way fly out on the King, they should instantly hoodwink him with that
Cloak, take him violently from the Bar, and carry him away; for which, he would
secure them from any danger, and they should not want also a bountiful reward.
But the Earl finding himself overreached, re-collected a better temper, and
went on calmly in his Trial, where he held the company until 7. at night. But
who had seen the Kings restless motion all that day (sending to every Boat he
saw landing at the Bridge, cursing all that came without tidings) would have
easily judged all was not right, and there had been some grounds for his fears
of Somersets boldness; but at last one bringing him word he was condemned, and
the passages, All was quiet. This is the very relation from Moors own mouth,
and this he told verbatim, in Wanstead Park, to two Gentlemen (of which the
Author was one) who were both left by him to their own freedom, without
engaging them, even in those times of high distemperatures, unto a faithful
secrecy in concealing it: yet, though he failed in his wisdom, they failed
not in that worth inherent in every Noble spirit, never speaking of it till
after the Kings death.

And there were other strong inducements, to believe Somerset knew that by the
King, he desired none other in the world should be partaker of, and that all
was not peace within in the Peacemaker himself; for he ever courted Somerset
to his dying day, and gave him 4000. l. per annum for Feefarme Rents, after he
was condemned, which he took in his servants names, not his own (as then being
condemned; not capable of) and he then resolved never to have a pardon. I have
heard it credibly reported, he was told by a Wizzard, that could he but come to
see the Kings face again, he should be re-invested in his former dearnesse
with him; this had been no hard experiment, but belike he had too much
Religion, to trust to Wizzards, or else some friends of his had trusted them,
and been deceived by them, that he had little reason to put confidence in them.

Many believed him guilty of Overburies death, but the most thought him guilty
only of the breach of friendship (and that in a high point) by suffering his
imprisonment, which was the highway to his murder; and this conjecture I take
to be of the soundest opinion; for by keeping him out of the action (if it were
discovered) his greatness fortified with innocence, would carry their
nocencies through all dangers. For the Gentleman himself, he had misfortune
enough to marry such a woman, in such a Family, which first undermined his
Honor, afterward his life, (at least to be dead in Law;) nor did any thing
reflect upon him in all his time of Favorite, but in, and by that Family;
first in his adulterous marriage, then in so hated a Family, and the bringing
in Cranfield and Ingram, as Projectors, all by his Wives and friends means;
otherwise had he been the bravest Favorite of our time, full of Majesty,
employing his time like a Statesman, and the King kept correspondency with him
by Letters, almost weekly, to his dying day.

And here have we brought this great man's glory to its period, with his fatal
Countess, who some years after it, dyed miserably at Chiswick. Mris. Turner,
Weston, Franklin and Elwayes dyed in the Tower, Weston ever saying, it never
troubled him to dye for the Blue Ribbons sake: and so was concluded that grand
business, the gross production of a then foul State and Court, wherein,
Pride, Revenge and Luxury abounded. Yet, and its verily believed, when the King
made those terrible Imprecations on himself, and Deprecations of the Judges,
it was intended the Law should run in its proper channel, but was stopped and
put out of course by the folly of that great Clerk though no wise man, Sir
Edward Cook, who, in a vainglorious speech, to show his vigilance, enters
into a rapture as he then sat on the Bench, saying, God knows what became of
that sweet Babe Prince Henry ( but I know somewhat;) and surely, in searching
the Cabinets, he lighted on some Papers that spoke plain in that which was ever
whispered; which had he gone on in a gentle way, would have fallen in of
themselves, not to have been prevented, but this folly of his tongue, stopped the
breath of that discovery, of that so foul a murder, which, I fear, cries still
for vengeance.

And now begins the new Favorite to reign, without any concurrent; now he
rises in honor, as well as swells with pride, breaking out of those modest
bounds, (which formerly had impaled him) to the highway of pride and scorn,
turning out, and putting in all he pleased: First, he must aspire to the
Admiralls Office himself, and would not let the old Gentleman (so well
deserving in that place) dye with that Title, but the King must put himself to
a great charge, to put out the better, and take in the worse; yet for all his
immense greatness, would he never let him be Admiral; until he had first
settled Sir Robert Mansell Vice Admiral of England, during his life, by Patent,
in which, he not only manifested his love to his Noble friend, though sometime
his servant, but his care to the State, that his experience and abilities,
might support the others inabilities; well knowing, that the Honor and safety
of the Kingdom, consisted in the wel-ordering and strength of the Navy.

Next, Egerton had displeased him by not giving way to his exorbitant desires,
he must out, and would not let him seal up his dying eyes, with the seals
which he had so long carried, and so well discharged; and to despite him the
more, and to vex his very soul in the last Agony, he sent Bacon (one he hated
yet, to be his Successor) for the Seals, which the old mansspirit could not
brook, but sent them by his own servant to the King, and shortly after yielded
his soul to his Maker.

And to the end you may know what men were made choice of, to serve turns, I
shall set you down a true story: This great Favorite sent a Noble Gentleman,
and of much worth to Bacon, with this Message, Buckinghams Message to Bacon.
that he knew him to be a man of excellent parts, and as the times were, sit to
serve his Master in the Keepers place, but he also knew him of a base and
ungrateful dispotion, and an arrant Knave, apt in his prosperity, to ruin any
that had raised him from adversity; yet for all this, he did so much study his
Masters service (knowing how fit an instrument he might be for him) that he had
obtained the Seals for him; but with this assurance, should he ever requite
him, as he had done some others to whom he had been more bound, he would cast
him down as much below scorn, as he had now raised him high above any Honor
he could ever have expected.

Bacon was at that time Attorney General, Bacons Answer.
who patiently hearing this Message, replied, I am glad my noble Lord deals so
friendly and freely with me, and has made that choice of so discreet and Noble
a friend, that has delivered his Message in so plain language; but says he,
can my Lord know these abilities in me? and can he think when I have!
attained the highest preferment my profession is capable of, I shall so much
fail in my judgment, and understanding, as to lose these abilities? and by my
miscarriage to so noble a Patron, cast my self headlong from the top of that
honor, to the very bottom of contempt and scorn? Surely, my Lord cannot
think so meanly of me. The Gentleman replied, I deliver you nothing from my
self, but the words are put into my mouth by his Lordship, to which I neither
add nor diminish; for, had it been left to my discretion, surely, though I
might have given you the substance, yet should I have apparelled it in a more
moddest attire; but as I have faithfully delivered my Lords to you, so will I
as faithfully return yours to his Lordship.

You must understand the reason of this Message, was, his ungratefulness to
Essex, which every one could remember, for the Earl saved him from starving,
and he requited him so, as his Apology must witness; were there not a great
fault, there needed no Apology; nor could any age, but a worthless, and
corrupt, in men and manners, have thought him worthy such a place of honor.

Well, Lord Keeper he was, for which he paid nothing, nor was he able; for now
was there a new trick to put in dishonest and necessitous men, to serve such
turns, as men of plentiful fortunes, and fair reputations, would not accept
of; and this filled the Church and Commonwealth full of beggarly fellows
(such daring to venture on any thing) having nothing to lose; Buckinghams
course to raise his kindred.
(for it is riches makes men cowards; Poverty, daring and valiant, to adventure
at any thing to get something) yet did not Buckingham do things gratis, but,
what their purses could not stretch unto, they paid in pensions out of their
places, all which went to maintain his numerous beggarly kindred; Bacon paid a
Pension, Heath (Attorney) paid a Pension, Bargrave (Deane) paid a Pension, with
many others: Nor was this any certain rule, for present portions must be
raised, for the Marriage of a poor Kitchen Maid, to be made a great Count
esse; so Fotherby made Bishop of Sarum, paid 3500. l. and some also, worthy
men, were preferred gratis, to blow up their Fames, and Trumpet forth their
Nobleness (as Tolson, a worthy man, paid nothing in Fine or Pension; after
him, Davenant, in the same Bishopric;) but these were but as Music before
every scene; nor were fines or pensions certain, but where men were rich,
there Fines without reservation of rent; where poor, and such as would serve
turns, there Pensions; no Fines; so Weston, and many others: There were books
of rates on all the Offices, Bishoprics, Deaneries in England, that could tell
you what Fines, what Pensions, otherwise it had been impossible such a numerous
kindred could have been maintained with the three Kingdoms Revenue.

Now was Bacon invested in his Office, and, within ten days after, the King
goes to Scotland; Bacon instantly begins to believe himself King, lies in the
Kings Lodgings, gives audience in the great Banqueting House, makes all other
Counselors attend his motions, with the same state the King used to come out,
to give audience to Ambassadors; when any other Counselor sat with him
about the Kings affairs, would (if they sat near him) bid them know their
distance; upon which, Secretary Wynwood rose, went away, and would never sit
more (under his encroached State) but instantly dispatched one to the King, to
desire him to make haste back, for even his very Seat was already usurped: At
which, I remember, the King reading it unto us, both the King and we were very
merry; and if Buckingham had sent him any Letters, would not vouchsafe the
opening or reading them in public, though, it was said, requiring speedy
dispatch, nor would vouchsafe him any answer. In this posture he lived, until
he heard the King was returning, and began to believe the Play was almost at an
end, he might personate a Kings part no longer, and therefore did again
re-invest himself with his old rags of baseness, which were so tattered and
poor at the Kings coming to Windsor; he attended two days at Buckinghams
Chamber, being not admitted to any better place, then the room where
Trencher-scrapers and Lacquies attended, there sitting upon an old wooden
chest, (amongst such as for his baseness, He is scorned.
were only fit companions, although the Honor of his place did merit far
more respect) with his Purse and Seal lying by him, on that chest; My self
told a servant of my Lord of Buckinghams, it was a shame to see the Purse and
Seal of so little value or esteem in his Chamber, though the Carryer, without
it, merited nothing but scorn, being worst among the basest. He told me they
had command it must be so; after two days he had admittance: at first entrance
he fell down flat on his face at the Dukes foot, kissing it, vowing never to
rise till he had his pardon, then was he again reconciled, and since that time
so very a slave to the Duke, and all that Family, that he durst not deny the
command of the meanest of the kindred, nor oppose anything; by this you see, a
base spirit is ever most concomitant with the proudest mind, and surely never
so many brave parts, and so base and abject a spirit tenanted together in any
one earthen Cottage, as in this one man: I shall not remember his baseness,
being out of his place, of pinning himself, for very scraps, on that Noble
Gentleman, Sir Julius Caesar's Hospitality, that at last he was forced to get
the Kings Warrant to remove him out of his house; yet in his prosperity, the
one being Chancellor, and the other Master of the Rolls, did so scorn and
abuse him, as he would alter any thing the other did.

And now Buckingham having the Chancellor, Treasurer, and all great Officers
his very slaves, swells in the height of pride, summons up all his Country
kindred, the old Countess providing a place for them to learn to carry
themselves in a Court-like garb, but because they could not learn the French
Dances so soon as to be suitable to their gay Clothes, Country Dances (for
their sakes only) must be the garb of the Court, and none else must be used.

Then must these women-kindred be married to Earls, Earls eldest Sons,
Barons, or chief Gentlemen of greatest estates, insomuch that the very female
kindred were so numerous, as were sufficient to have peopled any Plantation;
nay, very Kitchin-wenches were married to Knights eldest sons; yet, as if
England had not matches enough in the Kingdom, they married like the house of
Austria, in their own kindred, witness the Earl of Anglesea, married a cosen
German, to whom he had given earnest before; so that King James, that
naturally, in former times, hated women, had his Lodgings replenished with
them, and all of the Kindred. The Brethren, great Earls. Little children did
run up and down the Kings Lodgings, like little Rabbitstarters about their
boroughs: Here was a strange change, that the King, who formerly would not
endure his Queen and children in his Lodgeings, now you would have judged, that
none but women frequented them; nay, that was not all, but the kindred had all
the houses about White Hall (as if they had been Bulwarks and Flankers to that
Cittadell.) But, above all the Miracles of those times, old Sir Anthony Ashley,
who never loved any but boys, yet he was snatched up for a kinswoman, as if
there had been a concurrency through the Kingdom, that those that naturally
hated women, yet should love his kindred, as well as the King him.

And the very old Midwives of that kindred, flockt up for preferment, of which
old Sir Christopher Perkins, a woman-hater, that never meant to marry, nay it
was said, he had made a vow of Virginity, yet was coupled to an old Midwife, so
that you see the greatness of this Favorite, who could force (by his power
over the King) though against Nature.

But I must tell you, this got him much hatred, to raise brothers, and
brother-in-laws to the highest rank of Nobility, which were not capable of the
place, of scarce a Justice of the Peace, only his brother Purbeck had more wit
and honesty then all the kindred beside, and did keep him in some bounds of
honesty and modesty, whilst he lived about him, and would speak plain English
to him: for which plainness, when they had no color to put him from his
brother, they practiced to make him mad, and thought to bring that wicked
stratagem to effect, by countenancing a wicked Woman, his Wife, the Lord Cooks
Daughter against him, even in her base and lewd living.

And now is Purbeck mad indeed, and put from Court. Now, none great with
Buckingham, but Bawds and Parasites, and such as humoured him in his unchaste
pleasures; so that since his first being a pretty, harmless, affable
Gentleman, he grew insolent, cruel, and a monster not to be endured.

And now is Williams, sometimes Chaplain to the Lord Keeper Egerton, brought
into play, made a privie-Councellor, Deane of Westminster, and of secret
Council with the King, he was also made Bishop of Lincoln, and was generally
voyced at his first step, to marry Buckinghams Mother, who was in her husbands
time, created a Countess (he remaining still) a C. silly drunken sot) and this
was the first president of this kind ever known. Williams held her long in
hand, and no doubt, in nature of her Confessor, was her secret friend, yet
would not marry at present: which, afterward, was cause of his downfall.

Then was there a Parliament summoned, in which, Bacon for his bribery and
injustice, was thrust out, being closely prosecuted by one Morby a Woodmonger,
and one Wrenham, formerly deeply censured in the Star Chamber for accusing him
of bribery and injustice; Bacon was by Parliament justly put out of his place,
and but only for the Votes of the Bishops, had been degraded; the Bishops might
have done better to have kept their voices to have done themselves service at
this time, but surely that, with some other injustice of theirs, had so filled
up their measure of iniquity, that now Gods anger is kindled against them.

In Bacons place comes Williams, a man on purpose brought in at first to serve
turns, but in this place to do that which none of the Layity could be found
bad enough to undertake, whereupon this observation was made, that first, no
Layman could be found so dishonest as a Clergy man; next, as Bacon the Father
of this Bacon, did receive the seals from a Bishop, so a Bishop again
received them from a Bacon; and at this did the Lawyers fret, to have such a
flower pulled out of their Garland.

This Williams, though he wanted much of his Predecessors abilities for the
Law, yet did he equal him for learning and pride, and beyond him in the way of
bribery, this man answering by Petitions, in which his servants had one part,
himself another, and so was calculated to be worth to him and his servants
3000. l. per annum, by a new way never found out before.

And now being come to the height of his preferment, he did estrange himself
from the company of the old Countess, having much younger ware, who had keys
to his chamber to come to him, yet was there a necessity of keeping him in this
place for a time, the Spanish Match being yet in chase, and if it succeeded,
this man was to clap the great Seal (through his ignorance in the Laws) to
such things that none that understood the danger by knowing the Laws, would
venture upon, and for this design was he at first brought in, (no Prince
living knowing how to make use of men, better then King James.)

Now was also Suffolk turned out of his place of Lord Treasurer, and a fellow
(of the same Batch that Williams was) brought into his place, Cranfield, that
was the Projector, and never could get higher then that title in Somersets
time* now marrying one of Buckinghams kindred, attained one of the highest
Titles in the Kingdom; so that it was now generally said, that for pride and
baseness these two great places were never so suited, both of mean birth,
both proud, only the one an excellent Scholar, and of great parts; the other,
nothing but a pack of ignorance sodered together with impudence to raise him
(besides his marriage in the lusty kindred.)

This Cranfield was a fellow of so mean a condition, as none but a poor
spirited Nobility would have endured his perching on that high Tree of honor,
to the dishonor of the Nobility, the disgrace of the Gentry, and not long
after, to his own dishonor, who was thrust out of the Lords House with this
censure, that Thou Lionell, Earl of Middlesex, shall never sit, or have voice
more in this House of Peers, and shall pay for a fine to our Sovereign Lord
the King. 20000. l. leaving him still to overtop the Gentry. The Bishops kept
him also from degrading, which I do verily believe is one cause the Gentry
will degrade them.

The Spanish Match, The Prince goes into Spain.
having been long in Treaty, and it being suspected now, that the Spaniard did
juggle with the State in this, as they formerly did in a Match with that brave
Prince Henry, and in truth, in all other things wherein any negotiation had
been, only feeding the King with fair hopes, and fair words, yet foul deeds.
Whether the King suspected any such matter, or any whimsey came in the brain
of this great Favorite and Prince, to imitate the old stories of the Knights
Erland, but agreed it was (it should seem) between the Favorite and the
Prince only (no one other so much as dreaming of any such adventure except
Cottington, that the Prince must go himself into Spain: away they went under
the borrowed names of Jack and Tom Smith, to the amazement of all wise men,
only accompanied with Cottington, and some one or two more at most; taking
their way by France, they had the Ports laid so, that none should follow them,
or give any notice to the French Court, till they might get the start, etc. yet
their wisdoms made them adventure to stay in the French Court, and look on
that Lady whom he after married, and there did this Mars imitate one of Prince
Arthurs Knights, in seeking adventures through foreign Princes territories;
First beheld this French beauty, Mars vidit, visamque cupit, potiturque cupita:
as in our discourse will afterward appear; from thence away to Spain; but as
the Journey was only plotted by young heads, so it was so childishly carried,
that they escaped the French Kings Curriers very narrowly, but escape they did,
and arrived safely in Spain their wished Port, before either welcome, or
expected, by our Ambassadors, or that State.

Yet now must the best face be put on, at all hands, that put their Grandees
to new shifts, and our Ambassador the Earl of Bristoll to try his wit, for at
that time was Sir Walter Aston also Ambassador at Spain, in all occurrences
Aston complied with the Prince and Duke, Bristol ran counter; and the Duke and
Bristol hated each other mortally.

Bristol had the advantage of them there, as having the much better head-peice,
and being more conversant and dear with that State, wholly complying with them,
and surely had done them very acceptable services (and in this very Treaty was
of the pack) Buckingham had the advantage of him in England (although the King
did now hate Buckingham, yet was so awed that he durst not discover it) Then
Buckingham had all interest in his Successor by this journey, so that he laid a
present and future foundation of his succeeding greatness.

For all his power and greatness Bristoll did not forbear to put all scorns,
affronts, and tricks on him, and Buckingham lay so open, as gave the other
advantage enough by his lascivious carriage, and miscarriage. Amongst all his
tricks, he plays one so cunningly, that it cost him all the hair on his head,
and put him to the diet; for it should seem he made court to Conde Olivares
wife, a very handsome Lady; But it was so plotted betwixt the Lady, her Husband
and Bristol, that instead of that beauty, he had a notorious S^ewsbird sent
him, and surely, by reason of his said loose and vicious disposition; had ever
the Match been really intended for our Prince, yet such a Companion or
Guardian, was enough to have made that wary Nation, believe that he had also
been that way addicted; and so have frustrated the Marriage (that being a grave
and sober people, now especially when conversed with by such great foreign
ghests) but they well observed the Prince himself to be of an extraordinary
well stayed temper.

But now, many Lords flockt over, and many Servants, that he might appear the
Prince of England, and like himself, though he came thither like a private
person, many Treaties were, sometimes hope, sometimes despair, sometimes great
assurance, then all dashed again, and however, his entertainment was as great
as possible that State could afford; yet was his addresses to, and with, the
Lady, such as rendered him mean, and a private person, rather then a Prince of
that State that formerly had made Spain feel the weight of their anger, and
power; and was like a Servant, not a Suitor, for he never was admitted, but to
stand bare-head in her presence, nor to talk with her, but in a full audience
with much company.

At last, after many heats and cooles, many hopes, and despaires, the Prince
wrote a letter to his Father of a desperate despair, not only of not enjoying
his Lady, but of never more returning, with this passage, You must now, Sir,
look upon my Sister and her children, forgetting ever you had such a Son, and
never thinking more of me.

Now the folly of this voyage, plotted only by green heads, began to appear,
many showing much sorrow, many smiling at their sollies (and in truth glad in
their hearts) and however the King was a cunning dissembler, and showed much
outward sorrow, as he did for Prince Henryes death, yet something was
discerned, which made his Court believe little grief came near his heart, for
that hatred he bare to Buckingham long (as being satiated with him) and his
adoring the rising Sun, not looking after the Sun setting, made the world
believe he would think it no ill bargain to lose his Son, so Buckingham
might be lost also, for had he not been weary of Buckingham, he would never
have adventured him in such a journey, all his Courtiers knew that very well.

And for a further illustration of his weariness of Buckingham, It appeared in
the Parliament before, when the King gave so much way to his ruin, that
Buckingham challenged him that he did seek his ruin, and being generally
held as a lost man, the King (to make it appear it was not so, although, as
hereafter you shall understand, it was so, and that the King durst not avow his
own act,) brought him off from that Parliament, but Buckingham hated the King
ever afterward.

The reason the King so hated Buckingham, (besides his being weary of him, for
his now stalenesse, was his marriage, after which the Kings edge was ever taken
off from all Favorites as well as him; yet this had so much the over awing
power of him, that he durst not make show to affect any other,) there was one
Inniossa a Spanish Ambassador extraordinary here, beingan old Soldier and a
gallant fellow, who thought that Buckingham did not give that respect to him
was due to his own person, or to the person of so great a King whose person he
represented; Inniossa therefore did as much scorn and slight Buckingham and the
Prince whom he sound wholly governed by Buckingham; for now Buckingham had
found, by many passages, the Kings desire to be rid of him, he made Court to
the Prince, and so wrought himself into his affection, that Damon and Pythias
were not more dear each to other, which by no means could the old King away
with, nor in truth did any other like or approve of the Prince his poor spirit,
fearing it foretold his future inclination, that could ever endure any
familiarity with such an one, as had put such foul scorns and affronts on him
in his time of greatness with the Father: especially, such as called to mind
the bravery of his brother, who hated the whole Family for their general
baseness, although none of them had ever offended him in particular, as this
man had done the Prince at two several times, once, before an infinite
concourse, by bidding him in plain terms kiss his Arse; a second time,
offering to strike him, saying in most undutiful terms, By God it shall not be
so, nor you shall not have it, lifting up his hand over his head with a
Ballon-Bracer, that the Prince said, What, my Lord, I think you intend to
strike me: The first of these audacious affronts was at Royston, the second at
Greenwich, before about 400. people. Neither of which were to be endured by a
private person, but by a Prince from a private person, surely it showed a much
less spirit then should have been inherent to a Prince, and after this, to be
so dear with him, as to be governed by him all his life time, more then his
Father was in the prime of his affection, I can give it no title mean enough;
it had been worthy the Noble mind of a Prince to have forgotten such injuries,
as never to have revenged them when he had been King, but never to have
suffered him to have come near his Court, to upbraid him with the sight of so
much scorn, and that publicly offered him before: But at that time I well
remember some Critticks in Court did not stick to read his future destiny.

This Inniossa being a brave daring Gentleman, used some speeches in the
derogation of the Prince and Buckingham, as if they were dangerous to the old
King; nay, Inniossa sent one Padro Macestria (a Spanish Jesuit, and a great
Statesman) to King James, to let him know, that he, (under confession) had
found the King was by Buckingham, or by his procurement, to be killed, but
whether by poison, Pistol, Dagger, etc. that he could not tell.

The King, after the hearing of this, was extreme melancholy, and in that
passion was found by Buckingham at his return to him. The King, as soon as
ever he espied him, said, Ah Stenny, Stenny, (for so he ever called him in
familiarity,) will thou kill me? at which Buckingham started, and said, who,
Sir, has so abused you? at which the King sat silent; out went Buckingham,
sretting and fuming, asked, who had been with the King in his absence? It was
told him Padro Macestria, then who brought him to the King? it was replied, the
Earl of Kelly; then flew Buckingham on him, to know how he durst bring any one
in to the King in his absence, or without his license? Kelly stood up close to
him (for you must know, Kelly was the truest alarm to give warning of the
downfall of a Favorite, of any in the Court) and knew his power could do him
no hurt with the King, in present; although it utterly cast him out of all
favor from the King in future.

Then Buckingham questioned Padro Macestria, but that quarrel was interposed
and undertook by Inniossa, who told him he would maintain him a Traitor, and
that, were his Masters person off him; he was a Chivalier, and better borne
then himself, and would make it good on him with his Sword.

Which high comparison (though I believe true enough) together with his
generous Charge and Challenge, Buckingham for that time swallowed, and only
thought of this shift to vindicate himself on Inniossa, which was, to cause
the Prince to write a Letter of complaint to the King of Spain, for abusing
him and Buckingham; but the King of Spain returned the Letter in a kind of
scorn, to Inniossa, not as blaming him, but rather commending him; and
Inniossa in scorn sent it to the Prince, as if he should say, there is your
Letter to wipe --, which is all it is fit for.

Now have you heard what made the King hate Buckingham, you shall also hear the
reason of Buckinghams extreme hatred to the King, which was believed the cause
of his so speedy death. Yelverton, a very faithful servant to the King, and his
Attorney General, and no less affectionate to Somerset, being formerly raised
by him without any seeking of his, or so much as within his thought, insomuch
as to express his love to Somerset, he desired to lay down that great place,
rather then aggravate, as his place required, against him. This man, as well
out of his faithfulness to the King, as affection to Somerset, was made choice
of, to work the downfall of Buckingham, in which he apparently showed
himself. But Buckingham, as I told you before, out of the Kings fear, that
durst not maintain his own design, but left his Instruments to the mercy of
Buckinghams tyranny, being once gotten out of the toil, like a chased Boar,
foamed, and bit at all came near him, and amongst them first fastened on
Yelverton, put him out of his place, and committed him close Prisoner to the
Tower; Yelverton having showed himself so faithful to his Master, and he
again so unfaithful to him, to leave him to undergo the whole burden of
Buckinghams fury, did fly out in some passion before Sir Allen Appesly, then
Lieutenant of the Tower, and Buckinghams great creature.

Appesly telling the Duke of some passages in his passion, the Duke one night
about 12. a clock came in a a disguise, and with the Lieutenant only, entered
Yelvertons longing, Yelverton at first sight started, verily believing, he came
in that manner to murder him; yet, at last recollected himself, and said: My
Lord, have you the Kings Warrant for this? the Duke said, no; then said
Yelverton, how dare you enter a close prisoners lodging? it is as much as your
life is worth: And assure your self Master Lieutenant, the King shall know of
this, and you must answer it. My Lord said, I come to you (as a friend, though,
formerly, I confess, upon just cause, your mortal enemy;) only to ask you
but two questions, which if you will resolve me, I vow to be a greater friend
now then ever an enemy, and can, and will restore you fourfold: Yelverton
told him, if they were such as he might, he would.

The first he asked was, What wrong he had ever done him, that he so greedily
thirsted after his blood? Yelverton replied, never any, but I was set on by a
power that I could not withstand, to do what I did; he asked him by whom? by
the King your Master, said he, who hates you more then any man living, which
you might well understand, when in his Speech to the Parliament, he said, he
would not spare any (no not any that were dearest to him, or lay in his bosom)
by which he pointed them to you.

Well, said Buckingham, I see you have dealt like a Friend with me, by many
other concurrences as well as by this; give me your hand, henceforth you are my
friend, and I am yours; and I will raise you highet then I have cast you down:
which he had made good, had Yelverton lived to have enjoyed it, for he was
instantly released, and the next preferment he gratified him with was a Judges
place, and he had been Lord Keeper, had not death prevented it. And if there
were no other reason, but his change from a mortal enemy to so firm a friend,
this were sufficient to confirm the truth of this story. But the Author had
this from Yelvertons own relation, and cannot commend Yelverton, because it is
verily believed this hastened the Kings death.

Now have you heard the true causes of Buckinghams hatred to the King, and the
Kings to Buckingham, the King having the more power to revenge, had the less
courage; Buckingham less power, but more courage, sharpened with revenge: And
however the World did believe the Kings inclination was out of a religious
ground, that he might not revenge, yet it was no other but a cowardly
disposition that dust not adventure; But although the King lost his opportunity
on Buckingham, yet the black plaster and powder did show Buckingham lost not
his on the King; and that it was no fiction but a reallity, that Padro
Macestria had formerly told the King.

And now to return from this digression, which is not impertinent, (besides a
great secret,) the Prince returns from Spain, contrary to expectation; in
which the wisdom and gravity of the Spaniard failed him, especially if they
did believe Padro Macestria (besides nature could not long support the old
King) and then the Spaniard might have made no little advantage by enjoying
such a pledge: But they have confessed their error, yet do palliate it with
having the Prince his faith and his proxy left with Digby, and got thence with
the very same trick Sir Francis Michell said, he got out of the Inquisition at
Rome.

Now is all the fault laid on Digbyes false play and unfaithfulness to his
Master, and combining with the Spaniard, and by this piece of service
expressing his hatred to the Spaniard for his own ends (the Subjects of
England having ever naturally hated them) Buckingham, the most hated man then
living, from an accused man in the former Parliament, came to be the very
darling of this Parliament, and a favorite to the whole Kingdom, which after
King James his death he as soon lost again, (so inconstant are the multitude.)

In the Banqueting House before both Houses of Parliament, is Buckingham to
give an account of this voyage, which he did at large, and to every full point
as a further attestation, he says, how say you Sir? to which the Prince
answered, I, yea, or yes, and through all his discourse labored to make
Bristoll as hateful to this Parliament, as himself had been to the former:
which, had these things delivered by him, and attested by the Prince, been
truths; he had justly deserved death, the accusations were foul, and little
less then treason, without any legislative power.

Digby had some friends who instantly sent this Declaration into Spain, Digby
acquaints that King, takes his leave of him for England: that King sets his
danger before him, offers if he will stay with him, seeing it is for his sake
he is like to suffer, he would make him much greater in Honor and fortune then
his Master can do; Digby gives him thanks, but says, he served so just a
Master that would not condemn him unheard, and should he, yet he had much
rather suffer under innocence, then lie under the imputation of a false
accusation of a fugitive, and Traitor, for the highest preferment in the World.

Away therefore comes he, puts himself into a desperate passage, least the
Parliament should have been dissolved before his coming, and so no place or
means left him for his defense, but must lie under those false calumnies, and
was here (as the Prince came into Spain) sooner then either looked for, or
welcome.

Into the Parliament comes he, with his Hat full of papers, where he puts
himself upon this point, that if there were one syllable true that Buckingham
had delivered, if this (holding up a Paper in his hand) be a true copy; I will
yield my self guilty of all treasons can be laid to my charge, and said, these
papers, (pointing to his Hat) shall make it manifest: Besides, some of them
shall make Buckingham appear a very monster in his lascivious carriages, too
too unchaste for the ears of this Honorable Assembly: Bristoll was instantly
committed close prisoner to the Tower for a contempt; the next day he was
riding through Cheap Side in his Coach, by which it appears Buckinghams power
was in: the wane with his old Master, his relation and accusation being
scandalous and false; nor ever durst he bring Bristol to any further trial.

Whether this wound was deeper given by Bristol to Buckingham, or the Prince, I
will leave to the reader to judge, and will not my self determine; And how
Bristol has since stood in favor with the Prince, since he was King, may give
a conjecture, that he took it as a wound to himself, I am sure it was an ill
omen, and has since given him less credit with his Subjects.

And in this Parliament does Buckingham by his underhand Ministers and Agents,
Cranfield accused in parliament
accuse Cranfield the Lord Treasurer, in which the Prince also shows himself:
Cranfield was so hated a fellow for his insolency, that a small accusation
would serve the turn, as this truly was, had his care of expending the Kings
Treasure been out of a true zeal: for it should seem that the Prince sending
for moneys, Cranfield restrained his Express, using some words, that the
journey it self was foolishly undertaken, and now must be maintained by
prodigality, in which the Revenue of the Kingdom would not satisfy their vast
expenses; if this had been spoken out of a Noble mind, or out of that feeling
he had of the Kingdoms misery (as being Treasurer he ought to have done) had
he fallen, it had been with honor and a general compassion, but being spoken
out of the pride and insolency of his own heart, whose mind was ever so base,
as never to discern what Honor was, nor ever had he any other inherent Honor
then what in his Apprentiship he raked out of the Kennel; besides it was known
to be out of hatred, that he was not of council in the undertaking, he then
looking at himself as the only Statesman of all the Council: He fell without
pity, and with much scorn, as I formerly set down; yet left in a higher
estate, and better condition then so worthless a fellow, and base Projector
deserved, yet afterward he was again questioned upon his accounts: But all
this was nothing, himself, and his Posterity being left Peers of the Realm.

In this case was the Prince a principal actour, and did duly keep the
earliest hours to sit in that Parliament, where, then he discerned so much
juggling even to serve his own ends on Cranfield, that it was not much to be
wondered at, being come to be King, he did not affect them: And it was not well
that a Prince should show so much spleen, though Cranfield deserved any ill
could be cast on him, and who knows whether God does now punish by Tallion
Law, to call his own sin to remembrance, and to repent?

In this place I hold it not unfit to show the Reader how the King has ever
been abused, and would be abused, by overmuch credulity, in the treaty of
Spain for marriages, as well as in all other Negotiations.

You shall now perceive how the King was abused in this treaty, which was an
error inexcusable, in himself and whole Council. The Italians having a
Proverb, He that deceives me once, its his fault, but if twice, its my fault:
this second time therefore could not but be the only fault of the King and
Council.

In Prince Henry his life time, the King had a little man, but a very great and
wise Counselor, his Secretary of State, little Salisbury, that great
Statesman, who did inherit all his Fathers wisdom, as well as his Offices,
and the son came little short of the father, who was held the greatest
Statesman in the world, of his time. It is true, that one State may abuse
another, but, not to find out the abuse, is an unpardonable fault in any
Statesman.

There was a treaty in the like case for Prince Henry, Salisbury instantly
discovered the juggling before any other did think of any, for although it
went forward currently, yet did Salisbury so put the Duke of Lerma unto it,
that either it must be so, or they must confess their juggling.

The Duke of Lerma denied that ever there had been any treaty, or any intention
from that State; Salisbury sent for the Ambassador to a full Council, told
him how he had abused the King and State, about a treaty for Marriage, which
he had no Commission for; that therefore he was liable to the Laws of our
Kingdom; for where any Ambassador does abuse a State by their Mrs.
Commission, then the servant was freed; but without Commission, was culpable
and liable to be punished by the Laws of that State, as being disavowed to be
servant to the King his Master: The Ambassador answered gravely, he did not
understand the cause of his coming, therefore was then unprepared to give any
answer, but on Monday he would again come, this being Saturday, and give his
answer. On Monday he comes, begins with these words, My soul is my Gods, my
life my Masters, my reputation my own, I will not forfeit the first and last,
to preserve the second; Then lays down his Commission, and Letters of
instruction, under the Duke of Lerma's own hand: he acquitted himself
honestly to this State, yet lost his own, being instantly sent for home, where
he lived and dyed in disgrace. Here was Legatus vir bonus peregre missus, sed
non ad mentiendum reipublicae causa: And had we had as honest and good
Statesmen, in after times (as Salisbury was, and so demonstrated himself in
this weighty Affair) this State could not have been so abused in all Treaties.

By this you see the advantage and benefit of one wise Counselor in a whole
State; and although Solomon say, By the multitude of Counselors does a
kingdom flourish, yet surely he intended they should be wise men that are
Counselors; for we had such a multitude of Counselors, that a longer table,
and a larger Counsell-chamber was provided, yet our State was so far from
flourishing, that it had been almost utterly destroyed; this was the last
Statesman worthy of that name; and now are the ancient stock of Statesmen
decayed, and with them all our honor and glory.

I shall now bring my Story to an end, as I shall this Kings life; although I
have made some digressions, yet all pertinent to the discourse of this Kings
reign.

He now goes to his last Hunting journey, I mean the last of the year, (as
well as of his life) which he ever ended in Lent; and was seized on by an
ordinary and moderate Tertian Ague, which at that season, according to the
Proverb, was Physic for a King, but it proved not so to him; and poor King,
what was but Physic to any other, was made mortal to him! yet not the Ague,
as himself confessed to a servant of his now living, who cried, courage Sir,
this is but a small fit, the next will be none at all, at which he most
earnestly looked, and said, Ah, it is not the Ague afflicts me, but the black
plaster and powder given me, and laid to my stomach; and in truth, the
plaster so tormented him, that he was glad to have it pulled off, and with it
the skin also; nor was it fair dealing, if he had fair play (which himself
suspected) often saying to Montgomery, whom he trusted above all men, in his
sickness, for Gods sake, look I have fair play) to bring in an Emprick, to
apply any Medicines, whilst those Physicians appointed to attend him, were at
dinner; nor could any but Buckingham answer it with less then his life at that
present, as he had the next Parliament, had it not been dissolved upon the very
questioning him for the Kings death, and all those that prosecuted him, utterly
disgraced and banished the Court.

Buckingham coming into the Kings Chamber, even when he was at the point of
death, and an honest servant of the Kings crying: Ah my Lord, you have undone
us, all his poor servants, although you are so well provided you need not
care: At which, Buckingham kicked at him, who caught his foot, and made his head
first come to ground, where Buckingham presently rising, run to the dying Kings
bed side, and cried, Justice, Sir, I am abused by your servant, and wrongfully
accused; at which the poor King (become by that time speechless) mournfully
fixed his eyes on him, as who would have said, not wrongfully.

It were worth the knowledge, what his confession was, or what other
expressions he made of himself, or any other; but that was only known to the
dead Archbishop Abbot, and the Bishop Williams then also Lord Keeper, and it
was thought Williams had blabbed something which incensed the Kings anger, and
Buckinghams hatred so much against him, that the loss of his place could not
be expiatory sufficient, but his utter ruin must be determined, and that not
upon any known crime, but upon circumstances, and examinations, to pick out
faults, committed in his whole life time; but his greatest crime for the
present, (no question) was lapsus linguae, but quod defertur non aufertur, for
although he escaped by the calm of that Parliament, yet is he more ruined by
this Parliament, and his own folly; and truly we may observe the just
Judgment of God on him, for flying from the Parliament his protector, to give
wicked counsel to the King, his former prosecutor.

And now have I brought this great Kings Reign to an end, in a volant
discourse, and shall give you his Character in brief, and so leave him in
peace after his life, who was styled the King of peace in his life.

THE CHARACTER OF KING JAMES.
THis Kings Character is much easier to take then hi Picture, for he could
never be brought to sit for the taking of that, which is the reason of so few
good pieces of him; but his Character was obvious to every eye.

He was of a middle stature, more corpulent through his clothes then in his
body, yet fat enough, his clothes ever being made large and easy, the
Doublets quilted for steletto proof, his Breeches in great pleits and full
stuffed: He was naturally of a timorous disposition, which was the reason of
his quilted Doublets: His eyes large, ever rolling after any stranger came in
his presence, insomuch, as many for shame have left the room, as being out of
countenance: His Beard was very thin: His Tongue too large for his mouth, which
ever made him speak full in the mouth, and made him drink very uncomely, as if
eating his drink, which came out into the cup of each side of his mouth: His
skin was as soft as Taffeta Sarsnet, which felt so, because he never washed his
hands, only rubbed his fingers ends slightly with the wet end of a Napkin: His
Legs were very weak, having had (as was thought) some foul play in his youth,
or rather before he was born, that he was not able to stand at seven years of
age, that weakness made him ever leaning on other men's shoulders, his walk
was ever circular, his fingers ever in that walk sidling about his Codpiece:
He was very temperate in his exercises, and in his diet, and not intemperate in
his drinking, however in his old age, and Buckinghams joviall Suppers, when he
had any turn to do with him, made him sometimes overtaken, which he would the
very next day remember, and repent with tears; it is true, he drank very
often, which was rather out of a custom then any delight, and his drinks were
of that kind for strength, as Frontiniack, Canary, High Country wine, Tent
Wine, and Scottish Ale, that had he not had a very strong brain, might have
daily been overtaken, although he seldom drank at any one time above four
spoonfulls, many times not above one or two; He was very constant in all things
(his Favorites excepted) in which he loved change, yet never cast down any (he
once raised) from the height of greatness, though from their wonted nearness,
and privacy; unless by their own default, by opposing his change, as in
Somersets case: yet had he not been in that foul poisoning business; and so cast
down himself; I do verily believe not him neither; for all his other Favorites
he left great in Honor, great in Fortune; and did much love Mountgomery, and
trusted him more at the very last gasp, then at the first minute of his
Favoriteship: In his Diet, Apparel, and Journeys, he was very constant; in
his Apparel so constant, as by his good will he would never change his
clothes until worn out to very rags: His Fashion never: Insomuch as one
bringing to him a Hat of a Spanish Block, he cast it from him, swearing he
neither loved them nor their fashions. Another time, bringing him Roses on his
Shoes, he asked, if they would make him a ruffefooted-Dove? one yard of six
penny Ribbond served that turn: His Diet and Journies was so constant, that the
best observing Courtier of our time was wont to say, were he asleep seven
years, and then awakened, he would tell where the King every day had been, and
every dish he had had at his Table.

He was not very uxorious, (though he had a very brave Queen that never
crossed his designs, nor intermedled with State affairs, but ever complied
with him (even against the nature of any, but of a mild spirit) in the change
of Favorites;) for he was ever best, when furthest from his Queen, and that
was thought to be the first grounds of his often removes, which afterward
proved habitual. He was unfortunate in the marriage of his Daughter, and so
was all Christendom besides; but sure the Daughter was more unfortunate in a
Father, then he in a Daughter: He naturally loved not the sight of a Soldier,
nor of any valiant man; and it was an observation that Sir Robert Mansell was
the only valiant man he ever loved, and him he loved so entirely, that for all
Buckinghams greatness with the King, and his hatred of Sir Robert Mansell, yet
could not that alienate the Kings affections from him; insomuch as when by the
instigation of Cottington (then Ambassador in Spain) by Buckinghams
procurement, the Spanish Ambassador came with a great complaint against Sir
Robert Mansell, then at Argiers, to suppress the Pirates, That he did support
them; having never a friend there, (though many) that durst speak in his
defense, the King himself defended him in these words: My Lord Ambassador, I
cannot believe this, for I made choice my self of him, out of these reasons; I
know him to be valiant, honest, and Nobly descended as most in my Kingdom, and
will never believe a man thus qualified will do so base an act. He naturally
loved honest men, that were not over active, yet never loved any man heartily
until he had bound him unto him by giving him some suite, which he thought
bound the others love to him again; but that argued a poor disposition in him,
to believe that any thing but a Noble mind, seasoned with virtue, could make
any firm love or union, for mercinary minds are carried away with a greater
prize, but Noble minds, alienated with nothing but public disgraces.

He was very witty, and had as many ready witty jests as any man living, at
which he would not smile himself, but deliver them in a grave and serious
manner: He was very liberal, of what he had not in his own gripe, and would
rather part with 100. li. he never had in his keeping, then one twenty
shillings piece within his own custody: He spent much, and had much use of his
Subjects purses, which bred some clashings with them in Parliament, yet would
always come off, and end with a sweet and plausible close; and truly his
bounty was not discommendable, for his raising Favorites was the worst:
Rewarding old servants, and releiving his Native Countrymen, was infinitely
more to be commended in him, then condemned. His sending Ambassadors, were no
less chargeable then dishonorable and unprofitable to him and his whole
Kingdom; for he was ever abused in all Negotiations, yet he had rather spend
100000. li. on Embassies, to keep or procure peace with dishonor, then 10000.
li. on an Army that would have forced peace with honor: He loved good Laws,
and had many made in his time, and in his last Parliament, for the good of his
Subjects, and suppressing Promoters, and progging fellows, gave way to that
Nullum tempus, etc. to be consined to 60. years, which was more beneficial to
the Subjects in respect of their quiets, then all the Parliaments had given him
during his whole Reign. By his frequentin^ Sermons he appeared Religious; ye^
his Tuesday Sermons (if you wi^^ believe his own Countrymen, tha^ lived in
those times when they were erected, and well understood the cause of erecting
them) were dedicated for a strange piece of devotion.

He would make a great deal too bold with God in his passion, both in cursing
and swearing, and one strain higher vergeing on blasphemy; But would in his
better temper say, he hoped God would not impute them as sins, and lay them to
his charge, seeing they proceeded from passion: He had need of great assurance,
rather then hopes, that would make daily so bold with God.

He was very crafty and cunning in petty things, as the circumventing any great
man, the change of a Favorite, etc. insomuch as a very wise man was wont to
say, he believed him the wisest fool in Chri^tendome, meaning him wise in
^mall things, but a fool in weighty ^ffaires.

He ever desired to prefer mean men in great places, that when he turned them
out again, they should have no friend to bandy with them: And besides, they
were so hated by being raised from a mean estate, to overtop all men, that
every one held it a pretty recreation to have them often turned out: There were
living in this Kings time, at one instant, two Treasurers, three Secretaries,
two Lord Keepers, two Admiralls, three Lord chief Justices, yet but one in
play, therefore this King had a pretty faculty in putting out and in: By this
you may perceive in what his wisdom consisted, but in great and weighty
affairs even at his wits end.

He had a trick to cosen himself with bargains under hand, by taking 1000.
li. or 10000. li. as a bribe, when his Counsel was treating with his Customers
to raise them to so much more yearly; this went into his Privy purse, wherein
he thought he had overreached the Lords, but cousened himself; but would as
easily break the bargain upon the next offer, saying, he was mistaken and
deceived, and therefore no reason he should keep the bargain; this was often
the case with the Farmers of the Customs; He was infinitely inclined to peace,
but more out of fear then conscience, and this was the greatest blemish this
King had through all his Reign, otherwise might have been ranked with the very
best of our Kings, yet sometimes would he show pretty flashes of valor which
might easily be discerned to be forced, not natural; and being forced, could
have wished, rather, it would have recoiled back into himself, then carried
to that King it had concerned, least he might have been put to the trial, to
maintain his seeming valor.

In a word, he was (take him altogether and not in pieces) such a King, I wish
this Kingdom have never any worse, on the condition, not any better; for he
lived in peace, dyed in peace, and left all his Kingdoms in a peaceable
condition, with his own Motto:

Beati Pacifici. The Court of King CHARLES.
NOw having brought this peaceable King to rest in all peace, the 27th. of
March, his Son, by the sound of the Trumpet, was proclaimed King, by the name
of CHARLES the FIRST.

His Fathers Reign began with a great Plague, and we have seen what his Reign
was; his Sons with a greater Plague, and the greatest that ever was in these
parts; we shall see what his Reign will be, and the effects of this plague have
also hung as a fatal commet over this Kingdom, in some parts, and over London
in more particular, ever since: and we earnestly pray we may not fall into the
hands of men, but rather, ever with that divinely inspired royal Prophet
David, that we fall into the hand of the Lord (for his mercies are great.)

This King was not Crowned with that solemnity all other Kings have formerly
been, by riding through the City in all state, although the same Triumphs were
provided for him, as sumptuous as for any other; this, some have taken as an
ill omen: Its further reported (which I will not believe) that he took not the
ususall Oath all our Kings were bound unto at their Coronation, and its to be
read in Covells book, if so, sure its a worse omen.

One more observation is, of this King, which I remember not to have happened
in any other Kingdom, I am confident never in this; That with him did also rise
his Fathers Favorite, and in much more glory and luster then in his Fathers
time, as if he were no less an inheritor of his Sons favors, than the Son
of the Fathers Crown, and this, as it happened, was the worst omen of all;
for, whereas in the Fathers time, there was some kind of moderation, by reason
he was weary of the insolency of his Favorite; in the sons time, he reigned
like an impetuous storm, bearing down all before him that stood in his way,
and would not yield to him or comply with him: This showed no Heroical or
Kingly spirit, for the King ever to endure him that had put such scorns and
insolent affronts on him in his fathers time.

This King (as his Father did set in peace) did rise like a Mars, as if he
would say, Arma virumque cano, and to that end, to make himself more
formidable to Spain and France, he called a Parliament, wherein never Subjects
expressed more hearty affections to a Sovereigne; and in truth, were more
loving then wise, for, as if for an income to welcome him, they gave him two
entire Subsidies, and in so doing they brake the very foundation and
privileges of Parliament, which never was wont to give Subsidies but as a
thankful gratuity for enacting good Laws, therefore it is but Gods justice to
repay them with Talion Laws, to have their Privileges broken, seeing they
first chalked out the way. The King in requital of this great love of theirs,
did instantly dissolve the Parliament, which has bred such ill blood in the
veins of the Subjects to their Sovereign, and in the Sovereign to the Subject,
that it is like to produce an epidemicall infection.

But the occasion taken to dissolve it was worst of all; for, Buckingham, by
his insolent behavior, had not only lost that love his hatred to Spain had
procured him, but was now grown into such an hatred that they fell on him for
the death of his old Master, which had been of a long time before but
whispered; but now, the Examinations bred such confessions, that it looked with
an ugly deformed poisonous countenance, and nothing but the dissolution of that
Parliament could have saved his dissolution and that with a brand of shame and
infamy, as well as of ingratitude.

I remember I heard a noble Gentleman, an old Parliament man, of that Committee
for Examinations say, at first he derided the very thought of it; but, after
the first days Examination it proved so foul, as that he both hated and
scorned the name and memory of Buckingham; and though man would not punish it,
God would, which proved an unhappy prediction.

This dissolving the Parliament was ill relished by the people, and that which
to them did seem the cause, worse, and to make the case yet fouler, and that
it must needs be the evident cause; Buckinghams Counsels were so stupid and
himself so insolent, that he did think it a glory to disgrace all those that
followed that business, in that Parliament, or that seemed inquisitive
thereafter; and caused many old Servants of the Kings, he formerly favored
very much, to be banished from Court, never to return more, nor did they ever,
as Clare, Crofts, Sir Fra. Stewart, etc. nay Dr. Cragg, his Physician, who from
his very childhood, had the general repute of a very honest man, for
expressing himself like an honest man in the Kings presence, was instantly
dismissed, never could recover his place or favor more.

Now also is Williams, Lord Keeper turned out of his place, and Coventry the
Kings Attorney put in, who (had Buckingham lived) had as soon followed in the
same steps.

Then goes Buckingham into France on a stately Embassy for that Lady the King
had seen, and set an affection on in his passage to Spain, which was obtained
with small entreaty.

Now does Buckingham soar so high both in his Masters favors and in the pride
of his own heart, as he alters all great Officers, makes war against Spain and
France, the quarrel only his, voiced to be on strange grounds, the success
accordingly* Navies, Armies, and nothing but war appears, as if we intended in
show to conquer all that opposed. Lord Wimbleton the General, from whom as
little could be expected, as he performed, carrying a powerful Army to Cales,
after an infinite expense, and drinking much Spanish Wines, and beating out the
heads of what they could not drink, (as if they intended to overthrow that
years trade of Spanish Wine) returned as like a valiant Commander, as he ever
was reputed; whereas, had he brought home those wasted Wines, it may be they
would have defrayed the charge of that expedition.

After the return of that wise Pageantisme, Denbigh is sent into France to
aid Rochell, who managed it better then his great Kinsman, Buckingham, who
would afterward needs go* to do great exploits, for he brought his ships and
men safe again, the other left his men in powdering tubs, as if he meant to
have them kept sweet against his next coming thither: In short, this unhappy
voyage lost all the honor our glorious ancestors had ever gotten over that
Nation, there being so many brave gentlemen wilfully lost, as if that voyage
had been on purpose plotted to disable our Nation, by taking away so many
gallant brave young spirits; so many of our Colors lost, as Trophies of their
Victory, and of our shame, hung up in Nostredame Church, that the brave Talbot,
and Salisbury, with many other our valiant Ancestors, will rise up in Judgment
against him, for that every way inglorious Act. Nay, to how low an ebb of
honor was this our poor despicable Kingdom brought, that (even in Queen
Elizabeth's time the glory of the World,) a great Nobleman, being taken
prisoner* was freely released with this farewell given with him, that they
desired but two English Mastieffes for his Ransom!

But the King by that unnecessary and dishonorable War* was driven to that
exigency for want of money, that he was forced to pawn his rich Cupboard of
Plate to Amsterdam, and to send Cottington into Spain (in a manner) to beg a
peace, which having obtained, it was thought so great a service of him, that it
raised him to all his Honor and Fortunes.

Yet (all the while) Rochell in sharp distress was left unrelieved, although
otherwise intended, or but pretended rather. For the Courting betwixt the Duke
and the Governor of the Isle of Ree, in sending complements and Presents to
each other, showed rather an intimate dearnesse, then any hostility to be meant
between them. And sure I am, the success made it apparent, that their* purpose
was no better than to carry so many goodly Gentlemen, to the Slaughterhouse,
and Powdering-Tub (as even now I instanced.)

Yet was the King so content to be abused, as publicly at his Dinner he
delivered it for a miracle, that having such ill success, there were so few
men lost, for that as many came home as went forth (as appeared by the
Chequer-Rol) within five hundred, At which a Gentleman (whose faithful Valor
prompted him to speak a truth in season, though theirs did not them to fight)
standing at the back of the Kings chair, said, yea, Sir, as you hear, that hear
very little of Truth* But if you please to inquire of such as can and dare
inform you truly, you shall find many thousands fewer came home then went
forth: For which relation this honest Tell-troth was commanded presently from
his Court-Attendance, which doom he never could get reverst, wherein you may
behold the Power of Buckingham with the King, whose Word stood for a Law.

Which Power of his, grew now so exorbitant, he aspires to get higher Titles
both in Honor and Place, as, Prince of Tipperary (a place so called in
Ireland) and Lord High Constable of England (an Office aimed at by that Monster
and Machivillian, Leicester, in Queen Elizabeth's time, but he therein was
crossed and contradicted by the then Lord Chancellor Hatton) now affected by
Buckingham, who herein wrote after Leicesters ambitious example but he crossed
too (by President) with Coventry now Lord Keeper, and no question but upon
those just grounds his Predecessor did: For, you must understand, this Office
has an Authority annexed unto it, to call any Subject in question for his
life, by trying, condemning and executing him, in despite of the King
himself. Nay, some have made no bones on it to affirm, that (for
misgovernment) the King himself is not exempted from that Officers Power;
Politickly therefore did the aforementioned Hatton (who well understood the
validity of such a Power) when Leicesters Commission was in dispute) to tell the
Queen that his own hand should never strike off his own head; which word was
enough to her who was hereat so wise as also in all other matters of
Stateconcernment, wherein as she were hinted to a foresight of any prejudice,
she knew how to prevent it. And thus that ended in his time.

But Buckinghams ambition would not be so bounded; For, upon the opposing it by
Coventry, he peremptorily thus accosted him, saying, who made you, Coventry,
Lord Keeper? he replied, the King; Buckingham, sur-replyed, Its false, 'twas I
did make you, and you shall know that I, who made you, can, and will unmake
you. Coventry thus answered him; Did I conceive I held my Place by your Favor,
I would presently unmake my self, by rendering the Seal to his Majesty. Then
Buckingham in a scorn and fury flung from him, saying, you shall not keep it
long. And, surely, had not Felton prevented him, he had made good his Word.

And before that happened, Weston was, by his power, and for his ends; made
Treasurer, it should seem, upon some assurance from him, that he would find
ways where-out to raise monys into the Treasury (he judging him to be one that
out of his own necessitous condition would adventure on any desperate
projection to raise himself, but yet withal to fill the Chequer Coffers) who
was no sooner warmed in his Office, but he began to show his inbred base
disposition to his Rayser, Buckingham, as formerly he had don to Cranfield, who
was indeed his preserver from perishing in a Prison, whence he redeemed him,
making him a free partaker first of his bounteous Table, then raising him
shortly after to be Chancellor of the Exchequer; who at length, for requital,
supplanted him. But for all this, Buckingham feared not, his high spirit in
himself and vast Power with the King were so predominant and unmovable: He
now therefore used at his own pleasure to come to the Counsel Table (he being
then honored as the Oracle from whom they gaped for all Answers) but ever made
them wait his coming, and were so tutored to their duteous observance of him,
that at his approach or returning thence, they ever must rise as if he had been
the King himself. (So that you may see to what a pretty pass those great men
by their poor spirits had brought themselves.)

But on a time, there issued this amongst other passages of insolences from
Buckingham, who coming into the Council, without any other Court-preface,
says to the Treasurer Weston, My Lord, the King must have 60000l. provided
against to morrow morning. The Lords startled at the mention of such a sum (the
whole Exchequer not haing seen within its keeping scarce 1000l. in many years)
and could not imagine how, unless by the Philosophers stone, such a sum was
possible to be gotten, but yet all looking on Weston (to whom it was in this
case proper to make answer) who bethought himself what to say (the rest every
one, the while, gazing at each other, another while again all at Weston, as a
man of great wisdom, for so was he accounted (of a Plebejan.) At length, up
he stands, and thus he answers Buckingham; My Lord, The Exchequer is in a deep
consumption. Whereat Buckingham interrupts him, saying, How, Sir! You came in to
cure that Consumption, and to restore it to its useful plenitude. I remember
you promised (like a Mountebanke) when you were to be invested by the King, you
would do so, therefore, Sir, see you the money be provided, otherwise you shall
hear further of it. With that high strain he rose up and departed.

Now, are all ways endeavored to get money from the Subjects, which was not to
be gotten by fair means, the King having tried all the shifts which any former
Prince (out of the Parliamentary way) had ever don, and had great sums brought
in, such as none of his Predecessors ever had; of which, one was the Royal
Subsidy, every man lending as much as the sum in the Subsidy toward which he
was assessed: as if (for example) assessed at 40. li. besides so much paid, he
lent also 40. li. and so from the least to the greatest proportions assessed.

Yet all this would not serve him, but that quickly vanished, then all other
fair means proving (as was thought for their profuseness) too s^ant and
slow; Force then must be the last remedy; the King must keep standing Garrisons
to awe his good Subjects, and they consisting too of strangers not of Natives,
To that end, one Dalbier (that had been General of Count Mansfield Horse) is
dealt with for the raising of 1000 or 2000 German Horse, the most whereof to
be quartered betwixt Gravesend and London; For advancing of which service, Sir
William Balfore (as great a Servant and Confident he is now of this Parliament)
was sent to Hamborough with 30000. l. to buy and to bring over those Horse with
their impressed Riders, and Furniture, but many of them ready to be embarked,
it should seem they were told by the way, by some well affected to England,
that the King had not money to continue them in Pay; and Plunder they could not
there, for they should be so environed with Sea, that there was no flying, but
they must expect to have all their throats cut, if they took any thing from any
man: Upon which, those Rascals, out of fear, not conscience, refused to come
over. However, Balfore so well lickt his fingers in that employment, as that he
therewith laid the foundation of his future fortunes; yet, if this Parliament
consider well this action of his, there is no reason he should be so dear unto
them: For, of any thing yet touched upon against any man by this Parliament, I
dare affirm this (of his) to be the greatest piece of villainy, and to be the
nearest way to render us all slaves, and to make us have neither propriety in
our Estates, Wives, nor Children. And yet was this Balfore a principal
undetaker, and actor in this pernicious design, and (perhaps for that very
cause) the greatest creature of Buckinghams that ever was.

In this intervall, their shifts not avayling them; (to see therefore if by
this fair means their ends might be obtained) another Parliament was summoned,
wherein after some expostulations on both sides, there proved no better a good
speed and success then a mere frustration of all hopes on both hands; which
for the Kings part, he apprehended with so great averseness, that, as 'twas
said, he made a vow never to call more Parliaments.

Foreign Forces, and fraudulent and fair devices homespun, failing, all;
now must Projects in all their variegated inventions be (set on foot; to which
sage (or rather rufull) purpose, one Noy, a very famous Lawyer as ever this
Kingdom bred, and (formerly) a great Patriot, and the only searcher of
Presidents for the Parliaments; by which he grew so cunning as he understood
all the shifts which former Kings had used to get moneys with.

This man the King sends for, tells him, he will make him his Attorney Noy (like
a true Cynick as he was) for that time went away, not returning to the King so
much as the civility of a Thanks; nor, indeed, was it worth his thanks, I am
sure he was not worthy of ours. For, after the Court sollicitings had bewitched
him to become the Kings, he grew the most hateful man that ever lived. And its
to me a wonder, that this Parliament of Wonders does not enact a Law, that his
very name should never more be in this Kingdom, he having been as great a
Deluge to this Realm, as the Flood was to the whole World: for, he swept away
all our Privileges, and in truth has been the cause of all these miseries
this kingdom* has since been ingulphed; whether you consider our Religion,
(he being a great Papist, if not an Atheist) and the protector of all Papists,
and the raiser of them up unto that boldness they were now grown unto, who
formerly had some moderation) or, if you consider our Estates and Liberties,
they were impoverished and enthralled, by multitudes of projects, and illegal
ways; this Monster was the sole Author of all.

But first, now because there must be some great man (as a Captain Projector)
to lead some on, and hearten others to follow, Sir George Goring leads up the
March and Dance with the Monopoly of Tobacco, and Licensing of Tavernes,
setting some up, where, and as many as he pleased, and this done by a Seal
appendicular to an Office erected by him for that purpose, as if authorized by
a Law; besides all this, he has Pensions out of the pretermitted Customs:
insomuch as I have heard it most credibly reported, that his Revenue was 9000.
l. per annum, all of these kinds; and for this piece of good service he was
made a Lord, and Privy Counselor, to countenance his train of Projectors the
better.

Then did Weston enhance the Customs, and laid new and heavyer impositions on
all things exported or imported; with such unconscionable rates upon Tobacco,
that millions of pounds of it lay rotting in the Custom House (the Merchants
refusing to pay the Custom) besides loss of all other charges for the Tobacco
it self. In short, there was not any thing (almost) that any man did eat,
drink, or wear, or had in his house from foreign parts, or scarce any
domesticke commodities exempted, but he paid as it were, an Excise for it; yea,
at last, even Cards and Dice escaped not, but they were monopolized by a great
Counselor, the Lord Cottington: yea, (to keep their hands in ure) they got
Patents for the very Rags, Marrow-bones, Guts, and such like Excrements, as
were thought of no use but to be cast on the Dunghils; and he was held the
bravest Commonwealths man that could bring in the most money, (yet, the Kings
private Purse, or public Treasury little or nothing bettered, but) to
impoverish and vex the Subject, and to no other end; for which he was
ordinarily rewarded with honor.

This good service (the quite contrary way) did Weston and Noy do for the
King; and, I believe you shall see God reward them and their posterity; for the
one, like a Jonas Gourd sprang up suddenly from a beggarly estate to much
Honor, and great Fortunes, will shortly wither; the other, his Son and Heir
was killed in France, presently after his death, and when both are dead, let
their names and memory rot* and be extinct from the face of the earth.

Now does Buckingham provide for another foreign Enterprise, (but carried so
close, I could never learn what it was; nor did any wise men much inquire
after it, assuring themselves that such counsels could produce no better
effects than those former.) In the beginning, yea even at the very entrance
thereunto, he did so stink in the Nostrils of God and Man, that God made one
Felton his Instrument to take such a Monster (as he was indeed) from his longer
domineering amongst men, by a blow as fearful as strange, after which he had
not time to say, Lord have mercy on him; a just judgment on him that forsook
God, to seek to the Devil by Witches, and Sorcerers in his life; one whereof
was Doctor Lamb (who was his great defensitive preserver as he thought him)
whose fate it was to be brained by a Shoo-makers Last when he least looked for
it; the other was stabbed the next morning after that night he had caused a
Fellow to be hanged, (not suffering him to have that nights respite (after his
sentence, and offense (what ere it was) to repent him of his sins) with this
vow, he would neither eat nor drink until he see him dye; God, in requital
of his merciless cruelty, would neither suffer him to eat nor drink before
he dyed, by that dismal stroke of a poor tenpenny knife, of the said Feltons
setting home: Thus near alike in time and manner were these two hellish Agents
Catastrophees. And now is set that great Sun (or rather portendous Comet) from
whose influences all the Officers and Ministers had by reflection their life and
heat.

After his death, the very name of a Favorite dyed with him, none singly
engrossing the Kings ear and favor; but, a regular motion was set to all
Officers, as appertained to their several places; as, to the Archbishop, the
mannagement and chief super-intendency of the Church; to the Lord Treasurer,
the Exchequer and the Customs; to the Lords, Keepers of the Great and Privy
Seals, what belonged to equity; to the Judges, what belonged to Law, so that
(one would have thought) all things now went so just and equal, and in their
proper Channel, as none but might now expect from that new and better
government halcyon days.

But, it fared far otherwise, (God being angry at the Nations sins, the
general juggling of the State was one, and a great one) all those procedures
being but in appearance, righteous, nothing really so: but, like the Apples of
Sodom, fair in show, rotten and corrupt within. For, now instead of the late
(but one) Favorite, every great Officer, and Lord of the Council proved a
very Tyrant; and it appeared, that not their virtues, but the former Favorites
power only did restrain them from being so; for, that falling (together with
himself, as you have heard) and they left to their own Arbitrary power; you
would verily have believed that Hell had been broke loose: And to make good
that Metaphor, one of the Council* being told by a Gentleman, that the country
was much troubled at a certain great grievance, replied, Does that trouble
them? by God, there are seven worse Devils to be shortly let out amongst
them. And (in sober sadness) they all might truly have undergone the name of
Legion, for, they were all many Devils, and (like true, Devils) took
pleasure in tormenting. So that hereby may be perceived, the Kingdom in
general had no benefit (though some particular men, as Weston Treasurer,
Coventry Lord Keeper, and all such as paid his beggarly kindred Pensions, which
now were ceased) by this man's death, whose purpose 'twas to have turned out of
place both Coventry and Weston, (before his last intended voyage.) But, now did
Weston begin to be more cruel in Pride and Tyranny than Buckingham had been
before him, and, (had not the Archbishop ( Laud) balanced him) he would have
been more insufferable. He cheated the King in the sale of Timber, and of Land,
and in the letting of his Customs, the Archbishop notwithstanding truly
informing the King thereof; Weston was so mad at the thought of it, he would
often say to his friends (in private) That little Priest would Monopolize the
Kings ear, for he was ever whispering to the King.

And now begin the Council Table, the Star Chamber, and High Commission to be
Scourges* and Tortures of the Commonwealth, by Imprisonments, and Mutilations
of Members; and were made, (some of them) by sinings, the greatest incomes to
the Exchequer; and, in truth, did now put down the Common Laws deciding of Meum
and Tuum. And if any (desiring to appeal from them) refused to stand there to
their censures, they were committed until they would submit thereunto. If men
sent unto by them for money, refused it, they would imprison them till they
would give or lend, and if any were summoned thither they had a mind to
quarrel with, in whom they could not find a fault, they would make one, by
saying, the Gentleman laughs at us: Or, the Gentleman says thus, and thus; it
may be that he had not in his thought, and yet there should not want a false
witness; for, some Lords that sat with their backs toward them, or so far
off that they could not hear, yet would testify either the words or actions;
or, for want of this, a Clerk of the Council should be called to witness,
who, for his profit, must swear what any Lord said: If they hit not upon that
trick, then sometimes they would contrive to put a Gentleman into passion by
calling him some disgraceful name, or by scoffing at him; so that, indeed, the
Council Table was grown more like a Pasquil then a grave Senate. But if the
spirit of the man were such, that he could not take those indignities without
some regret, it was well for him, if he escaped with imprisonment, and not
called Ore tenus to the Star Chamber, and fined (as many were) to his undoing,
for to that point were now the Fines of that Court risen.

As for the High Commission-Court, that was a very ( Spanish-like) Inquisition,
in which all pollings and tyrannizings over our Estates and Consciences were
practiced, as were in the other over our Estates and Bodies.

Then were the Judges so much their Servants or rather Slaves; that what ere
they illegally put in execution, they found* Law to maintain.

But, that which is a wonder above all wonders is, that Coventry, who formerly
had gained the opinion of a just and honest man, was a principal in all these
miscarriages, yet dyed he unquestioned; when, had his actions been scanned by a
Parliament (in that they were not, you may see what opinion is, which in the
multitude blinds the understanding) he had been found as foul a man as ever
lived.

Finch, a fellow (of an excellent tongue but not of one dram of Law, made (for
all that) Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (the only Court most learned in
the Law; yet he brought all the learned Judges, except two only ( Hutton and
Crook) to be of his illegal opinion for shipmony. This surely, must be a
punishment from God on them, and us for our sins, otherwise it had been
impossible so many grave Judges should have been overruled by such a slight
and trivial fellow.

Now also all Officers in all places took what Fees they pleased, as if in a
Iubilee; Amongst the rest those of the Star Chamber, the Council Table, and
the High Commission were very Grandees: Yea, the very Messengers (to them) were
countenanced in their abuse, and insultings over the Gentry (when in their
clutches:) and to such a strange pass were disorders come unto, that every
Lacquey of those great Lords might give a Check-Mate to any Gentleman, yea, to
any Country Nobleman, that was not in the Court favor.

And to fill full the measure of the times abounding iniquity, the Court
Chaplines (and others elsewhere) with the Reverend Bishops themselves, did
preach away our liberties and proprieties, yet kept they Divinity enough for
their own interests: for, they concluded, all was either Gods or the Kings,
their part belonged to God, in which the King had no propriety: Our part
belonged wholly to the King, in which we had propriety no longer, when the King
were disposed to call for them, so that, betwixt the Law and the Gospel, we
were ejected out of Lands, Liberties, and Lives at pleasure.

And now is Gods time come to visit with his Justice; and behold it: For, the
pit they dug for others they themselves are fallen into, for all their
Honors, Lands and Liberties are a gasping (and the Judges are but in very
little better case) for, the Parliament will do that to them by the Law, which
they would have done to us by wresting the Gospel.

But, what needed all that joy for the death of Buckingham! Since the times
succeeding him, have been so infinitely beyond him in all oppression, as they
are like to bring all manner of miseries both upon King and people: So that in
truth, his Hydra's head being struck down, an hundred more instead thereof
appeared, which never durst, in his life time: And as he got much by Suites, so
did Weston, much, by cheating (yet all came out of the Subjects purses) and
Coventry (that so generally a reputed honest man) got such an estate by Bribery
and In-justice, that he is said to have left a Family worth a Million; Which
may commend his Wisdom, but in no wise his Honesty.

And now also dies Weston, after he had first brought in (as, you may remember,
I told you, himself was by Cranfield) Sir Thomas Wentworth (after Earl of
Strafford) the active manager of the State, and sole Governor of the King.

This Strafford, without doubt, was the ablest Minister that this Kingdom had
since Salisburies time; and to speak uprightly, there was not any but himself
worthy of that name, amongst all the Kings Council; yet, I am confident, by
the weakness of that Board, his abilities in State affairs were judged more
then they were; and besides, that very word of Statesman was now grown a
stranger to our Nation: Nor was he as Salisbury, (or our ancient Heroes) a
general Statesman, nor was it possible he should be, he not having that
breeding himself: Nor kept he any upon his charge in foreign parts for
intelligence: Nor had he such a Tutor as the other had of his Father (who was
the most absolute Statesman in the world) whose very Papers (which were left
to this Salisbury, and served as so many rich Presidents, and Instructors to
him) were able (if wanting in abilities of his own) to make him an able
Statesman. But I held Straffords abilities to be more on this side, then
beyond the Seas; yet, might he challenge the title of a good Patriot: And so
indeed, he was, before he turned a Courtier; After that, he converted his
studies, and endeavors, to make the King an absolute Arbitrary Monarch, by
screwing up the Regal Prerogative to so high a strain as has made it crack;
and by raising his Revenues so high that he made them fall; in which also his
own interest was concerned: For, he did neither serve God nor the King for
naught. Nor would Straffords abilities have been so transparent, had any such
Concurrents as Buckhurst, Walsingham, or Hatton been now living, or such an one
as the Earl of Essex (who was Salisburies Antagonist.) But this man had only
the Archbishop (whose proper Element too, was but the Church) and they drew
both in one line. And here I shall give you one note of Straffords failing in
his Masterpiece, that he was no such absolute wise man (that could not find
the just Medium of the peoples Temper) but by striving to make the King all;
and on a sudden, he made the King less, and himself less then nothing. And,
had he been wise, he could not but find the Kings spirit was not to undergo,
nor to go through with great actions, but would fail under them, and crush
the owners: Which he to his lamentable experience has found and felt too true.
Besides, I much doubt Straffords own spirit, that, seeing his wisdom was too
short to protect him, his spirit was so low to fail him, that he did not,
like Sampson, pull down the house upon others heads, but fall (like a tame
fool) himself alone, caught in a gin, and lay still without any fluttering:
When, surely, some others of the Cabinet Council were as deep as himself in
any design.

You have here now seen a great Subject, yea, the greatest that ever our eyes
beheld, that was no Favorite, and greater in his fortunes then many Favorites.

You have also seen a King, the greatest that our Nation ever had, both in
Prerogative, Power, and Revenues, and the most absolute over his Subjects; The
one fallen below the earth, the other so low upon earth, that I wish I could
but see him in the same state his peaceable Father left him, who kept his
Prerogative to the height, without cracking it, because he had able Ministers
and Counselors left, who were of Queen Elizabeth's stock; but this Kings
Ministers strain all so high, that the very ligaments, and nerves of
Sovereignty are quite broken in sunder; I wish them well sothered again.

But because, if I write further, I must tune to a much lower key, I will here
end with my prayers; That, God would give the King a wise Council, and an
understanding heart to be able to give himself Council what will be best for
himself, his Posterity, and the people committed to his Charge: And that he
may discern such as council him for their own private ends, and interest, not
for his Honor and Safety.

And here do I draw a Curtain betwixt the time past, and that to come in this
Kings Reign, desiring it may never be remembered to Posterity.

Observations (instead of a Character) upon this King, from his Childe-hood.
IT being improper to write the Character of Kings before their Deaths (I wish
this were not much nearer the period of his happiness than his death) give me
therefore leave to present unto your view some remarkable observations of this
unfortunate King.

In his very infancy; he was so subject to that wilful humor (still
possessing him) that if any thing crossed him, he could hardly be stilled;
which then they were forced to give way unto, by reason of that extreme
weakness which disabled him (as the like did his Father) until the 7th. year
of his Age, to go, or scarce to stand alone; crawling, (when of himself he
would be in motion) upon all four, in a most unseemly manner: For the recovery
whereof, he was beholding to the skill of one Master Stutavile, an excellent
Artist for strengthening Limbs, and straitning crooked Bodies; but, for the
rectifying his wayward disposition, to the tender care of the Lady Carey,
afterward Countess of Monmouth.

This humor of his principally he took from his Mother, who notwithstanding
was a gallant Lady; nor was he free from it by the Fathers side, though his
timorous nature gave it an allay. His Mother (who loved him so dearly, that she
said, she loved him as she did her Soul, yet) was wont to say, that she must
with grief of heart confess, He was a fool, and wilful, which would
hereafter endanger him the loss of his Crown.

A sad, Censure, yet it should seem Prophetical. But, it were a lesson fit
for all Parents learning, rather to leave their Children to Gods Providence,
than to pry into his office of fore knowledge.

He ever expressed an ill nature, by taking delight to do ill offices to his
Fathers servants, as well as to his own; witness that instance concerning
Master Murrey his Tutor, and Doctor Hackwell placed about him, to instruct him
in the principles of Religion, who (rightly) judging it co-incident to that his
employment, did therefore (upon the Treaty for the Spanish Match) deliver him a
small Treatise in Manuscript, therein intimating his advice and judgment to
inform his Conscience aright, against coupling himself with a Papist, saying
to him, Sir, I beseech you make use of this, by reading it your self, but if
you show it to your Father, I shall be undone for my good will. The Prince
returned him many thanks, and assured him, it should never go farther then
the cabinet of his own breast; but withal, he asked him, to whom he had
showed it? Hackwell replied, the Archbishop (Abbot) has read it, who
returning him it, said to him, Well done thou good and faithful servant.
Besides him, he told the Prince, he had only showed it to Mr. Murrey the Tutor,
who belike being better acquainted with his Masters perfidious disposition then
the other, did then dis-swade him from delivering it to the Prince, for, says
he, he will betray you. And it so fell out, for within less then two hours
after his said engagement to the Doctor, he presents it to his Father; upon
which, he, or any through whose hands and cognizance it had passed before, were
all under a disgrace, and banished the Court (only Murrey was afterward
Provost of Eaton.) Here was an Emblem of his breach of Oaths, and
protestations in future, and of his untrustinesse, which in a subject would
have been called treachery.

Such a one too he showed himself, in the business of Rochell; which, after
his fair promises, and deep imprecations for their relief, and assistance,
wherein they put some confidence, was merely betrayed by him; insomuch that
when the Rochel Agents found themselves abused through their whole years
attendance, they left this bitter jeere upon him, that now they could rightly
call England the Land of Promise.

He seldom loved any but to serve his turn, and would himself serve a turn
to do any mischief, as was to be seen by his saying Amen to every full point
of Buckinghams Accusation in the face of the Parliament against Bristol, for
his miscarriage in Spain; when it appeared by Bristols defense in Public,
before the face of that same Parliament, that there was not scarce one syllable
had any truth in it; who also freely put himself upon the Test, that if there
were any truth in that combined Accusation against him, he would yield himself
guilty of it all.

He was of a very poor spirit, which may be conceived (amongst other things)
by his making Buckingham his Privado, after he came to the Crown; otherwise
would he never have forgotten those unsufferable insolences offered him being
Prince, what they were you have already heard. His Predecessor Henry the fifth
(and so his brother Henry) would have instructed him otherwise; for, although
(its true) noble minds should forget injuries, so as not to revenge them, yet
so, as not to countenance the doers of them, especially to take them into so
much nearness and dearnesse as he did him after those two proud affronts,
which argued in him, as I said before, a poor and ignoble spirit.

He had all his Kingdoms left in peace and tranquillity by his Father, which he
soon after made a shift to distemper by a foolish War upon France and
Spain, and by a more foolish conduct of either ignorant, unexperienced, or
cowardly Commanders. And in truth, if you will give credit to Vox populi, (the
Book so called, written by one Scot) they were suitable to the grounds of such
Quarrels, being no fairer than the satisfying the beastly appetite of his
Favorite, who must be revenged (forsooth) upon those States. In which I admire
Gods Justice, that he who unjustly made War upon unwarrantable grounds, should
have War thus brought home unto him; so that now God has given him the same
measure he has met to others, even full, pressed down, and running over.

I wish I may have a time to give him a fairer Character when he is dead, then
are my observations in his life; but I may rather wish then hope, in that
course he yet continues.

Certain observations before Queen Elizabeth's death.
I Cannot but admire Gods Providence in bringing Peace, when nothing was
thought of but War; and now bringing a cruel War, when nothing could be
expected but peace: Peace with all foreign Estates, peace at Home. Not long
before the death of Queen Elizabeth all the discourse was in a secret
whispering, on whom the Succession would fall; some said, the Lady Arabella,
some the King of Scotland, and reason given pro and con on both sides; they who
were for her, saying, the Lady Arabella was a Native, and a Maid, and that this
Kingdom never flourished more then under a Maidens Reign: Others for the
Scot, said, that the King of Scots was more near to the Crown by descent;
farther off say others, as being a Stranger, and that Nation ever in Hostility
against us. Nor did the King himself believe he should have come in with a
sheathed Sword, which appeared by that Letter he produced of the Earl of
Northumberlands, that if he made any doubt hereof, he would bring him forty
thousand Catholics should conduct him into England. But, the Queen dyed, the
King comes in peaceably, even to the admiration of all Foreign Princes, and
to the gnashing of their teeth; but, the reason was, they had lived in
obedience under a just Sovereigne, who was wont ever to say, when any great man
had oppressed a poor Gentleman that Petitioned her for redress against such
oppression, when all the great Lords and Officers would hold together to
support the Suppressor, and trample upon the oppressed: My Lords (quoth she)
content you, I am Queen of the Valleys as well as of the Hills, and I must not
suffer the Hills to ore-top, nor yet to over-shade the Valleys.

A worthy saying, which if it had been imitated by her Successors, these our
miseries had never happened; but, I say (and this is it I now drive at) her
Justice made her Subjects to believe there could be no injustice in Monarchy;
and that was it did facilitate the Kings peaceable entrance. In that
tranquillity did the Kingdom continue all his days, and about fifteen years
of his Sons Reign: when behold, there was nothing but jollity in the Court, as
if saying to themselves, Who dares molest us? the King having now a plentiful
Issue; for, let me tell you, the Kings Issue made Him and his Courtiers the
more to trample on the country Gentry. But behold, when nothing but peace,
peace, sudden destruction came on them, and us unawares; and God sends such a
War as no man could dream of Now the corollary of all is this, the high
