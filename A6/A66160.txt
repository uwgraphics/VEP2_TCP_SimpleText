His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Monday the
27th of January, 1689.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am so sensible of the readiness you have showed to Supply Me with Money for
the Carrying on the Wars I am Engaged in, that I am glad of this Occasion to
give you Thanks for your Cheerful Dispatch of that Matter, which was absolutely
Necessary for the Common Safety.

The best Return I can make to your Kindness is, to Assure you, That as far as
it will go, it shall all be Employed to the Purposes it was Given.

It is a very sensible Affliction to Me, to see My good People Burdened with
heavy Taxes; But since the speedy Recovering of Ireland is, in My Opinion, the
only Means to Ease them, and to Preserve the Peace and Honor of the Nation, I
am Resolved to go thither in Person, and with the Blessing of God Almighty,
Endeavor to Reduce that Kingdom, that it may no longer be a Charge to this.

And as I have already ventured My Life for the Preservation of the Religion,
Laws and Liberties of this Nation; So I am now willing again to expose It to
Secure you the quiet Enjoyment of them.

The Spring draws on, and it being requisite I should be Early in the Field, I
must immediately apply My Thoughts to the giving Orders for the necessary
Preparations; Which that I may have the more Leisure to do, I have thought
convenient now to put an End to this Session.

Then the Speaker by His Majesty's Command said,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
IT is His Majesty's Pleasure, That this Parliament be Prorogued to the Second
Day of April next; And this Parliament is Prorogued to the Second Day of April
next.
