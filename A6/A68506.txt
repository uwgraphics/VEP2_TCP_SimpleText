No body loves me.
To the tune of Philliday.


NOw all my money is gone, how should I swagger?
Now may I sit alone with wooden Dagger,
Robert and honest John with mine Host K^ster,
Could drink a dozen Cans out of a Tester:
If now I wash my throat^
Needs must I pawn my coat,
And sing this ^ea^ ^^^te,
Nobody loves me*
(...) quoyne lasted,
^^w that my (...)ir love's blasted,
^^^e and he with his (...) kindly,
^^hilst I could pay my (...) me blindly:
Now that I have no C(...),
With the Duckes may I ^^inke,
All my friends from me shrink,
Nobody loves me.
^y Hostis with a smile would entertain me,
Now like a varlet vile does she disdain me
I had the Parlor before (...)ding,
Now in the kitchen I take up my ^^^^ding:
Now all my revel ruff,
Is turned to kitchen stuff,
And I sing, Marry m^ffe,
Nobody loves me.
When as I had no want, each one would lend me,
Now that my money is skant, they say* God send ye:
They leave Pe^^^e-penniles, with high disdaining,
And all are pittiles, to my complaining:
Their words are gilded fair,
Their deeds bace copper ware,
Now I am waxen bare,
Nobody loves me.
Fair Mayds would follow me fast for a fayring,
I was good company, Purse was not sparing:
The finest ^roe in this town, I might have kissed her*
And perhaps laid her down, now I must miss her*
Now that my money is lost,
They bid me kiss the post,
Was ever man thus crossed,
Nobody loves me.
Top of my kin I thought, would not deny me,
When I to ask them ought, strait they pass by me
Naught but old proverbs on me they denter,
Save naught in summer and starve in winter,
Did Proverbs fly about,
No money pull they out,
Their hands have got the gout,
Nobody loves me.
Faith I Will go dig for more and if I find it,
Like rich Cobs hand and foot, fast will I bind it.
And hide it in the hay until it canker,
Then farewell thriftlesse play, and good Ale Tanker:
I Will drink plain whig and whay,
Until my dying day,
Black pots brings all away,
Nobody loves me.
I Will save my money I, to make a purchas^
Or else before I dye, for to build Churces*
Like worldlings every hour will I be scraping,
Or like hell s^il for more will I be gapi^g:
Ere I do spend my coin,
I Will let my Carcas pine,
And eat beans from the swine.
no body loves me.
If I be once rich again. I will be wiser,
And learn of money-men to be a Miser:
Rather then lend a groat to one or other,
I Will help to cut his throat, ^ere he my brother.
I will shut up my door,
Always against the poor:
So Karls do get ^eir store.
No body loves me.
FINIS.

The Second part of No body loves me. A new Ballad that praises good company,
sent unto Peter Ply-pot, and Cutbert Empty-can.
To the tune of Dain^ty come thou to me.
There Is no comparison,
of folly to be made,
To the meaner sort of men,
such as live by their trade:
Vain pleasure so does lead,
their light-braine wits awry,
That spend and bring themselves,
to open beggary.
Company asks cost,
Company wastes gain:
Let him that means to thrive,
Much company refrain.
Such as so wary be,
to spare and not to spend:
Thy wastfull quality,
he shall mock in the end.
For such as have no care,
a penny for to keep:
Shall never be worth a pound,
but live in danger deep.
Company asks cost, etc.
In a torn ragged coat,
commonly shall he go:
His wife with sorrow filled,
his children full of woe.
Their stomach seldom shall
be filled with flesh or fish:
On his board shall be seen,
always an empty dish,
Company* etc.
To the Wine Tavern sure,
and victling house likewise:
You seem to be good friends,
but your own enemies*
For all that you do spend,
no thank they do you give:
But in your beggary,
they laugh to see you live.
Company, etc.
Female content with sin,
for once a day will come,
When you that laugh shall weep,
this is Christ's dreadful doom:
Before Lent fast and pray,
your death you do not know,
Thus ere you do depart,
starve not your souls with woe.
Company, etc.
Though thought will pay no debt.
yet every honest man*
To pay each debt is due,
will do the best he can:
For when a man for debt
in prison ^^^ do^^ lie:
Small help then shall he have
of merry company.
Company, etc.
The merriest man on earth,
is overcome of death:
Repenting with much pain,
his mirth that was so vain.
Blessed may he be and glad,
that for his sin is sad:
Great joy shall be obtain,
in heaven where Christ does reign.
Company, etc.
Since vain all pleasures are,
then void loud company:
Good company there is is none,
but in Gods Church alone*
Silver and gold will rust,
and friends will prove unjust:
Let then thy pleasure be,
to sing Christ's verity.
Company, etc.
The best fellowship I say,
is for to spend the day
Among thy family,
at thy work merrily.
Then happily shall thou speed,
having corn at thy need:
Full well then may thou fare.
thy purse shall nere be bare.
Company asks cost, etc.
The world may justly then
teach all such foolish men,
To provide while they may.
against their sickness dey
And cease their Alehouse songs,
the which their credit wrongs,
Leading more civil lives,
with these true wedded wives.
FINIS.
