Short Writing, Begun by Nature Compliated by Art

Manifesting the Irregularity of placeing the Artificial before the Natural or
Symbolical Contractions: And Proposing a Method more suited to Sense and more
fully answering ye Requisites of a Complete Character in the shortning both of
Words and Sentences.

The Explanation of the Title and Method viz. Shortwriting begun by Nature etc.
The Common Methods teach to write first by the Letters and Vowels Places. This
is Irregular for the Reasons premised in the Four first Arches of the Book and
is apparently prejudicial to the Learners progress by dissaffecting him at the
first Entrance with the longest way of Writing, whereas he should have that to
begin with which might take with his sense, and encourage him with alacrity to
proceed. The only way I know of to effect this, is, First to instruct the
Learner in the ready expressing of Words by their Natural and Proper Emblems,
which ought to be ranked Alphabetically, and the Character for each letter
prefixed. This is the Method that I have taken to Initiate and fasten
Beginners. Of these Emblems I have set down the following Instances by which
the Learner being put in the way, will more readily apprehend and get the rest.

For The Character for A: ^
About a tittle above A ^ About A. brought about ^ Christ went about ^ He went
about ^
For The Character for B: ^
Belong B. is made long ^ Below a little below B ^ Between a little between ^
Break break the B ^ Bow down B. is bowed down ^
For The Character for D: ^
Divide. D: is divided ^ Christ divided ^ Church divided ^ Discover. D: is
covered ^
For The Character for E: ^
Establish, E: is Established ^ Church Established ^ Enter: into a stroke
Enters ^ Even, heaven ^ Enter: into heaven ^ etc.

By this Method those yt. have learnt others Hands may greatly improve
themselves. In short, The Book contains Three Parts, of which the Emblems are
the First. The Second shows how Words not Expressible by Emblems may be
Regularly and Concisely written. The Third teaches a new Invention for the
more effectual Contracting of Sentences like Words. In all which I have aimed
at Brevity. Perspicuity, and relief to the memory by affecting the Sense and
Reason. These Three Parts are included in 36 Columns In the Arches and Heads of
which are Observation for the Learner first to peruse and then get the
Characters in the order they are placed till the whole be finished, which may
be dispatched in about a weeks time, but must afterward be improved by daily
and constant writing The Psalms of the Bible are fit to begin with. And in the
writing let the letters be kept fair and distinct, and no long hand mingled
with it. If any desire to be instructed in this Art, or to have further
direction in it, they may hear of me at the Widow Heli.'s upon the Wair in
Bristol.

The First Part. Showing how words and Sentences are expressed by significant
Emblems, concerning which observe: If all words could be written by significant
Emblems it were more pertinent and compendious then any other way of Writing.
Alphabeticall writing is only useful to supply what cannot be written by a
shorter method: Therefore that sort of Charactery is best reserved until yt which
is more compendious and delightful be past through This Table needs not much
direction, where ye Learner is only to observe, how the sense of ye word is
represented by the Character. Note where any Emblem depends upon a Letter of
the Alphabet I have set it in the Front to Ill ustrate it. This Stroke ^ when
it stands through a character, signifie^ some hurt: a: in (a) it is afflict ^
in (b) burden ^ (c) corrupt ^ and As for these Clauses (of) God of Christ of
Man, of the World, see them more fully explained in Column 13. 14 The Marks for
about, down, up, to, and fro. etc. do stand for Go about, went about, go down
or come down, etc. Where any single mark is put for two or more words, they are
such as the sense will easily distinguish in the reading. For the Plural number
write a tittle underneath: Doctrine (^) mercies (^) masters (^) Kingdoms (^)
The Learner must beware of adding any Emblems that will not square with the
whole body of ye Characters.

The Improvement of the former Table by useful endings for the contracting of
Sentences.
The Learner may observe in the former Table how several Clauses of Sentences
are contracted by marks set either on the top or under the Character where note
the marks set on top are as follow For of God or ye ^ Lord a tittle ^ for of
Christ this ^ of man this ^ of mankind the ^ of men and women ^ of the Soul ^

of the world this mark (^) placed underneath which are fully exemplified in
the Table particularly in the Letter E

The same marks do stand for in God or with or to God or the Lord and with
Christ as the foregoing word shall dictate

Proper Endings for the enlarging of any word of the Table as occasion is.
Marks for the completing of words

For the Negatives im, m, ir, un, make a tittle in the beginning Impatient ^
indifferent ^ irreverence ^ ub-beliefe ^ uncertain ^ Thus write Circumvert ^
dislike ^ impart ^


Marks set on the top for ye ending of words for ation a tittle. Conversation ^
ministration ^ tribulation ^
Thus write these Fashion ^ Passion ^ fashion of ye world ^
The same for otion motion (^) notion (^)

For able, ible, this (^) Corruptible ^ infattible ^ imaginable ^ remarkable ^


How other words not inserted in the Table may be contracted by the same
endings. How the marks for words and Sentences do consist, when they meet in
one Clause.
Thus write these Able ^ cable ^ sable ^ table ^
the same for ible oble iple or ople Bible ^ noble ^ couple ^ double ^ disciple
^ people ^ disciple of Christ^ people of God ^
For ity this Contraricty ^ samiliarity ^ individuality ^
Thus write these City (^) pity (^)

The same for ighty uty, duly (^) mighty (^)

Thus write these Payment ^ raiment ^
The same for oment moment ^ indument ^
For Son, sion, a tittle within as Afflictions ^ ascentions ^
Corruption ^ destruction ^ distinction ^ contradiction ^
Thus write Version ^ Circumcision ^ thousand ^


When the Endings for words and Sentences meet write them thus Advancement of
Christ ^ Manifestation of God to man ^ Establishment of the Soul ^ Government
of the World ^


Other endings of words which are written in a direct Line For ance write (^)
for ed ^ for est^ for eth ^ for ing ^ for full ^ for ness ^ mercifullness ^


What more Example do occur of this kind Words or Sentences let them be written
in a Book.

The Second Part, showing how words may be regularly written, contains the
Alphabet, the Consonants and Vowels
The Alphabet with the words signefied by each Letter
A ^ Away B ^ be but D ^ did, did E ^ evil F ^ for full G ^ god good H ^ how I
^ just K ^ keen L ^ lord M ^ much N ^ now nature O ^ of P ^ peace Q ^ question
R ^ ra. re. are S ^ as is his T ^ il that V ^ your W ^ which word X ^ excellent
Y ^ you Z ^ zion


For the Letter C) write (K) or (S) according to the Sound of the word

S is often turned over with a head thus (...)

Places For the furtherance of speed, some Consonants are this shortened which
are called Contacts.
The Contracts
ch ^ Christian el ^ carnal, conelius nd ^ and end ndl ^ handle ng ^ thing ngl
^ angle ne ns ^ ance, ence sc ^ scarce sl ^ stand stance th ^ them


Examples of words written by the joining of other Letters with the Contracts
Bth ^ Both del ^ declare fnd ^ find found frth ^ fourth fth ^ faith fathers
kth ^ catholic nsr ^ answer nth ^ nothing rth ^ earth ser ^ scribe scripture
sgn ^ signify trth ^ truth with ^ with
Thus write Ends (^) Ending (^) Heaven and earth ^ Nothing in ye world ^ kl
or cl ^ Kr or cr ^


The rest of the Consonants are two or more Letters of the Alphabet regularly
joined together. First observe, what Letters are joined in the Character, then
learn the words signified by them. Some marks stand only for the parts of
words: as car cor, mes, mis, per, rec, sah, sol, whose use see Column 23
The Table of Consonants where note this mark (r) stands for com or con

The usefulness of the parts of words inserted in both Tables, Exemplified
Explained
Words Contracted by the joining together of Parts
As to write Substance join the mark for Sub and stance together thus (^)
Circumstance ^ compare ^ consume ^ distribute ^ contempt ^ forwardness ^
purpose ^ reform ^ subvert ^ transcribe ^ perform ^ remain ^


Where the joining of the Parts brings the words out of Square write them
asunder Deserve ^ pasture ^ misrepresent ^ superscribe ^
Long Words
Impardonable ^ indissoluble ^ incompatible ^ condesecution ^
transubstantiation ^


Additional parts of words, both for the beginning and end, with Examples of
words written by them
For pra, pre, in the beginning of a word write this (^) for pro pru this (^)
Prepare ^ present ^ preserve ^ preseribe ^ promise ^ propose ^ procure ^
improve ^ reprove ^
For ject in the end make this (^)
Project ^ reject ^ subject ^ For fication ^ Justification ^ Sanctification ^
glorification ^ For prehend ^ apprehend ^ corruprehend ^ reprehension ^ For
Sense ^ Insence ^ insensible ^ conscience ^ conscientions ^ presence of God ^


The five Vowels are not to be expressed by their own Characters, unless when
they begin a won but are understood by Places.
The Vowels places a e i o u

a e i o u

When a word ends with a Vowel pur a tittle in the place of it ba, be, ^ ra re
^ by, ^ ri ^ bo, bu ^ to, ru ^


When a word ends with a Consonant set it in the Vowels place Thus
bad, bed ^ ran ren ^ bid ^ rin ^ bod, bud ^ ron, run ^


Note so many Consonants as come togetehr without a Vowel betwee^ them are to
be written without taking of the Pen Clinch ^ France ^ strange ^ scrape ^ dandl
^ chang ^ crumbl ^ thu^^ ^ blunt ^ sealed ^ sword ^ plung ^ cramp ^ spurn ^
Glattering ^ supremacy ^ stubborn ^ plaiflered ^ botstering ^


Examples of long words written by the Alphabet alone, and also in conjunction
with other parts of Words
Thus write
Alexander ^ Jonathan ^ Jeconiah ^ Garnaliel\ ^ Methusela ^ Solomon ^ Barnabas
^


Sometimes a word is begun with a part and concluded by the Alphabet as
Compelling ^ desired ^ discipline ^ disoblige ^ discourage ^ mercenry ^
perplexing ^ misapplie ^ suboraed ^ suffering ^


Sometimes a word is begun with the Alphabet and concluded by some part
Defends ^ defending ^ fraternity ^ derinative ^ molestation ^ raseallition ^


Note, no more Letters, Vowels or Consonants are to be expressed in this Art,
then what will suffice to sound the word.
When two like Consonants meet in a word, let the first only be expressed. Dinner
(^) Folly (^) The same for Vowels meeting in one Syllable as Frail (^) Suit (^)

Unlike vowels meeting in distinct Syllables are thus written Diet (^) Viol (^)
Leave out as follows b. after m Lamb ^ c before k back ^ d before g lodge ^ g
before n knock ^ u after g guide ^ u after q quick ^ w. before r wrong ^ w
after a saw ^ w after o lom ^ y. after a day ^


Pharo (^) Philip (^) H may be left out in these and such like Help ^ Hope ^
the ^ thy ^ humble ^ inhabit ^


X contracts words as Flocks ^ Action ^ facts ^ Succes ^


Examples of words contracted by ye moission of Vowels and parts of words in
the beginning, without hurt to the Sound
The expert Learner may omit Single Vowels in the beginning of words: as
Abomination ^ adversary ^ endeavor ^ enemy ^ israel ^ omnipotent ^ ornament ^
ultimate ^ usurp ^


Except when two Vowels come together then ye first is to be written as Aim ^
Oil ^ our ^ out ^


Likewise when two like Consonants immediately follow a Vowel Adder ^ Error ^
arrow ^ utler ^
Or when a word is drawn long as Open. (^) Ale. (^)

Ac, ad and ap, are to be omitted in these words. Acquaint ^ advantage ^
appropriate ^
And such like

The Third Part, teaching a New and more expedite may for the Contracting of
Sentences by ye Prefixes, the Tenses and the Persons with their Places. Note,
the Rarity of these Contractions is, that they do not burden ye Memory with
any other Marks or Rides then what are used for words.
The Table of Prefixes, which are in Sentances like ye Consonants to begin words
After ^ again ^ all ^ allwaies ^ among ^ and ^ as ^ al ^ before ^ because ^
beside ^ better ^ beyond ^ else ^ especially ^ either ^ ever ^ except ^ first ^
further ^ future ^ here ^ and if ^ but if ^ if so be ^ likewise ^ neither
another ^ never^ nevertheless ^ notwithstanding ^ often ^ otherwise ^ soon ^
such ^ then thence ^ one, one ^ there ^ therefore ^ this ^ though ^ thus ^ til,
until ^ what ^ what if ^ when whence ^ where ^ wherefore ^ while ^ except ^ yet
^ yet if ^


How (as) is to be written then il is redoubled As great as ^ as much as ^ as
often as ^ as soon ^


The Tenses or Times, which do resemble ye Ending Consonants
Active
do do does ^ did did ^ have have has ^ had had ^ shall shall ^ will ^
wilt ^ may may ^ can ^ would would ^ could could ^ should should ^
might might ^ must ^ ought ^
Passive
am ^ is ^ art ^ are ^ was were were ^ have been have b. has b. ^ had b. had
b. ^ shall b. shall b ^ will b. wilt b. ^ may b. ^ may b. ^ can b. ^ would b.
would b. ^ could b. could b. ^ should b. should b. ^ might b. might b.
^ ^^st b. ^ ought to b.^


The Six Persons which are in Sentences as Vowels were in words. I ^ we ^ thou
^ ye you^ he ^ they ^


Contractions. made by the joining of the persons and Tenses, together with the
Negative ( Not) and such Verbs as usually follow them
In the beginning of a Sentence ye Persons and Tenses may be united thus:
I do ^ we do ^ thou do ^ you do ^ he does ^ tha do ^
etc:

For (not) place a tittle within or upon ye tense
I was not ^ we must (...) ^ I can not ^ ye shall nt ^ tha are not ^ thou d^st ^
^ you must not be ^ he has not been ^
So write all ye Persons and Tenses in order. Likewise the Tenses will unite
with these Particles. It that such, there, this, those, thus, where, which,
whether as, it does ^ there did ^ such has ^ that will^ He ought not ^ there
will not ^


Contractions of Verbs
For (give) this (^) I will not give ^ for (make) this (^) I cannot make ^ for
(say) this (^) He did not say ^ for (take) this (^) I will not take ^ that
cannot be taken ^ he could not be made ^


The Places of the Persons and manner of expressing Interrogatives, and
placeing of the Tenses in Order
The places of ye Persons are according to the sound of their Vowels. tha he,
we j thou, you.

tha he we j thou, you



Note the place for we and you is somewhat more distant from ye Letter then he,
and thou Thus write these Interogatives:
do tha ^ does he ^ do we ^ do I ^ do thou ^ do you ^


Note, as in words the Consonants were set in the Vowels places: So in
Sentences the Tenses are to be put in the Persons places about ye Presixes
thus: After tha do ^ After he do ^ After we do ^ After I do ^ After thou do ^
After you do ^
In like manner may all ye other Tenses be placed, about this and other
Prefixes After Tha did ^ After he did ^ After we did ^


The manner of placeing the Tenses after many complete Verbs Likewise a Rule
for Verbs of Motion
In like manner may the Tenses be written after these Verbs.

Believe, condude, consideer. declare, grant find, expect, hope, acknowledge
perceive, suppose, thin, understand. As for instance: Belie^^
tha do ^ he does ^ we do ^ I do ^ thou do ^ you do ^
The rest the Learner may write out in order: as, I believe tha did (^) etc

All verbs of Motion are understood by their Particle, as in the ninth Arch:
After tha went away ^ After he went away ^ After we went away ^ After I went
away ^ After thou went away ^ After you went away ^
If tha go not down ^ If he go not down ^ If we go not down ^ If I go not down
^ If thou go not down ^ If go not down ^ If you go not down ^


The use of this Third Part may be seen in the underwritten Contractions, by
which ye Learner may frame all others of ye like nature
If a man have not ye Spirit of Christ he is none of his ((...)) Through much
tribulation you must enter into ye kingdom of heaven (...) I understand he has
not been with you a longtime (...) (...) acknowoledgeth he could not come from
the place where he was (...) Better you had not been born, then that you should
continue as you are (...) this is a breach of ye commandment of God (...)
