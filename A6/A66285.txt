MARIE R.

THeir Majesty's taking into most serious Consideration the continued War, in
which Their Majesty's (together with most of the Princes and States of Europe)
are Engaged against the French King; And that upon the Success thereof the
common Safety of this Realm does, under God, wholly depend; And putting Their
Trust in Almighty God, that he will vouchsafe a special Blessing on Their
Majesty's Righteous Undertakings, and Consummate the Deliverance of these
Nations, by Settling the same in a firm and lasting state of Peace, Security
and Prosperity: Have thought fit to Appoint, and do, (by and with the Advice of
Their Privy Council hereby Appoint and Command a General and Public Fast and
Humiliation, to be Observed throughout this Realm of England, Dominion of
Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, in most Devout and Solemn manner, for
Supplicating Almighty God for the Pardon of our Sins, and for Imploring his
Blessing and Protection in the Preservation of Their Majesty's Sacred Persons,
and Prosperity of Their Arms both at Land and Sea, to be Religiously Kept and
Observed on Friday the Eighty Day of April next, and thenceforth on the Second
Wednesday of every following Month during the present War. And for the more
orderly Solemnizing of the said several Fast-Days, Their Majesty's have given
Directions to the Right Reverend the Bishops of this Kingdom, to Compose a Form
of Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be Used in all Churches and Chapels,
and other Places of Public Worship; And have given Charge for the Dispersing
thereof through their several Diocesses in the whole Kingdom. And Their
Majesty's do most expressly Charge and Command, That the said Fastings and
Prayers be Soberly, Reverently and Decently Performed by all Their Loving
Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon pain of such
Punishments, as Their Majesty's can justly Inflict upon all such as shall
Contemn or Neglect so Religious a Work.
