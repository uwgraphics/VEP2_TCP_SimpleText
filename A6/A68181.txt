The names of this Island Capitulo. j.
FIrst as Galfride says this land was named Albion after the name of Albyne
the oldest daughter of Diocleslan / and had xxxij. sustres / And they were
first that enhabited this land / And because she was the oldest suster she
named this land Albion after her own name as the cronicle reherseth / Other
say that this land was named Albion as it where the white land of white
rocks about the clines of the sea that were seyne fro far Afterward Brute
conquered this land and callid it Brytayn after his own name Then Saxons or
englisshmen conquered this land and callid it Anglia that is England / Or it is
callid Anglia of a queen that owed this land that was named Angela and was a
noble dukes daughter of the Saxons / Or as ysid seyth ethi. xv. Anglia has
that name as it were an angle and a corner of the world Ozels as Beda says li.
j. Saint Grectorie saw englissh children to selle at Rome and he accorded to
the name of the land / and said they ber, sothly anglis / for there face
shyned as angels / for the noblede of the land shone in the children faces /
Alfre. The brittyssh anglia is cleped the other world / and for great plente of
all good the great Charles called it his own chamber / Solinus. The edge of
the frenish clif should be the end of the world / if the ylonde of britayn ne
were not / which is worthy to have the name of an other world / Alfre. This
Ilonde is callid insula for it is in salo / that is the sea / and is beten of
with diverse course of waters with stremez and with wawes of the sce

Of the setting boundyng length and bread of this land Ca. ij
THis britayn is acounted a noble land both in our stories and also in the
stories of greeks / and is set ayenste Germania. Gallia. France and spain
bitwene the north and the west and the sea bitwene / This land is fyfty mile
from the clyf of the men that he called morini gessorico / Beda li. j. And for
this Ilonde lies under the north head of the world / hit has light and
bright nyghtes in the somer time / So that often time at mydnyght men have
questions and doubt wethir it be even tide or dawyng / that is for the time of
the year that the son goth not fer under the earth by night / but passes by
the north side and comes sone in to the este again / And therefore in the somer
ben there days full long of xviij. hours / And the nyghtes of vj. hours And
after in the winter ben long nyghtes of xviij. hours / and short days of vj.
hours Also in armenia macedonia Italia and in other lands of the same line
the lengest day and lengest night also is of xv. hours / and the shortest day
or night is of ix. hours Plius in meroe / that Ilonde is chief of black me^ /
there is the lengest day xij. hours / In alexandria in egypt of xiij. hours /
In Italia of xv. hours / In Britayne of xviij. hours / In the Ilonde named
Tylem all the vj. somer months is day / and all the six winter months is
night / Ysido. li. xiiij. Britayne is set within Ocean as it were without
the world / and is set against france and spain / Giraldus Britayne is
endlong and larger in the myddel than in thendes / Orous / Britayne stretches
in length out of the south in to the north / and in the southest side / hit
has france in the south spain / In the north norwey / and in the west
hibernia that is Irlonde / when shipmen passen the next clyf of that land they
see a cite that heet rutpi mouth / Beda li. j. That cite is now called shortly
of englisshmen Reptacestre / Solinus / Britayne is viij. C. mile of length /
and it be moten from the clyf of Totenesse to the angle of Calidon / Alfre.
That is from pen withstrete xv. mile beyond michels stowe in cornewaille /
unto Catenesse that is be yonde scotland / and Britayne is more than ij. C.
mile broad from meuenia that is the vttemest place in wales unto yarmouth in
norffolke / Beda Only outake the lengest out sheting of diverse forlondes with
the which Britayne is all about xlviij. sith lxx thousand paas

Of the worthynes and prerogatives Ca. iij
IS france passes Britayne so Britayne passes Irlond in feyr weder and
noblete / but not in health / Beda li. j^ For this Ilonde is best to bring
forth trees and fruit / Ruthern and beestis / And wyn grows therein in sum
place The land has plente of fowls and of beestis of diuerce manner kind /
The land is plenteuous and the sea also / The land is noble copious and rich
of noble wells and ryuers with plente of fisshe / There is great plente of
small fisshe of samon and of celes / Wilhel. de pon^. li. iij. So that the
people in sum place fedeth their swyne with fysshe / Beda libro primo / There
ben oftymes taken Dolphyns / See calves / and balaynes great fysshes as whales
kind / and diverse manner shelfysshe / among which shelfysshe ben muskles
that within hem have Margeri peerles of all manner of color and hew of rody
and read purpure and of blewe / and specially and most of white There is also
plente of shellefysshe that men dyen there with fyn reed / the redenes there of
is wonder fair and stable / and steyneth never with cold ne with hete with
weet ne with dry / But ever the older the color is the fayrer / There ben also
saltwelles and hot wells / there of rennen stremes of hot bathes departed in
to diverse places according / for man and woman of all manner age old or young
/ Basilius seith that the water that renneth and passes by wynes of certain me
talle takes in his course great hete / This Ilond is plenteuous of wynes of
metuls / bras of yren / of led / of tyn / and of silver also. Plius libro vj.
ca. vj. In this Ilonde under the turf of the land is good marle founden / the
thryfte of the fatnes dries him self therein / So that ever the thikker the
field is marled / the better coin it wole bear / There is also anothir manner
white marle / that the land is better four score year that there with is marled

Solinus In this Ilonde grows a stone that is callid gagates if ye will know
his fayrnesse / it is black as gemmes ben / If ye will know his kind / hit
brenneth in water and quenchith in oil and as to his might / if the stone be
froted and chauffed hit holdelth what him neygheth as succuns a stone that is
so named / Ysidorus libro decimoquinto. There ben sheep that berin good wulle /
There ben many hertes and wild bestes and few wolves / therefore sheep ben the
surer without keeping left in the field R / In this Ilonde also ben many atees
and towns fair and noble and rich / many great rivers and stremes with great
plente of fysshe / many fair woods and great / with right many bestes tame
and wild / The earth of that land is copyous of metal oor / and of
saltwelles / of quareyes of marble of dmerse manner stones / of reed of white of
soft and of (...) / of chalk and of white lyme / There is also white clay and
reed for to make pottes / crokkes / stenes / and other vessel and burnt tyle
to couere with houses and chirches / as it were in the other samia / that is
named samos also / Flaundres loves well the wulle of this land And holand the
skynnes and felles of all manner of bestes / Guyan the iron and the leed /
Irlonde the oor and the salt / All Europa loves and desires the white metal
of this land / Alfredus / Britayne has ynow of matter that there needs to bye
and selle / or is needful to man's use / there lacks nethir salt ne iron /
Therefore a versifiour in his meter preyseth this land in this manner / England
is a good land fruytfull of wolle / but it is a corner / England is full of
pleye / fre men / well worthy to pleye / fre men / fre tongues / fre hertes /
and fre ben all their things / their hand is more fre and better than their
tongue / Also england is beauteuous of land / flour of lands all about that
land is full paid with fruit and good of his own / that land releueth
strange men that has need thereto And when honger greueth other lands that
land fedeth hem / That land berith fruit and corn good ynouh That land is
well at cese / as long as men live in pees / Est and west in each land / ben
known well the hauenes of england / her ships foundes and often helps many
lands / their mete and money / men have there more common always / And for to
learn men gladly give yeftes In land and stronde / wide speak men of england /
land honey milk chese this Ilonde thereof shall bear the prise / This Ilonde
has no need to other lands / all lands must seche help at this allone /
Of the lykyng of their woun / might wonder king solomon / the richesse that
there is an / would desire Octauian

Of the meruailles and wondres Ca. iiij.
IN Britayne ben hoot wells / well arrayed and a dressyd to the use of mankind
/ maistresse of thilke wells is the great spirit of minerua / In her house the
fire endures always that never changes in to ashes / but there the fire
slaketh / hit changes in to stone clottes / Alfre. In Britayne ben many
wondres nethebes four ben most wonderful / The first is at pecto^ there
blows so strong wind out of the chynes of the earth / that it casts up
again clothes that men cast in The second is at ston henge besides
saleofbury / there ben great stones and wonder huge and ben rered an heygh as it
were yates / so that there famen yates set upon other yates / Netheles it is
not known clerly ne aperceyued how and wherefore they hen so arered and so
wonderfully honged The third is at cherdhoke / there is a great holownes
under earth / often many men have walked therein and have seen rivers and stremes
/ but nowher can they find none end / The fourth is that rain is seen
raised upon hills and anon yspronge about in the feldes / Also there is a
great ponde that conteyneth lx. Ilondes couenable for men to duelle in / that
ponde is biclipped about with vj. score roches / and upon every roche an egles
nest / And lx. Ryuers rennen in to that ponde / and none of hem all run in to
the sea but one / There is a ponde closed about with a wall of tyle and of stone
/ In that ponde men wassh and bathe well often / And every man fel^th the water
hoot or cold right as he will him self / There ben salt wells fer from the sea and ben salt all the weke long unto saturday none and fressh fro saturday
none unto monday / The water of these wells when it is soden torneth in to
small salt fair and white Also there is a ponde / the water thereof has wonder
wirchyng / for though all an host stood by the ponde and turned their face
thidderward the water would draw him violently toward the ponde and wete all
their clothes / so should horse be drawn in the same wise / And if the face be
turned away fro the water / the water noyeth not / There is a well that no
streme renneth fro / nethir thereto / and yet four manner fisshes be taken
therein / that well is but xx. foot long and xx. foot broad / and not deep
but to the kne / and closes with high banks on every side / In the country
about wynchestre is a den or a cave / out of that cave blows always a
strong wind / so that noman may endure to stand to fore that de^ne or cave
Therre is also a pond that torneth tree in to iron if it be there in a year /
And so trees ben shapen in to whestones / Also there is in the top of an hylle
a buriels every man that comes and meteth that buryel / he shall find it even
of his own bengthe and mesure And if a pilgrym knele thereto / anon he shall
be all fressh and feel no grief of werynes / Gir. in top. Fast by the mynster
of wyn burney that is not fer fro bathe / is a wode that bears much fruit if
the trees of that wode fall in to water or ground that is neyh and lie there
all a year / the tre^ tornen in to stones / Gir. in itinere vuder the cite of
chestr(...)enneth that river dee / that now departs England and wale (...)
changed every month his fordes as men of the country ^^llen / and leueth often
the chanel / but whether the water draw more toward England or toward wales to
what side that it be / that year men of that side have the werse end and be
ouersette / And men of that other side shall have better end and ben at their
above / when the water so chaungith his course hit bodeth such happes / This
river dee renneth and comes out of a lake that hete pymblemere / In this
river is great plente of samon / netheles in the lake is neur samon founden /
Wilhel. de re. li. ij Take heed how great light and brightness of gods
myldenes has be showed upon Englisshmen / since they turned first to right
believe / So that of no men in one prouynce ben founden so many hole bodies of
men after her death in lyknes of euerlastyngnes that shall be after the day of
dome / as it well seems in these holyiseintes / Edeldrede Edmonde / the king
Elphege / Edgar Cutberd and seint Edward and many other / I trow that it be do
by special grace of god Almighty for the nation that is set as it were
without the world should take heed to buryng of bodies without corrupcion and
roting / and ben the more bold and steadfast for to trust on the fynall
arysing of deed bodies for to last evermore after the day of dome

Of the chief parties of the land Ca. v
AFter the first Brutes time the Ilonde of Britayne began for to have the
principal parties that been loegria cambria that is wales / And Albania that is
now scotlond ^oegria had that name of locrinus that was Brutes oldest sone /
and heet loegria as it were locrinus land / bnt now loegria is called england
/ The bounds and merkes were thereof sometime the frenssh see both by eest and
by sonth / Beda li. j. ca. ij. And by north two arms of the sea that breketh
fer in to the land either against other / But they reche not to gydres / the
eest arm of thylke tweyne begins about a two li^^ll mile fro the mynstre
of Ebburcuring In the west side of penulton in that arm is a town that is
called Guydy / The west arm of thilke tweyne has in the right side a strong
cite that heet Alcliud which in her langage is called Clirtstone and stands
upon a river that is called Clynt also / R / Sum men would mean that loegria
ends at humbre / and stretches no ferther northward / The second party of
Britayne is called Albania that is scotland and has that name of Albanactus
brutes sone and stretches fro the forsaid two arms of the sea north ward unto
the sea of Norwaye / Netheles the south parties of Albania where as pictes
duelled sometime / lies from the water of twede unto the scottissh see / All
that longed sometime to the kingdom of Northumberland brenicorn the northside
of Northumberlond fro the first time of englissh kings / to that time when
kynadius king of scotland that was Alpinus sone did away the pictes / and so
Joined that country to the kingdom of scotland The third party of britayne
is wales wallia that heet Cambria also / and had that name Cambria of Camber
Brutes sone / for he was prince of wales / In the cest side Seuarn departed
sometime bitwene england and wales / Bnt now in the northside the river dee at
Chestre / and in the south the river that is named vaga at the Castle of
strigelin departs england and wales / Also king Offa for to have a
distinction for evermore bitwene the kings of england and of wales made a
long dyche that stretches forth out of the southside by Bristow under the
hills of wales northward and passes the rivers Seuarn and dee almost to the
heedes and unto the mouth of the river dee beyond Chestre fast by the castle
it renneth bitwene colehill and the mynstre of basingwerk in to the sea / This
dyche is yet in many places seen / In seint Edwardes time walsshmen should not
pass that dyche with wepen upon a great pain / And that was at earl haroldes
procuring as it shall be said here after / But now in either sides both
ayondhalf and a this half the dyche and specially in the shyres of Chstre of
Srowsbury and of herford in many places ben Englisshmen and walsshmen medlyd to
gydres

Of the Ilondes thereto adjacent Capitulo sexte.
BRytayne has three Ilondes that been nygh and longen thereto all without the
Ilondes orcades / as it were ansuering to the three chief parties of britayne /
For the I Will of wight longs and lies to loegria that is england / The Ilonde
Mon that is called Angeseya also longs to wales / and the Ilonde Eubonia that
has two other names and is called Menaiua and man al so / which longs to
scotlonde / And all these three Ilondes wight Mon and Man ben almost yliche
much / and of the like quantite of the which three all arewe now folo weth our
speech / Beda li. j. ca. iij. Claudius sense vaspasianus and vaspasianus wan
wight and wight stretches out of the eest in to the west xxx. mile long /
And out of the south in to the north xij. mile / and is in the eest side six
mile fro the south clyf of Britayne / and three mile in the west side / Beda li.
iiij. ca. v. The mesure of this Ilonde as Englisshmen guess is a M. housholdes
and two hundred / Gir. in itinere. Mon that is called Angleseya also is
departed from north wales by a short arm of the sea as it were ij. mile broad
In mon ben iij. C. tounes lxiij. and ben aco^pded for ca^dredes yt ben iij.

Candredus is so much land as co^teyneth an C. tounes / y^ name candredus is
made out of two langages of brittissh and of Irissh in praising of this Ilonde
walsshinen be wonde to say a proverb and an old saw / mon mam kembry / that
is to say in englissh / that land is so good that it seems that it would
find corn ynow for all the men of wales Therefore virgyls uses may be acordyng
thereto / as much as gua was / bestes long Inneth dawes / So much efte /
brings cold dew in a night / In that arm of the sea that departs this
land and north wales / is a swolow that draws ships to it that saylleth by
and swoloweth hem in / right as does Cilla and Caribdis that been two perilous
places in the sea of myddell earth / Therefore men may not saille by this swalow
/ but slyly at full see / R Of the meruaylles and woundres of the Ilond Mon
thou shall find to fore in the chapitre of wales / Gir. in itinere / The third
Ilo^de that is called both Eubonia and Menauia that is man ston / death in the
myddell bitwene the Irissh vlster and the scottyssh galle way / as it were in
the nauel of the sea / Beda li. ij. ca. ix. This Ilonde man conteyneth as it
were two Ilondes / The first is southward the more country and the better corn
land / and condeyneth ix. c. and lx. housholdes. The scconde condeyneth the
space of CCC. and moo as englisshmen guess / Gir. in top. Sometime was strife
wether this Ilonde Man should long to Brytayne or to Irlonde And for as much
as venomous woemes that were brought the der lived there / It was Iugged that
the Ilonde Man should long to Briteyne / R / In that Ilonde is sortilege and
wicchecraft used For women there selle to shippmen wind as it were closed
under three knottes of threde / so that the more wind he wole have / the mo
knottes he must undo / There often by day time men of that land seen men that been deed to fore hond beheded or hoole and what death they deyde Aliens set
their feet upon feet of the men of that land for to see such sightes as the
men of that land done / Beda li. ij. Scotts duelled first in this Ilond /
Thanatos that is Tenet and is an Ilonde besides kente / and has that name
Thanatos of death of serpents / for there ben none / And the earth thereof
sleeth serpents yborn in to other lands / There is noble corn land and
fruytfull / Hit is supposed that this Ilonde was balewed and blessed of saint
Austyn the first doctor of englisshmen for there he arrived first

Of the kyngis hye ways and streets. Capitulo septimo.
MOliuncius king of Britons was the xxiij. of hem and the first that yaf hem
law / he ordained that plowmen solowes / gods temples and heygh weyes that
leden men to citees and tounes should have the fredom of socour / so that every
man that went to any of the^ for socour or for trespaas that he had do / should
be sauf for poursute of all his enemies / But afterward for the weyes were
uncertain and strif was had / Therefore Belinus the king that was the forsaid
Moliuncius sone for to put away all doubt and strif / made four high kings
weyes priueleged with all priuelege and fredome / And the weyes stretche through
the Ilonde / The first and gretese of the four weyes is called fosse / and
stretches out of the south in to the north / and begins from the corner of
cornewaille and passes forth by deuenshyre by somersete and forth besides
Tetbury upon Cotteswold beside couentre unto Leycestre and so foth by wild
pleynes toward newerke and ended at lincoln / The second chief kings high
way is named watlingstrete and stretches thwert over fosse out of the
southeest in to the northwest / and begins at dover and passes by the
myddell of ken'te over teinse beside london by west westmestre and so forth by
seint Albon in the west side by donstaple by stratford by towcetre by wedon by
south lylleborn / by atheriston unto Gilbertes hille that now is called wrekene
and forth by seuarn and passes besides wrokcestre and then forth to stratton
and so forth by the myddell of wales unto Cardykan and ends at Irissh see /
The third way is called Erynnugestrete and stretches out of the west
norweste in to eest southest and begins in meneuia that is in seint david's
land in weste wales and stretches forth unto southampton / The fourth is
called Ryken yldestrete and stretches forth by worchestre by wycombe by
byrmyngeham by lichefeld by derby by chestrefeld by york and forth unto
tynmouthe

Of famous Ryuers and stremes Ca. viij
Three famous rivers rennen through Britayn by ye which three Ryuers marchaunts
of beyond the sea comen in ships in to Britayne well neyh out of all manner
of nations and lands / These three Ryuers ben Temse / Seuarn and hu^bre / The sea ebbeth and flows at mouths of these three Ryuers and departs the three
prouynces of the Ilonde as it were the three kingdoms asondre / The three
parties ben / loegria / Cambria and Northumbria / that been middell england /
wales and northnmberland / R / These name temse seems made one name of two
names of two rivers that been tame and yse / for the river tame renneth besides
dorchestre and falls in yse / therefore all the river fro the first head unto
the eest see is named Tamyse or temse / Temse begins besides tetbury that is
three mile bynorth malmesburx / There the temse springs of a well that
renneth cestward and passes the fosse and departs Gloucestre shyre / and
wylshyre / and draws with him many other wells and streemes and wexeth great
at grecestre and passes forth than toward hampton and so forth by Oxenford by
wallyngford by redyng and by london / Wilhelmus de pon^. ca. ij. At hauene of
Sandwhiche hit falls in to the eest see / and holds his name forty mile
beyond london / and depar^^d in somplace kente and essex westsex and mercia
that is as it were a grete-dele of middell england / R / Seuarne is a river of
Batayne and is called habern in britone and has that name habern / of habren
that was Estrildes daughter / Gue^dolon the queen drenched this habren therein /
therefore the britons called the river babren after the woman that was drowned
therein / but by corrupt latin it is called sabrina Seuarn in english Seuarn
begins in the myddell of wales and passed first toward the eest unto
shrowesbury / and then torneth southward unto briggenorth wircestre and
gloucestre and falls in to the west see besides bristowe and departed in
sum place england and wales Wilhel. de pon^. li. iiij. Seuarn is swyft of
streme / fisshe craft is there in / wodenes of the swolewynge and of whirlyng
water casts up and gadrith to hepe great hepes of grauel / Seuarn often
arises and ouerflowrth the banks / R / Humbre has that name of humbre king
of hunes for he was drowned therein And renneth first a crook out of the
southside of york / and then it departed the prouynce of lyndeseye that
longed sometime to the merces from-the other country northumberland / Trente and
ouse rennen in to humbre and maken the river full great Treuisa / The merces
were men as it were of myddell england as it shall be said here after

Of ancient citees and tounes Ca. ix.
THe kingdom of britayne was sometime made fair with xxviij. noble citees
without right many castles y^ were walled with toures with yates and with
bars strongly builded / Alf^^. These were the names of the citees / ^^^lud
that is london / Caerbranc / that is york / Caerkente / that is Caunterbury /
Caergoraugon that is wircestre / Caerlirion that is leycestre / Caerclon that
is Gloucestre / Caercolden that is Colchestre / Carrei that is Chichestre /
Saxons called it sometime Cissoncestre / Caerceri that is C^^cestre / Caerguent
that is wynchestre / Caergraunte / that is Cambrygge / Caerleyll that is
luguba^^a and Krarlyll / Caerperis that is porchestre / Caerdrom that is
dorchestre Caerludcoit that is lincoln and lindecolin Ca^rmerthyn that is
merlins cite / Caersegent that is sicestre and is upon Temse not fer from
R^dyng / Caerthleon that is Caerlegion also and hight first leg^cestre and now
is named Chestre Caerbathon that is Bathe and hightr sommetyme Athamannus Cite
/ Caerpaladour that is septon that no whighte Shaftesbury / R / Other citees
hen founden in cronyks for understanding of stories / of whom it shall follow /
Wilhel. de pon^. London is a riall and a rich Cite upon Tamyse / of burgeysses
of richesses of marchaunts of chaffare and of marchandyse / Therefore it is that
sometime when derth of vitails is in all England commuly at london it is best
chepe because of the byars and sellars that be^^ at london / Gaufre. Brute the
first king of Batons builded and edefied this Cite of london the first cite of
Britayne in remeinbraunce of the Cite of Troy that was destroyed and called it
Troyene weth and trinouantum that is new Troy / Afterward king lud called it
Caerlud after his own name / therefore Britons had great indignacion as Gildas
tells / Afterward Englisshmen called the Cite london / and yet after that
Normans called it loundres / and is named in latin londonia / Rudhudibras king
^eyles sone was the viij. king of Britons / he bylded Caunterbury the chief
Cite of kente / and called it Caerkente / Afterward englisshmen called it
dorobernia / but that is not dover that stondeth upon y^ clyf of the Frensshe
see And is from this dover xij. Englissh mile / Afterward this dorobernia was
and is called Caunterbury / The same king Rudhudibras builded wynchestre and
called it Caerguent / And after Englisshmen called it went and wynchestre
after the name of one wine an Englisshman that was bisshopp there / all west
saxon was subgrtte to him / the same king bylded palodour that is S^p^on / that
now is called Shaftesbury / Britons tellen that an Egle prop^^cied there
sometime / Bladud beyles sone a nigro man^^r was the ix. king of Britons / he
bylded Bathe and called it Caerbadun / Englisshmen called it after Athamannes
cite / but at last men called it bathonia that is bathe / wil^^l. de pon^.
li. ij. In this cite welleth up and springs hot bathes and men wene that
Julius cezar made there such bathes / R / But Gaufe^. moan mutensis in his
britons book seyth that Bladud made ^hilke bathes because that william has not
seen that britons book wrote so by tellyng of other men / or by his own
g^essing as he wrote other things not best auisedly / Therefore it seems more
sothly that bladud made not the hot bathes / n^ Julius cezar did such a deed
though bladud bilde and made the cite / but it accords better to ^^endly
reason that the water renneth in the earth by veins of b^y ms^on and sulphur
and so is kendly made ^oot^ in that course and springs up in diverse places of
the cite / And so there ben ^oot bathes that wassheth of tetres foores and
skabbis / Treuisa / Though men might by craft make hot bathes for to dure
long y nough this accords well to reason and to philosophye that treteth of
hot wells and bathes that been in diverse lands though the water of this bath
be more trobly and sourer of savor and of smelle than other hot bathes ben
that I have seen at akon in Almayn And at Eyges in sauoye / which ben fair and
clear as any cold well streme / I have been bathed therein and assayed them / R
/ Claudius cezar married his daughter to Aruiragus king of britons / This
Claudius cezar bilded gloucestre in the weddyng of his daughter Britons called
this cite first after Claudius name / but afterward hit was called glouc^stre
after one glora / which was duke of that country / and stondeth upon seuarn in
the march of England and wales / Shrowesbury is a cite upon seuarne in the
march of england and wales. y set upon the top of an hylle / And it is
called shrowesbury of shrobles and fruit that grew there sometime on that hille
/ Britons cleped it sometime pengwern / that is the head of a fair tree /
Shrowesbury was sometime the head of powesie that stretches forth thwert over
the myddell of wales unto the Iussh see / Notyngham stondeth upon trente and
sometime heet Snotyngham that is the wonnyng of dens for the danes duel ^^d
there sometime and dygged dens and caves under hard stones and rocks and
dnelled there / R / Lyncoln is chief of the prouynce of lyndesaye / and was
callid sometime Caerludcoyt / and afterward lyndeoolyn / It is uncertain who
bilded first this cite but if it were king lud / and so it seems by menyng of
the name / for Caer is britissh and is to say a cite and coyt is a wode / and
so it seems that Caerludcoyt is to say luddes wode tounekyng ^dgar come

Of prouynces and shyres Ca. x.
Take heed that england contryneth xxxij. shyres and prouynces that now ben
called erldoms reserved Cornewayle and the Ilondes Alfre. These ben the names
of the erldom and shires / Kente Southsex Sotherey Hampshire Barokshire that
has his name of a bare ook that is in the forest of wyndesore / for at that
bare ook / men of that shire were wont come to ged^es and make their tretis /
and there take counceyll and aduys / Also wyldshyre that heet sometime the
prouynce of Semeran / Somersete / Dorsete Deuenshyre that now is called Deuonia
in latin / These ix. southshyres the Tamyse departed from the other dele of
england which were sometime governed and reuled by the westsayons law /
Eestsex myddelsex southfolk northfolk hertfordshyre huntingdon shyre
Northampton shyre Cambriggeshyre / Bedfordshire Buykynghamshire Leycestreshire
Derbyshire Notingham shire Lyncolnshire Yorkshire Durhamshire Northumberland
Caerleylshire with Cumberlond Appelbyshire with westmerlond / Lancastershire
that conteyneth fine litell shires / These xv. north and Eestshires were
sometime governed and reuled by that law which is called danelawe But Oxenford
shire warwykshire gloucestreshire wircestreshire herfordshire shropshire
staffordshire chestreshire These viij. myddell and west shires were sometime
governed and reuled by the law called Mercia in latin and merchene law in
englissh / It is to wete that yorkshire stretches from the River of of humbre
unto the river of Teyse / And yet in yorkshire ben xxij. hondredis hundred and
candred is all one / Candred is one word made of walssh and Irissh / and is to
menyng a country that conteyneth an hundred touncs / and is also in englissh
called wepentak / for sometime in the coming of a new lord / tenauntes were
wont to yield up her wepen instead of homage / Duramshire stretches from the
River Teyse unto the river of Tyne / And to speak proprely of Northumberlond it
stretches fro the river of Tyne unto the river of Twede that is in the
beginning of scotland / Then if the country of Northumberland that was
sommetyme from humbre unto twede be now acounted for one shire and one Erledome
as it was sommetyme / Then ben in England but xxxij. shires / but if the
contre of Northumberland be departed in to vj. shires / that hen Euerwykshire
Duramshire Northumberlond Caerleylshire Appelbyshire and lancasshire / Then
ben in england xxxvj. shires without Cornewayle and also without the Ilondes
/ King william conqueror made all these prouynces and shires to be descreued
and moten / Then were founden xxxvj. shires and half a shire / Tounes two and
fifty thousand four score Parissh chirches xlv. M. and two / Knights fees
lxxv. M. whereof men of religion have xxviij. M. xv. knights fees / But now
woods ben hewn down and the land new tilled and made much more than was at
that time and many tounes and villages bylded / and so there ben many mo
villages and tounes now than were in that time / And where as before is wreton
that Cornewayle is not set among the shires of England / it may stand among
them well enough / for it is neither to wales neither in scotland but is in
england and Joins to deuenshire And so may there ben acompted in england
xxxvij. shires and an half with the other shires.

Of kingdom of bounds and merkis bitwene them Ca. xij
THe kingdom of britayne stood without departing hole and all one kingdom to
the britone from the first brute unto Julius cezars time / and fro Julius
cezars time unto Seuerus time this land was under tribute to the romans
Netheles kings they had of the same land from seuerus unto ye last prince
gracian successors of britons failled and romans reigned in britayne /
Afterward the romans left of her regning in britayn because it was fer from
rome / and for great besinesse that they had in other side / Then scotts and
pictes by misleding of Maximus the tyrant pursiewed britayne and werred therein
with great strength of men of arms long time unto the time that the saxons
come at praing of the britons against the pictes / and put out Gurmonde the
Irissh king with his pictes and the britons also with her king that heet
Careticus and drofe hem out of england in to wales / and so the saxons were
victours / and every prouynce after his strength made he^ a king / And so
departed england in to vij. kingdom Netheles afterward those vij. kyngdoms
every after other come all in to one kingdom all hool under the ^nce
adelstone / Nevertheless the danes poursued this land fro Adelwolfis time that
was Aluredes fader unto the third seint Edwardes time about C. ixx. year that
reigned therein continuelly xxx. year After the danes the iij. seint Edward
reigned therein xxiij. year and a litill more And after him harald held the
kingdom ix. months / and after hem Normans have reigned unto this time / But
how long they shall regne / he wot / to whom no thing is unknown / R / Of
the forsaid vij. kingdoms of her merkes meres and bounds when they began and
how long they endured here shall I some what shortly tell / Alfre. The first
kingdom was the kingdom of kente / that stretches fro the cest Occean unto
the Fyuer of Tamyse / There reigned the first hengistus And began to regne by
the aco^pting of dionise the year of our lord cccc. lv. that kingdom dured ccc.
lviij. year under xv. kyngis unto the time that baldrede was put out and egbert
king of westsaxon Joined ye kingdom to his own The.ij. kingdom was of
southsaxon yt had in the est side kente in the south the sea and the I Will of
wight in ye west ha^pshire and in the north sothery there ella reigned first with
his three sons / And began to regne the year after the coming of the angles
even xxx. But that kingdom within a short time passed in to other kyngdoms /
The thrydde kingdom was of eestsaxon / and had in thee est side the sea / in
the west the country of london / in the south Tamyse / in the north southfolke
/ The kings of this country estsaxon fro the first sebertes time unto the time
of the Danes were ten kings which were subget somdell to other kyngis /
Netheles oftest and lengest they were under the kyngis of Mercia / and unto
that time that Egbert king of westsaxon Joined that kingdom to his own / The
fourth kingdom was of eest anglis and contained Norffolk and suffolk / and
had in the Eest side and in the north the sea / in the northwest Cambrigeshyre
/ in the west seint Edmondes dyche and herfordshire / And in the south Estsex /
This kingdom dured under twelve kyngis unto the time that king Edmond was
slain / And then the danes took wrongfully both the kyngdoms of eest anglis
and of Eestsaxon / Afterward the danes were put and driven away or made
subgette / And the elder king Edward Joined both the kyngdoms to his own /
The fyfthe kingdom was of westsaxon and dured lengest of all these kingdoms /
and had in the eest side sonthsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the south and
west the sea Oxcean / In that kingdom reigned Serdrik with his sone kenryk and
began to regne the year of our lord. v. C. xix. and after the coming of angles
lxxj. so seyth denis the other kingdoms passed in to this kingdom / The sixte
kingdom was of mercia and was grettest of all / The markis and the meres
thereof were in the west side the riner dee fast by Chestre and seuarn fast by
Shrowesbury unto Bristowe in the este / the eest see / in the south Tamyse unto
london / In the north the river humbre And so westward and douneward unto the

see / Penda wibbes sone reigned first in this kingdom / in the year of our lord
Ihesu crist vj. C. xxvj. so seyth denis / And fro the coming of angles an C.
lxxv. year / This kingdom dured under xviij. kings about cc. lxiij. year
unto the last Colwulf / to the which Colwulf the danes betoke that kingdom
to keep / when Burdred the king was put out / but the elder Edward the king
put out the danes and Joined the kingdom of mercia to his own kingdom
Netheles at beginning this kingdom of mercia was de^^rted in three in west
mercia / in myddell mercia and est mercia The vij. kingdom was Northambimbror^
that is the kingdom of Northumberlond / the meres and marks thereof were by
west and by eest the sea of Occean by south the River of humbre and so
douneward toward the west by thendes of the shires of notingham and of derby
unto the river of Mersee / and by north the scottissh see / that heet forth in

of Northumberland was first deled in two prouynces / that one was the south
side and heet deyra / and that other was the north side and heet brenicia / as
it were two kyngdoms / And the river departed these two kyngdoms that time /
for the kingdom of deyra was from the River of humber unto the river of Tyne /
The kingdom of brenicia was fro tyne to the scottissh see / And when pictes
duelled there as Beda says li. iij. ca. ij. that Ninian that holy man

/ he made subgette the kings danes scottissh and walssh / and reigned first
allone in England and held the kingdom of england all hool and all one
kingdom that was the year of our lord v. ij. C. xxvij. That river of Mersee
was sometime the mark and mere bitwene the kingdom of mercia and the kingdom
of Northumberlond / that may be showed in two manners / first by the properte of
this mersee / that is as much to say as a see that is a bound and a mere for
it departs one kingdom from anothir / Also it is write in croniks of henry
and of Alfrede / that king Edward the elder fastened a castle at mamcestre in
Northumberlond / but that Cite mamcestre is fro the River of mersee scarly.

Of bisshopriches and of their see^ Ca. xiij
Lucius was the first king cristend of the britons / in his time were three
archebisshops sees in Britayne / one was at london / ^nothir at york / and the
third at Caerusk the Cite of legions in glamergone / that Cite now is called
Carleon to these archebisshops sees were subgette xxviij. bisshops and were
called flammes / to the archebisshops see of london was subgette Cornwaill and
all myddell england unto humbre / To york all northhumberlond from the bow of
humbre with all scotlond / To Caerleon all wales / there were in wales vij.
bisshops and now ben but four / Tho seuarne departed england and wales /
wilhel. de pon^. li. j. but in saxons time though seint gregory had granted
london the priuerege of tharchebisshops see Netheles seint Austyn yt was sent
in to england by seint Gregory turned tharchebisshops see out of london in to
Caunterbury / After seint Gregory's day at prayer of king athelbright and
Citezeins and burgeyses of Caunterbury / there tharchebisshops see has dured
unto now save that in the mean time Offa king of Mercia was wroth with men of
Caunterbury / and benam hem that worshipp / and worshipped Adulph bisshopp of
lichfeld with the archebisshops palle by assente of Adrian the Pope upon ^^as
by yeftes send / Netheles under kenulph the king it was restored to
Caunterbury again The worshipp of the sea of york has dured there always and
dured yet though scotland be withdraw fro his subjection by passing of time /
Gir. in itinere libro primo / The archebisshops see was ytorned out of
Ca^rleon in to Meneuia that is in the west side of de mecia upon the Irissh see
in seint david's time under king Arthur / From seint david's time unto sampsons
time were in Meneuia archebisshops xxiij. Afterward fill a pestilence in all
wales of the yelow evil / that is called the Iaundis And then ^^^^son the
Archebisshopp took with him the palle and went in to britayne Armonica the
less Britayne and was there bisshopp of do leusis / From that time unto the
first harryes time king of England were at meneuia which is called seint david's
xvj. bisshops all without palle / whether it were for uncunning or for pouerte
/ Netheles always fro that time the bisshops of wales were sacred of the
bisshopp of meneuia of seint dauies / and the bishop of meneuia was sacred of
the bisshops of wales as of his suffrigans and made no profession ne subjection
to none other church / Other bisshoppes that come afterward were sacred at
Caunterbury by compelling and heest of the king / in token of that sacryng and
subjection boneface archebisshopp of Caunterbury that was legate of the cross
song in every Cathedral church of wales solempnly / Amas he was the first
archebisshop of caunterbury that so did in wales / and that was done in the
second harryes time / R / But now ben but two primates in all england of
caunterbury and of york / To the primate of Caunterbury ben subget xiij.
bisshops in england and four in wales The primate of york has but two
suffrigans in england that been the bisshops of Caerleyll and of durham / Of all
these sees and chaunyng of her places I shall show you her following Take heed
in the beginning of holy church in england bisshops ordained their sees in
low places and simple that were couenable for contemplacion for prayers and
devotion / But in william co^querours time by dome of law Canon it was
ordained that bisshops should come out of small tounes in to great Citees /
Therefore was the sea of dorchestre changed to lyncoln / lychfeld to chestre
Tetford to Norwych / Shirborn to Salisbury / wells to Bathe / Cornwayll to
Exestre / and selesey to Chichestre / The bisshoppe of Rochestre has no
parissh but he is tharchebisshops chapelayn of Caunterbury / Since the sea of
Caunterbury was first ordained by seint Austyn / it changed yet never his
place / Chichestre has under him only southsex and the I Will of wight / And had
his see first in selesey in the time of tharchebisshopp Theodore / And the sea
dured there CCC. xxxiij. year under xx. bisshops fro the first will frede unto
the last stygande / at commaundemeut of king william conqueroure changed the sea fro selesey to Chichestre

De episcopis occidentalibus / Wilhelmus.
Have mind that all the prouynce of westsaxon had always one bisshopp fro the

prouynce of westsaxon / fro that time the cite and the sea of dorchestre
perteyned and longed to the prouynce of mercia / for that Cite stondeth within
Temse / And the Temse departed bitwene mercia and westsaxon / After that
agilbert was put out of wynchestre that tho hihte wynton / There waz there an
englissh bisshopp there that was called wine / Sum men suppose that the Cite
has the name of this wine / and is called wynchestre / as it were wynes Cite /

Afterward in elder Edwardes time to these two sees were ordained by
commandment of formosus the pope three other sees / At wells for somersete /

HEre take heed that as the kingdom of mercia was always greteest for the time
/ so it was deled in mo bisshopriches and specially by great heart by king offa
/ which waz xl. year king of mercia / he changed the archebisshops see fro
canterbury to lychefeld by assent of Adrian the pope / Then the prouynce of

longed tho to Englong dured many years under ten bisshops / unto that it had no
power by destroyng of the pictes / The sees of hagustald and of lindeffar was
sommetyme all one under ix. bisshops about four score year and ten and dured
unto the coming of the danes In that time under hyngar and hubba Ardulf the
bisshopp yede long about with seint Cuberts body unto king Aluredes time king
of westsaxon and the sea of lyndeffar was set at kunegestre that is called ku

the yvij. year of king Egbert king edgaris sone that see was changed to durham

utterly The first king henry the ix. year of his regne made the new see at

him / It is fullx contained with Inn about the year of our lord Ihesu crist
a. M. lxxij. to fore the first king william / and the bisshops of England by
commaundeinent of the pope / the cause was handled and y treated bitwene the
forsaid primates / and ordained and demed that the primate of york shall be
subget to the primate of Cannterbury in thingis that longen to the worship of
god and to the believe of holy church thereof / of the which seyth Beda li.
iiij. ca. xj. that Sexnulfus was first bisshopp there. But Beda seyth li. iiij.
ca. xxiij. that lyndeff^rn church is an Ilonde that is called haly Ilonde in
the river thwede next berwyk / And so it is gadred of Bedaes Sawes that twede
renneth in to the famous arm of the sea that now deperteth english men and
scotts in the eesthalf / and in that arm ben three Ilondes / That one is
Mailros that now is called menros / Then above toward the west is lyndeffarn
chirch that is called haly Ilonde Then the third is above upward and is the
Ilonde farne / and is called also farny Ilonde / Then upward above that two
mile is a ryall cite upon the brinke of twede / that sometime he^hte Bebanbourgh
y^ is bobles cite / and now is called bamburgh and has a right strong castle
/ Gir. in itinere / Two citees there ben either is called Caerlegion and
Caerleon also / Oon is Demecia in southwales that is named Caerusk also / there
the river vske falls in to seuarne fast by Glamorgan / Bellinus king of
britons sometime bilded y^ cite and was sometime the chief cite of Demecia in
southwales / Afterward in Claudius cezars time hit was y called the Cite of
legyons when at prayer of Genius the queen Vaspasianus and Aruiragus were
accorded and legyons of rome were sent into Irlonde tho was Carleon a noble
cite and of great auctorite and by the romans rially bild and walled about
with walls of f^^nt tyle / Great nobley that was there in old time is there
yet in many places seen / as the great palayses gyantes toures / noble bathes /
releef of the temples places of theaters / that were places hye and riall to
stand and sit in / And to behold about / the places were rially closed
wtth riall walls that yet somdele stondeth right nyhecloos / And withinne the
walls and without is great bildyng under earth / water condytes and weyes
under earth and stews also thou shall see wonderly made with strayt side weyes
of brething that wonderly cast up hete / In this cite were sometime three noble
chirches / one was of seint Julius the martyr and there in a great company of
virgyns / That other was of seint Aaron / that was of the order of black
chanons / that chirch was right nobly adourned / The third church was the
chief mother chirch of all wales and the chief see / But afterward the chief
see was turned out of that cite in to Meneuia that is seint dauyes land in
westwales In this Caerleon was Amphibalus y born that taught seint allone /
There the messagers of rome come to the great Arthurs court if it is ^^effull
to trow Treuisa / if Girald was in doubt whether it were leeffull for to
trow it or no / hit were a wondre sweu en as men would wene for to have
evermore in mind / and ever be in doubt if all his books were such what
lore were therein and namely while he makes non evidence / for in neither side
he tells what moeueth him so for to say / R / There is another cite of
legions there his cronike was bytrauailled as it is clerly known by the first
chapitre of this book / Treuisa / y^ is to understanding in the latin writing /
For he that made it in latin turned it not in to Englissh / ne it was turned in
to englissh in the same place that it was first in latin / The understanding of
him that made this cronik is thu^ wreton in latin in the beginning of this
book / Presentem cronicanm compilaint frater Ranulphus Cestrensis monachus /
that is to say in Englissh / Brother Ranulph monk of Chestre compiled and made
this present cronike / R / The Cite of legyons that is Chestre stondeth in the
march of England toward wales bitwene two arms of the sea that been named dee
and Mersee / This Cite in time of Britons was head and chief Cite of all
venedocia that is North wales / The founder of this Cite is unknown / For who
that sees the foundements of the great ston^s would rather wene that it were
Romans work or work of Gyantes / than it were made by setting of Britons /
This Cite sommetyme in britissh speech heet Carrthleon legecestria in latin /
and Chestre in Englisshe and the Cite of legions also / For there lay^ a wyn^^r
the legions of knights that Julius cezar sent for to (...) Irlonde / And
after Claudius cezar sent legions out of that Cite for to win the Ilondes
that be called orcades / what ever william malmesbury by tellyng of other men
met of this Cite / This Cite has plente of lyuelode of corn of flessh of
fyssh / and specially of pris of Samon / this Cite resseyueth great
marchaundyse and sends out also / Also neyh this Cite ben salt wells /
Metal and oore / Northumbres destroyed this Cite sommetyme / But afterward
Elfleda lady of Mercia builded it attain and made it much more / In this same
Cite ben weyes under the er^he with vowtes and stonewerk wonderly y wrought
three chambred works great stones y grave with old men's names therein / There
is also Julius cezars name wonderly in stones y grave and other noble men's
also with the writing about / This is the Cite that Ethelfryd king of
Northumberland destroyed / and slough there fast by neyh two thousand monks
of the mynster of Bang^^ / This is the Cite that so that in what place ever it
be in england that the primate of cannterbury will hot and constreyne to gader
a counseill of clergy / the pmate of york is holden with his suffrigans for
to be (...) and for to be obedient to the ordinance that there shall lawfully
be ordained when the primate of Caunterbury is deed / the pmate of york shall
come to Caunterbury and with other bisshops he shall sacre him that is chosen /
and so with other bisshoppes he shall sacre his own primate if the primate of
york he deed / his successor shall come to the bishop of Caunterbury and he
shall take his ordenaunce of him and do his ooth with profession and lawful
obedience / After within about the year of our lord xj. C. lxxxxv. in the time
of king Rychard ben resons set for the right of the party for either primate
/ and what one primate did to that other in time of Thurstinus of Thomas and
of other bisshops of york from the conquest unto king harries time the third /
Also there it is said how each of them starte from other / This place is but a
forspekyng and not a full tretis thereof / Therefore it were noyefull to charge
this place with all thilke resons that there ben made

Of how many manner people has duellid therein C^. xiiij
BRytons duelled first in this Ilonde the xviij. year of hely the prophet /
the xj. year of Soluius posthumus king of latins / xliij. year after the taking
of Troy / to fore the byldyng of rome CCCC. xxxij. year. Beda li. j. They come
heder and took her course from Armorik that now is that other britayn / they
held long time the south contreyes of the Ilonde / hit befell afterward in
vaspasianus time duke of Rome / that the pictes shipped out of scicia in to
Occean / and were driven about with the wind and entered in to the north
costs of Irlond and fond there scotts and prayde to have a place to duelle
inn / and might none get / For Irlonde as scotts said might not sustain
both people / Scotts sent the pictes to the northsides of Britayne / and
behight them help against the Britons that were their enemies if they would
arise / and took hem wives of her doughtres / upon such condition if doubt^
fylle / who should have right for to be king / they should rather chese hem a
king of the mother side / than of the fadre side / of the wy^ men kyn rather
than of the men kyn / Gaufre / In vaspasian the Emperors time when Marius
Aruiragns sone was king of britons One Rodryk king of pictes came out of scicia
and began to destroy scotland / then Marius the king slew this roderik and yaf
the north party of scotland that heet Cat^enesia to the men y^ were come with
roderik and were overcome by him for to duelle Inn / But these men had no
wives ne none might have of the nation of britons / therefore they sailled in to
Irlande and took to their wives Irisshmens doughtres by that covenant that the
mother blood should be put to fore in succession of heritage / Gir. ca. xvij.
Netheles Sirinus super Virgi^^u^ seyth that pictes ben agatirses that had sum
duellyng place about the waters of Scicia / and they ben called pictes of
peynting and smyting of wounds that been seen on her body / So that they seemed
as men were peynted with wounds therefore they were called pictes as peynted
men / These men and these goths ben all one people / For when Maximus the
tyrant was went out of britayne in to france for to ocupye the^ pire /
Then gracianus and valentinianus that were brethren and felaws of thempyre
bronght these goths out of Scicia with great yeftes with flateryng and fair
^ehestes in to the northcontrey of britayne / For they were stal worth and
strong men of arms / And so these theuys and ^ribours were made men of land
and of contre and duelled in the north contreyes and held there cites and
tounes Gaufre. Carancius the tyrant slow bassianus by help and treson of the
pictes that come in help and socour of bassianus / and yaf the pictes a
duellyng place in albania that is scotland / there they duelled long time
afterward y meddled with britons R / Then since that pictes ocupied first the
north side of scotlonde It seems that the duellyng place that this Carans^us
yaf hem is the south side of scotland that stretches from the thwert over
wall of romans werk to the scottyssh see / and conteyneth Galleway and lodouia
that is lodeway / Thereof Beda li. iij. ca. ij. speaks in this manner / Nynyan
the holy man converted the south pictes / Afterward the Saxons come and made
that country long to bremcia the north party of Northumberland / unto the
time that kynadius Alpinus sone king of scotland put out the pictes / and made
that country that lies bitwene twede and the scottyssh see long to his
kingdom / Beda li. j. c^. j. Afterward long time the scotts were led by duke
renda / and come out of Irlonde that is the propre country of scotts and with
love or with strength made hem a place fast by the pictes in the northside of
that arm of the sea / that breketh in to the land in the west side that
departed in old time bitwene britons and pictes / Of this duke kend^ the
scotts had the name and were called dalrendines as it were Rendaes part / For
in her speech a part is called dal / Gir. p^. the pictes might have no wives of
britons / but they took hem wives of Irissh scotts and promised hem fair for
to duelle with hem / and granted hem a land by the sea side / there the sea
is narow / that land is called now Gallewaye / Marianus / Irissh scotts
londed at argayll that is scottyn clif for scotts londed there for to do
harm to the britons / or for that place is next to Irlonde for to come a land
in to Britayne / Beda / And so the scotts after the britons and pictes made
the third people duellyng in britayne / R / Then after that come the saxons
at prayng of the britons / to help hem against the scotts and pictes / And
the britons were sone put out in to wales / and saxons ocupied the land
lytill and litill / and efte more to the scottyssh see / And so saxons made the
fourth manner of men in the Ilonde of britayn / Beda li. v. ca. ix. For saxons
and angles come out of Germania / yet sum britons that duellen nygh call
hem shortly germans / R / Netheles about the year of our lord viij. C.
Egbertus king of westsaxon commanded and badde all men to call the men of the
land englisshmen / Alfre. Then after that the danes pursued the land about
a cc. year / that is for to say fro the forsaid Egbertes time / unto seint
Edwardes time / and made the fyfthe manner of people in the Ilonde / but they
faylled afterward / At last come normans under duke william and subdued
englisshmen / and yet keep they the land / and they made the sixte people in
the Ilonde / But in the first king harryes time come many flemynges and
received a duellyng place for a time beside maylros in the west side of england
/ and made the seuenthe people in the Ilonde / Netheles by commandment of the
same king they were put thennes and driurn to hauerfordes side in the west side
of wales / R / And so now in britayne danes and pictes fayllen all out and
five nations duelle therein that been scotts in Albania / that is scotland /
Britons in Cambria / that is wales / but that flemynges duelle in that is west
wales / And Normans and englisshmen ben meddled in all the Ilonde / for it is
now doubt in stories how and in what manner they were put away and destroyed
out of britayne / Now it is to declare how the pictes were destroyed and
faylled / Gir. p^. ca. xvij. Britayne was sometime ocupied with saxons / and
pees was made and stablisshed with the pictes / then the scotts that come
with the pictes saw that the pictes were nobler of deeds and better men of
arms though they were less in nombre than the scotts / Then the scotts
having thereof envy turned to their naturell treson that they have often ^sid /
for in treson they pass other men / and ben traitors as it were by kind /
for they prayde all the pictes specially the great of hem to a feste / and
waited her time when the pictes were merry and had well drunk / they drew up
nails y^ held up holow benches under the pites and the pictes unware and
suddenly fy^^ in over the hamm^s in to a wondrefull pitfall / Then the scotts
fill on the pictes and slow hem and ^^fte none alive And so of two people the
better werriours were holy destroyed / But the other that been the scotts
which ben traitors all unlike to the pictes took proffyte by that falls treson
/ for they took all that land and hold it yet unto this time and call it
scotland after her own name / In king Edgarus time kynadius aspinns sone was
duke and leder of the scotts and werred in picte land and destroyed the
pictes / he werred six sithes in saxon and took all the land that is bitwene
twede and the scottissh see with wrong and with strength^

Of the langages of manners and vsages of the people of that land Ca. xv
AS it is known how many manner of people ben in this Ilo^de there ben also so
many langages and tongues / Netheles walssh and scotts that been not medl^d with
other nations keep neyh yet their langage and speech / But yet the scotts that
were sometime co^federate and duellid with pictes draw somewhat aft their speech
But the fle^mynges y^ duelle in the west side of wales have left her straung^
speech and speken like to saxons / also englisshmen though they had fro the
beginning three manner speches / southern / northern and myddell speech in the
myddell of the land as they come of three manner of people of germania / Netheles
by co^mixtion and meddling first with Danes and afterward with Normans in many
things the contre langage is appaired / for some use strange wlaffing
chitering harryng garryng and grisbyting / This appayring of the langage comes
of two things / ones because that children y^ gone to scole learn to speak
first englissh / and than ben compellid to co^strewe her lessons in frenssh and
that have been used syn the normans com^ in to england / Also gentilmens
children ben learned and taught from their yongth to speak fre^ssh / and up
londissh me^ will cou^terfete and likene hem self to gentilmen / and arn besy
to speak fre^ssh for to be more set by / wherefore it is said by a common
preerbe / Jack would be a ge^tilma^ if he could speak fre^ssh / Cre. this was
much used to for y^ great death / but since it is somdele changed / for sir
Johan Cornewayll a master of gramer changed the techyng of gramer scole and
constructton of frenssh in to englissh And other scolemaiestrs use the same way
now in the year of our lord. M. CCC. lxxxv. the ix. year of king Richard the
second / and leave all frenssh in scoles and use all construction in englissh
/ wherein they have auantage one way that is that they learn the sonner their
gramer And in anothir disauauntage / for now they learn no frenssh ne can none
/ which is hurt for them that shall pass the sea / And also gentilmen have
much left to teache their children to speak frenssh / R / Hit seems a great
wonder that englissh have so great duiersite in their own la^gage in soune and
in spekyng of it / which is all in one Ilonde / And the langage of normandy
is comen out of anothir land / and has one manner soune among all them that
speaks it in england / for a man of kente / Sonthern western / and northern
men speken frenssh all like in soune and speech / but they can not speak their
englissh so / Creuisa / Netheles there is as many diverse manner of frenssh in
the reame of france / as diverse englissh in the reame of england / R / Also
of the forsaid tongue which is departed in three is great wonder / for men of the
eest with men of the west accord ^et^ in sownyng of their speech / than men of
the north with men of the south / Therefore it is that men of mercij that been of
myddell England as it were partiners with the ends / understand better the
side langages northern and southern than northern and southern understand
either other / Wilhel. de pon^. li. iij. All the langages of the northumbres
and specially at york is so sharp shittyng frotyng and vnshappe / that we
sothern men may uneath understand that langage / I suppose the cause be that
they be nygh to the aliens that speak strangely / And also by cause that the
kyngis of england a bide and duelle more in the south country / than in the
north contre The cause why they abide more in the south contre than in y^ north
contre / is by cause that there is better corn land more people / moo noble
Citees / and moo prouffytable hauenes in the south country than in the north.

FOr the manners and the doing of walsshmen and of scotts ben to fore some what
declared / Now I purpose to tell (...) and declare the manners and conditions of
the medlyd people of England / But the flemmynges that been in the west side of
wales ben now all turned as they were Englisshmen because they company with
englisshmen / And they be mighty and strong to fight / and ben the most
enemies that walishmen have and use marchandyse and clothyng and ben full ready
to put hem self to auentures and to peril in the sea and land because of
great wynnyng / and ben ready sommetyme to goo to the plow and sometime to deeds
of arms when time and place axeth / It seems of these men a great wondre that
in a boon of a wethers right sholder wha^ the f^ssh is soden away and not
roasted they know what have be don / is don / and shall be don / as it were by
a spirit of prophecy and a wonde full craft / They tell what is don in far
contreyes / tokenes of pees or of werre / the state of the royame / sleyng of
men / and spousebreche such things they declare certainly of tokenes and
sign that is in such a sholdre boon / R / But the englisshmen that duelle in
england ben medlid in the Ilonde and ben far fro the places that they spronge
of first / tornen to contrary deeds lightly without entising of any other men
by her own assente / And so vnesy also full v^paciente of pees / enemy of
besines and full of slouthe / Wilhelmus de pon^. li. iij / seyth that when they
have destroyed her enemies all to ground / then they fighten with hem self
and sleeth each other / as a void and an empty stomak wircheth in hit self /
R / Netheles men of the south ben esier and more mylde than men of the north /
For they be more unstable more cruel and more vnesy / The myddell men ben
sommedele parteners with both / Also they use hem to glotonye more than other
men and ben more costlew in mete and clothyng / Me supposes that they took
that v^ce of king Hardeknet that was a Done / For be ^^te set he forth twyes
deb^e mess at diner and at soper also / Th^se men ben spedefull an horse and a
foot / Able and ready to all manner deeds of ar nes and ben wont to have
victory and maistrie in every fight where no treson is walkyng and ben curious
and can well tell deeds and wondres that they have seyne / Also they gone in
diverse lendes uneath ben any men richer in her own land or more gracious in
far and in strange land / they can better win and get new than keep her
owue heritage / Therefore it is that they be sprad so wide and wene that every
land is their own The men be able to all manner sbeyght and wyttr / but to
fore the deed blonderyng and hasty / And more wise after the deed than to fore
/ and leven of lightly what they have begone / Polinus. li. vj. Therefore
Eugenius the pope said that Englisshmen were able to do what ever they would /
and to be set and put tofore all other ne were that light wit lettith / And
as hanybal seyde that the Romans might not be overcome / but in her own
coutre / so Englisshmen mow not be overcome in strange lands / but in her own
country they be lightly overcome / R / These men despisen her own / and praise
other mennys / And uneath ben plesed ner apayd with their own astate / what
befalls and becomes other men / they will gladly take to hem self /
Therefore it is that a yeman arayeth him as a squire / a squire as a knight / a
knight as a duke / a duke as a king / Yet sum goo about and will be like to
all manner state / and ben in no state For they take every degree that be of no
degree / for in bering outeward they ben mynstrals and berowdes / In talkyng
great spekers / In eting and drynkyng glotons / In gaderyng of catel hucksters
and tauerners / In array tormentours / In wynnyngis argi / In trauayll tantali
/ In taking head dedaly / In beds sardanapali / In chirches mametis In
courts thonder / only in pryuelege of clergy and in prebendes / they knowleche
hem self clerkis / Treuisa. As touching the terms of latin as argi / tantali
/ dedali sardanapali / ye must understand hem as the poets feyned of them /
Argus was an herd and kept bestes / be had an houndred eyes / And Argus was
also a ship / a shipman and a chapman / And so Argus might see before and
behind and on every side / Therefore he that is wise and ware and can see that
he be not deceived / may be called Argus / And so the cronyke says in plurel
nombre / that englisshmen ben argi / that is to say they see about where as
wynnyng is / That other word tantali / the poet feyneth that Tantalus slow
his own sone / wherefore he is dampened to perpetuell penance / and he stands
always in water up to the nether lyppe / and has always ripe apples and noble
fruit hangyng down to the over lyppe / but the fruit ne the water may not come
within his mouth / he is so hold and stands bitwene mete and drink and may
neythir ete ne drink / and is ever an hungrid and a thyrst that woe is him a
live / by this manner lyknes of Tantalus / they that do right naught there as
much is to do in every side ben called tantali / It seems that it is to say
/ In trauaylle they ben tantali / for they do right naught thereto / The third
word js dedali / Take heed that Dedalus was a ^^btil and a slye man / And
therefore by liknes they that been subtyl and slye they be called dedali / The
fourth word is Sradanapali / Ye shall understand that Sardanapalus was king
of Assiryens and was full unchaste / and used him to lie soft / And by a manner
of likeness of him they that live unchastly ben y cleped sardanapali / R / But
among all englissh medlid to gedres is so great changing and diversity of
clothing and of array and so many manners and diverse shappes / that well neyhe
is there any man known by his clothing and his array of what someu degree that
he be / Thereof prophesied an holy Anchor in king Egelfredes time in this manner /
Henri. li. vj. Englisshmen for as much as they use them to dronkelewnes / to
treson and to reche^esnes of gods house / first by danes and then by normans
/ and at third time by scotts that they hold most wretches and lest worth
of all other they shall be oucome Then ye world shall be so unstable and so
diverse and variable that the unstableness of thoughts shall be bitokened by
many manner diuersitees of clothyng

The manner living of ye land
Is well diverse from england
In mete and drink and clothyng
And many other doing.
They be clothed wondre well.
In a shirt and in a mantell
A crisp breche well fayn.
Both in wind and in rain
In this clothyng they be bold
Though the weder be right cold
Without shetes always.
Evermore in this array.
They goo fight pleye and lepe.
Stand sit lie and sleep
Without surcot goun cote and kirtell
Without iope^ tabard clok or bell
without lace and chaplet yt her lappes
Without hode hatte or cappes
Thus araid gone yt segges
And always with bare legs.
They keep none other going
Though they mete with ye king
With arowes and short speres.
They fight with them yt he^ deres
They fight better if they neden.
When they go tha^ wha^ they ride^
Instead of castle and tour.
They take wode and mareys for so cour
When they seen it is to do
In fighting they woll be a go.
Gildas seyth they ben variable
In pees and not stable.
If men axe why it be
It is no wonder for the sea
Though men put out of land
To put out other would fond.
But all for nout at this sto^de
For all many wodes be^ at gro^de
And upon the sea among.
Ben castles builded strong
The men may dure long / un ete
And love well conume mete
They can ete and ben mury
Without great cury
They ete breed cold and hoote.
Of barley and of ote.
Broad cakes rouude and thynne
As well seems so great kynne.
Selde they ete bread of whete
And selde they done ones ete.
They have gruell to potage.
And lekes kind to companage
Also butter milk and chese.
Yshape endlong and corner wese
Such messes they ete snell
And that makes he^ drink well
Methe and ale that has might.
Thereon they spend day and night
Ever the redder is the wyn.
They hold it the more fyn
When they drink at ale
They tell many a lewd tale
For when drink is an hondling
They ben full of Iangling.
At mete and after eke
Her solace is salt and l^ke.
The husbond in his wise.
Tells that a great prise.
to give a caudron with gruwele
To hem that siten on his mele.
He deleth his mete at mele
And yeueth every man his dele
And all the ouerpluse
He keeps to his own use
Therefore they have woo
And myshappes also
They eten hot samon always
All though phisik say nay
Her houses ben low with all.
And made of yerdes small
Not as in citees nyhe
But f^r asonder and not to hi^e.
When all is eten at home
Then to her neyhbours will they rome
and ete what they may find and see.
And then torn home aye
The life is idle that they ledes
In bre^ning sleping and such deeds
Walsshmen use with her might
to weshe their ghestes feet a nyt
If he wessh her feet all and sum
Then they know y^ they be well
They live so esily in a route.
That selde they bear purs about
At her breche out and home
They hong their money and comb come
It is wondre they be so hende
And hate crak at nether end
And without any core
Make their wardrope at door
They have in great mangery
harp tabour and p^p for mi^stralcie
They here corpse with sorrow great
and blow loud horns of gheet
They praise fast trojan blood
For thereof come all her broad
Neyh kyn they will be.
Though they pass an C. degree
above other me^ they will he^ dit
and worship prestes with her myt
As angels of heaven right
they worshire servants of god
Often giled was this broad
And yerned bataill all for wode almyt
For merlins prophecy
And often for sort ^egye
Best in manners of britons
For company of saxons
Ben turned to better right
That is known as clear as light
they tille^ ctardins field and dou^^s
And draw hem to good tounes
They ride armtd as wole god
And goo y hosed and y shood.
And sitten fair at her mele.
And s^epe in beds fair and feed
So they seem now in mind
More englissh than walsh kind
If men axe whi they now do so
More than they wont to do.
They lyuen in more pees.
Because of their riches
For their catel should slake.
If they used often wrake
Dread of loss of her good
Make them now stille of mode.
All in one it is brought
Have nothing and dread naught
The poet seith a saw of preef.

Of the noise that is there under

Of the description of Scotland Ca. xxj.
Hit is a common saw that the contre which is now named scotland / is an
outstretchyng of the north pertie of britayn and is deperted in the south side
from britayne with arms of the sea / Und in the other side all about
beclipped with the sea / this land heet sometime albania / and had that name of
albanactus / that was king brutus sone / for albanactus duelled first therein /
or of the prouynce albania / that is a contre of Scicia and nygve to amazona /
therefore scotts ben called as it were scittes / for they come out of Scicia /
Afterward that land beet pictauia for the pictes reigned therein a thousand year

Irlonde heybte / Gir. in top. For many skyles / one skyl is for affynite and
alye / that was bitwene them and Irisshmen / for they took wives of Irlond and
that is openly seen in her bileue / in clothyng in langage and in speech / in
wepen and in manners / Anothir skyl is for Irisshmen duelled there sometime Beda
li. j. Out of Irlonde that is the propre country of scotts come Irisshmen
with her duke that was called Renda / And with love and with strength made hem
chief sees and citees besides the pictes in the northside / Gir. Now thee land

therein CCC. xv. year unto the read williams time that was Malooline brother / R
/ Many euydencis we have of this scotland / that it is often called and heyghte
hibernia as Irlond does / Therefore Beda libro. ij. ca xj. seyth that laurence
Archebisshopp of dunbar was archebisshopp of scotts that duelled in an Ilonde
that hete hibernia and is next to Britayne / Also Beda li. iij. ca. xxvij.

west Ilonde is an hundred mile from eueriche Britayne / and departs with the sea bitwene / and called hibernia that country that now is called scotlond /
there he tells that Adamuan Abbote of this Ilonde seyled to hibernia for to

worshipp if he deye in the field / They ben licell of mete and mow fast long

princes of Scotts as the kings of spain been not wont to ben enoynted ne
crouned / In this Scotlond is solemp ne and great mind of seint Andrew the
appostle / For seint Andrew had the north contreres of the world scytes and
Pictes to his lotte for to preche and convert the people to Cristes believe And
at the last he was martred in Achaia in grecia in a Cite that was named Patras
/ And his boones were kept two honderd two and seventy year unto Constantinus
the Emperonrs time / And then they were translated in to Constantinople and
kept there C. x. yece unto Theodostus themperours time Then vngust king of
pictes in scotland destroyed a great party of britayne and was besette with a
great host of britons in a feld called merke / and he herd seint Andrew speak
to him in this manner / Vngus vngus here thou me cristes apostle I promise the
help and socour / when thou have ouercomen thyn enemies by my help / thou
shall give the this de debe of thyn beritage in alms to god almighty and in
worshipp of seint Andrew / and the sign of the cross went to fore his ooste
and the third day he had victory and so turned home ayene / and deled his
heritage as he was boden / And for he was uncertain what cite he should dele
for seint Andrew / he fasted three days / he and his men prayed seint Andrew
that he would show him what place he would chese / And one of the wardeyns that
kept the body of seint Andrew in Constantinople was warned in his sweuene y^ he
should goo in to a place whider an angele would led him / and so he come in to
scotland with vij. felaws to y^ top of an hille named Ragmund / The same hour
light of heaven bishone and biclipped the king of pictes / that was coming with
his host to a place called Carceuan / There anon were heled many seek men
There met with the king Regulus the monk of Constantinople with the relics
of seint Andrew / There is founded a church in worshipp of seint Andrew that
is head of all the chirches in the land of pictes that is Scotland / To this
church comen pilgryms out of all lands / There was Regulus first abbot and
gadred monks / And so all the tienthe land that the king had assigned him /
he depart it in diuerce places among abbayes

Of the description of Irland Ca. xxij.
HYbernia that is Irlonde / And was of old time incorpe^ate in to the
lordshipp of Britayne so seyth Giraldus in sua toppograuia / Where he
discriueth it at fulle / Yet it is worthy and semely to praise that land with
larger praising / for to come to chere and full knoweleche of that land these

the weste end of spain / and that land heihte scotlond also / for scotts
duellid there sometime er they come in to that other scotlond that longed to
Britayne / Therefore it is written in the Martiloge / Such a oay in scotlond
seint Bryde was borne / and that was in Irlonde / This land has in the
southest side spain three days saylling thennes a side half / and has in the
est side the more britayne thens a days saylling in the west side it has the

Of the gretnrs and qualite of that land Capitulo. xxiiij.
IRlonde is an Ilonde grettest after britayne / and stretches norward from
brendans hills unto the land Columbina and conteyneth viij. days Iourneyes /
every Journey of xl. mile / and from deuelin to patrike hills and to the sea
in that side in bread four Iourneyes / and Irlonde is nawwer in the myddell
than in thendes / all othirwyse than britayne is / as Irlonde is shorter
northward than britayne / so is it longer southward / the land is not pleyne
but full of montayns of hills of wodes of mareys and of mores / The land is
soft rayny wyndy and lowr by the ser side and withinne hilly and sondy /
Solinus / there is great plente of noble pasture and of leese / therefore the
beestes must be often driven out of their pasture be they ^te ouermoch for
they should shende hem self if they might ete at their will / Girald men of that
land have communely their health and strangers have often a perilous flux
because of the moisture of the mete / The flessh of ^^ren is there wholesome /
and swynes flessh unwholesome / Men of that land have no fever but only the
fever ague and that right selde Therefore the holsomnes and health of that land
and the clennes out of venyme is worth all the host and richesse of trees of
herbs of spycerie / of rich clothes / and of precious stones of the est
lands The can^e of the health and holsomnrs of that land is y^ atte^perate
hete and cold that is therein In quibus rebus sufficit In this land ben mo
kyne than oxen / more pasture than corn / more gras than seed / There is great
plente of samon / of lamprayes / of Eelis and of other see fissh / Of egles of
cranes / of pecokes / of curlewes / of sperhaukes / of goshaukes and of gentill
fawcons / Of wolves and right shrewd myse / There ben attercoppes / blood
soukers and ecftes that done none harm / There ben feyres lytill of body and
full hardy and strong / There ben bernacles fowls like to wild ghees / which
grown wonderly upon trees / at it were nature wrought again kind / men of
religion eteth bernacles on fastingdayes because they ben not engendrid with
flessh / wherein as me thinks they err / for reason is against that / For if a
man had eten of Adams beg he had eten flessh / and yet Adam was not engendrid
of fader and mother / But that flessh come wonderly of therthe / and so this
flessh comes wonderly of the tree In this land is plente of honey and of milk
of wine and of vyneyerdes / Solinus and Ysidorus written that Irlonde has no
bees / Netheles it were better written that Irlonde had ^ees and no vynyerdes
Also Beda seyth that there is great hunting to roobuckes And it is y know that
there ben none / It is no wonder of Beda for he saw never that land / but
sum man had told him such tales / Also there grows that stone Saxagonus and
is called Iris also as it were the rayn bow / if that stone be hold against
the son a none it shall shape a raynbowe / there is also founden a stone that
is called gagates and white margery perles

Of the defawtes of the land Ca. xxv
WHete corns ben there full small uneath yclensed with man's hond / Reserved
men / all bestes ben smaller there than in other lands / There lacks well
nygh all manner fyssh of fresshe water that is not gendrid in the sea There
lacken unkind faucons / gerfaucons / partrychis fesaunte / Nyghtyngals and
pyes / There lacken also Roo and bucke and Ilespiles wontes and other venymous
bestes / Therefore sommen feynen and that favorably that seint patryk cleansed
that land of worms and of venymous bestes / but it is more probable and more
skylfull that this land was from the beginning always without such worms /
for venomous bestes and worms dyen there anon if men bring hem thiter out of
other lands And also venyme and poison brought thider out of other lands
lesen their malice as soon as it passes the myddell of the sea / Also poudr^
and earth of that land cast and sawen in other lands driven away worms so
ferforth that if a turf of that land be put about a worm / it sleth him or
makes him thrille the erthhe for tescape away / In that land cocks crow but
litill to fore day / so that the first crowyng of cocks in that land and the
third in other lands ben like far to fore the day

Of them that first enhabited Irlonde Ca. xxvj.
GYraldus seyth that Casera Nors nece drad the flode and fled with three men
and fyfty wymmen in to that Ilonde and duelled therein first the last year to
fore Noes flode / But afterward Bartholanus Seres sone that come of Iaphet Noes
sone come thither with his three sons by hap or by craft / CCC. year after
Noes flode and duelled there and encreced to the nombre of ix. M. men / And
afterward for stenche of ka^^eyns of geantes that they had kyld they deyden
all save one Ruanuz that lived a thousand and V. C. year unto seint patriks
time / and informed the holy man of the forsaid men and of all their doyngis
and deeds / Then the third time come thider Nymeth out of scicia with his
four sons and duelled there two houndred year and xvj. And at last of his
offspring by diverse myshappes of werres and of moreyne they were clean
destroyed and the land left wide CC. year after / The fourth time five dukes
that were brethren / Gandius / Genandus / Saganduis / Ruth^ragus / Slauius /
of the forsaid Nimethis successors come out of Greece and ocupied that land
and deled it in five parties / And every party contained xxij. candredes / A
candrede is a contre that conteyneth an houndred tounes / And they set a
stone in the myddell of the land as it were in the navel and beginning of
five kingdoms At last Slauius was made king of all the land / The fyfthe
time wha^ this nation was xxx. year to gedyr they wexe feeble Four noble men
that were Millesius the kings sons come out of spain with many other in a
naueye of lx. ships / And two of the worthiest of these four brethern that
hete Hiberus and Hermon deled the land bitwene hem tweyne / But afterward
covenant was broken bitwene hem both and Hiberus was slawe / Then Hermon
was king of all that land / And from his time to the first patriks time were
kings of that nation C. xxxj. And so fro the coming of the hybermensis unto
the first patrik were a M. year and viij. C. They had that name hibermences and
hibernia of the forsaid hiberus or else of hiberus a river of spain / they were
called also Gaytels and scotts / of one gaytelus that was phenius neuew / This
gaytelus could speak many langages / after the langages that were made at
nemproths tour / and wedded one scotta phawes daughter / Of these dukes come
the hibermensis / Men say that this gaytelus made the Irissh langage and
called it gaytelaf as it were a langage gadred / of all langages and tongues /
At last Belinus king of Britayne had a sone hihte gur guncius / As this
Gurguncius come out of denmark at Ilondes Orcades / he fond men that were
called basclensis and were come thider out of spain / these men prayde and
besoughte for to have place to duelle inn / And the king sent hem to Irlonde
that was tho wide and waste / and ordained and sent with hem dnkes and
capitaynes of his own / And so it seems that Irlonde should long to Britayne
by right of old time / From the first saint patrik unto Fedliundius the kings
time CCCC. year / reigned xxxiij. kings euerich after other in Irlonde / In
this Fedliundius time Turgesius duke and captain of Norweyes brought thider
men of Norweye and ocupied that land and made in many places deep diches and
castles sengle double and treble and many wards strongly walled / and many
thereof stand yet all hole / but Irisshmen recche not of castles / for they
take woods for castles and mareys and mores for castle diches / But at
last Turgesius deyde by gylefull wyles of women / and Englisshmen seyne that
Gurmundus wan Irlonde and made thilke diches / and ma ke no mention of
Turgesias / and Irisshmen speak of turgesius and know not of Gurmundus Therefore
it is to wete that gurmu^dus had won britayne and duellid therein / and send
Turgesius with great strength in to Irlonde for to win that land / and
because Turgesius was captain and leder of that viage and Journey and seen
among them Therefore Irisshmen speak much of him as a noble man that was seen
in that land and known / At last when Gurmundus was slain in france /
Turgesius loved the kings daughter of mete in Irlonde / and her fader behihte
Turgesius that he would send her him to the low larherin with xv. maidens And
Turgesius promised to mete there with xv. of the nobleste men that he had / and
held covenant and thought no gyle / but there come xv. young berdles men
clothed like wymmen with short swerdes under her clothes / and fille on
Turgesius and slow him right there and so he was traitoursly slain after he
had reigned xxx. year / Not long after three brethern Amelanus Siracus and
Iuorus come in to Irlond with her men out of Norwey as it had been for soue of
pees and of marchandyfe and duellid by the sea sides by assente of Irisshmen /
that were always idle as poules knights / And the Norwayes bilded three citees /
Deuelin Waterford and lymerich and encreced and after wexe rebel against men of
that land and brought first sparthes in to Irlond / So fro Turgesius time unto
Rotheriks time king of Connaccia that was the last that was king of all the
land were xvij. kings in Irlonde And so the kings that reigned in Irlonde
from the first hermons time unto the last Rotheriks time were in all an C.

by might maistrye and by strength of arms The second harry king of england

Of the conditions and manners of Irisshmen Ca. xxvij.
SOlinus seyth that men of this land ben strange of naco^n houseles and great
fighters / and acounte right and wrong all for one thing / and ben single of
clothyng / scarce of mete cruel of heart / angri of speech / and drinks first
blood of deed men that been slain / and then wesshen their visages there with
and hold hem paid with flessh and fruit instead of mete and with milk instead of drink / And vsen much pleyeng Idleness and hunting and trauaylle but
litell In their childhode they ben hard norisshed and hard fed and they be
vnfemely of manners and of clothyng and have breche and hosen allone of wolle
and strayte hodes that stretches a cubite over the sholdres behind and
foldinges instead of mantels and of clokes / Also they use no sadles / boots
ne spores when they ride / but they drive their horses with a chambred yerd in
the over end / Instead of bittes with trenches and of badles of reest / they
use bridles that let not their horse to ete their mete / They fight unarmed
naked in body / netheles with ij. darts and speres / and with broad sparthes
they fight with one hand / These men forsake tylyeng of land and kepen
pasture for beestes / they use long herdes and long locks hangyng down
behind her hedes / They use no craft of flax / of wolle / of metal / ne of
marcha^ dyse / but give hem to Idleness and to slouthe / and rekene roste for
liking and fredome for richesse / And though scotlond the daughter of Illonde
use harp tymbre and talour / Netheles Irisshmen be connyng in two manner
instrumentis of mustke / in harp and tymbre that is armed with wyre and
strenges of brass / In which instrumentis though they plaxe hastily and
swyftly they make right merry armonye and melodye with thick tewnes werbles and
notes / and begin fro^bemol and playen secretly under dyme soune in the great
strenges / and torn ayene unto the same / so that the grettest pertie of the
craft hydeth the craft / as it would seem as though the craft so hid should
be ashamed if it were take / These men (...) of evil manners in her living /
they pay no tithinges they wedde lawfully / they spare not their alyes / but
the brother wedded the brothers wife / they ben besy for to betraye her
neyhbours and other / they here sparthes in their lands instead of staves and
fight against them / that trust most to them / These men ben variable and
unsteadfast trechours and gylefull who that deleth with them / needs more to
beware of gyle / than of craft of pecs than of brennyng brondes / of honey than
of galle / of malice than of knyghthode / they have such manners that they ben
not strong in werre and in bataill ne true in pecs / they become gossibs to
them / that they well falsely betraye in the gossibrede and holy kynrede /
Euerich drinks others blood when it is shed They love somdele her norice and
her pleyfers which that souke the same milk that they souked while they were
children / And they pour siewe their brethern their cosins / and their other
kyn / And despisen their kyn whiles they live / and avenge their death when they
ben slain / So long has the usage of evil custom endured among them / that
it has gotten the mastrie over them and torneth treson in to kind so ferforth
that they ben traitors by nature / And aliens and men of strange lands that
duelle among them folowen their manners that uneath there is none but he is
bismytted with their treson also / Among them many men pissen sitting and
wymmen standing / There ben many men in that land foul shapen in lymiues and in
body / For in their lymmes they lak the benefice of kind So that no where ben
none better shapen than they that been there well shapen / and none worse shapen
than they that been evil shapen / And skylfully nature hurt and defouled by
wykednes of living brings forth such foul gromes and evil shapen of bein
that with unlawful delyng with foul manners and evil living so wyckedly
defouleth kind and nature In this land and in wales old wyuce and wymen were
wont and ben yet as men seyne often for to shape them self in likeness of hares
for to milk their neighbors kyne and stele her milk / And often grehoundes
rennen after them and poursiewe them and wenen that they be hares Also some by
craft of Nygromancie maken fat swyne for to be read of color and selle them
in markettis and in feyres / But as soon as these swyne pass any water they
torn in to their own kind whether it be straw heye gras or turues But these
swyne may not be kept by no craft for tendure in likeness of swyne over three
days Among these wondres and other take bid that in the vttermest end of
the world falls often new meruailles and wondres / As though kind pleyde
with larger love secretly and fex in thendes / that openly and neyh the myddell
/ therefore in this Ilonde ben many grysly wondres and meruailles

Of the meruailles and wondres of Irlonde Ca. xxviij.
MAny men tellen that in the northside of Irlonde is the land of life / In that
Ilonde noman may deye / but wha^ they ben old and ben vexed with great
sickness / they ben born out in to the next land and deye there / There is
anothir Ilonde in Irlonde that no woman therein may bear a child / but yet she
may conceive / Also there is an Ilonde in which no deed body may roten In
vltonia that is vlster is an Ilonde in a lake wonderly departed in tweyne / In
that one party is great disturbaunce and descomfort of fendes / and in that
other party great likyng and comfort of holy angels / There is also saint
patriks purgatory that was showed at his prayers to confirm his prechyng and
his lore when he preched to mysbeleued me^ of sorrow and pain that evil men
should suffer for her wicked wirkes / And of Joy and of bliss that good men
shall resseyue for her holy deeds / he tells that who that suffers y^ peynes
of y^ purgatory / if it be enjoined him for penance / he shall never suffer
the peynes of hell / but he dye finally without repetaunce of sin / as the
ensample is set more fulle / at this chapitres end / Treuisa / But truly
noman / may be saved but if he be very repentaunt what someuer penance he do
/ and every man that is very repentaunt at his lives end / shall be sikerly
saved / though he never here of seint patriks purgatory / There is an Ilonde in
Connacte Salo / that is in the sea of Conaccia / halewed by seint Brandan /
that has no myse / there deed bodies ben not buried / but ben kept out of
therthe and roten not / In mamonia is a well / who that wassheth him with that
water of that well / he shall wexe hoar on his head / There is anothir well in
vltonia / who someuer is wesshen therein he shall never wexe hoar afterward /
There is a well in Mounstre or Momonia / if any man touch that well anon
shall fall great rain in all the prouynce / and that rain shall never cesse
till a priest that is a clean maid singe a mass in a chapel fast by and
bless the water / And with milk of a cow that is of one here bespringe the
well / and so reconcyle the well in this strange manner At Glindalcan about
the oratorie of seint keywyn with ges berith apples as it were apple trees /
and ben mow wholesome tha^ sau^ry / That holy seint brought forth these apples by
prayers for to hele his child that was seek / There is a lake in blster and
much fissh therein / which is xxx. mile in length and fiften in bread The
River Ban renneth out of that lake in to the north Occean / And men say that
this lake began in this manner / There were men in that country that were of
evil living / coeuntes cum brutis / And there was a well in that land in
great reverence of old time / and always couerd / and if it were left
vncouerd the well would use and drown all the land / And so it happed that a
woman went to that well for to fecche water and hihed her fast to her child
that wept in the cradle / and left the well uncovered / then the well
sprang so fast that it drowned the woman and her child and made all the contre
a lake and a fisshponde / For to preue that this is soth it is a great argument
/ that when the weder is clear / fisshers of that water see in the ground
under the water round touris and hihe shapen as steples and chirches of that
land In the northside of Irlonde in the contre of ossiriens / every vij. year
at the prayer of an holy Abbot / tweyne that been wedded a man and a woman most
needs ben exiled and forshapen in to likeness of wolves and abide out vij. year
/ And at end of vij. year if they live they come home again and take again
their own shappe / and then shall other tweyne goo forth in their stead /
and so for shapen for other vij. year / There is a lake in this land if a
poole of tree be pyght and styked therein that part of the shaft or poole that
is in therthe shall torn in to Iren / And that part that abides in the water
/ shall torn in to stone / And the part that abides above shall be tree in
his own kind / Also there is a lake that torneth hasell into asshe and asshe
in to hasell / if it be don therein / Also in Irlonde (...) three samon leepes /
there as samons lepe against a roche a long ^^^res length Also in lagenia is a
ponde there he see^ colmans birds / the birds ben cleped certelles and come
homly to man's hand / but if men do hem wrong or harm / they gone away
and come not again / and the water there shall wexe bitter and stynke / And he
that did the wrong shall not a sterte without wreche and meschief but if he
do amends / R / As touching patriks purgatory / ye shall understand that
the second seint Patrik that was Abbot and not bisshopp while he prechid in
Irlonde labourid and studied for to torn thilke wicked men that lived as
bestes out of her evil life for dread of peynes of belle / and for to co^ferme
hem in good life / and they seyde they would not torn but sum of them might
know somewhat of the great pains / and also of bliss that he spoke of /
Then seint patrik prayed to god almighty therefore / and our lord Ihesus crist
appierid to seint patrik (...) him a stafe and ladde him in to a wild place
and she^^d hi^ there a round pit that was derke within and said / that if a
man were very repentaunt and stable of believe and went in to this pit / and
walked therein a day and a night / he should see the sorrows and the peynes of
evil men / and the Joy and bliss of good men Then crist vanysshed out of
patriks sight / and seint Patrik arered and bylded there a church and put
therein Chanons reguler and closed the pit about with a wall / and is now in
the chirch yerd at cest end of the chirch / and fast shitte with a strong
door / For noman should nycely goo in without leave of the bisshopp / or of the
priour of the place / Many men went in and come out again in patriks time and
told of pains and Joy that they had seen- and the meruailles that they saw
ben there yet wreton And because thereof many men turned and were converted to
right bileue / Also many men went in and come never again / In king Stephens
time king of England a knight that hihte Owayne went in to seint patriks
purgatory and come again and duelled ever after during his life in the needs of
thabbay of ludensis that is of thordre of Cistews and told many wondres that
he had see^ in patriks purgatory / The place is called Patriks purgatory and
the church is named reglis / Noman is enjoined for to goo in to that
purgatory / But counceilled that he should not come therein but take upon him
other penance / And if a man have auowed and be stable and wole need too
therein / he shall first god to the bishop and then he shall be sent with
lr^es to the priour of (...) place and they both shall cou^ceill him to leave /
and if he will needs (...) thereto he shall be in prayers and in fasting xv.
days / and after (...) he shall be houseld and lad to the door of the
purgatory with procession and letanie / and yet he shall be counceilled to
leave it / and if he be steadfast and will enter / the door shall be opend and he
y blessed and goo in on goddis name / and hold forth his way / and the door
shall be fast shette till the next day / and when the time is the priour shall
come and opene the door / and if the man be comen he bedeth him in to the
chirch with procession / and there he shall be xv. daye^ in prayers and fasting

Of the meruailles of seyntes of Irlonde Ca. xxix.
HEre Giraldus makes mind that as me^ of this nation ben more angri than
other men and more hasty for to take wreche whiles they ben a live / so seyntes
and halowys of this land ben more wrechefull than seintes of other lands /
Clerks of this land ben chaste and sayen many prayers and done great
abstinence a day / and drynketh all night / so that is acounted for a miracle
/ that lecherye regneth not there as wine regneth / and they that been evil of
them ben worst of all other / So good men among them though they be but few /
ben good at best Prelates of that country ben but slow in correction of
trespass / and besy in contemplacion and not in prechyng of goddis word /
Therefore it is that all the seintes of that land ben confessors and no
martyr among them / and no wonder / for all the prelates of this land ben
chosen out of abbeyes in to the clergy / and done as monks should / what
clerks and prelates should do is to them unknown / therefore when it was put
against the bisshopp of Cassyll how it might be that so many seintes ben in
Irlonde and never a martyr among hem all since that the men ben so shrewd and so
angri / and the prelates so recheles and slow in corrections of trespass / The
bisshopp ansuerd feowa dly ynowh and said / our men ben shrewd and angri
ynouh to hem self / but to gods servants they beye never hand but do to
hem great reverence and worshipp / But englisshmen come in to this land that
kan make martres / and were wont to use that craft / R / The bishop said so
because that king harry the second was tho new comen in to Irlonde fresshly
after the martyrdom of seint Thomes of Caunterbury / Gir. in this land in
wales and in scotland ben belles and staves with crooked hedes and other such
things for relics in great reverence and worshipp / so that men of this
land dreden more for to swear upon any of thilke belles and gold staves than
upon the gospel / The chief of all such relics is y hold Ihu^s staf /
that is at deuelin / with the which staf they say y^ the first seint patrik
drofe the worms out of Irlonde / Augus. de. ci. dei ca. vij. If men axe how it
may be that diverse manner beestis and of diverse kind that been kindly gotten
bitwene male and female come and ben in Ilondes after Noes flode / Men supposen
that such beestes swame in to Ilondes about. and first to the next and so
forth into other / Or else men seyllyng in to Ilondes brought with hem such
beestis for love of hunting / or angels at god almyghties commandment brout
such beestes in to Ilondes about / or the earth brout hem forth first and
fulfilled tho gods commandment / that commanded the earth to bring forth
gras and quycke beestes.

Here ends the description of Britayne the / which conteyneth england wales
and scotland / and also because Irlonde is under the reule of england and of
old time it has so continued therefore I have set the descripcion of the
same after the said brituyne / which I have taken out of Policronicon / And
because it is necessary to all englisshmen to know the propretees
co^moditees and meruailles of them / therefore I have set them in enprinte
according to the translacion of Creuisa / which at request of the lord
Barkeley translated the book of Policronicon in to englissh / Fyny^^hed by me
william Carton the xviij. day of August the year of our lord god M. CCCC. lxxx.
and the xx. year of the regne of king Edward the fourth.
