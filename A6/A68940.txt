The new Testament / dylygently corrected and compared with the Greek by
Willyam Tindale: and fynesshed in the year of our Lord God. A.M. D. and.
xxxiiij. in the month of November.

W. T. unto the Reader.
HEre thou have (most dear reader) the new Testament or covenant made with
us of God in Christ's blood. Which I have looked over again (now at the last)
with all dylygence / and compared it unto the Greek / and have weded out of it
many fautes / which lack of help at the beginning and oversyght / did sow
therein. If ought seem changed / or not all to gether agreynge with the Greek /
let the fynder of ye fault consider the Hebrew Phrase or manner of speech left
in the Greek words. Whose preterperfectence and presenttence is often both one
/ and the futuretence is the optative mode also / and the future tence is often
the imperatyve mode in the actyve voice / and in the passyve ever. Likewise
person for person / nombre for nombre / and an interroga^ion for a co^dicionall
/ and soche like is with the Hebrews a comen usage.

I have also in many places set light in the mergent / to understand the text
by. If any man find fautes either with the tra^slacion or ought beside (which
is easyer for many to do / then so well to have translated it them selves of
their own pregnant wits / at the beginning without foren sample) to the
same it shall be lawful to translate it them selves and to put what they lust
thereto. If I shall perceave either by my self or by the informacion of other /
that ought be escaped me / or might be more plainly translated / I will
shortly after / cause it to be mended. Howbe it in many places / me thinks
it better to put a declaracyon in the margent / then to run in to far from
the text. And in many places / where the text seems at the first choppe hard
to be understand / yet ye circu^sta^ces before and after / and offe^ readinge
together / makes it plain enough. and ce.

Moreover / because the kyngedome of heaven / which is the scripture and word
of God / may be so locked up / that he which reads or hears it / cannot
understand it: as Christ testifies how that the Scribes and Pharisees had so
shut it up. Mat. xxiii. and had taken away the keye of knowledge. Luke. xi.
that their Jews which thought them selves with in / were yet so locked out /
and are to this day that they can understand no sentence of the scripture
unto their salvacion / though they can rehearse the textes every where and
dispute thereof as sottelye as ye popyshe doctoures of dunces darcke learning /
which with their sophistrye / sarved us / as ye Pharisees did the Jews.
Therefore (that I might be found faithful to my father and lord in
distributinge unto my brethren and fellows of one faith / their due and
necessary fode: so dressinge it and ceasoninge it / that the weak stomachs
may receave it also / and be ye better for it) I thought it my duty (most
dear reader) to warn the before / and to show the the right way in / and to
geve the ye true keye to open it withal / and to arm the against false
Prophets and malicious ypocrytes / whose perpetual stodye is to leven the
scripture with gloses / and there to lock it up where it should save thy soul
/ and to make us shote at a wrong mark / to put our trust in those things
that proffit their belyes only and slay our souls.

The right (...) the only way to understand the scripture unto our
salvacion / is / that we ernestlye and above all thing / search for the
profession of our baptyme or covenau^tes The right way into the scripture.
made between God and us. As for an ensample: Christ says Mat. v. Happy are
the merciful / for they shall obtain mercy. Loo / Here God has made a
covenau^t with us / to be merciful unto us / if we will be merciful one to
another: so that the man which shows mercy unto his neyboure / may be bold
to trust in God for mercy at all needs. And contrary wise / indgeme^t without
mercy / shall be to him that shows not mercy. Iaco. ii. So now / if he yt
shows no mercy / trust in God for mercy / his faith is carnal and worldly
/ and but vain presumpcio^. For God has promised mercy only to ye
merciful. And therefore the merciless have no Gods word yt they shall have
mercy: but contrary wise / yt they shall have judgment without mercy. And
Mat. vi. If ye shall forgeve men their fautes / your heve^ly father shall
forgeve you: but and if ye shall not forgeve me^ their fautes / no more shall
your father forgeve you your fautes. Here also by ye virtue and stre^ght of
this covenau^t where with God of his mercy has bound him self to us
unworthy / may he yt forgeveth his neyboure / be bold when he returns and
ame^deth to beleve and trust in god for remission of whatsoever he has done
amysse. And contrary wise / he that will not forgeve / cannot but dispeare of
forgevenes in the end / and fear judgment without mercy.

The general covenau^t wherein all other are comprehended and included / is
this. If we meke our selves to god / to keep all his laws / after the
ensample of Christ: then God has bound him self unto us to keep and make
good all the mercies promised in Christ / through out all the scripture.

All the whole law which was geve^ to utter our corrupt nature / is
comprehended in the Law.
ten commandments. And ye ten commandments are comprehended in these two:
love God and thy neyboure. And he that loves his neyboure in God and Christ /
fulfilleth these two / and consequentlye the ten / and finally all the other.
Now if we love our neyboures in God and Christ: that is to wete / if we be
lovinge / kind and merciful to them / because God has created them unto his
lyknes / and Christ has redeemed them and bought them with his blood / then may
we be bold to trust in God through Christ and his deservinge / for all mercy.
For God has promised and bound him self to us: to show us all mercy / and
to be a father almighty to us / so that we shall not need to fear the power of
all our adversaryes.

Now if any man that submits not him self to keep the commandments / do
think yt he has any faith in God: the same man's faith is vain / worldly
/ damnable / develishe and plain presumpcion as it is above said / and is no
faith that can justify or be accepted before God. And that is it that James
means in his Pistle. For how can a man beleve says Paul without a preacher.
To. x. Now read all the scripture and se where God sent any to preach mercy
to any / save unto the^ only that repent and turn to god with all their
hearts / to keep his commandments. Unto the disobedient that will not turn
/ is threatened wrath / vengeance and damnacion / according to all the
terrible curses and fearful ensamples of the Bible.

Faith now in God the father through our Lord Jesus Christ / according to ye
covenau^tes and apoynteme^t made between God and us / is our salvacio^.
Wherefore I have ever noted ye covenau^tes in ye merge^tes / and also ye
promises. Moreover where thou find a promise and no covenant expressed
therewith / there must thou understand a covenau^t. For all the promyses of ye
mercy and grace yt Christ has purchased for us / are made upon ye condition
yt we keep ye law. As for an ensample: when the scripture says. Mat. xii. Axe
and it shall be geven you: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened
unto you. It is to be understand / if that when thy neyboure axeth / seeks or
knocks to ye / thou then show him the same mercy which thou desyrest of god
/ then has god bound him self to help ye again / and else not.

Also ye se that two things are required to begin a Christen man. The first is
a steadfast faith and trust in almighty God / to obtain all the mercy that he
has promised us / through the deservinge and merits of Christ's blood only /
without all respect to our own works. And the other is / that we forsake
evell and turn to God / to keep his laws and to fight against our selves and
our corrupt nature perpetuallye / that we may do the will of god every day
better and better.

This have I said (most dear reader) to warn the / least thou should be
deceaved / and should not only read the scriptures in vain and to no
proffit / but also unto thy greater da^nacion. For the nature of Gods word is
/ yt What the nature of gods word is
whosoever read it or hear it reasoned and disputed before him / it will
begin ymmediatlye to make him every day better and better / till he be
growe^ into a perfect man in the knowledge of Christ and love of the law of
God: or alse make him worse and worse / till he be hardened that he openly
resist the sprite of God / and then blaspheme / after the ensample of Pharao /
Cora / Abiron / Balam / Judas / Simon Magus and soche other.

This to be even so / the words of Christ Ioh. iii. do well confyrme. This is
condemnacio^ (says he) the light is come into ye world / but ye men loved
darcknes more then light for their deeds were evell. Behold / when the light
of Gods word comes to a man / whether he read it or here it preached and
testified / and he yet have no love thereto / to fassion his life thereafter /
but co^se^teth still unto his old deeds of ignorance: then begins his just
da^nacion ymmediatlye / and he is henceforth without excuse: in that he refused
mercy offered him. For God offers him mercy upon the condycio^ that he will
mende his livinge: but he will not come under the covenau^t. And from that
hour forward he waxes worsse and worsse / God taking his sprite of mercy
and grace from him for his unthankfulness sake.

And Paul writes. To. i. that the hethe^ because when they knew god / they had
no lust to honor him with godly lyvinge / therefore god powered his wrath upon
them and took his spirit from the^ and gave them up unto their hertes lusts
to serve sin / from iniquite to imquitie till they were through herdened and
past repentance.

And Pharao / because when the word of god was in his contre and gods people
scattered through out all his land / and yet nether loved them or it: therefore
god gave him up / and in taking his spirit of grace from him so hardened his
heart with covetousnes / that afterward no miracle could convert him.

Here to pertayneth the parable of the talentes. Mat. xxv. The Lord
commands ye talent to be taken away from the evell and slothful servaunt
and to bind him hand and foot and to cast him into utter darcknes / and to
geve the talent unto him that had ten / saying: to all yt have / moare shall be
geve^. But from him yt has not / that he has shall be taken from him. That is
to say / he that has a good heart toward ye word of God / and a set purpose
to fassio^ his deeds thereafter and to garnishe it with Godly lyvinge and to
testify it to other / the same shall increase more and more daily in ye grace
of Christ. But he that loves it not / to lyve thereafter and to edify other /
the same shall loose the grace of true knowledge and be blinded again and
every day ware worsse and worsse and blinder and blinder / till he be an utter
enemy of the word of God / and his heart so hardened / that it shall be
impossible to convert him.

And Luke xii. The servaunt that knows his masters will and prepares not him
self / shall be beaten with many stripes: that is / shall have greater
damnacion. And Matt. vii. all that here the word of God and do not thereafter
bylde on sand: that is / as the foundacio^ laid on sand cannot resist
violence of water / but is vnderminded and overthrown / even so ye faith of
them that have no lust ner love to ye law of god build upon the sand of
their own ymaginacions / and not on the rock of gods word according to his
covenau^tes / turns to desperacion in time of tribulacion and when god comes
to judge.

And the vyneyarde Matt. xxi. planted and hired out to the husbandme^ yt would
not render to the Lord / of the fruit in due time / and therefore was taken
from them and hired out to other / does confirm the same. For Christ says to
the Jews / ye kingdom of heve^ shall be taken from you and geve^ to a nation
that will bring forth the fruits thereof as it is come to pass. For the Jews
have lost the spiritual knowledge of god and of his commandments and also
of all the scripture / so yt they can understood nothing godly. And ye door
is so locked up that all their knocking is in vain / though many of them
take great pain for gods sake. And luke. xiii. the fygge tree that bears no
fruit is commanded to be plucked up

And finally / hereto pertayneth with infinite other / the terrible parable of
the unclean spirit (Luke. xi.) which after he is cast out / when he comes
and fyndeth his house swepte and garnysshed / takes to him seven worsse then
him self / and comes and enters in and dwells there / and so is the end
of ye man worse then the beginning. The Jews / they had cleansed the^ selves
with good word / from all outward ydolatrye and worshippinge of ydole. But their
hertes remained still faythlesse to godwarde and toward his mercy and truth
and therefore without love also and lust to his law and to their neyboures for
his sake / and through false trust in their own work) to which heresy / the
child of perdicion / the wicked bysshope of Rome with his lawyers has brought
us christen) were more abominable ydolaters then before / and become ten times
worse in the end then at the beginning. For the first ydolatre was sone spyed
and easy to be rebuked of ye prophets by the scripture. But the later is more
sotle to begyle withal / and an hundred times of more dyfficul^^ to be weded
out of men's hertes.

This also is a conclusion / nothing more certain / or more proved by ye
testimonye and ensamples of ye scripture: yt if any yt favors the word of
God / be so weke yt he cannot chaste his flesh / him will ye lord chastise and
scourge every day sharper and sharper / with trybulacyon and mysfortune / yt
nothing shall prospere with him but all shall go against him / whatsoever he
takes in hand / and shall vyset him with poverty / with sycknesses and
deseases / and shall plage him with plage upon plage / each more loathsome /
terryble and fearful then other / till he be at utter defyaunce with his
flesh.

Let us therefore yt have now at this time our eyes opened again through ye
tender mercy of God / keep a mean. Let us so put our trust in ye mercy of
god through christ / yt we know it our duty to keep ye law of God and to
love our neyboures for their fathers sake which created the^ and for their
lords sake which redeemed the^ and bought the^ so derely with his blood Let us
walk in ye fear of God / and have our eyes open unto both parts of Gods
couenau^tes / certified that none shall be partaker of the mercy / save he that
will fight agynst ye flesh / to keep ye law. And let us arm our selves with
this remembrance / that as christ's works justify from sin and set us in
ye favor of god / so our own deeds through workynge of ye spirit of God /
help us to co^tynew in ye favor and ye grace / into which christ has
brought us / and that we ca^ no longer co^tynew in favor and grace the^ our
heart are to keep the law.

Furthermore concerning ye law of God / this is a general co^clusio^ / yt ye
whole lawe^ whether they be ceremonies / sacrifices / ye or sacraments either /
or precepts of equity between man and man thorowout all degrees of ye world
/ all were given for our proffyt and necessyte only / and not for any need
yt God has of our keeping the^ / or yt his joy is increased thereby or yt ye
deed / for ye deed it self does please him That is all yt God requires of us
when we be at one with him and do put our trust in him and Love is the fullinge
of the law
love him / is yt we love every man his neyboure to pity him and to have
co^passyon on him in all his needs and to be merciful unto him. This to be
even so / christ testifies. Mat. vii. saying: this is ye law and ye
prophets. That is / to do as thou would be done to (according I mean to ye
doctrine of ye scripture) and not to do that thou would not have done to the
/ is all that the law requires and the Prophets. And Paul to the Roma.
xiii. affyrmeth also the love is the fullfyllinge of ye law / and that he
which loves / does of his own accord all that the law requires. And.i.
Timo. i. Paul says yt ye love of a pure heart and good conscience and faith
unfeigned is ye end and fullfillynge of ye law. For faith unfeigned in christ's
blood causes to love for christ's sake. Which love is ye pure love only and
ye only cause of a good conscience. For then is ye conscience pure / when ye
eye looks to christ in all her deeds / to do them for his sake and not for her
own synguler advantage or any other wicked purpose. And Iho^ both in his
gospel and also pistles / speaks never of any other law the^ to love one
another purely / affyrmynge yt we have God him self dwelling in us and all
that God desires / if we love one the other.

Saying then that faith to God and love and mercifullnes to our neyboures / is
all that ye law requires / therefore of necessite the law must be understood
and interpret by the^. So yt all inferior laws are to be kept and observed
as long as they be servants to faith and love: and then to be broken
ymedyatlye / if through any occasyon / they hurt either ye faith which we should
have to godward in the confidence of christ's blood or the love which we owe
to our neyboures for Christ's sake.

And therefore when ye blind pharisees murmured and grudged at him and his
desciples / that they brake ye saboth day and tradycions of the elders / and
that he him self did eat with publica^s and sinners / he answers. Mat. ix.
allegynge Esaias ye prophet: go rather and learn what this means / I requyer
mercy and not sacrifyce. And Mat. xii. Oh yt ye wist what this means / I
requyer mercy and not sacrifice. For only love and mercifullnes vndersto^deth
ye law / and else nothing. And he that has not yt written in his heart /
shall never understood ye law / no: though all ye a^gells of heaven went
about to teach him. And he that has that graue^ in his heart / shall not
only understood ye law but also shall do of his own inclinacion all that is
required of ye law / though never law Love only understands ye law.
had bee^ geve^: as all mothers do of the^ selves without law unto their
children / all that can be reqvyred by any law / love ouercomynge all pain /
greffe / tedyousnesse or lothsomnes: and eue^ so no doubt if we had co^tynewed
in our first state of innoce^cie / we should ever have fullfilled ye law /
without co^pulsio^ of ye law

And because the law (which is a doctrine through teaching every man his duty
/ does utter our corrupt nature) is sufficiently described by Moses / therefore
is little mention made thereof in the new testament / save of love only wherein
all ye law is included / as seldom mention is made of ye new testament in the
old law / save here and there are promyses made unto them / yt Christ should
come and bless the^ and deliver the^ / and yt the gospel and new testament
should be preached and publysshed unto all nations.

The gospel is glad tidings of mercy and Gospel.
grace and yt our corrupt nature shall be healed again for christ's sake and
for ye merits of his deseruinges only: Yet on yt condition yt we will turn
to God / to learn to keep his laws spiritually / yt is to say / of love for
his sake / and will also soffre the curing of our infirmyties.

The new testament is as much to say as a New testament.
new covenant. The old testament is an old te^porall covenant made between
God and ye carnal children of Abraham / Isaac and Jacob other wise called
Israel / upon ye deeds and ye observing of a te^porall law. Where ye reward
of ye keeping is te^porall life and prosperyte in ye land of Chanaan / and ye
breaking is rewarded with te^porall deeth and punyshme^t. But ye new testament
is an everlasting covenant made unto the children of God through faith in
christ / upon the deservynge of christ. Where eternal life is promised to all
that beleve / and death to all that are unbelieving. My deeds if I keep the
law are rewarded with the te^porall promise of this life. But if I believe in
christ / christ's deeds have purchased for me the eternal promise of the
everlasting life. If I commyt nothing worthy of deeth / I deserve to my
reward that no man kill me: if I hurt no man I am worthy that no man hurt
me. If I help my neyboure / I am worthy that he help me again. etc. So that
with outward deeds with which I serve other me^ / I deserve that other men do like
to me in this world: and they exte^de no further. But christ's deeds extend
to life everlasting unto all that believe etce. This be soffycie^t in this
place concerning ye law and the gospel / new testament and old: so that as
there is but one God / one christ / one faith and one baptime / eue^ so thou
understood that there is but one gospel / though many write it and many
preach it. For all preach the same Christ and bring the same glad tidings.
And thereto paul's pistles with ye gospel of John and his first epistle and the
first epistle of saint peter / are most pure gospel and most plainly and
rychlye described the glory of the grace of christ: If ye requyer more of the
law / seek in the prologe to the romans and in other places where it is
sofficientlye entreated of.

Repentance.
Concerning this word repentance or (as they used) penance / ye hebrew has
in ye old testament generally (Sob) turn or be converted. For which ye
tra^slacion that we take for saint Ieromes has most part (co^uerti) to turn
or be converted / and some time yet (agere penitencia^) And ye greek in the new
testament has perpetually (Metanoeo) to turn in the heart and mind / and to
come to ye right knowledge / and to a man's right wit again. For which
(Metanoeo) S. Ieromes tra^slacio^ has: sometime (ago penete^cia^) I do repent:
sometime (peniteo) I repent: sometime (penitror) I am repe^taunt: sometime (habeo
penitencia^) I have repentance: some time (penitet me) it repe^teth me. And
Erasmus uses much this word (resipisco) I come to my self or to my right
mind again. And the very sens and significacio^ both of the hebrew and also
of ye greek word / is / to be converted and to turn to God with all the heart
/ to know his will and to live according to his laws / and to be cured of
our corrupt nature with the oil of his spirit and wine of obedience to his
doctrine. Which conversion or turnynge if it be unfeigned / these four do
accompanye it and are included therein: Confession / not in the prestes ear /
for that is but man's inve^cion / but to God in ye heart and before all the
congregation of God / how yt we be sinners and sinful / and yt our hole
nature is corrupt and inclyned to sin and all unrighteous / and therefore
evil / wicked and damnable / and his law holy and Just / by which our
sinful nature is rebuked: and also to our neyboures / if we have offended
any person perticularlye. Then contricion / sorowfullnes that we be soche /
damnable sinners / and not only have sinned but are holy inclyned to syne
still. Thirdlye faith (of which our old doctoure have made no mention at all
in ye descripcio^ of their penance) yt God for christ sake does forgive us
and receave us to mercy / and is at one with us and will heal our corrupt
nature. And fourthlye satisfacio^ or amends making / not to god with holy
works / but to my neyboure whom I have hurt / and the congregation of God
whom I have offended (if any open crime be found in me) and submyttynge of a
ma^s self unto ye congregation or church of christ / and to ye officers of the
same / to have his life corrected and governed hence forth of the^ / according
to the true doctrine of ye church of christ. And note this: that as
satisfaction or amends making is counted ryghteousnes before ye world and a
purgynge of the sin: so yt the world when I have made a full amends / has
no further to compain. Even so faith in christ's blood is counted
ryghteousnes and a purgynge of all sin before God.

Morouer / he yt synneth against his brother synneth also against his father
allmyghtie God. And as ye sin committed against his brother / is pourged
before ye world with making amends or axynge forgeuenes / even so is ye sin
committed against God / pourged through faith in christ's blood only. For
christ says. Io. viii. except ye believe that I am he / ye shall dye in your
sins. That is to say / if ye think yt there is any other sacrifice or
satisfaccio^ to godwarde / then me / ye remain ever in sin before God / how
soever ryghteous ye apere before ye world. Wherefore now / whether ye call this
Metonoia / repentance / co^uersyon or turnynge again to God / either amendynge
etce. or whether ye say repent / be converted / turn to god / amend your
living or what ye lust / I am content so ye understand what is meant thereby /
as I have now declared.

Elders.
IN the old testament ye te^porall heedes and rulers of ye Iues which had ye
governance over ye lay or common people are called elders / as ye may se in
ye four euangelystes. Out of which custom paul in his epistle and also
peter / call ye prelates and spiritual gouerners which are bysshopes and
prestes / elders. Now whether ye call them elders or prestes / it is to me all
one: so yt ye understand yt they be officers and servants of the word of
God / unto the which all men both hie and low that will not rebel against
Christ / must obey as long as they preach and rule truly and no longer.

A prologe into the.iiii. Euangelystes showing what they were and their
auctoryte. And first of S. Matthew.
AS towchynge ye eua^gelystes: ye se in ye new testament clearly what they were
First matthew (as ye read Mat ix. Mar. ii. Luke. v) was one of christ apostles
/ and was with christ all the time of his preaching / and saw and heard his
own self almost all that he wrote.

Mark
OF Mark read (acts xii) how peter (after he was loosed out of prison by
the angel) came to Marks mothers house / where many of ye desciples were
prayenge for his delyuerau^ce. And paul and Barnabas took him with the^ from
Jerusalem and brought him to Antioche / acts.xii. And acts.xiii. paul and
Barnabas took Mark with them when they were sent out to preach: from whom he
also departed / as it apereth in the said chapter / and returned to Jerusalem
again. And acts. xv paul and Barnabas were at varyaunce about him / paul not
willing to take him with them / because he forsook the^ in their first Iorneye.
Notwtstondynge yet / when paul wrote ye epistle to ye collossya^s / Mark was
with him / as he says in the fourth chapter: of whom Paul also testifies /
both yt he was Barnabas sisters son and also his fellow worker in the
kyngedome of God. And.ii. Timothe. iiii paul commands Timothe to bring
Mark with him / affirmynge yt he was needful to him / to mynister to him.
Finallye / he was also with peter when he wrote his first epistle / and so
famylier yt peter calls him his son. Whereof ye se / of whom he learned his
gospel / even of the very apostles / with whom he had his co^tynuall
conversacion / and also of what auctoryte his writing is / and how worthy of
credence.

Luke.
LUcas was Paul's companyon / at the least way from ye.xvi. of the acts forth
and with him in all his trybulacyo^. And he went with paul at his last going
up to Jerusalem. And from thence he followed paul to Cesarea / where he lay two
year in prison And from Cesarea he went with paul to Rome where he lay two
other yer^s in prison. And he was with Paul when he wrote to ye collossyo^s /
as he testifies in ye fourth chapter saying: the beloved Lucas the phisicio^
saluteth you. And he was with paul when he wrote ye second pistle to Timothe /
as he says i^ ye fourth chapter saying: Only Lucas is with me. Whereby ye se
ye auctorite of the man and of what crede^ce and reverence his wrytinge is
worthy of / and thereto of whom he learned ye storye of his gospel / as he
him self says / how yt he learned it and searched it out with all dylygence
of them yt saw it and were also parttakers at the doing. And as for the acts
of ye apostles / he him self was at the doing of the^ (at the least) of the
most part / and had his part therein / and therefore wrote of his own
experyence.

John.
John / what he was / is manifest by the three first eua^gelistes. First
christ's apostle / and yt one of ye chief. The^ christ's nigh kinsma^ / and for
his synguler innoce^cie and softenes / singulerlye beloved and of synguler
famyliarite with christ / and ever one of ye three witnesses of most secret
things. The cause of his writing was certain heresies that arose in his time
/ and namelye two / of which one denied christ to be very man and to be come
in ye very flesh and nature of man. Against which two heresies he wrote both
his gospel and also his first epistle / and in ye beginning of his gospel
says yt the word or thing was at ye beginning / and was with God / and was
also very God and yt all things was created and made by yt / and yt it was
also made flesh: yt is to say / became very man. And he dwelt among us
(says he) and we saw his glory.

And in ye beginning of his pistle / he says we show you of ye thing yt was
from the beginning / which also we heard / saw with our eyes and our hands
ha^deled. And again we show you everlasting life / that was with ye father
and apered to us / and we heard and saw. and ce. In that he says that it was
from the beginning / and that it was eternal life / and that it was with God
/ he affirms him to be very God. And that he says / we heard / saw and
fealte / he witnesses that he was very man also. Ihon also wrote last / and
therefore touched not the story that the other had compiled. But writes most
of the faith and promyses / and of the sermones of Christ. This be sofficient
concerning the.iiii. Evangelists and their authority and worthynes to be
believed.



A warninge to ye reader if ought be escaped through necligence of the prynter /

english to ye other books that are all ready prynted / and so shall thou
perceive the truth of the ynglish.

Willyam Tindale / yet once more to the christen reader.
THou shall understand most dear reader / when I had taken in hand to look
over the new testament again and to compare it with ye greek / and to mende
whatsoever I could find amysse and had almost fynesshed ye labor: George
Joy secretly took in hand to correct it also by what occasyon his conscience
knows: and prevented me / in so much / yt his correccyo^ was prynted in
great nombre / yer mine began. When it was spyed and word brought me: though
it seemed to diverse other yt George Joy had not used ye office of an honest man
/ saying he knew yt I was in correctynge it myself: nether did walk after ye
rules of yt love and softenes which christ / and his desciples teach us / how
yt we should do nothing of strife to move debate / or of vain glory or of
covetousness. Yet I took ye thing in worth as I have done diverse other in time
past / as one that have moare experye^ce of ye nature and dysposicio^ of yt
man's complexion / and supposed that a little spyse of covetousness and vain
glory (two blind gydes) had been ye only cause yt moved him so to do /
about which things I strive with no man: and so followed after and corrected
forth and caused this to be prynted / without surmyse or lokynge on his
correctyon.

But when the pryntynge of mine was almost fynesshed / one brought me a copy
and showed me so many places / in soche wise altered that I was astonyed and
wondered not a little what furye had dryue^ him to make soche change and to
call it a diligent correction. For through out Mat. Mark and Luke perpetually:
and often in the actees / and sometime in John and also in the hebrews / where
he fyndeth this word Resurrection / he changes it into ye life after this
life / or very life / and soche like / as one that abhorred the name of the
resurreccion.

If that change / to turn resurreccion into life after this life / be a
dylygent correccion / then must my translacio^ be fautie in those places / and
saint Ieromes / and all ye translatours that ever I heard of in what tongue so
ever it be / from ye apostles unto this his dylyge^t correccyo^ (as he calls
it) which whither it be so or no / I permyt it to other men's judgments.

But of this I challenge George Joy / that he did not put his own name thereto
and call it rather his own translacion: and that he plays boo pepe / and i^
some of his books puts in his name and title / and in some keeps it out
It is lawful for who will / to translate and show his mind / though a
thousand had translated before him. But it is not lawful (thinks me) ner yet
expedye^t for the edifienge of the unity of the faith of christ / that
whosoever will / shall by his own auctorite / take another man's translacion
and put out and in and change at pleasure / and call it a correccion.

Moreover / ye shall understood that George Joy has had of a long time
marvelouse ymaginacio^s about this word resurrection / yt it should be taken
for the state of the souls after their departinge from their bodies / and has
also (though he has been reasoned with thereof and desired to cease) yet sown
his doctrine by secret lettres on that side the sea / and caused great division
among ye brethren. In so much that John Fryth being in preson in the toure
of London / a little before his death / wrote yt we should warn him and desyer
him to cease / and would have then written against him / had I not withstonde
him. Thereto I have been sense informed yt no small number through his curiosite
/ utterly deny the resurreccion of ye flesh and body / affirminge yt the
soul when she is departed / is the spiritual body of the resurreccion / and
other resurreccion shall there none be. And I have talked with some of them
myself / so doted in that folly / that it were as good persuade a post / as to
pluck that madness out of their brains. And of this all is George Joys
unquiet curiosite ye hole occasion / whether he be of the said faccio^ also /
or not / to that let him answer him self.

If George Joy will say (as I wot well he will) that his change / is the
sense and meaning of those scriptures. I answer it is sooner said then proved:
howbeit let other me^ judge. But though it were ye very meaning of the
scripture: yet if it were lawful after his ensample to every man to play boo
pepe with the translacions that are before him / and to put out ye words of
ye text at his pleasure and to put in every where his meaning: or what he
thought the meaning were / that were the next way to stablyshe all heresies
and to destroy the ground wherewith we should improve them. As for an ensample
/ when Christ says Io. v. The time shall come in ye which all that are in the
graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth: they that have done good
unto resurreccion of life / or with the resurreccion of life / and they have
done evell / unto ye reccion or with the resurreccion of damnacio^. George
Joys correccion is / they that have done good shall come forth into the very
life / and they that have done evell into the life of damnacio^ / thrustinge
clean out this word resurrection. Now by ye same auctorite / and with as good
reason shall another come and say of the rest of ye text / they yt are in ye
sepulchers / shall hear his voice / that ye sense is / the souls of the^ that
are in the sepulchers shall hear his voice / and so put in his diligent
correccion and mock out ye text / that it shall not make for ye resurrection
of the flesh / which thing also George Joys correccio^ does manyfestlye
affirm. If the text be left vncorrupt / it will pourge her self of all manner
false gloses / how sotle soever they be feigned / as a sethinge pot casts up
her scome. But if the false gloss be made the text / diligently oversene and
correct / wherewith then shall we correct false doctrine and defend Christ's
flock from false opinions / and from ye wicked heresies of raveninge of
wolves? In my mind therefore a little unfeigned love after the rules of Christ /
is worth much hie learning / and single and sleyght understanding that
edifieth in unity / is much better then sotle curiosite / and mekenes better
then bold arrogancye and stondinge over much in a man's own consayte.

Wherefore / concerning the resurreccion / I protest before god and our
savioure Jesus Christ / and before the universal congregation that beleveth in
him / that I beleve according to the open and manifest scriptures and
catholyck faith / that Christ is risen again in ye flesh which he received
of his mother ye blessed virgin marie / and body wherein he dyed. And yt we
shall all both good and bad rise both flesh and body / and apere together
before the judgment seat of christ / to receave every man according to his
deeds. And that the bodies of all that beleve and contynew in the true faith of
christ / shall be endewed with like immortalyte and glory as is ye body of christ

And I protest before God and our savioure Christ and all that beleve in him /
that I hold of ye souls that are departed as much as may be proved by
manifest and open scripture / and think the souls departed in the faith of
Christ and love of the law of God / to be in no worse case then ye soul of
Christ was / from ye time yt he delivered his sprite into the hands of his
father / until the resurreccion of his body in glory and immortalite.
Neverthelater / I confess openly / yt I am not persuaded yt they be all ready
in the full glory that Christ is in / or the elect angels of god are in.
Nether is it any article of my faith: for if it so were / I se not but then
the preachinge of the resurrection of the flesh were a thing in vain.
Notwithstondinge yet I am ready to beleve it / if it may be proved with open
scripture. And I have desired George Joy to take open textes that seem to make
for yt purpose / as this is. To day thou shall be with me in Paradise / to
make thereof what he could / and to let his dreams about this word
resurreccion goo. For I receave not in ye scripture yt pryvat interpretacio^ of
any man's brain / without open testimony of any scriptures agreinge thereto.

Moreover I take God (which alone sees ye heart) to record to my conscience /
besechinge him yt my part be not in ye blood of Christ / if I wrote of all yt
I have written through out all my book / ought of an evell purpose / of envy
or malice to any man / or to stere up any false doctrine or opinion in the
church of Christ / or to be auctor of any sect / or to draw disciples after
me / or that I would be esteemed or had in price above the least child yt is
borne / save only of pity and compassion I had and yet have on the blindness
of my brethren / and to bring them unto the knowledge of Christ / and to make
every one of them / if it were possible as perfect as an angel of heaven / and
to wede out all yt is not planted of our hevenly father / and to bring down
all that lyfteth up it self against the knowledge of the salvacion that is in
ye blood of Christ. Also / my part be not in Christ / if mine heart be not to
follow and lyve according as I teach / and also if mine heart weep not night
and day for mine own sin and other men's indiffere^tlye / besechinge God
to co^vert us all / and to take his wrath from us / and to be merciful as well
to all other men / as to mine own soul / caringe for the wealth of the realm
I was borne in / for the king and all that are thereof / as a tender hearted
mother would do for her only son.

As concerning all I have translated or other wise written / I beseech all men
to read it for that purpose I wrote it: even to bring them to the knowledge
of the scripture. And as far as the scripture approves it / so far to
allow it / and if in any place the word of god dysalow it / there to refuse
it / as I do before our savyour Christ and his congregation. And where they
find fautes / let them show it me / if they be nigh / or write to me / if they
be far of: or write openly against it and improve it / and I promise them /
if I shall perceave that there reasons conclude I will confess mine ignorance
openly.

Wherefore I beseech George Joy / ye and all other to / for to translate ye
scripture for them selves / whether out of Greek / Latin: or Hebrew. Or (if
they will needs) as ye fox when he has pyssed in ye grayes hole chalengeth it
for his own / so let them take my translacions and labors / and change and
alter / and correct and corrupt at their pleasures / and call it their own
translacio^s / and put to their own names / and not to play boo pepe after
George Joys manner. Which whether he have done faithfully and truly / with
such reverence and fear as becomes the word of God / and with soche love
and mekenes and affeccion to unite and circu^spexcion that the ungodly have
none occasion to rail on the verite / as becomes ye servauntes of Christ / I
refer it to the judgments of them that know and love the troth. For this
I protest / that I provoke not Joy ner any other man (but am provoked / and
that after the spytfullest manner of provokynge) to do sore against my will and
with sorrow of heart that I now do. But I nether can ner will soffre of any man
/ that he shall goo take my translacion and correct it without name / and make
soche chaungynge as I my self durst not do / as I hope to have my part in
Christ / though the hole world should be geve^ me for my labor.

Finally that new Testament thus dylige^tly corrected / beside this so often
puttinge out this word resurreccion / and I wot not what other change / for
I have not yet reed it over / has in the end before the Table of the
Epistles and Gospelles this title: (Here ends the new Testament dylygentlye
ouersene and correct and printed now again at Andwarp / by me wydow of
Christophell of Endhouen. In the year of our Lord. A.M. D. xxxiiii. in

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. When his mother Mary was
betrouthed to Joseph / before they came to dwell togedder / she was found with
child by ye holy ghost. The^ Joseph her husband being a perfect man and loath
to make an ensample of her / was Ensample that is to say, to bring her out
to punysheme^t for the ensample of other. A promise. Esaie vij. c.
minded to put her away secretly. Whill he thus thought / behold ye angel of
ye Lord appeared unto him in a dream / saying: Joseph ye son of David /
fear not to take unto ye / Mary thy wife. For that which is co^ceaved in her
is of the holy ghost. She shall bring forth a son / and thou shall call his
name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins.

Emanuel

And Joseph as soon as he awoke out of sleep / did as the angel of the Lord
bade him / and took his wife unto him / and knew her not Jesus / yt is a
sauyoure.
till she had brought forth her first son / and called his name Jesus.

The.ii. Chapter.


When Herod ye king had herd this / he was troubled / and all Jerusalem with
him / and he gathered all ye chief Prestes and Scribes of the people / and axed
of them where Christ should be borne. And they said unto him: at Bethlee^ in
Jury. For thus it is written by the Prophet. Miche. v.
And thou Bethleem in the land of Jury / art not the leest concerning the
Princes of Judah. Ioa^. vij. f
For out of the shall come the captain / that shall govern my people Israhel.

Then Herod prevely called the wise men /

When they had heard the king / they departed: and lo the star which they
saw in ye eeste / went before them / till it came and stood over the place
where the child was. When they saw the star / they were marvelously glad:
and went into the house / and found the child with Mary his mother / and
kneled down and worshipped him / and opened their treasures / and offered unto
him gifts / gold / fra^ckynsence and myrre. And after they were warned of God
in a dream / that they should not go again to Herod / they returned into
their own country another way.

When they were departed: behold the angel of the Lord / by ye Prophet which
says / Ozee vij. a.
out of Egypt have I called my son.

Then Herod perceavynge yt he was moocked of the wise men / was exceeding wroth
/ and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethleem / and in all
the costs there of / as many as were two year old and under / according to
the time which he had diligently searched out of the wise men.

Then was fulfilled yt which was spoken by the Prophet Jeremy saying: Jeremy
xxxj. c.
On the hills was a voice herd / morning / weeping / and Were not: that is,
be cause they appeared no where.


When Herod was deed: behold / an angel of ye Lord appeared in a dream to
Joseph in Egypt saying: arise and take ye child and his mother / and go into
ye land of Israel. For they are deed which sought ye chyldes life. The^ he
arose up / and took ye child and his mother / and came into the land of
Israhel. But when he heard yt Archelaus did raygne in Jury / in ye room of
his father Herod / he was afraid to goo thither. Not withstondynge after he
was warned of god in a dream / he turned a side into ye parties of Galile /
and went and dwelt in a cite called Nazareth / to fulfill yt which was spoken
by ye Prophets: Iudic. xiij Esaie. xj
he shall be called a Nazarite

and preached in the wilderness of Jury / saying: Repent / the kingdom of heaven
is at hand. This is he of whom it is spoken by the Prophet Esaias / which
says: The voice of a crier in wyldernes / prepare the Lords way / and make
his paths straight.

This Iho^ had his garment of camels here and a gerdell of a skin about his
loins. Mark. j. a

When he saw many of ye Pharisees and of ye Saduces come to his baptim / he
said unto the^: O generacio^ of vipers / who has taught Luke iij. b
you to fle from the vengeance to come? Bring forth therefore the fruits
belonging to repentance. And se that ye ons think not to say in your selves
/ we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto you / that God is able of
these stones to raise up chyldern unto Abraham. Eue^ now is ye axe put unto ye
rote of ye trees:

I baptize you in water in toke^ of repentance: Mark. j. b Luke iij. c Joan.
j. d
but he yt comes after me / is myghtier then I / whose shues I am not worthy
to bear. He shall baptize you with ye holy ghost and with fire: which has also
his fan in his ho^d / and will pourge his flower / and gadre ye wheet into his
garner / Luke iij. d
and will burn ye chafe with vnque^cheable fire

Then came Jesus from Galile to Jordan / Mark. j. b Luke iij. d
forbade him / saying: I ought to be baptized of the: and co^mest thou to me?
Jesus answered and said to him: Let it be so now. For thus it becomes us to
fulfill all rightwesnes. All ryghteousnes: that is to do all the ordynau^ces of
God for soche purpose as god ordained them for.
Then he suffered him. And Jesus as soon as he was baptized / came straight out
of ye water. And lo heaven was open over him: and Ihon saw the spirit of God
descend like a dove / and light upon him. And lo there came a voice from heven
sayng: This is that my beloved son in whom is my delight.

The.iiii. Chapter.
THen was Jesus ledd away of ye spirit Mark.i. b Lu. iiij. a
days and fourtye nights / he was afterward an hungered. Then came to him the
tempter / and said: if thou be the son of God / command that these stones
be made breed. He answered and said: yt is written / man shall not lyve by
bread only / but by every word yt proceadeth out of the mouth of God. Dutero.
viij. a.


Then the devyll took him up into ye holy Psalm. xc. c
geve his angels charge over the / and with their hands they shall hold ye up
/ that thou dashe not thy foot against a stone. And Jesus said to him / it is
written also: Thou Dut. vj. c
shall not tempte thy Lord God.

The devyll took him up again and led him in to an exceeding hye mountain /
and showed him all the kingdoms of ye world / and all ye glory of them / and
said to him: all these will I give ye / if thou will faull down and worship
me. Dut. vj. c. and.x. d.
Then said Jesus unto him. Avoid Satan. For it is written / thou shall worship
ye Lord thy God / and him only shall thou serve.

Then the dyvell left him / and behold / the angels came and ministered unto
him.

When Jesus had heard yt Ihon was Mar. j. b. Lu. iiij. c. Ioa^. iiij. f Mark.

From yt time Jesus began to preach / and to say: repent / for ye ki^gdome
of heve^ is at ho^de

As Jesus walked by the sea of Galile / he Mark. j. a Luke v. a.
saw two brethren: Simon which was called Peter / and Andrew his brother /
casting a Peter and Andrew.
neet into the sea / for they were fisshers / and he said unto them / follow
me / and I will make you fisshers of men. And they straight way left their
nets / and followed him.

And he went forth from thence / and saw James Ihon.
Ihon his brother / in the ship with zebede their father / mendynge their
nets / and called them. And they with out taryinge left the ship and their
father and followed him.

And Jesus went about all Galile / teaching in their synagoges / and
preaching ye gospel of the kingdom / and healed all manner of sickness / and
all manner dyseases among ye people. And his fame spreed abroode through out
all Siria. And they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with
diverse diseases and gripinge / and them yt were possessed with devils / and
those which were lunatyke / and those that had the palsy: and he healed the^.
And there followed him a great nombre of people / from Galile / and from the ten
cities / and from Jerusalem / and from Jury / and from ye regions that lie
beyond Jordan.

The.v. Chapter.
When he saw the people / he went up into a mountain / and when he was set /
his disciples came to him / and he opened his mouth / and taught them saying:
Blessed are the poor in sprete: for theirs Luke vj. d
is the kingdom of heven. Blessed are they that morn: for they shall be
conforted. Blessed are the meke: for they shall inheret the earth. Blessed are
they which honger and thurst for Couenau^tes.
rightewesnes: for they shall be filled. Blessed are ye merciful: for they shall
obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall se God. Blessed
are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed i. Pe.
iiij. c
are they which suffer persecucio^ for rightwesnes sake: for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men reuyle you / and persecute you / and
shall falsely say all manner of yvell saynges against you for my sake. Rejoice
and be glad / for great is your reward in heven. For so persecuted they ye
Prophets which were before your days.

ye are ye salt of the earth: Salt. Mar. ix. ^ Luke xiiij a.
but and if ye salt Light. Mar. iiij. c Lu. viij. c and.xj. c.
A cite yt is set on an hill / cannot be hid / nether do men light a ca^dell
and put it under a busshell / but on a candelstick / and it lights all that

good works / and glorify your father which is in heven.

Think not yt I am come to destroy the Lu. xvj. d
one iott or one title of the law shall not escape / till all be fulfilled.

Whosoever breaks one of these lest commaundmentes / and teaches men so / he
shall be Iaco. ij. d
called the leest in the kingdom of heve^. But whosoever observes and
teaches / ye same shall be called great in the kingdom of heven.

For I say unto you / except your rightewesnes excede / the righetewesnes of
ye Scribes and Pharisees / ye cannot enter into ye kingdom of heven.

ye have herd how it was said unto the^ of Exo. xx c. and Dut. v. b.
ye old time: Thou shall not kill. For whosoever kylleth / shall be in danger
of judgment. But I say unto you / whosoever is anger with his brother / shall be
in danger of judgment. Whosoever says unto his brother Racha / Racha
shall be in danger of a counsel. But whosoever Hell.


Therefore when thou offrest thy gift at the Reconcylynge.

there thine offrynge before the altre / and go thy way first and be reconcyled

Agree with thine adversary quicklye / whiles Lu. xij. ^
thou art in ye way with him / lest that adversary deliver ye to ye judge /
and ye judge delivre ye to ye minister / and the^ thou be cast into preson. I
say unto ye verily: thou shall not come out thence till thou have paid ye
utmost farthi^ge.

Advoutre.
ye have heard how it was said to the^ of Exode.xx. c Ecclesi. xij. d.
old time: Thou shall not co^mitt advoutrie. But I say unto you / that
whosoever looks on a wife / lustynge after her / has committed Mar. ix. g


Right eye.
Wherefore if thy right eye offend ye / pluck him out / and cast him from the.
Better it is for the yt one of thy members perisshe / then that thy hole body
should be cast into hell. Also Right hand.
if thy right hand offend ye / cut him of and cast him from the. Better yt is
that one of thy members perisshe / then that all thy body should be cast in to
hell.

Deuorcement.
It is said / whosoever put away his wife / let him geve her a testymonyall
also of the devorcement. Mar. x. b Lu. xvj. d i. Corin. vij. b.
But I say unto you: whosoever put away his wife (except it be for
fornicacion) causes her to break matrymony. And whosoever maryeth her that is
devorsed / breaks wedlock.

Again ye have heard how it was said to Leuiti. xix. c. Exo. xx b. Du. v. b.
Iac. v. c
the^ of old time / thou shall not forswere thy self / but shall perform
thine oath to God. But I say unto you / swear not at all: nether by heaven /
for it is Gods seat: nor yet by the earth / for it is his footstool: nether
by Jerusalem / for Swear.
it is ye cite of ye great king: nether shall thou swear by thy heed /
because thou can not make one white here / or black: But your co^municacion
shall be / ye / ye: nay / nay. For what soever is more then yt / comes of yvell.

ye have heard how it is said / an eye for Exodi. xxj. c. Dutero. xix. c.
Leuiti. xxiiij. c Luke vj. c
an eye: a tothe for a tothe. But I say to you / that ye resist not wrong.
But whosoever geve the a blow on thy right cheke / turn to him the other.
Right cheke.
And if any man will sue the at the law / and take away thy coote / let him
have thy cloocke also. And whosoever will compel the to goo a mile / goo with
him twain. Geve to him that axeth / and from him that would borowe turn not
away.

ye have heard how it is said: thou shall love thine neghbour / and hate
thine enemy. But I say unto you / love your enemies. Leui. xix d. Leui. vj. d
Bless the^ that coursse you. Do good to them that hate you. Pray for them
which do you wrong and persecute you / that ye may be y^ chyldern of your
father that is in heaven: for he makes his sun to arise on ye yvell / and on
the good / and sends his reyn on the just and unjust. For if ye love them /
which love Lu. vj. f.
you: what reward shall ye have? Do not the Publicans even so? Publicans.
And if ye be friendly to your brethren only: what singular thing do ye? Do
not the Publicans like wise? ye shall therefore be perfect / eve^ as your
father which is in heaven / is perfect.

The.vi. Chapter.
Almose.
Take heed to your alms. That ye geve it not in the sight of men / to the
intent that ye would be seen of them. Or else ye get no reward of your father
which is in heve^. Tro^pet.
When soever therefore thou gevest thine alms / thou shall not make a tro^pet to
be blowe^ before the / as ye ypocrites do in the synagogis and in the stretis /
for to be preysed of men. Verily I say unto you / they have their reward. But
when thou do thine alms / let not thy lift hand know / what thy right
hand does / yt thine alms may be secret: and thy father

Prayer
And when thou prayest / thou shall not be as ye ypocrytes are. For they love to
stond and pray in the synagoges / and in the corners of ye streets / because
they would be seen of men. Verily I say unto you / they have their reward.
But when thou prayest / enter into thy chamber / and shut thy door to the / and
pray to thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seith in secret /

Then he arose and rebuked ye wyndes and the sea / and there followed a great

When the Pharisees saw that / they said to his disciples: Publica^s eat with

why eats your master with publicans and sinners? When Jesus herd that / he
said unto them: The whole neade not the physician / but they that are sick.
Goo and learn / what that means: Mercy and not sacrifice. Oze. vi. c
I have pleasure in mercy / and not in offering. For I am not come to call the
rightewes / but the sinners to repentance.

Then came ye disciples of Ihon to him Ihons disciples fast.
saying: why do we and the Pharisees fast often: but thy disciples fast not? And
Jesus said unto them: Can ye wedding children morn as long as ye bridegroom
is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them / and
then shall they fast. New and old agree not.
No man peceth and old garment with a piece of new cloothe. For then takes he
away ye piece again from the garment / and the rent is made greater. Nether do
men put new wine into old vessels / for then the vessels break / and the

him about / and beheld her saying: Daughter be of good conforte / thy faith
has made the safe. And she was made whole even that same hour.

And when Jesus came into ye rulers housse / and saw the minstrels and the

Then touched he their eyes / saying: acordynge to your faith / be it unto

And Jesus went about all cities and tounes / teaching in their synagoges and

Sheep among wolves. Wise as serpe^tes. Innocent as doves
Behold I send you forth as sheep among wolves. Be ye therefore wise as
serpe^tes / and innocent as doves. Beware of men / for they shall deliver you
up to ye cousels / and shall scourge you in their synagoges. And ye shall be
brought to the heed rulers and kings for my sake / in witness to them and to

But when they delyver you up / take no thought how or what ye shall sspeake /

For it is not ye that speak / but ye sprite of your father which speaks in

fathers and mothers / and shall put them to deethe: and ye shall be hated of
all me^ for my name. But he that endures to the end / shall be saved.

Disciple
The disciple is not above his master: nor yet ye servau^t above his lord. It
is enough for the disciple to be as his master is / and that the servaunt be as
his lord is. if they have called the lord of the housse beelzebub: how much
more shall they call them of his household so? Fear the^ not therefore.

There is no thing so close / that shall not Mar. iiij. c Lu. viij. c and.xij.

What I tell you in dercknes / that speak ye in light. And what ye hear in
the ear / that preach ye on the housse tops.

Fear.
And fear ye not them which kill the body / and be not able to kill the soul.
But rather fear him / which is able to destroy both soul and body into
hell. Sparowes.
Are not two sparowes sold for a farthinge? And none of them does light on the
ground / with out your father. And now are all the heeris of your heedis
numbered. Fear ye not therefore: ye are of more value then many sparowes.

/ which were not lawful / for him to eat / nether for the^ which were with him
but only for ye prestes. Or have ye not reed in ye law / how that ye prestes
in ye temple break the saboth day / and yet are blamlesse? But I say unto
you: that here is one greater then ye temple. Wherefore if ye had wist what this
saying meneth: Mercy and not sacrifice.
I require mercy and not sacrifice: ye would never have condemned innoce^tes. For
ye son of man is lord even of ye saboth day.

which of you would it be / if he had a sheep fallen into a pit on ye saboth

said he to ye man: stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth. And it
was made whole again like unto ye other.

Then ye Pharyses went out / and held a counsel Esaie xij. a.

Mar. iij. ^ Lu. vj. b. Blind and dome
Then was brought to him / one possessed with a devyll which was both blind and
domme: and he healed him / insomoch that he which was blind and domme / both
spoke and saw. And all the people were amassed / and said: Is not this that
son of David? But when the Pharisees heard that / they said: This fellow
dryveth ye devyls no another wise out but by Beelzebub.
the help of Beelzebub ye chief of the devyls.

But Jesus knew their thoughts / and said to the^. Every kingdom divided with
in it sylfe / shall be brought to naught. Nether shall any cite or household
devyded against it sylfe / co^tynue. So if satan cast out satan / the^ is he
devyded agenst him sylfe. How shall then his kingdom endure? Also if I by ye
help of Beelzebub cast out devyls: by whose help do your children cast them
out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out the devyls by the
sprite of God: then is the kingdom of god come on you?

Either how can a man enter into a strong man's housse / and violently take

Wherefore I say unto you / all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgeven

But whosoever speaks against the holy ghost / it shall not be forgeven him:

Luke vj. b
Either make ye tree good / and his fruit good also: or else make ye tree evyll /

For ye tree is known by his fruit. O generacio^ of viperes / how can ye say
well when ye your selves are evyll? For of ye abounda^ce of the heart / ye
mouth speaks. A good man out of ye good treasure of his heart / brings
forth good things. And an evyll man out of his evyll treasure / brings forth
evyll things. Ydell word.
But I say unto you / that of every ydell word that men shall have spoken: they
shall geve acountes at the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shall be
justified: and by thy words thou shall be condemned.

Then answered certain of the scribes and Lu. xj. b.
of the Pharisees saying: Sign.

The unclean spirit comes again.
When the unclean sprite is gone out of a man / he walks throughout dry places
/ seking reest and fyndeth none. Then he says: I will return again into my

empty and swepte and garnisshed. Then he goes his way / and takes unto him
seven other spretes worsse then him silfe / and so enter they in and dwell
there. And the end of that man is worsse then the beginning. Even so shall it
be with this evell nation.

mother and thy brethren stand without / desiringe to speak with the.

He answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? or who are my
brethren? And he stretched forth his hond over his disciples and said: behold
my mother and my brethren. For whosoever does my fathers will which is in
heve^ / the same is my brother / suster and mother.

The.xiii. Chapter.
Mar. iij. a Lu. viij. a
THe same day went Jesus out of ye house / and sat by the sea side / and much
people resorted unto him / so greatly yt he went and sat in a ship / and all
the people stood on ye shoore. And he spoke many things to the^ in similitudes
/ saying: A sower.
Behold / ye sower went forth to sow. And as he sowed / some fell by ye ways
side / and the fowlle came and devoured it up. Some fell apo^ stony ground
where it had not much earth / and a no^ne it spro^ge up / because it had no
depth of earth: and when ye sun was up / it cauht heet / and for lake of
rotynge wyddred away. Some fell among thorns / and the thorns spro^ge up
and chooked it. Part fell in good ground / and brought forth good fruit: some
an hundred fold / some sixty fold / some thyrty fold. Whosoever has ears to
hear let him hear.

And the disciples came and said to him: A covenant to the^ that love the
word of god to forther it, that they shall encracee therein, and another that
they that love it not, shall lose it again, and wax blind.
For whosoever has to him shall be geven: and he shall have abundance. But
whosoever has not: from him shall be takyn a way even that he has. Therefore
speak I to them in similitudes: for though they se / they se not: and hearing
they hear not: nether understand. And in the^ is fulfilled ye Prophecy of
Esayas / which prophecy says: with the ears ye shall hear and shall not
understand / and with the eyes ye shall se / and shall not perceave. Esa. vi.
e Mar. iiii. b. Lu. viij b. Io. xii. f. Actuu^ xxviij. To. xj. b.
For this peoples hertes are wexed gross / and their ears were dull of herynge
/ and their eyes have they closed / lest they should se with their eyes / and
hear with their ears / and should understand with their hertes / and should
turn / that I might heal them.

Luke x. d.
But blessed are your eyes / for they se: and your ears / for they hear.
Verily I say unto you / that many Prophets and perfaicte me^ have desired to
se tho things which ye se / and have not seen the^: and to hear tho things
which ye hear / and have not herd the^. Mar. iiij. b. Luke viij. b. The sower
is expownded
Hear ye therefore ye similitude of the sower. Whosoever hears the word of ye
kingdom / and understands it not / there comes the evyll man and catches
away yt which was sown in his heart. And this is he which was sown by the
way side. But he yt was sown in ye stony ground / is he which hears the
word of God / and ano^ne with joy receaveth it / yet has he no rotte in him
self / and therefore dureth but a season: for as soon as tribulacion or
persecucion aryseth because of the word / by and by he falls. He yt was
sown among thorns / is he yt hears ye word of God: but the care of this
world / and the dissaytfulnes of riches choke ye word / and so is he made
unfruitfully. He which is sown in ye good ground / is he yt hears ye word
and vndersto^deth it / which also bears fruit and brings forth / some an.C.
fold / some sixty fold / and some.xxx. fold.

Another similitude put he forth unto the^ Tares.
The kingdom of heve^ is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field.
But whyll men slepte / there came his foo and sowed tares among ye wheat / and
went his way. When ye blade was spro^ge up and had brought forth fruit / the^
appeared ye tares also. The servaunte came to the householder / and said unto
him: Sir sowedest not thou good seed in thy closse / from whence the^ has it
tares? He said to the^ / the envious man has done this. Then ye servaunte
said unto him: will thou then yt we go and gader them? But he said / nay /
lest whill ye go about to wede out ye tares / ye pluck up also with them ye
wheat by ye rotte: let both grow to gether till harvest come / and in time
of harvest / I will say to the repers / gather ye first ye tares / and bind
the^ in sheves to be bre^t: but gather the wheete into my barn.

Mar. iiij. d. Luke xiij. d. Mustard seed.
Another parable he put forth unto the^ saying. The kingdom of heve^ is like
unto a grain of mustard seed / which a man takes and sows in his field /
which is ye leest of all seeds. But when it is groune / it is the greatest
among yerbes / and it is a tree: so yt the bryddes of the air come and bylde
in the branches of it.

Lu. xiij. c Leven.
Another similitude said he to them. The kingdom of heven is like unto leve^
which a woman takes and hydeth in.iii. peckes of meele / till all be levended.

Mark.iiij. d.
All these things spoke Jesus unto the people by similitudes / and with out
similitudes spoke he nothing to them / to fulfill that which was spoken by the
Prophet saying: Psalm.lxxvij. ^
I will open my mouth in similitudes / and will speak forth things which have
been kept secret from the beginning of the world.

Then sent Jesus ye people away / and came to housse. And his disciples came
unto him / saying: declare unto us the similitude of the tares of the field.
Tares are expownded.
Then answered he and said to them. He that sows the good seed / is the son
of man. And ye field is the world. And the children of the kingdom / they are
ye good seed. And the tares are the children of ye wicked. And the enemy that
sows the^ / is ye devell. Apocaly. xiiij. c.
The harvest is ye end of the world. And the repers be ye angels. For eve^ as
the tares are gaddred and bre^t in ye fire: so shall it be in ye end of this
world. The son of man shall Sapien. iiij. b.
Whosoever has ears to hear / let him hear.

Treasure.
Again ye kingdom of heve^ is like unto treasure hid in the field / ye which
a man fyndeth and hides: and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has
/ and byeth that field.

Pearls.
Again ye kingdom of heve^ is like unto a merchant that seeks good pearls /
which when he had found one precious pearl / went and sold all that he had /
and bought it.

Net.
Again the kingdom of heve^ is like unto a neet cast into ye see / yt gadereth
of all kind of fysshes: which when it is full / men draw to land / and sit
and gadre the good in to vessels / and cast the bad away. So shall it be at
the end of the world. The angels shall come out / and sever the bad from the
good / and shall cast them in to a furnes of fire: there shall be waylinge and
gnasshynge of teth.

Jesus said unto them: understand ye all New and old.
The^ said he unto them: Therefore every scribe which is taught unto the
kingdom of heve^ / is like an householder / which brings forth / out of his
treasure / things both new and old.

Mar. vj. a Luke iiij. c Ioh. iiij. c
And it came to pass when Jesus had finisshed these similitudes / yt he
departed thence / and came in to his own country / and taught them in their
synagoges / in so much yt they were astonyed Ioh. vj. e. Carpe^ter
and said: whence comes all this wisdom and power unto him? Is not this the
carpe^ters son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren be called
James and Ioses and Simo^ and Judas? And are not his susters all here with us?
Whence has he all these things. And they were offended by him. Prophet
The^ Jesus said to the^ a Prophet is not with out honor / save in his own
country / and among his own kynne. And he did not many miracles there / for
there vnbelefes sake.

The.xiiii. Chapter.
Ma. vj. b. Lu. ix. a.
AT that time Herod the tetrarcha heard of the fame of Jesus / and said unto
his servau^tes: This is Ihon ye baptist. He is risen again from deeth / and
therefore are soche miracles wrought by him. John baptist is prisoned. Ma. vj.
b. Lu. iij. d.
For Herod had taken Ihon and bound him and put him in preson for Herodias sake
/ his brother Philips wife. For Ihon said unto him: Yt is not lawful for the
to have her. And when he would have put him to deeth / he feared the people /
because they counted him as a prophet.

But when Herodes birth day was come / the daughter of Herodias daunsed before
them / and pleased Herod. Wherefore he promised with an oath / that he would geve
her what soever she would axe. And she being informed of her mother before /
said: geve me here Ihon baptistes heed in a platter. And ye king sorowed.
Nevertheless for his oaths sake / and for their sakis which sat also at ye
table / he commanded yt to be geven her: Johan baptist is behedded
and sent and beheeded Ihon in the preson / and his heed was brought in a
platter and geven to the damsel / and she brought it to her mother. And his
disciples came and took up his body / and buried it: and went and told Jesus.

When Jesus heard that / he departed thence by ship in to a desert place out
of ye way. Lu. ix. b. Mar. vj. d Io. vj. a*
And when the people had heard there of / they followed him a foot out of their
cities. And Jesus went forth and saw much people / and his heart did melte
upon them / and he healed of them those that were sick. When even was come /
his disciples came to him saying. This is a deserte place / and the day is
spent: let the people depart / yt they may go in to ye tounes / and bye them
vytayllis. But Jesus said unto them. They have no neade to go away. Geve ye
the^ to eat. Five loves and two fysshes.
Then said they unto him: we have here but.v. loves and two fysshes. And he
said: bring the^ hither to me. And he commanded ye people to sit down on ye
grass: and took ye.v. loves / and the.ii. fysshes and looked up to heven and
blessed / and brake and gave the loves to his disciples / and the disciples
gave them to ye people. And they did all eat / and were suffised. And they
gadered up of ye gobbetes that remained xii. basketes full. And they yt ate /
were in no^bre about.v. M. men / beside women and children.

Mar. vj. f Ioh. vj. b
And straight way Jesus made his disciples enter into a ship / and to goo
over before him / whill he sent ye people away. And as soon as he had sent the
people away / he went up into a mountain alone to pray. And when night was
come / he was there him silf alone. And the ship was now in the mids of the sea / and was toost with waves / for it was a contrary wind. Jesus walked on
ye sea.
In the fourth watch of ye night Jesus came unto them walking on the sea. And
when his disciples saw him walking on the sea / they were troubled / saying:
it is some spirit / and cried out for fear. And straight way Jesus spoke
unto them saying: be of god cheer / it is I / be not a frayed.

Peter walks on the water.
Peter answered him / and said: master / if thou be he / bid me come unto the
on the water. And he said / come. And when Peter was come down out of ye
ship / he walked on ye water / to go to Jesus. But when he saw a mighty
wind / he was afraid. And as he began to synke / he cried saying: master
save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his ho^de / and caught him / and
said to him: O thou of little faith / wherefore did thou dout? And as soon
as they were come in to ye ship / ye wind ceased. Then they that were in
the ship / came and worshipped him / saying: of a truth thou art ye son
of God. Mar. vj. g Genazareth.
And when they were come over / they went in to ye land of Genazareth. And when
ye men of yt place had knowledge of him / they sent out in to all yt country
round about / and brought unto him all that were sick / and besought him /
that they might touch the hemme of his vesture only. hemme.
And as many as touched it were made safe.

THen came to Jesus scribes and pharisees from Jerusalem / saying: Tradiciones.
Exodi. xx. e. Dut. v. ^ ephe. vj. ^ exo. xxj^ leu. xx. ^ pro. xx. c
why do thy disciples transgress the traditions of ye elders? for they wesshe
not their hondes / when they eat breed. He answered / and said unto them: why
do ye also transgress ye co^maundment of God / through your tradicions? For
God commanded / saying: honor thy father and mother / and he that cursseth
father or mother / shall suffer deeth. But ye say / every man shall say to
his father or mother: That which thou desyrest of me to help ye with: is geven
God: and so shall he not honor his father or his mother. And thus have ye
made / yt the co^maundment of God is with out effect / through your
traditions. Ypocrites well prophesyed of you Esaie.xxix. d.

honors me with their lips / howbe it their hertes are far from me: but
in vain they worship me teachinge doctrines / which are nothing but Men's
^receptes. ma. vij. c
men's precepts.

And he called the people unto him / and said What defiles a man.
That which goes in to the mouth / defyleth not ye man: but that which comes
out of the mouth / defyleth the man.

Then came his disciples / and said unto him. Perceavest thou not / how that
the pharisees are offended in hearing this saying? He answered / and said:
Plants. Lu. vj. f.
all plants which my heve^ly father has not planted / shall be plucked up by the
rotes. Let them alone / they be the blind leaders of the blind. If the blind
leede the blind / boothe shall fall in to the dyche. Blind leaders. mar. vij.

Then answered Peter and said to him: declare unto us this parable. Then said
Jesus: are ye yet with out understanding? perceaye ye not / that what soever
goes in at the mouth / descends down in to the belly / and is cast out in to
the draught? With what a man is defiled.
But those thingis which proceed out of the mouth / come from the heart / and
they defyle the man. For out of the heart come evyll thoughtis / murder /
breakyng of wedlock / whordo^ / theefte / falce witness berynge / blasphemye.
These are the thingis which defyle a man. But to eat with vnwesshen hondes /
defyleth not a man.

Mar. vij c The woman of Cananye
And Jesus went thence / and departed in to the costis of Tire and Sidon. And
behold a woman which was a Cananite came out of ye same ceostis / and cried
unto him / saying: have mercy on me Lord the son of David / my daughter is
pytiously vexed with a devyll. And he gave her never a word to answer. Then
came to him his disciples / and besought him saying: send her away / for she
follows us cryinge. He answered / and said: I am not sent / but unto ye loost
sheep of ye housse of Israel. Then she came and worshipped him / saying:
master help me. He answered and said: it is not good / to take the chyldrens
breed / and to cast it to whelps. She answered and said: truth Lord:
nevertheless the whelps eat of the cro^mes / which fall from their masters
table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her. O woman great is thy faith / be
it to the / even as thou desyrest. And her daughter was made whole even at that
same hour.

Then Jesus went away from thence and came nigh unto the sea of Galile / and
went up in to a mountain and sat down there. And much people came unto him /
havinge with the^ / halt / blind / domme / maimed / and other many: and cast
them down at Jesus fete. And he healed them / in so much that the people
wondered / to se the do^me speak / the maimed whole the halt to go / and ye
blind to se. And they glorified the God of Israel.

Then Jesus called his disciples to him / and said: I have compassion on ye
people / because Marc. viij. a. Seven loves.
they have co^tynued with me now. iii. days / and have naught to eat: and I
will not let them depart fasting / lest they perisshe in ye way. And his
disciples said unto him: whence should we get so much breed in ye wilderness /
as should suffice so great a mustitude? And Jesus said unto them: how many
loves have ye? And they said: seven / and a feawe little fysshes. And he
commanded ye people to sit down on ye ground: and took the seven loves / and
the fysshes / and gave thanks / and brake them / and gave to his disciples /
and the disciples gave them to the people. And they did all eat and were
suffised. And they took up of the broken meat that was left.vii. baskete

he sent away the people / and took ship and came into the parties of Magdala.

Mar. viij b. Luke xii. ^.
THen came the pharisees and saduces / and did tempte him / desyringe him to
show them some sign from heve^. He answered and said unto the^. At even ye
say / we shall have fair wedder / and yt because ye sky is reed: and in the
morninge ye say / to day shall be foul wedder / and that because the sky is
cloudy and reed. O ye ypocrites / ye can discern ye fassion of the sky: and
can ye not discern ye signs of the times? The froward nation and advoutrous
seeks a sign / Sign of Jonas. Iona. ij. a Mark viij. b.
and there shall non other sign be geven unto them / but the sign of the
prophet Jonas. So left he them and departed.

And when his disciples were come to the Lu. xij. a Leven.
Then Jesus said unto them: Take heed and beware of the leve^ of ye Pharisees and
of ye Saduces. And they thought in them selves saying: because we have brought
no breed with us. When Jesus understood that / he said unto the^. O ye of
little faith / why are your minds cumbred because ye have brought no breed?
Do ye not yet perceave / nether remember those.v. loves when there were.v. M.
men / and how many baskettes took ye up? Nether the.vii. lones / when there
were.iiiii. M. and how many baskettes took ye up? Why pereeave ye not then / yt

Mark viij. c. Lu. ix. c.
When Jesus came in to the cost of the cite which is called Cesarea Philippi /
he axed his disciples saying: whom do men say yt I the son of man am? They

one of ye prophets. He said unto the^: but who^ say ye yt I am? Simo^ Peter
answered and said: Thou art Christ ye son of the lyvinge God. keys. Blind

And Jesus answered and said to him: happy art thou Simon the son of Jonas /
for flesh and blood has not opened unto the yt / but my father which is in

will bylde my congregation. And the gates of hell shall not prevayle against
it. And I will geve unto the / the keys of the kingdom of heven: and what
soever thou byndest upon earth / shall be bound in heven: and what soever thou
lowsest on earth / shall be lowsed in heven.

Then he charged his disciples / yt they should tell no man / yt he was Jesus
Christ. From When ought is said or done, that should move to pride: he dassheth

unto the. Then turned he about / and said unto Peter: come after me Satan
Peter is Satan.
/ thou offendest me / because thou sauourest not godly things / but wordly
things

Jesus then said to his disciples. If any man will follow me / leet him
forsake him sylfe Christ's disciples
/ and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life /
shall loose it. And whosoever shall loose his life for my sake Marc. viij. d.

ANd after.vi. days Jesus took Peter and James and Ihon his brother / and
brought them up into an hye mountain out of the way / and was transfygured
before them: and his face did shine as the sun / and his clothes were as
white as the light. And behold there appeared unto the^ / Moses and Helyas /
talkinge with him. Then answered Peter / and said to Jesus: master here is

bright cloud shadowed them. And behold there came a voice out of ye cloud
saying: ij. Pet. j. d Hear him.
this is my dear son / in whom I delight / hear him. And when the disciples
heard that / they fell on their faces / and were soore afraid. And Jesus came
and touched them / and said: arise and be not afraid. And when they looked up
/ they saw no man / save Jesus only.

Helyas must first come: malach. iiij. b. Johan baptist is Helyas.
Jesus answered / and said unto them: Helyas shall first come / and restore all
things. And I say unto you yt Helyas is come already / and they knew him not:
but have done unto him what soever they lusted. In like wise shall also the
son of man suffer of the^. Then ye disciples perceuved that he spoke unto

Because of your unbelief For I say verily unto you: if ye had faith as a

yonder place / and he should remove: nether should any thing be impossible for
you to do. Prayer and fasting.

he was come into the house / Jesus spoke first to him / saying What think
thou Simon? Tribute.
of whom do ye kings of the earth take tribute or poll money? of their children

him again: Then are the children fre. Nevertheless / lest we should offend

THe same time the disciples came unto Jesus saying: who is ye greatest in the

lu. xvij. a Seven times.
Then came Peter to him / and said: master how often shall I forgeve my brother
/ if he sin against me / seven times? Jesus said unto him: I say not unto
the seven times: but seventy times seven times. Therefore is ye kingdom of
heven lykened unto a certain king / which would take acountis of his
servauntis. And when he had begone to reckon / one was brought unto him /
which ought him ten thousand talentis: whom because he had naught to pay
his master commanded him to be sold / and his wife / and his children / and
all that he had / and payment to be made. The servaunt fell down and besought
him saying: Sir / geve me respyte / and I will pay it every whit. Then had
the Lord pytie on that servaunt / and lowsed him / and forgave him the det.

And ye said servau^t went out and found one Covenant to ye vnmersifull.

and took him by the throote / saying: pay me yt thou owe. And his fellow
fell down and besought him saying: have patience with me / and I will pay
the all. And he would not / but went and cast him into preson / till he should
pay the det. When his other fellows saw what was done / they were very sorry /
and came and told unto their lord all yt had happened. Then his lord called
him / and said unto him. O evyll servau^t I forgave the all that det / because
thou prayedst me: was it not mete also yt thou should have had compassion on
thy fellow / even as I had pity on ye? And his lord was wrooth / and delivered
him to the iaylers / till he should pay all that was due to him. So likewise
shall my hevenly father do unto you / except ye forgeve with your heart /

Wherefore now are they not twain / but one flesh. Let not man therefore put a
sunder / that which God has cuppled to gedder.

The^ said they to him: why did Moses command to geve a testimonial of
divorseme^t and to put her away? He said unto them: Moses because of the
hardness of your hertes suffered you to put away your wyfes: But from ye
beginnynge it was not so. I say therefore Mar. ix. ^ Lu. xvj. d j. co. vij. d
unto you / whosoever puts away his wife (except it be for fornicacion) and
maryeth another / breaks wedlock. And whosoever maryeth her which is
divorsed / does commyt advoutry.

Then said his disciples to him: if the matter be so between man and wife /
then is it Chaste.
There are chaste / which were so borne out of their mothers belly. And there are
chaste / which be made of men. And there be chaste / which have made them selves
chaste for the kingdom of heve^s sake. He that can take it / let him take it.

Mar. x. ^ Luke xviij. c. Children.
Then were brought to him young children / that he should put his hand on them
and pray And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said: suffer the children
and forbid them not to come to me: Mar. x. b Luke xviij. d.
for of such is the kingdom of heven. And when he had put his hondes on them
he departed thence.

And behold one came and said unto him: good master / what good thing shall
I do / that I Commandments.
But if thou wylt enter in to life / keep the commandments. The other said
to him / Which? And Jesus said: break no wedloke / kill not / steal not:
bear not falce witness: honor father and mother: and love thine neighbor as
thy sylfe. And the young man said unto him: I have observed all these thingis
from my youth / what lack I yet? And Jesus said unto him if thou wylt be
perfect / goo and sell that thou have / and geve it to the poor / and thou
shall have treasure in heven / and come and follow me. When ye young man
heard yt saying / he went away mourninge. For he had great possessions.

Then Jesus said unto his disciples: Verily I say unto you: yt is hard for a
rich man to enter into ye kingdom of heaven. Camel
And moreover I say unto you: it is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a nedle / then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his
disciples heard that / they were excedingly amassed / saying: who then can
be-saved? Jesus beheld the^ / and said unto them: with men this is impossible
/ but with God all things are possible.

Then answered Peter / and said to him: Covenant.
me in ye second generation shall sit also upon.xii. seats / and judge
ye.xii. tribes of Israel. And whosoever forsakes housses / or brethren / or
systers / other father / or mother / or wife / or children / or lands / for my

Mar. x. d Lu. xiij. f Mar. x. e. Luke. xviij. e. Passion.
And Jesus ascended to Jerusalem / and took the.xii. disciples a part in the

Mar. x. e. Mother of zebedes children.
Then came to him the mother of zebedes children with her sons / worshippynge
him / and desyringe a certain thing of him. And he said unto her: what will thou have? She said unto him: Gravnte that these my two sons may sit / ye
one on thy right hond / and the other on ye lift hond in thy kingdom.

Jesus answered and said: Ye wot not what ye axe. Are ye able to drink of the
cup yt I shall drink of / and to be baptized with the baptyme that I shall be
baptized with? They answered to him / that we are. And he said unto the^: Ye
shall drink of my cvp / and shall be baptized with the baptyme that I shall be

Hiericho Mar. x. ^ Luke.xviij. c. Two blind
And as they departed from Hierico / much people followed him. And behold two
blind men sittinge by ye way side / when they heard Jesus pass by / cried
saying: Thou Lord ye son of David have mercy on us. And ye people rebuked
them / be cause they should hold their peace. But they cried ye moare /
saying: have mercy on us thou Lord which art ye son of David. Then Jesus
stood still / and called the^ / and said: what will ye that I should do to
you: They said to him: Lord that our eyes may be opened. Jesus had
compassion on the^ / and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received
sight. And they followed him.

The.xxi. Chapter.
Bethphage. Mar. xj. a Luke xix*
When they drew neye unto Jerusalem / and were come to Betphage / unto mount
olivete: then sent Jesus two of his disciples / saiynge to the^. Go in to the
town that lies over against you / An ass and a colte.
and ano^ne ye shall find an ass bound / and her colte with her: lose them
and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you / say ye yt the
lord has neade of them: and straight way he will let them go. All this was
done / to fulfill that which was spoken by the Prophet / Esa. lxij. ^. zach. ix
b. John xij. b
saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: behold thy king comes unto the meke
/ and sittinge upon an ass and a colte / the fool of an ass used to the
yooke. The disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them / and brought ye
ass and the colte / and put on them their clothes / and set him thereon. And
many of the people spreed their garmente in ye way. Other cut down branches
from the trees / and strawed them in the way. Moreover the people that went
before / and they also that came after / cried saying: Hosanna Psalm.ixvij. d
Hosanna to ye son of David. Blessed be he that comes in the name of the
Lord / Hosanna in the highest.

Mar. xj. b Lu. xix. g
And when he was come in to Jerusalem / all the cite was moved saying: who is
this? Buyers and sellers.
And Jesus went in to the temple of God / and cast out all them that soulde and
bought in the temple / and overthrew the tables of the money chau^gers / and the
seats of them that sold doves / and said to them: Esa. lvj. c Hie. vij. b
It is written / my housse shall be called the housse of prayer. But ye have made
it a den of theves. And the blind and the halt came to him in ye temple /
and he healed the^.

When the chief priest and scribes saw the marveylles that he did / and the
children cryinge in the temple and saying / Hosanna to the son of David /
they disdayned / and said unto him: hear thou what these say? Jesus said
unto them ye: have ye never read Psalm.viij. b. Mar. xj. b
/ of the mouth of babes and suckelinges thou haste ordained praise? And he
left the^ / and went out of ye cite unto Bethanie / and had his abydi^ge
there.

Fygge tree. Mar. xj. c
In the morning as he returned in to the cite again / he hungered / and spyed a
fygge trre in the way / and came to it / and found nothing there on / but
leves only / and said to it / never fruit grow on the hence forward. And ano^
the fygge tree wyddered away. And when his disciples saw that / they marveled
saying: How sone is the fygge tree wyddered away? Jesus answered / and said
unto the^: Verily I say unto you / if ye shall have faith

Mar. xj. d Lu. xx. a
And when he was come in to the temple / the chief prestes and the elders of the
people came unto him as he was teachinge / and said: by what auctorite do
thou these things? and who gave the this power? Jesus answered / and said
unto them: I also will axe of you a certain question / which if ye assoyle me
/ I in like wise will tell you by what auctorite I do these things. Baptime of
John whence.
The baptime of John: whence was it? from heve^ or of men? Then they reasoned
among them selves saying: if we shall say from heven / he will say unto us:
why did ye not then beleve him? But and if we shall say of men / then fear we
the people. For all men held John as a Prophet. And they answered Jesus and
said: we cannot tell. And he like wise said unto them: nether tell I you by
what auctorite I do these things.

What say ye to this? Two sons.
A certain man had two sons / and came to ye elder and said: son go and
work to day in my vineyarde. He answered and said / I will not: but
afterward repented and went. Then came he to the second / and said like wise.
And he answered and said: I will sir: yet went not. Whether of the^ twain did
the will of the father? And they said unto him: the first. Jesus said unto
the^: verily I say unto you / Publicans. Harlotes
that the publicans and the harlotes shall come into ye kingdom of God before
you. For John came unto you in the way of rightewesnes / and ye beleved him
not. But the publicans and the harlotes beleved him. And yet ye (though ye saw
it) were not yet moved with repentance / that ye might afterward have beleved
him.

Mat. xij. a. Lu. xx b. Esa. v. a. hie. ij. d Vyneyarde that is let out hyer.
Harken another similitude. There was a certain householder / which planted a
vineyarde / and hedged it round about / and made a wynpresse in it / and bilt
a tower / and let it out to husbandmen / and went in to a strange country. And
when the time of the fruit drew near / he sent his servauntes to the
husbandme^ / to receave the fruits of it. And ye husbandme^ caught his
servauntes and bet one / killed another / and stoned another. Again he sent
other servantes / moo then the first: and they served them like wise. But last
of all / he sent unto the^ his own son saying: they will fear my son.
But when the husbandmen saw the son / they said among the^ selves: This is
the heir: come / let us kill him / and let us take his inheritance to our
selves. And they caught him and thrust him out of the vineyarde / and slew
him. When the lord of the vyneyarde comes / what will he do with those
husbandme^? They said unto him: he will cruellye destroy those evyll persons
/ and will let out his vyneyarde unto other husbandmen / which shall delyver
him the fruit at times convenient.

Psalm. ^xvij. d Act. iiij. b j. Pe. ij. a To. ix. a.
Jesus said unto the^: did ye never read in the scripture? The stone which ye
bylders refused / ye same is set in ye principal part of ye corner: this was
the lords doing / and yt is mervelous in our eyes. Therefore say I unto you
/ the kingdom of God shall be taken from you / and shall be geve^ to the ge^tyls /
which shall bring forth the fruits of it. Esaie. lxxvijj. d
And whosoever shall fall on this stone / he shall be broken / but on whosoever it
shall fall upon / it will grynde him to powder. And when the chief prestes and
Pharisees heard these similitudes / they perceaved yt he spoke of the^. And
they went about to lay hondes on him / but they feared ye people / because
they took him as a Prophet.

The.xxii. Chapter.
Luke ^xiiij. d. Apocaly. xix. b.
ANd Jesus answered and spoke unto them again / in similitudes saying. The
kingdom of heve^ is like unto a certain king / Marriage
which married his son / and sent forth his servantes / to call them that were
bid to the weddinge / and they would not come. Again he sent forth other
servauntes / saying: Cell them which are bydden: behold I have prepared my
dynner / mine oxen and my fatlinges are killed / and all things are ready /
come unto the marriage. But they made light of it / and went their ways: one to
his ferme place / another about his marchaundise / the remnaunt took his
servants and entreated them ungodly and slew them. When the king heard that
/ he was wroth / and send forth his warryers and distroyed those murderers /
and brent up their cite.

Wedynge garment.
Then the king came in / to viset the gestes / and spyed there a man which had
not on a weddinge garment / and said unto him: friend / how fortuned it that
thou came in hither and have not on a weddyng garment? And he was eve^
spechlesse. Then said the king to his ministers: take and bind him hand and
foot / and cast him into utter darcknes / there shall be wepinge and gnasshinge
of teth. Many are called
For many are called and feawe be chosen.

Mark xij. ^. and Lu. xx. ^
Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might ta^gle him in his
words. And they sent unto him their disciples with Herodes servauntes saying:
Master / we know yt thou are true / and teach the way of god truly /
nether carest for any man / for thou consydrest not me^nes estate. Tribute to
Caesar
Tell us therefore: how thynkest thou? Is it lawful to geve tribute unto Caesar
or not? Jesus perceaved their wikednes / and said: Why tempte ye me ye
ypocrites? Let me se ye tribute money. And they took him A penie is ever taken
for that the Jews call a sicle, and is worth x. pence sterling.
a penny. And he said unto them: whose is this image and superscripcion? They
said unto him: Cesars. Then said he unto them. Geve therefore to Caesar / that
which is Cesars: and geve unto god / that which is gods. When they heard
that / they marveled / and left him and went there way.

Mar. xij. Lu. xx. d Actuum xxiiij. Du. xxv Saduces
The same day the Saduces came to him (which say that there is no
resurreccion) and axed him saying: Master / Moses bade / if a man dye havinge
no children / that the brother mary his wife / and reyse up seed unto his
brother. There were with us seven brethren / and the first married and deceased with
out issue / and left his wife unto his brother. Like wise the second and ye
thryd / unto the seve^the. Last of all the woman dyed also. Now in the
resurreccion / whose wife shall she be of the seven? For all had her. Jesus
answered and said unto the^: ye are deceaved / and understand not the
scriptures / nor yet the power of God. For in the resurreccion they nether mary
nor are married: but are as the angels of God in heven.

Resurreccion.
As touching the resurreccion of the deed: have ye not read what is said unto
you of God / which says: Ex. iij. b
I am Abraham's God / and Ysaacks God / and the God of Jacob? God is not the God
of the deed: but of the lyvinge. And when the people heard that / they were
astonyed at his doctrine.

Mark xij.c. Luke.xij. e
When the Pharisees had heard / how yt he had put the Saduces to silence. / they
drew to gedder / and one of them which was a doctoure of law / axed a
question te^ptinge him and saying: Master which is ye chief co^maundment in
the law? Jesus said unto him: Du. vi. a Chief commandment.
love the Lord thy God with all thine heart / with all thy soul / and with all
thy mind. This is the first and the chief commandment. And there is another
like unto this. Love thine neghbour as thy self. In these two commandments
hang all the law and the Prophets.

Mark xij. d. Luke.xx. d.
Whyll the Pharisees were gaddered togeder / Jesus axed the^ saying: what think
ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They said unto him: the son of David.
David's son. Psalm. cx. a.
He said unto the^: How then does David in spirit / call him Lord saying?
The Lord said to my Lord / sit on my right hand: till I make thine enemies
thy footstool. If David call him Lord: how is he then his son? And none
could answer him again one word: nether durst any from that day forth /
axe him any moo questions.

And whosoever swears by the altar it is nothing: but whosoever swears by
ye offeringe yt lies on ye aultre / offends. Ye foles and blind: whether is
greater ye offeringe / or ye aultre which sanctifies ye offeringe? Whosoever
therefore swears by y^ aultre / swears by it / and by all yt there on is.
And whosoever swears by the temple / swears by it / and by him yt dwells

excess. Thou blind Pharise / cleanse first / the out side of the cup and

tombs which appear beautyfull outward: but are with in full of deed bones and

Ye build the to^bes.
Woe be unto you Scribes and Pharisees ypocrites: ye bylde the tombs of the
Prophets / and garnisshe the sepulchers of the righteous / and say: if we had
been in the days of our fathers / we would not have been parteners with them
in the blood of the Prophets. So then ye be witnesses unto your selfs / that

Luke.xix. g.
And as he sat upon the mount Olivete / his disciples came unto him secretly
saying. Tell us when these things shall be? and what sign shall be of thy
coming / and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered / and said unto

take heed that no man deceave you. For many shall come in my name saying: I
am Christ / and shall deceave many.

Ye shall hear of wars / and of the fame of wars: but se yt ye be not
troubled. For all these things must come to pass / but the end is not yet.
For nacio^ shall rise ageynste nacio^ / and realm ageynste realm: and there

beginning of sorrows.

And many falce Prophets shall arise / and shall deceave many. And because
iniquite shall have the upper hand / the love of many shall abate. But he that
endures to the end / the same shall be safe. And this glad tidingees of the
kingdom shall be preached in all the world / for a witness unto all nations: and
then shall the end come.

son of man in heven. And then shall all the kynreddes of the earth morn / and
they shall se the son of man come in the clouds of heven with power and
great glory. And he shall send his angeles with the great voice of a tro^pe

The passion. Mar. xiiij a. Luke xxij. a.
ANd it came to pass / when Jesus had fynisshed all these sayings / he said
unto his disciples: Ye know that after ii. days shall be ester / and the son
of man shall be delyvered to be crucified.

Then assembled togedder the chief prestes and the scribes and the elders of
the people to the palice of the hye priest / called Cayphas / Cayphas
and heelde a counsel / how they mygt take Jesus by suttelte and kill him. But
they said / not on the holy day / lest any vproure arise among the people.

Io. xij. a. Marc. xiiij. a. He is anointed.
When Jesus was in Bethany / in the house of Simon the leper / there came unto
him a woman / which had an alablaster box of precious ointment / and powered it
on his heed / as he sat at the bourde. When his disciples saw that / they had
indignacion saying: what neded this wast? This oyntme^t might have been well
sold / and geven to the poor. When Jesus understood that / he said unto the^:
why trouble ye the woman? She has wrought a good work upon me. For ye shall
have poor folcke always with you: but me shall ye not have all ways. And in
yt she casted this ointment on my body / she did it to burye me with all. Verily
I say unto you / wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughoute all the
world / there shall also this that she has done / be told for a memorial of
her.

He is sold. Marci. xiiij. b. Lu. xxii. a.
Then one of the twelve called Judas Iscarioth / went unto the chief prestes /
and said: what will ye geve me / and I will deliver him unto you? And they
appointed unto him thirty pieces of sylver. And from that time he sought
oportunite to betraye him.

Marci. xiiij. b. Lu. xxii. a.
The first day of sweet breed ye disciples came to Jesus saying unto him: where
wylt thou that we prepare for ye to eat ye paschall lamb? And he said: Go
into the cite / unto soche a man / and say to him: the master says / my time
is at hand / I will keep mine ester at thy housse with my desciples. And the
disciples did as Jesus had appointed them / and made ready the ester lamb.

Mar. xiiij lu. xxij. b Io. xiij. b
When the even was come / he sat down with the.xii. And as they did eat / he
said: Verily I say unto you / that one of you shall betraye me. And they were
exceeding sorrowful / and began every one of the^ to say unto him: is it I
master? He answered and said: he yt deppeth his hand with me in ye disshe / the
same shall betraye me. The son of man goes as it is written of him: Psa. x^.

but woe be to yt man / by whom ye son of man shall be betrayed. It had been

Then Judas which betrayed him / answered and said: is it I master? He said
unto him: thou have said. As they did eat / Jesus took breed and gave thanks
/ brake it / and gave it to the disciples / and said: Take / eat / this is my
body. And he took the cup / and thanked / and gave it them / saying: drink of
it every one. For this is my blood of the new testament / that shall be shed
for many / for the remission of sins. I say unto you: I will not drink

And when they had said grace / they went out into mount olyvete. Then said
Jesus unto them: all ye shallbe offended by me this night. For it is written. I
will smite ye shepeherde / and the sheep of ye flock shall be scattered abroode.
But after I am risen again / I will goo before you into Galile. Peter answered
/ and said unto him: though all men should be offended by ye / yet would I
never be offended. Jesus said unto him. Mar. xiiij c. lu. xxij b. Joan. xiij.

Verily I say unto ye / that this same night before the cock crow thou shall

not deny ye. Like wise also said all ye disciples.

Mar. xiii^ d. Luke xxij. d.
Then went Jesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane / and said
unto the disciples / sit ye here / whyll I go and pray yonder. And he took
with him Peter and the two sons of zebede / and began to wexe sorrowful and
to be in an agonye. Then said Jesus unto them: my soul is hevy even unto the
deeth. Tarry ye here and watch with me. And he went a little aparte / and fell
flat on his face / and prayed saying: O my father / if it be possible / let
this cup pass from me: nevertheless / not as I will / but as thou wylt. And
he He armeth him self against the passion.
came unto the disciples / and found them aslepe / and said to Peter: what /
could ye not watch with me one hour: watch and pray / that ye fall not
into temptacion. The spirit is willing / but the flesh is weak.

He went away once moare / and prayed / saying: O my father / if this cup
can not pass away from me / but yt I drink of it / thy will be fulfilled. And
he came / and found the^ aslepe again. For their eyes were hevy. And he left
them and went again and prayed ye third time saying ye same words. Then came
he to his disciples and said unto them: Sleep hence forth and take your reest.
Take heed the hour is at hand / and ye son of man shall be betrayed into ye

Whyll he yet spoke: lo / Judas one of ye xii. came and with him a great
multitude with sweardes and staves / sent from the chief prestes and elders He is

And Jesus said unto him: friend / wherefore art thou come? Then came they and
laid hondes on Jesus and took him.

And behold / one of them which were with Jesus / stretched out his hand and
drue his swearde / and stroke a servaunt of the hye priest / and smote of his
ear. Then said Jesus unto him: put up thy swearde into his sheathe. Genesis ix.

Then all the disciples forsook him and fleed. And they took Jesus and leed him
to Cayphas the hye preeste / where the Scribes and the Elders where assembled.
And Peter followed him a far of / unto the hye prestes place: and went in /
and sat with the servauntes / to se the end.

He is falselye accused.
The chief prestes and the elders / and all the counsel / sought false witness
agenste Jesus / for to put him to deeth / but found none: in somoche that when
many false witnesses came / yet found they none. At the last came two false
witnesses and said: Io. ij. d.
This fellow said: I can distroye the temple of God / and bylde it again
in.iii. days.

And the chief priest arose / and said to him: answerest thou nothing? How is
it yt these bear witness against the? But Jesus held his peace: And the chief
Preeste answered / and said to him: I charge the in the name of the lyvinge God
/ that thou tell us whether thou be Christ the son of God. Jesus said to him:
thou haste said. Nevertheless I say unto you / hereafter shall ye se the
son of man syttinge on the right hand of power / and come in the clowddes of

Mar. xiiij Lu. xxij f Io. xviij c Peter denies.
Peter sat with out in the palice. And a damsel came to him saying: Thou also

what thou say. When he was goone out into the poorche / another wenche saw
him / and said unto them that were there: This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth. And again he denied with an oothe that he knew the man. And after a
while came unto him they yt stood bye / and said unto Peter: suerly thou art
even one of the^ / for thy speech bewreyeth ye. Then began he to course and
to swear / that he knew not the man. And immedyatly the cock krewe. And
Peter remembered the words of Jesus which said unto him: before the cock crow
/ thou shall deny me thryse: and went out at the doors and wept bitterly.

The.xxvii. Chapter.
Mar. xv. a. Luke xxiiij. a. He is delyvered to Pilate
When the morning was come / all ye chief prestes and the elders of ye people
held a counsel agenst Jesus / to put him to deeth / and brought him bound
and delivered him unto Poncius Pilate the debite.

Judas
Then when Judas which betrayed him / saw that he was condemned / he repented
him sylfe / and brought again the.xxx. plattes of sylver to ye chief prestes
and elders saying: I have sinned betrayinge the innocent blood. And they
said: what is that to us? Se thou to that. And he cast down the sylver
plattes in the temple and departed / and went and hounge him sylfe.

Actu. j.
And the chief prestes took the sylver plattes and said: it is not lawful for
to put them in to the treasury / because it is the price of blond. And they
took counsel / and bought with them a potters field to bury strangers in.
Wherefore that field is called the field of blood / until this day. Then was
fulfilled / that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet zach. xj. ^
saying: and they took.xxx. sylver plattes / the prise of him that was valued
/ whom they bought of the children of Israel / and they gave them for the
potters field / as the Lord appointed me.

Mar. xv. a. Luke xxiij. a.
Jesus stood before the debite: and the debite axed him saying: Art thou the
king of ye Iues? Jesus said unto him: Thou say / and when he was accused of
ye chief prestes and elders he answered nothing. He holds his peace.
Then said Pilate unto him: hear thou not how many things they lay
ageynste ye? And he answered him to never a word: in somoche that the debite
marveylled greatly.

Barrabas
At that feast / the debite was wont to deliver unto ye people a presoner /
whom they would desyer. He had then a notable presoner / called Barrabas. And
when they were gadered together / Pilate said unto the^: whether will ye that
I geve loss unto you / Barrabas or Jesus which is called Christ? For he knew
well / that for envy they had delivred him.

When he was set down to geve judgment / his wife sent to him saying: have
thou nothing to do with that just man. For I have suffered many things this
day in a dream about him.

Mar. xv. b. Luke xxiij. b. Io. xviij. g and. xix. c
But the chief priests and the elders had parswaded the people / that they
should axe Barrabas / and should destroy Jesus. Then the debite answered and
said unto them: whether of the twain will ye that I let loosse unto you? And
they said / Barrabae. Pilate said unto them: what shall I do then with Jesus
which is called Christ? They all said to him: let him be crucified. Then said
the debite: what evyll has he done? And they cried the more saying: let him
be crucified.

When Pilate saw that he prevayled nothing / but that moare business was made
/ he took water and washed his hondes before ye people saying: I am innocent
of the blood of this His judge confesses him an innocent. He is scourged
just person / and that ye shall se. Then answered all the people and said:
his blood be on us / and on our children. Then let he Barrabas loose unto them
/ and scourged Jesus and delivered him to be crucified.

Mar. xv. b. Io. xix a. he is crowned.
Then the soudeours of the debite took Jesus unto the comen hall / and gaddered
unto him all the company. And they stripped him and put on him a purpyll roobe
/ and platted a croune of thorns and put upon his heed / and a read in his
right hand: and bowed their knees before him / and mocked him / saying: hayle
king of the Jews: and spitted upon him / and took the read and smoote him on
the heed.

Mar. xv. b. Luke xxiij. d. He drinks veneger and gal' Ioh. xix.
And when they had mocked him / they took the robe of him again / and put his
own reyme^t on him / and leed him away to crucify him. And as they came out /
they fonnde a man of Cyren / named Simon: him they compelled to bear his
cross. And when they came unto ye place / called Golgotha (that is to say / a
place of deed men's sculles) they gave him veneger to drink mengled with gall.
And when he had tasted thereof / he would not drink.

He is crucified.
When they had crucified him / they parted his garments / and did cast lottes:
to fulfill that was spoken by the prophet. They divided my garme^te among
them: and upon my vesture did cast loottes. And they sat and watched him
there. And they set up over his heed the cause of his deeth written. This is
Jesus the king of the Jews. And there were two theves crucified with him / one
on ye right hand / and another on the lift.

He is rayled on.
They that passed by / revyled him waggynge there heeddes and saying: Thou that
destroyest the temple of God and byldest it in three days / save thy sylfe. If
thou be ye son of God / come down from the cross. Lykwyse also the hye
prestes mockinge him with the scribes and elders said: He saved other /
himsylfe he can not save. If he be ye king of Israel: let him now come down
from the cross / and we will beleve him. He trusted in God / let him deliver
him now / if he will have him: for he said / I am the son of God. That same
also the theves which were crucified with him / cast in his tethe.

Psalm.xxj. a
That is to say / my God / my God / why have thou forsaken me? Some of them
that stood there / when they herd that / said: This man calls for Helyas.
And straight way one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it full of
veneger / and put it on a read / and gave him to drink. Other said / let be:
let us se whyther Helyas will come and deliver him. He geveth up ye ghost.
Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up the ghost.

The veil renteth Deed bodies arise.
And behold the veil of the temple did rent in twain from ye top to the
bottom / and the earth did quake / and the stones did rent / and graves did
open: and the bodies of many saints which slept / arose and came out of ye
graves after his resurreccion / and came into the holy cite / and appeared unto
many.

When the Centurion and they that were with him watchinge Jesus / saw ye earth
quake and those things which hapened / they feared greatly saying. Of a
surete this was the son of God.

And many women were there / beholdinge him a far of / which followed Jesus
from Galile / ministringe unto him. Among which was Mary Magdalen / and Mary
the mother of James and Ioses / and ye mother of zebedes children.

Mar. xv. d. Luke xxiiij. g. Johan. xxix. g. He is buried.
When the even was come / there came a rich man of Aramathia named Joseph /
which same also was Jesus disciple. He went to Pilate and begged the body of
Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And Joseph took the
body / and wrapped it in a clean lynnyn clooth / and put it in his new tomb /
which he had hewn out / even in the roke / and rolled a great stone to the
door of ye sepulcre / and departed. And there was Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary sittynge over ageynste the sepulcre.

He is watched for rysinge again
The next day that follows good frydaye / the hye prestes and pharisees got
them selves to Pilate and said: Sir / we remember / yt this deceaver said
whyll he was yet alyve After three days I will arise again. Command therefore
that the sepulcre be made sure until ye third day / lest paraventure his
disciples come / and steal him away / and say unto the people / he is risen
from deeth / and the last error be worsse then the first. Pilate said unto
them. Take watch men: Go / and make it as sure as ye can. And they went and
made the sepulcre sure with watch men / and sealed the stone.

The.xxviii. Chapter.
Mar. xvj b. Io. xx. c.
THe Sabbath day at even which dauneth the morrow after the Sabbath / Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary came to se the sepulcre.

And behold there was a great earth quake. For the angel of ye lord descended
from heven: and came and rowlled back the stone from the door / and sat upon
it. His countenance was like lyghtnynge / and his rayme^t white as snow. And
for fear of him the kepers were astunnyed / and be came as deed men.

The angel answered / and said to the women / fear ye not. I know yt ye
seek Jesus which was crucified: he is not here: he is risen as he said. Come /
and se the place where the lord was put: and goo quickly and tell his
disciples yt he is risen from deeth. And behold / he will go before you into
Galile / there ye shall se him. Lo I have told you.

And they departed quickly from the sepulcre with fear and great Joy: and
did run to bring his disciples word. And as they went to tell his
disciples: behold / Jesus met them saying: All hayle. And they came and held
him by the fete and worshipped him. The^ said Jesus unto them: be not afraid.
Go and tell my brethren / that they goo in to Galile / and there shall they se

John baptized. Mat. iij. a
John did baptize in the wyldernes / and preche the baptyme of repentance / for
the remission of sins. And all the land of Jury and they of Jerusalem /
went out unto him / and were all baptized of him in the ryver Jordan /
confessing their sins.

Mat. iij. c Luke iij. c John. j. d.
John was clothed with cammylles here / and with a gerdyll of a skyn about his
loins. And he did eat locustes and wild honey / and preached saying: a
stronger then I comes after me / whose shue latchet I am not worthy to stoop
down and unloose. I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with
the holy ghost.

Jesus is baptized. Mat. iij. d Luke iij. d
And yt came to pass in those days / that Jesus came from Nazareth / a cite of
Galile: and was baptized of John in Jordan. And as soon as he was come out of
the water / John saw heaven open / and the holy ghost descendinge upon him /
like a dove. And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my dear son in whom
I delight.

Mat. iiij. a. Luke v Jesus fasteth.
And immediately the sprete drove him into wilderness: and he was there in the

And the angels ministered unto him.

After John was taken / Jesus came in to Galile / preachinge the gospel of the
kingdom of God / and saying: the time is come / and the kingdom of God is at
hand / repent and beleve the gospel.

Mar. iiij. c. Lu. v. a. Simon Andrew.
As he walked by the sea of Galile / he saw Simon and Andrew his brother /
castinge nets in to ye see / for they were fysshers. And Jesus said unto
them: follow me / and I will make you fisshers of men. And straight way / they
forsook their nets / and followed him.

James John.
And when he had gone a little further thence / he saw James the son of
zebede / and John his brother / even as they were in the ship mendinge their
nets. And ano^ne he called them. And they leeft their father zebede in the
ship with his hired servauntes / and went their way after him.

Mat. viij d. Luke iiij. c
And they entered in to Capernau^: and straight way on ye Saboth days / he
entered in to ye synagoge and taught. And they merveled at his learning. For he
taught them as one that had power with him / and not as the Scribes.

The unclean sprrite is cast out.
And there was in their synagoge a man vexed with an unclean spirit / yt cried
saying: let be: what have we to do with the thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou
come to destroy us? I know the what thou art / eue^ that holy of god. And
Jesus rebuked him saying: hoolde thy peace and come out of him. And ye unclean
spirit tare him / and cried with a loud voice / and came out of him. And they
were all amassed / in so much that they demanded one of another among them
selves saying: what thing is this? what new doctrine is this? For he
commands the foul spirits with power / and they obey him. And immediately
his fame spreed abroad throughoute all the region borderinge on Galile.

Mat. viij. ^. Luke iiij. f. Simons mother law.
And forth with / as soon as they were come out of the synagoge / they entered in
to ye housse of Simon and Andrew / with James and Ihon. And Symons mother in
law lay sick of a fever. And anon they told him of her. And he came and
took her by the hand and lift her up: and the fever sorsoke her by and by:
and she ministered unto them.



And in the morninge very erly / Jesus arose and went out in to a solitary
place / and there prayed. And Simon and they that were with him followed after
him. And when they had found him / they said unto him: all men seek for the.
And he said unto them: let us go in to the next tounes / that I may preach
there also: for truly I came out for that purpose. And he preached in their
synagoges / throughout all Galile / and cast the devyls out.

A leper. Mat. viij a. Lu. v. c
And there came a leper to him / besechinge him / and kneled down unto him /
and said to him: if thou will / thou ca^nest make me clean. And Jesus had
compassion on him / and put forth his hand / touched him / and said to him: I
will be thou clean. And as soon as he had spoken / immediately ye leprosy
departed from him / and was cleansed. And he charged him / and sent him away
forthwith and said unto him: Se thou say nothing to any man: but get the
hence and show thy silfe to ye priest / and offer for thy cleansing / those
things which Moses commanded / for a testimonial unto them. But he (as soon
as he was departed) began to tell many things / and to publyshe the deed: in
so much that Jesus could no more openly enter in to the cite / but was with
out in desert places. And they came to him from every quarter.

The.ii. Chapt.
Mat. ix. a Luke. v. d Palseye.
AFter a feawe days / he entered into Capernaum again / and it was noysed that
he was in a housse. And anon many gadered to geder / in so much that now
there was no room to receave them: no / not so much as about the door. And he
preached the word unto them. And there came unto him that brought one sick of
the palsy / borne of four men. And because they could not come nigh unto him
for preace / they uncovered ye rofe of the housse where he was. And when they
had broken it open / they let down ye beed where in ye sick of the palsy
lay. When Jesus saw their faith / he said to the sick of the palsy / son
thy sins are forgeven the.

The visible miracle was a sign of the invisible power
forgeve sins / he spoke unto ye sick of the palsy: I say unto ye / arise
and take up thy beed / and get ye hense in to thine own housse. And by and by
he arose / took up the beed / and went forth before them all: in so much that
they were all amassed / and glorified God saying: we never saw it on this
fassion.

Mat. ix. a Luke v. f. Levy.
And he went again unto the sea / and all the people resorted unto him / and he
taught the^. And as Jesus passed by / he saw Levy ye son of Alphey sit at
the receyte of custom / and said unto him: follow me. And he arose and
followed him. And it came to pass / as Jesus sat at meat in his housse / many
publicans and sinners sat at meat also with Jesus and his disciples. For
there were many that followed him. And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him
eat with publica^s and sinners publica^s and sinners eat with Christ.
/ they said unto his disciples: how is it / that he eats and drynketh with
publica^s and sinners? When Jesus heard yt / he said unto them. The whole
have no need of the phisicio^ / but the sick. I came not to call the rightwise
/ but the sinners to repentance.

j. Timo. j. c. Mat. ix. b. and Luke v. f. Christ's disciples fast not
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees did fast: and therefore came and
said unto him. Why do ye disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast / and thy
disciples fast not. And Jesus said unto them: can the children of a weddinge
fast / while the brydgrome is with them. As long as they have the brydgrome
with them / they cannot fast. But the days will come when the brydgrome
shall be taken from them and then shall they fast in those days.

New and old agree not.
Also no man sows a piece of new cloth unto an old garment / for then takes
he away ye new piece from the old / and so is the rent worsse.

In like wise / no man pours new wine in to old vessels: for if he do / the
new wine breaks the vessels / and the wine runs out / and the vessels are
marred. But new wine must be poured in to new vessels.

Mat. xij. a. Luke vj. a They pluck the ears on the Saboth day j. Regum xxi.
b The Saboth was made for man. Christ is Lord over the Saboth.
And it chaunsed that he went through / ye corn feldes on the Saboth day: and
his disciples as they went on their way / began to pluck the ears of
corn. And the Pharisees said unto him: behold / why do they on the Saboth
days yt which is not laufull? And he said to them: have ye never read what
David did / when he had need / and was anho^gred / both he and they that were
with him? How he went into the housse of God in the days of Abiathar ye hye
priest / and did eat ye hallowed loves / which is not laufull to eat / but for
ye prestes only: and gave also to the^ which were with him? And he said to
them: the Saboth day was made for man / and not man for the Saboth day.
Wherefore the son of man is Lord eve^ of the Saboth day.

Wethered hand.
ANd he entered again into ye synagoge / and there was a man there which had a
widdred hand. And they watched him to se / whether he would heal him on the
Saboth day / yt they might accuse him. And he said unto ye man which had ye
wyddred hand: arise and stand in ye mids. And he said to them: whether is
it laufull to do a good deed on ye Saboth days / or an evyll? to save life or
kill? But they held their peace. And he looked round about on them angerly /
mournyge on the blindness of their hertes / and said to the man: stretch forth
thine hand. And he stretched it out. And his hand was restored / even as
whole as the other.

And ye Pharisees departed / and straight way gaddred a counsel with the^ that

and they yt dwelled about Tire and Sidon / a great multitude: which when they
had herd what things he did / came unto him.

And they came unto housse / and the people assembled togedder again / so
greatly that they had not leesar so much as to eat breed. And when they that
longed unto him heard of it / they went out to hold him. For they thought he
had been beside him self. And ye Scribes which came from Jerusalem / said: he
has Beelzebub / and by ye power of the chief devyll / casts out devyls. And
he called them unto him / and said unto them in similitudes.

How can Satan drive out Satan: For if a realm be divided ageynste it silfe /
that realm cannot endure. Or if a housse be divided against it silfe / that
housse cannot continue: So if Satan make insurreccion against him silfe and be
divided / he cannot continue: but is at an end. No man can enter into a
strong man's housse / and take away his gooddes / except he first bind that
strong man / and then spoil his housse.

Verily I say unto you / all sins shall be forgeven unto men's children and

they said / he had an unclean sprete.

ANd he began again to teach by the sea side. And there gadered to gedder unto
him much people / so greatly yt he entered into a ship / and sat in the sea /
and all the people was by the sea side on the shoore. Sower.
And he taught them many things in similitudes / and said unto them in his
doctrine: Harken to. Behold / There went out a sower to sow. And it fortuned
as he sowed / that some fell by the way side / and the fowls of the air came
and devoured it up. Some fell on stony ground / where it had not much earth:
and by and by sprange up / because it had not deepth of earth: but as soon as the
sun was up it caught heet / and because it had not rotynge / wyddred away.

And some fell among the thorns / and the thorns grew up and choked it / so
that it gave no fruit. And some fell upon good ground and did yield fruit that
spro^ge and grew / and brought forth: some thirty fold / some sixty fold
and some an hundred fold. And he said unto them: he that has ears to hear
/ let him hear.

The sower is expownded
And when he was alone / they yt were about him with ye.xii. axed him of ye
similitude. And he said unto the^. To you it is geve^ to know the mystery of
the kingdom of God. But unto them that are with out / shall all things be done
in similitudes: Esa. vj. e Mat. xiij b. Lu. viij b. Io. xij. f. Actu. xxviij.

yt when they se / they shall se / and not discern: and when they hear they
shall hear / and not understand: lest at any time they should turn / and
their sins should be forgeve^ the^. And he said unto the^: Perceave ye not
this similitude? how then should ye understand all other similitudes?

The sower sows ye word. And they that are by the ways side / where the
word is sown / are they to whom as soon as they have herd it / Satan comes
immediately / and takith away the word that was sowe^ in their hertes. And
likewise they that are sown on the stonye ground / are they: which when they
have hard the word / at once receave it with gladness / yet have no rotes in
them selves / and so endure but a time: and anon as trouble and persecucion
aryseth for ye words sake / they fall immediately. And they that are sowe^
among the thorns / are soche as hear ye word: and ye cares of this world
and ye disseytfulnes of riches and the lusts of other things / enter in and
choocke ye word / and it is made unfruitfully. And those that wear sowe^ in
good ground / are they that hear the word and receave it / and bring forth
fruit / some thirty fold / some sixty fold / some an hundred fold.

Mat. v. b Lu. viij. c and.xj. e. Mat. v. c. Lu. viij. c Candell.
And he said unto them: is ye candle lighted / to be put under a busshell / or
under ye table / and not rather to be put on a ca^delstick? For there is
nothing so prevy / that shall not be opened: nether so secreet / but that it
shall come abroad. If any man have ears to hear / let him hear. Measure
And he said unto them: take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete /
with the same shall it be measured unto you again. And unto you that hear
shall more be geve^. A covenant to them that love the word of God to win
other with word and deed: and another to them that love it not, that it shall be
their destruction.
For unto him yt has / shall it be geven: and from him that has not / shall be
taken away / even that he has.

And he said: so is the kingdom of God / even as if a man should sow seed in
ye ground / and should sleep and rise up night and day: and the seed should
spring and grow up / he not ware. For ye earth brings forth fruit of her
silfe: first the blade / then the ears / after that full corn in the ears.
And as soon as the fruit is brought forth / ano^ne he throusteth in ye sykell /
because the hervest is come.

Mustard seed. Mathe. xiij. c. Luke.xiij. d
And he said: where unto shall we lyke^ the kingdom of God? or with what
co^pareson shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed / which
when it is sowe^ in the earth / is the leest of all seeds that be in the earth:
but after that it is sown / it grows up / and is greatest of all yerbes: and
bears great branches / so that ye fowls of the air may dwell under the
shadow of it.

And the same day when even was come / he said unto them: let us pass over

Jesus slepeth in ye ship.
And there arose a great storm of wind / and dasshed ye waves into the ship /
so that it was full. And he was in the stern aslepe on a pelowe. And they
awoke him / and said to him: Master / carest thou not yt we perisshe? And he
rose up / and rebuked the wind / and said unto the sea: peace and be still.
And the wind alayed / and there followed a great calm. And he said unto them:
why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? And they feared
excedingly / and said one to another: what fellow is this? For booth wind and

Gaderenites. And when he was come out of ye ship / there met him out of the
graves a man possessyd of an unclean sprete / which had his abydinge among
the graves. And no man could bind him: no not with cheynes / because that
when he was often bound with fetters and chains / he plucked ye chains asundre
/ and brake the fetters in peaces. Nether could any man tame him. And always
both night and day / he cried in ye mountains and in ye graves / and bet him
silfe with stones. When he had spied Jesus afar of / he ra^ne and worshipped
him / and cried with a loud voice and said: what have I to do with the Jesus ye
son of the most highest God? I require ye in the name of God yt thou torment
me not. For he had said unto him: come out of the man thou foul sprete. And he
axed him: what is thy name? And he answered saying: my name is Legion / for we
are many. Legion.
And he prayed him instantly / that he would not send the^ away out of the
country.

Swyne
And there was there nigh unto ye mou^tayns a great heerd of swyne fedinge / and
all the devyls besought him saying: send us into the heerde of swyne / yt we
may enter in to them. And anon Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spretes
went out and entered in to ye swyne. And the heerd starteled / and ran hedling
in to the sea. They were about.ii. M. swyne / and they were drouned in the sea.
And the swyne heerde fleed / and told it in ye cite / and in the country. And
they came out for to se what had hapened: and came to Jesus / and saw him that
was vexed with the fend and had the legio^ / sit / both clothed and in his right
mind / and were afraid. And they that saw it told them / how it had
happened unto him that was possessed with the devyll: and also of the swyne.
And they began to pray him / that he would depart from their coostes. And
when he was come in to the ship / he that had ye devyll / prayed him that he
might be with him. Howbeit Jesus would not suffer him / but said unto him: goo
home in to thine own housse and to thy friends / and show the^ what great
things ye Lord has done unto the / and how he had compassion on the. And he
departed / and began to publisshe in ye ten cities / what great things
Jesus had done unto him / and all me^ did merveyle.

Mat. ix. c Lu. viij. f The Rulers daughter.
And when Jesus was come over again by ship unto the other side / much people
gadered unto him / and he was nigh unto the sea. Andbeholde / there came one of
the rulers of ye Synagoge / whose name was Iairus: and when he saw him / he
fell down at his fete / and besought him greatly saying: my daughter lyith at

garment. For she thought: if I may but touch his clothes / I shall be whole.
And straight way her fou^tayne of blood was dried up / and she felt in her
body / that she was healed of the plage.

And Jesus immediately felt in him silfe / ye virtue that went out of him / and
turned him round about in the preace / and said: who touched my clothes?
And his disciples said unto him: seist thou ye people thrust the / and yet
axest / who did touch me? And he looked round about / for to se her that had
done that thing. The woman feared and trembled (for she knew what was done
within her) and she came and fell down before him / and told him ye truth of

goo in peace / and be whole of thy plage.

the mother of ye maiden / and them that were with him / and entered in where the
maiden lay / and took the maiden by the hand / and said unto her: Tabitha /

observinge the tradicions of the elders. And when they come from the market /
escept they wash / they eat not. And many other things there be / which they

of Brazen vessels / and of tables.

Then axed him the pharisees and scribe / why walk not thy disciples according

This people honoreth me with their lyppes / but their heart is far from me:
In vain they worship me / teachinge doctryns which are nothing but ye

are those which defyle ye man. If any man have ears to hear / let him hear
And when he came to house away from the people / his disciples axed him of the

yet perceave / yt what soever thing from with out enters into a man / it can
not defyle him / because it entrith not in to his heart / but into ye belly: and
goes out into the draught that porgeth out all meats.

That comes out of a man defiles.

even out of the heart of men / proceade evil thoughts: advoutry /

/ and a wicked eye / blasphemy / pride / folysshnes: all these evyll things

came and fell at his fete. The woman was a Greek out of Syrophenicia / and she
besought him yt he would cast out ye devyll out of her daughter. And Jesus
said unto her: let the children first be feed. For it is not mete / to take
the chyldre^s breed / and to cast it unto whelppes. She answered and said
unto him: even so master / nevertheless / the whelppes also eat under the
table of the chyldrens cromes. And he said unto her: for this saying goo thy

fyngers in his ears / and did spyt and touched his tongue / and looked up to
heven and sygthed / and said unto him: ephatha / that is to say / be openned.
And straight way his ears were openned / and the stringe of his tongue was
loosed / and he spoke plain. And he commanded them that they should tell no
man. But the more he forbad them / so much the more a great deal they
publesshed it: and were beyond measure astonyed / saying: Gene. j. d Eccle.

Whosoever therefore shall be asshamed of me and of my word / among this

And his raiment did shine / and was made very white / even as snow: so white
as no fuller can make upon the earth. And there apered unto them Helyas with
Moses: and they talked with Jesus. And Peter answered and said to Jesus: Master

And he came to his disciples / and saw much people about them / and the
scribes disputinge with them. And straight way all the people when they
beheld him / were amassed / and ran to him and saluted him. And he said unto
the Scribes: what dispute ye with them? And one of the company answered and
said: Master / I have brought my son unto the /

He answered him and said: O generation with out faith how long shall I be with

unto him. And as soon as ye sprete saw him / he tare him. And he fell down on
the ground walowinge and fomynge. And he axed his father: how long is it a

casts him into the fire / and also into the water / to destroy him. But if
thou canste do any thing / have mercy on us / and help us. And Jesus said
unto him: ye if thou could beleve / all things are possible to him yt

And streygth way the father of the child cried with tears saying: Lord I

roose. And when he was come into the housse / his disciples axed him secretly:

he took a child and set him in ye mids of them / and took him in his arms

John answered him saying: Master / we saw one casting out devyls in thy
name / which follows not us / and we forbade him / because he follows us not.
But Jesus said If he preach Christ truly, though he follow not with the in thy
ceremonies or tradicions let him alone
forbid him not. For there is no man that shall do a miracle in my name / that
can lightlyge speak evyll of me. Whosoever is not against Whatsoever is done

receave of the tenauntes of the fruit of the vyneyarde. And they caught him and

servaunt / and at him they cast stones and brake his heed / and sent him again
all to revyled. And again he sent another / and him they killed: and many
other / beetynge some / and kyllinge some.

Yet had he one son whom he loved tenderly / him also he sent at the last
unto them saying: they will fear my son. But the tenauntes said amongst
them selves: this is the heir: come let us kill him / and ye inheritance
shall be ours. And they took him and kyll'id him / and cast him out of the
vyneyarde. What shall then the lord of the vyneyarde do? He will come and
destroy ye tenaunte / and let out the vyneyarde to other. Have ye not read
this scripture? The stoone which ye bylders did refuse / is Psalm. cxvij. d.

people. For they perceaved that he spoke that similitude against them. And they
left him and went their way.

And they sent unto him certain of y^ Pharisees Mathe. xxiij. b. Lu. xx. d
with Herodes servante / to take him in his words. And allone as they were
come / they said unto him: master we know yt thou art true / and carest for

their simulacion / and said unto them: Why te^pte ye me? Bring me apeny /
that I may se yt. And they brought. And he said unto them: Whose is this
image and superscripcion? And they said unto him / Cesars. And Jesus answered
and said unto the^: Then geve to Caesar Roman. xiij. c
that which belongs to Caesar: and to God / that which perteyneth to God. And
they mervelled at him.

Then came the Saduces unto him / which Matthew xxij. c Lu. xx. d Deutero. xxv.
b Saduces
say / there is no resurreccion. And they axed him saying: Master / Moses
wroote unto us if any man's brother dye / and leve his wife behind him / and
leve no children: that then his brother should take his wife / and reyse up seed
unto his brother. There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife / and
when he dyed leeft no seed behind him. And the second took her / and dyed:
nether leeft any seed. And the third like wise. And seve^ had her / and leeft
no seed behind them. Last of all the wife dyed also. In the resurrection then
/ when they shall rise again: whose wife shall she be of them? For seven had
her to wife. Jesus answered and said unto them: Are ye not therefore deceaved
and understand not the scryptures / nether the power of God? For when they
shall rise again from deeth / they nether mary / nor are married: but are as
the angels which are in heven. As touching the deed / Resurreccion.
that they shall rise again: have ye not read in the book of Moses / how in

of Abraham / and God of Ysaac / and the God Matthew. xvij. b. Luke. x. c
of Jacob? He is not the God of the deed / but the God of the livynge. Ye are
therefore greatly deceaved.

And there came one of the scribes that had First commandment. Deutero. vj. a.
axed him: Which is the first of all the commandments? Jesus answered him:
the first of all the commandments is. Hear Israel: The Lord God / is one
Lord. And thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart / and with all
thy soul / and with all thy Leui. xix d. Math. xxij. d. Roman. xiij. c Gala.

mind / and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment. And the
second is like unto this: Thou shall love thy neghbour as thy silfe. There is
none other commandment greater then these.

And the Scribe said unto him: well master / thou have said y^ truth / that
there is one God / and that there is none but he. And to love him with all the
heart / and with all the mind / and with all the soul / and with all the
strength: and to love a man's neghbour as him silfe / is a greater thing then
all burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered
discretly / he said unto him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.
And no man after that / durst axe him any question. Mat. xxij d. lu. xx g
David's son. Psalm.cjx. a.


And Jesus answered and said / teaching in the temple: how say the Scribes
yt Christ is the son of David? For David him self inspyred with the holy
ghost / said: The Lord said to my Lord / sit on my right hand / till I
make thine enemies thy footstool. Then David him silfe calls him Lord: and
by what means is he then his son? And much people heard him gladly.

And he said unto them in his doctrine: beware of the Scribes which love to

chief seats in the synagoges / and to sit in the uppermost roumes at feasts /
and devour widows houses / and that under color of long prayinge. These
shall receave greater dampnacion.

And Jesus sat over against the treasury / and beheld how the people put money
into the treasury. And many that were rich / cast in much. And there came a
certain poor widow / and she threw in two mytes / which make a farthynge.
And he called unto him his disciples and said unto them: Verily I say unto
you / that this pover widow has cast moare in / then all they which have

good work on me. For ye shall have poor with you all ways: and when soever
ye will / ye may do them good: but me ye shall not have always. She has done
that she could: she came a fore hand to anoint my boddy to his buryinge
ward. Verily I say unto you: wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
thorowout the whole world: this also that she has done / shall be rehearsed in
remembrance of her.

And Judas Iscarioth / one of the twelve / Matthew.xxvj. Luke.xxii. ^ He is
betrayed.
went away unto the hye prestes / to betraye him unto them. When they herd
that / they were glad / and promised ye they would geve him money. And he
sought / how he might conveniently betraye him.

And the first day of sweet breed / when Matthew.xxvj. Luke xxij. a.
men offer ye pascall lamb / his disciples said unto him: where will thou that
we goo and prepare / that thou may eat the ester lamb? And he sent forth
two of his disciples / and said unto them: Goo ye into the cite / and there
shall a man mete you beringe a pitcher of water / follow him. And whither
soever he goes in / say ye to ye good man of ye housse: the master axeth
where is the geest chamber / where I shall eat ye ester lamb with my
disciples. And he will show you a great parlour / paved and prepared: there
make ready for us. And his disciples went forth and came to the cite / and
found as he had said unto them: and made Ester lamb.

And at even he came with the.xii. And as Matthew. xx vj. tu. xxvj. b. Io. xiij

they sat at board and ate / Jesus said: Derely I say unto you: that one of
you shall betraye me / which cateth with me. And they began to morn / and to
say to him one by one: is it I? And a another said: is it I? He answered and
said unto them: It is one of the.xii. and the same deppeth with me in the
platter. The son of man goes / as it is written of Psalm. xl. c
him: but woo be to that man / by whom the son of man is betrayed. Good were
it for him / if that man had never been borne.

And as they ate Jesus took breed / blessed f. Lo. xj c

sheed for many. Derely I say unto you: I will drink no moore of this fruit of
the vine / until that day / that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And
when they had said grace / they went out to mount Olyvete.

And Jesus said unto them: All ye shall be offended through me this night. For it
is Matthew.xxvj. zacha. xiij. c.
written: I will smite ye shepeherd / and the sheep shall be scattered. But after
that I am risen again / I will goo into Galile before you. Peter said unto
him: And though all men Luke. xxij. d. Joan. xviij. a. Io. xvj ^^

unto y^ / this day even in this night / before ye cock crow twyse / thou
shall deny me thryse. And he spoke boldlyer: no / if I should dye with the / I
will not deny the. Like wise also said they all.

And they came into a place named Gethsemani. Mat. xx vj. lu. xx ij. d.
And he said to his disciples: Sit ye here / whyll I goo aparte and pray. And
he took with him Peter / James and John / and he began to wax abashed and to
be in an agonye and said unto the^: My soul is very hevy even unto He armeth
him self against his passion.
the deeth / tarry here and watch. And he went forth a little and fell down on
ye ground and prayed: and prayed: that if it were possible / the hour might
pass from him. And he said: Abba father / all things are possible unto the /
take away this cup from me. Nevertheless not that I will / but that thou will
/ be done.

And he came and found the^ slepinge / and said to Peter: Simon / slepest thou?
Could not thou watch with me one hour? watch ye / and pray / leest ye
enter into temptacion: ye sprete is ready / but ye flessh is week. And again
he went away and prayde / and spoke ye same words. And he returned and found
them a sleep again / for their eyes were hevy: nether wist they what to
answer him. And he came the third time / and said unto the^: sleep hens forth
and take your ease / it is enough. The hour is come / behold ye son of man
shall be delyveted into ye hondes of sinners. Rise up / let us goo. Loo he that
betrayeth me / is at hand.

And immediately whyll he yet spoke / came Matthew xxvj Lu. xxij. e. Io. xviij.

toke^ saying: whosoever I do kiss / he it is: take him and lead him away
warely. And as soon as he was come / he went straight way to him / and said
unto him: master master / and kissed him. And they laid their hondes on him /
and took him. And one of them that stood by / drue out a swearde / and smote a
setvaunt of the hye priest / and cut of his ear. Three. iiij. d.


And Jesus answered and said unto the^: ye be come out as unto a thief with
sweardes and with staves / for to take me. I was daily with you in ye temple
teachinge and ye took me not: but yt the scriptures should be fulfilled. And
they all forsook him and ran away. And there followed him a certerne young man

upon y^ bare / and the yongemen caught him / and he left his lynnen and fleed

And they leed Jesus away to ye highest priest of all / and to him came all the
hye prestes / and the elders / and the scribes. And Peter followed him a great
way of / even into the pallys of the hye priest / and sat with the servauntes
/ and warmed him sylfe at the fire.

And the hye prestes and all ye counsel sought for witness against Jesus / to
put him to death / and Ioh. iij.

beure witness against the? And he held his peace / and answered noothinge.
Again the hyeste Priest axed him / and said unto him: Art thou Christ the
son of the blessed? And Jesus said: I am. And ye shall se the son of man

highest priest rent He is mocked spyt on / blynfolded and boffeded.

And some began to spit at him / and to cover his face / and to beat him with
fistes / and to say unto him / arede unto us. And the servauntes boffeted him
on the face.

And as Peter was beneeth in ye pallys / there came one of y^ we^ches of ye
highest priest: and when Matthew.xxvj. g. Lu. xxij. f Johan. xviij. c.
she saw Petre warming him sylfe / she looked on him / and said: wast not thou
also with Jesus of Nazareth? And he denied it saying: I know him not / nether
wot I what thou say. And he went out into ye poorche / and the cock crewe.
Peter denies.
And a damsel saw him / and again began to say to the^ that stood by /
this is one of the^. And he denied it again. And anon after / they that stood
by / said again to Peter: suerly thou art one of the^ / for thou art of
Galile / and Matthew xxij. luk xxij. f. g Johan.xviiij. e.

know not this man of whom ye speak. And again the cock krewe / and Peter
remembered the word that Jesus said unto him: before the cock crow twyse /

the hye prestes accused him of many things. Wherefore Pilate axed him again
saying: Answerest Matthew xxvii. lu. xxiija

answered never aworde / so that Pilate merveled. He holds his peace.


At that feast Pilate was wont to delivre at their pleasure a presoner:

him.

And when they had moocked him / they took the purple of him / and put his own
cloothes on him / and led him out / to crucify him. And they compelled one
that passed by / called Simon of Cyrene (which came out of the field / and was
father of Alexander and Rufus) to bear his cross. And they brought him to a
place named Golgotha (which is by Golgotha. Math. xxvij. Luke. xxiij. d. His
garments are devyded. Io. xix. d He is crucified. Gsa. liij d
interpretacion / the place of deed men's scoulles) and they gave him to drink
/ wine myngled with myrte / but he received it not.

And when they had crucified him / they parted his garments / castinge loottes
for them / what every man should have. And it was about y^ third houte / and
they crucified him. And the title of his cause was written: The king of the
Jews. And they crucified with him two theves: the one on the right hand / and
the other on his lift. And the scripture was fulfilled which says: he was
counted among the wicked.

And they that went by / rayled on him: waggynge He is ray fed on.

mocked him y^ hye priests among them selves with the scribes and said: He
saved other men / him sylfe he cannot save. Let Christ the king of Israel now
descend from the cross / that we may se and beleve. And they that were
crucified with him / checked him also.

And when the sixte hour was come / darkness with a loud voice saying: Eloi /
Eloi / lamaasbathani / which Psalm. xx^

of them that stood by / when they heard yt / said: behold he calls for

And one ran and filled a sponge full of veneger / and put it on a read / and
gave him to drink / saying: let him alone / let us se whether Helyas will

top to the boottome. And when the Centurion which The vay lerenteth
stood before him / saw that he so cried and gave up the gooste / he said:
truly this man was the son of God. There were also women a good way of
beholdinge him: among whom was Mary Magdalen / and Mary the mother of James
the little and of Ioses / and Mary Salome: which also when he was in Galile /
followed him and ministered unto him / and many other women which came up with
him to Jerusalem.

And now when night was come (because Matthew xxvij. Luke.xxiij. g. Io. xix. g

councelour which He is buried.
and axed of him / whether he had been any while deed. And when he knew the
truth of the Centurion / he gave y^ body to Joseph. And he bought a lynnen
cloothe / and took him down and wrapped him in y^ lynnen cloothe / and laid
him in a tomb yt was hewn out of y^ rock / and / rolled a stone unto the
door of the sepulcre. And Mary Magdalen and Mary Ioses beheld where he was
laid.

The.xvi. Chap.
ANd when y^ saboth day was past / Mary Luke.xxiiij. a Io. xx. a.
Magdalen / and Mary Iacobi / and Salome / bought odures / that they might come
and anoint him. And erly in the morninge the next day after the saboth day /
they came unto the sepulcre / when the sun was risen. And they said one to
another: who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcre? And
when they looked / they saw how the stone was rolled away: For it was a Math.
xxviij. Io. xx. c.
very great one. And they went into the sepulcre / and saw a young man
syttinge on the right side / cloothed in a long white garment / and they were
abashed.

And he said unto the^ / be not afraid: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
crucified. Math. xxviij. c.
where they put him. But go your way / and tell his disciples / and namely
Peter: he will goo before you into Galile: there shall ye se him / as he said
unto you. And they went out quickly and fleed from the sepulcre. For they
trembled and were amassed. Nether said they enythinge to any man / for they were
afraid.

When Jesus was risen the morrow after Marie Magdalene.
y^ saboth day / he appeared first to Mary Magdalen / out of whom he cast
seven devyls. And she went and toolde them that were with him as they morned
and weapte. And when they herd / that he was alyve and he had appeared to her /
they beleved it not. After that / Luke.xxiiji. b.
he appeared unto two of them in a strange figure / as they walked and went
into the country. And they went and toolde it to the remnaunt. And they beleved
them nether.

After that he appeared unto the eleve^ as Math. xxviij. Luke.xxiiij. f. Io. xx.

they sat at meat: and cast in their tethe their unbelief and hardness of
heart: because they believed not them which had seen him after his resurrection.
And he said unto them: Goo ye in to all the world / and preach the glad tyges
to all creatures / he that believes and is baptized / shallbe saved. But he
that beleveth not / shall be dampened.

And these signs shall follow them that beleve:

So then when the lord had spoken unto Luke.xxiiij. g.

them / and confirmed the word with miracles that followed.

FOr as much as many have taken in hand to compyle a treates of thoo things /
which are surely known among us / even as they declared them unto us / which
from the beginnynge saw them their selves / and were ministers at the doing: I

THere was in the days of Herod zacharias

that no man could find fawte with them. And they had no child / because that
Elizabeth was barre^ and booth were well stricken in age.

And it came to pass / as he executed the prestes office before god / as his

abashed / and fear came on him.

And behold thou shall be domme / and not able to speak until the time that
these things be performed / because thou belevedst not my words which shall be
fulfilled in their season.

And the people waited for zacharias / and mer yelled that he tarried in the
temple. And when he came out / he could not speak unto them. Whereby they
perceaved that he had seen some vision in the temple. And he beckened unto them
/ and remained speachlesse.

Then said Mary unto y^ angel: How shall this be / saying I know not a man?
And y^ angel over shaddowe ye. Therefore also y^ holy thing which shall be borne

And Mary arose in thoose days / and went Marie greteth Elizabeth.

And when the father and mother brought in the child Jesus* to do for him

filled / and every mountain and hill shall be brought low. And crocked things
shall be made straight: and the rough ways shall be made smoth: and all flesh
shall se the saveour sent of God.

Then said he to the people that were come Man. iij. ^
to be baptized of him: O generation of vipers / who has taught you to fly
from the wrath to come? Bring forth due fruits of repentance / and begin
not to say in your selves / we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto
you: God is able of these stones to reyse up children unto Abraham. Now also is
the axe leyd unto the rote of the trees: The axe
so yt every tree which brings not forth good fruit / shall be hewe^ down /
and cast in to ye fire.

And the people axed him saying: What shall we do then? He answered and said
unto them: He that has two coottes / let him part with him that has none:
and he that has meat / let him do like wise.

Then came there Publicans to be baptized / Publicans.

Jesus then full of the holy ghost / returnyd Mat. iij. a Mar. j. b.
from Jordan / and was carried of ye sprete into wilderness / and was.xl. days
tempted of the devyll. And in thoose days ate he no thing. And when they were
ended / he afterward Jesus fasteth fourtye days
hongred. And the devyll said unto him: if thou be the son of God /
command this stone yt it be breed. And Jesus answered him saying: It is
written: man shall not live by breed only / but by every word of God. Deutero*
viij. d.


And ye devyll took him up into an hye mountain / and showed him all the
kyngdoms of the world / eve^ in ye twincklinge of an eye. And ye devyll said
unto him: all this power will I geve ye every whit and the glory of the^: for
yt is delyvered to me / and to whosoever I will / I geve it. If thou therefore
wilt worship me / they shall be all thine. Jesus answered him and Deutero* vj.

said: hence from me Satan. For it is written: Thou shall honor the Lord
thy God / and him only serve.

And he carried him to Jerusalem / and set him Psalm. x^. ^
and with there hondis they shall stey the up that thou dasshe not thy foot
against a stone. Deutero* vj. c.
Jesus answered and said to him / it is said: thou shall not tempte the Lord
thy God. As Soon as the devyll had ended all his temptacions / he departed from
him / for a season.

And Jesus returned by the power of ye Matthew* iiij. b. Mar. ^* b. Io. iiij. f.
sprete in to Galile / and there went a fame of him through out all the regio^
round about. And he taught in their synagoges / and was commended of all men.

And he came to Nazareth where he was Matthew.xiij. b. Mar. vj. ^ Io. iiij. f
noursed / and as his custom was / went in to the synagoge on the Saboth days
/ and stood up for to read. And there was delyvered unto him ye book of ye
Prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book / he found the place / Esa.

where it was written. The sprete of the lord upon me / because he has
anointed me: to preach ye gospel to y^ poor he has sent me: and to heal
the broken hearted: to preach delyverau^ce to the captive / and sight to the
blind / and freely to set at lyberte them that are bruised / and to preach the
acceptable year of the Lord.

And he cloosed the book / and gave it again to the minister / and sat
down. And the eyes of all that were in the synagoge / were fastened on him.
And he began to say unto them. This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
ears. And all bare him witness / and wondered at the gracious words which
proceeded out of his mouth / and said: Is not this Joseph's son? Joseph's
son.


And he said unto them: Ye may very well say unto me this proverb:
Physician / heal thy silfe. Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum / do
the same here Io. iiij. f.
like wise in thine own country. And he said / verily I say unto you: No

IT came to pass as the people preased

When he had leeft speaking / he said unto Simon: Launche out in to the deep
/ and let slip your nets to make a draught / And Simon answered and said
to him: taken nothing. Neverthelater at thy word I will loose forth the net.
And when they had so done / they enclosed a great multitude of fisshes. And
their net brake: but they made signs to their fellows which were in the other
ship / that they should come and help the^ And they came: and filled both the
ships that they soncke again.

When Simon Peter saw that / he fell down at Jesus knees saying: Lord goo
from me / for I am a sinful man. For he was utterly astonyed and all that were
with him / at ye draught of fisshe which they took: and so was also James and
John ye sons of zebede which were parteners with Simon. And Jesus said unto
Simon: fear not / from hence forth thou shall catch men. And they brought
the ships to land / and forsook all / and followed him.

And it fortuned as he was in a certain cite: Matthew viij. a Mar. j. d.
behold / there was a man full of leprosy: and when he had spied Jesus / he
fell on his face / and besought him saying: Lord / if thou will / Leper
thou can make me clean. And he strethed forth y^ hond / and touched him
saying: I will / be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
And he warned him / that he should tell no man: but that he should god and Le.

show him self to the Priest / and offer for his clensynge / according as
Moses commandment was / for a witness unto them.

But so much the moare went there a fame abroad of him / and much people came
to geder to hear / and to be healed of him / of their infirmities. And he
kept him silfe aparte in ye wildernesses / and gave him silfe to prayer.

And it happened on a certain day / that Mat. ix. a Mar. ij. a
he taught: and there sat the pharisees: and docturs of law / which were come
out of all y^ tounes of Galile / Jury / and Jerusalem. And the power of the
Lord was to heal the^. And behold / me^ brought a man lyinge in his beed
which was taken with a palsy: and sought means Palsye.
to bring him in / and to lay him before him. And when they could not find
by what way they might bring him in / be cause of ye prease / they went up on
the top of ye housse / and let him down through the tylinge / beed and all
in the mids before Jesus. When he saw their faith / he said unto him: man /
thy sins are forgeven the. And the Scribes and the Parises begane to think
saying: What fellow is this which speaks blasphemy? Who can forgeve sins
but God only?

When Jesus perceaved their thoughts / Sign.

thy beed and go home to thy housse. And immediately he rose up before them / and
took up his beed where on he lay / and departed to his own housse praysinge
God. And they were all amassed and they lauded God / and were filled with fear
saying: We have seen strange things to day.

And after that he went forth and saw a Mat. ix. ^ Mar. ij. b.
Publican named Levi / sittinge at the receyte of custom / and said unto him:
follow me. And he leeft all / roose up / and followed him. And that same Levi

at home in his own housse. And there was a great company of publicans and of
other that sat at meat with him. And the Scribes and Pharisees murmured
against his disciples Publica^s and sinners.
saying: Why eat ye and drink ye with publica^s and sinners? Jesus answered
and said unto the^: They yt are whole / need not of ye physician: but they yt
are sick. I came not to call. ye rightewes / but sinners to repentance.

Then they said unto him: Why do the disciples Mat. ix. b Dar. ij. c. The
disciples fast not
of John fast often and pray / and the disciples of ye Pharisees also: and
thine eat and drink? And he said unto them: Can ye make ye children of the
weddinge fast / as long as ye brydgrome is present with the^? The days will
come / when the brydgrome shall be taken away from them: then shall they fast in
those days

Then he spoke unto them in a similitude: New and old agree not.
No man puts a piece of a new garment / in to an old vesture: for if he do:
then breaks he the new / and the piece that was taken out of the new /
agrees not with the old. Also / no man pours new wine into old vessels. For
if he do / the new wine breaks the vessels / and runs out it silfe / and
the vessels perisshe: But new wine must be poured into new vessels / and
both are preserved. Also / no man y^ drinks old wine / straight way can
away with new / for he says y^ old is plesau^ter.

The.vi. Chapter.
IT happened on an after saboth / that he Matthew.xxij. d Mar. ij. d Corn field.
went through the corn field / and that his disciples plucked the ears of
corn / and ate / and rubbed them in their hondes. And certain of the Pharisees
said unto them: Why do ye that which is not laufull to do The Saboth day is

and gave also to them which were with him: which was not laufull to eat / but
for the prestes only. And he said unto them: The son of man is Lord of the
saboth day.

And it fortuned in a another saboth also / Mat. xij a Mar. iij. a
that he entered in to y^ sinagoge and taught. And there was a man whose right

thoughts / and said to the man which had ye wyddred hand: Rise up / and
stand forth in the mids. And he arose and stepped forth. Then said Jesus
unto them: I will axe you a question: Whether is it laufull on the saboth days
to do good or to do evil? to save life or for to destroy it? And he beheld
them all in compass / and said unto ye man: Stretche forth thy hand. Madness
And he did so and his hand was restored / and made as whoole as the other.
And they were filled full of madness / and comuned one with another / what they
might do to Jesus.

And it fortuned in thoose days / that he Mat. x. ^ Mar. iij. b

And the Apostles returned / and told him Matthew.xiiij. b.
what great things they had done. And he took them and went a side into a
solitary place / nigh to a city called Bethsaida. And ye people Ma. vj. d
knew of it / and followed him. And he received them / and spoke unto them of

unto them: Geve ye the^ to eat. And they said. We have no moo but fyve loves

And it followed about an.viii. days after Mat. xvij a. Marc. ix. a.
thoose sayings / that he took Peter / James / and John / and went up into a

spoke of his departinge / which he should end at Jerusalem. Peter and they that
were with him / were hevy with sleep. And when they woke / they saw his glory
/ and two men stondinge with him.

And it chaunsed as they departed from him / Peter said unto Jesus: Master /
it is good being here for us. Let us make three tabernacles / one for the and
one for Moses / and one for Helyas: and wist not what he said. Whyll he thus

And they kept it cloose / and told no man in thoose days any of those

Bring thy son hidder. As he yet was a coming / the fend re^t him and tare
him. And Jesus rebuked ye unclean sprete / and healed the child / and
delivered him to his father. And they were all amassed at ye mighty power of God.

Whyll they wondered every one at all things which he did / he said unto his
disciples: Let these sayings synke down into your ears. The time will come
/ when the son of Passion.
man shall be delivered into the hondes of men. But they wist not what yt word
meant / and yt was hyd from the^ / that they understood yt not. And they feared
to axe him of that saying.

Then there arose a disputacion among the^: Matthew.xvii. b. Mar. ix. c
who should be the greatest. When Jesus perceaved ye thoughts of their hertes /
he took a child / and set him hard by him / and said unto the^: Whosoever
receaveth this child in my name / receaveth Greatest
me. And whosoever receaveth me / receaveth him yt sent me. For he yt is least
among you all / the same shall be great.

And John answered and said: Master we saw Forbid
one castinge out devyls in thy name / and we forbade him / because he follows
not with us. And Jesus said unto him: forbid ye him not. For he that is not
against us / is with us.

And it followed when the time was come yt he should be received up / then he
set his face to goo to Jerusalem / and sent messengers before him. And they
went and entered into a city of the Samaritans to make ready for him. But they
would not receave him / because his face was as though he would goo to
Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw yt / they said: Lord / will thou that we command / that fire come down from heven and consume them /
even as Helias did? Jesus turned Fire from heaven
about / and rebuked them saying: ye wot not what manner sprete year of. The
son of ma^ys not come to destroy men's lives / but to save them. And they
went to another town.

And it chaunsed as he went in the way / a Matthew.viij. c.

And he said unto another: follow me. And Bury his father.
the same said: Lord suffer me first to goo and bury my father. Jesus said
unto him: Let the deed / bury their deed: but goo thou and preach the kingdom
of God.

And another said: I will follow the Lord: but let me first goo bid them fare
well / which are at home at my housse. Jesus said Plowe.
unto him: No man that puts his hand to the plowe / and looks back / is
apt to the kingdom of God.

And he turned to his disciples / and said secretly: Happy are ye eyes / which

For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to se those things
which ye se / and have not seen them: and to hear those things which ye hear

And behold / a certain Lawere stood up / and Matthew.xxij. d Mar. xij d

tempted him saying: Master what shall I do / to inheret eternal life? He
said unto him: What is written in the law? How redest thou? And he answered
and said: Love thy Lord God / with all thy heart / and with all thy soul /
and with all thy stre^gthe / and with all thy mind: and thy neghbour as thy
sylfe. And he said unto him: Thou have answered right. This do and thou shall
live. He willinge to justify him silfe / said unto Jesus: Who is then my
neghbour?

Jesus answered and said: A certain man descended Samaritane.
from Jerusalem in to Hierico / and fell in to the hondes of theves / which
robbed him of his rayme^t and wounded him / and departed levynge him half

saw him / he passed by. And likewise a Levite / when he was come nigh to the
place / went and looked on him / and passed by. Then a certain morrow when he
departed / he took out two pe^ce and gave them to the host / and said unto
him. Take cure of him / and whatsoever thou spe^dest moare / when I come again

It fortuned as they went / that he entered Martha Marie

much servinge / and stood and said: Master / do thou not care / that my
sister has leeft me to minister alone? Syd her therefore / that she help me.
And Jesus answered / and said unto her: Martha / Martha / thou carest / and
art troubled about many things: verily one is nedfull. Mary has chosen her
that good part / which shall not be taken away from her.

The.xi. Chapter.
ANd it fortuned as he was prayinge in Mat. vj. ^
his disciples said unto him: Master / teach us to pray / as John taught his
disciples. And he said unto the^: When ye pray / ^aye: O our father which
art in heaven / hallowed The pater noster
be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be fulfilled / even in earth as it is
in heaven. Our daily breed geve us evermore. And forgeve us our sins: For
eve^ we forgeve every man yt treaspaseth us. And led us not into te^ptacio^.
But deliver us from evil.

And he said unto them: if any of you should have a friend / and should goo to
him at midnyght / and Prayer what it does.
say unto him: friend lend me three loves / for a friend of mine is come out
of the way to me / and I have nothing to set before him: and he within should
answer and say / trouble me not / the door is now sheet / and my servau^tes
are with me in the chamber / I cannot rise and geve them to the. I say unto
you / though he woldnot arise and geve him / because he is his friend: yet
because of his importunite he would rise / and geve him as many as he neded.

will he for a fysshe geve him a serpent? Or if he axe an egg: will he offer

the people wondered. But some of the^ said: he casts out devyls by the power

sign from heaven. But he knew their thoughts and said unto them: Every
kingdom divided with in it silfe / shall be desolate: and one housse shall fall
upon another. So if Satan be divided with in him silfe: how shall his kingdom
endure? Because ye say that I cast out devyls by the power of Beelzebub. If I /
by the power of Beelzebub cast out devyls: by whom do your children cast

Woe be to you: ye bylde the sepulchers of the Prophets / and your fathers

And he would said have filled his belly with the coddes that y^ swyne ate: and

when I am put out of y^ steward ship / they may receave me into their houses.

Then called he all his masters detters / and the lord commended the unjust
steward / because he had done wysly. For y^ children of this world are in
their kind / wyser then y^ children of light. And I say also unto you: make
you friends of the wicked mammon / that when ye shall depart / they may

He that is faithful in that which is lest Mammo^

are those nine? There are not found that returned agane / to geve God praise /

And he said unto the disciples: The days will come / when ye shall desire to

would not for a while. But afterward he said unto him self: though I fear
not God / nor care for man / yet because this wedowe troubles me / I will
avenge her lest at the last she come and hagge on me.

And the lord said: hear what the vnrightewes

And he put forth this similitude / unto certain which trusted in the^ selves
yt they were perfect / and despised other. Two men went up into yt temple to
pray: ye one a pharise / and the other a publican. The pharise stood and
prayed thus with him self. God I thank the y^ I am not as other men are /

And a certain ruler axed him saying: Good Master: what ought I to do / to

entreated / and shall be spetted on: and when they have scourged him / they will
put him to deeth / and the third day he shall arise again. But they
understood none of these things. And this saying was hid from them. And they
perceaved not the things which were spoken.

And it came to pass / as he was come nigh Matthew.xx. d. Mar. x. g Blind man.
unto Hierico / a certain blind man sat by the way side begginge. And when
he heard the people pass by / he axed what it meant. And they said unto him

/ have thou mercy on me. And they which went before rebuked him / that he should
hold his peace. But he cried so much the moare / thou son of David have
mercy on me. And Jesus stood still / and commanded him to be brought unto him.
And when he was come near / he axed him / saying: What will thou that I do
unto the? And he said: Lord / yt I may receave my sight: Jesus said unto
him: receave thy sight: thy faith has saved the. And immediately he saw / and

into a wild fygge tree / to se him: for he should come that same way. And
when Jesus came to the place / he looked up / and saw him / and said unto him:
zache / attonce come down / for to day I must abide at thy housse. And he

all groudged saying: He is gone in to tarry with a man that is a sinner.

And zache stood forth and said unto y^ Lord: behold Lord / y^ haulfe of my

As they heard these things / he added there Matthew.xviij. mat. xxv

thought that the kingdom of God should shortly appear. He said therefore: a

kept in a napkyn / for I feared the / because thou art a strayte man: thou
take up that thou laydest not down / and repest that thou dyddest not sow.
And he said unto him: Of thine own I did not sow? Wherefore then gave not
thou my money into the bank / that at my coming I might have required mine
own with vauntage?

And he said to them that stood by: take from him that pound / and geve it
him that has ten pound. And they said unto him: Lord he has ten pound. I

And when he was come near / he beheld the city / and wept on it saying: If

Then began he to put forth to the people / this Vineyarde. Mar. xij. Esa.

strange country for a great season. And when the time was come / he sent a
servau^t to his tennauntes that they should geve him of the fruits of the
vyneyarde. And the tennaunte did bet him / and sent him away empty. And again
he sent yet another servaunt. And they did bet him / and foul entreated him
also / and sent him away emptye. More over / he sent the third to / and him
they wounded / and cast out. Then said the lord of the vyneyarde: what shall
I do? I will send my dear son / him peradventure they will reverence / when

But when the fermers saw him / they

spoken this similitude against them.

And they watched him / and sent forth Matthew.xxij. b Mark.xij. b.

him saying: Master / we know that thou say and teach right / another

answered and said: Cesars. And he said unto them: Geve then unto Caesar / that
which belongs unto Caesar: and to God / that which pertayneth to God. And they
could not reprove his saying Saduces
before the people. But they marvayled Mat. xxij Mar. xij. Deutero *xxv. b.


Then came to him certain of the Saduces which deny that there is any
resurrection. And they axed him saying: Master / Moses wrote unto us / if any
man's brother dye havinge a wife / and the same dye with out issue: that then
his brother should take his wife / and reyse up seed unto his brother. There
were seven brethren / and the first took a wife / and dyed with out children.
And the second took the wife / and he dyed chyldlesse. And the third took her
/ and in like wise the resydue of the seven / and leeft no children be hynde
them / and dyed. Last of all the woman dyed also. Now at the resurrection whose
wife of them shall she be? For seven had her to wife.

Pharisees answered and said: Master thou have well said. And after that durst
they not axe him any question at all.

Then said he unto them: how say they matthew.xxij. d. mar. xij. d

The Gospel of Saint John.
The First Chapter.


IN the beginnynge was the word / and

There was a man sent from God / whose name was John. The same came as a witness
to bear witness of the light / that all men through him might beleve. He was
not that light: but to bear witness of the light. That was a true light / which
lyghteth all men that come into the world. He was in ye world / and the
world was made by him: and yet the world knew him not.

the will of the flesh / nor yet of the will of man: but of God.

And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us / and we saw the glory of
it / as the glory of the only begotten son of ye father / which word was
full of grace and verite.

John bare witness of him and cried saying: John bare witness
This was he of whom I spoke / he that comes after me / was before me /
because he (Grace) all grace: and all that is pleasant in the sight of god /

said the Prophet Esaias.

And they which were sent / were of the pharisees.

The next day / John saw Jesus commyge Lamb.
unto him / and said: behold the lamb of God / which takes away the sin
of the world. This is he of whom I said. After me comes a man / which was
before me / for he was yet then I / and I knew him not: but that he should be
declared to Israel / therefore am I come baptisynge with water.

And John bare record saying: I saw the mat. ijj. d. Mar. j. b. luc. iij. d.
But he that sent me to baptize in water / the same said unto me: upon whom
thou shall se the sprete descend and tarry still on him / the same is he which
baptiseth with the holy ghost. And I saw and bare record / that this is the
son of God.

The next day after / John stood again / and two of his disciples. And he
beheld Jesus as he walked by / and said: behold the lamb of God. And the
two disciples heard him speak / and followed Jesus. And Jesus turned about /
and saw them follow / and said unto them: what seek ye? They said unto him:
Rabbi (which is to say by interpretacion / Master) where dwell thou? He
said unto them: come and se. They came and saw where he dwelt: and abode with
him that day. For it was about the tenthe hour.

One of the two which heard John speak Andrew. Peter.
and followed Jesus / was Andrew Simon Peter's brother. The same found his
brother Simon first / and said unto him: we have found Messiah / which is by
interpretacion / anointed: and brought him to Jesus. And Jesus beheld him and
said: thou art Simon the son of Jonas / thou shall be called Cephas: which
is by interpretacion / a stone.

The day following Jesus would goo into Galile / and found Philip / and said

of Nazareth? Philip said to him: come and se.

Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him / and said of him. Behold a right

Jesus answered / and said unto him: Before that Philip called the / when thou

said unto him: Verily / verily / I say unto you: herafter shall ye se heven

The second Chapter.
ANd the thryde day / was there a marriage in Cana a cite of Galile: and the
mother A marriage in Cana of Galile.
of Jesus was there. And Jesus was called also and his disciples unto the
marriage. And when the wine failed / the mother of Jesus said unto him: they
have no wine. Jesus said unto her: woman / what have I to do with the? mine
hour is not yet come. His mother said unto the ministres: whatsoever he
says unto you / do it. And therwere stondynge theare / six water pottes of
stone after ye manner of the purifyinge of ye Jews / contaynynge two or three
fyrkins a piece.

And Jesus said unto them: fill the water Water into wine.
the feast had tasted the water that was turned unto wine / and knew not
whence it was (but the ministres which drue the water knew) He called the
brydegrome / and said unto him. All men at the beginnynge / set forth good
wine / and when men be drunk / then that which is worsse. But thou have kept
back the good wine / until now.

This beginnynge of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galile / and showed his glory
/ and his disciples beleved on him. After that he descended in to Capernaum /
and his mother / and his brethren / and his disciples: but continued not many
days there.

And the Jews ester was even at hand / and Jesus went up to Jerusalem / and
found Sellers in the temple are cast out.
sitting in the temple / those that sold oxen and sheep and doves / and
chaungers of money. And he made a scourge of small cords / and drove them all
out of the temple / with the sheep and oxen / and powered out the changers
money / and overthrue the tables / and said unto them that sold doves: Have
these things hence / and make not my fathers housse an housse of marchaundyse.
And his Psalmo lxviij.
disciples remembered / how y^ it was written: the zele of thine housse has
even eaten me.

Then answered the Jews and said unto matthew. xx^* and xxvij. mark.xiiij. f
and.xv. ^
that thou do these things? Jesus answered and said unto them: destroy this
temple / and in three days I will rear it up again. Then said the Jews:
xlvi. years was this temple abuyldinge: and wylt thou rear it up in three
days? But he spoke of the temple of his body. As Soon therefore as he was risen
from deeth again / his disciples remembered that he thus said. And they
beleved the scripture / and the words which Jesus had said.

When he was at Jerusalem at ester in the psalm. iij. b. and lvj. c.
feast / many beleved on his name / when they saw his miracles which he did.
But Jesus put not him self in their hondes / because he knew all men / and
neded not / that any man should testify of man. For he knew* what was in man.

The.iii. Chapter.
There was a man of the pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler among ye Jews.
Nicodemus.
The same came to Jesus by night / and said unto him: Rabbi / we know that
thou art a teacher which art come from God. For no man could do such
miracles as thou do / except God were with him. Jesus answered and said
unto him: Verily verily I say unto the: except a man be boren a new / he
cannot se the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto him: how can a man be boren
when he is old? can he enter into his moders womb and be boren again? Jesus
answered: verily / verily I say unto the: except that a man be boren of water
and of ye sprete / he cannot enter into the kingdom of god. That which is
boren of the flesh / is flesh: and that which is boren of the sprete / is
sprete. Marvayle not that I said to the / ye must be boren a new. The wind
blows where he lists / and thou hear his sound: but can not tell
whence he comes and whether he goes. So is every man that is boren of the
sprete.

And Nicodemus answered and said unto him: how can these things be? Jesus
answered

And no man ascends up to heaven / but he that came down from heaven / that
is to say / the son of man which is in heaven.

And as Moses lift up the serpent in the number. xxi
wyldernes / even so must the son of man be Serpent.
lift up / that none that beleveth in him perisshe: but have eternal life.

For God so loves the world / yt he has Faith.
geven his only son / that none that beleve j. Io. iiij.
in him / should perisshe: but should have everlastinge life. For God sent not
his son into the world / to conde^pne the world: but that the world
through him / might be saved. He that beleveth on him / shall not be
conde^pned. But he that beleveth not / is condemned all ready / because he
beleveth not in the name of Condemnacion.
the only son of God. And this is the condempnacion: that light is come into
the world / and the me^ loved darcknes more then light / because their deeds
were evil. For every man that evyll does / hates the light: nether comes
to light / lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that does truth / comes
to the light / that his deeds might be known / how that they are wrought in
God.

After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the Jews land / and
there he haunted with them and baptized. And John also baptized in Enon besides
Salim / because there was much water there / and they came and were baptized.
For John was not yet cast into preson.

And there arose a question bitwene John's Rabbi / he that was with the beyond
Jordan / to whom thou barest witness. Behold the same baptyseth / and all me^
come to him. John answered / and said: a man can receave no thing at all
except it be geve^ him from heaven. Ye your selves are witnesses / how that I
said: I am not Christ but am sent before him. He that has the bryde / is the
brydegrome. But the friend of the brydegrome which stondeth by and hears him
/ reioyseth greatly of the brydgromes voice. It Is my joy is fulfilled. He must
increace: and I must decreace.

He that comes from an hye is above all: He that is of ye earth / is of the
earth / and speaks of the earth. He that comes from heaven / is above all /
and what he has seen and heard: that he testifies: but no man receaveth his
testimonye. How be it / he that has received his testimonye has set to his
seal that God is true. For he whom God has sent / speaks romans iij. ^.
the words of God. For God geveth not the sprete by measure. The father loves
the son Measure j. Io. v. b.
and has geven all things into his hand. He that beleveth on the son /
has everlastynge life: and he that beleveth not the son / shall not se life
/ but the wrath of God abides on him.

The.iiii. Chapter.
As Soon as the Lord had knowledge / departed again into Galile. And it was so
that he must needs goo through Samaria. Then came he to a cite of Samaria
called Sichar / besides the possession that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. And
there was Jacobs ge. xlviij
well. Jesus then weryed in his journey / sat thus on the well.

And it was about the sixte hour: and there The woman of Samari e
came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said unto her: geve me
drink. For his disciples were gone away unto the town to bye meat. Then
said the woman of Samaria unto him: how is it / that thou being a Jew /
axest drink of me / which am a Samaritane? for the Jews meddle not with the
Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her: if thou knew the gift of God
/ and who it is that says to the geve me drink / thou would have axed of
him / and he would have geven the water of life. The woman said unto him. Sir
thou have no thing to draw with / and the well is deep: from whence then have
thou y^ water of life? Art thou greater then our father Jacob which gave us
the well / and he him silfe drank thereof / and his children / and his catell:

Jesus answered and said unto her: whosoever drinks of this water / shall
thurst again. But whosoever shall drink of ye water yt I shall geve him /
shall never be more a thyrst: but the water that I shall geve him / shall be in
him a well of water / springinge up in to everlastinge life. The woman said
unto him: Sir geve me of that water / that I thyrst not / nether come hedder to
draw. Jesus said unto her. Go and call thy husband / and come hydder. The
woman answered and said to him: I have no husband. Jesus said to her. Thou
have well said / I have no husband. For thou haste had five husbands / and he
whom thou now have / is not thy husband. That saydest thou truly.

The woman said unto him: Sir I perceave How and where god will be worshypped.
truth.

The woman said unto him: I wot well ij. co. iij. d
am he. And eve^ at that point / came his disciples / and marvelled that he
talked with the woman. Yet no man said unto him: what meanest thou / or why
talkest thou with her? The woman then left her waterpot / and went her way
into the cite / and said to the men. Come se a man which told me all things
yt ever I did. Is not he Christ? Then they went out of the cite / and came unto
him.

And in ye mean while his disciples prayed

Many of the Samarita^s of that cite beleved in deed Christ the savioure of the
world.

After two days he departed thence / and went matthew.xiij. a. mar. vj. a ln^.
iiij. c. mat. iiij. b
away into Galile. And Jesus him self testified / that a Prophet has none
honor in his own country. Then as soon as he was come into Galile / the
Galileans received him which had seen all the things yt he did at Jerusalem at
ye feast. For they went also unto ye feast day. And Jesus came again into
Cana mar. i. d. luc. iiij. c.
of Galile / where he turned water into wine.

And there was a certain ruler / whose son Ruler.
was sick at Capernaum. As Soon as the same herd that Jesus was come out of
Iewry into Galile / he went unto him / and besought him / yt he would descend
/ and heal his son: For he was eve^ ready to dye. Then said Jesus unto
him: except ye se signs and wo^dres / ye cannot beleve. The ruler said unto
him: Sir come away or ever y^ my child dye. Jesus said unto him / goo thy
way / thy son lives. And the man beleved ye words yt Jesus had spoken unto
him / and went his way. And anon as he went on his way / his servants met
him / and told him saying: thy child lives. Then inquired he of the^ the
hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him: Yester day the
seve^the hour / the fever left him. And the father knew that it was the same
hour in which Jesus said unto him: Thy son lives. And he beleved / and all
his household. This is again the second miracle / y^ Jesus did / after he was
come out of Iewry into Galile.

they him: what man is that which said unto the / take up thy beed and walk.

The.vi. Chapter.
AFter these things Jesus went his way matthew.xiiij. d. mar. v^j. e luc. ix.
b.
over the sea of Galile nigh to a cite called Tiberias. And a great multitude
shall we bye breed yt these might eat. This he said to prove him: for he him
sylfe knew what he would do.

Philip answered him / two hundred penny Five loves and.ii. fysshes
barley loves and two fisshes: but what is that among so many? And Jesus said.
Make the people sit down: There was much grass in the place. And the men sat
down / in nombre / about five thousand. And Jesus took the breed / and gave
thanks / and gave to the disciples / and his disciples to them that were set
down. And lykwyse of the fysshes / as much as they would.

When they had eaten enough / he said unto his disciples: gadder up the broken
meat that remains: that nothing be loost. And they gadered it to geder /
and filled twelve baskettes with the broken meat / of the five barley loves /
which broken meat remained unto the^ that had eaten. Then the men / when they
had seen the miracle that Jesus did / said: This is of a truth the Prophet
that should come into the world.

When Jesus perceaved that they would come / and mat. xiiij mar. vj. f
take him up / to make him king / he departed again into a mountain him
silfe a lone.

And when eve^ was come / his disciples went unto the sea and entered into a
ship / and went over the sea unto Capernaum. And ano^ne it was darcke / and
Jesus was not come to them. And ye see arose with a great wind yt blew. And
when they had rowe^ about a.xxv. or^ xxx. furlonge / they saw Jesus walk on
y^ see / and draw nigh unto the ship / and they were afraid. And he said unto
them: It is I / be not a frayde. Then would they have received him into the
ship / and the ship was by and by at the land whyther they went.

The day following / the people which stood on the other side of the sea /
saw that there was none other ship theare / save yt one wherein his disciples
were entered / and that Jesus

And when they had found him on y^ other side of y^ see / they said unto him:
Rabbi / when came thou hidder? Jesus answered them and said: verily verily I
say unto you: ye seek me / not because ye saw the miracles: but because ye
ate of the loves / and were filled. Labor / not for y^ meat which perissheth
/ but for y^ meat that endures unto everlastynge life / which meat y^ son
of man shall geve unto you. For him has god y^ father (sealed) that is: he
hat^ put his mark of the holy ghoost on him which testifies with miracles
what he is.
sealed.

Then said they unto him: what shall we do that we might work y^ works of
God? Jesus answered and said unto them. This is y^ work of God / that ye
beleve on him / who^ he has sent. They said unto him: what sign show thou
then / that we may se and beleve the? What do thou work? Our fathers did
eat Manna in the desert / as yt is written: He gave them breed from heaven to
eat. Jesus said unto the^: verily* verily I say unto you: exo. x vj. nu. xi.
^. ps. lxx vij sa. x vj.
Moses gave you breed from heaven: but my father geveth you the true breed from
heaven. For the breed of God is he which comes down from heaven and geveth
life unto the world.

Then said they unto him: Lord / ever moore geve us this breed. And Jesus
said unto eccle. xxiiij.
them: I am that breed of life. He that comes to me / shall not honger: and
he that beleveth on me shall never thurst. But I said unto you: that ye have
seen me / and yet beleve not. All that the father geveth me / shall come to me:
and him yt comes to me / I cast not away. For I came down from heaven: not
to do mine own will / but his will which has sent me. And this is the fathers
will which has sent me / that of all which he has geven me / I should loose no
thing: but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of
him y^ sent me: yt every man which seith y^ son and beleveth on him / have
everlastinge life. And I will raise him up at y^ last day.

The Jews then murmured at him / because he said: I am that breed which is
come down from heaven. And they said: Is not this Jesus y^ son of Joseph /
whose father and mother we know? How is yt then that he says / I came down
from heaven? Jesus answered and said unto them. Murmur not between Mat. xiij.
your selves. No man can come to me except the father which has sent me /
draw him. And I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the
Prophets / yt they shall all be taught of God. Every man therefore that has
heard and has learned of the father comes unto me. Not that any man esa. xx
vj hie. xxxj
has seen y^ father / save he which is of God: the same has seen the father.

Verily verily I say unto you / he that beleveth on me / has everlastinge
life. I am that breed of life. Your fathers did eat Ma^na in y^ wilderness and
are deed. This is that breed which comes from heaven / yt he which eats ex.
xvj. a.
of it / should also not dye. I am that lyvinge breed which came down from
heaven. If any man eat of this breed / he shall live forever. And the breed
that I will geve / is my flesh / which I will geve for the life of ye world

And the Jews strove among them selves saying: How can this fellow geve us
his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them: Verily / verily I say unto
you / except ye eat y^ flesh of ye son of man / and drink his bloube / ye
shall not have life in you. Whosoever eats my flesh / and drinks my
blood / has flesh and drynketh my blood / dwells in me and I in him. As
the lyvinge father has sent me / even so lyve I by my father: and he that
eats me / shall live by me. This is the breed which came from heaven: not as
your fathers have eaten Manna and are deed. He that eats of this breed /
shall live ever.

These things said he in the synagoge as he taught in Capernaum. Many of his
disciples / when

From that time many of his disciples went back / and walked no moore with
him. Then said Jesus to the twelve: will ye alsoo goo away? Then Simon Peter
answered: Master to whom shall we goo? Thou haste the mat. xvj.
words of eternal life / and we beleve and know / yt thou art Christ the
son of the lyvinge God. Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve /
and yet one of you is the devyll? He spoke it of Judas Iscariot the son of
Simon. For he it was yt should betraye him / and was one of the twelve.

The.vii. Chapter.
AFter that / Jesus went about in Galile and would not go about in Iewry / for
the Jews sought to kill him. The Jews tabernacle feast was at hand. His
brethren therefore said unto him: get ye hence and go into

Then Jesus said unto them: My time is not yet come / your time is all way
ready. The world cannot hate you. Me it hates: because I testify of it / that
the works of it are evyll. Go ye up unto this feast. I will not go up yet unto
this feast / for my time is not yet full come. These words he said unto them
and abode still in Galile. But as soon as his brethren were goone up / then went
he also up unto the feast: not openly but as it were prevely. Then sought him
the Jews at ye feast / and said: Where is he? And much murmuring was there
of him among the people. Some said: He is good. Mother said nay / but he
deceaveth the people. How be it no man spoke openly of him / for fear of the
Jews

In ye mids of the feast / Jesus went up into the temple and taught. And the
Jews marveylled saying: How knows he y^ scriptures / seeing yt he never
learned? Jesus answered them / and said: My doctrine is not mine: but his that
sent me. If any man will do his He that loves the will of god to keep his
law: the same understands the doctrine. Praise.
will / he shall know of the doctrine / whether it be of God / or whether I
speak of my self. He that speaks of him self / seeks his own praise. But
he that seeks his praise that sent him / the same is true / and no
vnrightewesnes is in him.

Did not Moses geve you a law / and yet none of you keeps y^ law? Why goo ye
about to kill me? The people answered and said: thou have the devyll: who
goes about to kill the? Jesus answered and said to them: I have done one
work / and ye all marvayle. Moses leu. xij. a
therefore gave unto you circumcision: not because it is of Moses / but of the
fathers. Saboth.
And yet ye on the Saboth day / circumcise a man. If a man on the Saboth day
receave circumcision without breakinge of the law of Moses: disdain ye at me
/ because I have deu. j. c
made a man every whit whoale on the saboth day? Judge not after the utter
aperaunce: but judge rightewes judgment.

Then said some of them of Jerusalem: Is not this he who^ they goo about to
kill? Behold he speaks boldly / and they say nothing to him. Do the rulars
know in deed / that this is very Christ? How be it we know this man whence he
is: but when Christ comes / no man shall know whence he is.

Then cried Jesus in ye temple as he taught saying: ye know me / and whence I
am ye know. And yet I am not come of my self / but he yt sent me is true /
whom ye know not. I know him: for I am of him / and he has sent me. Then
they sought to take him: but no man laid hondes on him / because his time was
not yet come. Many of the people beleved on him and said: when Christ comes /
will he do moo miracles then this man has done?

The pharisees heard that the people murmured such things about him. Wherefore
y^ pharisees and hye prestes sent ministres forth to take him. Then said Jesus
unto the^: Yet am I a little while with you / and then goo I unto him that sent
me. Ye shall seek me / and shall not find me: and where I am / thither can ye
not come. Then said the Jews bitwene the^ selves: whyther will he goo / that
we shall not find him? Will he goo among the gentyls which are scattered all
a broad / and teach the gentyls? What manner of saying is this that he said:
ye shall seek me / and shall not find me: and where I am / thither can ye not
come?

In the last day / that great day of the feast / Jesus stood and cried
saying: If any man thyrst / let him come unto me and drink. He that beleveth
on me / as says the scripture / out ij. pa. xvj
of his belly shall flow ryvers of water of life. This spak he of the sprete
which they that beleved on him / should receave. For the holy ghost was not yet
there / because that Jesus was not yet glorified.

Many of the people / when they heard this saying said: of a truth this is a
prophet Other said: this is Christ. Some said: shall Christ come out of
Galile? Says not the mic. v. a. mat. ij. a.
scripture that Christ shall come of the seed of David: and out of the town of
Bethleem where David was? So was there dissencion among the people about him.
And some of them would have taken him: but no man laid hondes on him.

Then came ye ministres to ye hye prestes and Rulers and pharisees beleve not.
Does any of the rulers or of the pharisees beleve on him? But the comen people
which know not ye law / are cursed. Nicodemus said unto them: He that came
to Jesus by night / and was one of them. Does our law judge any man / before
it hear him / and know what he has done? They answered and said unto him:
art thou also of Galile? Search and look / for out of Galile aryseth no
Prophet. And every man went unto his own housse.

The.viii. Chapter.
ANd Jesus went unto mount Olivete and erly in ye morning came again in was
taken in advoutry / even as the deed was a doing. Moses in the law commanded
us y^ such should be stoned. What say thou therefore? leui. xxia
And this they said to tempt him: that they might have / whereof to accuse him.
Jesus stouped down / and with his finger wrote on the ground. And whyll they
continued ^^ynge him / he lift him self up / and said unto them: let him yt
is among you with out sin cast the first stone at her. And again he stouped
down and wrote on y^ ground. And as soon deu. xvij.
as they heard that / they went out one by one the eldest first. And Jesus was
left a lone / and the woman stondynge in yt mids. When Jesus had lift up
him self again / and saw no man but the woman / he said unto her. Woman /
where are those thine accusars? Has no man condemned the? She said: No man
Lord. And Jesus said: Nether do I condemn the. Goo / and sin no moare.

Then spoke Jesus again unto them saying: Light.j. ioh. j. b.
I am the light of the world. He that follows me shall not walk in darcknes:
but shall have the light of life. The pharisees said unto him: thou bear
record of thy sylfe thy record is not true. Jesus answered and said unto
them: Though I bear record of myself yet my record is true: for I know
whence I came and whyther I goo. But ye cannot tell whence I come / and whyther
I goo. Ye judge after y^ flesh. I judge noman / though I judge yet is my
judgment true. For I am not alone: but I and the father that sent me. It is
also written in your law / that the testimony of two deu. xix v matthew. x
viij. ^ ij. co. xiij. heb. x. c.
men is true. I am one yt bear witness of myself / and the father that sent me
/ bears witness of me. Then said they unto him: where is thy father? Jesus
answered: ye nether know me / nor yet my father. If ye had known me / ye
should have known my father also.

Then said Jesus again unto them. I goo my way / and ye shall seek me / and
shall Christ is his doctrine. romans iij. d.
dye in your sins. Whyther I goo / thither can ye not come. Then said the
Jews: will he kill him self / because he says: whyther I goo / thither can
ye not come? And he said unto the^: ye are from beneth / I am from above. Ye
are of this world / I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you / that
ye shall dye in your sins. For except ye beleve that I am he / ye shall dye
in your sins.

Then said they unto him / who art thou?

Then said Jesus unto them: when ye have lift up an hye the son of man /
then shall ye know that I am he / and that I do nothing of my self: but as
my father has taught me / even so I speak: and he that sent me / is with me.
The father has not left me alone / for I do always those things that please
him. As he spoke these words / many beleved on him.

Then said Jesus to those Jews which beleved on him. If ye continue in my
words / then are ye my very disciples / and shall know the truth: ^ the
truth shall make you free. They answered him: We be Abraham's seed / and were
never bond to any man: why say thou then / ye shall be made fre.

Jesus answered them: verily verily I say romans vj. c. ij. ye. ij. d.
unto you / that whosoever commits sin / is the servaunt of sin. And the
servaunt abides not in the housse for ever: But ye son abides ever. If the
son therefore shall make you fre / then are ye fre in deed. I know that ye
are Abraham's seed: but ye seek means to kill me / because my sayings have no
place in you. I speak that I have seen with my father: and ye do that which ye
have seen with your father.

They answered and said unto him: Abraham Abraham.
Then said they unto him: we were not borne of fornicacion. We have one father
/ which is God. Jesus said unto them: if God were your father / then world
ye love me. For I proceaded forth and come from God. Nether came I of my self
/ but he sent me. Why do ye not know my speech? Even because ye cannot abide
the hearing of my words.

Ye are of your father the devyll / and the lusts of your father ye will
follow. He was a murderer from the beginnynge / and aboode j. io. iij. b.
not in the truth / because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie /
then speaks The devell.
he of his own. For he is a liar / and the father thereof. And because I tell
you ye truth / therefore ye beleve me not.

Which of you can rebuke me of sin? If I say ye truth / why do not ye
beleve me? He that is of God / hears gods words Ye therefore hear them not
/ because ye are not of God.

Then answered the Jews and said unto him: Say we not well that thou art a
Samaritane / and have the devyll? Jesus answered: Thou art a Samaritane and
have the deuell.
I have not the devyll: but I honor my father / and ye have dishonored me. I
seek not mine own praise: but there is one that seeks and judges.

Verily verily I say unto you / if a man keep my sayings / he shall never se
deeth.

Jesus answered: If I honor my self / mine honor is nothing worth. It is
my father that honors me / which ye say / is your God / and ye have not
known him: but I know him. And if I should say / I know him not / I should be
a liar like unto you. But I know him / and keep his saying.

Your father Abraham was glad to se my day / and he saw it and reioysed.
Then said the Jews unto him: thou art not yet^l. year old / and have thou
seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them: Verily verily I say unto you: yet Abraham
was / I am. Then took they up stones / to cast at him. But Jesus hid him self
/ and went out of y^ temple.

light of the world.

As Soon as he had thus spoken / he spate on the ground and made claye of the

by interpretacion / signifies sent. He went his way and washed / and came
again saying. The neghboures and they that had seen him before how that he was
a beggar / said: is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: this is he.
Other said: he is like him. But he him self said: I am even he. They said
unto him: How are thine eyes opened then? He answered and said. The man that
is called Jesus / made claye / and anointed mine eyes / and said unto me: Goo
to the pole Syloe and wesshe. I went and wesshed and received my sight. They
said unto him: where is he? He said: I cannot tell.

Then brought they to ye pharisees / him that The saboth is broken.
and I washed / and do se. Then said some of the pharisees: this man is not of
God / because he keeps not the saboth day. Other said: how can a man y^ is a
sinner / do such miracles? And there was strife among the^. Then spoke they
unto the blind again: What say thou of him / because he has openned thine
eyes? And he said: He is a Prophet.

But the Jews did not beleve of the fellow / how them and said: we wot well
that this is our son / and that he was borne blind: but by what means he
now seith / that can we not tell / or who has opened his eyes / can we not
tell. He is old enough / axe him / let him answer for him self. Such words
spoke his father and mother / because they feared

Then again called they the man that was blind / and said unto him: Geve God
the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. He answered and said: Whyther
he be a sinner or no / I cannot tell: One thing I am sure of / that I was
blind / and now I se. Then said they to him again. What did he to the? How
opened he thine eyes? He answered them / I told you yerwhyle / and ye did not
hear. Wherefore would ye hear it again? Will ye also be his disciples? Then
rated they him / and said: Thou art his disciple. We be Moses disciples. We
are sure that God spoke with Moses. This fellow

The man answered and said unto them: this is a merveleous thing that ye wot
not whence he is / saying he has opened mine eyes. For we be sure that God
hears not sinners. But if any man be a worshipper of God and do his will /
him hears he. Sense ye world began was it not heard yt any man opened the
eyes of one that was borne blind. If this man were not of God / he could have
done no thing. They answered and said unto him: thou art altogeder borne in
sin: and do thou teach us? And they cast him out.

Jesus heard that they had excommunicate him: and as soon as he had found him
/ he said unto him: do thou beleve on the son of God? He answered and
said: Who is it Lord / that I might beleve on him? And Jesus said unto him:
Thou have seen him / and he it is that talks with the. And he said: Lord I
beleve: and worshipped him. Jesus said: I am come unto judgment into this
world: that they which se not / might se / and they which se / might be made
blind. And some of the pharisees which were with him / heard these words and
said unto him: are we then blind? Jesus said unto them: if ye were blind /
ye should have no sin. But now ye say / we se / therefore your sin
remains.

The.x. Chapter.
UErely verily I say unto you: he that Door.
enters not in by y^ door / into the shepefolde / but clymeth up some other
way: the same is a thief and a robber. He that know his voice. Astraunger
they will not follow / but will fly from him: for they know not the voice of
strangers. This similitude spoke Jesus unto them. But they understood not what
things they were which he spoke unto them.

Then said Jesus unto them again. Verily Christ is the door.
not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in / he shall be safe /
and shall goo in and out and find pasture. The thief comes not but forto
steal / kill and destroy. I am come that they might have life / and have it
more abundantly.

I am ye good shepeheerd. The good shepeheerd Shepeherde.

flies / and the wolf catches them / and scatters ye sheep. The heyred
servau^t flies / because he is an heyred servaunt / and cares not for the
sheep. I am that good shepeheerd / and know mine / and am known of mine. As
my father knows me: even so know I my father. And I geve my life for
ezechiel. xxvij.
the sheep: and other sheep I have / which are not of this fold. Them also
must I bring / that they may hear my voice / and that there may be one
flock and one shepeherde.

Therefore does my father love me / because again. No man takes it from me:
but I put it away of my self. I have power to put it from me / and have power
to take it again: This co^maundment have I received of my father. And there was
a dissencion again among the Jews for these sayings / and many of them
said. He has the devyll / and is mad: why hear ye him? Other said / these
are not the words of him that has the devyll. Can the devyll open the eyes of
the blind?

And it was at Jerusalem ye feast of the dedicacion / and it was winter: and
Jesus walked j. macha. iiij.
round about him / and said unto him: How long do thou make us doubt? If
thou be Christ / tell us plainly. Jesus answered them: I told you and ye
beleve not. The works yt I do in my fathers name they bear witness of me. But
ye beleve not / because ye are not of my sheep. As I said unto you: my sheep
hear my voice / and I know them / and they follow me / and I geve unto the^
eternal life / and they shall never perisshe / nether shall any man pluck
the^ out of my hand. My father which gave the^ me / is greatter then all /
and no man is able to take them out of my fathers hand. And I and my father
are one.

Then the Jews again took up stones / to blasphemy / and because that thou
being a esa. xliiij
man / make thy self God. Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your
law: I say / ye are gods? If he called the^ gods unto whom the word of
God was spoken (and the psa. lxxxj
scripture can not be broken) say ye then to him / whom the father has
sainctified / and sent into the world / thou blasphemest / because I said I am
the son of God? If I do not the works of my father / beleve me not. But if I
do though ye beleve not me / yet beleve the works / that ye may know and
beleve that the father is in me / and I in him.

Again they went about to take him: but he escaped out of their hondes / and
went away again beyond Jordan / into the place where John before had
baptized / and there aboode. And many resorted unto him / and said. John did no
miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man are true. And many beleved
on him theare.

The.xi. Chap.
A Certain man was sick / named Lazarus of Bethania the town of Mary and her
sister Martha. It was that Mary which anointed Jesus with ointment / and
Lazarus.
wyped his fete with her here / whose brother Lazarus was sick / and his
sisters sent unto him saying. Lord behold / he whom thou love / is sick.
When Jesus heard yt / he said: this infirmite is not unto death / but for y^
laud of God / that the son of God might be praised by the reason of it.
Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. After he heard / that he was
sick / then aboode he two days still in the same place where he was.

Then after that said he to his disciples: let us goo into Iewry again. His
disciples

Then went Jesus / and found / that he had

Then said Martha unto Jesus: Lord if thou had been here / my brother had
not been deed: but nevertheless / I knew that whatsoever thou axest of God /
God will geve it the. Jesus said unto her: Thy brother shall rise again.
Martha said unto him: I know that he shall rise again in theresurreccion at
the last day. Jesus said unto her: I am the resurreccion and the life: He
that beleveth on me / ye though he were deed / yet shall he lyve. And whosoever
lyveth and beleveth on me / shall never dye. Belevest thou this? She said unto
him: ye Lord / I beleve that thou art Christ the son of god which should
come into the world.

And as soon as she had so said / she went her way and called Marie her sister
secretly

Then when Mary was come where Jesus was / and saw him / she fell done at his
fete / saying unto him: Lord if thou had been here / my brother had not
been deed. When Jesus saw her weep / and y^ Jews also weep / which came with
her / he groned in y^ sprete / and was troubled in him self and said: Where
have ye laid him? They said unto him: Lord come and se. And Jesus wept. Then
said the Jews: Behold how he loved him. And some of the^ said: could not
he which openned the eyes of the blind / have made also / that this man should
not have dyed? Jesus again groned in him self / and came to the grave. It was
a cave / and a stone laid on it.

And Jesus said: take ye away the stone. Martha the sister of him that was
deed / said unto him: Lord by this time he stinketh. For he has been deed
four days: Jesus said unto her: Said I not unto the / ye if thou did
beleve / thou should se ye glory of God. Then they take away y^ stone from
ye place where the deed was laid. And Jesus lift up his eyes and said:
Father I thank the because that thou have heard me. I wot that thou hear
me all ways: but because of the people that stand by I said it / yt they
may beleve / that thou have sent me.

And when he thus had spoken / he cried with

Then gadered the hye prestes and the Pharisees a counsel and said: what do
we? This man does many miracles If we let him escape thus / all men will beleve
on him / and ye Romans shall come and take away our country and the people.
And one of them named Cayphas which was the hieprest y^ same year / said unto
them: Ye perceave nothing at all nor yet consider that it is expedient for us
/ that one man dye for the people / and not that all the people perisshe. This
spoke he not of him self / but being hye priest that same year / he
prophesied that Jesus should dye for the people / and not for the people only /
but that he should gader to geder in one the children of God which were
scattered abroode. From that day forth they held a counsel to geder / for to
put him to deeth.

Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews: but went his way
thence unto a country nigh to a wilderness / into a cite called Ephraim / and
there hau^ted with his disciples. And the Jews ester was nigh at hand / and
many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the ester / to purify them
selves. Then sought they for Jesus / and spoke bitwene themselves as they stood
in the temple: What think ye / seeing he comes not to the feast. The hye
prestes and Pharisees had geven a commandment / that if any man knew where he
were / he should show it / that they might take him.

The.xii. Chapter.
THen Jesus six days before ester / came matthew.xxvj. mar. xiiij
which was deed and who^ Jesus raised from deeth. There they made him a supper
/ and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with
him. Then took Mary a pound of oyntme^t called Nardus / perfect and precious
/ and anointed Jesus fete / and wipt his fete with her here / and the Marie.
housse was filled of the savre of the oyntme^t. Then said one of his
disciples named Judas Iscariot Simo^s son / which afterward betrayed him:
why was not this oyntme^t sold for three hundred pence / and geve^ to the
poor? This said he / not that he cared for the pooer: but because he was a
thief / and kept the bag / and bare that which was geven. Then said Jesus:
Let her alone / against the day of my buryinge she kept it. The poor all
ways shall ye have with you / but me shall ye not all ways have.

Much people of the Jews had knowledge that he was there. And they came not
for

On the morrow / much people that were come to the feast / when they heard yt
Jesus should come to Jerusalem / took branches of palm trees and went and met
him / and cried: Hos anna.
Hosanna / blessed is he that in the name of the Lord / comes king of
Israel. And Jesus got a young ass and sat thero^ / according to mat. xxi.
mar. xiiij luc. xix. f zach. ix. b
that which was written: fear not daughter of Sio^ / behold thy king comes
sittinge on an asses coolte. These things understood not his disciples at ye
first: but when Jesus was gloryfied / then remembryd they that soche things
were written of him / and that soche things they had done unto him.

The people that was with him / when he called Lazarus out of his grave / and
raised him from deeth / bare record. Therefore met him the people / because
they heard yt he had done soche a miracle. The Pharisees therefore said among
them selves: perceave ye how we prevayle no thing? behold the world goth
away after him.

There were certain Greeks among them / that came to pray at the feast: the
same came to Philip which was of Bethsayda a cite in Galile / and desired him
saying: Sir we would feign se Jesus. Philip came and told Andrew. And again
Andrew and Philip told Jesus. And Jesus answered them saying: the hour is
come y^ the son of man must be glorified.

Derely verily* I say unto you / except ye mar. x. d. and.xvj. mar. viij.

this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man mynister unto me / let
him follow me / and where I am there shall also my minister be. And luc. i^. c.

if any man minister unto me / him will my father honor.

Now is my soul troubled / and what shall I say? Father delyver me from this
hour: but therefore came I unto this hour. Father glorify thy name. Then came
there a voice from heaven: I have glorified it / and will glorify it again.
Then said the people y^ stood by and heard: it thoundreth. Other said an
angel spoke to him. Jesus answered and said: this voice came not because of me
/ but for your sakes.

Now is the judgment of this world: psalm. cix. b. and cxvj a. ^sa. xlc

signifyinge what deeth he should dye. The people answered him: We have heard
of y^ law y^ Christ bydeth ever: and how say thou then that the son of
man must be left up? who is yt son of man? Then Jesus said un to them: yet
a little while is the light with you. Light. Darckenes.
Walk whill ye have light / lest the darcknes come on you. He that walks in
the dark / wotteth not whither he goes. Whyll ye have light / beleve on the
light / that ye may be the children of light.

These things spoke Jesus and departed / esa. liij. a. tom. x. d. esa. vj. c.

and hyd him silfe from them. And though he had done so many miracles before
them / yet beleved not they on him / yt the saying of Esayas the Prophet might
be fulfilled / yt he spoke. Lord who shall beleve our saying? And to whom is
the arm of ye Lord opened? Therefore could they not beleve / because y^
Esaias says again: he has blinded their eyes and hardened their hertes /
that they should not se with their eyes and understand with their hertes / and
should be converted / and I should heal the^. Soche things said Esaias when he
saw his glory and spoke of him. Nevertheless among ye chief rulers many
beleved on him. But because of the pharisees they would not be a known of it /
lest they should be excommunicate. For they loved the praise yt is geven of men
/

And Jesus cried and said: he that beleveth on me / beleveth not on me / but
on him yt sent me. And he that sees me / sees him that sent me. I am come a
light into the world / that Light.
whosoever beleveth on me / should not bide in darcknes. And if any man hear my
words and beleve not / I judge him not. For I came not to judge the world:
but to save ye world. He that refuses me and receaveth not my words / has
one that judges him. The words that I have spoken / they shall judge him in
ye last day. For I have not spoken of my self: but the father which sent me /
he gave me a commandment what I should say / and what I should speak. And I
know that this commandment is life everlastinge. Whatsoever I speak
therefore / eve^ as the father bade me / so I speak.

loved the^. And when supper was ended / after that the devyll had put in the
heart of Judas Iscariot Simo^s son / to betraye him: Jesus knowinge that the
father had geve^ all things into his hondes. And that he was come from God and
went to God / he rose from supper / and laid Jesus wassheth his disciples fete.
a side his upper garments / and took a towell / and gyrd him self. After
that poured he water into a basyn / and began to wash his disciples fete /
and to wype them with the towell / wherewith he was gyrde.

Then came he to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him: Lord shall thou wesshe
my fete? Jesus answered and said unto him: what I do / thou wotest not now /
but thou shall know herafter. Peter said unto him: thou shall not wesshe my
fete whill y^ world stondeth.

After he had wesshed their fete / and received his clothes / and was set down
again / he said unto them? wot ye what I have done to you? Ye call me master
and Lord / and ye say well / for mar. x. ^. luce. vj. f
so am I. If I then your Lord and master have wesshed your fete / ye also
ought to wesshe one another fete. For I have geven you an ensample / that ye
should do as I have done to you. Derely verily I say unto you / the servaunt is
not greater then his master / nether the messenger greater then he that sent
him.

When Jesus had thus said / he was troubled in the sprete / and testified
saying: verily verily I say unto you / that one of you shall betraye me. And
then the disciples looked one matthew.xxvj. b. mar. xiiij lu. xxij. b
on another doutinge of who^ he spoke. There was one of his disciples / which
leaned on Jesus bosom / whom Jesus loved. To him beckened Simo^ Peter that he
should axe who it was of whom he spoke. He then as he leaned on Jesus breast /
said unto him: Lord who is it? Jesus answered / he yt is to whom I geve a
soppe / when I have dept it. And he wet a soppe / and gave it to Judas
Iscarioth Simons son. And after the soppe / Satan entered into him.

Then said Jesus unto him: that thou do / then as he had received the soppe /
he went immediately out. And it was night. When he was gone out / Jesus said:
now is the son of man glorified. And God is glorified by him. If God be
glorified by him / God shall also glorify him / in him self: and shall
straight way glorify him.

geve my life for thy sake? Jesus answered him: will thou geve thy life for my

ANd he said unto his disciples: Let not your heart be troubled. Beleve in god

know.

Thomas said unto him: Lord we know not whyther thou go. Also how is it
possible for us to know the way? Jesus said unto him: I am ye way / ye
truth and ye life. And no man comes unto the father / but by me. If ye had
known me / ye had known my father also. And now ye know him / and have seen
him.

unto him: if a man love me and will keep my sayings / my father also will love

he hated me before he hated you. If ye were of the world / y^ world would
love his own. How be it because ye are not of ye world / but I have chosen
you out of the world / therefore hates you the world. Remember the saying
that I said unto you: the servau^te is not greater then his lord. If they
have persecuted me / so will they persecute you If they have Mar. x. c.

But all these things will they do unto you for my names sake / because they
have not known him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them / they
should not have had sin: but now have they nothing to cloak their sin with
all. He that hates me / hates my father. If I had not done works among the^
which none other man did they had not had sin. But now have they seen / and
yet have hated both me * my father: eve^ that the savinge might be fulfilled

not unto you at the beginning / because I was present with you.

But now I goo my way to him that things unto you / your hertes are full of

For I goo to the father. Then said some of his disciples it that ye inquire of

axe in mine name. And I say not unto you that I will speak unto my father for
you. For ye father him self loves you / because ye have loved me / and have
beleved that I came out from God. I went out from the father / and came into
the world: and I leve the world again / and go to ye father.

His disciples said unto him: loo now speak thou plainly / and thou use no

any man should axe the any question. Therefore beleve we that thou camst from

I pray not for them alone: but for them also which shall beleve on me through
their preaching / that they all may be one / as thou father art in me / and
I in the / that they may be also one in us / that the world may beleve that

Then Pylate entered into the iudgeme^* hall matthew xxvij. mar. xv b lu. xxiij.

Jesus answered: say thou that of thy self / or did other tell it the of me?
Pylate answered: Am Ia Jew? Thine own nation and hye prestes have delyvered

Pylate said unto them: behold ye man. When the hye Prestes and ministres saw

And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bare his cross / and went
forth into a place called the place of deed men's sculles / which is named in
Hebrew / Golgatha. Where they crucified him and two other with him on either
side one / and Jesus in the mids. And Pylate wrote his title / and put it on
the cross. The writynge was / Jesus of Nazareth / king of the Jews. This
title reed many of the Jews. For the place where Jesus was crucified / was nigh
to the cite. And it was written in Hebrew / Greek and Latin. Then said the hye
prestes of ye Jews to Pylate: write not / king of the Jews: but that he
said / I am king of the Jews. Pylate answered: matthew.xxvij. mar. xvb lu.

them / and on my coote did cast lottes. And the sou^iers did soche things in

There stood by the cross of Jesus his mother / and his mothers sister / Mary
the wife of Cleophas / and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother / and the
disciple stondynge whom he loved / he said unto his mother: woman behold thy
son. Then said he to y^ disciple: behold thy mother. And from that hour
the disciple took her for his own.

After that when Jesus perceaved that all psalmo. lxviii.
might be fulfilled / he said: I thyrst. There stood a vessel full of veneger
by. And they filled a sponge with veneger / and wound it about with ysope /
and put it to his mouth. As Soon as Jesus had received of the veneger / he said:
It is fynesshed / and bowed his heed / and gave up the ghost.

The Jews then because it was the saboth eve^ / that ye bodies should not
remain upon y^ cross on y^ saboth day (for that saboth day was an hye day)
besought Pylate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken
down. Then came the soudiers and br^ke the legs of the first / and of the
other which was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus / and saw
that he was deed already they brake not his legs: but one of the soudiers
with a spear / thrust him into the side / and forthwith came there out blood
and water.

And he that saw it / bare record / and his record is true. And he knows

there came also Nicodemuo which at the beginnynge came to Jesus by night / and
brought of myrre and aloes mingled to gether about an hundred pound wayght
Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in lynnen clothes with the

They ran both to gether / and that other disciple did out run Peter / and

Then said the disciple whom Jesus loved / unto Peter: It is the Lord. When
Simon Peter heard / that it was ye lord / he gyrde his mantell to him (for he
was naked) and sprange into the sea. The other disciples came by ship: for they
were not far from land / but as it were two hundred cubits / and they drew
the net with fysshes. As Soon as they were come to land / they saw hoo^ coals
and fysshe laid there on / and breed. Jesus said unto them: bring of the
fysshe which ye have now caught. Simon Peter stepped forth and drew the net
to land full of great fysshes / an hundred and.liii. And for all there were so
many / yet was not the net broken. Jesus said unto them: come and dyne. And
none of the disciples durst axe him: what art thou? For they knew that it
was the lord. Jesus then came and took breed / and gave them / and fysshe

after that he was risen again from deeth.

And Peter sorowed because he said to him y^ third time / love thou me / and
said unto him: Lord / thou know all things / thou know that I love

of the father / whereof ye have herd of me. For John baptized with water: but ye
shall be baptized with the holy ghost / and that with in this feawe days. When
they were come togeder / they axed of him saying: Lord will thou at this time
restore again ye kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them: It is not for you
to know the times / or the seasons which ye father has put in his own power:
but ye shall receave power of the holy ghost which shall come on you. And ye
shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem / and in all Iewrye and in Samary / and
even unto the worlds end.

And when he had spoken these things /

Then returned they unto Jerusalem from luke.xxiiij. g

And when they were come in / they went up into a parler / where abode both
Peter and James / John and Andrew / Philip and Thomas / Bartlemew and Matthew /
James the son of Alpheus / and Simo^ zelotes / and Judas James son. These
all continued with one acorde in prayer and supplicacion with the women and
Mary the mother of Jesus / and with his brethren.

And in those days Peter stood up in the psalm. xl. c io. xviij. matthew.xxvij. a
that took Jesus. For he was nou^bred with us and had obtained fellouship in
this ministracion. And the same has now possessed a plot of ground with the
reward of iniquite / and when he was hanged / brast a sondre in ye mids /
and all his bowels gusshed out. And it is known unto all the inhabiters of
Jerusalem: in so much that that field is called in their mother tongue /
Acheldama / that is to say / the blood field.

It is written in the book of Psalms: his psalm.lxviij.

Wherefore of these me^ which have co^panyed with us / all y^ time that the

that same day that he was taken up from us / must one be ordained to be are

And they appointed two / Joseph called Barsabas (whose sir name was Iustus)
and Mathias. And they prayed saying: thou Lord which know the hertes of
all me^ / show whether of these two thou have chosen that the one may take
the room of this ministracion / and apostleshippe from the which Judas by
transgression fell / that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth
their lottes / and the lot fell on Mathias / and he was Mathias
counted with the eleven Apostles.

The Second Chapter.
When the fyftith day was come / they sound from heaven / as it had been the
coming of a mighty wind / and it filled all the housse where they sat. And
there appeared unto them cloven tongues / like as they had been Tongues
fire / and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled with the holy
ghost / and began to speak with other tongues / even as the sprete gave them
vtteraunce.

And there were dwellinge at Jerusalem Jews / devoute men / which were of all
nations under heaven. When this was noysed about / the multitude came to
gether and were astonyed / because that every man heard the^ speak his own
tou^ge. They wondered all and marveyled saying among them selves: Behold /
are not all these which speak / of Galile? And how hear we every man his own
tou^ge wherein we were boren? Parthians / Medes and Elamytes / and the
inhabiters of Mesopotamia / of Jury / and of Capadocia / of Ponthus and Asia /
Phrigia / Pamphilia / and of Egypt / and of the parties of Libia which is
beside Syrene / and strangers of Rome / Jews and Conuertes: that is / hethen
or gentiles converted to the Jews faith
convertes / Greeks and Arabians: we have herd them speak with our own
tongues the great works of God. They were all amassed / and wondered saying one
to another: what means this? Other mocked the^ saying: they are full of new
wine.

But Peter stepped forth with the eleve^ / and lift up his voice / and said
unto them: Ye men of Iewrye / and all ye that inhabit Jerusalem: be this
known unto you / and with your ears hear my words. These are not dronken /
as ye suppose: for it is yet but the third hour of ye day. But this is that
which was spoken by y^ Prophet ^ohel: It shall be in the iohel.ij. g
last days says God: of my sprete I will power out upon all flesh. And
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy / and your yo^ge men shall se
visions / and your old me^ shall dreme dremes. And on my servau^ts / and on
my hand maidens I will power out of my sprete in those days / and they shall
prophesye. And I will show wonders in heaven a bove / and tokens in the earth
benethe / blood and fire / and the vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned
into darkness / and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of
the Lord come. And it shall be / that whosoever shall call on the name of the
Lord shall be saved.

Ye men of Israel hear these words. Jesus roma. x. ^.
of Nazareth / a man approved of God among you with miracles / wondres and
signs which God did by him in ye mids of you / as ye your selves know: him
have ye taken by the hondes of vnrightewes persons / after he was delivered by
the determinat counsel and foreknoweledge of God / and have crucified and
slain: whom God has raised up and lowsed Death psalm. xv. c
the sorrows of deeth / because it was impossible that he should be holden of
it. For David speaks of him: Before hand I saw God always before me: For he
is on my right hand / that I should not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice
/ and my tongue was glad. Moreover / also my flesh shall rest in hope /
because Hell.
thou will not leve my soul in hell / nether wilt suffer thine holy to se
corrupcio^. Thou have showed me the ways of life / and shall make me full of
joy with thy countenance.

Men and brethren / let me freely speak unto iij. re. ij. b
you of the patriarch David: For he is both deed and buried / and his sepulcre
remains with us unto this day. Therefore saying he was a Prophet / and knew
that God had sworn with an oath to him / that the fruit of his loins should
sit on his seat (in that Christ should rise again in the flesh) he saw
before: and spoke in the resurreccion of Christ / that his soul* should not be
left in hell: nether his fles se should se corrupcio^. This Jesus has God
raysyd up / where of we all are witnesses.

Sense now that he by the right hand of God exalted is / and has received of
the father the promise of the holy ghost / he has sheed forth that which ye
now se and hear. For David is not ascendyd into heaven: but he said. The
Lord said to my Lord sit on my p^a^. cjx. ^
right hand / until I make thy fooes thy footstool. So therefore let all the
housse of Israel know for a suerty / yt God has made y^ same Jesus whom ye
have crucified lord and Christ.

When they heard this / they were pricked in their hertes / and said unto
Peter and unto the other Apostles: Ye men and brethren / what shall we do?
Peter said unto them: repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ / for the remission of sins / and ye shall receave the gift of
the holy ghost. For y^ promise was made unto you and to your children / and to
all that are afar / even as many as ye Lord our God shall call. And with
many other words bare he witness and exhorted them saying: Save your selves
from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his preaching /
were baptized: and the same day / there were added unto them about three
thousand souls.

And they continued in the Apostles doctrine and felloushippe / and in
breakinge of breed / and in prayer. And fear came over every soul. And many
wondres and signs were showed by the Apostles. And all that beleved kept them
selves to gedder / and had all things common / and sold their possessions and
goods / and departed them to all men / as every man had need. And Comme^.
they continued daily with one acorde in the temple / and brake breed in every
heu^se / and did eat their meat to gedder / with gladness and singlenes of
heart praysinge God / and had faveour with all the people. And the* Lord added
to ye congregation daily soche as should be saved.

And all the people saw him walk and laud God. And they knew him / that it

wondered and were sore astonnyed at that which had happened unto him. And as y^
halt which was healed / held Peter and John / all the people ran amassed unto
them in Salomons porche.

When Peter saw that / he answered unto the people. Ye men of Israel / why

own power or holiness / we had made this man goo? The God of Abraham / Isaac

faith of his name / has made this man sound / whom ye se and know. And the
faith which is by him / has geven to him this health in the presence of you
all.

And now brethren I wot well that through ignorance ye did it / as did also
your heddes. But those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all
his Prophets / how yt Christ should suffer / he has thus wise fulfilled.
Repent ye therefore and turn / yt your dut. xviii


For Moses said unto the fathers: A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
unto you / even of your brethren / like unto me: him shall ye hear in all
things whatsoever he shall say unto you. For the time will come / y^ every
soul which shall not hear that same Prophet / shall be destroyed from among
the people. Also all the Prophets from Samuel and thence forth / as many as
have spoken / have in lykwyse told of these days.

Ye are the children of the Prophets / and of the covenant which God has
made unto our fathers saying to Abraham: Eve^ in thy seed shall all the
kinredes of the earth be blessed. First unto you has God raised up his son
Jesus / and him he has sent to bliss you / that every one of you should turn
from your wickedness.

The.iiii. Chapter
AS they spoke unto the people / the prestes Saduces
came upon them / taking it grevously that they taught y^ pople and preached
in Jesus the resurreccion from deeth. And they laid hondes on them / and put
them in hold until the next day: for it was now even tide. How be it many
of them which heard the words / beleved / and the noumbre of the men was
about fyve thousand.

And it chaunsed on the morrow that their rulars and elders and Scribes / as
Annas the chief Pressed and Cayphas and John and Alexander / and as many as were
of y^ kynred of the hye prestes gadered to geder at Jerusalem / and sit the
other before them / and axed: by what power or what name have ye done this
syrs? Then Peter.
rulars of the people / and elders of Israel / if we this day are examined of
the good deed done to the sick man / by what means he is made whoale: be yt
known unto you all / and to the people of Israel / that in the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth / who n ye crucified / and whom God raised again from

When they saw the boldness of Peter and John / and understood that they were
unlearned men and lay people / they marveyled / and they knew them / that they
were with Jesus: and beholdinge also the man which was healed stondinge with
the^ / they could not say against it. But they commanded them to go a side
out of the counsel / and counceled among them selves saying: what shall we
do to these men? For a manifest sign is done by the^ / and is openly known to
all them that dwell in Jerusalem / and we cannot deny it. But that it be
noysed no farther among the people / let us threaten / and charge them that
they speak hence forth to no man in this name.

And they called them / and commanded them that in no wise they should speak
or teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered unto them and said:
whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you moare then God is more to
be obeyed then man
God / judge ye. For we cannot but speak that which we have seen and heard.
So threatened they them and let them goo / and found no thing how to punysshe
them / because of the people. For all me^ lauded God for the miracle which was
done: for the man was above forty year old / on whom this miracle of
healinge was showed.

As Soon as they were let goo / they came to their fellows / and showed all that
the hye prestes and elders had said to them. And when they heard that / they
lift up their voices to God with one accord / and said: Lord / thou art
God which have made heaven and earth / the sea and all that in them is / which
by the mouth of thy servaunt David have said: Why did the hethen rage / and the
people immagen vain psalm. ij. a.
things. The kings of the earth stood up and the rulars came to gedder /
against the Lord and against his Christ.

For of a truth / against thy holy child Jesus

And the multitude of them that beleved / were of one heart / and of one soul.
Also none of them said / that any of the things which he possessed / was his
own: but had all things commen. And with great power gave Commen
the Apostles witness of the resurreccion of the Lord Jesus. And great grace
was with them all. Nether was there any among them / that lacked. For as many
as were possessers of lands or housses / sold them and brought Love.
the price of the things that were sold / and laid yt down at the Apostles
fete. And distribucion was made unto every man according as he had need.

And Ioses which was also called of the Apostles Barnabas (that is to say the
son. ne of consolacion) being a Levite / and of the country of Cipers / had
land / and sold it. and laid the price down at the Apostles fete.

The.v. Chapter.
A Certain man named Ananias with Ananias Saphira
Saphira his wife sold a possession / and kept away part of the price (his
wife also being of counsel) and brought a certain part / and laid it down
at the Apostles fete. Then said Peter: Ananias / how is it that Satan has
filled thine heart / that thou should lie unto the holy ghost / and keep away
part of the price of the lyvelod: Pertayned it not unto the only / and after
it was sold / was not the price in thine own power? How is it that thou have
co^ceaved this thing in thine heart? Thou have not lied unto men / but unto
God. When Ananias herd these words. he fell down and gave up the ghost. And
great fear came on all the^ that these things heard. And the young men roose
up / and put him a part / and carried him out / and buried him.

And it fortuned as it were about the space of.iii. hours afte^ / that his
wife came in / ignorant of that which was done. And Peter said unto her: Tell
me / gave ye the land for so much? And she said: ye for so much Then Peter
said unto her: why have ye agreed to gether / to te^pt the sprete of the
Lord? Behold the fete of them which have buried thy husband / are at the
door / and shall carry the out. Then she fell down straight way at his fete
and yielded up the ghost. And the young men came in / and found her ded / and
carried her out and buried her by her husband. And great fear came on all the
congregation / and on as many as heard it.

By the hondes of the Apostles were many The shadow of Peter.
came by / might shadow some of them. There came also a multitude out of y^
cities round about / unto Jerusalem / bringynge sick folks / and them which
were vexed with unclean spretes. And they were h^aled every one.

Then ye chief priest rose up and all they that Sadnces
were with him (which is the sect of the Saduces) night openned the preson
doors / and brought them forth / and said: goo / step forth / and speak
in the temple to the people all the words of this life. When they heard that
/ they entered into the temple erly in the morninge and taught.

The chief pressed came and they that were with him / and called a counsel to
gedder / and all the elders

Then came one and showed them: behold y^ men y^ ye put in preson / stand in
the temple / and teach the people. Then went the ruler of the temple with
ministe^s / and brought the^ with out violence. For they feared the people /
lest they should have been stoned. And when they had brought them / they set
them before the counsel. And y^ chief presteaxed the^ saying: did not we
straytely command you that ye should not teach in this name? And behold ye
have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine / and ye God must be obeyed


Peter and the other Apostles answered and said: We ought moare to obey God
then men. The God of our fathers raised up I^ Jesus / whom ye slew and hanged
on tree. Him has god lift up with his right hand / to be a ruler and a
savioure / for to geve repe^tau^ce to Israel and forgevenes of sins. And we
are his records concerning these things and also the holy ghost whom God
has geve^ to them y^ obey him. When they heard yt / they clave asunder: and
sought means to slay them. Then stood there up one in ye counsel / a Pharisey
named Gamali^l / a doctoure of law / Gamaliel
had in auctorite among all the people / and commanded to put the Apostles a
side a little space / and said unto them: Men of Israel take heed to your
selves what ye entende to do as touching these men. Before these days rose
Theudas.
up one Theudas bostinge him self / to whom resorted a nombre of men / about a
f^ure hundred / which was slain / and they all which beleved him were scatred a
brood and brought to naught. After this man arose there up one Judas Judas y^
Galilean
of Galile / in the time when tribute began / and drew away much people
after him.

And now I say unto you: refrain your selves from these men / let them
alone. For if ye counsel or this work be of men / it will come to naught. But
and if it be of God / ye cannot destroy it / lest happily ye be found to stryve
against God. And to him they agreed / and called the Apostles / and bet them /
and commanded that they should not speak in y^ name of Jesus / and let them goo.

And they departed from the counsel / reioy sing yt they were counted worthy
to soffre rebuke for his name. And daily in the temple and in every housse they
ceased not / teachinge and preachinge Jesus Christ.

The.vi. Chapter.
IN those days as the nombre of the disciples Seven deacones
brethren / look ye out among you seven men of honest report / and full of
the holy ghost and wisdom / which we may apoynte to this nedfull busynes. But
we will geve oureselves continually

And the word of God increased / and the nou^bre Steven.
full of faith and power / did great wondres and miracles among ye people.
Then there arose certain of the synagoge / which are called Lybertines and
Syrenites / and of Alexandria / and of Cilicia / and Asia / and disputed with
Steven. And they could not resist the wisdom / and the sprete / with which he
spoke. Then sent they in men / which said: we have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses / and against God. And they moved ye people
and the elders and the scribes: and came upon him and caught him / and brought
him to the counsel / and brought forth falce witnesses which said. This man
ceasith not to speak blasphemous

The.vii. Chapter.
THen said ye chief pressed: is it even so? The sermon of Stephin.
yet in Mesopotamia / before he dwelt in Charran / and said unto him: come out
of thy contre / and from thy kynred / and come into the land / which I shall

after that / as soon as his father was deed / genesis xij. a
he brought him into this land / in which ye now dwell / and he gave him none
inheritance in it / no not the bredeth of a foot: but promised yt he would
geve it to him to possess and to his seed after him / when as yet he had no
child.

God verily spoke on this wise that his seade should be a dweller in a strange
land and that they should keep them in bondage and entreat them evyll.iiii.

place. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And he begat Isaac / and
circumcised him the viii. day / and Isaac begat Jacob / and Jacob the twelve
patriarchs.

And the patriarchs havinge indignacio^ sold Joseph into Egipte. And God was

him and delivered him out of all his adversities. And gave him faveour and
wisdom in the sight of Pharao king of Egipte which made him governer over
Egipte / and over all his household.

Then came there a derth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan / and great
affliccion / that our fathers found no sustenau^ce. But when Jacob heard that
there was corn in Egipte / he sent our fathers first / and at the second time
/ Joseph was known of his brethren / and genesis xliij. genesis xlv.
Joseph's kynred was made known unto Pharao. Then sent Joseph and caused his
father to be brought and all his kynne / three score and xv. souls. And Jacob
descended into Egipte and dyed both he and our fathers / and were genesis xlvj
ge. xlix. gene. l. b.
translated into Sichem / and were put in ye sepulere that Abraham bought for
money of the sons of Emor / at Sichem.

When ye time of ye promise drue nigh (which exo. j. a
God had sworme to Abraham) the people grew exo. ij. a.
not remain alyve. The same time was Moses borne / and was a proper child in
ye sight of God / which was norisshed up in his fathers housse three months.
When he was cast out / Pharoes daughter took him up / and norisshed him up for
her own son. And Moses was learned in all manner wisdom of the Egipcians /
and was mighty in deeds and in words.

And when he was full forty year old / it came into his heart to visit his
brethren / the children of Israhel. And when he saw one of them suffer wrong
/ he defended him / and avenged his quarrel that had the harm done to him /
and smote the Egypcian. For he supposed his brethren would have understand how
yt God by his hondes should save them But they understood not.

And the next day he showed him self unto exo. ij. ^
at one again saying: Syrs / ye are brethren / why hurt ye one another? But
he that did his neghbour wrong / thrust him away saying: who made ye a rular
and a judge among us? What / will thou kill me / as thou dyddest the Egyptian
yester day? Then fleed Moses at that saying / and was a stranger in the land
of Madian / where he begat two sons.

And when.xl. years were expired / there appeared exo. iij. a
to him in the wyldernes of mount Syna an angel of the Lord in a flamme of
fire in a busshe. When Moses saw it / he wondered at the sight. And as he drue
near to behold / the voice of the Lord came unto him: I am y^ God of thy
fathers / the God of Abraham / the God of Isaac / and the God of Jacob. Moses
trembled and durst not behold. Then said y^ Lord to him: Put of thy shows
from thy fete / for the place where thou stondest / is holy ground. I have
perfectly seen the affliccion of my people which is in Egypt / and I have
heard their gronynge / and am come down to delyver them. And now come and I
will send the into Egypt.

This Moses whom they forsook saying: who made the a ruelar and a judge: the
same God sent both a ruler and delyverer / / by y^ hondes of the angel which
appeared to him in the exo. vij. and.viij. ix. x. xi. xiiij exo. xvj.
busshe. And the same brought them out showing wonders and signs in Egypt /
and in the reed see and in the wyldernes.xl. years. This is that Moses which
said unto the children of Israel: A Prophet shall the Lord your deu. xviij
God raise up unto you of your brethren like exo. xix.
unto me / him shall ye hear.

This is he that was in y^ congregation / in the wyldernes with the angel
which spoke to him in y^ mou^te Syna / and with our fathers. This man received
the word of life to geve unto us / to who^ our fathers would not obey but
cast it from them / and in their hertes turned back again into Egypt /
saying unto Aaron: ex. xxxij
Make us gods to goo before us. For this Moses that brought us out of the
land of Egypt / we wot not what is become of him. And they made a calfe in
those days / and offered sacrifice unto the image / and reioysed in the works
of their own hondes.

Then God turned him self / and gave them up / that they should worship the
stars of the sky / as it is written in the book of the prophets. aino. v. ^
O ye of y^ housse of Israel gave ye to me sacrefices and meat offerynges / by
the space of xl. years in the wilderness* And ye took unto you the tabernacle
of Moloch / and the star of your god Remphan / figures which ye made to
worship them. And I will translate you beyond Babylon.

Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in y^ wyldernes / as he had appointed
the^ speaking ex. xxv d he. vii^. b joshua. iij c
unto Moses / that he should make it acordynge to the fassion that he had seen.
Which tabernacle our fathers received / and brought it in with Iosue into the
possession of the gentyls which God drove out before the face of j. re. xvj.
ps. cxxxj
our fathers unto the time of David / which found favor before God / and
desired that he might find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But Solomon bylt
him an housse.

How be it he that is h yest of all / dwells not in temple God dwells not
in temples or churches made with hands.
made with hondes / as says the Prophet: Heven is my seat / and earth is my
footstool / what housse will ye bylde for me says the Lord? or what place is
it that I should rest in? has not my hand made all these things?

Ye stiffenecked and of uncircumcised hertes and ears: ye have all ways
resisted the holy ghost: as your fathers did / so do ye. Which of the
prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them / which
showed before of the coming of that just / whom ye have now betrayed and
mordred. And ye also have received a law by the ordinance of angels / and
have not kept it.

When they heard these things / their hertes clave a sunder / and they
gnasshed on him with their tethe. But he being full of the holy ghost / looked
up stedfastlye with his eyes into heven and saw the glory of God / and Jesus
stondynge on the right hand of God / and said: behold / I se the hevens open
/ and the son of man stondynge on the right hand of god. Then they gave a
shute with a loud voice / and stopped their ears and ran upon him all at
once / and cast him out of the cite / and stoned him. And the witnesses laid
down their clothes at a young man's fete named Saul. Saul
And they stoned steven calling on and saying: Lord Jesus receave my sprete.
And he kneled down and cried with a loud voice: Lord lay not this sin to
their charge. And when he had thus spoken / he fell a sleep.*

The.viii. Chapter.
SAul had pleasure in his deeth. And at Saul.
against the congregation which was at Jerusalem / and they were all scattered
abroad thorowout the regions of Jury and Samaria / except the Apostles. Then
devout men dressed Steven / and made great lamentacion over him. But Saul made
havocke of the congregation entering into every housse / and drew out both
man and woman / and thrust the^ into preson. They that were scattered abroad /
went every where preaching the word. Then came Philip into a cite of Samaria
and preached Philip.
Christ unto them. And the people gave head unto those things which Philip
spoke / with one acorde / in that they heard and saw the miracles which he
did. For unclean spretes cryinge with loud voice / came out of many that were
possessed of them. And many taken Simon magus.
was a certain man called Simon / which before time in the same cite / used
witch craft and bewitched the people of Samarie / saying / that he was a man
yt could do great things. Whom they regarded / from y^ lest to the greatest
/ saying: this fellow is the great power of God. And him they set much by /
because of long time with sorcery he had mocked the^. But as soon as they
beleved Philippes preaching of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus
Christ / they were baptized both men and women. Then Simon himself beleved
also / and was baptized / and continued with Phillip / and wondered beholdynge
the miracles and signs / which were showed.

When y^ Apostles which were at Jerusalem

When Simo^ saw / that through layinge Layenge on of hands.
on of the Apostles hondes on them / the holy ghost was geven: he offered the^
money saying: Geve me also this power / that on whom soever I put the hondes /
he may receave the holy ghost. Then said Peter unto him: thy monye perysh
with the / because thou wenest that the gift of God may be obtained with money.
Thou have nether part nor felloushippe in this business. For thy heart is not
right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness / and pray
God that y^ thought of thine heart may be forgeven the. For I perceave that
thou art full of bitter gall / and wrapped in iniquite.

Then answered Simon and said: Pray ye to the lord for me y^ none of these
things which ye have spoken / fall on me. And they / when they had testified
and preached the word of the lord / returned toward Jerusalem / and preached
the gospellin many cities of the Samarita^s.

Then the angel of the lord spoke unto Phillip saying: arise and goo
toward mydde day unto y^ way y^ goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which
is in y^ desert. And he arose and went on. And behold a man of Ethiopia which
was a cha^berlayne / and of great auctorite with Ca^dace queen of y^ Ethiopia^s /
and had y^ rule of all her treasure / came to Jerusalem forto pray. And as he
returned home again sittynge in his charet / he read Esaias y^ prophet

Then y^ sprete said unto Phillip: Goo near and join thy self to yonder
charet. And Philip ran to him / and heard him read y^ prophet Esayas and
said: Understondest thou what thou redest? And he said: how can I / except I
had a gyde? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. The
tenoure of y^ scripture which he read / was this. He was led as a sheep to
be slain: and like a lamb do^me before his sherer / so opened he not his
mouth. Because he was of so low degree in this world: but a poor car penter
/ and humbled him self unto all men / and was obedient eue^ unto the most
vile death of the cross: therefore cannot the Jews esteem h^ for the very
messiah.
Because of his humblenes / he was not esteemed: who shall declare his
generacio^? for his life is taken from the earth. The chamber layne answered
Philip and said: I pray the / of whom speaks the Prophet this? of him self
/ or of some other man?

And Philip opened his mouth / and began He answered and said: I beleve that
Jesus Christ is the son of God. And he commanded the charet to stand
still. And they went down both into the water: both Philip and also the
chamberlayne / and he baptized him. And as soon as they were come out of the
water / the sprete of the lord caught away Philip / yt the chamberlayne saw
him no moore. And he went on his way reioysinge: but Philip was found at
Azotus. And he walked through out y^ country preaching in their cities / till
he came to Cesarea..

The.ix. Cha.
ANd Saul yet brethynge out threatenings and slaughter against y^ disciples of
gala. j. b.
of him letters to Damasco / to y^ synagoges: that if he found any of this
way / whether they were men or women / he might bring them bound unto
Jerusalem. But as he went on his journey / it fortuned y^ he drue nigh to Damasco
/ and suddenly there shyned round about him a light from heven. And he fell to
y^ earth / and heard a voice saying to him: Saul / j. cor. xv. ij. cor. xij
Saul / why persecutest thou me? And he said / what art thou lord? And the
lord said / I am Jesus whom thou persecutest / it shall be hard for y^ to kycke
against y^ prick. And he Saul is converted.
both trembling and astonyed said: Lord what will thou have me to do? And
y^ Lord said unto him: arise and goo into the cite / and it shall be told the
what thou shall do.

The men which iornayed with him / stood amassed / for they herd a voice / but
saw no man. And Saul arose from the earth / and opened his eyes / but saw no
man. Then led they him by the hand / and brought him into Damasco. And he
was.iii. days with out sight / and nether ate nor drank. And there was a
certain disciple at Damasco named Ananias / and to him said the lord in a
vision: Ananias. Ananias
And he said: behold I am here lord. And the lord said to him: arise and
goo into the street which is called straight and seek in the housse of Judas /
after one called Saul of Tharsus. For behold he prays / and has seen in a
vision a man named Ananias coming in to him / and putting his hondes on him /
that he might receave his sight.

Then Ananias answered: Lord I have heard

Ananias went his way and entryd into y^ housse and put his hondes on him and
said: brother Saul / the lord that apperyd unto the in the way as thou camst
/ has sent me / that thou myghtest receave thy sight and besilled with the
holy ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales / and
he received sight / and arose and was baptized / / and received meat and was
comforted.

Then was Saul a certain day with the disciples Paul preaches Christ.
that he was the son of God. All that heard him / were amassed and said: is
not this he that spoiled the^ which called on this name in Jerusalem / and came
hither for y^ intent that he should bring the^ bound unto the hye prestes? But
Saul increased in strength / and confounded the Jews which dwelte at Oamasco /
affirminge that this was very Christ.

And after a good while / y^ Jews took counsel to gether / to kill him. But
their layinge Paul is persecuted.
awayte was known of Saul. And they watched at the gates day and night to
kill him. Then y^ disciples took him by night and put him through the wall and
let him down in a basket. ij. cor. xj.


And when Saul was come to Jerusalem / he rest thorowoute all Iewry and galile
and Samary / and were edified / and walked in the fear of the lord / and
multiplied by the comfort of the holy ghost.

And it chaunsed y^ as Peter walked throughoute Eneas.
viii. year sick of the palsy. Then said Peter unto him: Eneas Jesus Christ
make y^ whole. Arise and make thy beed. And he arose immedyatly. And all that
dwelt at lydda and assaron / saw him / and turned to the lord.

There was at Ioppe a certain woman (which Tabitha dorcas.
was a disciple named Tabitha / which by interpretacion is called dorcas) the
same was full of good works and alms deeds / which she did. And it chaunsed
in those days that she was sick and dyed. When they had wesshed her and laid
her in a chamber: Because Lydda was nigh to Ioppa / and the disciples had heard
that Peter was there / they sent unto him / desiring him that he would not be
greved to come unto them.

Peter arose and came with them and when he was come / they brought him in to
y^ chamber. and lift her up / and called the saints and wydowes / and showed
her alyve. And it was known throwout all Ioppa / and many beleved on the
Lord. And it fortuned that he tarried many days in Ioppa with one Simon a
tanner.

The.x. Chapter.
There was a certain man in Cesarea called Cornelius / a captain of y^
soudiers Cornelius.
of Italy / a devoute man / and one yt feared God with all his household / which
gave much alms to the people / and prayde God always. The same man saw in a
vision evyde^tly about y^ nynthe hour of y^ day an angel of god coming
into him / and saying unto him: Cornelius. When he looked on him / he was
afraid / and said: what is it lord? He said unto him. Thy prayers and thy
almeses ar come up into remembrance before God. And now send men to Ioppa /
and call for one Simon named also Peter. He lodges with one Simon a tanner /
whose housse is by y^ see side. He shall tell the / what thou ought to do.
When the angel which spoke unto Cornelius was departed / he called two of his
household servauntes / and a devoute soudier of them that waited on him / and
told them all the matter / and sent them to Ioppa.

While Peter mused in him self what this vision which he had seen meant /
behold / the men which were sent from Cornelius / had made inquirance for
Simons housse / and stood before the door. And called out won and axed whether
Simon which was also called Peter were lodged there. Whyll Peter thought on
this vision / the sprete said unto him: Behold / men seek the: arise therefore
/ get the down / and goo with them / and doubt not. For I have sent them.
Peter went down to y^ men which were sent unto him from Cornelius / and said
/ Behold / I am he whom ye seek / what is the

And on y^ morrow Peter went away with them / and certain brethren from Ioppa

And Cornelius said: This day now.iiii. days I fasted / and at the nynthe

While Peter yet spoke these words / the holy ghost fell on all them which
heard the preachinge. And they of y^ circumcision which beleved / were
astonyed / as many as came with Peter / because that on the Gentyls also was
sheed out y^ gift of the * holy ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues
and magnify God. Then answered Peter: can any man forbid water that these should
not be baptized / which have received the holy ghost as well as we? And he
commanded them to be bapty sed in the name of the Lord. Then prayde they him

delyvered the^ the decrees for to keep / ordained of the Apostles and elders

When they had goone through out Phrigia / and the region of Galacia / and were

Macedonia and help us. After he had seen ye vision / immediately we prepared to

came the next day over against Chios. And the next day we aryved at Samos /
and tarried at Trogilion. The next day we came to Myleton: for Paul had
determined to leave Ephesus as they sailed / because he would not spend ye

When he had thus spoken / he kneled down / and prayed with them all. And they
wept all abundantly / and fell on Paul's neck / and kissed him / sorowinge
most of all for the words which he spoke / that they should se his face no

ANd it chaunsed that as soon as we had Jerusalem. And when the days were ended
/ we departed and went ^ure ways / and they all brought us on our way / with
their wyves and children / till we were come out of the cite. And we kneled
down in the shore and prayde. And when we had taken our leave one of another
/ we took ship / and they returned home again.

When we had full ended the course from Tire / we aryved at Ptolomaida / and
saluted the brethren / and abode with the^ one day. The next day / we that
were of Paul's company / departed and came unto Cesarea. And we entered into the

daughters virge^s / which did prophesy. And as we tarried there a good many
days / there came a certain prophet from Jury / named Agabus. When he

and said: thus says the holy ghost: so shall y^ Jews at Jerusalem bind the
man yt owes this gerdell / and shall delyver him into the hondes of the
gentyls.

When we heard this / both we and other of selfs ready / and went up to
Jerusalem. There went with us also certain of his disciples of Cesarea / and
brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus / an old disciple with whom we should
lodge. And when we were come to Jerusalem / the brethren received us gladly.
And on the morrow Paul went in with us un to James. And all the elders came to
geder. And when he had saluted them / he told by

have written and concluded / y^ they observe no soche things: but that they
keep them selves from things offered to ydoles / from blood / from strangled
and from fornicacion. Then the next day Paul took the men / and purified him
self with them / and entered into the temple / declaringe that he observed the
days of y^ purificacio^ / until that an offeringe should be offered for every
one of them.

And as the seven days should have been ended / y^ Jews which were of Asia
when they saw him in the temple / they moved all the people / and laid hondes

every where against the people / and the law / and this place. Moreover also
he has brought Greeks into the temple / and has polluted this holy place. For
they saw one Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the cite. Him they supposed
Paul had brought into the temple. And all the cite was moved / and the people
swarmed to geder. And they took Paul and drue him out of the temple / and
forthwith the doors were shut to.

As they went about to kill him / tydinges came unto the hye captain of the
soudiers / that he commanded him to be carried into the castle. And when he
came unto a greece / it fortuned that he was borne of the soudiers of the

he would send for him to Jerusalem: and laid awayte for him in the way to

soche manner questions / I ayed him whyther he would goo to Jerusalem / and

sentence. And I punysshed them often in every synagoge / and compelled them to
blaspheme: and was yet more mad upon them / and persecuted the^ / even unto
strange cities. About the which things as I went to Damasco with auctorite
and license of the hye Prestes / even at myddaye (o king) I saw in ye way a

should come / that Christ should suffer / and that he should be the first that
should rise from deeth / and should show light unto the people / and the
gentyls.

As he thus answered for him self: Festus said with a loud voice: Paul /
thou art besides thy self. Much learning has made the mad. And Paul said:
I am not mad most dear Festus: but speak the words of truth and sobernes.
The king knows of these things / before whom I speak freely: nether think I
that any of these things are hydden from him. For this thing was not done in
a corner. King Agrippa belevest thou ye prophets? I wot well thou belevest.

of Adramicium / and lowfed from land / appointed to sail by the costs of Asia

us. And the next day we came to Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul
/ and gave him liberte to goo unto his friends / and to refresshe him self.
And from thence lanched we / and sailed hard by Cypers / because the wyndes
were contrary. Then sailed we over the sea of Cilicia / and Pamphylia / and
came to Myra a cite in Lycia.

And there y^ under captain found a ship of Alexanderredy to sail into
Italy and put us therein. And when we had sailed slowly many days / and scace
were come over against Gnydon (because the wind with stood us) we sailed hard
by the costs of Candy / over against Salmo / and with much work sailed
beyond yt / and came unto a place called good port. Nigh whereunto was a city
called Lasea. When much time was spent and saylinge was now ieoperdeous /
because also that we had overlonge fasted / Paul put them in remembrance / and
said unto them and the master / better then tho things which were spoken of
Paul. And because the haven was not co^modius to winter in / many took counsel
to depart thence / if by any means they might attain to Phenices and there
to winter / which is an haven of Candy / and servith to the southwest and

When yt was day / they knew not y^ land but they spied a certain haven with

the sea / and lowsed the rudder bonds and hoysed up y^ main sail to the
wind and drue to land. But they chaunsed on a place / which had the sea on
both the sides / and thrust in the ship. And the foore part stuck fast and
moved not / but ye hinder brake with the violence of the waves.

The soudears counsel was to kill y^ presoners / lest any of them / when he
had swome out / should fle away. But the vndercaptayne willinge to save Paul /
kept the^ from their purpose / and commanded that they yt could swyme / should
cast the^ selves first in to y^ see / and escape to land. And the other he
commanded to goo / some an bordes / and some on broken pieces of the ship. And
so it came to pass / that they came all safe to land.

ANd when they were escaped / then they knew that the isle was called Milete.
And the people of the country showed us no little kyndnes: for they kyndled a
fire and received us every one / because of the present rain / and because of
cold. And when Paul had gaddered a boundle of sticks / and put them into the
fire / there came a viper out of the heet and lept on his hand. When the men of
the contre saw the worm hang on his hand / they said among the^ selves:
this man must needs be a mortherer. Whom (though he have escaped the sea) yet
vengeance suffers not to lyve. But he shouke of the vermen into the fire /
and felt no harm. Howbeit they waited when he should have swollen / or fallen

come to him / they changed their minds / and said that he was a God.

Here ends the Acts of the Apostles.
A prologe to the Epistle of Paul to the Romans.
FOr as much as this pistle is the principal and most excellent part of the
new etestam^t / and most pure Euangelion / that is to say glad tydinges and
that we call gospel / and also a light and a way in unto the hole scripture
/ I think it mete / that every Christen man not only know it by rote and with
out the book / but also exercise him self therein evermore continually / as
with the daily bread of the soul. No man verily can read it to often or study
it to well: for the moare it is studied the easier it is / the moare it is
chewed the plesander it is / and the moare groundely it is serched the precio
set things are found in it / so great treasure of spiritual things lies
hyd therein.

I will therefore bestow my labor and diligence / through this little preface
or prologe / to prepare away in there unto / so farforth as god shall give me
grace / that it may be the better understand of every man / for it has been
hitherto evil darkened with gloses and wonder full dreams of sophisters /
that noman cowde spy out the entente and meaning of it / which nevertheless
of it self / is a bright light / and sufficient to give light unto all the
scripture.

First we must mark diligently the manner of speaking of the Apostel / and
above all thing know what Paul means by these words / How paul uses
ce^te^ words / must be dilligent lie understand.
the Law / Sin / Grace / Faith / Ryghteousnes / Flesh / Sprite and soche
like / or else read thou it never so often / thou shall but loose thy labor.
This word Law may not be understand here after the common manner / and to
use Paul's term / after the manner of men or after man's ways / that thou
would say the law here in this place were nothing but learning which
teaches what ought to be done and what ought not to be done / as it goes
with man's law where the law is fulfilled with outewarde works only /
though the heart be ne ver so far of. But God judges the ground of the heart
/ ye and the thoughts and the secret mouynges of the mind / and therefore his
law requires the ground of the heart and love from the botome* there of / and
is not content with the outeward work only: but rebukes those works most of
all which spring not of love from the ground and low botome of the heart /
though they appear outward never so honest and good / as Christ in the gospel
rebukes the Pharisees above all other that were open sinners / and calls them
ypocrites / that is to say Simulars / and painted Sepulchers. Which Pharisees
yet lived no men so pure / as perteynynge to the outewarde deeds and works of
the law. Ye and Paul in the third chapter of his Pistel unto the Philippians
confesses of him self / that as touching the law he was such a one as no
man cowde complain on / and notwithstondynge was yet a murderer of the
Christen / persecuted them / and tormented them / so soore / that he compelled
the^ to blaspheme Christ / and was all to gether mercylesse / as many which
now feign outward good works are.

For this cause the.c.xv. Psalm calls all men liars / because that noman
keeps the law from the ground of the heart / nether can keep it / though he
appear outward full of good works.

For all me^ are naturally enclyned unto evil and hate the law. We find in
our selves unlust and tediousnes to do good / but lust and delectacyon to do
evil. Now where no fre lust is to do good / there the botome of the heart
fulfilleth not the law / and there no doubt is also sin / and wrath is
deserved before God / though there be never so great an outward show and
apearaunce of honest lyuinge.

For this cause concludes saint Paul in the second Chapter / that the Jews
are all sinners and transgressors of the law / though they make men believe /
through ypocrisy of outward works / how that they fulfill the law / and
says that he only which does the law / is ryghteous before God / meaning
thereby that no man with outward works / fulfilleth the law.

Thou (says he to the Jew) teach / a man should not break wedlock / and
yet breakest wedlock thy self. Wherein thou iudgest an other man / therein
condemnest thou thy self / for thou thy self do even the very same things
which thou iudgest. As though he would say / thou lyuest outewardly well in
the works of the law / and indgest them that live not so. Thou teach other
men: and see a moote in an other man's eye / but art not ware of the beam
that is in thyn own eye. For though thou keep the law outewardly with works
for fear of rebuke / shame and punysshement / other for love of reward /
vauntage and* vain glory / yet do thou all with out lust and love toward
the law / and had lever a great deal other wise do / if thou dydest not
fear the law* ye inwardly in thine heart / thou would that there were no
law / no nor yet God / the auctor and vengear of the law / if it were
possible: so paynefull it is unto the to have thine appetytes refrayned / and
to be kept down.

Wherefore then it is a plain conclusion / that thou from the ground and
botome of thine heart / art an ennymye to the law. What prevayseth it now /
that thou teach an other man not to steal / hen thou thine own self art
a thief in thine heart / and outwardly would feign steal if thou durst?
though that the outward deeds abide not always behind with soch ypocrites and
dissimulars / but break forth among / even as an evil scabbe or a pocke can
not all ways be kept in with violence of medicine.

Thou teach an other man / but teach not thy self / ye thou wotest not
what thou teach / for thou vnderstondest not the law a right / how that it
cannot be fulfilled and satisfied / but with an unfeigned love and affecyon / so
greatly it can not be fulfilled with outeward deeds and works only. Moreover
the law increases sin / as he says in the fyfte Chapter / because that man
is an enymy The law encrea* seth sin
to the law / for as much as it requires so many things clean contrary to
his nature / where of he is not able to fulfill one point or title / as the
law requires it. And therefore are we moare provoked / and have greater lust
to break it.

For which causes sake he says in the seventh Chapter / that the law is
spiritual: as though he would say / if the law were flesshely and but man's
doctrine / it might be fulfilled / satisfied and stylled with outward deeds.
But now is the law goost^ye / and no man fulfylleth it / except that all
that he does / spring of love from the botome of the heart. Such anewe heart a

ward / can thou neuyr come by of thine own strenght and enforcemente / but
by the open racy on and workynge of the spirit.

For the spirit of God only makes a man spiritual and like unto the law /
so that now henceforth he does nothing of fear or for lucre or vantages
sake or of vain glory / but of a fre heart / and of inward just. The law is
spiritual and will be both loved and fulfilled of a spiritual heart / and
therefore of necessite requires it the sprete that makes a man's heart fre /
and gives him lust and courage unto the law ward. Where soche* a sprite is
not / there remains sin / grudgynge and hatered against the law / which
law nevertheless is good / ryghtewes and holy..

Acquaynte thy self therefore with the manner of speaking of the Apostel / and
let this now styke fast in thine heart / that it is not both one / To do the
deeds of ye law / and to fulfill the law / are two things.
to do the deeds and works of the law / and to fulfill the law. The work of
the law is / what soever a man does or can do of his own frewill / of his
own proper strength and enforsynge. Not withstondynge though there be neuyr
so great workynge / yet as long as there remains in the heart unlust /
tediousnes / grudgyng / grief / pain / lothsumnes and compulsion toward the
law / so long are all the works unprofitable / lost / ye and damnable in the
sight of God. This means Paul in the thryde chapter where he says / by the
deeds of y^ law shall no flesh be justified in the syghte of god. Here by
perceauest thou / that those sophisters are but disceauers / which teach that
a man may / and must prepare him self to grace and to the favor of God /
with good works. How can they prepare them selves unto the favor of god /
and to that which is good / when they the^ selves can do no good / no can not
once think a good thought or consent to do good / the devil possessinge their

God think thou / which are done with grife / pain and tediousnes / with an

thou confound Prosperous.
this heresye / about (I trow) a twelve hundred years a goo / or therapon.

To fulfill the law is / to do the works thereof To fulfill the law what it
is.
and what soever the law commands / with love / lust and inward affeccion
and delectacion: and to live godly and well / freely / willingly / and with out
compulcion of the law / even as though there were no law at all. Such lust
and fre liberte to love the law / comes only by the workinge of the sprite in
the heart / as he says in the first Chapter.

Now is the sprite none otherwise given / then by faith only / in that we

us / for Christ's bloudes sake / as it is plain in the first chapter. I am
not asshamed says Paul / of Christ's glad tydinges / for it is the power of
God / unto salvation to as many as believe. For atto^ce and to gedder* even as
we believe the glad tydinges preached to us / the holy ghost enters in to our
hertes / and lowseth the bonds of the devil / which before possessed Faith

our hertes in captivity / and held the^ that we could have no lust to the
will of God in the law. And as the sprite comes by faith only / eue^ so
faith comes by hearing the word or glad tydinges of God / when Christ is
preached / how that he is gods son and man also / ded and risen again for
our sakes / as he says in the.iii. iii^. and.x. Chapters. All our
iustifyinge then comes of faith / and faith and the sprite come of God and not
of us. Faith only justifies.


Here of comes it / that faith only justifies / makes rightewes / and
fulfilleth the law / for it brings the sprete through Christ's deseruinges /
the sprite brings lust / loses the heart / makes him fre / sets him at
liberte / and gives him strength to work the deeds of the law with love /
even as the law requires. Then at the last out of the same faith so workinge
in Works spring of faith.
the heart / spring all good works by there own accord. That means he in
the third chapter: for after he has cast away the works of the law / so
that he sounds as though he would break and disanull the law through faith:
he answers to that might be laid against / saying* wedestroye not the law
through faith but maintain / further or stablisshe the law through faith. That
is to faye / we fulfill the law through faith.

Sin in the scripture is not called that outeward Sin
work only committed by the body / but all the whole busynes and what soever
accompanies / moves or stereth unto the outeward deed / and that whence the
works spring: as unbelief / pronenes and redynes unto the deed in the ground
of the heart / with all the powers / affeccions and appetites where with we can
but sin. So that we say / that a man then synneth / when he is carried away
hedlonge in to sin / all to geder as much as he is / of that poison
inclinacion and corrupt nature wherein he was conceived and borne. For there is
none outward sin committed / except a man be carried away all to gedyr /
with life / soul / heart / body / lust and mind ther^to. The scripture
looks singularly unto the heart / and unto the role and original fountain of
all sin / which is unbelief in the botome of the heart. For as faith only
justifies and brings Faith is the mother of all good works / and un belefe
of evil.
the sprite and lust unto the outewarde good works / eue^ so unbelief only
da^neth and keeps out the sprite / provoke the f^esshe and stereth up
lust unto the cuyll outeward works / as happened to Ada^ and ^ua in Paradise.
Gene. ii^.

For this cause Christ calls sin unbelief / and that notably in ^. xvj.
chap. of John. The sprete / says he / shall rebuke the world of sin /
because they believe not in me. And John viij. he says: I am the light of the
world. And therefore in the.xij. of John he byddeth them / while they have
light / to believe in the light / that ye may be the children of light: for he
that walks in darcknes wotteth not whether he goes. Now as Christ is the
light / so is the ignorance of Christ that darcknes whereof he speaks / in
which he that walks wotteth not whether he goes: that is / he knows not
how to work a good work in the sight of God / or what a good work is. And
therefore in the.ix. he says: as long as I am in the world / I am the light
of the world: but there comes night when no man can work. Which night is
but the ignorance of Christ in which no man can se to do anyeworke that
pleases God. And Paul exhorts Ephesi. iiii. that they walk not as other
hethen which are strangers from thelyfe of God / through the ygnorau^ce that is
in the^. And again in the same chap. Put of (says he) the old man which is
corrupt through the lusts of error / that is to say ignorance. And To.
xii^ Let us cast away the deeds of darcknes: that is to say of ignorance and
unbelief. And.j. Pet. j Fassion not your selves unto your old lusts of
ignorance. And.j. Io. ij. He that loves his brother dwells in light: and he
that hates his brother walks in darcknes / and woteth no^ whether he goes /
for darckenes has blinded his* eyes. By light he means the knowledge of
Christ / and by darcknes / the ignorance of Christ. For it is impossible that
he that knows Christ truly / should hate his brother.

Furthermore / to perceive this thing more clearlye / thou shall understand /
that it is impossible to sin any sin at all except a man break the first
commandment before. Now is the first commandment deuyed into two verses.
Thy Lord God is one God: and thou shall love thy Lord God with all thine
heart / with all thy soul / with all thy power and with all thy might. And the
whole cause why I sin against any inferioure precept / is that this love is
not in mine heart: for were this law written in my heart and were full and
perfect in my soul / it would keep mine hearet from consenting unto any
sin. And the whoale and only cause why this love is not written in our
hearts / is that we believe not the first part / that our Lord God is one
God. For wist I what these words / one Lord and one God means: that is to
say / if I understood that he made all / and rules all / and that whatsoever
is done to me / whether it be good or bad / is yet his will / and that he only
is the Lord that rules and does it: and wist I thereto what this word mine
means* that is to say / if mine heart believed and felt the infinite
benefits and kyndenes of God to me ward / and understood and ernestlye
believed the many fold couenauntes of mercy wherewith God has bound him self
to be mine wholly and altogether / with all his power / love / mercy and might
/ then should I love him with all mine heart / soul / power and might / and of
that love ever keep his commandments. So seye now that as faith is the
mother of all goodness and of all good works / so is unbelief the ground and
rote of all evil and all evil works.

Finally / if any man has forsaken sin and is converted to put his trust
in Christ and to keep the law of God / do the fall at a time: the cause is /
that the flesh through neeglige^ce has choked the sprite and oppressed her
and taken from her the fode of her strength. which fode is her meditacion in
God and in his wonderful deeds / and in the manyfolde couenauntes of his
mercy.

Wherefore then before all good works as good fruits / there must needs be
faith in the heart whence they spring. And before all bad deeds as bad fruits /
there must needs be unbelief in the heart as in the rote / fou^tayne / pith and
stre^ght of all sin. Which unbelief and ignorance is called the heed of the
serpent and of the old dragon / which the woman's seed Christ / must tread
under foot / as it was promised unto Adam.

Grace and gift have this difference. Grace properly Grace. Gift.
is Gods favor / beniuolence or kind mind / which of his own self / with
out deserving of us / he bears to us / whereby he was moved and inclined to
give Christ unto us / with all his other gifts of grace. Gift is the holy
ghost and his workinge whom he pours in to the hertes of them / on whom he
has mercy / and who^ he favors. Though the gifts of the sprite encreace in
us daily / and have not yet their full perfeccion: ye and though there remain
in us yet evil lusts and sin which fight against the sprite / as he says
here in the.vij. Chapter / and in the v. to the Galathia^s / and as it was
spoken before in the thride Chapter of Genesis of the debate between the woman's
seed and the seed of the serpent: yet nevertheless goddis favor is so great
/ and so strong over us for christ's sake / that we are counted for full hole
and perfect before God. For Goddis favor toward us / deuydeth not her self
/ encreasinge a little and a little / as do the gifts / but receaueth us
hole and all to gether in full love for Christ's sake our intercessor and
mediator / and because that the gifts of the sprite and the battle between
the sprite and evil lusts / are begone in us all ready.

Of this now vnderstondest thou the.vij. chapter where Paul accuses him self
as a sinner and yet in the.viij. Chapter says / there is no damnacion to them
that are in Christ / and that because of the sprite / and because the gifts
of the sprite are bego^ne in us. Sinners we are because the flesh is not full
killed and mortified. Nevertheless in as much as we believe in Christ / and
have the ernest and beginning of the sprite / and would feign be perfect / God
is so louinge and favorable unto us that he will not look on soche sin /
nether will count it as sin / but will deal with us according to our
belefe in Christ / and according to his promises which he has sworn to us /
until the sin be full slain and mortified by death.

Faith is not ma^s opinion and dream / as some ymagin and feign when they
hear the story of Faith is not the work of man.
the Gospel: but when they se that there follow no good works nor mendement
of lyuinge / though they hear / and yet can babyll many things of faith /
then they fall from the right way and say / faith only justifies not / a
man must have good works also / if he will be rightewes and safe. The cause is
when they hear the Gospel or glad tydinges / they feign of their own
strength certain imaginacio^s and thoughts in their hertes saying: I have
heard the Gospel / I remember the story / lo I believe. And that they count
right faith / which nevertheless as it is but ma^s imaginacio^ and fayninge /
eue^ so profits it not / nether follow there any good works or mendement of
lyuinge.

But right faith is a thing wroughte by the Right faith is of the workinge of
the spirit of God.
holy ghost in us / which changes us / turns us in to a new nature and
begets us a new in God / and makes us the sons of God / as thou redest
in the first of John / a kills the old Adam / and makes us all to gethyr
new in the heart / mind / will / lust and in all our affeccio^s and powers of
the soul / and brings the holy ghost with her. Faith is a lively thing /
mighty in workinge / valiaunte and strong / ever doing / ever fruitful / so
that it is impossible that he which is endued therewith / should not work all
ways good works with out ceasinge. He axeth not whether good works are to
be done or not / but has done the^ all ready / yet mencio^ be made of them /
and is all way doing / for soche is his nature now: quick faith in his
heart and lively mouinge of the sprite drive him and stere him theru^to. Who
soever does not good works / is an unbelieving person and faithless / and
looks round about gropinge after faith and good works / and wot not what
faith or good Faith what it is
works mean / though he babill never so many things of faith and good works.

Faith is then a lively and sted fast trust in the favor of God / wherewith
we commit our selves all to gedyr unto God / and that trust is so surely
grounded and steketh so fast in our hertes / that a man would not once doubt
of it / though he should dye a thousand times therefore. And such trust wrought
by the holy ghost through faith / makes a man glad / ^u^^y / cherefull and
true herted unto God and to all creatures. By the means where of / willingly
and without co^pulsion he his glad and ready to do good to every man / to do
service to every man / to soffre all things / that God may be loved and
praised / which has given him such grace: so that it is impossible to separat
good works from faith / even as it is impossible to separat heete and burni^ge
from fire.

Therefore take heed to thy silfe / and beware of thine own fantasies and
ymaginacions / which to judge of faith and good works will semewyse / when in
dead they are sterke blind and of all things most folysshe. Pray God that he
will witesafe to work faith in thine heart / or else shall thou remain
evermore faythlesse / feign thou / ymagin thou: enforce thou / wrastyll with
thy self / and do what thou will or can.

Righteousness is eue^ such faith / and is called Gods righteousness / or
righteousness that* is of valor before God. For it is Goddis gift / and it

nature / and makes him fre and liberal to pay every man his duty. For
through faith is a man purged of his sins / and obteyneth lust unto the law
of God / whereby he gives God his honor and pays him that he owes him /
and unto me^ he does seruis willingly wherwithsoeuer he can / and pays every
man his duty. ^uthe righteousness can nature / frewill / and our own
stre^gthe never bring to pass. For as no man can give him silfe faith / so
can he not take away unbelief / how then can he take away any sin at all.
Wherefore all is false ypocrisy and sin / whatsoever is done with out faith
or in unbelieve / as it is euyde^t in the. xiiij Chapter unto the Romans /
though it appear never so glorious or beautyfull outwardes.

Flesh and sprite may thou not here understood / as though flesh were
only that which perteyneth unto vnchastite and the sprite that which inwardly
pertayneth to the heart: but Paul calls flesh here as Christ does John
Flesh what it is
iij. All that is borne of flesh / that is to wete / the whole man withlife /
soul / body / wit / will / reason and what soever he is or does with in and
with out / because that these all / and all that is in man / study after the
world and the flesh. Call flesh therefore whatsoever (as long as we are
with out the sprite of God) we think or speak of God / of faith of good
works and of spiritual matters. Call flesh also all works which are done
with out grace and with out the workinge of the sprite / how soever good /
holy and spiritual they seem to be / as thou may prove by the.v. Chapter
unto the Galathy a^s / where Paul numbreth worshepinge of ydols / witchecrafte
/ envy and hate among the deeds of the flesh / and by the.viij. unto the
Romans / where he says that the law by the reason of the flesh is weak
which is not understand of vnchastite only / but of all sins / and most
specially / of unbelief which is a vice most spiritual and ground of all
sins.

And as thou callese him: which is not renewed with the sprite and borne again
in Christ / flesh / and all his deeds / even the very mocyo^s of his heart and

never so gross as the wasshinge of the disciples fete / done by Christ and
Peter's fisshinge aftyr the resurreccion / ye and all the deeds of matrimony are
pure spiritual / if they proceed of faith / and what soever is done with in
the laws of God / though it be wrought by the body / as the very wipinge of
shows and soche like / how soever gross they appear outewarde. Without such
vndersto^dinge of these words can thou never understand this epistell of
Paull / nether any other place in the holy scripture. Take heed therefore / for
whosoever understands these words other wise / the same understands not
Paul / what soever he be. Now will we prepare our selves unto the pistle.

For as much as it becomes the precher of The first Chapter.
Christ's glad tydinges / first through opening of the law / to rebuke all
things and to prove all things sin / that proceed not of the sprit and of
faith in Christ / and to prove all men sinners and children of wrath by
inheritance / and how that to sin is their nature / and that by nature they
can none other wise do than to sin / and therewith to abate the pride of man /
and to bring him unto the knowledge of him self / and of his miserye and
wretchedness / that he might desire help. Even so does saynet Paul and
begins in the first Chapter to rebuke unbelief and gross sins which all
men se / as the ydo latrie / and as the gross sins of the hethen were and as
the sins now are of all them which live in ignorance without faith / and
without the favor of God: and says. The wrath of God of heaven appears
through the Gospel upon all men for their ungodly and unholy lyvinge. For
though it be known and daily understand by the creatures / that there is but
one God yet is nature of her self without the sprite and grace so corrupt and
so poisoned / that men nether can thank him / neder worship him / nether
give him his due honor / but blind them selves and faule without ceasinge
in to worse case / even until they come unto worshippinge of images and
workinge of shameful sins which are abominable and against nature / and
moreover sofre the same unrebuked in other / having delectacion and pleasure
therein.

In the second Chapter he proceadeth further Second Chapter.
and rebukes all those holy people also which without lust and love to the
law / live well outwardly in the face of the world and condemn other gladly
/ as the nature of all ypocrites is / to think them selves pure in respect of
open sinners / and yet hate the law inwardly and are full of covetousness a
envy and of all uncleanness / Mat. xxiij. These are they which despise the
goodness of God / and according to the hardenes of their hertes / hepe to geder
for themselves the wrath of God. Furthermore saynet Paul as a true expou^der
of the law / suffers no man to be without sin / but declaret and that all
they are under snne which of frewill of nature / will live well / and suffers
them not to be better then the open sinners / ye he calls them hard herted
and seche as cannot repent.

In the third Chap. he myngleth both to geder / both Third Chapter.
the Jews and the ge^tyles and says that the one is as the other / both
sinners / and no difference between the^ / save in this only / that the Jews
had the word of God committed unto the^. And though many of them believed not
thereon / yet is goddis truth and promise thereby nether hurt ner minisshed:
And he takes in his way and allegeth the saying of the.l. Psalm. that God
might abide true in his words and overcome when he is judged. After that he
returns to The law ius^ifieth not: but utters the sin only and
condemns.
his purpose again and proves by the scripture / that all men without
difference or excepcion are sinners / and that by the works of the law no man
is justified: but that the law was given to utter and to declare sin only.
Then he begins and shows the rightwaye unto rightewesnes / by what means
men must be made righteous and safe / and says. They are all sinners and
without praise before God / and must without their own oeseruinge be made
righteous through faith in Christ / which has deserved soche righteousness for
us / and is become unto us goddis mercy stole for the remission of sins that
are past / thereby proving that Christ's righteousness which comes on us
through faith / helps us only. Which righteousness / sayeh he is now declared
through the gospel and was testified of before by the law and the Prophets.
Furthermore (says he) the law is help and for dered through faith / though
that the works thereof with all their ^oste are brought to naught and proved
not to justify.

In the.iiij. Chapter (after that now by the Fourth Chapter.
iij. first Chapters / the sins are opened and the way of faith unto
righteousness laid) he begins to answer unto certain obieccio^s and
cauillacyo^s. And first he puts forth those blind reasons / which commenly
they that wylbe justified by their own works / are wo^t to make when they
hear that faith only with out works justifies / saying / shall men do no
good works / ye and if faith only justifies / what needs a man to stody for
to do good works? He puts forth therefore Abraham for an en sample /
saying: what did Abraham with his works? was all in vain? came his works to
no profet? And so concludes that Abraham with out and before all works was
justified and made righteous. In so much that before the work of circumcision
he was praised of the scripture and called righteous by his faith only /
Genesis.xv. So that he did not the work of circumcision for to be help thereby
unto righteousness / which yet God commanded him to do / and was a good work
of obedience / So in like wise no doubt none other works help any thing at
all unto a ma^s iustifiynge: but as Outward works are signs and witnesses of
the inward faith.
Abraham's circumcision was an outeward sign whereby he declared his
righteousness which he had by faith / and his obedience and redynes unto the
will of god / even so are all other good works outeward signs and outeward
fruits of faith and of the sprite / which justify not a man / but that a man
is justified all ready before God inwardly in the heart / through faith and
through ye sprite purchased by christ's blood.

Here with now establissheth saint Paul his doctrine of faith before rehearsed in
the third chapter / and Blessed is he that has his sins for given him.
brings also testimony of David in the.xiij. psalm / which calls / a man
blessed not of works / but in that his sin is not rekened and in that faith
is imputed for^ righteousness / though he abide not afterward without good
works / when he is once justified.

For we are justified and receive the sprite for to do good works / nether
were it otherwise possible to do good works / except we had first the sprite.

For how is it possible to do any thing well in the sight of god / while we are
yet in captivity and bondage under the devil / and the devil possesses us
all to geder and holds our hertes / so that we cannot once consent unto the
will of god. No man therefore can prevent the sprite in doing good: but the
sprite must first come and wake him out of his sleep and with the thunder of
the law fear him / and show him his miserable estate and wretchedness / and
make him abhore / and hate him silfe and to desire help / and then comfort
him again with the pleasant rain of the Gospel / that is to say / with the
sweet promyses of God in Christ / and stere up faith in him to believe the
promises. Then when he believes the promyses / as God was mercy full to promise
/ so is he true to fulfill them / and will give him the sprite and strength /
both to love the will of god and to work there after. So se we that God only
(which according to the scripture works all in all things) works a man's
iustifiynge / salvation and health / ye and powers faith and believe / lust
to love goddis will / and strength to fulfill the same / in to us / even as
water is powered into a vessel / and that of his good will and purpose / and
not of ourede seruinges and merits. Goddis mercy in promysinge and truth in
fulfilling his promyses saves us and not we our selves. And therefore is all
laud / praise and glory / to be given un to God for his mercy and truth / and
not unto us for ouremerites and deseruinges. After that / he stretches his
ensample out against all other good works of the law / and concludes that
the Jews cannot be Abraham's heirs because of blood and kynred only / and
much less by the works of the law / but must enheret Abraham's faith / if
they will be the right heirs of Abraham for as much as Abraham before the law
/ both of Moses and also of circ^^cision / was through faith made righteous
and called the father of all them that believe / and not of them that work.
Moreover the law causes wrath / in as mocheas no man can fulfill it with love
and fuste / and as long as such grudginge / hate and in dignacion against the
law remains in the heart / and is not taken away by the sprite that comes
by faith / so long (no doubt) the works of the law / declare evidently that
the wrath of God is upon us and not favor. Wherefore faith only receives the
grace promised unto Abraham. And these ensamples were not written for Abraha^s
sake only (says he) but for ours also to whom if we believe / faith shall be
rekened likewise for righteousness / as he says in the end of the Chapter.

In the.v. Chapter he commends the fruits The.v. Chapter.
and works of faith / as are peace / reioysinge in the conscience inward love
to God and man: moreover / boldness trust / confidence and astro^ge and a lusty
mind and steadfast hope in tribulacion and sufferinge. For all such follow /
where the right faith is / for the abunda^te graces sake and gifts of the
sprite / which God has given us in Christ / in that he gave him to dye for us
yet his enymies. Now have we then that faith only before all works justifies
and that it follows not yet therefore that a man should do no good works but
that the right shapen works Good works are the fruits of the sprite.
abide not behind / but acco^panye faith / eue^ as brightenes does the sun /
and are called of Paul the fruits of the sprite. Where the sprite is / therit
is always somer and there are always good fruits / that is to say: good
works. This is Paul's order / that good works spring of the sprite / the
sprite comes by faith and faith comes by hearing the word of God / when
the glad tydinges and promises which god has made to us in Christ / are
preached truly / and received in the ground of the heart without waueringe or
doutinge aftir that the law has passed upon us and has damned our
co^scie^ces. Where the word of God is preached purely and received in the
heart / thereis faith and the sprite of God / and there are also good works of
necessite when soever occasion is given. Where Goddis word is not purely
preached / but men's dreams / traditions ^ ymaginacio^s inue^cions / ceremonies
and supersticion / there is no faith and consequently no sprite that comes of
God. And where Goddis sprite is not / there can be no good works / eue^ as
where an appell treis not / there can grow no appels / but; there is unbelief
/ the deuels sprite and evil works. Of this goddis sprite and his fruits /
have our holy ypocrites not once known / nether yet tasted how sweet they are
/ though they feign many good works of their own ymaginacion / to be
justified with all / in which is not one crome of true faith or spiritual love
/ or of inward joy / peace and quyetnes of conscience / for as much as they
have not the word of God for them / that such works please God / but they
are even the roten fruits of a roten tree.

After that he breaks forth / and ritneth at large / and shows whence both
sin and righteousness / deeth and life come. And he co^pareth Ada^ and Christ
to gether / thus wise reasoninge and disputinge / that Christ must neades come
as a second Ada^ to make us heirs of his rightewesnes / through a neme
spiritual birth / without ourede seruiges: eue^ as the first Ada^ made us
heirs of sin / through the bodily generation / without our deserving.
Whereby is euydently known and proved to the vttermoste / that no man can
bring him self out of sin unto rightewesnes / no more then he could have
withstonde that he was borne bodily. And that is proved herewith / for as much
as the very law of God / which of right should have help / if any thing
could have help / not only came and brought no help with her / but also
increased sin / because that the evil and poisoned nature is offended and
utterly displeased with thelawe / and the more she is forbed by the law / the
more is she provoked and set a fire to fulfill and satisfy her lusts. By the
law then we se clearly that we must needs have Christ to justify us with
his grace / and to help nature.

In the.vj. he sets forth the chief and principal The.vj. Chapter.
work of faith / the battle of the sprite against the flesh / how the
sprite labors and enforseth to kill the remenaunte of sin and lust which
remain in the flesh / after our iustifyinge. And this chapter teaches us /
that we are not so frefro^ sin through faith / that we should henceforth goo
up and down idle carlesse and sure of our selves / as though there Baptyme is
a witness between god and us that we have promised to mortify the lusts and
sin that remains in the flesh. etc.
were now no more sin in us. yes there is sin remayninge in us / but it is
not rekened / because of faith and of the sprite / which fight against it.
Wherefore we have enough to do all our syues long / to tame our bodies / and
to compel the members to obey the sprite and not the appetites / that thereby
we might be like unto Christ's deeth and resurrection / and might fulfill
our baptyme / which signifies the mortifiynge of sins / and the new life
of grace. For this battle cease not in us until the last breath / and
until that sin be utterly slain by the deeth of the body.

This thing (I mean to tame the body and so forth) we are able to do (says
he) seeing we are under grace and not under the law / what it is / not to be
under the law / he him self expo^^ death. For not to be under the law is not
so to be understand / that every man may do what him Not to be under the law
what it means
lusts. But not to be under the law / is to have a fre heart renewed with
the sprite / so that thou haste lust inwardly of thine own accord to do that
which the law commands / with out co^pulcion / ye though there were no
law. For grace* that is to say Goddis favor brings us the sprite / and
makes us love the law / so us there now no moare sin / nether is the law
now any moare against us / but at one and agreed with us and we with it.

But to be under the law / is to deal with To be under the law what it is.
the works of the law / and to work without the sprite and grace: for so
long no doubt sin ^ayneth in us through the law / that is to say / the
law declares that we are under sin and and that sin has power and
dominion over us / seeing we cannot fulfill the law / namely with in in the
heart / for as much as no man of nature favors the law / consents there
unto and desyteth therein. Which thing is exceadinge great sin / that we
cannot consent to the law which law is nothi^ge else save the will of god.

This is the right fredome and liberte from sin and from the law where of
hewryteth unto the end of this Chapter / that it is a fredome to do good only
with lust / and to live well with out compulcio^ of the law. Wherefore this
fredome is a spiritual fredome / which destroys not the law / but
ministers that which the law requires / and where with the law is fulfilled
that is to understand / lust and love / where with the law is stilled and
accuses us no moare / compels us no moare* nether has ought to crave of
us any moare. Even as though thou were in debt to an other man / and were not
able to pay / two manner ways might thou be losed. One way / if he would
require nothing of the / and break thine obligacio^. An other way / if so me
other good man would pay for the / and give the as much as thou might
satisfy thine obligacio^ with all. Of this wise has Christ made us frefro^
the law: and therefore is this no will* de flesshely liberte / that should do
naught / but that does all things / and is fre from the crauinge and debt of
the law.

In the.vij. he confirms the same with a similitude The.vij. Chapter.
of the state of matrimony. As when the husbonde dies the wife is at her
liberte / and the one lowsed and departed from the other / not that the woman
should not have power to marie unto an other man / but rather now first of all
is she fre and has power to marie unto an other man which she could not do
before / till she was lowsed from her first husbond. Even so are our
consciences bound and in danger to the law under old Adam the flesh / as
long as he lives in us. For the law declares that our hertes are bound
and that we cannot disconsent from him. But when he is mortified and killed by
the sprite / then is the conscience fre and at liberte: not so that the
conscience shall now naught do / but now first of all eleuyth unto an other /
that is to wot Christ / and brings forth the fruits of life. So now to To
be under the law. To belowse from the law.
be under the law / is not to be able to fulfill the law / but to be detter
to it and not able to pay that which the law requires. And to belowse from
the law / is to fulfill it and to pay that which the law demands / so
that it can now henceforth axe the naught.

Consequently Paul declares more largely the nature of sin and of the law /
how that tho row the law sin reuyueth / moves hyrselfe / and gadereth
stre^ght. For the old man and c^rrupte nature / the moare he is forboden and
kept under of the law / is the moare offended and displeased there with / for
as much as he cannot pay that which is required of the law. For sin is his
nature and of him self / he cannot but sin. Therefore is the law deeth to
him / tormente and marterdome. Not that the law is evil / but because that
the evil nature cannot soffre that which is good / cannot abide that the law
should require of him any good thing. Like as a sick man cannot suffer that a
man should desire of him to run / to lepe and to do other deeds of an
wholeman.

For which cause saint Paul concludes that where the law is understand and
perceived of the best wise / there it does no moare but utter sin / and
bring us unto the knowledge of our selves / and thereby kylle us and make us
bond unto eternal damnacion ^detters of the everlasting wrath of God / eue^
as he well fealeth and understands whose conscience is truly touched of the
law. In such danger were we yer the law came / that we knew not what sin
me^te / nether yet know we the wrath of God apo^ sinners / till the law had
uttered it. So see thou that a man must have some other thing / ye and a
gretter and a moare mighty thing then the law / to make him righteous and
safe. They that understood not the law on this wise / are blind and goo to
work presumptuously / supposinge to satisfy the law with works. For they
know not that the law requires a fre / a willinge / a lusty and a louinge
heart. Therefore they se not Moses right in the face / the vay^e hangs between
and hydeth his face so that they can not behold the glory of his co^tena^ce /
how that the law is spiritual and requires the heart. I may of mine own
strength refrain that I boo mine enimye no hurt / but to love him with all
mine heart / and to put away wrath clean out of my mind can I not of mine
own strength. I may refuse money of mine own strength / but to put away
love unto riches out of mine heart can I not do of mine own strength. To
abstain from adultery as concerning the vttewarde deed can I do of mine own
strength / but not to desire in mine heart is as impossible unto me as is to
chose whether I will ho^gyr or thrust / and yet so the law requires. Wherefore
of a man's own strength is the law never fulfilled / we must have thereunto
goddis favor and his sprite / purchased by Christ's blood.

Nevertheless when I say a man may do many things vttewardly clean against
his heart / we must understand that man is but dreuen of diverse appetites /
and the greatest appetite overcomes the less and caryeth the man away
violently with her.

As when I desire vengeance / and fear also the inconvenience that is like to
follow if fear be greatter / I abstayner if the appetite that desires
vengeance be gretter / I cannot but prosecute the deed / as we se by
experience in many murtherars and thieves / which though they be brought in to
never so great perell of deeth / yet after they have escaped / do even / the
same again. And common women prosecute their lusts because fear and shame
are away / when other which have the same appetites in their hertes / abstain
at the leest way vtwardly or work secretly being overcome of fear and of
shame and so likewise is it of all other appetites.

Further moare he declares / how the sprite and Flesh and spirit fight to
ge gether.
the flesh fight to gether in one man / and makes an ensample of him self
/ that we might learn to know that work a right / I mean to kill sin in
our selves. He calls both the sprite and also the flesh a law / because
that like as the nature of Goddis law is to drive / to compel / and to crave
even so the flesh dryueth / compels / craves and rages / against the
sprite / and will have her lusts satisfied. On the other side dryueth the
sprite / cries and fights against the flesh / and will have his lust
satisfied. And this strife dureth in us / as long as we live: in some moare
and in some self as the sprite or the flesh is stronger and the very man his
own self is both the sprite and the flesh / which fights with his own
self until sin be utterly slain and he all together spiritual.

In the.viij. Chapter he comforts such fighters The. viij Chapter.
that they dispere not because of such flesh / other think that they are
less in favor with God. And he shows how that the sin remayninge in us /
hurts not / for there is no danger to them that are in Christ which walk
not after the flesh / but fight against it. And he expounds more largely
what the nature of the flesh and of the sprite is / and how the sprite
comes by Christ / which sprite makes us spiritual / tameth / subdueth and
mortifieth the flesh / and certifieth us that we are nevertheless the sons
of God and also beloved though that sin rage never so much in us / so long
as we follow the sprite and fight against sin to kill and mortife it. And
because the chastysinge of the cross and sufferinge are nothing pleasant / he
comfort us in our passions and affliccions by the assistens of the sprite
which makes intercession to God for us / mightily with groninges that pass
man's vtterau^ce / so that man's speech cannot comprehend them / and the
creatures morn also with us of great desire that they have / that we were
lowsed from sin and corrupcio^ of the flesh. So se we that these three
Chapters / the.vj. vij. viij. do none other thing so much as to drive us
unto the right work of faith / which is to kill the old man and mortify the
flesh.

In the.ix. x. and.xj. Chapters he treats of The.ix. x. and. xj chapters.
Goddis predestinacion / whence it springs all together / whether we shall
believe or not believe / be lowsed from sin or not be lowsed. By which
predestinacio^ our iustifiynge and salvation are clean taken out of our
hands / and put in the hands of God only / which thing is most necessary of
all. For we are so weke and so uncertain / that if it stood in us / there
would of a truth no man be saved / the deuell no doubt would deceive us. But
now is God sure that his predestinacio^ cannot deceive him / nether can any man
withstand or set him and therefore have we hope and trust against sin.

But here must a mark be set unto those un quiet / busye and hye clyming
sprites how far they shall goo / which first of all bring hither there hye
reasons and pregna^t wits / and begin first from an hye to search the
botomlesse secrets of Goddis predestinacio^ / whether they be predestinat or
not. These must needs either cast the^ selves down hedelong in to desperacio^
or else commit them selves to fre chance careless. But follow thou the order
of this pistle / and noosell thy This do if thou will understand
self with Christ / and learn to understand what the law and the gospel
mean / and the office of both two / that thou marst in the one know thy self
/ and how that thou have of thy self no strength / but to sin: and in the
other the grace of Christ. And then se thou fight against sin and the
flesh as the.vii. first chapters teach ye. After that when thou art come to
the.viii. chapter / and art under the cross and sufferinge of tribulacion /
the necessite of predestinacion will wax sweet and thou shall well feel how
precyouse a thing it is. For except thou have borne y^ cross of aduersite
and temptacio^ / and have felt thy self brought unto the very brymme of
desperacion / ye and unto hell go tes / thou can never meddle with the
sentence of predestinacion without thine own harm / and without secret wrath
and grudginge inwardly against God / for otherwise it shall not be possible for
the to think that God is righteous and just. Therefore must Adam* be well
mortified and the flesshely wit brought utterly to naught / yer that thou
may away with this thing / and drink so strong wine. Take heed therefore
unto thy self / that thou drink not wine / while thou art yet but asucklinge.
For every lerninge has her time / measure and age / and in Christ is there
acertayne childhod / in which a man must be content with milk for a ceason /
until he wax strong and grow up unto a perfect man in Christ / and be able
to eat of moare strong meat.

In the.xij. Chapter he gives exhortacio^s. The.xij. Chapter
For this manner observes Paul in all his pistles / first he teaches Christ
and the faith / then exhorts he to good works / and unto continual
mortifyinge of the flesh. So here teaches he good works in dead / and the
true seruinge of God / and makes all men Prestes / to offer up not money and
beasts / as the manner was in the time of the law / but their own bodies /
with killinge and mortifyinge of the lusts of the flesh. After that he
describes the outward conversation of Christen men / how they ought to
behave the^ selves in sprituall things how to teach / preach and rule in the
congregation of Christ / to serve one another to suffer all things patiently /
and to commit the wreke and vengeance to God / in conclusion how a Christen
man ought to behave him self unto all men / to friend / foo or whatsoever he
be. These are the right works of a Christen man which spring out of faith.
For faith keeps not holy day nether suffers any man to be idle /
whersoeuer she dwells.

In the.xiij. he teaches to honor the wordly The. xiij Chapter.
and te^porall sword. For though that ma^s law and ordinance make not a man
good before God / nether justify him in the heart / yet are they ordained for
the furderaunce of the common wealth / to mayntene peace / to punisshe the
evil and to ^efende the good. Therefore ought the good to honor the temporal
sword and to have it in reverence / though as concerning themselves they need
it not / but would abstain from evil of their own accord / ye and do good
without man's law / but by the law of the sprite which governs the heart /
and gydeth Love is the fulfill ^^^^^e of the law.
it unto all that is the will of God. Finally he co^prehendeth and knetteth up
all in love. Love of her own nature bestows all that she has and eue^ her
own sense on that which is loved. Thou neadest not to bid a kind mother to be
louinge unto her only son. Much less spiritual love. Which has eyes given
her of God / neadeth man's law to teach her to do her duty. And as in the
beginning he did put forth Christ as the cause and auctor of our
rightewesnes and salvation / even so here sets he him forth as an ensample
to cou^terfayte that as he has done to us / even so should we do one to
another.

In the.xiiij. Chapter he teaches to deal so berly with the consciences of
the weke in the faith / which yet understand not the liberty of The. xiiij
Chapter.
Christ perfectly enough and to fauer them of Christen love / and not to use
the liberte of the faith unto hinderau^ce. But unto the furderau^ce and
edifyinge of the weak. For where such co^sideracion is not / there follows
debate and despisinge of the Gospel. It is better therefore to forbere the weke
a while / until they wax strong / then that the learning of the Gospel
should come all to geder underfoot. And such work is singular work of love /
and where love is perfect / there must needs be such a respect unto the
weak / a thing that Christ commanded and charged to be had above all things.

In the.xv. Chapter he sets forth Christ The.xv. Chapter.
again to be followed / that we also by his ensample* / should suffer other
that are yet weak / as them that are frail / open sinners / unlearned /
vnexperte / and of lothesome manners / and not to cast the^ away forthwith /
but to suffer them till they wax better and exhort them in the mean time. For
so dealte christ in the gospel and now deals with us daily / soffering our
vnperfetnes / wekenes / conversation and manners / not yet fassioned after the
doctrine of the Gospel / but smell of the flesh / ye and sometime break
forth in to outward deeds.

After that to conclude with all he wyssheth them encreace of faith / peace /
and joy of conscience / pray seth them and commits the^ to god and
magnifieth his office and administracion in the gospel / and so berly and with
great discrecion desires succur and aid of them for the poor saynctes of
Jerusalem / and it is all pure love that he speaks or deals with all So
find we in this pistle plentuously / unto the vttmoste / whatsoever a Christen
man or woman ought to know that us to wete what the law / the Gospel / sin

things patiently / and to commit the wreke and vengeance to God / in

unto every man / be he perfect or a sinner / good or bad / strong or weke /

toward our selves also. And all things are profoundely grounded in the
scriptures / and declared with ensamples of himsilfe / of the fathers and of
the prophets / that a man can here desire no moare.

Wherefore it appears evidently / that Paul's This pistle to the Romans is the

mind was to comprehend breuely in this pistle all the hole learning of
Christ's Gospel / and to prepare an introduccion unto all the old testament.
For without doubt whosoever has this Pistle perfectly in his heart / the same
has the light and the effect of the old testamente with him. Wherefore let
every man with out excepcyon exercise him self therein dilige^ly / and record
it night and day continually / until he be full acquaynted therewith.

The last Chapter.
The last chapter is a chapter of recommendacyon / Wherein he yet myngleth a good
monycyon / that we should beware of the tradicyons and doctrine of men which
begyle the simple with sophistry and learning that is not after the gospel /
and draw the^ from Christ / and no sell the in weke and feeble and (as Paul
calls the^ in the pistle to the Galathyans) in bedgerly cerimonyes for the
intent that they would live in fat pastures and be in auctoryte / and be
taken as Christ / ye and above christ / and sit in the temple of god / that is
to wit in the consciences of men / where God only / his word / and his christ
ought to sit. Compare therefore all manner doctrine of men unto the scripture
and se whether they agree or not. And commit thy silfe whole and all to gether
unto Christ / and so shall he with his holy sprite and with all his fulness
dwell in thy soul.

The sum and hole cause of the wrytinge of this epistle / is / to prove that
a man is justifies by says only: which proposicion whosoever denies / to him is
not only this epistle and all that Paul writes / but also the hole scripture
so locked up / that he shall neu^^ understand it to his souls health. And to
bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only iusti fieth:
Paul proueh that the hole nature of m^ is so poisoned and so corrupt / ye and
so deed concerning Godly lyuinge or Godly thinkinge / that it is impossible
for her to keep the law in the sight of God: that is to say / to love it /
and of love and lust to do it as naturally as a man eats or drinks / until
she be quyckened again and healed through faith.

And by iustifyinge / understand none other thing then to be reconciled to
God and to be restored unto his favor / and to have thy sins forgiven the.
As when I say God justifies us / understood thereby / that God for Christ's
sake / merits and deseruinges only receaueth us unto his mercy / favor and
grace / and forgeueth us our sins. And when I say Christ justifies us /
understand thereby that Christ only has redeemed us / bought and delivered us
out of the wrath of God and damnacion / and has with his works only /
purchased us the mercy the favor and grace of God / and the forgeuenes of
our sins. And when I say that faith only justifies / understand thereby
that faith and trust in the truth of God and in the mercy promised us for
Christ's sake / and for his deserving and works only / does quiet the
conscience and certify her that our sins be forgeuen and we in the full
favor of God.

Furthermore / set before thine eyes Christ's works and thine own works.
Christ's works only iustifiethe and make satisfaccion for thy sin / and
thine own works not: that is to say / queyeteth thy conscience and make the
sure that thy sins are forgeuen the / and not thine own works. For the
promise of mercy is made the for Christ's works sake / and not for thine own
works sake. Wherefore saying God has not promised that thine own works shall
save the / therefore faith in thine own works can never quiet thy conscience
ner certify the before God (When god comes to judge and to take a
reco^nynge) that thy sins are for given the. Beyond all this / mine own
works can never satisfy the law or pay her that I owe her. For I owe the
law to love her with all mine heart / soul / power and might. Which thing to
pay I am never able while I am co^pased with flesh. No / I cannot once
begin to love the law / except I be first sure by faith that God loves me
and forgeueth me.

Finally that we say faith only iustifyeth / ought to offend no man. For if
this be true / that Christ only redeemed us / Christ only bare our sins /
made satisfaccion for them and purchased us the favor of God / then must it
needs be true / that the trust only in Christ's deserving and in the promises
of God the father made us for Christ's sake / does only quiet the conscience
and certify her that the sins are forgeuen. And when they say / a man must
repent / for sake sin / and have a purpose to sin no more as nyeas he can
and love the law of God: Ergo faith alone justifies not. I answer / that and
all like arguments are naught / and like to this. I must repent and be^orie /
the Gospel must be preached me / and I must believe it or else I cannot be
partaker of the mercy which Christ has deserved for me / Ergo Christ only
justifies me not* or Christ only has not made satisfaccion for my sins. As
this is a naughty argument so is the other.

Now go to reader / and according to the order of Paul's wrytinge / even so do
thou. First behold thy self dyligentlye in the law of God / and se there thy
just damnacion. Seconda rely turn thine eyes to Christ / and se there y^
exceadinge mercy of thy most kind and louinge father. Thirdly remember that
Christ made not this atonement that thou should anger God again: nether dyed
he for thy sins / that thou should live still in them: nether cleansed he
the / that thou should return (as a swyne) unto thine old podell again:
but that thou shuldes^ be a new creature and live a new life after the will of
God and not of the flesh. And bediligent least through thine own necgligence
and un thankfulness thou lose this favor and mercy again.

Farewell. W. T.

To him that works / is the reward not reckened of favor: but of duty. To
him that works not / but beleveth on him that justifies the ungodly / is his
faith counted for rightewesnes. Even as David describes the blessedfulnes of

rihgtewesnes without deeds. Blessed fullnes what it is
Blessed are they / whose vnrightewesnes are forgeven / and whose sins are
covered. Blessed is that man to whom the Lord imputes not sin.

Came this blessedness then upon the circumcised or upon the uncircumcised? We
say verily how that faith was rekened to Abraham for rightewesnes. How was it
rekened? in the time of circumcision? or in the time before he was circumcised?
Not in time of circumcision: but when he was yet uncircumcised. And he received
the sign of circumcision / as Circumcision is the seal.
a seal of y^ rightewesnes which is by faith / which faith he had yet being
uncircumcised: that he should be the father of all them that beleve / though
they be not circumcised / that rightewesnes might be imputed to them also: of
that faith yt was in our father Abraham before the time of circumcision.

For the promise that he should be the heir of the world / was not geven to
Abraham or to his seed through the law: but through y^ rightewesnes The promise

which comes of faith. For if they which are of the law / be heirs / then is
faith but vain / and the promise of none effect. Because the law causes
wrath* For where no law is / there is no tra^sgression. Therefore by faith is
the inheritance geven / that it might come of faveour: and the promise might be
sure to all the seed. Not to them only which are of the law: but also to them
which are of the faith of Abraham / which is the father of us all. As it is
written: I have made the a father to many nations / even before god whom genesis
xvii.
thou have beleved / which quyckeneth the deed / and called those things which
be not / as though they were.

Which Abraham / contrary to hope / beleved in hope / that he should be the
father of many nations / according to that which was spoken: So shall thy seed
be. And he faynted not in the faith / nor yet considered his own body which

he had promised that he was able to make good. And therefore was it reckened to
him for rightewesnes.

It is not written for him only / that it was reckened to him for rightewesnes:
but also for us / to whom it shall be counted for rightewesnes / so we beleve on

The.v. Chapter. Faith sets us at peace with God.

BEcause therefore that we are justified by faith / we are at peace with god
through our Lord Jesus Christ: by who^ we have away in through faith / unto
this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the praise that shall be geven
of God. Nether do we so only: but also we rejoice in tribulacion. For we know
that tribulacion brings Iaco. j. b.

For when we were yet weak / according to y^ time: Christ dyed for us which
were ungodly. Yet scace will any man dye for a rightewes man. Paraventure for a

For if when we were enemies / we were reconciled to God by the deeth of his
son: much more / saying we are reconciled / we shall be preservid by his life.
Not only so / but we also joy in God by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ
/ by whom we have receavyd the attonment.

Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world / and deeth by the means
of sin. And so deeth went over all men / in somoche that all men sinned. For
even unto the time of the law was sin in the world: but sin was not
regarded / as long as there was no law: nevertheless deeth rayned from Adam
to Moses / eve^ over them also that sinned not / with like transgression as did
Adam: which is y^ similitude of him that is to come.

But the gift is not like as the sin. For if through the sin of one / many
be deed: much Adams disobedye^ce dampened us all yer we our selves wrought
evil. And Christ's obedience saves us all / yer we our selves work any
good.
more plenteous upon many was the grace of God and gift by grace: which grace
was geven by one man Jesus Christ.

And y^ gift is not over one sin / as deeth came through one sin of one y^
sinned. For damnacion came of one sin unto condemnacion: but the gift came to
justify from many sins. For if by the sin of one / deeth reigned by the
means of one / much more shall they which receave abundance of grace and of
the gift of rightewesnes raygne in life by the means of one (that is to say)
Jesus Christ.

Likewise then as by the sin of one / condemnacion brings life / upon all
men. For as by one man's disobedience many be came sinners: so by y^ obedience
of one shall many be made righteous.

But y^ the law increases sin ^ makes our nature more gredie to do evil*

where abundance of sin was / there was more plenteousnes of grace. That as

ye also / that ye are deed concerning sin: but are alive unto God through

/ that ye should thereunto obey in the lusts of it. Nether geve ye your members

as they that are alive from deeth. And geve your members as iustrume^tes of
rightewesnes unto God. Let not sin have power over you. For ye are not under
the law / but under grace.

What then? Shall we sin / because we are not under the law: but under
grace? God forbid. Remember ye not how yt to whom lo. viij. d. ij. pe. ij. d.

ye have yet obeyed with heart unto the form of doctrine where unto ye were
delyvered. Year then made fre from sin / and are be come the servauntes of

I will speak grossly because of the infirmity ye were the servauntes of
sin / ye were not under rightewesnes. What fruit had ye then in tho things /
where of ye are now ashamed. For the end of tho things is deeth. But now are
ye delivered from sin / and made the servauntes of God / and have your fruit

of sin is deeth: but Eternal life is the seruinge of Christ

Even so ye my brethren / are deed concerning the law by the body of Christ /
yt ye should be coupled to another (I mean to him that is risen again from

The Prologe upon the first epistle of S. Paul to the Corinthyans.
THis pistle declares it self from Chapter to Chapter / that it ne death no
Prologe or introduccio^ to declare it. When Paul had converted a great nombre
at Corinthum / as ye read Act. xviij. and was departed / there came
immediatlye false Apostles and sect makers and drue every man disciples after
him / so that the people were whole vnquyeted / divided and at varyaunce among
them selves / every man for the zele of his doctoure / those new Apostles not
regarding what deuysion / what uncleanness ^^ lyuinge / or what false opinions
were among the people / as long as they might be in auctorite and well at
ease in their bellies. But Paul in the.iiij. first Chapters with great wisdom
and sobre^es / rebukes / first the deuysyon and the auctores thereof / and
calls the people to Christ again and teaches how and for what the preacher
is to be taken.

In the.v. he rebukes the uncleanness that was amongst them.

In the.vj. he rebukes the debate and going to law to gether / pleatynge
their causes before the hethen.

In the.vij. he informs them concerning chastity and marriage.

In the.viij. ix. x. and.xj. he teaches the strong to forbear the weak that
yet understood not the liberty of the Gospel / and that with the ensample of
him self. Which though he were an Apostle and had auctoryte / yet of love he
abstayned / to win other. And he fears them with the ensamples of the old
testament and rebukes diverse dysorders that were among them concerning the
Sacrament and the goyn^e bare hedded of married women.

In the.xij. xiij. and.xiiij. he teaches of the many fold gifts of the
spirit / and proves by a symylitude of the body / that all gifts are given
that each should help other / and through love do service to other / and proves
that where love is not / there is nothing that pleases God. For that one
should love another / is all that God requires of us. And therefore if we desyer
spiritual gifts he teaches those gifts to be desired that help our
neyboures

In the.xv. he teaches of the resurreccyon of the body.

Unto the congregation of God which is at Corinthum. To them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus / saints by calling / with all that call on the
name of our lord Jesus Christ in every place / both of theirs and of ours

Grace be with you and peace from God our father / and from the lord Jesus
Christ.

I thank my God all ways on your behalf for ye grace of God which is given
you by Jesus Christ / that in all things ve are made rich by him in all

I beseech you brethren in ye name of our lord Jesus Christ / that ye all
speak one thing and that there be no dissencion among you: but be ye knyt
together in one mind and in one mea^ynge. It is showed unto me (my brethren)
of you by them that are of the housse of Cloe / that there is strife among you.
And this is it that I mean: how that come^lie among you / one says: I hold
of Paul: another I hold of Apollo: ye third I hold of Cephas: y^ four ye I
hold of Christ. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? either were ye
baptized in yt name of Paul? I thank God that I christened none of you / but
Crispus and Gayus / lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
I baptized also the housse of Stephana. Forthermore know I not whether I
baptized any man or no.

For Christ sent me not to baptyse / but to Preachinge of the crosseis y^ power

them yt perisshe folishnes: but unto to us which are saved / it is ye power of

For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise / and will cast
away the understanding of the prudent. Where is the syse? Where is the
scrybe? Where is the searcher of this world? Has not God made the wisdom of
this world folisshnes?

For when the world through wisdom knew not God / in ye wisdom of God: it
pleased God through folisshnes of preachinge to save them yt beleve. For ye
Jews require a sign / and the Greeks seek after wisdom. But Sign.

unto the Greeks folisshnes: but unto the^ which are called both Christ is the

the folishnes of God is wyser then me^: and the weakness of God is stronger
then men.

Brethren look on your calling / how that not many wise men after the flesh
/ not many mighty / not many of hye degree are called: but God has chosen the
folysshe things of the world / to confound the wise. And God has chosyn the
weak things of the world / to confound things which are mighty. And vile
things of the world / and things which are despised / has God chosen / ye
and things of no reputacion / for to bring to naught things of reputacion /

I wrote unto you in a pistle that ye should not company with fornicatours. And
I mea^t not at all of the fornicatours of this world / either of the covet^ous
/ or of extorsioners / have gone out of ye world. But now I write unto you /
that ye company not togedder / if any that is called a brother / be a
fornicator / or coveteous / or a worshipper of images / either a raylar / either
a dronkard / or an extorcionar: with him that is soche se that ye eat not. For
what have I to do / to judge them which are with out? Do ye not judge them that

AS concerning the things whereof ye Of wedlock and vyrgynite

The wife has not power over her own body: but the husband. And likewise the
man has not power over his own body: but the wife. Withdraw not your selves
one from another / except it be with consent for a time / for to geve your

lest Satan tempt you for your incontinencye.

This I say of faveour / not of commandment.

Unto the married command not I / but the mat. v. c ^. ix. b
Lord: that the wife separate not her self from the man. If she separate her
self / let mar. x. v lu. x vj. d

To the remnaunt speak I / and not the lord.

For he that is called in the lord being a servaunt / is the lords freman.
Lykwyse he that is called being fre / is Christ's servau^t. Ye are dearly

seek not to be lowsed. Art thou lowsed from a wife? seek not a wife. But and
if thou take a wife thou synnest not. Lykwyse if a virgin mary / she synneth
not. Nevertheless soche shall have trouble in their flesh: but I faver you.

This say I brethren the time is short. It remains that they which have
wives / be as though they had none / and. they that weep be as though thy wept
not: and they that rejoice / be as though they reioysed not: and they that bye
be as though they possessed not: and they ye use this world / be as though
they used it not. For the fassion of this world goes away.

I would have you without care: the single But she that is married / cares for
the things of the world / how she may please her husband. This speak I for

To another the interpretacion of to^ges. And these all works eve^ ye silfe

For as the body is one / and has many me^bres / and all the members of one
body though they be many / yet are but one body: even so is

But now has god disposed the members every one of them in the body / at his
own pleasure. If they were all one member: where were the body? Now are there
many members / yet but one body. And the eye can not say un to the hand / I
have no need of the: nor ye heed also to the fete. I have no need of you. Ye
geven most honor to that part which laked / lest there should be any strife
in the body: but that the members should indifferently care one for another. And
if one member suffer / all suffer with him: if one member be had in honor /
all members be glad also.

Ye are the body of Christ / and members one of another. And God has also
ordained in the congregation / first the Apostels / seco^darely ephe. iiij.

except ye speak words that have signification / how shall yt be understand

Many kinds of voices are in the world

Wherefore let him that speaks with tongues / pray that he may interpret
also. If I pray with tongue / my sprete prays: but my mind is with out
fruit. What is it then? I will pray with the sprete / and will pray with the
mind also. I will singe with the sprete / and will singe with the mind also.

For else when thou blessest with ye to speak with tongues or with the spirit /
is to speak that other understand not / as prestes say their service. To

has his doctrine / has his tongue / has his revelacio^ / has his

tongues / let it be two atonce or at the most three atonce and that by course:
and let another interpret it. But if there be no interpreter / let him keep
silence in the congregation / and let him speak to him self and to God.

Let the Prophet speak two atonce / or three

they are the commandments of the Lord. But and if any man be ignorant / let
him beignorant. Wherefore brethren covet to prophesye / and forbid not to speak
with tongues. And let all things be done honestly and in order.

The.xv. Chapter.
BRethren as pertayninge to the gospel continue / by which also ye are saved:
I do you to wit / after what manner I preached unto you if ye keep it / except
ye have beleved in vain.

many are fallen a sleep. After that appeared he to James / then to all the
Apostles.

And last of all he was seen of me / as of one that was borne out of due time.
For I am the lest of all the Apostles / which am not worthy to be called an
Apostle / because I persecuted the congregation of God. But by the grace of God
I am that I am. And his grace which is in me / was not in vain: but I labored

If Christ be preached how that he rose from deeth: how say some that are
among you / Resurreccion.
that there is no resurreccion from deeth? If there be no rysynge again from
deeth: then is Christ not risen. If Christ be not risen / then is our
preachinge vain / and your faith is also in vain. Ye and we are found falce
witnesses of God. For we have testified of God / how that he raysyd up Christ /
whom he raysyd not up / if it be so that the deed rise not up again. For if
the deed rise not again / then is Christ not risen again. If it beso ye
Christ rose not / then is your faith in vain and yet are ye in your sins.
And thereto they which are fallen a slepein Christ / are perisshed. If in this
life only we beleve on christ / then are we of all men the miserablest.

But now is Christ risen from deeth / and is First fruits.
be come the first fruits of them that slept. For by a man came deeth / and by
a man came resurreccion apoca. j. b
from deeth. For as by Adam alldye: eve^ so by Christ / shall all be made alive
/ and j. thessa. iiij. b.
every man in his own order. The first is Christ / then they y^ are Christis
at his coming. Then comes the end / when he has delivered up ye kingdom
to God y^ father / when he has put down all rule / auctorite and power. For
he must raygne till he have put psalm. c. ix. a. hebre. j. d. and.x. c. psalm.

all his enemies under his fete.

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is deeth. For he has put all things
under his fete. But when he says / all things are put under him / it is many
fest that he is excepted / which did put all things under him. When all
things are subdued unto him: then shall the son also him self be subject
unto him that put all things under him / y^ God may be all in all things.

Either else what do they which are baptized over ye deed / if the deed rise not
at all? Why are they then baptized over the deed? Ye and why stand we in
ieoperdy every hour? By our reioysinge which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord
/ I dye daily. That I have fought esa. xxij.

But some man will say: how arise ye deed? with what bodies come they in? Thou
fool / that which thou sowest / is not quickened except it dye. And what sowest
thou? Thou sowest not that body that shall be: but bare corn (I mean either of
wheet / or of some other) and God geveth it a body at his pleasure / to every
seed a several body.

All flesh is not one manner of flesh: but their is one manner flesh of
men / another manner flesh of beasts / another manner flesh of fysshes / and
another of birds. There are celestial bodies / and there are
bodyesterrestriall. But ye glory of ye celestial is one / and ye glory of the
terrestrial is another. There is one manner body / and ryseth a spretuall body.

There is a natural body and there is a spretuall body: as it is written: the
first man Adam was made a livinge soul: and ye last ^o^ was made a
quickeninge sprete. How beit yt gene. ij. b.
is not first which is spiritual: but yt which is natural / and then yt which
is spretuall. The first man is of the earth / erthy: the second man is y^ Lord
from heaven. As is the erthy / soche are they that are erthye. And as is the
heve^ly / soche are they yt are hevenly. And as we Image of Christ
have borne the image of the erthy / so shall we bear the image of the hevenly.

This say I brethren / that flesh and blood cannot inheret the kingdom of
God. Nether corrupcion inhereth vncorrupcion. Behold Corruptible flesh and
blood can not etc.
I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep: but we shall all be changed /
and that in a moment / and in the twinclinge of an eye / at the sound of the
last trompe. For the trompe shall blow / and ye deed shall rise incorruptible
/ and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruptibilite:
and this mortal must put on immortalite.

When this corruptible has put on incorruptibilite / and this mortal has put
on immortalite: then shall be brought to pass y^ saying yt is written. Deeth is

If the ministracion of deeth through the letters figured in stones was glorious
/ so yt the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses for the

Seeing that we have soche promeses every side. Outward was fighting /

at the coming of Titus.

And not with his coming only: but also with the consolacion wherewith he was
comforted of you. For he told us your desire / your morning / your fervent
mind to me ward: so that I now rejoice the more* Wherefore though I made you
sorry with a letter / I repent not: though I did repent. For I perceave that ye
same pistle made you sorry / though it were but for a ceason. But I now rejoice
/ not that ye were sorry / but that ye so sorowed / that ye repented. For ye
sorowed godly: so ye in nothing ye were hurt by us. For godly j. pe. ij,
sorrow causes repentance unto salvacion not to be repented of: when worldly
sorrow causes deeth.

Behold what diligence this godly sorrow that ye took / has wrought in you:
ye it caused you to clear your selves. It caused indignacion / it caused
fear / yt caused desire / it caused a fervent mind / it caused punysshment.
For in all things ye have showed your selves that ye were clear in that
matter. Wherefore though I wrote unto you / I did it not for his cause that did
hurt / nether for his cause that was hurt: but that our good mind which we
have toward you in the sight of god / might appear unto you.

Therefore we are comforted / because ye are comforted: ye and excedyngly the
moare ioyed we / for the joy that Titus had: because his sprete was refresshed
of you all. I a^ therefore / not now a shamed / though I bosted mysyl^e to him of
you. For as all things which I preached unto you are true / even so is our
bostynge / that I bosted my silfe to Titus with all / found true. And now is his
inward affection more abundant toward you / when he remembers the obedience
of every one of you: how with fear and trymblynge ye received him. I rejoice
that I may be bold over you in all things.

For this we eschew / that any man should rebuke us in this plenteous

things / not in the sight of god only / but also in the sight of men.

We have sent with them a brother of ours whom we have often times proved
dilligent in many things / but now much more diligent. The great confidence
which I have in you. has caused me this to do: partly for Titus sake which is
my fellow and helper as concerning you / partly because of other which are
our brethren / and the messengers of the congregacio^s / and ye glory of
Christ. Wherefore show unto them the proffe of your love / and of the
reioysynge that we have of you / that ye congregacions may se it.

of Macedonia come with me and find you un prepared / the boost that I made in
this matter / should be a shame to us: I say not unto you.

Wherefore I thought it necessary to exhort eccle. xxxv.

God is able to make you rich in all grace that ye in all things havynge

For the office of this ministracion / not only ministrynge / thanks might be
geven to god of many / which praise god for the obedience of your professynge

The Prologe upon the epistle of S. Paul to the Galathyans.
AS ye read. Act. xv. how certain came from Jerusalem to Antioche and vexed the
disciples there / affirmynge that they could not be saved except they were
circumcised. Eue^ so after Paul had converted the Galathya^s and coupled them
to Christ / to trust in him only for the remission of sin / and hope of
grace and salvation / and was departed: there came false apostles unto the^ (as
unto the Corinthians / and unto all places where Paul had preached) and that
in the name of Peter / James and Ihon / whom they called the hie Apostles /
and preached circumcision and the kepinge of the law / to be saved by and
mynisshed paul's auctorite.

To the confoundynge of those / Paul magnifieth his office and Apostleshipe in
the two first chapters and makes him self equal unto the hye Apostles / and
concludes that every man must be justified with our deservings / with out
works / and with out help of the law: but alone by Christ.

And in the third and fourth / he proves y^ same with scripture / examples
and symylitudes / and shows that the law is cause of more sin and brings
the curse of god upon us / and justifies us not: but that iustifyinge comes
by grace promised us of God through the deserving of Christ / by whom (if we
believe) we are justified with out help of the works of the law.

And in the.v. and.vj. he exhorts unto the works of love which follow faith
and iustifyinge. So that in all his epistle he observes this order. First he
preaches the dampnacio^ of the law: then the iustifyinge of faith / and
thyrdly the works of love. For on that condycion that we love and work / is
the mercy given us.

had in tribulacion and persecucion continued therein sted fastlye / and were
become a^ ensample unto all congregacions / and had thereto sof fred of their

in mind / how purelye and godly he had lived among them to their ensample /
and thanketh God that his gospel had brought forthsoche fruit among them.

In the third Chapter / he shows his diligence and care / least his so great
labor and their so blessed a beginning should have been in vain / Satan and
his Apostles vexing them with persecucion / and destroyenge their faith with
me^nes doctrine. And therefore he sent Timothe to them to comfort them and
strength them in the faith / and thanketh God that they had so constantly
endured / and desired God to increase them.

In the fourth he exhorts them to keep them selves from sin / and to do
good one to another. And thereto he informs them concerning the resurreccion.

In the fyueth he writes of the last day / that it should come suddenly /
exhortinge to prepare them selves thereafter and to keep a good order
concerning obedience and rule.

we our selves have suffered of the Jews.

works equal with Christ and his Gospel. And he makes a short conclusion of
all Christen learning / whereto the law serves and what the end thereof is /
also what the gospel is / and sets him self for a comfortable ensample
unto all sinners and troubled consciences.

In the second he commands to pray for all degrees / and charge that the
women shall not preach ner were costlye apparel / but tobe obedyent unto the
men.

In the third he descrybeth ^ what manner persons the bysshope or priest and
their wives should be / and also the deacones and their wives: and commends it
/ if any man desyer to be a bysshope after that manner.

In the fourth he prophisieth and shows before of the false bysshopes and
spiritual officers that should arise among the christian people / and be / do

from the faith in Christ and forbid to mary and to eat certain meats /
teaching to put trust therein / both of iustifienge and forgeuenes of sins
and also of deserving of eternal life.

In the fyueth he teaches how a bysshope should use him self toward young
and old and concerning widows what is to be done / and which should be found
of the commen cost: and teaches also how men should honor the verteous
bysshopes and prestes / and how to rebuke the evil.

In the sixte he exhorts the Bisshope to cleave to the gospel of Christ and
true doctrine / and to avoid vain questions and superfluous disputynges which
gender strife and quench the truth / and by which also the false prophets
get them auctorite and seek to satisfy their insaciable covetousness.

The Prologe unto the pistle of S. Paul to Titus.
THis is a short pistle: wherein yet is contained all that is needful

In the first Chapter he shows what manner a man a bysshope or curat ought to
be: that is to wit / verteous and learned / to preach and defend the Gospel
/ and to confound the doctrine of trusting in works and men's tradicions
which ever fight against the faith and carye away the conscience captive from
the fredome that is in Christ into the bondage of their own ymaginacions and
inuencions / as though tho things should make ama^ good in the sight of God
which are to no proffyt at all.

In ^he second he teaches all degrees / old / young / men / women / masters
/ and servants how to behave the^ selves as they which Christ has bought
with his blood / to be his proper or peculyer people / to glorify God with
good works.

In the third he teaches to honor te^porall rulars and to obey them / and
yet brings to Christ again and to the grace that he has purchased for us /
that no man should think that the obedience of princes laws or any other
work should justify us before God. And last of all he charge to avoid the
company of the stobourne and of the heretics.

A Prologe to the first epistle of Saint Peter.


THis epistle did saint Peter write to the Hethen that we reconuerted and
exhorts the^ to stand fast in the faith / to grow therein and to wexe perfect
/ through all manner of sofferinge and also good works.

In the first he declares the iustyfyenge of faith through Christ's blood /
and comfort them with the hope of the life to come / and shows that we
have not deserved it / but that the Prophets prophisied it should be given us /
and as Christ which redeemed us out of sin and all uncleanness is holy / so he
exhorts to lead an holy conversation: and because we be rychlye bought and
made heirs of a rich in herytaunce / to take heed that we lose it not again
through our own necgligence.

In the second Chap. he shows that Christ is the foundation and head corner
stone whero^ all are bylr through faith / whether it be Jew or ge^tyle / and
how that in Christ they are made Prestes / to offer them selves to god (as
christ did him self) and to sle the lusts of the flesh that fight against
the soul. And first he teaches them in general to obey the worldly rulars
and then in special he teaches the servants to obey their masters be they
good or bad / and to soffre wrong of them as Christ soffered wrong for us.

In the third he teaches the wives to obey their husbands / ye though they
be unbelievers and to apparel them selves godly and as yt be comes h^ lines.
And thereto that the husbands soffre and bear the infirmite of their wives and
live according to knowledge with them. And then in general he exhorts them
to be soft / courteous / pacient and frendlye one to another / and to soffre
for ryghteousnes after the ensample of Christ.

In the fourth he exhorts to fle sin and to tame the flesh with sobrenes
watchinge and prayer / and to love each other / and to know that all good
gifts are of God and every man to help his neyboure with soche as he has
received of god / and finally not to wonder / but to rejoice though they must
soffre for christ's names sake saying as they be here partakers of his
affliccio^s / so shall they be partakers of his glory to come.

In the fyueth he teaches the bysshopes and prestes how they should live and
feed Christ's flock: and warns us of the deuell which on every side lies in
wait for us.

FOr as much as christ has suffered for We must be partakers with Christ in

not after ye lusts of men / but after the will of God. For it is sufficient
for us that we have spent the time that is past of the life / after the will of
the gentyls / walkinge in wantannes / lusts / dronkennes / in eatinge /
drinkinge and in abominable ydolatrie.

And it seems to them a strange thing (the deed) are the ignorant of God /
for they that bedeed from this world have no flesh.
that ye run not also with them unto the same excess of ryote / and therefore
speak they evil of you / which shall geve a co^ptes to him that is ready to
judge quycke and deed. For unto this purpose verily was ye gospel preached
unto the (deed) that they should be condemned of men in ye flesh / but should
live before God in the sprete. The end of all things is at hand.

Be ye therefore discrete and sober / y^ ye may be apt to prayers. But above
all things have ferve^t love among you. For love Hate makes sin of every
trifle: but love looks not on small thiges: but suffers all things
covers the multitude of sins. Be yeherberous one to another and that with
out grudginge. As every man has received the gift / minister the same one to
another as good ministers of the manyfolde grace of God. If any man speak /

Dearly beloved / be not troubled in this heat / which now is come among you

that when his glory appears / ye may be merry and glad.

If ye be rayled upon for the name of Christ happy are ye. For the sprete of
glory and the sprete of god rests upon you. On their part he is evyll spoken
of: but on your part he is glorified.

Se that none of you suffer as a murderer / or as a thief / or an evyll doar /
or as a busy body in other men's matters. If any man suffer as a Christian man /
let him not be ashamed: but let him glorify god on his behalf. For the time
is come that judgment must begin at the housse of god. If the sons of god
must be all scorged and none may be saved but through the same fire that Christ
went through: what shall the da^pnacio^ of the disobedyent and vnbeseuers be?
If it first begin at us / what shall the end be of them which beleve not
the gospel of god? And if the righteous scasly be saved: where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear? Wherefore let them that suffer according to the
will of god / commit their souls to him with well doing / as unto a faithful
creator

A Prologe to the second epistle of S. Peter.
THis pistle was written against the^ which thought that Christian faith might
be idle and with out works / when yet the promise of Christ is made us upon
that condition / that we henceforth work the will of God and not of the
flesh. Therefore he exhorts them to exercise them selves diligently in
virtue and all good works / thereby to be sure that they have the true faith /
as a man knows the goodness of a tree by his fruit. Then he commends and
magnifieth the gospel / and wills that men herke^ to that on^ye / and to
me^nes doctrine not at all. For as he says / there came no prophetical
scripture by the will of man / but by the will of the holy ghost which only
knows the will of God / nether is any^ scripture of private interpretacion:
that is to say / may be otherwise expounded the^ agreinge to the open places
and general articles and to the couenauntes of God and all the rest of the
scripture.

And therefore in the second he warns them of false teachers that should come
/ and through preachinge confidence in false works to satisfye their
courtousnes with all / should deny Christ. Which he threateneth with three
terrible exsamples*with the fall of the angels / the floude of No^ and
ouerthrowinge of ^odome and Gomor / and so describes them with their
insaciable covetousness / pride / slou borne and dysobedience to all remvorall
rule and auctoryte / with their abominable whordome and ypocre^ie that a blind
man may se that he prophisied it of the popes holy spirituality which
devoured the whole world with their coueteousnes lyuinge in all lust and
pleasure and rayninge as temporal tyrants.

In the third he shows that in the latter days / the people through
vnbeleffe and lack of fear of the judgment of the last day / shall be even as
Epicures / wholly given to the flesh. Which last day shall yet surely and
shortly come says he: for a thousand years and one day is with God all one.
And he shows also how terrible that day shall be / and how suddenly it shall
come and therefore exhorts all m^n to look earnestly for it / and to prepare
them selves against it with holy conversation and godly living.

Finally. The first Chapter shows how it should goo in the time of the pure
and true Gospel. The second how it should goo in the time of the pope and
men's doctrine. The third h^w at the last men should believe nothing n^r fear
God at all.

The second epistle of S. Peter.
The first Chapter.
SImon Peter a servant and

Grace with you* and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus
our Lord. According as his godly power has geven unto us all things that
pertayne unto life and godlynes / through the knowledge of him that has called
us by virtue and glory / by the means whereof / are geven unto us excellent
and most great promises / that by the help of them ye should be partakers of

patience godlynes / in godlynes brotherly kyndnes / in brotherly kyndnes love.
For if these things be among you and are plenteous / they will make you that
ye nether shall be idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord Jesus

Wherefore brethren / geve the moare diligence ^e that has soche works ma^e be

shall never e^re. Ye and by this means an entering in shall be ministered unto
you abundantly in to the everlastynge kingdom of our lord and saveoure
Jesus Christ.

Wherefore I will not be necgligent to put you always in remembrance of soche
things / though that ye know them your selves and be also stablisshed in the
present truth. Notwithsto^dinge I think yt mete (as long as I am in this

our lord ^oh. xxi
Jesus Christ has showed me. I will enfoarce therefore / that on every side ye
might have wherewith to stere up the remembrance of these things after my
departing.

For we followed not decevable fables when we openned unto you the power and
coming of our lord Jesus Christ / but with our eyes we saw his majesty:

prophesye in the scripture has any private interpretacio^. For the scripture
came ij. tim. iij.
never by the will of man: but holy men of god spoke as they were moved by the
holy ghost.

A Prologe upon the three epistles of S. John.
THis first epistle of saint John contains the doetryne of a very apostle of
Christ and ought of right to follow his Gospel. For as in his epistle he
sets out the true faith / and teaches by it only all me^ to be saved and
restored unto the favor of God again: eue^ so here in this pistle he goes
against them that boste them selves of faith and yet contynew without good
works and teaches many ways that where true faith is / there the works
tarry not behind / and contrary that where the works follow not / there is
no true faith but a false ymagynacion and utter darcknes.

And he writes sore against a certain sect of heretyekes which then began to
deny that Christ was come in the flesh / and calls the^ vetye
Antechristes. Which sect goes now in her full swing. For though they deny
not openly with the mouth that Christ is come in the flesh: yet they deny
it in y^ hartewith their doctrine and living. For he that wyllbe justified and
saved through his own works / the same does as much as he y^ denies Christ
to become in the flesh saying that Christ came only therefore in the flesh
/ that he should justify us / or purchase us pardon of our sins / bring us
into the favor of God agavne and make us heirs of eternal life / with his
works only and with his bloudeshedinge / without and before all our works.

So fyghteth this pistle both against them that will be saved by their own good
works / a also against them that will be saved by a faith that has no lust to
do works at all and keeps us in the myddie way / that we believe in Christ to
be saved by his works only / and then to know that it is our duty for that
kindness / to prepare our selves to do the co^maundme^t of god / and to love
every man his neyboure as Christ loved him / sekinge with our own works
Gods honor and our neybours welthe only / and trustinge for eternal life
and for all that God has promised us for Chrisles sake.

The two last pistles though they be short / yet are goodlye ensamples of love
and faith and do sauoure of the spirit of a true Apostle.

The first epistle of S. John the Apostle.
The first Chapter. John here as in his gospel / and as Paul and Peter in
their pistles / teaches first the iustifienge of faith and that all mercy

Brethren I write no new commandment unto you: but that old commandment
which ye heard from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which
ye heard from the beginning. Again a new commandment I write unto you / a
thing that is true in him / and also in you: for the darkness is past / and the
true light now shyneth. He that says how that he is in the light / and yet
hates his brother / is in darkness even until this time. He that loves his
brother / abides in the light and there is none occasion of evyll in him. He
that He that hates is in darcknes and knows not what Christ has done for
him: but he that loves is in light and woteth what Christ has done

that loves not his brother. Love is the first precept and cause of all other.


For this is the tydinges / that ye heard from the beginning / that we should
love one another: not as Cayn which was of the wicked and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evyst / and his

God / that ye may know how that ye have eternal life / and that ye may
beleve on the name of the son of god. And this is the trust that we have in
him: that if we axe any thing according to his will he hears us. And if we

THe Elder unto the beloven

Beloved / thou do faithfully what soever to receave soche / that we also
might be helpers to the truth.

I wrote unto the congregation: but Diotrephes which loves to have the
^reeminence among them / receaveth us not. Wherefore if I come / I will declare
his deeds which he does / iestinge on us with malicious words / nether is
therewith content. Not only he him silfe receaveth not the brethren: but also
he for bids them that would / and thrusts them out of the congregation.

Beloved / follow not that which is evyll / but that which is good. ^e that
does well is of God: but he y^ does evyll seith not God. Demetrius has good
report of all men / and of the truth: ye and we our selves also bear
record / and ye know that our record is true.

The Prologe to the episile of S. Paul to the Hebrews.
About this pistle has ever bee^ noche doutynge and that amo^te great learned
me^ who should be the auctor thereof: diverse affirminge that it was not Paul's
partlye because the style so disagreeth and is so vnlyk: his other epistles /
and parrlye because it stondeth in the second Chapter / this learning was
confyrmed to us ward: that is to say taught us by them that heard it them
selves of the Lord. Now Paul testifies Gala. j. that he received not his
gospel of man ner by man but ymmediatlye of Christ and that by reuelacion.
Wherefore say they / saying this man confesses that he received his doctrine
of the Apostles it cannot be Paul's / but some disciple of the Apostles. Now
whether it were Paul's or no I say not / but permytit to other men's
judgments / ne there think I it to be an article of any man's faith / but
that a man may doubt of the auctor.

Moreover / many there has been which not only have denied this pistle to
have been written by any of the Apostles / but have also refused yt altogether
as no catholic or godly pistle / because of certain textes written therein. For
first it says in the si^te: it is impossible that they which were once lyghted
/ and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were become partakers of the holy
ghost / and have tasted of the good word of God and of the power of the world
to come if they fall / should be renewed again to repentance or conversion.
And in the tenth it says / if we sin wyllynglye after we have received the
knowledge of the truth / there remarneth no more sacrifice for sins / but a
fearful lokynge for judgment and vyolent fire which shall destroy the
adversaries. And in the.xij. it says that Esau found no way to repentance
or co^uersyon ^no though he sought it with tears. Which textes say they /
sound that if a man syn ne any more after he is once baptized / he can be
no more forgeuen / and that is contrary to all the scripture / and therefore to
be refused to be catholyck and godly.

Unto which I answer: if we should deny this pistle for those textes sakes / so
should we deny first Matthew which in his.xij. chap. affirms that he which
blasphemeth the holy ghost / shall nether be forgiven here ner in y^ world to
come. And then Mark which in his.iij. chap. says that he that blasphemeth
the holy ghost / shall never have forgeuenes / but shall be in danger of
eternal da^nacio^. And thyrdly Luke which says there shall be no remission to
hi^ that blasphemeth the spirit of God. Moreover John in his.j. pistle says
there is a sin unto deeth / for which a man should not pray. And.ij. Petr.
ij. says: if a man be fled from the uncleanness of the world through the
knowledge of the sau your Jesus Christ / and then be wropt in again / his end
is worse then the begininge and that it had been better for him never to have
known the truth. And Paul ij. timo. iij. cursseth Alexander the copersinith /
desyringe the Lord to reward him according to his deeds. Which is a sign
that either the pistle should not be good / or that Alexander had sinned past
forgeuenes / no more to be prayed for. Wherefore saying no scripture is of
private inter pretacio^: but must be expounded according to the general
articles of our faith and agreeable to other open and evident textes / and
confirmed or compared to like sentences / why should we not vndersto^ee these
places with like reverence as we do the other / namely when all the remna^t of
the pistle is so godly and of so great learning.

The first place in the.vj. Chapter will no more then that they which know the
truth / and yet willinglye refuse the light / and chose rather to dwell in
darcknes / and refuse Christ and make a mock of him (as the Pharisees which
when they were overcome with scripture and miracles that Christ was the very
Messiah / yet had soche lust in iniquite that they for soke him / persecuted
him slew him and did all the shame that could be ymagined to him) cannot be
renewed (eis Me tano iam) says the Greek / to be converted: that is to say /
soche malycious unkindness which is none no^ her then the blaspheminge of the
holy ghoost / deserves that the spirit shall never come more at them to
convert the / which I believe to be as true as any other text in all the
scripture.

And what is meant by that place in the tenth chapter where he says / if we
sin willingly after we have received the knowledge of the truth / there
remains no more sacrifice for sin / is declared ymediatlye after. For he
makes a comparyson between Moses and Christ / saying: if he which despised
Moses law dyed without mercy how much worse punishment is he worthy of /
that treads the son of God under foot and counts the blood of the
covenant / by which blood he was sanctified / as an unholy thing and
blasphemeth the spirit of grace. By which words it is manifest that he
means none other by the fore words / then the sin of blasphemye of the
spirit.

For them that sin of ignorance or infirmity / there is reamedie / but for
him that knows the truth / and yet willinglye yeldeth himself to sin /
and consents unto the life of sin with soul and body / and had lever lie
in sin then have his poisoned nature healed by the help of the spirit of
grace / and malyciouslye persecuteth the truth: for him I say there is no
remeadye the way to mercy is locked up and the spirit is taken from him for
his unthankfulness sake no more to be given him. Truth it is if a man can
turn to God and believe in Christ / he must be forgiven how deep soever he
has sinned: but that will not be with out the spirit / and soche blasphemers
shall no more have the spirit offered them. Let every man therefore fear God
and beware that he yield not him self to serve sin / but how often soever he
sin let him begin again and fight afreshe / and no doubt he shall at the
last overcome / and in the meantyme yet be under mercy for Christ's sake
because his heart works and would feign belowsed from under the bondage of
fynne.

And that it says in the. xi^. Esau found no way (eis Metanono iam) to
beconuerted and reconciled unto God and restored unto his byrthright again /
though he sought it with tears / that text must have a spiritualleye. For Esau
in selling his byrthryght despised not only that te^porall promocion / that he
should have been lord over all his brethren and king of that country: but he
also refused the grace and mercy of God and the spiritual blessings of
Abraham and Isaac and all the mercy that is promised us in Christ which should
have been his seed. Of this ye se that this epistle ought no more to be refused
for holy / godly and catholic then the other autenticke scriptures.

Now therefore to come to our purpose again / though this epistle (as it says
in the sixte) say not the ground of the faith of Christ / yet it buyldeth
conynglye thereon pure gold / silver and preciouse stones / and proves the
presthode of Christ with scriptures inevitable. Moreover there is no work in
all the scripture that so plainly declares the meaning and significacions of
the sacrifices / ceremonies and fygures of the old testament / as this pistle:
in so much that if wilful blindness and malicious malice were not the cause
this epistle only were enough to wede out of the hearts of the Papists that
cankred heresye of iustifyenge of works / concerning our sacraments /
ceremonies and all manner tradicions of their own inuencion.

And finallye in that ye se in the tenth that he had been in bonds and prison
for Christ's sake and in that he so myghtelye dryueth all to Christ to be saved
through him / and so cared for the flock of Christ that he both wrote and sent
/ where he hard that they begone to faynte / to comfort / courage and
strength them with the word of God / and in that also that he sent Timothe
Paul's disciple both verteous / well learned and had in great reverence / it is
easy to se that he was a faithful servant of Christ's and of the same
doctrine that Timothe was of / ye and Paul him self was / and that he was an
Apostle or in the Apostles time or nere thereunto. And saying the pistle agrees
to all the r^st of the scripture / if it be indiffere^tlye looked on / how should
it not be of auctoryte and taken for holy scripture?

Whereof we have many things to say which are hard to be vitered: because ye

For that earth which drinks in the rain which comes often upon it / and

labor that proceeds of love / which love showed in his name / which have
ministered unto the saynctes / and yet minister follow them / which through faith
and patience inheret the promyses.

For when god made promise to Abraham / because he had no greater thing to

The.vii. Chapter.
THis Melchisedech king of Salem (which being pressed of ye most hye god genesis

blessed him: to whom also Abraham gave tithes of all thing) first is by

lykened unto the son of god and continues a priest for ever.

Consider what a man this was / unto who^ the patriarch Abraham gave tithes of
the spoils. And verily those children of levy / which receave the office of

For he of whom these things are spoken / pertayneth unto another trybe / of
which never man served at the aultre. For it is evide^t that our lord sprouge
of the trybe of Judah / of which trybe spoke Moses nothing concerning presthod.

And it is yet a more evydent thing / if after the similitude of Melchisedech
/ there arise a another pressed / which is not made after the law of the carnal
commaundme^t: but after the power of the endless life (For he testifies:
psalm. cix.
Thou art a pressed forever / after the order of Melchysedech) Then the
commaundme^t that went a fore / is disanulled / because of her weakness and
vnproffitablenes. For the law made nothing parfecte: but was an introduccion
of a better hope / by which hope / we draw nigh unto god.

And for this cause it is a better hope / that it was not promised with out an
oath. Those prestes were made with out an oath: but this psalm. cix.
pressed with an oath / by him that said unto him The lord swear / and will not
repent: Thou art a pressed for ever after the order of Melchisedech. And for
that cause was Jesus a stablyssher of a better testament.

And among them many were made prestes / because they were not suffered to
endure by the reason of deeth. But this man / because he endures ever / has
an everlastinge presthod. Wherefore he is able also ever to save them that come
unto god by him / seeing he ever lyveth / to make intercession for us.

The.ix. Chapter.
THat first tabernacle verily had ordinances / and servynges of god / and

pot with manna / and Aarons rod that spronge / and the tables of the
testament. Over the arcke were the cherubis of glory shadowynge the seat of
grace. Of which things / we will not now speak perticularly.

When these things were thus ordained / the prestes went all ways into the
first tabernacle and executed the service of god. But into the second went the
hye pressed alone / once every year: and not with out blood / which he offered
for him silfe / and for the ignorance of ye people. Wherewith ye holy ghost

But Christ being an hye pressed of good things to come / came by a greater and

as touching j. pet. j. d. j. io. j. d. apoc. j. d. j. pet. iij. romans v. b.
the purifiynge of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ (which
through the eternal sprete / offered him silfe with out spot to God) pourdge
your consciences from deed works for to serve the livynge god?

And for this cause is he the mediator of ye new testament / that through deeth
which chaunsed gala. iij. b
makes the testament. For the testament takes authority when men are deed:
For it is of no value as long as he that made it is a live. For which cause

he sprenkled the tabernacle with blood also / and all the ministrynge vessels.
And almost all things / are bye the law / pourged with blood / and with out
effusion of blood / is no remission.

It is then need that the similitudes of hevenly things be purified with soche
things: but the hevenly things them selves are purified with better
sacrifises then are those. For Christ is not entered into the holy places that
are made with hondes / which are but similitudes romans v. b. ^. pet. iij. c

have been offered / because that the offerers once pourged / should have had no
moare consciences of sins. Nevertheless in those sacrifises is there mention
made of sins every year. For it is impossible that the blood of oxen / and
of gotes should take away sins.

Wherefore when he comes into the world / he psalmo. xxxix.
says: Sacrifice and offeringe thou would not have: but a body have thou
ordained me. In sacrifices and synneofferynges thou psalmo. j.
have no lust. Then I said: Lo I come / in the chefest of the book it is
written of me / that I should do thy will / o god. Above when he had said
sacrifice and offering / and burnt sacrifices and synneofferynges thou would
not have / nether have allowed (which yet are offered by the law) and then
said: Lo I come to do thy will o god: he takes a way the first Christ's
body is but once offered

The Prolge upon the pistles of S. James and Judas.
THough this epistle were refused in the old time and denied of many to be
the epistle of a very apostle / and though also it lay not the foundacyon of
the faith of Christ / but speaks of a general faith in god / nether
preaches his death and resurreccyon / either the mercy that is laid up in
store for us in him / or everlasting covenant made us in his blood / which
is the office and duty of a very apostle / as Christ says. Io. xv. ye shall
testify of me: yet because yt sets up no man's doctrine / but cries to
keep the law of god / and makes love which is without percialite the
fullfillinge of the law / as christ and all the apostles did / and has thereto
many good and godly sentences in it: and has also nothing y^ is not a
greable to y^ rest of the scripture if it beloked indifferentlye on: me
thinks it ought of right to be taken for holy scripture. For as for that
place for which happily it was at the beginning refused of holy men (as it
ought / if it had meant / as they took it / and for which place only / for the
false understanding / it has been chefely received of the Papists) yet if
the circumstances be well pondered it will apere that the auctors intent was
far other wise then they took him for.

For where he says in the.ij. chap. faith without deeds is deed in it self
/ he means none other thing then all the scripture does: how that that
faith which has no good deeds folowinge / is a false faith and none of that
faith justifies or receaueth forgeuenes of sins. For God promised the^ only
forgeuenes of their sins which turn to god / to keep his laws. Wherefore
they that purpose to co^tinew still in sin have no part in that promise: but
deceive the^ selves / if they believe that God has forgiven the^ their old
sins for Christ's sake. And after when he says that a man is justified by
deeds and not of faith only / he will no more then that faith does not so
justify every where / that nothing justifies save faith. For deeds also do
justify. And as faith only justifies before God / so do deeds only justify
before the world / where of is enough spoken / partlye in the Prologe on Paul
to the Romans / and also in other places. For as Paul affyrmeth Roma. iij.
that Abraham was not justified by works a fore God / but by faith only as
Genesis bears record / so will James that deeds only justified him be fore
the world / and faith wrought with his deeds: that is to say / faith wherewith
he was ryghteous before God in the heart did cause him to work the will of God
outwardlye / whereby he was ryghteous before the world / and whereby the world
perceived that he believed in god loved and feared God. And as Hebre. xj. the
scripture affirms that Rahab was justified before God through faith / so does
James affirm that through works by which she showed her faith / show as
justified before the world / and it is true.

And as for the epistle of Judas / though men have and yet do doubt of the
auctoure / and though it seem also to be drawn out of the second epistle of
S. Peter / and thereto alleges scripture that is no where found / yet saying
the matter is so godly and agreynge to other places of holy scripture / I se
not but that it ought to have the aucrorite of holy scripture.

mystery / great Babylon the mother of whordome / and abominacions of the earth.
And I saw the wife drunk with the blood of saynctes / and with the blood of
the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her / I wondered with grett mervayle.

And the angel said unto me: wherefore mervayllyst thou? I will show the ye
mystery of the woman / and of the best that berith her / which has seven
heddes / and ten horns. The best that thou see / was / and is not / and
shall ascend out of the bottomless pytt / and shall goo into perdicion / and
they that dwell on the earth shall wondre (whose names are not written in the
book of life from y^ beginning of the world) when they behold the best that
was / and is not. And here is a mind that has wisdom.

The seven heddes are seven mountains / kings / which have received no
kingdom / but shall receave power as kings at one hour with the beast. These
have one mind / and shall geve their power and strenghte unto y^ best. These
shall fight with the lamb / and the lamb shall overcome them: For he is lord
of lords / and king of kings: and they that are on his side / are called /

And I herd another voice from heven say: come a way from her my people /
that ye be not parttakers in her sins / that ye receave not of her plages.
For her sins are gone up to heven / and God has remembered her wyckednes.
Reward her even as she rewarded you / and geve her dubble according to her
works. And pour in dubble to her in the same cup which she filled unto you.
And as much as she gloryfied her silfe and lyved wantanly / so much pour ye

And the kings of the earth shall be weep her and wayle over her / which have
committed fornicacion with her / and have lyved wantanly with her / when they
shall se the smoke of her burning / and shall stand a far of / for fear of
her punnysshment / saying: Alas / Alas / that great cite Babylon / that mighty

And every ship governer / and all they that occupied ships / and shippmen

they cast dust on their heddes / and cried weeping

Rejoice over her thou heven / and ye holy Apostles / and prophets: for god

The first frydayein Aduent / the* Epistle.
Harken unto me^ ye that follow ryghteousnes esa. lj.
and seek the lord. Look unto the rock ye were cut out / and to the cave
and pit ye were dug out. Look unto Abraham your father and unto Sara that
bare you: how I called him only / and blessed him and multiplied him. For the
lord has compassion on Sion and has compassion on all that is decayed therein
/ and will make her wilderness as paradise / and her deserte as the garden of
the lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein / with thankesgeuynge and the
voice of praise. Harken unto me my people / and turn your ears to me my
folk. There shall a law go out from me / and my judgment will I stablishe to
be a light unto nations. My ryghteousnes is nigh / and my salvacyon shall go
out / and mine arms shall judge nations / and ylondes shall look for me and
shall tarry after mine arm. Lift up your eyes to heaven and behold the earth
beneth. For heaven shall vanyshe away as smoke / and the earth shall wear
away as a vesture / and the in habiters thereof shall peryshe away after the
same manner / but my salvacion shall endure ever / and my ryghteousnes shall not
perish. Harken unto me ye that know righteousness and so let the people that
have my law in their hertes. Fear not the rebukes of man nether faynte for
their blasphemies. For worms shall eat them as a garment / and mothes shall
devour them as it were woll. But my ryghteousnes shall contynew ever / and my
salvation from generation to generation.

The wensdaye in the second weke of Adue^t The epistle.
THus says the lord: I will return to zach. viij.
Syon and will dwell in the myddle of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called
the city of troth and the hill of the lord Sabbath and an holy hill. Thus
says the lord Sabbath: yet there shall sit both old men and old women in
the streets of Jerusalem and men with staves in their hands for the multitude
of days. And the streets of the city shall be filled with boys and wenches
playenge in the streets thereof. Thus says the lord zabaoth / though it seem
hard in the eyes of the remmanau^t of this people / shall it seem hard in
mine eyes says the lord zabaoth. Thus says the lord zabaoth: behold I will
deliver my people from the eest contre and from the land of the going down
of the son / and will bring them that they shall dwell in the mids of
Jerusalem. And they shall be my people / and I will be their God in truth and
righteousness.

The frydaye next following The Epistle.
THis says the lord: upon the walls of Jerusalem / I have set kepers which
shall never cease / nether by day ner esa. lxij.
yet by night. And ye that stere up the remembrance of the lord / se that ye
pause not / nether let him have rest until he have prepared and made Jerusalem
glorious in the earth The lord has sworn by his right hand and by his
strong arm / that he will not give thy corn any moare to be eaten of thine
enemies: and that alyentes shall not drink thy new wine wherefore thou have
labored. But they that made it shall eat it and shall pray the lord: and
they that gathered it / shall drynk it in the court of my holy temple. Go
from gate to gate / and prepare the way for the people / cast up gravayle and
make the way hye and cleanse it of stones / and set up a baner for the people.
Behold the lord will make it known unto the ends of the world. And say ye
unto the daughter of Sion: behold he that is thy sauyoure comes and his
reward with him and his work before him. And they shall be called a people of
holiness redeemed of the lord. And thou shall be called an haunted city and not
forsaken.

the spirit of council and of strength / the spirit of knowledge and of
reverence / and it shall make him sauer of the fear of the lord. And he shall
not judge after the sight of his eyes: nether shall rebuke after the hearing
of his ears. But he shall judge the causes of the poor with ryghteousnes / and
shall rebuke with equity for ye vmble of ye earth. And he shall smite ye earth
with the rod of his mouth / and with ye breath of his lyppes shall sleye the
wicked. And righteousness shall be the gyrdle of his loins / and faythfullnes the
gyrdle of his raynes.

Jerusalem. It shall come to pass esa. ij.

shall resort thereto. And much people shall go and save: come and let us go up
to the hill of the lord and unto the house of the God of Jacob: that he may
teach us his ways / and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Sion
shall come the law / and the word of God out of Jerusalem. And he shall be
judge among the hethen and tell many nations their fautes* and they shall
turn their sweardes into mattockes and their spears into sythes. One nation
shall not lift up a swearde against another / nether shall they teach to
war any moare. O house of Jacob come and let us walk in the light of the
lord.

The wensdaye in the fourth weke of aduent The Epistle.
THis says the lord. Children of Sion be glad and rejoice in the lord your

God. For he has given you a teacher of righteousness / and will make descend

shall be full of corn / and the wine presses flow with wine and oil. And I
will restore you again with my great power which I have sent unto you / the
years which the locustes and caterpillars have devoured. And ye shall eat and
have enough and praise the name of the lord your God / which has wrought
wonders with you. And my people shall not be in shame for ever. And ye shall
know that I am in the mids of Israel / and that I am the lord your God /
and that there is no moo. And my people shall not Ioes. iij.
be in shame for ever. And ye shall know yt I the lord your God / dwell in
Syon my holy mount. And Jerusalem shall be holy / and there shall no stranger
pass through there any more. And at that day the mountains shall drop
sweet wine / and the hills shall flow with milk / and all the brokes of Judah
shall run with water. And a fountain / shall go out of the house of the
lord and water theryuer of Sittim. Egypt shall goo to ruin / and Edom shall be
a desert and a wyldernes / which oppressed the children of Israel / and which
sheed ynnocent blood in their land. And Judah shall contynew ever / and
Jerusalem from generation to generation. And I will cleanse their blood which I
have not cleansed. And the Lord shall dwell in Sion.

whereof I sing: and is become my savyoure. And ye shall draw water in gladness
out of the wells of salvation. And ye shall say in that day: give thanks
unto the lord: call on his name: make his deeds known among the hethen:
remember that his name is hie. Lift up. Sing unto the lord / for he has
done excellentlye / and that is known through out all the world. Cry and

shall leave after him a blessing? Sacrifice and drynk offering unto ye lord
your God. Blow a trompet in Sion / proclayme fasting and call a
congregation. Gather the people together / bring the elders to one place /
gather the young children and they that suck the breasts / together. Let the
brydgrome come out of his chamber and the bryde out of her parloure. Let the
prestes that mynister unto the lord / weep between the porche and the alter /
and say: spare (lord) thy people and delyver not thine enheritaunce unto
rebuke that the hethen should raygne over the^. Why should they say: among the
nations / where is their god. And the lord envyed for his lo^des sake and had
compassion on his people. And the lord answered and said unto his people
Behold / I sent you corn / new wine and oil / that ye shall be satisfied
therewith* N^ther will I delyver you any moare unto ye hethen

On the frydaye next following. The Epistle.
Cry with the throat and spare not. Lift esa. lviii.
up thy voice as a trompet / and tell my people their offenses and the house of
Jacob their sins. For me they seek day by day / and will know my ways /
as a people that does ryghteousnes / and has not forsaken the equity of their
God. They seek of me ryghteous judgments / and will drawenye unto God. Why
have we fasted and thou have not looked upon it / have vmbled our souls / and
thou would not wit it. Behold when ye fast / ye can find your own lusts
/ and can call cruellye on all your detters. Ye fast to law and stryve and to
smite with fyst wyckedlye. Fast not as ye now do / to make your voice to be
hard up an hie. Should it be soche a manner of fast that I should chose / a day
that a man should hurt his soul in? Or to bow down his heed like a
bullrushe? Or to sprede sack cloth and ashes under him? Should thou call
this a fast / and a day acceptable unto the lord? Or is not this rather y^
fast y^ I have chosen? To lose wicked bo^des and to unbind bondylles of
oppression? And to let the bruised go fre? And that ye should break all manner
yockes? ye and to break the breed to the hungerye / and to bring the poor
that are harbourlesse unto house / and when thou see a naked / that thou
cloth him and y^ thou should with draw thy self from helpinge thine own
flesh: Then should y^ light break out as does y^ day spring / and then
health should shortly bud out. And thy righteousness shall go before the / and
the glory of the lord would come upon the. Then should thou call / and the
lord should answer: then should thou cry / and he shall say / lo here am I.
For I the lord thy God am merciful*

On the wensdaye after the first sunday in lent / the Epistle.
ANd the lord said unto Moses: come up to me into the hill / and be there /
and exodi. xxiiij.
I will give the tables of stone and a law and commandments / which I have
written to teach them. Then Moses rose up and his mynister Iosue / and Moses
went up into the hill of God / and said unto the elders: tarry ye here /
until we come again unto you: and behold here is Aaron and Hur with you. If
any man have any matters to do / let him come to them. When Moses was come up
into the mount / a cloud covered the hill / and the glory of the Lord abode
upon mount Sina / and the Lord covered it.vi. days. And y^ seventh day he
called unto Moses out of the cloud. And the fassion of the glory of y^ Lord
was like consuminge fire on the tope of the hill in the sight of the children
of Israel. And Moses went into the mountain. And Moses was in the mountain
fourtye days and fourtye nyghtes.

Another for the same day. The epistle.
IN those days came Elias to Barsabe / that is in Judah / and left his lad
there. iii. regum ^xix.
And he went into the wilderness a days iorneye / and came and sat under a
genaper tree / and wysshed to his soul that he might dye / and said: yt is
now enough Lord / take my soul / for I am not better then my fathers. And as
he lay and slepte under a genaper tree: behold / an angel touched him / and
said thus: up and eat. And he looked up: and behold there was at his heed a
cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank and laid
him down again. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time and
touched him / and said: up and eat: for thou have a great way to goo. And he
arose and ate and drank and walked through the strength of that meat fourtye
days and fourtye nyghtes / even unto the mount of God Horeb.

The frydaye next folowinge. The epistle.
THis says the Lord. The soul that sins / she shall dye. The son shall
^ze. xviii
not bear part of the fathers wyckednes. The ryghteousnes of the ^yght shall be
upon him / and the wyckednes of the wicked shall be on him. And yet the wicked if
he turn from all his sins which he did / and keep all mine ordinances / and
do justly and ryghteouslye / he shall live and not dye. None of the sins
that he has done shall be reconed unto him: In the ryghteousnes that he has
done / he shall lyve. For I desire not the deeth of a sinner (says the Lord
Jehovah) but rather that he should turn from his way / and lyve. And so if a
ryghteous turn from his ryghteousnes and do wyckednes / and shall do like
unto all the abhominacyons which a wicked does / shall he lyve? No / none of
those ryghteousnes that he did shall be remembered. But in the wyckednes which he
wrought / and in the sin which he did / in them shall he dye. But you will
say / the way of the Lord is not equal. Here I pray you ye house of
Israel. Is not my way equal? If a ryghteous turn from his right ousnes and
do wyckedlye / and dye therefore: in the wyckednes which he did he shall dye.
And when a wicked turns from his wyckednes and does iustlye and ryghteouslye
/ he shall save his soul: because he feared and turned from all his wyckednes
which he did / he shall live and not dye / says the lord allmyghtie.

all his works and said lord / lord king allmyghtie: for in thy power all
things are put / nether is there any that can resist thy will / if thou have
determined to save Israel. Thou made heaven and earth / and whatsoever is
contained within the compass of heaven: thou art lord of all / nether is
there any that can resist thy majesty. Thou know all things / and wottest
yt it was not of pride or of spyte / or any desyer of glory yt I did not
worship most proud Amon: for I would have been ready / and that gladlye (for
the saving of Israel) to have kyst even the steps of his fete. But I feared
least I should turn y^ glory of my God unto a man / and feared to worship
any man save my God. And now lord king and God of Abraham have mercy on thy
people for our enemies are minded to destroy us and to bring thine
inheritance utterly to naught. Despice not y^ portion which thou delyueredest
for thy self out of Egypt. Hear my prayer and be merciful unto the part
and inheritance / and turn our sorrow into Joy: that we may lyve and
praise thy name O lord / and stop not the mouths of them that praise the.
And all Israel with like mind and prayer / cried unto the lord / because
that present death was not far from them.

that I dreamed. Behold we ware making of sheues in the feld: and se / my
sheffe arose and stood upright / and your sheues stood round about and made
an obeisance unto my sheffe. Then said his brethren unto him what shall thou
be our king / or shall thou raynge over us? And they hated him the more for
his dream and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream and told it
his brethren. And he said: behold / I dreamed yet another dream / Me thought
the son and the moon and eleven stars did worship me. And when he had told
it his father and his brethren / his father rebuked him and said unto him:
what means this dream which thou have dreamed? shall I come and thy mother
and thy brethren and fall before the on the ground? And though his brethren
hated him: yet his father kept the thing in mind. And when his brethren were
gone to pasture their fathers sheep at Sichem / Israel said to Joseph: do not
thy brethren feed the sheep at Sichem? come that I may send y^ to the^ And he
said: here am I. And he said: go good son and se whether it be well with

wa^derynge in ye field and axed him saying: what sekest thou? And he said / I
seek my brethren: tell me I pray ye / where feed they? And the man said: they

devoured him / and let us se whereto his dreams will come. When R^ben hard

him.

And Ruben said moreover / shed no blood / but cast him into yonder pit y^ is

and gather / thou and thy brother Aaron the congregation to gether / and say
unto the rock before their eyes / that he give forth his water. And thou shall
bring them water out of the rock / and shall give the compayne drink / and
their bestes also. And Moses took the staff from before the lord as he
commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before

water out of this rock? And Moses lift up his hand with his staff and smote
the rock two times and the water came out aboundantlye / and the multitude
drank / and their bestes also. And the lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron /
because ye believed me not / to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of
Israel / therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I
have given them. This is the water of strife / because y^ children of Israel
strove with y^ lord / and he was sanctified upon them.

The wensdaye after palm sunday The Epistle.
ESaias said / lord / who believes our esaie. liii.

sparow before him / and as a rote out of a dry land. There was nether
fassyon or beauty on him. And when we looked on him / there was no godlynes yt
we should lust after him. He was despised and cast out of men's company / and
one that had soffered sorrow / and had experynce of infirmity: and we were as
one that had hid his face from him. He was so despisable / that we esteemed him
not. Truly he took upon him our deseases / and bare our sorrows. And yet we
counted him plaged / and beaten and humbled of God. He was wounded for our
transgression / and bruised for our iniquities. The correccio^ that brought us
peace was on him / and with his strypes we were healed. And we went astraye as
sheep / and turned every man his way: and the lord put on him the wyckednes
of us all He soffered wrong and was evil entreated / and yet opened not his
mouth: he was as a sheep led to be slain: and as a lamb before his s^e^er /
he was domme and opened not his mouth. By ye reason of ye afflyccion / he was
not esteemed: and yet his generacio^ who can no^bre? When he is taken from ye
earth of living me^: for my peoples transgression he was plaged. He put his
sepulcher with the wicked / and with ye rich in his death: because he did none
iniquity / nether was gyle found in his mouth. And yet the lord determined
to bruise him with infirmities. His soul gevynge her self for trangression / he
shall se seed of long co^tinuaunce / and the will of ye lord shall prospere
in his hand Because of ye labor of his soul / he shall se and be satisfied.
With his knowledge / he being just / shall justify my saruauntes and that a
great no^bre: and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him his
part in many and the spoil of y^ rich he shall deuyde: because he gave his
soul to death / and was nombred with the trespasers / and he bare the sin of
many / and made intercession for transgressors.

we will pay the openly that we have promised with our lyppes. Assure shall not
save us / nether will we ride on horses: nether will we say to ye works of
our own hands / ye are our Gods / for thou have compassion on the
friendless. I will heal their obedience and will love the^ of mine own
accord: for my wrath is ceased from them. I will be as dew to Israel / and he
shall florisshe as a lylee / and stretch out his rotes as Libanon. His
branches shall run out / and as an olive tree shall his glory be / and his
savoure as Libano^. They that shall turn and sit in his shadow / shall lyve
with corn / and florisshe as vynes. His renoune shall be as the wine of Libanon.
Ephraim / what have ye any moare to do with ydoles? I have healed him and
looked on him. I will be as a great fyrre tree / and of me shall thy fruit be

For the ways of the Lord are straight / and the righteous shall walk in
them: but the wicked shall stomble in them.

old Testament.
On saint Nicolas day. The pistle.
Behold an excellent Priest which in cccl. xliiii
his days pleased God / and was found righteous / and in time of wrath made
an atonement: Like to him there is not found / that kept the law of the most
highest. And he was in covenant with him / and in his flesh he wrote the
covenant / and in time of temptacyon he was found faithful. Therefore he made
him a covenant with an oath / that nations should be blessed in his sight / and
that he should be multiplied as y^ dust of the earth. He knew him in his
blessings and gave him an inheritance. And he kept him through his mercy /
that he found grace in the eyes of God. An everlastinge covenau^t did he make
him / and gave him the office of ye hie priest. He made him happy in glory.
In faith and in his softenes / he made him holy / and chose him out of all
flesh.

AS a vine / so brought I forth a savoure ecclesiastici. xxiiii.
of swetnesse. And my flowers are the fruit of glory and riches. I am ye
mother of bewtifull love and of fear / and of greatness and of holy hope. In
me is all grace of life and truth. And in me is all hope of life and virtue.
Come unto me all y^ desyer me / and be filled with the fruits that spring of
me. For my sprite is sweter then honye or honye comb. The remembreunce of me
is for ever and ever. They that eat me / shall honger the moare / and they
that drink me / shall thurst the more. He that herkeneth to me / shall not be
ashamed / and he that works by my counsel / shall not sin. And they that
bring into light / shall have eternal life.

On candlemas day. The epistle.
Behold / I send my messenger which mala. iii.
shall prepare the way before me. And suddenly shall the Lord whom ye seek /
come unto his temple / and the messenger of the covenant whom ye desyer.
Behold / he comes says the lord Sabbath. Who shall endure in the day of
his coming / or who shall stand to behold him? For he is as tryinge fire
and as the erbe that fullers scour withal. And he shall sit tryenge and
purgynge silver / and shall purify the sons of leui / and shall fine them as
gold and silver. And they shall bring offering unto the lord of
ryghteousnes. And the sacrifice of Judah and of Jerusalem shall be delycious unto
the lord as in the old time and in the years that were at the beginning.

Wherefore the lord said: Harken ye of ye house of David: Is it so small a
thing for you / to be grievous to men / but y^ ye should also be paynfull unto
God? neuerthe later yet y^ lord / he will give you a sign. Behold a vyrgyn
shall be with child / and shall bear a son / and shall call his name Emanuel. He
shall eat butter and honye / yt he may have understanding to refuse y^ evil
and to chose ye good

On saint Philip and Jacobs day. ye epistle.
THen shall ye ryghteous stand with great constance against them yt vexed them
and took away that they had labored sapi. v.
for. When the wicked shall se that they shall be troubled with horrible fear /
and shall wonder at the soden and unlooked for victory / and shall say in them
selves / repenting and sorowynge for anguyshe of heart. These be they which we
sometime mocked and iested on. We were out of our wits and thought their
living madness / and their end to be without honor But behold / how they
are counted among the children of God / and have their inherytaunce among the
saints.

On the Nativite of. S. Ihon baptistes day. The Epistle.

the shadow he led me with his hand. And he made me as an excellent arow / and
hid in his quyver. And he said to me: thou art my saruaunt O Israel / in whom
I will be glorified. And I said: I labor in vain and spend my strength for
naught / and vnproffytably. How be yt my cause I commyt to the lord and my
travail unto my God. And now says y^ lord that formed me in the womb / to

so is my beloved among the sons / in his shadow was my desyet to sit / for
his fruit was sweet to my mouth. He brought me into his wine seller: and his
behauer to mewarde was lovely. Behold my beloved said to me: up and have my
love / my dove / my bewtifull and come / for now is winter gone and rain
departed and past. The flowers apere in our contre and the time is come to cut

my love / my dove / in the holes of the rock and secret places of the walls.
Show me thy face and let me here thy voice / for thy voice is sweet and thy

On saint Marye Magdalens day The Epistle.
A Woman of power and verite / if a man could find: y^ value of her were
far prouerbi. xxxi.
a boue perlee. The heart of her husband trusts in her / y^ he needs not
spoils. She rendereth him good and not evil all y^ days of her life. She
sought woll and flax and did as her hands served her. She is lyk a merchants
ship y^ brings her vitayles from far. She ryseth yer day and gives meat
to her household / and fode to her maidens. She consydred a ground and bought
yt / and of the fruit of her hands planted a vine. She gyrde her loins with
strength and couraged her arms. She per ceaued that her huswyfrye was
proffitable / and therefore did not put out her candle by night She set her
fyngers to the spyndle / and her hands caught hold on the dystaffe. She
opened her hand to the poor / and strethed out her hands to the nedye. She
feared not least the cold of snow should hurt her house / for all her
household were doble clothed. She made her gaye ornaments / of byce and purple
was her apparel. Her husband was had in honor in the gates / as he sat with
the elders of the land. She made linen and sold it / and delivered agyrdell
to the merchaunt. Strength and glory were her raiment / and she laughed in the
later days. She opened her mouth with wisdom / and the law of right ousnes
was on her tongue. She had an eye to her household and eat not breed ydlye. Her
children arose and blessed her / and her husband commended her. Many daughters
have done excellentlye but thou have passed them all. Favor is a de ceauable
thing / and beauty is vanytie. But a woman that fears God / she shall be
praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands / and let her works praise her in
the gates.

On the assumpcion of our laid. y^ epistle
IN all those things I sought rest: and in some man's inheritance would have
ecclesiaste xxiiij.
dwelt. Then the creator of all thing commanded and said unto me: and he
that created me did set my tabernacle at rest and said unto me / dwell in Jacob
and have thine inheritance in Israel / and rote thy self among mine elect.
From the beginning and before the world was I created / and unto the world
to come / will I not cease: and before him have I mynistred in the holy
habitacion And soin Sihon was Isettled / and in the holy city lykwyse I
rested / and in Jerusalem was my power. And I roted my self in an honorable
people / which are the lords part / and he their inheritance: and among the
multitude of saints I held me fast. As a Cedar tree was I lift up in libanon
/ and as a Cypers tree in mount Hermon. As a palm tree was I exalted in Cades
/ and as roseplantes in Jericho. As a bewtifull olyue tree in the feldes / and
and as a plantayne tree was I exalted upon the waters. In ye streets I gave an
odoure as synamon and balm ye smells well / and gave an odoure of swetnes as
perfect myrre.

These things have I added to fill up the leffe with all.
Infernus and gehenna differ much in significacion / though we have none other
interpretacion for either of them / then this English word / hell. For gehenna
signifies a place of punyshement: but infernus is taken for any manner of place
beneth in y^ earth / as a grave sepulcher or cave.

Hell: it is called in Hebrew the valeye of math. v.
Hennon. A place by Jerusalem / where they burnt their children in fire unto
the ydole Moloch / and is usurped and taken now for a place where the wicked
and ungodly shall be tormented both soul and body / after the general
judgment.

Give Rowme to y^ wrath of God. Romans xii romans xxii
wrath is there taken for vengeance. And the meaning is: let God advenge /
either by himself or by the officers that bear his rowme.

There tarry and abide till ye go out. Yt is mat. x.
in Mark the.vi. Wheresoever ye enter in to an house / there abide till ye go
out thence. And Luke.ix. it is / into what soever housse ye enter / there tarry
/ and go not out thence: that is to say / whosoever receaveth you / there
abide as long as you are in the city or town / and go not shamefully a
beggynge from housse to housse as freers do.

Dust: shake of the dust of your fete. Matthew. mat. x.
x. Why are they commanded to shake of the dust? For a wytnes says Luke. That
that deed may testify against them in the day of judgment / that the
doctrine of salvacion was offered them / but they would not receave it. Ye se
also that soche gestures and ceremonies have greater power with them / then
have bare words only / to move the heart and to stere up faith / as do the
layenge on of hands and anoyntinge with oil. etc.

Ypocrytes / can ye decerne the face of heaven and not decerne the sign of the
times? That is to say: they could judge by the signs math. xvi
of the sky what wether should follow: but could not know Christ by the
signs of the scripture. And yet other sign might not be geven them.

He that says he knows Christ and keeps not his commandments / is a
liar. To know Christ is to beleve in Christ. Ergo he that keeps not the
commandments / beleveth not in Christ.

The end of this book.
