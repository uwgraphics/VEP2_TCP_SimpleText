The Examinations of Henry Barrowe John Grenewood and John Penrie / before the
high commissioners / and Lords of the Counsel. Penned by the prisoners
themselves before their deaths.



There is nothing covered / that shall not be reviled: neither hid / that shall
not be known. Luke. 12. 2. ffor every work God himself will bring Unto
judgment / with every secret thing whither good or evil. Eccles. 2. 14. THe
testimony and sufferings of the prisoners / whose examinations here ensue /
cannot easily / gentle reader) be forgott^^ of and whose heart is touched with
care of religion and zeal of the truth. How weighty the. causes were for
which they suffered / may appear par^^ie by that which follows / but Here
have thou the manner of the* Prelates proceeding against them / and how they were
convicted of their Brownisme / ^onatisme / ^na^^ptis^^ie / S^hisme / Heresy
etc. wherewith they were charged / and for which they were so (...) years kept
in miserable close prisons / and at last bereaved of their lives. Sure
whosoever had been the persons / and whatsoever the er^ours it would well ^aue
become the Lord Arch ^* of the church of England / to have better instructed
and informed them by the ^^^rd of truth and w^^l^o^e doctrine / before they had
been adjudged to prison and death. ^* Tim. 2 / 24* 25. and 4 / 2. ^it. 2 / 1.
Or if Paul's counsel could not take effect / yet Pilates example might have
stayed such courses / who examined our Lord Christ's accusers / and found them
false*and never sent him to close prison for refusing to swear to accuse him
self. Mat. 27. Luke 23. Joh. 18. Neither yet did the late prelates in Q. Mary's
days use ^ltogither such severitie: for Bonnet him self with the other tyrants
of that (...)e / ^ad often conference and disputation with the Ma^^yrs / and
sought by scriptures to have overthrown them / if they could. Evil therefore
have our (...). provided for their cause and credit* so slightly to deal in
matters of such moment / and to proceed to such s^^ere to r^ures / before more
open and orderly conviction of the faults and ercours. Lo now al posterities
shall see their practices: and though they have spilt the blood of those men
which vered them so fore / yet can they not bereave the world of their
testi^^^ie which ^y word and writing they have left behind them. The lord give
these men (if they belong unto h^^) to ad^^^t and see their dealinges / and to
remember the account which they ere long shall be called unto / before him who is
ready to judge quick and dead. The publishing of these things can not justly
be offensive to any / seeing 1. nothing (...) is here set down* but that which
was then demanded and answered / (as near as the prisoners could remember:)
2. And they / which have themselves set forth the examinations of (...)
heretofore / may not be greened now when their own turn is come / and their
proceedings made known likewise: they which do well need not shun the light.
How ever it be the church of God I doubt not shall reap some profit hereby*for
which / how (...) so ever it be let h^^ have the praise.

Amen.
Abrief of the examination of me Henry Barrowe the 19. of November. 1586.
Before the Arch B. Arch D. and Dr. Cussins: as near as my memory could carry:
being at Lambeth.
THis 19. being the Lords day / between 9. and 10. often the clock in the fore
noone / M^ ^ul and I went unto the Clinke to visit M^* Grenewood / and the
other brethren there emprisoned: where we had not been the space of one quarter
of an hour / but Mr. Shephe^d the keeper of the prison came up / rebuked Mr.
Grenewood / and stayed me / saying he had commandment from his Lords grace so
to do. I demanded a sight of his warrant: he answered that he would do it /
and I might afterward if I were wronged / bring mine action. So he locked me up
in prison / and forthwith went to his Lords grace to Lambeth. About one of the
clock he returned / and brought with him 2. pursuvantes. I was forthwith put
into a boat / and carried to Lambeth. By the way / one of the pursuvants called
Watson / drew out of his boso^^ a letter from the court of Lambeth unto me /
saying how he had a long time sought me. I told him / his pains deserved
thanks / neither at Gods hands nor mine: I refused his letter / and said that
I obeyed neither it nor him / neither would I read it / showing how I was under
the arrest of the keeper of the Clinke who sat by me. Well / we arrived at
Lambeth / where after I had perused the B. his state / I was brought into his
presence chamber / yet not until this Watson had prevented me / and showed his
master what had passed in the boat.

Arch B. Barrowe / is your name Barrowe?


B. Yea.


A. It is told me / that you refuse to receive or obey our letter / know you
what you do? it is from the high commissioners / and this man a pursuvant.


B. I refused to receive or obey that letter at that time.


A. Why so?


B. Because I was under arrest / and imprisoned without warrant / and against
law: and therefore now it was too late to bring the letter.


A. Why / may not a Counselor commit to prison by his bare commandment?

(alleging how the Aldermen of London do daily.)
B. That is not the question / what a counselor may do: but whither this man
may do it without warrant / by the law of the land:

(pointing to the keeper of the Clinke.)
A. Know you the law of the land?


B. Very little / yet was I of Grayes Inn some years.

(Then his two Doctors and he / decided mine unskillfulness.) Let this pass: I
look for little help by law against you: I pray you why have you imprisoned me /
and after this manner sent for me?


A. That you shall know upon yowr oath: will now swear?


B. I hold it lawful to swear / so it be done with due order and circumstances.


A. Reach a book / hold it him.


B. What shall we do with this?


A. Lay your hand upon it man.


B. To what purpose?


A. To swear.


B. I Use to swear by no books.


A. You shall not swear by the book / but by God oncly.


B. So I purpose when I swear.


Cus. Did you never take an oath at an Assise before the Judges there?


B. No.


Cus. But would you refuse there to lay yowr hand on a book and swear?


B. Yea.


C. Then would your testimony not be taken.


A. Why man the book is no part of the oath / it is but a cerimonie.


B. A needless and wicked ceremony.


A. Why know you what you say? know you what book it is? it is the Bible.


B. I will swear by no Bible.


C. Scismaticks are clamorous always. it is a perpetual note to know them by.
A. Mr. Dr. Cussins says true / such were the Donatistes always in the
counsels / and such art thou and al other scismatiks such as thou art.


B. Say yowr pleasure / God forgive you: I am neither scismatike nor
clamourous: I answer but yowr demandes / if you will I will be silent.


A. Well will you lay your hand on the Bible and take an oath.


B. I use to join no creatures to the name of God in an oath.


A Neither shall you / this is but a custom commanded by law.


B. The law ought not to commannd a wicked custom.


A, Why / is it not lawful to lay your hand on a book?


B. Yes / but not in an oath.


A. Will you lay your hand in my hand / and swear?


B. No.


A. Will you lay your hand on ye table and swear?


B. No.


A. Will you hold up your hand toward heaven and swear?


B. That is not amiss: but I will use my liberty.


A. Why you hold it lawful to lay your hand on the table and swear?


B. Yea / so it be not commanded and made of necessity.


A. Why / the book is y^ like: it is nothing of the oath but a thing
indifferent.


B. If it be nothing of the oath / why do you so peremptorily inioyne it? and
if it be indifferent as you say it is / then do I well in not using it.


A. Nay / you do not well in refusing it / for therein you show yowr self
disobedient to the higher powers set over you by God.


B. Even now you said it was a thing indifferent: if it be so / there is no
power can bring me in bondage to my liberty.


A. Where find you that?


B. In S Paul. 1. Cor. The Arch B. Archd. Dr. Cussins / al denied it. I
affirmed it. a little testament in greek and latin was brought me / and a Bible
I looked foe the place but could not find it: great sault was in my memory /
ffor I looked in the 10. chapter / neither ^^deed could I bethink me where to
find it / they so interrupted me.


A. Your de^initie is like yowr law.


B. The word of God is not the worse for my il memory.


A. You speak not as you thinck / for you are proud.


B. I have small cause to be proud of my memory / you see yt default of it: but
the Apostle says it. Again they al denied it. You then have no cause to
condemn my memory / seeing you al have utterly forgotten this saying. Then
repeated I the words: Al things are lawful for me / but I will not be brought
in bondage to my liberty. Then they recited. Romans 14. and 1. Corint. 8. al
things are lawful for me / but al things are not expedient. I said I meant
not that place.


A. I would like it well if you cited your place in Greek or Latin.


B. Why you understand English: is not the word of God in English? Then Cussin
began to speak of indefinita propositio, but whereupon I can not call to
remembranc: ^ I told him we were now about the new Testament / it might be if
he had asked me that question when I knew him in Cambridge / I should then have
answered him he forthwith called to remembrance of what house I was.


A. Were you then of Cambridge?


B. Yea / I knew you there. He said he was there before I was borne. I said it
might be. Then he entered into discourse of his antiquititie. Then he asked me
if I had read books / as Calvin / Beza etc* I answered that I had read more
then enough: But yet I know not why I am emprisoned.


A. It is reported that you come not to church / are disobedeent to her
majesty / and say that there is not a true church in England / what say you /
have you at any time said thus?


B. These are reports. when you produce yowr testimony I will answer.


A. But I will better believe you / upon yowr oath / then them: how say you /
will you swear?


B. I will know what I swear to / before I swear.


A. ffirst swear: and then if any thing be unlawfully demanded / you shall not
answer.


B. I have not learned so to swear / I will first know and consider of the
matter before I take an oath. Thus many things being alleged to and fro by us
/ the Arch B. commanded Cussin to record / that I refused to swear upon a
book.


B. pea / and set down also / that I will not swear thus at randon / but first
I will know and consider of the things I swear unto / whither they require an
oath.


A Well / when were you at church?


B. That is nothing to you.


A. You are a scismatick / a recusant / a seditious person / etc. with many
such like.


B. Say what you list of me / I freely forgive you.


A. I care not for yowr forgiveness.


B. But if you offend me / you ought to seek it / while you are in the way with
me.


A. When were you at church?


B. I have answered that in an other place / it belongs not to you.


A. Why / are you indicted?


B. I am.


A. Yet belongs it to is / I will not only meddle with you / but arraigne you
as an heretic before me.


B. You (...) no more then God ^^^: Err I may / but heretic will I never be.


A. Will you come to church hereafter?


B. ffuture things are in the Lords hands: if I do not / you have a law.


A. Have you spoken these words of the church of England?


B. When you produce your witness I will answer.


A. But upon your oath I will believe you.


B. But I will not accuse my self. Then began he again to charge me with scisme
/ sedition / heres^e.


B. You are lawless: I had rather you produced yowr witness.


A. Of what occupation are you?


B. A christian.


A. So are we al.


B. I deny that.


A. But are you a minister?


B. No.


A. A scholemaister?


B. No.


A. What then / of no trade of life?


B. In your letter / you know my trade in the superscription.


A You are then a gentleman.


B. After the manner of our country a gentleman.


A. Serve you any man?


B. No I am Gods freeman.


A. Have you lands.


B. No / nor fees.


A. How live you?


B. By Gods goodness / and my friends


A. Have you a father alive?


B. Yea.


A. Where dwells he in Norffolke?


B. Yea.


A. Where dwell you / in London?


B. No.


A. Well can you find sufficient surety for your good behavior?


B. Yea / as sufficient as you can take.


A. What / you cannot have the Queen?


B. Neither can you take her / she is the judge of her law: yet for my good
behavior / I suppose I could get her word.


A. Does she know you then?


B. I know her.


A. Else were it pity of your life.


B. Not so.


A. Can you have any of these that came with you / to be bound for you?


B. I know not / I think I can.


A. What know you them not?


B. I know one of them.


A. What is he?


B. A gentleman of Graies ynne.


A. What call you him?


B. Lacie.


A. But know you what band you should enter / you are bound hereby to frequent
our churches.


B. I understand you of my good behavior.


A. And in it is this contained: and so you had forseyted your band at the
first.


B. Well now I know yowr mind / I will enter no such band.


A Then I will send you to prison. Then called he Watson the pursuva^t / and O.
Cussins a part into a window / where he made a warrant to send me to prison.


B. ^ow shall not touch one hair of my head / without the will of my heavenly
father.


A. Nay I will do this to rectify you.


B. Consider what you do / you shall one day answer it.


A. You will not swear: you will not enter bond for your appearance.


B. I will put in band for my bail in the prison / and for my true imprisonment.


A. Nay / that will not serve the turn / Mr. Doctor / enter these things. Then
Cussins wrote that I refused to swear / and enter bond.


^. I will send some to you to confer.


A. B That were more requisite before my imprisonment. So the Arch B. delivered
me to the pursuvant to ^arie me to the (...) / where I as yer (...) / neither
knowing the cause of my imprisonment / neither have I as yet heard from him.

I was no sooner out of his house / but I remembered the place in controversy:
it is written. 1. Cor. 6. 12. Al things are lawful for me / but al things are
not profitable: I may do al things / but I will not be brought under the power
of any thing.


The lord knows to deliver the god^ out of t^ntation and to rese^^e the
^^^ust unto the day of Judgment under punishment.

THe 27. of November / 8. days after I was committed by Cant. to the Gatehowse:
I was sent for by one of his servantes to make appearance before the high
Commissioners at Lambeth: whither he and my keepers man Nitholas carried me.
There I found a very great train without / but within a goodly Synod of Bbs.
Oeanes / Civilians / etc. beside such an appearance of welfedde silken Preistes
/ as I suppose might well have b^seemed the ^aticaue. where after to my no small
grief I had heard a scholemaister deny his master Christ / I was called.

Canterbury with a grimme and an angry countenance beholding me / made
discourse how I refused to swear on a book etc. as fell out in our first
meeting: and demannded whither I were now better advised / and would swear. I
answered / that I would not refuse to swear upon due occasion and
circumstances.

C. Will you then now swear?


B. I must first know to what.


C. So you shall afterward.


B. I will not swear unless I know before.


C. Well I will thus far satisfy your humor. London began to interrupt / but
Cant / cut him of / and produced a paper of objections against me / which he
delivered to one Beadle to read. It contained much matter / and many
suggestions against me / disorderly framed according to the malicious humor of
mine accuser / as / that I denied God to have a true church in England: and to
prove this / the 4. principal causes framed in way of argument / as / the
worship of God with us is jdolatrie: ergo / no true church. They have an
Antichristian and jdolatrous ministry: ergo no true church ffurther he says
/ that the reverend father in God / my lords grace of Cant. and all the Bps. of
the land / are Antichrists. ffurther he says / that all the ministers in the
land are thieves and m^^therers / and secret hypocrites / and that all the
preachers of the land are hirelinges. That Mr. Wiggington and Cartwright
strain at a gnat / and swollow a camel.

^^urther / he (...) a^ writers / as ^a^vin / Beza / etc. and says that al
catechismes are idolatrous / and not to be used. The reasons to these were
untruly and disorderley set down accordingly in the bil / which I cannot
rehearse. L. How say you Mr. Deane of Paul's / here is for you / you have
written a catechism /


Cant. This fellow dea^es indifferently / he makes us al alike. Thus far have I
satisfied you: now you know what you shall swear unto: how say you / will you
swear now?


Land. My Lords grace does not show this favor to many.


Can. ffetch a book.


Bar. It is needles.


C. Why / will you not swear now.


B. An oath is a matter of great importance / and requires great
consideration. But I will answer you truly / Much of the matter of this bil is
true / but the form is false.


C. Go to sir / answer directly / will you swear? reach him a book.


B. There is more cause to swear mine accuser: I will not swear.


C. Where is his keeper? you shalnot prattle here Away with him: clap him up
close / close / let no man come at him: I will make him tell an other tale / per
I have done with him.

There was an article against me in the bil / for saying that I thought Elders
were Bisshops / and Philip. 1. 1. produced here by I plainly discover mine
accuser to be Thornelie of Norwich with whom I had communication at Ware as I
rode to London / and never talked with any other about this matter.

THe effect / and so near as my frail memory could carry away / the very
words of such interrogatories and answers as were demanded of and made by me
Henry Barrowe before certain Commissioners there unto especially appointed by
her Majesty: namely the two L. cheef Justices / the master of the Rolls /
the L. cheef Baron / and another Baron of the Exthequor I thinck Baron Gente:
together with the Arch B. of Cant the B. of London / the B. of Winchester /
certain of their Chan^ellors and ^^uil Doctors with their Registers and
Scribes. The 24. of March.

I being brought before the Arch B of Cant he made known unto me that they
were authorized by her Majesty to examine me upon my oath upon certain
interrogatories and therefore called for a book / there was brought a great
bible in folio fair bound / which the Arch B. refused / and called for an
other / which was held to me by (...)


Bar. To what end?


Cant. To swear.


B. I have not learned to swear by any creatures.


Cant. This is the word of God / the Bible.


B. I began to open the book / and meant in deed to have asked him / if the
Apocrypha scripture / and notes which were in it / were the word of God: but
Cant. belike suspecting some such matter would not suffer me to look into it /
to whom then I answered that that book was not the eternal Word of God / that
eternal God himself / by whom only I must swear / and not by any books or
Bibles.


Cant. So you shall swear by God.


Bar. To what purpose then is this book urged? I may swear by nothing besides
him / nor by nothing with him.


Winch. How prove you that?


B. It is so commanded in the book of the law. Deuteronomy. 6. and 10. Chapt. so
expounded by sundry of the prophets / by Christ himself and his Apostles.


Cant. Well will you swear that you will answer nothing but the truth / and the
whole truth / to such Interr. as we shall demand of you?


B. I have learned to know the matter before I either swear or answer.


Cant. Set down that he will not swear.


L. E. Justice. You shall only swear to answer the truth: if any unlawful
thing be demanded of you / you need not answer.


B. My Lord / every truth requires not an oath / there must great regard and
reverence be used in an oath / and an oath for confirmation ought to be the
end of al strife: My Lo. if I should err / and deliver it upon mine oath for
truth / it were a double sin / likewise if I should either not know / not
remember / or not utter the whole truth / I were by such a rash oath forsworn:
But by Gods grace I will answer nothing but the truth.


Cant. A Christian man's word ought to be as true as his oath / we will proceed
with you without your oath / (and taking a paper of Interr. in his hand / said)
what say you to this. Is it lawful to say the Pater noster publicly in the
church / or privately / as a prayer or no?


B. I know not what you mean by your Pater noster / unless peradventure that
form for prayer which our savior Christ taught his disciples / commonly
called the Lords prayer.


Cant. I so mean. Then commanded he the first question to be thus written.
Quest. 1. Whither he thinks the Lords prayer may publicly in the Church /
or privately be used as a prayer or no? (When I had expressed my mind / the
Arch B. commanded it should be recorded: but I desired the judges that I might
with my own hand write my own answers / which was granted me.) My answer
then to the first question was. Ans. It is to be used to that end for which it
was given by our savior Christ to his disciples / as a sununarie groundworke
or foundation of al faithful prayers / whereby to instruct and assure their
consciences / that their petitions are according to the will and glory of God:
But that these prescript words are i^io^ned / or that Christ (...) in the
scripture. Moreover I see not how it can be used as a prayer / seeing that our
particular wantes and present occasions and necessitie^ / are not therein
expressed. And therefore I think it not to be used as a prayer. (Here the Arch
B. cried out for brevity / and would not suffer me to answer any more
questions at large.) Quest. 2. Wither he thinks that any Leitourgies / or
prescript forms of prayer may be imposed upon the church: and whither al read
and stinted prayers be mere babbling in Gods sight? Ans. I find in the word of
God (...) such authority given to any man / neither such stinted leitourgies
prescribed or used in the primitive churches: and therefore hold it high
presumtion to impose any one devised Apocrypha prayer upon the church.

Q. 3. Whither he thinks that the common prayers commanded by the public
authority of this land / be idolatrous superstitious and popish? A. I think
that this book of common prayer publicly enjoined and received in the
assemblies of this land / is well nigh altogether idolatrous superstitious and
popish. Q. 4. Whither he thinks that the Sacraments which are publikly
administered in the church of England be true Sacraments or no? A. I think
that the Sacraments as they are ministered in these public assemblies / are
not true Sacraments: and seal not the favor and blessing of God unto them.
Q. 5. Whither he thinks that the laws and government of the church of England
now by authority established be unlawful and Antichristian / or no? A. Because
the laws decrees and canons of your church are so many and infinite / I can
not judge of them al / because I know not al: but this I say / that many of
them / as also your Ecclesiastical courts and governors / are unlawful and
Antichristian. Q. 6. Whither he thinks that such as have been baptized in the
church of England / since Queen Elisabethes reign / have been rightly
baptized / or ought to be baptized again? A. I think as before of yowr
Sacraments / that they have not been rightly baptized / according to the
institution of Christ: Yet that they need not / neither ought to be baptized
again. (I doubt least the Arch B. hearing my answer of rebaptising / caused it
to be left out of the question and my answer / taking that which might best
serve their own turn / to bring us into suspicion of error / and hatred.
Hereunto many speeches arising of the true and false Sacraments / ministry /
government / as also of the true and false church: I showed that the false
church had also her Sacraments ministry / government / though not aright. Then
Judge Anderson caused this question to be moved to me. Q 7. Whither the church
of England as it stands now established / be the true established church of
Christ: and whither the people therein / be the true and faithful people of God
/ or no. A. I think that these parish assemblies as they stand generally in
England / are not the true established churches of Christ: and that the people
as they now stand in this disorder and confusion in them / are not to be held
the true and faithful people of Christ. Here the Judge Anderson took exception
(as the B. of Land. also) at these words (parish assemblies.) I answered the
Judge / that I could not for some weighty respects spare him that word: for I
doubted not / but that the Lord had many precious and elect vessels among them
/ whom he will in his good time call forth / whom it became not me absolutely to
judge least I should enter into Gods seat: Yet I could not in the mean time
whiles they stand members of these assemblies / count them faithful. To the B.
I said / that when they should better consider of mine answer / they should
have less cause to find fault. Much trouble we had before we could agree of
the state and words of their questions / with putting out and changing / which
discourses it is not my purpose here to set down so much as the questions and
answers agreed upon and recorded: although (...) some causes known to my self
/ and to some of their consciences which may hereafter be known to all the
world / I thought it not imper^^nent to insert this. Q 8. Whither he thinks
the Queens majesty be supreme governor of the church: and whither she may
ma^e laws for the church / which are not contrary to the word of God / or no?
A. I think the Queens majesty svpreme governor of the whole land / and over
the church also / bodies and goods: but I think that no Prince / neither the
whole world / neither the chvrch / it self may make any laws for the church /
other then Christ has already left in his word. Yet I think it the duty of
every Christian / and principally of the Prince / to enquire out and re^^e the
laws of God / and stir up al their subjects to more diligent and careful
keeping of the same. A^ we had much a do to come to the state of this question
/ so the (...) showed themselves evil satisfied with my answer / and said that
the Papists dealt more simply then I did: and surely they very greevouslie
interrupted me with slanders / evil speeches and blasphemes / during the time
of my writing these answers / especially the B of Land. so that I was even
enforced sometime to turn unto him and show him of his shameless untruths
and slanders. The chief justice of Engl. here said that he thought I answered
very directly and compendiously. Here again / upon some speech that arose /
the Judge Anderson asked me whither I thought it lawful to hang a thief or no?
I answered that there were many kind of thieves / as sacrilegious thieves / men
stealers etc. that these ought by the laws of God to die. Then he said he
meant ordinary thieves of goods and chattels. I said / that God in the law had
ordained an other kind of punishment for such / whereupon the Bb. framed this
question. Q. 9. Whither it be lawful for the Prince to alter the judicial law
of Moses / according to the state of her country and policy / or no? A. I
ought to be wise in sobriety / and not to answer more then I know. Great doubt
and controversy has been about this question a long time / but for my part I
can not see / that any more of the judicial law was or can be abrogated by any
mortal man or country / upon what occasion soever / then belonged to the
ceremonial law and worship of the Temple / for which we have received other
laws and worship in Christ's testament: but that the judgments due and set
down by God for the transgression of the moral law / cannot be changed or
altered / without injury to the moral law and God himself. Yet this / as al my
other answers by protestation / that if any man can better instruct me therein
by the word of God / I am always ready to change my mind. Whereupon the chief
Justice of Engl. said I spoke well: and therefore said if I were in doubt / mine
answer ought not to be taken. I said / I doubted not / but had set down my
mind. Yet the Bbs. because my answer fitted not their turns / as I think /
commanded the question and answer to be blotted out. Q. 10 Whither he thinks
that any private man may take upon him to reform / if the Prince will not / or
neglect. (I asked whither they meant of a public reformation of the state / or
of a private or personal reformation of himself and his family: it was said /
of a public reformation) A. I think that no man may intermedle with the
Princes office / without lawful calling thereunto: and therefore it is utterly
unlawful for any private man to reform the state / without his good liking and
license / because the Prince shall account for the defaultes of his public
government / and not private men / so they be not guilty with the Prince in his
offenses / but abstain and keep them selves pure from doing or consenting to
any unlawful thing commanded by the Prince / which they must do as they
tender their own salvation. Q. 11. Whither he thinks that every parish or
particular church ought to have a Presbytery? A. The holy government of Christ
belongs not to the profane or unbelieving / neither can it without manifest
sacrilege be set over these parishes as they now stand in confusion / no
difference made betwixt the faithful and unbelieving / al being in differently
received into the body of the church: but over every particular congregation of
Christ there ought to be an eldership / and every such congregation ought to
their utter most power to endeavor thervn^^. Now was I dismissed / and
committed again to my keeper / with straight charge that no man might speak to
me. During this time / others of my brethren were examined / which being done /
I was called for in unto them where Cant. showed me the statute of supremacy /
and asked me if I would take an oath according to the same. I said that in that
form I could not / neither could I swear to such successors as I knew not:
but to her Majesty / I acknowledged her authority as I had expressed in my
article and protested my life in defense of her person prerogative and dignity
loyally against al foreme and domestical enemies whither spiritual or temporal.
The Arch B. said / that the Papists made a better and more dutiful oath then
this. I said it was not true / they denied not / neither defied the Pope: but I
was ready to give and perform as much unto my Prince as any true subject ought
to do. He asked me again whither the church of Christ / if the Pruite deny or
refuse to neglect abuses / may without staying for the Prince reform them? I
said / that it might and ought though all the Princes of the world should
prohibit the same upon pain of death. He asked me again whither the church of
Christ might excommunicate the Prince / and who should pronounce it? I said /
that sin obstinatly stood in / did excommunicate / and that the church ought to
have judgeme^t ready against every transgression without respect of persons /
and that the Pastor of the church ought to pronounce it / and alleged that
excommunication / was given unto the church as the only and last remedy for
the salvation of the party in such cases / and that the neglect thereof was
both the neglect of Gods judgments / their duty / and the Princes salvation:
and that they might as well take away al admonitions and reprehensions from
Princes / and so Princes were in a most miserable case. These my answers were
not written with mine own hand / but by the Register: And so was I sent again
with more commandments yet to keep me more straightly. I requested at both
times a copy of my answers / but the Arch B. denied it me.

Upon the 18. day of the 3. month / I Henry Barrowe close prisoner in the
ffleet / was sent for in all post have / by one ^agland a Gent. of the L.
Chancellors to his Lords chamber at the court at White Hall: where being
arrived / I found in a withdrawing chamber / 12. of the brethren / among a
great number of other attendances / with whom I could not have any one word:
But after that ^^gland had signified my coming / I was forthwith sent for into
that chamber / where sat at the board the Arch B. in his pontificalibus / the
L. Chancellor / the L. Treasurer / the L. Buchhurst / the B. of Land. in his
pontificalibus: at the lower end of the chamber stood Dr. Some / Justice Young
and others.

BEing kneeled down at the end of the table / the L. Treasurer began and
asked me my name: which when I had told him he asked me if I had not been
sometime of the court: I answered / that I had sometime freque^ted the court:
he said he remembered me not.


L. Treas. Why are you in prison Barrowe?


B. I am in prison my Lo. upon the statute made for recusantes.


L. Treas. Why will you not go to church?


B. My whole desire is to come to the church of God.


L. Tree. Thou art a fantastical fellow I see / but why not to our churches?


B. My Lo. the causes are great and many / it were too long to show them in
particular: but briefly my Lo. I can not come to your church / because all the
profane and wicked of the land are received into the body of your church / 2.
You have a false and Antichristian ministry set over your church. 3. Neither
worship you God aright / but after an jdolatrous and superstitious manner: 4.
and your church is not governed by Christ's Testament / but by the Romish
courts and canons / etc.


L. Tr. Here is matter enough in deed: I perceive thou take delight to be an
author of this new religion. The L. Chanc. said he never heard such stuff
before in all his life.


B. As I was about to show that neither I was an author of this religion and
that it was not new as they supposed: the B. of Lo. interrupted me / and asked
me wherein their worship was jdolatrous? The L. Treas. also demanded the same
question.


B. There is nothing else in that book of your common prayer: being demanded
some particulers / I showed that their saints days / eues / fastes / idol
feasts / etc.


Land. Stay there: why / is it not lawful to keep a memorial of the Saints in
the church?


B. Not after your manner: it is jdolarrie.


Land. How prove now that?


B. By the 1. commandment.


Land. Why / that is / thou shall have no other Gods but me. What of that?


B. The word is / Thou shall have no other Gods before m^ face. We are therefore
forbidden to give any part of Gods worship to any creature.


Land. Why / neither do we.


B. Yes / you celebrate a day / and sanctify an eaue / and call them by their
names / you make a feast / and devise a worship unto them.


L. Tr. Why / may we not call the day after their names? is not that in our
liberty?


B. No my Lord.


L. Tr. How prove you that?


B In the beginning of the book it is written that God himself named all the
days / the first the second / etc.


L. Tr. Why then we may not call them Sunday / Monday etc.


B. We are otherwise taught to call them in the book of God.


L. Tr. Why thou they self call it the Lords day.


B. And so the holy Ghost calls it in the ^. of the Revelation.


Land. We have nothing in our saints days / but that which is taken forth of
the Scriptures.


B. In that you say true / for you find no Saints days in the Scriptures.


Land. We find their Histories and deeds in the Scripture.


B. But not their days and festiuals in the Scripture. The Lo. Buckh. then
said / I was a proud spirit. The L. Treas. said I had a hot brain: and
taking into his hand a book of common prayer / which lay on the board / read
certain of the collectes for the Sainte^ (...) Scripture: and asked me what I
could (...) therein?


B. I mislike al for we ought not so to use Scriptures or prayers.


Land. May we not make commemoration of the saints fiues in the church.


B. Not after yowr manner / to give peculier days / eues / fastes / worship /
feasts unto them.


L. Tr. But what is there jdolatrous?


B. Al / for we ought not so to use the Scriptures.


Land. What not in commemoration of the Saints?


B. As I have said not after yowr manner.


L. Tr. But what is evil here?


B. All my Lo. for by abusing the Scripture we may make it an jdol The
circumstantes make evil things / of themselves good / as in the mass^^ook from
whence this stuff is fetched / there are sundry good collectes and places of
scripture which their superstitious abuse make abominable and evil. Likewise
coniurers make many good prayers which the circumstances also make evil. Here
the Lo. Buckh. said I was out of my wits.


B. No my Lo. I speak the words of sobernes and truth as I could make plain
if I might be suffered.


L. Tr. Here we pray / that our lives may be such as theirs was void of
covetousness


B. So ought we to do / and not to read or have any part of the scripture
without fruit / and to follow and flee that which we find praised and
discommended in them: yet ought we not to use the scriptures in this manner to
days and times / neither to be thus restreyned or stinted in our prayers / as
to be tied to this form of words / place / time / manner / kneel / stand etc.


L. Buckh. This fellow delights to hear himself speak.

(The L. Chanc. also spoke some what at that time / which I cannot call to
remembrance as yet) Then the Arch B. also spoke many things against me / of
small effect / which I have also forgotten / only this I remember he said / I
was and strower of errors / and that therefore he committed me.


B. In deed you committed me half a year close prisoner in the Gatehowse /
and I never until now understood the cause why / neither as yet know I what
errors they be / show them therefore I pray you. The L. Buckh. again said I was
a presumtuous spirit.


B. My Lo. al spirits must be tried and judged by the word of God: but if I
err my Lo. it is meet I should be showed wherein.


L. Chanc. There must be streighter laws made for such fellows.


B. Would to God there were my Lo. our iourny should be the shorter.


L. Tr. You complained to us of injustice / wherein have you wrong?


B. My Lo. in that we are thus imprisoned without due trial.


L. Tr. Why / you said you were condemned upon the statute.


B Unjustly my Lo. that statute was not made for us.


L. Tr. There must be streighter laws made for you.


B. O my Lo. speak more comfortablie / we have sorrows enough.


L. Tr. In deed thou look as if thou had a troubled conscience.


B. No I praise God for it. but (...) wen against her faithful subjects. The
L. Tr. answered that the Queens sword was not as yet drawn against us. Then
in a word or two I complaining of the misery and lingering close imprisonment
which we suffer: the L. Tr: demanded if we had had no conference. The B. of
Land. answered that sundry had been with us* as D. Some / Grauiat and others /
but we mocked them that came unto us.


B. That is not true / the Lord knows: we mock no creature. Neither do I
know / or have ever seen / to my remembrance / that Grauiat you speak of. But
miserable physicians are you al / for Mr. Some he indeed was with me but never
would enter disputation: he said / he came not therefore / but in reasoning
manner to know some what of my mind more clearly. Some was then by the Arch B.
called / and demanded whither we had conference or no? Some showed how that at
our last conference before Sr. A. G. there arose a question betwirt us / whither
the Prince might make a positive law / de rebus me^ijs of things indifferent:
I denying it / he asked me whither she migt make a statute for the reforming
excess of apparel? I granted that she might. He then said it was a doctrine
of Divils to forbid meat by a positive law: he showed me then that the Princes
law did not bind the conscience / and that there is a difference betwirt forum
civil and forum conscientiae. Some to this effect. Mr. Young then uncalled
came / and accused me of irreverent speeches used against his Lords grace / at
my first conference with Some in my chamber: so they were dismissed. Then I
beseeched the L^s. to grant a public conference / that it might appear^ to
al men / what we held / and where we erred. The Arch B. in great choler said /
we should have no public conference / we had published to much already / and
therefore he now committed us close prisoners.


B. But contrary to law. The L. Tr. said / it might be upon such occasions done
by law: and asked whither I had any learning? Cant. and Land. with one consent
answered together that I had no learning.


B. The Lord knows I am ignorant / I have no learning to boast of: but this I
know / that you are void of al true learning and godliness.


L. Buckh. See the spirit of this man. Then requested I conference again / and
that in writing: which was again by Cant. very peremtorilie denied. He said
that he had matter to call me before him for an heretic.


B. That shall you never do: you know my former answer to that matter: well err
I may / but heretic / by the grace of God will I never be.


L. Buckh. That is well said. The L. Tr: then taking up a paper of Somes
abstract questions / which lay among the Bs evidence against me / read this:
That I held it unlawful to enacte a law that the ministers shall live by tithes
/ or the people pay them: and demanded of me whither I held tithes unlawful?


B. My Lo. they are abrogated and unlawful.


L. Tr. Why / tho^^ would (...) have the (...) of somewhat / whereof should
he (...)?


B. Ex pura eleemosyna, of clear alms as Christ in his Testament has ordained
/ and as he and his Apostles.


L. Tr. But how if the people will not give?


B. Such are not the people of God.


L. Tr. But what shall the ministers do in the mean time?


B. Not stand a minister to such / neither take the goods of the profane.


L. Tr. Where can thou show me now in the Scriptures that the ministers now
ought not to live upon tithes?


B. I took the bible and turned to these two places. Heb. 7 / 12. Gal. 6 / 6.
in the one where tithes are abrogate: in the other / that an other provision is
made for them.


Land. began the ^auil at the words / pure and clear alms: Cant. at the
place in the Hebr. saying that the authors intent was to prove an abrogation of
the preisthod.


B. Why / the words of the text are these: If the preisthod be changed / then
of necessity must there be a change of the law: and you cannot deny but that
tithes were a part of that law: alleging / Number. 18.


L. Tr. What / would thou have him to have al my goods?


B. No my Lo. but I would have you to withhold none of your goods from helping
him: neither rich nor pore are exemted from this duty. ffurder I showed / that
if the minister had things necessary / as food and rapment / he ought to hold
him self contented: neither ought the church to give him more. Then had we some
talk concerning the word Priest: the L. Tr. said that the ministers now were
not to be called preistes.


B. If they receive tithes they are preistes. Moreover they be called preistes
in the law.


Land. Why / what is the word presbyter / I pray you?


B. An elder.


Land. What in age only?


B. No / Timothy was a young man.


Land. Presbyter is latin for a priest.


B. It is no latin word / but derived / and signifies the same which the
greek word does / which is an Elder. Lon. what make thou a priest? B. Him
that does offer sacrifices / for so it is written every where in the law. As we
were thus reasoning / the L. Chanc. asked me if I knew not those two men

(pointing to Cant. and Land.)
B. Yes my Lo. I have cause to know them.


L. Chanc. But what is not this the Bp. of London?


B. I know him for no Bishop my Lo.


L. Chapter What is he then?


B. His name is Elmar my Lo.

(The Lord pardon my fault / that I laid him not open for a wolf / a bloody
persecutor and Apostata. But by this time / the Wardens man plucked me up.)
L. Chanc. What is that man?

(pointing to Cant.)
B. The Lord gave me the spirit of boldness / so that I answered: He is a
monster / a miserable compound / I know not what to make him: he is neither
Ecclesiastical nor civil / even that second Beast spoken of in the Revelation.


L. Treas. Where is that place / show it.


B. So I turned to the 13. Chap. and began at the 11. verse / and read a little.
Then I turned to 2. These. 2. But the Beast / arose for anger / gnashing his
teeth / and said / wis you suffer him my Lords? So I was plucked up by the
Wardens man from my ^nees / and carried away. As I was ^e parting / I desired
the Lo. Treas. that I might have the liberty of the air / but had no answer:
and I prayed the Lord to bless their honors. So I was led forth by an other
way then I came in / that I might not see the brethren / nor they me. This is
the effect / so near as my evil memory could carry away / the very words that
were used to me and by me in that place. The Lord pardon my unworthiness / and
unsanctified heart and mouth / which can bring no glory to the Lord / or
benefit to his church: but rather reproach to the one / and affliction to the
other. But the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of tentation / and to
reserve the unjust until the day of judgment under punishment. The L. Treas.
admonished me / and told me that I took the Lords name often in vain: I have
forgotten upon what occasion he spoke it. But I beseech the Lord that I may not
forget this his good admonition / but may set a more careful watch before my
lips: for sure no doubt I am greatly guilty that way / and never use his
holy name with that reverence I ought.


THe answers of John Grenewood / at London palace / before the 2. L. chief
Justices of Engl. the Mr. of the Rolls / the L. chief Baron / together with
the Arch B. of Cant. the B. of Land. the B. of Winch. with others: to certain
interrogatories as follows.
Q. WHat is your name? A. John. Grenewood. Q. Lay yowr hand vpen the book / you
must take an oath. A. I will swear by the name of God if there be any need / but
not by or upon a book. Q. We will then examine you without an oath. Are you a
minister? A. No / I was one after your orders. Q. Who disgraded you? A. I
disgraded my self through Gods mercy by repentance. (then after many words /
they brought forth a paper containing certain articles in manner of questions
as follows) Q. Is is lawful to use the Lords prayer publicly or privately as
a prayer / or no? A. It is a doctrine to direct al our prayers by: but seeing it
conteyneth the doctrine of the holy Scripture / no man can use the same as a
private or public prayer / because he has not present need to ask all the
peticions therein contained / at one time: neither can comprehend them with
feeling and faith. Q. Is it lawful or no? I will hear no prattling. A. It is not
lawful for any thing I can see by the Scripture for there is no commandment to
say the very words over: and Christ and his Apostles prayed in other words
according to their present necessity. Q. Is it lawful to use any stinted
prayers either publicly or privately in prayer? A. They are Apocrypha / and may
not be used in the public assembly: the word / and the graces of Gods spirit
/ are only to be used there. Q. Answer directly / is it lawful to use them
publicly or privately? A. Paul says in Romans 8. the spirit of God makes
request for us / and, that we know not what to ask / but the spirit helps
our infirmities Q. Answer directly. A. It is not lawful to use stinted prayers
invented by man / either publicly or privately for any thing I can see by the
Scriptures. Q. What say you then to the book of common prayer / is it
superstitious popish and idolatrous / yea or no? A. I beseech you that I may
not be urged by your law: I have thus long been close prisoner / and therefore
desire you to show me wherefore / and not now to entangle me by your law. Q. Is
it not yowr law now as well as ours: it is the Queens law: You are a good
subject. A. I am obedient as a true subject. But I took it we had reasoned of
your popish canons. Q. Is not the common prayer book / established by the
Queens law?

L. Chief Just. Tell us what you think of the book of common prayer / you shall
have liberty to calback what you will again. A. If it were in free conference
/ as it has been often desired by us / I would so do.


Winch. Have you not used these words a year a go / that it was popish
superstitious and idolatrous? A. Yes I thinc^ I have: for it was taken out of
the Popes portuis. Q. Why would you not answer so before? A. Because I see you
go about to bring me with in the compass of the law.


I. Anderson. What say you now to (...)? A. That there ar many errors in it /
and the form thereof is disagreeable to the Scriptures.


Arch B. Is it contrary to the Scriptures. A. It must needs be contrary if it
be disagreable.


Winch. Whither hold you it idolatrous / superstitious and popish? A. I have
answered what I think of it: I hold it full of errors / and the form thereof
disagreable to the Scriptures. Q. What say you for marriage: did not you marie
one Boman and his wife* in the Fleet? A. No / neither is marriage a part of the
ministers office. Q. Who did use prayer? A. I think / I did at that time use
prayer. Q. Who joined their hands together? A. I know no such thing / they did
publicly acknowledge their consent before the assembly.


Sta^^p. I will make them do penance for it. A. There be some had more need show
open repentance then they.


B. They may make such marriages under a hedge / and it has been along received
order to be married by the minister. A. No / there were many faithful witnesses
of their consentes: and if it were not lawful / we have many examples of the
ancient fathers / who by your judgment did amiss. Q. What say you to the
church of England / is it a true established church of God? A. The whole common
wealth is not a church.


I. Anders. But do you know any true established church in the land? A. If I
did / I would not accuse them unto you. Q. But what say you / is not the whole
land as it stands now ordered / a true established church? A. No / not as the
assemblies are generally ordered / if it please you / I will show you the
reasons.


L C. Just. No / you shall have enough hereafter to show the reasons / it is not
now to be stood upon. Q. What do you say to the church of England as it is now
guided by Bbs. is it Antichristian? A. Bp such Bs. and laws as it is now
guided / it is not according to the Scriptures.


Winch. Thou have Scriptures often in thy mouth: is it then Antichristian. A.
Yea / I hold it contrary to Christ's word. Q. What say you to the Sacraments
then / are they true Sacraments? A. No / they are neither rightly administered
according to Christ's institution / neither have promise of grace / because you
keep not the covenant. Q. Speak plainly / are they true Sacraments or no? A.
No / if you have no true church y^w can have no true Sacraments. Q. How say
you / are we baptized? A. Yea / you have the outward sign which is the washing
/ but no true Sacrament. Q. How can that be? A. Very well. (then I thought to
have showed reasons / but I could not be suffered.) Q. Is it lawful Baptism? A.
Yea. Q. Need we then to be baptized again if we had that ministry and
government you speak of? A. No. Q. Should we be baptized at al? A. Yea / or else
if we contenme it / we deny the profession of grace. Q. Do you hold it lawful
to baptize children? A. Yea / I am no Anabaptist I thank God. Q. How far
differ you? A. So far as truth from errors. Q. You have a boy unbaptized / how
old is he? A. A year and a half. Q. What is his name? A. Abel. Q. Who gave
him that name? A. Myself / being father. Q. Why has he not been baptized? A.
Because that I have been in prison / and cannot tell where to go to a reformed
church / where I might have him baptized according to Gods ordinance. Q. Will you
go to church to S^. Brides? A. I know no such church. Q. Will you go to Paul's?
A. No. Q. Do you not hold a parish / the church? A. If all the people were
faithful having Gods law and ordinances practiced amongst them / I do. Q. Then
you hold that the parish / do not make it a church? A. No / but the profession
which the people make. Q. Do you hold that the church ought to be governed by
a Presbytery? A. Yea / every congregation of Christ ought to be governed by
that Presbytery which Christ has appointed. Q. What are those officers? A.
Pastor / Teacher / Elder / etc. Q. And by no other? A. No / by no other then
Christ has appointed. Q. May this people and presbytery reform such things
as be amiss without the Prince? A. They ought to practice Gods laws / and
correct vice br the censure of the word. Q. What if the Prince forbid them? A.
They must do that which God commands nevertheless. Q. If the Prince do
offend / whither may the presbytery excommunicate the Prince or no? A. The
wole church may excommunicate any member of that congregation, If the party
continue obstinate in open transgression. Q. Whither may the Prince be
excommunicate? A. There is no exception of person: and I doubt not but her
majesty would be ruled by the word / for it is not the men / but the word of
God which binds and loses sin. Q. Whither may the Prince make laws in
the government of the church / or no? A. The Scripture has set down sufficient
laws for the worship of God / and government of the church / to which no man
may add or diminish. Q. What say you to the Princes supremacy / is her
majesty supreme head of the church: over al causes / as well ecclesiastical as
temporal? A. A supreme magistr^^^ over al persons to punish the evil and defend
the good. Q. Ever al causes? etc. A. No / Christ is only head of his church
and his laws may no man alter. Q. The pope gives th^^ much to the Prince. A.
No / that he does not / he sets himself above Princes and exempteth his
preisthod from the magestrates sword. Q. What say you to the oath of the
Queens supremacy / will you answer to it? If these ecclesiastical orders be
meant such as be agreeable unto the scriptures / I will / for I deny al
foreign power. Q. It is meant / the order and government with all the laws in
the church as it is now established. A Then I will not answer to approve thereof.


A brief sum of the examination of John Penrie / by the right worshipful Mr.
Fanshaw / and Mr. Justice Young the 10. of the fourth moves April. 1593.
Fansh. IT is strange unto me / that you hold such opinions (Penry) as none of
the learned of this age / or any of the martyrs of former times mainterned. Can
you show any writers / either old or new / that have been of your judgment?


Penr. I hold nothing / but what I will be bound to prove out of the written word
of God / and will show in regard of the special points controverted / to have
been mainteyned by the holy martyrs of this land / who first assailed the
Babylonis^* Roman kingdom / as namely by Mr. Wicliffe / Mr. Brute / Mr.
Purvey / Mr. White etc. with many other the famous witnesses and martyrs of
Christ in former times: and by Mr. Tindal / Mr. Lambert / Mr. Barnes / Mr.
Lat^^er etc. the lords most blessed witnesses of this latter age. I spea^
nothing here of the doctrine and practice of the reformed churches mother
countries whom I have wholly of my side / in the controversies of greatest
moment.


F. But do the martyrs teach you that there is no church of Christ in England?


P. If you mean by a church (as the most do) that public profession whereby
men do profess salvation to be had by the death and righteousness of Jesus
Christ / I am free from denping any church of Christ to be in this land: for I
know the doctrine touching the holy trinity / the natures and offices of the
Lord Jesus / free justification by him / both the Sacraments / etc. published
by her majesty's authority and commanded by her laws / to be the Lords
blessed and undoubted truths / without the knowledge and profession whereof no
salvation is to be had.


F. Seeing you acknowledge that her majesty has established the truth in so
many weighty pomtes / seeing she has commanded the true Sacraments to be
administered: what mislike you in our church / and why will you not be partaker
of these truths and Sacraments with us.


P. I mislike / 1. the false ecc^estastical offices / 2. the manner of caling
unto the offices / 3. a great part of the works wherein these false officers
are employed / 4. the maintenance or livinges / whereby they are mainteyned in
their offices: al which / I will be bound to prove (by the Lords help) to be
derived / not from Jesus Christ / but from the kingdom of Antichrist his great
enemy. And therefore for as much as I cannot be partaker of the former holy
things of God / but I must be subject unto the power of Antichrist in these
officers / and known by those marks whereby his subjects are noted / therefore
I am enforced and bound to seek the comfort of the word and Sacraments / where
I may have them without the submitting of my self unto any ecclesiastical power
in religion / save only unto that which is derived from Christ Jesus the Lord
/ in whom al fulness of power dwells / (Col. 1. 19.) and from whom al those
must derive their power and office / unto whom the saints of God are to
submit their consciences to be wrought upon in religion. Again / seeing the
forenamed 4. enormities of this church / are marks which properly belong unto
the kingdom of the Beast / viz. of the Roman Antichrist / we dare not have
any communion and fellowship with them / nor be known by them / least we
should be partakers of those most fearful and most dreadful judgments / which
are denounced by the spirit of God / against al those that have communion with
any of the irreligious inventions of that Beast. Revel. 14 / 9. 10. These are
the things / together with the want of Christ's true order / which I
especially mislike / and the special causes why I dare not join with the
assemblies of this Land. 1. the false offices whereby these assemblies are
guided / and by whom the whole worship is performed in them: 2. their manner of
caling / 3. a great part of the devised works wherein these officers are
conversant. 4. the livinges consecrated sometimes unto Idols for the most part
/ whereby they are sustained in their offices.


F. What offices mean you?


P. I mean the offices of Lord Arch Bbs. and Bbs. Archdeatons / Commissaries /
Chancellors / Oeanes / Canons / Prebendaries / Preistes / Deacons / etc. Al
which / properly belong to no other body either (...) or (...) / but only
unto the Romish Church / wh^^^ they were first invented / where they now are /
and by whom they were left in this land / when the head of that body the Pope
and some other of his members were cast out by her majesty / and our
sovereign Lord her noble father. The church of Christ is perfect without them
/ in all her offices: the civil state is absolute without them / for they are
ecclesiastical: Heathen idolatry has them not / and requires them not /
only the kingdom of Antichrist can in no wise be whole and entire without
them / whereof (as I say) they are visible and known members. Now if it be not
lawful for me / or any other member of Christ / to be subject unto the orders
and ceremonies of the old law as circumcision / etc. Which sometimes were the
Lords own blessed ordinances: how can it be but sin unto us to be subject to
the constitutions of Antichrist / the maine adversary of the Lo. Jesus? The
Lord has not delivered us from the Yoke of his own law / that we should be in
bondage unto the inventions and order of Antichrists kingdom and offices.


F. Belike you would have no other offices in the church now in the time of
peace and prosperity / then were in the Apostles days under persecution?


P. There is great reason we should not: for if the order left by Moses in the
church: was not to be altered / to be diminished or added unto / except it were
by special commandment from the Lord: (1. Chron. 28 / 19.) then may not any
man or Angel / but upon the same warrant / add any thing unto that holy form
/ which the son of God left for the ordering of his own house: for / as the
Apostle says / Hebr. 3 / 3. he / (Yea and his ordinances) are worthy of more
honor then Moses his were. And he that adds unto the words of this book /
that is / to the true order of the church / and pure worship of God contained
therein / the Lord God will add unto him of the plagues that are written in this
book / says the spirit of God. Revel. 22 / 19.


F. You allow of M. Luther / I am sure / what office had he?


P. He was first a moncke / and so a member (by his office) of the kingdom of
Antichrist / even a good while after the Lord had used him as a notable
instrument to overthrow that kingdom / afterward he was utterly disgraded and
deprived of al offices / so that as the spirit of God says (Reu. 13. 17.) he
could neither buy nor sell by virtue of any liberty or freedom that he had
within the kingdom of the Beast. And by this means in the Lords great favor
/ he carried not in this regard any of the Beasts marks / he was not of his
name / nor of the number of his name: he denied himself to belong to that
kingdom of Satan / and that malignant church utterly refused him to be any of
her body and members. Since his excommunication and degradation by the Romish /
church / he names himself Ecclesiasten, in a book of his so (...) / that is a
preacher of Christ's blessed truth and gospel. Now whither he preached by
virtue of a lawful office whereunto he was called in the church of Christ / or
whither he taught b^ virtue of his gifts / and the opportunity which he had
to manifest the truth / having neither time nor leisure / nor yet thinking it
needful (it mar. be) to consider by what office he did it / I know not: of this
I am assured / that he was one of the famous and glorious witnesses of the Lo.
Jesus / raised up to testify on his behalf / against the abominations of the
kingdom of Antichrist: and I am assured that by his tongue and pen the Lo.
appeared glorioussie in the power of his gospel / to the consumption of that
man of sin. (2. These. 2 / 8.) Of his office I judge the best / as of a matter
unknown unto me / that is / I think him to have had a pastoral office in the
church of Wittemberg / whither he had or not / his example is no law for the
church to walk by / it is Chr. Jesus alone that we must hear and follow /
according to his will and word must we frame our walking / and if it be an Angel
from heaven that will draw us to swerve from the same / we dare not give ear
unto him. Gal. 1. 8. 9.


F. And what office had you in power church / which meet in woods and I know not
where?


P. I have no office in that pore congregation: and as for our meetinges either
in woods or any where else / we have the example of our savior Christ / of his
church and servantes in all ages / for our warrant: it is against our wills
that we go into woods / or secret places: as we are not ashamed of the gospel
of Christ / so our desire is to profess the same openly / we are ready before
men and Angels / to show and to justify our meetings and our behavior in them
/ desiring earnestly that we may have peace and queietnes to serve our God even
before al men / that they may be witnesses of our upright walking toward our
God and all the world / especially toward our Prince and country. We know that
meeting in woods / in taues / in mountains / etc. is a part of the cross and
baseness of the gospel / whereat it is easy for the natural man to stumble: but
we are gladly partakers of this mean estate for the Lords sacred verity: and
the question should not be so much where we meet / as what we do in our
meetings / whither our meetings and doings he warranted by the word or not /
and what enforced us to meet in these places.


F. We will speak of yr unlawful assemblies afterward: but what caling have you
to preach / were you never made minister according to the order of this land?


P. I might / if I had been willing / have been made either Deacon or priest /
but I thank the Lo. I ever disliked those popish orders / and if I had taken
them / I would utterly refuse them / and not stand by them at any hand. I have
taught publicly in the church of Scotland, being thereunto desired earnestly /
and called by the order of that church: charge I never had any / and therefore I
never bare office either there or in any other church.


F. Did not you preach in these your secret meetings: what war it have you so
to do / if you have no public office in your church?


P. Whither I did or not / I do not tell you for the present: But this I say /
that if the same poor congregation desired to have the use of my small gifts
for the instruction and consolation thereof I would being thereunto prepared /
most willingly bestow my poor tale^t to their mutual edification and mine.


F. And may you teach in the church publicly / having no public office therein?


P. I may because I am a member thereof / and requested thereunto by the church /
and judged to be endued in some measure with gifts meet for the handling of
the Lords sacred word. The body of Christ / (that is every particular
congregation of the church) ought to have the use of all the gifts that are in
any member thereof and the member cannot deny unto the body the use of those
graces wherewith it is furnished / except it will break the law^^ and order of
the body and become unnatural / unto the same. Romans 12. 1. Cor. 12.


F. Then every one that will may preach the word in your assembly?


P. Not so for we hold it merely unlawful yea tending to the Anabaptistical
inversion of al good order in the church / for any man to intermedle with the
Lords holy truth / beyond the bounds of his gifts: or pet for him that is
endued with gifts / to preach or teach in the church / except he be desired /
and caled thereunto by the body.


F. But may any preach / that has not an office in the church so to do?


P. Yea that he may / and the word of God binds him to preach / whosoever he
be that intends to become a Pastor or Teacher in the church of Christ /
before he take his office upon him / and binds the church to take the trial
of his gifts before they give him his office / least otherwise he should not
be meet for it / or at the least / that hands should not be suddenly laid upon
him. 1. Tim. 3 / 10. and 5 / 23.


F. What office has he all this while?


P. No other office then every member of the body has / who are bound to have
their several operation in the body according to that measure of grace which
they derive from their head the Lo. Jesus / by the power of his spirit working
in them / Romans 12. 3 / 4. The word caleth these by the name of prophets / not
such as do foretell things to come / but those who are furnished with graces
meet for the interpretation and application of the word unto the edification
and comfort of the church / as the Apostle teaches us expressly 1. Corint.
14. and therefore mistake not the word prophet or prophecy as though we leaned
unto any inward revelations or motions / besides the written word.


F. I know well enough what you mean / and will not mistake your words / for
the Scripture uses them in that sense.


P. Now it should be no new thing unto you / to hear that they may preach who
have no office in the church / seeing this is so common a thing in the colleges
and universities of this land.


F. Yea that is in the schools.


P. If that exercise / whereof you and I mean I am sure / be in your confession
warantable in the schools and colleges / it is much more in the church and
(...) the church and assemblies of his saints should have the use and
exercise of his holy word / and not that it should be brought to humane
schools whither it never came into the Lords mind to command that ever it
should enter. Let the arthes / tongues / and other humane knowledge be taught
in schools and let the holy truth and exercises of religion be dernied from the
church of Christ / which the Apostle for this purpose caleth the pillar and
ground of truth.


F. Well the^ you bear no office in this your church / you will not tell us
whither ever you taught amongst them or not / but you would you say if they
required you.


P. True.


F. But how came it to pass that you were not mad^ an officer amongst them?


P. Surely I was desired to take a charge and to continue with them / but I
would not / because it has been my purpose always to unploy my small tale^t in
my poor country of Wales where I know that the poor people perish for want of
knowledge: and this was the only cause of my coming out of that country where I
was / and might have stayed privately al my life / even because I saw my self
bound in conscience to labor for the caling of my poor kindred and country me^
/ unto the knowledge of their salvation in Christ / purposing in deed before I
had gone thither / to have offered my self unto her majesty or some of their
honors / that it might be made known unto her highness / what I hold in
religion / and how clear I am of those greevous crimes of sedition and
disturbing of her majesty's peaceable gouerme^t / wherewith I am wrongfully
charged.


F. Why / you labor to draw her majesty's subjects from their obedience unto
he laws / and from this church of England / to hear you and such as you are /
teaching in woods.


P. Nay I persuade al men unto the obedience of my Prince and her laws / only
I dissuade all the world from yielding obedience and submission unto the
ordinances of the kingdom of Antichrist / and would persuade them to be
subject to Christ Jesus and his blessed laws / and I know this enterprise to
be so far from being repugnant unto her majesty's laws / as I assure my self
that the same is warranted thereby. Her majesty has granted in establishing
and confirming the great charter of England / (whereunto / as I take it / the
kings and queens of this land are sworn when they come to their crown /)
that the church of God under her should have al her rights and liberties
inviolable for ever. Let the benefit of this law be granted unto me and
others of my brethren / and it shall be found that we have done nothing but what
is warrantable by her laws.


F. What? is it meet that subjects should charge their princes to keep covenant
with them / and enter to scanne what oaths they have take for this purpose:
where find you this warranted up scripture?


P. The subjects are in a most lamentable case / if they may not allege their
princes laws for their acti^^s / yea and show what their princes have promised
unto the Lord and to them / when the same may be for declaration of their
innocence: and it is the crown and honor of Princes / to be known not only
to hold / but even to be in covenant with their subjects / that they will
maintain and preserve them from violence and wrong: nay heathen Princes have
thought themselves honored / when their mean subjects have charged them very
earnestly with the covenants whereby they were bound unto their people. The
laws of this land ar so full this way as no man conversant in them can be
ignorant that our Princes have preferred the observing of those equal couena^ts
whereby they are tied unto their people / before the accomplishing of their own
private affections / yea and commandments in some cases. Hence it is that the
judges of this land are bound by law to administer justice and equity unto the
poor subjects / notwithstanding that the princes letters be directed to them
to the contrary. And as to the law of God al kings and princes are bound there
by / to be so far from thinking themselves tied by no bands unto their subjects
as they are plainly forbidden eue^ to be lifted up in mind above their
brethren (Deuteronomy. 1^. 20.) for so the word in that place calls their subjects
and servants. The kings of Judah who had the greatest privileges and
prerogative both ecclesiastical and civil / over their people / that ever any
kings or Princes can have because they were types and figures of that great
king of kings the Lo. Jesus: euered into covenant notwithstanding with their
people / even particulerly / besides the general former law whereby they were
bound unto them. Yea the prophet Jeremie being in no less danger and disgrace
with all estates then I and my brethren are at this present / required his
sovereign Lord and king Zedekiah to promise that he would do him no violence
and wrong nor yet suffer others to do the same / for telling him the truth of
the word / in the things wherein the king required / to be resolved at his
hands: the which thing / Zedekiah yielded unto / and that by an oath and
covenant of the Lord. Jer. 38. 15. 16. Whereby it appears / that it is not
without great warrant of the word / that princes should enter covenant with
their subjects / and that subjects / should require promise and oath to be
kept with them / otherwise whereto serves the covenant? But alas I enter not to
scanne her majesty's oath / I only tell you what her laws allow me and my poor
brethren. And I am assured if her majesty knew the equity and vprightnes of
our cause / we should not receive this hard measure which we now sustain. We
and our cause / are never brought before her / but in the odious weeds of
Sedition / rebellion / ^chisme, her sie, etc. and therefore it is no mervaile
too see the edge of her sword turned against us.


F. Has not her majesty by her laws established these offices and this order
that now is in the church of England*


P. Her laws have I grant / of oversight / as taking them for the right
offices and order which appertain unto the church of Christ: the which because
we evidently see that they are not / therefore fly we unto her former promise
and act / whereby she grants us the inioping of all the privileges of the
church of Christ.


F. Why then go ye about to pull down Bps?


P. Alas / far be it from us / that ever we should entend any such actions: we
only put her majesty and the state in mind of the wrath of God that is likely
to come upon this land / for the upholding of many Romish inve^tions. We labor
to save our own sowles / and al those that will be warned by us / in avoiding
al corruptions in religion / and practicing the whole will of our God / as near
as we can. Further then this we have no caling to go / and therefore dare not
so much as once in thought conceive of any thing that we should do in the
altering or pulling down of any thing established by her laws.


F. Why then meet you in woods / and such suspicious and secret places / if you
purpose no insurrection for the pulling down of Bps?


P. I have told you the reason before: our meetings are for the pure and true
worship of God / and there is not so much as a word or thought of Bps. in our
assemblies except it be in praying for them / that the Lord would show mercy
and favor unto them / which we wish as to our own sowles. Our meetings are
secret / as I told you / because we cannot without disturbance have them more
open. Our earnest desire and prayer unto our God and our governors is / that
we might have them open / and not be enforced to withdraw our selves from the
sight of any creature. Of the Lords pure worship in the congregation of his
people / are we bound to be partakers / and that in woods / in mountains / in
caves etc. as I told you / rather then not at al.


F. Then you are privy unto no practice or intent of any sedition or commotion
against her majesty and the state / for the pulling down of Bps?


P. No I thank God / nor ever was: and I protest before heaven and earth /
that if I were / I would disclose and withstand the same / to the uttermost of
mineabilitie in all persons of what religion soever they were.


Young. But what meant you Penry / when you told me at my house / that I should
live to see theday / wherein there should not be a Lo. Bp. left in England?


P. You do me great injury Sr. but I am content to bear it. This was it that
I said unto you / namely that I gainsaid nothing in this whole cause / but what
I could prove out of the word of God / to be the remnants of the popish
Antichristian kingdom which religion I said / the Lord has promised utterly
to overthrow and consume / in so much as you (said I) may live / though you be
already of great years (for my self I may be cut of by untimely death) to see
all the offices / calings / works and livings / derived from / or belonging at
any time unto the kingdom of Antichrist / utterly overthrown in this land:
for the Lo. has promised that that man of sin / that body of the Antichristian
religion / shall be so consumed by the breath of his mouth and the brightness of
his appearing in the power of his gospel / before his second coming (2. These.
2.) as that false synagogue shall have no power in any of her officers or parts
/ either to be lifted up over the (...) of God / viz / over any thing that is
caled holy / or yet to oppose her self / as a bloody adversary unto those
truths and servants of Christ who refuse to be in spiritual bondage and
slavery to her. This I showed you to be verified in the type / Babylon of the
Chaldeans / according to the word of the Lo. spoken by Isaiah and Jeremiah and
the casting of the stone into Euphrates by Sheraiah at Jeremies commandment
(Isa. 13. 19. 20. Jer. 50. 40. and 51. 61. 64.) and this I showed to be decreed
by the Lo. of hosts / against the true body / the Antichristian Babel under
the new testament / for so we are taught by the spirit of God / that she shall be
consumed and be no more / that her chapmen shall in this life bewail / and the
saints of God rejoice at her utter over throw and at the spoil and decay of
her merchandise / Reuelat. 18. The comparing of the act done by Sheraiah
against the type / and what followed thereupon / with that of the Angel against
the true Babylon / I declared most fully to confirm my speech: for Sheraiah
throwing the stone into Euphrates said / thus shall Babel be drowned and rise no
more, and so it came to pass: the Angel in the Revel casting the great stone
into the sea / says / with such violence shall the great city Babylon be cast,
and shall be found no more: and so it will be accomplished I am sure. This was my
speech unto you Mr. Young / and I beseech you / yea and charge you as you shall
answer in that great day / not to misreport my speeches / but to relate them as
they are uttered by me.


Y. I conceived some great matter of your speech I tell you.


P. You did me the greater wrong therein: I pray you hereafter to conceive of my
words / according to my meaning / and their natural signification.


F. You say that these offices and livings / derived in your conceit from the
body of Antichrist / shall be overthrown by the Lord / we would know how you
mean that this will be accomplished?


P. I have already showed you / that this work shall be done by the appearing of
Jesus Chr. in the shining brightness of his gospel / through the efficacy
whereof / the Lord shall so lay the^ open / as he will put into the hearts of
Princes and states / where in they are now maintained / to abolish their offices
/ calings and works utterly from among men / and to employ their livings unto
the holy civil uses of the Princes and states wherein they are. After this sort
did the Lord consume the Popes primacie / office and maintenance which he had
in this land / and after this manner did he consume by his gospel / the
Cardinals / Priors / Abbots / Moncks / Friars and Nuns out of this la^d / and
after this or some other way seeming best to his wisdom / shall he

(I doubt not) ^o^sume the rest of that body of miquitie / now remaining where
soever. The work I am assured shall be accomplished / because the Lo. has said
it in his written word: the manner how / or the time when it shall be performed /
I leave to him who rules al things according to the counsel of his own will /
and whose ways and judgments are past finding out.


F. and Y. What you do or purpose to do in these your assemblies we cannot
tell: but this is sure / that the Papists seem to be so encouraged by tijis
dealing of yours / that there were never so many of them in this land since her
majesty's reign / as are at this present and they themselves say that your
separating from us a great stombling block unto them / whereby also they take
occasion to do the like.


P. What we do in our meetings / and what our purposes are / I have told you
simply as in the presence of the Lord / and wear ready by the grace of God to
approve our actions and purposes to be in all good conscience both toward the
Lord and our Prince / and toward al men: if the number of the idolatrous
ignorant Papists be increased / it is no wonderful case / by reason of the small
teaching that the poor people of the land have: and their increase is in the
just judgment of God / in that so many remnants of popery are left vnbanished
in the land / but specialy because these baits are retained here whereby the
Pope is continualy drawn to send over his Jesuits and Seminaries / whereby also
they are most easily and willingly induced to come and pervert her majesty's
subjects from their obedience unto the Lord and his leivetenant and to betray
their native prince and country into the hands of aliants and strangers.


F What are those baits that you mean?


P I mean the former popish offices and their livings whereof I spoke / as the
offices and livings of Archb^s. Lo. Bps. Deanes / Archdeacons / Cannons /
Priests / etc. the continuance whereof / and of the popish corruptions belonging
to them / keeps the Pope and his sworn subjects: in daily hope of replanting
the throne of iniquity again in this land / whereof I trust in the Lo. that
they shall be utterly disappointed. The traitorous Jesuits and seminary priests /
hoping to possess these execrable livings and offices again / are also thereby
allured readily to become most unnatural traitors against their natural Prince
and country / and the Papists at home / are by this means kept still in
remembrance of that Romish Egypt / and in continual expectation of their long
desired day: whereas if these offices and livings were once removed (the devised
works and calings would fall with them) the Pope and his trafiquers would be
utterly void of al hope to set up the standerd of the man of sin again in this
noble kingdom / here being not so much as an office / or one pe^ny of
maintenance left for any of his members: the Jesuits and priests would have no
allurements to make them rebels against their Prince / and the other seduced
Papists at home / would easily forget their idolatry / there being here neither
office nor any other monument of that antichristian religion left / to put them
in mind of that Babel / and so the Lord would accomplish that which thapostle
says shall be fulfilled / even the utter consuming of the man of sin in this
land. (2. These. 2.) And therefore the reteining of these offices and livings /
are not only joined with the great dishonor of God / and the offense of his
saints / (...) my (...) of (...) of this noble kingdom / yea and of ye
prosperity and welfare of her majesty's most royal person / (whom the Lo.
bless body and soul from al dangers both at home and abroad) as it is well
known by over many popish trecheries intended against her. I marvel not that
the papists dislike our separation / and you may be assured that if they knew
what may bring us into danger or discredit us with her Matie. with any of our
superiors / the honorable and worshipful magistrates under her highness or any
else of our countryme^ / they will be sure to utter the same though it were in
their own consciences never so untrue. For they know that of all the men under
heaven / we are the greatest enemies unto their religion / we leave the same
neither branch nor root / but would have all the world to be as clear of that
spiritual cotagion / as it was the same day wherein the Lo. Jesus went up on
high / and led captivity captive. Their reason of their separation drawn from
our example / is like their religion. We dare not join with thassemblies of
the land notwithstanding that we know many of the truths of Jes. Christ to be
professed therein / because in the offices and many of the works remaining in
them / we should have communion with the religion of the Roman Antichrist in
many of the works and inventions thereof: they on the other side will not join
with the public worship of the Land / because thereby they should have overmuch
communion with the doctrine of Christ / and over little with the poisoned
inventions ordained by Satan in the Romish Synagogue / and who moved them to
their treason and disobedience / before we took this course. Is their reason
any thing tolerable / that because we endeavor to worship the Lord purely /
they should take example thereby to give themselves wholly to the worship of
Satan?


F. But why refuse you conference / that you may be reformed in those things
wherein you err?


P. I refuse none / I am most willing readily to yield unto any / as Mr. Young
has it to testify under my hand: only my desire and request is / that I may
have some equal conditions granted unto me and my poor brethren in it / the
which yet if I can not obtain / I am ready to yield unto any conference though
never so unequal / yea I am desirous of any conference that her majesty and
their honors may be truly informed of that which I and my brethren do hold /
and of the warrant that we have thereof from the word of the Lord. Only I crave
that my judgment / my reasons / my answers may be reported in my own words /
and hereof I beseech your worships to bear witness withme. Lastly I beseech you
to consider / that it is to no purpose that her Majesty's subjects should
bestow their time in learning / in the study and meditation of the word of God
/ in the reading of the writings and doings of the learned men / and holy
martyrs that have been in former age / (...) the writings published by her
majesty's authority: if they may not without danger profess and hold those
truths which they learn out of them / and that in such sort as they are able
to convince all the world that will stand against them / by no other weapons then
by the word of God. Consider also I pray you / what a lamentable case it is /
that we may join with the Romish church in the inventions thereof / without al
danger / and cannot but with extreme peril be permitted in judgment and
practice to dissent from the same / where it swarveth from the true way. And as
you find these considerations to carry some weight with them / so I beseech you
be a means unto her majesty and their honors / that my case may be weighed in
even balance. Imprisonments / inditements / yea death it self / are no meet
weapons to convince men's consciences. (.)
