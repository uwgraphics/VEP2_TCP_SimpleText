TORTI TOTO MVNDO



A PRAEMONITION TO THE INTELLIGENT READER.
Lest he finding his affection or opinion crossed in the praise or dispraise of
some particular, should thereby be drawn to read or reject the rest with
Praeiudice.
WHO safely in the stream would swim,
Must free from weeds keep every lym;
Lest sl^^e unto himself he grow,
And vulgar humor draws him low;
Or v^n^ring in the deeps (too weak),
Opinions windy bladder break.
" We ought both in our selves and friends,
" To hate all acts with doubtful ends;
" And love even in our foes the good
" Which may be seuer'd from their blood.
And if the times mislead us so,
To sooth those sins we would not do;
At least (like freemen) let us think
What Is good and bad, although we wink.
To this free nature if you find
These busy papers much inclinde;
Yet pardon them, and i^dge ar^ght,
A free man (not a slave) did write.
Read for your pleasure, close the Book,
On the innocent out side all may look.
The intelligent within may pry:
But bar the Intelligencers eye.
THOMAS SCOT.
SARCASMOS MVNDO: OR, The Frontispice explaned.
HOw apt is Man to err? Antiquity
Thinks it sees right, and yet sees all awry.
Our sight is impot^nt, the help we have
By Ar^s are Natures sp^ctacles to be^ imperfection^ If ^hey be n^ whole and
(...) for the part^ that vs^th them, th^^ rather ^ure then inlight^ ind^ement.

Books d^ny her faith.
Ecclipses of the Sunn^ were wonders thought, Thales.

Till sage Milesi^^ the cause out-sought.
And man had not the wit to make a doubt
Of half the world, till fortune found it out. Columbus.

But what this Age has s^ene, makes that s^eme truth Democr. Alex. Man.

The laughing wiseman wrote, which made the youth
Shed tears to read it; that more worlds remain
Still vndiscouer'd then are yet made plain.
De^pe diuing Paracel^us finds the ground
With minerals and metals to abound;
More proper for our humors then the weed^s^
Herbs, plants, and flowers, which spring from weaker seeds^
This earth we live on and do steadfast call,
Copernicus proves gid^y-brainde, and all
Those other bodies whose swift motions we
So wonder at, he settled finds to be.
Till sanctified The f ^e^ o^ the e^uits.

Found out the lawful way of shedding blood,
And proved it plainly that a s^bi^ct might

For with their merits now w'ar^ more acquaint^d
And know for zealous Pa^riot^ they are s^incted.
His power that does it, till of lat^ we do^bted
But now who qu^stions it to death are flout^d.
Th^n let what I propound no wonder s^eme,
Though doting age new truths do disesteeme,
For time may mak^ it plain, and reason too
May bear it out, though sure with much ado.
Causes for^g^^ ^ff^cts by course of kind,
Yet first the ^ff^ct and then the cause we find.
And so much I do here, propound the thing,
But strong^r reason af^^r-times may bring.
Attend my Doctrine then. I say this Earth
On which we tread, from whence we take our birth,
Is not, as some have thought proportioned round,
And Globe-li^e with such zon^s, and girdles bound,
As Poets or (more lyer^) Tr^u^ll^rs s^y,
But shap^d awry, and looks another way.
It is a monstrous Creature like a M^n,
Thrust altog^ther on a heap, we can
Distinguis^ no part, goggle cyes, wide mouth,
Ears that reach both the poles from north to south,
Crump-shouldr^d, breast, and back, and thighs together,
The legs and feet all one, if it has ^ither.
In brief it is the greatest Master D^uill
Thro^ne down from heaven, in whose womb^ every cuill
Is radically fixed, and from thence springs
Infusing natiu^ evil, in all such things
As it does bre^d and nourish. The place of H^ll
Is in his womb, there lesser devils dwell.
And when he stirs a limme, or break^th wind,
We called an earthquake, and the danger find.
Kings, Emperors, and mighty m^n that tread
In ^ighest state, are l^ce upon his head.
The Pope and all his train are skipping ^leas
That know no bounds, but l^ape lands-law and seas^
The r^st are nits or body-lyc^, that craule
Out of his sweat, such vermin are we all.
From heaven this monster fell, and now does lie
Bruzde with the fall, past all recovery.
Neither alive, nor dead, nor whole, nor sound,
Sinking, and swimming, in a sea profound
Of sinn^, and punishment, of pain, and terror,
Of learn^d ignorance, and knowing error.
No wonder then, that we who liu^ and dye
On curs^d earth, do all things thus awry,
Being monstrous in our mann^rs, and our minds,
And mixing in the lust-full change of kinds.
That we are full of passions, doubts, and fears,
And daily f^ll together by the ears.
No wonder that the Cl^rgie would be Kings,
Kings Churchmen; Lords and Ladies equal things;
So like in painting, spotting, starching, all,
That Ladies Lo^ds, and Lords we Madams call.
For even as Hares change shape and sex, some s^y
Once ^uery year; these whores do eu^ry day,
So that Hirquittall and his wife were waken
By Succubus and Incubus, mistaken.
No wonder that Divines the Parasites play
In jest and earnest; Actors every way.
No wond^r that some the^ues do Lawyers prove,
Since all these evils by course of nature move,
So f^rre; that it is question^d amongst the wise
Which now is virtue, and which now is vice.
Two Croo^backs (not the third Dick Gloucester, hight,
We will have none of him, for he would fight)
Debate this question, each assumes his part.
Aesope for virtue stands, and all his art,
Is to instruct the world to leave the sin,
And folly, which it lies incompast in;
We^ps to behold it circled so with vices,
Whose serpentine and poysond sting, intic^s
To f^ding pleasure, and to deadly pain,
By use soon caught, but hardly left again^.
He wries his neck at earth; but it is to see
How out of order every part will be.
He wills each R^^der if my tales be dark,
To judge the best, the moral still to mark.
And w^ere they find a doubtful meaning, there
To hold an eu^n course, and with compass^ stere.
But where strict rigor might enforce a doubt,
T^incline to ^auour, and to help me out.
On the other side does learned ^ort^s stand
Concomitant, and bears the world in hand
That Aesope and some Stigmaticks beside,
(In shape and wit) did call well-fauour'd Pride
A vice, because themselves were so deformed,
At every pleasure they with malice stormed;
But wiser much, he does with better face,
With equal wit, worth, knowledge (but less grace)
Confront such fond assertions, looks awry
On all the world of virtue, gives the lie
To judgment, and with crooked mind and back
( T^^^sites-like)vnloades this learned pack.
He teaches first that Aesope was a slave,
"But Man's free borne, and freedom ought to have,
"To work h^s own good pleasure, fair content;
"Who lives not thus, has his whole life misspent.
This rule he follows, and lays violent hands
On all; that his pride, lust, and will, with-stands.
Calls his affection reason; his desire
And appetite, sets all his world on fire.
His child, his wife, his neighbor, or his friend,
Is for his pleasure loved; without that end
No King, no great Lord, can forget so soon,
And slight d^sert; as he has often done.
Bastards are true legitimates, he ^aith:
And enemies then fri^nds, have far more faith.
His n^ighbors are most strangers, and before
A modest wife, he likes a shamel^sse whore.
For many whores (he ^aith) he often kept
Without disturbance; but one night, having slept
In twenty years with his true wife, the assault
Of many Sumners did correct the fault.
What we term cowardice, he does valor call,
And in that valor he exceeds all.
An oyster-wife once beat him; bravely he
Bore all her blows, but wanted heart to ^lec.
He will on Sundaies with an Abbot dine,
On Frydaies, with a brother Libert^ne.
And every day drink health's up to the eye:
He treads not right unless he treads awry.
The Maa of sin himself, is not more free
In doing all forbidd^n sins then he.
For what he spea^es or te^cheth, writes or reads,
Only speaks p^easu^e, and to pleasure leads.
Had ^he ^ault Seneca ^ Sir ^^as ^erbury.
Ner^'^ froward Tutor too precise)
Been like our Philo^^rch^^, ple^sure wise,
And pliant to all humors but the good,
He had with ^ur^^ts dyd'e, not lac^e of blood^
Learned A^^tine he reads, and can expound
His modest pictures with a touch profound.
That part is his of ^uery tongue, and ar^e,
Which stricter Ia^^^^ tremble at, and starte
To hear^ recited. This, this man is h^e
Who on the forefront you with Ae^ope see.
Ae^op^ that loo^es awry on all m^ns vice;
But this on virtue casts scornful eyes.
Ae^ope m^kes birds, beasts, fishes, sp^ake and live
As if t^eir lives should M^n example give
To pr^ctis^ virtue. This (with apt beheasts)
Does teach all men how to becom^ li^e beasts.
And (...) w^ose life these creatures m^st res^mble
Comesn^^rest tru^^, and s^ does lea^^ di^^emble^
That Nature is the best g^ide, if w^ pl^^se
To follow her, then we must ^ollow (...)
For these obser^^ her rules, and are not spoiled
By art, nor have their able organ^ foiled
With abstinence and lac^e of use, but still
Dir^cted are by appetite and will.
Look on (...) front.
In Kings he would no other virtue see
Then what in Lions, and in Eagles b^e:
To prey on all, to make their will a law,
To tyr^nnize, to rule by force and awe,
To fear no higher powers, to do no good,
But live to gl^t themselves with guiltl^sse blood.
Courtiers he would have fas^ion'd like to apes,
So fond their gestures, so d^formde t^eir shapes:
So full of idle imitation found,
That scorn in them, our stages might confound.
That they should starch and paint white, red, blew, yellow
And then all black, that other fools might follow.
Divines of Owl^s he would have learn to shrieke,
As if they hated all the world did like;
But having got a tree and Iuy bush,
He then would have them mute, and dumb, and hush,
To serve all purposes, to hate the light,
And prove right Blackbirds, childr^n of the night.
Men that want wit, yet have great place in State,
He would have like to Parrots, learn to prate
Of others, till with Almonds they were fed.
The rest lik^ Foxes he would still have bred
Clos^, cr^ftie, indir^ct, to get by stealth
The goods both of the Church and Commonwealth.
All sub^ects and inferiors he would have
Thems^lues like G^^^e, and Asses to behave.
Rich men and ^^^rers to swallow all
Dir^cted by the Dolphine, and the Wh^le.
Many of his sch^ll^r have learned this le^^on.
All m^n like Dogs to flatter, and to bite,
And mi^int^rpret what we speak or write.
He wills all those that on my payers look,
To make each line a libell in my book:
To poison with their eyes what^'ere they see,
And make themselves sport, and make work for me.
Not to believe the moral, but to seek
Another meaning whatsoever they like,
And call it mine; and swear I meant the same,
Although I would not persons plainly name.
And then he wills them laugh to seek the jest.
"Another mischief, makes a merry feast.
This Doctor is our Ages guide and Tutor,
The world his School, the flesh his Coadiutor.
No wonder then if we live all awry,
When on our Master we cast steady eye.
For Regu ad ex^mplum. etc.
^ Alex^nder^ neck can teach us this,
"The School and Court by greatness fashio^'d is.
Thus our great Masters crookedness is spide
In us his followers, who no good parts hide
That he has learned us, but proclaim aloud
The cause which makes our virtuous Tutor proud.
If any seek his name, and list to come
To school, enquire for M^rus and Antrum.
A SVPPLY OF THE description of Quasi d^rsus pandus.
MONSIER PANDORSVS WALDOLYNNATVS, that merry American Philosopher, or the
Wiseman of the New World; being Antipode to Aesop, placed with him as parallel
in the front. Done according to the simple truth of his own naked delivery.
And dedicated to THOMAS THVRSBY Esquire, no less fit to be public, then
desirous of retirement and priuacie.
YOU shun all office, though your state and wit
With long experience makes you truly fit;
Wherefore Pandorsus wills me prick you here
Shriefe in my book, who might be in the Sheere.

AS the East and West are opposite, so stand
These Wise-^en in the front on either hand.
Aesope well known an Eastern witty thing:
But our Pandorsus Western fame I sing;
Whose picture in the Front, whose marks before,
Behind, within, without, I late did score;
Yet lest that picture, nor these marks, should make
His worth enough apparent, briefly take
His life anatomiz'de, but chiefly where
It may our sucklings with example rer^.
The lines are drawn even by his own true light,
From partial flattery free, and envious spite.
Within that S^i^re where Hyndes with dumplings fed,
Beget best Lawyers, was Pandors^s bread:
But for his P^r^nts were of better rank,
And in a Co^ste Town^ dwelt, they Clarret drank,
And wrie-mouth'd Pl^i^^ br^ts butts^ and (...) did eat,
And crooked Crabs with such prodigious mea^e.
Thus for a wonder they prepar^d in feeding:
And such he proved, who from that root^ had breeding.
Though no P^n lora yet P^ndorsus he,
For vice as famous, as for virtue she.
Each God gave her a grace, and g^ue so much
As more then Momus thought there was no such.
But what to her they gave, from him they took,
And now in vain for grace in earth we look.
Look for effects according to the cause:
"Our childrens faults a^e molded in our mawes.
T^is salt-water-daintie diet f^d
The parts concupiscible, and there bred
An itching humor, whence extracted was
This quint essence of contraries, this mass
Of Natures shreds and parcels, who partakes
A part of all, which imperf^ction makes.
A Foxes brain^s, knowing much wrong, no right;
Gote-bearded, sweete-fac'd, like a Catamite;
Toung'de Lawyer-like, all term without vacation;
A Baboon^s loyn^s, desiring occupation;
Crumpe-Cammell-shoulder'd, neckt as straight as ^ynx,
One eye like to a Molls, the other like Lynx;
A Lions stomach; not to fight but feed;
A Hare in heart, and yet a Snaile in speed.
This is the man whom we Pandorsus call.
Whose arms or Rebus thus we blasen shall.
Upon a stat^ly wall Saint George does ride
(Wanting a horse) in pomp and armed pride;
Beneath there is a Den, in that the Dragon.
This tells his name, whose worthy parts we brag on.
It is his own device, let all men know:
So is the rest which we in order show.
His Mothers Husband (who reputed was
His Father) being rich and well to pass,
A wealthy Merchant and an Alderman,
On foreign shores did trau^ll now and than:
The whilst a Gallant Soldier, new come forth
From war b^got this man of mickle worth.
This gallant Soldier, then from ^Belgia brought
A wondrous Mandrake (with much peril bought)
Sprung (though some thin^e it fabulous) from seed
The gallow^s drop (for so this root does breed,)
Which whilst his mother did in pl^asure eye,
Our Mo^nsurs shape, she did conc^iue thereby.
Much like that Mandrake, writ^en, turning round,
As from the gallow^s he had dropped to ground.
And let no dou^tfull Reader much admire,
A Myrmidon should be Pandorsus Sire,
For as there is none with us get brauer men
Then Lawyers, or the tender Citizen,
So none more cowards g^t, then those which are
Our brauest Spirits, most renownde in war.
The cause I know not, or I list not tell,
But so it often falls, and here so fell.
None bolder then Pandorsus Sire, then he
None fearefuller; and yet he needs would be
A Soldier, where the Muster-booke he filled,
But fought with none, nor never saw any killed.
Artemon was more hardy though afraid
Of his own shadow. Wagers have been laid,
That let an enemy fart, he would outrun
An Irishman, for fear t'had been a gun.
Where learned Spencer makes harna'st Fear
Afraid the clashing of his arms to hear,
That apprehension he from hence did gain,
Our Monsieur did, what Spencer did but feign.
But stay, I have forgot to let you know
His education, and to show you how
(Being nusled up in Letters) he in sport
His time wore out at School and Innes of Court,
Yet so as once a Gypsy, who did look
Upon his Palm, said he, should live by's book;
Which fortune some conceive has doubtful scope,
As if his book should save him from the rope:
But since he proves, it meant another thing,
That teaching Tongues, he should live like a King;
And so he now does, living as he lust,
And by his own will measuring what is just.
For being set to School when he was young,
He of all knowledge learned both tail and tongue.
The Italian, Latin, Spanish and the French,
He grew as cunning in, as at a Wench.
A Dictionary of all words of Art,
And Lullies old-ends, he has got by heart.
The apparel of all knowledge he does wear,
And 'bout him (Bias-like) his wealth does bear.
And now (grown ripe) he does religion choose
That Is most in fashion, as our great ones use:
But otherwise for truth he will never burn,
The advantage of his wry-necke helps him turn:
He knows the way, and wills the world never doubt,
That coming raw in, he will go roasted out.
In youth he took to Wife a lovely Dame,
Not hight the chaste Penelope by name;
But worthy such an attribute, for she
Her wandering loose Ulysses did not see
In twenty years, and yet it is thought her bed
She kept unstained, and vn-ad-horn'd his head.
But what a blessing was, he thought a curse,
His wife had better been, had she been worse,
Her goodness made him hate her; she had did
But that a dozen must be killed beside.
He knew not then (as I have heard him say)
The Italian trick, but the plain English way,
Of simple Country poisoning, now he knows
To do t by inches; Court perfection grows.
Lopus and Squire, are not so skilled as he,
And scarce Romes Conclaue in that mystery.
He can a Nullitie work, divorce the life
Twixt soul and body, sooner then some wife.
And if his ricke be known, men never will seek
A doubtful way by law, but do the like.
His wife thus escaped a scouring, so did he,
When being merry once in company
And passing Smith-field (then vnpau'd) too late
With rich Canary having linde his pate,
The owle-eyde Sharkers spied him, how he felt
To find a post; his meaning soon they smelt:
And then the sturdiest knave, with sodain'd rush,
Our wavering Monsieur on his knees did push,
The whilst another kindly to him spoke;
Helped him out of the dirt, and changed his cloak.
This cloak he wore next day, and passing by
A Brokers shop, the prentice loud began cry
Sirs stop the thief, the cloak this fellow wears
Is mine: with that they swarmed about his ears,
Conuayde him to a Justice, where one swore
He had been branded stagmaticke before.
Another said, he was the man that hung
Three days beyond Seas, as the ballad sang;
The cause why he his neck awry, did hold,
Was for he hanged long, and was taken down cold
But to the Justice being thoroughly known,
For carrying letters where't must not be shown,
And for his skill, each modern language speaking,
And wondrous Art, to silence doors from squeaking,
With loss of his good cloak, he slipped the hook,
And thus he once was saved by his book.
Thus far I stretch my lines, thus far he lives,
And more I Will write, when he direction gives.
But if I die, these lines shall be the glass
His worth to show, and how I thankful was.
To the ouer-wise, ouer-wilfull, ouer-curious, or ouer-captious Readers.
I Feign would tell some Tales, but I Would be loath,
To have men be so wise to think them troth.
This is^ wondrous witty age that sees
Beyond the truth of things, forty degrees,
Each Riddle now has Poison in it; each Rhyme
On the blancke Almanak points at guilty time.
Aesope must make no Lions roar, nor Eagles
Shrike loud, nor wolves r^^in, nor swift Beagles
Yelpe with their slauering lips after the Fox,
Nor must he meddle with the Ass, or Ox,
For fear some querke ^e found, to prove he men^
Under those shapes, a private spleen to vent
Against wise vigilant Statists, who like Ianus,
Look both ways squint, and both ways guard and sa^e v^.
Or that he closely would great Lawyers yerke,
Who build their neasts, with ruins of the kirk:
Or that he touched some Churchman, who to rise
One Steeples height, would tell Canonical lies.
The Ghost of Virgils Gnat would no^ sting so^
That great men durst not in the City go
For fear of petty-Chapmen, with a Serieant,
And a sly Yeoman, noted in the Marg^ant.
If Spencer now were living, to report
His Mother Hubberts tale, there would be sport:
To see him in a blanket tossed, and mounted
Up to the stars, and yet no star acco^nted.
I dare not for my l^se in all my tale,
Use any English Bird, Beast, worm, or Snaile,
Or fish that in the narrow Seaes do travel,
(Al^hough each Pyrat dares) le^t some should cauell,
And find it did belong in times of yore
To some blew sleeue, (but shall do so no more)
Or that the Maker of new blood, the Marrold,
(Cleped in our w^lch-Scotch and English Harrold)
Had (too too cheap) for five pounds it entailed
On some bold Britain, and by warrant nailed,
To him and to his house, and double voucher,
Fine and recovery; and then who dare touch her?
Not I, I love my ease too well, my money,
My eare^, my liberty; he longs for honey,
That mo^gst the angry Wh^spes thrusts his bo'd fingers,
And from their neas^s in Summer, hunts those stingers.
My valor is less hardy, my desire
Less hot I Will bl^sse and blow, not kiss the fire.
Therefore auant all ca^h^like Lo^^sts, ^^me
Into my tale nothing one this side Rome,
Nor in Virginia, though it be ours by lot,
And yet p^rhaps it may, perchaun^'t maynot.
I would not^ if it lay in me to choose,
Meddle with any thing we Christians use:
But would all dealing with our own eschew,
If other world, and elements I knew.
But since that Nature does some gifts disperse
Alike to all within the Universe;
And in a cicular globe, tie those to these;
Mixed us ^n common with the Antipodes:
I cannot choose but do as nature does,
Mix many names and things well known to both.
Thus if by chance I use Bird, Fish, or beast,
Which is no dainty at a Mayors feast:
But often familiar food for every Swain,
That in our Countr^y, Coast, and Wood remain.
Yet still concei^^ (I pray) those names I take
Not properly, but for your ignorance sake.
Or if they proper be, of all one kind,
Yet difference in their place of birth we find.
And in the^^ natures. For though man be man,
Yet sure an Indian is no English man,
And so an Indian Ass, or `Daw, or Trout,
Though we have such, are none of ours no doubt:
But would we wonder here, and purses pick^,
Since none but travelers ^uer s^y the like.
Excuse me then though with such names you meete^
They are not those that travel in our street,
But forreiners to us and to our Nation,
Except by trade, commerce, or transplantation
Made our acquaintance. Hence thou subtle spies
Streach out my tails to justify your lies.
If ought beside the moral you in^ent,
Call it your owne^ By me'twas never meant.
My tale shall sort all Atheists well, and be
Of their religion, heathenish and free.
It shall make lust a Gospel and a Law,
(Not for the truth) but to keep fools in awe,
That when our Gospel or else Law does thware
O ur wills, we then may neither reck a f --.
Come Ibis, Lead the way; eat one snake more
And by my fury; usher on before

Arist.
KNowledge and Grace, are antidotes to you,
Who killing Serpents, do not Serpents grow.

EGYPT oppressed with Serpents, either growing
From slimie NILVS fruitful ouerflowing,
Or from the envious banks of Tyber sent
To tell what farther harm the Romans meant:
Or by the foggy Southern winds brought over
From sandy Lybia to this fertile shore:
Made ^bis Keeper of their lives and states,
Who like a watchful Porter, kept the gates
Where this infected Crew did use to enter:
And (as they came in poisoned troops) did venture
Mauger their sting, and teeth, and venom too,
To swallow the envious Aspes with small ado.
So long shefed, that Egypt now seemed free,
And scarce a Serpent in the land could see.
"But ouer^f^eding hurts^ as some men say,
"though food be good then surf^t soon we may
"B^ poyson^d bits. And Ibis found it true. Diod^ Sicul^ lib^ 3.

So that her glutted gorge sh^e's ^orc't to spue;
The noisome stink where of inf^ct^d more
Then by these Serpents had bin stung before,
And Ibis self (corrupted with the food)
Grew Serpentine, and did more harm then good,
She ke^ps no ^ntrance now, but lets them pass,
And of their faction, and their treason, was
A cunning aider, and a close contriuer;
Al-gate She se^m'd a diligent, faithful, diuer
Into their darker holes to search them out:
But truth it was to put them out of doubt,
That She their friend, they need not fear a foe,
But might at pleasure through the kingdom go,
Whilst all neglect^d their increase, supposing,
Ibis their trusty warden, had been closing
The lands strong Ports, with skill to keep thesein,
And others out, till all had eaten bin.
But she had other aims, and under hand,
Placed Cockat^ices all about the land:
And such as these (who kin to serpents were)
Did she make Captains, and to place prefer Plin. lib. cap^ 22. Cacoble
alias. Ca^ cotheph^

Of chief command in war: with hope to bring,
The Basiliske to be the Egyptian king;
The Basiliske that at the head of Nile,
With deadly poison does the spring defile.
Thus Ibis faild them, and betraide their trust,
And now or die themselves, or kill they must.
And scarc^ was it in their choice. Such quick increase
"Has bad things more then good, in time of peace.
Yet the Egyptians from securer sleep,
Of foolish pity, and remissness deep,
Or fond c^edulity, and easy faith,
At last aw^k't, wha^s'euer Ibis says,
Suspects of ^r^ud, of double-meaning, doubt,
And with qui^ke search do find the treason out.

PLutarch in the life of Alexander the Great, writes of a Woman brought to a
Serpentine and poisonous nature, by feeding ordinarily on Serpents. This has
so^e r^s^mblance with this tale, whose Moral is^ that man should carefully,
guard himself from others, and from himself: From others, because though we
come near sin, with a purpose to punish it; yet being full of contagion, the
effect is hazardous: much more when we converse with it daily; as they
witness, who keeping company with profane, dissolute, and blasphemou^
persons, do often come out such themselves, seldom otherwise. Beware
therefore of evil company, and evil custom. Psalm. 1
To walk in the counseil of the wicked, leads you to stand in the way of
sinners, and caus^th you to sit in the seat of scorners. To converse with
Heretics under whatsoever pretense is dangerous. Thus therefore guard your
self from outward invasion, from others; but keep one eye to look inward.
The worst company is at home, within a man's self. His senses stirred up to
pleasure, are so many Serpents in his bosom, seeking his destruction: neither
will they easily be charmed. The sting of sin is sweet, but deadly^ Set your
unsanctified app^tite and will to govern these, and you are undone. The flesh
will let in the world and the devil, in stead of God and Heaven. But let your
sanctified Reason be your governor, and you are safe at home and abroad.
Mortify therefore p Colo c^ 3. v.
your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, the inordinate
affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is Idolatry, etc. The
place of greatest danger where your foe may land and enter, is the
Cinque Ports, the five senses: watch therefore over these, and over our
affections, and you are safe.

2. Venaticum Iter.
Dedicated To the example of Temperance, Sr HENRY BEDINGFEILD Knight, and to
his LADY the example of Love.
You hunting love, your fields are spread with sheep,
Look that your hounds, your folds from foxes keep.
Foxes and Wolves in sheepskins range about:
Within ^pinions; Parasites without.

THE Egyptian Shepherd armed at all assayes
With Dogs and Sheephookes, sat upon the Lays,
At pleasure piping many a lear^ed sonnet
Of fixed stars, and each course keeping plann^t:
Of thunder, lightning, meteors, and the c^use
Of changing kingdoms, and translating law^s:
Why pestilence did rage, why good men di^,
Why Nilu^ ouerflowes the banks so hie,
Why killing frosts, and such abundant snow,
That ruin falling, ^uine as they thaw:
Why the earth should barren be, and famine breed
In the fat soil^, though ^owne with better seed.
Why water, air, the earth, and cheerful fire
Should (being made for man) against man conspire,
And of themselves (by nature never bidden,)
Bring forth such cross effects, unheard and hidden,
To plague poor man, and living him t'intombe
In his one ruins, e're the day of doom.
The cause of this, they wisely found to be
Man's open sins, and close Hypocrisy.
And of this Theme discoursing too and fro,
Proving it was, wishing it were not so.
The King came by, and with him many Nobles,
Whose pestred train the sheep and shephead troubles.
Poor Country, thou find'st this in corn and cattle,
When most remote f^o^ Court, thou most do battle
The King a hunting rides; the shepherds dogs
Would needs a hunting too, and onward iogs
These jolly Currs: the Shepherds whoope amain,
Hollow and whistle too, but all in vain.
The Hunts-men rate, and like to mad men ride;
The Currs suppose they cheer them when they chid^:
So on they go, and do as others do,
Throw up their curld tails, spend their wesands too,
And when thy cannot top the rest, run after
^o ^ong, till anger now is turned to lafter;
And now the King delights the Currs to hear.
For they are ever busy in his ear;
And coming home to trencher-food they fall,
^rouing good bloodhounds some, good harriers all.
^hey can draw dry-foot to the harmless game,
Whilst Wolves and Foxes pass their noses tame.
^hus fed by fat sweet bones, they all prove gluttons,
and where they wont to guard, now kill our muttons,
They learned have Court lore, and nothing fails;
Can fawn and flatter, nimbly wag their tails;
And snarle, and bite, and beat ^he better hound
Out of the Court, who their false hunting found.
And now the time draws on, the King again
Rides out to hunt, and with him all his train.
These dogs are fore-most, and pursue the chase
With eager stomachs and with equal pace.
But being trencher-fed, the weather ho^,
Themselu's vnbreath'd, to hunting used not,
They soon are shaken off, and waxing slack
Become the lag and hindmost of the pack;
And straight lose ^ight, sent, hearing of the rest.
So then to Nilus-ward they hold it best
To turn their course, with the cool waves to slack
The heat they got, for double diligence ^ake.
The roughest, rudest, curstest Curr of all,
Which wont upon the gentlest Dogs to fall,
(And neither being Hound nor Mastiffe bred,
Lyci^ca.
But of a mongrill kind, by shee-Wolues fed,
Did silence such as spent their sweeter voice
In turnefull tones, which Hunters ears rejoice,
Whilst he nor at the fold would watch in dark,
Nor bite the Wolf, nor with his harsh voice bark,
Nor here amongst the Hounds once open wide
His monstrous chaps, except, to bite, or chide,
Or rauin and devour the daintyest meat
Which the industrious, not the slug should eat:
And in despite of whips, though crouch and cry,
Would never mend, nor better grow thereby)
Led on the way, for he would still be first,
His impudence was such, and such his thirst.
^or would he suffer auy their to drink
^ill he had done. Ambitions eye does think
To swallow all, and all too little to,
For him that least deserves, and least can do.
^ut see a just reward, whilst thus he lies
^ending his pleasure, from the waves does rise
(...) cruel subtle Crocodile, who snatcheth
^t him with her sharp sangs, quickly catches
^he lazy Curre; which struggles, cries, and str^ues.
^ut all too late. The amphibious monster dives
under the waves; the Dog r^sists in vain,
^eath swallows him, the rest run home amain;
^ome to the Sheepfolds, and attend the trade
^hey were by Art traind to, by Nature made.
and fearing now the like, fore-warned by this,
^hen hot and dry they waxe^ their custom is,
^t banks of Nile nere to rest and stay, A^lianus I. ^. Praet^rc^rrunt autem
ripam, and suffurantes bibunt, quant^^ est capere: iterum aeque iterum.

^ut here and there to lap, and so away;
^est otherwise some Crocodile being hid,
should serve their sloth, like as the other did.

This tale does teach, each man himself t'apply
To his Vocation; not to look awry
At Honors, Riches, Pleasures, which are baits
The devil lays in our way, and in them waits
To swallow us, whilst eagerly we seek
To swallow and ingrosse what^'ere we like:
Without respect what is honest^iust, and fit,
^o we by any means can compass it.
Each has his element, his toil, and sport.
The clown the country, and the King his Court.

On honors or on pleasurs, but by chance:

THe Griffon (well allied, and great in power)
Made challenge to be general Emperor
Of beasts, and birds; whose title to decide,
A general Council was proclaimed wide
Through all the world, and every bird and beast
Together met, the greatest, and the least.
Among these some crawling serpents, some with feet,
And some with wings did at this Council meet,
And claimed the place of beasts, and did allege
Full many ancient laws of privilege
^or their high honor; b^t the chief was this; Genesis 3 1. Serpens enim erat
as^utus, astu^^or quauis bestia agri.

^hey proved themselves beasts, out of Genesis.
^ut when that Law was read, and it was found,
their treason brought a curse upon the ground;
that ever since their poison did annoy
^oth birds an^ ^^^sts, and often did both destroy;
Cloking their ^^aud, guilding their villainy
With ancient vniuersall-vnity;
Betraying truth with dark a^biguous lies,
And cosening man of blessed Paradise:
Adulterating, purging of the sense
Of holy Writ, under a good pretense:
They had by general voice, strict banishmen^
from coming nere this Court of Parliament.
And now the rest proceed; but by the way
Arose another cause of some delay,
Coming to choose a Speaker, bold Jack daw Goodmatters may be propounded with
an ill mind.

Would interpose his skill, and vouch a Law,
(The law of Para^ites) that each one might
Speak what him list, against reason or against right.
And that no Speaker needed, ought to be,
Where such a mixture was; for if quoth he,
We choose a bird, the beasts will all dissent;
If they a beast, we shall be discontent.
This speech, though true in part, did all offend,
Because they saw his busy tongue did bend
To c^osse all business, and his wit de^ise
To change the firmest knots to nullities.
So they agreed together in this sort,
To cut his nimble tongue a little short,
For sa^cie tatling, where he should not teach^
And being silent where he ought to preach.
But he aueides his sentence with a quirke,
Pleading of old he longed to the Kirk,
Though seldom he came there; and each one took
Him for no Clarke, until he claimed his book
Then they perceived his skill; and soon discerned
How he to flatter and backbite was learned;
Could mount a steeples top and with the wind
Turn like a weather-cocke his ready mind,
Serving the time. Therefore they onward pass
To choose a Speaker; some would have the Ass,
Because he could diminish naught nor add,
But truth deliver, were it good or bad:
Yet most mislik'd that choice, and those pronounce
The Parrot fit, and some the nimble Ounce;
Some the sweet Nightingale, and some the Dog,
And some the Fox, the Baboone, some the Hog;
Some Robin red-brest, or the speckled Thrush,
Some Chantecleere, and some the Woodcock flush.
Some chose the Ape, and some mislike his voice,
So sundry factions rise from his heard choice.
At last the Elephant persuades with all,
To take an equal course, and Man to call
As Speaker, Judge, and Vmpire in this thing,
Being by nature the worlds general King,
And the most fit t'appoint and to depute
His own Imperial bird beast substitute.
To this they all consent, and to this end
In humble wise to Man this Message send,
That he their Patron, Governor and Lord,
Would daigne this mighty difference to accord
With reason and authority. His consent
Is soon obtained: now gins the Parliament.
In which the Griffon thus begins his plea.
Grand Emperor, of Air, Earth, and Sea;
I challenge by prerogative, and birth,
To be your Vicar general on the Earth,
Over birds and beasts: The beasts I ought command, Gryps quadru Gryps ter vol^
recitat^ Deuteronomy. 1^

Because upon four feet like them I stand.
The birds I ought to rule, cause I can fly
With these my wings like them, and soar as hie.
I do surpass the beasts in having wings,
The birds in legs, in tail, and other things:
My force does match the Lions, and my heart
The Eagle, or excels them in each part.
Your doom I therefore claim, that I may be
Placed equal to my worth in sovereignty:
And next your self the Emperor be of Earth,
According to the privilege of my birth.
Then spoke the Elephant, and said, that he
Ought over beasts the only Lord to be.
His strength was great, and more then others far, Elephas animal quod ma
nitudine inter om nia anim lia quadr^ pedia excellit: I^. tellectu and memoria
multum vigens. Plin. Solit. Regulus, or, Reg^liolu^

His honors purchasde more in manly war:
His le^rning more, the letters understanding,
And aptly doing all, wise Man commanding.
Against him up rose the Sire of Ban^es his horse,
And challenged him to try, wit, worth, and force.
This grew to heat, but then the mighty Rucke
Soon parts the fray, each did from other pluck;
Desires she might be heard, her challenge was
To rule all birds, since she all ^^rds did pass.
The Wren straight hopt about, and said, his ^ame
Did show from what a royal stock he came.
And every bird and beast, the great and small,
Had his ambitious aim to govern all^
Which having made, in silence all sat down
Being ouer-aw'd with man's Imperial frown.
Each feared, each hoped, until at length the Man
Rose up, and to determine thus began.
I was your Master made, you made for me,
And whatsoever in the Globe there be
Hid or revealed, it is mine. And I alone
Sole Emperouram, under that only One.
Nor doubt you this; the question now in hand
Is for the vnder-king-ship of my land;
For it is not fit that I should troubled be
With every toy, when subjects dis^gree:
But that my Presiden^ should still be nigh,
Your doubts and iarrest' appease and rectify.
It only rests to show what parts are fit
For government. That Is courage, strength and wit,
Mercy and justice, and the guard to those,
Awe to command, dexterity to dispose.
If any part of these be separate,
The rule is most imperfect, and the State
Falls to con^empt; the laws are trodden down,
The Scepter broken, and despi^'d the Crown.
This shows how many her^ have vainly sought
For one good part, the wreath that many ought.
That nor the Ruck, the Elephant nor Horse,
Are fit to govern for their matchless force;
Nor for their wit alone; for then the Ox
Might make his claim too, and subtle Fox:
Much less the silly Wren for honored house,
Nor the catt-fearing, Elephant-frighting Mouse.
For these would breed contempt, and Athens Owl
Might challenge so night-rule of every Foul.
Nor is it meet this Griffon should obtain
What by pret^nce of right he seeks to gain.
Because his title halts on either side,
Except in halues, himself he will divide. Gryph^ Capite^^ alis Aqu similis^
(...) quo cor^ re simili^ Leoni. Isid. l. 1^^

He is no beast: his talents, wings, and head
Conclude against his challenge in my stead.
Nor yet a bird: his body, legs, and tail
With evidence his garments all do quail.
But if where proof lies hid, we may proceed
By probabilities; from spurious ^eede
He took his being, and would neither love,
Being like to neither, but a Tyrant prove.
And where he boasts his wondrous strength and heart,
It Is false he does pretend, because that part
Which shows him Lyon-like in shape, hide, hair,
Does of the kingly-Lyon stand in fear.
And that birds part which he from the Eagle took,
On the sky-towring Eagle dares not look.
The Lion therefore I ordain and make
The King of beasts; his awful voice shall shake Aquil^ mas^

The proudest spirit. And the Eagle shall
Be King of Birds, and ouer-looke them all.
This sentence past, the Parliament arose,
And with these rules of truth the Sessions close.
Epimythium.
Who seeks two swords to sway, has right to none^ Vnum opus optim^ fi^ ab vno^
Arist. l. 2. Politic.

Who seeks two offices, is not fit for one:
Who seeks two callings, takes too much in hand:
Who has two faiths, does true to neither stand.
One sword, one office^calling, and one faith,
Is fit for one Man; so this story says.
Who seeks two swords to sway, has right to none.
The Pope challenges not only Peter's keys and Paul's sword, but has found
two swords in Peter's hand, with which he (like another Alexander) cuts asunder
the knots he cannot undo. The band of marriage betwixt man and woman: The
hand of loyal obedience betwixt subjects and Sovereigns; The band of
conscience betwixt God and man; he cuts asunder by dispensing with marriages,
allegiance, and others, etc. By his behavior therefore in these things, it may
be judged whether he be fit to have many swords that cannot use one well.
Edged tools are not to be put into the hands of drunkards: He is scarce
sober that makes all other drunk with the c^p of his abominations.

Who seeks two offices, is not fit for one.
To the late Queen of famous memory, a Courtier who had great place about her
Majesty, made suite for an office belonging to the Law. Sh^e told him he was
unfit for the place. He confessed as much, but promised to find out a sufficient
Deputy. Do (says she) and then I may bestow it upon one of my Ladies, for they
by deputation may execute the office of Chancellor, chief Justice, and others,
as well as you. This answered him, and I would it could answer all others: that
^it men might be placed in every office, and none how great soever suff^red to
keep two. They should take offices for the Commonwealths benefit; but they
take them like Farms for to enrich themselves. This discourageth all
professions, both in the Church and Commonwealth: one place is fit for one man.

Who seeks two Callings, takes too much in hand.
The Church has some of these, who are better Physicians, Lawyers, Merchants,
or Handicrafts-men, then Divines. The Commonwealth has many of these, some
who receive tithes, buy and sell Churchliuings, retain Deanryes, and
Prebenda^ies. and are well seen in all occupations, but in that which they
were bound to profess. To be a Merchant, a Maultster, a Brewer, a Grasier, a
Sheepe-master, a Farmemonger, an Usurer, a Devil and all, is ordinari^ in
every Country, and he is thought no good husband that is not all or the most
of these.

Who has two faiths, does true to neither stand.
Our miraculous example in these our days, has demonstrated this beyond
denial, which but lately though we knew, yet we durst not v^ter for fear of
censure. With what Tyranny does vice guard it self from knowledge? How rankly
does that Fame stink now, against which but lately we durst not stop our
noses? This is a maxim grounded from this example. No honor, preferment, or
respect can assure our ^aith, if the band of faith, religion, be not entire
with us.

Prove there is no bankrupt but the thanklesse Man.

^ingi^ ^em Isid. ^icuiusque ^men ^n^ ^it, quem ^ca^^ ^o^laceret. ^d:
HY^n^ was a subtle beast and bloody;
To ruin man was his whole trade and study.
He scorned the sheep, the shepherd was his prey,
His nightly plots got, what he mist by day.
The shepherds of Arcadia, beguiled
By his feigned voice, were murdered often and spoiled.
For in the night he wont like some good friend,
To call them out, and then a pieces rend.
One only wiser shepherd thought it best
Hire Sphinx to watch his house whilst he did rest:
Whose subtlety foresaw, and still prevented,
What else his Master had too late repented.
For when the false Hyena went about
Calling for help, to train^ the Shepherd out,
Faining distress as if he robbed were,
Or mist his way (a weary traveler);
Sphinx soon perceived his counterfeit complaining,
And laughed outright to hear his crafty fayning;
But would not let the credulous shepherd go,
(Whose tender heart pitied his mortal foe)
Till day appeared, and that the Sun shone bright.
Together with the Sphinx full many a night,
An Indian Ass and Musk. cat, safely slept,
Whilst Sphinx the shepherds house and household kept.
Nor did they always sleep but often heard
What at the first to think upon they feared;
But custom at the length bere^t all awe,
And they afraid were when they nothing saw.
So envy wrought, and Ignorance, and Pride,
That they the wiser Sphinx dare now deride.
And moved the Shepherd, to prevent the charge
Of keeping more, to let the Sphinx at large.
Persuading there was no such cause of dread,
But they might well supply the Sphinx his stead:
Who feigned those fears, and did imagine treason,
To win the opinion of much wit and reason.
The Sheapheard fondly credits this; and straight
Lets loose the Sphinx, and these in order wait.
The Indian Ass^ he trusted being plain,
Supposing he would nei^herlye, nor feign.
And the Musk-cat, was pleasant to the smell,
And very watchful; needs must these do well.
The night is come, the Shepherd soundly sleeps
As he had wont, no skar his conscience keeps.
These two stand Sentinel, and now ere long,
Comes the Hyena, and with smoothing tongue
Says; Is your Master waking, gentle swains?
If not, a^ere him, tell him all the Plains
Are up in arms against our common foe,
The false Hyena that beguiled us so.
He cannot escape their hands, for they have found
The Cave he keeps in, closely under ground.
Bid him awake and rise and come away,
For all the Shepherds for his coming stay.
This tale believed, the Ass and Musk-cat hye,
To make their Master to make have to dye.
He r^seth rashly, opes the door, goes out,
And is de^our'd ere he can look about.
Nor can the watchmen escape, but both are slain:
Though one be sweet, the other true and plain.

"Not simple truth alone can make us fit,
"To bear great place in State without great wit.

HIPPOPOTAMVS.
DEDICATED To the magnificent KNIGHT Sr. HVGH SMITH, and his worthy LADY.
YOur Auon's quiet, no such Monsters feed
'Bout sandy Seuerne, as in Nilus breed:
^t Nilus-like your bounty o^erflowes,
^^ence good report, and ^ame, and honor grows. Hippopotamus in Nilo editur,
Crocodilo inimicus. Pli. lib. 8. c. 25. Crocodilus animal quadrupes in terra
and in aquis valens.


THe Seahorse, and the famous Crocodile,
Both challenged to be Kings of fruitful Nile;
and sundry fields they fought, where many dyed
^f either ^action, still the cause untried.
^et often had they single, hand to hand,
^ncountred in the flood, and on the land:
and parted still with equal harm away,
^or both the blows bore thence, but not the day;
Yet each invincible himself did call,
And so they were, but to themselves, to all.
But when they cop'd, success did thus conclude;
Courage remayn'd, strength only was subdued.
And so for want of strength they often sundred,
Though at their wondrous strength al other wondre^
Thus o^t they met, and o^t assayed in vain,
Who should the Imperial crown of Nilus gain:
Till both grew weary of these wars at length,
And began lay by the use of arms and strength.
And truce proclaimed a while on either part,
A fained truce, no friendship from the heart.
For underhand by stratagems, and friends,
And secret plots, each sought their several ends.
But much more noble was the Crocodile,
And wiser much, though not so full of guile
As Hippopotamus, so the other hight,
Who cared not what he did, or wrong or right,
By falsehood, bribes, or treason; so he could,
Seruo enim non ^as est ve^um dicere, quod Hero suerit incommodum Enti^
Chameleo^ mutat s^^m ^olorem infl^tus A^ist, Hist. Animal^ lib. 11. cap. 11.
The foulest fact, to his advantage mould,
And thus he called Chameleon on a day,
With Polypus, and unto them began say:
You two my bosome-fri^nds, my Minions are,
My p^iuie Counselors in peace and war.
And I have found you plyant to my will,
Faithful to me, but false to others still.
And now I crave, your utmost Art and reason,
In conquering of the Crocodile by treason;
Which thus I purpose: Both of you are made,
By nature apt to color and to shade,
With fit resemblance all the objects nigh,
On which you shall reflect a steady eye,
^ou can seem otherwise, then what you be,
and cover hate with close hypocrisy,
^ou can take any shape, any disguise,
and soon beguile the most inquisitiue eyes;
^eare any Livery, all companies fit,
and to each humor change your ready wit.
^his you have done before, and often made plain
^eightie intelligence, and can so again.
^ut each his proper element retayning,
^hameleon in the air, and earth remaining,
^ou Polypus at sea. To sea then hye,
and with rich promises Torpedo buy
^o our close service: he in Counsel is
^o our great ^oe, a greater friend of his.
^But wealth is our best friend, and that corrupts
^The purest mind, and friendship interrupts.
^ith gifts and promises pervert him so,
that he may call us friend, count him a foe:
^ill him he would, when fitting time does come,
^ith his slow touch, secure, bewitch, benumme,
^ur adversary, and his sense astonish,
that it may seem a crime him to admonish
^f our apparent practices preparing,
^hilst he attends his sports, no danger fearing.
^hen to the Water-rat Ichneumon go^,
and you to Cuschill^^ and will them too, Phi^^ lib. 8, cap^ 26^

^hen next they pick his teeth, and scratch his head,
For they are near him still at every stead,
and highly fauor'd, (chiefly Cuschi^^us),
though both in fee and pension be withvs),
that they would join their wits and force together
^o murder him; and for reward come hither.
So when your plots he closely thus conuey'd,
And all your trains and tew in order laid,
Then mix your selves in either element
With the profuse, the needy, discontent,
The desperate, the bloody, and the bold,
Whom naught but fear do from rebellion hold;
Of such you shall find many in this State.
For he is remiss, and does all business hate,
Whereby he gets contempt, and opens wide
A ready way of entrance vnespide
To our high aims. Full many you shall find
Of our close faction, fitting to our mind.
Those that are such encourage, others frame,
And what you will speak largely in our name;
Promise, and swear, and lie, to make things fit,
That our designs may prosper by our wit.

And post with speed, and with a speed too good
Dispatch all Scenes fit for the Act of blood.
And now the wise, learned, valiant Crocodile,
A hunting hies unto the bank^s of Nile:
Where having sported long, and fully fed,
The slow Torpedo strokes him on tbe head,
Whisp^rs within his ear, and charms him so
That in the Sunshine he to rest must go.
But as he goes drowsy and reeling thus,
Meets him the Indian Rat, and Cu^chillus,
And lowting low with music him presents,
And antique she^es, and mas^ing meriments;
Striving to hide their treason with such Art,
That their true care almost betrayed their heart,
^his wise Alcedo (one that many a dish
^ad for his King prepared, of dantiest fish),
^id soon suspect, and with shrill voice began cry,
^ir King beware, for enemies are nie;
^eware of him that is busy with your ear,
and tells you lies, that truth you may not hear:
^eware of him that is s^ratching of your head, Regnum potius ab assentatoribus
quam ab hostibus euertitur^F. Patr. Seu. Comm de Inst. Princ^ lib. 5.

^eware of him that is making of your bed.
^eware of ^im that does extol you so,
and like a God adores you as you go:
^eware of him that does so humbly fall
On his false ^nee; good King beware of all.
With that the Crocodile began look about,
Being half asleep, from a sweet dream wak^d ou^,
and would have heard more, but the charmers kept
The bird away by force; and so he slept.
^e slept, and Cuschillus did sing the while,
And picked his ^eeth, and used many a wile
To open his ouer-chap (for only he
^oth move his ouer-chap, the nether we): Solus inter animali^ superiorem
maudibula^ mouet Crocodilus. Isid.

At last he tickled him, and forced him so
^o yawne and gape: then Cuschillus does go
unto his belly, and the Indian Rat
^eapes quic^ly after; where they first search what
^lose counsels, secret purposes did fill
His darker bosom, were they good or ill.
But were they good or ill, it matters not,
For they pursue and prosecute their plot:
They gin to gnaw his bowels, and to rake
^is entrails with their nails; which pain does wake
^im from his latest sleep, and makes him cry
Aloud this counsel: Princes see ye trie^
Before ye trust, Those servants that be ill
"At your command, for others money will
"Betray you too: he easly will dispense
"With greatest sins, who has of small no sense.
"Beware of such as flatter by traduction,
"They Will first be others, then be your destruction.
"Beware of privy whisperers and spies,
"The truth they tell is but a sauce for lies.
Beware of Ledgers, for legerdemaine
With others beside Iuglers does remain:
"And cheating and crosse-biting Great ones may
"In great things use, as Little ones at play.
Beware of Clergy men their color changing,
And in each place with lawless freedom ranging.
Take heed of Pensions, they have often slept,
In priny Chambers, and at Counsel kept.
Philip Co^mineus. lib. ^. c^p. 2,
And if it be a truth which some have told,
Good men have had large sleeves to put up gold.
With that he dies, and those that were within,
Striving who first should greatest credit win,
By carrying news of this accursed deed,
Hinder each other in their hasty speed:
And issuing out just as his chaps did close,
Did their reward, life, fame, together lose.
"Yet ill report finds wings in every place;
And this unto the Seahorse flies apace;
Who (making too much have) in top of pride,
Nothing before, behind, nor bout him spide,
And so, for lack of care, himself betraide
Into a pit-fall which the Egyptians laid.
There he does pine to death, and dying cries,
"Who lives by treason, thus by treason dies.
Epimythium.
THe Crocodile is a Hieroglyphicke of Honor or Nobility.
The Hippopotame, of Impiety, Ingratitude, and ^enesse.
1. These two have continual war: and in that ^melion and Pol^pus (the types
of subtle dissimu^ion, and crafty hypocrisy), join with Hippopotam^ ^ainst
the Crocodile; it gives honor warning to be^re of such who adapt themselves to
please humors, sooth gross follies: for these though perhaps they ^me of their
color, wear their liueries, follow (...) religion whom they depend upon, will
notwith^nding for gain, Judas like, kiss and betray ^em.

2. In that the time when this was done, is said to in peace after sport: it
shows that Honor which ^ings from action, decaies with affectation of peace,
^d sleeps to death with immoderate pleasure in the ^mes or bed of security.

3. The touch of Torpedo warnes Greatness from ^oth, and to beware of such
charming Counselors hide the truth of dangers from the eyes of States.

4. Alcedos warning the Crocodile, tells us no danger ^mes without a^monition:
Wisdom cries out in ^e streets, it is our own fault if stopping our ears
^e perish wilfully.

5. In that Ch^schillus sings the Crocodile asleep, tells us, flattery is the
ruin of honor; yet the flat^rers note is sweeter, and wel-commer to the ear,
then the admonition of friendship and true love.

6. In that Ichneumon and Cuschillus leap into belly, it shows Treason will
pursue the blackest p^iect with most bloody and bold violence; and (...) strive
to double that sin with slander and misrepo^ which once they contrived,
applauded, and perh^ persuaded Greatness to commit.

7. In that Hippopotame falls into the Aegypti^ trap, it shows what the
Psalmist says, Who dig^ pit for another, falls therein himself. Treason e^
betrays the Traitor, else it were not right treason.

If any man enquire farther after this tale, let h^ call to mind the late
death of that renowned King France, whose life was terrible to Rome and her a^
her^nts.

He had many admonitions to beware of Iesuitic^ practices, but would not take
heed, his confiden^ might rather be termed presumption then courage.

I have heard a story of him which may be as true its strange: the probability
is great.

Monsieur D. Plessis (that glorious star of o^ age) being ever bold with the
King, because the ki^ knew him honest, and durst trust him farther then
Protestant Prince may trust a Popish Catholic wi^ safety, told his Master that
all the world did wond^ at the sudden repeal of that edict of banishment
solemnly made by the Parliament against all ^esuit^ upon so just an occasion as
the wounding of his sacr^ person by one of their disciples. He humbly besoug^
him to give him license to put him in mind ho^ once professing the reformed
religion, even in arme^ he had been defended from the treacheries of his
enemies by that God whose cause he fought for. But now in the arms of peace,
he was endangered by them who pretend his protection, for that they thought
that howsoever for some respects he carried himself, he could not be in love
with their darkness who had been acquainted with the true light: And the
Protestants thought so likewise, the rather induced hereunto by Gods miraculous
deliverance of him from the horror of that bloody attempt, not suffering any
part to be punished but his mouth with which he had offended. But he besought
him to remember that the hearts of Kings are in the hands of God as well as
their heads; and if they forsake or forget him and what he has done for them,
he in Justice often gives them ou^r into the hands of their enemies.

I enforce no man to believe this Narration; the ^robability, with the credit
of the Relator, and the ^uccesse, have prevailed with me to accept and repor^
^t. As his death was the damnable act of a Jesuitical Assasinat of the Romish
religion, so this admonition ^eares the shape of a true Israelit^ and one of
the house of peace.

PHAENIX.
DEDICATED To the honorable KNIGHT Sr. ROBERT RICH, and his noble LADY.
There Is but one Phaenix, is there had been more,
Your names had stood within, but now before.

Phaenix vnica dicitur este, auis, and in toto orb terrarum singularis. Isid.
THE Arabian Phaenix, being noble, young,
And newly from his fathers ashes sprung,
Seeing how other birds did lovers take
Of their own kind, would needs like tr^^ ma^^
And thought by what good course he might prevent
His doubted ruin, and seem provident,
Where nature (as he judged) defective stood,
In leaving single, such an absolute good.
His means was marriage, married he would be,
But where to choose a Mate he could not see:
For choose he might and please his curious eyne,
Each bird made suite to be his Valantine.
The Pehen dressed her self and spread her tail,
The Turkey^hen advanced her spotted sail.
The Turtle left her mate to join with him,
The Siluer-Swan, in ruffled pride did Swim,
The Parakite, and Goldfinch,, City heirs,
Offered him love, and what besides was theirs:
The courtly Pheasant gaudy Pop^niay,
In varied colors dressed themselves that day:
The sweet Canary singer strove t'excell
The merry-making mournful Ph^lomel;
Who left deploring, and did mirth preferre^
Wishing the Phaenix would have rauish't her.
All these, with all besides the rest excelling,
Did woo him, proffer love, their passions telling.
But all in vain; the bird of Paradise,
Had with her pleasing form bewitched his eyes.
He wooes, and winnes her too, with small ado,
"Where both desire, both parties seem to woo:
And who would not desire so rare a one,
Whom ^ll desire, him to enjoy alone?
They married are. Opinions equal voice,
Say both are happy in each others choice.
For she was fair, and rare, and rich, and young,
And wise, and noble, and full sweetly sung;
In ^ll complete she was, only did fail,
Having too small a body for her t^ile.
This fault she took by kind, it cost her naught,
From her birth place the frai^tie first she brought.
And though by all good means she strove to hide
This natural blemi^h, still it was espide.
And spied the more, because this corporal ill,
Being single here, did each man's fancy fill.
"That disproportion doubles in the mind,
"Where we it single in the body find.
And so it fell out here; not long they dwelt
In peace, but loves fire alteration felt,
And began to slake and cool, where it should not,
And where it should be cool, it waxed hot.
She now did hate and loath, the sweet she had,
And linger after something that was bad.
Her tail was too too large for him to tread,
He too too little her to ouer-spread.
To ouerspread her body was not much,
But her insatiate tail, and mind was such.
So weakest stomachs strongest meats desire.
So greatest smoke rises from smallest fire.
So slender wits great matters undertake.
So swift pursuit, does slow performance make.
So the appetite, by impotence is moved.
So she (though little) every great thing loved.
She loved all great things, and all rare things sought,
But what she had that she esteemed naught.
She had what others longed for, and enioyde
What all desired: and that enjoying cloyde.
And now she ginnes to hate, and wish in heart,
A fit occasion offered were to part.
But wanting such, she frames one: does traduce,
And wound his honor for her own excuse.
And still pretending modesty a cause,
Immodestly, she trial claims by laws.
Although the Phaenix her with tears did woo,
She separation sought, and gets it too.
The sentence past, she Cynosure does wed,
An unknown foul, by the air begot and bred.
He (following kind) trod often, and quenched her heat,
And she laid often, filled many a neast and seat
With addle eggs; but never bird did spring^
Out of those ^hells, nor other living thing.
Yet some in their opinions counted wise,
Say that such eggs do hatch the Cockatrice.
Yet nothing from these spurious Embrions came
But naked promises, and open shame.
In memory of whose unhappy womb,
That brought dead fruit forth, like a living tomb,
(Dead fruit, much like fair apples all of smoke,
Which grow in Sodom, and the eaters choke,)
Each courtly lady now upon their head,
Do wear a bird of Paradise, instead
Of a light feather; which does warning give,
How free from lightness, Ladies ought to live:
How constant they should be, how firm in love:
Not feather-like, apt with each breath to move.
How well proportioned, not so great below,
But less in show, and more in truth to know.
To fit the bottom with an equal sail,
And not to ouer-top the head with tail.
All this it tells them, and does show beside,
"How addle eggs spring out of lust, and pride.
"How noble houses by ignoble deeds,
"Bury themselves and their own ruin br^eds.
"How beauty and all vert^es of the mind,
"Conioynde with wealth, adorn not woman kind:
"Except with these, true chastity be placed,
"And that again, by modesty be graced.
And now I will proceed to tell my story,
How sad the Phaenix was in mind, how sorry
To be so slighted and so ill respected,
By her for whose sake, he had all neglected.
This wounds his heart, and he resolves too late,
All second matches for the first to hate;
To live alone, and never more to mind
Fond alteration, in the course of kind.
But grief perp^ex't him so, he feared to die,
E^^^e were fitted for posterity.
And so his neast unmade, he quickly might,
Both life, and nam^, and memory loose outright
This to pre^ent, his ^light he nimbly takes
Over hill^s and dales, over deserts, riu^rs, lakes,
Over kingdoms, countries, bounding East and West,
And spices gathers up to build his neast.
Which made, and finding still ^is former grief,
Not cured but growing desperate of relief,
Him better seemed by p^iuiledge of kind,
To kill his body, and renew his mind:
To leave g^iefe where it breeds with earth on earth,
And ^ecr^ate his spirit with spritly birth,
(Li^^ ^re, which touching powder straight resolves
T^^ grosser parts; and eac^ it self inuolues
In its own element) then so t'out wear
And tire away with grief six hundred year,
(For so long lives the Phae^ix) but thought he,
"So long ^e dies that lives in misery.
And therefore soon betakes him to his neast,
Wherefore-prep^r'd he finds his funeral dressed.
The Sun shi^es bright and hot, he with his wings
Makes more the heat: and sparkling diamond brings,
Whose strong reflection, or retention rather
Either beats back the heat, or heat does gather.
Which kindled (like dried leaves with burning glasses)
Consumes the neast, and bird, and all to ashes.
Upon these ashes fruitful dewes descend,
And the hot Sun his active beams do b^nd.
So heat and moisture twixt them procreate,
A silly worm unlike the bird in state.
But time does give it growth, and shape, and feathers,
And still perfection from each hour it gathers.
Till to the former equal it appears,
Or rather all one bird, except in years.
The ravenous Vulture wondering long had stood
To mark all this, within a neighbor wood.
Which having seen, ambition pricks her so,
That she resolves what'euer power says no,
Example and direction hence to take,
Her self and hers all Phaenixes to make.
So calls she first the He, and then the young:
And thus began speak to them with ravished tongue.
How much my power has done, how much my wit,
You know, yet know some repetition fit.
I do the Eagle rule, (the birds brave King)
And work him to my mind in every thing.
He preyes on whom I list; still on the best;
Eats what I stint him, and leaves you the rest.
I govern every Hawke, or bird of prey;
Such as confront the Eagle, me obey;
And make me sharer in their richest prize,
And how to please me best, best means devise.
I that despise Religion, scorn all law,
Do bind all other birds to both by awe:
To both for my advantage, else you know
I can profane the Temple well enough;
Pollute the Altar; search the grave, each tomb,
And dig out of the privileged womb
Of hallowed earth, dainties for you to lurch,
Man's flesh, enshrined in the sacred Church.
You know I foster Soldiers not for love,
But to breed wars; the slain my prey still prove.
All sorts, professions, kinds, I prey upon,
When their sweet slesh is turned to carrion.
For carrion is my food, let others kill
And hazard life for life, we safely will
Eat the unfortunate, the weak, distressed,
Whom want enfeebled, mighty power oppressed.
This is our practice. But I called ye now
For higher aims: to give you notice how
We may aspire in royalty and pride
Above the Eagle, and all birds beside.
Much time, much study, with full large ^xpence,
Have I bestowed, to gain^ intelligence
Of a rare secret, which exceeds far
The Alchi^isters Idol, called the Elixar.
This is, to understand and know aright,
What course to take, and how we compass might
The glorious eminence, the singular grace,
The famous Phaenix has in every place:
How to attain her nature, beauty, state;
And without copulatio^ procreate.
At l^ngth my wit, my industry, and chance
Concurring, did this happiness aduance^
For watching lately, as I often did,
In desert vast, among thick bushes hid,
I saw (unseen) the mystery throughout,
And can resolve each rite, each scrupulous doubt.
The circumstance were needless, whilst the fact
Shall manifest each several Scene, and act,
With happy issue; and accomplish so
Our wishes, that we shall amazed go;
Amazed go, to see our selves so low,
So soon to such a pitch of glory grow:
So soon translated, metamorphosed,
And new created from the foot to head:
Beyond our hopes, report, the present station
Of other birds, almost to adoration.
Enquire not how, but each prepare t'obay,
What I command; performance leads the way.
Hie on, hie all, to several quarters fly,
And through the whole world make a scrutinie
For aromatic drugges, perfuming spices,
Rare precious stones, rich jewels, strange devices.
Bring them together, lay them on this hill,
And the success refer to my deep skill.
The young ones all obayde, but then the Male
Staid long t'enquire the reason of this tale.
Yet long he durst not stay, lest she from thence
Should beat him for his arrogant offense:
For females of all ravening fowls bear sway,
And the black Vulture is a bird of prey.
The male never meddles with young, meat, or nest:
But she commands, and he sits like a guest.
He seeing her incenst, away does post
Ore many Seas, and many an unknown Coast,
And all the world surueyes from East to West,
From North to South, and gathers what is best;
Sweet odoriferous spices, ambergris,
The Castors stones, the Ermins spotted fleene,
Rich Luzerns, Sables, Martins, and the horee
Of the most precious-seld-seen V^icorne.
The Musk-cats cod, with Rubies blushing red,
Quick-sparkling Diamonds cutting glass like lead;
Bright shining Carbuncles, and Saphires blew,
With Iasp^r, Iacynth; Emerals green in view;
Perspicuous Crystal, orient Pearls large, round,
And Gold, for which man does the Center sound;
Black, white, green, marble; in-laid Porphyrie,
With Alablasters for Imagerie:
Truth-trying Touch-stones, making things distinct,
And what rariety else within precinct
Of ample Nature dwells, they hither brought;
With which a curious neast she neatly wrought,
To match whose wealth remaining earth was base.
Her self, Mate, young, each by themselves had place
In this most royal building. Then in state
Her self sat down, and next her musing Mate.
Her young ones, then in orde^, One by One,
And now the Sun shined hot on every stone
The spice began kindle. Now quoth she I find
My self half made immortal changing kind.
The fire flamed fiercer then, and singed their wings:
Be constant Sirs quoth she, you shall be Kings.
"Gold crowns are heavy, toil is hard but gainful;
"There is no excellent sweet but first is painful.
They would have flowne away, but 'twas too late.
Quoth she the Phaenix dies to live in state.
With that she sinkes, her neast and all combust
Her glorious hopes, and proiects turned to dust.
Which tells us this: Pride still does ouer-build.
^Folly is not in architecture skilled.
^Wit frames his Plot according to his state,
^And to a small house makes no lofty gate.
^But ouer-bold Ambition fires her neast,
^And proves her houses shame, her house a jest.
Epimythium.
The Phaenix betokens unity in Religion. This was proper to the Iew^s, but
they forsook it, as the bird of Paradise did the Phaenix. Then it came to the
Gentiles and seemed to return to its own nature to be universal, not tied to
place, or Nation, or person. The Phaenix died, and out of the ashes arose a new
Phae^ix. Christ came not to destroy but fulfill the Law. The old faith remains
which was first preached in Paradise, the ceremonies only are abolish^d by the
pr^sence of the thing signified. That seems another, which is the same truth.
We Christians possess what the Jews expected. They are divorced (with the
bird of Paradise) for their unfaithfulness and unbelief; now they are wedded
to the Cynosure their own wills and stiff-necked opinions and traditions. They
tread and cac^le, and lay eggs; addle eggs or rather adders eggs, eggs of
wind without fruit, which never prove birds. They expect in vain an other
Messiah to save them, till the true Messiah is ready to come to judge them.
They are a scattred people, hateful to all where they inhabit.

The ^Vulture and her brood is the Clergy of Rome; where the she or female
preuailes. She will be called the Mother Church, which is truly the whore of
Babylon, the malignant Church, the Adversary, the Antichrist. She builds to
her own ruin, her power and policy shall overthrow it self. She shall
burn in her own nest. Let all such therefore as love the truth, and would
save their souls, come out of her.

VNIO.
DEDICATED TO THE TRVE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY Sr. ARTHVR HEVENINGHAM Knight, and
his truly Religious LADY.
YOU know the moodes of Men, the tempers too
Of Climes, of States, of Elements; Then who
May better read this tale? The mind that is free
Can judge diseases, and distempers see.

THE Mole, Chamelion, and the Salamander,
As near the Ocean they together wander,
Spying at sea the Lamprey, haild him thus^
Good day my friend to you and eke to us.
We three are met to argue and debate
Which of us lives in the happiest state;
Whether the air, the earth, or fire does give
To what they breed best sustenance to live.
And we would gladly hear how far the sea
May with fire, air, and earth compared be.
You happily we met as we would wish,
Being a prompt, deep diuing, subtle fish,
And ablest to resolve us. Come then show
The life you lead, and learn our lives to know.
The Lamprey soon consents. And first the Mole

Does thus begin. Dear friends I left my hole
To breath the open air (whose light I hate)
T'acquaint ye with the blessings of my state.
And to persuade ye, if you love your rest
To live with me in peace, and plenty blessed.
It fits me first to speak, for I had first
My being, long before the earth was cursed.
Darkness was not created; it is as old
As that great workman which the whole does mold
But light was made long after, and does show,
That ignorance is elder then to know.
The workmans self in cloudy darkness keeps;
For no eye sees or when he wakes or sleeps.
He loves not every curious fool should see
What joys, what treasures, in oblivion be.
The worthy Grecian would have learned that Art,
For ignorance is wisdoms better part.
When all was Chaos first the Center stood,
And all the solid parts, called Earth. The flood
Was next being ponderous. The air flew higher;
And as a hedge to all was placed fire.
What first was placed was worthiest, and brought fort^
The first of creatures, and best things of worth.
And first it brought forth things that were below;
The root had life, before the fruit did g^ow.
And we (earths darlings) had our shape within
Ere you without. Nor do the effects of sin
(Ambitious sin which light and'knowledge sought
And (fondly curious) blind obedience thought
A base director) so afflict and kill
Us h^re within; as you who share in ill
Of punishment and guilt, with foolish man;
Yet no way from his rule acquit ye can.
You dwell with him, and dye with him. But we
Are earth by nature, procreated free.
And our forefathers customs still obey,
Do as they did, and follow their blind way.
Not striving busily our wits t'approue
By searching doubts, but rather show our love,
By loving eu^n their errors that are gone, Humnm degerit Talpa, and radices
subt^a comedit and corrodit. Isid^ ^. 12.

Or reverently believing they had none.
Our diet is most choice, on roots to feed,
And relish first the sweet of every seed.
You live on the excrement, and do not know,
That fundamental virtue springs below.
Besides you live like slaves, but I am free,
Though bloudy-minded Man often seeks for me.
The Lyo^ did pretend because I have
Four feet, that I by nature was his slave:
He called for this a Council, sent for me
To swear to his servile supremacy.
But I (refusing the oath) to spite him more
Did undermine his Councell-chamber flore
And had not light (damn d light) my plot bewraide^
He had to hell s^nke by the train I laid.
But light discovered me, and since that deed
I loath light more, and so in darkness breed.
Darkness thou sweet companion, friend of sleep,
How I delight in thee. With thee does keep
All that man seeks for, every secret plot,
Dark mystery, close sttatagem; what not?
Invisible wealth, with treasures manifold,
But chief Man's soul, his god, almighty gold.
This Man knows well, and knowing learnes of me
To dig and delue till in his grave he be.
Then all proclaim him happy: say he is
Omnia corrumpuntur in ea ex quibus sunt. Ar^ lib. 3. Metaphy.
At peace and rest, and does emoy all bliss.
And such say truth: for he returns again
To his first being, and does so remain.
"Contentment with dark ignorance does dwell,
"And light and knowledge only makes hell.
Then without farther strife live all with me,
If you will taste no pains, nor errors see.
The changeable Chamelion laughed outright,
To hear the blind Mole rail so much at light.
And said; Your darker spirits cannot conceive,
The blessed fruit, that we from light receive.
Let fools depend on faith implicatiue,
Wisemen into the depth of truth will diue.
Darkness and ignorance, which you suppose
Tenebrae sunt priuatio luminis. Arist. l. 2. de anima^ Arist^ de gener. and
corrup. lib. 1.
Had an eternal being, are the foes
Of all eternal beings; and indeed
Are void in nature without fruit, root, seed.
Darkness is but the absence of clear light.
As error is the ignorance of right.
So these two are vacuities, want being;
Not seen by others, nor yet others seeing.
From nothing, nothing springs; something there was
From whence this universal frame, this Mass
Of strange agreeing contrarieties,
Had essence: and 'twas something that had eyes:
For sure it was not ignorance, nor night,
They could not see to order things so right.
But it was knowledge, wisdom, light, and truth,
Figured in mature age, and active youth.
The privilege you plead, Antiquity, Talpa sol^ odit and fugit Isid. Omne
animal generans; sibi similes habet oculos praeter talpam, etc. Arist.. Talpa
non hab^t oculos quia in generatione e^us natural editur. Arist^ l. 4. de
animal^ Talpa rostrum habe^ ^d modum porci.

Proves only, that of old you us de to lie;
And that all truth you hate, for truth does run
Still to the light, and you the light do shun.
And where you challenge your creation first;
It is not like, Nature would make the worst
Before the best; except this can prefer
Your claim, that as young workmen use to err
In their first works; so Nature first did try
To make right eyes, by making yours awry.
Much rather truth it is, she did bestow,
Labor in framing others; but for you,
She left you to corruption, night, and chance,
Which made you^ eyes such, such your countenance.
And your tame-blinde obedience well befits
Such earth-bred, doltish, dull, and sluggish wits.
But ayerie Spirits acquainted with the light,
Will not be led by custom from the right.
No love, no friends, no predecessor shall
Pervert their judgments; they examine all.
And for the food ye boast to eat boast still;
No root, herb, fruit of yours, I handle will.
They are corr^pted. Air does only give
True nourishment, and happiest means to live.
The sick-man shows this, who the weather fair,
Remooues for health, from close to the open air.
Talpa. Cor^um rump^tur qu^^do incipit mo^i, and ^um ^^^pit ap^rire oc^los^
A^^st.
And for the light, your death does it approve;
When onl^ then your eyes are seen to move.
Then you begin to see, and loath the kind
Which being blind themselves brought you up blind,
Bereauing you of many a bles^ed sight,
Which we enjoy, ^ho love and live in light.
Your freedom from all beasts I like. It Is ill
^o be s^bi^cted to another will:
A^r fit Came leonti cibus. Chameleon gyrat oculos ^uos frequenter circumqueque.
Arist.
B^t that to your superiors I do hate,
And therefore am exilde from every state:
I live a poor thin creature, by the air;
My self I feed with hopes, others with prayer.
My eyes I often lift up, and roole about,
D^siring to be s^en to be d^uout.
But neither with my bulk, nor with my back
Supply the l^ast defect of others lack.
I bear no Wooli to clothe, no flesh to feed;
Let sh^ep, and Calves, relecue the poor that need.
I ravished go with a distracted look,
And turn my mind, still, as I turn my book,
My will does lead my conscience, not my wit.
And every riddle for my purpose fit:
Hating whats'ere is old, I love the new
And to all purposes, change my ready hue.
My flesh is low, my spirit high and proud
Illud. quod est in corpore ^uo est modicae carnis.
Does contradict what order has allowed.
I fast when others feast, feast when they fast,
And with Angelical food, I do out-last
All Gormandiz^rs. Come then, live with me
All that love life, and light, and would be free.
The Salamander hearing this discourse,
Said. Sure you both do argue without force.
Dark ignorance our nature does contemn:
And curious search wise Magistrates condemn
By blindness we our wants and dotage show:
To those, not reverence but reproach is due.
Not privative blindn^sse, our antiquity shows,
But only that which by long seeing grows.
But you blind Mole do ignorance affect,
Which breeds derision, scorn and dis-respect.
For what a sensel^sse part is this in you,
Your fathers ^aults and errors to allow?
And not much rather to reform your own,
By shunning the defects, which they have shown?
Your food is gross and earthly; dirt and mould
Mixed with old roots, do much corruption hold.
Yet (though they gin to die, with age and wither)
The good with bad (being old) you cram together.
This makes my fiery spirit scorn to keep
I^ your dark celles, where knowledge seems to sleep.
But you Chameleon with a hand too bold,
Oppose, contemn, and scorn, whats'ere is old.
You only love to see, but not to do,
You dote on knowledge and on error too.
"It Is error, in our sight to ou^r^eene,
"And but our own, all judgments dis-esteeme:
"It Is error to be fondly ouer-wise,
"Too pure, too just, too perfect, too precise.
There is a meane^ For knowledge sure does live
"Only, where it does good to others give.
You too too saucy hidden secrets handle,
And too too fond your o^ne conceits do dandle,
And cocker with observance: being so
A friend to superstition, though a foe.
Corpus pellucidum illum inatur per reflectionem, corpus coeleste solum per se.
Com. in Arist. lib. 1. Met. Lux est visibilis per se: color vero mediaute luce.
Com. in Ar. l. 2. de Anima.
The light you use, is borrowed not your own,
The colors that you see, their ground unknown.
Your dark imperfect, double glimmering sight,
Is but the extended beams of greater light.
Arising from vicinitie of fire,
To which the purest elements aspire
In their refined parts; the earth in gold
And precious stones, do most resemblance hold;
The sea in salt, in Pearls, in dewes that rise,
And to the Sonne-ward with ambition flies;
The Air in colous and in Meteors bright,
Which the Suns place usurp in darkest night.
It Is fire alone that searches and refines,
And does divide the gross from purer mines.
It Is fire that makes grass, herb, andtree to grow:
Meltes the seas Icie chains, and the earths cold snow.
It cheares the young, it cherishes the old,
Omnia elementa putresiunt preter ignem. Arist. l. 4. Meteo.
Reuiues the dying, makes the Coward bold.
Nothing without it can be said to live,
Whats'ere has being, it does glory give.
Which makes me to determine, that the light
Which you invisible call, is but a sprite
Made by your fear, and strong imagination,
Without true being, essence, or foundation.
Stellae e^^^ non vidatur de die propter lumen solis ^om. Ar. l. 2. de Anima.
For light the greater it is, does more appear;
So should that light of lights, if such there were.
My indgement therefore in this rule does run,
There Is nothing greater then the glorious Sun,
Here I set down my rest. And for the schools,
That teach belief, let them still tutor fools.
From your contention, my instruction sprung;
And thus I learned to think when I was young.
The Mole does feed too much on earthly meat,
And the Chameleon naught but air does eat.
I neither like your fast, nor yet your feasting, Salamar^ drae tantus est

For twixt you two all earnest turns to ieasting.
And does persuade me think, there is no food,
In earth or air, that does or hurt, or good.
So all my knowledge, practice, life, does chime,
According to the current, state, and time.
I think they are only gulls that live in awe
Of any thing but want, death, and the law.
I quench all fiery zeal wheres'ere I come;
And would have Policy speak, Religion dumb.
I poison with my breath, both foe and friend,
And to my pleasuredo^ each project bend:
In brief I only am a freeman borne,
Who love my self alone, and others scorn.
The Lamprey hearing this damned Atheist tell,
A tale befitting none b^t Machiuael,
Thrust his eye-guarded h^ad above the brim,
Of the rug'd waues^ and to the shore did swim.
And on his slippery belly began to slide,
Till he came near the Salamanders side.
Thou cursed slave (q^oth he) though I proceed
From some of thy near kin, of serpents seed.
And am half serpent, as thou wholly art,
Yet I am half a fish; and even that part
Prouokes me contradict the cursed note,
Which thou did vomit from thy venomd throat.
Thy Pedigree is lineally detiued
From that great Serpent, which at first deprived
The rest of feet; and being ouer-wise
Gulled credulous man of glorious paradise.
Still thou partak'st that nature, and each tree,
Thy tongue or teeth touch, so infected be
In root and fruit, that who so eats does die,
Poisoned b'accurst, cold infidelity.
Too light belief, and too too earnest thirst
Of curious knowledge, causde death enter first:
But now thy skill has brought it so about,
That hearing, seeing, feeling, still we doubt.
And flying one extreme, we fondly fall
Into the contrary; wise, fools, and all.
"Yet blindness better is, then having eyes,
"Not t'acknowledge truths, but count them lye^.
Dubitato. ^um solummodo ^st veritatis inquisit^o. A^stot. Me^. l. 3.
"It Is better to be doubtful what we know,
"Then to be Truths professed and open foe.
The Mole and the Chameleon better are,
And nearer truth, then thou thy self by far.
Yet the Cham^leon somewhat does resemble
Thy nature, but he can more close dissemble.
He is not so profane, so impious, bold,
To call all truth in doubt, both new and old;
Though he gives darkness not the praise he ought,
And too too curious, after knowledge sought:
Yet he confesses that there is a light
He cannot see, through the impotence of sight.
But you all light and knowledge do confine
Within the Sun, as if it were divine:
And like a desperate traitor, foolish thief,
From art and nature steal, to kill belief.
Come then good fellows (quoth the Lamprey) take
This monster up against us; let us make
Him an exampl^ of our justice shown,
Upon Truths foe, so manifestly known.
With that he nimbly twines himself about
The Salamander (being quick and stour:)
Chameleon and the Mole, the Lampr^y aid
Which makes the Salamander much disinay'd.
Yet he does lay about with tongue, teeth, nails,
And bites them all, but odds at length pr^uailes.
And they remaining victors cast him down
From the steep cliffe, and so the Atheist drown.
Then coming back, they two the Lamprey pray
His wi^e opinion of their st^ife to say:
That they may know to which part he enclines
Whether to darkness, or where spl ndor shines.
He soon consents, and tells how he (by kind
B^ed and brought up in ^u^) is of the mind
The Mole spoke truth. For happiness (quoth he)
"Consists in what we have, not what we see.
And sight prouokes us wish, and covet change
And so in boundl^sse, endless, toil we range.
"He that knows most, knows best what he does miss,
"The loss of Parad^se is only this.
"The simple innocent truth this instance fameth;
"Man in the dark being naked nothing shameth.
Thus he discourst, then tells how he behaues
Himself in darkn^sse, vnder^eath the waves.
How he prefers old gnorance, before
N^w K^owledge, and (I wot) knows cause therefore.
Shows how for this opinion he was brought
Before the Whale, yet long in vain was sought:
Tells how he scapes the sear^h b^ many creeks
And winding holes, when Hipp^a him seeks:
For they (Phoenician Cre^ishes being swift)
Are Purseuants which he can hardly shift:
Yet he has learned counsel, who directs
His whole proceeding when he ought suspects.
First subtle Polypus to whom he cleaues,
And seeming part of him the search deceaues.
The turbulent Cuttle, who does raise the mud,
And such a color mingle with the flood,
That no eye can discover where he lies,
And so he often scapes the crafty spies.
L^mprey quasi Lampetra^ Of licking rocks. Camden.
Then creepes to stones that lie on silt and sand,
(Not to the cornerstone on steadfast land^)
And if by chance they find him spite of these,
And so attach him, then he can with ease
Slip through their fingers, or himself unwind,
By leaving some part of his slime behind.
He can equivocate, and double so,
That ^uery way at once he seems to go.
Yet once he taken was, and brought to trial,
Where with his doubtful answer^, stif^e denial,
Low crowching, smoth conueyance, flattering guise
He escaped the Exchequer, Prison, and the A^s;si^e.
Then being asked, why darker ignorance
Before the light he did in speech advance.
He answers, first it was to try his wit;
Not that he held it, to be true or fit.
Again, because ^inall use of light he had,
He to make some fools like himself was glad^
With these slye answers, and great friends beside,
Bribes are faithful friends, for gifts corrupt the wise.
And faithful bribes, he did from danger glide:
And such fe^'d friends he had in every Court,
And every office, at the least report
Of threatened danger rounded him in the ear
To shift ^is scat, before the storm came near.
^en shows he how the better to disguise
^is double face, he had two rows of eyes:
^s though he loved all knowledge, and all light.
^ut (quoth he) only two of these have ^ight;
^he rest are hypocritical and blind:
^et their appearance calmes the Whales fierce mind
those easy nature open to abuse,
^akes show for substance, color for excuse.

^ll which shall turn unto the Whales destruction:
^euer great fish, move but insurrection:
^or I Will discover all when time shall fit;
Who trusts a half friend, has not half his wit.
^hil'st thus he argued, and the Mol^ grew proud,
^o hear affected ignorance allowed:
and that so many in that large dominion,
^emain'd vpholders of his stiff opinion.
^he thin Cham^le^n began look big and swell,
and each complained himself he was not well,
^ut then too late, they found how they were stung
and poisoned by the Salamanders tongue.
^here was no help, but die they must. In vain
^hey weep; and each to other show their pain,
^ill Justice did by death their pain conclude,
^ith tragic end closing their interlude.
Epimythium.
The Mole is the blind, obstinate, refractary Romish Catholic, who has no
other answer or reason for any article of faith, or point of religion, but
this: My predecessors were of this opinion, and they were wiser then I am. His
Positions are. 1. Ignorantia est matter de^otionis. 2. Caeca obedientia meruit
ex condigno. 3. ^ides implicatiua sufficit. He obeyes that which he calls the
mother Church, before God, who is his heavenly Father. For he had rather break
ten of his commandments then one of hers. Gods Sabbath day is his play^day,
and every Saints day, his Sabbath. What he spends on Christmas day, he spares
on Ashwednesday, and Goodfriday. And this is his general rule, two fasting
days, makes the third a glutton.

The Chameleon is in England a Familist, at Amsterdam a Brownist, further on an
anabaptist He lives by the air, and there builds Castles and Churches^ none on
the earth will please him. He would be of the triumphant and glorious Church,
but not of the terrene militant Church, which is subject to storms,
deformities, and many violences and alterations of time; he must findeout Sr.
Thomas Mores Vtopia, or rather Platoes Community, and be an Elder there: In
this point, and in that of r^^isting civil governors, he seems the same with
the Romish Catholic. But they are tide only by the tails, like Sampsons
foxes, their heads like Ianus look diverse ways. They are Boutefewes and carry
betwixt them a firebrand to inflame all Christendom. They have in the
imagination an Idea of ^uch a Church, and such keys as the Romanists mad^
boast they poss^sse: but they will not have them the ^me, nor to resemble
theirs. Foolish Alchimisters ^hey are both, seeking a Ph^^osophers stone, and
neg^ecting the true Elixar, the Corn^r-stone. They boast ^o build gold on the
foundation, when what they ^aube on is adulterate stuff, laid b^side the
founda^ion. They beggar themselves in s^^king for wealth ^broad, whilst at
home they neglect that Pearl of in^^tinable price, for which the wise M^rchant
gives al that he is worth. If ever I could hear Papist clear ^he Pope from
being Antichrist and prove he must be ^ne singular person, I would then
believe that he should not spring from a ^ew of the tribe of Dan, as ^hey
fable, but from a promiscuous conjunction be^wixt two fugitives, to Amsterdam,
and Rome.

The Salamander is the Atheist, he is contrary to himself, and hateful to
others; he poisons all with whom he con^erseth, and knows some Philosophy ^no
Divinity. He seeks all wisdom in himself, where the Tutor is the Master
fool; and is so inquisitiue after the cause, that he forge^s both the and and
the causer. His reason is his god, and that being false, is not able to direct
him to search and see the true God. Thus he is drowned in the sea of his own
foolish and boundless imaginations^ and being (...) a pretty child, is

The Lamprey is the subtle shotten Catholic or Church Papist. He coosins the
law and his own sou^ too. He is worse to trust then the open and professed (...)

H^ is neither fish nor fle^h; but half fish, an^ half Serpent, as they s^y
which write of the generation of the Lamprey. A man may easily surfeit of such
meat, and a S^ate so ^ne endanger it self by suffering such to increase.
There is no law can meet with their fraud. The Churchwarden is the
Coppiholder. The Parson is his Chaplain. These dare not present him. A fine
will undo the first, and a prohibition begge^ the other: yet these the law
presumes must first speak or none. If these do their office, the I weary are
perhaps his tenants; he is a Justice of peace, a great man their neighbor. If
they find him guilty, there are pillars in the Excheaquer: or if these fail,
a friend or kinsman in Court makes all sure. These escape thus themselves, and
shelter others in their houses and abroad. Because the State through conniuence
accepting a weak and imperfect show of conformity, gives credit to their
conuersions, and intru^ts them in place where they may do much hurt. The
goods, leases and moneys of the meaner and more resolute sort are past over to
these, and pass free under their privileges and protections. The Character to
know these is this. They come to Church once a month, and then when Prayers
are done and the Psalms sung, p^rhaps at the beginning of the Sermon. They are
prag naticall, and have for the most part trauail'^ and ^rought home ignorance:
They are stiff and inflexi^le, and call it strength to oppose truth and
reason. They extol foreign government, and slight all domesticke graces.
They magnify the Infanta, the Archduke, and Spinola; but vilify his
Excellence and the States. They will dispu^e scandalls^ or what may seem
scandalous, and that only at tables, where if you stop their mouths with
argument, they pretend they could say more, but that their mouths are stopped
with meat. They travail still on Sundaies, and remove against Easter.

Struthiocamelus.
DEDICATED To the virtuous Knight, Sir John Heueningham, and his charitable
Lady.
What on our selves we spend, does through us pa^
And leave us ^aked, as this Ostrich was:
This makes you on the poor bestow so much,
And no expense but own your selves to grutch.

A Wealthy Merchant late in Barbary,
Through sandy deserts passing; chanced to sp^
An Ostrich eating iron which he found,
By Travelers scattered upon the ground:
Tantae caliditatis est Stru^hiocamelus quod ferrum deglutit, dirigit and
co^sumit Isisid.
Quoth then this Merchant; prithee let me know,
What nourishment, can from those metals grow?
The Ostrich answers; Sir I do not eat
This iron, as you think I do, for meat.
I only keep it, lay it up in store,
To help my needy friends, and friendlesse poor.
I often mere (as far and near I go)
Many a fow^dred horse that wants a shoe:
Se^uing a Master that is money-lesse:
Such I relieve and help in their distress.
With travelers I meet that are beset
By thieves and ^obbers often. Then I beget
My self a^ong the thickest, and present
Out of my ^aw a pistol ready bent,
A sword and dagger, or some such like tool,
To help the true man, and the thief to cool.
The Merchant mus'de (as well he might) at this,
And thought within himself; this fellow is
Most fit for my employment, I will straight
Hire him to be my Bailiefe. No deceit
Lurkes in his simple show; he will surely keep,
My plow-yrons, when my lazy hindes do sleep.
This to the Ostrich motion'd, he agrees,
The wages are set down, the vailes, the fees,
The liuory, with circumstance enough,
And they come home^ And now God speed the (...)
The Ostrich carefully lays up the rakes,
The pitch-forke teines, the yron-pointed stakes,
The wedges, hammer, hatchet, and the nails,
The sith, the sickle, and the biles of pailes,
The share, the coulter, heele-yorne, and the cock,
The whip, the horse^ shoe, with the key and lock.
He needs no lock and key to keep them under,
But keeps both lock and key, where you would wonder.
Then comes into the house, puts up the gun,
The sword and dagger; and when this is done,
Deuoures the dripping-pan, the cob-irons, spit,
And swallows all the iron bit by bit.
The Merchant praised his fortune, that he had
Got one so good, amongst many servants bad.
Told him he shortly would his state prefer,
From being Bailiffe, to be Treasurer;
For he could not invent a surer hold,
Then the Ostrich had for silver, or for gold.
And now the Merchant leaving one at home,
That he may well trust, goes abroad to rome:
Neglects his house and lands, thinks all is well,
And as he wont to do, does buy and sell.
Among other things he sold, because the wars
Began afresh, he truct for iron bars.
For he was one of those that would for gain:
Sell bullets, where they were shot home again,
And did our Mines and Woods on Ordnance wast,
Which spite of laws, he to the Enemy past,
Much yrone he had at home, and sold beside
All kind of armor fit for such a tide.
So home he comes glad of so good a mart,
For here he knows the Ostrich plays the part
Of a good Bailiffe. He may easily thrive,
When such a full wind does his fortune drive.
His land he finds vntill'd, he wonders then
And thinks the fault rests on his lazy Men.
They say they wanted yrons for the plough,
He wonders, for the Bailiffe had enough.
He finds his house all naked, not a bit
Of meat prepared, the Cook wants pot, and spit^
He goes to bed, the thieves assault his house:
He has no weapon to resist a Mouse.
H^ rises early, looks for his munition,
The place remains, no iron in fruition.
His bars are gone, his household stuff, and all,
Now to account his Bayliffe he does call.
The Servants join in their petition first,
And show their griefs, ^ow hard he was, and cursed.
How he kept back their wages and their meat,
And gave them work, but gave them not to eat.
How he near hand had made a monstrous neast,
Where whilst they fasted, he and his did feast.
And thither he conuaide the iron work
Where the she Ostrich and his young did lurk;
Who swallowed all: for they have mawes as large
As culuerings, which would as soon discharge
The iron load; and sooner far would spend,
And bring a world of wealth to lavish end.
The Ostrich to excuse himself bewraies
The place where safely he this iron lays.
Carries him to a private hole, where still
He dung'd, when he his maw did ouer-fill.
Quoth he if you can good distinction make,
Each several piece you may from hence vptake.
The plow-geares, cart-geares, and the tool for war, Stercusferri eximium
rarumque medicamentum ad omnesiocineris and splenis obstructiones. Mathiol^

Spits, pots, and cobirons, here together are.
Each wedge, knife, hammer, and the smallest nail,
Drawn lymbick wise through stomach, guts and tail
It Is a rare chymicall extraction now,
Better then all the drugs the Mount-bankes show.
It passes our elixar, or the stone^
Sought for by many, but attaind by none.
The obstruction of the Liver, and the spleen,
It opens, mollifies, and purges clean.
A secret it is assured, for madness, folly,

It cures the Gout, and qualifies the cause,
Suppling a hide-bound purse like the oil of laws:
It dries up humors, humors that a bound,
And man's weak body it makes safe and sound.
The merchant stood amazed, but at the last,
He seazde upon the Ostrich, held him fast:
Made him be tide be^inde a horse, and stripped,
They are called his eggs, because he trod the hen that laid them.
(His buttocks bare as now they be) and whipped.
Ransackt his neast, and brake before his face
His eggs, though his poor Hen in hope of grace,
Did sue for their repriuall. But in vain,
He look^s to find his Iron there again.
Which missing he proceeds, exiles him quite,
And then upon his gate this note does write.
Let Rich-men wisely fear,
All such as feathers wear,
It Is lost whats'ere they borrow,
And soon their mawes goes through:
The substance they consume
To naught but smoke and rheum;
But the use they never fail
To pay with tongue and tail.
Naturaliter equum odit Aren^m fodit and ibi ponit oua ^ua quae fabulocooperit
and regi^
The Ostrich ever since his breeches lost,
Goes like a naked rogue at whipping post.
He hates a horse to death since he was stripped,
And for his fault, ti'de at his tail and whipped.
He hides his eggs, and couers them from sight,
Lest man should find and break them. Thus they write.
Epimythium.
THe Merchant. figur^th Parsimony, the Ostricl prodigality; what the one
gathers, the other spends. Ages, nations, and particular persons have their
alternall variations and vicissitudes, even in gathering and expense, as in all
other passages. ^There be few scraping fathe^s, but their children prove witty
scatterers, or foolish retainers: experience of many ages scarce produce one
contradiction to this general observation. The father vs^th no more diligence
in damning his soul by getting goods unlawfully, then the son does in
sp^nding them prodigally: Let this therefore learn Usurers, Ingrossers, and
Oppressors of all professions, (if they love their wealth, and would not have
it wasted; or love their children, and would not have them undone) to secure
their estates rather from their children, then for them. It is not the want,
but the enjoying of abundance that undoes many men. The rich father who dares
bestow nothing on himself; and the prodigal son that spends all on others,
and keeps nothing for himself, are the miserablest beggars in the world.
Others have pity and provision to help them, t^ese nothing but derision and
scorn. No Hospital will entertain them; only the father finds room in
Bedlame, and the son a hole in the Counter, or a dungeon in Newgate.

ONOCROTALVS.
DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT hopeful KNIGHT, Sir THOMAS SOVTHVVELL.
YOur name has long been mist, now fairly rise
And make your Country flourish. All our eyes
Are cast upon your actions; then on us
Reflect your love. Shun Onocrotalus.

^nocrotaus est auis luos ha^ens vte^os. In vno ^ecipit, in (...) deco^uit.
Isid.
VVHilome within the Persian gulf did haunt
A foul much like our greedy Cormorant,
Called Onocrotalus, who used to prey,
On fish, or foul, or beast which past his way.
He had a crop under his bosom wide,
In compass like a sack, and thereto side.
Much harm and spoil he did, for none could pass
But filled his pouch, if bird, beast, fish, it was.
At length the oppressed birds, with fish, and beast,
Petition to their Sovereigns, and request
Aid and protection against the open wrong,
This tyrant daily did, and had done long.
The beasts unto the Lion made complaint.
Birds to the Eagle. Fishes did acquaint
The Seas great Emperor the Whale. with grief,
They all sustained, and all implored relief.
Long was it ere they could be heard, for still,
The Cormorant, (for so we call him will)
Had many friends in every Court, which he
Maintainde with large shares, and full liberal fee.
For still his gorge full laden, ready stood,
And when they mist elsewhere they here had food:
Food of each kind, for every stomach fit,
And such as favorites were, had part of it.
Long thus he put them off, yet at the last,
By counter-bribes, their weak petitions past.
The Eagle first did seek him, and he found,
The thief where he would wish, upon the ground,
Quoth he, well met, are you the foul that prey,
Upon our harmless subjects night and day,
That none can this way pass and use his trade,
But is a subject to your fury made?
Not I sir (quoth the Cormorant) I am one,
That live in contemplation all alone.
This poke I beg with, to sustain my need,
And I no foul am but a beast indeed.
Quoth then the Eagle, wherefore serve thy wing?
O (quoth the Cormorant) thou mighty king
Of feathered fowls, these two are my forefeet,
Held up to honor thee, with reverence meet.
And that thou may be full resolved, and know
That I unto the Lion duty owe,
As subjects to their Sovereigns, not to thee,
Without thou will usurp authority,
And into other neighbor Realms incroch
(Which to thy Justice were a foul reproach)
^strum ^aquam ergens ^rridum^ cit ^o^m, Asino more. id.
Hear but my voice. With that he steps aside,
And in the water thrusts his wezand wide,
And like an Ass began bray. The Eagle straight
Hearing his voice, suspected no deceit,
But p^^^ away to seek what now he saw.
When the late noise he made did thither draw
The kingly Lion, who did hunt about,
As the other did to find the oppressor out.
And when he spide him; What art thou quoth he
The beast against whom so many plain to me?
O noble Lion, quoth the Cormorant,
I am a fish, the water still I hant.
And here I take my food, and lead my life,
Free from oppression, and each cause of strife.
Why, quoth the Lion, now I heard thee bray
Like to an Ass. True, True, my Lord ye say,
(Quoth this smooth hypocrite) for I would feign
Be like an Ass, so innocent and plain.
I love beasts well, and next your excellence,
The humble Ass, for still his patience.
And now to put your highness out of doubt,
Behold me swim and diue, (so launcht he out
Far from the Lions reach) If beasts quoth he,
Can swim and diue thus, I a beast may be.
With that he dives, saying, Sir fare you well,
Your fair commends to the King Whale I Will tell.
The Lion parted thence; the Whale that way
Had sought this Monster all the liue-long day;
And seeing such an vn^outh thing glide past,
Within his Kingdom, with such nimble have;
He called and bad him stay, and willed him tell,
If he were Onocrotalus, that fell
And cruel murderer, who havoc made
Of all that in that wealthy Rode did trade?
O mighty Emperor (aloud he cri'de)
I hardly escaped even now his cursed pride
For being by my noble Master sent,
(The Eagle King of fowls) you to present
With birds and other iunkets in my crop,
He needs would me from your glad presence stop;
And but he heard you coming, I surmise,
His lawless force had made me lawful prize.
Quoth then the Whale, I search to meet that slave.
But what art thou that can so well behave,
Thy tail and nimble fins? Art not a fish?
That I were such (quoth he) it is my wish.
I like thy milder reign where subjects say,
For love, and not for dread, they thee obey.
And would armed in white scales, if I might choose
Serve thee a fish, and my black feathers loose.
But Nature this forbids; yet still I strive,
Even from my youth, fish-like to swim and diue:
And understand their language, and converse
With them whose civil manners, are less fierce
Then beasts or birds be. For they drink far more
And eat much less, then we do on the shore.
This drinking I delight in, and have tried,
By all good means to make my belly wide.
Yet see, I am a foul. So up he hies,
And takes his wings with speed, and far thence flies?
The Whal^ then found his cunning and straight sent
A privy letter of his close intent,
Both to the Eagle and the Lion stout,
To meet and join, and find this Outlaw out.
They met, and joined, and then this Outlaw found
Nor in the Sea, nor yet upon the ground:
Nor flying in the air, but in a hold,
A hollow tree, whose strength made braggard bold.
^in litoquies^e^s ^rum su^uper ^um eri^Et sui us acu^e con^nsul^um ^ipitris
^raemu^s^d.
They spoke him fair, but he discerned plain,
Their drift, and cride^ Fair words make Idiots feign.
They threatened him, but threats he does deride,
And says, by threatening words none ever did.
The Eagle would have ventred on his neast,
But he his bill held right upon his breast,
Like a stiff souldi^rs pike, sharp, long, and armd;
And no way but right down he could be harmd.
The Lyo^ would have torn with teeth and nails
The tree up by the root, but wanted sails
To swim so far, for it in waters stood.
The Wh^le then thought to toss it in the flood,
But in a rock it grew, and growing so,
He bad them do their worst, he feared no foe.
They said, they would besiedge and starve him out;
He laughed amain, and showed how against that doub^
He was provided, having store to serve
So long, till if they staid, they all would starve.
Then each bethought himself of many a wile
And warlike stratagem, how to beguile
This politic Rebel, and to force him yield
Or starve within, or venture to the field.
All works the air, the water, or the land
Did ere produce, these Captains understand:
B^t none found able to enforce his strength:
The warlike Ly^n yet conceived at length
How to effect it. Great confederates hear,
(Quoth he) what I propound. There Is uought I fear
But what I speak of. Once I did rebel
Against out General Sovereign Man: to tell
This fault does touch my honor, but you all,
I ^now have been copartners in my fall,
And his most gracious pardon. Then, O then
I kept within my fort, a hideous den
Carved out of rock it was; and no way he
Could force me out, or make assault on me.
At last with indignation moved, he takes
A mighty flint up, and with hurling, breaks
The same against a rock, which flying sings,
And sparkles from the air betwixt them springs
As from a red-hot iron, when a Smith
With heavy hammer beats it on a stith.
Near hand he had before laid leaves with rosse
From Oaks torn with a Northern blast, and moss
Dride in the parching Sun: and wood which did
By killing age, and stood my den beside.
The sparks inflamed this stuff, which in the mouth
Of my dark Cave he placed: the wind then South
Forced in the smoke, and this ayre-thickning smoke
Infor'd me thus, either come out or choke.
The issue you remember: this alone
Must be our project now; or Art has none.
Hie therefore braue-bird brother, quickly take
Twixt your strong tallents this great flint, and make
Experience of my plot. Mount with it hie
And let it fall, that fire may from it fly:
Which kindled once, fan gently with your wing,
And cherish with soft breath: then let the king
Of fishes with his mighty nostrels puff
Till it ^lames fiercely, and burns hot enough.
This counsel they applaud; but the Eagle thought
How purer, hotter, flames might soon be ^ought:
And up he nimbly fores the milke-white way,
Where (being a minion known) he finds no stay;
Each door ^^ies open alone, till to the ear
Of mighty love he gets, and let him hear
His business and his suite, which was for fire
And thunderbolts; love grants his full desire.
Down quickly he descends and makes a train
About the place where this thief does remain:
Then powder he applies unto the root
Of t'hollow tree, and thence the slave does shoot.
He shoots him thence into the air as hye,
As the Eagles self could follow with his eye.
And down he comes and does descend the deep,
Where the still Center does no motion keep.
Then up again above the swelling maine,
He bounds, there floting without sense or pain.
And ere he can recover laboring breath,
That Is lo^h to part, the Whal^ from vndern^ath
The traitor does attach, and straightway brings
To be arrayn'd before the other Kings.
Him they examine, but he will confess
No truth, but what they know as he does gh^sse.
Then they do rack him (being rent before)
Yet he no truth, but many a lie does rore.
Till with the violent torture and constraint,
Life almost failing, and with sufferings faint,
His gorge he vomits and bewraies with pain
The truth, for which they sought so long in vain.
And first (preposterously) he casts out,
All slimy lubricke meats, Eele, Gudgeon, Trout;
The City heirs, Gilt-head and Golden^eye,
Belonging to the Sea-kings sovereignty.
And with this evidence convict, the trial
Proceeds to prove him guilty in denial
Of farther wrongs done. The Wood-cocke, Parret,
The Goose, the Dotterell, lack^daw prone to parret,
The Sea^gull and the Cinclos weak and friendlesse,
And of poor widow- Turtles numbers endless,
With diverse subjects to the royal Eagle,
He does as easily void, as erst inueagle.
Yet still unto the Lion he denies
Himself a trespasser, but all those lies
He lately made, and late was taken in,
Afford presumption of his farther sin.
For which again they rack him one pin higher,
And then he vtters more then they desire.
A foolish Cony, and an innocent Lamb,
A credulous Cal^^ new weaned from the dam,
And yet in wardship; a ridiculous M^use
For fear of Cats leaving her sheltring house:
And last of all, (for which the Lion grieved)
A Hare, from execution often repreeued.
All these with easy utterance, does declare
That he did foul, nor beast, nor fishes spare
But preide on all, and so became a prey
To the Eagle, Whale, and Lion, every way.
Which prou'de and made by demonstration plain,
Beyond the power of impudence to feign:
He then excepts against th'vndue proceeding,
They in his apprehension used, not heeding
The law of Nations, but by force constraining
(Himself) an others subject, remaining
In peace, and league with them, to be arrayn'd
Like to a Traitor, and with tortures payn'd.
He says the place he kept in was without
Their jurisdiction, and he made no doubt
To prove it with large privileges blessed
A sanctuary for the poor distressed.
They slight his cauils; And the Whale demands
In whose unknown, strange government it stands
If not in one of theirs? For air, earth, sea,
And all they have (but Man and what Man's be),
Do properly belong to one of these,
Who may dispose of all, as they best please.
I pray then (quoth the Corm^rant) relate
To whose Imperial crown, and to whose state,
My enuy'd neast belongs? which of you three
Claim the interest as Lord by right of fee?
For if it proper be to one, the rest
Have done much wrong, t'vsurp his interest
Whose it should be. This question he did make
Hoping thereby their settled loves to shake
^y covetous ambition, whilst they all
^ould make their claims, and so asunder fall.
^ut the foreseeing Eagle bids him mind
^is own affairs, and not to think t'vnwinde
^he snares true Justice lays about his life,
^ut interposing such slight cause of strife
^etwixt such firm friends, in strong league combinde
And with all strength of intercourse entwinde.
And yet to satisfy this curious doubt,
Know (quoth the Eagle) that being hemmed about
With floting waters, it belongs to him
Who gouerns all that in the waters swim.
But as it on the steadfast earth does stand,
It longs to him that is the king of land.
And the large tree which spreads his spacious bows
In the open air, within my kingdom grows.
Thy neast thus longs to all of us, thy food
Stolen from our subjects, in the air, earth, flood:
And thou thy self must needs, if thou be either
Beast, bird, or fish, be one of ours; if neither,
Say what thou art, or whose thou art; for all
But Man and Monsters in this number fall.
Then (quoth the Cormorant) I do belong
Unto the fearful Dragon, whose black tongue
Threats death to each of you, and keeps in awe Draco maximus est cunctorum
serpentium a spelnuci^ abstractu^ sertur in aerem.

Your humbler spirits, making his will your law,
He is the king of serpents, whose strong breath
Confounds your strength with all-subduing death.
He rules the upper region, purging fire
Which searches hell, and does to heaven aspire.
This, this alone it was which I obay'd
When that strong law unto my neast you laid.
Excitatur propter ^um aer, and mare contra eius ventu^ contumescet. Isid. lib.
12. Solum habet venenum in lingua and in fell. Plin.^
But you that sprightly power by int^usion
Falsely usurped to my devout confusion.
Fire only to the Dragon does belong;
To him, and unto me, you have done wrong.
To him I do appeal; and have resort
In this great cause to his infallible Court.
This speech inflamed their hearts with heat and scorn
To be confronted thus, thus ouerborne
By a base villain who did proudly brag on
The free protection of their foe the Dragon.
So with a full resolve, they all agree
Each for himself and his reueng to be.
The Lion takes, feet, head and throat away:
With those he walked and like an Ass^ did bray.
The Eagle seaseth on his wings and tail,
With these he bird-like in the air did sail.
The Whale his body swallows at a bit
Which he vs'de fish-like, diu'd and swam with it.
Thus Traytor-like he is quartered out and carved;
Would land and water Pirates were so s^ru'd.
Epimythium.
The water Pyrat every one does know
They rob our Merchants, and allegiance owe
To no command; duty to none will give,
But out-lawes, like the sea wherein they live.
Our Pirates on the land have sundry kinds,
And sundry objects. Our goods, bodies, minds.
Law-state-Church Pirates, when no Church, state, law,
Can their irregular lives to fashion draw.
The first pretending government of all,
And freeing such as into danger fall;
Do kill in curing, and oppress with easing
Both the delinquent, and the free displeasing.
The second guard our land from foreign force,
Whilst they themselves (perhaps) afflict us worse.
Strangers may not devour us, yet we are
By peace eat up, more then we wont by war.
The third are of two kinds; our own and others,
Who not in doctrine, but in fact are brothers.
Our own feed few (for the dumb dog still lurches)
They Will not teach one, but swallow many Churches:
They unto ignorance our souls betray;
And to seducing devils give silent way.
The other knows, no king, but knows their subjects,
And faines to reconcile, but make them abiects.
No place is priuileg'd, no law, no Nation:
For all the world his parish is and station.
Rome gives him license, and although he swim
In the whole sea, there is no room for him.
He cries where s'ere he comes; All Is mine, give room;
And if it be oppos'de a fatal doom
Becomes his usher. Kings must kiss his foot,
If curses, pistolls, poison, hell can do it;
But if nor these, nor hell, then Faux more skillful
Will charm the open earth, blow up the wilful.
These Cormorants my bleare-eyde Muse has spide:
But there are many Cormorauts beside.
If any man seek a true body for this shadow, let him read Commines his fourth
book; where he shall see Lewis of Luxe^b^rgh Earl of S. Paul and Constable
of France, playing the right part of Onocrotalus with Le^is the XI. King of
France (shadowed by the Eagle^ because he ouer-sored the other Princes in
wisdom and policy, and because that kingdom has been honored with ^he
Imperial crown and arms) As also with the King of England Ed^ard the fourth
shadowed by the Lion (both in regard the Lion is part of the Arms of England,
and for that the said King was a most valiant Prince, having been personally
present in nine set battles, and remaining Conqueror in all. And lastly with
Charles Duke of Burgu^die, shadowed by the Whale (both in regard he was strong
by Sea, as also for that he was terrible and cumbersom to all his neighbor
Princes) If any seek farther they seek without me, and must be their own
guides.

The ASS.
DEDICATED. TO THE LEARNED and judicious KNIGHT Sr. HAMOND LE-STRANGE. Pol.
Virg. lib. 1 c. 19. de invent. rer*

Some beasts are ^minous some birds are so,
But Massolanus and ^our self say no.
He slew the Augurs bird^ My ^illy Ass.
May ^o a wiseman without peril pass.

ALthough in ^taly, in France, and Spain, Asinus est^ animal maxim^ frigoris^
impatiens. Plin. lib. 8. cap. 4^

And all those hotter Regions, there remain
Great store of Asses? and with us but few,
Save some that our late Travelers do show.
And though the Pope and Roman Clergy ride
In every lowly, patient, humble pride
Upon these beasts, or on their bastards rather,
As fits each single, simple, holy father.
I would not have you think my meaning such
A beast of theirs or of our own to touch.
The Ass I talk of, bred in Thess^ly
Came to a country man, a neighbor by
And made great moan, that every savage beast
In woods and fields, the greatest and the least
Misus de him, wronged him, made it all their sport
To trouble him, who had no remedy for it.
The Man seemde pit^ifull, enclind to good,
And gave the Ass advice to leave the wood,
To dwell with him who able was and strong,
His weak Retainers to protect from wrong.
True (quoth the Ass) your wit, your strength I know,
But how can I deserve the grace and show?
What benefit or pleasure whilst I live
Can I do you, who must my liuelyhoood give?
Quoth Man, for my protection, and my meat
You shall affoard me but your dung and sweat,
Those excrements t'inrich and lust my ground,
That it with corn and vintage may abound.
And when I chance to travel far and nigh,
You like a friend, shall bear me company.
The Ass was glad the cou^nants were so good,
And straight agrees, nor long consulting stood.
The articles were drawne^ read openly,
Sealed and delivered interchangable.
And homethey go, and long together dwelt
Without repentance; neither greeuance felt.
But man in innocence remained not long,
And since is apt to do all innocence wrong.
Sure here it fell out so. The crafty Man
Woe say and unsay, lie, and cavil can,
Went to the Ass, and (all enraged) demands?
Why all that while he had not dung'd his lands?
Sir (quoth the Ass) such compass as I yield
I have with daiely care laid in your field.
True (quoth the Man) but that will not suffice
To dung my ground, that plenty may arise;
Yet so you undertook. Then out of hand
See you provide enough to serve my land.
And yield what you keep back good store of sweat Tria^ ver^ cum sint^ opus,
cibus. and cast^gatio. etc. Arist. O^conomi^ lib. cap. ^.

Or I Will give store of blows, but not of meat.
The Ass finds he is wronged, but sees not how
To right himself; weak men to stronger bow.
He does what man commands, and rather more
Till Man grows rich, and so grows proud, with store.
Then man must travail, must his kinsfolk see
And other countries how they fashioned be.
The Ass must go with him, so 'twas agreed
To bear him company. Well mote they speed,
The Man a saddle sets upon his back,
A hal^er on his head, which wit does lack.
What mean you master (quoth the simple Ass)
These will but make me weary as I pass?
Fool (quoth the Man) think you i will have my Page^
Not suited to the fashions of this age?
I should be shamed to s^e you near me stand,
Without a cloak, and bout your neck a band.
Proud was the silly Ass, to hear he stood
So high in favor, and does onward skud
With willing pace, not like a sleepy snaile,
But tossing of his ears, winching his tail.
Long trauailde they, till to a brook they came,
Wherein a many silver fishes swam.
A bridge was n^^re, but Man withheld his eye,
And would not see the bridge, some reason why.
The Ass went through the water: quoth he then,
All beasts are far more happier than all Men.
You are by nature safely clothed, and armde,
Against cold, heat, drought, and wet; we easly harmde
With any small annoyance. You are free,
And against all these extremes must patient be.
The Ass being praised, upon no ground stood still,
But must turn back again to show his skill,
To boast his valor, let his Master know
All his good parts, and s^ruices arow.
Now sir, quoth he, you on my back I Will bear,
Safe over this water^ G^t up, nothing fear^.
The Man leapt lightly up. Dissimulation
"Does neither stirrup n^^d, nor great persuasion.
The Ass does quickly pass the Ri^er. Then
He stays, and prays him light. No, (s^ith the Man)
Proceed upon your journey you can bear,
I dare not light, to fall I stand in fear^.
I Will kneel then (quoth the Ass) and down he kneels,
The Man straight raisde him with his whip and heels.
O Master (quoth the Ass^^ you promisde meat,
You^ cou^nant gives no liberty to b^at.
^oole (quoth the Man) the word expressly meant,
Wages for work impli^s a punishm^nt
For sluggishnesse and sloth; make haste away,
Our busin^sse and the time permits no stay.
So on they go, till the Ass now almost tired,
Asked pity of the Man, and ease desired,
That the would daigne a little while to light.
The Man denide it, and then laughed outright.
And doubled blows with whip, with heel, and staff. Verbera^s^ absque ira
peior, est verbera^^e cum ^ra^ Com. in Arist^ 1. 6. Metaph.

O tyrant (quoth the Ass) do fight and laugh?
Are these the effects of promises and words?
Is this the peace your law, bond, faith, affords?
Keep you your covenants thus? O man think how
You make us traitors, when you, break your vow.
Why (quoth the Man) my covenants are unbroke,
I have performde whatsere I wrote or spoke.
I give you meat, my meaning likewise was,
To give you blows, if that you plaide the Ass.
I was to have your ex^rem^nts and sweat.
I cannot have those but by work and heat,
Therefore I ride you. You were to attend
In all my iourneyes on me like a friend.
And what is liker to a friend I pray,
Then a man's drudge, that toils both night and day?
That carries him through thick and thin with pain,
And a sure stud for all turns does remaine^
O (quoth the Ass^) the world was never good,
Since other on mental reservation stood.
I only was to bear you company,
True (quoth the Man) to bear, that is carry me.
O damned equivocation, who at first,
(quoth the poor Ass) this double Doctrine nursed?
No Merchant, Tradesman, Lawyer, nor Divine,
Though much from truth they warp, from grace decline,
Could be the a^thors of this ample evil,
But truths professed foe, that i^gling devil. You be ^s Gods knowing good ^u
evil.

That Devil who taught it first, and practiced too,
In paridise, unto our general woe.
That Devil which does renew in every age,
By this alone his kingdom and image.
For without this his kingdom would decay,
And without this his image wear away.
This only murders truth, opposes faith,
Deceiving, whether true or false it says.
If true we dare not trust it fearing ill.
If false, like truth it looks, and tempts us will.
Quoth Man, thou preachest well; and well might pass
Could thou speak Latin too, to say a Mass.
Thy folly was in fault rashly to draw,
Thy articles without advice at law.
that is a comnon cas^.
There wanted stops, pricks, letters, here and there,
And by your leave some words the truth to clear.
Nay quoth the Ass, had every word, stop, letter,
Been left unwritten my estate were better.
This is the plague, when power expounds laws
Not as the truth requires, but as the cause.
When every letter may an error breed,
To help the rich, and beggar such as need.
When tyrants do capitulate and treat
Not to conclude, but to deceive and cheat.
When your false minds are candi'de ore with words
As your gay sheathes conceal your bloody swords.
Now (quoth the Man) I think that Balaams Ass,
Or golden Apuly's, thy Tutor was.
Thou art so eloquent, so learned, witty,
As if thou had been taught in Athens City.
In Athens? (quoth the Ass) now I epsy,
You speak no truth, but when ye think to lie.
I was a Cockny once, of noble blood,
Traind up in Athens Court, and in the flood
of pleasure, bathde my youth, (but not in Art,)
Which causde this transformation, tears, and smart.
Yet went our Master, and was well allowde^
(With many of my kin) in that thick crowde,
When Philip did so learnedly dispute,
And made Demost ^enes with wonder mute.
I was in favor then, and then did pass,
For brave and wise, though now I be an Ass.
For no Man ought to judge by form, or face,
By favor, or employment, or by place,
Which are the wise and foolish. Dunces often
^Passe by great doctors. Baboones leap aloft.
And they may prove like me, (li^e to be switcht,)
If they my fortune meet, to be bewitched.
How I bewitched was, you now shall hear.
There is no true accomplished Caualere,
That has not trauailde. And the'rs few of these,
Which escape bewitching, passing over Seas.
When I first trauail'd, my brave Spirit did move,
T'attempt great Ladies and to purchase love.
I purcha'st love so long, till all I had,
Was purcha'st from me, and my self full glad,
To leave both Court and City, and to try,
A better Country fortune to epsy.
With much much toil, and many courtly shifts,
At length I did arrive among craggy clifts,
And barraine rocks, t'a smoaky house which stood
Alone, besides a fearful desert wood.
There with a withered witch I long time staid,
A Bel-dame that had been Mede^es maid.
She turned me to an Ass that very day,
The Odcombian wit, did odly escape away,
He may his good shoes praise, pray for his heels,
By those he escaped. And yet I fear he feels,
His brain, was turning, if he ever pass
That way again, he will turn perfect Ass.
And so will many more as well as I,
Except they stop their ears, as they pass by.
No (quoth the Man) this is a pretty fable,
Fitting the end, so near unto the stable.
I Will now alight, we two are perfect friends,
My journey and thy tale together ends.
So they went in to rest, but ever since,
The Man mounts on the Ass, although he wince.
There is no remedy, and he must obey,
That Is sadled, bridell'd, and bound every way.
He might have looked before he made his match:
Now it is too late, when time was past to watch.
Aquas transire and pedes in eis figere multum horret. Ari. 5. de Animal.
Yet ever since he letters hates and learning,
When there is no fault in them, but his discerning.
He shunneth water too, all that he can,
The cause which made him first a slave to Man.
Epimythium.
We must learn from hence these lessons.

1. Eccles. 8. 13.
First to beware with whom we deal: for if he be stronger either in person,
or by friends, we shall become his prey: if he be richer, hie gold will weigh
dow one silver: if he be more eloquent, his lies will be belecued before our
truths: if he be the Judge, he will give sentence according to his honor, or
at least according to his own profit. This is seen by general ^xperience,
and ^sp^cially in that man of sin, who pretends to Judge of all
controu^rsies, and expounder of all doubts; d^termin^s the darkest things to be
clear in his own b^half^; and the most clecre and pregnant proofs brought
against him, to be dark and obscure.

2. Secondly, we must beware of whom we take counsel; they may be our enemies
to morrow, that are our friends to day; we often show our euid^nces to such,
who for a larger free given by our aduers^ries, know how to betray us, and open
a gap for the overthrow of our cause.

3. Thirdly, to whom we slay for protection from wrongs, lest shunning the
Buzzard, we become a prey of the Sparhauke. Many poor men are swallowed in
this pit-fall: we make laws to tie our own wings. So much of every act is
taken as will scrue for lime-twigs to take us; the rest which should reform,
lies use less. We receive strength into a town, which being once in
possession, hold for themselves, and plague us worse the then enemies would
have done. So the Brittai^es (our fellows) called in the S^x^ns (our fathers)
and all histories are full of like examples. We^el might the last year have
looked into this glass, now it is too late. The hand which holds it, has
practiced the Falcone^s first prou^rbe in many places before. It knows how to
hold fast: and knows no other honor, but profit. But C^llis was wiser, who
would rather yield it self to the Archduke then expect profferd deliverance by
us. The French durst not let us have footing again in France, we had taught
them too well before how hardly we are entreated to let go our hold in so good
a Country. Let this then teach us to beware.

4. Fourthly, let us take heed to whom we give And what we give. A talent is
too much for a Cynicke to receive; a groat too little for a King to give:
discretion must guide liberality. Many bounties have miscarried, and been lost,
undoing both the giver and receiver, whilst they were not proportioned
according to the worth and respect of both parties. Our age may look in this
glass. Who gives some the first penny, gives him earnest money to beg still,
encouraging rather then releeuing. Give such the whip. We often give presents
to our betters, and they expect the custom still: power demands that of duty,
which was first granted by way of bencuolence.

Lastly let us beware what we receive from others and what we put on. It may be
a saddle, which we think an ornament, and a bridle which we think a Ca^den.

grace. Diverse foreign ouertures show this, and at home the inu^stitures of
Ireland, made by the Pope to Henry the second whereby that Sea challenges
right in Ireland. All other titles and prerogatiues^which come from thence, are
of this nature; and were sent to this end, to be witnesses of their interest.
Doubtless the Devil pretends thus to be author of our G^^. ^. 5.
knowledge; and says but for him we had never known good and evil asunder. Our
laws and privileges written in the Norm^n^ tongue are evidences to prove our
subjection to William of Norm^ndy; as the universal speech of the Latin proved
the worlds slavery to Rome, though none were thought free men, and brave
fellows, but such slaves as spoke that tongue; the rest Barbari^^s. Merchants
will trust us to draw us into their book es; they bridle and saddle us with gay
clothes, (like foot-clothes to Asses;) then they girt us up sure, and mount our
backs, whilst we can walk free in no ground, not in the streets. Our stable
is the Counter, where we are mad^ right Asses: Hither many Courtly Gallants
make have to come, and to stand at livery in the HOLE.

CVRIALE.
DEDICATED TO the good acceptance of Master FLYODE, Admiral to the Queens
Majesty, and of her Counsel.
The Court from Flies and fleas you cannot free,
Whilst such sweet meats, good fires, soft beds there be:
Yet guard your eyes and ears well, for we know,
Princes both hear and see by such as you.

THe Fly and Flea having in Court got place,
Saw all such Courtiers as were chi^fe in grace.
Still present with the King: how in his ear
For being busy, some rewarded were:
Others they saw get wealth with standing nie:
But none did thrive that were not in his Eye.
They thought since these alone grew rich and brave,
They would as nimbly too themselves behave.
that they were black could be no hindrance thought,
^or many black gowns their pre^erment sought.
^ut their ambition reached t'ingrosse all grace,
and shoulder others from so wished a place^
and thus resolved, the Flea leapes up alo^t,
and in the Kings ear falls with footing soft.
^he foolish Fly did mount with speedy wing
^etwixt the Eyelids of the amazed King;
^ho with his nimble hand did apprehend

Quoth he, Ye saucy Traitors, Dare ye thus
^resume our presence never called by us?
Or being come, Is there no other place
^n all our Court to please you, but our face?
And in our face no room can you epsy,
^ut our reserved ^are? our tender eye?
^n all my kingdoms you might freely range,
And varied pleasures every minute change
Without my perturbation: only here
Your boldness you shall both with life buy dear.
And though the Eagle takes no Fleaes nor Flies
Yet for pre^umption both by the Eagle dies.

high, nor presume too far^e. All persons are not ^it for all places: fools
mistake, and ouer-doe; wise^en warm themselves at the fire, where children
^urne their fingers: many seeking to be in grace, disgrace themselves. None was
thought fitter to be Emperor then Galba, till being made Emperor he proved
himself unfit. Or age has seen many of these Babels, whose ruins seem
greater far of^ then at hand. In a dark night each Mete^r, each I gnis
fatuus seems a Sun; but the day, coming near the Sun, they cannot be
seen. There be many ofthese, who if they had not attained preferment, would
have thought themselves wronged, and the world would have thought them
unfortunate; as if envy had crossed honor from beholding them with equiualence:
when now having attained what their ambitions desire, they see their own
insufficiencies, and the world judging them unworthy of such eminence, say they
serve for nothing but to keep out better Men. Their high flight rather helped
by the winds strength, (by favor and grace) then by their own wings (virtue
and true worth,) serves only to show the world its own blindness, and their
weakness; for being aloft in the top and pride of their pitch, they make many
plains, and dare not come freely at all occasions; but they soon stoop to the
lure of the dead quarry, having good stomachs, but bad hearts; what they
speak, what they do, as not out of their own strength and sufficiency, but
from others direction. They are french soldiers and Statesmen; their horses,
their servants must be Knighted, for these did the service; It was not the
Rider, his care was only to keep the saddle warm and to sit sure.

Again, it tells Superiors that the poorest and Exodus 8^ 17

SOLARIVM.
DEDICATED. To the absolute and open enemies of Ignorance and Darkness, and
the true Lovers and Followers of Light and Knowledge, Sr. John Crofts and his
happy LADY.
THe Clock that chim'de your praise, went right for still
The Dial ruled his tongue the Sun his Will.
And as these led him right, you follow may,
To heavenly glory, through the Milk-white-way.

IN some part of the World, I know not where,
But sure S^. Thomas Mard^uile was there.
Betwixt a Clock and a Sunne-dyall fell
A difference which I with sorrow tell.
With sorrow, for this error calls to mind
The uncertainty, which we in Story find;
Where computations cross, and make us doubt Cambden in his Brit. Alluding to
the ages of the church. 1. The Prin^^tiue, by ^^ason of ou^ward^ persecution,
being obscure. 2. The second under the Spiritu^ll persecution of Antichrist,
being fabulous. 3. The third being our Age, where Controversies are tried by
the clear Sunshine of Gods Word, and so certain and Histo^icall. Pol. Virg.
Rer. ^nuen. Cap. 14. lib. 1.

Of what we all seek, cannot one find out.
How to agree, and reconcile the obscure,
The fabulous, and c^rtain^ Age of our.
The Age obscure; is that before the Flood:
The Fabulous, on fained Wonders stood
The race of gods, on gold^n Legends told,
Where for sad truths, mad ^ictions were enrold.
This latter Age more plain and clear, we call
The certain Age, or the Age Historical.
Yet hours, and day^s, and years have sure been lost
In some of these, which our accounts have crossed.
And so they easily might, when from the Sun
To lying Clocks for our accounts we run.
This tale makes all apparent, or at least,
Makes probable, what some have thought a jest.
Within a Churchyard once a Dyall stood
Upon a square hewne Marble, which the Flood
In vain with envious waves had often sought
To spoil, when it the whole world under brought.
But Seth's wise sons had fastened it so sure,
It could all stormes^ and stre^^e of times endure.
And thereon they had carved the Art, and lore
They learned of their Grandsire long before^
Upon a Church or steeples side near hand
A goodly Clock of curious work did stand;
Which over paysde with lead or out of frame,
Did time miscall, and every hour misname.
The Dyall hearing this, aloud began cry
Kind neighbor Clock your glib tongue tells a lie.
Reform your error, for my Gnomon ^aith
You gad too fast, and miss an hours faith.
Fool (quoth the Clock) reform thy self by me,
The fault may rather in thy Gnomon be.
Had thou told ever truth, to what end then
Was I plac'de here, by the art of cunning Men?
The weather-Cocke upon the steeple standing
And with his sharp eye all about commanding,
Heard their contention, wil'd them to appeal

To him the Chief of all that Commonweal.
Told them that he was set to Ouersee
And to appease, to guide and to agree
All difference in that place; and whatso'ere
He sets down from Justice cannot err.
For from the wind he information takes
Which searches through the world, and swiftly make^
A true suruay of every proof and cause,
And does of Reason know the ground, and laws.
He bids them boldly speak, and bring their pleas,
And he will define the infallible truth with ease.
The Dial then begins. The globe-like world
From Center to Circumf rence being whorl'd
In neuer-resting motion, makes ^ime
In sundry reuolutions fall and clime.
This Time the measure of all mutable things
Comes with lead-heeles, flies hence with fiery wings;
Sleeps with two eyes, has two eyes ever waking,
Twixt minutes, hours, days, nights, distinction making
And though the difference and degrees of change,
In several years, be wonderful and strange;
Some by the Moon, some reckoning by the Sun,
And some the great year, when the heavens having ru^
Their complete course, do to that point arrive
Whence the first mouer, them did motion give;
Yet the most general certain count of all Vigila^ tempus cum dormire

volat, consistit. Vince Chartarius. Sunt anno^um diuersa genera. 1. Annus

Is measured by the Sun, whose rise and fall
Makes day, and night, and noone, and midnight too,
Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumn, and the two
Solsticiums, Equinoctials, and the hours
Now naked, and then decked in gaudy flowers.
This Adam to his Grandsons having told,
With other Arts, and wonders manifold,
How all the world both fire and flood should try;
They placed me here, to tell posterity
Such hidden mysteries; And to direct
The wiser Souls deep-diuing intellect.
About me they have grau'd seven liberal Arts,
The Sciences, with their diuiner parts,
A circle and a Gnomon set above
With Characters; which as the Sun does move
In his ascent, or low declension, tells
The certain hour, degree, and all things else.
But for my speech was slow, and cause the Sun
Did often under clouds for pleasure run,
Succeeding ages did this C^ocke out find
To Attend on me, and to declare my mind,
From me intelligence and rules to gather Persecutions are l^ke clouds and
storms, which benight the Gospel^ The Morning is deliueranc^ from e^^o^.

To measure night, close storms, and cloudy weather:
And in the Morn, finding his reckoning wrong,
By my straight rule, to tune and set his song.
But this forgetful Clock at random strikes,
Not as I bid, but fondly what it likes:
Robs short-liu'de Man of his most precious time,
And orderlesse, does others orders chime.
It will not follow me, but wanting wit,
Would have the Sun and Me to wait on it.
and darkness by the Gospel; which obtaines free passage, and cleares and
reformes the abuses of superstitious times.
This matter so apparent, though I might
Wild Weather-Cocke, except against your right
To judge, and think you partial at the least,
Since you o're-cloude me when the Sun comes West,
And will take part with it, that is in the name,
In nature, and in sight, almost the same
With you; yet know I'l^ not refuse
Thy censure, but high place with honor use.
Thus did the Dyal end, and then the Clock
Low-louting to the powder Weather- Cock,
Began his pl^a. Thou mighty Sovereign
Which do the vniuer^all judge remain
In all those places, where thy pearcing eye
Can see, or my shrill voice be he^rd to cry.
Behold this impudent, poor, negl^ct^d post
How it against me, and against thy sta^^ does bost
Embasingthy great wo^th, n^gl^cting mine;
As if the glorious Sun did n^uer shine,
Nor his sweet influence on us let fall,
But that the Dial had ingrost up all.
When all the world knows thou were placed there
The sleepy Hind^ up to his work to rear,
Pausanias ^cribit Grae cos gallu^^ generatos e^^e, vt Apollini sacrum; Is enim
ca^tu mane ^olis aduentum anuncia^ Vin. Cha^^.
To call the Scholar to his book, and wake
The The^^e which at thy shrill voice gins to shake.
Thou art the cheerful days Ambassador,
In whose praise once these lines composed were.
A crowned King, a complete Knight,
An armed Captain, fit to fight,
A plumed Courtier, fairly clad,
A lover that was never sad,
A Trumpetter^ the house wifes Mate,
Who rises early, sleeps late,
A Querister, the poor man's Clock,
All this is our great Weather-Cocke.
This sacred Antheme all the world does sing^
To thee the Suns bird, ^ho does tidings bring,
O^ his approach and rising: as for me
I here was seated, next thee in degree
To give thee ease, to tell the wondering people
What thou discouer'st from that lo^tie steeple,
The whilst thou keep'st thy voice from ^ub^les,
And art for silence honored with large fees.
The Dial is my ward, first placed there
That Common Persons who presume not near
Thy hallowed thron^, may have intelligence
And learn from me the close and hidden sense
Of all those Characters, and not expound
As list themselves, dark riddles, so profound:
Nor contradict, nor yet correct by force,
According to the Gnomon, my true course;
But the false Gnomon rather to correct
By my advice, whose way is still direct.
Who knows not, that the Sun in his round race,
Many degr^es is gone from his first place,
And like a drunkard reeling to and fro,
With giddy steps does shift his circle so;
That where he was even now, he comes no more,
His course is all confusde, behin'ds before?
Needs must the Dial then deceived be,
Which trusts a Guide that does so disagree
Within it self, and without judgment shines
Alike on all, making of fools Divines.
And teaching Fishermen to see as far,
As learned Shepherds, without other star.
Too common in this Guide, to guide aright;
Or if he could, where is the Guide for night?
I then am present still at every need
Poor erring man, in ignorant night to lead.
Then why should this bold Dial, dare to speak
Against my greatness, or the orders break
Of custom and consent? since all make choice
To feed, fast, pray, or play, led by my voice?
And that all bargains made, all wagers laid,
Not by the Dial but the Clock are paid?
Which truth, whilst all the world dare never doubt,
This Dial seems to question, and (grown stout)
Exc^pts against thy judgment too, that thus
He might be free and seem to govern us.
But since our causes are so near of kin,
Let that respect some grace and favor win
With thy high holiness, that thou may see
To give just sentence for your self and me.
The weather-Cocke thrice turned himself about,
As taking care to mind the matter out;
And thrice returned, as if he were as free
From prejudice, as from integrity.
Then thrice he claps his wings (which courage shows)
And thrice aloude his senseless sentence crows.
To give a reason, wherefore, how, and what,
When, where, by whom, or fondly this or that,
Might argue reference to higher power;
But what is he whose place does equal our?
We are the rule of reason, truths clear law.
Hear then with reverence, and obey with awe.
Without more question, argument, or trial,
The judgment I pronounce against the Dial.
The Dial shall be guided by the Clock^
This is the sentence of the weather- Cock.
Which when the Cl^ck had heard (puftvp withp^ide)
He ginnes the wronged Dial to deride;
And sits his tongue at large, too much, too soon;
Twelu times he fetched his breath, and laughed out none.
The Dial then with indignation moved
By this inuectiue speech their fault reproved.
Poor silly Clock (quoth he) rejoice thy ^ill,
Time will reform thy ignorant zeal with s^ill,
Stay thy distempered course, which hurried now,
By mad-braind humor, goes it knows not how.
Time that is my pupil, shall thy Tutor be,
And teach a difference twixt thy self and me;
Then thou will know thy error, and recant
That ever thou were proud of so much want.
But as for thee (thou judge corrupt and base,
Who bindst all knowledge Prentise to thy place)
Know this, the all-seeing Sun thy folly knows,
And to each vulgar eye thy shadow shows,
That they may plainly see how poor thou at
Thy head deformed, defective every part.
And that those high prerogatines of state
You challenge proper to your self, are late
Vpstart intrusions, usurpations new;
Forged by the force or flattery of some few.
The promise which you boast, to have the wind
Blow where you list, and alte^ when you mind,
Is false, and foolish; but 'twas promisde still
To blow and guide you right, if that you will.
And so it does, so it does others too,
If they consent, not whether they will or no.
For when they would the point and quarter know
Where it does breath, on me they look; I show
The truth to them and thee, if you look right,
If not, you are misled by your own sight.
But how can thou others from error keep
When as thy self foulded in error deep,
Shun'st reformation, and wilt neither mind,
My grave directions, nor the powerful wind?
I can remember, long before thou Were
When wise Alcedo stood where as thou art.
He calmed all storms, and pacified the wind
To patient sufferance, bent his humble mind.
He to the fisher, and the Seaman gave
Directions, how their storme-tost bark to save.
When by the Lee-shore, when to lanch the Maine,
And when to lie at Hull, when to remain
In harbor Anchor-fast, and when to sail
With a full wind, and when again to veil:
How, where and when, to cast their nets, and lay
Their hidden hooks, where all the skull do play.
Some of each kind, yet at each corner stand,
Who still love truth; in spite of thy command:
Their heads look south, because the wind blows there,
Thy tail stands south, thy head the wind does feare^
Ill might he fare that in Alcedos place,
Set thee, who springest from a bloody rac^.
His error, and thy pedigree behold
As it in ancient story is inrould.

Luke 22. (...).
But whilst he slept; a chickin of that Cock
Which Cephas checked when he denyde the rock,
And forced him to repent, to sigh, and weep,
Did with his voice the murderer wake from sleep,
And would not suffer him to rest in sin,
But he would rouse his conscience still within^
This Murderer, a Cock of kind did get,
And him to kill this kinder Cock did set,
Who soon performed the task he took in hand:
For Chauntecleer would ^uffer, not withstand.
He watchful was and tended his vocation,
To stir up others to their occupation:
He loved the pearl more then the barley corn;
To crow, and not to quarrel he was borne.
So he was slam^, and slain by one of those
From whence thy proud succession strangely rose
Who hight Alectrion, and while-ere had bin
The Pandor unto Mars and Venus sin, Luc^an.

And then (being Captain of great Mars his guard),
Stood Sentinel, and kept both watch and ward,
For fear that Phoebus all discovering eye,
Should them unawares at their stolen pleasure spy.
But ouert'ane with sleep, he did not wake
Till Vulcans net did both the lechers take;
For which the angry God (inrag^d and mad)
His sleeping soldier, all in feathers clad,
His sword turned spurr^s, himself a Cock of kind,
His arms and body changde, but not his mind;
That Is bloody still, and too far prone to sight
Without respect of persons, cause, or right.
Els^ would he never have been so mad to kill,

But him he falsely slew, and having ^^aine
Did for this murder, of a murderer gain
Too great preferment, to be set up here
In t iumph t'ouersee all, far and near;
To be ador'de with universal praise
And triple crowned with Olive, Oak, and Bays.
Him thou succeed'st both in thy mind and place,
An armed Champion, of that iron race,
A Soldier, none of his whose badge thou bear;
But rather one of his whose crown thou wear'st;

To prey, and not to prayer fit t'exhort.
Thou will not crow to ro^se the world from sleep,
But with thy silent charms, it drunken keep.

Up to the hilts; and furiously bestur
Thy ready parts, t'attaine thy bloody end,
And all the world to thy own scope to bend.
Thou trumpet'st wars and curses over all,

Our Lion scorns thee, when he hears thee crow;
And with his ^oaring voice the world does show,
How poor thou art, how cowardly, how weak,
Who shak'st and tre^blest when thou hear'st him speak.
And yet how proud art thou, t'vsurpe a place
Of judgment over me, in this dark case,
And to prefer the Clock for want of wit,
When I should be the judge of thee and it?
The Sexton comes, he will mend all this anon.
With that the angry Clock in rage struck one.
The Sexton came indeed, and one did tell,
Looked on the Dial, saw all was not well.
For that said twelve, the Clock said one and past.
He took the weights off, which caus^d too much have,
Suruaide the wheels, for there the fault might be,
And found some cog supply the place of three.
Some whe^les were taken off, and borne to Court,
To trundle up and down, and there make sport.
And some with dust, and rust, were duld and foild,
And some stood vselesse, so the Clock was spoild.
Which to reform, he mends the wheels forthwit^
Files, oils, and beats them thoroughly on a stith:
Makes weights and wyere fit, then by the Sun
Sets the new course, which it does truly run.
Then going up the steeples top he spies
The weather-cocke how palpably it lies.
For at each Corner the Kings-fishers stood,
Full South; and that the Dial proved good.
But the fond Weather-cocke (being w^ather-wise)
From the Calm blast turned his scornful eyes.
The Sexton took him down, and straight did see
An easy way how he might mended be,
His head was too too great, with 3. combs crownde
Which ever when the wind blew turned him round.
His tail was too too weak, when every feather
Was bent with storms, and broken with the weather
The Sexton cut his crowns, and gave more sail
With them and with the spurs unto his tail
So humbled now in habit, look and mind,
He waits with due obedience on the wind:
Knows his high place was not to rule, but serve,
And means no more from this strict course to swerue^

This tale no mortal needs, it is not dark,
But points a work fit for our learned Clarke
Who by the Dyal may reform the Clock,
And by kings fishers turn the Weather-cocke.
We have the wind to help us and the Sun,
And works are half accomplished when begun.
Then who will begin? who is on our side, who?
Where words, wind, writings fail, resolve to Do.
I had thought this Tale should have needed no other ^ongue then its own to
be rightly understood. But because I see it too misty for some apprehensions,
whose wills are as desirous as others to know truth, I have added this by way
of illustration to enlighten such as accept well of my good meaning, which is
to inform others according to that which I have recei^ed, and to be reformed
where I err my self.

1. First the teaching part of the militant Church, which consists of the
Clergy, I have vayled under the Cl^cke^. The wheels are the distinct degrees
and offices they en^oy of superiority, and inferioritie; wherein the Harmony
of the whole consists. The weights are the privileges, immunities,
prerogatives and donations of several kinds, bestowed upon the Church in
several ages, by good Kings, liberal professors and benefactors. The
challenge the Clock seems to make h^ere to rule the Dyal, resembles the
controversy the Church of Rome raises in the Catholic Church about the
exposition, the restrayning or publishing of the Scriptures.

2. The Dyal is the written word, which is of it self dead and unprofitable,
without farther illumination. Since none of the Philosophers, nor Solomon
himself by the me^re strength of Nature, could from thence draw saving
knowledge, without saving grace. But as the Dyal has reference to the Sun;
so has this to the Son of righteousness. Neither am I without warrant for
using this bold Allegory, since the sweet Psalm. ^16. v. 105.
Singer of Israel compares the same word to a lantern, and the spirit to a
light, when he says elegantly, and like a Divine POET, Thy word is a lantern
unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

Now as it is absurd that the Dyal should be set by the uncertain gadding of
the Clock: So is it more absurd that the Clergy should so judge of the
Scriptures, as to conclude o^ teach any thing by w^^^ pretense soever against
it, or to vouch unwritten veri^^es (as some call them) or traditions
contradictorie to the written word. But much rather as the (...) ought to be
set by the Dyal; so ought the Church to subject it self to be directed by the
Scriptures. and to prove and examine it self by the same rule whether it be
in the faith or no. And finding i^ sel^^ in the right, it ought by manifest
proofs and arg^^ents from thence to show forth the same faith (...)

3. Thirdly, the Weather-cocke who (...) himself as judge in this controversy
between the Dyal and the Clock, is that Pope of Rome, who challenges the
same prerogative iure diuino, oue^ the Church and Scriptures. How falsely he
does this, and yet how impudently, is well known to all.

For I know not what the Pope has more to do with the rule of the Catholic
Church, then the Weather-cocke (because he stands upon the top of the steeple)
has to do with the government of the Clock and Dyal. I have heard and read
the reasons upon which the contrary opinion is grounded, but for my own part
can see no strength in them able to turn any but Weather-cock^. The prioritie
of place, the whole Church perhaps would be content to yield him for the
general peace, and to express the true humility of holy Pastors, who follow
the example and doctrine of their master Christ. But for him (that turns and
returns as uncertainly with every blast of humor or occasion, as any
Weathercocke at ^e change of the wind) to challenge not only the ^mmunitie
from errors, and the infallibility of iudge^ent, but also to be Christ's Vicar
General upon earth, (...) Peter's Successor, the Apostolical Prince, and
Universal Bishop of the whole Church, to have all power in Heaven and on
Earth, and all jurisdiction both temporal and spiritual, impropriated to his
Cha^re, and ^nnexed to his place, this seems strange; and they ^ustly deny it
him, who are not giddy with standing ^oo near him, or troubled with the same
vertigo, by ^eason of the height of place, from whence they look upon the rest
of the poor afflicted and distressed ^ocke of Christ Jesus. But for this proud
challenge ^hey know truly how to style him the great Antichrist, and crown him
with this triple Crown; the Man of sin, the Whore of Babylon, the Vicar
General of HELL.

Who with false reasons nurse thy civil war.
The two (two Worthies, nobly borne and bred;
Enriched with virtue, and upon the head
Of Court and Kingdom plac^d, (as Jewels worn
For use and ornament) now rent and torn,
Remain sad spectacles; and cry aloud
O Man, why, being mortal, art thou proud?
Why art thou proud of beauty? Roses blast;
Or of thy wealth? the mines of India waste;
Or of thy strength? since sickness, age, or wounds
Let loose the stiff-strung joints, and spirit confounds.
Or of thy honor, and thy high-borne blood?
Since to be great is not worth praise, but good:
Or of all these? since all these, and much more
Wh^rton and Steward had, lost, and di'd poor.
Much more they had; so much, that hard it is
To tell what either wanted. Earths chief bliss,
(Their Princes favor) like the Sun above
In his hot Solstice stood, and did improve
Their blooming youth's with ripened fruit, before
Their thoughts could hope: o what could they wish more?
Friends sought the^, fortune blessed the^; blessed them so,
That which might happiest seem was hard to know,
Neither had cause of Envy; except thus,
As th'eies^ hands, feet, which guide, guard, carry us;
Whose self like shape, and equal use admits
No war, but fellow-feeling of such fits,
Griefs, and diseases, and each part sustaines;
So shared they in all pleasures, toils, sports, pains.
Nor had these other cause of war at all,
"And causeless war is most unnatural.
Yet (oh) that subtle Spirit incensed rash blood
With frantic rage, that enery ill seemed good.
They first must pray; so undeserved gold
"Ill got, we waste, and have no power to hold^
Then they proceed to words, from words to blows;
"The way to ill is easy; but who knows
The Clue that we return by? hence proceeds
A Challenge from wronged Wharton: Steward needs
No such stale provocation: Mischiefs feet
"Are swift to blood: their quick desires soon meet,
And (met) soon fight; bold Steward falls by Fate;
Wharton by Chance: those powers each other hate.
So I have seen from the Indies East and West,
Two Ships well rigged and manned upon the breast
Of Thetis d^ncing, spreading flags abroad
For joy of their long-wisht-for English road;
Past now all dangerous Ro^ks^ Gulphs, Pirates, Sand,
Ready t'vnlade their rich fraught on firm land,
And tell the story of their perils past,
And frolic with glad friends in peace, at last.
When spying each other so bedeckt, adorned,
With outward pomp: ones pride the other scorned,
And from that envious scorn some word proceeding,
And from that word some blow, from that blow bleeding.
Then giving way to fury, all enraged,
Both are in desperate terms of fight engaged.
The fire in water, Lead in the air, their center
Do madly seek; and both these r^dely enter
The strong ships womb, and ransac^e every hold,
For precious life, neglecting Indi^n gold.
The shot seems thunder, but the dying groans
Of slaughtered souls, shrike louder, deeper tones
Then roaring Cannons, whose thick charging rout
Lets water freely in, and poures blood out.
In this hot fight both firmly do defend,
Both nimbly do assault, both madly spend,
Strength, skill, and all to hurt. Conquest inclines
To neither part as partial. Equal lines
Are drawn betwixt them both by Fate and Chance;
Till the one his topsaile fairly does advance
To win the wind, and in that vantage flies
With force and fury on his foe; who plies
All means to salve this loss, and to regaine
Fair ods, or equal standing once again.
But all in vain, fortune, the wind, and sea,
Con^ederate with the adverse seem to be.
So this to sink (rather then yield) resolves,
And half his tattered sides the Sea inuolues.
When the other (covetous) grapples with his foe,
To bourd and rob him: and (being chained so)
The s^ip that leaks sinks, and with his weight draws
The Conqueror with Conquest, to deaths jaws.
So fares it with these noble Combatants
Both equally of blood and honor vaunts:
Both enui'd and beloved alike, both friends,
Both young, both valiant, and their life and ends
So parallel, and twin-like like in all
That they obtained one grave, one ^unerall.
One grave, one funeral, they obtained, yet lost
The ^ame and honor their youth thirsted most.
Because their quarrel on false grounds begun,
Could not produce true praise, nor true blame shun.
The wounds thou gave stout Wharto^ had bin good
Against thy Kings or faiths foe; and thy blood
Heroicke Steward, had been nobly shed,
Against such slaves; so both had bravely bled.
And your brass Monuments had spoke the fame
Of Whartons noble, Stewards royal name.
Then the fierce challenger for his quick charge,
And stout assault with wounds given deep and large;
His apt command of every part soon shunning,
All wounds save one, given more by chance then cunning
And the Defendant, who so long time stood
Drowned (yet undaunted) in his own life blood;
And deadly wounded, past all hope of living,
Death in his death to his hail fooeman giving;
Had filld the largest leaves of Fames fair story,
And both worn wreath of triumph, conquest, glory^
And then like patterns ^o both Realms, set out
By virtue for example; the wise and stout
Had been your scholars, and their lessons read,
In those green fields, where both so boldly bled.
Bnt now (aye me!) as rocks, bars, sands, at sea,
Or marks set up to show ships where they be,
Or rather as some wracked ships self, whose mast
Ore-looks the waves, and yet still sticking fast
In the eating silt, bids the wise Pilot fly
The tracklesse path, where such hid dangers lie.
So stand these two, the signs of woe, and ruth,
Of shipwrackt honor, fortune, valor, youth;
And by their deaths confirm this speech for good,
"Virtue has greater privilege then blood.
"Our souls are Gods, our bodies are the Kings,
"And he that in his private quarrel brings
"Either of these in question does betray
"The Kings part, and gives Gods part clean away.
England, behold in Wharton what thou art,
And Scotland see in Steward every part
Of thy best power; shun enmity and strife,
None but your selves have power of eithers life.
Let no slight toys (the snares and trains of hell)
Breed war betwixt you two; but kindly dwell
Within this I Will as in one house, the rather
Being thereto wooed by your good King, kind father.
If not, peruse this glass, and let not me
The fatal Prophet of such ill news be
To your succeeding times; but choose you whether
You Will still live friends, or like these die together.
DVELLI FINIS:


A cast of Falcons (in their pride
At passage scouring) foul e^pide
Securely feeding from the spring,
At one both aim with nimble wing.
They first mount up about Man's sight,
Plying for life this emulou^ flight
In equal compass, and maintain
Their pitch without a lazy plain.
Then stooping freely (lightning like)
They (counter) dead each other strike.
The ^owle escapes^ and with her wings
Their funeral dirge, this lesson sings.
"Who aims at glory not aright,
"Meet^s death, but Glory takes her flight.

IVSTITIA IACOBI.
Dedicated to the grave, reverend, and judicious Knight, Sr. ROBERT GARDENER,
sometime Lord Justice of Ireland.
SO many men press now for place in State,
Deseart and Worth cannot come near the gate:
^ut happy were it for the State and Us,
^f we (as Rome did) sought for Curious.
^here should we find him, far from Court, with you
^erhaps a Gardener, or perhaps at Plow.
^et even the same which Pyrrhus did withstand,
^amnites, and Sabines ruld, as you Ireland.
^hen should our Kings clear Justice shine too brigh^
^o suffer potent wrong, cloud impotent right.
^hen should this act of Justice so above
^ll presidents, make others like it moo^e.
But wretched we, whilst few the door can pass
Of high pre^erment, but the L^den Ass.
Regalis Justitia IACOBI.
DEVS VIDET.



Man, Angel, nor the Fiend of Hell,
Can Man's heart see, search, and tell,
That God alo^e does understand,
Closing all thoughts within his hand,
He better knows then Priest, Judge, Scribe,
Who gave the last cause-carrying bribe.
He sees, when sentence goes aw^y,
Where the hidden ground does lie.
He kno^es if it be true or no,
The doubtful witness swears vnto^
He marks the Iewrie and their leader,
And observes the lying Pleader.
He notes the Council what they do,
And the Kings heart searches too.
HOw hateful is this silence? I have stood
Wishing, expecting, musing long, who would
With honest thrift, this fair advantage take
To fame himself for ever, and to make
This senseless age conceive (perhaps commend)
The good we now enjoy, not apprehend.
Time was, Kings words were like to apples, snatched
From to Hesper^des, so obs^ru'd^, so watch'de.
None ^^ffer'd to drop down; all highly prizde
Preser^ed, recorded, apothegmatizde.
But now their words (though Or^cle^ to those
Of former times, though verse unto their prose)
Are slighted by this lip-wise age of ours;
Whose rootles knowledge bears no fruits but flowers
Where is the Man whose better fate, admits
Him place, time, means, to hear the King of wits.
Discourse like Solomon, of every thing,
Begot betwixt the winter and the spring?
Determine every doubt that does arise
Twixt heaven and earth, the ^diot and the wise?
That does for private use, or public good
Make known how Sab^-like, he understood?
And did not (like the pictures) wait for show
To fill place only, but to learn to know.
This man is yet no Courtier, or at least
No daily waiter; scarce s^^ne at a feast.
Too poor and plain to travail, and bring back
The ^ongue and heart of treason; he does lack
A face t'outface his wants, and does bewr^y
His ignorance in every arrogant way.
He means good faith and speaks it, though the lip
Of censuring law, his state and body stripped
Of coin, and ears, and freedom; it is no crime,
To speak truth (he thinks) though it be out of time.
He is no chamber Traitor from hell sent,
To v^dermine the Souls high Parliament.
He cannot candy poison; wants the ways
To tickle truth to death, with her own praise.
He dares not wear a desperat^ suite t'vndoe
Himself, a Mercer, and a Tailor too:
And then make that the preface how to ask
Toward his unknown loss in the last mask.
But such as can those Court-lie Mysteries
Want time for this. Themselves are histories
Not easily learned; it will ask a perfect Man
To read them daily over, do what he can.
And ere he learns by heart each attribute
Appropriate to the body, and the suite,
Himself grows old, or a new-fashion springs:
Which shifts the Scene, the form, and face of things.
Thus silkworms spend their times, and scholars too
Have idle work enough to turn them to.
Perhaps a pair of feet and a tongue strove
Who should walk fastest, and most countries roue.
In fewest hours to smallest purpose; these
At length return (their travails finished) please
To publish their fond Iournall. But (alas!)
Neither themselves, nor their huge work can pass
Our press vnpraisde. O Courtiers thither hie,
Gallants, Wits, Poets; Let your Muses fly
Not to reform, or settle this light brain,
But render him more wild. Your selves shall gain
Much wonder by it; extolled shall be your skill,
For writing well in jest, in ^^rnest ill.
Or if not this, some other witty task
Stays your continual leisures, and does ask
Ink from your pens, t'asperge, deforme, defile,
States and their instruments, with libells vile.
No man must live without your fawning praise,
Nor no man die without your rounddelaies.
Death maks you sport, and stroks which force the State,
Stagger and reele; your humors eleuate.
"Vice living, is preferred to Virtue dead,
"The present, no time else, is honored.
If you attend on Kings, it is to observe
Their imperfections, where their frailties swerue
In rash attempts or passionate words unstaid,
From iuster rules, their intemperate bloods once laid
As if Kings were not men, weak, frail, and poor,
Like to their Subjects, and subjected more.
As if at Rome (whether you send this news)
All there were Saints, and your Popes Court no stewes^
As if that you a Patent had from Hell
All things to say or do, but nothing well.
O! if you yet retain a grain of that,
Which your high aims would seem to level at:
Or if no faith (but that you Atheists be,
And nothing but vnhallow'd Reason see)
If but a spark of that remain entire,
Which you seem to monopolize (the fire
Prometheus filch'd from lou^) let that bright flame
Kindle your zeales for self, kings, countries fame,
To use those opportunities, parts, pl^ces,
Intelligences, means, friends, fortunes, graces,
You have above other, for the public good,
That we may understand you understood.
Learn Saba- like to hear, observe, report,
The good our Solomon speaks, does at Court.
Not Shemei- like to slander, curse, deride,
Religions Nurse, Arts glory, virtues pride,
Bnt you contemn my admonition. Go
Feed ^at for hell, the place you co^et so.
And let my humble Muse, applaud, admire
And celebrate he^uens grant to our desire.
Tell what thou see and feel'st. Ingratitude
"Receives, craves swallows, a whole multitude
"Of gifts and graces, without thanks or cense,
"And with dull silence beats heavens blessings hence^
"It is D^traction to conceal due praise,
"When good related, might more goodness raise.
"It is not flattery to report truth well;
"True glasses both our faults and favors tell.
Here then receive this one work royal ^ames,
Which now reflects upon thee, and more fames
This Church and ^ingdom, then thy birth, crown, pen,
Or that else makes thee the good King of men.
I sing thy Justice, whose clear rays gives light,
To neighbor Princes in this ignorant night
Of mistie error, and corrupt Respect,
How to inform aright their intellect.
And (having here on earth, among Christian Kings
And Pagans shone) it mounts the winds swift wings
Calming the sea, bounding her ebs and tides,
And in her monthly change the moist Moon guides^
Then sores up higher, and informs the Sun,
How among the signs in an even line to run;
How to make days, and nights; and higher yet
Mounts, till it be in the first Mouer set.
Two warlike kingdoms linck't in happy peace.
When they beheld how common fewdes did ^^ase
And saw how strongly blessed that concord stands,
Where brethren join first hearts, and after hands,
Resolved that course; turned matches into Maskes,
And reuelling tissues wore for massier Caskes:
Steeds traind for ready fight, learnd now to peace,
And knew no foes but Buckes and Hares; nor race
But on smooth plains for wagers, or for sport,
Not for loved life; where Camps lay, lay the Court.
Keen swords that bit the bone, abated now
Kissed without making skars, or helped the plow
To draw long furrows on the fruitful earth,
Least Peace should (breeding teeth too fast) breed (dearth.
Blunt foiles were on sharp pointed Rapiers set,
And so Lord Sanquier and poor Turner met.
They met to play: there Sanqu^er lost an eye.
O Britain! can thou nothing further spy,
In this then his loss? Look up now and see;
Security has taken an eye from thee.
Ill did thou ward that blow; If sport hurt so,
O what will open force and malice do?
Thy King rides, hunts and falls. Are horses then
Turned traitors too? will beasts prove like to men?
Can Kings find sportfull peace so hazardous?
To arms then Caesar, shun the Senate house.
Like poison, ponyards, pistols, Death a^oue
Attends on 'Pr^nces when they feed, sleep, move;
B^neath like powder, that the ground they tread,
Seems all one continent, to quick and dead.
And is it not so with others too? behold,
This silly Fencer, in his ignorance bold
Think's his submissiue sorrow will suffice
For that unhappy thrust at Sanquiers eyes;
And begging pardon, seems to have it then.
What fool dares trust the vnseald words of men?
Yet Turner will. A reconciled foe
"Seems a true friend, to him would have him so.
He thinks (now Dunne is dead) to die in peace.
"but blood cries out for blood, and does not cease
"Till vengeance follows. Vengeance even at hand
Whaits like a treacherous Groom of Sanquiers; and
(When Turner nothing of his near death thinks,
But laughes, and plays, and to his deaths-man drinks.)
Let Us his charged pistol fly, whose mouth spits lead
With fire-wing'd speed, striking the Fencer dead.
"No ward auoides that blow: Pal^ Death we see
"A fellow-gamester in all sports will be.
The Murderers flee; Iusti^e pursues with speed,
The Abettor, Actor, Author of this deed;
Who (apprehended) apprehend too late
(If friends help not), the issue of their fate.
But friends will help. One steps unto the King,
Kneeles and thus pleads. Liege Lord, you are the spring,
From whence Nobility flows. And all our blood
The nearer yours it comes, the nearer good:
As you first gave, so let your power preserve
Those that are set a part the Crown to serue^
Others by fit election, these by fate
Are made hereditarie to the State;
Distinguished from the common rank of those
Who only know they are not, when they rose
And priuiled^ge above the rascal rout,
Whose words and deeds have reference to account.
Else why did our bold fathers, with the loss,
Of lymmes and lives, honors for us ingrosse?
O why do these new Nobles de^r^ly buy
Those attributes for which they dare not die?
Or why should land or gold^ which all things can
Be given for ^itles, if they mend not man,
And something add besides an empty sound,
To recompense the gloss of gold and ground?
If honor does naught but a name afford,
A Lordship then is bette^ then a Lord.
"Nobility this privilege does bring,
"It makes the owner something like a king;
"Exempting him from penal laws, which crack
"With heavy pressure the poor Commons back.
This (Sir) I speak t'excite your royal power
To rescue Noble Sanquir, who this hour
Is by the too-strick't vnrespectiu^ laws
Condemned to die a villa ines death. The cause
And quarrel this. The Barron chanced to play
With a rude Fencer; where both did bewray
Their best ability at Rapier foyles.
The ^encer to uphold his credit toils,
But wants skill; which makes his hate arise;
And with an envious thrust at Sanquirs eyes,
The wicked and inchant^d foil depriu^s
An eye of sight; worth many Fencers lives.
The suffering Lord forbeares to kill him then
But being after scorn'de by watermen,
Fiddlers, and such base instruments of hell
For this foul blemish, his great heart did swell.
And (full of noble courage) loath to do
So black a de^de himself he puts it to
His man's performance, who obaide too soon,
Repentan^e came before the deed was done.
The equal laws to equals does appoint
An eye should have an eye, joint answer joint.
But where suc^ ^ddes of persons be, I guess
An eye should have a life to boot, no less.
Yet not on this or that does Sanquir stand;
His death, his life, his doom is in your hand.
He does confess the foulness of his guilt:
He sorrows for the blood that he has spilt.
Your mercy (royal Sir) he does implore
For this rash act, who never begged before.
Scarce had he done, and e're the king could speak,
An other thus begins. If you should wreake
Each English peasants life with blood so hie
As noble Sanquir is, No memory
Of your fair train, of Native Scots, should stand,
To let times know the glory of that land.
Soldiers must doffe their arms, and gowns put on,
If villains so foul may pass upon
Lords vnreueng'de; or if those antique names,
Those honors, trophies, and eternal fames,
We got by killing many Englishmen,
Be for the death of one, thus lost again.
If thus to quench the fewde you pleased are,
You thereby quench the heart of lawful war.
Remember what a soldier he has bin;
How easly might forget it was a sin.
And think he did but chastise one of those
Who'gainst his Leader muteni'de, and rose.
Many of the English have been pardoned
For treasons capital. Some honored
For their knee-seruice, and no other merit.
Then (Sir) let us who lineally inherit
Allegiance, worth, and honors; sometime find
You left not all your Scottish blood behind:
Nor mean to leave us in the hands of those
Who kill with law more friends, then fewdes kill foes.
Thus ended he; And then as in a Queere
Of solemn singers, one shall ever heare^
After the Trebles has the Antheme sung,
(And their divisions with shrill utterance ^ung);
The Base, the Tenor, Counter-tenor sweet,
With Howboyes, Cornets, Trumpets, Organs meet,
And join their hye-stretcht notes, that all the ring
Seems Eccho-like, their sonnets to resing:
So did the grave and gallant troop, which stood
About the King (like a dew-dropping wood)
Convey their powers to make this consort full
And cried; Be styled King ^ames the merciful.
Or (if to satisfy the course of law,
And stop Opinions wide-gull swallowing iaw)
Life must have life, take Carlis^e, one for one,
And one to boot too; so this Lord be none.
With that (as if all aims would this advance)
Comes from the Regent and the King of France,
Letters, entreating for their Pensioners life;
And last, as if the difference of a wife
Should from this fact take characters, to know
A true good wife, from a good wife in show:
Comes his forsaken Lady all in black,
(W^ose youth from him did due benevolence lack)
Weeping, entreating, for her lost Lords sin,
And then like fullomes that run ever in
A bail of Gossips (some true beggars borne,
Pitying this Lord more then the Lord of Lorne)
Beg his remission with obstreperous voice:
But among the rest, she that made lowdest noise,
Was Turners Widow, whose shrill throat did yell,
That she was satisfied, and all was well.
The king abhord it, and his upright heart,
Beholding these assaults on every part,
Made it his glory to be only good,
And from his crown to wipe those stains of blood.
Thus he replies^ "The crown for Justice sake,
"Heaven placed upon our head; which none can shake
"Or touch, till with injustice we make way,
"And (for respect) that strict rule disobay.
"God is our Guard of proof, that we may be
"A guard to you impartial, just, and free.
"And this stands firm; If one hand goes about
"To sign a croock't line, the other blurs it out.
O magnanimity, above a Man!
O Justice more confirmed then that which wan
Zeleuchus so much fame! Corrupt with gold
States, Cour^iers, Law, or Wi^es that will be sold.
Pervert with passion every solid heart,
Move Stoickes, or melt marble with thy Art,
Justice sits still untouched, with kingly care,
Not pardoning till true mercy bids him spare.
And then not striking, though the life he gives,
Repines, and enuies that the giver lives.
Deni'de they vanish, as the clouds disperse,
When the hot-shining Sun looks red and fierce.
The law proceeds; the Actors suffer first,
A death too-good, too-bad; the best the worst.
The Author then submits him to his doom,
And dies a Catholic; That Is a man of Rome^
Romulus and Remus nur^ed by a Wolf, ^omulus ^ew his ^rother R^nus for lea^ing
over ^he walls of ^is City ^ome.
O Rome! Lives yet that Wolf which was thy Nurse
When (growing great) thou grewst the whole worlds curse?
May none yet leap thy walls, or leave thy Sea
Vnslayne, though he a King and brother be?
Retain'st thou yet that savage kind, to pray
On the distressed flock which shuns thy way?
Do all that suck thy breasts, for milk suck blood?
Dare not that spring from thee die well, do good?
Must Gibbets only rock them to their rest?
Do they desire that death? become they't best?
Must Traitors, Murderers, only be thy Saints?
Wear none white robes but such as scarlet paints?
Else why do all evil men so soon drink up
The deadly lees of thy inchaunted cup?
Or why do fools so credit what Rome says,
But for they easily learn implicit faith?
If Rome keep heavens keys, (as'tis out of doubt),
None dare bar Lambert, or Lord Sanquir out:
Nor need they fear, where Jesuits have to do,
Garnet shall be a Saint, and ^udas too:
Their writings and examples murder teach;
They Will not condemn the doctrine which they preach.
This makes our desperate Ru^^ins, Romans dye.
And our cracked Virgins seek a Nunnery.
Justice rise Lyon-like out of thy sleep,
The Western Wolves worry the ^rish sheep:
And here at home thy borders swarm with those
Who do imitate, breed, beget thee foes.

The t scar thou think to close, these make more wide,

The Grimes are banished, but worse Foxes earth
In those vast places, through the Gospels dearth.
The Hu^our that feeds these, affects the heart,

A CAPITE, VSQUE AD CALCEM



The State is cast; God does behold
Eyes blind, ears deaf, tongues dumb with cold.
Days care to get, gets nightly cares,
Which memory foyles, and judgment marrs.
The faint hearts (slowly beating) tells
Dull spirits in the slack ner^e dwells,
The Liver boyles with l^stfull blood,
Weak stomach brooks no meat that is good.
Loose palsy makes the hands to tr^mble,
When they for love shake, they dissemble.
The gowty knees do stiffly bend;
The feet walk flow to all good end.
The Doctor says; Repent, fast, pray,
Die, or this diet take we may.
GOd bends his bow but shoots not; see, it stands Alluding to the Rainbow.

As if the stiff string were in Man's own hands.
For God first placed it so, that Man might know
How prone to peace he is, to war how slow,
That covenant which he made with Noah, he keeps,
His Mercy ever wakes, his Justice sleeps.
And though our sins a second Deluge craves,
He Will drench the world no more in those salt waves.
"What hurt from heaven falls, first from the earth proceeds^
"And Man's misfortune, springs from man's misdeeds^
Misdeeds that from our selves, friends, country come,
And where they should on all, light but on some.
The snow, hail, rain, are by the Suns pure beams
Exhalde from standing Marshes, whose streams
Infect the air with foggy mists, and then
Are botteld up in clouds for sinful men.
And for Man's good, in season they distill
Or out of season, to amend the ill.
The plagues we feel fall at the head and foot,
Are shafts against God our hands first upward shoot.
Presumptuous sins in Country and at Court,
Creatnesse, and Grace, and Favor do support.
The Pulpit flatters; Justice sits and smiles,
Making a gainefull skill, of lingering wiles.
"Who has great friends lives free, and wants faults,
"But without friends the upright innocent haults.
Vice now prouides us raiment, meat and drink,
So how't increas't not how to curb't we think.
Old men wax impudent, lascivious, wild,
That fits them best, which scarce becomes a child.
Young men are stubborn, disobedient, stout,
And rule, and teach, even from the swathing clout,
They all things know and can but (what they ought)
Themselves and virtue. These they never sought.
Fashions from Spain, France, Germany, and Rome,
And Turkey too, wi^h their Religions come.
So they are suited fair from top to toe,
And each new suite in a new faith they go.
Matrons that are not dead nor yet alive.
But betwixt both, in some part vegetiue,
Crown their smooth scalps with hair, (...) now makes
A second Mistres ready for the grave
Young Maids (that go for such) are Mothers known b^aue
And such as should be none, are Virgins shown.
O modesty where dwelst thou? Womanhood
Is scarce by our high English under stood
Vice grows so common, tha^ it is far more
Opprobrious, to be chaste, then be a whore.
All things are out of order. Laws are made
Strong means not to defend, but to invade.
Then why should we limit the sea, or fire
Within their bounds, and not our own desire?
Southward the Armado, and the fleetes of Spain,
(Often beat^n) s^eme to threaten us again. Ann. Dom. 1588 The seas broke in
before West, now East.

And East and West the Seas would meet we see:
But that (O wonder!) Northward blessed we be.
The want of water was the cause before
Those huge built hulkes, could not approach our sho^e,
Who came resolu'de of conquest: and did stand
As if they meant to bear away our land.
Poor I Will so small thou were, and they so great
Too scant a sea for them that was thy seat.
But had they staide till now, now might they ride
On the swollen waves at ease in all their pride.
Andinto every heaven their bold Ships steer,
As if no sands, bars, shallowes, had bin there.
We know whens'ere they come, God can provide
Such seas, so high, so uncontrolled a tide,
Able without their Envy, or their aid
To bury us; for see how he has laid
Our works all level; draines, dikes, sluices, banks,
Fields, pastures, gardens, manors, farms, and frank^
With man their owner, and what Man does feed,
Are buried with a sea of tears indeed.
November did we escape thy fifth day thus,
That every day thou should be ominous?
Do we so soon forget ^he sixth day last,
And worst of all days to our Island past,
That thus we should so often remembered be,
From what strange thraldom, we were once set free?
Or do the waters thus break in, to show
How humorous and irregular vices flow?
How Sai^^-like Sacrilege does impropriate?
And calm Oppression swallows Church and State?
How close Hypocrisy bends his courtly knee,
And (wanting all faith) would have all faith's free?
How holy Hymen^ sacreds band are broken,
His torch extinguished, and his rites fore-spoken?
How Gotish lusts needs all those waves to slake
His scorching flames, hot as the infernal lake?
Or is it for all these crimes, and more untold,
The faithful Sea, which wont our I Will to hold
In his moist arms, from strange a^^aults secure,
Has changed his love to this sad ouerture?
And (for our sins) learnes us to fast and pray.
Bringing in fish, sweeping our flesh away?
That land which (Goshen-like) did flow whil-ere, Marshland in Norfolk.

With all that Man desires or life holds dear,
So that no spot in all this Isles large field,
The sithe more hay, sickle more corn did yield:
Where sweetness was the sauce, and fatnes fed,
Whilst Dearth, and Famine from the confines fled:
Where the stiffe-vdder'd Cow longed twice a day,
To meet the merry milke-maide on the way:
And missing her by chance, wrote on the ground
With milke-white letters where she would be found,
Now prostrate lies; the goodly beauty foiled,
The wealth washed thence, the gards and tre^ches spoiled.
O what assurance have we then in clay
Which (if not Lawyers) Seas thus eat away?
Build far from waters, that secures thy fear,
Though less thy profit be, safe dwelling there.
O no; what is that I see? a raging flame New Market burned with many other
notable town^ in England

^ounts up in yonder plain, and none can tame
His hot misgouern'd fury. Water here
Some cry, but no such element is near.
Like a mad-Dog that through the thronged streets
Ranging with rage snatcheth at all he meets,
And all that bitten are, as mad as he,
Run raging too, that few or none escape free:
The cry is up, and every man stands armed,
To do he knows not what till he be harmed;
And then to save himself neglects the rest,
And madly mischief does when he means best.
Or as a town of strength, at dead of night,
Surpised (by sudden stratagem or slight,)
The people (with the allarum bell awaked)
Run out to see what news amazed and naked;
And meeting death abroad, for life run home,
And find their houses s^ck'd before they come.
Then turning back again they know not whither,
Flock all on heaps and dye like friends together:
So far'de it there; the fire flew up and down
Snatching at every house within the town.
And whilst one thought his neighbors house to saue^
He sees his own does instant succor crave.
Here stands an Al^house tosting, and the Hostis
Swearing her false-s^or'de tally burned or lost is.
The T^pster (wanting water) plies with ale
The thirsty fire which drinks both new and stale,
And by that oyly-liquor is not quenched
But rather (Drunkard-like) enraged, incensed.
The Host (instead of pailes) fills pots and swears
H^e'le use no penny-pots that wants their ears.
Wishes his Iuggs were bigger, he would fill them,
And (but in vain) on the wild fire does spill them.
Here stares an Ostler whilst the flame makes c^asure^
On his small bottles and his ostry measure,
And here a Chamberlain gives quick attendance
To save his pretty faggots with a vengeance.
Those pretty faggots which fire-hot being eat
In a cold morning, scarce would make one sweat.
Here runs a ravening Usurer dog-like tired
Betwixt his own house and the mort-gagde fired.
Here flames a barn of some engrossing Farmer.
And here the study burns of some false Termer.
Here stands a kennell, there a rack and manger
For running horses, but both stay the danger.
A Baude houles here, and here a ^east of whores
Burnde often within, are now burnde out of doors.
Here Is a Tobacco shop, and in the Celler
The Indian Devil, our baud, witch, whore, man-queller,
That spirit waster, and that Liver heater,
Of t'humor radical that greedy eater,
That breath corrupter, and quick-eye-sight spoyler,
That wit confounder, and strong Memory foyler,
That pickpurse, thief, time^cheater, connycatcher,
That alehouse haunter, and fell mischief hatcher,
That all compounded evil of every Nation^
Too bad (almost) for the English imitation^
Tobacco by the fire was there caroused
With large pettounes, in piss perfumed and soused.
Thus what full many thrifty years erected,
One prodigal flame has wasted and dei^cted.
And now (behold) the prouder Chimnies stand
As heirs left well^ who wasted have their land,
Of whom the common people use to say,
It Is pity proper men should thus decay;
Yet none releeues them, or build up their state
To such an eminent fortune as of late.
Among these one Chimney stands, where passers by
May read this sentence with a running eye,
nothing is so close carried or concealde,
which shall not be in his due timere^eal'd.
Whether by chance or by divine decree,
(For so all humane actions ordr'ed be)
This object stands; that all may make good use
Of what they see, or quit them from excuse,
He not d^termine. Let it be my folly
Rather than be profane, to be too holy.
H^ that once drowned the world, can if he please,
Drown part or the whole world again with ease:
But since his word is past, though we abound
With that which caused the former world be drowned
He Will keep his promise, and the Sea restrain
From over flowing sinful slesh again.
Yet is it in his power the whole t'mmerse
In variable woes; plagues to disperse
In the most frequent stre^tes, most fragrant fields,
That the air may breath out death, ^helth now yields
Or thin cheek'd (...) (though a stranger borne)
Who now to know on Fridayes the English scorn,
Who of all forrainers is worst in^reated,
His fashion left, himself in prison seated,
May be familiar with our countrymen
(Like a post^ Natus, or free Denizen)
And that without an act, if God think good,
Though a^l the Peers and Commons it withstood.
Fire, air, earth, water, all are his: he can
With or without these, save or punish Man.
No place is free from him, no thing is hid,
He knows what Fauk^s, Persi^, and Cate
Under the ground; and what new plots do come bie did
From hell, or from hels Councel-chamber (Rome).
And this, (and all else) his blessed hand reueales
To his elect, and with deliverance seals.
Attend his pleasure then; first we shall see
Rome burn, and all with Rome that lynked be.
Then the whole world; and that fire shall disclose
Each truth, each falsehood, and each cause of those.
Till then, these waters do but wash the slime
Of Babel from this too indifferent time.
These petty fires, kindle our love and zeal,
(Halfe-dead) to King, the Church, and co^mon-weale,
Affliction profits. Strike us (Lord) in love;
Let thy mild hand each way our firm faith prove.
But let not Babel triumph in our fall,
Nor any that on Baal, or Dag^n call.
ANTIDOTVM CECILLIANVM.
DEDICATED To the Commonwealth.
DEsert has no true follower after death
But En^y; others flatter with their breath.
Jn vain I sought particular Patrons; they
When life left greatness, ran with life away.
Blood, kindred, friends, forsook him; so't was ^it,
We might have doubted else his worth and wit.
Their compass was too narrow to ^ield shade
To him that both their roots and fortu^es made:
But gentle England, since he quiet gave
To thee by his cares, give his corpse a grave.
And since his wisdom did renown thy name,
Be thou a Sanctuary to his fame.
And since he gave for thee his life and health,
Give him protection, thankful Common wealth.
TO THE HONOR of the illustrious Family of the CECILLS, deserving of this
Commmonwealth, all the Roman wreaths of triumph: The memorable Pyramids of
Egypt: And all other Trophes of Eternity.
AS by one mouer, motion, does commence,
Even from the Center, to circumference:
So from one good Man, many may arise,
Like-good, like-apt, like-faithfull, and like-wise.
This now is verified; The Cecills are
Statesmen in time of p^ace, Soldiers in war.
Epicedium.
What needs, thy Monument be raised?
What needs, the Muses singthy worth?
What needs, thy memory be praised?
Or what needs Art, thy fame set forth?
Let Art, time, gold, the Muse, and Men,
Guild falsehood, folly, ignorance:
Let them conspire against thee; and then,
The more they shall thy worth advance.
They work, write, rail, or praise to please,
"But Truth gives virtue, life, not these.

Darius on a Grave. stone found
This Epitaph: Who digs this ground
Shall treasure find. The greedy King
Dig'd there, but found another thing.
Within was written; Had not been
A beastly-minded man, I ween
The harm^lesse bones of the deceast
Had in their quiet tombs taken rest.
Who rips the coffins of the dead,
Finds same and honor thence are f^ed
With life, the Subject of their Ire;
Stench only stays to pay their hire.
"Worth has his Epicedium sung
"By enuies shrill and slandrous tongue.
WHen this rich soul of thine (now s^inted) kept
Her State on earth, my humble Mu^^ nere stepped
Out of that sweet content wherein she dwelt,
To sing thy worth, the eff^cts where of we felt.
But now since death has freedom given to thee,
To see thy scorn made others flattery,
And that each mouse on the dead Lion leaps,
And every riming ^en, forged matter heaps
On thy bright frame, casting their own base dirt
Upon thy honored hearse, (minding more hurt
To thee then `Death or He^^ can do) I may
And must be bold (or sin) this truth to say.
Each evidence thy foes bring, speaks thy praise:
For what can more thy fame and glory raise,
Then to be railed on by the worst of men^
Such as like out-lawes live, not in the ken
Of Justice, or community? Base slaves
Whose crimes and sins make their own nest their graus.
It Was meet thy virtues eminent and hie
Should not vn-en^ied live, vnslandred dye:
For then we might have feared thou had^st not been
So absolute a man; now it is seen
Even by those many shadows Enu^ throws,
That thy worth was substantial, and not shows.
De^rac^ion ^s perplexed, and f^ies about
Over a world of Acts to single out
Some one or two in thy whole life to scan,
And prove by the (what Death did) thou were man:
Yet s^eing that past credit, she descends
To view thy body, and her venom spends
Not against it but nature, which did shroud
So great a sun under so small a cloud.
But we that plainly see men sildome rise
Though they be learned, judicious, daring wise,
Except the body somewhat ^uites the mind,
And good clothes suit the body too; are blind
And mad with envy if we yield not thee
^orth above thought, who to that high degree
Rose through the eminent parts of thy blessed soul,
Above contempt, disgrace, scorn or control.
Nature did recompense thy want of clay
With heavenly fire; thy body could not stay
Thy acti^e soul here longer, it was too light
A clog to keep from Hean^n so strong a spright.
Well might thy body be a soul to those
Whose more gross earthen souls did late compose
Black libels against thy fame, and raked so low
Into thy purged excrements to know
What foul disease durst kill thee, and then found
Many were guilty: for it could not sound
They thought like truth, that one disease slew thee
When they having all yet escape to Deddick free.
By this they show that whatsoever we think,
They know all these diseases by the instinck,
They are familiar with them and of kin,
To their first causes of being deadly sin,
And of the elders house too. For the devil
(Chief libeller forms all degrees of evil
And like good boys of his, these labor too
(More then disease, or Death, or Hell can do)
To kill the soul, and to belly a fame
Which laughes to scorn, all scorn, and shames all shame.
You that stand next the helm and thinkey're free
From their sharp viperous tongues, it cannot be;
If death comes, these Ravens follow, and perchance
(Time favoring their desires) th'eile lead the d^nce
And rail at you too. It Is not you they hate
But our blessed King, Religion, and the State.
And if (which God forefend) so stood the time
Y'ould see they could do worse, then they can rhyme.
Now I have thrown my self into the way
To meet their rage, and (if I can) to stay
Their dog-like malice rather on my head
Then suffer it pollute and wrong the dead.
If they allege I give him more then due,
You know their custom, they cannot speak true.
But if they say I gave him less, their spite
Shows neither I nor they can do him right.

OPPORTVNE TIBI IN TEMPESTIVE NOBIS



The Sun past by degrees those signs
Which to his sotherne seat inclines,
And now in Leo sat aloft.
The s^eating labourer bans him ost,
The Shepherd melts, and ore the Plain
His new shorne-sheepe seek shades in vain.
The Merchant, Sea man, every T^ade
They say by him are Banckrupt made.
He hears it and (at height of noone,
Hides his bright beams behind the Moon.
They sadly know that does presage
Dearth, death, war, want to every age
And then his late wished absence moan;
"Fools wisemen miss, when they are gone.
SInce its decreed in heaven, found true on earth,
That all things have an end which had a birth;
That no estate is fixed, nights follow noone,
Ebs second floods, change fills the horned Moon
Which wanes again at full, and shows the glory
Of Earths best essence to be transitory:
How happy is that Man whose fate expires
Before declension crowned with his desires.
And has his days by virtuous actions told,
Guessing how much he would had he been old,
Since young, his noted deeds out-vied his days
And he lack't not true worth but rather praise.
Few touch this point, yet hither seem to bend
Preventing ruin with a violent end.
So Otho, and the Persian Monarch fell,
But this steep way precipitates to Hell
Flattering with seeming help our wretched state
Not curing woes, but making desperate.
Our way is holy, white, and leads to bliss
Not by oblique attempts. For nature is
Made privy with our passage, and we stay
Till she leads gently on, Grace making way.
Not every common President can fit
This golden rule, all aim; but few can hit
This narrow passage which more fames the man,
Then sailing twice through fatal Magelan:
Or girding all the earth with one small bote,
Discovering gold, new worlds, things of rare note.
From hence the ground of thy great praises spring
O Cecill loved of God, good men, the King,
Borne up not by stolen imps or borrowed plumes,
Which lets them fall who with high flight presumes
Near the suns scorching beams; thy native worth
Virtue, and active knowledge, set thee forth
^is Kingdoms Pilot, where no storm or stresse
^ould make thee lose thy compass or express
show of doubt, but firmly guide our state
^s the adst been ruler both of chance and fate.
This well thy Master saw, who therefore placed
^ee next himself, and with high honors graced
^y great deserts: more could thou not desire
^or earth afford, yet that which we admire
^as above this, even in the top of these,
^ing nearer heaven thither to mount with ease,
^s if the adst^ taken the advantage of the time
^n Gre^tnesse stairs, helped by good deeds to clime.
O happy thou, but wretched creatures we
^o s^e thy flight, and yet to slander thee:
^o f^ele the fruit of thy life wasting care,
which zealous for our good, no time would spare,
^o cherish nature, that we thus being free
should only freedom use to rail at thee.
^ur idleness proclaims thy well spent time,
^ince by thy means we leisure have to rhyme,
^hil'st neighbor States are acting it in blood,
which we scarce hear of, never understood.
The benefit the Sun gi^es to our sight,
We see not half so well by day as night.
Want gives a grace to goodness, when the inioying
^onfounds and dazells sense like honny cloying.
^ome needs no target till the sword be lost:
Whilst Nestor wakes, well may Thirsites boast. Plutar in vita Fabii.

^ishers and expert Masters are all one
^n calmes and deepes, the ship there goes alone.
^ut when the winds, seas, rocks, and sands do fight,
^he skillful Master then keeps all upright.
We fear no storms the Porpuses do play,
The Dolphins dance, and Prot^us flocks do stray
Over Neptunes watery Kingdom safe and free,
None casting doubts, or fearing what may be.
May this calm last perpetual, and faith then
We never shall need thee Cecil nor such men:
Others we have to fill thy room thou gone,
So Aristippus says, stone sits on stone.
We yet are senseless of thy loss, and find
No danger in it. Like some within the wind
Of a great shot, whose violent thunder drives,
The sense into distraction, and depriues
The ear of present use: so did report
Of thy death make us mad to rail and sport,
To temporise, lie, flatter; so defaming
Our selves, state, manners, law, religion shaming:
But now the fit being past, it is plain to fense
"Though man for bears Heaven pleads for innocenc^
"Virtue o'recomes by sufferance, and good deeds
"Are fen^'d by Calum^y, as herbs by weeds.

The Cynicke sick and like to die,
To such as asked where he would lie,
Made answer where you will; the field

But they reply'de, the fields are wide;

Haunt those places; Kites and Crows
Who to dead men no mercy shows.

TO THE RIGHT WORTHY, Henry Doile, Esquire.
THe folly which in man with wit is fixed,
Must needs have pleasant things with wholesome mixed;

Who (weary of contentfull Countries rest)
Repaires to Court, with patience had best
Fore^ arm himself, both Fate and Fortune proof
Against all assaults, or wisely stand aloof:
For plainness is despisde, and honesty
Is fellow Shakerag with simplicity.
To be a Scholar, is to be a fool:
Rude impudency is the Courtiers School.
Arts are but Lackies to attend and wait
On Ignorance, Appearance, and Deceit.
Can thou seem wise? Enough. This follows then,
"Vizards have fairer vizages then men.
To be a Soldier is to be a slave,
Danger abroad, reproach at home to have.
Deep furrowed wounds fresh bleeding in the wars
Finds less relief and pity then the scars
Of muskey Courtiers, when their smooth slicke skin,
Is bramble-scratched with a Ladies pin.
Nor do they now, (as er'st they did) delight,
The stubborn Steedes to manage to the fight;
To tilt and turnay with strong staves of oak,
To fight at barriars with a Brandons stroke,
To dance in complete armor, (but alas!)
To tilt, fight, dance and turnay with a less.
The Schollership they use, is to discourse
Of my Lords bloud-hound, and his Honors horse:
To tell how well the one pursued the chase,
The other swiftly ran a lusty race.
Or if more high their heavy wits aspire,
It Is to dispute of lust, and loose desire.
Their Soulderie is swaggering in the Court,
Where none may strike the vrger but in sport:
To offer strangers, strange and foul disgraces,
Presuming on their privileged places,
Which oft-times is repaide them, when they come
Abroad from Court, they are w^lcom'd like Jack drum
Their idle hours, (I mean all hours beside
Their hours to eat, to drink, drab, sleep and ride^
They spend at shooue-boord, or at penny prick,
At dice, cards, tennis; or they will not stick
Rather then not be idle, to delay
At shittle-cocke the precious time away.
O slaves! regard what slander does arise
From your effeminate slow cowardice.
Have you no Souls? no pens? no swords in hand?
Behold where cursed Mahom^t does stand,
Triumphing over the Cross; he Jew beside
And Heathen do our holy faith deride.
For shame vnsheath your swords, let not reproach
You sluggish ease is foreign kingdoms broch.
Cast painted Puppets from your yielding necks
And scorn to stoop when the stale Strumpet beckes:
Let stallians serve to squench the scorching hea^e
Of such as marrow, oysters, Ringoes, eat.
You that are Scholars, soldiers, or such men
Whose souls seek knowledge, flee this shady den
Of ignorance; let thither none resort
But Tailors, Bauds, Perfumers, fools for sport,
Cooks, Painters, Barbers, Fiddlers; these may hap
To sleep in for^unes net, and honors lap.
In honors lap? auaunt base dunghell grooms
You are but shadows: honors lo^ty rooms
Must be supplide with men. Though Isis Ass
Think men adore his greatness as they pass.
Yet Isis knows it is false; then hence be gone
And let desert be honored alone.

To triumph over Soldiers, Arts, and Schools.

AN IRISH BANQVET, OR THE Mayors feast of Youghall.
TAles many have been told by men of yore,
9 Worthics
Of Giants, Dragons, and of half a score
Worthies save one, of Castles, kings and knights,
Of Ladies loves, of Turnaies, and such sights
As Mandeuile never saw; yet none like this
Which my Mu^e howles: then listen what it is.
The old Maior^
Saturn grew old, and the gods did agree,
That New Mayor.
Jove should him deprive of Sovereignty,
And become chief himself. A solemn day
Appointed was, when all the Aldermen^
Gods most gay,
Attired in mantles fair, and truses strange,
Came to behold this Lecher-like loved change.
The fry of all the Gods was there beside,
And each his bastard had, his Whore and Bride.
The milk-white path which to ^oues Palace leads,
In comely order all this rich troop treades.
An old wi^e.
Ceres threw wheat upon Jove's face most dainty,
Presaging and forespeaking future plenty.
The well-instructed swine did follow after,
And for the whe^t left something that was softer,
Smell out the meaning.
Ciuet, like Irish soap. Sweet naturde beasts,
Fit waiters at such civil solemn feasts.
At length the train reached the high Hall of Jove.
The Gods sat down, the Aldermens w^^es.
Goddesses then strove
For place and state: but Mistres Maiores.
Iun^ most demurely,
Plac'de and displac'de that day, as pleased her surely,
The tables stood full crownde with dainty dishes,
Enough to satisfy the idle wishes
Of longing Wives, or Maids grown green and sickly,
With eating fruit, and doing nothing quickly.
Huge So they call their butter cakes^
hands of butter not yet fully blue,
With quiuering custards of a doubtful hue.
Stewde prune, and bread that passes Bread of crud^.
Malahane.
And honny sweeter far then sugar cane.
Green apples and such plenty of small Nuts.
That there with safely one might fill his guts,
Though he were sure the Cooks were Irish sluts.
The goblets sweld with pride, themselves to see,
So full of French and Spanish wines to be.
Nectar-like Vsqua-bath, or Aqua-vitae,
And brown Ale grown in years and strength most mighty
Was there as a Common Irish drink.
Bonniclabbar,
That every guest his clean lickt lips might slabbar
In full satiety, till they were crownde
With Bacchus wreathes^ and in still slumber drownde.
The fidling Two fiddlers and a blind boy with a bagpipe.
Spheeres made music all the while.
And riming Their poer^ Chroniclers.
Bardes brave meeter did compile
To grace this feast: when One of the Aldermen.
Phoebus standing up
Took in his greasy fist a greasier cup
And drunk to Daphnes health. Bacchus replide
And straightway quaft another to the bride
Of Mulciber. This health past all along.
Then Mars his feather wagde amongst the throng
Carowsing Pallas health (brave wench and wise)
Which draught cost bonny The fiddlers boy.
Cupid both his eyes,
Straining to pledge it. Maias son stood still,
And stilly marked how Ganimed did ^ill
The several healths, which swiftly past around
Till all the Gods, and Goddesses had bound
They were almost all drunk.
Their brows with wreathes of Iuy leaves and vines,
And each his forehead to his knee enclines.
The Sun went down.
Apollo then slipped thence, and being half drunk
His burning bonnet doft, and slily sunk
His head in Thetis lap. So heaven lost light,
And cheerful day was damp't with irksome night.
Master Mayor called to his wife for candles.
Jove yet disposde to mirth, bad Juno spread
Her Starry mantle over the worlds black head.
But She was drunk and would none.
she inrag'de with plumpe Lyeus juice,
And mad with jealousy, without excuse
Refusde to guild the then vnspangled sky,
With the eyes of Argus her cow-keeping spy.
She took Master M ior a box on the care.
And aided by Necessity, and Fate,
And all the shrewder Goddesses, Jove's state
She durst assume, and boldly press as ^arre
As all the Giants in their civil war.
They first bound Jove, then all the other Gods,
Who were constrained by darkness, drink, and th'ods
Of this conspiracy, to condescend
To hard conditions for a quiet end.
Mistress Maiores might do what she would.
Jove granted ^uno power of all the air,
Her frown or smile makes weather foul or fair.
His thunderbolts and lightning she may take,
And with her tongue the worlds firmes axtree shaken
From hence do women their free charter hold,
To rule against reason, or else cry and scold.
Proserpina obtained of her Pluto,
That such should only speed, who she-saints sue to:
That all affairs of man in state or purse
His wife should sway, or women that are worse.
From whence this custom springs in town and city,
The wife grows rich, the bankerout begs for pity.

And that no saucy god should once reprove her:
That Mars and she might dally, whilst Don Vulcan
Should freely to their pleasures drink a full can.
Fro whence this use proceeds, that wives once wa^tons
Wage servants, as the French the Swizzers Cantons.
You that are Statists look unto this gear,
Do not Tyrone and his rash striplings fear;
Fear not Tirconnel, nor those Galliglasses
That cut, and hacke, and carue men as it passes:
Fear those which all these fear, those fathers holy
Which make the whole world their sole monopoly:
That crown and vncrowne Kings, when as they please,
Play fast and loose like Iuglers with slight ease;

CONTAINING CERTAIN TALES OF True Liberty. False Friendship. Power United.
Faction and Ambition.

By THOMAS SCOT Gent.

LONDON, Printed by John Legatt for Francis Constable. 1625.

MONARCHIA.
DEDICATED To all the worthy professors of the Law, who make not
priuate-wealth, but the good and peace of the Commonwealth the end of their
studies and practice.
Though you (perhaps) be Clyentlesse and few,
Friendlesse and poor, yet it is to you I sue
For kind acceptance. You alone are they
Who by example guide us in our way.
You look not on the fee, but on the cause, Cambden Insula vectis. This title
is given them by our worthy L. chief Justice of Eng.

And follow truth, as truth does lead the Laws.
The rest, with vice, and wealths ill-gotten load,
Pass on to death, in glories beaten road.
THE inhabitants of the I Will of Wight did bost,
No vermin used to harbor in their coast.
For they no hooded Monks, nor Foxes had,
Nor Law * Retriuers who make fools run mad,
With their strife-stirring tongues; but lived as free,
From these, as by them others combred be.
And though our whole land cannot boast so far,
That we from all such vermin quitted are:
Yet happy is our I Will, that is hemd about
With water-walles, to keep our enemies out;
Whilst we (as Adam did) in Eden dwell,
And scarce of famine in an age hear tell.
Where hills are clad with woods, and vales with corn
Whose laden ears do listen to be shorn.
Where shephearde neither Lion doubt, nor Bear,
Nor ravening Wolf which sheep and shepherd tear;
But each in safety dwell, and silly sheep
From all but Man, do one the other keep.
O happy are we if we know our good,
And if our state be rightly understood:
To live thus free under so blessed a King,
Just Magistrates and Cleargy-men, that sing,
The songs of Syon in the holy tongue
Converting old men, and informing young.
No spirit-tyrant, Pope, State, Tyrant, Turk.
Can here their bloody ends and proiects work;
But each in safety may his own possess,
More free then Kings, because our cares be less.
But most unhappy are those neighbor lands,
Where Peace, and Plenty, as two strangers stands;
Where bloody war, and bloodlesse famine ride
Upon the ruined top of thanklesse Pride:
Where Law destroies, Divinity deceiues,
And where the crown the care of kingdom leaves.
Where men eat men, as beast deuourd by beast,
The strong the weaker kill, the great the least.
Where tyranny in triumph mounted hie,
Makes truth and innocence in dungeon lie.
This tale the difference shows, that weemay know
How much to God for our good king we owe.
An aged Heart, upon mount Carmel bred,
Having as Admiral the Navy led
From Syria through the Seas, to Cyprus shore,
Where all the I Will with green is covered over.
Hapt by a Park to travail, where he spide
A younger sad Heart, standing close beside
The imprisoning pale, and using all his skill
To free himself from thence, to larger ill.
Good brother (quoth the stranger) let me know,
What heavy thoughts they are that vex you so?
Why do you sadly so your self bemone?
Why having friends within come you alone
To feed sad melancholy, and invent
To do a rash act, which you will soon repent?
The younger Dear made answer, Can ye muse
Why I am sad, and wherefore I do use
All means to free my self, from being thus
A slave to him that is foe to all of us?
Know brother, I endure more sorrows here,
In one half day, then you in one whole year.
For you have liberty to come and go,
Though forrester and wood-man both say no.
But I by cru^ll man, imprisond keep,
Within this wooden walls, where none but sheep
Hares, Conyes, Cowes, and other of my kin
Are my associates, simple souls within.
I have no beast of worth, of birth, or wit,
With whom I may converse; but feign to fit
My lofty spirit to the lowly strain,
Of base companions, sluggish, fearful, vain.
No Wolves or Dogs come here whereby decaies
The exercise of valor and the praise.
The traps for vermin, are so thick beset,
That oftentimes they some of us do get.
The watchful keeper, every night and morn,
Commands me rise, and rest with his shrill horn,
He with his Lymehound rounds the pale about,
For fear least we be stolen or broken out.
He feeds us cheerfully, and does provide
Sufficient meat that is fit for every tide;
But being fat, he chooses which he likes,
And through our sides, deaths forked arrow strikes.
Thus all he does, is his own turn to serve,
And for his own life does our lives pres^rue.
Then gentle brother help to free me hence,
And my swift thanks shall yield you recompense.
Stay brother mad-brain stay, quoth Light foot the^
If you were out, you would wish you in again.
I was in Syria borne, and every year
A dangerous voyage make, for what you here
Enjoy with proud cont^mpt. We cannot find
"Content on earth, without a thankful mind.
You slight your ease and plenty; we, alas!
With toil seek that which you with scorn let pass.
Our meat is grutchd, we like to robbers watched,
So what we feed on, here and there is snatched.
The pale you call your prison rather may,
Be tearmd your Castle, Garden, Closet, Stay,
To keep ou^ others from those joys of yours,
Or to preserve you from these woes of ours.
Whilst we without by Lions, Leopards, Bears,
Wolves, Eagles, Serpents, and a thousand fears,
Are howrely vexed, beset, besieged so,
That as our shadows, death does next us go.
Yet none our deaths revenge, nor craves account,
How our neglected blood is lauisht out.
For even that Man (which is your guard) to us
Proclaims himself a foe, most dangerous.
He hunts for our destruction cheeres the hound,
Rides, runs, whoopes, hollowes, and at every sound,
Rings our shrill deaths bell with so fearful blast,
As charms our joints to hear, whilst hounds make have
To finish our desired death, and glut
With our sweet flesh, each vermins maw and gut.
Thus do we die abroad, for every man
Claims right in us, and labors all they can,
Our weary feet in toils, nets, snares t'inclose,
When you have friends, to guard you from your foes
If therefore you have told me truth that there
You do no creature but your keeper fear;
O bring me to this prison, show me how
I may obtain a blessed life with you.
Direct me to a leap, i will soon leap in.
"It Is happiness, unhappy to have been.
With that he mounts the pale, adue quoth he,
Vain, wide, wild world; who serves the law is free.
Epimythium.
There ^ath been long disputation to find out the true freedom. The world
holds opinion that Libertines who do what they list, and lust what soever is
unlawful are only free men. Cain was founder of this brotherhood. He might
do what he list, he was a vagabond exempt from laws, he had a mark of
privilege set upon him to keep^ him from punishment here. Our Jesuits and
King-killers being exempt from the tempor all sword are free of this company^
But the child of God whose affections are mortified, who obeyes law for
conscience sake, who is a law unto himself, is the only freeman; for him the
Magistrate bears the sword in vain. He would be honest without law, and will
be honest if the la^ should ^orbid him. Yet would he not resist, but submit
himself to power. He is free of that company whereof S. Paul professes
himself one when he says, I have learned in all estates to be contented.
How much more happy are they who live under the protection of a good King, and
wholesome laws, then these are who living here like outlawes, go without
contradiction out of momentary pleasure and liberty into eternal slavery and
punishment.

The Cony-burrow.
Dedicated to the lovers of worth, and friends of virtue, who follow truth with
a single heart, and speak it with a single tongue.
Be inn^cent, but circumspect withal,
The Turtles mate may be the Turtles stall.
(...) wise yet trust not wit. The traps we make
For others, first do our false fingers take.
What we delight to use, take pride to wear,
Take us; as Absalon hanged with his hair.
Then walk upright, to neither hand incline,
There Is naught frees innocence, but grace di^ine.
THe Polcat, Ferret, Lobstar, Weasell, made
A secret match, the Cony to invade:
Which no way they could compass, whilst he kept
Himself abroad, when as he fed or slept.
At last the Polcat to the Cony went,
With this smooth speech. Good cosen my intent
Has been long since t'acquaint you with our kin,
And tell ye how our cousenage came in.
Your Grandame was my careful fostermother,
To your kind S^re, I was a fosterbrother;
My education, nurture, and my food,
I from my youth received from your sweet brood.
In recompense whereof, my thankful mind,
A fit requital long desired to find.
The time is come, for I have lately found,
A secret plot, wherein the cunning hound
The close dissembling Tumbler, Lurcher swift,
With Raynard that knows many a subtle shift.
The Eagle and the Goshauke, have agreed,
Their stomach with your d^inty ^lesh to feed.
First they intend the hound shall hunt you out,
And by your footing heat ye once about.
Then shall that hypocrite, the Tumbler tri^,
To cheat you of your life, with his false ^ie.
But if he fail, the Lurcher with his speed,
Will snatch ye up (they hope) and do the deed.
If not the Eagle, Fox, and Goshauke, swear,
To eat no meat, till on your lims they tear.
The harmless Cony; at this dir^ report,
Ready to sound, besought in humble sort
The wary Polcat him t'inst^uct and teach
A way, how he might s^ape his foes long reach.
Faith (quoth the Polcat) you perhaps might hide,
Your self among thick bushes vnespide,
But that the Hounds and Lurcher both are ^here,
whose sents will quickly find ye out, I fear.
Again upon the rocks, you might remain,
But that the Eagle, Fox, and Goshauke saine
Thei'l watch ye there; so that no other way
Remains to escape with life, but night and day
To scrape and grate with your forefeet, a den,
Within the earth, where safe from beasts and men,
And foul, and every bloody foe you shall,
Your life securely lead in spite of all.
The simple Cony doubting no deceit,
Thought treason had not council for a bait^
And therefore thanks his foe, and (glad at heart)
To dig his own grave uses all his art.
A sandy place he seeks, and finding one,
Free from all clay, or flint, o^ other stone,
He with his forefeet grates, and makes a burrow,
As deep, as if he meant to travail through,
The body of the earth, and meet the Sun,
When it unto the Antipodes does run.
Which having finished, he prepares a feast,
And there the Polcat is the chiefest guest.
The Lobster, Ferret, Weasel too must go,
To joy him in his house, they love him so;
And their great friend, the ^iluer-suited Snake,
Must needs along with them, and merry make.
He welcomes them, and does before them set,
What iunckets he with purse or pains could get.
The Lions Court has not a dainty dish,
But he prouides it, even beyond their wish.
"Yet they that long for blood, till blood be shed,
"Cannot be satisfied, though fully feed.
Ingratitude! thou monster of the minde^
Art thou not only proper to mankind?
Is there a beast that can forget his friend,
And for his own ends, work his fellows end?
Is there a beast whose lust prouokes him kill
The beast that did him good, nere wished him ill?
Is there a beast who under kindness can
Dissemble hate? O then thrice happy man!
Thou art not only he that kilst ^hy brother,
Some beasts there are that murder one another.
Some fowls, some fishes, Serpents some there are
Who pray upon their kind in open war.
And some that under friendship fal^ly faind,
With fellows murder have their natures staind.
Nay there is one who can so cover ^uill,
That man may judge him Angel, find him devil.
He first with sweet meats poysond Adams seed,
Since when of sweet meats wisest men take heed.
So need not these bold gu^sts, they eat and drink
And then rise up to play; but never think
Ought fadgeth right, till they have brought to pass
The purposde plot for which this meeting was^
Theref^re (dissemblingly) the Polcat gins,
To lick and catch the Cony, and so wins
Hold underneath his throat, which having fast,
The tragedy begins, the sport is past.
For all assault him then on every part,
Some at his sides, some at his head and heart.
Some at his belly, but the poisonous Snake,
Does at his tail a deadly issue make.
The helpless Cony ^ues, intreat^, and strives,
But he must die had he ten thousand lives.
Each foe his greedy go^ge with blood does glut
And with his sweet flesh cram each hollow gut.
"But blood that is sweet in taste, is not so sound,
"To feed upon, as milk that is easier found.
The Snake with poisonous touch had venom spread,
Through all the swelling veins, from tail to head.
And they had sucked the black infection in;
A fitting vengeance for their crying sin.
Straight they their stomach find not well at ^ase,
And something feel, that does their minds displease.
The VVeasel first suspects the Snake, for he
Can never with a Serpent well agree;
Says, they are poisond all by one base slave,
Whose company the Ferret needs would have.
The Snake replies, he did no more but what
He was appointed to perform by plot.
And if they foolishly had eat their last,
He could not mend with sorrow what was past.
They find it true, but find it now too late,
Each rauing dies, and yields constraind by fate.
Yet ere they die, all do their farewell take,
By shaking teeth together on the S^ake.
Who deadly wounded, crawles but faintly thence,
Confounded with the guilt of his offense.
And heeding not his way, by good mishap,
Became a prisoner to the warriners trap.
This feast was ended thus, death took away,
And where they did not well we mend it may.
Epimythium.
Some are of opinion that wisdom consists i^ the ability to give good
counsel. But I think the knowledge how to take good counsel and how to
discern the differences of ad^ise, is the principallpart of wisdom. That
Frog in Aesope which in a great drought spying water i^ a deep pit advised his
fellow to leap downe^ that they might be satisfied and live there, gave good
counsel and seemed to be a pattern of the first wisdom spoken of^ But the
other Frogge that refused his advise, and diued deeper then the present time,
then the bott^me of the pit with this question; But if the water fail us
there, how shall we get out, or how shall we live there^ was a figure of the
second wisdom, and teaches us that it is harder to take good counsel then
to give it. Let us therefore beware in this point, and learn to look a little
beyond that good which is first and most apparent in every project, The second
and third good is that which we must rest on^ for truth is often most remote
and neorest the bottome^ all that swims uppermost is the froth and false good
and fraud.

The House of Fame.
Dedicated to all the noble atten dants of Royalty in the Camp of Virtue, who
fight for the honor of the Church, and Commonwealth.
Till now of late we feared that loud report,
Of Cressy field, Poicters, and Agincourt,
Fought by our Kings and Princes heretofore,
Had not been true, or should be told no more.
We wondered if those Nobles ever were
Who^ ^ame for arms and bounty did prefer^
We doubted all our Countries had forgot.
The deed of Audely or believed it not^
we thought our Nation was of worth ^eref^,
When bows and arrows and brown bills were left.
But see^ occasion now has turned our eyes,
To inward wars where greater wonders rise.
To see affection couquerd, l^st chastisd'e,
Priae humbled, Murder slain, all vice despisd'e.
And all old vert^es freshly now reneude,
By fa^re examples as the Sun ere vewd.
In which bra^e war of wonders (passing far
All other conflicts that compounded are
(Of love and hate) each Lord who lends a hand
To fight against vice for virtue, does this land
More ^onor then his ancestors before
In conquering France, and shall be famd for it more.
Some for their Prudence who found out and led,
Others for zeal through whom the enemy fled^
Others for Art, whose skill the squadrons placed
Others for Justice who the e^emy chased,
And some for Constancie^ who held it out.
And still unwearied, not v^w^unded fought.
But none more ^ame attaind then mercies squire,
Who begd to give, all saying i^ desire,
He Audely-like taught Courtiers how to crave
What they might give aw^y^ and giving s^ue,
Save free from fear of forfeiture or loss,
Or there-begging or the next y^^res cross:
Or enuies eye sore, or the Commons ^ate,
Or poores complaint, or grieuance of the state,
To him and to the rest, this tale is sent,
Howsoever taken with a good i^tent.
FAme that in Homer^s time a vagrant was,
Without a house and home, did after pass
In stately structures all the mixed race
Of S^mdeities, and every place
Built her a Court, assisted by the Rages
Of s^ndry Poets i^succe^ding ages.
For every one did something add, to frame
More space and room for their friends narrow fame.
Which as they purchased, still to her they gave
And that is the cause, themselves so little have.
This Fame has now her house glazde all with eyes,
The rafts, beams, balkes, nerves, sinews, arteries;
The doors wide open, ears; hanged round about
With nimble tongues, and couerd so without.
All things are seen and heard the wide world ore
Which touch that place, and farthest off the mo^^.
The House of Fame built up four stories hie,
Stands in an open pl^ine, in which does lie
Four sister twins, True ^ame, and good the first,
And eldest are; false and had fame the worst.
And youngest pair, yet swiftest are in flight
And though last borne, yet often come first to light.
These last dwell in two darker rooms below,
Among the thick Crowdes where all errors grow.
There keep they Court, where Scandals, Libels, lies,
Rumors, Reports, Suspicions, c^lumnies,
Are favorites and Go^ernors of State,
Whose practice it is true worth to ruina^e.
False fame lives lowest, and true Fame above,
Bad Fame next false, good fame next, true does moue^
Yet good fame sometime does with false fame stay,
And bad fame sometime does with true fame play.
But false and true (opposd) will never meet,
Nor bad and good fame, one the other greet.
It so fell out (as often strange things befall)
A gallant Knight, arrived at that fair Hall,
Attended on with such a noble sort,
Of warlike squires, as filled this spacious Court.
Who curiously enquiring of the rout,
Whose Court it was, could no ways find it out.
For contradictions cross each other so,
As truth from falsehood he could no ways know.
Bad fame did call it hers, and said, she was
A guide to such as unto glory pass.
False Fame did call it hers; he saw they lide,
For above their heads, two brighter Queens he spide.
True fame spoke to him then, and let him know,
That ^he and good fame did the building owe,
Being eldest borne, to Titan and the Earth,
Before the Giants war: when the others birth
Long since was subject to their p^rents sin,
And heavens curse which now they lived in.
For as those Giants against the Gods did war,
So these to truth professed enemies are;
Had by strong hand, and fraud, vsurpd her state^
And to express to virtue v^most hate,
Had bard all passage other houses hie,
That mor all men might in oblivion die
Or have their memories blasted, glories killed
By eating time, wi hlies and slanders filled.
She wished him then if he his good desired
To have repeated, or his spi^ it aspired
To worthy honor as old knights had wont,
(Whose swords not rust, but too much use did blunt)
That he would use some means to set them f^ee,
Whereby his blessed name might ^ternizd be.
Good Fame then told him, that the only way,
How he this enterprise accomplish may,
Was by the help of mercy, prudence, art,
Iustic^ and zeal, and Constancy of heart.
All their known friends to summon up in arms,
To force the place, and to disperse those swarms
Of idle vagabonds; who kept below
And hated good Fame, would not true fame know.
Then (since the stayres of fame were broken down,
And do es stopped up to glory and renown)
She wild him make an engine where withal,
He might her lodging and her sisters scale.
And so himself in spite of peril, raise
Above the reach of envy, or dispraise.
The Knight (in spirit ravished with delight
To hear their speech, to see their goodly sight)
Mounts his fierce Coursers back, with which at hand
His Squires attend vpou his strict command.
Wills every one of them to take a dame,
Such as the Ladies of the house did name,
Who there attended that they might direct
This high attempt, with order and respect.
The Squires with willing minds the knight obaide,
And each behind them took a lovely maid.
Prudence directs her Squires to lead the way,
(Who follows her direction cannot stray,)
At length they come unto a fruitful wood,
Wherein a world of upright timber stood;
Tall Cedars, Cypres, Pine and royal Oaks,
With country Elmes, and Ash for plow and yokes.
The lea ned Laurel, and the weeping Mirrh,
The smarting Birch, and the sweet smelling Firr
Grew there in order, and all trees beside,
Where in the thrifty Woodreeue takes pride,
The knight suruaies all this, yet ^inds not one
Fit to be feld; till Prudence lights upon
A proud straight Aspe, whose wauing top did lean
On a slight Poplar, with some shrubs between.
The cursed Eldar, and the fatal Yewe,
With W^^ch and Nightshade in their shadows grew;
Whose saples tops, with mildewes often stood,
And grew self-seare, and ouertopt the wood.
The Raven and Shreikeowle there did build their neasts,
And at their roots did harbor harmefull beasts,
Which Pruden^e saw, but mercy would not see,
Till she perceived how every other tree
Drooped underneath the height of these alone,
And could not thrive, or grow till these were gone.
She therefore (joined with Constancy and Zeal)
Besought sharp ^^stice, who does euenly deal
Her wary blows, to fell all these with speed;
Who soon consents, and soon, performs the deed.
At every stroke she fetched, the trees did groan,
The rest did echo laughter to their moan.
And now they lie along, their branches topt,
Their bark pild off, their trunks asunder chopped.
Then Art with rule and line, these vselesse payer
Frames (^ngine-lik^) a straight clowd climing stayer
To mount Fames house; this every Squire does reare^
And bravely on their backs do thy her bear.
But Mercy seeing all the other meant
To burn the C^ips, to save them she is bent.
And, with her Squire, the knight prays, let them lie,
For he shall gain, and glory g^t thereby.
Since chips which cut from Aspe and Poplar be,
Do soon take root, each grows a goodly tree.
The knight co^^ents, and fenceth round the spring.
Whose forward growth does hope of profit bring.
And now, together to the house of Fame
With speed they pass, where first the falsest Dame
Salutes them with a lie, and ^aith she hears
Her Sisters are together by the ears,
And have destroyde each other; this she had
From her Twin sister, who tells rumors bad.
They slight her leasings, and with speedy assay
To raise the lather, where bold Zeal makes way;
But false Fame and her Sister, lay about
To hinder her, with all their rascal route.
Slander, foole-hardines and heartles fear^,
With foolish Pity, and false Lou^ was there,
Damnde In^idelitie, and secret Hate,
And treason ^oo, that close d^ss^mbling mate.
Who all with open mouth, and open lies,
All ways to stop his honored work devise.
They rail, and fight, entreat, and curse and ban.
The Knight proceeds, in scorn of what they can.
And mounts the ladder, with his sword in hand,
Which soon disparkles, such as dare withstand.
Zeal hales him up, and Prudence guides him right,
True Constancy encourages the fight,
Mercy saues all the inno^ent, who swarm
For company, not with intent of harm;
Art orders every act, the engine stays
And helps the Knight step after step, to praise
The lusty squires below, with sword and lance,
Withstand bad fame, whilst Justice does advance
Her heavy hatchet, and strikes off the head
Of both the leaders, and there leaves them dead.
Which when their troops discover, they forsake
The usurped fortress^, and themselu^s betake.
To heady flight, into a marsh near hand,
Where many whispering reeds and Osiars stand.
There they like out-lawes do themselves enclose,
In wilful banishment, with all the foes
Of this good knight, whose valor undertook
This high attempt, that Fame might rightly look
On all deseruers, and that man might find,
Like freedom for his tongue, as for his mind.
That virtue migh be crowned by true fame,
And honest meaning live with honored name.
Which promise gladly both the sisters swore,
In solemn form; and now as heretofore
The freedom of their tongues they both possess;
And worth is known from base unworthiness.
The knight they humbly thank, and him they crown
The Sovereign of glory and renown.
Which style, Fames trumpetters the four winds blow
Through the earths four quarters, that the world may know
The extent of virtuous actions; how no power
Can stop their passage, nor lanke time devour
Their sweet remembrance; which shall live as long
As nature has an ear, or eye, or tongue.
To every Squire then they this favor give,
That after death their Fames shall ever live;
For still those Ladies, whose imploiment they
So well aduanc't'shall duly night and day
Repeat heir labors, and prefer them far
Beyond Alcides works, as peace does war
Surpass in glory, or those works we do,
When others wills, and ours we conquer too.
Now it is proclaimd that if we tell no lies,
We may with boldness speak and fear no spies.
That what this age has done, this age may hear,
As well repeated now as the next year.
That all our words our selves shall first expound,
And that no forced construction shall confound
Our honest meaning, but be it ill or well,
We may with freedom our opinions t^ll.
Since no man dares to do the thing which he,
Would have all the world both hear and see.
These orders ratified, they fall to sport,
And fill with maskes and reuells all the Court.
The sequel I refer to Fames relation,
Whose golden trumpe sounds us a blessed nation.
Satellitium.
Dedicated to all that stand Sen inell, that watch and ward in defense of this
kingdom, especially to the strength and guard of the State.
Be of one mind; Religion ties a knot,
Which none undoes, by practice or by plot.
But if in that we differ, be our breed
Within one house, or womb, of all one seed.
It Is seuerd soon by hate, respect, or gold,
Which Law can never soulder, art make hold.
'Faith only ioynes, what nothing sunder can.
'Beasts love for benefits, for virtue Man.
Who guarded round about, with Parthian bows,
Or Spanish pikes; or hedged and dikt with rows
Of sturdie Ianisaries, or the shot
Of hardy Swizzars, or the valiant Scot^
And after these with walls of steel and brass,
Hemd in so close that scarce the air may pass
Betwixt the cliffes, is not so free from doubt,
As is that King whom love does guard about.
Whom subjects love does guard, because that he
Guards them from all oppression, and makes free
His noble favorers to desert and worth,
Spreading his valiant virtues frankly forth,
That both his own may find, and neighbors know,
What glorious fruit does from religion grow.
How sweet an odor Justice sends to heaven,
How rare example is to Princes given,
By virtuous deeds, to stop the mouths of those,
Who vnreform'de are reformations foes.
Such one sleeps safe within the arms of love,
Divine regard does all his subjects move
To due obedience; and with sacred awe
Binds conscience, with a stronger bond then law.
Such heaven informs, whilst hell does undermine,
And spit^ of darkest plots with grace divine
Does hedge about, that naked in the arms
Of en^mies he is preserved from harms.
They sleep securely, feed on wholesome cates,
Angels their beds make, cooks their delicates
Gives Antidotes against poisons, does defend
Against d^mned w^tches and their God the fiend,
No ^esuits at their elbowes can do hurt,
Nor t^oopes of Papists that their courts ingirt.
For God does them in his blessed arms enclose,
Safe, though their chiefest favorites were foes.
O happy then good Kings proceed, ride on,
Grow up in glory, as you have begun.
Ride on for truths sake, look on either hand,
how you are guarded with a heavenly band
Of blessed spirits, who shall lead you still
^n holy paths, and guid^ your steps from ill. Psalm. 91.

These being with you, you shall boldly tread
Upon the Lion, and the Dragons head,
And trample danger underneath your feet,
As men tread stones, or dirt within the street,
Which only spraids them; your heauen-garded state
^s safer far, then that of Mithridate,
The King of Pontus, unto whom befell,
What strange adventure in this tale I tell.
This King perceiving well there was no band, Aelianus.

Of duty, love, or nature, could withstand
The strong inticement of corrupting gold,
Or baser lust, or humor ouerbold,
Or fond ambition (which makes empty slaves
Swim bladder borne upon the floting waves
Of false Opinion, with the arm of pride,
Of borrowed power, and ignorance beside)
But that these would pervert the faith they had,
And cause them after farther hopes run mad;
Did to prevent all this, a guard provide
Of faithful beasts, whose strength had often been tried.
A Bull, a Horse, a Hare, the Captains were,
Of this strong guard, whose force did nothing fear
But falsehood, and Ingra^itude, and Treason,
From which they were as free, as man from reason
Why knowing more then beasts, he should not hate
As they do, to be treacherous, and ingrate.
These three together being put to feed,
And sport themselves till there were farther need
Of their known faith, together long did dwell
In peace and love, till on a time it fell
That they with rest and ease full fed and fa^,
Had time to play, to dally, and to chat.
Then did the wanton Heart propound a course,
Betwixt himself and the courageous Horse.
The warlike Horse did dare the horned Bull
To make one in the race, who straight way full
Of burning choler, and adusted blood,
Bad cowards run, he for no footman stood.
It Was meet for them that durst not stand it out,
To use their heels, his heart was too too stout.
The angry Heart replies, there is none of you,
But may to me as to your better bow,
I swifter then the Horse, my feet can use,
And for my head, the Bull i will not refuse
To combat with, my courage I am sure
Is like my strength as able to endure,
And do, as either of you dare or can,
And more I am esteemd by royal man.
Those Serpents which you run from, I seek forth,
And tear them with my teeth as nothing worth.
And as my life to man is sweet and pleasing,
So is my death, each part some sorrow easing.
My horns all mortal poison can expel,
My marrow makes stiffe-ioynted misers well.
My fat yields strength and sweetness; that fierce lad
Achilles, never other spoonemeat had.
Which made him such a Captain, every part
Is physical and comfort the heart.
Yea even my excrements the dropsy cures,
My tears, like precious Jewels, man allures.
To seek them up, wheresoever they be shed.
My skin great Captains wear when I am dead;
And boast that they have such a coat of proof,
Which wounds withstands, whence venom stands aloof.
Then why) O baser creatures) dare you brag
And match your selves with the long living Stag?
My life is long, cause I with cost am wrought,
But nature slights your lives, as good for naught.
The crested Horse, with fiery eyes did show,
What inward rage did in his hot blood flgw
To hear this bold speech uttered, and with head
Tossed in the air his hardened hoofes does tread
The scornd earth with contempt, then thus breaks out;
O thou fearful of all the rout
Of hunted beasts, how haps it that you dare
With me your master and your Lord compare?
Forget ye my pre-eminence? the love
Man bears me? how one spirit seems to mo^e
Me and my rider? that we start and run,
Stop, turn, trot, amble, as we were but one?
Have you at any time been called to war,
Where none but Captains and great Soldiers are?
Trusted to hear their Councels? on your back
Borne the Commander of that royal pack?
I have done this and more, borne him about
Through worlds of danger, and then borne him out
He trusts me when his legs he dare not trust,
And when his hand, fail them perform I must.
Nay when he fails himself in every part,
I add another life, another heart.
In war I thus befriend him, in his need,
And so in peace, I help his wants to feed.
I till this land that else would barren be,
Bear all his carriage, and am seldom free
From some imploiment, but must near him stand
As being fit, and apt for his command.
If he to visit friends abroad does fare,
I must along with him, true friends we are.
If he intends to hunt such beasts as you,
For sport, or hate, or need, he lets me know
The time, the place, the end, and we agree^
I see the sport, and hunt as well as he.
How often have I seen some fearful Heart,
Perhaps your ^ire, at my dread presence start;
Fly hence with utmost speed, and never slack
His willing pace, when I upon my back
Bearing my noble master have at length
O'retane the lubber, having lost his strength?
Whilst I still foming courage, breathing sprite,
Have sought another conquest long ere night;
And after that a third, unwearied yet,
Yet you your self as Parallel will set
To match and ouermatch my worth, my force;
As if weak Stags might brave the peerless Horse.
For physical receipts easily yield,
Alive I profit man, you being ^ild,
This makes him seek your death, my life to save,
Yet being dead my parts their virtues have.
Which I refer to others to relate^
As scorning Hog-like to do good so late.
This only I conclude, If man should choose
To save but one, he would both of you refuse.
^sal. 54^
The armed Bull sweld, pu^t and roard alowd,
To hear ^he Heart so bold, the Horse so proud.
And all the while they spoke, he tossed about
With horns and hoofes the dust; then bellowd out
This bolder brave; What ignorance is this,
That causes both of you, so much amis^e
To boast your false worths, and neglect the true,
Which res^s in me, belongs to none of you?
The Wolf, the Greyhound, and ^ach questing cur,
Makes thee poor trembling Heart keep such a stir.
To shift thy layer, as if thy life were lost,
With every faint blast, that the leaves down tost^
And this courageous Horse, that makes a quoile,
Of wounds in war, and tilling o^ the soil,
With many other uses fit for man,
(As they that least can do, best cavil can)
Let this his answer be, the spur and bit
Shows man trusts not his courage, nor his wit.
For if he tire or faint, his spur prouokes,
And pricks him forward, with continual strokes.
And if with headstrong heat, he madly rides,
The bridle curbes him, and his folly guides.
"All voluntary acts the actors praise,
"Not such as others by constraint do raise.
"Out of our natures, whilst we easily are
"Made instruments either of peace, or war^
Else might our horned Herds, the rescue boast
Of Hannibal and his distressed host, Plut^r^ in vita Han.

When he with lights and torches tide to us,
Escapt the trap, of lingering Fabius.
But truth is far from such ostents, those deeds Cunctando restitui^ rem Enniu^

We call our own, which from our choice proceeds.
The yoke we bear, and wherewithal we till
The earth for man, is by constraint, not will^
What comfort from our flesh, or from our Cowes,
By calves, or milk, or Cheese or Butter flows,
Or physical receipts, as they are more,
And vsefuller, then what you both before
Have mentioned, so freely I confess
Man has in them the glory more or less.
His wit and industry, in them is seen,
And the Authors goodness from whom first we been,
War is the good you glory in, which springs
From man's ambitious ignorance, and brings
Wants, woe, and death, with many ills beside,
To scourge us all, through ou^ great masters pride.
Then at the best, you are but slaves to such,
As feeding you, food to their like do grutch.
And through your force, their own reuengements take,
Whilst you to stout men; cowards equal make^
For what from you they borrow, they must grant
They fear their foes enjoy, whilst they do want.
Thus therefore all the nobler nations use
To sight on foot, whilst coward rather choose
To share with beasts in glory, and to get
Themselves a name, through your fool hardy heat.
So you on them, and they on you depend,
Such service judgment never did commend.
And thus in sportiue war, and warlike sport,
You do your rider from himself transport.
Whilst you not man-li^e grow, but beast-like he
Resembles you, in all these sports we see.
Yea often to mischance you do betray
Your heedlesse rider, and in midst of play
Pr^cipitate his soddaine fortune so,
That who has you a fai^nd, shall need no (...)
But may himself, a happy man proclaim,
If by your means he scapes without a maime.
But now if either of you, think you can,
Out of your own worthes, prove more fit for man,
And better able to defend, and guard,
Him whom we serve, from whom we have reward,
Then I can with my horns, and harnast hide,
Proceed to trial, I defy your pride;
And with bold challenge summon you to fight,
A triple combat, to decide the right.
They both with eager appetite accept
These wished conditions, and by this have stepped
For from each other; all prepared do stand
At full carere, to join this treble band.
The field triangle wise they euenly cast,
And each with rage expects, that dreadly blast,
Which warnes them charge. Each roreth out his wrath,
Nor other need of drums or trumpe^s has.
The Heart does bray, the bounding Steed does neigh,
The Bull does bellow, deep, and loud and high.
The earth does tremble, and the air does shun,
This dreadful thunder; as when laden gun
Spits forth its load, in scorn to be restraind,
The air gives way unto the bullets chaind,
As dreading to resist so mighty force,
Thus meet the valiant Bull, the Heart and Horse.
The Heart and Horse first touch tha'ppointed place
Being more swift, and apter for the race.
And let each other, with much dange^ feel
The force of horned head, and armed heel.
But ere a second bout they can perform,
In comes the boystrous Bull, like winters storm,
And seuers them with such a violent push,
That they amazde, turn giddy with the rush.
But (nimble both and active they repay
The sturdie Bull, with all the speed they may.
The Heart with his broadhornes, does make him reel^
But the kind Horse, vpholds him with his heel.
The Bull thanks neither, for the one did pearce
His hollow flank, the other much more fearce,
Did break a rib, and bruise his shoulder blade,
And taught him with less choler to invade.
Yet th'ods is soon recouer'd with his horn,
Which has the belly of the Courser torn.
And rent one weaker beam, from branched Heart,
As trees by thunder riuen, or cloven athwart.
The subtle Heart, then shuns those ruder blows,
And tho'ds of handistrokes too dearly knowes^
The Horse taught by his wounds, does keep aloof,
And stands upon defense, with hardened hoof.
The Bull assaults them both with watchful eye,
And seeks how he advantages may spy.
The Horse and Heart upon their guard do stand,
In doubt and jealousy, on either hand.
The Bull assaults the Heart, but he gives way,
And slips his fury with what slight he may.
Yet turns not head, as fearful cowards will,
But wefes aside, to tire his foe with skill.
The Bull then strikes the Horse a deadly cuff,
But he requites him with a counterbuff.
The Heart strikes in betwixt, the Bull turns rownd,
The Horse leaps right up, does coruet, and bownd;
So at one instant, fatally they me^te;
The Bull his death meets from the Horses feet.
The Heart the advantage takes, the ^orse aloft
Strikes his one horn into his belly soft,
Which there hangs fast; the Horse does with his fall.
Breaks the Hearts neck, this is the end of all
None has the conquest, all of them are slain.
Their deaths not doubted, long they there remain,
Till that the King their Master, having need
Of their attendance, goes his guard to feed,
For none might tend them else, least they acquainted
With others bribes, by treason should be tainted.
So enters he the place, and there he spies
What does affright him, all his comfort lies
Dead at his feet, then sadly going near
Their carrion corpse, he does a murmur hear,
As armed soldiers in a City sound,
Or fire in the air, or wind within the ground.
And doubting the success, three several swarms
He sees prepared for fight, and up in arms.
Bees from the Bull, Waspes from the Hors^ do start,
And Hornets from the melancholy Heart.
He motions peace, and hopes to part the fray,
They send three soldiers, who sends him away.
For each of them does fix his venomd sting,
Wit^in the flesh of the amazed King.
He flies with speed from thence, they fight it out;
The conq^est all expect, all fear and doubt.
But what befell I know not; this I know,
The King cride out aloud. The evils that grow Epimithiu^.

From pride, ambition, and excess of grace,
"Like thanklesse curs, fly in their masters face.
"Beasts will be beasts, do bounty what it can,
"It Is cast away, that's given to worthless man.
O Princes banish faction from the Court,
It sowres all actions, leauens every sport.
And at the last, when it should sweetly close,
From one false friend rises a thousand foes.
FINIS.
