AD LECTOREM.
NOn hic Herculeae sunt cum sudore palestrae;
Nullus Olympiaco in pulvere Ludus iners:
Pro sadore cruor Christi de Corpore manat;
Ardua pro ludo est lucta, rapina, neces.
Scotica bis denis luctata Ecclesia Lustris;
Pene dedit victas, lassa labor, manus.
Duros passa Patres dudum, velut ame Novercas,
Vi premitur; Stygia fraud subacta gemit.
Constitit effraenes contra tumidasque procellas;
Proque Fide steterat, dum stetit ulla fides.
Nusquam cana fides nunc est; jurataque Coeli
Numina, mortales, vinc'la nec ulla ligant.
Credula dum nimis est, fida haec Ecclesia; vana
Spe lusa, and rupto Foedere strata jacet:
Strata tamen non tota jacet, de pulvere surgit;
Auricomum tollet mox supra astra caput.
Ipsa triumphalem currum Crux saeva ministrat;
Sanctorum sanguis fertile semen erit.
Ecce! Sacerdotum turmam Regumque Coronam
Pendentem infami de trabe, Lector, habes.
Cerne oculo, Heroum facies and corpora cernas;
Verba audi, and videas pectora plena Deo,
Hic loquitur Princeps, magno cum Judice, Vates;
Et Juvenes, Vatum spes animosa senum.
Hic Generosa cohors, Miles, Mercator, agelli
Cultor, and Art rudis, spirat ab ore Deum.
Disce immortalem hinc Animam, vitamque futuram;
Nulla est, pro Christo, mors male grata pio.
Pro Christi Crux, est, diademate Laurea; restis,
Faedere pro Sancto, est vitta, monile, decus.
READER
THE LORD in great mercy, having wonderfully and with an outstretched arm,
notwithstanding all the opposition of Satan and earthly Principalities,
redeemed Scotland from the Power and darkness, first of Gentilism, and then of
Antichristianism, by raising of some burning and shining Lights, and other
Instruments fitted for that Work; Whereby the Light of the Glorious Gospel,
from a very small beginning, did increase more and more, until at length,
shining with brightness and heat as the Sun in his strength, it filled the Land
with knowledge, in so much that the name thereof became Jehouah Shammah, the
Lord is there: And having built to Himself a house upon the foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles, not only sufficiently instructed with righteous Laws and
Judgments for Doctrine and Worship; But also provided with all Ordinary
Officers necessary in the Christian Church, and with a form of
Church Government, of his own Institution, distinct from, and without any
prejudice unto the Civil Government of the Kingdom, Whereby the Church of
Scotland, for Soundness of Faith, Purity of Worship, Excellency of Government,
Freedom and Power of the Gospel, beautiful Order and Unity, was not inferior to
any, if not preferable to most of the Reformed Churches, and therefore was
deservedly famous and esteemed amongst them: Having also, for an hundred Years,
from it is first National Establishment, preserved the same from utter
overthrow, notwithstanding the many various and renewed endeavors of men, by
force and fraud, to reduce it unto the same Errors, Ignorance and
Superstitions, wherein it self at first lay buried, and under which others
groaned; And several times revived and restored it, when by it is own Impurity,
Indifferency and Formality it began to decline, or by the Treachery, Subtilty,
or Violence of others it was oppressed; Thereby not only disappointing,
confounding, and many times ruining the Adversaries, and comforting and
strengthening the faithful; But also always rebuilding to Himself a Temple,
the glory whereof did far excel and darken the glory of the former: And having
many times engaged the whole Land to Himself, by several most solemn
Obligations, of voluntary Surrender and Resignation, by frequently renewed
Oaths and Covenants; So that within these few Years past, there were not many
persons of age, of whatever degree, and not so much as one Preaching Minister
in all the Land, who not only did not make public profession of the true
Reformed Religion, but also subject themselves unto the Presbyterial Form of
Church Government and Discipline, and who did not (which we desire to be noted)
for that effect in their own persons swear and subscribe with the hand unto the
Lord, in the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant; In so much, that
as to the public Profession of the Truth, and almost as to the number of
persons, the Church of Scotland was of equal extent with the Nation, and in
that respect, of all other National Churches, did most resemble the old Church
of the Jews: The Lord, I say, having to the conviction and acknowledgement of
our selves and others, done such great things for us, whereof we are glad, the
present Apostasy, whereby Scotland's Bethel is become Bethaven, and the Land
that was sometimes Holiness unto the Lord, is become (alas too Edom-like) the
border of wickedness, and an Aceldama, a Tragical Theater of blood and
persecution, ought to be unto us no less matter of Sorrow, Shame and Fear, then
it is Sin in itself, and Wonder and Amazement unto others. Who can hear our
Covenanted and Kindest Lord, who hates putting away, and defieth us to show
the bill of our Mothers divorcement, who groaneth under our Backslidings, being
pressed therewith as a cart full of sheaves, complaining that He is broken with
our whorish hearts, and therefore declaring that He will be no more our
Husband; nor we His Wife, and that His heart cannot be toward us; But that He
will drive us out of His house, and love us no more, and not cover the lip for
Shame? And in consequence thereof, who can behold the Fathers house, not only
defiled, by turning it into a house of Merchandise and den of thieves, but the
Temple casten down to the ground, and the Adversary in the midst thereof
insultingly and scornfully set up their ensigns for signs of Triumph; And
further, behold the blood of the Saints shed like water, and their flesh given
to be meat to the fowls of the heaven and beasts of the Earth, and not lament
with Jeremiah? Cap. 9:1, 2, 3* ^ Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a
fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
Daughter of my People. Oh that I had in the Wilderness a lodging place of
wayfaring men, that I might leave my People and go from them: For they be all
adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. And they bend their tongue like
their bow for lies: But they are not valiant f^r the Truth upon the Earth* for
they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, says the Lord. And this
will the more appear, not only if we remember the general nature of
Backsliding, which is a very comprehensive Sin, importing less Love, Fear and
Trust in the true God, and proclaiming more Inconstancy, Unfaithfulness, and
ingratitude toward Him, then sometimes is found in very Heathens toward their
Idols; But also if we consider that our present Defection has all
circumstantial Aggravations in the highest degree. For it is not in things only
Civil, Indifferent, or of little moment; But in things Religious, Necessary,
Important and which at least in their tendency and consequence reach to the
very foundation: It is not the effect of common, humane and invincible
infirmity; but most free and voluntary, yea wilful and deliberate: It is not
done by stealth, or in a corner; but avowedly and openly in the sight of the
Sun: It is not Private and Personal; but Representative and Authorized, by Acts
and Proclamations of King, Parliament and Council: It is not smoothly and
subtly, but most tyrannically carried on by military violence and cruelty: It
is not of a few or inconsiderable Persons, but very Universal; The greatest
part of all Ranks, and of some Ranks almost the whole, being some one way or
other involved therein: It is not only of these, who were always of known and
professed disaffection to the Cause and Covenant of God; but also of many who
sometimes being exceeding zealous themselves, and exemplary and forcible
upstirrers of others therein, are now become the chief Ringleaders theirof,
and most bloody Persecuters of those who remain steadfast in the Truth: It is
not in an Heathenish or Antichristian Land, or Church divided and broken with
several Sects, as some others are; but even in Scotland, so clearly
enlightened, for which the Lord had wrought so many wonderful works, which was
under so many obligations of Oaths and Covenants to the contrary, and had been
so united in the profession of the Truth: It is not from violent force,
Inevitable necessity or irresistible temptation (which is neither possible nor
yet would excuse it) but when the Lord, by breaking the yoke of foreign
Usurpation, had given King and Country the fairest opportunity which they ever
had, to restore, confirm and advance His Work; as if He had delivered us, that
we might work all these Abominations: And all this for no other end, then the
base flattering of the Kings humor and inclination, the satiating of
Prelaticall Pride and Ambition, the indulging of the licentious profanity of
some Debauched and degenerated Nobles and others, who could not endure the yoke
of Christ's sound doctrine and impartial discipline, And the suppression of
Religion and Righteousness in the subversion of the late work of Reformation:
Whereby we have charged our selves with all the blood that has been shed upon
either side, during the former wars; Have laid a stumbling block before all,
who shall see or hear of it, to blaspheme Religion as a fiction, to condemn the
late Work of Reformation as a false pretense for Rebellion and Self-Interest,
and to affirm that there is neither truth nor ingenuity in the Professors
thereof. Pass over the Isles of Chittim and see, and send unto Kedar, and
consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing; has a Nation changed
their Gods, which yet are no Gods? But Scotland, Ah Scotland! has changed her
glory for that which does not profit. Be astonished, O ye heavens at this, and
be horribly afraid: And so much the rather, because few Lands did ever make
Defection after this manner, but, as upon the one hand, the Lord gave them up
unto more Backsliding, until they abounded more with Atheism and all manner of
abominations, then some Pagan-Nations, who never heard nor made Profession of
the Gospel; So upon the other hand, He always pursued them with sorest
plagues, not only of subjugation at home, scattering and exile abroad, dividing
of Kingdoms amongst themselves, and from their former Rulers, and final
subversion of whole Empires, Kingdoms and Commonwealths; But also many times
with the Final removal of the Gospel, and utter dissolution of all visible
National Covenant Relation, as might be demonstrated from Holy Scripture, and
other Histories: And indeed, if He, to whom nothing is strange or impossible
(though they may seem both to us) and whose ways and thoughts are as far above
ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth, do not in the Soveraignity of His
Grace, recede from His ordinary method of dealing with such apostatizing
People, and now when he has seen our way do not heal us, we have, alas! ^oo
too just ground of fear, that we shall become such a proverb amongst the
Nations, that the generation to come of our Children, and the stranger that
comes from a far Land, when they see the plagues of this Land, shall wonder
and ask, Wherefore has the Lord done this unto this Land? What means the
heat of this great anger? Oh! that the very first, and next following steps of
Defection; together with the Causes of the Lord's wrath against the Land, were
remembered and acknowledged, and that all who have had any accession to the
kindling of this flame (and who can wholly Justify himself? If any would, be
sure, his own mouth should condemn him) would draw water and pour it out before
the Lord, for quenching thereof, and that the first resiclers from our National
Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to duties, would glorify God by
Confession, that he might turn from the fierceness of his Anger; But alas! He
has at once poured out upon us the Spirit of Whoredom and of a deep sleep!
and has both made us to err from His way, and hardened our hearts from his
fear. And as we should look bekind us to the Rise, so before us to the Result
of th^se things; for though every runner may read the Primum mobile of this
course, the great axletree and wheels upon which all moves, and who are the
furious drivers and slavish drawers thereof, and we have both seen the several
degrees of Motion and advancement, and smarted the sad effects of the same, yet
I am affray'd, that there is now another Spirit in Persons and Tendency in
affairs then some men apprehend. Whether there be a sufficient ground in the
Holy Scriptures to think with some, that before the last fall of the Roman
Antichrist, the Popish Religion shall once more overshadow the Christian World*
is not proper here to enquire; But considering the great affinity betwixt
Papacy and Prelacy, and the already authorized and practiced Conformity of the
one to the other, not only in Government and Discipline, whereby they have, for
the most part, the same Ecclesiastical Courts and Officers; But also in
Worship, whereby they have the same Liturgy, for substance of Epistles,
Gospels, Collects and Letany; The same Ceremonies of Rising, Standing to the
East, Bowing, Kneeling, Crossing, etc. the same superstitious and fool-like
Vestments; The same observation of many days, the same adorning of Churches
and Chapels, with Altars, Books, Candles, Candlesticks, Basins, Images, and
Crucifix's on windows, and the same Jesuitical sign upon their pulpit cloth;
And also in several points of Doctrine, preached, licensed and printed, with
many other things tedious to be enumerated: Considering also the constitution
of the Kingdoms, which by Ignorance, Atheism, disputing and oppugning of the
Authority of the Holy Scriptures, Error, Superstition, Profaneness,
Indifferency, Formality and Hypocrisy in many, are much more then formerly
disposed to embrace whatsoever shall be authorized or indulged: And considering
the native tendency of the present Course of Backsliding, which leads unto
the great Whore, the mother of all these abominations, Nothing but gross,
wilful or judicial Ignorance, and estrangement from affairs, can deny that
there is too just ground of fear, that ere long (if the Lord do not prevent it)
Britain may be again precipitated into the old gulf of Antichristianism. And
so much the rather, because it is universally observed and notourly known, that
the number of professed Papists, has increased more within these six Years,
then it had for near sixty before; the conviction whereof made some of the
Prelates themselves say some Years hence, that since the Year 1660. there were
more thousands of avowed Papists in Scotland (compute then what may and must be
in England and Ireland) then before that Year there were hundreds. Whence this
is, and whether there be any positive Resolution to reintroduce Popery in these
Lands, I do not affirm, but remit it to the consideration of the impartial
Reader who understands the times, and to Time it self, a great searcher and
discoverer of secrets, to declare the genuine meaning and tendency of these
things, That the King should publish in print, that the Papists had been
faithful Subjects to him and his Father, whilst others under pretense of
Religion had involved the Kingdoms in blood; Was that bloody Massacre in
Ireland, whereof they were the known and acknowledged Actors, though perhaps
not the only Authors, such Faithful service? That the execution of penal
Statutes against Papists should be superseded, whilst severe penal Statutes are
daily enacted and executed against Protestants, really, though not under that
name and notion: That so many known and open Idolatrous Masses should be
connived at and tolerated, whilst both public and private meetings of
Protestants for pure Worship are prohibited by Law, and violently interrupted:
That so many known professed Papists, Priests and Jesuits, who do not
publicly countenance the Prelatical Worship, are permitted to live peaceably
and enjoy all their Liberties, whilst non-complying Protestants, for simple
Nonconformity to Prelacy, are imprisoned, fined, confined, scourged,
stigmatized, and many otherwise oppressed and persecuted, in their Estates,
Consciences and Names: That so many Papists especially in England should enjoy
and be daily advanced to the greatest places of public Power and Trust, not
only as members of Parliament, Council, and Court, but as State-Officers,
Lieutenants, Sherifs, Justices of Counties, and Officers in Army, whilst
steadfast Protestants, for simple non-perjuring, are some of them not so much as
permitted to sit in Parliament, or any other Iudicatory; others of them
discourted, disgraced, disarmed, imprisoned and proscribed, and all of them who
will not forswear, declared incapable of public Power or Trust in Church or
Commonwealth: That a house for Fathers or Friars is provided; whilst many
faithful Ministers are removed and chased from place to place, without any
certain habitation: That there should be such universal Report and so much
Presumption, of a Popish hand in burning of London, which, for number and
strength of Protestant Inhabitants, was the most considerable City in the
World, and bulwark against the Romish Religion and designs, and yet, as if men
were affrayed to try the truth in that matter, so little satisfying and
effectual course taken, to try and punish the Authors and Actors, and to
repress their many other insolent misdemeanors; whilst many thousands of
innocent Protestants, who never burnt either house or City, for no other
alleged crime but their peaceable forbearance to bow to the Idol which the
King has setup, are thrown into a furnace of fiery Trial, seven times more
heated then ever was known in the Christian World for such a Cause, all things
being considered.

It may seem strange to the Nations about, and to the Generations following,
that the Church of Scotland which had been so faithful and chaste, should have
suffered herself to be thus prostituted, and that (if she would not otherwise,
after the manner of her Fathers, contend for the Faith which she had received)
she did not cry to all the World by Declarations and Protestations (as the Maid
under the Law) that she was forced; And that of all the sons which she had
brought forth, there were so few, either to take her by the hand, and plead
openly for her, or to plead with her, that she would put away her whoredoms.
This indeed is, and ought to be for a lamentation; But let none therefore
conclude (as some of the profane and perfidious Prelates, measuring others
after their own baseness and treachery, had the impudence at first to
misrepresent to the Rulers) that all were or are consentient unto this horrid
Apostasy; for even at the beginning thereof, if Synods (which were then
resolving to bear public Witness for the then established Government of the
Church, and against the begun Defection, and further progress thereof by the
Reintroduction of Prelacy, which was then designed) had not been, some of them,
by Proclamation prohibited to conveen, and others of them violently interrupted
and raised by Nobles, who, by Order of Parliament, were present for that
effect; And if some of her Watchmen (who were neither professedly driving on,
nor secretly breathing after Prelacy and Prelatical promotion) had not for
Reasons best known to themselves, too much courted and flattered the Powers by
their own silence, and withdrawing of their necessary and required concurrence
in a public joint Testimony, there wanted not Faithfulness, Zeal, Courage,
Resolutions and some Endeavors in others to have emitted such Declarations, as
probably might have crushed the bold attempt of the Prelates in it is infancy,
and thereby have prevented much Sin and Suffering which has ensued thereupon,
and certainly would have witnessed to all the World, that the Church without
and against her consent was treacherously betrayed and violently forced.
Neither has the Truth, all along from that time till this, wanted many
testimonies, though none of them were so National, Universal, Authoritative and
Solemn as they should have been; And few of them (perhaps) so explicit, full,
plain and bold, as the weight of the matter and other circumstances required:
Yea, the continued fears of the Adversaries, expressed in the Narratives of
several of their own Acts and Proclamations, and their leavying of Military
Force, for upholding of them and their Cause; The Non-complyance of many
thousands, their secret and open complaints and moans because of it, and their
daily prayers to God against it, bear witness against this present Course.
Besides, it is very observable, that some, who had been chief Authors and
Active Promoters thereof and Complyers with the same, and others, who had been
intimate familiars and favorers of Prelates and their Vice-curats, in Sickness
and at Death did so much abhor their way and loath their Persons, that they
would not admit their presence, but called for Nonconforming Ministers to
speak to them and pray for them; Yea some Gentlemen upon Deathbed, did with
much sorrow bemoan their own concurrence, and particularly their taking of the
Declaration against the Covenant, and seriously warned and exhorted their old
Familiars and companions in that guilt to repent thereof, wishing they were
able to go and make public profession of their own Repentance; and others
(whilst some friends offered to bring Prelatical men unto them) professed, that
though they had sported with such men in health, yet they durst not do so at
Death; and some Ministers who had conformed, in remorse thereof, forsook that
way, and thereafter died with convincing evidence of Repentance therefore, and
dec^aration against the same: And indeed, as there was never any Course in the
Land, which so visibly had the Voluntary and Active Concurse of all and Only
the Wicked and Profane; so there was never a more Universal concurrence and
Wrestling together by prayer, of all the Godly without Exception, against any
Party and Cause, then now is against this; for there needs no more to make any
man (though formerly their friend and familiar) to hate their way and detest
themselves, but to convince him of his own Sin, make him thoroughly apprehensive
of death and Judgment, and become a sincere seeker of God, and Student of
holiness in his own Person. And further the late Rising in Arms, is an
Argument above contradiction, that Prelacy is ^n outlandish and Unnatural weed
in Scotland; It is true, that it had it is immediate Rise from cruel Oppression,
but it is as true, that all that Oppression, was Authorized by the Rulers,
Exercised by the Soldiers, and endured by the People, merely Because and upon
account of their Faithfulness and Stedfastness in the Covenant and Cause of
God, in a non-complyance with Prelacy, otherwise they might have lived as
quyetly as others, and so soon as they were in a probable Capacity, by renewing
of the Covenant, they declared Actively for that same Cause, for which they had
suffered so much: It is true also, that the Action is condemned by some as
Rebellious, and the Endeavor as Indeliberate, Irrational and Presumputous; But
referring the Reader to the following discourse for full satisfaction
thereanent, I shall only here hint, that being altogether accidentally
occasioned, by an unforseen emergent difference, betwixt 3 or 4 Soldiers and
as many Contrymen, ariseing from horrid Oppression, through unjust Laws and
cruel military execution thereof, without premeditated counsel or contrivance,
it cannot be imagined that all the formalities, which may be judged necessary
in a matter of that nature and importance, could have been in it: And yet it is
presumed, that it wanted nothing but success to have made many of the same
persons account the Action just and necessary, and the Enterprise, laudable and
valorous. And as for the Persons themselves, it may be truly and without all
vanity affirmed. that these many years past, there has not been in Britain
such an other Company of men joined in Arms for the Covenant and Cause of God:
for though where Armies were more numerous, there might be or was the like or
greater number of persons truly Godly; Yet where the whole number was so small,
it will be very hard to parallel so many together, of sound Judgment, true
Piety, Integrity of heart, fervent zeal, and undaunted Resolution and Courage,
and with so small a mixture of persons of corrupt Minds, profane Conversations
and sinistrous Ends: And although we would not be prodigal of men's lives,
especially of Saints, at this time, when there is so great need and scarcity of
intercessors, to stand between the dead and the living; yet that simple act of
Renewing of the Covenant is more glory to God, and a greater Testimony and
Advantage to that buried Covenant and Cause, then (we hope) the loss of so many
men as are fallen, shall import of damage thereunto. But above all, take notice
of the many Sufferings and Sufferers hereafter mentioned, whose Blood under the
altar, and some of whese Heads and Hands standing betwixt Heaven and Earth,
does not only cry for Vengeance, but night and day bear open Witness against
this Adulterous Geaeration. These men's Testimony should have the more weight
and Credit with all, because of the Persons, the Matter, and Manner thereof,
which was not by Wishing, Words-speaking, or Doing without danger, which is the
height of too many men's atchievment in these days, but by BLOOD, whereunto
they resisted striving against Sin, and thereby, being neither affrayed to Act,
nor ashamed to Suffer for their Lord and Master, have left behind them a fair
Example of both to all, and a Reproof to many, whose greater Prudence then
Zeall, has taught them to Save themselves, by couching betwixt the burdens.
That a great Prince, and yet not so Great as Good, an Eminent and more then
ordinarily Useful, and never to be forgotten Instrument of the Work of
Reformation and Patron of the Church, and a True and Seeing Prophet, did fall
in Scotland, when Argile, Wariston and Mr Guthrey, for no other cause but their
Good deeds, and particularly for Loving of our Nation and building of our
Synagogue, were led like Innocent sheep to the Slaughter, nothing but
Ignorance, Malice, Wickedness, or Partiality can deny: for they wanted nothing
to make them Beloved, as they were esteemed and Feared by their Enemies, but
that they neither did nor would, because for Love and awe of God they durst not
with others make Shipwreck of Faith and a Good conscience. Of these three
Mighty men, and Others who by Suffering since have obtained the Crown (though
some of them, being but Countrey-Yeomen, had mean Education, and little other
Learning, th^n what they learned in the Gospel of Him who is meek and Lowly,
and whom the Zeall of his Fathers house did eat up, it is below their due
Commendation, when it is affirmed, That never any men of the greatest Spirits,
Piety and Learning, did Suffer and Die with more Meekness and Patience toward
their Enemies, with more Humility and Confidence toward God, with more
Faithfulness and Stedfastness in the Truth, without the least injurious
reflection thereupon, or their own adherence thereunto, with more Equability and
composure of Spirit, sweetly tempered with the Sorrow's of Sin and Joys of the
Holy Ghost, in assurance of Pardon and Life Everlasting, and with less
perturbation of mind, and alteration of Carriage or Countenance, then these
Worthies did. Here indeed was the Faith and Patience of the Saints, here did
the Lord stand by and strengthen them whom others forsook: Yea the Lord to the
Admiration of all, the conviction of many of their adversaries, the
confirmation and Establishment of the Cause, the Encouragement of many
thousands, His own Eternal Glory, and their Immortal Commendation, did Work in
the hearts of all Beholders, more ample and enduring Epistles of Commendation,
then the most Eloquent and Pathetick Rhetorician can Writ in their Favors.
This account further I will give you of the first ten who died together
December 7. that they once resolved to speak severally to the People at their
death; but therea^^^ considering, that for one Common Cause, and upon the same
alleageances, they were all appointed to die one manner of death, together at
one time and in one place, and having the convenience of being together in the
Prison, they preferred to leave a word jointly behind them in writ: which as it
was the cause of one conjunct Testimony, and some others severally; So the
Foreseing Providence of God in this, is very observable: for had it been
otherwise (seeing they were not at all permitted to speak to the People upon the
scaffold, there had nothing of their joint Testimony been extant, more then is
of these who were not suffered to speak at their death in Glasgow, and of the
rest who Suffered in other places of the West, of whom we have heard nothing
more particularly, but that the same Spirit of Glory and of God resting upon
them, did work in them all* the same Stedfastness, Patience, Humility,
Consolation, Courage and Confidence.

These being the last times, wherein Sin abounds, and the love of many is
waxed cold, I cannot devine what pity shall be showed to them that are in
Misery; especially considering the Universal decay of Religion, and dark cloud
of prejudice and discountenance, whereby the Kingdom of Christ is
overshaddowed, generally the whole world over, and even amongst the Reformed
Churches: Nevertheless, there being a Communion of Saints, which should be
entertained amongst both Persons and Churches, whereby these of the same true
Religion (amongst other things) reciprocally give and receave information of
their common affairs, that, if they can or will express no other act of Love,
they may (at least) the more sutably Sympathize, and mutually pray one for
another; And the Lord in his Providence, giving the opportunity, I thought it
convenient, yea necessary, to communicate the following Deduction of the
Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland for the Kingdom of Christ, hoping, that
as it bears the Name, so, the Wrestling Church of Scotland, in due time shall
reap the Blessing of NAPHTALI, who Genesis 49.21. is called a Hind let loose, and
said to give goodly words: for who can tell, but Her Wrestlings may be
swallowed up of Victory and Liberty, and Her ancient Covenanted Doctrine,
Worship and Government, may become as Pleasant and Acceptable, as it is
Profitable, not only within herself, but also amongst the Churches abroad. This
Title being only affirmative of Her, and not Negative of other Churches, as if
only She, and not also They, had Wrestled for the Kingdom of Christ, let no man
offend thereat: For as the Lord Redeemer has several Offices, equally
Necessary in themselves, and Inseparable by Man, and as particular Churches, as
well as Persons, have their peculiar gifts and Excellencies, and accordingly
their distinct work assigned unto them, whereby (amongst other things) they,
more or less eminently, assert and Propugn this or that particular Truth; So in
this distribution, whereas other Churches have asserted and contended for his
Priestly and Prophetical Offices, the lot seems to have fallen upon
Scotland, to assert and wrestle more eminently then many others, for the Croun
and Kingdom of Jesus Christ. For the establishment of this, did our first
famous Reformers strive by the evidence of Holy Scripture, as well as for
Soundness of Doctrine and Purity of Worship; for Preservation and Restoration
of this, did their Worthy Successors Zealously contend by Petitions, Warnings,
Conferences and Disputations; all Invasion, Usurpation, or the least
encroachment upon this, di^ they valiantly resist by Protestations and
Declinatures; and for a Testimony to this, did they patiently Suffer Bonds,
Imprisonment, Confinement, Sentences of Death, and (of late) Death it self.
Neither should any man think this strange, as if Presbyterial Government were
in itself Unlawful, or the Species of Church Government, were indifferent, and
consequently Contending and Suffering therefore, Unwarrantable or Needless, as
Pretenders to different Forms (upon the right and left hand) would have the
World believe. Hithertil indeed the Church of Scotland has heen as a Speckled
bird, and the birds round about have been against her, She has endured the
scourge of many tongues, as well as the Violence of many hands, upon both hands
false witnesses have laid to her charge, things which she knew not, as being
(amongst other things) too Laxe or too Rigide; Yea as Unnatural Children have
eaten through their Mothers bowels, so Unkindly Brethren have rewarded her evil
for good, Standing on the other side, and looking upon her and her affliction
in the day of her calamity, rejoicing over her in the day of her destruction,
and speaking proudly in the day of her distress, yea laying hands on her
Substance in the day of her calamity. The wrath of man works not the
Righteousness of God, neither does his invincible Truth need the help of humane
Passions, if therefore, such men do not fear, I shall not desire, that their
own tongues may fall upon themselves, and that the Lord may render unto them
according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors,
but rather study the revenge of good will by Prayer, that He would open their
eyes and convert their hearts, that they may take revenge on themselves.
Charity, which thinks no evil, obleegeth to believe, till we see the
contrary, that Scripture, Conscience, Covenant and Credit will make those who
did once laudably assert, constantly propugn and adhere to the Ius Divinum of
Presbyterial Government, until they publish (which none can do) as convinceing
reasons of Retractation and contrary Practice: And whatever might be expected
of others, Religion, Reason, Candor, Gratitude, and Policy would seem to
require, that those who in their distress entreated and obtained the succesful
Assistance of the Covenanted Interest of Scotland, and others, who owe
thereunto whatever they are, or have more then just nothing, debt, or broken
fortunes, should have been so far from cont^mptuous throwing away the Covenant
as an old Alm^nack, when, by it as a stirrup, they had mounted the saddle of
Power, Promotion and Riches, and from subtle dissolving the nerves, or
forcible breaking the Arm of Pre^bytery, that they should rather have said to
both as Ruth to Naom^, Where thou go, I will go; where thou lodgest, I will
lodge; thy People shall be my People, and thy God my God: Where thou die, I
will die, and there will I be buried: God do so to me and more also if ought
but death part thee and me. And it may be truly said, as the Church of Scotland
has had no Detractors, but such as were Ignorant of her, or misinformed about
her, or whom Faction, Partiality, Prejudice, Wickedness or Love of unlawful
Liberty did inspire; So no Person or Party has endeavored hithertil to root
out Presbytery, but the Lord has made it a burdensome stone unto them: And I
am sure, there is no other Form of Church Government can boast of so many
Testimonies by Bl^od as Presbyterial Government might do. But of all
Contradicters, the Church of Scotland, of old and late, has only had to do
(within herself) with Prelatists, some whereof, being high flown, have pleaded
a Jus Divinum, others (Antiquaries) have pleaded Antiquity, and many
Adiaphorists of late, being beaten from both these strengths, have pleaded
Indifferency in general, and only Jus Carolinum, as to this or that Species:
But as no eyes, save their own, neither these except by delusion of their
sense, could ever see Prelacy (that is, an Ordinary Ecclesiastical Ord^r,
Distinct from and Superior to that of a Preaching Presbyter, having the sole
power of Ordination and Jurisdiction) in the Holy Scripture, otherwise then by
Prohibition to Lord it over Gods heritage, or in the example of Diotrephes who
loved Pre-eminence (as many famous writing, whereunto I refer the Reader,
unanswerably demonstrat) and therefore, the Office being a stranger in the Word
of God, rather then the bras^n Serpent which once had Divine Institution,
should be Nehushtan in the Church; So let no man, Exorcist-wise, adjure us by
the Charming words of Antiquity, Primitive times and Bishops, Fathers, etc. For
Moses we know, the Prophets and Apostles we know, but what is Antiquity, and
who are the primitive Bishops and Fathers? Must men be stigmatized, as
giddy-headed Novellists, and as much Athenian in their Principles and
Professions* as other m^n in their News, or then be Implicit
in-tail-following Antiquaries? No, there is a Medium of proving all things, and
holding that which is good: Pure Antiquity deserves all esteem and reverence,
but Simple Antiquity, as such, is neither a certain nor Safe Rule, and much
less oblieging to future times, and so remote as our's are. Our Lord Himself
repelleth that pretense, that it was said of old: Were there not many Errors
and Corruption^ (which themselves will not Justify) as ancient, and early in
the Church (yea more) as Prelacy is alleged to be? We are commanded to the Law
and Testimony, but never to the Fathers, and good reason, because few or none
of them were without gross errors in Judgment or Practice: Are not the
writings of the first Age very few, or obscure? Are not many of these and after
Ages lost or Corrupted? Yea other later writings are deceatfully emitted under
the name of Ancient Times and Persons, so that in such a mist, it is hard to
determine what was written by these Fathers, what not: Later, Corrupt or
Inadvertant writters about these former times, did speak of Persons and things,
under the abused Names which were corruptly used in their own times: And the
writtings of particular Persons (suppose of greatest Antiquity) do rather hold
forth their own private Opinion, or the Practice of the Time and Place wherein
they lived, then the Universal Judgment and Practice of the Church in all Times
and Places. And if they will Sanctuary themselves in primitive Times, let it be
cleared what is meant by Primitive; For if the two first Ages be meant, it is
more then they can do, to prove by sufficient Authority, that there was then
such a Prelacy, as is before mentioned, or now usurped and exercised; If after
ages be meant, wherein the Church grew more corrupt, and Prelacy did aspire and
exalt itself, to an Universal Supremacy in the Bishop of Rome, and
establishment of that Antichristian Hierarchy, then indeed they are like
themselves. for twins were never more like in face, then the present Prelates
resemble the Romish, but then it were Candor in them, to tell plainly, that
Papacy and Prelacy are of one Original, with this difference, that Prelacy is
the first born, or rather the Father which begat the other; And if they mean a
Middle time, betwixt these Periods, wherein indeed Bishops were first known in
the Church, and will reckon their descent from them, why are they so unlike
unto them, that they look neither like Sons nor Successors? Ask those who have
dived into these depths of Antiquity, and they will tell, that a present
Prelat, and a faithful Presbyterian Pastor (or Moderator at most) do little
more differ, then the present Prelates and these first Primitive Bishops: For as
it was long before such a thing was known in the Church, so when through the
Malice and Subtilty of Satan, the Ambition of some Churchmen, the
Unwatchfulness of others, and Indulgence of some Magistrates it did creep in, at
first it was intended and acknowledged for no more, then a Prudential Humane
device for greater Unity (a Cure, because without warrant, worse then the
desease, which, as the Apostles never prescribed in their own times, though
there were then many Divisions, so there is alike Reason to Extend further to
Papal Supremacy, in the case of divisions amongst Prelates and Patriarchs) and
had never the impudence to aspire (with some present Prelates) so high as a Jus
Divinum; At first these Primitive Bishops, being Elected by other Presbyters,
with consent of the people, and not by the Civil Magistrate only, as now the
Prelates are by the Kings Letter to the Dean and Chapter, were Ordained by the
laying on of the hands of Presbyters, and rot of Bishops only, as the Prelates
are; Their Ordination vas not Essentially different from that of Presbyters,
nor to an Order distinct from, and Superior to that of Presbyters or Pastors,
as the Consecration of the Prelates is alleged to be; Neither did they (though
perhaps they had a negative voice) usurp the sole power of Ordination and
Jurisdiction, nor Exerce the Acts thereof, without the potestative Concurrence
of Other Presbyters, as now the Prelates do; Many of them being Holy, Humble,
and Sober in their conversation toward the people and other Presbyters, did nor
(with the present Prelates) assume the lofty Tittles of Lordship, Grace, etc.
Nor live and ride in such state and pomp, claming and taking the preference of
the greatest Peers of the Land; Ordinarily, and especially at the beginning,
they had not such vast charges, as now the Prelates have Diocies over Hundreds
of Pastors, and many Thousands of people, to whom it is utterly impossible to
perform Ministerial duties; Being diligent Preachers themselves, they were not,
as the Prelates are, Idle drons, nor Non-residenrs, nor yet of a strange
language to the people, as Wallace, through his ignorance of the Irish tongue,
and almost of all others except his Mothers, must be a Barbarian to his Diocy
of the Western-Isles* Neither did they involve themselves in Secular affairs
and Offices, then which, what is there more absurd in Reason, and repugnant to
Scriptural precept and Example? For Christ Himself tells us, that his
Kingdom is not of this World, Joh. 18: ver. 38. and how can his Officers be of
it? He refused to be a Judge, Luc. 12: 14. And, speaking to the Disciples of
Civil Authority and Dominion, says, it shall not be So amongst you, Mat. 20:
ver. 25. Luc. 22: ver. 25: And the Apostle. Paul tells us, that Ministerial
weapons are not Carnal. 2 Cor. 10: ver. 4: And that the Ministers of the Gospel
should not entangle themselves with the affairs of this Life 2 Timothy 2: ver. 4:
That the Ministerial calling is so weighty, that the best qualified and most
diligent is not sufficient for it, 2 Cor. 2: ver. 16. how then are they
sufficient for it, and civil affairs too? And therefore they should Wa^ upon
it, Romans 12: ver. 7: and give themselves wholly to it. 1 Timothy 4: ver. 15. and
not wait (as the Prelates do) upon Courts, Parliaments, Council, Convention of
Estats, etc. as members thereof, nor Exerce the office of Provosts, Justices of
peace, etc. Nor will it excuse them, that they commit Ministerial inspection of
the flock to Deputs: For if they be Shepherds, should not the Shepherds feed
the flock? Ezeck. 34: ver. 2. If to them be committed the Ministry, Teaching,
Exhorting, should they not themselves Wait upon these? Romans 12: 7: If they must
give account of Souls, should they not Watch for them? Heb. 13: ver. 17: And if
the Lord will require the flock at their hand. Ezekiel. 34: ver. 10: how will they
answer to God, the people, their own Conscience (if they have any) or to others
who ask a reason of them, for feeding of themselves only, and committing the
flock to Others, and especially to such who are so far from being Learned,
Holy, Apt to teach, Blameless, of a good report, Chaste, Sober, Grave, Lovers of
good men, Meek and Gentle, as the Scripture requires, that many are Novices,
Ignorant, Profane, Light, Given to Wine, False, Covetous, Contentious, Proud,
Passionat, and Self willed, and so far from taking heed to the flock, or being
an Example to them, in Word, Conversation, Charity, Spirit, Faith and Purity,
that they neither take heed to themselves, nor rule their own families well? I
remember that one speaking of such as commit the flock to Vicar-Curats (as all
are who serve under Prelacy) says, Adibunt per Vicarios in Paradisum, in
Persona in Inferos. They shall go to Heaven by their Deputs, but to Hell in
Person. These men (if I may borrow an allusion from the duty and commendation
of faithful and approven Ministers) have taken forth the Precious from the
Vile, and taught the people the difference between the Holy and Profane, and
caused men to discern between the Unclean and the Clean; but mark How, and for
what End? Is it not by making sad the hearts of the Righteous, whom they have
selected, and set up as the Only object of all their Malice and persecution,
and Strengthening the hands of the Wicked, whom they have taken into their
bosom, as their Only Familiars and Confidents. The one they thurst with the
side and shoulder, the other they do not suffer to turn from his evil way, by
promising him life. But if any desire more particular information about them,
amongst other places to that purpose, let them read and consider, Ier. 23.9. to
33. and 5.31. Ezekiel. 34.1. to 11. and 22.25.26.28. Zeph. 3.4, Mal. 2.8.9. Mat.
23. and (as face answers to face in water) they shall see their Call,
Qualities, Doctrine, Conversation, Works and Influence amongst the people, and
the Effects of all, together with their righteous Doom and Reward. He has
already made Contemptible and Base before the people, those who have corrupted
the Covenant of Levy, and being partial in the Law, have made many to stumble
thereat, and will he not cause to cease from feeding of the flock, those who
feed themselves, eat the fat and cloth with the wool, but do not (for indeed
they cannot) strengthen the deseas^d, heall the sick, bind up that which i^
broken, bring back that which is driven away, nor seek that which is lost? They
have not only turned his house of Prayer into a den of Thieves, but from them
is profanness gone forth over all the Land, and seeing they deserve no more
honorable Exit, will he not scourge out of his Temple, those who have sold
Faith and a good Conscience for a mease of pottage? Yea seeing He has said it,
we will believe, that He will make the false Prophet and the Unclean Spirit
pass out of the Land, and that these men shall bear the Wounds or marks of
False Prophets, and for shame shall deny (for lies are their ordinary refuge)
that ^ever they were prophets, And that Others, perhaps their nearest
Relations, the Fathers and Mothers who begat them, shall so little esteem,
regard or Pity them, that they shall account them unworthy to live ( Ye shall
not Live) And that He will again gather those that are now sorrowful for the
solemn Assemblies, that he will search for the flock, seek that which was lost,
bring back that which was driven away, bind up that which was broken, and
strengthen that which was sick, by the hand of Pastors after his own Heart,
who, under and after the Example of the great shepherd DAVID, shall feed them
in a good pasture with Wisdom and Understanding. To all this, as well as the
Curse upon them who make the blind to wander out of the way, let all the People
say, Amen.

Neither are they who plead an Indifferency of Forms of Government, more
Scriptural or Rational then the Former: for it seems equally absurd and
incosinstant with the Faithfulness of J. Christ, who was faithful to Him who
appointed him; With the Lords way of dealing with the Jewish Church, whereunto
he prescribed a Specifical and Fixed Form of Government; And with the
Perfection and Plainness of the Holy Scriptures, wherein all Church Assemblies,
Officers, Powers, Acts, and who should Exerce the same, and every other thing
necessarily belonging thereunto, which the Light of Nature does not teach, and
is not common to it with Civil Government and Order, are clearly held forth,
Expressly or by necessary Consequence, in Special or General directions and
warrantable Examples (as appears by the many debats Extant thereanent) to
leave the Government of his Church Indifferent, and Arbitrarily determinable
and alterable, according to the will of the Civil Magistrate, or the various
and mutable humors and Inclinations of Persons, Times and Places, or the
pretended convenience of Civil Policy, as to leave Doctrine and Worship thus
Indifferent, and arbitrarily determinable and variable, according to these
crooked and changable rules: If Church Government must be Indifferent, and thus
arbitrarily determinable and Ambulatory, because the Holy Scripturs do not
Expressly affirm, that Presbyterial Government is the Only Government, which
should be in the Christian Church, and also Expressly declare, that it is
Unalterable to the worlds end, and that the first Institution and Practice
thereof, by the Apostles and their Successors in the Ministry, never was nor
shall be Repealed, why may not the Civil Magistrate, or any other arrogating a
power of Instituting or Altering Church Government or Officers, by Parity of
reason, make many other Necessary and Practical points of Faith, which are not
more Expressly declared by the Holy Scriptures to be Unalterable Truths, then
Presbyterial Government is (though all be evident enough) to be also
Indifferent, and arbitrarily determinable and mutable? and then farewell
Infant Baptism, Women's receaving of the Lords* Supper, and observation of the
first day of the week for the Christian Sabbath, yea, farewell Law and
Testimony, and more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we should go and take
heed; and for a new Rule of Faith and Practice, welcome Humane Prudence,
State Policy, Corrupt and Changable Disposition of man, and pretended Necessity
or Convenience of State, Time and Place; yea welcome all Doctrins and
Practices, which though they were once positively prohibited, can allege that
the Scripture does not Expressly declare, that they never were nor shall be
repealed. And where are we then? In vain is the Law, in vain is the pen of the
Scribe, and every one, without transgression, may do what seems good in his
own eyes, if only he can Temporize, and offend not the Civil Magistrate, by
violation of his Arbitrary Institutions and Laws in Church aff^i^s, wherein he
must be Supreme. O my soul, come not into the secrets of such Latitudinarian,
or rather (in this) Nullifidian Adiaphorists. We would not be here mistaken, as
if we denied to the Civil Magistrate any Power, which the Holy Scriptures allow
unto Him; for as we assert his Office to be an Ordinance of God, and his Person
(being lawfully therewith vested) to be signally impressed with a special
Character of Majestic Authority, wherefore, in a due Subordination to Him who
is Lord over all, He should be subjected to and obeyed; So we cheerfully grant,
that, whereas the Heathen Magistrate (because of his Moral incapacity to Exerce
more power) about Religion and Ecclesiastical affairs, has only a Power in
Actu signa^o and ^us ad rem, the Christian Magistrate has Ius in re, and in
Actu Exercito may and should by his Laws establish the true Religion within
his dominions, and command his Subjects to make public profession thereof;
That by his Civil Sanction he may and should Ratify Ecclesiastical Sentences,
aggreeable to the Word of God; That anent these he may and should Exercise an
Antecedent Discretive Judgment, whereby he may not add an Implicit
approbation; That for Preaching and Propagation of the Gospel, and for nursing
of Piety and Learning, he may and should provide Necessary and Convenient
accommodation and encouragement, as to Persons, Places and Revenues; That for
his own Information and Advice, he may call Occasional Meetings of Church
Officers and others, to Confer and Debate matters before him; That Pro r^ nata
he may Convocate Ecclesiastical Synods, to reason and conclude Church affairs
according to the Scripture; That for his own Information, and for preventing of
Outward Force and Inward Confusion, he may be Present therein by Himself or his
Delegats; That by his Power he may and should Defend and Encourage the Church,
in the free and peaceable Possession of all her Intrinsecall Privileges, and
all the Members thereof, in the Profession and Practice of the same; That by
the same Authority he may and should repress Error, Heresy, Superstition,
Atheism, Blasphemy and Profanness, and Punish the Authors and Spreaders
thereof; That in case of negligence, he may Command all, and even Ministers, to
per^orme their r^spective duties in general, as necessity requires; And that
for Civil transgressions, he may Civilly puni^h Eccl^siastical Persons, as well
as other Subjects, according to the Law of God and Righteous Laws of the Land:
The Zealous discharge of all which, we would thankfully acknowledge to God and
Man, as the Faithful performance of that gracious Promise, that Kings shall be
the Churches nursing ^athe^s. But if discontented herewith, as if all this,
together with the Weighty affairs of the Common wealth, were too little work
for his Transcendent Power and Abilities, and as if Jesus Christ had no Kingdom
or Government, or these were not distinct from the Kingdoms and Government of
the World, or though they were, as if he were equally Head and Fountain of
both, He will needs a^bitrarily Institut or Alter, the Species of Church
Government; Authorize, Exauthorise or Restrain Church Officers, in the Exercise
of the Power of Order or Jurisdiction, in whole or in part, as the Parliament
and Council have prohibited some Hundreds the whole Exercise of their
Ministry, and the High Commission (which claims no power, but what is solely
and immediately derived from the King) has deprived some from the Office, and
interdicted Others the administration of the Lords Supper; If he will Define
Articles of Faith, and prescribe what heads of Doctrine, Ministers shall treat
or not treat of in their Sermons, as the King has done in his printed Letter
to the Bishop of York; And thereupon Primarily, Immediately, and Antecedently to
any Judgment of the Church, which is the Pillar of Truth, and to which the
Spirits of the Prophets are Subject, Cognosce and Determine of Ministers
Doctrine, when the Church herself is willing and ready to try the Spirits; And
Criminally or Capitally punish them therefore, under the pretense of Treason
and Rebellion, as several instances can be adduced against King and Council in
the series of our Church; If he will Ordain particular Church Censurs to to be
executed against particular persons, for particular definite Ecclesiastical
(alleged) offenses, leaving nothing undone by Himself in person, but the
Execution of what he has appointed, As the Parliament has appointed
Suspension and Deprivation of Ministers, for not observing the Bishops
meetings, and the King in his Commission to the High Commission has appointed
Excommunication, whereas they may as well Immediately Suspend, Deprive and
Excommunicat themselves, as Appoint them to be executed in the manner specified
in the said Act of Parliament and Commission; If after the example of
Antichristian or Pagan Nations, he will Institut and Enjoin Needless, Vain,
Superstitious, Significant and Burdensome Rits in the Worship of God, as most
of the Imposed Ceremonies in the Lyturgy, can be instructed be; If he will
arrogate the Sole Power of convocating Ecclesiastical Synods, which is an
Intrinsecall privilege of the Church, whereof She was in Possession three
hundred years before there was a Christian Magistrate in the world Authorizing
it; And will Imprison, Confine, Condemn, and Banish Ministers, for pleading and
Practicing this Right, as King James did not a few in and about the Year 1606.
and the Present King of late, by Parliament, Council and Commissioner, did
interdict all the Lawful Assemblies of the Church, which did not derive their
Power from the Abjured and Perjured Prelates; and if he will not only claim the
only power of indicting ^^lemn Fasts and Thanksgivings, as de Facto is done
these ^or 6 years past, but also institute a day to be Aniversarily ^oly for
ever, which no mortal man can do; If, I say, (...) will thus Invade the Kingdom
of Christ, confound it (...) the Kingdoms of the World, and equally Exerce the
^overnments of both, no man needs pronounce, but rather fear the Domestical
and Personal doom, Executed upon Saul and Uzziah for usurping the Priests
office. How in ^quall dealing is it, that He who clamoureth so much of other
men, and particularly Ministers wandering without their sphere, and
overstretching-meddling with Civil affairs, should himself be Circumscribed and
move within no Fixed sphere? Is it not enough that He have a Power Objectively
Ecclesiastical, about Church affairs, but he must also have a Power Formally
Ecclesiastical, whereby he may Exerce Acts purely Spiritual, and proper to
Church Officers? Will it not suffice him, that he have an External Power, of
providing for the Church, and protecting of her from Outward Violence or Inward
Disorder, but he must also have an Internal power, of Doctrine, Government, and
Discipline, and the several Forms and Acts thereof? Is is not Sufficent that he
have an Imperat Power, whereby He may command all his Subjects, as such, to do
their respective duties; but he must also have and Elicit power, whereby he may
at least materially or equivalently Exerce Spiritual Acts in his own person?
Will it not please him, that he have a Civil Power of Punishing Church
Officers, as Subjects, for Civil transgressions, but he must also have a
Spiritual Power of Censuring them for Ecclesiastical offenses? Will it not
content him that he have a Secundary Power of Judicial Approbation or
Condemnation of what the Church has already found and declared to be Truth or
Error, but he must also have a Primary and Immediate Power of Cognition of Truth
and Error, Antecedent to any Judgment of the Church thereanent? Will it not
satisfy him, that he have a Discretive Power, whereby he may not Implicitly
Ratify Ecclesiastical Sentences, but he must also have a Definitive Power of
Authoritative Decision? And in a word, is it not enough, that he have a
Cumulative Power of Confirming and Strengthening the Power and Privileges of
the Church, but he must als^ have a Privative Power, whereby (if he please) he
may destroy the same?

That the Lord has had, and to the Worlds end will have a Church, none who
believe the Authority of the Holy ^criptures can deny or question; And that he
has fixed Discriminative boundaries between his own and the Kingdoms of the
Earth (that is, between his Church and other Civil Societies, and their
respective Governments) is no less evident: For though both consist of Men, and
sometimes of the same Persons; though both have Order and Government; a Power
to Exercise the same, and that Derived from God; and the Persons invested
therewith should be qualified; and in the Exercise thereof should walk
Absolutely by the Rule of the Word; Punishing and Censuring after clear
Conviction by Confession or Probation; And should Ultimatly aim at the Glory
of God, and Good of the People; and for that effect be mutually subservient and
useful one to another (in these, amongst other things, they aggree) Yet they
are Formally distinct: For they consist of men under distinct Notions and
Relations; Civil Society and Policy is founded upon the Light and Law of
Nature, Ecclesiastical by Revealed Positive precept; The one is Common to all
men as Men, the other is Peculiar to those who profess the True God; The Form
of the one may be Monarchical, the other not; The object of the one is Civil,
the other is Spiritual; The Nature of the one and Manner of Exerceing it, is
Magisterial, the Other Ministerial; The Acts and Sentences of the one are
Corporal, the other Spiritual; The Immediate Rule of Exerceing the one is the
^awes of the Land; and the other the Word of God and ^cclesiastical
Constitutions aggreeable thereunto; The one ^s performed in the Name of the
Supreme Magistrate, the other in the Name of Jesus Christ; The Immediate End of
the one is the Good of the Commonwealth, the other the Good of Souls. Yea
though the Church and Commonwealth of the Jews, of all others that ever were,
did most aggree, yet were they Formally distinct: for they had ordinarily
distinct Rulers, the Priest and Levits for the one, Judges and King's for the
other; They had distinct Acts Sacrificing, praying etc. in the Church, Death,
Banishment, Confiscation, Inprisonment, Ezra 2:26. in the State; They had
distinct Objects, the Matters of the Lord and the Matters of the King, 2 Chronicles.
19.11; Distinct Laws, the Ceremonial for the Church, the Judicial for the
Commonwealth, and the Moral for both; They had sometimes distinct Members,
when these of the One, were not admitted to some Privileges of the Other; The
Form of the State did alter from Judges to Kings, but the Churches was
unalterably the same; And they had their distinct Periods of Duration, for the
Church continued (though corrupt) after the Civil Government was overturned by
the Romans.

And as the Church and State of the Jews were in these things distinct, so had
they their distinct Governments, and Judicatories for Exer^^ing the same
Respectively; For Exo. 24.1. there are 70. Elders, who v. 14. appear to be
vested with Authority, and to have Aaron and Hur for their Presidents or
Moderators; now these 70 Elders cannot be the 70, who Numb. 11. shared of the
Government with Moses, for these mentioned Exodus 24. were in Authority when the
Israelits were at Sinai, whereas the other mentioned Numb. 11. were chosen
after they went from Sinai; neither can they be any other 70 in Civil
Authority, because before the Election of those Numb. 11. Moses was alone in
the Government. Again Deuteronomy. 17. there are distinct causes, viz. Blood and
Blood, plea and plea, which were Civil, and Stroke and Stroke, which (whether
it was Leprosy) belonged to the Priests to Judge of; Lev. 13.3; Distinct
Rulers. viz. the Priests the Levets, and the Judge, who v. 11. are
distinguished by the disjunctive particle Or; Distinct Acts of telling (or
exponing) the Sentence of the Law, and of telling Judgment v. 10.11, and
distinct Penalties, of Death, and putting the Evil from Israel, v 12. Further
in ^ Chr. 23.4. Ye will find 6000 of the Levites who were Officers and Judges,
which must needs have been in Ecclesiastical affairs, because, 1 Chronicles. 28:1.
there were Princes of Tribs, Captains of Thousands, Hundreds, Stewarts and
Officers, for Civil affairs. And, 2 Chronicles. 19:8, etc. there are Church
Officers, Priests, Levits, chief of the Fathers; there are distinct Matters,
the Matters of the Lord and the Matters of the King. Ver. 11. There are
distinct Acts or Sentences, for Warning not to trespass is more proper to
Ecclesiastical then Civil Persons; And there are distinct Moderators or
Presidents, Amariah is over you for the Matt^rs of the Lord, and Zebadiah for
the Matters of the King. Now what should all this mean, viz. Distinct causes,
and Persons set over them to Judge them respectively, and what means these
distinct Acts, Sentences and Penalties, if not to hold out the Distinction of
Government, and of Judica^ories respectively exercing the same? Yea that was in
the Old Testament, we may know by what we read in the New, for Matthew. 21: ver.
23. and 27: ver. 1. and 26: v. 3, 57, 59. Act. 4: v. 5, 6, 15. and 5: v. 21,
27. there are Assemblies and Councils, which must needs be Ecclesiastical: not
only because they consisted of Ecclesiastical persons, the High Priest, Cheef
Priests and Elders of the People; Cognosced of Ecclesiastical Causes, the life,
Doctrine and Authority of Christ and his Apostles; And past Ecclesiastical
Sentences about preching in the Name of Christ, Act. 4, and 5. But also because
(the Jews being subdued) the Supreme civil Government was taken out of their
hands, and little left them but the Ecclesiastical. And if at any time, in the
Old Testament, the same persons were members of both Judicatories, it was under
distinct Notions and considerations, as Ecclesiastical in the one, and Civil in
the Other; As now the Ruling Elder, under several Considerations and
Capacities, may be a member of an Ecclesiastical and Civil Iudicatory. It is
true that the High Priests and some Kings had great hand in both Civil and
Ecclesiastical affairs, but Extraordinary, and (may be) Typical instances are
not an Ordinary and Universal Rule; And it may be also, that in the New
Testament these Councils meddled in Civil Affairs, for Matthew. 27: ver. 1. they
take counsel against Jesus to put him to death, but that was by Corrupt Abuse
of their Power, which crept in, in the declining State of the Church, and when
the Civil Government was taken from them by strangers, or when, wanting a
Magistrate, they took more upon them then at another time; for it was not so
from the beginning, and was by the like Corrupt and Extravagant Abuse, as now
the High Commission (if it be an Ecclesiastical Courr) does Scourge,
Stigmatize, Fine and Banish, or the Prelates now as Members of Parliament,
Council, and Session, make themselves Judges of Blood, Pleas, etc. And as this
was the Manner and Difference of the Jewish Church and State under the Old
Testament, so under the New Testament, there is by Divine Institution, a Formal
and Specifical Difference, between the Government of the Church and
Commonwealth: For ye will not only find Office-bearers Given unto, and Set in
the Church. Romans 12: ver. 8. 1 Cor. 12: ver. 28. Ephesians. 4: ver. 11. Which are
as well Distinct from Office-bearers of the State as from the People, for
neither Magistrate nor People were ever called Apostles, Prophets* Evangelists,
etc. especially in the Apostles sense; But also RULERS, distinct from the
Rulers of the Commonwealth, who 1 Thessalonians. 5: ver. 12. are Over the People, and
Hebr. 13: ver. 17. Rule over them. Now these Rulers cannot be the Magistrate,
for in none of the places does the Apostle Intend or Mention him. Besides, at
that time there was not a Christian Magistrate to Rule the State, and how should
the Rule of the Church be committed to a Pagan? And 1 Timothy 5: ver. 17. He that
Labors in Word and Doctrine, seems to have more Honor, then He who Rules,
which, if either Magistrate or Prelate be the Ruler, how they will Relish, and
that the poor preaching Presbyter should be more Honored then they, let any
man Judge. Here then are Ecclesiastical Rulers, distinct from these of the
Commonwealth. To these Rulers belongs the Cognition of Ecclesiastical
Offenses, in Contradistinction to Civil Causes and Judges; Matthew. 18. -- Tell
the Church: Now the Civil Magistrate cannot be this Church, where is He ever so
termed? Or how will He, (being himself a Heathen) account another man so: Here
then is a Church distinct from the Commonwealth; here are Church-Offences
distinct from Breaches of Civil or Municipall Laws; here is Church-Delation or
Complaint, distinct from any complaint to the Magistrate, tell the Church; and
consequently, here is a Church Power of Cognition of these Offenses, distinct
from that which resids in the Magistrate, else it were in vain to tell the
Church, and as good or better to tell the Magistrate; And here is a
Church-Sentence, Let him be unto thee as a Heathen, which the Magistrate, being
then Heathen himself, would never pronounce against, or inflict as a Punishment
upon another man. To these Church-Rulers also is committed not only the Power
of Order, or Pastoral Administration of Word and Sacraments, but also the
Power of Jurisdiction, whether Dogmatical, Diatacticall, Critical, or
Exusiastical, and not to the Civil Magistrate; And accordingly Jesus Christ,
gives the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to Peter and not to Caesar Mat.
16.19: Ye will find Church Assemblies, distinct from Parliaments, Convention of
Est^ts, Senats, etc. (yea when the Magistrate was an Enemy) determining
questioned Matters of Faith and Practice, Act. 15: The Apostle Paul enjoineth
the Church of Corinth and not the Magistrate, both to Excommunicat and Absolve
the Incestuous man, 1 Cor. 5.4.5. and 2 Cor. 2.7.8: The same Apostle leaves
Titus and not the Magistrate to Ordain Elders in Every City. Tit. 1. v. 5; and
accordingly it is performed by the Presbytery, and not by the Magistrate, 1 Timothy
4.14: The Apostle John thereateneth by Himself and not by the civil Magistrate,
to Censure Diotrephes, 3. John 10. And as the Power it self, and the several
Acts thereof are Committed to Church Officers; So to them and not to the Civil
Magistrate, are all the Directions given for Regulation of the Exercise thereof,
distinct from the Directions given to the Magistat for Regulation of the
affairs of the Commonwealth: and so in the case of Offense, there must be
private rebuke before Public delation, Mat. 18:15, 16, 17. In the case of
Public Scandal, there must be a Rebuking before all, 1 Timothy 5:20: In the case
of Public Censure, there must be Notoriety of the Fault 1 Cor. 5.1. or
sufficient conviction of the Person, by Confession or Probation, Mat. 18.15; In
the case of Excommunication, it must be when the Church is gathered together, 1
Cor. 5.4. and not (after the Prelatical fashion) in a corner; In the case of
Absolution, there must be sufficient evidence of Repentance, 2 Cor. 2.7; In the
case of Ordination of Ministers, there must be the Election of the People, Act.
6.3, 4, 5. Trial, 1. Tim. 3:10. and laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 Timothy 4.14. and they must be Fixed to particular flocks, Tit. 1.5. How distinct
are these, and all other Directions given to Church Officers for Regulation
thereof, from the directions given to the civil Magistrate for Regulation of
the Commonwealth? And the Church Officers, and not the civil Magistrate, are
Commended or Discommended according as they faithfully or unfaithfully Exerce
this Power and follow these Directions: So the Angel of the Church of Ephesus
(which I hope none will say was the Magistrate) is commended for Trying them
which said they were Apostles and were not, Revel 2.2. It was not the Emperor,
Senate, etc. that tried these false Apostles, as of late the Parliament,
Council, High Commission, ejected many Hundreds of faithful Ministers without
Trial; The Angels of the Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira are discommended,
for tollerating false Doctrine and Corrupt Practice, v. 14.15.20. so is the
Church of Corinth blamed for not timeous Excommunicating of the Incestuous
Person. 1 Cor. 5. For the like Ommissions which are reproved in these Angels, I
know them who now deserve a sharper censure, sed quod defertur non aufertur.

From all which, as the Formal and Specifical Difference betwixt the Power and
Government of Church and Common wealth is abundantly evident; So Jesus Christ
Himself, and not the civil Magistrate, is the Author and Fountain of
Church Power and Government; Then which, there can be nothing more clear to
them who do not wilfully shut their own eyes, or whom the God of this world
has not blinded: For, besides that Himself tells us, that He has received
all Power and Judgment from the Father, Mat. 28. ver. 18. John. 5.22. and John
bears him that Testimony. John 3.35. And who should derive Power to others,
but He who received it for that end? Let us consider his Name and Relation to
the Church; In what Relation he stands to the Commonwealth or civil
Magistrate, I do not here i^quire, but the Apostle tells us, that He^, and not
the civil Magistrate, is Head of the Church Ephesians. 1.22. and 5: 13. and, as
such, he does not only Mystically communicate inward Grace to the members, but
Occonomically derive Power and Direction for the Outward Regulation of the
whole body. How then can the Magistrate be Head of the Church, or supreme
Governor in all causes Ecclesiastical? Must the Church have two Heads, or a
Head above a Head? Why may not a Church Officer or Officers, as well claim
(with the Pope) to be Head of the Commonwealth? Will they show us a Warrant
from Scripture or Reason for the one, which will not as strongly plead for the
other? Well then, let Christ be still Head of the Church. And as such. Ye will
find Him, and not the civil Magistrate, Instituting all Church-Ordinances for
Administration of Word and Sacraments, Mat. 28:19. 1 Cor. 11:23. for
Excommunication and Absolution, Matt. 18:17, 18. and all other Acts of
Government and Discipline: Ye will find Him, and not the civil Magistrate.
Instituting Church-Offices; He it is who gave, Ephesians. 4:11. and set in the
Church, 1 Cor. 12: v. 28. Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Teachers, etc. And
who is he that dare alter by addition or diminution? Ye will find Him, and not
the civil Magistrate, Authorizing these Officers to Exerce the Several Acts of
the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, Mat. 28:19: Ye will find Him, and not the
civil Magistrate, Furnishing these Church Officers, with Gifts and Graces for
their work; as none goes here upon their own Expenses, so can any Magistrate
breath the Holy Ghost, as Christ did upon his Apostles? Ioh. 20.22? In His
Name, and not in name of the Magistrate, must they perform all Church-Acts;
they must Assemble, Mat. 18:20. Baptize, Mat. 28:19. Excommunicat, 1 Cor. 5:
ver. 4. and do all in His Name: He, and not the Magistrate, makes Laws
Absolutely and Primarily oblieging to the Church and Church Officers, and
therefore is He called the Lawgiver, Isai. 33:22. Iam. 4:12: He, and not the
civil Magistrate, will call Church-Rulers to their final Account; An Account
they must give, Hebr. 13:17. and to whom but to Him that gave them Commission,
and is Judge? Isai. 33:22: And in recognition of all this, the Apostle Paul
acknowledges that the Lord Jesus, and not the civil Magistrate, Gives
Ministerial Power and Authority, 2 Cor. 10:8. and 2 Cor. 13, 10: And because of
this, they are called the Ministers of Christ, 1 Cor. 4: 1. and Ambassaders for
Christ, 2 Cor. 5:20. and not of, or for the Magistrate, as now the King terms
the Prelates Our Bishops: His Servants they are, and therefore should not be
Pleasers of Man, nor of the Magistrate, Gal. 1:10. as they ought to be, if he
gave them Commission: If the Magistrate, as such, be Head of the Church, and
Fountain of Church Power and Government, I would gladly know, how or whence the
Apostles, their Successors and others in the Ministry, had power to Teach or
Govern the Church, when there was no Christian Magistrate to derive Power to
them? Or whether they had any Power at all, or were but Usurpers? Or what the
Church shall do for Power when the Magistrate is Heathen, Antichristian, or a
Woman, Child, a Fooll, a Tyrant, or Heretic, etc. Shall the Church all this
time want a Head? Or shall the Body of Christ, have a Pagan-Head? Shall a
Woman, who must not speak in the Church, be Head of the Church? shall a child
or Idiot, who cannot Govern themselves, have the External Regulation of the
Church? Or shall Cruel Tyrants, who oppress or destroy the Commonwealth, and
Bodies of men, have the Regulation of the Church, and of the Souls of men? We
may then go to the Pope, the Turk, the wild Indian-Infidels and Savages, for a
Head to the Church before She want; for what^ver belongs to one man, as a
Magistrate, belongs to all Magistrates: But we will hold us content with the
Head, Jesus Christ, which the Father has given us.

Now from this, that Church Power and Government are thus distinct from the
Civil, and that Jesus Christ and not the Magistrate, is Author and Fountain
thereof, it evidently follows, that it is not Subordinat to the Magitrat. It
is true, that the Magistrate has much Power Objectively Ecclesiastical, and
that Church Officers, as Subjects, are subject to him; yet Ecclesiastical Power
itself, is not Properly Subordinat to the Civil. This will the more appear,
not only because it is not Derived from the Magistrate, as the Head or Fountain
thereof, nor is Exerced in his Name, but also if we consider, that Proper
Subordination, is only in things flowing from the same Fountain, and of the
same Nature, whereas civil and Eccesiasticall Powers are neither from the same
Immediate Fountain (if the one be from Jehovah Essentially considered, and as
great Lord Creator and Gubernator of the World, the other from the Lord
Redeemer, Head and King of his Church) nor yet are they of the same, but
different Natures, as is said before: Again, if it were properly Subordinat to
the civil Power, then the Magistrate himself, might Exerce all Ecclesiastical
Acts, in the Administration of Word and Sacraments, as well as of Jurisdiction;
for as nor ason can be adduced, why He may Institute or Alter Church Government
or Officers, or Exerce the External Regulation thereof, which will not by
parity of strength infer his Exercing Acts of Order; So, every Superior Power
including all the Inferior. He may as well Exerce all Ecclesiastical Power, as
civil, if the One be Subordinat to the Other: And further, the Magistrate
himself, as a Christian, is but a Member of the Church, and Subject to
Church Government and Discipline, though it should not be practiced, except for
most weighty Causes, in great necessity, and with singular Prudence, and all
due Respect and Reverence to Civil Authority, and the Person therewith vest^d;
and accordingly many Magistrates have been censured: Yea in some cases, as if
the Magistrate should unjustly forbid to Preach, Baptize, Ordain, Deprive,
Excommunicat etc. the Church may Exerce Church Power without and against His
consent, which She could not do, if it were Subordinat to him. I know there are
many clamours of the Absurdity and Inconsistency of two Collateral and
Co-Ordinat Supreme Powers and Governments in one Kingdom; And indeed that
Absurdity and Inconsistency may hold true, of two Supreme Collateral and
Co-Ordinat Powers ejusdem Generis, but not in this case where they are diversi
generis: Yea of their own Natures, they are so far from being hurtful, that,
being rightly managed, they are singularly helpful to one another: Neither
can these two Powers and Governments in a Land, import now under the New
Testament greater absurdity and Inconsistancy, then under the Old, when the
Jews had their Ecclesiastical Sanedrin, as well as civil Courts for the
affairs of the Commounwealth. Hence also it follows, that as Ecclesiastical
Power is not Subject to the civil; So, in matters Ecclesiastical, there should
be no Appellation from the Church to the civil Magistrate: For though when
Church Judicatories, without their sphere, meddle in civil Causes as such, or,
for Ecclesiastical offenses, inflict civil Punishments, they may be Declined as
Judges Incompetent in the one case, and complaint of an unjust or Heterogeneous
Sentence is lawful in the other; and though the Magistrate, before He add his
Ratification, may require a Reason of Ecclesiastical proceedings, or, in case
of an injust Sentence, may desire the Church to consider the matter again; and
the Church i^ bound thus to give a Reason, or Consider the matter, especially
in a degenerat or declining time of the Church, when more is permitted to the
Faithful Magistrate, then otherwise; Yet there can be no Appellation from the
Church to the Magistrate in Ecclesiastical Causes and Sentences: Not only
because all Appellations are from the Inferior to the Superior in Eodem genere,
but the Church and State are not such, as is cleared before; but also because
the Church is endued with Complete Power of Cognoscing and Final determining
Ecclesiastical affairs, without dependence upon the State, and these
Determinations, being Just, the Lord has promised to Ratify, Mat. 18:18. And
the Magistrate, having no Formal Church Power, cannot pronounce Ecclesiastical
Sentence, or make Redress by Himself, and so the Appellation is in vain. Paul's
Appealing to Caesar, Act. 25:11. will not help this weak cause; For He did not
appeal in an Ecclesiastical cause, from an Ecclesiastical Court, to a Court of
another Nature, but in a matter of alleged Sedition, from Festus an Inferior
Magistrate to Caesar the Supreme. Neither is the Instance of Jeremy stronger
then the former ( Ier. 26:8.9. etc) for there is no mention of His appealing
from the Priests to the Magistrate, but of his Apology before the Princes, who
came to hear the matter, and their Voluntary delivering him from the Unjust
persecution of the Priests and Prophets, who were not competent Judges of Life
and Death. Neither is the Exception of the Difference betwixt a Heathen and
Christian Magistrate more Valid in this matter; for (besides all that is before
said) in the old Testament, the Government of the Church was Committed to
Church Officers, even when the Magistrate was Religious, and why not in the New?
The Government of the Church is not committed to them, because the Magistrate is
Heathen, or upon Temporary, but upon other Moral and Immutable grounds, and
therefore should not be taken from them when he becomes Christian: It is sure,
that the Church had power given unto Her to Govern Herself, when the Magistrate
was Heathen, now when and where is that Power Repealed? If Church-Govenment
belong to the Christian Magistrate, then it is either as Magistrate or as
Christian, if as Magistrate or as Christian, then (according to the known
maxim) it belongs to Every Magistrate, and so to the Heathen, and to Every
Christian, both which are false: Was the Magistrate no Magistrate or Incomplete,
when (being Heathen) he did not meddle with Church Government? or did the
Church Usurp and Rob the Heathen Magistrate of that Power, in the Apostles
days, and 2 or 300 years after? Shall the Church, by the promise of Nursing
Fathers, have less Power and Privilege, or be in worse Condition, by a
Christian then Heathen Magistrate? And how vain i^ the Distinction of Outward
Regulation of the Church, and Inward, (for that must be the other term) for
the Inward Regulation thereof belongs incontrovertibly to Jesus Christ, and if
the Magistrate has the Outward, what is left to the Church? These things,
which, had they been formally digested, would have been more clear and
convincing, are only thus confusedly and abruptly hi^ted: nor should I have
said so much, if (besides the Erastian Spirit, which, more then ever, does now
rage) some Parliamentary and Council-Expressions, and aggreeable practices, had
not given occasion. Whether it be Primitive or not, let the Reader Judge, but
sure I am, the Kings Government of the Church and State; Charles, etc. Supreme
Governor in all causes as well Ecclesiastical as Civil; The Bishops serving
the King in the Church, is neither Scriptural nor Safe Dialect. Him they may
serve, and Whether or How, Time will tell; but well know I, whom they do not
ser^e in the Church: and indeed it is proper, that they who are there, only by
the Will of Man, should only serve Man. His Commissioners they are, and
accordingly Sharp has deposed some Ministers by Virtue of the Power which he
has from his Majesty, and therefore they can expect no greater Assistance,
Blessing or Reward then he can give; But yet there is a great^r to whom they
must give an Account.

Having (beyond my first intention) detained Thee longer, then perhaps was
Necessary, or will be Profitable or Pleasant, Thou may now speak with the
Deduction, which is of age, and able to answer for itself, if according to the
Patience, Learning and Justice of many, thou do not Refute and condemn before
thou know it; or brandish big words, as he who upon a Coronation-day, offers
duel to all who question the Kings Right, when he knows, that (for Major
Vis) none dare appear in the contrary. But in the passing take a word of the
National Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, and Solemn Acknowledgment of
Sins and Engagement unto Duties, that at one view, thou may see Scotlands
Engagements and Breaches, the Faithfulness of many, and flood of Sin and
Suffering that has overflowed the Land: Here is the Terminus a Quo and ad Quem
of our Backsliding, whereof, though the most skilled Artist cannot pourtray to
the life the whole body (the form is so monstrous and Complexion so strange)
he may well darkly represent some Lineaments of fingers and toes, that the
reader may know Ex ungue leon^m; yet the Author has nervously asserted the
Truth, and drawn matters of Fact, with such True Colors, that he can only be
accused for a Picture fairer then the live-face of many Persons and Actions. To
wind up all, be not discouraged upon the one hand nor insult upon the other,
by the Death of many Mighty men of God, Co-workers and Eye witnesses of his
Work, within these few years past, and the stripling-stature of many survivers,
who have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of their Fathers,
and (being but of yesterday) can know little of the Lords ancient kindness to
the Land, except what their Fathers have told them: For as he has reserved a
numerous remnant of Holy, Learned, and Faithful men, a rich cluster wherein
there is a blessing, and we have reason to bless Him who gave not our Church
dry breasts and a miscarrying womb; so he can make the barren bear seven, and
become a Joyful mother of many Children, and as he has work for them, will
raise up both Shepherds and Principal men. It is true, alas! there is grown up
a most degenerat Offspring of all Qualities, some whereof (and not the
meanest) being as profane as Machiavel, who teaches Rulers to keep promise and
Oath no longer, then with pretended advantage they can break, and that it is a
prejudice to be Really Religious, but not so honest as He, who notwithstanding
affirms a Necessity of Seeming to be Religious, which they are not, account
no man to be a Man, who, by Whoring, Swearing, Drinking and Spending all or
more then they have, do not class themselves into their new Profane Orders, and
become as Cartesian in their Religion, by Atheistical doubtings and disputings
about God, the Holy Scripturs, Heaven, Hell, etc. as others are in their
Philosophy. But here is an Advantage, that by Discovery, and distinguishing
betwixt the precious and the vile, the Lord has made this Defection contribut
more to the Facility (as well as Necessity) of a future Purgation of the
Church, then all her Judicatures could ever effectuat without it. And further,
as he has frustrated many chief Authors and Promotters thereof of their Hopes
and Designs, and called Nobles, Prelates and others to an account before they
well tasted the expected sweetness, or were warm in their Places or Promotions;
So though Herod and Pilat may aggrie against the Innocent, yet where men are
like Samsons foxes, only tied together by the tail of common Corrupt
Principles, whilst their heads, of Self Interest and designs, look different
ways, what such a Position, Conjunction and Aspect prognosticateth, let
Scripture, Reason and Experience be consulted and they will tell. Let us not,
in the meantime, mistake Gods Work, Ways, Doings nor Intentions, neither be
envyous at evil doers, nor yet be Curious nor Anxious about futuritions, much
less limit the Holy one, to Means, Method or Time, but bear the Indignation of
the Lord because we have sinned, till he plead our cause, waiting upon him who
is a God of Judgment, and waits that he may be gracious, and in patience
possess our souls, for (though we do not) he knows his own thoughts toward
us, it may be they are thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give an expected
end, and that (when he has ripened Deliverance) he will bring us forth to the
Light, and we shall behold his Righteousness. It is a crime of the highest
nature with our Rulers, to complain or supplicat for redress, Others are either
of deaf ears or feeble hands and cannot help, and seeing we can do no more for
the Cause and Covenant of God, for our Mother Church, the Land, Ourselves, Our
Brethren and Posterity, let us open our cause to him who tries the Righteous.
O Lord Hear, O Lord Forgive, O Lord hearken and do: Defer not for thine own
sake, O my God: For thy City and thy People are called by thy Name, AMEN.

The Testimony of MR JAMES WOOD, Minister of the Gospel, and Professor of
Theology in the University of S. Andrews, for Presbyterial Government.
I MR JAMES WOOD, being now shortly (by appearance) to render up my Spirit to
the Lord, find my self obliged to leave a word behind me, for my just
Vindication before the World. It has been said of me, that I have (in word at
least) reseiled from my wonted Zeal for Presbyterial Government, expressing my
self concerning it, as if it were a matter not to be accounted of, and that no
man should trouble himself in the matter and practice thereof. It is true,
being under sickness, I have some times said, I was taken up with weightier
matters, then any external ordinance, and what wonder I said so? being under
such wrestling an^nt my interest in Jesus Christ, which is a matter of for
greater concernment. Surely any Christian in this Church that knows me, will
judge there is a wrong done to me: For since the day that the Lord convinced my
heart (which was by a strong hand) that it was the Ordinance of God, appointed
by Jesus Christ, for governing and ordering his visible Church, I never had the
least change of thoughts, concerning the necessity of it, nor of the necessity
of the use of it. And now I declare before God and the World, that I account so
of it still: And that however there be some more precious ordinances, yet that
this is so precious, that a true Christian is obliged to lay down his life for
the profession thereof, if the Lord shall see it meet to put him to the trial.
And for my self, if I were to live, I would account it my glory, to seal this
word of my testimony with my blood. Of this my declaration, I take God, Angels
and Men to be my witnesses, and have subscribed thi^ presents with my hand, the
2 of March 1664. about 7 hours afternoon, before Mr William Tullidaf and Mr
John Carstairs, my Brother in Law, and John Pitcarn, writer hereof.

MR JAMES WOOD.


AS the Matter of this Testimony is very considerable, especially from so Great
a man as Mr Wood was; So the occasion and consequents thereof are very
observable, which were thus: Mr Sharp, having formerly been intimately familiar
with Mr Wood, came to visit him under his Sickness (whereunto Sharps Apostasy
had no small accession) and thereafter did falsely spread a report by word and
writ, that Mr Wood had reseiled from Presbyterial Government. Whereof when Mr
Wood was informed, he was of new grievously affected and afflicted, and
thereupon, for his own Vindication, left this Testimony behind him. But Mr
Sharp finding himself thereby made a publlck liar, (making lies still his
refuge) pursues Mr Wood being dead, as well as alive, with a new slander,
alleging his Testimony to be Fictitious, or Extorted from him, when, through
distemper of his sickness, he knew not what he did, and thereupon caused
summond the Witnesses* the Writter and some other persons before the High
Commission: But the contrary of this was and is most Evident, not only because
this Testimony was written and subscribed, a considerable number of days
before his Death, dureing which intervall (as before) he was so composed, that
he spoke many gracious words about his own soul, Ordered his Civil affairs, and
a famous Physician was not without hopes of his Recovery; But also because,
hearing that some of his faithful Brethren and Co-Presbyters were in the town,
he sent once and again for them, and before them, and some other Ministers at
other times, purged himself of that unjust Imputation, and did bear witness for
Presbyterial Government more fully and freely then is in the written Testimony,
and some time thereafter, of his own accord did call for the Writter, and
(there being none other present in the chamber at the beginning) did indite and
cause him writ the same, as it now is without any Alteration; as also in a
Letter written some considerable time before, (inviting Mr Carstairs to come
and visit him) he had made mention of the Backsliding, Trials and Sufferings
of the times, and expressed his desire to Live, that he might give a more free
Testimony to the Truth. Notwithstanding all which, Mr Sharp (obstructing the
reading of a Letter written by Mr Carstairs to the Chancellor, containing and
clearing the matter of fact) persisted with great Attestations before the High
Commission, in his former false alleagance, and Slandering both of the Dead and
the Living, and caused imprison the Writer and one of the witnesses, and forced
the other (whom, for his eminent Parts, Holiness and Faithfulness, he most
pursued) to a Retirement for his own safety. What shall be given to Thee O
Sharp! Or what shall be done to Thee; O false Tongue? Sharp arrows of the
Mighty and Coals of Juniper.

The National Covenant, OR The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of Scotland,
subscribed at first by the Kings Majesty and his Household, in the year 1580.
Thereafter, by Persons of all ranks, in the year 1581, By ordinance of the
Lords of the Secret Council, and Acts of the general Assembly. Subscribed
again by all sorts of Persons in the Year 1590, By a new Ordinance of
Council, at the desire of the General Assembly: With a General Band for
maintenance of the true Religion and the Kings Person. And now subscribed in
the Year 1638. By Us, Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and
Commons, then under-subscribing: Together, with our resolution and promises for
the causes after specified, To maintain the said true Religion, and the Kings
Majesty, according to the Confession foresaid, and Acts of Parliament. And now,
upon the Supplication of the General Assembly to His Majesty's high
Commissioner, and the Lords of his Majesty's Honorable Privy Council,
subscribed again in the Year 1639. by Ordinance of Council, and Act of General
Assembly. The Tenor whereof here follows.
WE All, and every one of Us underwritten, Protest, that, after long and due
Examination of our own Consciences, in matters of true and false Religion, We
are now thoroughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God; and
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with
our hands, and constantly affirm before God, and the whole Word, that this
only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing
Salvation to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by
the preaching of the blessed Evangel, and received, believed, and defended, by
many and sundry notable Kirks and Realms, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland,
the Kings Majesty, and three estates of this Realm, as Gods eternal Truth,
and only ground of our Salvation: as more particularly is expressed in the
Confession of our Faith, stablished, and publicly confirmed by sundry Acts of
Parliament, and now of a long time has been openly professed by the Kings
Majesty, and whole body of this Realm both in Burgh and Land. To the which
Confession and form of Religion, we willingly agree in our consciences in all
points, as unto Gods undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded only upon his
written Word. And therefore, we abhor and detest all contrary Religion, and
Doctrine: But chiefly, all kind of Papistry, in general and particular heads,
even as they are now damned and confuted by the Word of God, and Kirk of
Scotland: but in special we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that
Roman Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civil
Magistrate, and conscience of men, All his tyrannous laws made upon
indifferent things against our Christian liberty, His erroneous Doctrine,
against the sufficiency of the written Word, the perfection of the Law, the
office of Christ, and his blessed Evangel. His corrupted Doctrine concerning
original sin, our natural inability and rebellion to Gods Law, our
Justification by faith only, our imperfect Sanctification and obedience to the
Law, the nature, number and use of the Holy Sacraments. His five bastard
Sacraments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and false Doctrine, added to the
ministration of the true Sacraments without the Word of God. His cruel
judgment against Infants departing without the Sacrament: his absolute
necessity of Baptism: his blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, or real
presence of Christ's body in the Elements, and receiving of the same by the
wicked, or bodies of men. His dispensations with solemn Oaths, Perjuries, and
degrees of Marriage forbidden in the Word: his cruelty against the innocent
divorced: his divellish Mass: his blasphemous Priesthood: his profane
Sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick: his Canonization of men,
calling upon Angels or Saints departed, worshipping of Imagery, Relicts, and
Crosses, dedicating of Kirks, Altars, Days, Vows to creatures; his Purgatory,
Prayers for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange language, with his
Processions and blasphemous Letany, and multitude of Advocates or Mediators:
his manifold Orders, Auricular Confession: his desperate and uncertain
Repentance; his general and doubtsome Faith; his satisfactions of men for their
sins: his Justification by works, opus operatum, works of Supererogation,
Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations, and Stations: his holy water, baptising of
Bells, conjuring of Spirits, crossing, saning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing
of GODS good creatures, with the superstitious opinion joined therewith: his
Worldly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarchy: his three solemn vows, with all his
shavelings of sundry sorts, his erroneous and bloody decrees made at Trent,
with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruel and bloody Band, conjured
against the Kirk of GOD: and finally, we detest all his vain Allegories,
Rites, Signs and Traditions, brought in the Kirk, without or against the Word
of GOD, and Doctrine of this true reformed Kirk, to the which we join
ourselves willingly, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion, Discipline, and use of the
Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the same, in Christ our Head: promising
and swearing by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, that we shall continue in
the obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the
same according to our vocation and Power, all the days of our lives, under the
pains contained in the Law, and danger both of Body and Soul, in the day of
GODS fearful Judgment: And seeing that many are stirred up by Satan, and that
Roman Antichrist, to promise, swear, subscribe, and for a time use the Holy
Sacraments in the Kirk deceitfully against their own Consciences, minding
thereby, first, under the external cloak of Religion, to corrupt and subvert
secretly GODS true Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may
serve, to become open enemies and persecutors of the same, under vain hope of
the Popes dispensation, devised against the Word of GOD, to his greater
confusion, and their double condemnation in the day of the LORD JESUS.

We, therefore, willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such
double dealing with GOD and his Kirk, Protest, and call The Searcher of all
hearts for witness, that Our minds and hearts, do fully agree with this our
Confession, Promise, Oath and Subscription, so that We are not moved for any
wordly respect, but are persuaded only in our Consciences, through the
knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the Holy
Spirit, as we shall answer to him in the day, when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed. And because we perceave that the quietness and stability of
our Religion and Kirk, does depend upon the safety and good behavior of the
Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable Instrument of Gods mercy, granted to this
Country, for the maintaining of this Kirk, and ministration of Justice amongst
us, we protest and promise with our hearts under the same Oath, Hand-writ, and
Pains, that we shall defend his Person and Authority, with our goods, bodies
and lives, in the defense of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our Country,
ministration of Justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within
this Realm, or without, as we desire our GOD to be a strong and merciful
defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: To
whom with the Father. and the Holy Spirit, be all Honor and Glory Eternally.

Like as many Acts of Parliament not only in general do abrogate, annull, and
rescind all Laws, Statutes, Acts, Constitutions, Canons, civil or municipall,
with all other Ordinances and practique penalties whatsoever, made in prejudice
of the true Religion and Professors thereof; Or, of the true Kirk-discipline,
jurisdiction, and freedom thereof; Or in favors of Idolatry and Superstition;
Or of the Papisticall Kirk: As Act. 3. Act. 13. Parl. 1. Act. 23. Parl. 11.
Act. 114. Parl. 12. of King James the sixth, That Papistry and Superstition may
be utterly suppressed according to the intention of the Acts of Parliament
repeated in the 5. Act. Parl. 20. K James 6. And to that end they ordain all
Papists and Priests to be punished by manifold Civil and Ecclesiastical pains,
as adversaries to Gods true Religion, preached and by Law established within
this Realm, Act. 24. Parl. 11. K. James 6. as common enemies to all Christian
government, Act. 18. Parl. 16. K. James 6. as rebellers and gainstanders of our
Sovereign Lords Authority, Act. 47. Parl. 3. K. James 6. and as Idolaters.
Act. 104. Parl. 7. K. James 6. but also in particular (by and atcour the
Confession of Faith) do abolish and condemn the Popes Authority and
Jurisdiction out of this Land, and ordain the maintainers thereof to be
punished, Act 2. Parl. 1. Act 51. Part. 3. Act 106. Parl. 7. Act 114. Parl. 12.
K. James 6. do condemn the Popes erroneous doctrine, or any other erroneous
doctrine repugnant to any of the Articles of the true and Christian religion
publicly preached, and by law established in this Realm: And ordaines the
spreaders and makers of Books or Libels, or Letters, or writs of that nature to
be punished, Act 46. Parl. 3. Act 106. Parl. 7. Act 24. Parl. 11. K. James 6.
do condemn all Baptism conform to the Popes Kirk and the Idolarry of the
Mass, and ordaines all sayers, wilful hearers, and concealers of the Mass,
the maintainers and resetters of the Priests, Jesuits, traffiquing Papists, to
be punished without any exception or restriction, Act 5. Parl. 1. Act. 120.
Parl. 12. Act. 164. Parl. 13. Act. 193. Parl. 14. Act. 1. Parl. 19. Act. 5.
Parl. 20. K. James 6. do condemn all erroneous books and writtes containing
erroneous doctrine against the Religion presently professed, or containing
superstitious Rites and Ceremonies Papisticall, whereby the people are greatly
abused, and ordaines the home-bringers of them to be punished, Act 25. Parl.
11. K. James 6. do condemn the monuments and dregs of bygone Idolatry; as
going to the Crosses, observing the Feastivall days of Saints, and such other
superstitious and Papisticall Rites, to the dishonor of GOD, contempt of true
Religion, and fostering of great error among the people, and ordaines the
users of them to be punished for the second fault as Idolaters, Act 104. Parl.
7. K. James 6.

Like as many Acts of Parliament are conceaved for maintenance of GODS true and
Christian Religion, and the purity thereof in Doctrine and Sacraments of the
true Church of God, the liberty and freedom thereof, in her National, Synodal
Assemblies, Presbyteries, Sessions, Policy, Discipline and Jurisdiction
thereof, as that purity of Religion and liberty of the Church was used,
professed, exercised, preached and confessed according to the reformation of
Religion in this Realm. As for instance, The 99. Act. Parl. 7. Act. 23. Parl.
11. Act. 114. Parl. 12. Act. 160. Parl. 13. of King James 6. Ratified by the 4.
Act. of King Charles. So that the 6. Act. Parl. 1. and 68. Act. Parl. 6. of
King James 6. in the Year of God 1579. declares the Ministers of the blessed
Evangel, whom GOD of his mercy had raised up, or hereafter should raise,
agreeing with them that then lived in Doctrine, and Administration of the
Sacraments, and the People that professed Christ, as he was then offered in the
Evangel, and does communicate with the Holy Sacraments, (as in the reformed
Kirk's of this Realm they were publicly administrat) according to the
Confession of Faith, to be the true and Holy Kirk of Christ Jesus within this
Realm, and decerns and declares all and sundry, who either gainsayes the Word
of the Evangel, received and approved, as the heads of the Confession of Faith,
professed in Parliament, in the Year of God 1560. specified also in the first
Parliament of King James 6. and ratified in this present Parliament, more
particularly do specify, or that refuses the administration of the Holy
Sacraments, as they were then ministrated, to be to members of the said Kirk
within this Realm, and true Religion, presently professed, so long as they
keep themselves so divided from the society of Christ's body: And the subsequent
Act. 69. Parl. 6. of K. James 6. declares, That there is none other Face of
Kirk, nor other Face of Religion, then was presently at that time, by the
Favor of GOD established within this Realm, which therefore is ever styled,
Gods true Religion, Christ's true Religion, the true and Christian Religion, and
a perfect Religion, Which by manifold acts of Parliament, all within this
realm are bound to subscribe the articles thereof, the Confession of Faith, to
recant all doctrine and errors, repugnant to any of the said Articles, Act. 4.
and 9. Parl. 1. Act. 45.46.47. Parl. 3. Act 71. Parl. 6. Act 106. Parl. 7. Act
24. Parl. 11. Act 123. Parl. 12. Act 194. and 197. Parl. 14. of K. James 6. And
all Magistrates, Sherifs, etc. on the one part are ordained to search,
apprehend, and punish all contraveeners; For instance, Act 5. Parl. 1. Act 104.
Parl. 7. Act 25. Par. 11. K. James 6. And that notwithstanding of the Kings
Majesty's licenses on the contrary, which are discharged and declared to be of
no force in so far as they tend in any ways, to the prejudice and hinder of
the execution of the Acts of Parliament against Papists and adversaries of true
Religion, Act. 106. Parl. 7. K. James 6. On the other part in the 47. Act.
Parl. 3. K. James 6. It is declared and ordained, seeing the cause of Gods true
Religion, and his highness Authority are so joined, as the hurt of the one is
common to both: and that none shall be reputed as loyal and faithful subjects
to our Sovereign Lord, or his Authority, but be punishable as rebellers and
gainstanders of the same, who shall not give their Confession, and make their
profession of the said true Religion, and that they who after defection shall
give the Confession of their Faith of new, they shall promise to continue
therein in time coming, to maintain our Souveraigne Lords Authority, and at
the uttermost of their power to fortify, assist, and maintain the true
Preachers and Professors of Christ's Evangel, against whatsoever enemies and
gainestanders of the same: and namely (against all such of whatsoever nation,
estate, or degree they be of) that have joined, and bound themselves, or have
assisted, or assists to set forward, and execute the cruel decrees of Trent,
contrary to the Preachers and true Professors of the Word of God, which is
repeated word by word in the Article of Pacification at Perth the 23 of
Februar. 1572. approved by Parliament the last of Aprile 1573. Ratified in
Parliament 1587. and related, Act 123. Parl. 12. of K. James 6. with this
addition, that they are bound to resist all treasonable uproars and hostilities
raised against the true Religion, the Kings Majesty, and the true Professors.

Like as all Liedges are bound to maintain the King Majesty's Royal Person*
and Authority, the Authority of Parliaments, without the which neither any
laws or lawful judicatories can be established. Act 130. Act. 131. Parl. 8. K.
James 6. and the subjects Liberties, who ought only to live and be governed by
the Kings laws, the common laws of this Realm allanerly, Act 48. Parl. 3. K.
James the first. Act. 79. Parl 6. K. James the 4. repeated in the Act 13 1.
Parl. 8. K. James 6. Which if they be innovated or prejudged, the commission
anent the union of the two Kingdoms of Scotland and England, which is the sole
Act of the 17. Parl. of K. James 6. declares such confusion would ensue, as
this Realm could be no more a free Monarchy, because by the fundamental
laws, ancient privileges, offices and liberties of this Kingdom, not only
the Princely Authority of his Majesty's Royal descent has been these many ages
maintained, but also the peoples security of their Lands, livings, rights,
offices, liberties, and dignities preserved, and therefore for the preservatien
of the said true Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this Kingdom, it is statute
by the 8. Act Parl. 1. repeated in the 99. Act Parl. 7. Ratified in the 23. Act
Parl. 11. and 114. Act Parl. 12. of K. James 6. and 4. Act of K. Charles. That
all Kings and Princes at their Coronation and reception of their Princely
Authority, shall make their faithful promise by their solemn oath in the
presence of the Eternal God, that, enduring the whole time of their lives, they
shall serve the same Eternal God to the uttermost of their power, according as
he has required in his most Holy Word, contained in the old and new Testament.
And according to the same Word shall maintain the true Religion of Christ
Jesus, the preaching of his Holy Word, the due and right ministration of the
Sacraments now received and preached within this Realm (according to the
Confession of Faith immediately preceding) and shall abolish and gainstand all
false Religion contrary to the same, and shall rule the people committed to
their charge, according to the will and command of God, revealed in his
foresaid Word, and according to the laudable Laws and Constitutions received
in this Realm, no ways repugnant to the said will of the Eternal God; and
shall procure, to the uttermost of their power, to the Kirk of God, and whole
Christian people, true and perfect peace in all time coming: and that they
shall be careful to root out of their Empire all Heretics, and enemies to the
true worship of God, who shall be convicted by the true Kirk of God, of the
foresaid crimes, which was also observed by his Majesty, at his Coronation in
Edinburgh 1633. as maybe seen in the order of the Coronation.

In obedience to the Commandment of GOD, conform to the practice of the godly
in former times, and according to the laudable example of our Worthy and
Religious Progenitors, and of many yet living amongst us, which was warranted
also by act of Council, commanding a general band to be made and subscribed by
his Majesty's subjects, of all ranks, for two causes: One was, For defending
the true Religion, as it was then reformed, and is expressed in the Confession
of Faith abovewritten, and a former large Confession established by sundry acts
of lawful general assemblies, and of Parliament, unto which it has relation,
set down in public Catechismes, and which had been for many years with a
blessing from Heaven preached, and professed in this Kirk and Kingdom, as Gods
undoubted truth, grounded only upon his written Word. The other cause was, for
maintaining the Kings Majesty, His Person, and Estate: the true worship of GOD
and the Kings authority, being so straightly joined, as that they had the same
Friends, and common enemies, and did stand and fall together. And finally,
being convinced in our minds, and confessing with our mouths, that the
present and succeeding generations in this Land, are bound to keep the foresaid
national Oath and Subscription inviolable, We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Burgesses, Ministers and Commons under subscribing, considering diverse times
before and especially at this time, the danger of the true reformed Religion,
of the Kings honor, and of the public peace of the Kingdom: By the manifold
innovations and evils generally contained, and particularly mentioned in our
late supplications, complaints, and protestations, Do hereby profess, and
before God, his Angels, and the World solemnly declare, That, with our whole
hearts we agree and resolve, all the days of our life, constantly to adhere
unto, and to defend the foresaid true Religion, and (forbearing the practice of
all novations, already introduced in the matters of the worship of GOD, or
approbation of the corruptions of the public Government of the Kirk, or civil
places and power of Kirk-men, till they be tried and allowed in free
assemblies, and in Parliaments) to labor by all means lawful to recover the
purity and liberty of the Gospel, as it was stablished and professed before the
foresaid Novations: and because, after due examination, we plainly perceave,
and undoubtedly believe, that the Innovations and evils contained in our
Supplications, Complaints, and Protestations have no warrant of the Word of
God, are contrary to the Articles of the Foresaid Confessions, to the intention
and meaning of the blessed reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above
written Acts of Parliament, and do sensibly tend to the re-establishing of the
Popish Religion and Tyranny, and to the subversion and ruin of the true
Reformed Religion, and of our Liberties, Laws and Estates, We also declare,
that the Foresaid Confessions are to be interpreted, and ought to be understood
of the Foresaid novations and evils, no less then if every one of them had
been expressed in the Foresaid confessions, and that we are obliged to detest
and abhor them amongst other particular heads of Papistry abjured therein.
And therefore from the knowledge and consciences of our duty to God, to our
King and Country, without any wordly respect or inducement, so far as humane
infirmity will suffer, wishing a further measure of the grace of God for this
effect, We promise, and swear by the Great Name of the Lord our GOD, to
continue in the Profession and Obedience of the Foresaid Religion: That we
shall defend the same, and resist all these contrary errors and corruptions,
according to our vocation, and to the uttermost of that power that GOD has put
in our hands, all the days of our life: and in like manner with the same
heart, we declare before GOD and Men, That we have no intention nor desire to
attempt any thing that may turn to the dishonor of GOD, or to the diminution
of the Kings greatness and authority: But on the contrary, we promise and
swear, that we shall, to the uttermost of our power, with our means and
lives, stand to the defense of our dread Sovereign, the Kings Majesty, his
Person, and Authority, in the defense and preservation of the foresaid true
Religion, Liberties and Laws of the Kingdom: As also to the mutual defense
and assistance, every one of us of another in the same cause of maintaining the
true Religion and his Majesty's Authority, with our best counsel, our bodies,
means, and whole power, against all sorts of persons whatsoever. So that
whatsoever shall be done to the least of us for that cause, shall be taken as
done to us all in genearal, and to every one of us in particular. And that we
shall neither directly nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided or
withdrawn by whatsoever suggestion, allurement, or terror from this blessed
and loyal Conjunction, nor shall cast in any let or impediment, that may stay
or hinder any such resolution as by common consent shall be found to conduce
for so good ends. But on the contrary, shall by all lawful means labor to
further and promove the same, and if any such dangerous and divisive motion be
made to us by Word or Writ, We, and every one of us, shall either suppress it,
or if need be shall incontinent make the same known, that it may be timeously
obviated: neither do we fear the foul aspersions of rebellion, combination, or
what else our adversaries from their craft and malice would put upon us, seeing
what we do is so well warranted, and arises from an unfeined desire to
maintain the true worship of God, the Majesty of our King, and peace of the
Kingdom, for the common happiness of our selves, and the posterity. And
because we cannot look for a blessing from God upon our proceedings, except
with our Profession and Subscription we join such a life and conversation, as
beseems Christians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; We, therefore,
faithfully promise, for our selves, our followers, and all other under us, both
in public, in our particular families, and personal carriage, to endeavor to
keep our selves within the bounds of Christian liberty, and and to be good
examples to others of all Godliness, Soberness, and Righteousness, and of
every duty we owe to God and Man, And that this our Union and Conjunction may
be observed without violation, we call the living GOD, the Searcher of our
Hearts to witness, who knows this to be our sincere Desire, and unfeigned
Resolution, as we shall answer to JESUS CHRIST, in the great day, and under
the pain of Gods everlasting wrath. and of infamy, and loss of all honor and
respect in this World, Most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his
holy Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires and proceedings with a
happy success, that Religion and Righteousness may flourish in the Land, to
the glory of GOD, the honor of King, and peace and comfort of us all. In
witness whereof we have subscribed with our hands all the premises, etc.

The Article of this Covenant, which was at the first Subscription, referred to
the determination of the General Assembly, being determined, and thereby the 5
Articles of Perth, the Government of the Kirk by Bishops, the Civil places and
Power of Kirkment, upon the reasons and grounds contained in the Acts of the
General Assembly, declared to be unlawful within this Kirk, we subscribe
according to the determination foresaid.

A Solemn League and Covenant For Reformation, and Defense of Religion, The
Honor and Happiness of the King, and the Peace and Safety of the three
Kingdoms of Scotland, England, and Ireland.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the
Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of Scotland, England and
Ireland, by the providence of GOD living under one King, and being of one
reformed Religion, Having before our eyes the glory of GOD, and the advancement
of the Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Honor and Happiness
of the Kings Majesty and his Posterity, and the true public Liberty, Safety,
and Peace of the Kingdoms, wherein every ones private condition is included;
And calling to mind the treacherous and bloody Plots, Conspiracies, Attempts
and Practices of the Enemies of GOD against the true Religion and Professors
thereof in all places, especially in these three Kingdoms, ever since the
Reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power and presumption are of
late, and at this time increased and exercised; whereof the deplorable estate
of the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and
Kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and Kingdom of
Scotland are present and public testimonies: We have now at last (after other
means of Supplication, Remonstrance, Protestation and Suffering) for the
preservation of our selves and our Religion from utter ruin and destruction,
according to the commendable practice of these Kingdoms in former times, and
the example of GODS People in other Nations, after mature deliberation,
resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn League and Covenant:
Wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with our hands lifted
up to the most high GOD, do Swear,

1. That we shall sincerely, really and constantly, through the grace of GOD,
endeavor in our several places and callings, the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in the Chuch of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, against our common Enemies; The Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdoms of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, according to the Word of GOD, and the example of the best Reformed
Churches; And shall endeavor to bring the Churches of GOD in the three
Kingdoms, to the nearest conjunction and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of
Faith, Form of Church Government, Directory for Worship and Catechizing; That
we and our Posterity after us, may, as Brethren, live in Faith and Love, and
the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

2. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavor the
Extirpation of Popery, Prelacy (that is, Church Government by Archbishops,
Bishops, their Chancellours and Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters,
Archdeacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that
Hierarchy) Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever shall be
found to be contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godliness; Lest we
partake in other men's sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their
plagues; And that the Lord may be one, and his Name one in the three Kingdoms.

3. We shall with the same sincerity, reality and constancy, in our several
vocations, endeavor with our estates and lives mutually to preserve the Rights
and Privileges of the Parliaments, and the Liberties of the Kingdoms; And to
preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's Person and Authority, in the
preservation and defense of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms;
That the world may bear witness with our consciences of our Loyalty, and that
we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and
greatness.

4. We shall also with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such as
have been, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil instruments, by
hindering the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or
one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any faction, or parties amongst the
people contrary to this League and Covenant, That they may be broughr to
public trial, and receive condign punishment, as the degree of their
offenses shall require or deserve, or the supreme Judicatories of both
Kingdoms respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall
judge convenient.

5. And whereas the happiness of a blessed Peace between these Kingdoms,
denied in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of GOD
granted unto us, and has been lately concluded, and settled by both
Parliaments, We shall each one of us, according to our place and interest,
endeavor that they may remain conjoined in a firm Peace and Union to all
Posterity, And that Justice may be done upon the wilful Opposers thereof, in
manner expressed in the precedent Article.

6. We shall also according to our places and callings in this Common cause of
Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those that
enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof;
And shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly by whatsoever
combination, persuasion or terror, to be divided and withdrawn from this
blessed Union and conjunction, whither to make defection to the contrary part,
or to give ourselves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause,
which so much concerns the Glory of GOD, the good of the Kingdoms, and honor
of the King; But shall all the days of our lives zealously and constantly
continue therein, against all opposition, and promote the same according to our
power, against all Lets and Impediments whatsoever; And, what we are not able
our selves to suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make known, that it
may be timely prevented or removed: All which we shall do as in the sight of
GOD.

And because these Kingdoms are guilty of many sins, and provocations against
GOD, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present distresses and
dangers, the fruits thereof, We profess and declare before GOD, and the world,
unfeigned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these
Kingdoms, especially that we have not, as we ought, valued the inesteemable
benefit of the Gospel, that we have not labored for the purity and power
thereof, and that we have not endeavored to receive Christ in our hearts, nor
to walk worthy of him in our lives, which are the causes of other sins and
transgressions so much abounding amongst us. And our true and unfeigned purpose,
desire, and endeavor for ourselves, and all others under our power and charge,
both in public and in private, in all duties we owe to GOD and man, to amend
our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real
Reformation; That the Lord may turn away his wrath, and heavy indignation, and
establish these Churches and Kingdoms in truth and Peace. And this Covenant we
make in the presence of Almighty GOD the Searcher of all hearts, with a true
intention to peform the same, As we shall answer at that great Day when the
secrets of all hearts, shall be disclosed; Most humbly beseeching the Lord, to
strengthen us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires, and
proceedings with such success, as may be deliverance and safety to his people,
and encouragement to other Christian Churches groaning under, or in danger of
the yoke of Antichristian Tyranny, or to join in the same, or like Association
and Covenant, To the Glory of GOD, the enlargement of the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ, and the peace and tranquillity of Christian Kingdoms, and
Commonwealths.

A Solemn Acknowledgement of public Sins and Breaches of the Covenant; AND A
Solemn Engagement to all the Duties contained therein, namely th^se which do in
a more special way relate unto the dangers of these times: ANNO 1648.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and
Commons of all sorts within this Kingdom, by the good hand of GOD upon us,
taking in serious consideration the many sad afflictions and deep distresses
wherewith we have been exercised for a long time past, and that the Land after
it has been sore wasted with the Sword and the Pestilence, and threatened with
Famine, and that shame and contempt has been poured out from the Lord against
many thousands of our Nation, who did in a sinful way make War upon the Kingdom
of England, contrary to the Testimony of his Servants and desires of his
People, and that the remnant of that Army returning to this Land have spoiled
and oppressed many of our Brethren, and that the Malignant party is still
numerous, and retaining their former principles, wait for an opportunity to
raise a new and dangerous War, not only unto the rending of the bowels of this
Kingdom, but unto the dividing of us from England, and overturning of the work
of God in all the three Kingdoms: And considering also that a cloud of
calamities does still hang over our heads, and threaten us with sad things to
come, We cannot but look upon these things as from the Lord, who is righteous
in all his ways, feeding us with the bread of tears, and making us to drink
the waters of affliction, until we be taught to know how evil and bitter a
thing it is to depart away from him, by breaking the Oath and Covenant which we
have made with him, and that we may be humbled before him by confessing our
sin, and forsaking the evil of our way.

Therefore being pressed with so great necessities and straits, and warranted
by the word of God, and having the example of Gods people of old, who in the
time of their troubles, and when they were to seek delivery and a right way for
themselves, that the Lord might be with them to prosper them, did humble
themselves before him, and make a free and particular confession of the sins of
their Princes, their Rulers, their Captains, their Priests and their people,
and did engage themselves to do no more so, but to reform their ways and be
steadfast in his Covenant; And remembering the practice of our predecessors in
the year 1596. Wherein the General Assembly, and all the Kirk-judicatories,
with the concurrence of many of the Nobily, Gentry, and Burgesses, did with
many tears acknowledge before God the breach of the National Covenant, and
engaged themselves to a Reformation, even as our predecessors and theirs had
before done in the General Assembly and convention of Estates in the year
1567. And perceiving that this duty, when gone about out of conscience and in
sincerity, has always been attended with a reviving out of troubles, and with
a blessing and success from Heaven; We do humbly and sincerely in his sight,
who is the searcher of hearts, acknowledge the many sins and great
transgressions of the Land; We have done wickedly, our Kings, our Princes, our
Nobles, our Judges, our Officers, our Teachers, and our People: Albeit the Lord
has long and clearly spoken unto us, we have not hearkened to his voice;
Albeit he has followed us with tender mercies, we have not been allured to
wait upon him and walk in his way; And though he has stricken us, yet we have
not grieved; Nay though he has consumed us, we have refused to receive
correction; We have not remembered to render unto the Lord according to his
goodness and according to our own vows and promises, but have gone away
backward by a continued course of backsliding, and have broken all the Articles
of that solemn League and Covenant which we swore before God, Angels and men.

Albeit there be in the land many of all ranks, who be for a Testimony unto the
Truth, and for a name of joy and praise unto the Lord, by living godly,
studying to keep their garments pure, and being steadfast in the Covenant and
Cause of God; Yet we have reason to acknowledge that most of us have not
endeavored with that reality, sincerity and constancy, that did become us, to
preserve the work of Reformation in the Kirk of Scotland; Many have satisfied
themses with the purity of the Ordinances neglecting the power thereof; yea,
some have turned aside to crooked ways destructive to both. The profane,
loose and insolent carriage of many in our Armies, who went to the Assistance
of our BRETHREN in ENGLAND, And the tamperings and unstraight dealing of some
of our Commissioners and others of our Nation in London, the Isle of Wight, and
other places of that Kingdom, have proved great lets to the work of
Reformation, and settling of Kirk-Government there, whereby Error and Schism in
that Land have been increased, and Sectaries hardened in their way. We have
been so far from endeavoring the extirpation of Prophannesse, and what is
contrary to the power of godliness, that prophanity has been much winked at,
and Profane persons much countenanced and many times employed, until iniquity
and ungodliness has gone over the face of the land as a flood; Nay,
sufficient care has not been had to separate betwixt the precious and the
vile, by debarring from the Sacrament all ignorant and scandalous persons
according to the Ordinances of this Kirk.

Neither have the Privileges of the Parliaments and Liberties of the Subject
been duly tendered, But some amongst our selves have labored to put into the
hands of our King an arbitrary and unlimited power destructive to both, And
many of us have been accessory of late to those means and ways, whereby the
freedom and privileges of Parliaments have been encroached upon and the
Subjects oppressed in their Consciences, persons and Estates: Neither has it
been our care to avoid these things which might harden the King in his evil
way; But upon the contrary he has not only been permitted, but many of us
have been isntrumental to make him exercise his power in many things tending
to the prejudice of Religion and of the Covenant, and of the Peace and safety
of these Kingdoms; Which is so far from the right way of preserving his
Majesty's Person and Authority, that it cannot but provoke the Lord against him
unto the hazard of both, Nay under a pretense of relieving and doing for the
King whilst he refuses to do what was necessary for the house of God, some have
ranversed and violated most of all the Articles of the Covenant.

Our own Consciences within, and Gods judgments upon us without do convince
us, of the manifold wilful renewed breaches of that Article, which concerns
the discovery and punishment of Malignants, whose crimes have not only been
connived at but dispensed with and pardoned, and themselves received unto
intimate fellowship with our selves, and entrusted with our Counsels, admitted
unto our Parliaments, and put in places of Power and Authority, for managing
the public affairs of the Kingdom, Whereby in Gods justice they got at last
into their hands the whole power and strength of the Kingdom, both in
judicatories and Armies, And did employ the same unto the enacting and
prosecuting an unlawful Engagement in war against the Kingdom of England,
Notwithstanding of the dissent of many considerable members of Parliament, who
had given constant proof of their integrity in the cause from the beginning, of
many faithful testimonies and free warnings of the servants of God, of the
Supplications of many Synods, Presbyteries and Shyres, and of the Declarations
of the General Assembly and their Commissioners to the contrary: Which
engagement as it has been the cause of much sin, so also of much misery and
calamity unto this Land, and holds forth to us, the grievousnesse of our sin
of complying with Malignants, in the greatness of our judgment, that we may
be taught never to split again upon the same rock, upon which the Lord has set
so remarkable a Beacon. And after all that is come to pass unto us because of
this our trespass, and after that grace has been showed unto us from the Lord
our God, by breaking these men's yoke from of our necks, and putting us again
into a capacity to act for the good of Religion, our own safety, and the Peace
and safety of this Kingdowe, should we again-break his Commandment and
Covenant, by joining once more with the people of these abominations, and
taking into our bosom those Serpents which had formerly stung us almost unto
death: This as it would argue great madness and folly upon our part, So no
doubt, if it be not avoided. will provoke the Lord against us to consume us
until there be no remnant nor escaping in the Land.

And albeit the Peace and Union betwivt the Kingdoms be a great blessing of God
unto both and a Bond which we are obliged to preserve unviolated, And to
endeavor that justice may be done upon the opposers thereof; Yet some in this
Land, who have come under the Bond of the Covenant, have made it their great
study how to dissolve this Union, and few or no endeavors have been used by
any of us for punishing of such.

We have suffered many of our Brethren in several parts of the Land to be
oppressed of the common Enemy without compassion or relief; There has been
great murmuring and repining because of expense of means and pains in doing of
our duty; Many by persuasion or terror have suffered themselves to be divided
and withdrawn to make defection to the contrary part; Many have turned off to a
detestable indifferency and neutrality in this cause, which so much concerns
the glory of God and the good of these Kingdoms; Nay many have made it their
study to walk so, as they might comply with all times and all the revolutions
thereof. It has not been our care to countenance, encourage, entrust and
employ such only, as from their hearts did affect and mind Gods Work; But the
hearts of such many times have been discouraged, and their hands weakened,
their sufferings neglected, and themselves slighted, and many who were once
open enemies and always secret underminers contenanced and employed; Nay even
those who had been looked upon as Incendiaries, and upon whom the Lord had set
marks of desperate Malignancy, falsehood and deceat were brought in, as fit to
manage public affairs; Many have been the lets and Impediments that have been
cast in the way to retard and obstruct the Lords work, and some have kept
secret, what of themselves they were not able to suppress and overcome.

Besides these and many other breaches of the Articles of the Covenant in the
matter thereof, which it concerns every one of us to search out and
acknowledge before the Lord, as we would wish his wrath to be turned away from
us; So have many of us failed exceedingly in the manner of our following and
pursuing the duties contained therein, not only seeking great things for our
selves, and mixing of private interests and ends concerning our selves and
friends and followers, with those things which concern the public good, but
many times preferring such to the Honor of God and good of his cause, and
retarding Gods work until we might carry alongs with us our own interests and
designs. It has been our way to trust in the means and to rely upon the arm
of flesh for success, Albeit the Lord has many times made us meet with
dispointment therein, and stained the pride of all our Glory, by blasting every
carnal confidence unto us: We have followed for the most part the counsels of
flesh and blood, and walked more by the rules of policy then Piety, and have
hearkened more unto men then unto God.

Albeit we made solemn public profession before the World of our unfeigned
desires to be humbled before the Lord for our own sins, and the sins of
these Kingdoms, especially for our undervaluing of the inestimable benefit of
the Gospel, and that we have not labored for the power thereof, and received
Christ into our hearts, and walked worthy of him in our lives, and of our true
and unfeigned purpose, desire and endeavor for our selves, and all other under
our power and charge both in public and private, in all duties which we owe to
God and man to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the
example of a real Reformation, that the Lord might turn away his wrath and
heavy indignation, and establish these Kirks and Kingdoms in truth and peace,
Yet we have refused to be reformed, and have walked proudly and obstinatly
against the Lord, not v^lueing his Gospel, nor submitting our selves unto the
obedience thereof, not seeking after Christ, nor studying to honor him in the
excellency of his person, nor employ him in the virtue of his offices, not
making conscience of public Ordinances, nor private nor secret duties, nor
studying to edify one another in love. The ignorance of God and of his Son
Jesus Christ prevails exceedingly in the Land; The greatest part of Masters of
families amongst Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses and Commons neglect to
seek God in their families, and to endeavor the the Reformation thereof; And
albeit it has been much pressed, yet few of our Nobles and great ones ever to
his day could be persuaded to perform family duties themselves and in their own
persons; which makes so necessary and useful a duty to be misregarded by others
of inferior rank; Nay many of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burrows who should have
been examples of Godliness and sober walking unto others, have been
ringleaders of excess and rioting. Albeit we be the Lords people engaged to
him in a solemn way, yet to this day we have not made it our study that
judicatories and Armies should consist of, and places of power and trust be
filled with men of a blameless and Christian conversation, and of known
integrity and approven fidelity, affection and Zeal unto the cause of God, but
not only those who have been neutrall and indifferent but disaffected and
Malignant, and others who have been profane and scandalous have been
entrusted; By which it has come to pass that judicatories have been the seats
of injustice and iniquity, aad many in our Armies by their miscarriages have
become our plague, unto the great prejudice of the cause of God, the great
scandal of the Gospel, and the great increase of looseness and prophanity
throughout all the Land. It were impossible to reckon up all the abominations
that are in the Land, but the Blaspheming of the name of God, swearing by the
Creatures, profanation of the Lords Day, uncleanness, drunkenness, excess
and rioting, vanity of apparel, lying and deceit, railing and cursing,
arbitrary and uncontrolled oppression, and grinding of the faces of the poor,
by Landlords and others in place and power, are become ordinary and common
sins; And besides all these things, there be many other transgressions,
whereof the Land wherein we live are guilty: All which we desire to acknowledge
and to be humbled for, that the world may bear witness with us, that
Righteousness belongs unto God, and shame and confusion of face unto us as
appears this day.

And because it is needful for these who find mercy not only to confess but
also to forsake their sin, Therefore that the reality and sincerity of our
repentance may appear, We do Resolve and solemnly engage our selves before the
Lord, carefully to avoid for the time to come all these offenses, whereof we
have now made solemn public acknowledgement, and all the snares and tentations
which tend thereunto: And to testify the integrity of our resolution herein,
and that we may be the better enabled in the power of the Lords strength to
perform the same, We do again Renew our Solemn League and Covenant, Promising
hereafter to make conscience of all the duties whereunto we are obliged in all
the heads and Articles thereof, particularly of these which follow.

1. Because Religion is of all things the most excellent and precious, The
advancing and promoving the power thereof against all ungodliness and
profanity, The securing and preserving the purity thereof against all error,
heresy and schism, and namely Independency, Anabatisme, Antinomianisme,
Arminianisme, Socinianisme, Familisme, Libertinisme, Scepticisme, and
Erastianisme, and the carrying on the work of uniformity shall be studied and
endeavored by us before all worldly interests, whether concerning the King or
our selves, or any other whatsomever. 2: Because many have of late labored to
supplant the liberties of the Kirk, we shall maintain and defend the Kirk of
Scotland, in all her liberties and privileges, against all who shall oppose or
undermine the same, or encroach thereupon under any pretext whatsomever. 3. We
shall vindicat and maintain the liberties of the Subjects, in all these things
which concern their consciences, persons and Estates. 4. We shall carefully
maintain and defend the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and avoid every thing that
may weaken the same, or involve us in any measure of accession unto the guilt
of those who have invaded the Kingdom of England. 5. As we have been always
Loyal to our King, so we shall still endeavor to give unto God that which is
Gods, and to Caesar the things which are Cesars. 6. We shall be so far from
conniving at, complying with, or contenancing of Malignancy, injustice,
iniquity, prophanity and impiety, that we shall not only avoid, and
discountenance those things, and cherish and encourage these persons, who are
zealous for the Cause of God, and walk according to the Gospel; But also shall
take a more effectual course then heretofore in our respective Places and
Callings, for punishing and suppressing these evils, and faithfully endeavor
that the best and fittest remedies may be applied for taking away the causes
thereof, and advancing the knowledge of God, and Holiness and Righteousness
in the Land: And therefore in the last place, as we shall earnestly pray unto
God that he would give us able men fearing God, men of truth and hating
covetousness to judge and bear charge among his people, so we shall according
to our Places and Callings Endeavor that Judicatories and all places of power
and trust both in Kirk and State may consist of, and be filled with such men as
are of known good affection to the cause of God, and of a blameless and
Christian conversation.

And because there be many, who heretofore have not made conscience of the oath
of God, but some through fear, others by persuasion and upon base ends and
humane interests have entered thereinto, who have afterward discovered
themselves to have dealt deceitfully with the Lord, in swearing falsely by his
name, Therefore we, who do now renew our Covenant in reference to these duties,
and all other duties contained therein, Do in the sight of him who is the
searcher of hearts, solemnly Profess that it is not upon any politic
advantage or private interest or by-end, or because of any terror or persuasion
from men, or hypocritically and deceitfully, that we do again take upon us the
oath of God, But honestly and sincerely and from the sense of our duty, And
that therefore denying our selves and our own things and laying aside all self
interest and ends, We shall above all things seek the honor of God, the good
of his Cause and the wealth of his people, and that forsaking the counsels of
flesh and blood, and not leaning upon carnal confidences, we shall depend upon
the Lord, walk by the rule of his word, and hearken to the voice of his
servants: In all which professing our own weakness We do earnestly pray to God
who is the father of mercies through his Son Jesus Christ, to be merciful unto
us, and to enable us by the power of his might, that we may do our duty unto
the praise of his Grace in the Churches. Amen.

The occasion of this Acknowledgment and Engagement was this;
THE Commission of the General Assembly 1648. considering the many breaches of
the Solemn League and Covenant (and particularly by the Engagement in War that
Year against England) The Slackness of many in following the duties therein,
And that many, (being under age when it was first sworn) had not been received
into the same, did, by their Act October 6. ordain it to be renewed with this
Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins and breaches, and Engagement to duties, And to
that effect, appointed two solemn Fasts to be kept in all the Congregations
of the Land, for the Causes contained in the Acknowledgment of Sins, And that
intimation thereof should be made to the people upon the Sabbath before, and
that the Covenant, together with the former Acknowledgment of Sins and
Engagement to duties, should be read publicly to the People, upon the day of
the Intimation, and the last Fast day when the Covenant was to be sworn. This
resolution of the Commission, upon the same grounds was unanimously approven by
the Committee of Estats then sitting, and by their Act October 14. Ordained to
be put in Execution, in all things according to the directions of the
Commission: And accordingly in the month of December, it was for the second
time sworn in all the Congregations of the Kingdom, upon the same day, (except
where vacancy or the Ministers being under scandal or process did occasion a
delay till another day, that the place was supplied by another Minister) with
great Solemnity, and such mixture of Joy and Sorrow as became people entering
in Covenant with the Lord, And was thereafter Subscribed by all the Swearers.
After ward, the Parliament Conveening, in January 1649 by their very first Act
except the Election of their President, upon the same grounds, Resolved to keep
a Fast by themselves, for the Causes contained in the Acknowlegment, and to
Renew the Covenant according to the Order of the Commission, which was also
most solemnly done. And last of all the General Assembly 1649. by their Act,
July 7. did unanimously and expressly Ratify the Proceedings of the Commission,
as to the Acknowledgment of Sins, Engagement to duties, the Fasts, and
Renewing of the Covenant by Swearing and Subscribing thereof. Hence, as the
Covenant it self, so the Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to duties
became National Authorized by the Supreme Judicatures of Church and State and
are still obliging by Oath. Oh! that the Lord had kept these things in the
Imagination of the thought of our hearts for ever.

A True and short DEDUCTION Of the WRESTLINGS of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND, For
the KINGDOM of JESUS CHRIST, From the beginning of the Reformation of Religion,
unto the Year 1667.
AFter all these great and glorious things, which the Lord in his Love, Mercy
and Faithfulness has wrought for this Land, and in his Holiness and
Righteousness has declared amongst us; these clear and powerful
Manifestations of his blessed Truth, which have so brightly shined forth, to
the Glory, Beauty and Praise of this whole Nation: After these many sacred and
most solemn Engagements, whereby, in the evidence and power of the same Truth,
all Ranks and degrees, from the King even to the meanest, became, and are still
bound and devoted to the Most High and Holy, Our Covenanted God, and to our
blessed Lord Jesus Christ, (who alone is King in Zion and of all Saints, and
whose are all the Kings and Kingdoms of the Earth,) for the advancement of his
Glory and Kingdom, and for the owning and maintaining of his glorious Work and
precious Truth, which is all our Felicity and Joy: And after all this horrid
Apostasy and Rebellion, whereby the same wretched Nation, in the same
Generation, and almost in the same Persons, neither from the conviction of any
pretended Reason or Conscience, nor from any solid persuasion of the very
Advantage designed* but in the manifest Spirit of Wickedness and violence, have
forgotten, despised and blasphemed the former power and Glory; Rebelled against
God, by breaking the Holy Covenant; Rejected our Lord and Savior; Overturned
the Work of his own blessed Spirit and Arm; Abrogated and rescinded all these
righteous Laws and Ordinances, whereby it was established; And by most Unjust,
Arbitrary and Cruel Laws and Practices, have endeavored the rebuilding and
promoving of the Kingdom of Darkness and Antichrist, and precipitating of all
men, either into the same condemnation with themselves, or utter ruin and
Extermination; After, we say, all these things, which the Lord has thus
wrought and permitted in the midst of us, neither the Discouragement and
Fainting of some, nor the Unsuccesfulness of the more honest and Zealous
endeavors of others, nor yet our Silence hithertil, is greatly to be wondered
at. For, whose eyes can behold all these things, without Dimnes and affecting
of the heart? And whose heart can consider them, without Astonishment and
Horror, if not Stupefaction or Discouragement? How little wonder is it, that
every visage (suppose of the fairest Nazarit) be blacker then a coal? That
every eye run down with waters? and that the souls of many refuse to be
comforted, and neither do, nor dare rejoice as other people? When not only, by
their going a whoreing from the Lord, their daily bread, is become the bread or
Adversity and the waters of Affliction, and when their famine of the Word of
the Lord is such, that though they wander from sea to sea seeking it, they
cannot find it; Bot also the Comforter that should releeve their souls is far
from them, and either covers Himself with a cloud, that their prayers cannot
pass through* or then answers them, only by terrible things in Righteousness;
How can they, who by their Vanities have moved the Holy God to Jealousy, and
thereby have provoked their Rock to fell them, stand before their Enemies, or
chase a thousand and put ten thousand to flight? and al^hough that we should
plead with our Mother, with our Rulers, and with all other ranks of persons
within the Land, that they would put away their whoredoms out of their sight,
and their Adulteries from between their breasts; yet what hope is there, that
Words shall prevaill, where the Power and Glory of the most High is contemned?
Or that Reason shall be heard, where the Counsel of God is rejected?

Here indeed is matter of Wonder and Praise, even the Longsuffering of the
Lord, (which is Salvation) and the Mercy and faithfulness of our God, who has
not only hithertil preserved a Remnant, even a holy seed, which shall be the
substance of our Land; But (after this late sudden and astonishing stroke of
his holy Indignation, which seemed to presage no less, then the woeful
overturning of this sinking Church, into the depth of all darkness, and the
dreadful overthrow of this whole Land and Nation, in the consummation of his
fierce anger, to have been poured out in our desolation) has made Light and
Salvation to arise, and Glory and Praise to spring forth, in making his grace
more manifest and commending and asserting His Work and Covenant, more in the
Sufferings and Death of His faithful Servants and Witnesses, then in all the
prosperity and Victories, which formerly he vouchsaved upon us. O! blessed and
exalted be his most Holy Name and abundant Grace, who for the wicked and
momentany rejoicing of our adversaries, has given to his People, such sweet
consolations and Exuberant Praise; and from the depths of our present
distresses, and amidst the fears of so imminent and great judgments, has, in
stead of an Apology before the world* put a song of Salvation in our Mouth,
that, as well to Testify for the Lord against the backsliders, as for the
comfort and consolation of all who love and wait for his Salvation, we may call
the Heavens to hear and the Earth to give ear, that we may publish the Name of
the Lord, and ascrib Greatness to our God, whose work is perfect, and all his
ways Judgment; A God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Just and Right is He. We
have corrupted ourselves, our spot is not the spot of his Children, we are a
perverse and crooked generation: Do we thus requit the Lord, O foolish people
and unwise? Yet is not He our Father that has bought us? Has not He made us
and established us? Let us then remember the days of old, when the most High
did visit us, and the Lord became Our God, and we became His People and
Inheritance. This is the Testimony of his dying withnesses, this is the voice
of his present Dispensations. We will therefore call to mind the Years of the
right hand of the Most High, and the wondrous works of the Lord, which He alone
did work in our Land: We will also declare our manifold Engagements, and our
most selemn and sacred Covenants, with and to Our God; that the Lord's Loving
Kindness may be made known; that the Innocence, Strength and Joy of his
Servants may appear; that the glory of all his Righteous Judgments, which are
either already come upon us, or which we have reason to fear, may be made
manifest; that wickedness may stop it is mouth; and that all the Enemies of the
Lord may be confounded.

It is not here intended to resume these debates, which, as the Adversaries
have formerly moved, and pertinaciously maintained against the Work of God, and
almost against every passage and transaction thereof; so have the Lovers and
Owners of it, abundantly satisfied, and the Lord Himself determined with that
power and Evidence, that, the Conversion of some and Conviction of almost all,
and even of it is most desperate opposers, is not the smalest part of it is Glory:
But seeing the party that now prevails, has disdained that method, and only
by plain force and Violence, in the most gross and desperate Rebellion,
Blasphemy and Perfidy against God and his Cause, and the highest and most
determined contempt and misreguard of all good Conscience, and sacred Oaths,
that ever the sun beheld, has carried on and advanced this present Apostasy
and defection, under which all the Godly do mourn, and the Land perishes: We
shall only here endeavor, the sincere and candid Representation of these
things, which, as they were once the Glory of the Lord, and joy of his people
in this poor Nation, so are they now the Testimony and Triumph of his
witnesses, and the Patience and Hope of all his Sufferers, and may be the full
Satisfaction of all, who shall hear of these late and present troubles,
wherewith the Lord does Exercise us, and will undoubtedly in the end prove,
etiher the Exaltation and Praise, or the Desolation and perpetual Confusion of
BACKSLIDEN SCOTLAND.

When Scotland* through the usurpation of the Roman Antichrist, and the
contagion of his abominations, and through the Pride, Lust and Tyranny of
Prelacy, (the very root and strength of that Kingdom of wickedness) had fallen
into that gross and black darkness of Ignorance and Superstition, and into
these strong Delusions, (wherewith the Lord as he has threatened, so has he
ever infallibly plagued that Antichristian course) and for many hundredth Years
had lien involved therein; It pleased the Lord in his wonderful mercy and free
love, to cause the glorious Light of the everlasting Gospel again to arise and
shine forth amongst us: Which, as it is ever best witnessed by its own Power
and Purity; So through the Power and Wisdom of God alone, even by the Weakness
of very mean instruments, in the midst of the flames of fiery persecutions, and
against the rage and fury of the Devil* and of all the powers of Hell, was this
Work advanced and effectuated: As the records of these times from 1494. until
about the Year 1560. do plainly discover. Dureing which period of time, these
things are very observable.

First That where and when ever the Light and Truth of God did discover and
testify against the Corruptions, Errors, Idolatry, and Superstitions of Popery
in the same manner it testified and declared, that the Popes usurped Tyranny,
and the Pride, Idleness and Domination of the wicked Prelates, were chiefly the
Authors and Maintainers thereof.

Secondly. That such as the Lord did from time to time call to, and send forth
for the work of the Ministry, did walk therein, with the same Painfulness*
Poverty, Simplicity, Humility, and Equality which the Holy command and
practices of our blessed Lord and his Apostles, do so constantly commend: Hence
it is, that, in so far as this point could fall under the enquiry of these
times, it is clearly held out, that they acknowledged no Officer in God's
House, Superior to a Preaching Minister and according to the standard of this
Office, did they try, reject and crave the Reformation of exorbitant Prelacy.
As the examinations and testimonies of the faithful in these days do witness.

Thirdly. That as the love of God and his blessed Truth, and the Precepts,
Promise and Presence of our Lord Jesus Chirst, did enable unto all Patience
with joy, such as, by the call of a clear and necessary providence, the Lord
set forth to be his witnesses; (who, for the love and Testimony of Jesus,
cheerfully embraced the fire and faggott) so when the Lord did multiply the
faithful to a Reasonable Capacity, they were so far from resigning themselves,
and abandoning that First, and most just Privilege of Self-defence* to the
arbitriment even of the lawful Powers, and of that Authority which they did
acknowledge, that they not only owned it and stood to it; but did account
themselves so much the more obliged to their own Preservation and esteemed the
same so much the more endeared to them, that the se^ing forth of the Glory of
God, in the maintenance of the blessed Gospel and the propagation and
continuance thereof, seemed so necessarily to depend thereon: which endeavors,
they did also further extend, in the bowels and bonds of brotherly affection in
Christ Jesus, unto the same duty of defense and Assistence to all his members.
And in effect, if their Principles and Practices be well considered, it will
appear, that, as when God called them to suffering, they loved not their lives
unto Death that they might witness a good confession; so when they attained to
any Probability of Acting, they thought themselves indispensibly obliged, upon
their uttermost hazard to defend the Gospel which they had received, and to
suppress all Superstition and Idolatry contrary thereto, although the motive of
Self-defence had not been conjoined: And it will also appear, that the
Necessity of Convocations and Combinations (though not only without but even
against Authority; Yet being in order to such necessary and just Ends) did
suffiriently warrant them before God and all men, from the breach of any Law or
Act then standing against the same, wherewith they might have been charged. For
verification hereof, though the whole course of our Reformation be an
unquestionable evidence, yet let the instance of their first Appearance be
observed, wherein both the Motives, Actors and all other circumstances, do more
clearly and beyond all cavillation hold out, that only the Love and Zeal of
God, in the same Spirit in which they had so constantly suffered, did stir them
up, from the pure and vive sense of their indispensible duty and certain
Privilege, against all opposition whatsomever, to own and set themselves for
the Defense of the Gospel and the true Ministers thereof. The passage is thus.

In or about the Year 1555 the Queen by the instigation of the Prelates,
(perceaving the increase of the Protestants, and fearing some inward
distraction, during the wars then with England, if She should fall upon a more
rigorous and general course,) did cause all the Preachers to be summoned:
whereupon the body and generality of the whole Protestants, resolved to keep
the Diet. But the Bishops apprehending the hazard, did procure that they should
be commanded instantly to the borders: Nevertheless God had so provided* that
upon the same day the West-land Quarter returned from it; which consisting of
many faithful men* so soon as they understood the matter, they repaired to the
Queen, and plainly in the hearing of the Prelates did charge them, with the
cruel device intended, and certified Her' of their resolution, both to oppose
it, and defend their Brethren to their uttermost; and ceased not, until that
She was moved to discharge the citation.

Thereafter in the Year 1557. they entered into a Covenant of constant mutual
Defense of the Gospel, their Ministers, and themselves, against all their
adversaries, in these words, We perceiving how Satan in his members, the
Antichrists of our time, cruelly do rage, seeking to overthrow and destroy the
Gospel of Christ, and his Congregation, ought, according to our bounden duty,
to strive in our Masters Cause, even unto the death, being certain of the
Victory in him: The which our duty being well considered, We do promise
before the Majesty of God, and his Congregation, That we (by his grace) shall
with all diligence continually apply our whole power, substance, and our very
lives, to maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed Word of God,
and his Congregation: And shall labor according to our power, to have
faithful Ministers, truly and purely to minister Christ's Gospel and Sacraments
to his people. We shall maintain them, nourish them, and defend them; the whole
Congregation of Christ, and every Member thereof according to our whole powers,
and waging of our lives, against Satan and all wicked power that does intend
Tyrranny or trouble against the foresaid Congregation. Unto the which holy
Word, and Congregation, we de join us; and so do forsake and renounce the
Congregation of Satan with all the superstitious abomination and idolatry
thereof. And moreover, shall declare our selves manifest enemies thereto, by
this our faithful promise before God testified to this Congregation, by our
Subscription at these Presents. At Edinburgh the third Day of December, Anno
1557. God called to witness.

Like as in the Year 1559. being again necessitated to assemble for, and stand
to the defense of the Gospel and themselves, at Perth, they renewed and
enlarged the same engagement, according to the good hand and Spirit of God upon
his Servants, in these words, At Perth the last day of May, the Year of God
1559. Years, the Congregations of the West Country, with the Congregations
of Fife, Perth, Dundie, Angus, Merns and Monross, being conveened in the town
of Perth, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for setting forth of his glory,
understanding nothing more necessary for the same, then to keep a constant
amity, unity, and fellowship together, according as they are commanded by God,
are confederate, and become bounden and obliged in the presence of God, to
concur and assist together in doing all things required of God in his
Scripture, that may be to his glory; And at their whole powers to destroy and
put away all things that does dishonor to his name, so that God may be truly
and purely worshipped. And in case that any trouble be intended aganst the said
Congregation, or any part or member thereof, the whole Congregation shall
concur, assist, and conveen together, to the defense of the same Congregation
or person troubled: And shall not spare Labors, goods, Substance, Bodies and
Lives, in maintaining the liberty of the whole Congregation, and every member
thereof, against whatsoever person shall intend the said trouble for cause of
Religion, or any other cause depending thereupon, or lay to their charge under
pretense thereof, although it happen to be colored with any other outward
cause.

And again in the Month of August, the same Year, after having sustained and
valiantly resisted a second assault, both of the wicked Prelates and of their
other violent adversaries; by a third band and Oath they added a further
caution to their former engagements, to the effect that in so just and holy a
cause, they might never by force or fraud be thereafter fainted or divided.

And lastly in April Anno 15^0. they engaged themselves in a fourth bond in
these words, We whose names are underwritten, have promised and oblidged our
selves faithfully in the presence of God, and by these presents do promise,
that we together in General, and every one of us in special by himself, with
our bodies, goods and friends, and all that we can do, shall set forward the
Reformation of Religion, according to Gods Word, and procure by all means
possible, that the Truth of Gods Word, my have free passage within this
realm, with due administration of Sacraments, and all things depending upon
the said Word -- that we shall each one with another, all of us, effectually
concur, join in one, take and hold one plain part for the, -- and recovery
of our ancient freedom, Liberties. -- that we way be ruled by the Laws and
Custom of the Country. -- Again that we shall tender the common Cause, as if
it were the Cause of every one of us in particular; And that the Causes of
every one of us now joined together, being lawful and honest, shall be all our
Cause in General; And that he that is enemy to the Cause foresaid, shall be
Enemy to us all in so far. -- We have superadded these instances (as we might
have done two or three more) to the first proposed, because of their great
resemblance, since there can be nothing more manifest, then that the same
Provocations the same Spirit, the same Principles, and the same Design, did
most uniformly influence all these Transactions. Now seeing that both the
Occasion, Actors, Aim, and End of the first Action, and especially the
observable Providence of God, that without all contrivance of man did overruled
it, do clearly purge it of any intended Rebellion or other wickedness;
Certainly to affirm that all these things were nevertheless acted in, and by a
Rebellious Spirit, must be a sin, at least next unto that of high despit and
Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and Spirit of grace, by whose power alone,
this blessed work was effectuated: Neither durst the Arch-Prelat himself though
our Arch-Adversary in this our present cause, and though he knew that the same
does infallibly, either stand or fall upon the same principles and grounds with
these cases now under consideration, proceed any further in his censure of
these courses and practices; then to disprove them as Violent and Disorderly.
There is one thing further, which is also before touched, that the instances
above adduced especially the first, both for the Meanness of it is Actors the
unpremeditated plainness of its Manner, and the singlness and purity of its
End, does most evidently make out, viz: that as these men of God, by their
small and improbable appearance, did as much witness their unfeigned love of the
Truth and zeal of his Glory, in the manifest contempt and hazard of their lives
and fortuns, As when under the dispensation and call of another providence,
they did patiently and cheerfully upon the same motives, lay down their lives,
and suffer the loss of all things; So the end of their undertaking, was not
only their own just and necessary Defense, which in such an apparent danger,
might rather seem to be abandoned then intended, but above all things, the
Maintenance and Defense of that blessed Evangel, which was dearer to them,
then all other interests whatsoever. We know our great adversaries, who for
the gain and pleasours of this life (what then would they not do for the
preservation of life it self?) have often renounced, and would again renounce
all Conscience, Alleagance and Truth; and who by their detestable Flatterv, in
denying the lawfulness of Self-defence, (although in effect Self be their only
Idol) and pretending a fained affection, and illimited submission without
reserve, do only court the Powers, for the advanceing of these interests, which
they seem to relinquish; as the revolutions of the World, have frequently
declared their practices in prejudice of both Religion and Royalty, and have
often resolved both their practices and principles, into that one Devilish
position, the first yea only fixed rule of their Religion Skin for skin, yea
all that a man has will be give for his life; These, we say, are not curious
to enquire in this distinction; Yet, seeing they leave nothing unessayed
whereby to promote their design, and therefore, do often cavil from such
advantages as the work of God afterward obtained, and particularly the
Concurrence of the Peers and Primores Regni, and from the defect thereof in the
first appearances, would infer the unlawfulness of the same, especially in
order to the design of Reformation; Therefore we further add with these noble
worthies, that as it cannot be denied, 1. That the right and Privilege of
Self-defence is not only founded in, but is the very first instinct of pure
Nature, and spring of all motion and action. 2. That it was competent to, and
exercised by every individual, before that either Society or Government were
known. 3. That it was so far from being surrendered or suppressed by the
erecting of these, that it was and is the great End and motive, for which all
voluntary Societies and Policies were introduced and are continued. 4. That it
is a principal rule of Righteousness, whereunto that great command of love to
our neightbour, by the Law of God and by our Lord himself is resolved, and
whereby it is interpreted; so it does infallibly follow, that the same right
and Privilege is yet competent to all men, whither Separatly or Jointly; and
needs no other prerequisit, but that of intolerable and inevitable injury;
(which for a man to suffer under pretext of the good of the Commonwealth,
would be, for the delusion of an empty name, only for the lust of others,
really to deprive himself of his whole share and interest therein) and is
completed for exercise by such a Probable Capacity, as may encourage the
Asse^ters thereof to undertake it.

And as for that other, and more noble design of the Maintenance and
Reformation of Religion, waving the question and Debate. Whether the same can
or ought to be by force maintained? Which may appear sufficiently determined to
rational men, by the very contrary Practices of it is adversaries, who not only
by force do fight aginst it, but most irreligiously usurp and detort it is own
weapons viz: the precepts of our Lord, for patience and meeknes under a
dispensation of suffering, to the persuasion of a stupid submission, and
casting away the opportunity of Desence and Acting; that without control they
may work it is overthrow; And supposing with all men, that force is not a proper
argument of persuasion, and that Religion neither can nor ought to be thereby
propagated; Yet are we in conscience persuaded, that the grounds follouwing,
evidently held out in the records of these times, are beyond contradiction.

1. That Religion (the highest concernment of Gods glory and of man's happiness
both temporal and eternal) is the most important, dear and precious of all
interests.

2. That to be violented in this (which cannot be without an unjust force
either or men's Persons or Goods) is the most wicked and insupportable of all
injuries.

3. That the propelling by force of such injuries* was the justest cause and
quarrel, that men in their Primaeve Liberty could be engaged in.

4. That, as for the security of this Interest, and no ways to make an absolut
surrender thereof to the arbitriment of any, men were mostly induced to the
appointing of Governors, so the glory of God, which is the end of all things,
but herein is most especially concerned was by the erecting of Rule and
Government for the security of Religion, more particularly and eminently
intended.

5. That the Powers appoin^ed for Preservation, cannot warrantably endeavor
Subversion.

6. That, as every man is bound to obey God rather then man; so such Violence,
and intolerable and inevi^able injury offered by he Powers on this account, as
to the person injured, destroys both the Common-welath of he people, and more
specially, the Glory of God which are the only ends of Governments, makes both
the End, the Means of Government and Authority, and the injured person's
Obligation thereunto, to cease.

7. As the persons, one or more, reduced to this estate and condition* if by a
real or apparent incapacity of Acting, they conceave them selves called to a
Testimony by Suffering ought herein with all patience, to give unto God the
Glory; so having the opportunity of, and being called* whither to their own
Defense, or the Assi^^ing of their Brethren in so just a cause, they ought
therein valiantly to acquit themselves, for the Glory of God, the mantainance
of his Truth, and the mutual preservation one of another.

8. As the Combination of more persons, whom the same common cause of just and
necessary Defense does join together* is founded upon and does most natively
arise from that Primaeve Right and Privilege, which at first gave Being and
Rise to all Societies, and whereunto, the force of extreme Necessity, through
the perversion of that Mean of Government, appointed for their Preservation,
does ultimatly reduce them; so the duty of mutual Assistance, is not only
warranted by that principle of Humanity and common Stipulation, which is the
Motive and Bond of men's entering into Society, the immediate and subordinat End
of all Rule, and the most effective Mean, whereby that superior end of the Good
and Safety of every Individual therein included, can be best secured: But
also, first, by that more endearing principle of Christian and brotherly
Affection in the Lord; upon the indispensible force and obligation whereof, the
very glory and righteousness of the great and last judgment seems to be
founded, Math. 25:31. to the end. And, secondly, by that supreme and chief
concernment of God's Glory, to which the interests of all Powers and
Commonwealth's must certainly stoop and cede. And how is it possible, that any
scruple anent this can remain with any considerat or conscientious person? if
we consider that whole Cities, Kingdoms* and Empires, for the violation of
this duty, in not releeving and delivering of Innocents from the unjust
Tyranny, even of lawful Powers, have been involved in the Guilt of the violence
and cruelty, which had been only acted by one or a few persons, and have been
overtaken therefore, by fearful effects and Judgments, to their utter ruin
and Subversion. As is most evidently confirmed by that clear intimation thereof
made by Jeremiah, to the Jews, Chap. 26..15. Know ye for a certain that if ye
put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon
THIS CITY, and upon THE INHABITANTS thereof.

9. As the Power and exercise of Reformation has been grossly calumniated by
the adversaries, as if thereby were meant and had been practiced manifest force
and violence upon Consciences and Persuasions; so on the other hand, open
Idolatry, Blasphemy, Perjury, Venting and Spreading of Heresy, and such like
abominations, (being most dishonorable to God, and pernicious to all
Commonwealths) ought without doubt, by all means to be suppressed, restrained
and severely punished Now, that this Vindicative and (in case of backsliding)
Reforming Power is committed to the Magistrate, and that he is thereto mainly
appointed, none will question; But what if not only the supreme Magistrate, but
with him all the Nobles and Primores of the Realm shall turn the principal
perverters, and chief Patrons of these abominations? As we have already
cleared, that, in case either the People or any part of them, be violented to a
sinful compliance, or be wickedly persecuted for adhering to God in the
profession and practice of the contrary duties; they may lawfully Defend
themselves, and are mutually bound to assist and deliver one another: So it now
comes to be considered, that, seeing the maintenance of Truth and the true
Worship of God, were and are the principal ends and motives of contracting of
Societies and erecting of Governments, whereunto both the People and Rulers,
are not only separatly every one for himself, but jointly oblidged for the
public advancement and establishment thereof; and that God does therefore
equally exact and avenge the sin of the Rulers only, or of the People only, or
of any part of the People only, upon the whole body of the Rulers and People,
for their simple Tollerance and connivance, without their active compliance
with the transgressors; of necessity, both from the principles deduced, and
from the most visible judgments of God agreeable thereto, there must be a
Superior and Antecedent obligation to that of Submission, incumbent upon all
both jointly and separatly, for the maintenance, vindication and Reformation of
Religion, in order to the promoting of these great ends of the public
profession of Truth and true Worship, which the Lord does indispensibly
require. And though this position be indeed more evident, where express
Covenants betwixt God and the whole People, betwixt Rulers and their Subjects,
and betwixt the People and subjects amongst themselves in order to these Holy
Duties can be produced; ye^ seeing all Constitutions of Societies and
Governments, do virtually suppose and imply the same, and are founded thereon,
the Assertion does with equal certainty firmly hold: But that all contradiction
may stop it is mouth, let the import and true meaning of the Scriptures, and
instances following be impartially weighed. Deuteronomy. 13: ver. 12, 13, 14, 15. The
Lord says, If thou shall hear that in one of thy cities, certain men amongst
you have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, to serve other Gods, and if
after deligent search^s the thing be found a truth, thou shall smite and destroy
that city utterly. Jos. 22: ver. 17, 18, 19. Phin^has says to the two Tribes
and the half, upon their supposed defection, If ye rebel to day against the
Lord, to morrow he will be wroth with the whole Congregation of Israel: And
Judges 22. throughout, in the case of Israel against Benjamin and Gibeah. All
the places, as they clearly hold out the command and practice most consonant to
our position; so to think that the same may be evaded, by astricting the places
to the Hypothesis contained in the letter viz: of more or all the cities
against one apostatizing, and that either an equal division of the cities, (the
one half faithful, the other backslidden) should bring the matter to an
accommodation; or that the greater part backsliden (who certainly had the
casting voice in that Democratick constitution, should oblige the fewer
remaining steadfast, to a sinful acquiescence, is to elude all Scripture, and
mock the Holy Ghost by whom it is given. Now, whither these places and what is
premised, do warrant an just extention thereof in favors of the People,
against backsliden Rulers both supreme and subordinat, or even in favors of a
part of the People (with the caution subjoyned) against the greater part
wickedly backsliden, let the World judge. Oh! did the wrath of God, for the
hidden and secret sin of one poor acursed Achan, suddenly and fearfully
overtake the whole People, and ALL THE CONGREGATION of Israel, so that, that
man perished not ALONE in his iniquity? and had not our Reformers great reason
to fear and tremble, least the Manifest Tolleration of proud, cruel, and
flattering Prelates, who had perverted the lawful Powers into bloody
Persecuters; and of Idolatours Priests, whose wickedness and Idolatry had
corrupted the whole Land, might involve, not only themselves but the whole
Nation, in destroying and overflowing indignation.

We are not ignorant of the no less wicked then ground less cavils of some, as
if we would make or have every man to be a Phinehas: And what then? Would God
(if wishes, yea prayers and tears could make it) that all his Servants were as
Phinehas, and that he would pour upon every one of them, the same Spirit of
Holy Zeall which was in him, that by removal of the cause, his fierce anger
against this poor consuming Land might cease. But as for that Act of Phinehas,
the terms following being general and ambigous, admitting of several
distinctions and subdistinctions, as it is not easy without distinguishing, in
thesi to define an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call
thereunto, only Heroical; and to state the true specificall Difference and
just limits between an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call
Heroical, as they are strickly taken and contradistinguished; and clearly and
convincingly to demonstrat, what and how much more is required in an
Extraordinary Call to an Extraordinary Action, then is required in a sufficient
Call unto an Heroical Action? and whether an eminent measure of Holy Zeal,
Magnanimity and Fortitude do constitut a sufficient Call unto an Heroical
Action; or do only Dispose and fit the person for the right and better
performance thereof, as a Call unto the Action, and the Fitness of the Person
for doing of the same are contradictinguished; or may not both Dispose and fit
the person for performance of the Action, and also include and give a Call unto
the Action it self: So when the matter is fully considered, it will be more
difficult then perhaps is apprehended, to prove that the Act of Phinehas was
Extraordinary, strickly taken and in contradistinction to that which is only
Heroical; or that his Call thereunto was Extraordinary, in contradistinction to
that which is a sufficient Call unto an Heroical Action; and more difficult to
determine, otherwise then by naked assertion, what that Extraordinary Call was?
Wherein it did consist? Wherein it did differ from, Exceed or Excel a Call
unto an Heroic Action? And therefore, it will be also hard convincingly to
demonstrat, that it might not have been lawfully done by another of the
Children of Israel, whom the Lord had animated thereunto, by the same Holy
Zeall and Resolution. And this is the more considerable, because, as we very
rarely, (if at all) find the Lord commending and rewarding persons for
Extraordinary Actions, whereunto they had Extraordinary Calls, so much and so
highly, as here He Commends and Rewards Phinehas: So the Text it self Numb.
25. does lay the great, if not the only weight and ground of his Commendation
and Reward, upon his ZEALL, and not upon any Extraordinary Call, whereof there
is not the least hint or insinuation; For verse 11. the Lord says, He turned my
wrath away from the Children of ^srael, while he was ZEALOUS for my sake among
them; and therefore verse 12, 13. promises him, His Covenant of peace. a seed
after him, and the Covenant of an Everlasting Priesthood, BECAUSE, he was
ZEALOUS for his God. And if any shall, as it is like some will allege, that
Heroical Actions, are not more Imitable then these which are Extraordinary; It
is humbly offered to be considered, anent Heroical Actions in general,
Whether, when the matter of an Action is not only Ordinary, that is, neither
Preternaturall nor Supernatural, though not very Frequent; but also Just and
Lawful, yea, and Necessary, both by Divine Precept, and as a Mean to a good
and Necessary End; and when either, there is not, or does not appear any other
to do the work, whether, I say, in that case, a Spirit of Holy Zeall,
Magnanimity and Courage, wrought and excited by the Lord in his Servants and
People, more or fewer, being otherwise in a Rational and probable Capacity, be
not for that time a sufficient Call, unto the performance of these Actions
which are commonly called Heroical; and especially when and where, the Action
is not unnecessarily, irrationally, nor in vanity attempted, but may be and is
performed, not only without prejudice of the True, Necessary and Chief Good of
the Church and Commonwealth, or of any particular person's just Right and
security; but also in the case of the Magistrate, and others, their wilful and
perverse neglecting of their duty, is necessarly undertaken, and is not only
formally intended by the Actor, but also natively and really does conduce to
the Glory of God, the Good of Religion, the preservation and establishment of
Church and Commonwealth, and of every particular person's Just Rights and
Security, by suppressing of Impiety, promoving of Truth and Holiness, doing of
Justice, Turning away of wrath and removing of present and preventing of future
Jugdments. And as for the particular instance of Phinehas, if the Lord did not
only raise him up to that particular Act of Justice, but also warrant and
accept him therein, and reward him therefore, upon the account of his Zeall,
when there was a Godly and Zealous Magistrate, able, and whom we cannot without
breach of charity presume, but also willing to Execute Justice; How much more
may it be pleaded, that the Lord, who is the same, yesterday, to day and for
ever, will, not only pour out of that same Spirit upon others, but also when he
gives it, both Allow them though they be but private persons, and also Call
them being otherwise in a Physical and probable Capacity, to do these things in
an Extremely necessitous, and otherwise irrecoverable State of the Church, to
which in a more entire condition thereof, he does not Call them; and
particularly when there is not only the like or worse provocations, the like
Necessity of the Execution of justice and of Reformation, for the turning away
of Wrath and Removal of Judgments, that was in Phinehas case; but also when
the Supreme Civil Magistrate, the Primores Regni and other inferior Rulers, are
not only unwilling to do their duty, but so far corrupted and perverted, that
they are become the Authors and patronizers of these abominations. Which is
also the more considerable, because, if upon the fear or suspicion of the
Accidental hazard of Private men's usurping of the Office, or doing of the duty
of Public persons, every virtue and vertous Action, which may be so abused,
shall be utterly neglected, Impiety shall quickly gain an Universal Empire, to
the extermination of all Goodness. It is true, that the God of Order has
assigned to every man his Station and Calling, within the bounds whereof he
should keep, without transgressing by Defect or Excess; and therein wait and
act, in such a measure of the Spirit as He is pleased to comunicate: And we do
not hold such instances for Regulare and ordinary precedents for all times and
persons universally; which while some have fancyed, and heeding more the glory
and fame of the Action, then the sound and solid Rule of the Holy Scriptures,
they have been tempted and carried to fearful Extravagancies: Neither are
insolent or disorderly much less Wicked attempts, which sometimes have covered
and yet may mask themselves with a pretense of Zeal, upon this or any other
ground to be licenced or approved; But on the other hand, as these instances
hold forth, for the conviction and reproof of our stupidity and indifferency,
what an high pitch of Holy Zeall and Courage, the Servants of the Lord have
sometimes attained, and do further demonstrat, that He does sometimes warrant
even Private persons, in their doing of these things in an Extreme Necessity
and collapsed state of the Church, to which at other times He does not call
them: So when the Lord, with whom is the residue of the Spirit, does breath
upon his people more or fewer, to the exciting of more then Ordinary Zeal,
Courage and Resolution, for the Reforming of an Apostat Church, for the
Execution of justice upon the Adversaries, and for the advancing and
establishing of Truth and Holiness in the Earth, we should rather ascribe
glory and praise to Him, whose hand is not shortened, but many times choiseth
the Weak and Foolish things of the World to confound the Mighty and the Wise,
then condemn His Instruments for Rebels and Usurpers, as it is like Phin^has
would have been, had he lived in this generarion, if the same Lord, who by his
Spirit had Acted him, had not also by his own hand rescued him.

10. As the Right of Self-Defence, mutual Assistance and Reformation, is
properly and only derivable from the grounds adduced; so the Concurse of the
Nobles and Primores Regni, is no ways of absolute necessity, though indeed
singularly conducible for the carrying on thereof. Unto which Concurrence, as
they are doubly obliged, according to that, unto whom much is given, of the
same much shall be required; so, if they shall convert their Power to the
strengthening of the hands of the wicked, they do thereby not only aggravat
their own condemnation, but by their endeavoring to wreath and fasten more
strongly the yoke of wickedness and oppression, they do the rather and more
justify the cause and plea of all the Asserters of Truth and Righteousness.

These are a part of the grounds, whereupon these Noble Worrhies, raised up by
God and eminently by him inspired, did singly act for His own glory: which as
they have left upon record for their own perpetual vindication, so thereby they
did clearly purge themselves from all imputation of Rebellion. Nor were their
proceedings and practices ever by any so much as termed disorderly, except by
such who being altogether indifferent in the Work of God, endeavor by all
means to calumniat and shame them, from being made precedents to their own
prejudice.

Fourthly. It is observable, that though the practices of these first times
were Extraordinary, and to many may appear Disorderly, Yet the faithful men
whom the Lord honored both to Suffer and to Do for His name, did constantly
and boldly charge both the Rise and progress of these disorders, upon the
Persons then in Power and Authority, who, being ordained and entrusted by God,
for the defense and maintenance of Truth and Righteousness, (as the only true
foundations and solid grounds of the Peoples felicity whither temporal or
eternal; and including all the ends, for which either the Power or Persons of
Governors are appointed; and consequently, the principal bonds of all
obedience and subjection, for which all these engadgements are intended, and to
which they do ultimatly refer) by resieling and starting out from this most
sacred and fixed line of subordination; As they could not claim Obedience to
their unjust commands, so, far-less could they oblidge the people, to that more
then slavish and brutish subjection, in the submitting of their souls, bodies
and goods to the arbitriment of their cruel Tyranny, directly contrary unto,
and destructive of all these holy and great Ends, both of Gods Glory, and the
Peoples spiritual and temporal Good, for which they were constituted Governors.

That this was the source and fountain of all disorders in these times, and
that it was so reputed to be, by these valiant Worthies who then opposed them,
the History thereof does plainly verify. We are not forgetful, how vehemently
the Powers on earth, which set themselves against the Lord, and their creaturs
and flatterers, have in all times decryed such assertions: The noise,
belshings, and thundering, of Treason, Treason, wherewith the very mentioning
of such positions, uses at once to be attended and condemned, do already sound
in our ears: Let such as are thereby alarmed, read the debats and
controversies, both of former and later times; Especially these two Martyrs
against Tyranny, Lex Rex, and the Apologetical Narration upon this subject.
This is our peace and establishment before the Lord and all men; that we with
our Noble Reformers do acknowledge and honor Authority as the great Ordinance
of God, for the uphold and maintenance of Truth and Righteousness; and the
Persons therewith vested, not only as eminently thereby dignified, but also as
most signally impressed, by a very sacred and illustrious Character of the
glorious Majesty of the Most High, who has appointed them: But on the orher
hand, we cannot but wish, that these same persons would constantly remember,
that not only they are the Ministers of God, and to Him accountable; but also
his Ministers to the People for their Good, whom they neither ought to
Tyrannize over at their own Pleasure, nor Rule only for their own Profit. O!
that these sacred Boundaries had ever been observed, and that both Tyranny and
Rebellion with all their Antidots and remedies, had been perpetually unknown.
But shall Tyranny, unto which, Power, both in it is self is so easily corrupted,
and by the flattery of others more frequently abused, be not only shrouded
under the privilege and impunity of a Divine Exemption; but thereby, in effect
be more intollerably licenced, to the acting of all wickedness and violence,
and the perverting and overturning of all the ends of Government? And in the
mean time, shall the Peoples most just and necessary Defense of themselves,
(whereunto they are seldom and very hardly provoked, even by the most extreme
necessity) and of all their most precious concernments, the very ends for which
the Powers are ordained, be continually at the Arbitriment of any
Court-Creature or flatterer, proscribed and persecuted under these odious names
of Treason and Rebellion? Certainly, neither the All-wise Providence of God;
not yet the frame of nature can endure such a Solecisme. For our part, as we
are persuaded, that none pleads for this Absolut Submission in the People and
Exemption of the Prince but such as for advancing of their own interest, have
first prostrated their Consciences to the Princes arbitriment, in a blind and
Absolut Obedience; whereby they know themselves sufficiently secured from all
smart and inconvenience, of that more Brutall then Rational submission
contended for: So are we confident, that seeing Subjection is principally
enjoined, for and in order to Obedience, whatsoever Reason or Authority can be
adduced to perswad an absolut and indispensible Subjection, will far more
rationally and plausibly infer an illimited and Absolut Obedience; and that to
plead for a privilege in the point of Obedience, and to disclam it in the
point of subjection, is only the flattety of such, as having renounced with
Conscience all distinction of Obedience, would divest others of all
Privileges, that they may exercise their Tyranny without without control. But
He who has called Rulers, Gods; Does notwithstanding Himself remain the Most
High God over all the Earth; and from his Obedience, neither the Commands nor
Violence of Kings of Clay ought in the least to remove us. And as these
inferior Princes do often forget their Subordination to the Most High, in their
unjust commands; and would usurp His Throne, by an uncontrollable Soverainty;
so the Lord, by the warrant of his Word, and approbation of his Providence, and
also of the People, (when by them oppressed, but by Himself animated and
strengthened) has declared and made void this their pretended exemption and
impunity, and removed the carcases of such Kings and broken their Scepter.
Amongst which precedents, the instance of these times, whereof we now speak, is
worthily recorded, and deserves better to be remembered.

Seeing therefore, that neither the Ordinance and Commission of God, nor yet the
Surrender of the People, though into ane absolut slavery (which yet no
presumption less then their own most Express Consent can possibly infer) can
from any certain and rational ground and warrant, be either produced or pleaded
for vesting the Prince with that arbitrary and irresistible Power and Dominion,
necessary and requisite to oblidge the Subject to a stupid and brutish
submission, to all possible injuries and outrages; and that it is impossible
for any rational man, to concede that Privilege of exemption and impunity to
wickedness and fury, for murdering both the Souls and Bodies of poor Subjects,
which our very adversaries deny to Weakness or Folly in case of Alienation of
the Kingdom or any part thereof, or any such gross act of Mal-versation, and
lastly seeing the great inconvenience, of opening a door to Rebellion and all
disorder, mainly urged by the Adversaries, against the permitting of the People
any judgment or reflection upon the Princes Actings, does more rationally plead
for Implicit and blind Obedience, which they themselves disprove, then militat
against necessary Defense and resistance in case of persecution for lawful
non-obedience; And that the great and true Salvo of all these inconveniences,
and the main establishment of the Throne, is only true judgment and
Righteousness, No sober and impartial person can condemn their position, who
denying that a Tyrannous Magistrate was the Minister of God to them for their
Good, did plainly assert the lawfulness of Self-Defence, and holy Reformation,
without the violation of the Ordinance of God.

But if all these things do not satisfy, Let, 1. the reason of Gods delivering
of the Kingdom to the People and not to the King, with the Law it self, Deuteronomy
27. ver. 14. (which the manner of the Kingdom and in effect of Tyranny, foretold
by the Lord and Samuel 1 Samuel 10. v. 10. by way of dissuasive, did no ways
repeal) 2. The import of the Contract and Covenant betwixt Prince and Subject,
with the unquestionable interpretation and execution thereof, extant in the
records of all Times and Nations; 3. The deed of the People in opposing Saul in
favors of Jonathan* 1 Samuel 14. v. 45. and of the ten Tribes in rejecting of
Rehoboam, 1 King cap. 12. (which though v. 19. i^ be termed Rebellion, yet is
it no more thereby condemned, then good Hezekiah, who is said 2 King 18. ver.
7. to have rebelled against the King of Assyria) and o^ Libna in revolting from
under Iehoram, 2 Cron. 21. 10* 4. The Prophecies, Manner, and Practice of the
most part of the late blessed Reformations. And lastly let the peculiar Right
and Constution of this Kingdom by King and Parliament be considered and
solidly answered; And then will we also subscribe to the condemnation of our
Reformers and crave pardon for this digression.

Upon these grounds and principles did our Noble Ancestors vigorously bestir
themselves, and proceed in the Work of God. And as the Lord was ever with them
while they were with Him, and did mind his work steadfastly in sincerity and
uprightness of heart; so notwithstanding all the fals-hood and faintings which
many discovered, yet the Lord himself did gloriously own it, and ceased not,
until by the fair product of his own glory, in the clear manifestation of his
blessed Evangil, he had without the least prejudice of the fundamental
constitution and rights of Government, to the eternal confutation of all
calumnies and reproaches, put on the Copestone with these joyous, and never to
be forgotten acclamations of Grace, Grace.

Thus in the Year 1560. the Land is enlightened, the blessed Gospel of our Lord
again revealed and restored; in so much, that both by the first General
Assembly of this Church then conveening, and the Parliament then holden, A
large Confession of the true Faith is framed* approved and published.

O! that men would remember, seriously consider and fix in their hearts, the
greatness and excellency of this Work of Grace and Glory, bringing Salvation,
Peace and Goodwil toward men; And manifesting the praise and Glory of God in
the highest; that in the just estimation thereof, they might also duly and
truly ponder discern, approve or reject all things conducing, either to it is
advantage or prejudice. But here is the root of all our sin and misery, that
though this Light, be only our Life; and the Salvation and Redemption thereby
revealed, be no less then the project of God's eternal love, and the subject
of His eternal delight; and was more dear and glorious to our Lord Jesus, then
the bosom of the Father, and all the glory of Heaven; yet men, so greatly and
highly therein concerned, do at best but rejoice therein for a season, and soon
relapse, first into Indifferency and Formality, and then into Error,
Superstition and all Ignorance. This the Devil, the author of all wickness,
knowing and improving to the uttermost, for the advancement of his own Kingdom,
does quickly take advantage of, for setting on work and promoving of that
Mystery of iniquity. Which (springing up in that bitter root of Pride, and
working in the Spiritual power and subtilty thereof) as it began to work very
early in the Christian Church, even amongst the Disciples themselves, in
presence of their and our Lord, (as appears by their contention, who should
be greatest) And notwithstanding all the Grace, Power, and Presence of the
Lord, which appeared in the times that followed, and all the long and violent
persecution, wherewith the Church of God was then exercised; yet continuing
it is motion, did still advance, until attaining it is maturity in the revelation
of the Man of Sin, it filled and overwhelmed the Christian World, with these
strong delusions of Superstition, Idolatry, and all darkness that so long
prevailed therein: So it is the main and only Engine whereby Satan, as in all
other Churches, so in this of Our's* has so actively bestired himself, and
attempted the overthrow of their later Reformations.

These are the causes, why, notwithstanding of that great and glorious Light
which the Lord made to shine amongst us, the true Government and Discipline of
the Church of Christ* (though his own great Ordinance, instituted both for
Fencing and securing of Truth in Purity, and for promoving of the same in
Power; and though by the Light of that same Truth, clearly discovered and
Manifested) through long opposition and many difficulties, did scarce in these
days attain it is establishment.

Yet the Lord, who of his own free Mercy and Grace, did visit us with the
dayspring of his blessed Gospel from on high; did also by his own Power and
Presence, in and with his faithful Servants, at length also complete his work,
and establish his Kingdom over us and his Government amongst us: And so the
Kingdom became the Lord's; even the first fruits of the Kingdoms of the
Earth, unto our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Progress and Period of this work, was from the Year 1560. unto the Year
1592. dureing which space, these things are very observable.

1. So soon as this Church attained to freedom from persecution and contrary
violence, they Assembled in their first National Synod in the Year 1560. by
virtue of that Intrinsic Power and Privilege granted by our Lord unto his
Church, and exercised by his Apostles and their followers; and that without any
question or control: Nor did they so much as petition for the license of the
then Authority, though the same might have been more easily obtained, then the
warrant at that time impetrated for conveening of the Parliament.

2. As they first Assembled, and by virtue of the same warrant, did set on foot
and continue a constant series of their Courts and meetings; (except in so far
as by plain force and violence they were restrained) so they held the same in
the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ only, and in his sole Authority, by Direction
of his Word and Spirit, concluded all their Counsels, Votes and Acts. It Is
true, that they much and long wished for, and thereafter heartily accepted the
countenance and concurrence of the Powers for the time; and that, not only for
Decency, but also as the gracious performance of that promise, Isa. 49. ver.
23. of the favor and assistance of Kings and Queens to the Church in the later
days: But as they were persuaded, that the Lord Jesus (perfect in all his
house) when invested at his exaltation with all Power in Heaven and in Earth,
did make a full grant and Commission of all Gifts and Offices requisite in his
Church, 1 Cor. 12. ver. 28. Ephesians. 4. v. 8. and 11. (Wherein neither King nor
Prince is mentioned) and that there was no Authority wanting to these first
Decrees made at Jerusalem, though emitted upon that simple warrant, Ast. 15.
ver. 28. It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and unto us, (wherein neither King
nor Prince was included,) so did they account it a gross usurpation, for the
Kings on Earth, in place of their promised Patrociny (to which they are
oblidged,) to claim and invade an Overruling Arbitriment in the matters of God
and his Church; and beleev that He who established the distinction and
confirmed their Right, by separating Caesar's things from the things of God,
does also exact the same on their part.

3. The Brethren conveening in these Assemblies, did meet in perfect Parity and
Equality; against which*, the Extraordinary employments and Commissions
delegated to some, upon the account of the particular exigence of these times,
did grant no Privilege or Pre-eminence.

From these three observations, without mentioning the first Book of
Discipline, containing the true grounds and frame of Presbyterial Government,
which was compiled in the Year 8560. and then approved by the whole Church, and
subscribed to by a great many Lords and Counselors, it is evident that
Presbyterial Government was from the beginning of the Reformation constantly
intended, and it is foundation really laid. We need not mention that the Pope's
Authority and all Jurisdiction flowing therefrom, was by Law in the same Year
1560, expressly abrogated and discharged; nor that in these first Assemblies,
greater Benefices were craved to be dissolved, and Prelacy reputed to be only
an Humane Device; nor is it necessary for us to clear, how that Extraordinary
employment of Superintendency, used for a few Years in the beginning, was both
only designed for an Interim, and in it self wholly different from Prelacy, and
was at length rejected as burdensome. All these things are sufficiently
cleared by the late Large Apology.

4. It is observable, that as the Avarice and Power of some, who possessed and
grasped after the Churches Revenues, did, by the procurement of a few packed
Commissioners, in the Year 1671, introduce these Mock-Bishops (called Tulchan)
for the better securing of their own gain, which in the Assemblies immediately
succeeding, were first protested against, then quarrelled, and lastly
restrained and subjected thereunto; So the Lord used the same as a warning, to
awaken and animat his Servants to a more vigorous prosecution of the
establishment of His House in it is due Government: In pursuance whereof, the
Assemblies with the King's concurrence, from the Year 1575 until the Year 1581.
did with much Prayer, Fasting and Painfulness intend the work, until by
perfecting of the Second Book of Discipline, and reducing of the Bishops to a
simple Dimission, and condemning their Office as unwarrantable, they c^mpleated
their work in the exact model of Presbyterial Government, in all it is Courts
and Officers.

5. During this space in March 1581. (as we now reckon) and after the Assembly
had condemned the Office of Bishops as unwarrantable, the King, his Court and
Council did swear and subscribe to the National Covenant; By which both the
Pope's usurped Authority over the Church in one Article, and his wicked
Hierarchy in another, are abjured: And the swearers did join themselves unto
this true Reformed Church, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion and Discipline;
promising by the Great Name of the Lord our God, to continue in the Obedience
of the Doctrine and Discipline thereof all the days of their lives. Which
Discipline, as the foregoing Assertions do clearly discover, to have been from
the beginning fundamentally Presbyterial; so the Model of Presbytery being now
completed, and any shadow of power that the Mock-Bishops had lately usurped,
being now fully abrogated, it is sufficiently clear, that both Prelacy is by
this Covenant abjured, and Presbytery owned and sworn to. And really if it be
further considered, that the Assemblies both 1581. and 1590, while most intent
and forward in the erecting of Presbyteries, did enjoin and require the same to
be subscribed by all ranks of People in the Land, and that these Acts were both
seconded and enforced by Ordinances of King and Council, it may be justly
doubted, whether the impudence of the succeeding Prelates in denying of the
Obligation, or Perjury in breaking of it be greater. This is the Great Oath,
into which, as the Lord God did bring us by the Power of his own Spirit and
Truth, in opposition to that Bloody Bond, called the Holy League, wherein
Antichrist and his followers, had at that time conjured themselves against the
true Church of God; So the Kingdom thereby became the Lords, and we his
peculiar people, as-well by the people's subjecting of themselves and their
Allegiance, as by the King's submitting Himself and his Scepter, in a due
Subordination unto God and our Lord Jesus Christ, for the maintenance and
defense of his Church and Gospel, the Liberties of the Land and Ministration
of Justice. And this Oath and the Ordinances enjoining it, notwithstanding the
many fearful violations thereof that have ensued, do yet stand to this day
unrepealed and declared against, to the unanswerable conviction and
condemnation, even in their own Courts and Consciences, of all it is wicked
Transgressors.

6. As the Tulchan Bishops were the effect and product of the Avarice of these
Lords that favored them; So the same principle of Avarice and Wickedness did
again resist the Work of God, when almost brought to Perfection, by stirring up
certain of the Nobles to re-induce Bishops, for the better inhaunsing of their
Benefices, and the devouring of the Churches patrimony: And not only for their
better establishment, that what they want of Divine Right and Warrant, might be
supplied by the accession of the Kings power and Command; but also that by
their means, the growing wickedness of these times might abound without
restraint or control, the Devil inciteth others of the more profane,
licentious and violent Courtiers, such as the Earl of Arran and his accomplices,
to move and instigat the King, contrary both to the Word and Oath of God, to
usurp the Prerogative of Jesus Christ, who is alone King in Zion, and to invade
His Churches Privileges, purchased for Her with His own Blood, by assuming to
Himself in the first and immediate Instance, the cognition of Her Doctrine and
Censures: Which though the Church did constantly and valiantly oppose, both by
Petitions and Protestations; yet this Wickedness did so impetously proceed,
that all at once in a Parliament summarily called in the Year 1582. the
Prerogative of Our Lord is translated upon the King, and his Jurisdiction and
Empire exalted over all persons and Causes, the Estate of Bishops and their
power and dignity confirmed, and the power of the General Assemblies of the
Church put in the King's hand. We mention not these things with any purpose to
debate these questions, which have been moved on this Subject; Only we are
confident, that how extensive soever the King's power may be in the case of
Reformation (which, Alas! for the most part comes short of it is reach) yet
where a Church is Regularly constituted, and so acting, and by Him sworn to be
maintained, no King or Prince ought so far to intrude Himself into Her Power
and Privileges, unto which he is neither called nor gifted, as to assume to
Himself a Sovereign and immediate power of judging and discerning upon Doctrine,
and her most spiritual Rights and Censures, and thereby in effect not only to
constitut Himself a Proper and direct Church Officer, without our Lords
appointment; but in stead of Papacy so justly abrogated and so solemnly
abjured, to erect and revive the same in Himself (a Secular Person) far more
absurdly and intollerably. We know that other formalities and notions are
pretended, as these of Treason, Sedition, and Disorder, to palliat and color
this Usurpation; but seeing nothing spoken or acted by warrant of the Word of
God, can fall under the definition or pain of these crimes, and that all
Ministers and Ecclesiastic Courts are known, allowed and presumed, both to
speak and act according to that only warrant, and Lastly, seeing both the
warrant is to them committed, and the Church is privileged and permitted to
have it is own proper power and cognition thereanent, as it follows by clear
consequence, that the things questioned, must and ought to be first subjected
to her trial and cognition; so none do deny the Magistrat's just right and
power, over both these things and persons, they being once lawfully found to be
destitut of the warrant pretended. But seeing both Scripture and Reason does
testify against this Usurpation, as most unlawful in it self and injurious to
our Lord Jesus, and that all experiences have proven it to be most pernicious
to His Church and Kingdom, and therefore many of his faithful Servants have
worthily and valiantly resisted it, not only to bonds and banishment, but even
to blood for the Testimony of their Lord and Master; We return to the purpose
of this observation, which is to vindicat the honor of the Lord's Work, and
the memory of his faithful Servants, in the discovery of the old malice and
subtilty of the great Enemy of the Church of God, working in the wicked Prelates
and their abettors; who to the effect they may enjoy their carnal designs,
and prosecute their wicked lusts without control, endeavor mainly by an
absolute surrender of all things, powers, persons and interests, to flatter and
exalt the King unto an illimited Sovereignty, and pretended Omnipotency,
thereby both to oblidge and enable him the more to such acts, deeds, and grants
as are requisite for the satisfying of their vain Ambition, insatiable
Covetousness and wicked lusts: Which Flattery and Usurpation, being not more
agreeable to the vain heart of man, then contrary to the Kingdom of our Lord,
and the Power and Purity of His blessed Gospel, what wonder if his faithful
Servants (who can neither deny His Name, nor dissobey His commands, by
complying with the wicked practices, and the blasphemous flattery of these vile
Apostats) be not only hated of all men; but with their Lord and Master become
the continual object of the reproaches, violence and cruelty of the wicked, as
enemies and rebels to lawful Authority? Now that the World may perceav the
wicked intent and design of this Prerogative, that it is none other then that
of the Devil (as to conciliat and endear the Powers to Prelates, who while they
creat the King's Prerogative, pretend themselves to be the King's only
Creatures; so to arm and animat the same Powers against our Lord and His
followers.) Let it is Rise and Effects both first and last be marked and
observed, and the search will declare, that wicked men lusting to Tyranny and
licentiousness, are checked and galled by the freedom and power of faithful
Ministers in the application of the Holy Word and Spiritual Censures. What
remedy? This freedom is found Treasonable, and prejudicial to the King's
service and Interest, and the plain Zeall of God is therefore taxed as Sedition
and Treason; and under these formalities, the Privileges of the Church are
infringed, and all the asserters thereof lashed with the same calumny:
whereupon and to perfect the cure, the King must be declared IN ALL and OVER
ALL; And by virtue of his fained Omnipotency, and for recovery of that Unity
and Order, which only the coming of our Lord, His blessed Gospel, and Powerful
Ministry is pretended to have disturbed, the Ancient Policy or the Church must
be restored; and the greatest flatterers made the Archest Prelates, who by
inhaunsing and by destroying the Power, may compesce the (pretended) insolency
of the Ministry; and by the continual pretending of Dissatisfaction and
Disloyalty, may terrify men out of all Conscience, until by the introducing of
Will Worship and vain Superstitions, they may extinguish all Light, and thereby
reduce that Golden Age of Order into stupid Flattery, and of Unity into
Implicit Obedience. And if these be not the kind caresses, and most native
issues of Prerogative and Prelacy, and the very restoring and reestablishing of
the Kingdom of Antichrist, he who cannot find it in this Period, will find all
supplied by the next.

7. Though we love not to reflect on Events, and know that no man knows
either love or hatred by all that is before him, yet seeing thereby the Lord's
Judgments are made manifest, men ought both to observe and fear. The
dissastrous ends of all the promoters of Prelates in these days, ( viz: of the
Earl of Morton beheaded; Mr John Douglass Archbishop of St Andrews dying in
the pulpit; the Earl of Arran, after disgrace, privately killed: Mr Patrick
Adamson Archbishop of St Andrews, after recantation and disgrace, dying in
extreme poverty) may justly cause their course the rather to be shunned and
detested: But that which we love rather to observe, is, that as the promoters
and advancers of Prelacy, were always known to be men of no Principles, and
for the most part of very flagitious practices; so the resisters thereof and
favorers of Presbytery, especially the Lord's faithful Ministers in these
days, were not only very eminent in Knowledge, Piety and Holiness, but above
all had that great Testimony and confirmation, which our Lord Himself makes
use of, John 7.18. that they sought not their own glory, and therefore neither
spoke nor did of themselves, but sought His Glory that sent them, and therefore
were true and no unrighteousness was in them. As both their slighting of Court
favors, by which they were much tempted, and their obstinat refusal of
Bishoprics, (whereof King James himself bare them witness,) does Testify.

8. The Lord, whose Work is perfect, and who when He begins will also make
an end, hereafter in the Year 1586. shines through the cloud, dissipateth the
darkness, and after the storm blesses us with a great calm; wherein, the
Assemblies re-assuming their just power, and the matter by the King being
brought to a treaty and Conference, the Bishops are first Restrained, and then
Reduced. Thereafter the order of Presbyteries being set down and perfected in
the Year 1590. both the National Covenant is renewed and subscribed, by Order
of the Secret Council at the Assemblies desire; and all the power that remained
either in Bishops or Commissioners, by the Assembly is devolved upon the new
erected Presbyteries. And thus the Work of the Lord, in the Parl. 12. Iam. 6.
bv the 114. Act. thereof, ratifying Presbyterial Government in all it is
Assemblies, Courts and Officers, qualifying and restricting the former Act.
1584. anent the King's Prerogative, and abrogating all Acts contrary thereto or
inconsistent therewith, and by other Acts there recorded, receaveth it is last
and full accomplishment with Power and Beauty, added to the former Grace and
Glory.

9. That, as only the malice of Satan and wickedness of men, have in all Ages
opposed the establishment of Presbytery; so the Lord, whose great Work and
Ordinance it is, does no less evidently commend it, by making, as on the one
hand, it is sincere and holy severity powerfully to coerce and restrain all vice
and profanity; so on the other hand, the harmonious and orderly Subordination
of it is Courts and Assemblies, most efficaciously to prevent and suppress all
Schism and Heresy: Which both the experience of these and all succeeding times
do most clearly confirm.

But though the Lord had showed us all these great and manifold temptations and
troubles, and terminated them all in such an wonderful and blessed deliverance,
that we might for ever fear His great Name, love His precious Truth, and keep
His holy Covenant; and though in the short Sunshine of that day of Salvation,
He caused both King and People to taste and see the Order, Beauty and Power of
that Establishment; Yet, O! how soon did we forget the Works of the Lord? We
kept not His Covenant. O Lord, the People of thine Inheritance enjoyed it but
a little.

It is not necessary for our design, that we should trace and recount all these
sad steps and degrees, by which the Holy and Wise God thought fit, to bring
back his Church in this Land unto that great distress that hereafter ensued,
and caused her to wander long in a Wilderness of great Desertion; nor what were
the causes and beginnings of that so horrid Defection, (which the Histories of
the most partial pens, whatever provocations they pretend to be in the Lord's
faithful Ministers, cannot purge nor palliat from a mere design of carnal
Policy,) carried on by manifest Di^simulation and palpable fraud. It is enough
for us, (let the true Histories of these proceedings be examined, and it will
appear without the help of our obsevation,) that, as the beginnings of that
Defection were no other then the Unfaithfulness of Man, and the inconsistence
of the Wisdom of God with the carnal wisdom of this World, and that old
opposition and rooted prejudice of the Kings and Powers of the Earth, who have
for the far greatest part set themselves, and taken counsel against the Lord
and against His Anointed; so for the unquestionable confirmation of all that
has been said, either as to the wicked Rise or woeful Effects of Prelacy in
this Church, the Devil's part therein was visibly to promote his own Kingdom,
by re-acting the most palpable and gross Mystery of Iniquity that can possibly
be described: In so far as this Apostasy arising from small beginnings, by fair
and smooth pretensions, crafty insinuations, Court-flatteries, false calumnies
and suggestions, open and gross perjuries, and violent dissorders, according to
the working of Satan; After great and long opposition by Conferences, Warnings
and petitions, and faithful and constant Testimonies and sufferings of the
Zealous Witnesses of our Lord, both unto bonds, banishment, and Sentences of
Death, against the again aspiring Prerogative and usurping Prelacy under it is
shadow, did in the secret and holy Judgment of God, chang the Glory of God
and of our Lord Jesus into the Similitude and Image of the Roman Beast, turning
the Power of Godliness unto Formality, his faithful Ministers into corrupt
Hirelings, the Power and Life of Preaching into Flattery and Vanity, the
Substance of Religion into empty and ridiculous Ceremonies, the Beauty and
Purity of the Ordinances into Superstitious Inventions of Kneeling, Crossing,
Holy Days and the like, the Beautiful and Powerful Government of Gods House
for the Edification of Souls, to a Lordly Dominion over Consciences and violent
Persecution of men's persons; And in a word, the great End of the Glorious
Gospel and it is Blessed Ministry, even the salvation of poor sinners, which is
the pleasure of the Lord, the fruit of the travel of His Soul, the Joy of
Heaven, the Crown and Glory of the blessed Apostles, and the End of all things,
and of the second Appearance of the Great God, into an Empty Title, and
specious pretext for the fulfilling of men's lusts and pleasures, the
establishing of their Power and Tyranny, and the ruin and exterminion of all
such as opposed, and mourned for all these Abominations.

Thus, this Work and Kingdom of Darkness did advance apace, and had almost
attained unto it is full maturity, of hurrying this poor Land and Nation
headlong, into that Gulf of Confusion, Error and Superstition, whereinto Popery
did formerly involve us, when it pleased the Lord, according to His Great Mercy
and faithfulness, to remember His Covenant though we had fearfully forgotten
it; and in the midst of that growing darkness and those manifold Confusions to
cause His Spirit to move, and Light to arise upon this Land, about the middle
of the Year 1637. Which appearing in the former Power and Glory, did from a
very small and improbable beginning, even the opposition of a few weak Women to
the introducing and reading of that Carcass of formality, the Service Book,
then ready to be imposed, proceed in such an Univer^al, Vigorous, Regular and
Powerful method through the whole Land, without the least mixture and
ingredient of force and Violence, but only by these most warrantable and
inquestionable means of Petitioning, Remonstrating, Protesting, and renewing
their Covenant with God and amongst themselves, that before the end of the Year
1638. the Work of God was revived with more Glory and Splendour, then ever
formerly it had attained. We know that not only the Renewing of the Covenant,
especially with the enlargement explaining the same, in order to the Novations
in Worship and Corruptions in Government, whereunto this Church had
Apostatized, and the bond of Mutual Defense thereto added; but also their
Protestings and joint Petitionings have been condemned as Seditious and
Rebellious: But seeing the same, both from the clear Word of God, the pure Light
of Nature, the Zealous and Valiant Practices of our first Reformers, and the
Laws and Constitutions of the Realm are clearly warranted; And by the Power
and Presence of God were signally approved; and by the supervenient Acts of the
King, Parliament, and General Assembly so fully established and confirmed; And
seeing that they only were and are condemned by such, as either being the
Children of the Devil, filled with all subtilty and mischief, and enemies of
all Righteousness, cease not to pervert the right Ways of the Lord; or by such
who for advancement of their own Interests, have sacrificed all Conscience and
Reason to Ambition and Covetousnes; or by such who in base and open flattery of
the King and of the Powers, and neither knowing nor regarding any other
Interest or Concernment, then that which depends on their Pleasure, do set
and serve the same in place of the most High; Or lastly, by such who never did
nor do concern themselves in such enquiryes, but affect a pretended Gallantry
in Gallio's Indifferency, therefore, remitting such as are further desirous of
satisfaction, unto the debats and Papers of these Times, and especially unto
the late large Apology, we shall only mention the steps and progress of the
Lords Work, and our Engagements therein, according to our first purpose.

In the beginning of the Year 1638. great multitudes of people consisting of
all Ranks, being awaked by the Arbitrary imposing of a Service Book, more
corrupt in some things then that of England, and the Book of Canons, and the
erecting and violent exercing of the High Commission-Court, to the perverting
of the Pure Worship of God, the utter subverting of all regular Government, and
the confounding of all things Divine and Humane, and the destroying of our
Civil Liberties; and conceaving the true cause of all the abounding Sin, and
imminent calamities of these Times, to be the violation of the National
Covenant, formerly thrice sworn in the Land, they again most Solemnly, with a
very wonderful and gracious mixture of Tears and joy, renew the same almost in
all parts of the Land, with the addition above mentioned, to forbear the
practice and approbation of all Innovations in Worship, or Corruptions in
Government, until the same should be lawfully determined, and that other of
Mutual Defense and Assistance, in the prosecution of the ends of that Covenant,
against all sorts of persons whatsoever. And in November the same Year, the
General Assembly at Glasgow determined anent the foresaid novations and
corruptions, disproving and rejecting under these heads, the five Articles of
Perth, the Government of the Church by Bishops, the erecting of Prelacy
therein, and all the Corruptions flowing therefrom, whereby the Oath of the
Covenant is clearly explained and purifyed.

In the Year 1639. the Prelates being routed, run to Court, (...) up the King,
England and Irland with all their Friends and Popish partakers in Scotland,
against the faithful Covenanters, as Rebellious and Seditious Persons: But they
having prepared for their own just Defense, the Lord by His outstretched Arm
and Power, dispelling all these menacing clouds and imminent storms, does by a
Pacification concluded, reduce a fair calm; The King therein aggreeing that an
Assembly and Parliament shall be held, and that all matters respectively shall
be therein determined. The Assembly sitting in August thereafter, the Kings
Commissioner being present and assenting, does ratify the conclusions of the
last Assembly at Glasgow, and the Commissioner and Secret Council subscribe the
Covenant, as it was then explained; and at the Petition of the Assembly, it is
enacted to be again subscribed for the Fifth time, by the Body of the whole
Land. But no Faith, Honesty, nor Honor binding the Prelates and a Court by them
overruled; in the Year 1640. the King and Prelates vigorously arm again, and
prepare for a new war: But this intended War is composed by a new Pacification,
and in the mean time, the Parliament (formerly adjourned until June 1640) does
conveen at the time appointed, and by their fourth, fifth and sixth Acts fully
establish Presbyterial Government; ratify the Covenant, with the Addition and
Explanation of the Assembly, and all Acts made thereanent; and abrogat the
Estate of Bishops, and all Acts whatsoever made in their favors.

Thereafter, in the Treaty ensuing the Pacification, it is agreed that the Acts
past in the last Parliament, with these to be made in the next Session thereof,
shall be published in the King's Name, and have the strength of Laws in all
time coming: Which Treaty being closed, and the last Session of the
abovementioned Parliament sitting in the Month of June 1641. the King in
person being present among them, and the Oath of Parliament (for maintenance of
Religion in purity as then established, and of the King's Authority, and the
Peoples Liberties according to the Covenant; and for endeavoring by all just
and humble means, of Union and Peace betwixt the three Kingdoms) appointed to
be taken by that, and all succeeding Parliaments, being taken; by the second
Act thereof, superscribed by the King and subscribed by the President, the
foresaid Treaty is amply and perpetually confirmed, and the whole Articles
thereof are ratifyed and recorded.

Thus, by all the Security, that either Sacred Oaths; or Acts of Lawful and
Authorized Assemblies; Ordinances of King and Council; doubled and re-iterated
Pacifications and Treaties; Acts of Parliament Enacted and Re-enacted; the
Kings Authority and Consent being often and solemnly interposed, both by
promise and hand-writ; And all that either Religion, Truth, Faith, Honor or
Honesty could devise or grant, these Wicked Prelates are cast out of this Church
and Kingdom, Presbyterial Government fully established, the pure Worship of
God, with His pure and powerful Ordinances and Ministry restored, and in the
maintenance and pursuance of all these great Blessings, the whole Land, by many
Oaths and most Solemn ties, engaged unto the Lord for ever.

By all which Blessings, and the restoring of the Lord's own Ordinances amongst
us, as the Work of the Gospel and the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, in the
Conversion of many thousands, were greatly advanced, and the Glory of God, in
the abounding of true Piety and flourishing of Righteousness, did eminently
shine amongst us; (as the memory of these times in all such as fear God and
love our Lord Jesus Christ does sweetly testify) so all these great things were
transacted, to the perpetual shame and confusion of all our calumnious
Adversaries, without any diminution of his Majesty's just Authority and
Greatness.

As the Power and Glory of the Lord was great in this Land; so the splendour and
fame thereof reaching unto other Nations, it pleased the Lord thereby to
provoke His People in England, at that time grievously groaning under the
Tyrannous yoke of Prelacy, and justly alarmed by the imminent fears of
prevailing Popery, to set about and intend the like blessed Reformation.

It does not concern us, to reflect on the Causes and beginnings of that War
betwixt the King and Parliament there, nor what were the transactions betwixt
the two Kingdoms in order to that Aid and Assistance given by Scotland, and how
the same was managed: But this is certain, that, upon the Representation of
the most just and important grounds, of the maintenance of Religion and
Liberty, against the prevailing power of Popery, Prelacy and Tyranny in that
Kingdom of England; and their most instant and earnest desires for our help and
Assistance; and the most rational and clear motives of our own Security, (the
hazard and loss whereof had undoubtedly been the consequence of the Prelates
Victory there) this Kingdom was induced in the Year 1643. to enter into that
Sacred Bond of the Solemn League and Covenant, never to be forgotten,
containing no other Articles then every one's Sincere and constant endeavors,
in their several places and callings, for the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in this Church, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government; the
Reformation of the same in England and Ireland, according to the Word of God,
and the example of the best Reformed Churches; and the nearest Conjunction and
Uniformity of all the three in Truth, Faith, and Love; the extirpation of
Popery, Prelacy, Error and Profanity; the preservation of the rights and
Liberties of the People, and of the Kings person and Authority in defense of
the true Religion, and the Kingdom's Liberties; the Discovery and the
punishment of Incendiaries; the retaining of the Peace and Union of the
Kingdoms; the mutual assistance and defense of all entering into this League;
and the performing of all duties we owe to God, in the amendment of our lives,
and in walking exemplarly one before another: And all these in order to no
other end, then the Glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ; the Honor and Happiness of the King and his Posterity; and the true
Liberty, Safety and Peace of the Kingdom.

This is that Covenant, which in all the controversies it has occasioned, did
never receave a greater confirmation, then from the malice and opposition of
it is adversaries; who in the same Spirit and with the same Spite, have always
persecuted and reproached it, with the same Calumnies of Rebellion, Sedition
and Blood, which from the beginning, the Devil has ever been most active to
raise and stir up against the Lord Jesus, his Gospel, Kingdom and Followers.
But seeing such only as are blessed, do evite the offense of Truth; and all who
truly seek Gods Glory or Love the Lord Jesus, did and still do heartily
approve and embrace this Covenant: though it had brought the Sword not only
into Britain, but with the Truth into all the Earth; though it were reproached
as unfriend not only to our King, but with our Lord Jesus to Caesar and all the
Kings of the Earth; though it had divided and disturbed not only Realms and
States, but with the Gospel, families and nearest relations; and had with Paul
moved Sedition throughout the whole World, we ought not thereby to be either
shaken or offended. We know also, that all the subtilty and malice of Hell have
been set on work, and spared no calumny or cavillation, by which either it is
Words, Matter or Manner might be impugned: But these are so often and fully
answered, and, without the assistance of any man's Patrociny, by the obvious
plainness of it is Phrase, the Holiness and Importance of it is Purpose, and the
Justice and Necessity of it is way and Manner, so clearly confuted, that nothing
can be added. Only seeing the Constancy of Truth, ought not to cede to the
Confidence of prevailing Powers, as we have asserted and do hold, the subject
matter of this League and Covenant to be in it self Holy, Just and True; so we
cannot but disprove the dangerous Method of some, who the better to enforce the
obligation of the Oath of God, do suppose the Matter thereof, especially as to
that article against Prelacy, to be antecedently Indifferent, and not
determined either by the Word of God or any other Moral Precept: Justly
apprehending how easily in this light and backsliding time, such suppositions
may become positions; and that the obligation of the Oath of God, now so much
violated and little regarded, may be found too weak to secure men's
stedfastness. As we are therefore persuaded, and would have all to consider and
fix it in their hearts, that this wicked Prelacy and it is Hierarchy, are not
only contrary to the Word of God, to the Practice of the Holy Apostles, to
sound Doctrine and the Power of Godliness; (under which express consideration
we are also sworn to endeavor it is extirpation,) but by the sad experience of
all Ages in the Christian Church, especially in these our later times, had been
found most pernicious to all Truth and Righteousness, and the main Engine and
Device, whereby the Devil has always labored, to advance his Kingdom of
Darkness; and therefore has been the great butt and aim, for the overthrow
whereof, the great Work of God in this Land, has been so Powerfully and
Gloriously manifested: so do we most constantly hold, that as well this Article
against Prelacy, as all the rest contained in this Holy Covenant, were and are
antecedently oblidging both to King and People, without the supervention of
either Oath or Promise; and that the rooting out of Prelacy, and the wicked
Hierarchy therein so obviously described, is the main duty, in the endeavor
whereof, (as most advantageous unto all these great and holy Ends proposed by
the Covenant) all the Zeal of the faithful ought to be concentred.

As for such profane Jugglers, who neither considering this Oath and Covenant
as a special Ordinance and blessing of God, whereby we are more effectually
stirred up and enabled, to the performance of all the duties of Religion and
Righteousness therein contained; nor knowing that this Covenant made with God,
and accepted by Him, is also the Lords Covenant with us, for the securing and
establishing unto us, all the great Blessings and Privileges therein
expressed, and that, as we therein do avouch the Lord to be our God, so does He
avouch us to be His People, Do from the Righteousness and Necessity of it is
matter, vainly argue the superfluity of any accessory Obligation, and would
thence infer, that the same may be the more easily dispensed with or renounced:
We de only remit them to that Solemn Covenant Deuteronomy. 29.10. etc. made there
betwixt the Lord and His People, and thereafter so often renewed, only for
their greater Engagement to the most necessary duties of God's express commands.

We come in the next place, unto the Manner and Form of this League and
Covenant; wherein, not purposing to resume the many debates that have been
raised anent it, we shall only take notice, that these old Acts and Laws viz.
Act. 43. Parl. 6. of Mary 1555. and Act. 12. Parl. 10. Iam. 6.1585. made
against Leagues and Bands contracted without the Kings consent, are now
obtruded with the force and luster of a new Act. cap. 4. of the last
Parliament, to condemn the Covenant, as from the beginning Unlawful and
Rebellious: But as these old Acts, at the time of the entering into this League
and Covenant, did then stand explained by the 29. Act. Parl. 2. Charl. 1.
ratifyed and authorized by the King himself, in a sense most consistent with
the Covenant, and could no ways render the same from the beginning unlawful,
much less could the revival thereof in their greatest rigor, or the
superveniency of any other Act thereanent, dissolve the Sacred Obligation of
this Oath once lawfully contracted; so the reason of the former answer made to
this objection, and the Justice and Equity of that Act. 29. P. 2. C. 1. whereby
the same was declared, remains in full force, viz. that no League nor Bond
made by the Subjects for maintenance of Religion, Liberty, and the Public good
of Church or State, was or can be understood, to be prohibited by these old
Acts and Laws objected. Because, as the makers of such Bonds, cannot be reputed
to be movers of Sedition, to the breach of the public peace, (which is the
express reason and certification of these old Acts objected) so both the King
and his Government, being appointed for the preservation of these great ends
and Interests, and He himself principally oblidged, both by the Command and
Oath of God upon him, to authorize all such bonds. Covenants, and other means
which may advance the same; It were a gross Paradox both in Reason and
Religion, that the King's neglect of his duty and perverting of his Office, to
the overthrow of these ends for which he is ordained, should therefore oblige
the People to a sinful Compliance and stupid connivance, to the high Dishonor
of the Great God and King of Kings, and the utter ruin of the souls, bodies,
and fortuns of themselves and their Posterity. It Is true, it may be and is
replied, that this answer and reasoning, does proceed from an unjust jealousy
of Kings, and is founded upon an intolerable presumption in the Subject to
censure and judge their actings: But seeing the entering into this Covenant,
and into all others which we allow, was so far from proceeding upon an unjust
jealousy, that on the contrary, it was in a manner extorted, by the force of
the most palpable and rational necessity that can be imagined; and seeing the
feeling and discerning thereof, is so far from that criminal presumption
alleged, that to disprove it, is in effect to deny both sense and reason,
unless our adversaries can prove that notwithstanding thereof, the King is by
God the Lord, vested with such an uncontrollable Dominion and Sovereignty, that
whatever Violence, Outrage, or Cruelty he commit, the People are obliged by a
patience, or rather stupidity greater then that of Beasts, to endure without
gain saying, it is impossible for them to establish the Tyranny that they
contend for. But that the World may see, that such objections are only the
wicked flattery of selfish men, and how little they do therein either use or
regard Reason, in the late Act abovementioned made against Leagues and
Conventions, it is declared, that the explication contained in the Act 1640.
viz. That such Leagues and Conventions as are made by Subjects, for the
preservation of the King, Religion and the Laws, are not prohibited by these
old Acts, is false and disloyal, and contrary to the true and genuine meaning
thereof: which Declaration is not only a naked Assertion, and contrary to the
express reason and certification of these old Acts, which is before set down;
but so blind and irrational, that in case of an Interregnum, or the incapacity
of the King to give His consent to any Bond, Meeting or Convention, which in
such a case may be absolutely necessary, it leaves no issue or expedient.

It is not needful here to clear the necessity and advantages, which may induce
Subjects to the making of Leagues and Conventions in certain cases, without the
consent of the Prince; nor the exigence of these Times for the Covenant we
plead for: These things are cleared by undeniable Records, which, all the Wars,
Blood and Confusions that thereafter ensued, (flowing either from the perverse
and obstinate opposition, violence, and Persecution of the enemies of Truth, or
being the effect of Gods Righteous Judgment upon such whose hearts were false,
and proved unstedfast in His Covenant,) notwithstanding all the present
insulting of the Adversaries, does nothing disprove. Neither do we here resume
the above mentioned practices of our first Reformers, for justifying the case
in hand, and the explication of these old Acts here obtruded; who, by all their
necessary Leagues, Bands and Conventions, never conceaved the same to be
contraveened: Only we cannot but regret, that, as the Act made in the last
Parliament against Conventions and Bonds, was a fearful step of the present
great Apostasy, and directly levelled against the same Covenant, by which the
Authors of the Acts themselves were and are indissolubly obliged; so that old
Act Parliament 10. Ja. 6. cap. 12. 1585. which is thereby ratifyed and revived,
was also one of the woeful Acts and effects of the wickedness that then
prevailed in the Land, and does relate to and is expressly founded upon the 43.
Act. Queen Mary, Parliament 6. 1555. which, under the color of discharging
Bonds of Man-rent, was by the Queen Regent, then raging in Persecution against
the Professors of the Truth, directly intended for the overthrow of the Gospel
and Congregation.

We have hitherto only justified the lawfulness, or rather the necessity of the
Covenant; as a League amongst Subjects without the Princes consent, and have
not spoken thereto as a League with England, and the Subjects of an other
Kingdom: Because, as the first point is mainly denied by the Adversary; so the
same being proven, upon in the same grounds (first, of Just and Necessary
Defense of our Selves, Religion and Libertyes; Secondly, of the assistance that
we owe and do expect in case of Persecution for Truth, from all Christians in
the bowels of Jesus Christ, the obedience of his new and special command of
Love, and the remembrance of that great and last Judgment, wherein by this
Law, all men shall be judged, without respect to the difference of Nations and
Kingdoms; and thirdly, upon the ground of the Glory of God, which is the great
end of all things, and to which all inferior duties of Submission and
Obedience ought to cede) the Justice and Necessity of the Covenant and League
with England may be certainly concluded. O! that men, who weighing all things
in the balance of their own selfish Interests and designs, do make the vain
and airy enjoyment of Court-favour, and the evanishing possession of such
advantages, as may be acquired thereby, preponderate and cast the scales, in
prejudice of these great and important concernments of the Glory of God, and
the advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, Might yet be awakened by the
terror of that dreadful and glorious Judgment of the last day, to an impartial
consideration of that duty, which we owe to all these that suffer and are
persecuted for Truth. Surely if not visiting, not relieving and supporting
(when it is in our power,) of the afflicted members of Jesus Christ, shall then
be the condemnation of the Reprobat, (against which the exception of a contrary
command of any King or Prince, or that the afflicted were by men for Truths
sake declared Rebels and Traitors, or were of an other Kingdom, shall furnish
no defense) Can we in conscience think, that the refusal of Assistance to the
persecuted for Christ's sake, when instantly thereto required, shall be, upon
any of these pretended grounds, excused in that day?

We do not here mention the supervenient consent and Authority of the King, by
which the alleged defects, to the acknowledgement of all our adversaries, were
clearly purged: because (though the same will afterward fall in, as a great
accession to the conviction of all Apostats, yet) we bless the Lord who has
bottomed our Faith and Consciences upon more sure and fixed foundations; and
who gave His People more evident and gracious testimonies of His Favor, Power
and Presence, while they sincerely walked conform to the grounds mentioned,
before the King's assent was obtained, then ever since.

The entering into and taking of this Covenant, was so much the more necessary
and Praiseworthy in us in Scotland, for several reasons, 1. because it
contains no other then the same Duties and obligations, which were before by us
so solemnly Covenanted to, in our National Covenant: neither is the
restriction of our Allegiance, supposed to be made therein, any other then the
true and righteous qualification of all such engagements, most consonant unto
and approven by our first Large Confession of Faith Chap. 25. Anent the Civil
Magistrate; the Kings Coronation Oath recorded, Ia. 6. p. 1. cap. 8. and the
National Covenant, as it was taken and subscribed both first and last: And
though our Adversaries have insulted upon the later Confession of Faith, as if
both our former principles and practices were thereby disproved; yet let the
words be considered. Viz. Infidelity or difference in Religion does not make
void the Magistrat's Just and Legal Authority, nor free the People from due
obedience, And we are confident, that no sober man will think the
acknowledgement of just and legal Authority and due obedience, a rational
ground, to infer that Tyranny over either Consciences or Persons, is thereby
either allowed or privileged; which is all that by us is contended for.

2. Because the same National Covenant did powerfully oblige us thereunto: not
only upon the account of that obstinate opposition, which the perfidious
Prelates in England, both by raising Wars and breach of Pacification, had
plainly testified; the revival whereof, in case of any probable Capacity, we
had just reason to apprehend, and by a posterior League, (at that time, a most
necessary and probable remedy,) in pursuance of our former engagement, to
provide against; but also in respect of that express ground of opposition to
the bloody bond of Trent, and of the detestation of all the enemies of Gods
Church, who thereby conjured themselves against it, contained in the National
Covenant: which could not but be a very fair persuasion and strong inductive,
to engage in that sacred Bond of the solemn League and Covenant, against that
same accursed conjuratio^, which at that time appeared so active

3. Because the Oath of Parliament, first taken in the Parliament 1641. the
King being present, obliging us to endeavor the preservation of the Peace and
Union of the three Kingdoms, did indispensibly oblige us to enter in this
Covenant, as a most necessary expedient thereto.

Having thus summarily reviewed, both the Matter and Manner of this Solemn and
important League and Covenant, we cannot but wonder at the poor Sophist^y of
such, (especially that more Temporizing then Seasonable Casuist,) who delude
themselves in so great matters unto such an Indifferency, as to assert, that
this Covenant does as necessarily depend upon the King's consent for it is
establishment, as the private vow of a Daughter in her Father's house, or of an
Wife under her Husband's power, in things free and arbitrary, though not
absolutely in their own disposal, did according to the Judicial Law of the
Jews, fall under the Father and Husband's power of ratifying or annulling: But
the simple proposal of these cases, does hold out such a disparity both as to
the Persons, (being only women under power,) the Things in themselves, being
free, but at another's disposal, and many other Circumstances tedious to insist
on, and even as to Law it self by which the case is determined, being merely
Judicial, that none who fear the Lord, or mind His Glory in any measure of
Sobriety, will daigne it with an answer. And such indeed are the rest of the
Cavils and Calumnies, wherewith the Adversaries of Truth have endeavored to
impugn and asperse this Holy Covenant; and are so fully and often answered
already, that to account them worthy the resuming and refuting, were in some
sort after Vows to make inquiry.

There is one thing that our Adversaries have frequently objected, which we
cannot ommit, viz. that the Covenants, both National and Solemn League were
urged and pressed, both by Church Censures and Civil Sanctions, of loss of
goods, sequestration and other arbitrary pains, which has been heavily
complained of, as a great violence done to Conscience: But as it was then too
evident,* that this Privilege of Conscience, was for the most part only
pretended by such, as had little or no feeling thereof; so the Practice of the
present times, does now fully discover, that what is now so insolently
retorted, was never before really scrupled at. But the lawfullness of the
course and practice then used, and the iniquity of this retortion will easily
be cleared, if it be considered, 1. that the National Covenant, being a
standing, and binding Oath upon the whole Land, and in the Year 1638. only
renewed with such an agreeable explanation, as none could or did quarrel, but
such as thereby intended, to palliate and persist in their proceeding manifest
violations, was according to the example of good Josiah, (who brought back the
People, and CAUSED them stand to the Covenant of their Fathers, 2 Chronicles.
34.32.) most justly commanded, and under the pains due to the breach thereof,
ordained to be re-taken. 2. That the solemn League and Covenant, containing no
other obligements, then what the National does import, and being a most
conducible expedient, both for the securing and prosecuting the ends thereof,
and whereunto, the National Covenant upon this ground did clearly oblige, The
pressing of the same League, is warranted not only by the former ground; but
from the very bond of the National, became an indispensible Duty: By which
reasons, as the former proceedings are clearly justified, so the present
practice, (as being a direct and violent ranversing of these things, which were
once so righteously and rationally established) is the more condemned. But
whatever be the disparity of these cases in the point of Reason, we are sure
that light and darkness do not more differ, then the Lenity of these former
times, from the Rigor and violence now practiced; and that where one then
suffered for obstinacy against the Covenant, hundreths do now suffer for their
stedfastness therein.

As for these Wars and great commotions, that ensued upon this great
Transaction of the Solemn League, we will not thereon insist: Only we are
confident, that nothwitstanding all the Calumnious constructions of our
Adversaries, al such as seek out and have pleasure in the Works of the Lord,
will applaud unto the Glory and Righteousness thereof; who, as by the sword of
Apostats in the Years 1644, and 1645. He did punish in his Justice, the
Hypocrisy and Self-seeking of such in this Land, whose hearts were not upright
in His Covenant, and thereafter in the Year 1648. did by a prevailing Sectarian
Party, restrain and crush the gross and General Apostasy then intended, under
an Hypocritical pretext of pursuing the ends of the Covenant, at that time so
palpably perverted and abused; so, for the manifestation of his own Glory, and
of His Mercy to them that fear him and did not forget his Covenant, He did
intermix several gracious Intervals of His abundant Compassion; and at length
did give unto His Work and People, a full and absolute Victory over that
malignant Spirit and Party, that had so long prevailed in the Land, and caused
the wickedness of the wicked to cease, and all iniquity to stop it is mouth.

Thus in the Years 1649, and 1650. and thereafter, the Lord was with us while
we were with Him, and while we sought Him, He was found of us; but as we did
forsake Him, so did He also forsake us: by which position, all the mixture and
varieties, both of our Actings and Gods Providence in these times, may clearly
be resolved.

There was indeed at that time in the Land, not only a party Faithful unto God,
and zealous for His Name; but also a great Zeal of God, from clear knowledge
and sad experience, generally and solemnly professed before God and all men in
our Public Acknowledgement Anno 1649: In consequence whereof, the League and
Covenant was also by the whole Kingdom renewed that same Year. And in answer
thereunto, the Lord did mightily both save and defend us from all our
Adversaries: and as He soon subdued our Enemies at Stirling, and turned His
Hand against our Adversaries in the North, and caused the haters of the Lord
faign submission unto Him; so, for His own Glory, the establishment of His
People, and the utter confusion of His Adversaries, He did highly advance His
blessed Work, by the accession of all these Advantages, with the Defect
whereof, it had been formerly calumniated.

The Advantages we here mention are (besides that Public Acknowledgement then
made, and in the deep sense thereof, the League and Covenant solemnly again
renewed and taken, whereby our Engagements were not only doubled, but strongly
confirmed) 1. These many necessary and righteous Laws enacted in the then
Parliaments, both for the ratifying the later large Confession of faith, and
the larger and shorther Catechisms, agreed unto by both Kingdoms, and for the
restraining and coercing of Impiety and Blasphemy, the encouragement of the
Ministry, and for the promoving of Godliness. Amongst which Acts, that
abolishing Patronages, deserves a more special and commendable remembrance:
Not only because of the many woeful Effects and Abuses of Patronage, as it then
was (and now is) exercised, whereby frequently, Godly men and in some measure
qualified for the Work of the Ministry were (and are) unjustly restrained from
laboring therein; Many Congregations needlessly continued desolate, without
afixed Ministry; Many Naughty men and utterly insufficient, at the sole
arbitrament of Patrons, violently obtruded upon the People, without and against
their own consent; Presbyteries constrained (contrary to the Rule of the Holy
Scriptures) to ordain men, whom the People neither choised, nor could
cheerfully receave; Foundations of prejudice and strife, betwixt Pastor and
People laid, whereby the one cannot preach nor the other hear with profit;
Symoniacal Pactions often basely made betwixt Patrons and the person presented,
to the disgrace of the Holy Calling as-wel as to the sin and shame of the
Persons; And the Ministry of too many, in dispencing of Word, Sacraments and
Censures, made to depend too much upon the Will and pleasure of Man: But also
because, it has no Precept in the Word of God, nor Example in the old Jewish,
nor new primitive and pure Christian Church, to warrant it; because,
Intentionally and Natively it spoileth the People of that Right and Privilege,
in Electing their own Pastors, which Scripture and Reason allows; And
because, being the Patron's (pretended) Heritage, and therefore, by him
vendible to whom he pleases, the whole and sole Power of Presenting of
Ministers, Planting of Churches, Preaching of the Gospel, and settling
Maintenance, may be turned over unto, and put in the hands of men, not only
Profa^e and Strangers to both Church and Commonwealth, but also pro^es^ed
Enemies of the Truth, yea, even Papists or Pagans. And therefore, (being in
itself a grievous and unwarrantable Burden; destructive of the Church and
Peoples Liberties; obstructive of the free course of the Gospel; the Freedom,
Power and Plainness of the Ministry; and occasional of much base Flattery and
Partiality, under which, from the very times of Superstition which introduced
it, the Church did heavily groan) it must needs be so much the greater Blessing
to be delivered from it.

The second Advantage which the Lord's work received, was by that great and
long Transaction with the King in order to His return, and Admission to the
Government; which at length, after repeated Addresses, many Treaties, and the
interposing of Foreign States and Princes, produced the King's Approbation and
Allowance of the National and Solemn League and Covenant: Which both by his
great Oath unto the Most High God, and his hand-writ and Subscription, he most
amply assured, promising in the same manner to advance and prosecute their
Ends, and to seek and procure the establishment thereof, and of Presbyterial
Government, and of the whole work of God in all his Dominions. We know our
Adversaries, persisting in their old malice, disown and exclaim upon this
Transaction as most disloyal and insolent, for Subjects (whose part is only to
surrender and submit,) to require and enter into Treaties with their Prince:
But 1. as these reproaches are from the same wicked Spirit, false grounds, and
base and carnal ends, which from the very times of popery, have resisted, and
been objected against the Work of Reformation in this Land; so do we thereto
oppose, (in full assurance before God and all the World,) these solid and
evident reasons and warrants, whereby not only these Treaties and Transactions
with the late King, but all these old Contracts and Agreements betwixt the then
Powers and People, (which in some sort, are the very foundation of the
Protestant Religion in this Realm) are justified and approven: wherein if there
be any disparity, the difference of a King upon His Throne actually Exercing,
from a Prince only ascending thereto, must cast the advantage on our side. 2.
Seeing there is no Voluntary Kingdom, which is not both erected, sustained, and
continued by a Fundamental Contract, and no Right thereto so good (though even
that of Divid himself and His Posterity, who held the Kingdom, both by
inmediate grant, and interposed Oath of the Most High,) which is not settled and
confirmed by this agreement, 2 Samuel 5.3. 2 Kings. 11.17. can any rational man
disprove or condemn Treaties so naturally antecedent and previous thereto. 3.
The reason and necessity of this Treaty is so dependent upon the preceding War
with the last King, in which (as-well as in his Kingdoms) this King did
succeed him, that, seeing it can have no opposers, but such as therein were
enemies, we willingly refer hoth the cases to the determinations of the same
reasons. And as for such who asserting the Covenant, and the Justice of the
long Parliaments War, do nevertheless disprove our procedure in this Treaty, as
their misinformation does not prejudge the Truth; so neither are we answerable
for their inconsequence.

The third Advantage which the Lord gave His Work, was by what the King did
after his arrival in Scotland, both before and at his Coronation, for the
greater confirmation of the Covenant and Work of God, and the more strong
engaging of himself and this whole Land unto the Lord. Before his Coronation,
he emitteth that Declaration at Dumfermling sufficiently known by this
designation, wherein Professing, and appearing in the full persuasion and love
of the Truth, he repents (as having to do with and in the sight of God) His
Fathers opposition to the Covenant and Work, of God, and his own reluctancies
against the same, hoping for mercy through the blood of Jesus Christ, and
obtesting the Prayers of the faithful to God, for his stedfastness: and then
protests his truth and sincerity in entering into the Oath of God, resolving
to prosecute the ends of the Covenant to his utmost, and to have with it the
same common friends and enemies, exhorting all to lay down their enmity against
the Cause of God, and not to prefer Man's Interest to God's, which will prove
an Idol of Iealousy to provoke the Lord, and he himself accounts to be but
selfish flattery, and so-forth proceeds in the most cordial, sincere and
assuring terms, to testify his love and zealous resolutions for God, his People
and Covenant, and on the other hand his great dislike and detestation of all
Persons, courses and Interests contrary thereto. A Declaration, so full of
heart-professions, and high attestations of the Great God, that none seriously
considering the present times, can reflect thereon without horror and trembling
from the Holy Jealousy of the Lord, either for the then deep Dissimulation, or
the present unparalelled Apostasy. However seeing the same is so assertive,
that no words could add to it is assurance, nor no argument less then the
present Apostasy, render it to any neutral person suspect of the least
dissimulation; sure we are, that the generality of the Kingdom, did thereby
obtain all the warrant of the King's most full and clear assent to, and
allowance of the Covenant, that either Law or Reason could require. Thereafter
at his Coronation, how the King did again confirm the Covenant, and both He and
his People thereby again engage themselves unto the Lord, the order thereof
printed and published to the World does fully declare. In which, these passages
are very observable. 1. That the King is desired in Name of the People, jointly
to accept the Crown and maintain Religion ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL and SOLEMN
LEAGUE and COVENANT, to which he declares his cordial assent, wishing no
longer to live, then he might see Religion and this Kingdom flourish in all
happiness. 2. After a Sermon most pertinently, plainly and powerfully preached
upon that 2 Kings 11. v. 12, and 17. (wherein amongst other things, the binding
power and force of the Oath of God, and the hazards of the breach thereof are
fully represented) the Action commenceth with the King's most Solemn Renewing
of the National and Solemn League and Covenant, which was in this manner. The
King kneeling and lifting up his right hand before the three Estats of the
Kingdom, the Commissioners of the General Assembly, and the whole People and
Congregation, by his great Oath in presence of the Almighty God, the Searcher
of hearts, he assures and declares his allowance of the NATIONAL COVENANT,
and SOLENN LEAGUE and COVENANT, promising faithfully to prosecute the Ends
thereof, and to establish the same with the Presbyterial Government and the
whole Work of God, in all his Dominions. 3. That, having thus taken the
Covenants, the King is presented to the People, and their willingness, to have
him for their King, demanded; which they accordingly declare. 4. That he did
also swear and take the Coronation Oath appointed and recorded Parl. 1. Iac. 6.
cap. 8. to which both the Covenants are most consonant, Promising by the
Eternal and Almighty God, who lives and reigns for ever, to observe and keep
the same. 5. That when he Sword was put in his hand, he is desired to receave
the same For the Defense of the Faith of Jesus Christ, and of the true Religion
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL and SOLEMN LEAGUE and COVENANT, and for the
Ministration of Justice; which he accordingly accepts. 6. After the Crown is
set upon his head, the Peoples Obligatory Oath is proclaimed, whereby they all
swear by the Eternal and Almighty God who lives and reigns for ever, to be
true and faithful to the King, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL and SOLEMN LEAGUE and
COVENANT. 7. Being installed and set upon the Throne, he is exhorted by the
Minister to remember, That his Throne is the Lord's Throne, 1 Chronicles. 29. ver.
23. And being a Covenanted King set thereon, he ought under God to rule for
God, and especially to beware that he made not the Lord's Throne, a Throne of
Iniquity, to frame mischief by a Law, even such mischievous Laws as have been
enacted by his Predecessors, destructive to Religion, and grievous to the
Lord's People. 8. The Nobles of the Land* being called one by one, and kneeling
before the King on the Throne, and holding their hands betwixt his hands, did
Swear by the Eternal and Almighty God who lives and reigns for ever, to be
true and faithful to the King, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL AND SOLEMN LEAGUE AND
COVENANT. 9. The action is closed by a most solid and weighty exhortation, both
to King and People to keep the Covenant, and beware of the breach of it; which
is enforced by these fearful threatenings and instances recorded in the
Scriptures of Truth, against Covenant-breakers, particularly these, Nehem. 5.
ver. 13. where Nehemiah did shake his lap. saying, So God shake out every man
from his house, and from his labor, that performs not this promise, even
thus be he shaken out and emptied, and all the Congregation said, Amen. Ier.
34. v. 18, 19, 20, and 21. And 2 Chronicles. 24.23, 24, and 25. With this Pathetick
application, That if they should break the Covenant, God would shake off the
King's Crown, and turn him from the Throne; that he would shake the Nobles out
of their possessions, and empty them of their Glory; and would deliver both to
the hands of their enemies who seek their life; That breach of Covenant and
Rebellion against God was an old and continued Sin in the King's house, which
God had already severely punished: if therefore the King should not acknowledge
Jesus Christ King of Zion, who is above him, but break this Covenant, God's
controversy against the King's Family would be carried on unto the weakening if
not the overthrow of it. And lastly, both the King and Nobles are certifyed,
that if the King and they who are engaged to support his Crown, shall conspire
together against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, both the supporters and the
supported will fall together. This is that great Action, wherein almost all the
Solemnities are so twisted with that sacred Bond, that the World must
acknowledge, that never King and People under the Sun, became so expressly and
strictly obliged both unto God, one to another, and amongst themselves, as we
were and are by these most Sacred Oaths of the Holy Covenants, most
indissolubly engaged.

The fourth and last Advantage, was that plenary and last Complement of all
Securities whatsoever amongst men, viz. the Ratification of all these
preceding Treaties, Transactions, Engagements and Actions, concluded and
enacted by the King, then having attained the Age of 21 Years complete, and the
Parliament fully and freely conveened in the Month of June 1651. whereby the
same did pass into a perpetual Law: And this Covenant which from the beginning
was and is the most firm and Indispensible Oath of God, became at length the
very Fundamental Law of the Kingdom, whereon all the Rights and Privileges
either of King or People, are principally bottomed and secured.

This is the fair side of the Transactions and providence of thesse times, and
the effects of the Lord's favorable presence, and the consequence of that Zeal
which we have mentioned. O! that we had sincerely minded and walked agreeably
to all these Engagements, surely our times should have endured for ever: but
seeing both our own backslidings, and the Lord's withdrawing from us do
evidently testify against us, let us ascribe Righteousness unto our God, that
in the remembrance of all these Judgments wherewith he has punished us less
then our inquities deserve, we may not only take unto our selves shame and
Confusion of face, because we have sinned against Him, and thereby stop the
mouth of all these blasphemies and boastings of the Adversaries of the Lord,
and His Holy Covenant, which our Backslidings have so widely opened; but in the
thoughts of His faithfulness be encouraged to hope in His Mercy, and for the
return of our Departed Glory, although we have rebelled against Him.

The Principal Step of our Defection, and the only Rise and Cause of all our
Sin and Calamity, we acknowledge to have been no other, then that which is the
condemnation of the World, that Light indeed came unto us, but we loved
Darkness better then Light, because our deeds were evil. For the Lord did cause
His Gospel to shine amongst us, in as great Power and Purity as ever any Nation
enjoyed, and by the Advantages of his own Holy Ministry and Government, and the
accession of our many fold Covenants and Engadgements, did beautify and secure
the same unto us; And though that after a long continuance of all these
blessings, the Lord by the Ascendent Power of His own Spirit and Glorious
Presence, did bring the whole Land under these great convictions, mentioned in
the conclusion of the League and Covenant, of our not valueing the inestimable
Benefit of the Gospel, nor endeavoring to receave Christ in our hearts, and
walk worthy of Him in our lives, the only. Duty and end of all our Covenants
and Engagements, which is in effect God's greatest Delight and Glory in the
World, and all our Felicity; And unto these unfeigned resolutions there annexed,
of Repentance and Amendment; And lastly though the Lord from Heaven had both
plagued us for, and purged us from these fearful Apostacies and Defections,
whereby men of corrupt minds, not holding the Head and End of all things, even
our Lord Jesus Christ, were both in the Years 1645. and 1648. soon turned aside
from their stedfastness in the Covenant, and became Enemies unto God's own Work
and Cause, and had therefore stirred us up to the Renewing of our Covenant with
God in the Year 1648, with and after a most Solemn Acknowledgement both of the
Causes and Evils of these Defections, and a most serious detestation of, and
resolution against both; Notwithstanding, we say, of all these things, Yet the
great Sin and Evil of not valueing, receaving, and walking worthy of our Lord
Jesus. and the not directing and improving the great Blessings of His Gospel,
Ordinances, Covenants, Victories, and all other Benefits and Enjoyments
bestowed on us for the promoving of the Pleasure of our Lord, and the
Establishing of His Kingdom, for the Salvation of Sinners, did still remain.
Thence was it, that the general and great Zeall which then appeared, was so
suddenly contracted to a very few, and much remitted in all: And that men's
corruptions, turning former Professions into feigned pretensions, and causing
many, (in place of the great and only end proposed) to mind Selfish Designs,
and Worldly advantages, the Lord was provoked to give up some to the
prosecution of these base desires, (...) which they had so quickly backsliden;
And to abandon others to the delusion of an over-credulous Charity: which two
Evils did so far prevail in all the Transactions of these Times, that though
the Overruling Providence of the Most High, did bring forth thereof the
Advantages which we have al-ready, mentioned; yet were Men thereby acted to
pursue Treaties, over the belly of most signal Warnings and most pregnant
Disswasives to the contrary, and to conclude Agreements, and accept of
Securities in the great Matters of God, and of His Work so long contended for,
and far advanced, which no rational man not preferring airy words and
professions, and Ink-subscriptions, to plain refusal, visible reluctancies,
manifest resilings, open counter-actings, and strong and continued prejudices,
would be satisfied with, in his own private matters of almost the meanest
concernment. But though the Lord from heaven did at Dumbar, testify against
both this evil and sinful course, and the great Sin and wickedness that had
procured it, and thereafter by many of His faithful Servants did give express
Testimony and Warning against the same* yet it is still persisted in: And
notwithstanding that by a new discovery, after all the assurance contained in
the Declaration at Dumfermling that could be imagined, the Lord did make it
evident at Clova, that all these condescensions were only the constraints of
Policy, the Backsliding and Delusion of these times did proceed, until, that
under a pretense of Necessity, preferring the Arm of Flesh to the Almighty
Power and Favor of the Most High, and through the persuasion of a
Mock-Repentance, only agreeable unto that Mock-Treaty whereon it depended, we
were induced again, to break the Lord's Commandment and our own Engagement, in
joining with the People of these Abominations; to provoke the Lord to be angry,
until He should consume us utterly without a remnant or escaping; and by
partaking of their Sins, became apt and ready to partake of their judgments,
which the Lord, by the hand of the TREACHEROUS, did suddenly inflict upon us
for all our treachery: And thereby, according to His Righteousness and Great
Faithfulness, as he had brought upon us the blessing; so He also brought upon
us the curse of His Holy Covenant, and the fears of our own Acknowledgement.

These were our Forsakings and Backslidings, which provoked the Lord also to
forsake us, and at length to give us over unto, and leave us in the hands of
our enemies; and to lay on our necks that long and heavy yoke of foreign
Usurpation, under which, from the Year 1651. unto the Year 1660. we did so
grevously groan. The remembrance of which things, does necessarily oblidge us
to the Declaration of these things.

1. That as we desire heartily to resume these professions of unfeigned
Humiliation (for the undervaluing of the Precious Gospel and slighting of our
Lord Jesus Christ) contained in our Holy Covenant, wherein all the Land without
exception are and were so deeply concerned; so (although in the Narration of
the procedure of our sinful and Woeful Defection, the particular passages of
Self-seeking and Over-credulous Delusion, may import a narrower restricton,
Yet) the Lord is our witness, that the pure motive of His Glory, and the Honor
and Truth of His Work and Covenant, without prejudice to the persons of any,
far less of such, whom we are persuaded the Lord both did, and yet does honor,
to be instrumental in His Work, and faithful in His Covenant, (though neither
in the former practice, or this present persuasion, we do agree) have induced
us to this reflection: which we earnestly obtest, may be looked upon by all,
rather as the matter of our mourning then of our censure.

2. That whatever love and sincere respect we retain for such of the Faithful,
who (through the Holy and Wise Permission of the Sovereign Lord, by the
influence of particular temptations, or of that general and powerful snare of
an Evil Time) were carried on to a Sinful Compliance with the Evil Courses
thereof: Yet we are persuaded, that the remitting of that Zeal, sincerity and
stedfastness, whereunto, in our Solemn Acknowledgement, upon the most powerful
motives, we had then lately so seriously engaged our selves; and the more
Politic then Pious management of these Treaties and Transactions; (wherein the
advancement of the Work of God, and prosecution of the Ends of the Covenant so
highly pretended, could not sincerely and zealously be intended, by any
imaginary security or sinful assistance thereby obtained) but especially the
relapsing unto that most sinful Conjunction with the People of these
Abominations, so solemnly and lately repented for, and resolved against,
(which, in stead of being salved, was, by the Constrained, Politic,
Dissembled, and Formal Repentance then used, to the mocking of the God of
Truth, and scorn of all our Holy Engagements, on all hands mostly aggravated
and exaggerated) these evils, we say, were the very foundations of this present
Apostasy, and the grounds of the Lords controversy, which has so long, and yet
does so greivously pursue this Poor Church and Nation. O! that all men would
yet at length, after all the evils and warnings which God has sent amongst us,
seriously consider their ways, take unto themselves shame, and give unto God
the Glory, before the decree bring forth our utter destruction and desolation.
Who knows but the Lord would repent Himself for His servants, when He sees
our power is gone, and return on high for His own Glory, and the Congregation
of the poor that compass Him about, and render vengeance unto all his
adversaries?

3. That neither failing nor backsliding of many of the faithful, nor the
wicked Hypocrisy and Dissimulation practiced on the other hand, in the carrying
on, and concluding of these Treaties, whereby the King was brought under the
bond of the Holy Covenant, does lessen or annul His Obligation thereto; far
less the Security, which the People, especially such who know not these depths
of Satan, did obtain thereby, for their warrant and confirmation: Surely the
greatest Aggravation of Perjury, cannot annul the Sacred Obligation of an Oath;
nor an intended Falsehood, loose the bond of Truth; nor will vile Dissimulation,
and the most fearful mocking of God and the whole World, deliver from His Holy
Justice and Jealousy, who is a terrible and swift witness against, and avenger
of all such abominations. Did the wicked dissimulation and rebellious heart of
the Children of Israel, wherewith they entered in Covenant with the Lord, Deu.
29.10. to 28. liberate them from the sin of Apostasy, and all these fearful
plagues threatened against it? Did not that Dissimulate promise and engagement
of the remnant of the Jews, made to Jeremiah chap. 42.20. rather hasten and
aggravat the punishment of their disobedience, v. 21, and 22? All who love
Truth or fear an Oath, do no doubt abhor such wickedness. But the main
objection is, that all these condescensions were extorted by Force and Fear,
which does excuse the Dissimulation, and annul the Oath. We shall not here
insist to clear and refute this cavillation, which others have so fully
answered: For as to the position, that neither force nor fear, do cause to
cease the obligation of an Oath in a matter merely Indifferent; much less,
Holy, Righteous and true (as the matter of the Covenant is) all yield. But that
neither Force, Fear, nor any other indirect way can be alleged for the
annulling of these engagements, both the preceding Treaties, the just and
necessary Reasons, and all other cicumstances do most evidently confirm; So
that the whole World may justly wonder, that these men, who both in profession
and practice, do plainly evidence their profane Indifferency, and regardless
violation of all Oaths, wherein Interest does not concur, should by the
manifest Patronizing of all Perfidy (whereof no instance can be adduced in the
breach of any treaty, wherein the stronger and weaker did ever compose any
matter of Right, which is not more justifyable) and the shameful disgracing of
the King himself, (whom neither Conscience, Honor, Honesty, nor the example of
his Father could teach the constancy of the most mean and abject of his
Subjects,) should plead and pretend to rational pretext for the present
Apostasy, and not rather content themselves, to say with the King in one of his
Declarations, emitted shortly after his return to England, that it is well
known by what abusive means His Majesty was adduced to make and publish that
Declaration at Dumfermling, without any more special condescendence, which is
impossible. But oh! that the World did also know and consider all the
re-iterated Oaths and Subscriptions, High and Solemn Attestations, Free and
unrequired Professions, Fearful Execrations, made before God, Angels and Men,
both in Public, upon the Throne, under the Crown, in plain Parliament, and
also in Private Conferences, which many yet alive can sufficiently attest; by
which this poor Church and Nation was ensnared, and precipitated into all the
Sin and Misery, that since the Year 1650. unto this day, has afflicted us.
However the Lord, who sees and hears, does also consider, to require it, and
the violence done to Himself in many of his suffering members, who partly even
in the conscience of the very things, which they that are mostly therein
concerned, do mockat, dare not prostitute their Consciences in an ambulatory
Compliance, with the wicked Apostasy in these times.

4. We cannot but observe, that after the prevailing, and during the time of
the English usurpation, these only, for the most part, remained mindful of, and
faithful to the King, who were faithful and steadfast in the Covenant; when as
these, who formerly did, and at present do pretend so highly, for the King, in
prejudice both of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Covenant, did in their slavish
compliance, abandon all Alleagance and Honesty, to complement the then Powers,
for the promoving of their own selfish designs, which is the only bond of all
their Engagements, and rule and aim of all their Actions. And though many of
them do now pretend to have been sufferers, yet it is well known, that if they
had had the half of these temptations, which the Faithful upon the account of
their allegiance did constantly resist, the Kings Interest for their part, had
been for ever forgotten, as it was by many of them openly renounced and
abjured; And that the main reason of their then seeming and pretended Loyalty,
was the improbability of credit with, and acceptance from the Usurpers, because
of their known Naughtiness.

Having thus declared the Lords great Work and Glorious Presence amongst us, in
all these Mercies and Judgments which he showed upon us, and these strange
Vicissitudes and Alternations, sometimes of His Grace and Power, engageing us
with heart and hand unto Himself, sometimes of our own hearts Wickedness and
Unstedfastness, again causing us to apostatize and backslide from His Holy
Command and Covenant, which, daring the space of an hundred years from the Year
1560, have in the Holy and Wise Providence of God passed over us; that by all
these great Temptations, which our eyes have seen, and the Signs and wonders
which he has wrought, we might know, that the Lord is our God, and Jesus
Christ our King; and that by all these things, He only went about to establish
us for a peculiar People unto Himself, in the Glorious Light of His Truth, and
Beauty of His Holiness, far exalted above many other Nations. We are now come
to the Year 1660, wherein though the Lord was pleased according to His Glorious
Soveraignity, by His own immediate hand, to break the yoke of our Oppressors,
restore our Covenanted King, Laws and Liberties, and to make all Factions,
Parties and Interests, not only to cede unto, but unanimously to conspire for
this Blessed Restitution; yet how evidently has it since appeared, that the
Lord had not given unto us an heart to perceave, eyes to see, nor ears to hear,
unto that very day.

We need not here resume the King's most Solemn and Indissoluble Engagements,
which we have so lately mentioned, nor add that after Worcester fight, and from
beyond Sea, he did confirm by private letters to persons of unquestionable
credit, that he was, and through the Grace of God would continue, the same man
that he had declared Himself to be in Scotland; nor that it was the conscience
of that clause of the Covenant, relating to the maintenance of His Person and
Authority, which during the times of Usurpation, did retain the sense and love
of his Interest, so fresh and deeply rooted in men's hearts; Nor that the
public owning, publishing and reprinting thereof by the then Parliament in
England in March 1660. was the first Public Act that durst or did appear in his
favors; Nor lastly need we remember that Letter written and directed by the
King, after his return to the Presbytery of Edinburgh and this whole Church,
wherein he declares Himself resolved, by the Grace of God to protect and
preserve the Government of the Church of Scotland as it is settled by Law
without violation; Seeing that though according to it is then State and posture,
such a Solemn and Public Assurance might have been reputed a perpetual
Security; yet the whole strain of the Letter, is such as tends only to divide
the whole Ministry, and to abuse the greater part of them: And particularly,
the altering and suppressing of that most fixed and certain ground of his
Engagement, even the Word of God and the Holy Covenant, for that of Law, which
is but frail and moveable, did even then discover to many, that latent
Dissimulation and Instability, whereby others were either weakly or willingly
deluded. The thing we observe is, that both King and Peoples Obligations were
not then greater, then the opportunity appeared to be most happy, for the
accomplishing of the Lord's Work, the making of his Name Great and One in all
these Nations, and the Nations happy and high above all Nations in Name and in
Praise, and the establishing of the King and his posterity upon the Throne in
Glory and prosperity, and that the owning of, and adhering unto the Solemn
League and Covenant, our Magna Charta of Religion and Righteousness, had both
in the persuasion of all sober men, and even in the conviction of the greatest
part of our Adversaries, infallibly produced, and effectuated all these
blessings.

But Oh! how suddenly and strangely was this blessed appearance overclouded,
the expectation of all the Godly disappointed, the joy and peace of all
corrupted and marred, and this Land reduced unto this present so woeful
desolation and sore distress, which though the groans, tears, and the Blood of
the Persecuted, the cry of Violence and Oppression, the Desolation and
Profanation of Gods Sanctuary, the reigning power of Darkness, the Pride, Rage
and Blasphemy of Perjury and all Profanity, which has filled the Land, and the
dreadful Wrath of the most Holy and Great God, which both burns round about,
and hangs over it, do sufficiently make manifest, yet for our greater
upstirring to consider and lay to heart, that all these evils are come upon us
because our God is not amongst us, and what the heat of this great Anger
means, and also for the clearing of the Innocence and Testimony of the Lords
sufferers, we do shortly exhibit the violent course of this precipitant
Defection.

The King being returned and re-established in May 1660. the Antichristian
Spirit of Prelacy, ever enemy to the Gospel and Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, and
the Holy Covenant whereby the same are promoted, taking occasion from these
many troubles and confusions, which the opposition and false-heartedness of
many in the same Covenant, did principally provoke the Lord to inflict upon
their Lands, and advantage from the proneness of men's Power to decline unto
Tyranny, and their corruptions to all licentiousness, did first most falsely
and atrociously slander the Covenant as the Bond of all Iniquity, Rebellion and
Confusion, which prejudice being enforced which many apparent advantages that
then did attend it, did so suddenly and strongly spread and root it self in the
hearts of our Nobles, Rulers, and the generality of the Land, that, without so
much as seriously reflecting upon their former so Solemn Engagements, Sacred
Oaths, Public Professions, Vigorous Actings and Appearances for the Cause and
Covenant of the Lord, with any consideration of Conscience, Honesty, or Honor,
which so great and sudden a mutation from their former ways, though they had
been as wicked, as in effect they are true and righteous, did certainly call
for in sober and earnest Repentance, they with the concurrence of such vile
Sycophants and treacherous persons in the Church and Ministry, as the worldly
wealth and Power of Prelacy had wickedly debauched, set themselves in a most
determined and resolute Fury, whereinto all their former zeal for God is by the
malice of Satan suddenly corrupted, by the plain force of Power, and color of
Authority, whereunto they had now attained, to deface and overturn the whole
Work of God, raze it is fundations, annul His Covenants, repeal all Acts made in
their favors, incapacitate and persecute all opposers, and lastly to efface and
dissolve all sense and bond of Conscience, by which this fearful course of
Apostasy, might be in the least, checked or controlled.

We shall not here premise any thing, for clearing of the Unlawfulness of the
succeeding Acts and Deeds, whereby this Apostasy was carried on, and for the
loosing and freeing of us from all obligation of Obedience thereto, or
Compliance therewith: Any who can but suppose, that not only a whole Parliament
but also all men are, and have often been found liars, and compare impartially
the things present with the things that are past, must necessarily conclude,
that all these Acts and Deeds of Defection were and are Gross Perjury and
Wickedness, and that so long as that maxim shall hold, that we ought rather to
obey God then Man, they can never be binding either in Conscience or Reason.

Seeing therefore that the only Rule of these Counteractings and overturnings,
was to destroy that which the Lord had so gloriously planted, and to loose that
whereunto we were and are indissolubly obliged, referring our selves to what is
already said, for vindicating the Lords Work and our Holy Covenants, we proceed
to lay forth the Sinfulness and Wofulness of this Defection, as follows.

1. In July 1660. by immediate clandestine warrants, without any cause
signified or citation given, the Lord Marquess of Argile and some other
Gentlemen, (who were conceaved to have been instrumental in the former Work of
God, and that they might be of influence for obstructing of the then designed
overthrow thereof) were attached and committed close Prisoners.

2. In August 1660. the Committee of Estates appointed by the Parliament 1651.
being again set down, the very first day of their meeting, do violently seize
upon several faithful Ministers, peaceably and quietly assembled together, and
employed in the drawing up of a monitory Letter to the King, in the most
rational and dutiful manner, and for the most important and necessary Ends, of
Gods Glory, and the Kings service, that can be imagined, as the Letter it self
set down at large in the Apologetick Narration does testify. And though this
duty and employment was no other, then what the meanest subject in the most
private capacity might, and all were indispensibly obliged to have done; yet
those Ministers and one Gentleman with them, are therefore, instantly without
hearing, committed Prisoners.

3. This Committee proceeding to prepare for the succeeding Parliament, (which
was all it is work and design) the Parliament siteth down the 1 day of January.
Where, having taken the Oath of Supremacy, without respect to it is due
limitation contained in the 114. Act. Ia. 6. Parl. 12. 1592. then standing
unrepealed; and exalting the Kings prerogative, upon the alleged Warrant of
the Word of God and Laws of the Land (but in effect directly contrary to both)
above all Offices, Parliaments, Laws, Leagues, Conventions, Peace and War; and
likewise upon mere assertions and alleageances in place of declaring upon known
and certain grounds (which is all that any Parliament can lawfully do) directly
Innovating the Fundamental Law and Constitution of the Kingdom, and thereby
making the Kings Throne, the foundation of all the succeeding Perjury and
Apostasy; They spoil and divest, first, the Solemn League and Covenant, and
then the National Covenant, Presbyterial Government, and the whole Work of God,
of all legal warrant and Authority; Declaring all Acts and Practices made and
standing in favors thereof, to be void and null: And by the same great Act
rescissory, they revive and reinforce all the corruptions and Superstitions of
Crossing, Kneeling and the like, introduced by any Parliament since the
Reformation. As the Acts of the first Session of the last Parliament do clearly
testify.

Although that these Acts have been and are, both in themselves and in their
effects, just cause of great astonishment and mourning to all the Faithful in
the Land; yet when we remember that height of Wickedness and Profanity that
then abounded, and the false, flattering, and perjurious Sermons and practices,
by which the Parliament was thereunto instigated, but most of all that Act that
then passed for an Anniversary* Thanksgiving; wherein, as if we had been
delivered to commit all this great Wickedness, the Spirit and Work of the Lord
are heinously blasphemed and calumniated, as the only Author and Cause of all
the Blood, Bondage, Usurpation, Rebellion, Rapine, Violence and other Evils,
that either the malice and wickedness of men had caused, or God in his
Righteous Judgment had therefore permitted or inflicted; and the Ranversing of
our Blessed Reformation, Holy Covenants, and the Righteous Laws whereby they
were established, accounted the Restitution of Religion, Righteousness, and
Liberties; And the 29 of May, as most Auspicious, appointed for the yearly
solemn commemoration thereof. (A day, the profane Institution whereof cannot be
better demonstrated, then by it is more profane observance and celebration ever
since practiced) These things, we say, being considered, do justly add horror
to our astonishment and trembling unto our mourning. But that their practice
might be also consonant to their Acts and Statutes, and, by cutting off or
laying aside it is most eminent Opposers, the return of Prelacy might be more
effectually promoted, in the same Session of Parliament, not only was that
Innocent and Faithful one, Mr Cut^ry, (singled out and signally honored by
God, to bear testimony to the Kingdom of His Son Jesus Christ, His Cause and
Covenant, (for no other fault then his faithfulness therein, and his Declining
the King's usurped Authority in prejudice of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, and
the privileges of His Church, clearly warranded by 114 Act Parl. 12. la. 6.
then standing unrepeal'd, and by a great cloud of faithful Witnesses, who in
like manner did testify against this Usurpation) cruelly slain and put to
death; But also, under the color of certain Epidemick crimes, wherein the
Soveraignity of Divine Providence, more then any man's malice, had involved the
whole Land, others who had been eminent in the Work of God, particularly the
Marquess of Argyle, were condemned to death, and forfeited: and several other
Faithful Ministers, besides these who were at first imprisoned by the Committee
of Estates, were without any cause signified, imprisoned, confined, or
otherwise vexed and incapacitated.

4. The rise and re-establishment of this Antichristian Prelacy being thus
prepared, in the interval after this first Session of Parliament, the King
nominateth and presents Bishops; and four of them being called to Court, are
there Re-ordained and Consecrated: and that in such a manner as does clearly
infer their disowning and renouncing their former Minstery, and their Warrant
and Mission thereunto. In consequence whereof, all the Ordinary meetings of
Presbyteries and Synods are discharged, until they should of new be licenced
and Authorized thereto by the Bishops now nominated and appointed, and, to the
effect that matters might the better succeed, several of our Faithful
Ministers, upon groundless suspicions, and for refusing of the Oath of
Supremacy arbitrarly and rigorously imposed, without so much as admitting such
qualifications, as no Christian ought or can deny, are some of them Banished
and others confined.

5. The second Session of this last Parliament sitting in May 1662. by their
first Act, they restore and reestablish Prelacy in all it is pretended Rights,
Dignities and Privileges, but in effect, in it is real Usurpations and
Corruptions. And for the better settling thereof, and evident declaring to the
World, how Erastian and Antichristian this Woeful Government is, both in it is
Rise, Designs and Effects, as by this Act, the Restitution thereof is expressly
founded upon the King's Supremacy, as being an inherent Right in the Crown for
the disposal of the external Government of the Church, So it is also declared,
that whatever the King shall determine with advice of the Bishops and such of
the Clergy as he shall nominate, in the external Government of the Church,
shall be valid and effectual, without any other Proviso then that the same be
consistent with the Laws of the Realm. But the Absolute Complement of all
Wickedness and the Hight of Usurpation, above all that ever the Papacy it self
aspired unto, is that which follows, whereby the King and Parliament, for
clearing all scruples which may occur from former Acts and Practices, do
rescind all former Acts, by which, the sole and only power of Jurisdiction
within this Church, does stand in the Church, and in the Meetings and
Assemblies thereof; and all Acts of Parliament and Council, which may be
interpreted to have given any Church Power, Jurisdiction, or Government to the
Office-bearers of the Church, their respective meetings, other then that which
acknowledges a dependence upon, and subordination to the Sovereign Power of
the King as supreme, and is to be regulated and authorized in the exercise
thereof by the Bishops, who are to put order to Ecclesiastic matters, and to
be accountable to the King for their Administration; And the foresaid 114 Act
Parl. 12. la. 6. whereby the Privileges, Power and other essential Censures
given by God to the spiritual Office-bearers in His Church, and warranded by
His Word are ratifyed, is even in so far and totally cassed and rescinded. And
that the World may know how presumptuous and absurd this Usurpation is, which
cannot be justly conceaved without an instance of it is effects, we here subjoyn
that 4 Act. Sess. 3. of the same Parliament for the constitution of a National
Synod, wherein the King is made soveraignly and properly to constitute this
Assembly, both as to the Appointment of it is Members Constituent, and of it is
constant President; the absolute regulation of things there to be proposed
(which are declared to be only such as He shall please to signify,) the
determination and limitation of it is Decisions, which are to be agreed to by
the President as well as the major part, and providing that they be not
contrary to the Prerogative or the Laws of the Realm, And lastly, as to the
necessity of the King's presence in person or by his Commissioner, and of his
Ratification and Approbation, without which no Act or Deed is to be of any
force. Now let the World consider, what he could have done more in the
constitution and regulation of his own Court of Exchequer: And if he has not
done all, as to the constitution of this Court, (immediately depending upon our
Lord Jesus Christ and his sole Authority) which He Himself has done or
possibly could do; by what warrant or rule, He who is King of Kings will
require. We shall not here stand to examine these Acts according to former Laws,
Oaths and Engagements, hereby most fearfully violated and contemned; This is a
strain of wickedness above all that former times could imagine. O! that God
would speak to the Authors, but not in his wrath, and as he has set His only
Son upon his holy Hill of Zicn; so he would cause them to fear His displeasure,
that they may yet be wise and instructed to kiss the Son, left he be angry, and
they perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Surely to
define, that the sole Power and Jurisdiction of this Church, does not stand
within the same, but in some thing without beside our Lord Jesus; and that the
same is fountain'd in, and derived from the King; and that all Church Officers
in all Church matters, are accountable to him, who is neither thereto Gifted
nor Called, is to set the King upon our Lord Jesus his Throne, and a high
derogation from, and reflection upon him, who hes builded the Temple of the
Lord and bears the Glory, and sits and rules both as King and Priest upon His
Throne; Who, more worthy then Moses, was faithful and perfect as a Son over His
own House; and therefore did not leave His Church destitute, of any such
necessary and proper Officer or Assister, when neither King nor Prince was so
much as members thereof; And lastly, it is a plain Perversion in stead of
Performance of that Promise made to the Church, Isai. 49. ver. 23. That Kings
should be it is Nursing Fathers, where in place of Dominion, there Submission is
expressly enjoined, they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the
Earth. We know that this empty Notion of External Policy, is vainly pretended
to color the matter: But seeing whatsoever can be meaned by external Policy,
even as to outward decency and Order, is either particularly determined by our
Lord Himself and His blessed Apostles, or under the definition of General and
Evident Rules left unto the Churches arbitriment, whereby the King (being no
Church Officer) upon a double account is clearly excluded; and seeing that under
the pretense of this External Policy, the greatest and most superstitious
Novations in the pure Worship of God, and the greatest Corruptions and Abuses
both by the appointment of new Officers in the Church of Christ without His own
warrant, and the usurping and perverting of the Power of Spiritual Censures in
the Government of Gods House, may be and have been introduced, we doubt not,
but all rational men do see the delusions of such vain pretenses. And certainly
since the Act it self does proceed, to grant the King all the Power in and over
both Ecclesiastic Causes and Persons that can be imagined, it would be but
ordinary ingenuity in our Adversaries, plainly to assert, that the King is the
Great Apostle and Vicegerent of our Lord Jesus Christ, in and over His House:
Although they should not only appear herein destitute of any better warrant,
then this present Act of Parliament; But most plainly to justify all the
Usurpation, that ever the Pope or Antichrist, can be charged with.

6. Bishops being thus restored and admitted to sit and give voice in
Parliament, this Mixture and the Power of their Antichristian Spirit does
quickly exert it self: And without regard to the nature of Parliamentary and
all Civil Powers (which are no ways conversant about things and persuasions
only Internal, and merely appertaining to conscience or to the Word of God,
which is the ground and warrant, upon which all Power whatsoever being only
Declarative, in matters of this kind, ought certainly and expressly to proceed,)
They procure a Dogmatick Act declaring these Positions, That it is lawful to
Subjects for Reformation or necessary Self-defence to enter into Leagues, or
take up Arms against the King, and such like, to be Rebellious and treasonable;
and particularly that the National Covenant as it was explained in the Year
1638, and the Solemn League and Covenant were, and are in THEMSELVES UNLAWFUL
OATHS, and were taken by, and imposed upon the Subjects of this Kingdom,
against the Fundamental Law and Liberties thereof. (Which neither they nor all
the invention of Hell, is able to condescend upon or instruct) And therefore,
out of the plenitude of their power, (as much as ever any Pope pretended to)
they loose the Obligation of Conscience, and free the Subjects of their
Engagements: And further, to complete this their Wickedness, they appoint a
Declaration of this High Impiety, to be signed by all in Public Trust, that
none may be admitted to, or exerce the same, except they receave in their right
hand or in their foreheads this their accursed mark. O! Lord our God, thou art
of purer eyes then to behold Evil, and can not look on Iniquity: Wherefore
lookst thou on them that deal treacherously, and holds thy tongue when the
wicked devour the man that is more righteous then he? Yet surely O Lord thou
have ordained them for judgment, and O mighty God, thou have estabished them
for correction. Can the World believe, that a whole Nation in it is most
National Capacity, including King, Parliament and the body of the People,
should after most clear and evident convictions, and signal Manifestations of
the Glory and presence of God, in the most important and holy Concernments of
all Truth and Righteousness, most solemnly (as it were) to day engage
themselves by Oath unto the Lord, and to morrow, without so much as seriously
remembering Gods Holiness and terrible Jealousy, either against these that break
His Holy Covenant, or wickedly profane His Name by taking it in vain, at once
without any reason or probable motive rendered therefore, despise, contemn and
trample the same Holy and Great Engagements under foot, and urge others to the
like Wickedness and Impiety? If this tend unto, or shall prove effectual for
the preservation of his Majesty's Person, Authority and Government, as this Act
and statute is entitled, then surely he may break the Covenant and prosper.
But this is not all, for these men supposing by this Act, that the Work of God
was utterly subverted and overthrown, they provide also against the fears of
it is revival, by declaring all such Gatherings and Petitions that were used in
the beginning of the late Troubles, though the same be no other then that
common privilege of all men, which Slavery it self (much less Subjection) does
not take away, to be unlawful and seditious: And further do statute and enact
that no person by VVriting, Printing, Praying, Preaching, or malicious and
advised speaking, express or publish any words or sentences to stir up the
People to the dislike of the Kings Prerogative and Supremacy, or of the
Government of the Church by Bishops, or justify any of the deeds, Actings or
things declared against by this present Act. By all which, not only the
Security of Religion and the Liberty of the Subject is utterly subverted, by
prohibiting of the lawful, most necessary and only means of asserting thereof,
in case the same should be invaded; but we are also denied and prohibited the
license, so much as to mourn and pour out our prayer unto God, either apart or
one with another, for all this Horrid Apostasy, or our heavy persecutions for
non-complyance therewith; So that the most innocent of all remedies,
Petitioning and Prayer, and also the meanest and last of all comforts, even the
Tears and Complaints of the afflicted, (which God and Nature has hitherto
placed beyond the reach of all cruelty) are now severely forbidden.

7. By the third Act of the same Session of Parliament, under the pretense that
Patronages, being the just and proper right of these concerned, were unjustly
abolished in the Year 1649. notwithstanding that the same were only, in so far
as they were burdensome to the Church of God, and obstructive to the Work of
the Gospel, then abrogated; and in lieu thereof the civil Interest and benefit
of Patrons more amply extended and secured; yet on purpose that they might cast
out and remove such faithful Ministers, as notwithstanding all the wicked Acts
and Practices then made for the overthrow of the Work of God and Presbyterial
Government, might have by their stedfastness (at least) put some demur to this
impetuous Defection, they statute and ordain, that all Ministers who entered to
the Cure of any Parish, in or since the Year 1649. have no right unto, nor
shall possess any benefice or stipend for that same current Year 1662. or any
Year following, but decern their Kirks and Benefices Ipso Jure vacant: And then
under pretext of favor, they clearly discover the design and snare intended,
in declaring that every such Minister who shall obtain the Patron's
Presentation and Bishop's Collation, betwixt and the twenty of September then
nixt following, shall have right to his Church and Benefice, as if at his entry
he had been lawfully presented, otherwise the Act to stand in force against
him. By which means this same Parliament in their first Session having enacted,
that no Patron should present, or Minister Presented have right, except they
should first take the Oath of Supremacy, the very body and strength of the
Ministry of this Church were reduced to this sore Dilemma, either to take that
Oath of Supremacy, which both by express Acts and clear Practices, was now
declared and interpreted to be the very height of Papacy, and root of Prelacy,
and by accepting of Collation, to acknowledge these perfidious and usurping
Prelates, or to lose and be cast out of the Ministry, likeas, de facto 300. and
upwards of the faithful Ministers, were by virtue of this Act shortly
thereafter outed and violented from the Exercise of their Ministry.

8. The Prelates not having attained their full intent by this last Act, do
further prosecut their design of casting out, and incapacitating all such as
either remained or might rise up to oppose their wickedness, and therefore they
procure, 1. an Act of Parliament without either Citation or Reason alleged or
rendered, against the faithful Ministers of Edinburgh, (who, being eminent
lights, were also from the advantage of the place apprehended as more eminent
opposers,) discharging them of their, Ministry, and ordaining them to remove
themselves and families out of the City, after the 8 of September then next to
come. 2. By the fourth Act of the same second Session of Parliament, to the
effect that not one faithful Minister might remain to witness against their
Defection, they statut and enact, that all Ministers, for Testifying their
acknowledgement of, and compliance with the present Government by Prelates,
keep and observe the Bishops Visitations and Diocesian Assemblies, and be
assistant to them in all Acts of Church Discipline as they shall be required,
under the pain for the first fault of Suspension from Office and Benefice, and
of Deposition if they should not amend. We are not here to redargue such
lukewarm Newters, as, by the subtilty of a vain distinction deceaving and being
deceaved, under the pretense of innocent submission, do actually Assist,
Partake, and Comply with that wicked Prelacy, which they are sworn to Extirpat;
and at best, can only pretend to keep the Covenant by that detestable
Neutrality, which, they have therein abjured; Their growing Backsliding will
quickly declare and free them of this imputation of Neutrality. Our regrate is
for the faithful, who are thus by the Perjury and violence of such who of all
men ought most to patronize them, not only outed of the Ministry by Deprivation
from Benefice or stipend, but declared by a Parliament, a Civil Court,
deposable from their Spiritual Office, as inconsistently and absurdly as if the
same Secular persons, who were authors thereof, had by the same Act stepped into
their pulpits. 3. By the same last Act, in imitation of Julian the Apostat, who
found not a more effectual and Devilish invention for suppressing and
destroying Christianity then the shutting up of their Schools and Colleges for
learning, they ordain for the poisoning of all the springs and fountains
thereof, that none teach or rule in an University or College, except they both
take the Oath of Supremacy, and submit to, and own the Government of Prelacy,
and that none be permitted to teach any School, or to be a Paedagogue to
Children without the Prelates license. 4. By the same Act, they not only
prohibit any to Preach in public or in families without the Prelates license;
but advancing and pursuing their malice and persecution unto these very
Sanctuaries of rest and refuge, which even in former times, (when the proud
were called happy, and such as wrought wickedness were set up, yea they that
tempted God. were delivered,) the Lord did provide and reserve for his Own,
wherein they that feared him, and thought upon his Name, spoke often one to
another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it; they under the pretense, lest the
People should thereby be alienat from their Lawful Pastors (as they call them)
who in effect are Wolves and Thieves, discharge all Private Meetings in houses
for Religious Exercises, which might tend to the prejudice of the public
Worship in Churches: Under which qualification, all Christian Fellowship and
Society, amongst such who cannot overcome their just aversion from these
Churches and public Meetings, which these Apostat Prelates have profaned and
polluted, and whereunto they have wickedly intruded, are prohibited and
reproached.

9. By a Proclamation emitted this second Session of Parliament, they again
enjoin the observance of that Anniversary Holy Day, the 29 of May, even the
Month and Day which they had devised of their own heart for a feast unto the
People: And to the effect they might the more infallibly attain their purpose
of Outing all faithful Ministers, they subjoin the certification of
Deprivation of Benefice, or Stipend, against all such who should not, (because
in conscience could not) observe it, like as de facto, severalls, who could not
in conscience satisfy themselves either as to the Authority or Reason of the
appointment, are therefore without Citation or hearing, Outed of their
Benefices and Stipends for that Year; and the same either immediately ingathered
by the common Collector, or gifted to some other.

10. In the same Session of Parliament, pretending that the whole Land, (a few
only excepted,) were notourly and heinously involved in the crimes of Treason
and Lese-Majesty, through no other cause nor occasion, then our most Necessary,
Righteous, and Lawful entering into the Solemn League and Covenant, and
prosecuting the holy ends theirof, once so signally owned and countenanced by
the Lord, and so fully Authorized by all the Law and Security that can be
imagined (for, as for the English Usurpation, few were guilty of Compliance
therewith, who were not also most forward in this Apostasy, and the very vilest
and worst of such had been declared an honest man by an express and particular
Act of the same Parliament) they appoint a packed close Committee, wherein the
generality of the faithful to the number of about 800, (not adding a hundred
more who by private resentment or upon some other prejudice were listed in this
roll) without citation or any cause signified, or any manner of trial taken,
were most arbitrarily Fined, and for the most part in such pecuniary mulcts and
sums as it pleased the malicious suggestions of the delators to impose, and in
many particulars so absurdly, the sometimes the same person was found twice
fined under diverse styles in diverse Shires, and others were left blanck either
in the Name or Surname, who might be filled up either for one person or
another, as the best conjecture should determine; and others were fined, who
were dead long before, or were Infants, and Minors under age, and others who to
this day could never be found. If this be the righteous judgment which the
Lord does require, let the world declare. Surely this Act is such as has no
precedent nor fellow, except that other Act of Billeting, whereof, as the Power
and Interest of some persons against whom it was intended have by an after Act
sufficiently discovered it is Irregularity and absurdity; so until the like
discovery as to other Acts may be obtained, it may evidently enough declare
what manner of Power and Reason did overruled this Parliament: But these two
Acts being past, the Parliament proceed to declare by their Act of Indemnity
the Kings special Grace and Goodness, in pardoning such whom only the
Parliaments own Apostasy, and unparalelled Rebellion against the God or Heaven,
made criminal, excepting for the most part only such who were most Innocent.

11. This Session of Parliament being ended, the Council go about the execution
of the Acts therein concluded, especially against the Ministers not obtaining
Presentations, and by their Act and Proclamation at ^lasgow emitted, the 1. day
of October 1662. they command all such Ministers to remove themselves forth of
their respective Parishes, betwixt and the -- day of November then nixt
ensueing, discharging them thereafter to exercise any part of their Ministerial
Function within the same: what and how great the iniquity and rigor of this Act
is, we will not stand to declare. Certainly, he who commanded his Apostles to
pray that their flight might not be in the Winter, did regard and does remember
the great distress which many poor families then sustained, who, being deprived
of livelihood, turned out of doors, indigent and very numerous, might according
to the cruelty of their adversaries have starved and perished. We need not here
insist upon the particular steps, whereby the restless jealousies of these
wicked Prelates, did urge forward and advance this Presecution, by their
impetrating of reiterate Acts and Proclamations, until they obtained that last
Act and Proclamation, concluding and adjudging all these Ministers unto such a
nice and impossible Confinement, which not only the necessity of humane
frailty, and it is dependence upon many indispensible conveniences, do render
more rigid and intolerable, then the most strict imprisonment, and the most
barbarous banishment; but also the most curious skill of the most exact
Geographer can scarce make practicable: It is enough for us to note, that
having, by a posterior Proclamation, extended the same pains unto all Ministers
outed upon whatsoever ground of non conformity to this present course of
Apostasy, (in which condition all the faithful Ministers in Scotland a very
few excepted, are included,) there were never so many Innocent and Faithful
Ministers, in any Christian Church at once and for such a cause reduced to such
hardships, fears, and uncertainties, and that by such persons, who not only are
as deeply and solemnly sworn and engaged as they are, in the same Cause and
Covenant, for which they suffer, but by such who once (some of them at least)
appeared to have had the zeal of God, so that if it had been possible they
would have plucked out their own eyes, and have given them to such, whose
Enemies they now are, only because they tell them the truth: Such is the
fearful snare and prevailing Power of Apostasy; but God sees and tells their
wanderings, and puts all their tears into his bottle. Having, because of the
necessary connection of these things, thus represented them together, we return
to the third Session of the same Parliament, and its Acts, Where

12. By the first Act thereof, they ratify the former Act anent Ministers, who
entered in, and since the year 1649, and such who keep not the Diocesian
meetings, and do recommend to the privy Council the effectual execution
theirof, and to call all such Ministers, who dare to preach in contempt of that
Act to be punished as Seditious persons, and also to be careful to remove and
dispossess such who should be Suspended or Deprived for nonconforming,
declaring that if they thereafter presume to exercise their Ministry, they
should be punished as Seditious persons. Thus, in the height of Perfidy and
Violence, men under the pretext of abused and perverted Authority, proceed to
dare and presume against God, their own Conscienc^^ and all their Sacred and
Indissoluble Oaths and Engagements, and to persecut such for preaching, who,
standing steadfast therein, and having a dispensation of the Gospel committed
unto them, by him who is King in Zion and higher then the Kings of the Earth,
may and out to contemn the menaces of vain Man, in regard of that heavy and
severe woe sounding in their ears, if they preach not the Gospel; But the Act
does further proceed, to require of all, a due Acknowledgement of, and hearty
Compliance with the Kings Government Ecclesiastical and Civil, and therefore to
ordain and declare, that who ever shall ordinarily and wilfully withdraw and
absent themselves, from the ordinary Meetings for divine Worship in their own
Churches on the Lords day, whether upon the account of Popery or other
dissaffection, shall incur, each Heritor the loss of a fourth of that years
rent, each Yeoman the loss of a fourth (or under) of his movables, each
Burgess the loss of his Liberty and Burgeship with the fourth of his movables,
and concludes with a reference to the Council for further punishment, and more
effectual execution, likeas in order hereunto the Council by several
Proclamations since, have so much intended the severity of this Act, that every
Parish in stead of having a Lawful Pastor, is now inslaved to a Graceless,
Violent Hireling as it is Lord and Master, and to the extortion of Soldiers
appointed for his Executioners and Exactors.

We shall not here debate the Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of the Obedience here
required, only for the vindication of many thousands of the Faithful, who by
their sufferings have born Testimony against this Act; we add, 1. that waving
the ordinary and captious manner of proposing the question in the terms of
Hearing or nor Hearing, which strickly taken, are not the subject thereof, we
are assured that none seriously pondering the obligation of the Oath of God,
sincerely, really and constantly all the days of our life to endeavor the
extirpation of Prelates and their dependants, but they will acknowledge, that
the owning of, and submitting to the Apostat Curats according to this Act as
our Ministers, is most diametrally opposite thereto: Can we Lawfully Own such
whom we are bound to abhor? Or Submit to such whom we are bound to extirpate?
Surely this were to rebuild what we have destroyed. 2. That though some nimble
Sophisters, who fear not after vows to make inquiry, can and have swallowed
both Owning and Submitting as not repugnant to the duty of Extirpation, yet,
seeing the direct contrary thereof, is by the terms themselves very
significantly imported, and that these terms were for this express cause and
design particularly elected and made choice of by the Parliament, for
ranversing of the Obligation of the holy Covenant, no sober man will be tempted
by their delusion to think, either that Owning and Submitting signify no more
then Simple Submitting, or that that Active Assenting and Complying Submission
here mean'd, is no more then that Still and Passive Submission, unto which men
by the force of inevitable necessity, and against their wills are oftentimes
constrained. 3. That whoever pretending to enter into the Ministry, does
presumptuously contemn and despise the sacred Rule and Order of Entry appointed
by the great Shepherd, cannot be reputed to enter by the Door, nor to be so
much as Externally by him Sent or Called: But such as do enter by gross and
palpable Perjury and wicked Violence and Intrusion, do without question contemn
the sacred Rule and Order of Gods Word, so that to admit such to be so much as
Externally Called were to make the God of Order the Author of Confusion, and
him who is the Truth, the favourer of Perjury. We know that this notion of an
External Call is conceited by many, to be no other thing, then the performance
of such Rites and Solemnities, as are prescribed to the Admission of a
Minister, done by such a Person or Persons, on whom the like has been
performed; but seeing that by many instances of gross Disorder and Violence,
(which are obvious for any man to suppose,) many absurdities might be hence
inferred, and that to be Externally Called according both to the meaning of
Truth, and the import of the words is, to have such a Visible Evidence of the
Call of Jesus Christ, as in Reason and Charity does oblige all men to receave
the person so called, as truly sent; Certainly if any Person force his own
Entry into the Ministry by open and profane Contempt of the Rule and Order
given by our Lord Jesus, he does in like manner as palpably disprove any
Evidence of a Lawful Call, which he can pretend to, and no man is obliged
either to Believe him to be Called or to Receave him as Sent. Which things are
so evident in themselves, that whoever denies them, is obliged by the same
consequence to affirm, that if Simon Magus had in his horrid wickedness
purchased the Apostleship by money, the Christian World had been bound to
Receave him as an Apostle. 4. Though we are not to lanch out into these depths,
how the Soveraignity of Divine Providence has suffered Churches to fall away
into Apostasy, and again recovered them, and if during these times of Apostasy
a standing Ministry still continued, or how long it did; if not, what way it
was revived and raised up, in which cases true Faith in Jesus Christ which is
the substance of all, and a conscientious walking according to the measure of
the times, does certainly purge and sustain many things otherwise chargeable
with Informality; Yet of this wear confident, that it has always been both
the sin and misery of all Apostatizing Churches, that they have not resisted
the beginnings of Defection, and when the Authors theirof did prove
incorrigible, though formerly Ministers, that they did not separate from them,
and account them as Heathens and Publicans, which course, if duly and
zealously observed, had undoubtedly put a great stop and hinderance to the rise
and wicked Usurpation of Antichrist, all whose malice and violence without the
delusion and compliance of such who ought to have resisted them, had never
proven so effectual. 5. That a man may be a Minister, and yet not a Minister
unto all, so as to oblige them to receave him as sent to them, which may be
intuitively understood beyond the light and power of any demonstration, if we
but suppose the case of a particular Congregation, living under, and
acknowledging their own lawful Pastor, and that amongst such, a few violent
persons arising, bring in another Minister by plain force, and cast out their
lawful Pastor, and if it be sincerely resolved what the faithful in that Church
are then obliged to do, surely none will think that they ought instantly to
relinquish their true Pastor, and own and submit to this Intruder, but on the
contrare all must grant that they ought to adhere to their lawful Minister and
not only discountenance and withdraw from the Usurper, but by all lawful means
endeavor his Ejection; which case, if but translated to the present condition
of this oppressed Church under usurping Prelates, will with the same evidence
resolve the question. 6. That whatever construction or interpretation many to
whom it is given to believe but not to suffer, may put upon their hearing of
the Curates, as to the inferring or not inferring their owning of, and
submission to their Ministry, yet this is certain, that as it is the most
probable argument and presumption of owning that can be alleged, so is it
that which this Act requires for to testify both a due acknowledgement of, and
hearty compliance with the present Government by Prelates, and as an undoubted
evidence of the peoples giving their cheerful Concurrence, Countenance and
Assistance to the Curates. 7. That seeing hearing of the Curates by the
acknowledgement of all the more ingenuous is not a duty to which they are moved
by conscience, but rather used by them as a thing though lawful yet arbitrary,
for the eviting a greater inconvenience, and seeing that this Act and every
article theirof is undoubtedly gross and wicked Perfidy against God and his
holy Covenant, commanding the disowning and relinquishing the Lords Ministry
whom we are bound to maintain, and the owning and encouraging by hearing such
vile Intruders as we are bound to extirpate, thereby designing expressly to
involve all as much as is possible in the same Perfidy, and to loose the former
obligation of the Oath of God; whatever may be said in the case abstractly
considered, yet we are persuaded that being thus stated, not hearing becomes a
case of Testimony, and an indispensible duty. 8. That as it is the sin and
misery of all declining times that the zeall of God is at the best rather
wished for as a Blessing, then minded as a Duty; so we are confident that the
true and right zeall of God should, and would not only inspire all with an
unanimous Aversion against the the profane intruding Curates, but animate us as
one man to drive away these Wolves and Thieves, and to eradicate these plants
which our heavenly Father never planted. 9. That though the Curates could
instruct and justify their External Call, yet such are their lies and lightness
by which they cause the people to err, and the visible truth of their vile
Perjury and Prophanity, which they preach and practice, that all serious
observers may easily discover them to be inwardly ravening Wolves under the
sheeps clothing of an pretended external call, of whom in conscience of our
Lords command all ought and should beware. 10. That whatever may be the
difference in these things even amongst the faithful, yet all must aggree and
acknowledge that the violent pressing of such to hear, who upon such probable
grounds from a tender sense of conscience do only plead that Christian,
innocent, and most safe privilege of a peaceable forbearance, is not only
contrare to that ample promise of Indulgence to tender consciences made and
declared by the King from Breda before his return 1660. but is in effect to
violent all conscience, and the hight of oppression and rigor. 11. That as the
grounds laid down may and do sufficiently answer all objections, so therefrom
may be shortly cleared, first, that common and ordinary Sophism, that hearing
and observing the Ordinances is an indispensible Duty from which neither the
wickedness nor frailty of the Minister does loose: But as it may be easily
answered, that this when acknowledged does rather suppose then infer the
complexed lawfulness of hearing Curates as Ministers, and that their Ministry
is the Lords Ordinance, which is plainly denied; so we are also to consider,
that such duties and performances are only acceptable unto the Lord, specially
in the matters of his Worship which are entirely sound and wholly agreeable
unto his will, truly done, in spirit, and altogether performed in truth, Nam
bo^um est ex omni causa, hence it is that the prophanity and wickedness even of
the Lords lawful Priests, let be the Perjury and Profanity of wicked Intruders,
have not only caused the People to abhor the offering of the Lord to the
Priests heavy charge, but eve^ the Lord himself to abhor his sanctuary, and
to account incense an abomination, so that he cannot away with the calling of
assemblies, it is iniquity even the solemn meeting; shall it then be accounted
iniquity for to hate that which the Lord hates, and withdraw from that which he
has forsaken? Ought we not rather to distinguish a holy abhorring from a
profane contempt, though both of them proceed from the Curats sin, and in the
sense thereof rather wish for, and withdraw with Jeremiah unto a cottage in the
wilderness, that there we may mourn for all these abominations; surely were
there no more in this matter but that Holiness becomes the house of God for
ever, and men of clean hands and a pure lip ought to draw near and turn unto
him, it were sufficient to justify the Lords People, who in drawing near to
God, cannot in conscience either regard or make use of the mouths and hands of
these Apostates which are continually filled with lies and violence, as either
sent by the Lord to them-ward, or to be employed by them to Godward, 2. From
these grounds may be cleared that grand objection from our Lords command to the
People of the Jews, Matthew. 23. ver. 2, 3. saying, The Scribes and Pharisees
sit in Moses seat, therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and
do. Whence some infer that even such as without a title do usurp the office
of teachers ought notwithstanding to be both heard and observed; but it is
answered, 1. That it neither appears from the words nor yet from any other
Record, that the Scribes and Pharisees did by intrusion possess themselves of
Moses chair, but on the contrare, as by Moses chair is only understood the
Office of teaching, resolving and judging according to Moses law, to which
although the Levites were appropriate, yet is there is no such determination
thereanent in the Word of God, as can by any manner of inference reject the
Scribes and Pharisees as intruders, so it is more presumable (that, seeing our
Lord in that long Legend of evils and woes pronounced against them, does not in
the least charge them with Intrusion, but rather acknowledge their Vocation by
calling them the Builders) they had thereto lawfully attained. 2. As our Lords
Words bear no command for the People to hear, but only to observe and do what
they heard, rather supposing then allowing that, which though for the time he
endeavored to improve to the best advantage, yet afterward he intended not
only to reform but utterly to abolish, and therefore cannot in reason infer a
command and duty to hear the Curates; so neither our Lords tolerance in this
case can so much as infer it is lawfulness, except the cases were duly stated
and compared, which if any will rationally do, by first supposing that the
Scribes and Pharisees had then lately by gross Perjury and Violence thrust out
the Lords Teachers and intruded themselves into the Office, we are bold to
affirm that our greatest adversaries dare not in this case assert, that our
Lord would so much as in the like words here used have insinuat a simple
toleratio^

13. Hitherto we have only observed the progress of these Acts that directly
tend to the overthrow of Presbytery, and the erecting of Prelacy, but as by the
vilest of Flatteries and most presumptuous of Usurpations, Soveraignity is
puffed up and exalted to that Supremacy, which is the necessary and only
foundation of Prelacy; So it is no wonder if both in the righteous Judgment of
God, and through the influence of this wicked Prelacy, the stay of lawful
Authority become a yoke of Tyranny, and that these Prelates, who make an
absolute surrender of Religion, Conscience and all Sacred Concernments, for the
gratifying, and to the arbitriment of these Powers whose Creatures they have
often Atheistically acknowledged themselves to be, do with the same and greater
profusion subject both Laws, Liberties and the Fortunes of others, to the lust
of the same Powers, which they may so easily pervert unto their own
establishment and advancement: And this indeed is and has always been that
great aggravation of our later Prelacy, rendering the same worse and more
intolerable: then the Romish Hierarchy, which being wholly dependent upon the
Pope, another and distinct head, and not upon the Civil Power, whose interests
are oftentimes not only distinct but directly opposite, it has neither that
access, nor influence to abuse Princes; Whereas our Prelates deriving all their
Power and Being from the Kings Supremacy by endeavoring for their own better
establishment to render him incontrollably absolute over and in all things,
they being otherwise mean and abject persons, having the least and almost no
share nor interest in the Commonwealth, and by reason of their ill Right and
worse Conscience in what they do possess, being always cruelly jealous, have
by sad experience ever inclined the Government unto Tyranny; and as in this
late and worst Catastrophe they have more prevailed then ever formerly they
did, so the following instances do more clearly demonstrate this assertion.

We shall not here repeat these Acts whereby for the better and more easy
establishment of Prelacy then designed, this Parliament for it is first work
under pretense of vindicating and declaring the Kings Just Right and
Prerogative, did in effect wholly corrupt and innovate the well tempered and
firm constitution of our Ancient Government, which both all our Ancient
Histories and Records, the only evidence whereby fundamental Laws are
verifiable, do sufficiently declare, and the long continuance and endurance
thereof, excellently commend. The first thing that thereafter occurs, is that
Act and offer of forty thousand pounds Sterling to the King yearly during his
life, whereby in place of that relaxation from these burdens which the iniquity
of Usurpers had only from time to time imposed, a lasting and perpetual
Imposition, by it is continuance fully exequating the excess of the former, is
entaild upon us, and that for no other end then the complementing of a few
Favorites of Prelacy, and the maintaining of a Military Force over us, for
their and the Prelates security, and the persecution and slavery of the body of
the people opposite thereto. The 2. thing is that rigid, irregular and
exorbitant Fining which we have already mentioned, clearly and unquestionably
carried on and executed, by the same Authors and for the same Design. The 3.
thing is that humble tender made to the King of our duty and loyalty, whereby in
recognizance of the Kings prerogative, and in a further acknowledgement of our
duty, the Parliament by the 25. Act, Session 3. do subject the Persons,
Fortunes and whole strength of the Kingdom to the Kings pleasure and
arbitrament, in that humble (indeed, but also blind and inconsiderat) offer of
20000 foot Men, and 2000 Horsemen sufficiently armed with 40 days Provision, to
be ready upon the Kings call to march to any part of his Dominions for opposing
whatsoever Invasion or Insurrection or for any other service: Which offer,
though possibly many do account it but a voluntary and cheerful expression of
that readiness, which our Ancestors have often witnessed for the defense of
King and Country; yet in effect, if duly considered as concluded under the
force of a Statute and Act of Parliament, in place of that willingness and
readiness alleged, whereunto our Ancestors were from time to time determined,
by these visible and apparent exigencies of the common concernment which did
require it, it will be found no other thing, then an implicit and slavish
Emancipation of our lives and libertyes, to the arbitrament of the Powers,
colored with the pretext of loyal devotion to lawful Authority. But whatever
is herein exorbitant, is without question the proper effect and product of the
jealousy of these Apostate Prelates, whom the inward disquiet of an evil
conscience, causes to apprehend terror round about. The 4. thing, wherein this
wicked prelacy has perverted the Ancient and well constitute Government of
this Realm, is their procuring, erecting, and exercing the High Commission
Court, (without so much as the approbation of that Parliament wherein nothing
would have been refused them, wherein not only Ecclesiastic and Civil
Jurisdiction are absurdly confounded, in impowering secular persons to suspend
and depose, and pretended Churchmen and Ministers to fine, confine and
incarcerate, but the Act. 131. Parl. 8. Iac. 6. discharging all New Courts not
approven in Parliament, directly thereby contraveened; neither will the
Catholicon of the Kings omnipotent Prerogative salve this breach, in respect
the same Prerogative, now in so great vigor, was by the 129 Act of this same 8
Parl Iae. 6. and almost immediately preceding the Act alleged, then also
recently enacted. But who can consider the Arbitrary form of Inquisition and
summar procedour without any shadow of Legal Process, used in the same
Commission, it is tyranny and unwarrantable exacting of Oaths and subscriptions,
with it is new invented, insolent and affronting punishments more cruel to
ingenuous Spirits then death it self, and not be convinced of the gross and
wicked corruption of this State-novelty, or rather monster? The 5. thing which
offers, is the accumulation and in effect the suppression of the ordinary
Offices of State (the very stay and props of regular Government, and the
conduits and channells whereby it is refreshing influences are diffused) with,
and by an extraordinar and superlative power and Office in the single person of
the Kings Commissioner. Certainly as in the multitude of Councellers there is
safety, so on the other hand no King on earth can rule by such an deputation,
who may not as lawfully alienate his Crown: Which devices are all the
inventions of these wicked Prelates, who knowing that if the King should either
hear, see or act, but by such ears, eyes, and hands as they do assign unto
him, their affairs could not long prosper, do by such exorbitancies endeavor
the establishment of their own Tyranny. The 6. thing that occurs is not only
the keeping up of a Military Force to the intolerable burden and slavery of
this free Nation, in so far as the ordinary and civil manner of Legal
Execution, specially for Fines and Ecclesiastical Delinquencies is now
committed to, and managed by Military Force and Violence, and thereby the
manner of exacting often times rendered more hard and insupportable then the
exaction it self; but also that for satisfying the restless jealousies and
endless fears of the evil consciences of these Apostate Prelates, more and
greater forces under the vain pretense of Foreign fears, which both the then
condition and posture of these Wars, the dis-proportion of the Forces
themselves, and the disposal of such as before were leavyed did clearly
redargue, have been leavyed, and are kept on foot, for maintaining whereof the
Public Revenues are mis-applyed, the Fines, when by the Kings favor long
delayed, at length exacted and expended, new Taxations imposed, far exceeding
the quantity of any formerly required, and at length the old Assessment the
great grievance of the late Usurpation of new superadded, and the poor Country
and body of the Land in it is greatest poverty subjected unto, oppressed and
harrassed by more injurious extortions then ever the Conquering sword of an
Foreign Enemy did heretofore, or can probably license: And all these things
clearly intended and carried on for no other end then the support of this
wicked Prelacy, and it is cruel Bondage and Spiritual Tyranny. We need not
mention for an aggravation of these violences, that these Forces were leavyed
by the immediate procurement of the Perfidious Prelates, without the advice of
the King's Council, (ever from the beginning, what ever may be the present
exaltation of Prerogative, reputed to be one with the King, and who both by
Place and Interest are therein indispensibly concerned) seeing it is not the
least of the iniquities and calamities of these times, that the poor Nation and
it is greatest Concernments are by them so basely abandoned. But this we must
take notice of, that though our Adversaries, by reason of the disastrous Events
that lately have happened, do now boast of a most special Providence and
foresight in all these oppressions; yet it would be more just and rational on
their part, to acknowledge that as oppression does even make a wise man mad, so
to see a free Nation, by the Perfidy and Insolent Domineering of a few up-start
Prelates, and the violence of their wicked and slavish Favorites, reduced to
the condition of a most insupportable and unnatural Conquest, both was, is, and
ever will be a most just cause and provocation to all ingenuous Spirits and
true Patriots, to undertake the asserting of their own Liberty, upon the
greatest hazard.

Having thus truly and fully represented the exaltation of Prerogative and
Prelacy, over and above all things Divine and Humane, Sacred or Profane, we
shall briefly add the bitter and cruel fruits and effects of this sinful and
woeful Conspiracy.

1. As the Laws above mentioned, enacted for the overthrow of Presbytery and
the Restoration of this accursed Prelacy, specially in so far as concerns the
Ministry, were and are such as did inevitably infer, either a sinful
compliance with that Perjury and Apostasy whereby they were framed, or the
endurance of the pains and sufferings thereto subjoyned; so almost the whole
faithful Ministers, are thereby first and last not only deprived of their
benefices and livelihood, ejected out of their respective Parishes, and by
imminent and visible force incapacitated from the exercise of their Ministry,
but some of them are Banished, others Confined, and the remnant reduced to such
straits, fears and uncertainties as we have before represented. Then might we
have seen the shepherds smitten, and their flocks scattered, our teachers
removed into corners, and the Lords Vineyard and Sanctuary laid most desolate:
so that in some whole Countries and Provinces no preaching was to be heard;
nor could the Lords day be otherwise known, then by the sorrowful remembrance
of these blessed enjoyments whereof now we are deprived. Oh! though we had not
the zeal and courage of our Ancestors, to have set our selves for the defense
of the Gospel, and the maintenance of the Lords Ministers and Ordinances, of
which we were so perfidiously and violently spoiled, yet that at least we had
remembered, by Prayer and Supplication to God, in the days of our afflictions
and of our miseries, all the pleasant things that we had in the days of old.

2. As this Antichristian spirit did at the first discover it self, in that
height and rage of Prophanity and all Excess, which suddenly overspread the
Land, and did very powerfully and evidently usher in the Restitution of
Prelates; so the same has been ever since by them not only tolerated, but
greatly countenanced and encouraged. We do not here mention their gross and
wicked Toleration of Popery, whereby in their few years it has increased to a
greater hight then ever it attained at any time in this Land since the
Reformation, and that though it has, and does appear in that daring
confidence, as in its avowed idolatrous Masses and seminary Priests amongst us,
to contemn and despise these ancient and standing Laws whereby such things are
often and severely prohibited under the pain of death, yet to this day never
one has been publicly questioned and charged upon that account. The thing
mostly to be noticed is, that the only grievance and eyesore of Prelates is
Conscience and any measure of Tenderness therein; Thence is it that the most
innocent and peaceable Forbearance in not bearing Curates and the like, have
been persecute with all rigor, whereas Adulteries, Blasphemies, Swearing and
Drunkenness are so far from being punished or restrained, that the Committers
thereof are now only the persons most in fashion and favor; yea it has been
known and can be instanced that persons conveened, and questioned, as
disaffected, have either upon the discovery or information of their Profanity
and dissoluteness, been instantly and freely dismissed. Oh that men and
Christians do so little remember our Lords own rule to judge and discern false
prophets by their fruits, whereby he has expressly said that we shall know
them, and that men are so far blinded and bewitched, as not to see the mighty
working of Satan in this Mystery of Iniquity, endeavoring under a mere
shadow and pretense of Formality, to root out the Power and Life of Religion
and Conscience, and to reduce this poor Church unto that Laodicean
luke-warmness more desperate and incurable then coldness and death it self.

3. The faithful Ministers being outed, and the hedge of Presbyterian
Government removed, as prophanity and wickedness does yet more abound, so there
came out of this smoke, Locusts upon our Church, even a crew of Curates for
Insufficiency, Vanity, Lies, and Prophanity, the very Scorn of Reformation and
Scandal of Religion. We need not here adduce particular instances, there is
none who in the least observe their doctrine and manner of conversation but will
easily acknowledge it: And the certainty of what we here affirm is so obvious
unto all, that a particular condescendence would either prove an infinite
labor, or too much abridge the extent of so sad a truth. Its true there are
some who being convinced, and others who supposing the truth of what is here
alleged, do either doubt or deny these; things to be the proper effects of
Prelacy, but rather of the licentiousness of men, and such accidents which may
be incident to the best constitutions: But if it be considered, 1. That that
thing which inseparably and infallibly attends another, may with more then
ordinary probability be concluded to depend thereon by a certain influence: 2.
That that which is no Ordinance of Jesus Christ, but the visible product of the
Devils malice and men's pride and lust, can never be effectual for the
establishing of Truth, or promoting of Holiness. 3. That such who not only
discover in themselves the foresaid evils, but by open and most notorious
Perjury do usurp and invade and hold the Offices they pretend to, must of
necessity hate the light because their deeds are evil; it will be very easily
granted that Prelacy, Prelates, and their dependants, to whom all these things
are clearly applicable, are not only the proper causes and authors of all the
Prophanity and Wickedness under which this poor Land now perishes; but most
naturally introductive unto all these Superstitions and Abominations, wherein
the Devil by the same means did, and has involved the Christian World under
the Roman Papacy.

4. The Prelates and Curates being thus established, from the ground and
warrant of the Acts mentioned, several Proclamations and Edicts, for the more
effectual execution thereof and pressing conformity thereunto, and for the
suppressing conscientious adherence to, or (so much as is possible) the very
remembrance of our former Engagements and Covenants, and the holy Ministry and
Government therein contained, are emitted and published. We have already
mentioned that at Glasgow, and these others to the same purpose which did ensue
upon it. The first what we here note is, that the Prelates conceaving that
their persecutions already practiced and to be practiced, might excite the
compassion of some to a charitable supply of the afflicted; more to express
their cruel malice then really to hinder that, which at best is not worth the
noticing, under the pretext of Dis^rder, they procure a discharge of charitable
Collections. And now let it be here observed once for all, that such is the
cruelty, not only of the malice but of the very Acts, procured by the Prelates
against conscientious Non-conformists, that if they were followed with a
suitable and complete execution, there should remain no comfort to any abiding
steadfast, other then that of Arcadius mercy to the children of Traitors, that
life should be their grief, and death their relief. There was another
Proclamation emitted, at the time of the first planting of the Curates, that
all persons should keep their own Parish Churches, and should not repair to any
other except in case of vacancy, under pain of twenty Shillings Scots toti^s
quo^ies, to the effect that such as could not in conscience attend the Curats
Conventicles, might be also deprived of any mean of edification, which the
opportunity and neighborhood of a faithful Ministry might afford. Then
thereafter there is another Edict published against unwarrantable Preaching,
Praying, or Hearing, whereby even such Exercises, without which the Communion
of Saints can hardly be entertained, are restrained and discharged; in so much,
that if a faithful outed Minister should repair to any private family, or two
or three more then the Domestics of one House be found together, though only
employed in the most Christian and edifying Exercises of Praying, Lecturing or
Godly Conference, their meeting is declared an unlawful Conventicle, and all
such as are accessory, punishable accordingly. By a fourth Proclamation, men
are required to be assistent to, and concur with the Curates in the exercise of
Discipline, as they shall be thereto called, though they be not told either by
what warrant, or in what capacity they are to meddle in the Matters of God; for
our Adversaries do both disown Elders, and allow Deacons no rule. There is a
fifth Proclamation discharging all Conventions and meetings whatsoever under
the pretense of Religion, which are not allowed by Authority, certifying all
persons accessory, that they shall be looked upon and punished by pecuniary and
corporal pains, as seditions persons, at the arbitrament of the Council, and
especially that the Ministers exercising therein, and their resetters or
countenancers in any sort, shall be liable unto the highest pains due to
seditious Persons. And lastly, there is a sixth, commanding all Masters of
Families to cause their Servants and all their dependents, and all Heritors and
Landlords to cause their Tennants and Tax-men to obey all Acts of Parliament or
Council enjoining Conformity, and particularly to frequent their Parish
Churches, and to submit and conform to the Curates their Ministry, or else to
remove them summarly from their service, and eject them out of their
Possessions: And also that Heritors take bond and security of their intrant
Tennants in time coming, that they and their Cottars and Servants, shall give
obedience as said is; and lastly, that all Magistrates of Burghs cause their
Inhabitants give Bond for the like obedience; for which effects, these Heritors
and Magistrates are warranded to charge them under the pain of Rebellion: And
whosoever shall contraveen this Edict is certified and declared liable to the
same pains due to the Non-conformists themselves, for whom he hereby is made
answerable. This is the last Act and Proclamation for Conformity not only in
course, but even in the utmost of extremity and rigor, whereby, as many persons
having a freedom as to their own practice, are further urged, contrare to all
the rules of charity and moderation, to compel others toward whom they may
rather desire a Christian Forbearance and Indulgence to be used; so the
generality of the Land without any exception whatsoever, are reached, and
obliged to all the Compliance with, and Conformity to this wicked Apostasy, and
accursed and abjured Prelacy, whereof they are capable, and that under such
Pains, as if generally incurred and execute, should infallibly reduce the Land
to utter Desolation and confusion. But the Lord hears and regards, and Oh
that men would also hear the voice of this poor Church, that bewaileth her self
and spreads out her hands, saying, VVoe is me now, for my soul is weary
because of Murderers.

5. As we have observed the Tyranny and Illegali^^ of the High Commission
granted for executing these Ecclesiastic Acts and Edicts, both in it is
Constitution and Procedor, so we do further observe that whatever Novelties and
Extravagancies the Commssion it self contain, yet the Practices of the Court,
having no other Precedent in the Christian World, save that of the Spanish
Inquisition, do far exceed them. For 1. as persons are brought before them,
either by Seizure or summar Citation without any cause signified, but to answer
super inquirendis, contrary to an express standing Law Iac. 6. Parl. 10. cap.
13. 1585. which was also enacted when the Kings Prerogative was fresh and in
full vigor; so at their Compearance, they have neither Libel nor Accuser, but
are constrained instantly to make answer to whatsoever question the arbitriment
of the Archprelat pleases to demand. 2. As there is no time for advice
permitted, so neither are lawful Defenses received or admitted; but if any
person do offer to propone any matter of that kind, he is required first to
take the Oath of Supremacy, or some such Engagement or Subscription which they
are assured he will refuse. Thus a Gentleman of the Name of Porte^field, being
conveened before them, and questioned for not owning the Curate, he answers,
that his not hearing the Curate, could import no disaffection, nor bring him
under the compass of the Law, because the Curate had calumniated him by such
vile opprobries and reproaches, as were both scandalous in a Minister, and just
ground of resentment to any ingenuous Spirit, as he was able to prove by
sufficient witnesses: This the Court having sustained as relevant, and the
Gentleman having adduced his witnesses, and one of them being examined and
clearly proving, all further procedor is stopped, and he required to take the
Oath of Supremacy, which he having refused, they sentence him in a great
Pecuniary Fine, and confine his person far North, to the Town of ^lgin. 3. If
any person conveened do clearly answer all their Questions and Demands, so that
he cannot be in that manner reached, then they require him in a most Arbitrary
way. either to take the Oath of Supremacy or some other subscription for
obedience to Ecclesiastic Laws, or any other bond or security they please to
require: In which their Tyranny they are so inconsequent, that they neither
remember that Laws are made to be Obeyed and not subscribed, and that
Obedience is secured by their own sanction, and not by the Peoples handwriting,
nor that the main objection by which they themselves do impugn the Covenant,
and whereon the Declaration against it, is expressly founded, is that the same
was taken by, and imposed upon the Subjects of this Kingdom against the
sundamental laws and liberties of the same which is not more falls if applied to
these holy Covenants, (which were expressly founded, both upon the Word of God,
and the free consent of the body of the People, and most necessarly intended
for the glory of God and the defense of Religion and Liberty, which are the
foundations of all foundamentals, besides the accession of both Law and
Authority by which they were warranted) then true and evident in order to the
case in hand, it being most certain, that whatever may be the extent of the
Peoples Surrender under any Constitution; for the enforcing of their Obedience
or Submission, yet the liberty of Persuasion is so undoubtedly understood to be
reserved, that it cannot be abridged by any imposed Oath or Subscription,
without their own consent. We know the Council has both the power, and is in
use to take Bond for keeping the Peace, but this is a practice so clearly
warranted by Law, and so antecedently sounded in reason and humanity, upon just
and probable presumptions, to secure the Peace by bond, which they might do by
the persons imprisonment, that the parity is alleged with as little reason, as
the practice controverted is void of equity: Notwithstanding of all which,
there is but one course before that Commission-Court, without mitigation either
to Banish, or Fine, or Confine (or both) the persons refusing. 4. If any do in
his answers or demeanor offend, or be discovered thereby in the least to be
guilty, they proceed to sentence without any breathing or intermission, wherein
they so little observe the Warrant of their Power and Commission, that they
oftentimes exceed all the proportion either of Law or Reason: For verifying
whereof, let but the instances subjoined be considered, where we shall find
persons 1. Stigmatized and Banished for not conforming, which neither their
first nor second Commission, bearing only Power to ^ine, Confine and Imprison,
nor the Laws whereupon they could proceed, give warrant to do. We know the
first Commission that was printed, was afterward renewed with some ex^ension
and not printed, but though some copies thereof in write were spread abroad
with power to stigmatize and banish, yet neither does the Principal contain any
such warrant, nor can the extension therein made, infer the same in any sort,
without admitting that the same Court consisting of many members constituent of
the Secret Council, might Proteus-like transfigure themselves into this form in
a moment. 2. We shall find men sentenced not only to Banishment, but to
Deportation and Slavery, viz. to be carried to Barbados, where, being poor men
and not able to redeem their Liberty, they must undoubtedly be sold; a
punishment, which not only the disproportion of their delinquencies, but the
whole tenor of our Laws, and the undoubted Privilege of Christianity, does
reprobate and condemn. These things duly considered and compared, it will be
more then evident, that our Oppressions and Grievances by reason of this Court
alone, do far exceed all the pressures and injuries of that Spanish
Inquisition, whereupon the United Provinces have justified and approved their
revolt from under the King of Spain, to all Protestant States and Churches.

6. As these Acts and Proclamations are very Wickedness; so their Execution
has been only Rigor and Cruelty, It were endless to enumerate all the
distresses that have hereupon ensued upon particular persons and Families, unto
the imprisonment of many, confinement of some, deportation of others to remote
Islands, chasing of others to sore and anxious wanderings, and scattering of
Families unto beggary. Any who can conceave the Wickedness and Violence that
did prompt the Prelates to the making of these Acts and Statutes, the arbitrary
Power of the High Commission by which they were enforced, and the rage,
violence and rapine that attends Military Force by which they were and are
executed, may possibly conceave some part of these evils; which, lest the
strangeness thereof do render altogether improbable to men unacquainted, we
shall here subjoin a few instances of many, of the Procedors of the High
Commission Court, leaving these of Military Force unto a more proper place. The
Parish of An^rum had been in former times under the blessing of Mr John
L^vings^on his Ministry, who being banished the Kingdom for no other cause then
his eminency and stedfastness in the Work of God, and refusing the Oath of
Supremacy, there is obtruded by the Bishop upon them in his place, one Scot, an
old excommunicate ^urate, continuing under that sentence and in his wickedness
that procured the same, for which cause mainly, he is now complemented and
rewarded with the accession of this Kirk and Benefice, to two others, which he
still brooks and enjoyes, though very far distant from this place. This man
coming amongst them, such as feared the Lord, and remembered his Work and
Covenant, are stirred up in the Zeal of God to testify against his Intrusion,
whom, being a Person excommunicate, entering by gross Perjury, without their
consent, and only seeking after the fleece and Benefice, all that love our Lord
Jesus and the prospering of his pleasure, were bound to abhor and detest: We do
not justify any excess of human passion that might here have been admixed with
the sincere zeal of God, which we are certain in it is worst appearance all men
ought rather to excuse, then therefore condemn that duty, to which not only the
People of that Parish, but the whole Church of Scotland were and are in a
higher measure indispensibly obliged in opposition to the present course of
Apostasy, and for extirpation of the Apostat Prelates. However four men of the
Parish are conveened before the High Commission, where being examined they
acknowledge, that Mr Scot being to preach at Ancrum as their Minister, they
found themselves pressed in conscience to declare to him their dis-satisfaction
with his entry, and that they were present with the rest of the People which
were there at that time. This the Commission, contrary the opinion of the more
sober and most knowing amongst them, take for a confession of guilt, and
immediately proceed to sentence them, as c^ntemners of the Ordinances, to be
scourged through the Town, sugmatized with the ^^tter T at the Cross of
Edinburgh, and thereafter imprisoned, and with the first Ship to be carried to
the Barb^^oes Islands. All which was accordingly performed upon them. Thus
judgment is turned into gail, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock. But
God who sustained his servants with that constancy and courage, that neither
the shame nor pain of scourging and burning, hindered them openly and audibly
to rejoice in the Lord, who counted them wo^thy to suffer for his Name,
beholds also mischief and spite to requite it with his hand. For the same
alleged crime, shortly thereafter they sentence two Brothers, married men, to
be carried to Barbados, and their siste^, a young woman, to be scourged
through the Town of Jedburgh. As for alleged conventi^ling, there is one Mr
Smit^, a Minister seized upon and imprisoned, for no other c^ime then preaching
to, and praying with a few secretly assembled for fear of the P^elates, in the
Name of the Lord, without the least offense objected from any thing there
spoken; who being brought before the Commission, and in his examination and
answers to the Bishop of St Andrews, calling him only Sir, without Lord or
Grace, he is therefore taxed by the Commissioner, to whom he answered very
respectfully, (giving him his accustomed titles) that he knew he was speaking
to Mr James Sharp once a Minister as he himself is. Whereupon there is so great
offense conceaved, that the Commissioner did immediately ordain him to be
carried by the Town-Hangman to the Thieves Hole and there laid in the Irons, in
company with a Fu^ious Fatuous person, who was there loose: An Indignity so
great, unusual and insolent, that although He had behaved himself not only
rudely in his demeanor, (which is the worst that his Adversaries can charge him
with) but had been most flagitious in his life; yet nothing but that Spirit of
Spite and Rebellion that rages Apostats, could prompt Christians to inflict
upon one, who had ever carried so much as the Title of a Minister. But because
the open Iron-grate, whereby this Hole is shut, gave too great access to the
charity and compassion of many persons who came to visit him, he is therefore
upon the third day thereafter carried up to the Iron-house within the T^lbooth,
and continued in his irons and fetters, and thereafter in close Prison, until
by sentence of the same Commission, he was banished and confined to Shetland,
the coldest and wildest of all the Scots Islands; where he was to expect no
other comfort, then the company of some other faithful men, who for not owning
and submitting to the Curats, had been carried there by sentence of the same
Court. And as they did thus sentence a Minister for Exercising, so the same
Court having conveened before them an honest private man... Black, for being
present at an alleged Conventicle, but in effect, at the meeting of a few
Christians for praying and hearing the Lord's Word, without so much as any
other offense pretended; because, according to the example and warrant of the
Primitive Christians, he refused to give His Oath, and thereupon to delate the
names of such as he knew to have been present, and because he was not liberal
in giving St Andrews his titles, the Commissioner ordains him to be scourged
through the Town; although it was well known to the Court, that his information
could give very small evidence, and they were convinced, that his refusal did
not flow from contempt of the King's Authority, but merely and purely from
scruple of Conscience. These are a few instances of many particulars of this
kind which might be alleged, whereof there is no corner in the whole Country,
nor Parish almost in the West, which cannot give evidence; and therefore we do
remitt any more ample confirmation of these things, until we have noted a few
more particulars for clearing thereof.

7. As we have observed the Wickedness of these Ecclesiastic Laws, and the
iniquity and irregularity of the Act of Fining, and the introducing of
Execution by Military Force; (a servitude unheard of and intolerable in any
free Nation) so the evils and oppressions thereof can scarcely be numbered. For
1. Upon pretense of that Proclamation, commanding People to keep their
Parish-Churches, and prohibiting the repairing to any other, except in case of
vacancy under the pain of 20 shillings Scots toties quoties, the soldiers
being disposed upon, to such places which are known to be most averse from this
course of Apostasy, lying at catch for their own advantage, have often taken
the opportunity, where there was but one Church in the bounds still enjoying a
faithful Minister, and many vacancies about, to go and beset that Church in
the time of Divine Worship to the profane disturbance thereof: And thereafter
either to cause call some old roll of the Parishioners, and exact the Fine of
twenty shillings Scots of all others without exception, or respect even to the
license contained in the Proclamation it self in case of vacancy, or to require
an Oath of every person to know to what Parish they belong, and that at the
Church door without permitting them to come forth, until they either give their
Oath or pay the Fine, not only with such cursing, swearing and confusion, as
would make Infidels amazed to see the Lords day so profaned, by Christians
professing the same common Faith; but with such rigor, by taking by force the
Bibles or garments from some poor persons, who have not wherewith to pay, and
insolent beating and wounding of others to the effusion of blood, as may
justify the greatest Barbarity. We need not instance particulars in a truth so
universally known. We proceed to another kind of this same violence, practiced
in other places where Curates are planted; who, to force and compel the people
to that compliance with their Ministry, which in conscience they are bound to
abhor, cause form lists or rolls of such as keep not the Church, and calling
them after sermon, both Men and Women by Name and Surname, they amerciate the
absents in such sums and Fines as they please, and for the most part, far
exceeding the pains contained in the Act of Parliament; whereupon the
Soldiers are immediately warranted to go and exact the same by quartering.
Which Practice is not more unjust in it is illegal and summar procedor, then
rigid and exorbitant; both as to the quantity and the manner of exacting it, by
reason of their riding and quartering - money (which is therewith exacted) and
the other inconveniences which inseparably attend the rapine and violence of
profane soldiers. 3. In many places, not contented thus to Fine and Exact,
the soldiers, on the Lords day, go to private houses, and by plain force
compel and drive to the Church all such as they find, and oftentimes do
insolently beat and abuse persons who by reason of infirmity or sickness are
really unable: A practice so cruel and absurd, that some of themselves have
said, it was our Lord's way to drive buyers and sellers out of the Temple, but
not to drive them into it. 4. As to the exacting and levying of the Parliaments
Fines, the same was done (by a reference of the Council to the Commissioner,
and his orders thereon) in such an oppressive and exorbitant manner as cannot
be paralelled. For 1. Parties of horse being directed to several Shires, when a
party arrived in any Shire, they direct their order to all the persons therein
Fined, intimating to them and every one of them to pay their respective Fines,
with three shillings sterling per diem for every horseman in the party, from
the day and date of their Order until the Fine be paid, and the payment
signified to the commander of the Party: By which extortions, many have been
compelled to pay more for Quartering then the sum and quantity of their Fine;
and during the time of these oppressions, many have computed that the
Sherifdoms of Air and Re^frew, were compelled to pay upon the account of
Quarterings, over and above the Fines, betwixt two and three thousand merks
Scots per diem. 2. There was no defense nor exemption allowed against these
Quarterings; for whether the person fined did liberat himself by taking the
Declaration, or that it was alleged that he was Minor, or an Infant, or never
Charged, or that his Predecessor charged was since Deceased, or that his
predecessor was never Charged, yea Died before he was fined, or that the person
quartered on was only Relict of the person fined (a poor Widow living upon a
mean Joincture) or that the person quartered on had no Relation to the person
fined, save that he lived in the house and place which once pertained to him,
and which this person lawfully Purchased, even before the other was fined; Yet
all was repelled, and no complaint of this rigor and violence could be heard or
received; but on the contrary the complainer (especially if he refused to take
the Declaration) was rejected with most insolent reproaches and menaces. 3.
That both in the up-lifting of the Fine and exacting of the Qwarterings, the
extremity of rigor was used, by dragging some to prison, who either were known
altogether indigent and insolvent, or did offer to renounce the Benefit of the
Act of Indemnity (the forfaulture whereof was the alternative and utmost
certification for not payment of the Fine, contained in the Act of Fining) or
by Plundering, Beating, and Spoiling others without possibility of redress. We
need not adduce Particular Instances for the verification of these things,
seeing they were not done in a corner: But the cry of this violence as it filled
the whole Land; so no doubt it also reached unto the very Heavens, and is
entered in to the ears of Him who hates violence and loves righteousness, who
says unto Princes, remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
justice, take away your exactions from my people. One thing mainly to be
considered is, that as Prelacy is the great cause of all the Sin and Misery
that afflicts us; so was it by the instigation of the same wicked Apostats,
that these Fines so long delayed were thus at length rigorously exacted: And
that for no other purpose, then the leavying of more Forces for their security
and support, and the better strengthening of their Tyranny. Certainly were it
not of the Lord, who, because of our contempt of his glorious Gospel, and
blessed Ministry, has plagued us with stupidity, and smitten us with madness,
blindness and astonishment of heart, to give unto us the reward of our own
hands, and to cause us to eat the fruit of our doings, it were impossible that
rational men after the feeling of so sore grievances, and the teaching of so
many and sad experiences, should still couch under the burden and submitt
themselves to the yoke of a few insignificant Apostate Upstarts, and not rather
acquit themselves like men, by pulling off these vizards of Religion, under
which they mask their villainies, and plucking them out of that Sanctuary and
great refuge of Loyalty, which they do not more pretend then profane by all
their horrid Rebellion against God, and their cruel Persecutions of His
faithful Servants and the Kings true Subjects, which they palliat under this
pretext; to the effect that in the righteous and deserved Punishment of these
wicked men, both the sin and Backsliding of the Land might be sisted, and the
fierce anger of the Lord averted.

This is the wickedness and violence of accursed Prelacy, which though it has
diffused it self over the whole Land, and left no corner thereof untouched, yet
as the West has been more grievously thereby oppressed and afflicted, so poor
Galloway in a manner has been the point in which all it is malice and Tyranny
has been concentred. We need not here search after Particulars, or be curious
for the verification thereof; the cries and groans of that afflicted Country
have filled all men's ears, and the desolations thereof are obvious to every
ones eyes: Nor need we insist to purge their innocence or clear the causes of
their sufferings, which were no other then their adherence to their faithful
Ministers (though casten out and rejected by men, yet continuing through the
grace of God, to preach amongst them) and their detestation of a crew of
unworthy Curates (scatterers and devourers, not Pastors of the flock) thrust in
amongst them more violently then upon any other part of the Country. The thing
we have here to observe is, that the manner of their persecution was first and
last by plain Hostile Invasion. After which manner Sir James Turner with his
Forces (having twice before been amongst them) in March 1666, with greater
power and fury then ever formerly, marches against them: where being arrived,
what exactions, oppressions and insolences, he and his forces committed by
arbitrary fining, plundering, quartering, imprisoning, beating, wounding,
binding men like beasts, chasing to moors and mountains, and by harassing and
laying both Parishes and Countrey-sides almost wholly desolate; the ruin and
beggary of several hundreds of families, and the impoveverishing and great
distress of many others do abundantly testify: And yet after all these
atrocious injuries, by the contrivance and authority of the Bishop of Galloway,
(who sometimes appeared so zealous for the Covenant and Work of God, that,
frequently in his administration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the
People of his own Parish, while he was a private Minister, when they were set
at Table and ready to Participate, he caused them to renew the Oath of the
Covenant, subjoining thereto both that solemnity and these words used by
Nehemia, Chap. 5.13. when in the like case he did shake his lap, and said, so
God shake out every man from his house and from his labor, that performs not
this promise, even thus be he shaken out and emptied) by the prescription, we
say, of the same Bishop and his Synod, these poor oppressed people, after all
these exactions, are urged and compelled to subscribe an acknowledgement that
Sir James had used them civilly and discreetly; whereby they were forced not
only to deny common sense, and lay aside their just resentments, but by this
their Subscription (which might be opposed to all their complaints) they were
virtually excluded from all hope of redress. All which things are not only
confirmed by the notoriety of the matter of fact, but are also by that grievous
and mournful Paper of their sufferings, most amply cleared and instructed. To
which though Sir James has made an answer for his own vindication, yet seeing
the same does for the most part resolve in a simple denial (which it was easy
for him to make, having neither accuser nor contradicter) and he at most gives
only an account of, and vindicateth his orders, without so much as denying the
excess, that might have ensued in that military way of execution, (expressly
waving to answer the extortions of these parties, which were commissionated for
civil Fines) any further reply were superfluous.

This poor people having continued and lain under all these miseries, for the
space of seven months and upward after Sir James his third Invasion, and
thereby witnessed not only their very firm and Christian Patience toward God;
but also given a greater testimony of their loyally and submission to the
King's commands, then all the flattering and flaunting professions of these
their adversaries (who rather then to suffer the hundred part of these
hardships, would curse both God and their King) will amount to: And knowing by
sad experience, that both Separat Petitioning had been by Sir James insolently
rejected, and that Joint Petitioning was by Act of Parliament condemned, and
consequently all hope this way being cut off, upon an very Accidental and
Indeliberat Occasion, they were stirred up and gave the rise to the actions and
commotions following; which was thus.

Sir James still breathing forth persecutions, upon the 13 of November last,
orders four soldiers, from Dumfreis to the Parish of Dalray in Galloway, to
poind a poor old man's goods; and in case they should find none, to seize and
apprehend his person, and bring him prisoner to Dumfries. The soldiers in
prosecution of this order, apprehending the old innocent man, bind him hand and
foot like a beast, and lay him bound upon the ground, ready to be carried
along. When two or three of his neighbors, commoyed with so great an
indignity, come and desire the soldiers to loose him, they, in stead of
satisfying their desire, suddenly assault the Contrymen with their swords
drawn, and necessitat them to their own defense: Whereupon one of the
soldiers being wounded, the other three throw down their Arms, and the poor
man is relieved, The Countrymen, having thus accquited themselves against
these first aggressors, in prosecution of their own necessary defense, against
the violence of 10 or 12 more soldiers, who were oppressing in the same
Parish, (whom now they had greater cause to fear then before) upon the morrow
thereafter, with the assistance of 6 or 7 whom they joined to themselves, they
quietly seize upon and secure them, all of them rendering their Arms, except
one who was killed in his resistance. After this, the Country being a little
hereby alarmed, but most of all determined by their former sad experience, that
Sir James would certainly avenge himself of this affront, upon the whole
Country without distinction of free and unfree, and that in fury and rage, as
far exceeding his former persecutions, as the cause was different, they gather
to the number 54 Horsemen with some few Footmen, and instantly resolving upon
it, they march toward Dumfreis; where upon the 15 of November they take Sir
James prisoner, and disarm the Soldiers that were with him without harm or
violence to any, except the wounding of one man who made more obstinate
resistance. Being thus by the overruling hand of Divine Providence, and the
force of irresistible necessity, more then by any human contrivance, engaged in
a business of this importance beyond all hope of retreat; and considering how
many in the West and els-where, did groan under the yoke of this wicked
Prelacy, and did suffer by their Tyranny, whom the just apprehension of that
rigor and cruelty, to which the report of what had happened would enrage the
adversaries against all without distinction, might persuade yea necessitat to a
conjunction, they from Dumfreis move toward the West. In the mean time, the
report being brought to the Council, the Archbishop Presiding and overruling
in it, Lieut. General Dalzel is immediately ordered to march with all the Forces
toward Glasgow; which accordingly was done, with more have, rage and fury, then
if 10000 Infidels had with fire and sword invaded the Land: And a Proclamation
is emitted against the Rebels (as they called them) risen in Arms in Galloway,
Air, and other Places of the West, (when as at this time there were not 40 Men
in the Sherifdom of Air, who had joined with them) declaring this Insurrection
to be manifest and horrid Rebellion, and therefore charging the persons
accessory, to lay down Arms within 24 hours after publication, without any
assurance of Indemnity offered, and lastly, commanding the whole Subjects to be
assisting to the Lieutenant General, and being required by him or others in
Authority, to rise in Arms, and assist with all their Power, under the Pain of
Rebellion. A Proclamation so full of fury and madness, not only rendering such
as were in Arms desperate without hope, except in the cruel mercy of the wicked
Prelates; But also engaging all without distinction, either Actively to concur
to the destroying of these poor, innocent and afflicted People, or else to
prepare themselves for suffering the same pains and punishment, that it may
justly be wondered at, that even the single motive of this Proclamation, did
not procure, to these Galloway-men, a greater concourse. But that poor
hand-full being come toward the West, and some hundreds there, (whom partly
the like pressures and fears of worse, but most of all, the sense and
remembrance of the indispensible obligation of the Holy Covenant, for mutual
sympathy and defense, and our uttermost endeavors all the days of our lives
to prosecute the great and blessed Ends thereof, did thereto determine) having,
in the sincerity and simplicity of their hearts, joined themselves to that
company, most harmlesly and inoffensively, without the least violence or
exaction done to any, they march through the Country until they come to
Lanerk. Where, upon the consideration of the Lord's wrath, imminent upon the
whole Land by reason of breach of Covenant, and the many horrid Sins thereon
ensuing, and the apprehension of His holy displeasure yet continuing, (whereof,
by many visible and afflicting signs and tokens, they were most sadly
convinced) as men reduced to the last extremity and in great distress (after
the example of Nehemiah and the Jews, Neh. chap. 9, and 10. in the like case)
they resolve and do renew the Solemn League and Covenant: That (at least) by
this Action they might bear Testimony both to the oppressed Cause and Truth of
God and their own innocence. From Lanerk upon the 26 of November they march to
Bathga^e, and the morrow thereafter to Colington, a place about two miles
distant from Edinburgh. That same night Lieut. Genesis Dalzel coming to Calder,
there is a Cessation agreed to betwixt them for that night, and until, upon the
morrow, their grievances and Petition might be presented to the Council; which
they for that effect send to Dalzel to be by him transmitted. But as,
notwithstanding of this Cessation, (and though the same was timously signified
to the Bishop as President of the Council, yet) the Countrey-troops leavyed
about Edinburgh, were not restrained from making an in-fall upon their
Quarters, where they rested securely upon the trust of the Cessation; so upon
the morrow, before almost they were aware, and without giving up the Cessation
agreed to, Dalzel finding a nearer way does almost surprise them: Whereupon
they endeavor to march off, but finding the Enemy so near, they are
constrained to stand to and prepare for that Conflict upon the South of
Pentland-hils: Wherein the Lient General's forces and theirs being engaged, the
very time and hour that the Gentleman sent by Dalzel to the Council, was
presenting his letters and the West-land men's Grievances, these poor men not
exceeding eight or nine hundreds, and extremly weakened and spent by sore
travail and watching, and mostly by their fasting and great abstinence, are
(according to the Holy, Wise and determinate Counsel of God) a little after
sunset routed and dissipated. The number of the slain on both sides were
reckoned, about 40 and upwards of the Westland men, and 4 or 5 of the Generals
Forces. The number of the prisoners was greater, amounting in all to 130 and
upward: But, because the thread of this story has precipitated our Narration
to this fatal period, the observations following will supply what is ommitted.

1. That these men who rose in the West, were not only (for the most part)
persons of known and very exemplar integrity, piety and zeal for God* and all
of them (severally and jointly) so far from base and turbulent designs, that
they cannot be supponed by any who know them, to have been Ambitious of either
Rule or Riches* but also did with the same straightness and sincerity, in all
parts declare, that their only Motives were the rigor of extreme Necessity,
which constrained them to the defense of Religion and Liberty, and the
Conscience of that indispensible duty, we all owe to God and one to another,
in the bond of the Holy Covenant; and in the innocence of a most harmless
deportment, did fully conform themselves to these professions: so that it may
truly be affirmed, that a company of more sincere, upright and harmless men,
did never in any age appear in such a posture. Which as it does eminently
appear, in their sparing and civil usage of Sir James Turner, and their great
abstinence and moderation in all places, not only from Plunder and such
insolences, but even from the necessary means of Subsistence; so it is a truth
so certain, that all their enemies (save a few profane Curates, who spare no
lies whereby they may vent their malice) must and do acknowledge it.

2. That as in many places, there were many found who joined themselves to the
Lieut. General's Forces, to assist against and suppress that faithful
afflicted company; so the Militia of Edinburgh (by order from the Secret
Council to the Town-Council, and from the Town-Council to the several Captains,
who did administrate it to their respective Companies) did, in opposition to
the same persons, take the following Oath, viz. I shall be true and faithful to
the King, and shall defend his Authority and maintain the same, against this
Insurrection and Rebellion, and any other that shall happen, with the hazard of
my life and fortune; And the two Shires of Middle and East Lauthians did arm
very readily against them: But whether this Insurrection was in Rebellion
against the King, or whether this Conjuration and these Practices, were not a
manifest Conspiracy and horrid Rebellion against the great God, a few
reflections on what we have premised shall hereafter clear.

3. That as only the force of Necessity, from the rigor of their persecutions,
and the cutting off of all liberty to Petition or hope of Redress, did compel
the West-land men to this course; so upon the first appearance and most slender
insinuation of liberty to Represent Grievances to these in Authority, they very
wilingly and readily embraced the opportunity, and signified to the Council,
that the only evil under which the Land perishes, is the Erecting of this
wicked and tyrannous Prelacy contrary to the Holy Covenant, and the cruel
oppression, both in Body and Conscience of all that desire to continue
Faithful therein: but how they were abused in this offer and Transaction, we
have before related.

4. That though the wicked Prelates (for the greater exaltation of their pride
and triumph, both over God and his Cause) have boldly affirmed, that these men
were by certain Faithful Ministers persuaded and brought out, in the full
assurance of most certain Victory, and that their Cause was such, that upon the
Event they could venture their salvation; yet the contrary is most certainly
known, and that they came out, for the most part, most voluntarly and of their
own accord; thinking it their duty (as one of them in his Testimony does
declare) to appear for and help the Lord against the mighty: And that, though
they had and still retain a most firm persuasion of the justice of the Lord's
Cause and Covenant, and a very confident assurance that the Lord will arise and
own it, to the utter confusion of His adversaries; Yet, knowing that Times and
Seasons are in the Lord's hand, and that the time has already been, when such
who had indignation, and whose heart was against the holy Covenant did prosper,
and by Arms pollute the Sanctuary of strength, and place the Abomination that
makes desolate, wherein, though the people that did know their God were strong
and did exploits, yet did they fall by the sword, and by flame, and by
captivity, and by spoil many days; These men did neither limit the Holy One,
nor balance their resolution upon the assurance of future Events: Yea the fear
and apprehension of these many visible signs attending this Action, whereby the
Lord's standing controversy and continuing displeasure against the Land, for
fearful breach of Covenant, and the many horrible sins that have ensued (which
then more then ever were discovered, both in the actual opposition of many,
and faint withdrawing of others, of whom better things were looked for) did
justly make them conceave, that as the Lord, who has ever glorified His own
Name, would also now glorify it, both in their active and passive Testimony (a
seal which His Work and Cause, has not hitherto so visibly had) And that they
were rather thereto called, then to be the Lands Deliverers; for which, all
that fear the Lord may think with trembling, greater judgments are yet ordained.

5. That amongst the many observable providence of God, whereby he brought
this Action to it is period, their turning from Lanerk toward Edinburgh, and
leaving the West, specially these parts where many faithful men were preparing
for a Conjunction, does bear the very eminent characters of the Lord's Work and
Purpose, which he has since made manifest; and was the occasion of the
proscribing of several both Ministers and Gentlemen, as we shall hereafter
mention.

6. That as the Louthian-men were very active in appearing against this
faithful company; so after the Conflict, they were very vigilant and inhumane
to take and spoil all such flyers as they rencountred: A sin which no doubt, by
reason of it is greater aggravations, the Lord will require with greater
severity, then that of Edom, Obad. 12. etc. who rejoiced over the children of
Judah in the day of their destruction; and laid hands on their substance in the
day of their calamity, who stood in the cross way to cut off such as did
escape, and delivered up these that did remain in the day of distress; and
therefore he is threatened by the Lord, that for his violence against his
brother, shame should cover him, and he should be cut off for ever.

Thus we have seen the indignation of the Lord; in the most dreadful and
astonishing of all judgments, even his suffering and causing the righteous to
fall before the wicked, in delivering the soul of his turtle dove unto the
multitude of the wicked; His Name unto reproach and blasphemy, His Strength
into captivity, and His Glory into the enemies hands: A providence that may
justly move our astonishment to a greater height then that of Iosuah chap 7. v.
9. Oh Lord, what will thou do unto thy great Name? And how terrible are the
charge and succeeding Judgments which these things do denounce? But the Lord
who in wrath remembers mercy, makes both judgment and mercy his peoples song;
and it is to his enemies alone, that a cup without mixture is poured out; as
the things which follow will declare.

The Arcbishop of St. Andrews having caused celebrat the report of this
Victory, with almost as many Guns from the Castle as there were men slain in
the fields, and as if the 40 had been 40000 Infidels, the prisoners are brought
in, and secured. We cannot but here mention the ready and charitable relief,
which many good people in Edinburgh did then extend to them; certainly it is
gone up for a Memorial before God, and shall have a return. But who can express
the malice of that Antichristian spirit, raging both in the Arch-Prelate and
his dependents, which misery it self does not satiate; and therefore they do so
exclaim against this poor expression of humanity, as preposterous and savouring
of disaffection, that even some of their own Accomplices did condemn them for it.

The Council falling immediately to the examination of the Prisoners, they
remitt first 10, thereafter 14 to the Justices to be arraigned or rather
condemned as Traitors, they having first determined and prescribed the very
manner of their execution: and about the same time the Commissioner going West,
with some others empowered for that effect, do likewise at Air and Glasgow
condemn other sixteen. These things we join together, because both their
Indictments, manner of Trial, Doom and Execution were the same, except in so
far as shall be noted. The Indictment and Charge of Treason exhibited against
all, consisted of two heads and crimes, deduced from old and late Acts of
Parliament, and aggravated by many circumstances, viz. rising and gathering in
Arms, and renewing the Covenant without and against the Kings Authority and
consent: Every one's particular accession was libelled from, and proven by his
own confession before the Council. This place might require a large digression
for answering the crimes objected, and clearing the innocence of the Lord's
Witnesses; but seeing the preceding Narration does not only furnish all
arguments thereto requisite, but warranteth them by Precedents beyond
contradiction, it shall suffice now to observe.

1. That God the Fountain of all Power, and Author of all Right, as, wherever
he has granted to any creature a Being, he has also armed it with a love and
power of Self-preservation suitable to it is capacity; so much more, where, unto
a Being, He has superadded a Right, as in all rational creatures, which
cannot be violated but both by Force and Injury, has He granted both the Power
and Right of Self-defence, which is really one and the same thing with it, and
in effect nothing else but that divine Impress and rational Instinct, whereby
the very course of Nature is upholden, so inseparable from the Being and Right
of the creature, that it never cease, except where by the Sovereign Will and
Law of God, the Right is first annulled and the Being may be destroyed. Which
position, being the clear and true foundation of all Rule and Righteousness,
and even of the Being of all things, it may justly be wondered, that men should
be found, who deny and would subvert it in it is first, principal and most
immediate effects. But if according hereunto any will subsume and prove, that
either by the Lord's ordaining of powers, or men's Surrendar and Submission
thereto, (made mainly for Self-preservation,) the foresaid Right and Power was
or could be revoked or renounced, we shall most willingly quite the plea, and
prostitute our selves to all the violences that Tyranny can invent, since in
that case there could be no Injury.

2. That as all Societies, Governments and Laws are appointed in a due
Subordination to God and His superior Will and Law, for His Glory and the
Common Good of the People, including the safety of every individual; so, if
either this Subordination be notoriously infringed, or these Ends intollerably
perverted, the common tie of both Society, Government and Law, is in so far
dissolved. Hence is it that a King or Rulers commanding things directly
contrary to the Law of God, may be and have been justly disobeyed, and by fury
or folly destroying or alienating the Kingdom, may be and have been lawfully
resisted. These are conclusions which our greatest Adversaries cannot but
admit, and are not deducible from any other premises. Let us hear King James,
whose loyalty none can doubt, in a speech to the Parliament in the year 1609.
he says, a King degenerateth into a Tyrant when he leaves to rule by Law,
much more when he begins to invade his Subjects persons, rights and
liberties, to set up an arbitrary power, impose unlawful Taxes, raise forces,
make war upon his Subjects, to pillage, plunder, wast and spoil his Kingdoms.
And lest his inconsequence be suspected, as if notwithstanding all this, he
would have a Tyrant incontrolable, it is upon the same grounds, that in his
answer to Cardinal Perron, he justifyeth the Protestants in France their
Defensive Arms; Now how a discretive judgment in these cases, both of
unrighteous commands, and wicked violence, and specially in the later, which is
(by far) the more sensible, does necessarily remain with the People, and in
what manner the same is to be determined and cautioned, so as neither to license
disobedience against Authority, nor create sedition in the Commonwealth, is
already fully cleared.

3. That though all Sovereign Powers, (upon the supposition of these true and
great ends, and the presumption of reason and charity, that the persons
entrusted do in like manner really intend them,) be constituted indefinitly and
therefore in appearance universally without restriction; yet according to this
known rule, that such particulars, as if expressed, would not (far more if they
cannot) be consented to, are not understood to be comprised under a general
condescendence, such exceptions and limitations as are indispensibly employed
and could not lawfully be expressly renounced, do stand in full force. Whereupon
also both the Righteousness of God's judgments, and the Lawfullness of the
Peoples Resistance against mal-versing Powers, are clearly and certainly
founded.

4. That not only the light of Nature and undeniable Reason together with the
agreeable Practice of all Nations, specially of our Ancestors, do evidently
clear these Principles proposed, but also our own express Statutes declaring
the revealed Word and Will of God to be the Superior Rule and Law, and
repealing all Acts repugnant thereto. Iac. 6. Par. 1. chap. 3, 4, and 8. and
explaining such Acts as were generally made against unlawful Convocations and
Leagues and Bonds among Subjects, to be understood with this due Subordination
and limitation Car. 1. Par. 1. c. 29. together with the King and Peoples Oaths
of faithful Administration and Alleadgeance: whereby the Coronation-Covenant
and Contract, specially that made with this King (the very bond of the Kingdom)
is established and secured, do undoubtedly infer, beyond all contradiction,
that both our Government and Laws are constituted and to be interpreted with
subordination to the Law and Will of God, and in order to these great Ends of
their establishment.

5. That though prevailing Factions have in all times endeavored, by their
most excessive and boundless flatteries, to exalt and extend the Powers to an
equal degree of absoluteness in all Causes and over all Persons, merely for
their own base ends and private advantages; yet if any of these persons would
seriously consider, and would ingenuously declare their opinion, in a
particular application of the case to themselves, what they would account
lawful for them to do either jointly or separately, in case that they were
injuriously and violently invaded to the destruction of their Lives or
Fortunes, or the subversion of their Families and dearest and nearest
Concernments, their resolution in this point would easily justify the practices
of all such, who, esteeming the Glory of God and the maintenance of His Gospel
infinitely preferable to all other Interests whatsoever, do valiantly offer and
expose themselves for the vindication thereof, to the greatest hazards.

6. That through the manifest and notorious Perversion of the great Ends of
Society and Government, the Bond thereof being dissolved, the persons, one or
more thus liberated therefrom, do relapse into their primeve Liberty and
Privilege, and accordingly as the similitude of their case and exigence of
their cause does require, may upon the very same principles again join and
associate for their better Defense and Preservation, as they did at first enter
into Societies.

7. That we being a Nation so solemnly and expressly engaged by Covenant unto
God, and one with another, for the advancing and promoving of these holy and
important Ends therein contained, there lies upon all and every one of us an
indispensible duty, by all possible means to promove the same, not only in our
own conscientious and exemplary walking, and serious admonition and exhortation
toward others; but also in endeavoring (in case of Defection) a National
Reformation, and valiant vindication of the Glory of God, and His Work and
Cause, against all incorrigible Apostates; as we would not not by conniving at
their sin be partakers of their Judgment, and as we would by destroying the
accursed from amongst us, avert the imminent wrath of God from the whole Land
and Nation. Which position as we clearly before asserted, both from the
Profession and Practice of our first Reformers; so, that qualification in the
Covenant, of our endeavors in our places and callings, is most agreeable
thereto: seeing the same does plainly import, that as every one is to confine
himself to his own place and move in his own sphere, while all in their
respective capacities do harmoniously concur in the same work and duty; so if
any in higher place and employment, do not only become remiss and forgetful of
the Oath of God; but, according to the extent and influence of their power,
would seduce and corrupt their inferiors unto their Apostasy, it is both their
place to resist such wickedness and violence, and their calling to endeavor
either the Reformation or Removal of these who prove so contrary to, and
obstructive of the ends whereunto they are ordained. Neither can this inference
appear unwarranted or hard unto any who will impartially consider, that though
the same qualification does in the like manner affect and define all duties
whatsoever, which we owe either to God or our Country; yet it were most absurd
thence to infer, that if these more eminently entrusted should either turn
directly Apostates and enemies to the Christian Faith, or adversaries and
destroyers of the Commonwealth, the people of an inferior degree might not
step forward to occupy the places, and assert the Interests, which these wicked
men had so traitorously forfaulted and deserted. All which must necessarily be
granted, if it be but rightly considered, that as Order and the Observance
thereof, is only a mean subordinate to, and intended for the Glory of God and
the good of the people; so must all the Regulation and Determination thereof be
only admitted, in so far as it is Conducible, and no ways to render it
Destructive or Repugnant to these great Ends of its appointment. From all which
we clearly conclude that their words in the Covenant of Places and Callings, are
no more Restrictive in the cases above mentioned, then a General's command to
his soldiers entering in battle (being thus qualifyed) does impede the
necessity of Succession (in case of the vacancy of any charge, either through
death or desertion) requisite for the obtaining of the proposed end of Victory;
but that they are in effect (specially the antecedent and subjoined words
sincerely, really and constantly, all the days of our life being considered)
rather Exegetick and Ampliative.

8. That whatsoever Laws, Covenants and Engagements were standing and binding
unto us, before this late fearful Apostasy and Defection, they are still in the
sight of God, and in the Consciences of all that fear His Name and mind his
Glory, the rather more strong and obligeing then in the least infringed or
dissolved: It being impossible that such Sacred Oaths (so solemnly sworn unto
the most High) and such Righteous Laws by virtue thereof statuted and enacted,
for the carrying on, and establishment of the Work of God thereby intended,
should be Ambulatory and Mutable at the pleasure of men; specially of such,
who, without regard of God, Conscience, Honor or Honesty, have, in the very
pride and power of Wickedness, not only broken the Lords bands, casten away His
cords, and violently (under the pretext of abused Authority) overturned his
whole Work; but done despite against the same, both by ignominious Burning and
Blaspheming of the Lords holy Covenant. And this Position Rescissory we oppose
unto their great Act Rescissory, and to all Acts and practices of the like
nature antecedent thereto, or dependent thereupon. Being fully persuaded, that,
though now they appear unequally balanced, yet the Lord shall declare from
heaven His Righteousness, and laugh at His enemies Acts and Devises, and have
them all in derision.

9. That though we do heartily approve their (...) veneration and just esteem
of lawful Authority, (the great and excellent Ordinance of God) who to prevent
all prejudice that it may incur, and inconvenience that may ensue thereon, do
so far transmit this respect to the person therewith vested, as to hold for a
Maxim (but indeed equally against Religion, Reason and Experience) that the
King does no wrong; And though we are persuaded, that the true rise and cause
of the sin and calamity under which we lie, is from the malice, perjury,
flattery and violence of that Antichristian spirit ruling in the apostat
Prelates; and therefore would willingly cloth our selves, even in the sight of
man, with that ample Allowance and full Authority, whereby the King did once
approve the holy Covenant, and countenance the Lords Work, as if the same did
yet stand (as it ought) not retracted or repealed. Yet seeing our late
Parliament by their second Act, Session second, have reprobated and discharged
all pretenses of Authority in this kind, notwithstanding that the same has
been and may be most necessary in many cases, for the preserving of the
Kingdom, and salving of State-inconveniences; we do therefore rather subsist on
the former grounds, and turn our complaint and prayer unto God, who is the
great King over all, looking for His appearance, and waiting for His salvation.

10. That the Glory of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Defense and
Maintenance of the blessed Gospel, and it is precious Ministry and Ordinances,
are Duties and Concernments infinitely more important, then the defense and
preservation of our Lives, Liberties and the Commonwealth, against the most
barbarous and horrid violences and injuries that can be imagined: Like-as, the
violation and destruction of all these is so evidently designed, and wickedly
practiced, by this late and present Apostasy, that a clearer ground and cause
of Self-defence and Reformation cannot possibly be supposed; so that to
condescend to answer the peevish clamours of these Neutral and careless men,
who say, what needs all this noise for the extrinsick and arbitrary forms of
Government and modes of Worship, both with and without which, Religion and
Righteousness have equally flourished and prospered? where to shut our eyes
from beholding the Glory and Grace of God, that in this Land has so visibly
appeared in, and been advanced by this great Ordinance of PRESBYTERY, by
Himself (for that end) appointed; and also from the observing of these deludges
of Profanity, Wickedness, Superstition and Violence, which the Devil, by his
great engine of PRELACY, has always and in all Churches caused and procured.

11. That as such was the State, Condition and Engagements of this Church and
Kingdom, at the time of the King's return, and before the re-erecting of this
Prelacy, that all and every one of the Nation were most strictly obliged
sincerely, really and constantly to have resisted and opposed this wicked
Defection to the last drop of their blood; so the sinful compliance of many,
and woeful fainting and withdrawing of others, might indeed incapacitat such as
remain faithful from the best, but neither could nor can dis-engage them from
their utmost endeavors.

From these grounds and what has been formerly represented, the argument of
the Indictment of Treason abovementioned viz. That all Convocations and
Risings in Arms, or Subjects entering in Leagues, without or against the Kings
Authority, are treasonable: But such was the late Rising and renewing of the
Covenant, Therefore etc. May be easily and clearly answered, that all such
Risings and entering into Leagues, as are not warranded and commanded by the
Superior Law and Authority of God (who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords)
which by our own express Acts and Statutes are acknowledged, and are not
founded upon the Fundamental Right, and necessarily intended for the
preservation of Religion and Righteousness, the great and principal End of all
Laws and Governments, according whereunto our Laws have also by posterior
Statutes been expressly interpreted, are indeed treasonable: But such the late
Rising was not; but on the contrary was more clearly approven by these grounds,
then any other the like Instance which can be adduced or instructed, from the
parallel of any other Age or Nation; Therefore it was altogether Lawful,
Righteous and Necessary. Which answer, though the Lords faithful Witnesses did
sufficiently insinuat and propone, yet both the Constitution of the Court, and
persons of the Judges before whom they were arraigned, were such, as the same
was rather accounted an aggravation of their Crime and Treason.

But seeing this was not done, without the specious pretexts, not only of
iniquous Laws, but also of Religion and Scripture; We shall briefly consider,
first, that Queree often made to them, where they had read or how they could
instruct, that, under the Pretense of Religion, it is lawful for Subjects to
rise in Rebellion against lawful Authority? To which it is answered, that this
Queree is a clear begging of the question, by expressly supposing that the late
Rising was only in pretense for Religion, but really in Rebellion, which ought
first to have been proved, and is in effect an arrant calumny and falsehood. 2.
That even the Queree it self seems to imply and grant, that for Subjects to
rise in Arms really for the defense of Religion, against the invasions of the
Powers under the pretense of Lawful Authority, is both lawful and laudable:
Which being the true case and cause of this late Rising, and so clearly
warranted both by the Word and Covenant of God, and the practice of all
Reformed Churches; we are content to refer these poor men's Innocence, unto the
Consciences and secret thoughts of their adversaries.

Secondly, we shall consider these texts of Scripture which were pretended
against the Innocents: and 1. it was much urged that Rebellion is as the sin of
witchcraft; To which one of themselves did roundly and clearly answer, that,
the place having been spoken by the Prophet to a King, because of his
disobedience and contempt of the command of God, and not to Subjects, would
sooner conclude his Accusers then himself to be a Rebel. Secondly, it
answered, that Rising up against Authority it self, the Ordinance of God, and
disobeying the Powers therewith vested, standing and acting in their right line
of Subordination, is indeed Rebellion, and as the sin of witchcraft; but to
resist and rise up against persons Abusing sacred Authority and rebelling
against God the Supreme, is rather to adhere to God as our Liege Lord, and to
vindicate both our selves and his abused Ordinance, from man's wickedness and
Tyranny.

The second text objected was that, Math. 26.52. where even our Lord himself,
when violently seized upon by wicked men, but who were then in Authority; did
nevertheless restrain his disciples from his own defense and rescue, saying
unto Peter, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the
sword, shall perish with the sword; To which, as it was sufficiently answered
(without any reply) by one of these Impeached, (whom they accounted distracted,
though without the least appearance of impertinency) who thereto did oppone
Luke 22.36. Where our Lord, speaking at the same time and to the same purpose,
says, he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one; Yet for
further clearing, we say, 1. That from the place it self in all the
Evangelists, it is most evident, that that command was given, and these words
spoken by our Lord, only for to testify his voluntar submission unto the
Fathers will, by laying down of his life for fulfilling of the Scripture, as is
clear from the same 26. of Matthew. v. 54. and John. 18.11. otherwise the context
being considered (that not only in Luke 22.36. cited, He, forewarning his
disciples of hazards to come, advises them to provide swords and weapons; and
in the 26 of Matt., asserts his power to have called 12 legions of Angels to
his assistance, which clearly implies the lawfulness thereof) this Scripture
objected does more confirm then impugn the Lawfulness of Defensive Arms. 2. Is
it possible that men should be so much demented by flattery, as to think that
it was unlawful for Jesus Christ the Mighty God and Lord over all, to have
defended himself by the assistance of his Disciples, against the horrid
Wickedness and Insurrection of the vilest of His creatures, had it not been,
that it was necessary that the Scriptures concerning him should be
accomplished. 3. Where our Lord says in the place objected, all they that take
the sword, shall perish with the sword, as He thereby only condemns Unjust and
Offensive war; so the Saying it self, by its later part, does tacitly imply
the Lawfulness and Justice of both Defensive and Vindictive Arms, the same
being otherwise justly founded.

Though these Texts were only objected, yet to help our Adversaries, who are
known not to be much conversant in the Scripture, and to obviate the scruples
that may thence arise to others, we subjoyn a third text John. 18.36. where our
Lord says, if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight,
that I should not be delivered to the Jews, whence some infer, that all Arms,
even in Defense of Religion, are unlawful and prohibited; But it is answered,
as the intent and scope of our Lord's answer, was to clear himself of that
calumny objected against Him by the Jews, that he made Himself a King in
opposition to Caesar; so the meaning of it is plain and obvious, to wit, that
our Lord's Kingdom is not of the Nature and for the Ends, for which other
Kingdoms of this world were instituted; but wholly spiritual for declaring the
Truth, and thereby gaining souls unto glory: Whence as our Lord would there
infer that he came not to conquer to himself Disciples by outward force, and
thereby to gain followers by the spoiling of Caesar and other Princes; so it is
without all shadow of connection thence to conclude, that a people having
received the blessing of the Gospel and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, should without
Resistance suffer themselves (to the manifest dishonor of God and the hazard of
the eternal damnation of themselves and their posterity) to be impiously and
sacriledgiously spoiled and deprived thereof, when they are in a capacity to
defend the same. The truth whereof, together with the hypocrisy of our
Adversaries, may soon be discovered, if the Question be but stated in the terms
of one Foreign and independent Prince's invading another, merely upon the
account of the Christian Faith; and whatever solution or evasion they shall
herein make, will as exactly quadrat to the case in hand, it being almost
ridiculous to conceave, that the greatest aggravation of Invasions of this
Kind, to wit, that it is made by a Prince upon his own Subjects (whose
Profession he himself is principally bound to maintain) should import any
speciality and difference in the cases. The last text is that of Math. 5.39.
and remanent verses to the end, where our Lord says, resist not evil, but
whosoever shall smite thee etc. with the other parallel places, specially Rev.
13.10.. But it is answered, that as these places do enjoin either patience,
when the clear call and dispensations of God do inevitably call unto suffering,
without which patience were no patience but rather stupidity; or that bounty
and debonairity which our Lord would have his disciples to practice, in the
remitting and dispensing with the utmost extensions and points of Right, for
the better reproving and condemning of the animosities and rigid contentions of
men, for matters of small or no moment, and the more effectual commending the
grace and peace of the Gospel; So thence to infer that men should give way to
all Violence and Sacrilege (to the subverting of Religion and Righteousness)
is, after the manner of Satan, to cheat and abuse men by the holy Scriptures
of Truth unto wickedness and error; and grossly to exceed that signal rule
mainly in these places intended, to wit, that we should be perfect even as our
Father which is in heaven is perfect, who, though he fills the earth with his
goodness, and extends his bounty unto all, causing the sun to rise upon the
evil and on the good, yet does he love righteousness, and helps and
delivers the oppressed; and commands the zeal of his own glory (wherein He
himself does often eminently appear) by the hand of His people, to take
vengeance on His adversaries. Let us therefore in the consideration of what is
said Rev. 13.10. he that leads into captivity, shall go into captivity; he
that kills with the sword, must be killed with the sword, both possess our
souls in patience under all the former sufferings, and hope and rejoice in the
faith of the succeeding delivery there subjoyned.

These are the Defenses which these Faithful men did summarily hint at, and
being often interrupted, were scarcely permitted to propone: All which being
rejected as unworthy to be heard, what wonder, if what their Advocats did plead
in their defense, upon the point of Quarter given, to some of them in the
field, was also repelled? We are not to dip in matters of this kind; but
certainly it much discovers the spirit of malice and violence that now
prevails, that neither the Nature and Import of Quarter, which pertains
nothing to Grace or Pardon (whereof these men were declared incapable) but is a
paction of the Law of Nations, whereby the person worsted, by quitting of his
arms, (the only and oftentimes the probable means either of his safety or
vengeance) does condition for, and redeem his immunity as to life; Nor yet the
honor of the Granters, Persons Commissionated by the King for the command of
his Forces, with the common Privileges and dignities belonging to such
Offices; Nor yet the Practice of all Nations about, even in the case of
Intestine War; Nor the rational arguments of humanity and prudence, not to
reduce men to utter despair in succeeding Insurrections (from which no Kingdom
is privileged) Nor lastly, the Paucity of these few innocents, not exceeding 5
or 6 who could have been thereby benefited (there being many other taken and
not upon Quarter) could prevail against that Pedantick distinction inter bellum
justum and injustum. But this being alleged to have been bellum injustum, (as
indeed it was in the justest sense) therefore no faith nor Quarter must be
herein observed, quia, sc. adversus Hosts tantum est Bellum, at in Perduelles,
judicium, as if from this, one should conclude, that though in War there may be
faith and Quarter, yet in Judgment there ought neither to be Truth nor
Performance.

All defenses therefore being repelled, these persons accused were all
condemned to be hanged to death as Traitors, and their Heads and right Hands to
be cut off, to be disposed on by the Council, and their Goods and Estates to be
forfaulted to the Kings use. And accordingly upon several days, this Sentence
was executed upon thirty five of these faithful men, and by Ordinance of
Council, the heads of many of them were affixed upon the Ports of several
Burghs; and the right hands of the first ten (to the high contempt of God and
His holy Covenant, and to the provocation of His jealousy) on the Tolbooth of
Lanerk, where the Covenant was by them solemnly renewed and sworn. As for the
other five, they were and are reprived; One of them, who in all his Trial, to
the conviction of all appeared most constant in the Covenant, and bold and
pertinent in his Testimony, upon the color of a fit of distraction (by which
he was once vexed) and through the intercession of many in his behalf; An other
of them, for his vile and abject fainting to the very reproach of humanity,
redeeming his life by becoming Hangman to seven of his fellows, when two
ordinary Executioners in the Burghs about had plainly refused, declaring they
would have nothing to do with the blood of such Righteous men, and one of them
therefore imprisoned; The other three, partly because of their fainting and
condescendence to take the Declaration, and partly through the favor and
intercession of friends.

We shall not, nor cannot enter upon the particular declaration of that Grace,
Constancy and Courage, by which the Lords faithful Witnesses were sustained,
and did bear Testimony to the Word of his Truth, the holy Covenant, and the
Cause and Work of God. Only this is certain, that the Lord did not more desert
that vile abject person to the weakness of flesh and blood, whereby he was
depressed below the very contempt of men, then by His Grace and Glory,
evidently to manifest the power thereof, He was eminently present with such as
He honored to be his Witnesses, to cause them contemn and triumph over
Principalities and Powers, hell and death, and all their terrors; as may be
evident from these things following.

1. That the Council, pitching upon those men without choice, for a Test of
discrimination did require several of them, by taking the Declaration, to
renounce the Covenant; which they constantly refused. And so were Martyred, not
accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.

2. That Mr Hew Mackaile, a young man of 25 years of age, and an Expectant in
the Ministry, being arraigned and accused through mere spite of the
Archbishop of St. Andrews, (against whose Iudas-like Apostasy he had preached
four years ago) for no greater accession, then that he had been some few days
with these that rose, with a sword (having been most uncircumspectly taken,
leaying them because of his infirmity and weakness the day before the Conflict)
did not only most patiently endure cruel Torture whereby he was examined, for
the discovery of the contrivance of that Rising, which all men knew and saw to
be Indeliberat; but, notwithstanding the promise of favor plainly made to him
upon condition of ingenuity (which he sincerely used) being also condemned, did
utterly reject all insinuations made unto him upon condition of the least
Retractation; and bitterly mourning for, and repenting of his apparent fainting
and relinquishing, though; it really proceeded more from his infirmity, then
fear or love of life, but rejoicing in his own folly, whereby the Lord did
bring him to such a manifestation of his Grace, and declaration of His Glory,
he, to the admiration of all, in his most constant and Christian suffering, by
his blood sealed the Truth and glorified God.

3. That others of them, though obscure and illiterate men, upon the Scaffold
hurried and interrupted in the declaring of their Testimony, by the Prelates
Orders, and the rudeness and inhumanity of these that executed them; yet did
bear witness to the cause of God, and of that grace and assurance, whereby the
Lord upheld them, to the admiration and astonishment of all the beholders.

4. That though at Glasgow and Air, where eleven of them were executed, (all
mean Contrymen, and some of them of decrepit age, and others of them very
young, not exceeding 18 years) their enemies caused beat drums about the
Scaffold that they might not be heard (a barbarity never practiced in Scotland,
and rarely heard of, except in the Duke of Alva's Martyring of the Protestants
in the Low-countreyes) yet were they so little thereby amazed, that both by
words of of Praise and thanksgiving to God, that had honored such plough-men
(as they termed themselves) to be His witnesses, and the constancy of their
countenance and whole carriage, they did bear such testimony to the Holy
Covenant, as both many were thereby confirmed, and their Enemies ashamed.

5. That though some of them did appear weak and faint-hearted at first, yet so
powerfully and abundantly was it given to them in that hour, that out of
weakness they were made strong; and declared that they had seen such glimpses
of the Glory of God betwixt the prison and the Scaffold, that all fear was
clearly discussed; And particularly a young Countrey-boy, not much above
sixteen years of age, being condemned at Aix, mostly because he did refuse to
take the Declaration, which they told him, was the renouncing of that Covenant
which he had taken at Lanerk; and though, both through fear and ignorance of
the very grounds of Christianity, he fell into great anxiety, neither daring to
die, nor yet to redeem his life at the rate proposed; Yet after the Prayers and
Conference of some that had access to him at Irwin two days before his death,
on the morning that he suffered, he appeared so much changed, both from the
depth of fear and perplexity unto great resolution and joy, and so much
enlightened with the knowledge of God in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the hope of
Salvation through His Name, that all that saw him, do bear testimony to the
Grace and wonderful Work of God, and of that joy of heart, that carried him to
the Scaffold, leaping and praising God.

From all which particulars, and from the several Testimonies and Speeches,
which these left behind them in writing, we must conclude and rejoice, that God
out of the dark cloud of such a sad and astonishing providence which lately
overspread us, has brought forth so blessed and bright a cloud of Witnesses,
strengthened and filled with so much grace and glory, to bear Testimony unto
His Name, Covenant and Cause and for the confirmation of all that love and wait
for His Salvation.

We have hitherto ommitted, to say any thing to that Oath of Conjuration taken
by the Militia of Edinburgh, and the concurrence and assistance of many others,
who did either Actually rise in Arms for the suppressing of God's People and
Cause, or since the Conflict did stop, apprehend, and spoil them in the cross
way, and have been assisting and abetting to their deaths and persecutions,
either as Guarders of Prisons, Courts or Scaffolds, or as Judges, Clerks,
Advocats, Assizers, or Officers in the Dooms pronounced against them. If, after
all the truth, equity and reason that have been represented, and the Power and
Glory which God has declared, men will not hear and fear, nor be converted,
neither the tongues of men and Angels, nor of such as should return from the
dead, would be of any force or persuasion to prevail with them. Is it possible,
that Edinburgh should think that the pretense of a new invented Oath of
allegiance and fidelity to the King, and for the defense of his Authority
against all Insurrections and Rebellions, wherein the Prelates and the Up hold
of their wickedness, and the Subjecting of all the Godly to their lust and
tyranny, were and are clearly intended and designed, shall warrant them in the
great day of the Lord (who is terrible unto the Kings of the earth) for taking
part with Rebels and Apostats against the God of heaven, and for opposing and
oppressing of such, as, continuing steadfast in the common Cause and Covenant
(for which Edinburgh was once very honorable and eminent) did only endeavor
to liberat themselves from that intolerable Bondage both of Bodies and
Consciences (more grievous then death) under which they groaned? does Edinburgh
thus not only condemn the practice of Our Noble Ancestors and Reformers, who
accounted it neither Insurrection nor Rebellion to set themselves for the
defense of the Gospel against the then Powers, who did endeavor to oppress it;
but by this Oath, abandon both Religion and Liberty, in this so perilous and
backsliding a Generation, to the lust and tyranny of abused Authority, and
whatsoever it shall please to impose, without control or contradiction? Do they
thus remember the National Covenant and the Solemn League and Covenant once so
powerfully sworn and owned amongst them, and the mutual defense and
assistance, wherein every one of us is thereby bound to another, to the
uttermost of our Power, against all sorts of persons whatsoever, and not to
suffer our selves, by whatsoever Combination, Terror or Persuasion; to be
divided and withdrawn from that blessed Union therein contained? While on the
contrary, they conspire and conjure themselves against such whom they are not
only bound to assist, but also to relieve of all the persecutions and
oppressions which they suffer and sustain, only for their adherence to the same
holy Covenants. Surely these things being duly considered, this Oath, in stead
of qualifying the Declaration (in lieu whereof, being more general, plausible
and insnaring it was contrived and imposed) will be found a practical
application of all the Wickedness and unrighteousness, which is therein only
speculatively declared; and may in the righteous judgment of God, by reason
not only of the equality, but even of the excess hereof to London's sin, bring
upon Edinburgh, London's plagues and judgments. We need not here insist to
testify against the rest, who in any sort concurred or assisted in the
opposition and persecution abovementioned, the meanest part of whose
accession, does far exceed Paul's keeping the clothes of such as stoned
Stephen. If we consider that the suffering and not opposing, to the utmost of
our power, the shedding of innocent blood, does involve all under that certain
denounciation made by Jeremiah unto the Princes of Judah; and all the People,
Ier. 26, 15. saying, Know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
surely bring innocent blood upon your selves, and upon this city, and upon the
inhabitant thereof; the most innocent amongst us, will find himself more
concerned to repent of his own, then censure others for their accession. The
serious thoughts whereof, may and ought justly to cause us tremble, left our
Manasseh-like sin in shedding of innocent blood, provoke the Lord to wrath in
such a measure as he will not pardon.

But when we do reflect upon the rage, cruelty and barbarity that have ensued,
the things that we have mentioned, may justly appear to be but the Beginnings
of evils. For first, immediately after the Conflict, the Arch-prelat procures
a proclamation to be emitted Prohibiting the resett and concealment of, or
correspondence with any of these poor men that had escaped, or had been
accessory unto the late Rising, and ordaining all to pursue them as the worst
of Traitors under the pain of being accounted guilty of the same Rebellion. In
which Proclamation, after the Archbishop had impudently and absurdly labored,
that several persons, against whom, not so much as any delation or ground of
suspicion could be alleged, should, contrary to all reason, be insert, he at
length prevailed that about 57 Gentlemen, Ministers and others, alleged more
eminently guilty, should be therein by Name expressed. Certainly if it be
considered, that neither Reason nor Prudence do advise to seek Security only in
Revenge, but rather by an attemperation of Clemency, in cases of this nature,
to bring things to a composure, we must conclude, that such courses are only
the product of blind prelatick-fury. 2. After the first executions at Edinbugh,
the Commissioner and Lieutenant General march unto the West, and there having
condemned and executed several persons, as we have before mentioned, the
Lieutenant General staying behind, takes up his Quarter at Kilmarnock; and
there, and from thence does practice and issue forth such orders of cruelty, as
the barbarity thereof may very probably render the Narration suspected.

For. 1. The Country is burdened with such Localities of Corn and Straw for
Troop-horses, (more then double the number of these that were amongst them)
that to redeem themselves from the drudgery, they not only are content to quite
the prices which the troopers ought to pay, but also to pay in to them such
sums of Money, as upon computation will equalize the valued rent of the Shire.

2. Notwithstanding of all the Excise, Fines and Taxations imposed and leavyed
for the maintenance of these Forces; yet upon pretense of want of moneys and
Pay, the soldiers are shortly thereafter permitted to take free Quarter; and
consequently are licensed to all the abuses, that either rapine or cruelty may
suggest.

3. Dalzel, at and by his own hand, has privately in his own chamber and
Quarters, not only by words menaced such, as after public examination upon the
account of Intelligence, had been acquitted; but also really (by fire and
sword, threatening to kill outright, or roast and burn alive, such who being
groundlessly questioned, had upon the first examination declared all they knew)
examined men by tortures.

4. Such persons as he happens to apprehend, whether upon the suspicion of
their having been with these that rose in Arms, or having reset such after the
Conflict, are there-upon ordinarily stripped naked to their shirts and breeches;
and thrust into Prisons, in cold, hunger. nakedness, and sometimes in extreme
straitness; As in Kilmarnock into dark and obscure little holes, which being
destined for one man or two, and not capacious of more (though standing
upright) then ten or twelve, they are so pinched, that not one of them can
possibly so much as relieve himself of the continual pain of standing, by
suffering his body to sink unto the ground; and unto all the former miseries
have that of their own dung and excrements superadded: so that the poor men
would often choose death rather then life. Amongst which cruelties and rigors,
that practiced upon a petty Heritor in or about the Parish of Vchilery,
deserves to be remembered: Who, being apprehended upon a groundless suspicion
of reset of Traitors (as they term them) was brought to Kilmarnock-Tolbooth;
where, being an old man full of obstructions, he was so suffocated with the
smoke, there occasioned by a coal-fire, wanting a chimney-vent, that
oftentimes a day the soldiers have in derision carried him out as dead, and
after a little recovery by reason of the free Air, with cruel scorn
ignominiously returned him unto his prison. Which Barbarity they still
continued, until by extremity of such usage, he is reduced to such weakness as
there is little hope of life.

5. There is one Act, so far beyond, and without all show and pretense of
Humanity and Justice, as scarce any preface or Testimony is sufficient to
persuade the belief of it; which is thus. Dalzel having ordered a party to
Newmills to seize and apprehend one Finlaw, living peacably in his own house,
and they about the time of Dalzel's return from Air, returning and bringng with
them the prisoner, he instantly calls him to his chamber, and examineth him
privately (without so much as any one witness present) whether or not he was
with the Rebels at Lanerk; the man in answer declares, that he was there when
they came to the place, but upon the account of his own private affairs. The
General asks in the nixt place, whom he knew to have been there amongst them,
and because the man (by declaring his ignorance) appeared unwilling to discover
any, he instantly calls the Lieutenant of the Guard, and gives orders to
carry the poor man to the Gallows and there to shoot him dead. The man being
thus hurryed away, when he is brought to the place of execution, questioneth
the Lieutenant, if the General was serious in what he had ordered: whereunto
the Lieutenant replyeth that he knew nothing to the contrary; the poor man
declaring his innocence, obtesteth him* both upon the grounds of Humanity and
Christianity, that he would at least obtain him a reprival for that night, that
he might prepare for Death and Eternity, and with some importunity prevails
to move him to return to Dalzel for a grant of the license desired: but the
Lieut. General, in place of relenting, does most severely threaten the
Lieutenant himself, telling him that he would teach him to obey his orders
precisely without pleading for mitigation; whereupon the Lieutenant returning
to the place, immediately orders the poor man to be shot, who was instantly
stripped naked and left dead upon the ground. A fact so Barbarous and Cruel, and
in effect so plain a Murder, being destitute of the least shadow of either
Ordinary or Martial Law to color it, that the horror thereof may justly render
it incredible.

6. As this last Act is such as barbarity it self would condemn, so its well
known that this man Dalzel was therefore brought from Musco, where it was
supposed he had learned to comply with that Arbitrary Tyranny, and to exercise
that Barbarous Cruelty, which there more then in any part of the Christan
World, is wickedly practiced, as the only proper Executioner, agreeably and
accurately to serve the rigor and violence of this, accursed Prelacy. Which
expectation he has not at all frustrated: For both he and the Arch-Prelate of
St Andrews, are so wickedly acted by the same spirit of spite, rage and
wickedness, that they have often grieved and openly complained, that such whom
they have supposed, and would have instantly and utterly destroyed as criminals
(according to the excess of their own lust and malice, without respect to any
measure or proportion of Justice) should either be proceeded against, or
punished acording to the tenor of Law; accounting and impudently declaring,
that these Formalities (as they are pleased to term the very substantials of
Law, and the great security of all men's lives and fortunes) were, and are in
their opinions mostly obstructive to the King's service. It were endless to
enumerat all the evils, extortions, cruelties and exactions that this
Muscovia-beast has acted and does practice upon that poor country of the
West, where retaining some of his forces, both Horse and Foot, the most slender
suspicions, or the smallest surmises, though never so false, are accounted
crimes and convictions; and immediately punished with such rigorous imprisonment
as we have already described; or by oppressive Quartering, not only on the
person suspected, but also on the whole bounds about: in which Quartering, the
soldiers do behave themselves with such insolency and rapine, that not only
many hundreds of families are reduced to beggary, but in several Parishes, the
country almost laid waste and desolate; So that now it is the common report
and persuasion of all, that the West is appointed for ruin and destruction.

7. Seeing this is the case of almost that whole Country, without respect to
guilt or innocence, how hard and lamentable is the condition of such who were
in the late Rising, and have hithertil escaped? it is impossible fully to
represent all their sore distress and great perplexity which they sustain,
wandering and hiding themselves in woods, mountains and caves of the earth,
afflicted with all the pain and misery, that the extremity of cold, nakedness
and hunger, with the continual uncertainty of their Lives, can lay upon them,
and hunted more then Partridges, by the vigilant and cruel malice of their
adversaries. We know that some of our profane Apostate Preachers (who not only
think the fiery trial a strange thing, and are offended at the cross of
Christ, but preferring this worlds ease to their everlasting rest, do neither
hearken to the warning, nor believe the promised and often experienced
consolation of suffering) have wickedly judged these poor men and their cause
by the event, and affirmed that curse sa. 8.21. to be on them accomplished: but
as both the sin of Sorcery and the sting of this threatening, imbittered
fretting to the cursing of God, the very worm of the damned here recorded, do
clearly discover and confute this calumny; so are these Apostate calumniators
plainly and directly therein concerned, who, having such evident tokens of
perdition, as are their vile Apostasy and cruel persecution and reproach, may
and ought to tremble in the pre-apprehensions thereof, which, without serious
repentance, they cannot escape, when the righteous God who upholdeth his own
with strength and joy in tribulation, shall hereafter give unto all of them,
though now troubled, rest with all saints.

But not only time, but heart and tongue would fail any Christian, to relate
all the violences, plunderings, extortions and insolences, that from the
beginning of this Apostasy until this day have been and are committed by
Military Force among us, first upon Galloway, then upon both Galloway and
Nithisdale, and now upon the whole West: which as they have been Extended in
bounds, so are they continually Intended in cruelty. Only this we shall say, if
stobbing, wounding, beating, stripping and imprisoning men's persons, violent
breaking of their houses both by day and night, and beating and wounding of
wives and children, ravishing and deflowring of women, forcing wives and other
persons by fired matches and other tortures to discover their husbands and
nearst relations, although it be not within the compass of their knowledge, and
driving and spoiling all their goods that can be carried away, without respect
to guilt or innocence, in as cruel a manner as ever Scotland saw exerced
amongst them by a foreign enemy (as can be instanced from every corner of that
Country) May represent our present slavery and bondage; certainly the same is
so much the more miserable and insupportable, in that all this wickedness is
most unnaturally perpetrated, both by our own Contrymen and Sworn brethren,
and so much the rather to be laid to heart by all, that, as al these things are
only acted and allowed by the wicked malice and blind fury of this prevailing
Prelatick party, and for satisfying their insatiable hatred and revenge against
all their opposers, so is the whole Kingdom thereby disabled, and most
obviously in these most dangerous times, exposed to the Invasion, of any
Forrainer; As may be very evident from these considerations. 1. The West, the
strength and better part of the Kingdom, is already disabled, not only by the
abovementioned oppressions, but by general disarming, and taking of
serviceable horses, and likely very shortly to be totally wasted and ruined. 2.
The North and High-Lands have been of late so much neglected and connived at,
through the prevailing wickedness of the times, that they are wholly in
disorder, and all places about infested by most insolent rapines and murders:
but since the Actors are void both of Religion and Conscience, they cannot now
be guilty of either Rebellion or Sedition, and since they are rather favorers
of then enemies to Prelates, it is no matter how great enemies they be to
Righteousness. 3. The whole Kingdom is so exhausted by exactions and
impositions, so vexed by general oppression and disorder, from which the
wickedness of Prelatick Rulers, suffer no place to be exempted; and so
disgusted with the violence and inhumanity they see done to their brethren
(their own flesh) for such slight and unworthy causes and occasions, as the
worst of men not interested, do justly apprehend Prelacy and Conformity to be;
that all are either disabled, disheartened, or disobleiged from the service of
King and Country. 4. There remains no strength nor force amongst us, but
these two regiments of foot and nine troops of horses, which even with the
addition of the five more intended, will not in all exceed 2000 foot and 1000
horse, and yet are they all and more then the Country can well bear, and these
so debauched by licentiousness, cruelty and rapine, that neither can their
hearts endure, nor their hands be strong against an enemy. These are the fruits
of our departing from the Lord, and again erecting and admitting this accursed
Prelacy. O! that God would cause us to know how evil and bitter they are; but
the Prelates who fear not God, regard not the Commonwealth, let the Covenant and
Conscience be rooted out, then come on us what will: these are the only enemies
of their usurpations and wicked lusts, and therefore must be accounted so both
to King and Country; against these are our forces leavyed and maintained, and
unto this design their numbers must be modelled and our exactions proportioned:
The arraying of the Country and establishing of the Militia conform to our
ancient Laws and Liberties may possibly arm the Prelates enemies; surely that
course would not so violently press Conformity, and execute their cruelty, nor
so largely gratify a few Nobles, who by the command of the troops must be made
sharers of the spoil and booty, and so engaged for these vile Prelates against
the poor Country. O blinded Nobles! are not the wealth and peace of the
Country your riches and stability? O abject Scotland! how art thou abondoned?

This being the design, rage and jealousy of the tyrannizing Prelates, in order
thereunto there must be five troops more added to these already leavyed, and
the Country yet more oppressed for the securing and establishing of their
wickedness. 2, They are endeavoring by all means to have the Declaration
against the Covenant generally pressed, that either by violent straining they
may destroy all conscience thereof, or may more fully discover, and more
effectually reach all the faithful in the Land, whom by the test of a refusal
they purpose to stage and severely punish as enemies to Authority. We shall not
offer here to add any thing against this Declaration. If all that the Lord
has done in this Land now by the space of near an 100 years, all that his
servants have formerly declared and testified, and now of late have witnessed
and sealed with th^^r blood, and all the tenor and purpose of this discourse
avail not to justify our holy Covenants, and condemn this horrid Apostasy and
wicked Declaration, nothing certainly will be able to persuade, and the mighty
power of God can only convert. Only we have reason to fear that the same spirit
of deceat, which, under the color of due obedience to lawful Authority,
ensnared wretched Edinburgh to a combination and conspiracy against the Lord
and his Anointed, may renew the same practice upon the whole Land, for the more
easy involving of such in this Apostasy, whom possibly the gross and palpable
wickedness of the Declaration might deter: And to such we give this warning,
that as all Powers are subordinat to the most High, and appointed and limited
by His holy will and commandment, for his own glory and the Peoples good; and
as our Alleagiance was, and stands perpetually and expressly thus qualifyed,
viz. in defense of Religion and Liberty, according to our first and second
Covenants; and lastly, seeing all Alleagiance and obedience to any created Power
whatsoever, (though in the construction of charity apparently indefinite, yet)
of it is own nature is indispensibly thus restricted; To renew the same, or take
any the like Oath of Alleagiance purely and simply, purposely omitting the
former and due Restriction, especially where the Powers are in most manifest
and notorious Rebellion against the Lord, and opposition to his Cause and
Covenant, is in effect equivalent to to an express rejecting and dis-owning of
the same Limitation, and of the Sovereign Prerogative of the Great God and King
over all, which is thereby reserved; and as much as in plain terms to affirm,
that whatever abused Authority shall command or do, either as to the
overturning of the Work of God, subverting of Religion, destroying of Rights
and Liberties, or persecuting of all the Faithful to the utmost extremity, we
shall not only stupidly endure it, but actively concur with and assist in all
this Tyranny. And if this be not more, yea double wickdness above all that the
Declaration does import, let all men consider. O! all ye who desire to behold
the good that God will do for His People, beware of this High Rebellion against
Him.

3. As all restraints of either Conscience or Law are now wickedly taken off,
and only a convenient oppurtunity waited for, to re-introduce that dead carcass
of Formality, the Service Book, and the whole bulk of these corrupt Ceremonies
and pernicious Superstitions, that have been formerly, and always found so
destructive to the light and power of the Gospel, and are so vain and
ridiculous in themselves, that nothing but the very, spirit of darkness and
judicial delusion from the Lord, can induce men to such fopperies; so may we
certainly expect the re-imposing of this heavy yoke, and all the Sin,
Superstition, Persecution and Wrath which necessarily do attend it, except we
abide steadfast in the Lord's Cause and Covenant, instantly entreating and
patiently waiting for His Salvation, and glorious appearance again in this Land.

Thus we have represented in part both the Sin, Sufferings and Distresses that
ly upon the whole Land; which though they be most heavy and grievous in
themselves, yet are they in their Tendency and Presage more to be regarded. Can
any man seriously look upon the hatred and scorn of that Light and Truth?
wherein once we gloried, the spite against the Holy Covenant and all
Conscience, the Blaphemy and sin against God, and the violence and persecution
against all such as fear His Name, whereby the enemy rages and their tumult
continually increases, and not be astonished? Is there any who believes that
God is, and that His Words are Truths and all His Ways judgments, His
Threatenings sure and certain, His jealousy as a consuming fire, His wrath so
dreadful and His indignation so terrible, that only the same Omnipotency which
inflicteth the strokes, can sustain poor passive wretches from evanishing at
it is smallest rebukes, and yet shall sustain them eternally, and not tremble
because of the provocation of all these Abominations? O! that such whom the
Love of Christ has not constrained, nor the tears and weeping of a departing
Savior moved, might be yet persuaded by the Terror of the Lord, and that the
dread of God might make their hearts soft. Surely abounding sin is the greatest
Woe, and prevailing transgression the greatest cause of mourning; but above all
sins and transgressions, Christ despised in His Gospel and Ordinances, and
persecuted in His members, is the most mournful and fearful: Which as it
scattered and destroyed the Lord's peculiar People and Nation, dear to Him
above all Nations, and has overturned and ruined the fairest part of the
Christian World, either in Barbarity or gross Darkness; so is it the great
condemnation of the whole World. This is the work and wickedness of accursed
Prelacy, most Perjurious in it is Rise and ever Antichristian in it is Designs
and Effects, as all who have hearts to understand what we have here declared,
and eyes to see the present state and condition of matters, must and will
acknowledge. This is thy Sin, O Scotland, and, if mercy prevent it not, shall
be thy ruin. This is the Voice, Testimony and Warning of all the sufferings of
the Lord's people; who though continually afflicted and persecuted in their
bodies, and though their souls be exceedingly filled with the contempt of the
proud; yet have not nor dare not deny the Lord, His Work, nor His holy
Covenant: whom though the Lord has caused to turn back from the enemy, and
given for a spoil to them that hate them, yea given them as sheep for meat, and
made them a reproach, a scorn and a derision; yet have they nor forgotten the
Lord nor dealt falsely in His Covenant. O! that men would! consider this Grace
of God, whereby as he conforteth and sustaineth his servants in all their
afflictions; so he warns backsliders to return, and all to flee from the
wrath that is to come, and to save themselves from this wicked generation:
Which Grace, as it allayeth to, the Faithful the smart, so ought it to remove
from all the scandal of our Lord's cross, and is indeed that strength and
presence of the Captain of our salvation (who was made perfect by suffering)
with all His sufferers, giving for the present joy and peace, and afterward
assured victory.

Now, seeing it is the Lord who has so visibly brought upon us these sore
Trialls, that such as are approved may be made manifest, and so graciously
delivers them from the temptation thereof, yea thereby refineth, purifyeth
and makes many white, that they may be more abundant Partakers both of His
Holiness and of His Glory, and also eminently bears witness to the Truth,
Grace and Power of His great Work, His holy Covenant, and precious Ordinances
and Ministry amongst us, clearing them by His own Testimony of all these
calumnies, wherewith either through the invention of some men's malice, or the
occasion of other men's weakness and sin, they were formerly aspersed, we shall
shut up this discourse with this one word of exhortation.

Great has been the Sin of this Land in not believing and obeying the glorious
Gospel, in not receaving the Lord Jesus in our hearts, and witnessing His
Light and Grace and Glory in our lives and conversations, but in resting on the
outward forms and appearances of the true Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, without laboring after the power of Reformation, and beauty of
holiness (the only grace and blessing of all these enjoyments) and in
perverting and mannaging the possession and profession of all these things unto
selfish ends and worldly advantages, O foolish people and unwise, have we thus
requited the Lord for all these mercies of His Gospel, pure Ordinances and
Holy Covenants, to corrupt and deprave them from that great end of the Glory of
His grace and mercy in our salvation, unto the base designs of serving and
satifying our own lusts to His dishonor? And therefore is it that the Lord,
having often in his mercy corrected and warned us, has now at length given us
over unto this horrid Apostasy and Defection; whereby, as the latent malice and
hypocrisy of many, and the great fainting and want of zeal in all, have been
manifestly discovered; so the Lord is feeding the wicked with their own
delusions, and putting the zeal and constancy of all to the Test, and in effect
ripening this whole Land, either for a glorious deliverance from that perverse
spirit and generation of Antichrist, that has been long mingled in the midst
of us, and even from the days of our first Reformation, has retained and
continued the old enmity against the Lord Jesus and His blessed Gospel and
Kingdom; or else for a total and final overthrow in utter darkness and
desolation. And therefore O Scotland, because the Lord loved thy Fathers, and
delights not in thy destruction, has He, after all our fearful backsliding
and sinful fainting and departing which testify against us, neither left
Himself nor us without a witness; but raised up amongst us His own faithful
Servants and our brethren, with whom we are all equally and indissolubly
engaged in the same righteous Cause and Covenant, and by the mighty power of
His grace, from the pure zeal of His Glory, enabled them first to venture and
then to lay down their lives for the Testimony of His Work and Covenant, that
we may yet at length consider and understand, that these were no more the
labor and devices of carnal designs, then that corruption and weakness of
flesh and blood could triumph both over it self and death and hell the chief of
terrors. O! that men would therefore lay to heart their bonds and Engagements
unto the Lord, repent of their backslidings, and cease from their opposition to
His Cause and Covenant; at least that such whom the Lord has not abandoned
unto that depth of Apostasy, whereunto others have made defection, would yet be
wise and instructed, repent of their fainting and Neutrality in the cause of
God, and their connivance or compliance with the declared enemies thereof, and
beware of that wicked Declaration against the Covenant, or any other Oath and
Subscription likely to be the snare and temptation of these times, which either
under the pretext of Peace and Order, or of due Obedience unto lawful Authority
may be wickedly invented and imposed, really for the suppressing of Truth, and
advancing of this Rebellion against the most High God, and the establishing of
this Antichristian Prelatick- Tyranny. We have already fully detected the mask
and design of such impostures; He who has given Authority and Power unto Kings
and Princes, and rendered the same Sacred by His holy Sanction and Command, as
he has often punished their Ingratitude and Usurpation against His own
Soveraignity; so will He not hold that people guiltless, who, being both His
Creatures and sworn Subjects, either connive at, or comply with such Rebellious
Princes in their wickedness. Shall both the Law of God, and the very Propension
of the heart and blood to the love and obedience of Parents, cede to the
obedience of Kings and Rulers, for the good and preservation of the
Commonwealth, and shall not far more all Alleagiance and obedience to the same
Kings and Rulers, cede and give place to our Obedience to the Most High our
only Sovereign Lord, and the conscience of His holy Oath and Commandments, for
advancement of his glory, the great and only end of all things? Fix it
therefore in your hearts, first to love and fear the Lord our God, and then to
honor and obey the King; and let the sincere and inward love of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the dear esteem of his precious Gospel, and the remembrance of our most
sacred and solemn Oaths and Covenants, and of that beauty, power and glory of
His pure Ordinances, Ministry and Government which we once enjoyed, always
dwell in your hearts, and ever determine and establish you to resist and disown
all wicked Usurpations against the Lord and His Anointed, all Invasions against
His Crown and Prerogative, all Corruptions and Humane Inventions in His pure
Worship and Ordinances, all perversion of the true Government and comely Order
in His house, and al^ violations of these indispensible and holy Engagements,
whereby this whole Nation is perpetually joined unto the Lord; and also ever
animat you to Do or Suffer for the Lords great Name and these precious and
important concernments, as He requires; lest if ye either faint in your
minds, or give up your selves to the delusion of some carnal distinction,
quiting the founder for the safer part, against the explicit Testimony, or
implicit inclination of your own Consciences (which later, if sincerely aiming
at the glory of God, and in nothing repugnant to His holy Word, is no otherwise
to be regarded in times of temptation, then as that promised secret leading of
the blind in the way they know not) you not only lose your Crown, but provoke
the Lord to cause all the Churches know by your plagues, that He it is who
searches the reins and hearts.

But unto these few names in Scotland that have appeared zealous for God, and
have not forgotten His Covenant in these declining times, and all these who
favor their Righteous Cause; The Lord (who lives and was dead, and is alive
for evermore, Amen,) knows your works, tribulation and poverty (but you are
rich) and also the blasphemy of them which say they are Christians and are not,
but are the synagogue of Antichrist, Fear none of these things which you do or
shall suffer, your afflictions are but for Trial, and may be Short: be
Faithful unto the death and ye shall have the Crown of life. And as ye love God
and the Father of our Lord Jesus, who gave His only and eternal delight unto
the death for us Sinners; as ye love our Lord Jesus Christ who loved us and
washed us from our sins in His own blood; as ye love the Holy Spirit of Grace
who breaths all this love into our hearts, and comfort and seals us unto
the day of redemption; as ye love the blessed Gospel, in the light whereof all
this love is revealed, and God therein mainly glorified; as ye love the Church
of God, which he has purchased with his own blood; as ye love (for your own
souls and for your posterity) eternal life; as ye love poor Scotland and it is
deliverance from the dreadful and imminent wrath of God; and as you love the
preservation of all Interests either Spiritual, Temporal or Eternal, Adhere
steadfastly to the holy Covenants that Sacred and Firm Bond and Engagement unto
all duties of Religion and Righteousness, our blessed sealed Charter of all the
Lord's blessings and ordinances, especially of that great Ordinance of the
Ministry and Government of the Lord's house, which He himself has appointed
the hedge of all other Ordinances, and the great and most effectual mean of the
Gospel's establishment and advancement. For, as it is only the holy zeal of God
inspired and animated by the fervent love of our Lord Jesus, and the fear of
the Lord's great Name, and the regard of His sacred Oath, that can make you of
quick understanding in these perilous times, for the discovering of both
duties and dangers, and strengthen you with all might, either for Doing or
Suffering, that you may endure unto the end; so you may be assured, that if the
Lord's thoughts toward Scotland be thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give
us an expected end (as we have great ground and persuasion of hope) it shall be
upon the broken plank of this despised Covenant, that this tossed and
ship-wrackt Church shall be preserved, in midst of all these fluctuations, and
at length attain to it is desired haven of Peace and Truth. Yea though this
Apostasy and persecution should prevail to wear out the saints of the most
High, and the Lord (because of the overspreading of abomination) should
determine and bring upon us utter desolation; yet shall this your faithfulness
be your Peace, joy and Victory. Let all therefore that desire to be found
faithful, look unto Jesus and his joy; that with Him enduring the cross and
despising the shame, we may neither faint nor be weary, but in end be partakers
of his Victory, Throne and Crown.

Thus we have seen and declared the great Work of God in this Land, from the
first times of our Reformation unto this day; we have also teen our manifold
provocations, whereby we have often Turned, Tempted and Provoked the most High;
and all these judgments, Temptations and Discoveries, wherewith, by the space
of now more then an Hundred years, he has corrected and exercised us; and we
are at length arrived unto, and have considered the present state and posture
of our affairs: Wherein though 1. the extremity of Apostasy, exceeding all that
any age can parallel, and aggreageable by all the circumstances of most clear
and glorious Manifestations, most solemn and sacred Engagements, most sudden
and causeless backsliding, and most national daring and violent defection that
any Church can be charged with. 2. The extremity of Persecution and Violence,
which, considering either the Actors; (once ringleaders, now Apostats from the
same Holy Covenant which they persecut) or the Manner, by Hostile and Military
Force, without so much as regarding their own Laws which they pretend for
warrant; or the cruelty and excess, whereby men's lives are imbittered, making
them prefer Death to the slaveries and insolences which they, sustain, Are not
to be instanced in any Christian Church. 3. The extremity of Sin and profanity,
and of the enemies boasting and blasphemy, whose mouths are set against the
Heavens, and all the spite of their tongues and indignation of their hearts,
against the holy Covenant and tenderness of conscience, over which and all
their followers, they wickedly insult and rejoice. And 4. the extremity of men's
fainting and deserting so Good a Cause; Which in their hearts they secretly own
and approve, but dare not avow, yea are ready to deny for fear of the
Adversaries, Though, we say, these extremities (undenyably apparent in our
present condition) do sadly denounce unto this Land, the worst and most woeful
of all extremities, even utter forsaking and desolation, and that the End is
come; yet notwithstanding all these hopeless and desperate appearances, it is
the Lord who causes light to shine out of darkness, and says in the evening
it shall be light, who says unto dry bones, live, and calls his People out
of their graves, who even calls things that are not as though they were, in
whom all the seekers of His face ought to rejoice, and joy in the God of their
salvation. Therefore, although that over and above all these menacing evils,
the power and pride of the Enemy should yet more prevail, even many degrees
above all the appearances of Human Hope or Help, and all Neighboring Nations
should not only give them the leisure and convenience, but with all their might
conspire and concur with our enemies, to intend their persecution and
strengthen their Apostasy; yet are the Lord's Faithful, not only partakers of
that River, the streams whereof make glad the City of God, though surrounded
with the siege of of Nations, Batteries of mountains, and insurrections of the
Universe against it, and are built on that rock against which the very gates of
hell cannot prevail, and do also know that their God whom they fear is able to
deliver them from this fiery Trial, and He will deliver them from their
persecuters; and if not, that nothing save the design of greater glory to this
own Name, in a greater mercy and salvation to His People shall impede it: but
all that love the Lord's Salvation have also fair ground of hope, that the
Lord, as he will pour out His wrath upon his adversaries, so will He remember
for Scotland his Covenant; awake and give a shout against His enemies; and
that, now when He sees their wrath, how they behave themselves strangely, and
say our hand is high, and the Lord has not done all this, the Lord will bring
forth for His remnant (even that holy seed which shall be the substance of this
Land) that Deliverance which is laid up in store with Him, and sealed up
amongst His treasures. For unto God belongs vengeance and recompense, even
the vengeance of His broken Covenant, of His dear Saints blood, and of His
polluted Sanctuary. The adversaries foot shall slide in due time, for the day of
their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them, make
haste. For the Lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants,
when he sees that our power is gone, and there is none shut up or left: And
the Lord shall say, see now that I, even I am He, and there is no God with me:
I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can
deliver out of my hand; for I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for
ever. if I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I
will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I
will make mine arrows drunk with blood (and my sword shall devour flesh) and
that with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the beginning of
revenges upon the enemy. Rejoice, O ye Nations, with his people, for He will
avenge the blood of His Servants, and will render vengeance to His adversaries,
and will be merciful unto His Land and to His People. This is the Song which
God has taught us, and therewith we shut up and seal the FAITH AND PATIENCE OF
THE SAINTS.

AND now, having finished the Narration intended of the Work of God, and having
seen and being persuaded that all the degrees and Passages of its Progress and
Advancement, were the very vestiges of the Lords ascendent Power and Glory,
which He has also sealed by the Salvation of many thousands for our assured
confirmation, that as this Work is of God, so shall it not come to naught; But
that these Antichristian (...) who oppose it, though in the same Spirit and
Power of Darkness, which has mainly caused and procured all the sin,
temptation and ruin that has befallen any Gospel Church, (...) the blessed
coming of our Lord JESUS in the fle^h, they should arise unto, yea surmount the
very height of the Papacy and Antichrist himself, in their Persecutions and
Tyranny; They shall nevertheless in the end, be found even to fight against
God, and perish for ever in their gainsaying. As we do therefore desire to
remain steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the Work of the Lord, and
every point and circumstance thereof, without fainting or wearying even unto
the Death. in and over which the Lord has caused His faithful witnesses so
gloriously to Triumph; so we do only here subjoyn, for the clear and
unanswerable conviction and condemnation of the perfidy and wickedness of these
accursed Prelates, both before the World and even in their own consciences, if
any sense thereof do yet remain: That though we had never seen any of these
great and glorious things, whereby the Lord since the Year 1637. did revive,
confirm and magnify His Work amongst us, and that the National Covenant had net
been since retaken much less explained and established, nor the League and
Covenant ensued it; Yet since the same does still stand in the plain and simple
terms, wherein it was conceaved, and in that sense and meaning, wherein both
it is express Words and all the circumstances which we have before observed do
plainly evince that it was at first taken; as this Covenant does remain unto
this Day (notwithstanding all the Prelates wickedness, perjury and violence)
unrepeal'd or condemned, and by no contrary explanation or gloss, either is or
can be detorted, from being an undeniable abjuration of accursed Prelacy and
all it is corruptions; so is it a certain, fixed and immovable foundation for
all the Work of God that has ensued, and a very sure ground of confidence to
all who seriously perpend, and firmly adhere to it, that the Lord who loved us
of old, and chosed our Fathers, shall yet again by his mighty Spirit and Power,
turn the hearts of the Children unto the Fathers, and bring us back unto the
Lord God of our Fathers, and upon this same Foundation, yet repair our
breaches, build up the old wastes, and raise and rear up His Glory.

FINIS.
The last SPEECHES AND TESTIMONIES Of some who have Suffered for the TRUTH IN
SCOTLAND, Since the Year 1660.
The last Speech of the MARQUIS of ARGILE, At his Death in Edinburgh, May 27.
1661.
MANY will expect that I speak many things, and according to their several
opinions and dispositions, so will their expectations be from me, and
constructions of me; But I resolve to disappoint many, for I come not hither to
justify my self, but the Lord, Who is Holy in all His ways and Righteous in
all His Works, Holy and blessed is His Name; Neither come I to condemn others:
I know many. will expect that I will speak against the hardness of the
Sentence, pronounced against me; But I will say nothing to it. I bless the
Lord, I pardon all men, as I desire to be pardoned of the Lord my self: Let the
will of the Lord be done; That is all that I desire.

I hope that ye will have more charity to me now, then ye would have had at an
other time, seeing I speak before the Lord, to whom I must give an account very
shortly. I know very well that my words have had but very little weight with
many: And that many have mistaken my Words and Actings both: Many have thought
me to be a great Enemy to these great works, that have of late, been brought to
pass. But do not mistake me, good People: I speak it in the presence of the
Lord, I entered not upon the Work of Reformation, with any design of advantage
to my self, or prejudice to the King and his Government; As my later Will which
was written 1655. and thereafter delivered to a Friend (in whose hands it still
remains) can show. As for these Calumnies that have gone abroad of me, I
bless God, I know them to be no more: And as I go to make a reckoning to My
God, I am free as to any of these, concerning the King's Person or Government.
I was Real and Cordial in my desires to bring the King home, and in my
Endeavors for Him when he was at home, and I had no correspondence with the
Adversaries Army, nor any of them, in the time when his Majesty was in
Scotland; Nor had I any accession to his late Majesty's horrid and execrable
Murder, by Council or Knowledge of it, or any other manner of way. This is a
Truth, as I shall answer to my Judge. And all the time his Majesty was in
Scotland, I was still endeavoring His advantage; my Conscience bears me
witness in it. So much to that Particular. And ( turning about he said) I hope,
Gentlemen, you will all remember these.

I confess, many look on my Condition as a Suffering condition: But I bless the
Lord, that He that has gone before me, has trod the Wine Press of the
Father's wrath; by whose Sufferings, I hope that my Sufferings shall not be
Eternal. I bless Him that has taken away the sting of my Sufferings: I may say
that my Charter was Sealed to day; for the Lord has said to me, SON, BE OF
GOOD CHEER, THY SINS ARE FREELY FORGIVEN THEE: And so I hope my Sufferings
shall be very easy. And ye know the Scripture says, the Captain of our
Salvation was made perfect by Sufferings.

I shall not speak much to these things for which I am condemned, lest I seem
to condemn others: It Is well known, it is only for Compliance, which was the
Epidemicall fault of the Nation. I wish the Lord to Pardon them: I say no more.

There was an expression in these Papers presented by me to the Parliament, of
the Contagion of these times; Which may by some be misconstructed, as if I
intended to lay an Imputation upon the Work of Reformation: But I declare that
I intended no such thing; But only related to the corruptions and failings of
men, occasioned by the Prevailing of the Usurping Powers. At this he turned and
took them all witnesses.

Now, Gentlemen, concerning the Nation, I think there are three sorts of People
that take up much of the World and of this Nation. There is 1. the openly
Profane: And truly I may say, though I have been a prisoner, I have not had
mine ears shut; I hear assuredly, that Drinking, Swearing, Whoring were never
more Common, never more Countenanced then now they are. Truly if Magistrates
were here, I would say to them, if they lay forth their power for glorifying of
God, by restraining this, they should fare the better; if they continue in not
restraining, they shall fare the worse. I say no more, but either let People
shun Prophanity and Magistrates restrain it, or assuredly the wrath of God shall
follow on it. 2. Others are not openly Profane (everyone will not allow that)
but yet they are Gallio's in the matter: If matters go well as to their Private
Interest, they care not whether the Church of God sink or swim. But whatever
they think, God has laid Engagements upon Scotland: We are tied by Covenants
to Religion and Reformation: These that were then Unborn are yet engaged; and
in our Baptism we are engaged to it. And it passes the power of all the
Magistrates under heaven to absolve them from the Oath or God: They deceave
themselves, and it may be would deceave others that think otherwise. But I
would caveat this, People will be ready to think this a kind of instigation to
Rebellion in me; But they are very far wrong that think Religion and Loyalty
are not well consistent. Whoever they be that separate them, Religion is not to
be blamed, but They. It Is true, it is the duty of every Christian to be Loyal;
yet I think the Orders of things are to be observed as well as their Natures;
the Order of Religion as well as the Nature of it. Religion must not be the
Cock-boat, it must be the Ship. God must have what is His, as well as Caesar
what is His: And These are the best Subjects that are the best Christians. And
that I am looked on as a Friend to Reformation, is my Glory.

3. There is another sort that are truly Godly: And to them I must say what I
fear, and every one has reason to fear (it is good to fear evil) It Is true the
Lord may prevent it; but if He do not (and truly I cannot forsee any
probability of it) Times are like either to be very Sinning or very Suffering
Times: And let Christians make their choice: There is a sad Dilemma in the
business SIN or SUFFER; and surely, he that would choice the Better part will
choice to Suffer. Others that will choice to Sin, shall not escape Suffering;
They shall Suffer, but it may be, not as I do ( turning about and, pointing to
the Maiden) but worse: Mine is but Temporal, theirs shall be Eternal; when I
shall be Singing, they shall be Howling. Beware therefore of Sin whatever you
are aware of, especially in such times.

Yet I cannot say of my own Condition, but that the Lord in his Providence has
mind of Mercy to me even in this World: For if I had been more favorably dealt
with, I fear I might have been overcome with Temptations, as many others are,
and many more I fear will be; And so should have gone out of the World, with a
more polluted Conscience, then through the mercy of God now I have. And hence
my Condition is such now, as when I am gone, will be seen not to have been such
as many imagined. It Is fit God take me away, before I fall into these
Temptations that I see others are falling into* and many others I fear will
fall: I wish the Lord may Prevent it. Yet blessed be His Name, that I am kept
both from present evils and evils to come. Here he turned about a little and
spoke some words to Mr Hutchison, when turning again to the People, he spoke as
follows. Some may expect I will regrete my own condition: but truly I neither
grudge nor repine; nor desire any revenge. And I declare I do not repent my
last going up to London; for I had always rather have Suffered any thing, then
ly under Reproaches as I did. I desire not that the Lord should judge any man;
nor do I judge any but my Self: I wish, as the Lord has pardoned me, so He may
pardon them for this and other things; and what they have done to me, may never
meet them in their accounts. I have no more to say, but to beg the Lord, that
when I go away, he would Bless every one that stays behind.

His last Words, immediately before he laid his Head on the Block after his
doublet was off, were these. I desire you, Gentlemen, all that hear me this day
to take notice (and I wish that all who see me might hear me) that now when I
am entering into Eternity, and am to appear before my Judge; and as I desire
Salvation and do expect eternal Salvation and happiness from Him, from my
Birth to my Scaffold, I am free from any accession by my Knowledge, concerning
Counsel or any other way to his late Ma. death; And I pray the Lord preserve
his present Maj. and to pour his best blessings on his Person and Government;
and the Lord give him good and faithful counselors. Turn-about to his Friends,
he said, Many Christians may stumble at this, and my Friends may be
discontented; But when things are rightly considered, my friends have no
Discredit of Me, nor Christians no Stumbling block, but rather an Encouragement.

The last Speech and Testimony of MR JAMES GUTHRIE, Minister of the Gospel at
Sterlin, at his Death at Edinburgh, Jun. 1. 1661. which a day or two before his
Death he wrote, and left with some of his Friends sealed and attested under his
own hand.
MEn and Brethren, I fear many of you become hither to gaze, rather then to be
edified by the carriage and last words of a dying man: But if any have an hear
to hear, as I hope some of this great confluence have, I desire your audience
to a few words. I am come hither to lay down this earthly Tabernacle and mortal
flesh of mine; and I bless God, through His Grace I do it willingly and not by
constraint. I say, I suffer willingly: If I had been so minded, I might have
made a diversion, and not been a Prisoner; But being conscious to my Self of
nothing worthy of Death or of Bonds, I would not stain my Innocence with the
suspicion of guiltiness by my withdrawing: neither have I wanted opportunities
and advantages to escape since I was Prisoner, not by the fault of my keepers
(God knows) but otherwise; But neither for this had I Light or Liberty; left
I should reflect upon the Lord's Name, and offend the Generation of the
Righteous: And if some men have not been mistaken, or dealt deceatfully in
telling me so, I might have avoided not only the severity of the Sentence, but
also had much favor and countenance, by complying with the courses of the time:
But I durst not redeem my Life with the loss of my Integrity; God knows I
durst not; and that since I was Prisoner, He has so holden me by the hand,
that he never suffered me to bring it in debate in my inward thoughts, much
less to propone or hearken to any overture of that kind. I did judge it better
to Suffer then to Sin; And therefore I am come hither to lay down my life this
day. And I bless God, I die not as a Fool; Not that I have any thing wherein to
glory in my self: I acknowledge that I am a Sinner, yea one of the greatest and
vilest that hes owned a profession of Religion, and one of the most unworthy
that hes Preached the Gospel; my corruptions have been strong and many, and
have made me a sinner in all things, yea even in following my duty: And
therefore Righteousness have I none of mine own, all is vile; But I do believe
that Jesus Christ came into the World to save sinners whereof I am Chief:
Through Faith in his Righteousness and Blood have I obtained Mercy; and through
Him and Him alone, have I the hope of a blessed conquest and Victory over Sin,
and Satan, and Hell, and Death, and that I shall attain unto the Resurrection
of the Just; and be made Partaker of Eternal Life. I know in whom I have
believed, and that He is able to keep than which I have committed unto Him
against that day. I have Preached Salvation through His Name, and as I have
preached so do I Believe, and do commend the Riches of His Free Grace and Faith
in His Name unto you all, as the only way whereby ye can be saved.

And as I bless the Lord that I die not as a fool; so also that I die not for
Evil-doing. Not a few of you may happily judge, that I suffer as a Thief, or as
a Murderer, or as an evil Doer, or as an Bussy body in other men's matters. It
was the lot of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and has been of many of His
Precious Servants and People to suffer by the World as evil Doers: and as my
soul scareth not at it, but desires to rejoice in being brought into
Conformity with my Blessed Head, and so blessed a Company in this thing; so do
I desire and Pray that I may be to none of you to day, upon this account a
stone of stumbling and a rock of offense: Blessed is he that shall not be
offended at Jesus Christ and his poor servants and members, because of their
being condemned as evil doers by the World. God is my record, that in these
things, for which Sentence of Death has passed against me, I have a good
Conscience: I bless God, they are not matters of Compliance with Sectaries, or
Designs or Practices against His Majest. Person or Government, or the Person
or Government of His Royal Father: My heart (I bless God) is conscious unto no
Disloalty; Nay, Loyal I have been, and I commend it unto you to be Loyal and
obedient in the Lord. True Piety is the foundation of True Loyalty: A wicked
man may be a flatterer and a Time-server, but he will never be a Loyal Subject.
But to return to my purpose, the matters for which I am condemned, are matters
belonging to my Calling and Function as a Minister of the Gospel, such as the
Discovery and Reproving of Sin; The pressing the holding fast of the Oath of
God in the Covenant, and preserving and carrying on the Work of Religion and
Reformation according thereto; And Denying to acknowledge the Civil Magistrate
as the Proper Competent Judge in causes Ecclesiastical: That in all these
things which (God so ordering by His gracious Providence) are the grounds of my
Indictment and Death, I have a good Conscience, as having walked therein
according to the Light and Rule of God's Word, and as did become a Minister of
the Gospel.

I do also bless the Lord, that I do not die as one not desired. I know that by
not a few I neither have been nor am desired. It has been my lot to have been
a man of Contention and Sorrow: But it is my comfort, that for my own things I
have not contended, but for the things of Jesus Christ, for what relates to
His Interest and Work, and the well being of His People. In order to the
preserving and promoting of these, I did Protest against, and stood in
Opposition unto these late Assemblies at St Andrews, Dundee and Edinburgh; and
the Public Resolutions for bringing the Malignant Party into the Judicatories
and Armies of this Kingdom, conceaving the same contrary to the Word of God,
and to our Solemn Covenants and Engagements; and to be an inlet to Defection,
and to the Ruin and destruction of the Work of God. And it is now manifest to
many consciences, that I have not been therein mistaken; nor was not fighting
against a man of straw. I was also desirous and did use some poor Endeavors to
have the Church of God purged of Insufficient and Scandalous and Corrupt
Ministers and Elders; for these things I have been mistaken by some, and hated
by others: But I bless the Lord, as I had the testimony of my own Conscience;
so I was and am therein approven, in the consciences of many of the Lord's
precious Servants and People; and how little soever I may die Desired by some,
yet by these I know I do die Desired, and their approbation, and prayers, and
affection is of more value with me, then the Contradiction, or Reproach, or
Hatred of many others; the love of the one I cannot Recompense, and the
mistake, or hatred, or reproach of the other; I do with all my heart Forgive;
and wherein I have offended any of them, do beg their mercy and forgiveness. I
do from my soul wish that my death may be profitable unto both, that the one
may be confirmed and established in the straight ways of the Lord, and that
the other (if the Lord so will) may be convinced, and cease from these things
that are not good, and do not Edify but Destroy.

One thing I would warn you all of, that God is wroth, yea very wroth with
Scotland, and threatens to depart and remove His candlestick: The causes of
his wrath are many, and would to God it were not One great cause, that Causes
of Wrath are despised and rejected of men. Consider the case that is recorded
Ier. 36. and the consequence of it, and tremble and fear. I cannot but also
say, that there is a great addition and increase of wrath. 1. By that deludge
of Prophanity that overfloweth all the Land, and has reins loosed unto it
every where, in so far that many have lost not only all use and exercise of
Religion, but even of Morality, and that common Civility that is to be found
amongst the Heathen. 2. By that horrible Treachery and Perjury that is in the
matter of the Covenant, and Cause of God, and Work of Reformation: Be
astonished, O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate,
says the Lord; for my People have committed two evils, they have forsaken me
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns
that can hold no water: Shall be break the Covenant, and prosper? Shall the
throne of iniquity have fellowship with God, which frames mischief by a Law? I
fear the Lord be about to bring a Sword on these Lands, which shall avenge the
quarrel of His Covenant. 3. Horrible Ingratitude: The Lord after 10 years
oppression and bondage has broken the yoke of Strangers from off our necks;
but what do we render unto Him for this goodness? Most of the fruit of our
delivery is to work wickedness, and to strengthen our Selves to do evil. 4. A
most dreadful Idolatry, and sacrificing to the Creature: We have changed the
glory of the Incorruptible God, into the image of a corruptible Man, in whom
many have placed almost all their Salvation and desire, and have turned that
which might have been a Blessing unto us (being kept in a due line of
Subordination under God) into an Idol of Jealousy, by preferring it before him.
God is also wroth with a generation of Carnal, Corrupt, Time-serving Ministers:
I know and bear testimony that in the Church of Scotland, there is a True and
Faithful Ministry: Blessed be God, we have yet many who study their duty, and
desire to be found faithful to their Lord and Master; And I pray you to Honor,
and Reverence, and Esteem much of these for their Works sake: And I pray them
to be encouraged in their Lord and Master, who is with them to make them as
iron-pillars, and brazen walls, and as a strong defenced city in the faithful
following of their duty: But oh! that there were not too many who mind Earthly
things, and are enemies to the cross of Jesus Christ, who push with the side
and shoulder, who strengthen the hands of evil doers, who make themselves
transgressors, by stustudying to build again what they did formerly warrantably
destroy, I mean PRELACY, and the CEREMONIES, and the SERVICE BOOK, a Mystery of
iniquity that works amongst us, whose steps lead unto the house of the great
Whore, BABYLON, the Mother of fornications: Or whosoever else he be that
builds this Jericho again, let him take heed of the curse of Hiel the
Bethelite, and of that flying roll thereatened Zech. 5. And let all Ministers
take heed that they Watch, and be Steadfast in the Faith, and quit themselves
like men, and be strong; and give faithful and seasonable Warning concerning
Sin and Duty. Many of the Lords People do sadly complain of the fainting and
silence of many Watchmen; And it concerns them to consider what God calls
for at their hands in such a day: Silence now in a Watchman, when he is so much
called to speak, and give his Testimony upon the Peril of his life, is
doubtless a great Sin. The Lord open the mouths of His Servants to speak his
word with all boldness, that Covenant Breaking may be discovered and reproved,
and that the Kingdom of Jesus Christ may not be supplanted, nor the souls of
His People destroyed without a witness. I have but a few words more to add: All
that are Profane amongst you, I exhort them to Repentance, for the day of the
Lord's vengeance hasteneth and is near: But there is yet a door of mercy open
for you, if ye will not despise the day of salvation. All that are Maligners,
and Reproachers, and Persecuters of Godliness, and of such as live godly, take
heed what ye do, it will be hard for you to kick against the Pricks; You make
your selves the Butt of the Lord's fury, and his flaming indignation, if ye do
not cease from and repent of all your ungodly deeds. All that are Neutral, and
Indifferent, and Lukewarm Professors, be zealous and repent; lest the Lord spew
you out of His mouth. You that lament after the Lord, and mourn for all the
abominations that are done in this City, and in the Land, and take pleasure in
the stones and dust of Zi^n, cast not away your confidence, but be comforted
and encouraged in the Lord. He will yet appear to your joy, God has not cast
away his People nor work in Britain and Ireland: I hope it shall once more
Revive by the Power of His Spirit, and take root downward and bear fruit
upward. There is yet a Holy Seed and precious Remnant, whom God will preserve
and bring forth: but how Long or Dark, our Night may be, I do not know; the
Lord shorten it for the sake of his Chosen. In the mean while, be ye patient
and steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, and in
love one to another: Beware of Snares which are strawed thick: Cleave to the
Covenant and Work of Reformation: Do not decline the Cross of Jesus Christ;
choose rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the
pleasurs of sin for a season; and account the Reproach of Christ greater riches
then all the Treasure of the World. Let my Death grieve none of you, it will be
more profitable and advantageous both for me, and for you, and for the Church
of God, and for Christ's interest and honor, then my life could have been. I
forgive all men the guilt of it, and I desire you to do so also: Pray for them
that persecute you, and bless them that curse you, bless I say, and curse not.
I die in the Faith of the Apostles and Primitive Christians, and Protestant
Reformed Churches, particularly of the Church of Scotland, whereof I am a
member and Minister. I bear my witness and Testimony to the Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline and Government of the Church of Scotland, by Kirk-Sessions,
Presbyteries, Synods and General Assemblies. Popery and Prelacy, and all the
trumpery of Service and Ceremonies that wait upon them, I do abhor. I do bear
my witness unto the National Covanant of Scotland, and Solemn League and
Covenant betwixt the three Kingdoms of Scotland, England and Ireland: These
Sacred, Solemn, Public Oaths of God, I believe can be loosed nor dispensed
with, by no Person, or Party, or Power upon earth: but are still binding upon
these Kingdoms, and will be for ever hereafter; and are ratifyed and sealed by
the conversion of many thousand souls, since our entering thereinto. I bear my
witness to the Protestation against the controverted Assemblies and the Public
Resolutions; to the Testimonies given against the Sectaries; against the course
of Backsliding and Defection that is now on foot in the Land, and all the
branches and parts thereof, under whatsoever name or notion, or acted by
whatsoever party or person. And in the last place, I bear my witness to the
cross of Jesus Christ; and that I never had cause nor have cause this day, to
repent because of any thing I have suffered, or can now suffer for His Name: I
take God to record upon my soul, I would not exchange this scaffold, with the
Palace or Mitre of the greatest prelate in Britain. Blessed be God, who has
showed mercy to such a wretch, and has revealed His Son in me, and made me a
Minister of the Everlasting Gospel, and that He has daigned in the midst of
much contradiction from Satan and the World, to seal my Ministry upon the
hearts of not a few of His People, and especially in the station wherein I was
last, I mean the Congregation, and Presbytery of Sterlin. God forgive the poor
empty Man, that did there intrude upon my labors, and has made a prey of many
poor souls, and exposed others to reproach, and oppression, and a famine of the
Word of the Lord. God forgive the misleaders of that part of the poor people,
who tempted them to reject their own Pastor, and to admit of Intruders; and the
Father of mercies, pity that poor Misled people: And the Lord visit the
Congregation and Presbytery of Sterlin once more with faithful Pastors; and
grant that the Work and People of God may be revived through all Britain, and
over all the World. Jesus Christ is my Light, and my Life, my Righteousness, my
Strength and my Salvation: He is all my Salvation, and all my Desire. Him, O
Him I do with all the strength of my soul commend unto you. Blessed are they
that are not offended in Him: Blessed are they that Trust in Him. Bless Him, O
my soul, from henceforth even for ever. Rejoice, rejoice all ye that love Him;
be patient and rejoice in tribulation: Blessed are you, and blessed shall you
be for ever and ever. Everlasting Righteousness and Eternal Salvation is yours:
All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods. Remember me O Lord with
the favor thou bear to thy People; O visit me with thy Salvation, that I
may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy
Nation, that I may glory with thy Inheritance. Now let thy servant depart in
peace since mine eyes have seen thy salvation.

JA. GUTRHIE.

The last Speech and Testimony of the LORD WARIST0N, At his Death in Edinburgh,
July 22. 1663.
Right Honorable, much honored, and beloved Auditors and Spectators.
THat which I intended and prepared to have spoken at this time and in this
condition, immediately before my death (if it should be so ordered that it
should be my lot) is not at present in my power, having been taken from me: But
I hope the Lord shall preserve it to bear my Testimony more fully and clearly,
then now I can in this condition, having my Memory much destroyed, through much
sore and long Sickness, Melancholy, and excessive drawing of my Blood. Though I
bless the Lord my God, that notwithstanding of the forementioned distempers, I
am in some capacity to leave this short and weak Testimony.

I desire in the first place to confess my Sins, so far as is proper to this
Place and Case, and to acknowledge Gods Mercies; and to express my Repentance
of the one, and my Faith of the other, through the merits of the Lord Jesus
Christ our gracious Redeemer and Mediator: I confess that my Natural Temper (or
rather distemper) has been Hasty and Passionat; and that in my Manner of going
about and prosecuting of the best pieces of work and service to the Lord and to
my Generation, I have been subject to my excesses of Heat, and thereby to some
Precipitations; which has no doubt offended standers by and lookers on, and
has exposed both Me and the Work to their mistakes, whereby the beauty of that
Work has been obscured: Neither have I in following of the Lord's work, His
Good Work, been without my own Self-seeking; which has several ways vented
is self to the offense of both God and Man, and to the grief thereafter of my
own Conscience, and which has often made me groan, and cry out with the
Apostle, O miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of
death? And to ly low in the dust mourning and lamenting over the same,
deprecating God's wrath, and begging His tender Mercies to Pardon, and His
powerful Grace to cure all these evils. I must withal confess, that it does not
a little trouble me, and ly heavy upon my spirit, and will bring me down with
sorrow to the grave (though I was not alone in this Offense, but had the body
of the Nation going before me, and the Example of persons of all Ranks to
ensnare me) That I suffered my self through the power of temptations, and the
too much fear anent the straits that my numerous Family might be brought into,
to be carried unto so great a length of Compliance in England with the late
Usurpers, which did much grieve the hearts of the Godly, and made these that
sought God ashamed and confounded for my sake, and did give no small occasion
to the Adversary to reproach and blaspheme, and did withal not a little obscure
and darken the beauty of several former Actings about His blessed and glorious
Work of Reformation, happily begun and far advanced in these Lands, wherein He
was graciously pleased to Employ, and by Employing to Honor me to be an
Instrument (though the least and unworthiest of many) whereof I am not ashamed
this day, but account it my Glory, how ever that Work be now cried down,
opposed, laid in the dust and trod upon: And my turning aside to comply with
these men, was the more aggravated in my person, that I had so frequently and
seriously made profession of my Aversness from and Abhorrence of that way, and
had shown much Dissatisfaction with these that had not gone so great a length;
for which as I seek God's mercy in Christ Jesus, so I desire that all the
Lord's People, from my example may be more stirred up to watch and pray, that
they enter not into temptation.

2. I do not deny on the other hand, but must: Testify in the second place, to
the Glory of His Free Grace, that the Lord my God has often showed and
engraven upon my Conscience, the Testimony of His Reconciling and Reconciled
Mercy through the Merits of Jesus Christ, pardoning all my iniquities, and
assuring me that He would deliver me also by the graces of His Holy Spirit,
from the spait, tyranny and dominion thereof; And has often drawn out my
spirit to the exercise of Repentance and Faith, and after engraven upon my
heart in legible characters His merciful pardon, and gracious begun cure
thereof to be perfected thereafter, to the Glory of His Name, the Salvation of
my Soul, and Edification of His Church.

3. I am pressed in conscience to leave here at my death, my true and honest
Testimony in the sight of God and Man, to and for the National Covenant: the
Solemn League and Covenant; the Solemn Acknowledgement of our Sins, and
Engagement to our duties; to all the grounds and Causes of Fasts and
humiliations, and of the Lords displeasure and contending with the Land; And to
the several Testimonies given to His Interests, by General Assemblies,
Commissioners of the Kirk, Presbyteries, and by other honest and faithful
Ministers and Professors.

4. I am pressed also to encourage His Doing, Suffering; Witnessing People, and
Sympathizing ones with these that suffer, that they would continue in the
duties of Mourning, Praying, Witnessing and Symparthizing with these that
suffer; and humbly to assure them in the Name of the Lord our God, the God of
His own Word and Work, of His own Cause, Covenant and People, that He will be
Seen, Found and Felt (in His own gracious Way and Time, by His own Means and
Instruments, for His own Glory and Honor) to return to His own Truths and
Interests and Servants, and revive His Name, His Covenant, His Word, His Work,
His Sanctuary and His Saints in these Nations, even in the three Covenanted
Nations, which were by so Solemn Bonds, Covenants, Subscriptions and Oaths,
given away and devoted unto Himself.

5. I exhort all these that have been, or are Enemies or unfreinds to the
Lord's Name, Covenant or Cause, Word, Work or People, in Britain and Ireland,
to Repent and Amend, before these sad judgments that are posting fast come
upon them, for their sinning so highly against the Lord, because of any
temptation of the Time on the right or left hand, by Baits or Straits
whatsoever, and that after so many Professions and Engagements to the contrary.

6. I dare not conceal from you that are Friendly to all the Lord's Interests,
that the Lord (to the commendation of His Grace, be it humbly spoken) has
several times, in the exercise of my Repentance and Faith during my trouble,
and after groans and tears upon these three notable chapters, to wit, the 9 of
Ezra, the 9 of Nehemiah, and the 9 of Daniel, with other such suitable
Scriptures, and in the very nick of fervent and humble Supplication to Him, for
the Reviving again of His Name, Cause, Covenant, Word, and Work of Reformation
in these Covenanted Nations, and particularly in poor Scotland, which first
solemnly engaged to Him, to the good Example and Encouragement of His People in
the other two Nations to do the same also, That the Lord, I say, has several
times given to me good ground of hope and lively expectations of His Merciful,
Gracious, Powerful and Wonderful Renewing and Reviving again of His
forementioned great Interests in these Covenanted Nations: And that in such a
Way, by such Means and Instruments, with such Antecedents, Concurrents,
Consequents, and Effects, as shall wonderfully rejoice His Mourning Friends,
and astonish His Contradicting and counter-acting Enemies.

7. I do earnestly recommend my poor Wife and Children and (...) posterity, to
the choicest Blessings of God, an^ ^o the Prayers and Favor of all the Lord's
Children an^ Servants, in their earnest dealing with God and Men ^n their
behalf, That they may not be ruined for ^y Cause, but for the Lord my God's
sake, they (...) be favored, assisted, supplied and comforted, (...) so may be
fitted by the Lord for His Fellowship and Service; whom God Himself has moved
me often, in their own Presence, and. with their own Consent, to dedicate,
devote and resign alike and as well, as I devote and resign my own Soul and
Body to Him for all Time and Eternity.

8. I beg the Lord to open the eyes of all the Instruments of my Trouble, that
are not deadly Irreconcilable Enemies to Himself and His People, that they may
see the wrong done by them to His Interests and People, and to Me and Mine, and
may repent thereof and return to the Lord, and may more cordially own and
adhere to all His Interests in time coming: The good Lord give unto them
Repentance, Remission and Amendment; and that is the worst wish I wish them,
and the best wish I can wish unto them.

9. I do earnestly beg the fervent prayers of all His Praying People, Servants
and Instruments, whether absent or present wherever they be, in behalf of His
Name, Cause and Covenant, Work and People; and in behalf of my Wife, Children
and their Posterity: And that the Lord would glorify Himself, edify His Church,
encourage His Saints, further His Work, accomplish His good Word, by all His
Doings and Dealings, in Substance and Circumstance toward all His own.

10. Whereas I have heard that some of my unfreinds have slandered and defamed
my Name, as if I had been accessory to his late Majesty's death, and to the
making of the Change of the Government thereupon; the great God of Heaven be
witness and Judge between Me and my Accusers in this; for I am free (as I shall
now answer before his Tribunal) from any Accession by Counsel or Contrivance,
or any other way to his late Majesty's death, or to their making that change
of Government: And I pray the Lord to preserve our present King his Majesty,
and to pour out His best blessings upon his royal Posterity, and to give unto
them good and faithful Counselors, holy and wise Counsels and prosperous
successes, to God's Glory and to the good and interest of His people, and to
Their own Honor and Happiness.

11. I do here now submit and commit my Soul and Body, Wife and Children and
Childrens Children from generation to generation for ever, with all others his
Friends and Followers, all His Doing and Suffering, Witnessing and Sympathizing
ones, in the present and subsequent Generations, unto the Lord's choice
Mercies, Graces, Favors, Services, Employments, Impowerments, Enjoyments,
Improvements and Inheritments, on Earth and in Heaven, in Time and Eternity.
All which suits with all others, which He has at any time by His Spirit moved
and assisted me to make and put up, according to His will, I leave before and
upon the Father's Merciful Bowels, and the Son's Mediating Merits, and the
Holy Spirit's Compassionate Groans, for now and evermore. Amen.

The Joint Testimony of these who died together in Edinburgh, Dec, 7. 1666.
subscribed by them in prison, the same day of their death.
Men and Brethren.
THis is a great and important work, both for us who are now to render up our
spirits to Him that gave them; And for you who are not a little concerned in the
Cause, and in our blood by justifying or condemning our sentence: And
therefore, as we speak to you as Dying men, who dare not dissemble with God or
man, nor flatter our selves; So ye should not be idle, curious, or unconcerned
Spectators.

We are condemned by men, and esteemed by many as Rebels against the King
(whose Authority we acknowledge) But this is our rejoicing, the testimony of
our conscience, that we suffer not as Evil doers, but for Righteousness, for
the Word of God, and Testimony of Jesus Christ; And particularly for our
renewing the Covenant, and in pursuance thereof, for Preserving and Defending
of our selves by Arms, against the Usurpation and insupportable Tyranny of the
Prelates; And against the most unchristian and inhumane Oppression and
Persecution, that ever was enjoined and practiced by just Rulers, upon Free,
Innocent and Peaceable Subjects.

The Covenant and Cause being so just in themselves, and the duties of
Self-preservation and mutual Defense in maintenance thereof, being to Judicious
and unbyassed men so clear, we need to say the less for vindication of our
Practice: Only, the Laws establishing Prelacy, and the Acts, Orders and
Proclamations made for Compliance therewith, being executed against us by
Military Force and Violence; And we with others, for our simple Forbearance,
being Fined, Confined, Imprisoned, Exiled, Scourged, Stigmatized, Beaten, Bound
as beasts, and Driven unto the mountains for our lives; And thereby hundreds of
Families being beggared, several Parishes and some whole Country-sides
exceedingly impoverished; And all this, either Arbitrarily and without any Law,
or respect had to guilt or innocence; Or Unjustly contrary to all Conscience,
Justice and Reason, though under the Pretense of iniquous Laws; and without
regard had to the penalty specifyed in the Law: And all Remonstrating of
Grievances (were they never so just and many) and Petitions for Redress, being
restrained by Laws condemning all former Remonstrances and Petitions in the
like cases; There was no other remedy left to us, but that last of necessary
Self-preservation and Defense. And this being one of the greatest Principles of
Nature, warranted by the Law or God, Scriptural Instances, and the consent and
Practices of all Reformed Churches and Christian States abroad, and of our own
famous Predecessors at home, It cannot in reason or Justice, be reputed a
Crime, nor condemned as Rebellion by any humane Authority.

Though we be not the first that have suffered for the Cause or God within the
Land, yet we are among the first that have been Legally condemned and put to
Death Expressly for taking the Covenant: And we are so far from being ashamed
thereof, that we account it our honor to be reckoned worthy to suffer for such
a Cause; And cannot but bless the Lord, that we have such a cloud of Witnesses,
in this and other Reformed Churches, going before us in the same duty for
Substance, and in Suffering therefore.

We cannot but regret (if we could with tears o^ blood) the National and
Authorized Backsliding of the Land, by Perjury and breach of Covenant; The
overturning of the Work of Reformation; The great Desolation of the House of
the Lord, by smiting of the Shepherds and scattering of the Flocks; The
Intrusion of so many mercenary Hirelings into the Ministry, who because of
Apostasy, Perjury, Ignorance and Profanness, can neither be acknowledged as
God's mouth to the People in Preaching, nor employed as their mouth to Him in
Prayer; The abounding of Popery, Superstition, and Profanness by unheard of
Oaths, Blasphemies, Uncleannesss and Drinking, even in some whose Office and
Place requires them to be more Examplary; And the shedding of the Blood of the
Saints by the rage of Persecution: And therefore we cannot but disown all these
abominable Laws, Courses and Practices, and declare our abhorrence of the same,
and dissent therefrom; Protesting before Angels and Men, that we be not
interpreted as consenters thereto, and beseeching the Hearer of prayer, that we
be not involved in the guilt thereof, nor partake of the plagues which follow
thereupon.

As this Land was happy above all Nations, for the purity and plenty of the
Gospel, and for a Form of Church Government more conform to the Pattern in the
Scriptures, then in others of the Reformed Churches; So we acknowledge His
great goodness to us in special, that gave us our lines in such pleasant
places: For we have such full persuasion of the Truth of the Reformed Religion
in the Church of Scotland, And have felt so much of the Power and Sweetness
thereof, that we do here declare our firm belief and persuasion of, and
adherence to the same, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government,
according to the National Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, the
Confession of Faith, Catechisms, Directory of worship, and Propositions for
Government; Accounting it our honor and happiness to have been born in it, to
have lived in Communion with it, and now to die (through Grace) Members,
Witnesses and Asserters thereof.

And further as Christians and as Members of the same Church and Commonwealth;
in the Fear and zeal of our God, in Love to our Brethren, in desire of the
Perservation of Church and Kingdom, and for our own Exoneration, now when we
take our leave of the World, We do seriously and in the bowels of Christ,
Supplicate, Warn, Exhort and Obtest you all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom,
from the King to, the meanest of the Subjects, according to your old
Principles, Professions, Promises, Declarations, Oaths and Covenants,
faithfully to Own, Maintain, preserve and Defend the said Religion; And after
the example of our Noble and Renowned Ancestors to quit your selves like Men
and Christians, in endeavoring by all just Means, according to your Places and
Powers, to shake off this heavy yoke of PRELACY, which neither we nor our
fathers were able to bear, and which is Destructive to all our true Interests,
Religious and Civil; As ye would not involve your selves in the guilt and
plagues of Perjury and Breach of Covenant; And as you tender the good of your
own Names, Persons, Estates, Families and Liberties, as well as of your
immortal Souls; And as ye would partake of the good of God's chosen, and of our
joys, when ye come so near Eternity as we are.

We shall say no more, but as we were not afraid to take our lives in our
hands, so we are not afraid to lay them down in this Cause; And as we are not
ashamed of Christ because of His cross, so we would not have you offended in
Christ nor discouraged because of us: For we bear you record, that we would not
exchange lots with our Adversaries; nor redeem our Lives, Liberties and
Fortunes, at the price of Perjury and breach of Covenant.

And further we are assured, though this be the da^ of Jacob's trouble, that
yet the Lord, when He has accomplished the Trial of His own, and filled up
the cup of His Adversaries, He will awake for judgment, plead His own Cause,
avenge the quarrel of His Covenant, make inquiry for blood, vindicate His
People, break the arm of the wicked, and establish the just; For to Him
belongs judgment and vengeance: And though our eyes shall not see it, yet we
believe that the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing under His wings;
and that He will revive His Work, repair the breaches, build the old wastes,
and raise up the desolations; Yea the Lord will judge His people, and repent
Himself for His servants, when their power is gone, and there is none shut up
or left: And therefore, Rejoice, O ye Nations, with His People: For He will
avenge the blood of His servants, and will render vengeance to His adversaries,
and He will be merciful to His Land and People. So let thy Enemies perish O
Lord; but let them that love Him, be as the Sun when He goes forth in His
might.

Another Testimony which was* also left by such of the Former ten Persons, as
were in the same Chamber with Thomas Paterson Merchant in Glasgow; who, being
in like manner Indicted but dying of his Wounds before Sentence, did communicate
the same to his friends, with his Assent thereunto.
MEn and Brethren, being condemned by our Rulers as Traitors, lest we should
seem to many to suffer as evil doers, In the first place, we bless and praise
the Lord our God, who has made us (the unworthiest of all men) Worthy to be
faithful to Him, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and in simplicity and
godly Sincerity, singly to mind his glory; and who also makes the cross of
Christ (though by men superscribed with Treason) our sweet consolation, and his
own joy our strength.

2. We declare in the presence of the same God, before whom we are now ready to
appear, that we did not intend to Rebel against the King and his just
Authority, Whom as we acknowledge for our Lawful Sovereign; so we do earnestly
pray in his behalf, that God would open his eyes and Convert his heart, that he
may remember his Vows made unto God, relieve this oppressed Kirk, and long
reign and flourish in righteousness.

3. We declare, that perceaving the Holy Covenants of our God broken, the Work
of the Lord overturned, the Gospel and Kingdom of Jesus Christ despised and
trampled upon, his pure Ordinances corrupted, his faithful and our
soul-refreshing Ministers cast out, and the Land filled with Perjury and
Profanity, and like to be hurried back to that gulf of Ignorance, Superstition
and Confusion, whence the Lord did so gloriously deliver us; And finding our
selves not only Spoiled of our most precious blessings, and most dear
enjoyments, but urged and compelled by cruel Violence and Barbarous Persecution
to wicked Apostasy from our Holy Covenants, and to Rebellion against our God;
And all this done by no other hand then the wicked and perjured Prelates; And
for no other ends (whatever they may pretend) then the satisfying of their own
vile lusts, and establishing their so often abjured Antichristian Tyranny, over
both Souls and Bodies of Men; And lastly finding former Petitions condemned as
Seditious, and our private complaints (when but muttered) insolently rejected,
We did in the fear and Zeal of our God, and by the warrant of his Holy Word,
according to the first and most Innocent instinct of pure Nature, and the
Practice of all People and Persons in the like case; And after the Example of
all the oppressed Kirks of Jesus Christ, and of our Noble Ancestors, take the
Sword of Necessary Self-defence, from the rage and fury of these wicked and
violent Men* until we might make our heavy Grievances known to his Majesty, and
obtain from his Justice a satisfying remedy.

We will not now mention our particular Sufferings, nor the sighs and groans
of poor wasted Galloway, which though very heavy from the hand of man, are all
to light for Jesus Christ; Nor are we willing to reflect upon these grievous
and bitter Laws and Edicts, by which they seem to be warranted: Only we know
that God is Righteous, whose Laws and judgments are Superior and above all the
Laws and Actions of men. And to him who will judge righteously, We intirly
Commit our Cause, which is none other, then the Reviving of the Work of God and
Renewing of his Covenant: Which though it pleased the Holy and Wise God, not to
favor with Success in the field, and though by men it be made our
Condemnation, yet it is our Righteousness) Innocence and Confidence in his
sight. And all praise and thanks be unto our God, who not only kept us steadfast
in his Covenant, and made us Willing and Ready to adventure our Lives for His
Name; but has also accepted and dignifyed our Offer, with this public
Appearance: Where, in his own glorious presence before whom we shall instantly
appear, and before our often Sworn and once Zealous and tender Brethren in the
same Cause, and in midst of Thee O Edinburgh, once famous for the Glory and
Zeal of God and of this Covenant, we may give and Seal this our Testimony with
our blood.

We therefore the unworthiest of all the Faithful, do in the Spirit of God and
Glory, Testify and Seal with our Blood and Lives, that both the National
Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant are in Themselves Holy, Just, and
True, and perpetually Binding, containing no other thing, then our
Indispensable Obligations to all Duties of Religion and Righteousness,
according to the revealed Will of God, which no Authority nor Power of Man, is
or ever shall be able to disannul; And that our blessed Reformations both from
Popery and Prelacy, and all that was done or ensued, in the sincere and upright
prosecution thereof, was and is the Work of God, which though Men fight
against, yet shall they never be able to prevail: And as this is our Faith, so
it is our Hope to all that wait for the Salvation of God, that Our God will
surely appear for his own Glory, and vindicate his Cause and persecuted People,
and render vengeance to his Adversaries even the vengeance of his Holy Temple
and broken Covenent. O be not then moved with our Sufferings with are but Light
and Momentany, for they Work for us a far more, execeding and Eternal weight of
Glory, and for you also a strong Confirmation and abounding Consolation,
against the like trial that possibly may befall you. O then save your selves
from this Wicked and Apostat Generation, and be ye steadfast, unmovable,
always abounding in the Work and Cause of the Lord; Waiting for the appearance
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which in his Times he shall show, who only has
Immortality, dwelling in the Light which no man can approach, whom no man has
seen, or can see, to whom be honor and Power everlasting. AMEN.

The Testimony of CAPT. ANDREW ARNOT, one of the former ten who died. December. 7.
DEar Friends and Spectators, I am brought by the good providence of God to
this public place of execution (which is no dishonor) for points of Treason,
as is alleged; but God knows (who knows the secrets of hearts) whether in
Rebellion or not, I came forth: He is my witness and will be my Judge. And
whoever they be that any way have been isntrumental or incensed against me to
procure this Sentence against me, God forgive them, and I forgive them. I am
not now purposed to disput the matter of my being in company with these worthy
Christians who are now defeat and broken, their blood shed, and they
despitfully mocked by many: I acknowledge and declare that I was with them. As
to the cause of my being with them, whither in Rebellion or not God knows,
and all Israel shall know. And for me, I say the Cause is the Lords, who made
the Heaven and the Earth, though now it be hated. And I desire to bear witness
(with the rest of the worthy witnesses, who are gone before and are now staged)
to that glorious Work of Reformation in Britain and Ireland, and to
Gospel Ordinances in their Purity, as they have been taught and administrated
these 30 Years last by past, And I adhere to the Presbyterial way of Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline, and Government, by General Assemblies, Synods,
Presbyteries, and Sessions, according to the Pattern of the holy Scriptures
(Jesus Christ himself being the head Cornerstone) the Confession of faith,
Cathechismes Shorter and Larger, Directory for Worship, National Covenant,
Solemn League and Covenant, and every Paper tending to the good of the true
Religion. And this I think fit to Testify and Declare under my hand (not
knowing if I shall have any Liberty to speak,) and intend, God willing, to Seal
with my Blood shortly. I confess that unexpectedly I am come to this place,
(though some times I have had some small thoughts of it) And I do account my
self highly honored to be reckoned amongst the witnesses of Jesus Christ, to
suffer for his Name, Truth and Cause; and this day I esteem it my Glory,
Garland, Crown and royal dignity to fill up a part of His sufferings. And now
I take my leave of you all my dear and worthy Friends and acquaintances. The
Blessings of the Eternal God be multiplied upon you and your seed, and upon
all the suffering Friends of Christ this day; upon my dear and loving Wife, who
has been a faithful sympathizer with me, and upon my dear Children. The work
of God is now at under, but Christ shall carry the Day: Blessed is he that
believes and sees not, for there shall be a performance. Now the Eternal
God, who brought again the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, the great sheepherd
of the flock, strengthen and establish you and all the Lord's people. So pray
ye and so prays your Friend.

ANDREW ARNOT.

The Testimony of JOHN SHIELDS, Yeoman one of the former ten who died at
Edinburgh the 7 day of December. 1666.
I Am a man unlearned and not accustomed to speak in public, yet being now
called to witness and suffer for the Lord in public, I cannot be altogether
silent of that which Religion and Reason has taught me anent the cause of my
suffering.

I bless the Lord, I suffer not as an evil doer, especially not for any
Rebellion against his Majesty's lawful Authority; I attest him who is the
searcher of hearts, that was never my intention in the least, and it is as
little the nature and intention of what I have done; But for renewing of the
Covenant with the Lord, and following the ends thereof, as to the suppressing
of abjured Prelates, and Intruders upon the Lords flock, and the restoring of
the Government of the House of God by Presbyteries as He himself has appointed
in his Word, with a faithful, Godly, Called, and Sent Ministry; And together
with pure Ordinances, the Power of Godliness. For this I am condemned and to
suffer this day. This I acknowledged freely before our Judges; This I still
acknowledge, and am persuaded that herein I witness a faithful Confession. This
Cause and Covenant I commend to all the Lord's People. It is not free for you
to forsake if; You are inviolably engaged in it; It is not safe to desert it,
because of the Curse of the perjurer and false swearer. There is unspeakable
blessedness in the pursuance of it, whereof I can bear witness to the Lord by
my rich Experience, since we began to Do and Suffer at this time for him:
Whereupon I cheerfully lay down my Life for this his Cause; He it is who
Justifies it, what man or Authority under heaven can condemn it? Arise O Lord,
let not man prevaill against Thee; plead and Judge this Cause which is thine
own, for thine own names sake.

The Testimony of another of the former ten Persons left subscribed with a
Friend.
I designed no Rebellion against lawful Authority, but the suppressing of
Prelacy and of Profanity; and advancing of Holiness in Gods World: In a Word, I
adhere to all the Articles of the good Covenant, and did intend the restoring
of our good and Soul-refreshing Ministers, and the casting out of the dumb
greedy Dogs that cannot bark. In this Cause I was a free Voluntier pressed by
none, thinking it my duty to appear for helping the Lord against the Mighty.
This I testify under my hand from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, the 6 of December,
1666.

The Testimony of MR ALEXANDER ROBERTSON, Preacher of the Gospel, and
Probationer for the Ministry, who died at Edinburgh, December. 14. 1666.
FEaring that after the example of others, I should not be permitted to speak
openly to the People, I thought fit (beside my adherence to what my brethren,
who have gone before me, left behind them concerning our common Cause) to leave
a word in writ for satisfaction of them who survive me.

That, for preservation and defense of the true Religion of this Church, and
for the relief of my poor brethren afflicted and persecuted therefore, I joined
with others in Arms, and that I renewed the Covenant, that all men might the
better know my Cause and Principles, I am so far from denying or being ashamed
of, that I both acknowledge and avow it as my duty; But let no man that will
not condemn himself upon the same common obligations to do what I did, account
me a Rebel therefore, because with the same breath that I did swear, and with
that same hand that I did subscribe to preserve and defend Religion, I did also
swear to defend the King and his Authority.

Our Church was not more glorious in her self and terrible to her Adversaries,
while we enjoyed pure Ordinances of Word and Sacraments, and her beautiful
Assemblies for Government and Discipline, of the Lords own Institution, then
she became of late deformed by the Usurpation and Tyranny of Prelacy; And I do
solemnly declare as a dying man, who dare not dissemble, that as I thought and
still aver that the erecting of this abjured Prelacy is the cause of much of
the Sin in the Land, and of all the sufferings of the Lords People therein: so
I had no worse design, then the restoring of the Work of Reformation according
to the Covenant, and more particularly the extirpation of Prelacy, to which his
Ma: and all the Subjects are as, much obliged as I. And let that be removed and
the Work of Reformation restored, and I dar^ die in saying, that his Ma: shall
not have in all his Dominions, more loving, loyal, peaceable and faithful
Subjects, then these who for their non-complyance are loaded with the
reproaches of Phanaticisme and Rebellion.

The sufferings and insupportable oppression of these that could not because of
the Command and Oath of God, acknowledge and comply with Prelacy, may seem
light to some in whom the spirit of the old enmity that is betwixt the seed of
the woman and the seed of the serpent remains, and to others (perhaps their
Friends) who look thereupon at adistance; but as there is just reason to think
that if these rigid oppressions had been made known to his Ma: his justice and
clemency would have provided a remedy, and as the half thereof would have made
the Prelates, their patrons and adherents impatiently mad, for as loyal as they
pretend to be; So in the like cases of irresistible necessity, when there is
little open door for representing of grievances and desires, and less hope of
relief thereby, I suppose it will not be found condemned by the Confessions of
Reformed Churches, or doctrine of sound Divines, but that it is authorized by
the light and law of Nature, by uncondemned examples in the Holy Scripture, and
by the practice of all Christian States, by Arms to preserve and defend men
Lives, their Religion, Liberties and Fortunes; And especially, where they are
not seeking to acquire a new Religion or new Liberties, but only to preserve
their old or recover them, when they are violently and unjustly spoiled of the
same, as in our case; Otherwise we should sin against the generation of the
just, and condemn, as rebellious, the most of the through Reformations of the
Reformed Churches abroad, and of our own at home.

If this course was lawful, and if it was our duty to join therein, as I
believe and lay down my life in the persuasion that it was; and if all the
Kingdom was (as they are) bound by Covenant to assist and defend one another in
the ^ommon Cause of Religion and Liberty, whatever may be said of these that
came not forth to help the Lord against the mighty, it cannot but be their
dreadful sin, who joined themselves in Arms, or took Oaths to oppose, suppress
and break it, seeing they have sided themselves against the Lord and his Work,
and their carriage is a much higher degree of Accession to the blood that is
shed, then Paul's keeping of the clothes of them that stoned Stephen to death;
And I wish that they may lay the matter to heart and repent of it, that God may
forgive them, as I forgive all men, and particularly Mor^on who did apprehend
me.

I know that there is a holy seed in the Land, who shall be the substance
thereof, and I pray that the Lord may make them more zealous and valiant for
the truth upon earth; I know also that there are many, whose bowels of
compassion have been drawn forth toward these who took their lives in their
hands, by Prayers to God for them and Charity to them, and especially in
Edinburgh toward the poor Prisoners (of whom I may not only say, that what they
have done deserves to be told for a Memorial wherever the Gospel is preached,
but am assuredly confident, that besides the blessings of the poor and
persecuted, the Lord is not unrighteous to forget their work and labor of love,
which they have showed toward his Name, in that they have ministered to the
Saints and do minister) And yet I must needs regret, that so many in this City
once famous and honored for harmonious owning of the Cause and Covenant of
God, and blessed above many other Cities with solemn Assemblies for Worship and
Government, should have been ensnared into an Oath so contradictory to the Oath
of the Covenant; and which was devised, contrived and imposed in lieu of the
Declaration against the same. and for a Gravestone to suppress the revival of
the Work of God within this Land.

The Apostasy of this Land is very great by Perjury and breach of Covenant, and
so much the worse and more aggreageble, that it is Authorized and very
universal: And as I cannot but regret that so many are ensnared therein, so I
must needs warn all to abhor and beware of all Declarations and Oaths
contradictory to the Covenant and renunciatory thereof, as they would not
involve themselves in the guilt and plagues denounced against, and ordinarily
inflicted upon Perjury and breach of Covenant; and so much the rather, because
this is like to be the Shibboleth and trial of the times.

As for my self, I have seen and do find so much worth in Truth, which is to be
bought at any rate but sold at none, And so much transcendent excellency and
amiableness in Christ, that not only with cheerfulness and confidence I lay
down my life for Him and His Truth, committing my soul to Him to be kept in
hope of a joyful Resurrection of the body; but also bless Him that gave me a
life to lose, and a body to lay down for Him; And although the Merket and price
of Truth may appear to many very high, yet I reckon it low, and all that I have
or can do, little and too little for Him who gave Himself for me and to me; for
I account all things but loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of
Jesus Christ MY LORD, for whom I now suffer the loss of all things, that I may
win Him, and be found in Him, and that I may not only know the fellowship of
His sufferings, but the power of His resurrection, and attain unto the
resurrection of the dead.

And as for you, my dear Friends, as I pray for you, that the God of all grace,
who has called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have
suffered a while, may make you perfect, stablish, strengthen and settle you; so
I recommend to you the same truth, that you be not soon shaken in mind, but
that ye hold fast the profession of your faith without wavering; And as you
have received the Lord, so walk in Him; Warning and obtesting you by all manner
of obligations, and by the hope and joy of that crown which I wait for, that ye
keep your selves unspotted with the abominable courses and practices of these
times, whereunto ye may be tempted by the extremity of suffering; and
particularly that ye beware of unlawful Oaths and Declarations against the
Cause and Covenant of God, that ye have no compliance with, nor give consent
unto this Prelacy, which ye have abjured; And that you be afraid and aware of
Popery, which by Connivance does so visibly abound and daily increase; But by
fighting the good fight and keeping of the faith, you may finish your course,
as I do, in the assurance of the crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous Judge, has laid up and shall give unto me, and not to me only, but
to all them that love His appearance.

ALEXANDER ROBERTSON.

The Testimony of JOHN NILSON, of Corsack who died at Edinburgh. Dec. 14. 1666.
BEing made a spectacle to the World, to Angels, and to Men, I found it
necessary, for vindication of the Truth and of my self, for undeceaving of
some, and encouraging of others, to leave this line behind me, which with my
innocent blood may speak when I am gone.

I am condemned (I shall not say how unjustly) as a Rebel against Man, but the
Lord God of Gods He knows, and all Israel shall know that it is not for
Rebellion against God, but for endeavoring to recover the blessed work of
Reformation, and particularly for endeavoring to extirpate Prelacy, which has
been the cause of so much sin and suffering within this Land, and for renewing
of the Covenant, from the obligation whereof (seeing I made my Vow and Promise
to the Lord) neither I my self, nor any humane Authority can absolve me. And if
any account this Rebellion, I do plainly confess, that after the way which they
call Heresy, I worship the God of my fathers.

Although the insupportable oppression, under which I and many others did
groan, were enough to justify our Preserving and Defending of our selves by
Arms, yet know that the Cause was not Ours but the Lord's; for we suffered all
our grievous Oppressions not for evill-doing, but because we could not in
conscience acknowledge, comply with and obey Prelacy, and submit unto the
Ministry of Ignorant, Light and Profane men, who were irregularly and
violently thurst upon us; Neither did we only or mainly design our civil
Liberties, but the Liberty of the Gospel, the Extirpation of Prelacy, the
Restoration of our faithful Pastors, the Suppression of Profanity, Promoving
of Piety, the saving of ourselves from unjust violence, until we had presented
our Grievances and Desires; And in a word, the Recovering of the once glorious,
but now ruined Work of Reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, according to the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant,
to which I declare my adherence, and through grace shall seal the same with my
blood.

My Advocate drew up a Supplication for me, wherein was acknowledged that I had
been with the Rebels; but let none offend thereat: for ^ do hereby declare,
that I was so far from accounting that course Rebellion, that I judged and
still do judge it was my duty to join therein, and my honor to suffer
therefore; Otherwise, I should have counted my self accessory to the blood of
the Lord's People which is shed? And cannot but regret that others of the
Lord's People, when they heard of us, did not come forth with speed to help the
Lord against the Mighty; much more let all mourn, that not only many have
appeared as Enemies, but also conjured themselves against the Lord, and the
same Covenant which they so solemnly swear; And as for the Petition it self, I
knew not that expression was in it.

Being conscious to my self of so much weakness, and so many heinous sins which
predomine in me, and of unfruitfulness under the Gospel and unsuitable walking
thereto, I confess my self the vilest of sinners, and desire to mourn for the
same, and pray that the Lord for Christ's sake may freely forgive me, as I have
forgiven them that have wronged me, and hope through the righteousness of Jesus
Christ to obtain the same; And I do exhort all and every one of my friends to
more holiness, Prayer and stedfastness, always abounding in the Work of the
Lord; And above all things, to detest and shun that wicked Declaration against
the Covenant, the apparent temptation of the time, and the very mark of
Antichristian Prelacy.

All that I have is but little, but if I had many Worlds, I would lay them all
down, as now I do my life for Christ and His Cause, nothing doubting but the
Lord will abundantly provide for my Wife and my six Children, whom I commit to
the Lord's care, and recommend to the Kindness and Prayers of the faithful; And
do lay an express charge on my Wife that she show all my Children, that I have
bound them all to the Covenant, for which now I lay down my life, and that She
lay it upon them as my last command, that they adhere to every Article thereof.

The Work and People of God are brought very low: It may be, because they were
not ripe for a deliverance; And for the greater trial, and filling up of the
cup of the Adversaries; Or, because there was little, or less prayer then should
have been amongst these who appeared at this time, that the Lord has made this
late breach. But, dear Friends, be not therefore tempted to call in question
the Work of Reformation; or to think the worse of Christ and His Cause, because
of sufferings; Nor be discouraged because these few who took their lives in
their hands, fell before the Adversary; For as sufferings are often sweetened by
the Spirit of God and Glory that rests upon the sufferers, and afterward
bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them that are exercised
thereby; So the Lord will arise in due time, and have mercy upon Zion, and
plead the cause which is his own: And this Testimony, as I am this day to seal
with my blood, so I subscribe with my hand.

JOHN NILSON OF CORSACK.

The Testimony of GEORGE CRAWFORD, Yeoman who died at Edinburgh, December. 14.
1666
Seeing I am to die after this manner, I lay before you this Testimony, which I
avow before God, and leave behind me to the World.

That which moved me to come along with these men, was their persuasion, and my
desire to help them (which with a safe conscience I could not well refuse) who,
being tyrannically oppressed by the Prelates and their dependants and upholders,
and seeing no other way was left to be taken, took up Arms for their own
defense; And if this be Rebellion, I leave it to the great God the supreme
Judge to decern: For in my weak judgment, I found it warrantable from the Word
of God, and without prejudice of the King's Authority (whom I pray God to
direct and guide in the right ways of the Lord, and to make him prosper
therein, so that he may be surely set in his Kingdom, having Him whom no enemy
can resist to defend him) seeing there was nothing intended by us, against his
or any others just and lawful Authority.

But that which was my principal and chief design, was giving my poor
assistance to the rooting out of Prelates and Prelacy, and all such as are come
into God's vineyard without the Master's commission, these Hirelings who came
not in at the true door, Jesus Christ, but have climbed up some other way as
thieves and robbers, whose voice the sheep know not (All which is too sadly
confirmed by the dreadful and horrid sins that are risen in the Land, and the
curses and plagues that have followed thereupon) that so by taking away these,
the abuses which proceed from them, and the sad consequences which follow their
standing falling with them, the Covenant of God might be re-established, and
true Pastors that were silenced might be set at liberty, their mouths opened,
and they themselves put to the keeping of their flocks, and all other such
persons, who were banished, or any other way under suffering, relieved.

And I do adhere to the way of Church Government svvorn to in the Covenant,
which I think and assert to be conform to God's Word; which, with His Spirit
directing, is the only Pattern and judge in all controversies: and hovvever our
endeavors at this time have not been successful, it is of the Lord, who will
come in his own time, for He can do as well with few as with many; but it is
like the cup of the Adversaries is not full: And who knows, but the Lord God
of hosts will hiss for the be of Egypt and the fly of Assyria, who will be
more cruel and blood-thirsty then we were, to avenge the quarrel of His own
People, and to make way for the establishing of His own Cause. I say no more,
but as I was vvilling to hazard my life for this Cause, so I am ready to lay
it down at my Master's feet, seeing He calls for it: And I pray the Almighty, to
send His Spirit of Consolation promised by His Son to His own people, to
strengthen them and bear them through, till the appointed time of the Lord's
coming with Deliverance; for He will come for His own Cause, and for His
peoples sake, and will not tarry.

The last Speech and Testimony of MR HEW MC KAILE. Preacher of the Gospel and
Probationer for the Ministry, at his death in Edinburgh, December. 22. 1666.
BEing by a great surprisal of Providence, thus staged before the World, in a
matter of so universal concernment to all that fear God and desire to be
steadfast in his Covenant, I could not forbear to leave behind me this standing
Testimony, concerning the Occasion and Uses thereof, for the Glory of God, for
the Vindication of my Profession from the aspersions cast thereon by Men, and
the Edification of these by my death, to whom I had devoted my Life in the work
of the Ministry.

I have esteemed the Government of this Church by Presbytery, to be among the
chief of the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, which by his blood he hes purchased,
and ascended up on high to bestovv as a gift upon it; as being the very
Gospell-Ministery in it is Simplicity and Purity from the Inventions of Men, and
so the Mean by which other Ordinances are administered, and the most fundamental
Truths made effectual in the hearts of his People, and therefore that it ought
with that same carefulness to be contended for. Experience both of the having
and wanting of it, has given it this Epistle of Commendation, so as it may be
both known and read of all men: Which is also true of the solemn Engagements
of the Nation thereto, by the National Covenant, and Solemn League and
Covenant, which I have esteemed in their Rise and Renewing, pregnant
performances of that promise, Isaiah. 44.5. where it is evident, that where
Church Reformations come to any maturity, they arrive at this degree of saying
I am the Lords and subscribing with the hand unto the Lord. So was it in the
days of the Reforming Kings of Judah, and after the Restoration from the
Captivity in the days of Nehemiah: This same promise did the Lord Jesus make
Yea and Amen to us, when he redeemed us from spiritual Babylon, which is so
much the greater evidence, that these were the very Motions of Gods Spirit in
our first Reformers, that they were expressly designed against the greatest
motions of the Spirit of Darkness in Antichrist and his supposts, and against
the greatest confirmations that ever these Abominations attained by the decrees
of the Council of Trent, and that bloody Bond called, the Holy League. And
therefore whatever indignity is done unto these Covenants, I do esteem to be
no less then doing despite unto the spirit of Grace in his most eminent
Exerting of himself; but especially Declaring against the same as flowing from
a Spirit of Sedition and Rebellion, to be a Sin of the same nature with theirs,
who ascribed Christ his casting out of Devils to Beelzebub; and that with this
aggravation, that these Scribes and Pharisees came never the length of
prefessing Christ, and submiting themselves to Him and his ways.

Bu^ we are condemned to death upon the account of this Covenant, for adhereing
to the duties therein sworn to, by such as once did as much themselves as we
have done, and some of them more then some of us: Which considerations have
moved me to great fears of Gods wrath against the Land, according to the curse
that we are bound under, if we should break that Covenant, and in the fear of
it many times to pour out my soul before the Lord; and as soon as I heard of a
Party up in Arms in behalf of the Covenant; (all other door being shut,
whereby the redress of the manifest violations of it might be obtained, and
these by manifest and unheard of violence obtruded upon others) to go along
with them, being bound by that Covenant against detestable Indifferency and
Neutrality in this matter, and to esteem every injury done to any engaged in
this Covenant upon account of it, as done to my self: Very Conscience of duty
urged me to this against some reluctance of fear of what might follow. Upon the
same reasons at Lanrik, with the rest I declared my adherence to the Covenant,
by my lifting up of my hand, after the Articles thereof were read.

And here I cannot but with greef of heart acknowledge my fainting in a day of
trial, that being engaged with them upon such accounts, I many times in fear
designed to withdraw, and at length did, which as it was the occasion of my
falling into the hands of the Enemy, so I think among other things it was the
cause why God delivered me into their hands. Upon the same fear, in all my
Examinations I have denied my engagement with them, and endeavored to
Vindicate my self by asserting the real designs I had to part from them, and
have utterly cast away the glory of a testimony, which my very being in their
company as a favourer of the ends of the Covenant, and as one willing to
contribute my best endeavors for the promoving of them, but especially my
declaring for the Covenant, did bear unto the Truth and Ordinances of Jesus
Christ against this untoward Generation: This I confess to be no less then a
denying of Jesus Christ, and a being ashamed of his Words before men; but I
hope the Lord who remembers that we are but frail dust, shall not lay it to my
charg, but according to his faithfulness and Grace will forgive me, who by this
Public Confession, take to my self shame and confusion of face, and fly to the
propitiation offered to all sinners in Jesus Christ. And these things as they
have procured this death unto me, as an act of Gods Justice; so they mind me of
other evils in mine own heart, that have been the source of this my
unwillingness to take on Christ's Cross: My heart has not studied to maintain
that Spirituality in walking with God and Edifying Exemplariness with others,
that became one that had received the first fruits of the Spirit and aimed at
the Ministry of the Gospel, living in times of so much calamity for the Church
of God, and particular afflictions as to my self. If I had spent my days in
groaning after my house from Heaven, would I have shifted so fair an occasion
of being clothed with it? Alas that I have loved my Lord and Master Jesus
Christ so little! Alas that I have done so little service to him, that I have so
little labor to follow Me to my Everlasting rest. This I speak to these
especially, with whom I have familiarly conversed in my Pilgrimage, that seeing
the Lord will not grant me Life to testify my real Reformation of these things,
my aknowledgement at Death may have influence upon them, to study not only
Godliness but the Power of it.

As I acknowledge that I have not been free and ingenuous in these particulars
formentioned, so in other things, wherein I interponed that Holy name of God,
as to the not being upon the Contrivance of this riseing in Arms, nor privy to
any resolution thereanent, nor conscious of any Intelligence at home or abroad
concerning it, I was most ingenuous: And they have wronged me much, who said
that I denied upon Oath, that which they were able to make out against me, or
knew to be truth; But non allege Perjury against me, but such as are so
manifestly guilty of it before the World, that their tougnes in such
alleagances are no slander.

Although I be Judged and condemned as a Rebel amongst Men, Yet I hope even in
order to this Action to be accepted as Loyal before God. Nay there can be no
greater act of Loyalty to the King, as the times now go, then for every man to
do his utmost for the Exstirpation of that abominable plant of Prelacy, which
is the bane of the Throne and of the Country: which if it be not done, the
Throne shall never be established in Righteousness, until these wicked be
removed from before it. Sure I am these who are now comdemned as Rebels
against Him by them, are such as have spent much time in prayer for Him, and do
more sincerely wish his standing, and have endeavored it more by this late
action so much condemned, then the Prelates by condemning them to death.

This Disaster has heightened greatly the Afflictions of our Chuch, and ought
to teach all of you to drink the Wine of Astonishment: Ye have not known
tribulation till now: Now we Judge them happy that are fallen asleep and removed
far away, and know that God has been taking away his Servants from the Evils
that were to come. Know that God's design is to make many hearts contrite,
that have been formerly too whole, and have not lamented sufficiently the
removeall of his Ordinances and Ministry, and the reproach rubed upon the Work
of Reformation. Beware that your sorrow be not a momentany motion of commoun
Compassion, that evanisheth when it may be there is some intermission in this
violent course of sheding innocent blood: Labor to have a constant impression
that may sacrifice the heart, nay ye would live much in apprehension of
approaching Judgment. Certainly the Withdrawing of many from us, and not
contributing their help to the great work, they were engaged to, as well as we,
the general Riseing against us in many places of the Country, but above all
this open sheding of the blood of the Saints, which involveth the land in the
guiltiness of all the righteous blood shed from the foundation of the World,
have made Scotland fit fuel for the fire of Gods Wrath. I can say nothing
concerning times to come, but this, All things shall work together for good to
them that Love God, and so this present dispensation; And they shall have most
comfort in this promise, who are most willing that such afflictions as we are
brought to, be the way that God choiseth to work their good.

Commit wholly the management of all matters to God, and make it your entire
study night and day to keep your very garments clean: It is hard in times of so
general Corruptions not to be defiled one way or other; be free of the Sin as
you would be of the Judgments, which will certainly be such as will make all
the Churches Know, that God is the searcher of the hearts and trier of the
reins, Revel. 2.23. and so will not be mocked by these pretenses whereby, men
color their going along in an evil course, from the real Love that they have
to a present world. If naked Presence amongst them who are esteemed Rebels by
men, be sufficient to engage them in the Crime and Punishment (for that is all
the ground of my Condemnation) shall not God be much more Zealous of his own
glory, against all who so much as seem to go along with this course of
backsliding.

As a good Mean and encouragement, to all the duties of our time, labor to be
rooted and grounded in the Love of Jesus Christ; This will be tender of any
thing that may have the least reflection upon him, His Words or Works, and will
prompt the soul to Zealous appearing for Him at the greatest hazard, and to as
much willingness to die for Him, as to Live that they may Glorify Him. And for
the encouragement of you all in this matter* I do declare, that ever since the
day of my coming into prison, God has kept my soul free from all Amazement
or fear of death; that since my indictment and sentence, God has so manifested
Himself at several times, that he has lifted up my soul above Prelates,
Principalities, and PowerS, Death and Hell, to rejoice and be glad in His
Salvation; and from my soul to account him Worthy, for whom in this his Cause I
should undergo the greatest shame or Pain; And to assured hopes of Eternal
Communion with Him in Heaven: And that nothing has more brangled my peace,
then shifting, an open and free testimony before my Examinators, to the work
that I was engaged in.

I do freely pardon all that have accession to my blood, and wish that it be
not laid to the charg of this sinful Land, but that God would grant Repentance
to our Rulers, that they may obtain the same reconciliation with Him, whereof
I myself do partake. Truly I believe many of them if not instigated by the
cruel Prelates (at whose door our blood does principally lie) would have used
more mitigation: But that reluctance of mind to shed blood, will be so far from
Vindicating of them, that upon the contrary, it will be a witness against them
in the Day of the Lord.

I heartily submit my self to Death, as that which God has appointed to all
men because of Sin, and to this particular way of it, as deserved by my
particular Sins. I praise God for this Fatherly chastisement, whereby he has
made me in part and will make me perfectly partaker of his Holiness. I glorify
Him that called me forth to suffer for His Name and Ordinances, and the solemn
engagements of the Land to Him, and that he has taken this way to take me away
from the evil to come. The Lord bless all His Poor Afflicted groaning People
that are behind.

Hereafter I will not talk with flesh and blood, nor think on the Worlds
consolations: Farewell all my Friends whose company has been refreshful to me
in my Pilgrimage; I have done with the Light of the Sun and Moon, Welcome
Eternal Life, Everlasting Love, Everlasting Praise, Everlasting Glory. Praise
to Him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever. Though I have not
been so with Thee as I ought to have been in the House of my Pilgrimage, yet
thou have made with me an Everlasting Covenant, Ordered in all things and Sure.
And this is all my Salvation, and all my desire. Bless the Lord O my Soul! that
has pardoned all my Iniquities in the Blood of His Son, and healed all my
Deseases. Bless Him O all ye his Angels that excel in strength, ye Ministers
that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord O my Soul! Halelujah.

Edinburgh Tolbooth, December 22. 1666. Sic subscribitur HEW Mc KAIL.
I have heard that some of the Prisoners are willing to save their lives by
taking the Declaration, That is, by abjuring that Work and Cause for which they
adventured their Lives: Which if they do, our blood shall bear witness against
them in the great Day of God. And God shall so punish some of them in this
Life, that they shall curse the day that ever they shifted to die on a scaffold.

HEW Mc KAIL.



The Testimony of JOHN WODROW, Merchant in Glasgow, who died in Edinburgh,
December. 22. 1666.
Dear Friends.
I Am condemned to die I shall say little concerning men who have judged and
condemned me, they are to answer to God for it; But I bless the Lord, who has
counted me worthy to die for so good and honorable a cause. And that I be not
mistaken after I am gone hence, I have thought fit to testify that in
singleness and sincerity of heart, I came into the service, not constrained but
from conscience of my being engaged by Covenant to God, and with a full purpose
to perform my vows made in that Covenant unto the Lord, in the strength of
Jesus Christ; And that I might endeavor to restore again the precious
Ordinances to their former purity and power, and to recover the fair Church in
this Land (which our blessed Lord has purchased to Himself, and bought at so
dear a rate) to her former Beauty, which is now defaced: And particularly to
bring down that Antichristian Prelacy, and that perjured crew of Prelates, who
have so perfidiously wronged the Interests of our blessed Lord and Master,
Jesus Christ. This is the only Cause for which I undertook this service, and
joined with others my dear and Covenanted brethren; And that I had no intention
to wrong the King's person or Authority, but to seek his real good, according
to my duty in the Word of God, and also as I swear in the same Covenant wherein
I did swear against Prelacy. And notwithstanding I be condemned of men as a
Rebel, yet I am justified of God, my God and Father, in and through my Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, who gives me sweet peace of conscience and joy of heart;
I grant it is not enough to justify me before Him, that I had a just Cause,
unless likewise I had therewith the acceptance of my person through Faith in
the Merits of Jesus Christ, who stands in our nature in heaven, which I dare
declare this day as a dying man, that I have obtained; for I am confident that
through His righteousness made over unto me, He has made me free, in which I
shall stand for ever; and that within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as
I am seen of Him; and behold and wonder, and wonder and behold for evermore
that most glorious excellency of His. And this yields to me great consolation
in all my extremities, were they never so great; This I say is my peace and
consolation this day, even Christ my Righteousness, who has both accepted my
Person and Cause: Therefore I count it a small thing to be judged and condemned
of men, for my Testimony is on high, and my record in heaven.

And now, my Friends, I am condemned to die for adhering to my Covenant made
with God, for Reformation of Religion and Conversation, to which all ranks of
the Land are as well bound as I, though many (alas! too many) shaking off all
fear of God have despised the Oath, not only by breaking the Covenant, but by
professing and declaring avowedly the bond thereof null, and not binding either
to their own or other men's consciences: And this mischief is framed by a Law,
which does greatly highten the Sin; O! tell it not in Oath, and publish it not
in Askelon. Oh! that this should be heard of amongst Papists and Pagans, that
professed Reformed Protestants should stand in so little aw of a solemn Oath,
and Name of the great and living God.

But I exhort and obtest you all, that so much the more as others have made
void His Covenant, you would esteem it the more precious, and closely follow
the Reformation vowed, in every Article thereof, upon all occasions given you
of the Lord; And that you abhor, detest and refuse any engagement whatsoever,
that may wrong your Oath in the Covenant directly or indirectly, as ye would
escape the wrath of God that is coming on such breaking of Covenant, but rather
choice the greatest extremity of affliction, then the least sin of this sort;
as Moses did, who refused to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter, but
chused rather to suffer reproach for Christ; And be not afraid of suffering for
Christ, as though it were an evil thing, neither scar ye at His cross, for the
Lord Himself says, My yoke is easy and My burden light; Yea it is lighter to
us then to many that stand by: Believe; Faith makes all burdens light to the
believing Sufferer.

And now I beseech you believers in Christ, abide in Him and bring forth fruit
unto Holiness, and study tenderness in all manner of conversation, and holiness
without which no man shall see the Lord; And let not this profane and mocking
Generation have any thing to reproach you with, but that whereof you would not
be ashamed, that when you suffer ye may not suffer as evil doers, that whereas
they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
conversation in Christ. It is not knowledge nor a bare Profession that
glorifieth God, but Tenderness, Holiness and Righteousness, that do commend
Religion and His Cause to all men, and shall convince your Adversaries of their
Wickedness in wronging you, and make them the more inexcusable in that day when
they shall be judged: Yea, what know ye, but ye may win others by your tender
and good conversation?

I recommend to you, that ye would be much and fervent in the use of that
precious duty of Prayer, wherein most near Communion with God upon earth is to
be found: Be much in prayer, with and for others- Forsake not the assembling of
your selves together as the manner of some is (I wish they may see the evil of
it who neglect it) but exhort one another, and so much the more, as ye see the
day approaching: Earnestness and diligence will hasten the Lord's coming with
relief unto you, and to the Lords born-down Work; and your slackness in this,
may make the wheels of His chariot to move the more slowly. For the effectual
fervent prayer of the righteous avails much with God; It will do more then
Armies of men and weapons of War for your defense and deliverance.

I beseech you also, my dear Friends, that you acquaint yourselves with the
Word of God in the Holy Scripture, that ye may have acquaintance with Jesus
Christ who is clearly set forth therein; that ye may know Him in His excellency
and come to love and believe in Him whom ye know; that ye may be acquainted
with His revealed will therein, and may know what is truth, and cleave fast
thereto, from a sure persuasion that it has the warrant of His Word; and may
be guarded against every error of the wicked, and that ye may fully know what
is good and what is evil; And that ye may suffer with confidence, when ye are
brought forth thereto as I am.

Finally, my dear Friends, be ye perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind,
live in peace- and the God of love and peace shall be with you.

JOHN WODROW.

The Copy of JOHN WODROW His Letter to His Wife, dated December. 22. 1666. which
was the Day on which He suffered.
My Heart,
REverence the good Providence of the Lord our God, who can do nothing wrong;
For whatsoever He does is well-done, and my Soul faith, Amen. I had not a will
of my own (my Heart) since that day wherein You and I parted, My Lord and my
God captivated it, and brought it to a submission unto His will: I bless Him
for evermore for it, that I was never left to my own will: Praise, O praise Him
all ye living! And O thou my soul praise the Lord for it. I bless the Lord for
evermore that ever He visited my Fathers Family, that ever He condescended to
come unto my Fathers Family, and to give a visit to the like of me: He visited
me there, and set his Love upon me, and has chosen me for this very end, to be
a witness for his covenanted Reformation. For this my Soul is glad, and my
Glory rejoices for this Honor wherewith He has honored me; And that, though
I be condemned to die by men on earth, yet am I justified of God through the
blood of my Savior Jesus Christ, who stands in our nature in Heaven, and
has made me free through his imputed Righteousness made over unto me, in which
I stand for ever; And within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as I am seen
of Him, and behold and wonder, and wonder and behold for evermore, even that
most glorious excellency which is in Him. All that which is spoken of Him is
but little: O my Heart, my dear Love, come and see I beseech you! I thought I
had known something of my dearest Lord before, that I had some love from and to
Him before, But never was it so with me, as it has been with me since I came
within the doors of this Prison; many a precious visit has his gracious
Majesty given unto me. He is without all comparison; O love, love Him! 0 come
to Him, O taste and see, and that shall resolve the question best. The thing I
suffer for is the Covenanted Reformation. I bless God, and all that is within
me does bless and magnify His Holy Name for this, tnat Scotland did ever enter
into a Covenant with the Lord, into a sworn Covenant, with the hand lifted up
to the Lord: And I have now sworn and renewed this Covenant again for my self
and you, and my four Children in all the parts and points thereof; And I pray,
God help you to abide in the Covenant for ever.

And now I give you and my four Children unto the Lord, and commit you to Him
as your Covenanted God and Husband, and my Childrens Covenanted Father. I say
no more, but either study to be indeed a sincere Christian, and a seeker of His
face in sincerity, or else you will be nothing at all. I recommend you and your
young-ones to Him, who is God All-sufficient, and abounds in Mercy and Love
to them that Love Him and keep his Covenant. The blessing of the Covenant be
upon you, so fare you well. So says

Your loving and dying Husband JOHN WODROW.

The Testimony of RALPH SHIELDS, An Englishman who died in Edinburgh, December.
22. 1666.
My Friends.
I Am come here to die, and I thank God, it is not for evil doing that I now
suffer: although I be charged with Rebellion against the Kings Authority, yet 1
declare before God and you all, that in all this matter I never intended to
wrong his Majesty's just Power and greatness, but for conscience sake did
respect Authority as the Ordinance of God appointed for the punishment of evil
doers, and that I wish his Ma: all welfare both in this life, and the world to
come, and that it may be his happiness to consider his Obligations to God and
Perform the same, that so it may be well with him and his Posterity to many
generations; and I pray God make him a friend to His Cause and the truly Godly
who own the same, though falsely called Phanaticks or turbulent persons.

I declare I have such persuasion of the Interest of Religion Reformed, and
sworn unto in the Covenant that I dare venture not only to lay down my own
life, but if every hair of my head were a man, they should all be put to
venture for this cause: I would not have the world to stumble at the Cause,
because of my death after this manner; for I rejoice greatly in it, and I
desire every good Christian as they tender their own souls that they would grip
fast, lay hold on, and cleave to Jesus Christ and His way.

My coming out at this time (I say) was not against his Majesty, but for the
Covenant which is now trodden under foot; my intention was for the Cause of
Christ; I take God to witness, it was nothing else I came out for, and for that
I am free to lay down my life.

I bless God I am much encouraged in this, and not at all afraid to die for so
good and clear a Cause; and I hope He will bring me through all my difficulties
in this dark shadow of death: I hope I have the peace of a good conscience, and
have had some glimpses from Jesus Christ of His countenance and reconciled
Face, since I came into this prison, for which I desire to bless His Name with
all my soul, heart and spirit. And I rejoice that He hes made use of me to
suffer for His Cause; And I think it too little, not only to lay down my body,
but (if it were possible) even my very soul at the stake for that Cause and for
Jesus Christ my good and kind Master, who has loved me and given Himself for
me. I give the Lord thanks that I had some of His Presence since I came into
this condition: and again I say, I am much encouraged and not afraid to die,
and bless Him that I die not as a murderer, or evil door, or Rebel to
Authority, but for such a cause as this.

O that it were the happiness of my Nation of England, once to subject
themselves unto the sweet yoke of Christ's Reformed Government, under which this
Nation of Scotland has enjoyed so much of the Power and life of the Gospel, by
a faithful Ministry according to the Covenant sworn by them both.

And now, my dear Friends in Christ, and fellow-Covenanters, though I be a
stranger in this Land, being an Englishman, but trifted by providence in the
prosecution of my calling, to have my residence for a time here in Scotland,
which I look upon, as a singular evidence of God's special love to me, though
I be a stranger, I say, to many of you, yet I must be bold as a dying friend,
to beseech you by the mercy of God, and by your appearance before Jesus Christ,
when we shall have to do with none but Him as our Judge, that ye be faithful
and steadfast in the Cause of God, and Covenant which ye have sworn with hands
lifted up to the most high God, which no Power on earth can loose you from, and
that ye keep you from snares unto the contrary, and not suffer your selves to
fall into a detestable Neutrality and Indifferency in that Cause of God; And
especially that ye keep your selves free of any Engagements by word or write,
that may wrong your Oath of the Covenant. I commit my Wife and Children to His
care, who cares for them that put their trust in Him before the Sons of men,
not doubting but they shall be eyed with goodwil and favor by the Godly, after
I am gone. And now I render up my Spirit to Him who gave it me, and for whose
sake I now lay down my life. To this God, my Covenanted God, be glory, blessing
and praise for now and ever, Amen.

That this is my mind and Testimony, which I leave behind me, I witness by my
ordinary subscription,

R. SHIELDS.

The Testimony of HUMPREY COLHOUNE, At his Death in Edinburgh, December. 22. 1666.
Dear Friends and Spectators,
I am come here this Day to this Place to die this Death, for crimes for which
(I thank God) my Conscience does not condemn me. My crime, as is alleged, is
for Disloyalty against the King's Majesty; Yet I thank God, that my appearing
lately with the Lord's People was from my sense of my obligation in the
Covenant, and the sense of the wrongs done in the Land, and the crying
oppressions committed therein. This was the end of my appearing for the Lord
against His enemies, to bear witness against the same: The which obligation of
the Oath of God, I judge that none on earth can loose the Conscience from. I
bless the Lord again and again, I die for this Oath and Covenant; And I thank
God also, that I have by the great mercy of the Almighty God in Christ Jesus,
obtained mercy and forgiveness for all my transgressions both against the first
and second Table of the Law: And that through that Ocean of grace which is in
the Lord Jesus Christ, I believe that I am justified and sanctified, and
believe now to be glorified with Him, by that blessed blood of His, which has
purchased this Salvation to me, through faith in the same, made application of,
according to the good Covenant of grace. He has performed this, out of his
vvonderfull and incomparable free grace* And this is my joy and exceeding great
rejoicing and consolation, and all my salvation, for which I am Grace's debtor
throughout all Eternity. I die with this my Testimony, my adherence to the
National Covenant, to the Solemn League and Covenant, to the Work of
Reformation a great length carried on, and now overthrown most sinfully by
ungodly Men, who have established their Apostasy by Law, which no just Power
on earth could ever do. Also I adhere to the Presbyterial Government, the
Confession of Faith, Cathechisms Larger and Shorter, And to the Solemn
Acknowledgement of the Church of Scotland, And Public Testimonies thereof
against the sins of the time. This day I rejoice that He has counted me
worthy to lay down my life for Him, as one that bears vvitness against the
breach of all the Sacred Oaths and Ties that were established in this Land, yea
by the just Laws both of God and Man, which never could have been repealed
lawfully, as this wicked Generation has done.

Dear Friends, I hope ye will stand fast in this Obligation, and in the Solemn
Oaths and Ties ye are under, and all the body of the Land also will be steadfast
in the same, upon the greatest hazard ye can meet with; And that ye will study
perfect holiness and nearness with God, which will help to keep you straight in
this day of Persecution and sharp Trial that is now raging in this Land: I
bless the Lord, I die not a fool, though some men have thought so of me by
their speeches to me, since my imprisonment: neither durst I ever be the man to
buy my liberty at such a dear rate as Perjury, and to shake off these blessed
bonds I did willingly come under; And I thank God, I never yet to this moment
rued or repented it; And sure I am it is better for me to suffer the vvorst of
deaths, then to preserve my life by breaking the Oaths of God. I also give my
Testimony against Prelacy and that wicked Hierarchy now established in this
Land, as that which the Church of Christ could never bear until this day, it
being such a grand Enemy to the purity of the Gospel, and power of Godliness,
yea a yoke which the Church of God groaneth under. I have no more to say, but
commends all you the lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ to God Himself, and to the
good word of His grace, which is able to build you up until the day of His
appearance, and to give you all an inheritance with them that are sanctified
through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And subscribes my self an expectant and
apparent heir of the grace of Christ.

HUMPREY COLHOUN.

The Testimony of JOHN WILSON, Who suffered at Edinburgh, December. 22. 1666.
Good People and Spectators.
I Am here condemned to die upon alleged Rebellion against the King and his
Authority, which God knows, I never intended. For in my judgment, a man's
endeavoring to extirpate perjured Prelates and abjured Prelacy, according as
he is bound by Oath in a sworn Covenant, may very well stand with a man's
Loyalty to King and Country; for I am sure, the King and his Subjects may be
happy, yea more happy in the extirpation of Prelates and Prelacy, then in their
standing; Yea the Throne shall never be established in peace, until that wicked
plant be plucked up by the roots, which has so much wasted and made desolate
the Lord's Vineyard: For my part, I pray that the Lord may bless our King with
blessings from Heaven, and make him a friend to the Interests of Christ, as the
best way for the standing of his Throne to many generations; And I pray for all
that are in Authority under his Majesty, that the Lord may not lay to their
charge the innocent blood of His Saints, which they have shed. But the ground
of my sentence is truly, the renewing of the Covenant with my God, and
laboring to defend the same, according to my Oath: And this I profess is and
was my duty, and by the grace of God will not quite it; And in token hereof, I
am here before you all to lay down my life in defense of the same, and require
you all to be witnesses to this my Testimony; I do declare, I am not ashamed,
but count it my glory. I do likewise declare this before you all in the sight
of God, the Judge of all hearts, that since the day I did first swear and
subscribe this Covenant for Reformation, it has been sweet unto me, for I am
persuaded in my Conscience of the warrantableness thereof. I did swear the
Covenant four times, and the last time at Lanerk, which was the sweetest time
to me of them all; For with my whole soul I renewed it, and gave up both my
soul and body to Him, to be at His disposal, which, I trust in God, I shall
never rue. Hearty praise and thanks be to the blessed God, that ever it pleased
Him to give unto this poor Church that mercy to enter in Covenant with Himself,
that He might be unto us a Covenanted God, the richest mercy that can be
bestowed on men. I have lived a Presbyterian in my judgment, according as I
have sworn, and judge it to be the only way that God has appointed in His
word, for the Government of His Church on earth; for under that Government the
power and practice of Religion has greatly flourished, and many a soul hes
been converted to the Lord, and found sweet fellowship with Him in His
Ordinances, by the Ministry of His honest and and lawfully called Servants. And
blessed be the day that ever I heard a faithful sent Minister preach the
Gospel. I do declare before heaven and earth that my whole design in this
Rising in Arms, was only against abjured Prelacy and Prelaetes, the great
Oppressors of God's Interests, and cruel persecuters of His People, both in
their consciences and bodies; and I judge their Government and why not to be
conform to the Word of God in the Holy Scriptures. I might cite many
Scriptures to this purpose, but I shall only name two Luke 22.26. but ye shall
not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and be
that is chief, as he that does serve. And 1 Pet. 5.3. neither as being Lords
over God's heritage, etc. Yea it may be seen from sad experience, that under
their Government, the power of Godliness has decayed, and avowed profanity and
Popery it self has increased, both to the dishonor of the holy Lord, and the
great grief of the hearts of the Godly. I am so persuaded of tne truth of the
Covenant, and of the error of their way, and that Jesus Christ is the only King
and Lord over His own House, and besides Him there is none else, for He will
not give His glory to another, I am so persuaded of these things, that I dare
seal the truth thereof with my blood, and am come hither for the same end,
without any fear or amazement; yea if every hair of mine head were a man, I
would have ventured all according to the Covenant which I made with my God; And
although I be a poor polluted sinner, and my house not so with God, as it
became; yet has He made with me an everlasting Covenant, well ordered in all
things and sure, and this is all my Salvation and all my desire; And I hope the
Lord will soon tread down all His enemies with shame, and the enemies of His
Covenant also. Therefore, let all that love the Lord Jesus Christ and His Truth
and Covenant, take comfort and courage, notwithstanding of all that which is
come to pass, And let them not be ashamed to adhere thereunto, whatsoever
sufferings they meet with therein, for He will make up that loss in Himself,
and avenge the wrongs done to Himself and them in His own due time: I assure
you, Christ is a good Master to serve: if ye knew Him rightly and His cross, it
is sweet and easy to the believer; for He makes death to be life, and brings
light out of darkness. I desire to follow the blessed Captain of my salvation
through well and woe. I beseech you, my dear Friends, whom now I am to part
with, that ye stand to the defense of all the truths of God and of His Word;
and that ye receive the Lord Christ, as He has offered Himself therein, ye who
have not closed with Him; And that he who has closed with Him, abide in Him by
a lively faith and love, bringing forth fruits, that you may put credit on your
profession, and keep off every thing that may shame your glorious and blessed
Master before this evil and adulterous generation. And I give you all warning
and de^ort you heartily as ye love your own souls, and as ye will answer to
Him, who shall judge the quick and dead, that ye stand fast in all the duties
ye are sworn unto in the National and in the Solemn League and Covenant, both
toward God, your King and one another: And that ye beware of snares in taking
of any Oaths or Declarations contrary in the least, to the Oath of God in these
Covenants. I leave my wife and little children upon Jesus Christ my Lord, who
are now to be made a widow and fatherless for His sake, trusting, He will care
for them; And I recommend them to the counsel and kindness of His people under
Him. I can forgive the wrong done to me in taking away my life for this Cause,
and wish God to be merciful to these that have condemned me, or have had any
hand in my death: But blessed be God, that brought and has kept me on His side
of this Cause, and honored me to be a public witness for Him and His blessed
Truth; and Cause; for which I shall praise Him in the World to come, whether I
now go: yea I will praise Him on the borders of Death and Eternity. To His
blessed Name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be praise for now and ever. So says
your dying friend for Christ.

JOHN WILSON.

A true Relation of the Sufferings and Death of MR HEW Mc KAIL. Preacher of the
Gospel.
MR Hew Mc Kail having passed, and improven the virtuous means of his Education
(at the University of Edinburgh, and with his Uncle Mr Hew Mc Kail, Minister
there, in whose family he did reside) to the satisfaction and good hope of all,
in the Winter 1661. upon the very turn of this sad Catastrophe, offers himself
to Trial (being 20 years old) before the Presbytery of Edinburgh, in order to
the work of the Ministry; and being by them amply approven and licensed, and
having preached at several times with the great benefit and applause of all his
hearers, he did preach his last public Sermon in Edinburgh, in the Great
Church thereof, upon the Sabbath immediately preceding that 8 of September
1662. the day affixed by the then Parliament, for the removal of the Ministers
of Edinburgh.

His text was Song. 1.7. In this Sermon taking occasion to speak of the great
and many persecutions, to which the Church of God has been and is obnoxious;
and amplifying the Point from the Persons and Powers who have been instrumental
therein, he said, that the Church and People of God had been persecuted, both
by a Pharaoh upon the Throne, a Haman in the State, and a Judas in the Church;
and falling to enlarge the several ways and manner of the Persecutions of
these men, and the issue thereof; the cases of Haman and Judas appeared in the
conviction of his Adversaries, to have such a near resemblance to the state and
condition of the then Rulers of State and Church, that though he did make no
Application, yet he was reputed to be guilty thereof.

Whereupon, within a few days thereafter, there was a Party of Horsemen sent
to the Place where he then lived near to Edinburgh, for to seize his Person and
make him Prisoner. But upon almost no more then a moments advertisement, he
escapes out of his bed, and shifting only to another chamber, was miraculously
preserved from the Search then used, though most diligent and accurate. For
this cause, he being necessitated to leave that Place, retired home-ward to his
Fathers house, where having lurked a while, and thereafter as occasions called
him spent the four years that have since interveen'd, in several places and
with much uncertainty. Yet during all this space, to the certain knowledge and
sweet remembrance of all that conversed with him, he was most seriously
exercised in the Study of Piety and true Knowledge, wherein as he greatly
advanced above all his equals, so at length he became most eminent and
exemplary.

While he is thus living and employed at his Fathers house, the late Troubles
arising: in the West fall out; and the news thereof having alarmed him with
the rest of that Country, upon the 18. of Nov. last, being the Sabbath; for
such motives and upon such considerations as he himself does fully afterward
declare, he joined himself to those who rose in these parts for the assisting
of that poor afflicted Party, as in their consciences, by their Covenant, they
thought themselves indispensably obliged.

When and where he joined with them, or what was his part, or endeavors
amongst them, needs not to be remembered. Only this is certain, that being of a
thin body, and tender constitution, he was so disabled and weakened with the
toil and fatigue of continual marching and tempestuous weather (particularly at
Air, where he lay a considerable time, as if he had been dead, by reason of
fainting) that he could no longer endure it. Whereupon, on Tuesday November. 27.
he was necessitated to part from them in the morning, near to the New Bridge
upon Cramond water: And in his way toward Libberton Parish, about twelve of
the clock passing through Bread's Craigs, he was taken, without resistance,
having only a small ordinary sword, by such of the Countrymen, as were then
sent out to view the fields; in which passage it is very observable, that his
escape formerly mentioned was not more miraculous, then his present taking was
fatal: for it is without question, had he but retained and observed the least
of that advertency and caution, wherein at other times he was known to be both
ready and very happy, he might, without either hazard or trouble, have escaped
this inconvenience; but God who gave him the full experience of his turning all
things unto the good of them that love Him, did thus by his simplicity and
folly, prepare the way for His own Glory and His servants joy and Victory.

Being brought to Edinburgh, and first to the Towns Council-house, in their
search for letters he was immediately stripped; and there being none found,
committed prisoner to the Tolbuith.

Upon the Wedensday, being the 28 of November by order from the Secret Council,
he was brought before the Earl of Dumfreis, Lord Sinclar, Sir Robert. Manray
of Preist-field and others, in order to his Examination; and being interrogate
concerning his joining and being with the Wesi-land forces, he conceaving
himself not obliged by any Law or Reason, to be his own Accuser, to the
destruction of his life, did plainly deny the question; but being desired to
sign with his hand, what he had said and they caused write, though at first he
appeared willing, yet partly being advised by the Lord Sinclar, to beware that
he subscribed nothing, whereof the contrary would be found true, left it might
therefore fare the worse with him, and partly scrupling at the terms of Rebels
and Rebellion, wherein the question and his Answer were conceaved, and partly
bethinking that a simple denial may import more then the pleading of
Not-guilty, he refused to subscribe his name, which being reported to the
Council gave great offense, and brought him under the suspicion of a deep
dissembler.

On Thursday November. 29. being again called before his Examinators, upon the
considerations mentioned, and for allaying the Councils prejudice, and
preventing the inconvenience he might there-through sustain, he gives in a
Declaration under his own hand, testifying, that he had been with the Westland
Forces, with whom he occasionally met, and that he resolved to have withdrawn
from them upon the first opportunity which he was also about to do when he was
taken, without either offering to flee or resist, which he desired the Council
the rather to believe, because he had told so much to William Lawry of
Blackwood, a person employed from the Lieut. General Dalzell to the Westland
Forces. But notwithstanding that William Lawry did testify this to be a truth,
yet the Council retaining former impressions, and apprehending that the
presence and confronting of some other Prisoners of the Westland Forces (who
plainly declared their accession to that Rising) and their deponing concerning
him, did only move Mr Hew to this acknowledgement, although it be certainly
known, that he had formed and subscribed the same the night before, they
fortify and persist in their jealousy, and suspecting him to have been a
contriver of the Insurrection, and privy to all Designs and Intelligence
relating to it, they dealt with him with great importunity to be ingenuous, and
to declare who were the Ringleaders of the late Rising, and what
correspondence either at home or abroad was kept anent it: And this was done
especially upon the Monday Dec. 3. at which time also the Boots (a terrible
instrument of Torture, which the humanity of our later times has so much
abhorred, that not only the fashion of them was forgot, but all Torture for
their cause, disused; yet new ones such as they are) were laid before him, upon
the Town Council-House table, and he certifyed, that if he would not confess,
he should be tortured by them to morrow. And accordingly upon Tuesday Dec. 4.
he was again called before the Council, where, after the Examination and
Torture of John Nilson of Corsack, he was again examined by the Earl of
Rothess the Kings Commissioner, the Marquess of Montress, and several of the
Privy Council, (in the Town Council-House) the Bishop of St Andrews for the
honor of his profession forsooth, and some others of the Counselors upon more
real and Christian motives, having at first withdrawn themselves: And being
urged to confess, he declared, with a solemn Attestation, that he knew no more,
then he had already confessed, whereupon they ordered the Executioner to put
his leg into the Boot and to proceed to the Torture. But as he had before
confessed and declared ingenuously all he knew, so this Torture (though in it
self very violent and painful, by the extraordinary compression both of flesh,
sinews and bones, by the force of timber wedges and hammer, and used upon him
in a double measure, even to ten or eleven strokes, with considerable
intervals; as there remained no truth concealed which it could extort) did not
in the least move him to express any impatience or bitterness, but having
sustained it most constantly and Christianly, before he got the last three
strokes, he protested solemnly in the sight of God, that he could say no more,
though all the joints of his body were in as great torture as that poor leg,
and desires to know what could hinder them to believe one of his Profession,
who had so solemnly declared as in the sight of God, that he knew no more then
he had told, viz. that to the best of his knowledge, the Rising in the West was
merely occasional, upon a discontent betwixt the people in the Stewarty of
Galloway and Sir James Turner, to which every one did run, as their hearts
moved them when they heard of it.

This Torture was the cause why he was not indicted with the first ten, who
being arraigned and sentenced on Wedensday Dec. 5. were hanged on the Friday
thereafter, at the Cross of Edinburgh. Many thought that considering his small
accession unto that Rising, which neither was nor could be proven to be more,
then what he himself had freely confessed, and that he had suffered such hard
measure by Torture, and that not in order to the discovery of his own Crime,
but the declaring of the Contrivers and his Accomplices, that the same should
have procured him favor, but the matter was otherwise determined. Neither was
the Sermon before mentioned, so quite forgotten, though ill remembered, and
often repeated in Council in these words Achab upon the Throne, and no more,
and therefore

Upon Monday the 10 of Dec. he and other seven received their Indictments of
Treason, and were acordingly summoned to appear before the Justices on
Wedensday Dec. 12. But his Torture and close Imprisonment thereafter (for so it
was ordered) having cast him in a Fever; whereby he was utterly disenabled to
make his appearance,

Upon Tuesday Dec. 11. he gave in to the Lords of Council his Supplication of
the Tenor following viz. that whereas I have received an Indictment of Treason,
which was yesterday delivered to me, and I appointed to make answer thereto to
morrow, and seeing in this matter of the highest importance, not only all the
time allowed is very short, but I am and have been ever since my Torture in a
great distemper and Fever, besides the great pain and utter inability of my
leg, which has constantly kept me bed-fast, and does render me incapable not
only of minding my own Defense, but wholly unable either to walk or stand, far
less to go and compeir before the Lord Justice, as I doubt not but Physicians
will testify, if your Lo: will order them to visit me, which I humbly beg; And
seeing my accession to the Crimes libelled is so very slender, being only simple
Presence, and that not only occasional, as I did declare before Your Lo: but
also in some sort retracted and purged, by my purposed and actual off-coming
and deserting; and lastly, seeing I was put to sore Torture, in order to a
further discovery, with a promise of favor, in case of my Ingenuity, which I
then singly used, as in the sight of God, to the utmost of my knowledge: May it
therefore please Your Lordships, graciously to consider the Premises, specially
my utter inability to make my appearance, and to surcease any legal procedor
against me, in this so weak and extreme condition, and to discharge me of the
foresaid Citation and Appearance. And your Lo: answer.

This Petition and the following are therefore set down verbatim, that both
the utmost of his condescendence may appear, and the fainting that he so much
regrates in his last Speech, be the better understood. And with the same
subscribed by him, there was given in, an Attestation under the hands of seven
Surgeons, declaring his weak and sickly condition.

Hereupon the Council did order two Physicians, and two Surgeons ( viz. Sir
Robert Cuningham, Doctor Hay, James ^o^t^wick, and Thomas Kinkead.) to visit
him, and to return their Attestation upon soul and conscience, betwixt and the
morrow at ten of the Clock, to the Justices.

Upon Wedensday December. 12. the Justices being set, the Attestation of the two
Doctors and Surgeons above mentioned, is produced for Mr Hew Mc Kail, and
other three of the Prisoners indicted, and their excuse proponed thereupon. But
the Justice finding, that the Attestation, not bearing soul and conscience, did
not agree to the Warrant and Order given by the Council, and that the
Physicians being called, did refuse upon point of Privilege to rectify it in
these terms, although they declared, that the truth thereof was such, as they
might safely confirm it by Oath, they do only supersede their procedor against
M. Hew, and other two contained in the Attestation, until to morrow, and
ordain John Nilson of Corsack, though also contained in the Attestation, in
respect the same as to his part, was not relevant, and the other four, to be
brought to the Bar, who accordingly being brought, were that day sentenced to
be hanged on Friday thereafter.

Thursday December 13. the Iustice-Court being set, adjourns until Tuesday
thereafter, and ordains M. Hew and the other two to be peremptorily sisted that
day before the down-sitting of the Court. This afternoon, having obtained his
Reprivall, in the thoughts of his dubious condition, he composed the lines
following. Vitae ergo innumeris curarum erroribus actae,
Clausula consimilis perbreve finit iter.
Distrahor ambigui dubio discrimine fati:
Aeger enim jaceo; sin revalesco, cado.
Saturnday Dec. 8. his Brother M. Matthew goes from Edinburgh to Glasgow, with
a Letter from the Lady Marquess of Dowglass, and another from the Duchess of
Hamilton to the Lord Commissioner in his favors, but both proved ineffectual.

Like-as his Cusing M. Matthew Mc Kail carried another Letter from the Lady
Marquess of Dowglass to the Archbishop of St Andrews for the same purpose, but
with no better success.

Dec. 18. Sitting in Judgment, the Lord Penton Justice Clerk, and Mr William
Murray (Advocate) Justice Depute.

M. Hew being indifferently recovered, he was brought before the Justice with
other 3 that were arraigned with him. And first, the general Indictment is
read, founded both on old and late Acts of Parliaments, made against Rising and
Assembling in Arms, and entering into Leagues and Covenants, and renewing the
Solemn League and Covenant, without or against the Kings Authority, declaring
the same to be Rebellion and Treason; and thereafter amply subsuming upon all
the Acts, Deeds and Passages of the late Insurrection with many aggravations;
particularly upon their taking and renewing the Solemn League and Covenant at
Lanerk; And therefore charging them with, and concluding, that they ought to be
punished for the same as Traitors. After which Mr Hew his special Indictment is
read, bearing, that he had risen and joined with the Rebels, and was with them
at Air, Vchilery and Lanerk, and several other places on horsback, and had kept
and was at several of their Rendevouz's with a Sword. Whereunto Mr Hew being
permitted to answer, began his discourse very constantly and composedly,
declaring, that he looked upon himself, both from the conclusion of his
Indictment, and what had happened to others, as a man appointed by men, and
determined in himself to die, whereupon he thought himself obliged to use the
greater ingenuity, and then affirmed, that he was not ashamed to avow that he
was one of that afflicted and persecuted party and persuasion called
Presbyterian. Thereafter he proceeded to speak of the Ties and Engagements that
were upon the Land to God, in order thereto, and having commended the
Institution. Dignity and Blessing of Presbyterial Government, he said that the
last words of the National Covenant had always great weight upon his spirit.
Whereupon the King's Advocate, interrupting him, desired him to forbear that
discourse, telling him that he was not there called in question for his
persuasion, but for the crime of Rebellion, in rising in Arms against his Ma:
Authority, to which he desired him to answer; whereunto he answered, that the
thing which moved him to declare himself as he had, and would have done, was
that weighty and important saying of our Lord Jesus, Whosoever shall confess me
before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the Angels of God; but
he that denies me and my words before men, shall he denied before the Angels
of God. As for the Rebellion he was charged with, he said; his Accession was
only simple presence with a Sword, and that occasional, as his confession
before the Council did bear. The Advocate answers, that not only presence, such
as he was charged with, was treasonable, but all intercommuning or keeping
company with Rebels, though for the space only of half an hour; and however,
he said, he was guilty of a far deeper accession, and of many other things
besides these contained in his own confession; whereupon the Advocate caused
read his Confession, and also the depositions of several others that were
examined, in so far as they concerned him. M. Hew answered, that all the
depositions read, contained no more then was in his own Confession, nor could
they make out any more against him; and so in effect it was.

The Advocate after the sustaining of the Indictment, having made use of; and
caused read the confessions of M. Hew and the other persons accused before the
Assize, in place of Probation, referred the matter to their Cognition.

The Assize being enclosed gave their Verdict una voce, and by the mouth of Sir
William Murray of Newtown their Chancellor, report him to be guilty of being
with the Rebels at several times and places, and at their Rendevouz with a
Sword, according to his subscribed confession. However it was thereafter
understood, that four or five of the Assize, did with reluctance pronounce this
Verdict^* thinking death too great a punishment for so slender a Guilt, and
that the major part of the Assize had cleansed him, if the fear of an Assize of
Error had not prevailed with them.

The Verdict being reported, Doom was pronounced, decerning and adjudging him
and the rest to be taken on Saturnday December. 22. to the Mercate Cross of
Edinburgh, and there to be hanged on a Gibbet till they be dead, and that their
Goods and Lands be escheated and forfeited for his Highness's use. At the
hearing of which sentence, he cheerfully said, The Lord gives life, and the
Lord takes, blessed be the Name of the Lord. And as he was carried back
through the Guards to the Tolbooth, when the People made lamention, he
answered, Though men cut us off, God will receave us, trust in God, trust in
God.

Being come to his Chamber, he immediately addressed himself to God by prayer,
with great enlargement of heart for himself and his fellow prisoners condemned
with him. Being afterward asked, how his leg was, which was tortured; he
answered merrily, "the fear of my Neck now makes me forget my Leg. Thereafter
he said. to another friend, O how good News, to be within four days journey
to enjoy the sight of Jesus Christ, and protested he was not so cumbered how
to die, as he had been sometime to preach a Sermon. To some women lamenting
for him, he said, that his condition, though he was young, and in the budding
of his hopes and labors in the Ministry, yet was not to be mourned for; for,
said he, one drop of my blood, through the Grace of God, may make more hearts
contrite, then many years sermons might have done.

This afternoon he supplicat the Council for liberty to his Father to come and
visit him, which being granted, his Father the next night came to him. Their
first meeting was very sad; and notwithstanding, that according both to the
testimony of his Parents, and knowledge of all his relations, he was a most
obedient Son; yet these inevitable infirmities which are incident to the best
of men, and cannot but furnish sad convictions, when considered in the power
and pure light of the spiritual Law of God, did greatly trouble him in the
remembrance of the fifth commandment. The passage was thus. After prayer his
Father said unto him, Hugo, I called thee a goodly clive-tree of fair fruits,
and now a storm has destroyed the tree and his fruits and branches. He
ansvvered, that his Fathers too good thoughts of him had afflicted him. His
Father said, he was persuaded, God was visiting not his own sin, but his
parents sin upon him, so that he might say, Our Fathers have sinned, and we
have born their iniquity. He said also, I have sinned, thou poor sheep what
have thou done. M. Hew ansvvered with many groans, that through coming short of
keeping the fifth commandment, he had come short of the promise, that his days
should be prolonged in the Land of the living, and that Gods controversy with
him, was for overvaluing his children, especially himself.

On Thursday the 20 of December more from the importunity of Friends, then of
his own inclination, he gave in to the Privy Council, a Petition, as follows.

That whereas upon Tuesday last I was indicted and condemned, for the
treasonable deeds contained in the general and special Indictment exhibited
against me; in the which special Indictment, containing my whole accession to
the said Crimes, there is only libelled presence in several places, with an
ordinary sword, likeas my own confession, which is the naked truth, does
declare, how the same was occasional; And seeing that it was also in some sort
purged and retracted by my withdrawing and deserting with the first
convenience, whereby not only my case appears to be different from that of
others, but also as favorable as possibly can be, nixt to innocence it self;
likeas the same appeared no less to many of these Gentlemen who were upon my
Assize. And seeing the Torture I sustained, and the ingenuity I then used, as
in the sight of God, to the utmost of my knowledge, deserve that favor that
was at that time insinuated; And that it is expected that his Majesty (whose
mercy I beg) according to his great clemency and the most usual practice in the
like cases, will interpose his mercy, for the rescue of many, who are equally
with me involved. May it therefore please your Lordships graciously to consider
the premises, and to pardon my great rashness and precipitancy, and therefore
to indulge such a reprival at your Lo. shall think convenient, until his
Majesty's gracious pleasure anent the premises shall be fully known; At least
till the Commissioner his Grace, do return; And your Lo. answer. The words
marked in this Petition by a different character, were the amendments of his
Friends affection, which they were advised to put in, by some members of the
Privy Council, to whom the copy of it had been presented immediately before the
downsitting of the Council; and thereupon the Petition being transcribed, was
in so great haste presented unto him, to subscribe it, that he got it not read.
However the Petition was both disrelished and refused by the Council; The truth
is, some of his Friends exceeding zealous of his safety, had moved to several
members of the Council, that the Declaration might be tendered to him, and some
time permitted him to advise thereanent; which motion, it is like, was attended
with some insinuations, that probably he might be induced to subscribe it; but
as the motion was ineffectual without a warrant under his own hand, so even the
Authors thereof do bear him witness of his positive, fixed and often declared
resolution, not to subscribe it at the highest rate: Likeas, upon some surmises
to the contrary, he thought it necessary for his own vindication, to leave it
under his hand, that the abovementioned resolution was from his own proper
knowledge and motive, without the assistance of the least disswasive from any
other person.

During his abode in Prison, the Lord was very graciously present with him,
both to sustain him against the fear of death, and to dispel all these
over-cloudings of terror, unto which the frailty of flesh and blood has
sometime exposed the best of men; and also in assisting him in prayer and
praises, to the admiration of all his hearers, especially on the Thursday's
night Dec. 20. whereon being set at supper with his fellow prisoners and his
Father, and one or two besides, he requested his fellow prisoners, saying
merrily, eat to the full, and cherish your bodies, that we may all be a fat
Christmas Pie to the Prelates. After supper in thanksgiving he burst forth in
blessing God, that had made him such a fool as to come to that prison; and
after many gracious words, continued saying, many crosses have come in our way
and wrought but weakly upon us, but here is a cross that has done more good
then all the many that befell us before. Then lamenting the condition of the
Church of God, with much earnestness, he used that exclamation in the last of
Daniel, What Lord shall be the end of these wonders!

The last night of his life, being Friday December. 21. he proponed and answered
himself, several questions, to the strengthening of his fellow prisoners, and
great refreshing of all his hearers. As 1. he inquired; How should he, going
from the Tolbooth through a multitude of gazing People and guards of Soldiers,
to a Scaffold and Gibbet, overcome the impression of al these? To which he
answered; By conceaving a deeper impression of a multitude of Angels who are
also on-lookers; According to that, we are a gazing-stock to the World, Angels
and Men: For the Angels rejoicing at our good confession are present to convey
and carry our souls as the soul of Lazarus, unto Abraham's bosom; Not to
receave them, for that is Jesus Christ's work alone, who will welcome them to
Heaven Himself, with the songs of Angels and blessed Spirits; But the Angels
are ministering Spirits, always ready to serve and strengthen all dying
believers. 2. As Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Jesus standing on the
right hand of God, Who then said, Lord Jesus, receave my Spirit, so (said he)
do I believe, that Jesus Christ is also ready to receave the souls of his dying
sufferers.

2. He enquired, What is the way for us to conceave of Heaven who are hasting
unto it, seeing the Word says, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that
love him? Whereunto he answered, that the Scripture helps us two ways to
conceave of heaven. The first is by way of similitudes, as in that Rev. 21.
where heaven is held forth, by the representation of a glorious City, there
described; but in the same place it is also termed the Bride; but O how unlike
are these two, a Bride and a City! which does clearly evidence the
insufficiency and vast disproportion of all such similitudes; and therefore he
adds, the Scripture furnishes yet a more excellent way to conceave of
heaven; and that is 1. by conceiving the love of Christ to us, even what is the
breadth and length and depth and hight and the immenseness of that love of
Christ, which passes knowledge, which is also the highest and sweetest motive
of praise; unto him, that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own
blood, and has made us Kings and Priests unto God and His Father, to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen. 2. By holding forth the love of the
Saints to Jesus Christ, and teaching of us to love him in sincerity, which is
the very joy and exultation of heaven, Rev. 5.12. Worthy is the Lamb that was
slain, to receave power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and
glory, and blessing. And no other thing then the soul breathing forth love to
Jesus Christ, can rightly apprehend the joys of heaven.

The last words which he spoke at supper, were in the commendation of Love
above knowledge, saying, O but notions of Knowledge without Love, are of small
worth, evanishing in nothing, and very dangerous. After supper, his father
having given thanks, he read the 16 Psalm, and his first words thereafter were,
If there were any thing in the World sadly and unwillingly to be left, it were
the reading of the Scriptures. I said I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord,
in the land of the living, but this needs not make us sad; for where we go, the
Lamb is the book of Scripture, and the light of that City, and there is life,
even the river of the water of life, and living springs. To this he added many
excellent observations, and making mention of the 23 v. of the 31 Psalm. O love
the Lord, all ye his saints, he added, that where love was, it was so
operative, that it made flesh, spirit; and where it was not, there spirit was
made flesh: thereafter he sung a part of the same Psalm.

Supper being ended, he calls smilingly for a pen, saying, it was to write his
Testament, wherein he only ordered some few books, which he had, to be
redelivered to several persons.

He went to bed a little after eleven of the clock, and having slept well till 5
in the morning, he arose and called to his Camerade John Wodrow, saying
pleasantly, up John; for you are too long in bed; you and I look not like men
going this day to be hanged, seeing we lie so long. Thereafter he said to him
in the words of Isaiah chapter 42. v. 24. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to
the robbers? did not the Lord? he against whom we have sinned, for they would
not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto His Law, etc. and I
think, John, (said he) I have not known it, nor do I lay it to heart, as it
is it said in the end of the 25 verse. But, John (said he) for all this be not
afraid, but read the 43. chapter v. 1.2. for all will go well with us. John said
to him, you and I will be chambered shortly in heaven, beside Mr Robertson. He
answered, I fear, John, you bar me out, because you was more free before the
Council then I was; but I shall be as free as any of you upon the Scaffold.
Before breakfast. he said, he had got a clear ray of the Majesty of the Lord
after his awaking, but it was a little again over-clouded. Thereafter he prayed,
and attested the Lord, that he had devoted himself to the service of God in the
Ministry of the Lord Jesus, and the edification of souls, very early; adding
albeit I have not been so with my God, yet thou have made with me an
Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure; this is all my desire,
joy and salvation, albeit thou make me not a house to grow. Now Lord, we
come to thy throne, a place we have not been accquainted with; earthly King's
thrones have dvocats against poor men, but thy Throne has Jesus, an Advocate
for us. Our supplication this day, is not to be free of death, nor of pain in
death, but that we may vvitness before many vvitnesses, a good confession.

His Father coming to him that morning to bid him ^arewel, his last words to
him were, after prayer and a little discourse, that his suffering would do more
hurt to the Prelates, and be more edifying to God's people then if he were to
continue in the Ministry, for twenty years. And then he desired his Father to
leave him, else he would but trouble him, and I desire it of you, said he, As
the best and last service you can do me, to go to your chamber, and pray
earnestly to to the Lord to be with me on that Scaffold: for how to carry
there is my care, even that I may be strengthened to endure to the end.

About two of the clock in the Afternoon, he was carried to the Scaffold
with other five that suffered with him; where he appeared to the conviction
of all that formerly knevv him, with a fairer, better and more stayed
countenance then ever they had before observed. Being come to the foot of the
Ladder, he directed his speech North-vvard to the multitude. And, premising,
That as his Years in the World had been but fevv, so his Words at that time
should not be many. He spoke to the People, the speech and Testimony which he
had before written and subscribed.

Having done speaking to the People, who heard him with great attention, he
sung a part of the 31 Psalm. and then prayed with such power and fervency, as
forced many to vveep bitterly. Having ended he gives his cloak and hat from
him; And when he turnned himself and took hold of the Ladder to go up, he said
with an audible voice, I care no more to go up this Ladder and over it, then
if I were going home to my Fathers House; And as he went up, hearing a great
noise amongst the People, he called down to his fellovv-sufferers, saying,
Friends and Fellow Sufferers, be not afraid, every step of this Ladder is a
degree nearer Heaven. Then having seated himself thereon, he said, I do partly
believe, that, the Nobles, Counselors, and Rulers of the Land, would have used
some mitigation of this punishment, had they not been instigated by the
Prelates, so our blood lies principally at the Prelates door. But this is my
comfort now, that I know my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this Body,
yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self, and mine Eyes
shall behold (pointing to his eyes) and not another, though my reins be
consumed in me. And now I do willingly lay down my life for the Truth and
Cause of God, the Covenants and Work of Reformation, which were once counted
the Glory of this Nation. And it is for endeavoring to defend this, and to
extirpate that bitter root of Prelacy, that I embrace this rope (the
Executioner putting the rope about his ncek.) Then hearing the People weep, he
said, Your work is not to vveep, but to pray that we may be honorably born
through; and blessed be the Lord, that supports me. Now as I have been
beholden to the prayers and kindness of many since my imprisonment and
sentence; So I hope you will not be vvanting to me now, in this last step of
my journey, that I may vvitness a good Confession: And that you may know the
ground of my encouragement in this Work, and what my hope is, I will read to
you the last Chapter of the Bible; And having read it, he said, Here you see
the Glory that is to be revealed upon me, a pure river of water of life, and
so forth (read the place) where the Throne of God is, and the Lamb is in it,
where his Servants serve Him and see His face, and His Name is in their
foreheads, and the Lord God gives them light, and they shall reign for ever
and ever; and here you see my access to my Glory and revvard. Let him that is a
thirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely.
And here you see also my vvelcome, the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. Then he
said, I have one word more to say to my Friends, (looking down to the
Scaffold) where are you? You need neither lament me nor be ashamed of me in
this condition, for I may make use of that expression of Christ's, I go to your
Father and my Father, to your God and my God, to your King and my King, to the
blessed Apostles and Martyrs, and to the City of the Living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the General Assembly and
Church of the Firstborn, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of
just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant; And so I
bid you all farevvell: For God will be more comfortable to you then I could
be; And he will also now be more refreshing to me, then you can be: farevvel,
farevvel in the Lord. Then the Napkin being put on his face, he prayed a space
within himself, after which he put up the cloth from his face, with his
own hand, and said, he had one word more to say, and that was to show them
the comfort he had in his Death, saying, I hope you perceaved no alteration or
discouragement in my countenance and carriage, and as it may be your vvonder,
so I profess it is a vvonder to my self, and I will tell you the reason of
it: Besides the justness of my Cause, this is my comfort, which was said of
Lazarus when he dyed, that the Angels did carry his soul into Abraham's Bosom;
so, that as there is a great solemnity here, of a confluence of People, a
Scaffold, a Gallovvs, and People looking out at vvindovvs; so is there greater
and more solemn preparation in Heaven, of Angels to carry my soul to Christ's
bosom. Again, this is my comfort, that it is to come in Christ's hands, and He
will present it blameless and faultless to the Father, and then shall I be
ever with the Lord. And now I leave of to speak any more to creatures, and
turn my speech to thee. O Lord! and now I begin my intercourse with God,
which shall never be broken off. Farewell Father and Mother, Friends and
Relations; Farevvel the World and all Delights, Farevvell meat and drink,
Farevvel Sun, Moon and Stars; VVelcome God and Father, VVelcome svveet Lord
Jesus, the Mediator of the new Covenant, VVelcome blessed Spirit of Grace and
God of all consolation, VVelcome Glory, VVelcome Eternal Life, VVelcome Death.
Then he desired the Executioner not to turn him over, until he should put over
his own shoulders himself, which, after praying a little within himself, he
did, saying, O Lord! into thy hands I commit my Spirit: for thou have redeemed
my Soul, Lord God of truth. Thus in the 26 Year of his age, he died, as he
lived, in the Lord.

FINIS.
Some Instances of the Sufferings of Galloway and Ntthisdale.
BEcause in the former Deduction, mention is made of a Paper containing some of
the Sufferings of Galloway and Nithisdale* it is not inconvenient, for more
Particular Information, to subjoyn a few instances out of the same Paper.

And first, at three several inroads which the Soldiers have made into that
Country, in the Years 1663, 1665 and 1666. they exacted from the People there,
for adhereing to their old faithful Ministers, and not submitting to the
Ministry of those whom the Prelates violently obtruded upon them, the Sums of
Money underwritten, viz. Lib. S. d. From 49 Families in the Parish of
Carsphairn, 4864 17 0 From 43 Families in the Parish of Dalray, 9577 16 8 From
49 Families in Balmaclelland, 6430 10 0 From 9 Families in Balmacghie, 425 11 8
From 2 or 3 Families in Tungland, 166 12 0 From some poor Persons in Tuynham,
81 4 0 From 20 Families in Borg, 2026 17 4 From 9 poor Families in Girton, 525
10 4 From some poor Families in Anwith, 733 6 4 From 34 inconsiderable Families
in Kirkpatrick-Durham, 2235 6 0 From some few Fam. in Kirkmabrek, 563 6 0 From
3 Families in Monygaff, 600 0 0 From 18 Families in Kircudbright, 2580 0 0 From
37 poor Families in Lochruton, notwithstanding they wanted a Curate, 2080 0 0
From 12 poor Families in Traquair, 756 10 0 From Kells Parish, 466 13 4 From
Corsemichall Parish, 1666 13 4 From 24 Families in Parton Parish, 2838 9 4 From
42 Families in Irongray, 3362 18 8 Summa 41982 12 0 In the Sheriffdom of
Nithsdale or Dumfries-Shire.
From 51 Families in the Town and Parish of Dumfries, 4617 15 4 From 20 poor
Families in Kirkmahoe, 1341 6 6 From 14 Families in Dunscoir, 1411 13 4 In
Glencairn Parish, 2146 14 8 Summa of Nithisdale 9517 9 10 Summa totalis 51500 2
10

And although these Sums (being Scots-money) may seem small to strangers, yet
considering that they are not leavyed proportionally from all the People, but
some select persons within these bounds, and that there are 19 or 20 Parishes
of which there is no account at all; and that the great expense of free quarter
by the soldiers, in most of the Parishes abovenamed (which would amount to a
great sum) is not included, and that several persons have not as yet paid,
but are to pay their Fines and Cess; and that several of the poor people,
through fear, at diverse times have given bribes in money and other things to
Officers and Soldiers, for keeping them free of Cess and Quartering
(notwithstanding whereof they were little or nothing the better) and that the
Parliament before, arbitrarily and for no alleged crime, had exacted by their
Act of Fining, from 132 Persons within the said bounds, the sum of 77120
Pounds Scots Money; And that the Cess (besides free Quartering) levied by the
Soldiers, according to the Commissioner's Order, for alleged Deficiency in
Payment of the said Fines, extended to near as much as the Principal,
Considering (I say) all these things, the Sums are very considerable, and much
greater then could have been expected in so little bounds, and in a Country so
poor and mountainous, and less fertile then many others in the Land.

But the exacting of money was not all, but in effect a small part of their
oppression: for the carriage of the soldiers in free quartering was very
cruel, barbarous and inhumane, as will appear by these general aggravations and
particular instances.

Ordinarily in Quartering, they did not content themselves with sufficiency,
but set themselves to consume and waste needlessly; sometimes throwing whole
sheep to their dogs, and scattering corn, hay and straw, they and their boys
usually saying, we came to destroy, and we shall destroy you.

Ordinarily when they had consumed the Landlord, they quartered upon the poor
Tennants, and when they had consumed the Tennants, did fall upon the
Landlords, although they had conformed; as they did upon a Gentleman in
Kirkmahoe.

Frequently these who conformed from the beginning, and others who conformed of
late, did no less suffer then these who conformed not at all; and some in
several Parishes, who had given all the obedience which was demanded, suffered
more then these who gave none at all; yea conforming husbands have been
Punished by Fine, Cess and quartering for their nonconforming wives.

It is also to be considered, that, besides all that the Country had thus
suffered, the soldiers were again sent forth through the Country, and new
Fines, Cess and Quarter were imposed upon the same persons and families who had
been fined before; yea, upon some it was doubled and tripled, so that some
Yeomens were fined in 500 merks Scots besides their former fines. All which is
the more considerable, that, although the Papists in that Country were very
numerous, few of them were troubled, and these inconsiderable Persons, who were
only fined in inconsiderable sums for the fashion.

And particularly in the Parish of Balmaclelland, a poor widow with several
fatherless children, after she had paid at several times 320 merks, and
suffered the Cess of 3 soldiers 17 days, coming to the Commander of that
Party to complain of some wrongs done unto her, in stead of access, she is
mercilessly boasted down stairs.

In the same Parish an old deaf man, after he had paid 52 rex-dallers, and
then given bond for 350 pounds Scots, was so tossed, what by being brought
before the High Commission, and what by rude usage at home, that he contracted
sickness and dyed; and thereafter his poor widow, having paid 120 pounds, was
quartered upon many days, until she was forced to leave her house, and through
cold and double grief contracted a deadly sickness.

In the same Parish a poor man, having been quartered upon and Paid 120 pounds
Scots, was himself cast into prison, while 8 soldiers quartered upon him at
home. In the same Parish, a Gentleman, who did ordinarily come to Church, was
quartered upon by six soldier, notwithstanding that himself, his Lady and most
part of his family were sick.

In the same Parish a poor man being quartered upon 38 days, and having paid
48 pounds, and given bond for 150 pounds, though as is informed, he has not so
much as a free Cow, when he came to complain, he was beaten by the Officer, and
returning, was again beaten by the Soldiers. In the same Parish, a poor
bedridden man with his sick wife were necessitated to beg, until he gathered
three pounds to give for his Fine or Cess.

In the same Parish a very poor bedridden creple man was forced to pay 50 merks.

In the same Parish a very old honest man, who being reckoned past 80 years,
and unable to work in his trad being a Coupar, and scarce having the worth of a
groat of free goods, but the Countries charity, was forced to pay 20 pounds.

In the Parish of Corsemichall, the soldiers being quartered in a house,
having lest some broth of mutton, did violently thrust away the hungry children
from supping thereof, till first they set their dogs to leap it, and then did
bid the children take what the dogs had left.

In the Parish of Parton, the soldiers, horse and foot, after they had
quartered 15 weeks in a Gentleman's house, till they had eaten up the Provision
wherewith he should have maintained his family, having five or six small
children, they forced his wife and servants to the doors, after they had been
their slaves and servants all that time, and then Possessed themselves absolute
masters of his whole houses, plenishings, cattle and what else was his within
their reach; and when some good neighbors had received the little ones for
shelter, with great difficulty could they obtain one milk Cow of twelve
belonging to their Father, for supply of the children. Nota. This Gentleman
seems to be utterly broken, and hes been several times imprisoned and
miserably tossed up and down.

In the Parish of Borg, in a Gentleman's house, the soldiers did quarter for 15
weeks, till they consumed the whole provision of the Family, which was well
furnished with meal and malt and other necessaries; they also destroyed the
whole plenishing (except one table which they left in case they came again)
even to the pulling down of the Partition Wall of the main dwelling house, and
pulling down of an Office-house without the gate: All this destruction they
committed by giving and selling one part within the Country, and sending
another part to Glasgow, and breaking and burning the rest of it, of purpose
that it might be useless for the owner, who was forced to flee before, and
betake himself to wandering with his brother and their families. And after they
had committed all this vastation, they also fell upon their Tennants, and
forced them to bring in malt, sheep, fowls, and other things (for their
maintenance) that they pleased to call for, and so ruined them also; And two of
his Tennants they forced to scatter their families, having threatened to burn
their houses, besides all the destruction they had done to their Master and them
before.

In the Parish of Irongray, a poor Tennant having bargained with the Soldiers,
to redeem his goods for 36 pounds, when he came to Dumfris, they would hardly
take 50 pounds, so that he was forced to borrow the overplus. and being
returned home to shear his corns, and expecting no more trouble from them, they
came back upon him, and took away his beasts and all, even to the leading away
of his hay. The like was practiced upon another in the same Parish.

And further, some Maintenance imposed in the year 1648, being alleged unpayed
by several Gentlemen and others within the Sheriffdom of Nithisdale, letters
of horning were raised by the Collectors; which letters and executions thereof
were suspended, because the same was already paid, and yet notwithstanding,
Troopers were sent to Cess and Quarter upon the said persons, till they should
make payment, although the suspension was not discussed; and several of them,
to be releeved of the heavy burden of the Cess and quartering, were
constrained to make payment thereof, and that by and attour the Cess for the
same, which was far above the said maintenance, in so much that a Gentleman who
at first might have paid for 30 pounds, the Party that went to Cess upon him
would not aggree to remove for less then 200 merks, Yea after an order was
procured from the Commissioner, for removing the Cess for the said Maintenance,
a party of 8 or 9 horsemen, with their boys and horses, were sent once and
again to quarter upon some Gentlemen, until they were forced to make a new
address to the Commissioner for removal thereof.

By all which, that Country was so exhausted of money, that neither poor nor
rich could get it to satisfy these men's demands, and the poor people were
forced to sell their beasts in the Merkets below their worth; in so much that
they were forced to sell a Cow for two Nobles or two Crowns, the soldiers in
the mean time standing by to receave the same, although the poor men had
destitute families at home: Yea many families whose sums are not here
reckoned, in probability are totally ruined, and many others scattered, and
particularly in Lochrutton there are above 16 families broken, in Irongray the
most part of the families are broken, beside several that are already put from
housekeeping, the soldiers having taken away, both there and elsewhere, that
which the People should have lived upon; yea several Gentlemen, formerly in
good condition, were put from housekeeping, and forced to wander, and be
beholden to others for a nights lodging, the soldiers having violently
possessed themselves of their barns, cattle and other goods.

Neither is this all, the wickedness, prophanity and blasphemies of the
soldiers, are rather to be abhorred and suppressed then thought or spoken of, if
the notoriety thereof were not universal in these bounds.

In the Parish of Carsphairn, in an Inn at the Bridge of Deugh, on the
Sabbath Day, some of them being quartered there, they most profanely and
atheistically mocked at all preaching of the Gospel, saying, let us go preach,
and then read their text out of the Cherry and the Slae (an old Scotch Amorous
Poem) counterfeiting a form of divine worship, and as it is informed did sing
an other part of the same Poem in stead of the Psalms, and used all other
mocking modes, as if they had been serious at Gods worship.

In the Parish of Irongray, an honest man retiring himself to the fields for
secret prayer (not having liberty at home) was followed by the Soldiers, who
drew swords upon him threatening to kill him, if they heard him praying any
more, saying, Sir, we have heard you many times howling, if we hear you again,
etc.

Another time in that same Parish, the Master of the house was exhorting them
to leave off their swearing and profanity, showing them the danger and hazard
they were in of the condemnation of Hell, some of the soldiers mocking at
hell most blasphemously answered. By my soul ere I go to hell, it shall cost
God 24 hours pains ere he get me there.

In the Town of Kircudbright, when one Captain Fin an horseman died, one of his
Camerads coming to see him, and finding him dead, came near and rudely gripping
the dead man, used this horrid expression, what, devil art thou dead, man? and
did not tell me before, that I might have sent a letter to hell with thee (to
such a camerade of his as he named, who had died lately before) to take up my
winter quarters.

In the same Town also, as is informed, some of them conveening at the Cross,
and drinking there healths, one of them personating... (Who dare express whom)
used this blasphemous expression to his Camerads, Ye are my Angels, and I drink
to you all. But we abhor to mention any more of this sort: only this is
certain, that Atheism and Blasphemy is become so ordinary with them, that some
of themselves are forced to regret it.

In the Parish of Carsphairn, some of the foot soldiers did so barbarously and
cruelly struggle with a man's wife to have forced her (till she was rescued out
of their hands by some women) that she for fear parted with child, and kept
her bed half a year, being near unto death, and little hope of recovery.

Also in a Gentleman's house in the same Parish, where they were quartered,
they cruelly beat some of the servants to the effusion of their blood, for all
the good service they had done them,

POSTSCRIPT.
BY these things, which have been done in Galloway and Nithisdale, as the
Reader may compute, what vast susferings and horrid abominations must be in the
whole Land, many places whereof are no less disaffected to Prelacy, when there
are so many and gross, in so little bounds and so short time; so he may
preceave, what provocation that poor oppressed people had to endeavor their
own preservation, and to take hold of any opportunity for vindicating their
religious and civil Interests: and what reason others, either in the same
condition with them, or upon the common ground of Nonconformity, being
threatened and justly fearing to be shortly reduced thereunto, had, according
to their obligation in the Covenant, for mutual defense and assistance in the
common cause of Religion and Liberty, to join with them for their help. Neither
should I have adventured to insert these instances, if (besides the diligent
care that was used in collecting of them, making them credible; the notoriety
thereof, whereby they were unquestioned in that part of the Country; and many
suchlike things (whereunto all that is mentioned, is but like a preface)
committed since November. 1666, especially in the Western parts, rendering them
probable) they were not the native product of this Prelatical course, betwixt
which and them there is such connection, as is betwixt the natural cause and the
effect, and if the committers thereof had not had command, example and
encouragement for many of them from the Prelates, whom they resemble as much as
face answers to face in water. It is true the Prelates should no more bear all
the blame, then Satan (who restrains none but tempts to all) should be
charged with all the Sin of man, and they were and are first and chief in the
transgression, who were their Authors and are their upholders and abettors, and
in retaliation of their flattery of the Powers, and connivance at profanness in
all, and in subserviency to their interest and design, have perpetrated and
permitted so much wickedness and oppression; Yea the Peoples walking willingly
after the commandment, will never Excuse those, who by Law, Force and Example
make Israel to Sin: yet it is above contradiction, that Prelacy is the chief
though not the only Interest, in subserviency to which all these things are
done; and the Prelates themselves are a conjunct if not the Principal cause
thereof. These men having put off their former vizards, no man needs further
to unmask them. Let these who employed and maintained Sharp to agent their
cause, and others who promoted him to the Prelacy, declare their own
Experience, of his continued series of ungrate deceaving and undermining of
them and their Interests, under Trust and professions to the contrary, as all
men know that he has Impiously and Perfidiously betrayed the Church and Cause
of God: if they will not, Let his own many letters written unto them, be
produced, as in reason and for Vindication they should, and they will evince
him to be the Archest Traitor that ever Scotland bred: And how can it otherwise
be? will he who is false to God, be true to any man? If that man escape some
stupenduous and disgraceful remark by the hand of God or Man, I will not say,
that Others need neither fear the One nor regard the other, but sure I am, that
many more Experienced in the observation of divine Providence; and forse^ing
then I am, are much mistaken. Let the City of Glasglow, and persons of all
Qualities, especially in that countrey-side, ingenuously say, whether that
fiery Zelot for the height of English Hierarchy and Ceremonies, and otherwise
insignificant man, Master Burnet prelate there, does nor, in Just recompense of
too many their enslaving their own light and conscience, in flattery of him,
and complying with that course, most insolently domineer over them as his
slaves, with as much Pride, Ambition, and Contempt, as the most absolute Prince
does over his vassals. Let these of the Synod of Glasgow remember, with what
deep dissimulation Mr Hamilton prelat of Galloway, did by Express suffrage
declare, before the last Synod there, against the same Prelacy, which at that
same instant of time, he was clandestinly corresponding with the Rulers to
establish. This man of all others, has been the chief Cause of all the
Oppression and persecution in that country, and thereby the Occasion of the
late riseing in Arms, and blood that has followed thereupon. One instance of
Mr Honeyman prelate of Orkney I cannot ommit, that in the year 1661, when Mr
Sharp had discovered himself, walking in his own garden, he said to a famous
person who can bear witness thereof, (Just as Balaam spoke truth whether he
would or not) That Mr Sharp was as false as Judas, and I would gladly know, to
whom this Casuist, who since has embraced a Bishopric, will Compare himself
for fals-hood, except to him who entered into Judas with the sop. I need tell
no man who knows the Persons, of the brutish Sensuality of Mr Wallace P. of
the Isles, who studieth more the filling of his belly then he was ever fit for
feeding of a flock; nor of the hatred of Godliness and good men in Mr Guthrey
P. of Dunkel who while he was Minister at Sterlin, was an old persecuter of
both; nor the scandalous drinking of Mr Sraughan P. of Brechen, let those who
visit him in his own house, declare how liberally he uses to entertain them
with Wine there, upon their own Expense. It is true indeed, that Mr Lighton
prelate of Dumblan, under a Jesuitial-like vizard of Pretended Holiness,
humility, and crucifixion to the world, has studied to seem to Creep upon the
ground, but always up the hill, toward promotion and places of more ease,
honor and Wealth; and as there is none of them all has with a Kiss so betrayed
the Cause, and smiten Religion under the fifth rib, and has been such an
offense to the godly, so there is none who by his way, practice and
Expressions, gives greater suspicion of a popish affection, inclination and
design. If these men had not put off their own veil, no pencil of the most
skilled artist could have drawn them to the life, but now by showing of
themselves, they have saved others a labor, or at least made it more easy. And
therefore I shall rake no more into this unpleasant dung-hil of the vilest
vice, which they and their Brethren in Iniquity (whom not nameing here does not
Except from their part of the charg of Ambition, Pride, Sensuality, Idleness,
Covetousness, Oppression, Persecution, Dissimulation, Perjury, Treacheiy, and
Hatred of Godliness and Good men,) have heaped together in their own Persons,
and transsused to others over all the Land. O the Immense long suffering and
unsearchable Wisdom of God! who, hearing the cry of these things, stirs
not the Zeal of all to Execute his just Judgment upon these men; but it may be,
that he is ripening and reserving them, for a more God-like strok, then any
would be acknowledged to be, wherein man were Instrumental. Neither are their
Mercenaries, whom they hire as Postillions to ride upon the fore-horse of all
their Wickedness, less skilled, but more foreward that way then their drivers.
It were as far above the faith of any, who have not heard and seen, to believe,
and might render any pen suspected of the want of truth or tenderness, to write
the Hundredth part, as it it easy to instance incredibly much, but endless to
relate all that is true of the Ignorance, Lightness and Profaness of these men.
When I have told, that several lying in known and acknowledged fornication,
without removal of the scandal, have been admitted to the Ministry by the
Prelates who knew it, and violently obtruded by them and the Patrons upon the
offended people; That some of them after Admission, have been deprehended lying
with women by the way side; that Others have been found guilty of Actual
fornication, and of unanswerable presumptions of Adultery with other men's
wives; and that drounkenness is both open and frequent amongst many of them, I
may well awake the wonder, the blush and horror of the reader, but I have only
begun to show a part (and indeed avery small part) of these men's ways. A
Prophet he may be by way of prognostication, but let the world Judge what manner
of Preacher he must be, who, offending that the people did not come to hear
him, did, before the Congregation, Imprecate thus against himself, God nor I be
hanged hut I shall make you all come. Another refused to pay the price of a
horse before he pleased, (which he used to boast privately would be at
Doomsday) because the seller, at the making of the bargan, in Civility said,
Pay me when ye please; and thereupon, to the scorn and derision of all,
substained an action of Law some days before a Civil Court. Who will commerce
with such horse-koopers? but much less who can acknowledge such men for
Ministers? These men, being themselves generally without substance and form of
Religion, are such malicious persecuters of both in Others, that as I could
never hear of one soul turned from Satan to God by their labors (whereof
indeed there are many profane seals) so they are become vile in the eyes of
all, that are truly godly or but morally civil; In so much that this is the
only advantage, (and indeed it is an advantage, for if they were more smooth
and sober, they might be more insnaring) that they do not wear a rough garment
to deceave; and though I cannot say, that their outside is as unclean as their
inner-side, yet it is such as says in every man's heart, that the fear of God
is not before their eyes. These are the pleasant birds, that are hatched and
cherished under the warm wings of Prelacy, of whom though no man can speak the
half of the truth to a stranger, without exposing himself to the Censure of
partiality, Passion or being a Reproacher; yet the Universal and
incontroverted Notoriety of these things, in all places where they reside or
converse, will absolve the relater before all men who know them. It is true, we
do not charg every individual with every particular, yet because they are
generally true of Many, and being notourly knows and sometimes represented are
not remeeded, they are chargable upon the Course, which being Sinful in self,
the Authors and Abettors thereof are participant of the guilt, and liable to
the punishment. And indeed the Lord has already begun his controversy with
some of them, not only by pouring shame and Contempt upon them (particularly
upon Traitorous Sharp) and drying up the Right eye and blasting the gifts which
several seemed to have (whether by their own negligence, which every man
observes, or Immediate judgment, or both, I do not determine,) but also by
visible cursing of their substance, diverse of them being necessitated through
poverty to sell their tithes at half worth, long before they are payable, and
others of them to remove, leaving more debt behind, then they are able to
discharge. Neither have these men thus profaned the sanctuary only, and by the
sins of the Sons of Ely made all men to abhor the offering of the Lord; but
from them are issued forth, such overflowing streams of wickedness over all
the Land, that, besides all that is mentioned, there are other inconceavable and
inexpressible Atheistical abominations said to be committed by men, which, as
it is a Wonder the Devil himself should dare to act, so for fear of the great
and dreadful God, and of offending the ears of others, my heart trembles to
think, and my hand fails to writ. O Lord forgive, that ever another
speaking, but much more Acting, should have occasioned my Thinking thereof.

And yet as if all that is related were too little, for sanctuary to
themselves, for further inslaving of the Country, and venting of insatiable
revenge (cursed be their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is
cruel) they have procured two Proclamations, dated at Edinburgh March. 25.
1667. making mention of great evidence of many disaffected Persons in the
Western Shares, who are ready to break out in open Rebellion, and involve the
Kingdom in blood; and of just reason of suspicion that these Rebels will rise
in Arms against the King and his Authority, and not only make use of the
Arms, Powder and Ammunition concealed or transported from Enemies, but sense
upon the Arms of others, and invade the Ministers of the Gospel etc. And
therefore for preventing and disabling of them to put themselves in Military
posture, to make sudden marches or attempts upon other Subjects or the standing
Forces, or to join with other persons of Pernicious And disloyal principles,
etc. commanding all persons within the Shires of Lanerk, Air, Renfrew, Wigton
and Stewarty of Kire^dbright, who have refused or deserted public trust, who
withdraw from public Ordinances, and keep not their Parish-Churches, or do not
submit to the present Government of the Church, and all who being warned did
not join to suppress the late Rebellion, unless they take the Oath of
Allegiance, and subscribe the Declaration, that after the 15 day of May next,
by themselves or any other for their behoof, they do not keep any horse above
the value of an hundred merks; and in case of failzie, that the Sherif value
and deliver such horses to the Informer without payment to be made therefore;
and before the first of May, to deliver to their respective Sherifs all their
Arms and Ammunition (allowing Gentlemen only swords) under the pain of fining
each Gentleman in 2000 merks, and each other person in 500 merks, whereof the
one half to the Informer; and commanding all Heritors and Parishioners to
defend the persons, families, and goods of their Ministers, from all affronts
and injuries, with certification that the sufferers and not opposers of the
same, shall be reputed art and part, and he proceeded against with all rigor as
guilty thereof; and in case of surprizal, that they pursue, apprehend and
present the committers before the Council, otherwise to be liable to reparation
of damnage, etc. What new and strange Policy is there here, that the Narrative
of both Proclamations, in stead of concealing in the time of declared and
continued War with Forrainers, should proclaim that there are so many
disaffected persons, who are ready to rise in Arms, to seize upon the Arms of
others, and weaken the Forces of the Kingdom, thereby expressing the sense of
their own deservings, and the fears of an evil conscience, discovering their
own nakedness to enemies, and encouraging Forrainers to invade with the more
confidence? Must these Shires, which, without derogation to others, do
eminently flourish with men of Piety toward God and true Lo^alty, and during
the King's Exile, did retain a more faithful remembrance of his Interest
according to the Covenants, then many other places of the Kingdom, be, of all
other Shires within the same in recompense thereof, rewarded with the Titles of
disaffected persons, Rebels, men of pernicious and disloyal principles, and
spoiled of their goods? Whence should these, who being spoiled of all Arms,
first by the English, and then by the Council since the King's return, be
presumed to have concealed Arms! What ground is there to suggest unto the
World, the transportation of Arms from Enemies? Must every man who will not
throw away for nothing his Horse and Arms, which he has purchased by his
money, be therefore a seditious and disaffected person, and accordingly
proceeded against with all rigor* If none within these Shires must keep a horse
exceeding the value abovementioned, how impossible is it to labor much of the
ground? How are covetous wretches, in hope of gaining horse without Payment,
and the half of the Fines for concealed Arms, animated to give in invidious
Informations against the owners? and many poor well meaning people tempted, to
redeem their beasts at the rate of Perjury and breach of Covenant? What an
absurd thing is it, to punish men otherwise innocent, only for not accepting
or deserting public trust; whereunto they neither have access, nor can
continue in without formal and express Perjury? How irrational and unjust is
it, to command (under a penalty) Parishioners to do that which may be
impossible, yea without the compass of their knowledge, such as opposing, but
much more apprehending and presenting surprizers? wherewith, I pray you, shall
these who must deliver up all their Arms (reserving not so much as a sword)
defend themselves or any other man, against violence and surprizall? We read in
our History of a Law, whereby for repressing of Theft, men were not to shut
their doors in the night, and satisfaction was ensured to the owner for any
thing that should be stolen from him; whereupon a Countryman alleging his
goods to be stolen, obtained payment; but being found thereafter that himself
had hid them, he was hanged for a reward to himself and example to others: Now
what if some of these covetous and malicious Men should (for who can rationally
promise and secure, but that they who have done worse, may also) thus abstract
or cause abstract their own goods? what if the Lord should immediately smit them
for offering strange fire? or thieves and robers should fall upon them? or evil
Spirits in humane shape* should haunt or hurt them, must Innocent people upon
their invidious and false alleagance be therefore punished? As if the
Parishioners of Carpha^^ should pay for Mckinney's silver plate, which his own
servant stole from him.

Ah Scotland, which the Lord planted a noble vine, wholly a right seed! how are
thou turned into a degenerate plant of a Strange Vine? Where is now the Spirit
of the Fathers, that (as if thy inhabitants were neither Christians; Men nor
Patriots) Religion, the Land, Ourselves, and the Posterity, in Bodies,
Consciences, and Estats should be thus emancipated, to the Interest, Lust and
Design of 14 Prelates and their Hirelings, whom the Lords sparing is a greater
wonder, then if he should convert them into Pillars of salt for their Apostasy:
O Backslide^ Scotland! remember from whence thou art fallen, Repent and Do the
First works, or else he will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
candlestcik out of his place, except thou Repent.

FINIS.
