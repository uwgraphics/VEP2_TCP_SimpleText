TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE Lord General Monck. The Humble Address of the MEMBERS OF
PARLIAMENT (In behalf of the People) interrupted and forceably secluded by
Cromwell and his Confederates, 1648.
My Lord,
WE hope it is not unknown unto your Excellency, neither unto these Nations for
whom we served as Members in that Parliament interupted by Oliver Cromwell, and
his confederates in the year 1648. That it was by them forceably done, that we
might not in a Parliamentary way discharge our consciences and Trust reposed in
us by the people, whereby the Nations would through the blessings of God have
been settled. And upon those Concessions from his Majesty at the Isle of Whites
Treaty, which we found to be a sufficient ground, we did resolve, after some
further Treaty, to conclude a Peace, and thereby prevent the efusion of more
Christian blood, secure the people from further Calamities, and preserve their
rights and freedom entire from any insolent or Arbitrary powers whatsoever:
But being hitherto by violence kept out, and sometimes imprisoned, we cannot
possibly act: Therefore we desire your Excellency to remove that force which
thus obstructs the peoples Rights and our freedom in Parliament, by which you
will certainly open a door to the future safety and Tranquillity of these
Kingdoms, and we can further assure your Lordship, That in this the people
will rest satisfied, otherwise we can never expect a lasting peace; for when
they are limited and tied to such qualifications, as we understand are intended
in their Elections, it signifies the same with what they already have, and do
now so grievously complain and petition against; from hence we have seriously
considered the evils and great troubles growing upon us, And unless we can
prevail with your Excellency-unto whom we make this our humble Address in their
behalf, That we may be admitted according to those Addresses of the Gentry of
Devon, and other parts, The Nation is unavoidably in a lost condition, as a
short time will discover: all which we leave to your Lordships consideration,
and as we expect this liberty from you, we are resolved to lessen the present
burdens of the people, by taking off all Taxes, Excise, Oppressions and
grievances whatsoever.

February 4. 1659.
