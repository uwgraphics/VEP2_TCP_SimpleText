THE NOBLE CAVALIER CARACTERISED, AND A REBELLIOUS CAVILLER CAUTERISED.
By JOHN TAILOR.
TO begin roundly, soundly, and profoundly, The Cavalier is a Gentleman, a
Commander on Horseback; The Caviller is a Rascal, whether he swim, go, or
ride; the Cavalier dares fight and be valiant, obey Law, and serve for his
Sovereign, his Country, for the true Religion established, for the Laws, for
the Subjects Liberty, for the Rights and Privileges of Parliaments, and for
the peace, conservation and tranquillity of all these he will send his best
blood, and life too, and think them well spent; the Caviller dares quarrel,
but not fight, he dares rebel and not obey, he transformes his obedience into
refractory contempt, his love into loathing of Loyalty; his Religion into false
hypocritical Faction, the service of his King he translates into Treason, his
service to his Country is his Countries ruin, his seeming to support the
Laws, is on purpose to be lawless, the Subjects Right and Liberty he
metamorphiseth into oppression, slavery and bondage, the Rights and Privileges
of Parliaments he destroys with defending, and against the peace of all these
he will plot, contrive, invent, contemplate, meditate, slander, lie, write,
rail, libell, and do or say any thing but what is just, true, and honest.

All which Villainies are so contrary to a cavalier, that a greater disparity is
not betwixt Light and Darkness, or between God and Belial; and although the
black mouthed, venomed toothed Caviller does daily seek to sully and blast the
name of a Cavalier, by bestowing on them the sweet stinking Epithites and
Titles of Damme, renounce, consume, confound, sink, and the like execrable
Blasphemies, which indeed are inexcusable, and inevitably damnable; yet I must
be so plain with the Caviller, as to tell him that Lot's Incest was no excuse
for Achan's Theft, Cain's committing Murder was no warrant for Achitophel to
give treacherous Counsel, nor was Rabsheka's blasphemy any president for the
lying hypocrisy of Ananias and Saphira; no more are the detestable and
damnable Oaths with which the Caviller does charge and scandal the Cavalier,
any presidents to move or maintain lying, dissimulation, cheating, Rebellion,
Treason, etc.

Nor can I believe the saint seeming Caviller, that the Cavalier has taken all
the profane swearing from him, for if he will but call his seared, cauterized
Conscience to a strict examination, it will tell him, that he has sworn an
Oath of Allegiance to be loyal to his King, which Oath is recorded in Heaven,
and the breach of it is to be punished in Hell, of the violation of which Oath
the Cavalier is guiltless, and the Caviller most damnably guilty.

We must with humble thankfulness confess the great blessings which the
Almighty has been graciously pleased to multiply upon the learned and pious
pains taking of our Preachers, for they do preach and exhort to the amendment
of life and manners; they do pray to the God of peace for the peace of God, and
they do implore and invocate the Throne of Grace, for the Conversion of all
cavilling contentious Preachers, and all the rest of malicious and ignorant
seduced Cavillers, that (seeing their errouts) they may heartily and
unfeignedly repent for their Rebellions and Treasons, against the Lord and
against his Anointed. Those Preachers have so prevailed in their good
endeavors, that they have and daily do beat down swearing, and wound the
Consciences of the swearers with the Sword of the Spirit, so that the Cavaliers
can afford the Cavillers and their holy Armies all their Oaths, and their
Drunkenness too, although it is manifestly known that you have been always
provided, by the help of your Grand Signiour of the Lower black House, to
furnish all the Armies in Christendom with those accursed conditions.

It was never known that all Soldiers should be found to be All Saints, or
that a whole Army consisted of none but godly and religious Persons, some may
be drawn (out of blind zeal) by opinion and imagined good intents; also there
are great numbers that bear Arms more for company than conscience, more for
spoil and plunder than for the Cause which they seem to stand for; some
plunged deep in Debts run to the Wars for Acquittances, and perhaps pay their
Creditours with cutting their throats; some servants and Apprentices turn raw
Soldiers, to free themselves from their Master's command; some Fellons,
Ravishers, Man slayers and Murderers, run to the Wars to escape the Hangman;
and of all these virtuous sorts of Vermin is the Cavillers whole Force
compacted, whose Leaders and Abetters are ambitious, pernicious, avaritious,
malicious, seditious, not caring how long these miserable calamities of War
endure, so that by their Tricks, Sleights, Votes, Excises, Plunderings,
Robberies, and extorting Taxations, they make England like a Mill, and
themselves (like thievish Millers) may imperiously and securely take trible
Toll of the Goods and Estates of all the English Protestants, and loyallest
Subjects in the Kingdom, or of as much as their usurping Power can lay hold
on. But their zealous Pulpit men have so rooted them in the rudiments of
Rebellion, that they are persuaded that their Cause is meritorious, their being
beaten is victorious, and if they be killed, their deaths are glorious; but if
they understood, that he that desperately runs himself into forbidden
wickedness (as Rebellion and Treason is) does precipitate himself into
needless dangers, and if he catch his death in the action, (for ought I know)
he is so far from a reward of future glory, as any of the Devils Martyrs are
from eternal happiness.

Moreover the Cavalier has a natural and earnest desire to better his
condition, he has that discretion as not to wish himself worse to day than he
was yesterday, and desires to be better to morrow than he is to day; whilst
the Caviller follows the Devil's rule, that as he has been bad, so it is his
safest way to be worse, and that to be worst of all is his securest defense,
his surest Guard being to defend old wickednesses with new villainies, and
former transgressions with quotidian iniquities, for many do go to the Wars,
not to lose their old faults but to gain fresh and new ones; and as the
Caviller holds himself to be a Subject out of courtesy not conscience; so the
Cavalier does know himself bound to be a true Liegeman to his King, not out of
courtesy but conscience. The caviller amplifies the casual slips and frailties
of other men, and selfe-flatteringly extenuates his own gross enormities, he
is quicke-sighted to spy a mote, but purblinde in discerning a beam, he will
outface a man that the smallest Geneva Print are the greatest Capital Letters,
and that the roaring voice of sientor, is but the squeling of a Pigmie; the
Cavalier knows his own faults to be greatest, and could be as contented to be
quiet honorably, as to fight valiantly, he has honest and unstained
reputation besides a life to lose; whilst the Cavillers and their memorable
Members of infamous and impious remembrances may bravely persist in Rebellion,
for they have nothing to lose that is good, except the stolen Goods of the King
and Kingdoms; they cannot lose Honor, for that is lost already, and forfeited
by Rebellion and most horrid Treason; they cannot lose a Gentleman, for their
Gentility is gone hand in hand with the lost Honor; they cannot lose a
Protestant, for they have none of that Religion to be killed, except they
murder them; nor can they lose a good Subject, for there is not one in their
Armies: they may lose Traitors, Rebels, Thieves, Anabaptists, Brownists,
Libertines, Hypocrites, Schismatickes, Separatists, Cheaters, and Cuckolds, but
for them to lose an honest man is as impossible as to paint an Echo, or make
the Moon a new Coat.

So that in this case the Cavaliers are at an exceeding great disadvantage, to
fight with those unkind kind of Creatures, for they adventure Pearls against
Pebles, and Gold to Dirt, a thousand pound to a nut-shell, and a large Kingdom
to a small Molehill.

Indeed the inveterate hatred and malice of the Cavillers is no longer than
they live, but (in their own life time) it extends toward the dead, for they
have barbarously entered into Churches, (which are dedicated to the Service of
God, and consecrated only for pious and Divine Services) and there they have
not only torn and broken down all Ornaments of Order and comely Decency, but
also they have rased Tombs, Sepulchers, Statues, Monuments, Bones,
Eschucheons, Arms, Hatchments, and any thing that was either erected,
engraven, carved, or insculped as most reverend Memories of the dead, the least
part of which irreligious inhumanity would never have entered into the thought
of the most savage Heathens, Pagans, Infidels, Cannibals, Atheists,
Anthropophagi or Devils.

But note, and with horror and trembling consider, how the Divine Vengeance
has suddenly confounded some of those malicious or mislead Wretches, a few of
which fearful Examples I will truly relate.

It is not long since, that a sincere senseless Churchwarden at the Town of
Teuxbury (in the year of his Reign) caused a stone-Crosse in the Churchyard
to be pulled down, and in the upper part of it, wherein was graven or carved
the Figures of our Savior's remembrance Crucified, with the Forms of two
persons weeping at the foot of the Cross, in memory of the extreme greifes and
dolours which then afflicted the blessed Virgin, and Evangelist Saint John;
which part of the Cross M. Churchwarden caused to be hewn by a Mason into a
Hog-trough, (he being of the race of the Gadarens, and loved his Swine better
than any memory of his Redeemer) but within two or three days all his Hogs
and hoggish Beasts were stricken dead, his Wife ran mad, his Children, one was
drowned, and himself struck with a miserable languishing Disease, and died a
wretched spectacle, or admirable miracle of misery.

Another that boldly adventured to climb up to pull down the Cross in
Cheap Side, but he slipped his hold-fast, and fell with his ribs upon the
iron pikes or grate which encompast the Cross, so that he was wounded to death
with the fall.

Also, at Worcester, a fellow would take upon him to tear down the Organs, and
he fell from the top of them down upon the pavement of the Church, and brake
his bones, that he presently died.

Moreover, in Oxford, when the Rebelis were there 1642. they most insolently
marched through the Streets, and impiously one of their Dragoones shot at the
Figures of our Savior, and the blessed Virgin, and with the shot beat and
battered off the heads and faces of the harmless Figures, but he presently
fell from his Horse, to the great endangering of a neck-breaking.

Another, the same time shot at the Similitude of Christ, over the Gate of
All-Soule: College, and his Piece brake and split and shivered his hand in
pieces.

Also at Merton College, another impudent Varlet did the like, but his
powder-bagge being open, a spark of his Match fell into it, which set fire on
his Powder, and blew out both his eyes. And but for two of these three
Villainies, I would not have mentioned any of them, but that I knew one Master
Thomas Rogers a Chirurgian (deceased) in Oxford, had them in Cure, and he whose
hand was torn was cured (though maimed) the other had one of his eyes
recovered: and these Examples are sufficient to deter and hold men's hands
from impious Sacrilege.

Moreover (to seasen all the rest) I must not omit the zeal of a devout
Brother, whose name is Francis Beale, (dwelling in the Axe-yard in Kings
Street, Westminster.) this Beale was sometimes an Ale-house-keeper and
Tobacco-man, that with pot and pipe, nicke, froath, puff, and whiffe, gat a
devilish deal of money, by punishing, cheating, and beggering of Drunkards;
then he gave over that kind of life, and was a Porter to the Lady Kincleavin,
since when he is turned Gentleman, and contributary bountiful Rebel; this
Beale has a son at man's estate, (a proper honest man) who left father, mother,
Sectarisme and Rebellion, and has long served in His Majesty's Army, (which
his father and mother hold to be Apostasy) and she good old Gentlewoman, with
grief and sorrow that her son was so undutifull as to be a Protestant, and a
good Subject, she caused a Bill to be written to have him prayed for in the
Church, which Bill was delivered in Martin's Church near Chearing-Crosse, to
the famous Master Case, the Lecturer there on Thursdayes; the Form of the Bill
was as follows. These are to desire you to take into your Christian
considerations the grief and sorrow of one Mistress Beale of Westminster, whose
son Francis Beale is fallen away from grace, and serves the King in his Wars.
Wherefore she most humbly beseeches the prayers of this Congregation, that he
may return and be converted. But this kind Gentlewoman was not so fixed to
Brownisme, Anabaptisme, or Round-headisme, but that within these few years she
was in hope that her hypocritical going to hear Mass at the Queens Chapel
at Denmark House, would have been the means to have made her either a Nurse,
a Rocker, or a necessary Chairewoman to the Duke of Gloucester, but though she
failed of her Office, there was an old Knight, with a great feather, no hair,
and so much wit that he entertained her all night (for her better edification
in the Catholic Cause) in imitation of the Sign where she dwelt, [An Axe
cutting of a Feather] by this you may perceive how constant the Creature is in
any Religion. I have read that George, King of Bohemia, and John, King of
Hungaria, were at deadly War for Religion, and after much blood shed, the
Kings having each of them a Fool or a Jester, they agreed that their Fools
should have a single Combat at Buffets, and which of them wan the Victory at
Cuffes, that both the Kings should be of the same Religion with the Conqueror;
and such as this was the zeal of Mistress Beale and many thousands more
shallow-brain'd, malicious, ignorant, and seduced people that are Rebels for
Religion, when as (God knows) there is no Religion for Rebellion, nor can they
show any Reason why or wherefore they are thus mad against all obedience,
order, and loyalty to God and their Sovereign.

But as poor silly Sheep run all together,
And in confusion send they know not whether;
So those mad People, pray, disburse, and fight,
Not knowing truths from lies, or wrong from right:
The Multitude like Dogs with open jaws,
One bawles cause the other barks, yet knows no cause:
Ask Rebels what is the reason they rebel,
And ask Dogs why they bark, They cannot tell.
Thus with the deluding and threatenings of lying Lecturers, and princed Lies,
the Gates of London are shut and guarded so strongly, that Truth or Honesty can
get no entrance, for it is a most dangerous thing for a Protestant or a true
subject to live there; they may be perhaps persuaded to have a King, but they
would have that King to have no Kingdom, they might be brought to call Him
their Sovereign Lord, but withal that he shall be without any Dominion, and
they may be entreated to be called his subjects, provided that he will be
subject to them; but I advise them, that as they have made bold to call
themselves a Parliament, and been bolder to make a counterfeit Great Seal, so
they may fill up the measure of their iniquities, and (by Master Prinnes Law)
by as good right make a fresh and new counterfeit King; or if no man will be so
impudent or insolent to accept it, take a suit of John Pym's clothes well
brushed, picked, and lowsed, and stuff it with straw, which being placed in
the Throne will be a suitable Sovereign to support the power of your Seal,
Orders, Votes, and pretended Sovereign Power of your Vtopian Parliament. If
rebellious and bewitched London would with her many headed, mislead Beasts, but
examine themselves truly of two things, they would then perceive what falsities
the grand Cavillers have blinded them withal, and to what misery their
cavilling has brought them, and (if God prevent not) will bring them into
irremediable destruction. The first thing I wish them to call their consciences
to an account of, is, why they were Rebels at all? The second is, wherefore
they do obstinately and execrably continue in Rebellion? If every Caviller
would catechize himself, they would find that they have wandered in vanity,
and followed after Lies. They would hang down their heads with shame, and
acknowledge themselves worthy to be hanged for their treacherous disobedience,
and open hostile Treasons against so good and gracious a Sovereign, they would
then consider to what a ruinous Desolation they have brought this famous
flourishing Kingdom, whose Government was admired and honored through the
whole world; till now of late a multitude of mis-begotten and worse bred
Rebels have done their best and worst to bring all to confusion. For which
wicked purposes they have made bold to make Mercury their counterfeit post,
poste-horse and pack-horse, who under the names of Civicus, Britannicus,
Scoutes, Scottish Pigeons, and other pretty, ill-contrived, sweet, filthy,
sophisticated Titles and Epithites, has beswarmed all the Christian world over
with English Lies, written by as very Villains as could be spewed from the
bottomless Pit, dispersed by as arrant Rogues as ever dropped into the Hangmans
budget, and believed and countenanced by none but malicious Traitors,
superstitious, nosewise Schismatickes, or ignorant logger-heads, the fruits,
and damnable events that have been produced from these Diabolical practices.
Contrarily, the Cavalier knowing his cause just, applies himself only to
Truth, both in fighting and writing, they have used three sorts of Christian
Discipline to the Cavillers, in a charitable desire to conform them. First,
they have given them kind admonitions, wherein they have told them truly, that
the Public Faith in which they have too much confided is no Faith either to
be saved by, or to be made savers; they have further advertised them to beware
of Sects, and believing seditious Counsels, because they were motives to
Rebellion, which is as the sin of Witchcraft, 1 Samuel 15. 23. Secondly, when
Admonition would do no good with these Cavillers the Cavaliers did take a
little stiffer course, and from exhortation they fell to reprehension, telling
them roundly that they were seduced and blinded by fears, flatteries and
jealousies out of their earthly estates and lives, and extremely hazarding the
loss of a better life to come. But when neither kind Admonition, or wholesome
Reprehension would work upon their perfidious and benumbed consciences, then
were the Cavaliers enforced (for their own safety) to take defensive Arms, and
to use the means to save the Cavillers souls, by beating them Northerly,
Westerly, and most brotherly both in Wales and England; and by those ways to
belabour them out of their bad conditions into better manners: to this end and
purpose, the Cavalier party have not only used the Spiritual and Temporal
Swords, but also they have with their pens so banged and basted their
libellous and rebellious forgeries, and ridiculous fopperies, that their
Ballad-makers and Pamphletteers are defunct, the bright luster of Truth has
eclipsed them and gulleries, so that like rotten Sheep they would be glad to
sculke under a hedge for shelter: and it is manifest that the Pen of a true
Writer will cut keener than a Sword, when a lying, scandalous Knave cuts his
own throat with his own Goose Quill.

Of the which scribbling number, the nine times thrice valiant, conquering,
commanding Captain George Withers has written a pretty, foolish, witty,
loyal, traitorous Book called Campo Musae, composed of the two most delicate
Simples, Flattery and Treason: but I leave him and the rest of the railing
Rabble of Rabshekaes to amend or be hanged, and that is a

FINIS.
