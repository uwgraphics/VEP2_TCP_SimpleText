When among other / diverse and sondrie works / which of late days I did read
most blessed father / in this your most famous and goodly lybrary / there came
unto my hands a certain little Greek book / which contained the gift or
grant of Constantyne: I thought it mete and co^uenyent to translate it out of
greek in to latin / and also yt I ought to dedycate or entytle it to your most
holy fatherhed / which are the deputy of Christ / and of Peter / and the
successoure also of Syluester / for because there be many men which have said
and will abide by it / that this gift or grant of Constantyne is false /
counterfeyted and feigned / among whom Laure^ce Valla is one / a man surely
well learned / which presu^tuousli has taken in hand to write a book of the
false and forged gift of Co^stantyne. But his opynyons very well resysteth and
gaynsayth the most reverend Cardynall of Alexandrie / excellently learned and
substa^cially seen in both laws / and also very dilygently confuteth and
dyssolueth the objections made by the said Laure^ce. Parauenture that great
clerk Valla supposed that ye thing which he him self had not read / could
in no place have been found among other men. And no marvel thereof / sei^g
that he was a man of so great mordacite. and all given to checki^g that he has
not ben afraid to check and rebuke Aristotle the chief and pryncipall of all
Philosophers / ye and also / so to find fautes with all ye authors of the
laten tongue / that he has forborne no man. But lest I be to tedyous: let us
now lysten / and here what Constantyne him self says

The decree imperial written and given to the worshypfull and holy Catholyke
and apostolycall church of Rome / by blessed Constantyne / the first among
the emperors that became Christen.
IN the name of the holy and inseparable Trinytie / yt is to wit / the father
the son / and the holy ghost. Caesar Flauius Consta^tyne / in Christ Jesus of
ye same Trinitye our only savior our lord / and our god / the faithful
mylde / and benefycyall Emperor of Almayne / of Gothia / of Sarmatia / of
Germany / of Britayne / and of the Hunnes / godly / prosperous / or fortunate
conqueror / and triumpher / always honorable and full of majesty: to the
most holy and blessed father of fathers / Syluester / bishop and Pope of the
ancient and noble cite of Rome. And to all bisshoppes the successors of him /
sitting in the chair of blessed Peter / even until the end of the world.
Also to all most reverend and devout catholyke bysshoppes subjects / by this
our emperyall co^stytution to this worshipful and holy church of Rome: Grace
peace / love / joy / constaunt mind / and mercy from almighty god / both the
father / and Jesus Christ his son / and also the holyghost be with us all.
Such things as has been wonderfully wrought about our own person / by our
redemer and savior the lord Jesus Christ / which is the son of the most
high father in heuyn / through his mercies / by his holy apostels Peter and
Paul / and through the mean and intercessyon of our father Syluester / the
highest bisshoppe and catholyke or universal pope. We have purposed and
desired to show in order with manifest narration / by this our imperial
writ / that it may come herafter to the knowledge of all people and nations
which are in the world / that the confession ^wlegi^g of ye revelation showed
unto us most (...) within / and from the very heart. (...) declares outwardely
our faith and belefe / which we have learned of the aforsayd most blessed
father and our intercessour Syluester Catholyke pope chief and highest priest /
to the document and instruction of us all. Secondarily it shows also to all
men the large mercy of god / which he has ple^tuously poured and shed forth
upon us. For we will yt all you do know / even so as we have declared unto you
by our pragmatycall constytution aforesaid / that we have renounced and utterly
forsaken the worshyppi^g of ydols / which are dombe and deaf and made with
man's hand / and that we are lepte away from the deuillysshe fayninges and
false ymaginatyons / and from all the pomp of Satan / and are humbly
descended to the hole and parfyte pure faith of christen men / which is the
true light and life eternal / as our high and most reverend father and
master Syluester / him self has taught us / co^maundynge us to believe on god
the father almighty maker of heuyn and of earth / of all creatures visyble and
vnuisyble / and on Jesus Christ the only begoten son of him / our lord / by
whom all things have been created and made / and on the holy ghost that
quickens and gives life to every creature. we do so and in such wise
confess and knoledge the father the son / and the holy ghost / as that in
the perfyte Trinyte is both the perfeccyon of the godhed / and unity of power
and might. The father is god / the son is god / the holyghost is god / and
these three persons are all one substance. Three forms than ar there and but
only one power. Than after that he had fynysshed the creatyon of the heavenly
powers / and of all erthely material substa^ces: by ye merciful power and
will of his wisdom / he first formed man of the slyme of the earth /
resemblaunt to the image and symilytude of his own self. And after he had so
formed him / he set him in paradyse a place of pleasure / at whom and whos^
felycite the serpent and old enemy the devil having envy / through the most
bitter and miserable tastyng of the fruit of a tree forbidden / caused hi^ to be
outlawed and banysshed from that mirth / joy / and pleasure. And after he
had caused him so to be expulsed from thence / he ceassech not by his
mortyferous and dedly darts / many manner ways to wound other men / to the end
yt he might draw away mankind from the way of the troth / and persuade all
men and bring them in mind to be servants to the worshyppyng of ydoles /
that is to say / of the creatures and not of the creator and maker of them / to
then tent that whom so ever he shall be able by his craftye gyles to blind /
and to entangle in his snares / he may cause them to be ponyshed with eternal
pain. But god taki^g mercy and te^dre pity upon his creature / who^ his own
self had formed and made / sent his holy prophets / and by them showed and
gave knolege of the light of life / that is to wit / the coming of his son
/ our lord / and savior god / Jesus Christ. And last of all he sent also his
only begoten son the word of wisdom / which came down from heuyn for
our health and saluatyon / and was begoten of the holy ghost / and of the
vyrgyn Mary. The word of god was made man / and has dwelled among us / not
leauyng that / which he was before / but taking on him to be / that that he was
not before / that is to wyrte / being both parfyte god / so as he was before /
and parfyte man also / which he was not before. And as god he wrought miracles
and wonders / and as man / he suffered and bear the infyrmytes belongyng to the
nature of man. Thus we understand the word or son of god to be man / and
the same word also to be god. And it is in no wise to be douted / that ye same
is both very god and very man / according to the doctrine and teaching of our
father Syluester. he than chosyng.xii. Apostles gave to them the light of
knoledge / and power to work miracles and strange things above the course of
nature / that by them innumerable people might be taught and brought to belefe
of the trauthe. We confess and knowledge / that this our lord Jesus Christ
has fulfilled the laws and the prophets / and that he suffered passion / and
was crucified fulfylli^g the scryptures / that he did rise again from death
the third day / and that he ascended into heuyn / and there does sytte on
the right hand of the father / and that from thence he shall come to judge
both quick and dedde / whose kingdom shall never have end. This is our true
and right belefe / showed and told before to us / by our most blessed father
Syluester. we do therefore advertise and counsel all people / and all manner of
natyo^s / to embrace and hold fast this faith / to have it in honor /
exercise it / to teach and preche it / and in the name of the holy trinite /
to come unto the gift of baptism / and with a reverent heart and mind to
worship and honor our lord and savior Jesus Christ / which with the father
and the holyghost / raygneth worlds without end. And whom our most blessed
father Syluester Catholyke and universal pope or hedde priest does preche and
teache for the very same lord Jesus christ having pite and compassion upon me a
sinner / did send his holy Apostels to vysyte us / and has illumynated and
lyghtened us with ye light of his brightness / and withdrawi^g and taking a
way darkness / has vouchedsafe / me to come to the knowledge of the trauth /
for a great foul and abhomynable leprie was run over all the flesh of my
body / and many leches and phisycio^s resortyng unto me / did their utter most
cure to have heled me / but yet could I not by the labor or dylygence of any
of them obtain remedy of my disease / and to be made hole. Besides this there
came to me also ye priests of the Capitoly house sayng that a Cesterne might
be made in the capitoly house / and be filled with the hot blood of innoce^tes
/ and that I must be bathed therein / by which bathi^ge (they said) I might
recover health / and be cleansed from that foul and horrible disease /
according therefore to the counsayles of them / when many innocente younglynges
and babes were sought and brought together / and the wicked and cruel prestes
without all pity / would have cut the throtes of them / and so with the blood
of them have filled the cestrene: our gratyouse highness with tender pytie
beholding the lamentable weeping and waylyng of their mothers / forthwith did
abhor and deedly hate that / so abhomynable and cruel deed. And I than
having tender co^passyon upon the said women / commanded the children to be
delivered again to the remothers / and lettyng them have waggans / and such
other things mete for the coryage of their children / and also gyui^g them
gifts: sent them again ioyonse and glad to their own houses and dwelling
places. When this day was ended and past / and restyng time of the night came
on / and oportunyte provoked me to sleep / and to take rest: suddenly the holy
Apostels Peter and Paul were hard by me / and said these words to me.
Because thou dyddest not suffer the priests to perform their sinful purpose
/ but dyddest abhor the effucyon and shedyng of innoce^tes blood: we are sent
to the from Christ our lord and god / to give the counsel / how / and by
what means thou shall recover thy health / harken therefore to our message / and
do that thing which we do counsel and teache the to do. The bishop of
this cite / Syluester / fleyng the persecutyons: has hid secretly in dens
of stones / with his clerks / in the mount of Soracte. This Syluester thou
shalt cause to be fetched unto the / and by his instruction thou shall learn
and know the true cesterne of Christ's professyon / in the which cestrene
after that thou shall be dypped thryse: all the poison of thy leprye shall leave
the and go clear from the / which thing done: make thou again of thy part /
this recompense to thy savior / that by thy co^maundimentes thou do renew all
the churches in the world / and in this behalf / purge and cleanse thou thine
own self / that forsakyng all the wretchedde worshyppynge of ydoles: thou
may love / honor / and worship only him / which alone is the living
and the true God / and fulfylle his will and pleasure. Than wha^ I was wakened
out of my sleep / I did even so as I was taught of the Apostels to do / and
sendyng for the heyghest and most excellent father Syluester / Catholyke Pope
/ which has illumynated us / and given us light. I declared to him all the
words / that the holy Apostels had said to me / and what they had bydden me
do / and I demau^ / ded of him what gods they were / which are called Peter
and Paul. And he said / that they were not properly called gods: but he
said / that they were Apostels of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

I began than again to deman^de of the same most blessed Pope / whether there
were any parfyte and euydent images of these Apostels / that by the pyctures
might know / if it were possible / that they were the very same / whom we
learned them to be by revelation Than that father worthy of all reverence /
commanded the images of these holy Apostels to be brought to me / by his own
propre deacon and mynister / which when I beheld and perceived in the images
very well / the aspectes and likeness of them / whom I had seen in my sleep /
with a great loud voice I confessed in the presence of my dukes and noble
estates / that these were the very same persons / whom I saw in my sleep.
Than forthwith this our most blessed father Syluester / bishop of the cite of
Rome / appointed to us a certain time of penance / in which I should wear a
sherte of hear within our palyce of Laterane / that we might pacifye or
appease the wrath of our lord god and our savior / for all things which
has been wickedly wrought / and unjustly done by us: with fastings /
watchynges / wepynges / and prayers.

Afterward / clerks layeng their hands upon me / I came to the pope him
self / and there renouncing the pompes of the devil and his works / and all
ydols made with man's hand: I confessed of mine own free will / in presence
of all the people / that I believe in one god father almightye / maker of heuyn
and of earth / of all a visyble and inuysyble things. And in one lord Jesus
Christ / the only begoten son^e of god / our lord / which was begotten of the
holyghost / and of Mary the virgyn. Than after that he had hallowed the font or
lauacre of baptyme / with his holy blessyng / he purifyed the water which was
therein to put. In to the which fou^tayne or baptistory so sone as I was set
/ I saw with my own eyes a hand touching me from heuyn / by which hand
(when I rose up) I parceyued and knew my self to be cle^sed and purifyed from
all the fowlnesse and vncie^nesse of leprie. And when they had taken me out of
that holy bathe / they did put on me white garments. and he gave me the
carecte or mark of ye seuenfolde grace of the holy ghost / by a noyncyng me
with holy oil, and he marked the sign and token of the holy cross in my
forhed / sayng these words: God seals or marketh the with ye seal of his
faith / in the name of the father and of the son / and of the holyghost / and
all the clergy answered / and said. Amen. And the pope said also Pax tibi.
Peace be to the. The first day after that I had received the sacrament of holy
baptysme / and that I was cured and healed in my body from leprie. I knew that
there is none other god / besides the father / and son / and holyghost /
whom the most blessed father Syluester preaches.iii. persons in one god. and
one god in.iii. persons: for all the gods of the gentyles and panyms / whom
I have honored here to fore / are manyfestly showed and declared to be deuyls
and the works of men's hands. Than the said holy father him self plainly
declared to us / how great power and authoryte the same our savior has given
to his chosen Apostell blessed Peter / both in heuyn and in earth / when after
that he had found him faithful in answeryng to his demand / he said to
him. Thou art Peter / and upon this stone I will bylde my church / and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Consider you men of great power
and might / and attend and take good head with the ears of your hertes and
minds / what ye good master and lord added more besides this to his own
dysciple / saying. And I will give to the: the kayes of the kingdom of heuyn /
and what so ever thou shall bind upon earth / it shall be bounden also in heuyn.

This is a marvelous word and full of power / both to bind and lose so upon
earth / yt the same shall be bounden and losed likewise in heuyn. We therefore
having knowledge of these things / by thinstruction of blessed Syluester / and
parceyuing or felyng parsyte health / to be comen again to our body / through
the benefycence of the same blessed Peter: thought and iuged it mete and
according our self with all other dukes / earls / and our counsaylours / and
the other noble estates / and also with the hole people being under the
dominion of the empire of Rome / that as blessed Peter appears to have been
constytuted / ordained / and made by the son of god his deputy in earth / so
like wise the successors of the prince of the Apostels should take and receive
of us and of our empire / gretter prerogatyue of power given to them / than our
serenite and also empire is known of all men to have in earth / for we have
elect and chosyn the prince of Apostels him self / and his true successoures
/ to be patrons and intercessours for us to god / and we have decreed to
honor and worship with reverence his sacredde and holy church of Rome:
even so as our emperyall power is worshypped in earth / and to exalte the most
holy see of blessed Peter / more than our own empire and te^porall dignyte /
gyueng to it power and preferment of royalty / strength / and effycacie and
high honor emperyall. And we decree and establysshe / that it have the
dominion and chief governance upon the four chief and principal sees:
Antioche / Alexandrie / Constantinople / and Jerusalem. Also upon all the
co^gregatio^s and churches of god / through out the hole world. and the
bisshoppe of that high and holy church of Rome for the time being / to be
principal and heed of all priests which are in the hole world / and that
all things whereof cure ought to be taken for the worshippyng of god / or the
corrobora^yng and enstrengthyng of the christen faith / be governed and ordered
by the judgment of him / for it is right that the heed of power and
principalyte should there have his holy laws and ordynaunces: where our
sauyoure the maker of holy laws / commanded saint Peter to have the chair of
his apostelshyppe / and where Peter him self following his master and lord
bare his cross drinking that bitter draughte of glorious death. There
contynually and even to the end of the world / let them seche their master
where the holy body of their maistre rests. There let people and nations of
paynims bow down their necks for ye confession and knoleging of the name of
Christ where their master and techer the apostel Paul stretching forth his
neck for Christ's sake / was crowned with the garlonde of martyrdom. There
and in that place / let them humbly and lowlye submytte them selves to the
obsequie and service of god the heuynly king / and savior Jesus Christ: where
before they did service to the proud power of an erthely king or governor.
For which causes and co^syderations / we will that all people through out the
world do know that we within our palyce of Laterane / have builded a temple
/ to the honor of god our suaioure and lord Jesus Christ: even from the very
foundation with a font to baptyse in. And know you also / that we did bear
out from thence upon our own sholders xii. baskettes full of earth in the
worship of the.xii. Apostels being.xii. also in nombre. and we have also
edifyed churches in the honor of blessed Peter and Paul the chief apostels /
goodly decked and garnyshed with gold and silver / where also we buryeng the
most holy and worshypfull bodies of them with great reverence have builded and
made them shrynes of ambre / such as neither fire ne water can destroy. And we
have put in through either of the shrynes a cross made of most pure gold
and of precious stones / and have fasted it with nails of gold. And to the
same churches / for the contynuaunce and mayntynau^ce of lyghtes within ye
same: we have given possessions and lands / and by our emperyall and heygh
commandment / we have granted to them our lyberte in the eest and west / and
in the north and southe clymates / that is to wit / in Iurye / in Asya /
Grecelande / Aphrike / Italye / and in diverse ylelandes / in such manner and
wife / that all manner things shall be dysposed and ordered by the hands of our
most blessed father pope Syluester and his successors. Let all people
therefore rejoice with us / we admonysshe and counsel all kinds of people and
nations in the world / that they confess and give infynite thanks with us to
our savior Jesus Christ / for that he being god in heuyn above / and in earth
underneath / when he had vysyted us by his holy apostles: made us worthy to
receive the holy sacrament of baptysme / and health of our body / for the
which things / also we give to the holy apostles selves and my lords most
blessed Peter and Paul / and by them to Syluester our father and highest
bishop and catholyke pope of the cite of Rome and to all bysshoppes his
successors sitting in the chair of blessed Peter / even unto the end of the
world / and at this present time do deliver up / first the palace of Laterane
our emperyall place which is the most royal and goodly palace (surmou^ting all
other palaces) that are in the world. Next after it our dyademe / that is to
say / the crown belongyng to our heed. Likewise we deliver up our phrigiu^ /
that is to say yt which is called of the Romans mitra. Further more our
superhumerall / I mean that which is put about our imperyall neck. Also a
purple robe and a purple coote / and all the indumentes and apparayle
belonging to an emperor / and the dygnyte of the emperyall knights and
lords going before him / geuyng moreover to him the emperyall sceptres / and
therewith also the arms and badges / and diverse ornaments emperyall / and all
the glory and power of the most high emperyall majesty / in pompes and
processyons / and to the most reverend men clerks after diverse ordres and
degrees / seruyng this worshipful and holy church of Rome. We ordain decre /
and establysshe / that they have that attendaunce and propertye of power and
prehemine^ce / with all the glory and majesty / wherewith our most noble
senatoures are seen to be adourned / that is to say / that they be made lords
of the city and heed officers. Also we publysshe and openly pronounce / that
they be adourned with the other dygnyties emperyall / and as the imperial host
or army is adourned: even so also we have decreed / that the clergy of the
church of Rome be decked and adourned / and likewise as the emperyall power
and majesty is put to honor with diverse offices of chau^berlaynes / porters
/ and watch men or guard: so we will / that the holy church of Rome be
decked and garnysshed with ye same offices. And we decree / that the dygnytie
of the pope most largely do shine above all other / and that the prestes of
the same holy church of Rome / do ride upon horses trapped with napkyns / and
fine white towels of lynen clothe / and as our senatoures do wear shoes / Cum
vdonibus: that is to say / adourned with most white lynen clothe: even so we
will them to be / that the heavenly things may so be decked and garnysshed
like the erthly things / to the praise and honor of god. And above all / we
give license to that our most holy father Syluester / bishop of the cite of
Rome / and pope / and to all other most blessed popes / which shall in times
herafter succeed him / for the honor and glory of our lord Jesus Christ / in
this great Catholyke or universal power. if he be willing to reckon or
account any of our circumspecte senators / among relygious clerks: that
none of them which are called there unto through pride / shall make excuse / or
refuse to take this order. We ordain and establysshe this also / that the
father Syluester / pope worthy all manner reverence / and all popes his
successoures / ought to wear the dyademe / that is to say the crown / which
we do give to him from our own heed / made of most pure and fine gold and
preciouse stones and perles / and to wear it on their hedes to the glory of
god / for the reverence of blessed Peter. And because the most blessed pope
himself has been a shamed to were the crown of gold upon the crown of his
preesthod / and on the tonsure or shauynge of his heed / which he has for
the reverence of saint Peter: we therefore with our own hands have put on his
most holy heed / this phrigium / representyng and sygnifyeng the most bright
white color of it / the gloryouse resurrection of our lord / and holding the
bridle of his horse / for the reverence of blessed Peter: we have covered his
horse. And we do ordain and decree / that all his succssoures / each one of
the^ after other / do wear the same phrigiu^ in processyons to the ymitation
and following of our empire / wherefore yt the high dignity of ye pope debate
not / but that he being worthy / may be decorated and adourned both with glory
and power more than onye earthly king or governor. Gyueng of the palace and
cite of Rome.
Behold here we give up as we have said before / our palace / and the cite of
Rome and the prouynces / places / and the cities of all Italy and of the west
regyons / to the often rehearsed our most blessed father Syluester Catholyke pope
/ and releasynge them to the power and judgment of him and of his successors
popes. We have decreed by our divine pragmaticall constitution / that they be
disposed by the same popes / and we grant them to remain and continue
always to the right and title of the holy church of Rome / wherefore we have
iuged it conuenyent and according / to translate our empire / and the glory
thereof / to the Eest regions / and buyldyng in the city Byzantium (which is
a very good place) a city in our own name: there to constitute and set our
empire / thynkyng it unmeet / unseemly / and against right / that any erthlye
king should have any power and auctoryte there / where the chief prelacie of
priests / and the heed of the Christen relygion / has been constituted and
ordained to be / by the heavenly king. These things therefore by this our and
sacred writ and other emperyall decrees determined / and corroborated: we
have ordained and decreed to continue in full strength / and not to be revoked
neither in the hole / neither in any part of them / unto the end of the
world: wherefore before the living god / which has commanded and wylled us to
govern and reign / and before his terrible and dredefull judgment. We beseech
all our successors the emperors / all our dukes and noble estates: also the
most worshipful senatoures / and all the people which be in the hole world:
that none of them in any manner wise neither now / neither in any time to come
/ do break or mynisshe this our grant or privilege in / any point thereunto
belonging. And if any man shall be (which thing we do not suppose) that shall
either break / or contemn and despyce this our decree: subject and bond lie
he to eternal co^demnations. and I pray god that he may find and feel the
saints of god and chief apostles Peter and Paul / contrary and aduersares to
him / and punisshed be he in the lowest and depest pit of hell / and
banisshed be he for ever from the sight of god / and eternally might he dye
with the devil and all wicked men. we also roboratig and strengthing letters
patentes of this our e^peryall decree with our own hand: have laid it up our
self upon the honorable corpse or body of blessed Peter prince and chief of the
apostles / promisyng there to the apostle of god / that we our self will keep
all these things partytly in every point / and also that by our commandment
and decree we do leave them to be observed and kept of our successoures that
shall be emperoures / and yt they shall (our lord god and savior Jesus Christ
mercifully grauntyng) remain perpetually / prosperously / and peasably / in
possessyo^ to our blessed father Siluester and Catholyke pope / and by him to
all his successoures popes / by our imperial subscriptyon. The godheed
conserve and keep you many years and long / most holy and most blessed
fathers. yeuen at Rome / the.xxvii. day of February / our lord Flauius
Constantinus Augustus and Gallycanus. etc.

Here ends the decree of Co^stantyne.
The preface of Vdalrike Hutten / upon the little book made by Laurence Valla
/ against the feigned and falsely forged donation or gift of Constantyne / unto
pope Leo the tenth of that name.
AT the last most blessed father / your noble and comfortable promise / which
by your commandment was expressed / publysshed / and set forth at the very
begynni^g / when you were newly made pope: has vanquesshed and perfitely
ouerco^e the opinyon of those persons / which did dissuade and frayde men
away from publysshyng and sendyng forth abroad of the little book made by
Laurence Valla / against the donation and grant of Co^stantyne / for now
seeing that you have ones caused that marcyall triumph to keep silence /
wherewith pope July the second provoked and styred up men to war and battle
/ and as it were by stryki^g a cymbale of peace / have raised up the hertes and
minds of all christen people / unto the hoope of liberte: All men do reckon
and suppose / that them selves may use all things / which they know to be
laufull. And I verily of my part / albeit that I was before persuaded and in
full belefe / if it should fortune and chance you to have this most high
auctorite and governance over all / for asmoch as you have always / so and in
such wise loved and exercised the studies of best letters / that your
profyting and going forward in the^ / may with out dout be compared with the
doctrine of the best learned men that be in this time / that you would not
suffer any of the monume^tes or works made by ancient authors in old time to
perisshe / and to be utterly lost and cast away whiles you were pope / yet
natwithsta^ding when I red that inscriptyon or title openly set forth in
Italy. Leoni decimo pontifici maximo restauratori pacis / which is thus much
to say in english.

To Leo the tenth pope / the renewer of peace: I leapte up suddenly / being
wonderfully styred with a sudden joy / and comforted / and restored again to
my self / from that passion and unquietness of my mind / wherein I had before
continued a long season by the reason yt I saw this nation did suffer many
greuouse and shamfull things under tyra^nuouse and cruel popes. I am therefore
right joyful and glad for their sakes / which are living in this time /
which by you / as it were by a most lucky star of peace spro^ge^ up or ryse^
/ now after so long darkness of tyranny beholds and looks up to the new
light of lyberte / and you are a very pope in deed / which do bring peace /
but your predecessors / which had not this peace: Popes bei^ge warriers are
no popes at all.
Were no popes at all / for they did not follow Christ / which gave peace to
his discyples / and left the same as inherytaunce unto them / saying these
words. Io. 14.
My peace I do give to you my peace I do leave to you. Peace was thynherita^ce
which Christ gave and left to his apostles.

Popes making war / ar not the vicars but the aduersarys and enemies of
Christ.

The works of Christ and of certain popes compared togider.


And therefore also they were not his vycars / whose sted and office they did
not keep or fulfill / for they kingdom of god is to keep peace / but rather
they were clean contrary and enemies to Christ / whose studies or works they
have dispysed / and have followed a contrary kind or manner of living / for
peace belongs to him: and they desired and followed wars and batayls. He
studied to save men by his doctrine and teaching / and they labored busely to
kill and destroy men / with weapons of war. He showed his kingdom to be
heavenly / and they first of al / and most chefely sought the empiers of the
world. Therefore neither they were blessed: because they were not peaceable or
maynteners of peace. Neither were they the sons of god / for Christ says.
Blessed are the peceable persons: Mat. v.
for they shall be called the sons of god. Lo / tha^ by you most blessed
father is restored and renewed the peace / which through their peruersyte was
said to have had a great fall and decay. And this peace most chefly and in
especyal learned men / have received with great joy by your benefyte and
gift. Secondarely / they also very desyrously have embraced the same peace:
The co^modytees ensuyng of peace and tranquillyte.
from whom many things had been unjustly taken away by fraud and gyle / for
with peace is come also justice through your restoryng / for according to the
saying of the prophet / now chefly in this time. Psalm. 84.
Righteousness and peace has kyssed to gyther. Faith or fydelyte is come
also / and that daughter of time / that is to wit / verite or truth: Verite
is the daughter of time.
she is come also / and the virtues belonging to kings and governors / that
is to wit / mercy and mekenes are come also plentuously. Do you se here /
Mercy and myldnesse / ar virtues belo^gynge to gouernoures and rulers.
O Leo the tenth / of how many good things and co^modytes at ones / you have been the author and begynner? you by bringyng of peace / have also with it
brought in the studies of peace / that is to say / the studies of the best
arts and sciences. you have also restored rightuousenes / for in peace are
laws / and by the laws is justice caused. you have also brought again
lyberte whom truth accompanyeng: has been her self also greatly profitable
to the men of your time / for where tyranny is / there can be no peace /
Tyranny excludes al virtues and commodities.
because there is no fydelyte or trustines / neither can there be any justice
or ryghtuousnesse: for as much as every man has not that which is his own
/ and because tyrants done oppress the laws. Neither it is laufull there to
say the truth: by cause there is no lyberte. But now we ben very free / and
at lyberte in deed: because we have peace / which we having: shall have and
use also the studies of peace. So than / this tranquilyte / which could not be
had in the time of Julius the author of wars / we will now use under you /
the restorer and renewer of peace / that we may rest quietly in the study of
good letters. Therefore now let it come forth to light / if any thing has been
long time hid / and let every thing come forth so much the more boldly /
by how much it is more truly and more sincerely and faithfully written / of
which sort is this book / which other popes therefore have not suffered:
because they would not here ye troth / but you shall therefore love it /
because you have now before begone to us of ye cup of troth / for what
pertayneth yt to you being a pope of better co^sience / yt they said this book
to have been written against ye dygnite of ye ecclesyasticall estat? or yt they
said yt it did speak yuel and rayled against popes / for verily neither they
were popes / They were no very popes / that fayn^d the gift or grant of
Co^stantyne.

Neither it (...) a right church that received the ^^ne grant.


which feigned and forged the donation of Co^stantyne / because they were not
pastors or herdesmen. Neither it was a church / which received and admytted
it / because it was not a congregation of faithful christen men / for if they
had been herdesmen: they would have fed the sheep of Christ / and not have
invaded and devoured them. And if it had been a church: truly it would have
called people to life and lyberte / and not have drawn violently empiers and
nations under yoke and bondage. For thus speaks the church. Come to me all you
yt do lust and desire after me / and be you fulfilled of my generatio^s.
Certainly she fylleth (I mean the church) whomsoever she has received / but
that congregation of wicked men / did empty and make bare those / whom they
received. Moreover Christ badde his vicars. Io. the.21 The successors of Peter
(...) to (...)
Be good herdesmen / and not rauenouse and gredy deuouryng woolues. For he
said in this wise to Peter. Peter love thou me? If thou do Feed my sheep.
He said. Feed my sheep / and not devour my people: P^al. ^.
even so as thou would devour the substance of a lofe of breed. And when he
called them to the apostleshyppe: ^
he said. I shall make you fysshers of men / that is to say / I shall make you
/ that by preaching and good ensamples gyuing / you shall allure and draw unto
the truth / such men as done err and wandre from they faith / which thing
because you do follow / most blessed father: we are glad / and do greatly
rejoice / that this order is returned again to their office and duty /
through your causyng and bringing it to pass / by the reason that Peace / that
liberty / that justice / and verite by your means are called and brought
again / for what more merry voice / or what more sweet or more pleasant word
might be herd than this: I mean the restoryng of peace. So than with little
business / that is to wit with one little word set forth: you have taken
away the great indygnation from the minds of men / you have pacifyed and laid
the vehement and houge passions and unquietness of men's minds / and have
disapoynted and put by mischeues and dystructions / and have ceased all
wranglyng and stryfes / where than it should have come to pass (if these
cogitatio^s of men had happened upon an evil pope) that we would by force and
violence have takyn away many things: now by you it is brought to pass /
that quietly restyng / we do obtain all things without any trouble or
business / do you se. O Leo / a very pope in deed / what manner one I do judge
this your deed to be? we may now thank your goodness for the receyte of that
thing: which else was to have been pursued after / and purchased with war and
fyghting / wherefore now let certain persons cease to fear / lest you
will be displeased and misco^tent / if this book be publysshed and sentte
abroad again / by cause those perverse and prepostrouse popes / that have been
before you / have forbidden that any man should have it in his hand / for you
are in no point agreynge or like to them: because they in no point did agree
with Christ / for they under gylefull and coloura^ie deceit / have drawn to
themselves the seculare and worldly empiers. But you / in the sincere and pure
brightness of truth / have opened an heavenly dominatyon / that is to wit /
the kingdom of peace. So than by your mean / Christyan verite begins to
reuyue and quicken again / which where as she has been of long time
oppressed: now takes heart and stomach again / and she / which has been
many a day in captyuite and thraldom: now delivered and brought out again
from that prison and derkenesse: deserves to se light again / upon trust and
boldness whereof / Valla encoraged: dare now rise again from death / and
present himself in to the ears and sight of men / and that so much the
rather also: because he has been in old time / in high favor and love with
your auncestres / of whom as you have received and taken this virtue as it were
by inherytau^ce: even so likewise in other virtues you do not swerve or go out
of kind from them / for likewise as in erudicyon and lernyng / you do resemble
that exellently learned Politian your master and techer: even so in co^dicyons
and manners you a^ nothing unlike to your great grau^dfathers grau^dfather
Cosmus Medices. And likewise as this was his chief praise / yt although he alone
might have done all things in his cite / yet he would not do all that he might
/ Even so let this be your laud / that where as you might reign and rule as an
Emperor / you had leauer keep and save as a pastor or herdesman. But in Cosmus
this was principally worthy marvel and praise / that he being him self not
learned / yet did he love learned men and had them in honor / causing them to
besought forth and brought to him from all places on every side / and socouryng
them with his help / and also with his goods. But Laurence your father / both
loved learned men: and also was himself for his lerning / worthy to be
accounted among the cheyfe learned men of his time. O than this is an happy
family and kynred which has been ordained of god / to the helping / promotyng
/ and fortheryng of good lernyng / for what other stock or kindred is there /
to whom else we be beholden / and whom ought we to thank / as being the causers
of the prosperity and co^modites of this our time. By whose benefyte else is it:
that we have both the greek and also the laten letters revived and restored
again from utter destruction. So that in Italy only / the Florentines are
they which / so great a co^modite or benefit received: ought not to repe^te
them or be ashamed or weary of tirauntes. No dout of it / Valla was derely
beloved of your ancestres / whiles he was a live / therefore / for their
reverence and sakes / he is not to be despised of you: although he be deed /
where than are they / which thought it for to be feared lest you would not
suffer the publysshing and setting forth of this work? as who would say / that
you had at any time received and allowed in your mind / the fraud and crafty
gile of them / which sinfully and cursedly have imagined lies of Constantine /
or else as though this litell book were not such one / that not only it may be
red of all men: but also yt it ought and is necessary and needful to be read
of all men / for asmoch as very great fruit and profit may come of it / whiles
the troth is perfitely known. But some man will happily say / that it is a
co^uicious and a checking book. Troth it is / and therefore it is a good book
/ seeing that it bytterly and sharply rebukes evil men. But they will say
again / it is deuellyssh / cruel / and vncharytable against popes. Nay /
raither against tyran^tes / for if in the cities of Grecelande / it is ordained
and decreed / that they ought to have rewards / which have slain any
tyraunte and rid him out of the world: what reward than shall we give to
them / which do impugn and fight against very tyranny it self: Or if it be
charity and natural / to love our own country. How can it be said / that
he does uncharitably and vnlouyngly / which hates the enemy of it. Were not
those popes the enemies of Christen men / which vyolentlye plucked the riches
and goods of all men / to their own selves? which went about with all
enforceme^t / to bring all free men in to servitude and bondage? and which
despoyled the kings of their empire / and the co^munes of their money? which
did send unto us from Rome / bishops clothed in palles or robes / with so
great loss and damage of our patrimonyes or lyuelodes? Or were they the vicars
of Christ / which did not fulfill his office / of who^ it is written. His
place has been made in peace. psa. lxxv.


Or if they be tyrants / which do take upon them selves to have empire /
dominyon / and rule over men that be free: Who does this thing more than he /
which chalengeth or draws him in to seruytude and bondage / that is the
conseruer and mayntener of lyberte / that is to wit / the prince or emperor of
ye Romans.

Therefore to conclude / Valla speaks not evil against popes / but he speaks
the truth against tyrauntes / and for that cause it ought to be supposed and
thought that he does please you greatly: you (I say) being a man sprongen of
so noble a stock or kyndred: of so noble auncestres / endued also with so
exellent learning / and having also so honorable a name.

There ought not any lie or leasing to be agreing unto any one of the stock
or kyndred of the Medices / and where so greatte learning is: there no
peruersyte can be received or have entrance. And the high and great stomach
of a lion does not suffer or receive unto it self the humilyte or vileness of
fraud or gyle / Leo.
which has always in his mouth this sentence or sayng of the greek poet.
To lie / is an dishonest / a vile / and a knauyshe thing / and belongyng to
villayns. The troth: is an exellent and an honorable thing / appertayni^g to
noble and gentylmen. Besides this / if ever in any thing Valla did show or
declare what an exellent man he was / and with how noble and strong mind he
was endued: he does it in this little book / which natwithstandyng the very
great ieoperdye that he saw set forth a fore his eyes: (Such was the world
at that time) yet would he not shrynke or god away from the troth / but
boldly and styffely did stand by it / and in that point how much better
and more like a Christen man did he / than did that dulle ass of late time /
which dedycated the priuylege of that worshypfull and goodly donatyon or gift
/ to pope Iulyus the second / not without the contumelye and reproach of the
most excellent learned man / and in every point better than him self.
Affyrmynge / that him self had translate it out of ye greek / where as we did
not know that it was written or made in the greek tongue / for he did flatter /
to thentent / that he might please one person. But Valla has spoken the
truth / to the end that he might profit and do good to many men. What
thing lacks he / that belongs to the perfectyon of a Christen man / and a
good man. They therefore do nothing know you / which do fear / that this
labor of Valla shall be myslykyng and displeasaunte to you / for if they did
know you / or your mind / they would not esteem and judge your life / by the
manners and condycions of those popes / which have been robbers of men and
thieves / from whom and whose opinyon I do greatly dyssente and disagree /
both when I do here your fame and praise openly spoken of / and spredde
abroad every where: and also when I do consider this your promise full of very
good opinyon / for you do restore and renew peace. But there can no peace be
between the extorsyoners or robbers / and them which be robbed / and have
their goods wrongfully by violence taken from them: except they have that
which is their own / restored to them again. And you / except you were
minded to parforme and fulfill the deed self / would never have put forth
and set before us this promise / which else should be but vain words. And
therefore this is mine opinyon / that you would have been greatly displeased and
angry with me / if both against the judgment of mine own mind / and also
against the common judgment of all men. (For who is he that is of y^ opinyon or
mind) I should have praised unto you / that ungracious and myscheuous
ymagination or faynyng / which those false popes have untruely forged of
Constantyne: saying and also facyng it out / that he has given and granted to
them thempire of the West part of the world / with the city of Rome / the
lady and regent of all people and nations / whose leude boldness I do marueyle
at / chefely in this: that they were not afraid nor a shamed / to affirm that
thing which they knew well / that no man would believe. But they wened that
they should easily have persuaded the germayns / and brought them in bele^e
thereof because the common fame and noise goes / ye the germai^s have no brain
nor wit / and therefore they use no wit nor polyce or crafty conueyance in
this matter / for if they had had to do with other natyons / doutles this
fayning or Imaginatio^s should not have been so cold and faynte / as it is / but
a great deal more craftily handled / and they would have been more ware and wise
in the deuysing of this lie / except there can be any man found / which can
show / that ever they used any such fraud or gyle against any emperor /
before that the name of Empyere came to the Germayns I am therefore (oh good
lord) excedingly ashamed of our forefathers there / which have been so slow
and dulwytted / that they could not parceyue or espy the deceipte / which was
easy to be parceyued and known even of very children. But their fraud and
gyle is so much more worthy of more hatered: by how much after worse facyon
they have abused or simplycite mistrustyng no deceyte or craft at all. But who
can praise and marvel enough at your filycyte and happynes / most blessed
Leo: in whose person it has chaimced this change to be made of Popes / in to
the better? for the church / from hence forward shall have better popes /
except this your promise be not made with the heart / but feigned / as I am sure
it is not. And therefore those persons do injury unto you: who so ever do but
even so much as doubt ones / whether you will suffer them that do write
against ye donatio^ or gift of Constantyne / so shamfully and falsely forged
and feigned / and against those popes / which have been the ymagyners and
deuysers of this most detestable and abominable mischefe: all checkinge and
bitter words / and also all sharp and cruel deeds / are mete and conuenyent
to be used even to the uttermost that may be either said or done. Why not?
against robbers of princes and of the co^munes / against thieves / against
tyrauntes / against open rouers. For who is a more vyolent thief or open robber
/ than is he: which so plucketh men's goods from them / that he never
takes up / or makes an end of so doi^g. These were they / The excedi^g
abusyons of certain popes.
which taki^g occasyo^ in a very small thing have gone forth past al mesure in
outrage of pyllyng and polyng away of men's goods / which have set forth /
graces to be sold / which have sold pardons / have sold dispensations / and a
thousand manners and kinds of bulls / now so long season / which have
ordained lucre and gaynes to be gotten in the remissyon and forgyuenes of
sins. And also have found and gotten wynnyng and advantage in the
punysshment and pains of them that are deed / which also have suffered the
ben^fyces / which are almost of our forefathers: to be bought of themselves /
which have brought the Germaynes in belefe / that they are no bysshoppes:
which have not boughte their palles of them / with many thousand pieces of
gold / which have not ben co^tente / nor thought it enough to exact and
require money extraordinarily every year ones / but also as oftentimes as it
has come i^ to their mind / have sent collectours and gatherers / sondrie of
them for sondrie causes. As some / because they were about to make ready for
war against the Turks: Other some / that they might build up the church of
saint Peter in Rome / which they do not care or provide to be fynisshed. And
albeit that they did all these things before rehearsed / yet for all that / they
would the^ selves co^munely to be saluted and called most blessed / and most
holy fathers / and did not suffer / not only any thing to be done: but also
not so much as to be said or spoken against their conditions and manners. But
if any man had spoken any whitte / or made any mention of liberty / or if any
man had cast any thing at all against them in their way to letre / or delay /
and hyndre them in their extortion or rauyne and robbry: they did wreke their
teene upon his soul / destroye^g it and dampnyng it forthwith to the pytte of
hell. Would you not rekyn him / most noble Leo / to be a very great enemy to
you: if any man did account you in the nombre of such insatiable thieves? of
so cruel tyrauntes? Or do you not think him to be a friend and benefyciall
unto the estates of Popes: which with a great loud voice does laud and praise
you / for that you are nothing agreyng or like unto them? and on the other side
does take away from them al things / that belong to the succesiyon of Peter.
Or will not you which are the renewer of peace / say well of him / and give
him your blessyng: which curses those authors and causers of wars and
seditions? Yes moreover I know you so well / that I dare be bold to say /
your self will curse them / that the saying of the prophet may be applied very
well and accordyngly to every one of them. He has loved maladiction or cursyng
/ and it shall come to him. Psalm. 1.8 Popes not shepherdes: but wolves not
kepers of Christ's flock: but bet^ ^yers of them.
He would no blessing and therefore it shall be set far of from him. For
they with cursyng did destroy the souls of men: as though men's souls were
not a possessyon derelye beloved of god / it may therefore be concluded / yt
they were no pastors or herdesmen / because they did not save or keep souls
from perisshyng / but did distroy them / and did set forth the weep of Christ
in to danger of the wolves / which go about the flock of the lord / for to
devour it. I say they were not shepherdes but wolves: not kepers or watchemen
/ but traitors and thieves / wherefore by very good right we may curse them:
because god does not love them / for as much as themselves had no mi^de or
love to the peace of god Therefore to conclude so long has there ben no pope
in ye church: as long as there has been no peace in it. Ye moreover so long
might men neither say well / neither do well: how long these Ravenous wolves
walked through gods fold making havoc / Psalm. 119.
and so long as those syngulare wyld beasts did wast and destroy ye vineyarde
of the lord / and those incomparable tyrauntes were lords / and had domuno^
over al Christendom / of whom Hieremy the prophet says / Iere. ^^.
Many herdesme^ have destroyed and thrown down my vyneyarde / they have my
part trodden under the foot / for if every man is so much a worse tyrant? by
how much he kills mo bodies of the Citezens or co^munes / yt he him self
may make havoc and take his pleasure / safely / out of ieopardy: what is to
be said of them / which yt them selves might have riches / did begyne and
instytute the slaughter and murder of souls every where? which were not
contented / nor thought it enough to kill and slay the bodies of men / for that
they defended the troth: but also did kill and sle the soul / (...) thing
(...) of (...), and how deerly beloved of god.
yt leave and dear spousesse of god / which did destroy / kill / and devour
yt noble spoil of hell / that reward of so great labor and trauayll / and
which was purchashed and gotten with the precious blood of Christ? whom we
truly did not envy again of our part / for that they were rich and of great
power and might: but we hated the^ / because they were noisome and evil doers.
But what alacryte or cherefulnes can be sufficient for us / yt we might show
ye great love most depely graffed and roted now in the mides of Christen men
toward you / most blessed Leo? you ar the pryncypal love of the world / you
ar the chief derlyng and delyghte of al mankind / the renewer and restorer of
peace / the quencher and ceasser of wars / the author and causer of securite
and quietness / the pacifyer and a layer of troubles and stryfes / the father of
studies / the nourissher of learning / the repayrer and renewer of all good
arts and sciences / whereby the wits are adourned and garnisshed / of whom it
is written by ye prophet In his days there shall spring or rise justice /
Psalm. 71.
and plenty of peace. How much more substanciall and true pease is contained in
these things: than were contained in those things / which of late days were
spoken to Julius of his wars and triumphs. For these things are the
laudable and commendable works of a very pope. And those of Julius were ye
most ferce cruel / and vengeable deeds of a tyraunte. For douteles none of
them was a pope / which have drawn unto themselves (caryng not by whatso ever
means) the seculare kingdoms. Neither he has been ye vicare of Christ / or
the successor of Peter: who so ever he be / that has defended that wretched
and synful donation of Constantine / which never was made: neither yet was
possible to have been ever made. The improbation and disproui^g whereof / in so
much I do not suppose or think to be wicked: that I do judge them grettely to
minishe and derogate the dignyte of popes / who so ever do approve or allow it.
And also I have confydence and trust / that I do great pleasure unto you: in
that I do renew and call it again as it were from darkness to light / from
death to life / that little book of Valla made concerning this matter / which
has been of late time rejected / refused / and conde^pned. ye more over I do
dedicate the same book unto your holiness: to the entente / that it may be
witnessed and openly known to all men / how that now (lyberte being restored
/ and as it were newborn again / by ye reason that you are pope) all men
may laufully both speak the truth: ye / and also put forth the same in
writing / which my deed / all be it I do not doubt / but that yt does please
you greatly: yet natwithstandyng after that I shall have perceived this to be
approved of you / by some publyke and open testymonie I shall give dilygence
that I may oftentimes find out some such like thing. In the mean season
Christ preserve you being so good and very a pope unto us / long in health and
prosperity from Steckelberge castle the first day of Dece^bre / in ye year of
our lord. 1517.

The reverend father Iherome Pan / Cathalane chanon of Barcinon / doctor of

crede^ce / and to be believed: writes thus as herafter follows / in his book /
which they call commonly / the Practice of the popes Chauncery.
Pope pius has written a dialoge / against the gift or grant of
Constantene.
That the donatio^ or gift of Constantine was never true matter in deed: Read
Laurence Valla and pope Pius in his dialoge / and I my self truly never red
any thing of such manner grant in any approved writer of histories / namley of
ye sort / which wrotte in the time of Constantine / or in the tymene^^ unto
it. For neither Eusebius / which was ye most dilygent ensercher and teller of
Christian histories / makes any mention thereof / which for all that (^f it had been of truth) seemed not to have been in any wise for to ^e over hipped and
left out. Neither Jerome / Aug. Ambrose / Basilius / Io. Chrysostom. Neither
Ammyane / neither the history called Historia Tripartita. Neither yet Damasus
the pope in his cronycle / neither Beda / neither Drosius / has spoken any
thing thereof. And this is undoubtedly known to be true / yt by the space of
mo tha^ three hundred years after Co^stantyn / Exarches
themperours had the domynion / and were the governors and rulers of the cite
of Rome / and of Italy / by dukes / deputies / and leutenau^tes and captains /

The delamation of Lau. Valla / a noble man and of the senators of blood of
Rome / against the untruly forged and falsely believed donation or gift of
Co^sta^tyne.
The first perte of this oration / in which thautor shows this intent and the
order / after which he will proceed in this work / and also that neither
Consta^tyne of like lyhed was wyllyng / or could be suffered to give / neither
Syluester was wyllyng / or might laufully receive the things mentioned in the
donation.
I Have made and put forth many and diverse books welne^e in every kind of
doctrine and scyences. In which books / because I do varry and disagree in
mind and opynion from certain great authors / and which have been now of
long time and contynuaunce approved and allowed / seeing that there be some men
/ which are miscontent and angry therewith / and which therefore do accuse me as a
presu^ptuous person and as one that had committed sacrilege: I pray you what
is than to de supposed / that certain persons will do now? how greatly shall they
rage and rail agai^ste me ye / and if it shall lie in their power / how
vyole^tly / and how curryshely shall they hale and draw me to execution? which
not only do write against them / that be dead: but also against them that be
yet a live / and that not against one or two alone: but against a great meyny
and not against private persons only: but also against those / which are in
auctorite / and be heed officers / governors and rulers. But what heedoffycers
or rulers? verily ye pope highest of all bisshoppes / which is not only armed
with the te^porall swerd / The pope occupies both the temporal and the
spiritual sword.
after the manner and custom of kings and princes: but also with the
ecclesyasticall or spiritual sword / that a man can not defend himself so
from him. No / not under the very shield (that I may so say) of any of the
princes: but that shall be stricken with excommunication / the great sentence
and the less course. And if that man have been iuged to have done also as
wisely / as he did speak which said / that he would not write against them /
which have power to proscrybe or banisshe: How much more seems it / that I
ought to do the same / and to be ware / There is no where any refuge to be had
from the violente power of the Pope.
how I do write against him / which shall not so much as leave any place to
proscryption or banissheme^t / and which may so pursue me with the spu^all
vltyo^ of his power and auctoryte: that I may ryghtfully say with ye prophet
David / Psalm. 88.
in the psalm. whether shall I go from thy spyrite? and whether shall I fle from
thy face? except paraue^ture we suppose / yt the Pope shall take these things
more patiently / than other mean prestes would do. But that is nothing so / for
Ananias the highest and heed priest / Acts. 2^. Ananias commanded salt Paul
to be beaten on the mouth for saying the troth.
commanded / even in the presence of the high captain / which sat as judge:
that Paul should be strycken and beten on the face / because he said / that him
self had lived and been co^uersaunt among the Jews / with a good conscience /
and Phaffur being endued with the same dignite / Iere. 20. Jeremy was cast in
to prison by the high priest / for speaking the truth.
did cast the prophet Hieremie into prison: because he did speak the troth
boldly and frelye / but yet the high captain / and the Emperors deputy was
both able and also wyllyng to defend Paul / and the King both might and
would defend Hieremie against the injury of the high priest or bishop /
Iere. 26.
but what captain? what deputy or ruler? what king shall be able? although he
were willing to deliver me from the hands of the pope / if he may ones lay
hands upon me? But there is no cause / The pope ca^ not bind or lose any
thing contrary to right / and the law of god.
why this double fear of ieoperdy should trouble my mind / or hold me back
from my purpose: for neither may the pope / either bi^de or loose any thing
contrary to right and gods law / and to loose and spend the life in the
defense and mayntenaunce of truth and justice: Let no man shrink to spe^de
his life / in the defense of troth and justice.
is a point of most high virtue / of most high praise / and of most high
and greattest reward. Have not many men put them selves willingly in danger
and peril of death: for the defense of their earthely cou^trye. and shall I
tha^ be afraid to put my self in danger of death / for to get and optayn the
heavenly country (which those men do get and obtain / that do please god:
Heuyn is go^ten by pleasi^ge of god / and not by pleasi^ge of men.
and not they which do please men) Therefore fare well fear / and adewe dread.
The cause of truth / the cause of rightuosenesse / the cause of god: is to be
defended with a strong and bold mind / with great courage and confydence /
and with good hope / for he is not to be accounted a right orator which has
craft and connyng to make a good oration and to speak well: who is a god
orator.
except he dare also boldly do it. Let us therefore be bold and hardy / to
accuse whosoever does committee things worthy accusacion / Mat. 18. Open siners
and which will not receive secret cou^sa^le are to be rebuked openly.

The first epistell to Timothe / and.v. cha.


and he which trespasseth against all men: let him be checked and rebuked by
the mouth of one man / for all. But perauenture some will say / that I ought
not to chyde or rebuke my brother openly / but secretly bitwene him and me.
yes verily / He which trespasseth and offends openly / and which would not
receive close and secret counsel / is to be rep^ued and rebuked openly yt by
the^sa^ple of him / other may be put in fear and dread. Gala. 2. To the
galatianes the second chapi.
Did not Paul) whose words these were / yt I last received) repreue. Peter to
his face / in the presence and sight of the congregation / because he was
reprouable and worthy rebuke? and he has left this in wryti^g: He that
observes the commandments of god: is made one spyrite with god
to our doctrine and instruction. But some man happily will say again / that
I am not Paul / which may worthily rebuke Peter / yes verily / I am Paul: in
that I do follow Paul even likewise as ye which is a much greatter thing. I
am made one spirit with god: No man is to be spared because of his dignite but
if he be reprefe word^ ^he mat and ought to be reproved.

Marcellus pope. Celestine pope.


wha I do dilyge^tly observe and obey his commandments. Neither is it the
dignyte of any man / that may him safe and sure from blame or rebukes / which
did not save Peter from reprefe / nor many other men of the same high estate
and degree: but that they have been rebuked / as Marcellus / because he had made
sacrifyce to gods and Celestine / because he was of the same opinion: that
Nestorius ye heretyke was of / and as we do know also / that in our time and
remembrance / certain have been of their inferiors. (For who is not inferior
to the pope) repreued and rebuked (I will not say condemned) And verily I do
not this / For what ente^te valla made this work.
because I do coueyte to rail upon any man / and to write such reuilyng and
rebukefull orations against him / as were the oratyons of Cicero / against
master Antonius / which orations are called philyppice (for god sheld me from
doi^g such a deed) but that I might loose and pluck a way erroures and wrong
opinions from me^nes minds. and that I might keep the^ far away from vices
and si^nes / either by admonisshi^g and counsaylyng: or else by reproui^g and
rebuki^g of them. I dare not be so bold to say / that other men taught by me /
may with a hook or byll cut and keep low ye papale see (which is ye
vineyarde of god) being now over rank and having to many superfluous branches
/ and compelle it to bear full grappes / and not the small buryes of the wild
vine / which thing when I do: shall there be any man wylling either to stop
my mouth or his own ears: I will not say to offer or put unto me punishment
and death? that man that would so do although he be the pope him self / what
shall I say that he is? Shall I say that he is a good shepherde? or else
rather a deaf serpent / which will not hear ye voice of the charmer or
inchaunter / Psalm. 57.
but is wyllyng to hurt his members with her bytyng and poysone. I know that
ye men's ears have been now a good while desyrouse and longyng to here / what
fault or crime I will lay to ye popes charge / for sothe a great and a huge
crime / either of neglygent ignorance / or else of outragyouse covetousness
/ which is the seruitute of ydoles / or else of vanyte / and desire of having
dominion and rule / which vice / Ephe. 5.
tyranny always accompanyeth / for now certain hundredth years either they have
perceived and understand / that the donation or grant of Constantyne is but
a forged or feigned thing / or else themselves have feigned it / or else those
that have comen after / setting their fete fast in the gyles of their
predecessors / have defended it for true / which they knew well was false /
dyshonoringe the majesty of the papal estate / disworshippynge the memory of
the old popes / shamynge the christen relygion / and troublyng and fyllyng all
the world with murders / threttes / and abhomynable sins. They say that the
city of Rome is theirs that the kingdom of Nables is their own good. And
that all Italy / France / Spain / Germanye / England / and all the west
part of the world / belongs to them selves. For all these nations and
countries (they say) are contained in the instrument and writ of the donation
or grant. Are than / all these before rehearsed kingdoms / thine high
bishop? Is it thy mind? and art thou purposed to recover all these again?
to spoil and bereue all the kings and princes of the west perte / their
cities and towns? or to compel them to pay yearly trybutes to the? But I do
say and think clean contrary / that ye kings may more rightfully spoil and
deprive the of all thempire and dominion that thou have. For as I shall declare
and open / you that grant or gift / whereof the popes will their right and
tytell to have taken his origynall / was known both to Syluester and also to
Constantyne. Neither Constantyne neither Syluerster knew ever any thing at
such donation.
But are ever I do come to the confutyng and disprouyng of the instrument or
writ of the said donation (which is their only defense / but both a false
defense and a folysshe) the order requires that I reherce the matter somewhat
farther of / and nere from the very begynni^g The order of his process in this
oration and the deuisyon of his work.
that either the one (I mean Co^stantyne) would be wyllyng to give or else
might rightfully give / or else that it did lie in his own power / to deliver
them in to the hands of any other men / or else that the other (that is to wit
Syluester) would be wyllyng to receive / or else mit laufully receive and take
them. Secondarily I will either him self / or else any other pope / who ever he
was / being ones driven out and put from the possession of the^ / they can not
now after so great space of time between be asked or claymed again: neither
by gods law / neither yet by the law of man. Last of all The authors
shows it to be nothing lykely that any prince being in his right mind
would of him self be wyllyng to give from him self so great things: as are
feigned in the privilege to have be^ given of Constantyne.
that himself ought or that it had be^ mete and convenient because of liberte
to have given to another man ye cite of Rome his own country / ye chief and
heed place of all ye world / the lady and queen of cytees / most of power and
might / most noble / and most rich of people / the venquessher and triumphant
conqueror of all nations / the which is honorable and full of majesty / even
in the sight and beholding of it. And to get him self to a vile and poor
town afterward / that is to wit to Bizantium. ye / moreover that he should
with the cite of Rome / give Italy also / which is not a province: but the
heed of provinces / should give from him self the.iii. parts of Frauner /
the.ii. Spaynes / should give Germanye / should give England / and all the
hole weste part of the world / and should deprive himself of one of the.ii.
eyes of the empier. No man can bring me in mind to believe / that any man
would do this / which were in his right mind. For what thing does god give
you more desired and longed for? Of all things princes desire most to enlarge
their dominion and empire and the contrary they most hate.
What thing is more plesaunt? What is more acceptable and better welcome / than
to enlarge and encreace your kingdom and empiers? and very greatly to amplyfie
and setforthe your dition and dominion both in length and bredthe / about this
thing (as me think I perceive right well) all your care / all your cogitation
and thought / and all your labor and travail / is spente and bestowed both
day and night. Hereof do you principally and chefly hope to have glory / for
this thing you do forsake pleasures / for this you do put your selves in a
thousand perils and ieoperdes. for this you ar content to lose your most
derely beloved children. ye for this / you do not grudge to lose perre of your
own bodis / for I never herd or read / that any of you has been feared away
from the endeuourment and going about to amplyfie and enlarge his empier:
because he had lost either an eye / a hand / or a leg / or else any other
membre or part of his body. But this hot and fervent desire of having great
and large dominion / as every man is most of might and power: so it most
troubles and vexes or chafeth his mind. The insaciable ambicyon of great
Alexander.
Alexandre not content to have walked on foot through the deserts and
wildernesses of Affrike / and that he had conquered the Eest part of the
world / even unto the formast part of the Occian see. Read Plutarche in the
life of Alexander
and that he had subdued the North part: in the mids of so many wounds /
and of so many mischaunces / when his soudiers refused and forsook so far /
so sharp / and paynfull vyages and iornayes: yet he thought all that ever he
had done before / was nothing at all: except he had also made the West part /
and all nations tributary to himself / either by force and violence / or else
by the auctorite of his name. yt is but a small thing / whereof I do yet speak.
He had purposed moreover to pass over the Occian see / and to search whether
there were any other world / and to subdue it to his power / ye / and at the
last (as I suppose) he would have entreprised and attempted to clyme up into
heaven Such for the most part is the will / desire / and appetyte of all
kings and princes: all be it they have not all like courage and boldness. I
will not here reherce / how great sins / and how many abominable things
have been committed and done / either for the winnyng and gettyng of empier and
dominion: or else for the amplyfiyng and enlargyng of the same / in so much
that the one brother has not holden his hands from the murdryng and kyllyng
of the other / neither the children have refrayned from the wicked effusion of
their fathers blood / neither the fathers have refrayned from the kyllyng of
their own sons: So that the temerite and folysshe lewd boldness of man / is
wo^te in nothing to rage more / or to use more cruelty / and to committee more
haynouse offenses or sins: than here in this thing. ye / and which a man may
more maruayle at / you may see the minds of old men herein no less quycke
and full of courage: than be the minds of young men / and of them that be
chyldles: no less than of those that be fathers / and have children / and of
Kings and Princes: no less than of tyrauntes. Now if dominion than or empire
is wont with so great enforceme^t to be desired and sought for: with how much
more inforcement and business must it needs be kept and menteyned? Neither is
it so miserable and wretched a thing / not to amplyfie and enlarge the e^pier
/ as it is to minissh it and to make it less. Neither is it so shamfull a
thing for the / not to join or put another ma^ns realm unto thine: as it is
that thine should be joined to ye empier of an other man / for where we do read
/ that certain Kings or certain people / have made some me^ governors of
their kingdom or of their Cytyes: that was done so / not of the chefest or
principal / nor of the greattest part of the empyer: but in a manner of the
hynmoste or worste / and the lest part thereof / and that under such manner and
co^dityon / that he to whom such governance and rule was given: should
always acknowledge the gyuer to be as lord / and himself to be as a minister
and seruau^te under him. I be seche you than do not they seem to be of an
abiecte / vile / and cowardly mind / and nothing of gentle and high or
couragiouse stomach: which do think and suppose / that Constantine did
alyenate and give from himself the better part of the empier. I do not mean
Rome and Italy / and other: but the three Fraunces / where he had made wars
and batayles / where he alone had of long season ruled and had dominion / Mani
considerations / why Constantyne would not give from him the best part of the
Empire.
where he had set the rudimentes and first foundation of his Empire and of
his glorte: seeing also that he was a man / which for the desire to have
dominion / had made war upon nations / and which persecuting his own
friends / and men of his alyaunce with ciuyll war: had deprived them of their
empier / and which also had not yet perfytly overcome and subdued those that
were left and remained of the contrary facyon and part / which also not only
was wont for hope of glory and renown to make war with many nations: but
also was of necessyte compelled to do so / because he was provoked there unto
daily of the Barbarians / which moreover had abundance and plenty of children
/ of kynsefolke / and also of friends / which knew also right well / that the
senators and the people of Rome / would repugne and strive against his deed /
which besides all this had proved and found by experience the instabilite of
ye nations venquesshed and subdued / which welnere at every change of the
emperor or gouernoure of the Romans: were wont to rise and rebelle / which
thereto did remember himself / after the manner and custom of other emperors
not to have come to that dominion and empier / by the election of the senators
/ and consent of the people or communes / but to have gotten and won it with
an army of men / with the sword with war and battle. What so great and
strong cause? what so urgent and necessary thing was there / why he should
(all these things nothing regarded / but utterly despised and set at
naught) be willing to use so excedyng great liberty. They say / because he was
made a christen man. What? should he therefore deprive himself of the best
part of the empire. ye / I wysse / I suppose it was sin / ye and that great
sine and wicked abomination / to reign than any longer / and that to be an
emperor and governor of realms: could not be joined or stand together with
the Christen relygion. Those that be in auoutry / those that have made
themselves rich by usury / those which unjustly do possess other men's goods:
after that they have received baptism / are wont to restore the wife / to
restore the money / and to restore the goods / which they had of other
men's. if you have this cogitations or thought with you / O Constantine: you
ought to restore to cities their liberty / and not to change the lord /
making them where before they were bound to you: now bound to another. But
some man will say / this was not the cause / but that you were moved to do this
thing / only for the honor of relygion and holiness or devotion / as who
would say / that it were a more holy and devout thing to lay from you your
empire: tha^ to administre and govern it for the defense and mayntenaunce of
faith and relygion. For as touching to the receyuers of it: this your donation
or gift / shall neither be worshipful or honest: neither yet profitable unto
them. But if you will show your self a Christen man / if you will show
tokens of your holiness and devotion / if you will do good / and provide / I
do not say for the church of Rome / but for the church of god: now specially
and principally play the prince and governor / that you may fight for the^
which neither may / neither ought to fight for them self / that you may by
your auctorite make the^ safe and sure from ieoperdy: which are in danger of
traynes and injuries. It has pleased almighty god in times past / to open and
show to Nabugodonosor / to Cyrus / to Assuerus / and to many other kings and
princes: the high ministry of the truth. yet for all that / he never
required of any of them: that he should renounce and forsake his empier / that
he should give away part of his kingdom: but only that he should restore
liberty to the Hebrews / and defend them from the injuries and noyaunce of
their enemies / that bordred upon them. This was suffycient to the Jews: this
same also shall be suffyciente to Christen men. Constantine you are now made
christen. But is it not a shamfull thing / that you being now a Christen
emperor / are a smaler prince in dominion and empier: than you were being yet
an Infydele? All power and auctorite is the gift of god.
For to be a prince or governor: is a certain principal and chief gift of
god / whereunto even the hethen princes also are judged to be called and chosen
of god. But happily some man shall say / that Co^sta^tyne was eased and
delivered from his lepry / and therefore it is very like to be true / that he
would make recompense / and pay home again with gretter measure: yt which he
had received / Is it so in deed? Naaman yt noble man of Syria / Read the.v.
chapit of the iiii. books of Kings.
when he was cured and healed of his lepry by the prophet Helizeus / was
wyllyng and content only to offer gifts and presents to him: but not to give
the one half of his substance and goods / and would Constantine offer the one
half of his e^pier? It greueth me to make answer to this shamfull lyeng tale:
as it were to an history / of certaynte and undoubted troth. For this lyeng
fable is forged and cou^terfaited to ye lykenes of the history of Naaman and
Helyzeus: as that other tale of the dragon in the life of Siluester / is
imagined to the lykenes of that fable of the dragon of Bell. But though I do
grant these things to be true: Dan^. 14. (...) the.xiiii chapit of the
prophet Daniel: how he slew the dragon (which the people of ^^^^lon did
worship) without sword or ^ta^fe.
is there any mention made of the donation in this history? no verily not one
word. But of this we shall speak better and in more convenient and mete place
here after. well / I grant he was delivered from the lepry / he took therefore
a Christen mind to him / he was endued with the fear of god / with the love
of god / he was desirous and wyllyng to do him honor and worship / what of
all this? yet ca^ not I for all that be persuaded and brought in mi^de to believe
that he would be willing to give away from himself so great things / for as
moth as I do see no man / niether Ge^tyle / for ye honor of his false gods /
neither Christen man / for the honor of ye living god: that has forsaken and
laid from himself his e^pier / and given it to priests. For none of ye
kings of Israel could be brought in the mi^de / 3. Regu^ 12 Example hereof
you may fi^de / of Hieroboam in the third book of Kings / and xii. chapit /
somewhat nere to the e^de of the same chapit.
that he would su^^re the people to go aft ye manner used aforetyme / to ye
temple of Jerusalem / for to make sacrifice / and al because they fered and
dreded / lest the people being put in remembrance / by that holy exercise of
religion / and by the majesty of the temple: hapely might return again to the
king of Judah from who^ they had fled and gone away. But how much gretter a
thing is this: which Constantine is said to have done / and be cause you shall
not flatter and begyle your self / by the reason of this healyng from lepre /
thynkyng this a sufficient cause / wherefore Consta^tin should make that
grant. Hieroboam was the first / that was chosen of god / to be king of
Israel / and that truly from most vile and low condition or estate / 3. Regu^
12 Read in the third book of Kings the xii. cha.
which in my judgment / is a more great thing than it is to be helped and
cured from lepry / and yet for all that he durst not betake or deliver up his
kingdom to god / will thou yt Co^sta^tine did give his kingdom and Empere to
god which he had not received of god? namely seeing yt in so doing / he should
offe^de and grieve his own children (which thing could not have chanced to
Hieroboam) Should cast down his fre^des / should despise those yt belonged to
him / should hurt his country / should put all men to heuines and sorrow / and
be him self as it were turned into a new man? at ye lest wise doutles there
should not have lacked some / which would have administered him / and put hi^ in
remembrance / and in especial his children / his kynsfolke / and his fre^des
/ whom who is he which would not think that they would forthwith have gone to
the Emperor? Ymagyn therefore them before your eyes / after they have herd
Constantines mind: trembling and full of fear / making haste and with
sorrowful syghes and tears falling down at the knees of their prince / and
using these words and oratyon / so as here follows unto him.

The oratyon of Constantines sons / and of his kynsfolke and friends / made
unto him full of lamentable complaynte / for that he gothe about without / ye /
and contrary to their deseruynge so to take from them their inheritance. etc.
FAther / which have been heretofore the most loving and natural father / that
might be in the world unto your children: Do you in this wise now deprive?
disherite / and put us your own sons from your lyuelyhode and possessions /
even in your life time / and as it were refuse us and forsake us for your
children. For that you ar willing and minded to give from yourselfe the best
and the greattest part of the empyer. we do not so greatly complain thereof /
as we do marvel thereat. But we do complain / that you do offer it to other
men / with our both loss and also shame and rebuke. For what cause is there /
wherefore you do defraude your children / and do keep from them the succession
or inheritance of the empier / that they waited and looked after: which have
your self reigned to gyther with your father. What have we offended or
trespased against you? or what unkindness or vnloui^g behavior have we used
toward you? or what against our country? what against the name of the Romans
/ and the majesty of the empier? for which we seem to you worthy to be
deprived by you and put from the princypall and be part of the empier /
and to be banisshed from our fathers house / from the sight of our natyue
country from the air that we have been wonted unto / and from the ancient and
old custom. Shall we now being banisshed men / forsake our own houses / the
temples and the sepulcres of our forfathers / kynsfolke / and friends: knowing
not where or in what regio^ of ye world we shall become? The kynsfolke and
fre^des.
what? we that are your kynsfolke what? we that are your friends which have so
often times stand with you in fight and battle / which have seen our brethren
/ our fathers / our sons strickyn in / and thruste through before our face
with the weapons of our enemies / and beatyng and tremblyng upon ye ground /
and have not been afraid with the death of other men / but have been redye also
ourselves to dye for your sake in your cause: are we all together now now thus
forsaken of you? we which do bear heed of fyces in Rome / and we which now
have the rule and governance / or in time to come should be rulers and
governors in the Cities of Italy / in the.iii. pertes of France / in the.ii.
parts of Spain / and in other provinces: are we all revoked or called back
again? and are we al commanded to be private persons without office / dygnite
/ or auctorite? will you recompense us this great loss another way / how can
you be able to do it according to our deseruynge / and according to our
worthynes and dygnyte: when you shall have given ones from you so great a part
of the world unto another man / he that before was ruler and governor over an
C Nations / will you / O Caesar make him governor and ruler over one nation /
how fortuneth it that ever this thing could come into your mind? how comes it
to pass yt you have thus suddenly forgotten all yours: that neither you have
any whit pite of your fre^des. neither of your nere kynsme^ / no / neither yet
of yor own sons / would god / O Ceser (so yt your dignite and victory were
saved) that it had been our fortune and chance to have been slain in baytayle:
rather tha^ that we should ever se these things: and verily as touching your
empire / you may do with it according to your own lust and pleasure / and so
may you also with us / only one thing excepted / in which we will continually
be disobedient eue^ unto death / that is / that we will not in any wise cease
from the honori^g of ye ydols / to the great ensample also of other men / that
you may know how little good or profit your larges and lyberalyte shall do to
the Christen relygio^. For if you do not give ye empier to Siluester: we are
willing and content to be come Christen with you / and many men shall take
ensample of our deed / to do likewise. But if you do give it to him: not only
we can not find in our hertes to be made christian me^: but also you shall make
this name of Christ hatful / detestable / cursed / and abominable to us / and
you shall make us in such case / yt at the last you will have pity both of our
life and also of our death / and do not accuse us of hard hertes and
stubburnes: but accuse your own self. Would not Constantine (think you) if
he were not meued by his own accord and of his own mind and free will: at
the leastwise have been meued and styrred with this oration / except we will
that all humanyte was plucked out from his breest by the hard rotes. What if
he would not have hard these men / nor regarded their oration or spech / were
there not be sides these / some which would have repugned and be against this his
deed / both with their words and also with their hand and power. would the
senators and the people of Rome have supposed: that themselves ought to do
nothing in this so great and weghty a matter / would not they have called to the^
an orator (as Virgile says) bei^ge a man of grauyte and auctorite for his
love and benefytes toward his country: Enedos. 1
which should make this oration to Constantine.

The oration of ye senators and the people of Rome made to Co^sta^tine / in
which they not only do show that Constantine has no right nor auctorite to
give the e^pier from him: but also that they will in no wise suffer it to be
done / and that for many co^syderatio^s / but raither flee both the receyuer /
and him also the gyuer.
MOst noble Caesar / if you have no mind or remembrance neither of those that
be nere to you neither of your self / so that ye will neither their
inheritance to remain hole to your sons / neither their riches and
substance to your kynsfolke / neither their honors to your fre^des. neither
ye empire to your own self: yet for all that / the senators and the people
of Rome can not forget / or be vnmyndeful of their right and of their dignite /
for how do you take upon you so much power / as to do this of the empire of
Rome: which was never won or gotten with the effusyo^ of your blood / but of
ours. will you cut and divide one body into ii. pertes / and will you of one
ki^gdome make two / two heedes and to wylles. And will you as it were / offer
swerdes unto two brethren / which may strive and fight togider for the
inheritance. We do give to such cities as have been friendly / and have done
good unto this cite of Rome: we do give to the^ the lybertes of this city /
that they may be citezins of Rome. And do you take away from us the one half
of the empire / that it shall not aknowlege this city the parent and mother of
it. In the hyues of bees / if there be bredde two kings or master bees / we
do kill the tone / A symilytude taken of bees
which is the worst of them two. And do you suppose or think it mete / in the
hyue of the Romayne empire / where you are the only and the best gouernoure /
another heed and governor to be set and placed / and that the very worst and
not a profitable be / but and unprofitable drane. Of the diuysyon of thempire
i^ twain shall ensue many inco^uenie^ces / and finally the decay of it
In this thing / we do greatly require wisdom in you most noble emperor / for
what shall happen or come to pass by ye reason hereof / if either in the time of
your life / or else after your decease. Barbarous nations shall make war /
either against this part of the empire / which you do alyenate and give from
you / or else against the other part / which you do reserve and keep still to
your self. With what strength of soldiers / or with what hosts or armies
shall we than resyst them? We can scantly withsta^de them now with the might
and power of the hole empire: and shall we than be able to resyst the^? Shall
these two members or parts of thempire be always at unity and co^corde
togider / the one with the other? As we suppose this is not possible / for as
much as Rome will rule and be maistresse / and the other perte will not be
seruau^te and obey. ye / moreover even you being yet a live / within short
time the old garnyson revoked and new put in their stead / and you being gone
in to your kingdom / and living far hens / and another man gouernynge and
rulynge here: Shall not all things than be changed and new / that is to say
/ diverse and contrary? Commonly when a kingdom is divided between two
brethren / forthwith the minds of the people and commens are divided / and
they begin to make war a monge them selves / before that they make war
against their enemies of out natyons. Who does not see / that the same
thing shall happen likewise in this empier. Do you not know / that in old
time this was the principal cause to the nobles and great estates / why they
said / that they would rather dye in the sight of ye people of Rome / than they
would suffer that law or statute to be made and to go forth / that part of
the senators and part of the common people / should be sent to inhabit the
cite called Veii. in Ethruria / and that.ii. cities should be common to the
people of Rome. Forseyng there was so much disse^tion in one cite of Rome: How
much more than should there be in two cities. So likewise in this time / if
there be so much discord / debate and strife now in one empier: (whereof I
report me to your own conscience / and to the labors and travail which you
have taken) what discord shall there be in two empiers. Go to / moreover do you
suppose or wene that you shall have any men from hence: which either shall be
wyllyng / or else shall have co^nyng and knowledge how to help you or aid you
/ when you shall be occupied and busyed with wars? They which shall be made
captains over the soldyers and rulers or governors of Cities / shall be as
unacquainted with all feats of cheualry / and have their mi^des as far set
away from war and baytayle: as he that makes them captains and rulers.
what? Shall not either the Legions of Rome / or else the very provinces selves
/ attempt and take in hand to spoil this governor / being so vnskylled of
doing the office of a prince and governor / and so easy to suffer and take
wrong: because they shall hope that either he shall make no resistance: or else
shall not revenge him self / nor do any punisshement to them. In good faith I
believe they shall not continue in doing their duty / not so much as one
month space / but yt they will rebelle forthwith / and even at the very
beginning of your departing from hence. what will you tha^ do? what counsayll
will you than take: when you shall be pursued and kept in with double / ye /
more over with manyfolde war and battle / we can scarsely rule and keep in
good order the Nations which we have conquered and subdued. How shall we be able
than to resyst the^: when we shall besides the^ have war with other nations
also / which are fre and unsubdued. Caesar concerning such things as belong
to your own self / advise you what you list to do. But this matter ought to
be no less cared for of us: than of you / your self are mortal: but the
empier of the people of Rome ought to be immortal / and so shall it be as
much as shall lie in our power. ye / and not only the empier: but also the
honesty and shamfastnes of the same people. Shall we so in deed? shall we
receive them to our governors and rulers: whose relygion and sect we do
despise? and we that be princes and rulers of the world: shall we become
servants and subjects to this most vile and wretched man? When the cite of
Rome was taken and won by the French men: the old ancient father of Rome
could not suffer / that their conquerours should stroke their berde / or draw
it through their hands. And shall now so many men of the senatorie order / So
many of the pretorie order / So many of the order and degree of Trybunes / So
many men that have been Consules and which have victoriously tryumphed / suffer
them to be rulers and lords over them: to whom them selves have done all manner
contumely rebuke and punisshment / as it were to lewd or evil bondmen. Shall
these men make heedoffycers? shall they govern the provinces? shall they make
batayles and wars? shall they give sentence of life and death upon us? Sall
the nobilyte of Rome / war and take wages under them? shall they hope or
wait for honors? or shall they get offices and rewards under them? what
more great or more depely persyng wound may we receive or take: than this?
Think not / O Caesar / that the blood of the Romans is so changed and gone
out of kind / that they will suffer this with a pacient and quiet mind. and
not think it to be by all manner means eschewed and avoided / which in good
faith / not the very women could suffer or abide but raither would brenne
themselves together with their sweet children and their howses / with the
worshipful gods of the same. So that the women of Carthage have not ben more
bold and strong herted / than the women of Rome would be / For Caesar / if we
had chosen and made you a king: verily you should have great power and
liberty / to do with the empier of Rome what you pleased / but yet not so:
that you might minisshe / but even the least point of the majesty thereof. For
else we that had made you king / by the same power we would bydde you lay
your kingdom from you / and would depose you / not only you could not be
suffered to divide or part the kingdom / not only you could not alyenate and
give from you so many proui^ces / not only you could not be suffered to give the
very heed and principal part of the kingdom utterly and for ever to an Alian
and most vile man. we have made a dog ouerseer and kepar of the fold of
sheep / which if he had lever play the wolf / than do his own office and
duty: either we will drive him out / or else we will kill him. Now seeing that
you have so long time used the office of a dog / in defendyng the fold of
the Romans: will you now at the last end be turned in to a wolf / so as
never was any before you. And we let you well to wit (for as much as you do
compelle us / to speak somewhat sharply for our right) you have no power /
right / nor title in the empeir of the people of Rome. Iulyus Caesar wanne
thempier and gatte it by force and vyolence. Augustus also gatte it by vyolence
/ and by ouerco^ming and vanquesshyng of the adversary parts / made himself
lord and gouernoure. Tiberius / Caius / Claudius / Nero / Galla Othouitellus /
Vespasiane / and other / either by the same / or else by like way / have
spoiled and robbed us of our liberty. you also your self / by expellyng and
driuyng out other / or else by kyllyng and sleyng of other: have been made lord
and Emperor. we passover here / that you are not borne of matrimony wherefore
/ Caesar (to give you plain knowledge of our mind) if you list not your self
to be heed governor of Rome: you have sons. Make one of them according to
the law of nature / governor in your stead / which thing we will both suffer
you / and also desyer you to do. if you will not: we are minded and purposed to
defend both the publyke majesty / and the private dignyte. For this is no
less iniurye to the Cytezens of Rome: than was in old time the defoylyng of
Lucrecia / neither we shall lack one / which shall be captain to this people
for the recoueryng of their lybertye: likewise as Brute was captain to them
against Tarquine / and first we shall draw out our swerdes against them / whom
you do make rulers over us: and than afterward against you also / which
thing we have done against many Emperors / and that truly for lyghter and
smaller matter than this. These words doutles would greatly have moved and
stirred Co^stantyne: except we do judge him to have been a stone or a stock /
which words although the people had not spoken to his face: yet it was
credyble and lykely / that they spoke them among their selves / and euerywhere
did grudge / and show them selves miscontente / with such manner words. Let
us than now go and say / that Constantyne was wyllyng to do Syluester pleasure
/ whom he did brige in danger of so many men's hatered / and of so many
me^nes swerdes: that (as far as I do think or judge) Siluester should
scasely have lived ye space of one day / for if he / and a few mo had been
rydde out of the way: all suspicion of so cruel injury / and despite or
contumely seems to be clean taken away and rydde out from the hertes and
minds of the Romans Go to now: moreover / let us grant / if we think it
possible: that neither intreatyng and prayers / neither manacyng or threttes /
neither any other way or mean could any thing avail / and that Constantine
does still continue steadfastly in his purpose / neither will in any wise leave
or forsake / or go from the opinion / which he has ones taken: who will not
yet agree hereunto / that he would have been moved and styrred at the words and
oration of Siluester? which doutles would have been after such manner as here
follows: if this had been a true thing done matter in deed.

The oration of Siluester to Constantine / in which he shows it to be
neither laufull / neither profitable for him / to receive Consta^tines offer /
although it were so as it is not / that Constantine might rightfully / and
without any impediment or offending of any person / give such things as he
offered from himself and his children.
MOst noble and best disposed prince / and son Caesar: I can not verily but
greatly love and embrace this your so ready and lyberall devotion / and godly
mind / but yet that you do somedele err and mistake / and are deceived in
your opinion about the offryng of gifts / and making of sacrifice to god I do
nothing marvel / for as much as you ar yet but a nouy^e and a young soldyer
in the Christen relygion / Read the.xxii chapit of Leuitici.
and Christen war / as in the old time it was not semely nor conuenyent /
every manner be / whether it were wild or tame / nor every manner sheep to be
offered up in sacrifice by the priest: so not every manner gift or oblation is
to be received and taken of the priest. I am a priest / and a bishop /
which ought to consider and look well about / what thing I do suffer to be
offered up at the aultre. Lest parauenture I do not say / any unclean beast:
but lest a vipere or a serpent be offered up there. Therefore this you shall
understand / If it lay in your power and lybertye to give part of the Empire
and of the Cyty of Rome / the lady and Empress of the world / to any other
man than to your own children (which thing I do not suppose or think) and
if this people of Rome / If Italy / If the other nations could suffer / and
find in their hertes to be subjects under the dominion and governance of
them / whom they do hate / and whose relygio^ and set they do refuse and
forsake / being delyted and blinded with the plesaunte entisementes of the
world (which thing is impossible) yet if you think most loved son / that I
am any white to be beloved: I can by no mean be persuaded and brought in the
mind / to assent and agree unto you / except I would be unlike my self / and
forget my condition and estate / and in a manner renounce and forsake my lord
Jesus. For your gifts / or (as you will have them called) your remunerations or
reco^pensations should pollute / stayne / or defoyle: ye / and also utterly
destroy the glory / the innocentie / and the holy living both of me: and
also of all that shall succeed me / and also should stop and close up the way
to them which shall be wyllyng to come to the knowledge of the troth.
Helizeus would not take any reward of Naaman that noble man of Syria: 4. Reg.
^. Read the iiii. book of kings the.v chapit
whom he had cured and heled from lepry. And shall I receive reward of you:
because you are cured of the same disease. He forsook and refused gifts. And
shall I suffer hole realms and kingdoms to be given to me. He would not
spotte or defyle the person of a prophet / and shall I find in my heart /
to defyle the person of Christ / which I do represent and bear in me. But
why did he think the person of a prophet to be defiled by taking of gifts?
verily because he might have seemed tha^ to selle holy things / and to lend
forth the gift of god / for to have increace and advantage thereby / and to
need the worldly socoure and aids of them / and to minisshe and appayre the
dignyte of his benefyte. He had lever therefore make princes and kings
beholding to him / for his benefytes don to them: than him self to be bound to
them for any benefyte received of them. ye / moreover he would not so much. as
take any recompense again for his benefytes. For it is a much more blessed
thing (as the lord says) to give: Acts. 20.
than to take and receive. The same cause have I: that Helizeus had ye / and a
much greatter cause / which am commanded also of the lord / that said.
Math. 10
Heal you those that be sick / raise up those that be deed / cleanse them that
be full of lepry / cast you out deuyls and wicked spirits you have received
freely: give you also freely. Shall I Caesar committee so great offense / as not to
obey and execute the commandments of god / and to pollute and distaine my
glory. It is better (as said Paul) that I dye: than that any man should
bereue me my glory Our glory is to make honorable our ministeri before god / 1.
Cor^. 9.
as the same Paul says. I say to you Gentyles / As long as I am the apostle of
the Gentiles: I will glorify my ministry. Should I than / O Caesar / be both
an ensample / and also a cause to other men for to offend and sin: I which
am a Christen man / the priest of god / the bisshoppe of Rome / and the vicare
of Christ. Moreover / how shall priests save their innocence of living
among riches? among great offices and dignites? among the administration of
seculare and worldly busynesses. Do we therefore renounce and forsake erthly
things: that we might get the same things more plentuously. And have we
therefore cast away our own private goods: that we might possess other men's
goods / and the commune goods. Cities shall be ours / Trybutes shall be ours
/ Rentes / tolles / and customs / shall be ours. And why shall it be lauful
for us to be called Clereci / that is to say Clerks: if we shall do these
things Our part our lotte (which in the Greek tongue is called Cliros / of
who^ comes this word Clericus is) not ye erthly dominion: but ye heavenly. The
Levites in the old law (which were Clerks) had not perte with their brethern
/ Read in Deute the.x. and the xviii. cha. and in the book of noumbres the
xviii. cha.
and would you yt we should also have the portion of our brethern? wherefore / or
for what intent should I have riches and possessyo^s: which am commanded by ye
words of my lord / Math. 6.
not to be careful so much as for to morrow? Math. 6.
and to who^ he said also these words. Do not gather or hurd up treasur upon
earth. Do not possess gold / neither silver / neither money in your purses.
Math. 10
And it is a harder thing for a rich man to e^tre into ye kingdom of heaven:
Mark. 10
than it is / yt a camel do pass through the eye of a nedle. And therefore he
chose to himself poor ministers / and those which had forsaken all things /
that they might follow him. And he him self also was the ensample of poverty.
So much is even but the handlyng of riches and money / Mark. 10
enemy and contrary to innoce^cie and virtue: not only the possessyon and
dominion of them. Only Judas which had the bags / and did bear such
things as were sent: did play the false traytoure. John^. 13.
and for the love of money / whereunto he was wo^ted: He both repreued and
betrayed his master / lord / and god. I fear therefore o Caesar / lest you will
make me of Peter to be Judas. Harken also what Paul says. We brought nothing
into this world / and it is no doubt that we shall also carry nothing with us
from hence. 1. Tim. 6.
Having meat and drink and clothes to be covered with all: Let us be
contented therewith / for they that cover to be made rich: do fall into
temptation / and into the snare of the devil / and into many desyers / both
unprofitable and also noisome / which do drown men and cast them down into
death and perdition. For covetousness is the rote of all euylles / which
certain men desyring have erred from the faith / and have wrapped themselves
in many dolours and sorrows. But thou being the man of god: flee and eschew
these things. And do you Caesar / bydde me receive those things: which I
ought to eschew and avoid even as venom or poison? Riches is po^son to men
of the church.
And moreover I pray you according to your wisdom consider / what place /
time / or leisure can be left among these things to make sacrifyce / and to
do gods service? The apostles / Acts. 6.
when certain men gruged and were misco^tent that their widows were despised in
ye daily ministeri made answer / that it was not mete or convenient / yt their
selves should leave ye prechi^g of ye word of god. and ministre or serve ye
table. And yet to ministre to widows / is a far other manner thing: than to
exact and require tributes / rentes / customs / collage / than to have care
and charge of the treasure house / to pay soldiers wages / to be enta^gled
with a thousand like cares and busynesses No man / yt is ye soldiar of god: 2.
Tim. 2. Nume. 3.
enta^gleth himself with worldly busynes / says Paul. Did Aaron and other
that were of ye stock of Leuy: meddle with the administration or ordring of any
other thing / than only of the tabernacle of the lord. Read in the book of
Leuitici the.x. cha.
His sons / by cause they had taken other men's fire (which was not mete
nor according) into their sencers / were brent and consumed with fire sent from
heaven. And do you bid or will us to take the fire of worldly riches / which is
both forbidden and also profane: into the holy sencers / Read in the book of
Numeri.
that is to say / into to the office and works belonging to priests. Eleazar
/ Phinees / and other bisshoppes and ministers either of the tabernacle or of
the temple: did they administre or meddle with the ordring of any thing / but
only of that / which belong to the doing of sacrifyce / and to the
worshippyng of god. Do I say / did they administre? nay morouer might they have
administered any other thing: if they would satisfye and fullfyll their office
and duty? which thing if they would not do: they should here the curse of
the lord / which says. Hiere. 48
Cursed be they: which do the work of the lord rechelesly / which
execration or curse / though it may fall upon all men: yet most of all and
principally upon prestes. O / how great is the office of a bisshoppe? how
great a thing is it / to be heed of the church? how great a thing to be
made pastor and ouerseer / and governor of so great a fold of sheep? of whose
hand shall be required the blood of every lamb and sheep / that shall
perisshe and be lost. To whom also it was said. John^. 10.
If thou love me more then other do / so as thou confessest and knoledgest
thyselfe to do: feed my lambs. Again / if thou do love me / so as thou
say: feed my sheep. And the third time also / if thou love me: feed my
sheep. And do you Caesar will me to feed also gottes and hogs: which can not
be fed nor kept all of one / and the same herdes man. Besides this / you ar
willing and aboutward to make me a king / or raither an emperor / that is to
say / heed and chef of kings. But our lord Jesus Christ being both god and man
/ king and priest / wha^ he said yt his self was a king: Herke^ of what
kingdom he did speak. John^. 18.
My kingdom (says he) is not of this world. For if my kingedome were of this
world / Christ's ki^gdome: is not of this world
doutles my servants would fight for me. And what were the first words of
his preachinge / and the thing which he oftentimes rehearsed in his sermons.
was it not this? Do you penance / for the kingdom of heaven is approached and
drawn nere. Math. 4.
The kingdom of god is approached: to the which the kingdom of heuens shall be
compared and lykened. Did he not when he spoke these words / declare / that
the seculare kingdom does nothing apperteyne to him? And therefore not only he
did not desire / nor seche for such manner kingdom: but also / when it was
offered to him / hi would not take it. For when he perceived / John^. 6.
and understood upon a certain time / that the people had purposed and
appointed in their minds / to take him / and to make him king: Christ fled
when the people would have made him King ever them.
he fled into ye solytarines of the mountains / which thing he has given
and taught to us / that be his successors / for to be followed / not only by
his example: but also by his precepte and commandment / saying in this wise.
The princes and governors of the gentiles are lords over the^. Math. ^^
And they which ar greattest / do exercise power and auctorite upon them. It
shall not be so among you / but who so ever is wyllyng among you to be made
greattest: let him be your mynistre. And who so ever would be chefest among
you: shall be your servant / likewise as the son of man has not come to be
mynistred unto: but to mynistre / and to give his life for the redemption of
many. God in the old time (to let you understand / O Caesar) did constitute and
set iuges over the children of Israel to govern them: and not kings / and he
did hate the people desiryng to have a King / and that he gave the^ a king?
it was done / 1. Reg. 8.
because of the hardness of their hertes / Deuteronomy. 24.
even likewise as for the same cause. He had permytted and suffered them to
divorce from their wives / which thing. Math. 19
He had revoked in the new law of the gospel / and shall I tha^ take or receive
a kingdom: which am scasely permitted or suffered to be a judge?.1. Cor^. 6.
Do you not know (says Paul) that saints and holy men shall Judge of this
world? And if the world shall be judged by you are you not unmeet persons to
judge of small trifles? Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much
more than / seculare things? Therefore if you shall have seculare iugementes:
make them iuges in such matters / which are most contemptible and of least
reputation in the church or congregation But the judges did only judge of
matters being in contrauersie and strife between party and party / they did
not also exact tributes. And shall I than exact them: which do know that
our lord demanded of Peter / of whom the erthly kings took tribute or
payment of money / of sons: or else of forayners and strangers? Math 17
And when Peter had made answer that of forayners: Christ said again. Than are
the sons free. Wherefore / O Caesar / if all men be my sons / as certainly
they be: All men shall be free / and no man shall pay any thing. I have no
need therefore of this your donation or gift / whereby I shall get naught else
but labor / such as in any wise I neither ought / neither may suffer or
abide. ye / and whereby I shall moreover of necessite be constrained to exercise
power and auctorite to kille and slay / to punisshe malefactors / to make
batayles and wars / to ransake and spoil cities / and to destroy regions
with fire and sword. For I can not believe / that I could other wise than by
these means be able to save and maintain those things / which you had given
to me. And if I shall do these things: Am I a bisshoppe? Am I the vicare of
Christ? Shall I not than here him thondryng and terryble sayng these words to
me. My house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations. Esaie 56. Mark
11. John^. 12.
And thou have made it a den of thieves. I came not into the world (said the
lord) to Judge or conde^pne the world: but to deliver it / and shall I which
am his successor be the cause of many me^nes death? to whom it was said also in
the person of Peter. Mat, 26.
Turn thy sword again into his own place / for who so ever shall take the
sword in hand: shall perysshe with the sword. It is not laufull for us so
much as to defend our selves with the sword / for Peter would have defended
his master / when he did cut of the servants care / And will you that we
shall occupy the sword for the cause of getyng / or de^e^dyng and saving of
riches. Our power: is the power of ye kayes / witness the lord when he said
to the / Math. 16 The power of ecclesiastical persons which was given to them
by Christ: is the power of the keys.
will I give the kayes of the kingdom of heuens / what so ever thing thou
shalt bind upon earth: it shall be bound also in heuens / and what so ever
thing thou shalt lose upon earth: it shall be also losed in heuens and ye
gates of hell shall not prevail against them. Nothing can be added or put to
/ for to the augme^tyng of this power / of this dignite / of this kingdom /
Spiritualme^ not content with the power of the ke^es: desire worldly Kingdoms
of the devil.
with which who so ever is not content: he desires a certain other kingdom
to him self of the devil / which was bold to say to our lord. I shall give
to the all the kingdoms of the world: if thou wylt fall down upon the ground
/ and worship me. Math. and Luke. 4.
Wherefore Caesar (take no displeasure with that / which I shall say) play not
the deuylles part with me / byddyng me / likewise as he bad / Christ / to
receive the kingdoms of the world / of your gift / for I had lever despise
them: than possess them / and that I may now speak somewhat of the infydeles /
but which I trust / and hope shall be made faithful beleuers: do not make me
to them / of the angel of light / an angel of darkness / whose hertes I
desire and couete to induce to the faith / and to godly living: and not to put
the yoke of seruytude and boundage upon the necks of them / and with the
spirytuall sword / Ephesians, 6.
which is the word of god / and not with the sword of yren / to subdue them
unto me / lest they might be made worse / lest they might wynche or kycke
again / and rebelle / lest they might str^^ me with their horn / lest they
might be prouok^^ through mine error and fault / to blaspheme and speak
evil of the name of god. My desire is to make them my derely beloved sons /
and not my bondemen / to adopte and chose them to my children / not to bye
them / to gendre and begette them spyrytually / and not to make them my bond
servants / to offer the souls of them / a sacrifyce to god: and not their
bodies a sacrifyce to the devil. Learn you at me (says the lord) which am
mylde and humble herted

Math. 11.
Take my yoke upon you / and you shall find rest to your souls. for my youke
is sweet and plesaunte / and my burdayne light and easy. Whose sentence in the
matter here following (to conclude now and make an end) take you as given
between you and me. Give to Caesar those things which apperteyneth to Caesar and
to god those things which belong to god. Math. 22
Wherefore it is so / that neither you ought to leave and forsake your
possesiyons: neither I ought to receive and take those things / that belong
to Caesar / which surely I will never receive: although you would offer them to
me a thousand times. At this oration of Syluester / so godly and according for
an Apostolyke man. What could Constantine have to lay against it for himself
any longer? Seeing than that it is thus: Are not they which say yt this donation
or gift of Constantyne was made in very deed / injurious against Constantyne /
To how many pertes they are injurious which believe the donation of Constantyne
to be true.
whom they judge to have been wyllyng to disherite his own children / and to
weken and feblysshe thempire of Rome? Are they not also iniuryous to the
senators and the people of Rome / to Italy / and to all the West part of the
world / whom they suppose to have suffered thempire to be changed / against
both gods law and man's law? Are they not also injurious against Syluester /
who^ they judge to have accepted the donation unmeet and unseemly for so holy a
man as he was? And are they not injurious also to the pope / to whom they do
judge it laufull / to possess erthly kingdoms / and to govern thempire of
Rome? and (...) all these things hitherto spoken and reherced: apper^ayne here
unto only that it might appear and be open / that Constantyne among so many
impedimentes and lettes / would never give from him self unto Siluester / the
grettest part of the Romayne Empire / which thing these men do say that he
did.

The second princypall part of this oration / in which the author shows /
that / although both Constantine might have been suffered / and had been willing
to make this gift / and Siluester also willing to accept it (the contrary
whereof has been before proved) yet did never Constantine deliver possessyo^ to
Siluester / but the same things remained always still in the hands and
governance of themperours. etc.
But go to now / moreover / if we should believe this donation / whereof your
writ makes mention: it ought also to be sure and out of dout / that
Syluester did accept the same gift. Now thereof have we non euydence: whereby
we might be assured and put out of dout. But paraue^ture you will say / it is
credyble and lykely / that he did accept that grant. ye / ywysse / I think so
/ and that not only he did accept and allow that donation: but also that it
is credyble and lykely / that he did crave and desire it. And that through
continual and importunate requests and prayers: He gat it of Constantine / in
a manner whether he would or not. Why / I say / do you call that thing credible:
which is contrary to the opinion of al men? And all be it there is mention made
of the donation or gift in the pagine or writ of the priuyledge: yet is not
therefore to be supposed and thought / that the donation was accepted and taken.
But rather contrary wise because there is no mention made of the acceptance:
it is to be said / that it was not given. So / than it makes more against you
/ that Syluester refused this gift: than it makes with you / that Co^sta^tine
would give it / and a benefyte is not given to any man against his will: if he
list not to receive it. And we ought not only to deem / that Syluester did
refuse these gifts: but also that he did secretly show / that neither
Constantine might rightfully give them / neither himself laufully receive or
take them. But O blind and always folysshe / and mysaduysed covetousness Let
us grant that you could also bring forth writings / which were true /
incorrupte / sincere / and perfyte of the assente and agremente of Syluester to
the same: Does it follow therefore / that those things has been given in very
deed / which are conceived in the writings? Where was possessyon given? Where
was the delyuering up in to his hands? For if Constantine did give to
Syluester nothing elses but only the deed or writi^g: than was not his mind
to do Siluester a pleasure or good turn: but to give him a mock. you say it
is very lykely / that he / which does give any thing: does also deliver
possessyon of the same. Take heed / and be ware what you speak / seeing that it
is undoubted / that possessyon was never delivered: and it is also doubt /
whether ever the right and title were given or not. It is like to be true /
that he which gave not the possessyon would not give the right and title. Is it
not undoubted and of certaynte / that possessyon was never delivered? which
thing who so ever will deny: he is without all honesty / and utterly shamles.
Did Constantine bring or led Siluester in to the Capitoly house / as it were
one tryumphing / among the reioysynges and joyful showtynges of the multitude
of the Cytizens of Rome / being yet meydels and hethen men? Did he set him in a
chair or seat of gold / all the hole company of senators being assystent
and standing by? And did he command the heed officers / each one of them
according to his dignyte / to salute him and to honor him / as king or chief
gouernoure?

These be the things / which are wont to be done toward new princes: and
not only some one palace (as for example the palace of Lateran) to be
delivered. Did he afterward led hi^ about through all Italy? went he with
him to all the three parts of France? Did he go with him in to both Spaynes?
Went he with him to the Germaynes / and to the resydue of the West regio^s? or
if they both were grieved and loathe to travail in their own persons over so
great a part of the world / and so many diverse lands and countries: whom
made they their deputies? and to whom assygned they so great an office? which
should both in the emperors stead deliver possessyon: and in Syluesters stead
receive and take it? Doutlesse these must needs have been some great men and of
exellent auctorite / and yet who they were: no man can tell. In the time of our
remembrance (because I will pass over the ancient ensamples of old time) we
never saw it otherwise done / when any man has been made lord / either of
any cite / regyon / or prouynce: but that so only possessyon has been iuged
to be given and delivered to him: if they old officers be deposed or put down
/ and new be made and put in their stedes? Though Syluester would not at that
time have required this to be done: yet did it appertain and belong to the
magnifycencie of Constantyne (that he might declare / not only by his words /
but also by his deed / that he did give possessyon to Syluester / to have
deposed his own deputes / lyeutynauntes / and other officers / and to
command other to be put into their roumes / by the nomination and assygnement
of Syluester. No man can say / that possessyon was delivered or given up:
which remains still in the hands of the same men / which possessed it
before / and when the new lord dare not put them from it. But suppose / yt
this thing also does nothing let or withstand / but that we may think never
the less / that Syluester had possessyon and let us say / that all things
were than administered and done contrary to the commune manner and custom / and
contrary to nature: I pray you / after that Constantine was gone away / what
governors and rulers did Syluester make of the province or cytes? what wars
or batayles made he? what nations that were rebels did he oppress or hold
under? or by what captains and officers did he these things / A bitter mock.
you do make answer and say / we do know none of all these things. Verily I
do think the same. All these things were done in the night time / and
therefore no man could se them. Go to now furthermore / I pray you / was
Syluester in possessyon? Who than did put him out of possessyon? For he was not
ever contynually in possessyon / neither any of his successoures / at the least
wise / unto Gregorius Magnus / which also was without possessyon. Now who so
ever is out of possession / and can not prove that himself has been driven out
of possessyon: doutlesse that man had never possessyon. And if he will say /
that himself has had at any time possession: he his stark mad See thou
here now / how I do prove the also to be mad? For else: tell thou me / who
drove the pope out of possessyon? Constantine himself / or his children / or
Iulianus / or else any other emperor? Show the name of him / that did put him
from possessyon. Show the time when it was done. Show wherefore he was first
expulsed. Wherfro^ next / and so forth in order. Whether was he expulsed by
sedicion and manslaughter / or else without these things? Did al nations
conspire against him to gether at one time / or else which of them began first?
What? Did no man at all help or aid him? Not somoch as any of those / which
had been made governors and rulers of cities and proui^ces by Syluester / or by
some other pope? Did he lose all to gether in one day: or else by little and
little. One perte at one time / and a another part at a another time? Did he and
his heed officers make resistance: or else did they at the first rebellyon and
busynes give up their possession and offices / and put themselves from all to
gether? What? the co^querours and over comers? did they not make havoc / with
killi^g and sleing those wretches and vile sort of men / whom they iuged
unworthy of ye empier: to the reuengyng of their own co^tumelie and injury?
to the defense and mayntenau^ce of the dominion: which they had wo^ne and
gotten by force and violence / to the conte^pte and despyte of our relygio^ /
and also to the example of the^ that should come after their time? Did no man
of all those / which were vanquesshed and overcome: fly or ro^ne away? Did no
man lurk and hide himself? was no man afraid? O meruaylouse and wonderful
chance / that the empire of Rome / which was gotten and won with so great
labors / with so much blodeshed should so pesably / so quietly / either be
gotten or lost of the Christen prestes: that no blodshedynge / no war /
neither yet any complaynte has come between / and also (which thing a man
ought no less to marvel at) that no man knows or can tell / by whom this
thing was done / nor at what time / nor how or which way / nor how long it
was in doing. A man might suppose and wene / that Syluester had reigned in the
woddes among trees: not at Rome among men / and that he was driven out of
possessyon / by the winter showers and cold storms: and not by men. Who is he
that does not know / if he be any thing acquai^ted with histories: how many
kings / how many co^sules / how many dictatours / how many protectoures of the
common people / called Tribuni plebis / how many controllers and iuges of
me^nes manners / called Censores / how many chamberlayns called Cediles / have been created and made in Rome? And there is not one of so great a multitude and
nombre / of so ancient and old antyquite unknown to us. We do know also /
how many noble captains have been of the Athenienses / how many of the Thebanes
/ how many of the Lacedemonia^s. we have knowledge of all their fyghtes /
battayles and skirmisshes / made both on the land and on ye water. we do know
also / who has been kings and governors of the Perses / of the Medes / of the
Chaldeis / and of the Hebrews / and of many other peoples and nations / and
how every one of these has received their ki^gdomes / or has holden and
kept it / or how they have lost it / or have recovered it again. But the
empier of Rome / orelles the empier of Syluester: under what manner it has
bego^ne / or how it has ended. when / and by whom no man can tell / nor it is
not known / not so much as in the cite of Rome it self. For I do ask and
demand of you / what records or what authors can you bring forth of those
things? you do answer and say / that you can bring forth none. And are you
not a shamed than / you beestes rather than men: to say that it is lykely that
Syluester has had possessyon? But seeing that you can bring forth no proffes
for your part: I shall on the contrary part show euydently / that
Constantine / even unto ye last day of his life. And so forth from hi^ / that
all the emperors each of the^ after other had the possessyo^s of these
realms: so yt you shall not have one word to speak. But it is a very hadre
thing / and a great maistri / as I suppose: to show this. Turn over and read
ye histories both in Greek and latin / Read the other authors and writers
which have made mention of those times / yet shall ye find none / that
disagreeth from other in this thing. Let one testimony of a thousa^de
suffyce. Eutropius / which saw Constantine / Eutropius
which saw the three sons of Constantine whom he left behind him / emperors
of ye world which writes in this wise of Iuliane / which was son to
Co^sta^tines brother, Iulianus apostata.
This Iulianus / which was a deacon in ye church of Rome / and made emperor
also: fell from the true faith / to worshippi^ge of ydoles. He governed the
e^pier / and with great preparation and ordinance he made war upon ye
Parthians At the which viage and setti^g forth I was present also mine own
self. This Eutropius (I say) neither would have passed over with syle^ce the
donatio^ of the empier of ye West regio^s / neither would he have written a
little after / in this wise of Iouiane / which succeeded next after Iuliane.
Iouiane the emperor next successor to Iuliane the Apostata.
He made peace with Sapore. A nedfull peace verily: but a shamfull peace /
chau^ging ye bonds of the^pier / and gyue^g up a certain portion of ye Romayne
e^pier / which thing never happened before: syns ye Romayne e^pier was first
begone. Moreover our legions at Claudiu^ propontiu^ Telestinu^ / and at
Numantiu^ in Spain / and in Numidie / in token of subjection / were caused to
pass through under a spear (as it was the manner than) but yet was there none
of the bownes or terms of the Empier given and delivered up. Here in this
place it pleases me to speak to you / ye popes of Rome: which have dyed of
very late time / and to the Eugenie which art alive / but yet with the leave
and license of Felix / why do you so proudely brag and boste of the donation
of Co^stantyne? why do you so oftentimes manace and thrette^ certain kings and
princes: that you will revenge ye taking of the Empier from you? and how do you
extorte of Caesar wha^ he is tobe crowned / a certai^ co^fessyo^ and knolegi^g
of servitude and subjection to you / and likewise of certai^ other princes / as
of the king of Naples / and of Sicilie which thing never any of the ancient
popes of Rome in old time did? Not Damasus of Theodosius not Syryne of
Archadius / not Anastasius of Honorius / not Ihon^ of Iustiniane / not other
most holy popes of other most noble emperors / but they have always openly
granted / Rome and Italye with the provinces before named to belong to the
e^perours / and therefore ye peaces of gold coined in those times (because I
will not speak of other monume^tes / and of ye temples of the Cite of Rome)
whereof some are yet remaynyng: has their scripture written / not in Greek
lr^es / but in latin lr^es / both the coins of Co^sta^tyne after he was become
christian: and also of ye other emperors / almost every one after him in order
/ of which coins / I have my self many in mine own hands / co^munely having
under the Image of the cross / this subscription. Concordia orbis. A thausande
such ioynes should there be found also of the popes: if ever you had been the
chief governors and rulers of Rome / whereof now there is none found / neither
of gold / neither of silver / neither is it reported or said / yt ever any man
has seen any such / and yet could it not be otherwise chosen / but ye nedely
he must have had at yt time his propre coin: who so ever held tha^ the^pier
of Rome / at ye lest wise under the image of our savior / or else of Peter. Oh
/ ye ignorance and folysshnes of men / do you not se / if the donation of
Co^sta^tyne be true / yt no thing at al is left to ye emperors? De latino
loquor. Lo / I pray you / what manner e^perour / what manner king of the
Romans shall he be: whose kingdom if any man had / and had nothing else beside
/ he should have utterly nothing at al? wherefore if it be euyde^t (as it is) yt
Siluester had never possession / yt is to say / ye Co^sta^tine did never give
or deliver possession: it follows also undoubtedly / ye Constantine never gave
(as I have said) so much as right or title to possess the^ / except you do
say / yt the right was geuyn / but the possessyon not delivered for some cause
or consyderation: ye I wysse / he gave that thing / which he knew should not
come to pass He gave that: which he could not deliver. He gave that / which he
knew was not possible to come into the hands of him / to whom it was given:
before that it should be destroyed. He gave a gift / which should never be of
strength or stand in any stead / or at the least / not before.v.C. years were
expired. To speak this / or think it: is plain madness. But now it is time
(lest I be made to long and tediouse) seeing that we have cut and mangled the
cause of our aduersarys to give it his dedly wound / and to kyl it with one
stroke.

The third princypall part of this oration / in which the author shows /
that Constantine was become Christen before that Siluester was pope / and that
those gifts which Constantine gave: were given to the pope next after
Siluester / which same also were but mean or small things / and no more than
suffycient to the popes sustentation.
EVery history almost / which is worthy the name of an history: tells and
makes mention / that Constantine / Constantyne was made Christen of a child /
long before that Siluester was pope.

Eusebius the author of the ecclesiastical history.


even when he was a child: became Christian with his father Consta^tius / and
ye long time before that Siluester was pope / as Eusebius ye writer of the
ecclesiastical history / whom Rufyne a man right exellently learned / has
translated / into the latyne tongue / and has also added two books of his own
time / which were both of them welnere in Co^stantines time. Besides this / we
have also ye testimony and witness of ye pope of Rome / which not only was
present at the doing of these things: but also bare a great rule in the same /
being also not a witness: but the author or doer / not ye teller or rehercer
of another man's busynes: but of his own. He whom I do mean: Melchiades
pope next before Syluester.
is Melchiades ye pope next before Siluester which says in this wise. The
church was come even unto this point now: yt not only people and nations / but
also the princes of Rome / which held thempier of the world: did come
together to the faith of Christ and to the sacraments of the faith. Among whom
/ the most devout man Constantine first of all other openly gettyng the faith
and belefe of the troth: gave license through out all ye world / to as many
as were under his dominion and governance / not only to be made Christen men:
but also to build churches / and he ordained lands to be given. And to be
short the before rehearsed emperor gave exceeding great gifts / and he began
first the buyldinge of the church of saint Peter / in so much that he did
forsake his imperial seat or place: and granted it to the use and behofe of
blessed Peter / and his successors. Lo / here Melchiades makes mention of
nothing that was given by Constantine: but only the palace of Laterane / and
certain other lands / of which Gregory very often makes mention in his
regestre. Where than are they now / which do not suffer it to be doubted /
whether the donation of Constantine be of value and strength / or not? seeing
that the said donation or gift both was made before Syluesters time / and was
also of private things only? which thing although it is plain and evident
enough: yet that not withstanding / we must somewhat dispute and reason of that
privilege / which these folyssh fellows are wont to allege and bring forth.

The fourth pri^cipall perte of this oration / in which the author shows it
to be untruly said / that the copye or example of this donation is found in
the decrees / or else taken out of the history of saint Syluester / and also
declares what folysshe / what impossyble / what barbarous / and what
repugnau^t and contrary things / with other vnresonablenes / is contained in
the said copy. and besides this he makes mention of the feigned or friuolouse
donation of certain other emperors. And last of al he shows / that in case
it were / so that Syluester or any other pope had at any time possessed these
things: yet being ones put out of possessyo^ / and so long co^tinui^g
dispossessed as they have done: they ca^ not now after so long space of time
claim the^ again / neither by the law of god nor man. etc.
ANd first of all to begyne with / not only that fellow which would feign seem
to be Gratian which added certain things to the work of Gracian / is to be
repreued of lewd vnshamfastnes: but also they are to be reproved of ignorance
and folyshenes / The pagine of the donation / is not found in the old decrees
collected by Gratian.
which do wene or suppose / that the pagine of the privilege is contained in
Gratians work / which thing neither any learned man did ever suppose: and
again it is not found in the most auncye^t and eldest books of the decrees /
and if in any place Gratian should have made mention of this thing / he should
have done it not in this place (where they do put it interrupting and breking
of the order and contexte of his oration and speech) but rather in that place /
where he speaks of the paction and couenaunte of Ludouyke. Besides this there
are two thousand places in the decrees: which do prove this place not to be
true / of the which that place is one / where the before rehearsed words of
Melchiades are alleged. Some men do say / that he which added this chapitour
to the decrees: was called Palea / Palea in latin sygnifyeth chafe.
either for that this was his very right name: or else because these things /
which he did add or put to of his own / if they be co^payred to Gratiane are
iuged to be / as it were / chafe nere to the corn. But how so ever the
truth is concerning this: it is a very great shame and an vnshamely thing to
believe / that collector and gatherer of the decrees / either did not know these
things / which have been added and put to syns of Palea: or else did set greatly
by them / and accompe and take them for true things. This is well than / we
are sufficed / we have the victory and our own purpose. First that Gratiane
does not say this thing so as they belyed him: but moreover he denies it and
preueth it false and untrue / as easily it may be perceived by a thousand
places and mo. Secondarelye / that they do allege for them selves one man
alone / and that such one as is unknown / and of none auctorite / a tryfler /
and so folysshe also: that he has added certain things of his own faynyng
to the said Gratiane: which can not agree with the other sayings of the same
Gratian / is this than this author / that you bring forth? do you use the
testimony of him alone? Do you recite a folyshe writtyng of him in paper / for
the confyrmation of so great a matter: against six hundred kings of proffes?
But I looked for it / that you should have showed little Images of gold /
tytles and wrytynges in marble / and a thousand authors. But you do say / that
Palea him self brings forth the author / and shows the very fountain of
the history / and calls to witness Gelasius the pope / with many other
bisshoppes Of the history (says he) of Siluester which blessed Gelasius in
the counsel of.lxx. bysshoppes reports to be read of Catholyke men / and
says / that many churches does follow this same manner / according to the old
ancient usage / in ye which history it is read / Constantyne. etc. And a
great deal before where mention is made of books which are to be read / and
which not to be read: he has said also / we do know that the acts of saint
Siluester the bishop are read of many catholyke men in the cite of Rome: al
be it that we do not know ye name of him that wrote them / and the churches
according to the old usage do follow the same. Oh / here is a wonderful
authorite / a meruaylouse testimony and record / and a strong and inuincyble
probation. I grant you this / that Gelasius said this: where he speaks of
the council of.lxx. bysshoppes / did he therefore say that the pagine or copy
of the preuilege is read in the life or acts of saint Siluester? and that at
Rome: the auctorite of which church many other churches do follow / which
thing I do not deny: but I grant / confess / and knowledge / ye / and I do
offer my self to be a witness thereof with Gelasius / but what ca^ this thing
profyght or avail you? but only that it might appear / that you would have
lied / in alledgynge and bringing forth witnesses and records. His name is
not known / which added this to ye decrees / and yet he alone does say this
thing / his name is not known / which wrote ye history of Siluester and yet
he alone is brought forth / and that falsely for a witness and a record. And
do you good and wise men judge this to be sufficient / ye / and more than
sufficient / to the testimony and witnessyng of so great a matter? But
consider now and se / how great difference there is between your judgment and
mine. I truly? al though this priuylege were contained in ye history of
Syluester: The historye of Siluester is but a feigned and a lyyng historye.
would not for all that think that it were to be accounted and taken for true.
For as much as that history is none history: but a feigned and a shamlese
lyeng tale / as I shall show and declare herafter / and also / seeing that none
other man / namely being of any auctorite: does make any mention of this
priuylege. Iacobus voragine^sis / the writter of sa^^es lives.
And Iacobus Voraginensis / which bare great favor and love to the clergy as
being himself an arche bisshoppe: yet in his stori of sai^tes lives / and of
the acts of holy men / speaks not one word of the donation of Constantine:
but passes it over with silence / as being but a lyeng fable / and not worthy
to be put among ye acts of Syluester / in which deed he gives in a manner
sentence against them: if any would have put these things in writing. But I
will draw that falsyfier and forger of writtes / and very chafe in deed / and
not whete: in to judgment / writhyng his neck / whether he will or not. What
say thou false forger of writings? How fortuneth it / or whereof is it long
/ that we do not read this priuylege among the acts and deeds of Siluester? I
suppose this is a gesone book / and hard to be found / A bitter Irome.
and there is but very few that have it / and it is kept secretly / even
likewise as the Regester or Calendar books of the Romans were kept in the
old time of the bisshoppes / and as the books of Sibillee were kept of the.x.
men / and it is written in the language of the Greeks / of the Jews / or of
the Caldayes. Gelasius records / that it is read of many Catholyke men.
Iacobus Voraginensis makes mention of it. We also have seen a thousand copies
of it / and that written in the old time / and they are red almost in every
Cathedral church / upon saint Siluesters day / and yet no man says / that
ever he read therein this that thou forgest and ymaginest. No man that ever he
has seen / no man that ever he dreamed of any such things. It is paraue^ture
some other certain history / which other history shall that be? I know none
other history / neither I do judge that thou doste mean of any other history
/ than this / for thou spekest of that history which Gelasius says / read
often in many chuches / but in this history we do not find the priuylege / if
tha^ it be not read in the life of Siluester: why do thou say that it is
read there? why durst thou be so bold to bourde in so great a matter? and to
mock and deceive the couetouse desire of light and folysshe persons?

But I am a fool / which do rather rebuke his boldness: than the peuysshnesse
of them / which gave credence to him / if any man among the Greeks / among
the Hebrews: ye / among the Barbarians / should say this thing is found
written: would you not bydde him name the author / and the book to be brought
forth / and the place to be expowned and declared of some faithful exposytour:
er ever you would give credence to it? Now mention is made of your own
language / of a book most co^munely known / and yet you do not make
inquisytion or any search of so vnbeleuable a deed / or else when you do not
find it written: yet you ar so light of crede^ce geuyng / yt you do account it
for written and for true / and thi^kyng this title to be suffycient / you make
great trouble and business in the world / and as though there were no doubt
in it at all: you do put them in fear with war and other threttenynges /
that do not give credence to you?

O good Jesus: how great is the strength / how great is the divinity or godly
power of the troth? which by it self / without any great enforcement or
labor / defends it self from all gyles and deceytes / that not without a
cause / when a great contention was risen up before king Darius / Read in.iiii.
chapt. of the third book of Esdras in the Bible.

diverse things: at the last the vyctorie and chief price was geuyn to veryte

and not with seculares or lay men: I must rehearse rather ecclesyasticall
examples / than seculare examples. Judas Machabeus / when by sendynge the

seal this donation of the world / only with paper and ynke? namely seeing
that the forger of this fable / who ever he was / does make Consta^tyne in the
pagyne of that priuylege / saying these words: that he did suppose / that
there should not lack men after his time / which through wicked covetousness
would break and disanull this donation or gift. Fear you this thing / O
Constantyne / An apostrophe or tournynge of the speech to Co^stantyne.
and do you not beware and provide: lest they which would take away Rome from
Syluester / might also privily convey away this deed or writ in paper? What?
Syluester himself? Does he no thing at all for himself? Does he so remyt
all things to Constantyne? Is he so careless / so slow / and so peakishe?
does he in so great a busynes no thing provide for himself? nothing for his
church? nothing for them that should come after his time? Behold here / O
Constantyne / to what manner man you do commit the administratyon and
governance of the empier of Rome: which slepeth in so great a matter and in
the thing / whereof should come either so great lucre: or else so great
ieoperdy and danger. For the paper wherein the priuylege is contained / ones
taken away: doutles the donation or gift can not be proved to have been made in
process of time. The mad fellow calls it the pagyne of the privilege.
Call thou the donation of the world / a privilege? (for it pleases me to
rebuke him / as if he were present) and wylt thou / that this privilege was
written in a pagine? and that Constantyne used such manner oration and speech?
if the title be folish and against reason: what manner things shall we judge the
resydue to be / yt do after follow? Constantinus i^perator quarto die sue
baptismatis priuilegium To. ecclesiae pontifici contulit / vt in vrbe Roma
sacerdotes ita hunc caput habeant / sicut iudices regem. Co^stantyne the
emperor / the fourth day after he was Christened: gave a priuylege to the
bishop of the church of Rome / that in the cite of Rome the priests should
take him for heed / even so as the iuges do take the king. These words be
contained in the very historye of Syluester / by reason whereof it can not be
douted / in what place this privilege is sygnifyed to have been written. But
after the manner of them / which do deuyse and forge lies or lesynges / he
began with the truth: to thentent / that he might cause men to give credence
to the false and untrue things that do follow. Even likewise as Sinon in
Virgyle / said first to Priamus these words. Eneidos secundo.
Without fail noble king all the troth I shall say / and that I am a Greek
borne I shall not say nay. And in this he said truth / but afterward he
made many false leasinges: so in this place does our subtyle and crafty Sinon
/ Sinon.
which wha^ he had begone with the truth: by and by after did add these
words. In eo priuilegio ita inter caetera legitur / vtile iudicauimus vna cum
omnibus satrapis nostris / and vniuerso senatu / opeimatibus etia^ and cum
cucto populo imperio To. ecclie subiacenti / vt sicut beatus Petrus in terris
vicarius dei videtur esse constitutus: ita and pontifices ipsius principis
Ap^orum vicem / principatus potestatem / amplius quam terrenae imperialis
nostrae serenitatis mansuetudo habere videtur / co^cessam a nobis nostroque
imperio obtineant.

In that privilege among other things / thus it is read. We with all our
dukes and earls / and with the hole senate / and the optimates / and with all
ye people being subjects under the empier and governance of the church of
Rome / have iuged and thought it profitable / that likewise as blessed Peter
seems to have been constituted and ordained the vicare of god here in earth:
even so the popes also being the successors of the prince of the Apostles /
should obtain and have power and dominion granted to them of us and our
empier / more largely / than the myldenes of our erthely e^periall serenite
should seem to have. O cursed and false wreche / the same history / whereof
thou take record and witness: tells / that it is long time ere before ever
they which were of ye senatorie order / would take upon them ye Christen
relygion / and that Co^sta^tyne gave money to poor men: that he might thereby
provoke them to be baptized. And say thou / that forth with within.iiii.
days / the senate / ye noble and great estates / with ye rulers of proui^ces /
as though they had been than already Christened: did make decrees with the
emperor / to put the church of Rome to honor and worship? Wylt thou
besides this / that Satrapae / that is to say / dukes or earls / were present?
O stones / O dull stocks. use the emperors to speak after this manner? Are
the decrees of the Romans wont to be expressed in such forms of words?
Who ever herd Satrapas / that is to say / dukes or earls / to be named in the
counsayls or assembles of the Romans? I do not remember / that ever I red /
any man / I do not say only being a Romayne / but also not so much as in the
province belonging to the Romans: to be named a duke or an earl. But this
fellow calls them the dukes and earls of the emperor / and he sets them
before the senators / not withstanding that all honores / ye / even those
also / which are given to the prince: are decreed only by the senators / and
the people of Rome joined with them. And this is the cause / why we do se in
the stones / or brazen tables / or in the coins of old antiquyte / either
these two letters. SC.1. Senatus consulto / that is to say / by the decree of
the senators: or else these four letters. SPQR.1. Senatus / Populusque /
Romanus. that is to say / the senators and the people of Rome. And as
Tertullyane makes mention / when Pontius Pilatus had written to Tiberius Caesar
/ of the merueylouse and wonderful works and deeds of Christ / and not to the
senators (for the heed officers and governors had been wont to write of great
matters unto ye senate) the senators took this thing grievously / and were
greatly dyscontente therewith. And when Tiberrius gave this prerogatyue / that
Jesus should be worshipped for a god: they gaynsayde it / only for the preuy
indignation and grudge which they had in their minds: for that the dignyte of
the senatorie order was offended and hurt. And that thou may know of how
great strength the aucorite of the senate is: they optayned that he should not
be worshipped for a god. How great the auctorite of the senate was.
Besides this thou say the Optymates whom we understand either to be the
chief men in the common weal / and than why do thou name these: sei^g there
is no word spoken of other officers? or else by optimates we understand those
/ which are not Populares / that is / which seche not to get ye beneuole^ce and
good will of ye people but are ye favorers and defe^ders of the best men and
of ye good perties or sides / as Cicero shows and declares in a certain
oration / that such are called optimates. And therefore we do say / that Caesar
before that the common weal was oppressed: was Popularis / and that Cato was
one of the optimates / the dyffere^ce of which two words Salust has
declared. And they which are called optimates in this sygnifycatio^ / are no
more said to be called to counsel: tha^ other populare persons or other good
men. But what marvel is it / if the optimates be there made of counsel:
where the hole people (if we give crede^ce to this man) did judge with ye senate
and Caesar? and that ye people being subject to the church of Rome. And which
people is this? The people of Rome? why is it than not called ye people of
Rome: rather than the people subject? What new and strange co^tumelye / and
meruaylouse rebuke is this unto yt cytize^s of Rome: of who^ ye best and most
exelle^te poet Vergyle reports in this wise. Tu regere i^perio populos
Roman meme^to. Thou people of Rome / remember thou to govern and rule people.
That people which is the governor and ruler of other peoples: is called here
Populos subiace^s a people subject / which thing was never herd heretofore.
For in this (as Gregorius witnesses in many epistles) diffreth ye bishop of
Ro^e from other bisshoppes: for yt he only is the governor of a free people.
But this admitted / that it were even so as thou say Are not other peoples
also subjects? do thou mean of other peoples also? how could it be
possible / yt all the people being subjects to the church of Rome / were
within three days p^se^t at the maki^g of that decree? how be it all ye vile
sort and the rascal of ye people I am sure / did not judge or decree. Moreover
/ why should Constantine call the people subject: before that he had made them
subject to the pope of Rome Again / why are they / which are called
subjects: said to have borne a rule / in ye maki^ge of the decree? Besides
this / they are said to have decreed eue^ this same thing: that their selves
should be subjects: and that he to whom they were all ready subjects: should
have them subjects unto hi^ self. What other thing doste thou folysshe
wretch / with those folysshe and mad imaginatio^s: but only show and declare
/ that thou haste will and desire to deceive and begyle: and that thou lackest
power to do it. Elige^tes nobis ipsu pri^cipe^ apostolorum / vel eius vicarios
/ firmos apud deu else patrones / et sicut nostra est terrena i^perialis
pote^cia: ita eius sacrosa^cta^ To. ecclesia^ decreuimus venerater honorare /
and a^plius quam nr^m iperiu^ terrenu^que thronu^ / sede^ sacratissima^ beati
Petri gloriose exaltare / tribue^tes ei potestate^ / et gloria^ / et dignitate^
/ et vigore^ / and honorificencia^ i^perialem. Chosi^g the prince of apostles
hi^ self or his vicars: to be steadfast / and sure patro^s and defe^ders to us
/ before god. And even as our erthly e^periall power is: so have we decreed /
reverently to honor his hole and worshipful church of Rome / and gloriously
to exalte ye most worshipful seat of blessed Pet a great deal more / tha^ our
e^pier and erthly throne / gyuyng to it power / and glory / and dignite / and
strength / and honorifice^ce e^periall. Lactance firmiane wrote so eloquently:
that saint Iherome calls him ^luuiu^ Tulliane eloquentlye / the flowynge
river of Tullys eloquence,
Reuyue and wax alive again a little while / O Lacta^ce Firmiane: and relyst
this ass cryeng out so maynely. He has so great delight and pleasure in ye
clateri^g noise of proud and puffed words: that he repeteth and i^culketh
often again ye same things / which he had said not long before. Did the
scribes of the^perours (because I will not say the horsekepers) speak after
this manner and facyo^ / in thy time? Consta^tinus elegit sibi illos / not
patronos: but esse patronos. He put i^ ye infynityue mode esse / to make ye
nombre of the words join more trymly to gether. An honest and a worshypfull
cause forsothe / to speak barbarouslye: that thine oratyon or speech may
run more plesauntely and goodlye / if it be so that any plesau^tnes or
goodlynes may be in so rought a style. Chosing ye prince of the apostles / or
his vicars. you do not chose O Co^sta^tine / Peter and his vicars: but either
him excludi^g them / or them excludi^g him. And he calls ye popes of Rome
Peter's vicars: as though Peter were yet alive: or as though the popes were of
less dignite than Peter was. Is not this also a barbarouse manner of speaki^g.
Co^cessa^ a nobis nostroque imperio. Granted to the^ by us and our e^pier? as
who should say / that the e^pier had mind or purpose / and also power to
grant. And he was not contented nor thought it enough to say, Obtinea^t /
that they should have and obtain: except he did say also / co^cessa^ /
granted / natwithsta^ding that ye one of those words alone were sufficient.
And that same / where he calls them steadfast and sure patrons: is very
elega^tly spoken. For god wot / he will / that they be steadfast and sure: lest
they might be corrupted with money / or else might shrike and fall for fere. And
this saying also. Nostra terrena imperialis potestas / or erthly e^peryall
power / where he joins two adiectyues without a co^iu^ction copulatyue / and
that also Venera^ter honorare / worshipfully to honor / and that Nostrae
i^perialis serenitatis ma^suetudo. This gere sauoureth and smells of the
eloquence of Lacta^ce: where he speaks of the power and governance of the
e^pire: to name serenite and myldnes or ge^telnes: and not highness or majesty.
which saye^g is also puffed and blown up with swollen pride: even likewise as
that is: where he says. Gloriose exaltare per gloria^ / et potestate^ / et
dignitate^ / et vigore^ / et honorificentia^ i^periale^. Gloriously to exalte
by glory and power / and dignite / and strength / and honorifice^ce e^peryall.
which manner of speki^g seems to be taken out of yt Apocalipse or revelation of
sait John^ / Apocalipsis the.v. cha.
where it is said.

Worthy is the la^be / which has been slain: to take or receive power / dignite
/ wisdom / fortitude or strength / honor / and benedictio^. He seems also
oftentimes (as it shall evidently appear herafter) Co^sta^tine to take upon him
ye tytles and praises belo^gi^g to god / and couetyng to follow ye manner of
speki^g used in ye holy scripture: which he had never red. Atque decernetes
sa^cimus vt pri^cipatu^ teneat / ta^super quatuor seeds / Alexa^drina^
Antiochena^ / Hierosolimitana^ / Consta^tinopolitana^: quam etia^ super oe^s
inuniuerso orb terrarum dei ecclesias / etiam pontifex qui per tempora ipsius
sacrosa^cre Roecclesiae extiterit celsior and princeps cunctis sacerdocibus /
and totius mundi existatis / and euis iudicio / quae ad cultum dei and fidem
Christianorum / vel stabilitate^ procurandam fuerint: disponantur. we also by
our decree do establysshe and steadfastly ordain / that he have the chief
governance / as well upon the ^oure sees / of Alexandrie / Antioche /
Jerusalem / and Constantinople: as also upon all the churches of god / in the
hole world. Also that the bisshoppe of the said worshipful church of Rome /
which shall be from time to time: be highest and chief heed of all prestes and
of the hole world / and that all things which shall appertain to the
honoring of god / and to the procuring of the Christen ^ayth / and the
stabilyte thereof: be disposed and ordered by his judgment.

Here I do pass over his barbarouse and corrupt manner of speaking / that ye
said / Princeps sacerdotibus for princeps sacerdotum and that he did put these
two words / Extiterit and existat / both in one place and that when he had
said / and in vniuerso orb terrarum He adds again / et totius mudi. As if it
were a certain sondrie thing / or as it he would heaven to be contained also /
which is a part of the world: wha^ a great part of the world was not under
the dominion of Rome / and that he says. ad fidem Christianorum / vel
stabilitatem pro curandam. making a distinccion and separation of the faith of
Christen men / and the stabilyce thereof / as though these two might not be
both to gether at one time / and that he me^gled these two words. Decernere
and sancire. And that he makes Constantine now to decree: as if he had not
iuged before with other / and as though he purposed to decree and ordain a
penalty / and that he makes hi^ to establissh together with ye people.
Besides al these things / I say / what Christian man can suffer this and not
sharply chastise ye pope which suffers this / ye / and also hereth it gladdly
/ and reherceth it / that where as the Romayne see has taken primacie and
preeminence of Christ (as the.viii. synod has declared / Gratiane bering
witness / and many of the Greeks) now it is said to have received it of
Constantine / being yet scasely a Christen man / as it were of Christ himself?
Would that most discrete and lowly prince have herd this? would the most godly
and virtuous pope have herd this? god shield them both from so great sin
and abomination. Again / stands this with reason / or may it be naturally
/ that any man might speak of Constantinople / as of one of the patriarchall /
seattes: which yet was neither Patryarchall / neither any se at all / neither
a Christen cite / neither so named / nether yet builded / nether so much as
purposed or appointed to be builded? For the privilege was granted within three
days after that Constantine was made a Christen man / at which time it was
yet Bizantium: and not Constantinople. Let me be accounted and taken for a
liar: if this folisshe fellow does not confess the same him self. For nere
unto the end of privilege: he writes these words. Vnde congruum prospeximus
/ nostru^ imperium et regiam potestate^ orie^talibus tra^sferri regionibus / et
in Bizantinae prouintiae optimo loco nomini nostro ciuitatem edificari et illic
nostrum co^stitui imperiu^. Wherefore we have iuged it mete and according / that
our empier and royal power be translated to the regions of the Este / and that
in the best place of the province of Bizantie: a cite be builded to our name /
and that there our empier be co^stituted and set. If he did now but purpose to
translate his empier to another place: he had not yet translated it. If he were
but minded to constitute and set his empier there: he had not yet constituted
or set it there. So likewise / if he was than but in purpose to build a cite
/ he had not builded it as yet. He ought not therefore to have made mention of
it as of one being patriarchal / as of one of the four sees / as of a christian
cite / as of one so named / as of one allredy builded: of the building whereof
he was not yet so much as in thought and purpose / after ye mind of ye
history / which Palea brings forth to witness and record. But this be
(whether he be Palea / or who so ever he be / who^ the other does follow) does
not parceyue and se / that he desagreeth from him / for there it is said /
that Constantine not of his own voluntary mind: but by the admonition and
warnyng of god / as he slepte / not at Rome: but at Biza^cie / and not within
few days but after certain years was purposed and determined to build the
cite / and that he gave to it the name / which he was warned and taught to
give in his sleep / who than does not see / that he which made the privilege:
was long after the time of Constantyne? and that whiles he would garnysshe and
set forth his lie: he forgate that he had said before / that these things were
done at Rome / the third day after that Constantine was baptized / so that the
comune old proverb may very accordyngly be applied to him. Me^dacem memorem
esse oportet. Alyer had need to be good of remembrance: Moreover Bizantium the
proui^ce / (as he calls it) was nothing large enough for the buyldyng of so
great a Cite / for Constantynople did contain all old Byzantiu^ / within the
walls of it self / and yet this fellow says / that a city should be builded
in the best place of Bizantiu^. Besides this / he will that Thracia / wherein
Bizanciu^ stood: is in the Eest part / and yet in very deed it inclyneth
toward the north / I suppose or wene that Constantyne knew not the place
which he had chosen out among other / to the buyldyng of his cite: in what
quarter or part of the world it was sytuate / neither whether it were a cite
or a prouynce / neither of what measure and largeness is was Ecclesus beatorum
aplorum Petri and Pauli / pro continuatione luminariorum: possessionu^ predia
contulimus / and rebus diuersis eas ditauimus and per nostram imperalem
iussionem sacram tam in orient / quam in occidente / quam etia^ a septentrione
et meridionali plaga / videlicet et in Iudia / Grecia / Asia / Thracia /
Africa / and Italia / vel diuersis insulis / nostra largitate / Et concessimus
/ ea prorsus ratione vt per manus beatissimi pacis nostri Siluestri su^mi
pontificis / successorumque eius oia dispona^tur.

We have given certain lands and possessions to the church of the blessed
apostles Peter and Paul / for the continuation and vpholdyng of lyghtes / and
we have endowed and enriched the same churches with diverse things / and by
our sacred imperial commandment of our lyberalyte and bountuousnes / we have
granted to them our lyberty and power / as well in the Eest / as in the weste:
and in the north / and in the south clymates or pertes of the world / that is
to wit / both in Inde / Grecelande / Asye / Tracia / Affrike / and Italye /
or in diverse Islands / and that utterly in such wise and manner: that all
things be dysposed by the hands of most blessed Siluester our fader and pope
/ and by the hands of his successors /

O false wretch / were there at that time churches or temples in Rome /
dedicated to Peter and Paul? who had build them? who durst have been bold to
build them? seeing that than there was no place for christen men (as the
history says) but only secret corners / and lurkyng places: or if there had been any temples in Rome dedicated to those apostles / yet they were none such
/ in which it were mete and according that so great serges or tapers should be
lyghted / as being but little or small chapels / not temples or churches / and
only oratories within their own houses: and not open great churches? he ought
therefore / not to have taken care / and made provision for the lyghtes of the
temples: before that he had taken care for the temples selves. What say
thou / which make Constantyne called Peter and Paul / beatos / that is to
say blessed / and Siluester when he was yet living / beatissimu^ / most blessed
/ and called his own commandment (which had been not long before an
infydele or paynyme) sacred and holy? were so great things to be given for the
vpholdynge of lyghtes / that all the hole world should be made weary thereby? Or
which lands are those / namely of possessions? we are wont to say
Possessions of lands / but not lands of possessions / thou gyuest lands and
lord ships / and do not declare nor express which lands they be / thou
have enriched the^ with diverse things: and do not show neither when /
neither with what things thou wylt that the plages or regions of the world be
disposed by Siluester: but thou do not show / in what manner or kind of
disposyng or ordering / thou haste given and granted these things before.
Why doste thou now sygnifye and give knowledge / that thou haste begone this
day to honor the church of Rome / and to grant the privilege to it? do
thou this day grant and give? do thou this day make it rich or endowe it?
why do thou than say / we have granted / and we have made rich or endowed?
wottest thou what thou spekest / or what thou meanest thou beeste? I speak to
the / the forger of this lie: and not to the very good prince Constantyne. But
why do I require or look for any wisdom / or any lernyng in the: which art
not endowed with any wit or any literature at all as it appears right well when
thou say Luminarioru^ for Luminariu^ and orientalibus trasferri regionibus:
where thou ought to have said / ad orie^tales tra^sferri regiones? Moreover
which be those.iiii. plages or quarters of the world? which reckenest thou to
be ye eest plage? Thracia? does it not (as I said before) inclyne to the
north? Jury? but it lies more toward the south / as being nere unto Egipte /
which also call thou the west plage? Italy / But these things were done in
Italye / which no man living or abydyng there: does call the west plage or
region / for as much as we do say / the hispaynes to be in ye west. And Italye
on the one side / leans to the southe / and on the other side / leans to
the north: rather than to the west. Which call thou the septemtrionall or
north plage? Thracia? But thou thyselfe shalt have it to be on the east side /
or else Asya? But this it self alone occupies and possesses the hole east.
And the north is commune to it and Europa / which call thou the meridionall
or south plage. No dout of it / thou meanest Affricke. But why did thou not
express and show forth some province by name? except peradventure the
moors of Ethiopia were under the empier of Rome. And yet never ye less Asia
and Aphrike have no place here / where the world is divided in to four parts
/ and the regyons of each part are rehearsed by name: but when it is divided in
to three parts / Asye / Affrike / and Europe. Except thou doste name Asya for
the Asyatike province / and Aphrike for the province / which is nere unto the
people of Getulya / which I can not see / why they should be principally and
chefely named. Would Constantine have spoken in such wise / when he had spoken
of the four principal parts of the world: that he would have named these
regions / and not have named other? and that he would have begone with Jury /
which is rekened and accounted a part of Syria / and which at that time was
no longer Jury / for as much as Jerusalem was destroyed / and the Jews
chaced from thence and welnere destroyed / in so much that I do suppose / that
scacely any Jew was than remainynge in his own country: but all inhabytid
other nations? Where I beseech you / was Jury than / which was no longer
called Jury / even likewise as we do se now at this day the name of that
land destroyed? And even as when the Chananies were driven out / that region
was no longer called Chanania but the name being changed / was called Iudia of
the new inhabytauntes the Jews: so when the Jews were banisshed and driven
out / and strangers did i^habyte it: it was no longer called Jury. Thou
namest Iewrie and Thracia / and Ilelandes: but the Hispaynes / and Fraunces /
and Germayne / thou thynkest not worthy to be named / and when thou spekest of
other languages / as Hebrew / Greek / and Barbarouse: thou speak not of any
of the provinces using the Latyne tongue or language. I perceive now / thou
dydest therefore ouerchippe or leave them out here: that thou myghtest contain
or comprehend them afterward in the donatyon. And what? were not the west
prouynces so much worth / that they might maintain and uphold the costs
and charges of the lyghtes: except that the resydue of the world did help
also? I pass over here / that thou say these things to be granted per /
largitatem that is to say of lyberalyte and bowntuousnes* than was it not done
for ye healyng of the leprie / so as they do say for else it were a strange
presu^ptio^ in hi^: who so ever would put or recke^ a remuncratio^ or
reco^pensation instead of lyberal or free gifts. Beato Siluestre / e^usque

wit / of chau^berlayns / porters / and watchemen: even so we will yt the holy
church of Rome be adourned. And yt the honor and worship of the pope may be
most bright / and most gloryously shine forth and appear: we have decreed /
that also the holy clerks of ye same holy church of Rome / shall ride upon
horses decked with napkyns and shetes / yt is to wit of most pure white color.
And as our senate wereth shoes with vdonibus.i. little mones / that is to say /
be adourned with white lynnen cloth / and so that heavenly things may be
likewise decked and adourned: as be the erthely things / to the laud and
praise of god.

O blessed Jesus / will thou not make answer from a whorlewide to this fellow:
which rolleth forth se^tences with barbarouse and folyssh words? Wylt thou not
thu^dre? wylt thou not cast forth lyghteni^ges / to revenge and punisshe so
great blasphemye? Doste thou suffer so great shame and abomination in thy
famylye or householde? Can thou here this? Can thou see this? And can
thou wi^ke at it / and suffer it unpunished so long? But thou art paciente and
full of mercy / But yet I do fear / lest this thy pacyence be rather wrath
and condemnation / as it was toward them / of whom thou saydest. Psalmo.

And I have let them alone / to do according to the desiers of their heart /
and they shall walk in their own inventions / and in another place. Roma. i.
I have given them into a reprobate sense or mind (...) they should do those
things / which are not conuenyent: because it did not like them to aknowledge
me. I beseech the / O lord bydde me cry out against them / and peradventure
they shall be converted. All other bishops take example of mischeuouse vices
at the pope of Rome /
O you popes of Rome which are the examples of all sins and myscheuouse vices

say you so? shall the gorgyouse garments / and apparyll of estate? shall the
pomp of cheualrye? and to make an end / shall all the manner living of the
emperor / be seem the vicare of Christ? what fellowship or agreement / or what
comparison or lykenes / is there between a priest / and Caesar? Did Siluester do
on such garments upon himself? went he in such apparyll / and with such
pomp and roialte? did he live at home / and did he reign with such celebrite
of servants? The ungracious men do not parceyue and understand / that

which was the highest or chief priest of god: tha^ of an hethen prince. But
we shall at another time more sore inuaye / and speak against these things /
and at this time / let us speak somewhat / with this false forger of lies:
of his barbarouse language / through whose folysshe speech: his most shameless
leasing waxes open and euydente / by the own accord / we deliver up (says
he) the palayce of our empier / called Laterane / As though he had done evil
/ to put the gifts of the palayce / here in this place among the ornaments:
he rehearsed the same again afterward where mention is made of gifts /
Moreover the diadem / and as though they did not see / but had been blind /
which were present: he declares it / sayyng / that is to wit ye crown
belongs to our heed but here he did not put to / of gold / but afterward
rehersyng the same things again: he says / of most pure gold and of
precyouse stones. The unlearned dastarde was ignoraunte / A diadem is of cloth
or else of sylke.
that a diadem is of clothe / or else paraduenture of sylke / wherefore that wise
sayyng of a certain king / is wont to be much spoken of / and praised /
which is said / when the dyademe was delivered unto him: to have hold it in
his hands / and to have considered and well aduysed it a long season / before
he would put it on his heed / and to have said / O noble: rather than
prosperouse and lucky clothe / which if a man knew parfyghtly with how many
cares / ieopardyes / and miseries / thou art replenysshed: he would not so
much as ones take the up / if thou layest on the ground. This fellow / weneth
it to be of naught else: than of gold / to the which / now a days the kings
do put to / a crown of gold with preciouse stones. But Constantine was not a
king / Constantyne was not a king neither did he wear any crown.
neither durst he have been bold to call him self a king / neither to
apparaill him self after the manner of kings / he was emperor or chief
captain of Rome / not king / where a king is: there is not a comune weal.
Imperator.
But in ye comune weal / there have been many emperors or captains / and that
even at one time / for Cicero writes ofte^tymes in this wife / M. Cicero
imperator / illi vel illi i^peratori salute^ that is to say in english /
Marcus Cicero captain sends gretyng to this or ye captain / all be it
afterward the prince or governor of the Romans / as being souerain of al:
had this name e^perator appropriated to him / so yt he as by a name peculiare /
and proprely belo^gyng to hi^ / was called e^perour. Simulque phrigiu^ / necnon
super humerale videlicet lorum / quod imperiale solet circu^dare collu^ / How
great barbarousnes is there i^ these words? Phrigiu^.
who ever hard this word Phrigiu^ used in ye latin tongue? will thou / wha^
thou spekest barbarously: yt I should think it to be ye speech of Co^sta^tine
or of Lacta^tius? Plautus in ye co^medye called Menechmi / Phrigio.
put this word phrigio for a shaper of garments / and Plinius calls
garments broiderde and wroughte with ye nedell. Phrigiones / because ye people
of Phrigia were ye first fynders out and deuisers of such garments. But what
this word phrigiu^ does signify / which is a dark word: thou do not
declare but this word superhumerale / which is a more plain word: thou do
expou^de and declare / saying. videlicet loru^ etc. and yet thou wottest not
what Lorum betokens for thou do not mean / yt a girdle / Lorum,
or lease made of leddre (which is called lorum) was put about Cesars neck for
an orname^t / and hereof it is / yt we do call ye raines and ledders of ye
bridles and horse harnais / and leddre tho^ges or scourges Lora in ye lati
tongue / and if in any place we do find these words Lora aurea: it can not be
understood but only of ye raynes or leddres of ye bridels or collers / which are wo^t to be put about ye gilded neck of an horse / or of some other be /
which thing / in mine opinion / begyled ye / and whiles thou will put Lorum
about ye neck of Caesar and Siluester: thou make of a man / of the emperor /
of ye pope: an horse / or an Ass / or a dog / Verum and chlamide^ purpurea^
atque tunica^ coccinea. Because Math. Math ^^ John^. 9.
says clamide^ coccinea^ / and John^ says / veste^ purpurea^ / spekyng both
of ye purple ma^till or vesture / which was don upon Christ / in mockcage and
scorn: this fellow thought yt he would here join the^ both together i^ one
place. But if purpurea and Coccinea do betoke^ both of the^ one color / as
they do i^ ye sayi^ges of ye eua^gelistes: why wast not thou co^te^t so as ye
eua^gelistes were co^te^t / to name the one of the^? except thou do
understand by purpurea a king (as unlearned men do speak now a days) of white
sylken cloth / But in very deed / what purpura betokens.
purpurea is a fysshe / with whose blood woll is dyed / and therefore of ye dying
ye cloth has his name and is called purple / whose color may be taken for
reed / though it be somewhat more i^clyni^g to black / and very nere to ye
color of cole and cluddred blood / and as it were a violete color / and
therefore i^ Homer and Vergile it is read / purpureus sa^guis and marmor
prophiricu^ / that is to say / purple blood / and purple or Read marble /
whose color is like to the Amethiste stone / for ye / which in the latin
tongue is called purpura: in ye greek is called porphyra / And what manner of
garmente Chlamys is: I durst swear / thou wottest not at al / But lest he
should bewraye him self to be a liar / if he should have spoken at large of
every partyculare grament: he co^prehendeth them all together in one word /
saying oi^a i^perialia indumenta / that is to say / all the imperial garments
/ what? even those also / wherein he was wo^t to be clad and apparailed in
battle / wherewith he was cladde in huntyng? in plays or open shows? and in
feasts or bankettes? what can be said more folysshely: than that all the
garments or apparaille of Caesar / is convenient or syttyng for the pope? But
how properly and pleasauntly is this added of him. Seu etiam dignitatem
imperialiu^ presidentiu^ equitum / that is to say or the dignite of the
imperial presydente knights / he says or he would depart these two things
/ the one from the other: as though there were great similytude or lykenes
between them / and he falls down from speaking of the imperial habyte or
apparayll: to the dignite of knights / speaking I wot not what he would feign
express certain meruaylouse things: but he is afraid to be perceived and
taken with a lie / and therefore with puffed and swollen chekes / and with a
bowlne throat: he gives a sound without wit / and speaks without any
reason or wisdom / no man can tell what Confere^tes etiam ei imperialia
sceptra / that is to say / Geuyng to him also the imperial scepters / what a
manner spekyng is this? what elegancie? or what order is herein? which be those
imperial sceptres? There is but one scepter and not many (if it were so / yt
the emperor did bear any scepter at all) Shall the pope also bear the
scepter in his ha^ne? why shall we not tha^ also give hi^ a sword? an helmete /
and a darte? Simulque cu^cta signa et ba^na / what meanest thou here by signa?
Signa.
signa betokens either carved images (and so we read ofte^tymes these words
signa and tabulas / for carved images and pictures / for in old time they did
not pai^t upon ye walls: but i^ tables) or else signa betokens sta^derdes or
ba^ners (of signu^ i^ the former (...) which betokens a (...) image. Did God
ariue tha^ gui^e to Sinister his (...) images: (...) his banners the two Egles?
Wha^ is more against reason ^han this (...) what this word Ba^^a does
sygnyfye. I can not find / nor imagyne. Banna
God gy^^ the a mischefe most leude wretch: which make the^ speaking
barbarouse / which were ^t the learned world ^^^yme. Et diuersa orname^ta
imperialia* Because he had said Ba^na: he thought he had given knowledge enough
/ and therefore he concluded and contained al other under this universal or
general word. And how oftentimes reherceth he again this word emperyall? as
who should say / that there were certain ornaments properly belonging to the
emperor: more than were belonging to a Consule / to a dictator to Caesar. Et
oe^m procession^ imperialis culminis et gliam potestatis nr^e. He casts forth
proud and gloryouse words: being as it were Darius king o^ kings / and cosyn
to ye gods / and never speaks / but in the plurell no^bre. But what
processyon or sole^pne going forth is this of the^peryal cucu^bre? Supposest
thou yt Caesar did tryu^phe as often as he wen^ forth of his house: as the pope /
these days is wont to do / having white horses going before him / which
horses being trapped and decked / the servants do join and couple together
to the charyotte? tha^ which thing (though I speak not of other peuisshe and
mad things) there can be none more vain or p^su^tuouse / neither more
unseemly or vnsytti^g for the pope of Rome / which is this Glory also / that
thou speak of? would he being a latin man / have called yt po^pe and
sole^pnite of ordinance / glory: after ye manner and usage of ye Hebrew tongue
/ as yt also militiu^ for ^^lites: which manner of speki^g we have borrowed of ye
Hebrews: whose books Co^sta^tine or his scribes had never red. But moreover /
how great is your lyberalite and bou^tuousnes / o Caesar / which do not think it
suffycie^t to have adourned ye pope himself: unless you did also adourne ye
hole clergy? Thou call it ye high top of power and preexcelle^cie: to be
made Patrici^s or Consules. Who herd ^uer / that (...) not (...) or other men
were made Patricus? (...) may be made Co^sules: but not Patrici^^ men (I say)
either of the senator^^ kyndred (which is called Darius patriciae or senatoria
/ because ye senators were called Pa^res conscrip^^) or of the house or
kyndred of the^ equest^^ order / or of the common rascal sone. And it is a
gretter thing to be a senator: than to be Patricius. For a senator is one of
the chosen counsayloures of the common weal / Patricius
but Patricius is he which descends by lynage of the senatorie house or
stock. So that he which is a senator or one of the fathers is not forthwith
Patricius / that is to say / borne of the senator stock. But thou wylt
peradventure say / that there is mention made of ye dignite / which is called
Dignitas patriciatus: in many books. I do not say nay / that such mention is
made / but it is in them / which speaks of ye times after Co^sta^tine. It
follows therefore / yt this pu^lege was made after Co^sta^tines time. But what
may ye clerks be made co^sules? Clerks of Italy has forbydde^ themselves
marriage of wives / and shall they be made consules? And shall they cause
soldyers to muster? and shall they go in to ye proui^ces / whereof they be made
rulers: with legyo^s / and the hosts of ye fre^des and fellows of ye Romans?
Shall ye ministers and servants be made consuls? or shall they wear ye
orname^tes of me^ of war? and shall not payers or couples of consules be made
/ as ye old usage and custom was: but shall hole hu^dredes and thou sa^des of
ministers / which shall serve ye church of Rome have ye dignite e^periall? The
ministers / shall be emperors / and the clerks / shall be soldyers. Shall the
clerks be made soldyers? or shall they wear yt or name^tes of a soldyer?
except thou doste give to all clerks universally ye e^periall orname^tes. For
I wot no whit / what thou do mean. And who does not see an perceive that
this lyeng fable has been imagined and devised / by them which would
themselves to have lyberte for to wear all manner garments / of what so ever
fashyon them selves list / so that if any kinds of plays or merry pastymes be
exercysed among the wicked spirits which inhabit the air: I do judge they
are most exercysed and most delyted / in counterfayting and expressyng / as it
were in a stage play / the appayrell / the pride and the super fluite used of
clerks. Whether should I more rebuke and inuae against / the folysshenes of
the sentences (which you have herd already) or else the folisshnes of his
words? as for example / when he says. Senatum videri adornari? that the
senate seems to be adourned / as who should say doutles / that it is not
adourned in very deed / and that to be adourned with glory / and when he says
that thing to have been done: which is but in doing / as Promulganimus for
promulgamus: We have publisshed or pronounced openly / for we do publysshe or
pronounce openly. For in deed so the oration or speech sowndeth more
plesaunlty. and when he expre^seth one and the same thing both by the present
/ and also by the preterperryte tence: as Decernimus and decreuimus: we do
decree / and we have decreed. And that all is full of these words Decernimus /
decoramus / imperialis / imperatoria / potentia / gloria. And that he abuses
this verb Ex^at / putting it for this verb est (where as Extate sygnifyeth
as much as supereminere or superesse: to stand up / or to remain and be
left) and Nempe for Silicer. And Concubitores for contubernales. He adds
also and joins to him certain / with whom he should sleep (as I wene) lest
he might fear phantasmes or apparityons and syghtes in the night / he adds
to him chaumberlayns / he adds porters. It is not for naught: An ironie
wherefore he reherceth these small things / he instructs and teaches a
young ward / or else his son being a young man: and not an old man / for
whom / he / as a very loving father / prepaireth all things: where of his
young and tender age has need: as David did for Solomon. And that this lye^g
tale should be perfect / and lackyng in no point. He gives horses to the
clerks / lest they might else sit upon asses backs aft ye folisshe manner of
Christ. Mat xxi. To follow Christ in pouertye and humblenes: is accounted
folishenes of the clergy / now a days.
And those horses / which are given / are not operti sieve instrati operimentis
coloris albi: but decorati color albo. That is to say not covered with
couerynges or clothes of white color: but beutifyed and adourned with white
color. And with what couerynges or clothes? not with couerlettes or arayes
clothes / nor with one other kind of clothes: but only / mappulis and
lintheaminibus. Mappae / that is to say / bordeclothes: belong to a table.
Lintheamina / that is to say shetes belong to beds. And as if it were doubt
/ of what color table clothes / napkyns / and shetes were: He declares it /
saying. id est candidissimo color. that is to wit / of very white color.
Is not this semely speech for Constantine? Is not this eloquence worthy and
mete for Lactance? both in other things: but specially in this sayng / Equos
equite^t? And not withstandyng / that he has spoken nothing of the apparyll
of senators / neither of their garment called Latus clauus / neither of purple
/ neither of other garments appertaynyng to them: yet he thought it necessary
/ to speak of their shows. And he did not call them Lunulas: but Vdones or
cum vdonibus / which / the folysshe fellow / as he is wont to do / expowneth
/ saying: Id est candido lintheamine: as though Vdones were but lynnen cloth.
It comes not to my remenbraunce at this time / where ever I have red this
word Vdones: but only in Valerius Martialis / Vdones.
in whom there are two verses / whose title is. Vdones cilicini: as you would
say sockes of here. The verses are these. Non hos lana dedit / sed olentis
barba mariti
Cymphio poterit planta latere sinu.
Whose sentence in Englisshe may be this. The stuff whereof these are made: is
not wolle / but the here of the stynking gottes bearde / so that now thou
may hyde thy foot in a shoe or socke of gotes here. Vdones / there fore are
not of lynnen / neither ar not white / wherewith this two foted ass does say /
not that ye fete of the senators ar shoed: but that the senators are
illustrated. Atque per hoc ita caelestia sicut terrestria ad laudem dei
decorentur. And by this mean that the heavenly things may be decked and
adourned / even so as the erthely things be: to ye laud or praise of god.
Which call thou heavenly things? which erthely things? how or in what
manner are the heavenly things beutifyed or adourned? And what praise this
should be to god: auyse the / The secularyte of the clergy / is odible both
to god and man.
for I truly (if there be any faith or truth in me) do suppose nothing to be
more hateful neither to god / neither to other men / than so outragiouse
liberte of clerks in seculare things. But why do I in this wise make assault
against every particulare saying? The time will fail me / if I would / I do
not say amplyfie all things: but only touch them. Prae oibus autem
licentiam tribuimus beato Siluestro et successoribus eius / ex nostro in dictu
/ vt quem placatus proprio consilio cleri care voluerit / and in religioso
numero religiosorum clericorum co^numerare: nullus er omnibus praesumat superbe
agere. Above all we give license to blessed Siluester / and to his successors
/ by our commandment / that if it shall like and please him to make any manner
man a clerk / and to reckon or account him in the religiouse nombre of
religiouse clerks: that no man of al men what soever he be / do presume to do
proudly. What Melchisedech is this here / Gene. 14,
which blesses the Patriarche Abraham? Does Constantyne being yet scasely a
Christen man / give license and power of making clerks / to him: of whom he
was baptized / and whom he calls blessed? As though Siluester never had made
/ neither could have made any clerks before? And with what communication or
thretenyng did he forbydde / that no man should let him / or be an impedimente
to him? saying. Nullus ex omnibus presumat superbe agere: Let none of all men
presume to do proudely? And with how great elegancie also? saying. Co^numerare
in numero religioso religiosorum / et clericare clericorum / and in dictu / and
placatus? And than he retourneth again to speak of ye diadem. Decreuimus
itaque and hoc / vt ipse et successores eius diademate / videlicet corona /
qua^ ex capite nostro illi concesserimus ex auro purissimo et ge^mis preciosis:
vti debeant pro honor beati Petri. We have decreed this also / that he / and
his successors / ought to wear the diadem / that is to wit the crown /
which we have given to him from our own heed / being of most pure gold and
preciouse gemmes or stones / for the honor of saint Peter. Here again he
does interpret and declare the word Diadema: because he did speak to
barbarouse and forgteful persons. And here he adds also / Of most pure gold:
lest peradventure a man would suppose / that some coppre or brass / or else
some corruption or dross and fylth were mengled among it. And wha^ he had
said / gemmas which was suffycient: he added Preciosas / fearyng likewise /
lest a man would else peradventure have demed them to have been of small value
and little worth. But why did he not say Preciosisstmas / that is to say most
precyouse: likewise as he had said / Aurum purissimu^ / gold most pure? For
there is more difference in value / between one gemme or precyouse stone / and
another: than is between one gold / and another. And where he ought to have
said Distinctum gemmis.i. garnisshed or besette with preciouse stones: he said
that it was ex ge^mis.i. of preciouse stones. Who does not see and perceive
that this manner of speaking was taken of that place in the psalms (which the
hethen prince had never read) Posuisti in capite eius corona^ de lapide
precioso.i. Psalm. 20.
thou have put on his heed a crown of precyouse stone? Did Caesar speak in
such manner wise / through a certain vaynegloriouse desyer to brag and bost
of his crown (if it be so / that Caesar were crowned) being co^tumelyouse and
rebukefull to his own self / in that he did fear / lest men would have
supposed and thought hi^ not to have worn a crown of most pure gold and
precyouse stones: except he had given them knowledge thereof / and told it them
by his own words. But harken now the cause why he speaks so. For the
honor of blessed Peter / as who should say / that Christ were not ye chief
corner stone / upon which the temple of the church is builded: but Peter /
which thing he does also again afterward. But if he was desyrouse to
worship Peter so greatly: why did he not dedycate the episcopale temple at
Rome to him: rather than to saint John^ Baptiste? Moreover / does not the very
barbarousenes of the manner of speaking / wytnes openly: that this caroll has been feigned not in the time of Constantyne / but in a time more late? when he
says / Decreuimus quod vti debeant.i, we have decreed / that they ought to
wear: where he should have said Decreuimus vt vta^tur.i. we have decreed that
they may wear? Even so speak barbarouse laws now a days / and thus they
write / Iussi quod deberes venire: where they should say / Iussi vt venires. And
he says here Decreuimus et co^cessimus: we have decreed and we have granted /
as though these things were not than in doing: but had been done at some other
time. Ipse vero beatus papa super corona^ clericatus / qua^ gerit ad gloria^
beatissimi Petri: ipsa ex auro non est passus un corona. But ye blessed pope
himself / did not suffer to wear ye crown of gold / upon the crown of his
clarkeshippe / which he bears to the glory and honor of most blessed Peter.
O ye singular and excedyng folishenes of you. O Constantine / you said but
even now / yt the crown upon ye popes heed: did make for the honor of saint
Peter / and now you say / yt it makes nothing at all for his honor: saying ye
Siluester refuses it. And natwithsta^ding yt you do praise his so doi^g: yet
for all yt you do bid hi^ / and will hi^ to wear ye crown of gold. And ye
thing / which himself thi^keth yt he ought not to do: ye same thing / you
say / that his successors ought to do / I pass over here / yt thou call ye
shaue^ crown of his heed / corona^: which is wo^t to be called rasura / and
that thou call the bishop of Rome. papa^ / that is to say pope: which was
not yet at that time begonnen to be so called. Phrigiu^ vero condidissimo
nitore sple^didu^ dn^i resurrectione^ designantes / eius sacratisiimo vertici
manibbus nr^is imposuimus / et tene^tes frenu^ equi / pro reuere^tia beati
Petri apli / dextratoris officiu^ illi exhibuimus / statue^tes eode^
phrigiooe^s eius successores sigulariter vti in processionibus / ad imperu
nostri imitatione^. And this coyfe / which by ye brightness of the most white
color represe^teth ye resurrection of our lord: we have put with our hands /
upon his most holy heed / and holding ye bridell of his horse / for ye
reverence of blessed Peter the apostle: we have done to him ye office and duty
of a fotema^. decrei^g and ordayni^g: yt al his successors shall wear ye same
coyfe or call / in ye processio^s / to ye imitatio^ and folowi^g of our e^pier.
Does not ye author and fader of this fable / seem / not through lack of taking
head / and unware: but even of set purpose / and for the nonce / to play ye
false harlotte / and to give men occation on eueri side / to rebuke him? He
says here / in this one and the same place that by ye white coyfe is both the
resurrection of our lord represe^ted: and also that in ye same is the
imitatio^ and cou^terfayti^g of ye empier of Caesar. which two things are most
diverse and dysagrei^g / ye one from the other I take god to record / I can
not find out or deuyse / with what words / or with what greuousenesse or
haynousnesse of words / I might rebuke / and as it were wound this most
vngratiouse and wretched knave. he does so parbreke forth all words full of
madness. He does make Co^sta^tyne / not only in office like to Moses. Leuiticis
Exodi. 28
Which by ye co^mau^deme^te of god did aparyll and adourne the highest and
chief priest Aaron: but also he does make hi^ expou^ding and declari^g secret
mysteries / which is a very herd thing to be done even of the^ also which
have studied / and ben occupied long season in the holy scriptures. Why dydest
thou not also make Co^sta^tine ye greattest and the highest bisshoppe / as many
e^perours have be^ in ye old time: yt by so much his orname^tes might the
better / and more esely and conuenie^tly be translated to the other high
bishop the pope? But thou wast ignora^te and vnskylled in ye histories of
antiquite. I do therefore give thanks to god for this cause / that he has not
suffered so wicked and so malytiouse a mind to be in any man: save only in the
being a stark fool without lernyng / which appears also evidently / by that
which follows. For he brings in Moses doing ye office and duty of a
foteman unto Aaron sittyng on horse back / and yt not through the mids of
the children of Israel: but through ye mids of ye Chananies / and of the
Egiptians / that is to say / through the cite of infideles / where was not so
much the empier of the world: as was the empier of deuylles / and of people
worshyppynge deuilles or wicked spirits. Vnde vt pontificalis apex no^

reherce and reken up even proui^ces also? Thou namest only the occidentall or

the eest of the North / and of the South marked forth or set / and as
certain, as be the bounds or meres of Asie / Affrike and Europe. Thou leauest
out the words that were necessary / which were nothing nedeful. Thou said
prouynces / places / and cities. Are not both proui^ces and cities: places? And
when thou had said provinces: thou put after / cities / as who would
say / that cities were not comprehended and understood under this word
provinces. But it is no maruayll of hi^ which does alyenate and give from
himself so great a part of the world: if the same does ouerhippe the names
of the cities and provinces / and as it were one oppressed with the disease

chosen that place pri^cipally before other / to build thy cite in? For that
thou do remove and flyt in to another place / after that thou had
delivered up Rome out of thy hands: it is not so much convenient and mete (so
as thou call it) as it is necessary or nedfull. Neither do thou call thyself
an emperor: seeing that thou have lost Rome / and have done very much hurt
unto ye name of the Romayne e^pier / which thou tearest in sondre and pullest
in pieces. Neither do thou call thy self a king / saying / et nostra^ regia^

abusio^ to the words of Gamaliel in the.v. chap. of the acts.
If that which you do be of god: it can not be dyssolued or fordone. But if it
be not of god: your work or deed shall now stand. But I se and perceive
right well you did coueyte to cou^terfeyte ye words of the apocalipse / where
it is said. I testify to him that hereth all the words of ye prophecy of

shall minissh any thing of ye words of the prophecy of this book / god shall
take away his perte out of ye book of life / and out of ye holy cite. But you
never red ye Apocalipse / wherefore these were not your words. Si quis aute^

neither what he speaks: neither how he speaks / but which being fat and
well fed / in the mids of his surfettyng / and in the great heat of wine /
belcheth forth such sentences / and such words / as these are / which light

pagines or sides. O thing / which never was herd: and which is vnbeleueable
/ wha^ I was a very young man / I remember / that I demanded of a certain
person / who had written the book of Job / The book or history of Job / was
not written by Job hi^ self.
and when he had made answer / that Job him self had written it: than I
said to him again. How could he than make mention of his own death? which
thing may be said also of many other books: whereof to speak / here is no
convenient place / for how can ye thing be truly told of any man: which
thing is not yet done? or how can ye thing be contained with in ye writ:
which thing (as he him self confesses was done after ye burial (if I may so
say) of ye writ? This is none other thing / but to say / yt the pagine of ye
privilege was dead / ye / and buried before yt it was borne / and yet that it
did never return after his death and burial / namely seeing that it was
roborated and strengthed before that it was written / and that not with one
hand but with both the hands of Caesar. And what meanest thou / when thou
say roboratyng and strengthyng? was it strengthed with the hand wryttynge of
Caesar himself: or else was it sealed with his signet? This was a great
strengthyng doutles / and much greatter: than if he had graven it in tables
of brass. An Ironi
But yet neded it not to write them in brass: seeing that the paper was laid
upon the body of blessed Peter / why spekest thou here no word of Paul /
which lies buried with Peter / and they both togeder might better and more
safely keep it: than the body of the one of them alone? you see here the
crafts and malycious subteltie of this our most wicked and gylefull Synon.
Because the donation of Constantyne can not be euydently proved: therefore he
said / that the privilege is not written in tables of brass / but of paper /
and it lies buried and hid with the body of the most blessed Apostle: that
we should not be bold either to search it in ye worshypfull sepulcher or grave
/ or else if we would search it: that we should think it to be rotten and
consumed. But where was than the body of blessed Peter? Doutles not in the
temple or church where it is now / nor in no strong or safe place / it
follows therefore / that Caesar would not have laid the writ or pagine in
that place / where the body was. Durst he not put Siluester in trust with the
pagine? was Siluester so unholy? was he so folyshe? was he so neglyge^t and
rechelesse? O Peter / O Siluester / O you bysshoppes of the holy church of Rome
/ to whom ye cure and charge of the lords sheep is committed: why do you not
keep safe the pagine which was committed and betaken to you? why have you
suffered it to be gnawen and eaten of worms? and to consume and rotte away for
age? I suppose it is / because your own bodies also have rotted and have been
consumed. Than did Constantyne folyshely to lay it with your bodies. Lo / now
that the pagine is resolved and brought in to powder or duste: the right or
title of the privilege is also turned into dust and brought to naught, But yet
you will say / that there remains a copy of the same pagyne / as we do see.
Who tha^ was he: which was so presumptuouse and folissh hardy / to take this
pagyne from the bosom of the most holy apostle? Doutles you ought to bring
forth or name some of the old authors / and such one as was alive in
Consta^tynes time. But you can not bring forth or name any such writer. But
peradventure you will bryngforth some man that wrote of late time. Where had he
this knowledge? For who so ever makes any history of things done before his
time / either he speaks as the holy ghost endyteth to him / and puts into
his mind: or else he follows the authorite of the old authors / and that of
such as wrote of things done in their own time. Wherefore who so ever does
not follow the old authors / he shall be of the nombre of them whom very
au^cientnesse and antiqtie makes hardy and bold to make seasynges. And if in
any place this thing be reed / it does accord and agree with antiquite / even
as much as that peuysshe and mad narration of Accursius the gloss maker /
Accurs^us.
which he tells of ambassadors sent from Rome to Grecelande for to receive
the laws / does accord with Titus Liuius / and other most exellent authors of
the old time. Datum Romae tertio calendas Aprilis Constantino Augusto quareo
consule / it Gallicano quarto consule.1. Given at Rome the.xxx. day of March /
Constantine Augustus being than the fourth time consul / and Gallicanus also
being than ye fourth time consul. He has dated the pagyne / on the last day
of March save one: that we should suppose it to have been done / about the
time of those Easter holy days / which are wont co^munely to fall about that
time. Et Consta^tino quartum consule / and Gallicano quartum consule. And
Constantine being tha^ the fourth time consul / and Gallicanus also being than
ye fourth time consul. It is a meruaylouse thing if both Consta^tyne and
Gallicanus had been either of them thryse consul before that time: that than at
the fourth time they should both be chosen fellows together in that office. But
it is a gretter marvel / and more to be wondered at / that the emperor
Augustus being full of the leprie / called Elephantia (because it passes other
dyseases: as the elephant does other beasts) would take that high dignyte
and office of a consul upon him / 4 Reg 13.
seeing that Azarias / as soon as he was touched with the leprie: kept himself
secret within the house / co^mittyng the ordring and governance of his realm
/ to his son Ionathas / as for the most part / Josephus. libro nono cha. 11.
all leprouse kings were wont to do. By which argument alone / all the hole
priuylege is utterly confuted / proved false / and overthrown. And that no man
may dout / but that it must needs be / that he was infected with leprie / before
that he was made consul: let him understand and know this (which thing
phisycions do witness) that this sickness or disease grows and increases
preuely / by little and little. And again let him understand and know this
also (which appears euyde^tly by old histories) that they were wont to enter
in to the office of the consul / in the month of January / and that it was
in office lastyng but one year. And these things are said to have been done at
the March next after. And here also I can not ouerhippe this / that in epistels
is wont to be written: Datu^. etc. but not in other writings / except it be
of such as have no lernyng / for epistels or letters are said to be given: and
therefore we say / Do tibi epistola^.
Do tibi epistolam / or Do ad te epistolam (Do tibi epistolam is asmoche to
say / as I give a letter to you / as to a carier for to deliver it in to his
hands / to whom it is written or send. Do ad te epistola^ / is as much to say
/ Do ad te epistola^.
as I write or send a letter to you. But this privilege (as they call it) of
Consta^tyne / which ought not to be delivered to any man / ought also not to
have been said to be given / so that it may appear evidently / that he which
spoke thus did lie falsely / and yet had no wit or co^nyng to feign craftily
such things / as it might be lykely to be true / that Constantyne either
said or did. And all they make themselves pertayners and cosyns to him in
folisshnesse and madness: who so ever do think and defend it / that this
fellow has said true things: albeit that they have nothing / whereby they may
/ I do not say defend: but honestly excuse their opinion. Is this an honest
excuse of error / when thou see the troth manifestly and openly showed /
not to be willing to agree unto it / because certain great and excellent men
have been of the contrary opinyon to the truth (I mean great men of dignyte:
and neither of wisdom / neither of virtue) But yet whereby know thou /
whether they / whom thou folowest / if they had herd the same things so
plainly declared / which thou do here: would co^tynus and abide still in
their opinion or else would go from it and forsake it? And yet never the less
it is a great shame / and an exceeding great offense / to regard a man more /
It is an excedyng shame / to give more crede^ce to any man: than we do give to
the troth self.
and to give to him more credence: than we do regard the truth / and give
credence to it / that is to wit / to god. For verily certain men being
destytute of all reasons or arguments: are wont to answer in this wise. why
have so many popes believed this donation to be true? I testefye to you / you do
provoke me to that / which I am evil willing and loath to do / and you do
compel me against my will / to speak evil of the popes: whom I had lever /
if I might: to hyde and cover in their offenses and trespasses. But let us
proceed and hold on to speak boldly / in as much as this cause can not
otherwise be pleaded. Though I do grant that the popes did verily so believe /
and that they did it not of a crafty and malicious purpose. What marueyle is it
if they did believe these things / wherein so great lucre and advantage is
pleasant and lykyng to the^ / Popes folyshe / and ignoraunte.
seeing that through exceeding folysshnesse and lack of knowledge / they do
believe many things / wherein no luc^s at all is showed? Do we not at Ara Celi /
in so exellent a temple in the most worshipful and holy place / see a painted
table of Sybill and Octauian / as they say / by the auctorite and commandment
of Innocentius the third / writing these words? Which also left in writing
of the decay and ruin or fall of the temple of Peace / about the time of the
birth of the savior / yt is to say / wha^ the virgin brought forth child.

Which things appertain more to the distructyon of faith / for that they are
false and untrue / than to the establysshing of it / because they are marvelous
and wonderful things. Dare the vicar of truth / for the apperau^ce of troth
and godliness / behold to make lies / and wyttyngly to bind him self to so
great sin. why / Does he not lie? Ye moreover / does he not se when he does
this / that he disagreeth and varieth from most holy men? I pass over other.
Does not saint Jerome use the testimony and witness of Varro / that there were
ten Sibels / which work Varro made before Augustus his time. Jerome.
And the same Jerome writes in this wise of the temple of Peace. Vespasianus
and Titus / after that the temple of Peace was edifyed and builded at Rome /
they did consecrate the vessels of the temple / and all the gifts and offri^ges
in the temple of the same place / which things the Greek and the Romayne

crede^ce should be given to his peuissh little book / and the same also
barbarously written: than to the most faithful and true histories of the most
wise men / that wrote in ye old time. Because I have made mention somewhat of
Ieronimy: I can not suffer this co^tumely done to him / to be passed over with
syle^ce. At Rome / A book of the bible is kept and showed for a relic at rome

thou ask / by what euyde^t toke^ they know that. Because there is (as Vergil
says) Multu^ picta^ vestis et auri^i. Much of painted garments and of gold.
And the very thing self shows rather / that it was not written with saint
Ieroms own hand. Wha^ I had looked somewhat more dilyge^tly in this book: I
found / that it was written by the commandment of a ki^ge (Robert / as I
wene) with ye hand of of an unlearned man / much like hereunto is it (albeit
there are a thousand such manner things at Rome) that among the holy relykes
there / is showed in a certain table / yt image or portrature of Peter and
Paul which Syluester showed to Consta^tyne / after that he had been monysshed
and taught of the same Apostels in his sleep / for the co^fyrmation of the
visyon that he had seen. I do not say this because I do deny yt those images or
purtatures be the true images and pictures of the aforenamed apostles (and
would god / that the epistle / which was sent urthe name of Lentulus / The
epistle of Lentidus / concerning the image of christ: is a false forged thing.

/ that Siluester did never show that table to Constantine / In which thing I

Siluester. And because both al our questyo^ depends hereof / and also seeing
that I do speak to the popes of Rome / it shall be most semely and according

I will touch that only of the dragon / to thentent that I may euydently
cause you to know / that Constantine was not full of leprie (For the acts of
Siluester or the history of hi^: as the interpretour witnesses) was made by
one Eusebius a certain man of Grecelande / which nation has always be

What so ever thing the lyeng Greeks dare be bold to do / in writi^g of
histories. From whence did that dragon come? Dragons are not gendred at Rome.
The histories of the Greeks ar corrupted with lies
Which also had that dragon his poison? Pestiferouse and venemouse dragons are
said to be only in Affrike / by the reason of the excedyng and outragiouse
heat of ye region. Besides this / whence could he have so much habundance
and plenty of venom and poison / that he might enfecte and corrupt with
pestylence / so large a city / namely seeing that him self lay down in so
deep a den or dongion / that men went down in to it / by an hundred and
fyftie steps or stayres? Serpe^tes ar noisome not with their brethe: but with
their bitynge: only the cocodrice except.
Serpents (only the Basilyske or Cocodrise excepted) do poison and kill men /
not with their breath: but with their biting. Neither Cato / when he fled from
Caesar with so great an host of men / whiles he iornayed through the mids of
Aphricke sondes / and slepte there: saw any of his company killed or destroyed
with the venemouse breathing of any serpents. Cato.
Neither the peoples of that country do feel any corruption or infection of
the air through that cause. And if we do give any credence to poets fables:
both Chimera the monstre / and Hydra / and Cerberus the mastyffe of hell /
were seen and touched co^munely / without any harm or hurt taken thereby.
Again / why would not the Romans rather have killed him? Thou will
peradventure say / because they were not able. But yet Regulus slew a much
gretter serpente in Affrike / Marcus Tilius Regulus.
at the bank of the river Bragadra. And it was no mastry to have killed this
dragon: if they had done no more / but only have closed or stopped up the
mouth of the cave or den. What? would they not do so? I suppose they did
worship hi^ for a god / even so as the Babylonians did worship another
dragon. Dan^. 14.
Why than would natre Syluester rather have slain this dragon: so as it is
said / that Daniell did in the old time? Why would he not have bound him with
an hempen threde? and have destroyed ye house for ever? But the forger of this
tale / would not that the dragon should be killed: lest men might plainly deem

that narration / as being naught else but alyeng fable: shall not I dysalowe and
dampne this tale / which was counterfayted and made to the lykenes of that
fable? seeing that it can not be strengthed and vpholden by the authorite of any
author / and / again does far pass the other tale / to whose likeness it
was shapen / in folisshnes? For who had builded an house under the grownde for
ye beast? who had put that beast in that house? and had commanded him that he
should not come forth and fly away? For dragons do fly / as certain men
said / though other men do say nay) who had devised and ymagined that kind
of meat? Who had commanded women and those virgins and nonnes to go down
into that den: and that never but on the first day of the month? Did the
dragon know which was the first day of the month? and was he contented with
so scace and syldome meat? Nor did the Virgins dread so deep a dongyon? so
great / so cruel / and so hungry a beast? I suppose the dragon fawned on them:
because they were women / An irony
because they were virgins / and because they brought him meat. ye / and I
suppose also / that he did commune and talk with them. And why should he not
also (saving your reverence) have to do and gendre with them. For both
Alexandre and also Scipio / Read plutarche in the lives of Alexdre and Scipio
are said to have been begoten by a serpent or dragon / that lay with their
mothers. What say you moreover / after that his wont meat or food was denied
him / would he not rather have come forth and ben slain.

O the marvelous madness of men / which do give credence to such old
dotynge wives tales. But moreover how long time has this thing ben done?
When was it begone? Before the coming of our Sauyoure. After the coming of
him. None of all these things is known. Let us be aschamed of such triflyng
tales / and of our lyghtnesse. Let a christen man be a shamed / which names
him self ye son of light and of troth: to utter or speak forth any such

was a cave / which had be^ there of long co^tynua^ce before yt time / and not
that ye ground did tha^ suddenly open and gape / and that it was there / before
ye Rome was builded / and that it was called Curtius Lacus: because ye Curtius

that Juno made none answer: but only did make a beck or lygne with her heed
/ that she was contented and wylli^g to remove from thence / to Ro^e.
Afterward this was put to the tale: that she did speak also. And concerning
the beck or sign made with her heed: it is euyde^t / that they did lie /

was written of Cornelyus (to whom he joins Lacta^tius fellow and witness)
which says / that it was named of / Curtius ye consul / to whom Marcus
Genutius was fellow in office. And verily I will not dissemble / that Valerius
Maximus can not be vttly rebuked / though he does speak so / seeing that a
little afterward he writes these words following wisely and discretely.
Libro primo chap. xcviii.
I am not ignorant / how doutfull the opinyon is / of ye mouyng and of the
voice and spech of the gods immortal / which is parceyued by the sight and
hearing of men. But because no new things are said of us / but only things
written in times past / are rehearsed again of us. Let the authors challenge
credence to themselves. He made mention here of the voice or spech of the
gods / because of Juno Moneta / and because of ye image of the gods Fortune
/ which they do feign to have spoken twice by these words. Rite me matronae
vidistis. Rite dedicastis. 1. In dew form and manner / you matrones have seen
me. In dew form and manner / you have dedicated me. But our forgers of fables
do bring in eueriwhere ydols or images / spekyng / which thing the very paynems
and worshippers of ydols do not say / but more syncerely and faithfully do deny
it / than the christen men do affirm it. Among them / those very few
miracles that are / leave not unto the faith and credence of the authors / but
as it were to a certain sacred and relygious commendation of ancient
antiquite. But among our tale forgers / certain marueyles of later time are
told / which the men of those days never knew. *. Neither do I derogate or
minysshe the admyration and honor of saints / neither do I deny the divine
and godly works wrought by them / for asmoche as I do know / that as much
faith as is the qua^tite of a mustarde seed / may translate mountayns from
one place to another. ye / Luke. 17.
moreover I do defend and maynteyne their said works: but I ca^ not suffer
that they be mengled with fables and lies. Neither can I be brought in to other
belefe / than that these writers either were infydeles and miscreantes / which
did it to mock christen men / if these feigned lies brought by gylefull fellows
in to the hands of unlearned men / should be taken for true histories: or else

having in deed a zele unto god: but not according to knowledge (as Paul
says) which have not ben afraid to write / not only of the acts of saints:
but also of ye acts of ye Virgin gods mother / ye and more over of the
acts of Christ / certain shamles and false gospels. And ye pope calls these
books Apochriphos libros / that is to wit / books whose author is not known /
as who should say / yt it were no fault at all: that the author of them is not
known / and that the things were beleuable / which are told and reherced in
the^ / and all though they were holy things / and appertaynyng to the
confirmation and fortifyeng of our religion and faith / so that now there is no
less fault in him / which has approved and allowed these evil things: than
is in him / which did first imagyne and devise them. We do discern / we do
disseuer the evil money from the good / and we do refuse it / and cast it from
us. And shall we not discern the reprobate and false doctrine: but shall we
retain and keep it still? but shall we mengle it with good doctrine? but shall
we defend it for good doctrine? I verily will give my sentence or judgment
freely and boldly. I deny that the history of Siluester is Apocrophe (yt is to
wit / whose author is not known) (for as I said before / It is sayd^ that
Eusebius a Geccian is the auctor of saint Siluesters life.
a certain man called Eusebius / is said to be the author thereof) but I say
plainly / that it is a false history / and not worthy to be read / both in
other things: and specially in those narratio^s of the dragon / of the bull /
Constantyne was never meseld: so as they do feign
and of the leprie of Constantyne / for the reprouyng of which leprie / I have
reherced these so many things. For all be it Naaman was a leprouse person: it
follows not therefore forthwith / that Co^stantyne also was full of l^prie.
Many authors have made mention of Naaman / but of Constantine / which was
prince and governor of the world: no man has written / not so much as any
of his own cytizens / but only I wot not what peuysshe fellow of a strange
country / to whom no more credence is to be given than is to a another certain
fellow / which wrote of the waspes / that made their nestes in Vespasianus
nose / The tale of the waspes in vespasianes nose / and of the forgge whereof
Nero was delivered: ar falls forged* tales
and of the frogge / of which Nero was delivered / as it had been of child /
whereof they say / that the place is called Laterane / quod rana ibi late at
insepulchro.1. because the frogge is hid there in the grave / which thing I
am sure / neither the waspes / neither ye frogs selves would have said: if
they could have spoken / except they do refer this to the gods of the
eanytoly house / as if they would say / that these gods had been wont to
speak / and had commanded this thing to be done. But why should I marvel
that the popes are ignoraunte / The excedi^g ignorance of the popes
and have no perceiving or understanding in these things: when they be
ignoraunte of their own name? For they say that Peter was called Cephas /
Cephas.
because he was heed of ye Apostles / as who should say: that this word Cephas
were a Greek word coming of Cephali (which in the Greek tongue be tokeneth ye
same that Caput does in latyne / or heed in Englisshe) and not a word of the
Hebrew / or rather of the Sirie tongue / which the Greeks do write Ciphys /
which among them is interpreted Petrus / and not caput. For both Petrus and
Petra are Greek words / and they do folysshely which do expound and declare
this word Petra by a latyne etimologie / saying Petra quasi pede trita. And
they do put a dyfference bytwen Metropolitanus and Archiepiscopus /
Metropolitanus.
saying / that Metropolitanus comes of Metron.1. me^i^ura / and poly.1.
ciuitas / so ye tha^ Metropolitanus is said / a mensura ciuitatis.1. of the
measure of a cite* where as in very deed / in the greek tongue they do not say
Metropolis: but Mitropolis / which is as much to say in the latyne tongue / as
Matere ciuitatis / or vrbis. And they will also / Patriarcha.
that Patriarcha is so called: because he is / as it were pacer patrum.1.
father of fathers / and that this word Papa comes of the interiection papae /
which is an interiection of meruaylyng or wondryng / Papa.
and that it is called Fides orthodoxa / quasi recta glia: Fides orthodoxa.
where as in very deed / orthodoxa betokens not rectam glori^m / but is as
much to say / as rectae opinionis: of eighte opinion. And they do pronounce
this word Simonem with the mydle syllable short: when in very deed they
ought to pronounce that word with the mydle syllable long / even so as they
do pronounce this word Platonem / and this word Catone^ / and many other like
things / which I pass over / lest for the fault of certain: I might seem to
blame and rebuke all popes. These things have I spoken to thentente / that no
man should marvel / if many popes could not espy and perceive / that the
donatyon of Constantine was but a famed or forged thing / allbeit yet. I do
judge / that this dys^eyte and gyle was bego^ne and brought up first by one of
the said popes. But you will say / why do not the emperors / to whose hurt
this thing did turn: deny the donation of Constantine but grant and
knowledge it / affirm it / and conserve or keep it? Forsooth this is an excedyng
strong argument / and a wonderful defense. An irony
for of what imperour speak thou? If thou do speak of the Greek emperor
/ which was the very e^perour in deed: than will I deny that ever he confessed
or granted the said donation. But if thou do speak of the latyne
emperor: I my self also will confess thy forlong to be true. For who is he
which knows not that the latyne emperor was freely made of the day? Steven
(as I w^ne) which deposed and put (...) the Greek emperor: Stephen the
second translated the empier from the Grekz to the french men.
because he would not bring help and aid to Italye / and made a latyne
emperor / so that the emperor should receive mo things of the pope: The
pope and the e^perour divided the e^pier between them two alone.
than the pope of the emperor* Doutles / the pope and the emperor departed
and divided the empier between them selves alone / by certain pactions and
couenau^tes: even as Achilles and Patroclus did deuyde between them two alone /
the riches of Troy / Achilles / and Patroclus.
which thing (as me seems) even the very words of Ludouicus do declare and
show / when he says. I Ludouike emperor of Rome / do decree / and grant by
this pacte of our co^frontation / to the / In decretis distinctione lxiii. Ego
Ludouicus. etc.
blessed Peter prince of the apostles / and by the to thy vycare lord
Paschalis being pope / and to his successors for evermore (be likewise as you
have holden them of our predecessors / in your power and dominion / Ludouike
the emperor called Jews the mylde.
eue^ unto this time) the cite of Rome / with the dukedom belongyng to it /
and all places within the precinct of the said city / and all villages /
streets / territories belongyng to it / both in the mou^tayns and in the sea
costs / havens / or al ryties / castles / towns / and vyllages / in the
parties of. Thustiab. etc. Ludouike do you make parts / couenauntes / or
bargaynes with Paschalis the pope if these aforesaid things be yours / that is
to say / if they do appertain to the empier of Rome: why do you grant and
give them to another? if they be his and be possessed of him: what needs you
to confirm them? Again how little of the Romayne empier shall be yours: if
you have lost ye very heed and chief cite of ye empier? The Romayne emperor
has his name of Rome. Moreover the residue which you have in possessyon / are
they yours: or do they belong to Paschalis? I suppose / you will say that they
are your own. Tha^ it follows / that the donation of Constantine is of no
strength / sei^g that you have in your possessyon those things / which were
given by him to the pope. If it be of strength: by what right does Paschalis
remitte or release the other things to you: retayninge to him self only
those things / which he has in possessyon? Is this it that is meaned by so
great la^gytion of the Romayne empier / of you toward him / or of him
toward you? Tha^ do you worthily* and not without a cause / call it a pacte /
that is as a man would say / a certain collutio^ or false packi^g bytwen you
two. But peradventure you will say to me / what shall I do? Shall I go about to
recover by war / those things which the pope violently and wrongfully
holds from me? That should nothi^ge avail me / The pope is stronger in
battle tha^ the emperor.
for he is of more might and power that way: than I am myself. Shall I make
claim and title to the^ / by right and law? That could not help / for my
right is no more: but even so much / as it shall please hi^ to grant me. For I
came not to the e^pier by the way of inherytaunce: but only by pacte and
couenaunte / that if I would be emperor: I should promise such and such
things / to the pope again of my part. The pope has made emperors upon
certain conditions and couenauntes.
Shall I say / that Constantine gave no whitte at all of the empier? If I did
so: I should defend the cause of the Greek emperor / and put my self clean
from all the dygnyte of the empier. For the pope says / that he makes me
emperor upon this condityon: that I should be as a certain vycare or deputy
under hi^ / and except that I will promise so to be: he will not make me
emperor. And except that I will obey him according to my promise: he says /
that he will depose me again. So that he will give these things to me: I will
confess and knowledge all things / I will promise and couenaunte with him /
what so ever things he shall require of me. But yet believe me / if I had Rome
/ or Thustia in my possession / not only I would not than do as I do now: but
also it should be labors all in vain / for Paschalis to tell me that tale of
the donation of Constantine / which as I deem / is falsely forged. But now I
do grant and give those things / which neither I have in my possessyon:
neither do hope that ever I shall have. To inquire and make search of the popes
right: that appertains not to me / but to the emperor of Constantinople. Now
Ludouike you have excused your self to me suffycie^tly / and whatsoever other
e^perour is like to Ludouike. What ought to be demed of ye paction and promise
made bytwen other emperors and the popes: when we do know so euyde^tly / what
Sigismu^dus has done / Sigismunde the emperor brought i^ his extreme age / to
exceeding great pouerte.
which verily at all other times / and in all other points / was the best and
most valyau^te prince: but now in extreme age / not so hardy and valyant as he
was before / whom we have our selves seen / having but a few servants or a
small guard about him / to wander through Italy / knowing not this day / how
or where to have his dinner to morrow / and likewise to have been famisshed at
Rome / if Eugenius had not given him fode / Popes do no things for naught.
but not for naught / for he extorted a donation of him. This Sigismundus /
when he was comen to Rome for to be crowned there / the emperor of the romans /
Sigismunde ere he could be crowned at Rome / was feign to confyrme the danation
of Constantine.
he could not be crowned by any means of ye pope / but only upon this
condition / that he should allow and confyrme the donation of Co^sta^tine / and
give and grant the same things now again a fressh. what thing is more
repugnau^t and contrary / than yt he should be crowned e^perour of Rome: which
had renou^ced and given from himself ye cite of Rome? Mark well this gear /
how well it stands together.
and yt he should be crowned of him: who^ both himself does confess and
knowledge / and also as much as lies in hi^ / he does make lord of the Romai^e
empier? and yt he should allow and confirm ye donation of Constantine which if
it were true: nothing at all of the empier / should be left or remain to the
emperor? Which thing / as I suppose and judge: The coronation of the emperor
ought to appartayne to the people of Rome which (...) the pope chalengeth to
hi^ self only.
not very children would have done. Wherefore it is so much less marvel / if
the pope do challenge and take upon hi^ the coronation of the emperor: which
ought to appertain unto ye people of Ro^e. If thou O pope / both art able to
deprive the Greek e^perour: of Italy and of the proui^ces of the West. And
do also make ye latyne e^perour: Why use thou such pactio^s / promyses /
and couenau^tes? Why do thou part and deuyde ye goods of Caesar? He is no
very emperor / and also he is forsworn: that goes not about to recover the
cite of Rome / from the pope.
Why do thou translate the e^pier unto thy self? wherefore let him know /
who so ever is e^perour of Rome: that in my judgment he is neither Augustus /
neither Caesar / neither emperor: except he do hold and keep the e^pier and
governance of Rome / and except he do give dilyge^ce / and enforce himself to
recover the city of Rome: that he is perjured and forsworn. For the emperors
in old time / The emperors in old time / were not sworn solempnely to the
pope as they are now a days
of whom Constantine was the first: were not constrained to make any such
solemn oath / wherewith now adays but emperors are bounden. but only / that
/ as much as might be done by man's power: they should minysshe nothing of
the amplytude and majesty of the empier of Rome. but that with all their labor
and dilygence they should augmente and increace it. yet were they not therefore
called Augusti / quod imperiu^ augere deberent. 1. for that they ought to
augmente the empier (as the opinion of some men is / which are vnskylled in
the latyne tongue) But Augustus is as much to say / as Sacer / holy or

that as every pope was most victouse and worst disposed: so he gave him self
most to the defending of this donation. of which sort / Boniface the eight
was: Nota.

which deceived Celestyne by trumpes put within the wall. This Bonifacius
also writes of the donatio^ of Constantine. and he deprived or deposed the
king of France. and iuged the kyngedome of France (as if he would have put
the said donation in execution) to have been / and to be subject to the church
of Rome. which thing / as being leude and against right shortly after his
successors Benedicte / and Clement / did rebuke. But what means this your
careful dilygence / O you popes of Rome / Bened. 12 Clement pope.
that you do require of every emperor the confirmation of the said donation
of Constantine: but that you put diffydence and (...) in your right and title?
But you labor (...) amples whereof we may find every where. Neither it is
ordained by the law of nature / It is against humanite and contrary to the
nature of man to exercise violente rule over other of his own hind:
that one people should subdue and make subject another people to it self. We
may counsel and teache / and exhort other men / but we may not play ye lords
over the^ / and do vyole^ce to them: except we will renounce and forsake all
humanite / and cou^terfayte and follow ye most ferce and cruel bestes / which
done exercise a cruel and a blody empier upon the weaker beasts / and those
which are of less might and strength. as the lion / over four foted beasts /
the egte over fowls of the air / and the Dolphyn over fyshes. But yet for all
this / these before rehearsed beestes / do not challenge or usurp any power over
the beestes of their own kind: but only upon those yt be of other lower
kinds / how much more than ought we to do so: and one man to have regard and
reverence to another man / Master Fabius.
seeing ye (as Master Fabius said) there lives none so wode a be upon
earth: but he does regard his own Image / and does avoid the hurtyng
thereof. There is therefore.iiii. Four causes warrior wars are made most
communely.
causes / wherefore most co^me^ly wars and batayles are made / either it is
for to revenge iniuryes or wrongs / and to defend our friends / or else it is
for fear of calamite / yt we shall receive after wards: if the strength and
might or power of other / were suffered to grow and increse / or else it is for
ye hope of pray / or else for the desire of glory and renown / of the which
four causes / the first is somewhat honest / the second but little honest /
the two last are in no wife honest. And in very deed wars have been made
ofte^tymes against the Romans. but after they had defended themselves they
made war both upon them and other ^^tions. Neither is there any nation or
people / which has given place / and be^ obedient to their dominion: except
they were vainqueshed and subdued by battle / how well and how rightfully / or
for what cause: auise the^ selves / for I will not neither condemn them / as
if they have tought wrongfully: neither assoyle or quite them / as if they
have fought ryghtfullye. This only I will say: that by the same reason / and
for the same cause / the Romans made war upon other nations: by which
reason / and for the which cause / other kings and peoples did. And that it
was laufull for them / upon whom war was be gonne / and which were
vai^quesshed or overcome by bataile / to have gone from the Romans / and to
have forsaken the^: even so as they had done from other lords / which had
subdued them. Left peradventure (which thing no man would say) all the empiers
might be brought again to those most aunciente lords of the old time: which
were first lords / that is to say / which first took away other mines lands
and goods. And yet is there better right to the people of Rome in the nations
conquered by battle: than is to the emperors / oppressynge the common weal.
Wherefore if it was laufull for nations and peoples to shrink or go away from
Constantine / and (which is a gretter thing) from the people of Rome: without
any doubt / it shall be laufull for them / to refuse and forsake him for their
governor: to whom so ever Constantine has given and released his right and
title. And that I may speak more boldly / if it was laufull for the Romans /
either to depose or drive out Constantine / so as they did Tarquine? or else to
kill him / Tarquin the proud the last king of the Romans of Iulyus Caesar.
Read suetonius in the life of him.
so as they did Julius Caesar: much more it shall be laufull for the Romans or
the provinces / to kill him: which is succeeded (so as it is) in to the room /
and stead of Constantyne. This thing / albeit that it is true: yet is it
beyond the bonds of my cause or matter. And therefore I will refrain and rule
or measure my self. and I will infer or conclude none other thing at this
time of these things before reherced: but only / that it is peuisshnes or
madness / where the vyolence or force or arms is: there any man to allege or
bri^ge in ye right or title of words (for ye same thing which is gotten or
wo^ne^ with war: is also lost again with battle) and that by so much the more
/ seeing that other strange nations (as we have herd say of ye goths) which
were never under thempier of Rome: have won Italy / and many proui^ces / and
entered upon them / driuyng out the old inhabytau^tes / which now to be called
again into ye servitude / i^ which they were never before: what right or
equity (I beseech you) is it: namely these natyo^s which have conquered into
the seruytude of them / peradventure: which have been conquered? At which time
if any cities and nations (as we know it to have been done in very deed) being
destituted and forsaken of the emperor of Rome: were constrained / at the
coming of the Barbarous pope / of nec^^syte / to choose a king to the^ selves /
under whose governance they have gotten the vyctory: should they afterward
depose him from his ki^gedome? or should they be wylli^g and desyer to have his
sons live private / without any rule or auctorite (which are worthy to be
favored / both for their fathers sake / and also for their own virtue and
manlynes) that their selves might be again under ye emperor of Rome? namely
when their selves should co^tynually need the labor and dilygence of them: and
should not hope to have help or aid from any where else? If Caesar him self /
or Constantine / if he were alive again / or also the senate and the people of
Rome would call the matter to the common judgment / such as was some time the
judgment of the Amphictions in Greece land: Read the proverb Amphictiones.
he should be put back / and cast forthwith at the first action: For that he
did demand and claim again in to the service and bondage / those men whom
he being their gouernoure / had forsaken long syns / and which had lived so
long season under another prince and governor / and which never had been
subject / to a king of another country / and which finally were men borne to
liberty / and which were restored in to liberty / by the strength and
valyau^tnes both of mind and body. So that it may cuyde^tly appear / if Caesar
/ if the people of Rome / be excluded from claymi^g them again in to
subiectio^s and seruytude: much more than the pope is excluded from making
such claim. And if it be laufull for other nations / which were under Rome /
either to create and make a king over them selves or to keep and hold a
common wealth: much more it is laufull for the people of Rome to do the same
thing / namely and against ye new and strau^g tyranny of ye pope.

The fy^th pri^cipall part and the last of this work / ^ which it is showed
/ yt the pope can not make any p^scription ^n those things which he
possesses: how so over long time he has had them in his possessyon.
Because our adversaries are now excluded from defe^dyng of the donation of
Constantine / in as much as there was never any such donation made / and
though there had been / it should now have been dead / through the condition
and state of times: they do run to another kind of defense / and as you
would say / forsakyng the cite: they get them selves into a castle or
fortelage / which forthwith they shall be compelled to yield up: because their
vytayles shall fail them. Prescription is / when any man has had possession
of house or lands so long time as any man alive ca^ remember as by the space
of an. c. years or more:
The church of Rome (they say) has made prescription in those things: which
it possesses. Why does than the said church require and claim again those
things (which is the greater part) in which it self has not made
prescription / and in which other men has prescribed? except it be not
laufull for other men / to do the same thing to the pope: which it is laufull
for him / to do to other men. The church of Rome (you say) has prescrybed.
Why does she than give so greatly care and dilygence / to have her right and
title to often confirmed of the emperors? why does the said church than bost
the donation / and the confirmation of the emperors: if this thing alone
(that is to wit / prescription) were suffycient? Thou do injury to it: if
thou do not keep silence of the other right or title also. Why do thou
not than keep silence of the one? Verily / because this alone is not
suffycie^t. Malae fidei possessio.

Stulfae fidei possessio.

Ignorantia facti.


Thou say ye church of Rome has p^scribed. How can ye church of Ro^e have
made p^scription: where there is none euyde^ce or certe^tie of any rizyogh;t
title / but only a false and unjust possession / or else if thou do deny yt
it is a unjust possession and of yuell faith / forsooth you can not deny it to
have been a possession of folisshe faith or crede^ce. Ought the ignorance / as
they call it: Facti et iuris to be holden excused i^ so great a matter: and so
open and manifest / ye ignorance of ye deed / I call not to know that
Consta^tyne did never give Rome and the prouynces / whereof to be ignorau^te: ^s
a poynt^ of an idyate or unlearned man / and not of a pope. Ignorance of the
right / Ignorantia Iuris
I mean / not to know that those things could neither be given of the one
part: neither b^ received of the other part / whereof to be ignoraunte is a
point of him that is scarsely a Christen man. Shall than the folysshe credulyte
or lyghtnes of gyueng credence / cause the to have right and title in those
things: which / if thou had ben wiser / should never have been thine? What?
Shalt thou not now at the least wise lose that right and title (if thou
had any at al) seeing that I have declared so plainly / that it was long of
ignorance and folysshnesse: that thou dyddest possess them? And that thing
which ignorance leudly and wrongfully has given to the: shall not knowledge
well and rightfully take again ye same a way from the? And shall not the bond
man or prentyce return again from the unjust lord / to the right master?
ye^ peradventure even with the fruit and profit which thou have taken / by
the occupyeng and vsyng of him? For if thou do continue and hold on to
possess them yet still: now thine ignorance is turned into malice and fraud
or gyle / and thou art plainly and utterly made (as they call it in latyne
tongue) Malae fidei possessor / that is to say / a possessor of evil faith / in
as much as thou know yt he had no right to give those things / which thou
possessest: of whom thou dyddest receive them. you did say / that ye church of
Rome has prescribed.

Nota.
O unlearned foles / O you ignorant persons and vnskylled of gods law. No
nombre of years / be it never so great: can abolysshe or wipe away the true and
just title. In cause it were so / that I had been taken prisoner of the
Barbarions / and had been supposed verily to have been deed / if now after an
hundredth years in which I had been prisoner / I did return again in to mine
own country: shall I be excluded therefore from claymyng and making title to
the inherytaunce / which my father has left me? what thing can be more
cruel / and more contrary to all humanite: than this? And to bring you some
example.

When the children or sons of Ammon / did require and claim again the land
/ from the costs or borders of Arnon even unto Iabue / and unto the river
Iordane: did Iepthe the captain of Israel make answer in this wise to them.
The israelytes have prescribed now by the space of three hundred years? or did
he show that the land which they claymed: had / never ben possessed of them /
but of the Amorreanes? and that this was an euydente argument or proof / that
the said land did not belong to the Ammonites: seeing that within the
compass of so many years / they had neither claymed nor demanded it again.
The church of Rome has prescrybed. Prescription is made only of dumb and
unreasonable things.
Hold thy peace wicked and mischeuouse tongue. Thou do translate
prescryption / which is made only of doumbe things and unreasonable: unto man
/ whom by how much the longer they have possessed in seruytude and bondage: so
much the more detestable their possession is. Birds / and wild beestes / will
not that any prescryptyon be made upon them selves, but how so ever long time
they have been had in possessyon: yet when they list / and occasyon shall be
offered to them: they do go away. and shall it not be laufull for a man of whom
another man has had the possessyon: like wise to go away from him / as the
bird or wild best does? Harken now a thing / whereby the fraud or gyle of
popes / rather than the ignorance of them may appear. which done use to be
tried and iuged by war and battle: and not by right and law. Popes will
try their right by war and not by the law.
And I suppose verily / that the first popes in taking possessyon / and entryng
upon the cite of Rome / and the other towns / did in much like manner facio^. A
little before I was borne (I take record of them / which were present and do
remember it well enough) Rome took or received the empier rule / and
governance / or rather the tyranny of the pope / where long before that time /
it had been free: by a strange kind of fraud or gyle / such as has not ben
herd of herafore. The pope at the time of whom I do speak: was Boniface the
nynth / The fraud and craft of pope Boniface the ix. not inferior in
wickedness to Boniface the viii.
pere and egall to Boniface ye eight / in fraud and in name / if it be to that
they are to be called Bonifacii: that is to say good doers: Qui pessime faciu^t
/ that is to say / which are most evil and shrode doers. And when the
Romans / after yt they had perceived the fraud and gyle / were angry in their
minds / and discontente among them selves: Tarquin
Boniface ye pope / after the manner of Tarquinius stroke of all the highest
heddes of ye popies or chessebouls with a rod or wa^de so caused he the hedes
of them to be stricken of / which were of most might and power. which thing /
wha^ Innoce^cius / A propre and semely act for a pope to do.
which succeeded would have counterfayted and followed: he was driven or chased
out of the cite. I will not speak of other popes / Innocentius the vii. was
driven out of Rome.
which have always holden Rome oppressed by vyolence and force of arms.
Albeit / as often as it might: it has always rebelled / as syx years ago /
wha^ it could not optayn peace of Eugenius / neither the enemies had peace /
which did besege it: it self also beseged ye pope within his own house /
Eugenius the iiii. of that name was fame ^o di^gyse hi^ self in a monks coule
/ and so to save the water of Tybi^ / the Romans sho^^^g and ^^^owyng stones
after him.
and would not suffer him to go from thence before that either he did make peace
with ye enemies: or else would remitte and release the administration and
governance of the City to ye citizens / But he chose raither to forsake the
city / disgysyng him self in the habit or wede of another man / and having
but one to wait upon him: than to do pleasure to the citizens / which desired
nothing of him / but such things as were agreeable to right and equite /
which if they were put to free choice: who does not know / but that they would
chose rather liberty / than thraldom and bondage. It pleases me to deem and
judge the same of other cities: which be retained and holden in servitude of the
pope / by whom they ought to have been delivered from thraldom. It were to
long a thing to reherce how many cities ye people of Rome has made free:
which they did win and take of their enemies / Titus flaminius.
in so much that Titus Flaminius did bydde or will all Grecela^de which had been
in subjection under Antiochus: to be free / and to use their own laws. But
the pope / as we may euyde^tly se) lies in wait all ye ever he can: to begyle
peoples / and to spoil the^ of their lyberty. The pope studieth as much as he
can to bring all men into bo^ndage and thraldom.
And therefore they likewise again of their part / when they have occasyon
offered: do rebel (take example hereof even now of Bonony) which if at any
time / of their own accord / which thing is possible enough to have chanced)
and with good will / they did co^sente to the papale empier / by the reason of
some great ieoperdy yt was toward them / and nere at hand from other
outnations and people: it is not yet so to be understood and taken / that
they did co^sente to make themselves bo^dmen / so yt they might never withdraw
their necks from under the yoke / and so that they also: which should be
borne afterward: should not be at lyberty / neither have any power over their
own selves for this were over much against right and reason. We come to the /
O pope / of our own free wylles: that thou should govern us. Now again of
our own free wylles / we do go from the and forsake the / that thou should
govern us no longer. If thou think that we be any thing in thy debt: let
account be made of such things as have been given and received / both of thy
part and of ours. But thou will govern us spite of our tethe / and whether
we will or no / as though we were wards / or children under full age. and yet
peradventure we could govern the more wisely: tha^ thou ca^nest govern us.
Besides this / many injuries and great wrongs are done very oftymes to this
city: by the and thine heed officers / we take god to record / Iniurye
constrayneth us to rebelle / and to go from the: as it did cause the children
of Israel in old time to rebelle against Roboam. 3. Regu^. 2
And what so great injury / or how great a portion of our calamite was that /
I mean to pay to sore or greuouse tributes? The Roma is have far gretter
cause / to rebelle against the pope: than the Israelytes had against Roboam.
For what if thou do euacuate / empouerishe and consume the substance of our
common weal? Thou have done so / what if thou do spoil or rob churches?
Thou have spoiled the^ / what if thou do defloure virgyns and defyle wives?
Thou have done it without fail / what if thou do embrue the city with the
blood of ye cytizens causi^g them to make battle and war among the^ self /
one with another? Thou have not failed to do so. Ought we to suffer those
things? or else rather / seeing that thou have ceased to be a fader to us: shall
we also forget / yt we be thy sons? This people called yt to them and chose
the pope / for to be a father. or (if this do please and delight ye more) to be
a lord or governor unto the^ / not to be an enemy and a tyra^nouse murderer
of them. And thou will not play ye father or the lord and governor: but ye
enemy and the tourme^tour. We / albeit yt we might rightfully follow ye
ensample of thy cruelte and impiete / co^sydering ye extreme injuries which
thou do to us: yet yt natwithsta^di^g / for as much as we be christen men /
we will not. Neither will we be reue^ged upon the with ye sword / taki^g thy
life from the: but only disposi^g the / we will chose to us another father or
lord. The sons may fle or ro^ne away from their pare^tes / of who^ they were
begotten: if the said pare^tes be evil and cruel. And shall it not be
laufull for us to fle from the: which art not our very and natural father /
but only a father adoptyue and by election (for ye it pleases us to chose and
call ye thereunto) and which do entreat us in the worst and most cruel
manner and facyon? And meddle thou / and take thou care for the ordryng of such
things / which do belong to ye office of a priest: Esaie 14.
and be not in mi^de or will / to build the a seat in the north. and from
thence to thu^dre and throw forth flaming lyghteni^ges / upon this people /
and other. But what needs me to make any mo words in this thing / which is
most open and euydent? I say plainly to abyd by it / not only yt Constantine
never gave so great things / not only yt the pope of Rome could not
prescribe in ye same things: but also in case that the one had given / and the
other had prescribed: yet that nothing withstanding / I say / that both
these rightes or tytles are lost and destroyed / The fountaine^ and original
cause of the ruin and decay of Italye.
through ye abhomynable offenses and crimes of ye possessours. For as much as
we do se / that ye calamite / decay / and ruin / or destruction of al Italy /
and of many proui^ces: has flowen out of this one fou^tayne and spri^ge
alone. If the fountain be bitter in it self: the river or stream / that
comes from it / must needs also be bitter / if the root be unclean and
poisoned: ye branches must needs be likewise poisoned. Iacobi.3.
So contrary wise again / if ye river or streme be bitter: ye fou^tayne or
spring is to be stopped up / if the branches be unclean and unwholesome: the
fault comes from the root. Si missa sa^cta non est delibatio quoque
abomina^da est. May we bri^ge forth and allege ye on^ation of the papale power
for right and law: which we do se to be ye cause of so great sines / and of so
great mischeuouse euylles / of all kinds and sorts? wherefore I do say / and
also do cry out with loud voice (for I will not fear men: putting my
confyde^ce and trust in god: Psalm. 117
that there has been no pope in my time / which in his popedom has been either

do we not suppose the same thing to be done and brought to pass in the pope
and other clerks? And yet we do afterward wene / ye god would suffer
Syluester / to receive the thing: that should be the matter and occasyon of
synni^g. I will not suffer this wrong and eniurie to be done to the most good
and virtuous bisshoppe: that he shall be reported and said to have received and
taken empiers / kyngdoms / and prouynces: which things even they also are
wont to renounce: which desyer / and are in will to be made clerks. Syluester
had but a few things in possessyon / Siluester and the other holy popes were
but small possessioners.
and ye other popes were but small possessioners: whose visage and sight was

and that with all shameful vices: they may pass and overcome the exellent
and commendable virtues of them / what Christen man is he: that can suffer
these things with a pacient and a quiet mind? But I in this my first
oration / will not exhort and call upon princes and peoples / that they should
stop and inhibite the pope / which conneth at large with an unbridled and
unruly course / and that they should compelle him / to rest and to abide
within his own bounds or meares: but only / that they do admonisshe him /
for paraduenture now that he shall ones have knowledge of the troth: he shall of
his own free will get himself forth from another man's house in to his own
house / and from the outragiouse waves or belawes / and cruel te^pestes or
storms: i^to ye port or haue^. But if he will refuse so to do: tha^ shall we
buckle and prepayre our selves / to ye making of another oration much more
ferce and cruel than this. O the charitable and godly wisshe of Valla.
Would god that I might ones (for there is no thing / that I do more long
for) se it brought to pass / and that namely by my counsel: that the pope
were only the vicare of Christ and not also the vicare of the emperor / and
that this horrible saying may be no more herd. The church fyghteth and warreth
against ye perusians. The church fyghteth against the people of Bonony. It is
not the church that fyghteth or warreth against Christian men: Ephesians. 6.
but it is the pope / that so does. The church fights against wicked spirits
in the regio^s of the air Than shall the pope both be called: and also be in
very deed / an holy father / the father of all men / the father of the church
/ neither shall he than raise or stir up wars and batayles among Christen
men: but he shall alay and cease the wars / which have be^ stirred up by
other: by his apostolic censure and papal majesty.

Thus ends the declamation of Laurence Valla: against the forged privilege /
called the donation of Constantyne.
The sentence and mind of Nicholas of Cusa / cardinal by the title of saint
Peter ad vincula: concerning ye donation of Constantine / which sentence he
wrote to the council assembled at Basile in the third book ye second cha. of
the catholyke concordau^ce and agreement.
ONe thing I can not pass over with silence: because it is the undoubted and
assured sentence / well nere of all men / that Constantine the emperor did give
for ever the empier of the weste / to Siluester pope of Rome / and to his
successors / whiles the world shall continue. And therefore / all though the
reason and argument of the unite of the pri^cypall regente and governor (which
is / that it is against right and good order / that there should be two hedes or
pri^cipal governors) did not conclude: yet never thelesse / it should be open
and evident / that there can be none emperor ryghtfully in ye west: except he
would aknowlege his empier to be dependently of the pope. I have serched out
this rote as dilygently as I could / presupposing this thing also to be
undoubted and of surety: that Constantyne might have made such gift or grant
/ which question for all that / neither has soyled hitherto: neither by all
lykelyhode shall ever be solued. But in very truth I marvel excedyngly / if
that thing be of troth and matter in deed: The donatio^ of Constantyne is not
found i^ any aute^tical books or in any approved histories
that it is not found in autenticall books / and in approved histories. I have
red / and red again / all ye iestes or acres of the emperors / and the
histories of the popes of Rome: which I could find. and the works of saint
Ierom: which was most dilygente / to make collection or gaderinge of all
things. the works also of Augustyne / Ambrose / and of diverse other very
well learned men. I have turned over and over again / the things done in the
holy and worshipful councels / which have been syns the councils called
Consiliu^ nicenu^. and yet can I not find any thing / that does agree and
accord with those things which are red / concerning the said donation.

Holy Damasus the pope / Damasus (...) pope at (...) Iheromes ^^^queste: dyd^
write the acts of his predecessors*
is said at the instau^ce and request of saint Jerome: to have set forth the
acts and deeds of his predecessors. in whose work / there is no such thing
found: as is co^munely reported and talked of Siluester the pope. It is read
in certain histories: that Constantine was baptized of Siluester. and that the
same emperor did meruaylously adourne and deck those.iii. churches / of saint
John^ of saint Peter / and of saint Paul / and that he gave many yearly rentes
and revenues out of certain percels of land / in diverse provinces and
Islands: for the mayntenyng and vpholdi^g of the garnisshyng and adournynge of
laumpes / of baulme / and of the precious oynteme^t of pure narde / and of
other things / of all which things a man shall find perticulare mention made
in the book of popes / But concerning the donation of the te^porall dominion /
of the empier of the west: there is nothing at all therein contained. Astulphus
ki^ge of Lombardye.
But we read ye after Astulphus king of Lombardy had taken by force the
dominion and governance of Rauenna and many other places / And pope Steven the
second of ye name being a romain borne (whose fathers name was Co^sta^tyne) by
many ambassadors se^te to Astulphus / Steven the.ii anointed pipin the king

had required yt the places should be restored to ye imperial diction or
dominion / and Astulphus would not in any wise consent so to do: Steven went to
Pipine / and anointed him and his two sons kings. There was also an
ambassador of ye emperors / se^te with ye same Steven. and they optayned and
got grant of Pipine: that he should bri^ge Astulphus in mi^de / to restore
ye places to the empier. Pipine se^te ambassadors to Astulphe / but all that
auayled not. Wherefore because he could not by that mean obtain of Astulphe /
yt restytution should be made: he made promise to Steven / yt him self would by
force of arms take them from Astulphe / and that he would give the^ to sai^te
Peter. When ye emperors ambassador had herd this: he returned home again /
Pipin performed and fulfilled those things which he had promised / and the
form and manner of this donation or gift / is contained in ye acts of ye
aforsaid Steven / Pope zachari the first deposed Hilderike the king of
Frau^ce^ and translated the said kingdom to Pipin from the (...).
and also the perticulare names of all ye things / which were given. zachary
the pope did translate the monarchy or kingdom of France unto Pipin deposi^g
first and puttyng down Hilderike the king whereof it is read / in the.xv.
cause and ye.vi. question. Alins. etc. and in ye gloss Venerabile^. By the
reason hereof / I suppose. ye Pipin from thence forth did favor the apostolic
see. Afterward Desiderius king of Lo^bardie warm and recovered again by
force of arms / those cities or some of the^: ^
in the time of Adrian / Adrian the pope se^dyng many embasadours unto hi^:

Than Charlemayne / of whom Adrian desired aid and socour: recovered the
cities and gave the^ again to saint Peter / Charlemayn recovered the cities
again: which Desiderius with held: and gave therein to the pope
by a sole^pne gift or grant / which is contained in the acts of the said
Adrian pope. By these things it is euyde^te / yt Constantine did not give the
empier to the pope: by the duke dome of Rauenna / the cite of Rome / and the
west / whereof we do read / that contynually even until ye times aforesaid: the
emperors did with full right possess Rome / Rauenna / and Marchia / Places in

with many other places / even so as they had before. And this is proved by the
text in the.xcvi. disti^ction. Been quide^ etc. where it is spoken of
Patritius which was governor or captain in the name of king Adoacre / and in
the lxiii. disti^ction. Agatho etc. And in the xcvi. Read that text Cum ad

writes unto Constantine the emperor (which gathered or assembled the vi.
synod and follows many years after the first of that name) how the cite of
Rome is the seruyle cite of the emperor. And Boniface the pope / writes to

temporal things / and in the end he says. Bonifac. 1

evermore until the time of the aforesaid Pipine: the emperor remained in
possession of the places before named. Neither could I yet any where read / yt
ever any of the popes presumed to have any right or title / by ye name of saint
Peter / in the said places: until the time of Steven ye.ii. pope of that name.
These things I believe to be true: not withsta^dyng ye famous opinion of the
contrary / which is read in Palea the xcvi. disti^tion / Consta^tinus etc for
without doubt if that writing had not be^ apochriphe: Gratia^ knew no thing of
the donation of Co^sta^tine / and therefore it is not put in the old decrees of
his collection.
Gratianus should have found it in the old books and collections of the
canones / but because he did not find it: therefore he did not put it theri /
wherefore those things which he has added afterward he put that feigned
scripture for chafe: even so as we do find many other things of the
apocriphe writings to be written in our books / I have also found this
writi^g set forth of lenght / in a certain book: which co^tayneth much more
than that / which is put in the decrees / in the place before alleged / and
when I had dilyge^tly examined it: I found of ye self same scripture many
manyfeste and evident arguments and tokens of the forgynge and falsehed of the
same / which now to reherce here: it should be both tedyouse and also
unprofitable. This also is to be marked / yt the aforsayd writing Co^statinus
etc. The chapi. in the decrees / Co^sta^tinus. etc. is taken of the lege^de of
saint Siluester.
which is had in the xcvi. disti^ction: is extract and drawn out of the
lege^de of saint Siluester / and he which did put ye text in ye decree:

for there are many histories of saint Siluester. One / in ye which this is not
found / which histori Damasus the pope made. Another / whose author is not
known / which the text says not to be true: but that it may be read neither
says ye text / yet yt this thing is contained therein. Also ye old ancient
books of ye decrees / has not yt text / but only unto ye peragraffe It^^
decreta romanorum po^tificu^. etc. i^clusiuely. And so this peragraffe of ye
histori of Sil. Pope Martin. 1
is not found in those books. Also ye fifth universal Synod / which makes
mention of ye approbate books of al learned authors / and of ye approved
scriptures: Paulus and Sergius heretics
moreover ye Synod of Martin ye pope / which was made against ye assertion of
the^ which said yt there was but one will in Christ (yt is to wit / against
Paulus and Sergius) renuyng ye approved scriptures / as I my self have seen:
makes no me^tio^ of these histories / neither yet any other approved author /
or such as is accounted for a true author / Vince^t^us.
yt ever I saw makes any mention of the^. I have read i^ Vincent in ye
xxiiii. Constantine* as saint Jerome says) (...) his wy^^ (...) days (...)
book of histories in the end / after the mi^de of saint Jerome: ye
Co^sta^tine cruelly did slay his wife Fausta and his son Crispus. And that at
ye later e^de of his life / after yt he had been baptized of Eusebius bishop of
Nichomedia: he declyned to ye heresy of ye Arrians / from which time (as saint
Jerome says (spoylyng and robbrie of churches / and ye discord / debate / and
strife of the whole world has followed / even until this p^se^t time. These
things manifestly do repugne / and ar plai^ly contrary to ye book of the
acts of Siluester / which book Vincentius says to have been translated out of
Greek by a certain man / whose name he knows not / as it is had in the same
book in the ix. chap. who would not rather give credence to Jerome / which is
an approved author: than to ye writings of an unknown author / which
therefore are called Apochriphe scriptures? The text also / which is ascribed
to Melchiades ye pope / which is had in the.xii. cause and the first question
/ Futura^. etc. which text seems to be somewhat against this saying: Is not ye
text of Melchiades / after ye mi^de of a certain gloss / and also according
to ye very troth. Melchiades predecessor to Siluester
For Melchiades was p^decessour to Siluester / as it appears in ye cataloge of
the popes of Rome. And if Co^sta^tine was baptized of Syluester / according to
ye commune noise and fame: tha^ it is euyde^t / that ye title of ye text is
false. For it makes mention of ye baptism of Co^sta^tine. And albeit that ye
said text had been written by Melchiades: yet could not thereof any argument or
proof he taken against the p^misses / for it says nothing else / but ye
Constantine forsook ye imperial place of Rome / and granted it to Peter and
to his successors / that is to say / yt where sometime was ye imperial seat:
there is now ye papal see. Constanly was Christ i^ Melchia^ his time ^^^ter
the mine of saint Augustyne.
which thing no man denies. And troth it is / that Co^sta^tine the emperor
was in ye time of Melchiades ye pope / and that he was tha^ christen. as it is
red in the works of saint Augusti^e in many places: and namely in ye epistle
to Glorius and Elusyus / which beguineth in this wise.

Dixit quida^ aplolus. etc. and this also agrees with the mi^de of saint Jerome.
I have see^ also ye decre of Leo the pope in ye sinode holde^ at Ro^e / Leo
the.viii. restored to Otto all the lands which Pipin Charles and Roberto had
given to the church Rome.
with the subscription of the bisshoppes and clerks / and of the cytize^s of
Rome / where Leo ye pope restored to Otho the first / all ye places which had been given by ye kings / Pipyn / Charles / and Roberte / to saint Peter. And
all ye said places ar named in ye same decre / but there is no mention made of
ye donation of Co^sta^tine. In my iugeme^te those textes co^cerni^g
Co^sta^tine: ar apocriphe and of non auctorite.

Antonine ye archebisshoppe of Florence / says / as here follows: in ye
eyghte title / the second chapitour the eyghte paragraffe / of the first part
historiall.
THe third dout is of the donatio^ or gift made to the church by Constantine
/ of the which donation / mention is made in the decrees / the xCvi.
disti^ction Co^sta^tinus. But that chapitour is not found in the old and
au^cie^t book of the decrees. Therefore what and how much he gave: it is not
very certain. but never the less it seems at the lest wise to be that: which
Ludouyke ki^ge of France and emperor / Jews ye mylde.
promyseth under oath to Paschalis ye pope: and to his successors. whereof
mention is made in the.lxiii. disti^ction / Ego Ludouicus. etc. and which Otto
the first emperor of the Germayns / does confirm to John^ the pope / in the
same disti^ction / Tibi. etc. But yet even to this day / it is a great question
among the Canonistes and lawyers: whether ye donation and gift has holden.
which thing the Canonistes do utterly affirm / and the diuynes do more
confirm. And yt it was no plain donation: but rather a restitution made to
the church of her own ^^ght: For as much as all things are of the dominion
if Christ: whose vicare the pope is in earth. but the other things he has
dimyssed and left to the temporal ^ordes.

Raphaell Volaterrane in the life of great Consta^tyne: writes thus / as
follows.
OF the gift or grant of Constantine* there is no mention made in any
authors / save only in the book of decrees. And yt the said donation or
grant is not contained in the au^cie^t volumes of the old time. Antonie
bishop of Florence witnesses in his cronicles

Here ends the donation of Constantine.
