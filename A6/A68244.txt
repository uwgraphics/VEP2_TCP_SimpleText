The Text. Revel. CHAP. 20. VERSE. 7.8.9.10.
AND quhen the thousand eiris at expyrit, Satan sall be lowsed out of his
presone.

8 And sall go out to deceive the people quhilk ar in the four quarters of the
earth, euin Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, quhois number ar
as the sand of the sea.

9 And they went up into the plane of the earth, quhilk compassed ye tentis of
the Saintis about, and the belouit city: bot fire come down from God out of
the heauin, and devoured them.

10 And ye devil that deceauit them, was cast into a lake of fire and
brintstone, quhair that beast and that false prophet ar, and sall be tormented
euin day and nycht for ever more.

The Meditatione.
The access^le of the knowledge (...) Revel (...)
AS of all buikis the holy Scripture is may necessary for the instructioun
of ane Christian, and of all the scriptures, the buik of the Reuelatioun is
may meit for this our last age, as ane prophecy of the letter time: Sa have
I selected this place their of as may propre for the actioun we have in hand
presently: For after that the Apostle Iohne had prophecy it of the letter
times in the nyntene chaptouris preceding, he now in this 20 gatheris up ane
sum of the haill, quhairin ar expressed thrie heidis. First the happy estait
of the Kirk, from Christis dayis to the dayis of the defectioun and of ye
Antichrist, in the first sex versis of this 20 chap. Nixt the defectioun it
self, in this place that I have in hand, to wit, the seuint, aucht, nynt, and
tent versis. Thridlie the general punishment of the wickit in ye greit day of
Judgment, from the tent verse to the end of the chaptour. The Apostles meaning
in this place then is this, that after that Satan had been bound ane thousand
eiris, quhilk did appeir by his preceding discourse of the saintis triumphing in
the earth, he sall at last brek forth agaue lows, and for ane space rage in the
earth mair then ever befoir: bot it sall in the end be overcome and confoundit
for ever. It restis now, knawing the sum, that we come to ye expositioun of
their versis. And first we will expone or paraphrase the hardness of the wordis,
nixt interpreit ye meaning of them, and thridlie note quhat we sold learn of
all.

The first part.
AS to the wordis, in them for ordouris cause we man note, first Sathanis
lowsing, nixt his doing after that he is lowsit, and last his unhappy succes.
Then for ye first. Be Satan is meanit nocht only the Dragone enemy to Christ
and his Kirk, bot also with him all ye instrumentis in quhom he rewlis, Satan
i^ his instrumentis is lowsed to trouble the Kirk.
and be quhom he vtteris his cruel and crafty intentioums, specialie ye
Antichrist and his clergy: ioynit with ye Dragone befoir in the sextene chap.
verse. 17. and callit the beast and ye false prophet. For as Christ and his
Kirk ar callit after ane name Christ, be ressoun of their may aret vnioun,
and heavenly effectis flowing thairfra. 1, Cor. 12.12. sa Satan and his
synagoge ar heir richtlie callit Satan be ressoun of their vnioun and cursit
effectis flowing thairfra. Their thousand eiris ar bot ane number certane for
ane vncertane, quhilk phrase is often vsit be the Spirit of God in the
scriptures, meaning ane greit number of eiris. Mair over the presone quhairout
of he is lowsit is ye hellis quhilk by ye Spirit of God ar callit his presone
for two causes. Ane because during the time of this world at times appointit be
God he is debarrit from walking in the earth and send their, greatly to his
torment, 2. Pet. 2.^. Jude verse ^.
as was testifeit be ye miracle at Genesareth amangis the Gadarenis. Math.
8.28. Nixt because after ye consummatioun of ye world he sall be perpetually
impresonit thairin as is writtin mye same chap. verse. 10. Finalie he is lowsit
be interruptioun, and for ye may part, to ye judgment of men, abolitioun of
the synceir preaching of ye Gospel, ye true use of ye Sacramentis quhilkis ar
ye sealis and pledgis of ye promisis contenit thairin, and lawful exercise of
christian discipline, quhairby both word and sacramentis ar mantenit in
purity, callit in ye first verse, The greit chain quhairby ye Dragone is
bound, and signifeit be ye quhyte horse gouernit be ye Lamb. chap. 6. ver. 2.
Swa ye meaning of all yis 7 verse is this: The devil, having been bound, and
his power in his instrumentis having been restrainit for a lang space be ye
preaching of ye gospel, at last he is lowsed out of hell by ye raising up of
samony new errouris and notable evil instrumentis, especialie ye Antichrist
and his clergy, quha not only infectit ye earth of new, bot impyrit also over
ye haill, through the decresse of true doctrine and ye number of ye faithful
following it, and ye daily incres of errouris, and natiounis following them,
believing lies, haiting ye treuth, and taking pleasour in vnrichteousnes. 2 Thessalonians. 2.11.12. And this far for Sathanis lowsing. Now to the nixt, his doing
after that he is lowsit. First he gois ont to seduce ye natiounis that a^ into
ye four corneris of ye earth, Satan first deceiuis, then allures to follow him,
and in end makis all his to tak armor against the Kirk.
and they become his, thocht in certain degreis his tirannie and travel
appearis, and birstis out in some mair then in vtheris. For as all that do guide
ar inspyrit be God thairto, and vtteris the same in certane degreis, according
to the measour of grace grantit unto them. Sa all that do evil ar inspyred be
Satan, and vtteris the same in diverse degreis, according as that ducleue
spirit takis possessioun in them, and be diverse obiectis alluris them to do
his will, sum be ambitioun, sum be inuie, sum be malice, and sum be feir, and
so forth, and this is his first wark. Secundlie he gatheris Gog and Magog to
battle in number like the sand of the sea, and so he and his inclynit to
battle and bludeshed, have michtie armies, and in number money, inflammed with
cruelty. The special heidis and rewlaris of their armies, or rather rankis of
confederatis to go to battle and to fecht ar two heir named, Gog and Magog.
Gog in Hebrew is callit hid and Magog reveled, to signify that in two sortis
of men cheiflie Satan sall utter him self, to wit, hypocritis and awowit
enemers to God. It is said then that Satan sall in the letter times impyre of
new over the World, quho sall steir up the nationis under the baneris of their
two enemeis to God, the hypocritical and awowit, to sprid them selfis in greit
multitudes upon the earth. Thridlie they sall ascend upon the plane of the
earth, presumpteouslie and proudly bragging of their number and force, and
thinking nane sall be abill to resist their rage. They sall compass and
besiege the campis of the saintis, and the belouit eitie, that is, the handful
of the faithful belouit of the Lord, quhome agams, confyding in their
vntellable number like the sand of the sea, they sall make a cruel and
vnceassabill weir. The elect ar callit saintis and belouit. The ele^^ at the
Sain^es, and the beloved city of GOD.
because they are in the lufe of God selectit, and be grace ingrauit in Christ,
in quhome they are comptit and fund iustifeit, sanctifeit, worthy of love and
endless glory. Their faithful fellowship is comparit to tentis, and to a city
belouit, to signify their continual weirfair in the earth aganis Satan and
sin, with all his instrumentis: their mutual amity and freindlie
coniunctioun in love amangis them selfis: and concurrence to mancene the guide
cause that their God hes cled them with: bot cheiflie to signify the michtie
and all sufficient protectioun in prosperity and adversity, flowing from God
for their just defense aganis all powers that can persew, quhairby they also
become fair as the Moon, pure as the Sone, terrible as ane army with baueris,
Cant. 1.6, 9. ea as a defencit city: ane irne pillair: and wallis of bras
against ye haill earth. Ier. 1.18. The s^mne then of Sathanis doingis after he
is lowsit is this: He sall deceive ye natiounis: he sall gather ane infinite
number of hypocritis and awowit enemeis togidder inflammed with cruelty, and
their sall in prydefull presumptioun fearcelie bend them felfis against ye chosm
of God, and his treuth professit be them. Bot quhat at last sall ye succes be?
Suirlie may unhappy. For fire sall cum down from heauin, and devour them, and
ye devil yat deceauit them and all his instrumentis, cheiflie ye beast and
falls prophet sall be cast in ane laik of fire and brintstone, and sall be
tormented day and nycht incessantly for ever and ever: that is, how greit that
ever their braggis be, how neir yat ever they sall appeir to be at their
intent, God from heuin as the palace and throne quhairfra he geuis pruife of
his mercy towardis his awin, and of his justice towardis his enemeis, sall
send plagues and destructioun, asweist ordinar, as extraordinar, upon them.
Ordinar be reueiling their wickitnes be ye thundering mouths of true
pastouris, quhilk is often callit fire in the scriptures. Extraordinar by all
corporal plagues to their utter destructioun and vntellable torment for ever
in the hellis. This far for the expolitioun or paraphrase of the words.

The secund part.
NOW followis the interpretatioun of the sentence according to the ordour vsit
in the first part. And first we man know quhat time their thousand or money eiris
was in, and quhen and how was Satan lowsit. The purity of the Gospel in
during st^yes the Ant^^h^isti^ ry^i^^g.
This time is to be found in the saxt chaptour, in the opening of the first
thrie seals of ye secreit buik of Gods providence beye Lamb: To wit, ye time
quhen the quhyte, read, and black horses had their course in the world. And to
speak mair plainly, ye Devils power did lurk, quhilk is callit his binding,
and ye Euangell did floreish in ane ressonable purity money hundredth eiris
after Christ, as ye Ecclesiastical histories beir witness. For in greit purity
the Gospel did continue lang, quhilk is signifeit by the course of the quhyt
horse, albeit ye professouris we under ye croce signifyit by ye reid horse, and
traublit wonderfully be heretickis, signifeit by ye blak horse, by wormewod
that fell in ye fontainis of wateris in ye third trumpet, and by wateris that
ye Oragone spewit out of his mouth in ye visioun of ye Dragone and ye woman.
chap. 12. This time did endure from Christ, ane space after Augustinis duy is,
quhen ye bloody sword of persecutioun ceassing, ye haill Kirk began to be
defylit with diverse heresies, quhilk cumming to ane mature and ripe heip did
produce ye Antichrist, signifeit be ye paill horse in ye fourt seall, ^^o Gospel
(...) be (...).
by ye king of ye locustis in ye 5 trumpet, by Babylon in ye 11 and 18 chap. by
ye secund beast rising out of ye sea in ye 13 chap. and by ye woman cled with
scarlet in ye 17. The arysing of ye hereseis and ye Antichrist breading of
their smok is in this place callit ye lowsing of Satan. Now followis after
this his lowsing quhat he dois: He deceiuis ye natiounis universally: he
gatheris Gog and Magog with intellable armies to fecht: he leuies up upon ye
plane of ye earth: he compassis ye tentis of ye saintis, and ye belouit city
about. Their ar his doingis. Now because their actiounis ar may viuelie declarit
in other placis of ye same buik, I will shortly allege them to make ye matter
cleir be conference of places expomng every ane ane other. It is said in ye 9
chap. that ye Antichrist sall hound out his locustis or ecclesiastic ordouris
be fair allurementis to intyse ye world to eild to his and their abominable
hereseis, and sall preuaill over ye may part. It is said in ye 11 chap. that
he sall persecute ye saintis, kill ye two witnessis, and sall rejoice with ye
kingis of ye earth for their killing, as having been ye only lettis to his
full glory. It is said in ye 13 chap. that he sall blaspheme God in usurping
his power: that be ye advise and assistance of ye falls prophet or falls kirk he
sall send out his imagis or ambassadouris throw ye world persecuting and
destroying them that will nocht obey him and them, and acknawledge his
supremacy: ea nane sall be sufferit to by or sell or use civil society that
acknawledgis not his supreme power and dignity. It is said in ye 16 chap. that
God plaguing him for their forsaidis abusis, he sall be sa far from repentance,
as be ye coutrair he sall find out ane new sort of vermin, that is, are new
ecclesiastic ordour, quhilk at callit their froggis, quha sall move and entyse
ye princes of the earth to join with him and make weir against ye faithful,
preissing utterly to destroy them: and of that battle and the end thairof
dois this place make mentioun. Now shortly join all this togidder, and sa
obtene the meaning. Their sall arise ane Antichrist and enemy to God and his
Kirk: he sall be hew of ane falls and hypocritical Kirk: he sall clame ane
supreme power in earth: he sall usurp the power of God: he sall deceive men
with abusing locustis: he sall persecute ye faithful: nane sall be fund that
dar awowedlie resist him: in end, feiling his kingdom decay, and the true kirk
beginning to kyith, he sall by ane new sort of deceiving spiritis gather
togidder the kingis of the earth in greit multitudis like the sandis of the
sea, and by concurrence, or at leist the tollerance of that other greit awowit
enemy he sall with their numbers compass the oampis of the faithful, beseage
the belouit city, make weir against the saintis: bot victory sall he not have,
The Pape (...) Antichrist, and Paperie ye lowsing of Satan, s^^ quhom proceidis
f^ doctrine, and cruelty to subvert ye kingdom of Christ.
and shame and confusioun sall be his and all his partakeris end. Now quhither
the Pape beiris their markis or not, let any indifferent man judge: I think
surely it exponis the self: Dois he not usurp Christis office calling him
self universal bishop, and heid of the kirk: Playis he not ye part of Apollyon
and Abaddon the king of the locustis and destroyer or sone of perditioun, in
chopping and changing saulis betuixt hewin, hell, and fantastic purgatory at
his pleasour: Blasphemis he not in denying us to be saiff by ye imputatioun of
Christis justice. Mairouer hes he not send forth and abusie ye world with
innumerable ordouris of locustis and shave lingis. Hes he not sa fully impyrit
over ye world their money hundredth eiris as to ye fire eid he, quhat sumeuer he
was, yat durst deny any part of his vsurpit supremacy: And hes he not of lait
dayis seeing his kingdom going to decay, send out the Iesuitis, his last and
may pernicious vermin, to steir up the Princes of the earth his slauis, to
gather and league them selfis togidder for his defense, and rooting out of all
them that profess^s Christ trewlie. And quhairas ye awowed enemy of God ye
Turk was under bloody weiris with him ever befoir, is their not of sait ane
trewis amaugis them, that the faithful may be mair easily rooted out. And ar
nocht presently ye armies amassit, ea upon ye very point of their executioun:
In France against the saintis their: In Flanders for the like: and in Germany,
be quhom alreddie ye Bischop of Colley ne is displacit: And quhat is preparit
and cum fordwart against this I Will: Do we not daily heir: and be all appearance
shortly sall see: Now may e judge gif this be not ye time quhairof this place
that I have maid chois of does mean, and sa ye dew time for the reueiling of
this prophecy. This far for ye interpretatioun of the sentence.

The third part.
NOW I cum to the last part, quhat we may learn of this place, quhilk I will
shortly tuiche in few pointis and sa make end. And first of ye deuillis lowsing
be ye rising of ye Antichrist, for ye just punishment of ye unthankful world
haiting ye treuth and delyting in lies, and manifesting of his awin chosin that
stak to ye treuth: we have two thingis to note. Mannis sin p^^^ Gods justice
to lows Satan.
Ane for instructioun, that ye justice of God in respect of mannis falling
wilfully from ye treuth (as Paull sayis) justly did send to ye world the
greit abuser with efficacy of lies, asweill to tyrannize spirituallie over ye
conscience be heresy, as corporally over their bodyis be ye civil sword.
And thairfoir we man feir to fall from ye treuth reviled, and professed be us,
that we may be fry from ye like punishment. The other for our comfort,
Apostates sall p^r^^lie, constant christianes sall be crouned.
that yis tyranny of ye Antichrist sifting out ye caffe from ye corn, as our
Master sayis, sall tend to ye double condemnatioun of ye falleris bak, and to
ye double croun of glory to ye perseueireris. Blissit thairfoir ar they that
perseueir to ye end, Math. 10.^^
for they sall be saiff.

The defectioun under ye Antichrist sall be universal.
Nixt of ye number of natiounis in the four quarteris of ye earth deceived, and
companies gatherit togidder to fecht like the sand of ye sea: we are teachit
that ye defectioun under ye Antichrist was general, and sa na visible Kirk was
their: Quhairof two thingis followis. Ane, the Kirk may be corruptit and err:
Ane other, the Kirk may lurk and be unknown for ane certane space.

Thridlie of that that Satan is not coutentit only to deceive, except he also
gather to ye battle his instrumentis: Satan's children both deceive and
perse^^.
we are informit of ye implacable malice borne be Satan in his instrumentis
against God in his members, quha never reassis like ane roaring lyoun (as Peter
sayis) to go about assailleing to devour. This his malice is notably descriuit
in ye 12 and 13 chap. of this buik: for it is said that quhen he had spewed out
greit riueris of wateris, yat is, infinite heresies and lies to swallow up ye
woman, and notwithstanding sho was delyuerit thairfra: it agane he raisit up
ane beast out of ye sea, ye bloody Roman impyre be ye sword, to devour her
and her seid: and that being woundit deidlie, it he raisis ane other beast
forth of ye earth, quhilk is ye Antichrist, be heresy and sword toynit
togidder to do his turnis. Say Devil seeing that na mist of heresies can
obscure ye euangell in ye hartis of ye faithful, nather ye cruel sword of
persecuteris can stay ye prosperous succes of Christis kingdom he raisis up ye
Antichrist with both his swordis, to the effect that, as ane of them sayis,
that quhilk Peter's keyis culd nocht, Paul's sword sold. And so hes he done at
this time: For sen ye true Kirk will not be abusit with ye absurd heresies,
for last refuge, now rooted out most they be by ye civil sword.

Ferdlie of their greit numberis abill to compass about ye tentis of ye
saintis, and to beseage ye halie cities: The wickit i^ numbers ever ouerpasse
ye godly.
we are informed that ye wickit ar ever ye greitest part of ye world. And their
foir our Master sayis, Many ar callit, few chosin: and agane, Vyde is ye way
that leidis to destructioun, and many enter thairat: Bot narrow is ye way that
leidis to life, and few enter thairat. Also he callis them ye world, and the
Devil the Prince of ye same,

Fyftlie ye agreance of Gog and Magog, the Turk ye awowit enemy, and ye Pape
ye covered enemy, The wickit at variance amangis the^ self, can we ll agrie in
an^ against Christ.
to this persecutioun: declaris ye rooted haitred of ye wickit against ye
faithful: quha thocht they be vtherwayis in enimitie amangis them selfis, it
greis in that respect, in odium tertij, as did Herod and Pilate.

Sextlie the compassing of ye saintis, and beseaging of ye belouit city, The false Kirk over perse^^tes.
declaris to us ane certane note af ane falls Kirk to be persecutioun. For they
cum to seik ye faithful: the faithful ar these that are socht. The wickit ar ye
beseageris: the faithful ye beseagit.

Scripture be scripture fuld be exponed.
Seuintlie in ye form of language and phrase of speaking of fire cumming down
from heauin heir vsit, and takin out of ye buik of ye Kingis, ^. Reg. 1.10, 11
quhair at Elias prayeris with fire from heauin were destroyit Achazias
souldiouris: as ye greitest part of all ye wordis, versis, and sentences of
this buik ar takin and borrowit out of other partis of ye scripture: We are
teachit to use only scripture for iuterpretatioun of scripture, gif we wald be
suir and never waver from ye analogy of faith in expositioun: sense it
repeitis sa often ye awin phrases, and yair^y exponis them.

The wickit prevail not for ever, bot perish in ye top of their ^ourse.
Auchtlie of the last part of ye confusioun of ye wickit, euin at ye top of
their heicht and quheill, we have two thingis to note. Ane, that God althocht
he suffer ye wickit to rinne on quhisl their coupe be full: it in end strykis
he them, first in this world, and nixt in ye world to cum, to ye delyuerance of
his Kirk in this world, and perpetual glory of ye samur in ye world to cum.
The other note is, that after ye greit persecutioun and destructioun of ye
perseweris sall ye day of judgment follow. For sa declaris ye 11 verse of ye
same chaptour. Bot in how short space it fall follow, that is only knawin unto
God. Only this far ar we certane, that in that last estait without any ma
general mutatiounis ye world sall remane till ye consummatioun.

To conclude then with exhortatioun: It is all our duties in this I Will at yis
time to do two thingis. All men should be lawfully ina^med spiritualite and
bodelie to seekt against ye Antichrist and his su^^ostes.
Ane, to considder our estait: Another, to conform our actiounis according
thairunto. Our estait is, we are thrtefaldlie beseagit, First spirituallie be ye
heresies of ye Antichrist. Secundlie corporally and generally, as memberis of
that Kirk ye quhilk in haill they persecute. Thridlie corporally and
particularly be yis present armse. Our ^ctiounis then conformed to our estait
at shes: First to call for help at Goddis handis: Nixt to assure us of ye same,
seeing we have ane sufficient warrant, his constant promeis expressed in his
word. Thridlie sense. with guide conscience we may, being in ye tentis of ye
saintis and belouit city, stand in our defense Encourage ane another to use
lawful resistance, and concur ane with another as warriouris in ane camp and
citizenis of ane belouit city, for mantenance of ye guide cause God hes cled us
with, and defense of our liberties, native country, and lyfes. For sense we
see God hes promisit not only in ye world to cum, bot also in this world to
give us victory over them, Let us in assurance heir of strongly trust in our
God, Cease tomistrust his promeis, and fall through incredulity. For then ar
we worthy of double punishment. For the stronger they wax, and ye neirer they
cum to their hicht, the faster approchls their wrak, and the day of our
delyuerie. For kind and loving, true and constant, cairfull and walkryfe,
michtie and revenging is he that promisis it: quhom to be praise and glory for
ever.

AMEN.
