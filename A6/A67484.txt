A STILL AND SOFT VOICE From the Scriptures, Witnessing them to be the Word
of God.

1 Kings. 19.11.12. And he said (to Eliah) come out and stand upon the Mount
before the Lord. And behold the Lord went by, and a mighty strong wind rent the
Mountains and brake the Rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the
wind, and after the wind came an Earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
Earthquake.

And after the Earthquake came fire, but the Lord was not in the fire, and
after the fire came a still and soft voice. And when Eliah heard it, he covered
his face with a Mantle, etc.

Printed in the Year, 1647.

A Still and Soft Voice.
A She who is arrived to the full age of a man, and seriously considers, the
several passages and progress of his fore past life: what he did or
understood, when he was a child, a youth, a young man; a mere man, or before
he came to be advised, and to consider all things by true rules of reason: is
best able to deal with every one in every age and condition, to show them
their vanity, ignorance and mistakings: and to point them out the path of
virtue. Experience making the best Schoolmasters in things natural and moral.

Even so is it in Religion, he only can best judge, advise and counsel others,
who has observed and most seriously considered the several passages and
progress of his own knowledge in things divine: yet who are so forward to
judge and comptrole therein, as mere smatterers and such as have least
experience.

I suppose it will be acknowledged, by ail experienced Christians, that the
greatest number of men and women in the world, are drawn into the
consideration and Practice of Religion, by education, and custom of the place
where they are bred: and that many never have any other foundation, nor motive
to continue therein, then the reputation it brings them: all other religions or
ways of worship being discountenanced and out of credit such as these are
Champions for what is in fashion: ever running with the stream, and crying down
all contrary minded; Vox populi, Vox dei, the Major voice (then which nothing
is more uncertain in Religion) is to these as the voice of God: and when they
are zealous for vulgar opinions they think they are zealous for God and his
truth: when they revile, abuse, and hale men before the Magistrates, and even
kill and destroy them, they think they do God good service: being zealous of
the traditions of the times: for though truth should be publicly professed:
yet to such as hold it only by education and custom: it is in them
traditionall, and they are not truly religious; but mere morrall christians:
utterly ignorrant of the clear Heavenly brightness, inherent, in pure and
undefiled Religion.

But though it be evident, that there are too too many, who hold their
religion, on this frail foundation, yet it is very comfortable to behold, the
sincerity of multitudes of good people in our days: who; not content to
possess their knowledge in a traditionall way: do accustom themselves to try
and examine all things.

Yet as it is a hard thing unto men, bred so vainly as most men are, to keep
the golden mean, in natural or morrall Reformations: so is it difficult to
preserve from extremes, in matters of religion, the reason is, because in our
trials and examinations we have not that heedfull care, which is absolutely
necessary, to free our Judgments from absurdityes or improper things: common
and uvlgar arguments catching fast hold upon us too suddenly; and so we engage
over violently, averring and maintayning without giving due time to our
consideration to work and debate it self into necessary conclusions.

The first sort of these religious persons: are deadly enemies to examination
and trial of things, we (say they) are not fit to Judge or these matters ne
suitor ultra crepidam, is commonly in their mouths: the Cobbler ought not to go
beyond his last: what are the learned for, if these high things fall within the
compass of our capacities, why choose we wise and juditious men, more able
then our selves, but to reform, and settle Religion: if you draw them into any
discourse, and endeavor to show them their weakness, their only aim is how
to entrap you, in your words, and if it be possible to make you obnoctious to
authority.

If their ignorance and superstition appear so gross and palpable, that (in
loving terms, and for their better information,) you demand how they come to
know there is a God, or that the scriptures are the word of God: their common
answer is, do you deny them: it seems you do? otherwise why do you ask
such questions? if they offer to prove by some common received argument: and
you show the weakness thereof: they will go nigh to tell you to your face, and
report for certain behind your back, to all they know, or can know, that you
are an Athiest, that you deny there is a God, and deny the Scriptures to be the
word of God: nor do they hate any sort of men so much, as those who are
inquisitive after knowledge; judgeing them as busy bodies, men of unquiet
spirits, that know not when they are well, or when they have sufficient: for
their parts, they are constant in one, for the substance; their principles are
not of yesterday but of many years standing: and the most learned and wise are
of their way, and why should not others be as well content as they, is it fit
(say they) that every one should follw his own understanding in the worship of
God, we see what comes of it; when men once forsake the beaten Road (the Kings
high way) in Religion, into how many by-pathes, do they run, nay, whether
would they not run, if our care were not to hedge and keep them in.

And thus ignorance becomes many times Judge of knowledge: and the most gross
and slothful; comptroler of the most active in Religion.

Of this sort of men there are very many; and they are made very much use of by
worldly Pollititians, who have found by constant experience, that superstition
is the easiest means to lead a multitude, this way, or that way as their
occasions and purposes may require, and on the contrary, that true Religion is
in it self as oppsite to their unjust ends, as it is to superstition and
therefore if they observe any man who out of the principles of true Religion
opposes their ends; at him they let loose these ignorant and morrall
christians, furnish them with reproachful tales, and falsehoods, against him,
call him Athiest Infidel, Heritick, Scismatick, any thing: which is as eagerly
effected, as wickedly devised: and how to stop these men's mouths is in my
apprehention no less a work then to make white a Blackamore;

Those others who are startled in their consciences, and roused by the word of
God, out of this worldly way of religion, or running with the stream, it is a
hard matter to hold them to a due pace, in the persute of necessary knowledge
or to keep them to a propper Method, or to obtain this of them, that they
receive nothing as a truth, which they see admiteth of an obsurdity.

But having broke loose from the bands of educated and customary religion,
through necessity of conscience, and being anew to begin, they are apt hastily
to take in, that which is first offered with any resemblance of truth, and so
in an instant, fall into new entanglements.

For if have, make wast in any thing, it is in pursuit after knowledge: and
though every considerate man's experience finds this a truth: though it be
confessed by all, that there is nothing of greater concernment to man, then the
truth of his Divine knowledge: though nothing does more disturb the mind of
man, then error and mistakeing in religion.

Yet is there not any thing wherein men: proceed more irregularly, or more
impatiently: either they are over rash and sudden or over fearful, and
irresolute: they approach all discourse with prejudice, and a mind distempered,
searching nothing thoroughly or orderly, but content themselves with an overly
examination, and (in my apprehention) are not so difingenious in any thing, as
in religion: willingly resigning and forfeiting their understandings, and
Judgments, at a cheap rate then Esau did his Birthright: and so continue very
long (not truly religious, (...) but) superstitious men, always amazed:
neither remembering what themselves or others speak: he that once opposes
them, has a Wolf by the ears, he can neither speak, nor hold his peace,
without damage, they take allthings in the worst sense sigh, lament, pity, or
censure, all that suits not with their opinion or practice: and talk or report
of, any man, any thing that comes in their imaginations; those that come behind
them in knowledge; are carnal: those before them desperate And therefore it
may be very profitable; that the differences between true Religion and
superstition, be made known to these times, more fully than it is, the one
being commonly taken for the other.

Now both are best known by their effects: for true Religion setleth a man in
peace and rest: makes him like unto the Angels, always praising God and saying
Glory to God on High, in earth peace, Good will toward men, it is ever
provided with good intentions and good desires, makes the best construction in
doubtful cases, see how true Christian love is described by the Apostle in the
13. to the Corinths. and that is the true Religious man's Character.

On the contrary, superstition troubles and makes a man wild, a superstitious
man suffers neither God nor man to live in peace, (as one well observes from
experience) he aprehendeth God, as one anxious, spiteful, hardly contented
easily moved, with difficulty appeased, examining our actions after the human
fashion of a severe Judge, that watches our steps, which he prooveth true by
his manner of serving him. he trembles for fear is never secure, fearing he
never does well, and that he has left some thing undone, by omission whereof,
all is worth nothing that he has done.

But generally now a days, (contrary to former times) the superstitious man's
devotion costs him little, he has so much worldly wit in his zeal, as to save
his purse, hot and fiery against heresy and blasphemy, (which are titles he
freely bestows on all opinions, contrary to his own, true or false), he will
course his poor neighbor out of all he has, yea out of the Nation, if he can
not course him into his opinion: and all upon pretense of doing God service and
for the good of his soul.

As for his body, or estate, that's no part of his care, he is not so hasty to
runn into his poor neighbors house, to see what is wanting there, he may ly
upon a bed, or no bed, covering or no covering, be starved through cold and
hunger. over burdened with labor, be sick, lame or diseased: and all this
troubles not the superstitious man's (nor the moral Christians) Conscience: he
may through want and necessity go into what prison he will, and ly and rott
and starve there: and these kind of Religious people are not half so much
moved at it, as if he go to another Church or congregation, then what they
approove: if he do so, upstarts their zeal; and after him, watch, spy,
accuse and inform: and all for the good of his soul: and for the Glory of God.

One would not think it were possible man could be so blind, or so
inconsiderate as to immagin, that God would be thus mocked, thus madly served,
contrary to the whole tenor of the Scriptures, but such are the effects of
educated, customary or superstitious Religion.

Whist the effects of pure and undefiled Religion, are another thing: as
Feeding the hungry, Clothing the naked, Visiting the sick, the Fatherless,
the Widows and Prisoners: and in all things walking as becomes the Gospel
of Christ: it will empty the fullest Baggs: and pluck down the highest plumes.

And who ever serves God sincerely in this Religion, shall be known by his
fruits: his light shall so shine before men, that they seeing his good Works,
shall Glorify our Father which is in heaven.

But of these there are few to be found; and as few that truly labor, to
reclaim those many thousands of miserable people that are drencht all their
life long in gross ignorance, and notorious loathsome wickedness: Yet there
is joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more then for ninety nine just
persons that need no repentance: Why talk we so much of Christianity,
holiness, and saintship, whilst we neglect the lost sheep, or the recovery of
our brethren from those Errors of their ways.

The plain truth is, this gross neglect of known duty herein, and the general
eagerness in the less necessary parts of zeal and devotion, manifests the
world is not subdued; that there is little self-denial, little of pure and
undefiled Religion as yet in the world: men content themselves with forms of
godliness, but are regardlesse of the power thereof.

And therefore I have been the less troubled in my self; for the hard measure
I have found: amidst so great a mixture of worldliness, ignorance, and
superstitious zeal, why should one look for much ingenuity, these times have
but cast an eye toward the material parts of true Christianity: It is not yet
known what it is, in its excellency, the end and issue thereof, is too good to
be deserved, or discerned, by a people that are not yet broad awake, they
strike him that brings them more light; then they can well endure.

All the evil and reproach I have suffered, has been by occasion of my
forwardness to do others good: my freeness in discourse, though harmless in
it self, and intended for good, has been perverted, misconstrued, and made
use of to my prejudice.

I account nothing more vain, then to discourse merely for discourse sake, nay,
it is painful and ircksome to me, to hear a discourse that is not really
necessary and useful, nor do I know, that I have ever purposely set my self
to debate any serious matter, slightly or carelessely, though cheerfully.

And my manner is, what ever is in debate, to search it thoroughly, being of an
opinion, that, what is really true, stands the firmer, for being shaken: like a
house that is built upon a rock.

I have been much troubled, to observe men earnestly engage to maintain the
strongest maxims and principle by weak arguments; the weakness whereof, I
have endeavored to manifest, that I might discover the weakness of such
practices, and to make it evident, that fundamental truths support all
things, and need no supporters: Thou bear not the root, but the root, thee.

But this my free dealing (with uncharitable or superstitious people) has
found this evil return, they have reported me, to deny that there is a God,
when I have only denied the validity of a weak argument, produced to prove that
there is a God; it being too too common to insist upon mere notionall
indigested arguments: so also have I been most uncharitably slandered to deny
the Scriptures to be the word of God, because I have opposed insufficient
arguments produced to prove them such: and because at the same time I have
refused to show the grounds inducing me to believe them.

Now it has been my lot to be drawn into discourses of this nature for the
most part by timorous, scrupulous, people, in whom, I have discouvered so much
impatience, and discerned content, at the shaking of their arguments, that I
have not discerned any reason to open my self ac that time; yet I never parted
with any of them, but I always prosessed that I did believe, both that there
is a God, and that the Scriptures are the Word of God, though I judged their
grounds not good; and withal, that if they would be so ingenious as to
acknowledge the weakness of their arguments, I would then show them my ground
of faith; or it at any time they stood in need, I would not be wanting to the
uttermost of my power to supply them, but I have seldom found any, who in the
heat of contest and prosecudon of dispute, have been qualified, to receive,
what I had to say, touching this matter, their apprehension and mine being at
too great a distance therein.

But I bless God it is not so ill with me, as some bad minded men desire, nor
as some weak and scrupulous men imagine.

And there are some ingenious men, with whom I have daily converst, that know I
do acknowledge and believe there is a God. and that the Scriptures are the
Word of God.

Yet the testimony of men in this case to me is little; my own conscience
being as a thousand witnesses.

That there is a God: I did never believe through any convincing power I have
ever discerned by my utmost consideration of any natural argument or reason I
ever heard or read: But it is an unexpressible power, that in a forcible manner
constraines my understanding to acknowledge and believe that there is a God,
and so to believe that I am fully persuaded there is no consider at man in the
world but does believe there is a God.

And, That the. Scriptures are the Word of God, I shall clearly make the same
profession, That I have not believed them so to be, by force of any argument I
have ever heard or read, I rather find by experience, most, if not all
arguments, produced in prejudice thereof: (Art, argument, and compulsive power,
in this case holding resemblance with the mighty strong wind, the Earth quake
and fire, distracting, terrifying and scorching the minds of men) but I believe
them through an irresistible perswafive power that from within them (like unto
the soft still voice wherein God was) has pierced my judgment and affection in
such sort, that with abundance of joy and gladness I believe, and in
believing have that Peace which passes all utterance or expression; and which
has appeared unto me after so many sad conflicts of adistracted conscience,
and wounded spirit, that it is to me a heaven upon earth: It being now long
since, I bless God, that I can truly say, My heart is fixed, O God, my heart
is fixed, I will sing and give praise: In other respects, I conceive the most
holy upon earth, if they give impartial ear to this voice, will find no
cause to boast or to find fault with others, but as Eliah to cover their faces
with a mantle.

And truly were it not that too too many pretenders to Religion, are over apt
to receive false reports (which is a most uncharitable disposition) and
over-prone to make the worst construction, which is altogether unchristian, it
had been impossible for any to have abused me in these or any other respects.

But it will be neefull for all such, seriously to lay to heart, that they
ought to do as they would he done unto in all things that he who seems to be
religious and bridles not his tongue, that man's religion is vain.

That he who boasts to believe a God, and the Scriptures to be the Word of
God, and glories in his ability of exposition thereof: yet applies it to the
discovery of a mote in his brothers eye, rather then a became in his own: he
whose expressions and actions do demonstrate him to say within himself, Lord I
thank thee I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust adulterers, nor as this
Publican: This man whoever he be, is not yet got through the lesson of the
Pharistes; that were wise in their own eyes, and despised others.

But it would be much more profitable to society and good neighborhood that
there were a more exact account taken by every man of his own ways; it is
verily thought most men need not go abroad for want of work, if either pride,
covetousnesle, backbiting, unreasonable jealosy, vanity of mind, dotage upon
superfluities? with hard heartedness to the poor: were thought worthy of
Reformation.

To be zealous in lipp service, or to express our devotion, in censuring of
others, yields neither honor to God, nor good to man.

Who were more blind, then those who said are we blind, also? the Angel of
the Church of Laodicea, boasted that he was rich, and increased with goods and
had need of nothing: and knew not that he was wretched, and misserable and
poor and blind and naked.

We have many now a days, who are doubly unjust and think not of it: they
are partial and favorable in examining and corecting of themselves: and
severe toward others, when as they ought to be severe toward themselves: and
favorable toward others.

And it is a fault not easily mended: it requires agreater power of true
religion to do it, then the most have as yet attained, if one may judge by the
Fruits: and therefore it will be good for every one to neglect that which is
behind, and to press forward to the mark, for the price of the high Calling
of God which is in Jesus Christ: either renounce the Name, or let your practice
demonstrate, that you are Christian.

He who greedily receives a hard report of his neighbor, is not provided of
charitable and loving thoughts as he ought; and if he report any evil, before
he be certain of the truth thereof, he is a sladerer; and when he is
certain it is true, he report it with delight, it argues him of malice.

He who is glad of his neighbors defamation, would not be sorry at his ruin: a
slanderer would be a murderer but for fear: and therefore, every honest
virtuous religious man should shun a slanderer, as he would shun a Serpent.

And thus having said enough to free my self from this slander (if religious
people will but study ingenuity, which has Been too much wanting amongst them)
the whole course of my actions, writings and discourses, evidencing the
contrary to all that thoroughly know me: and this my profession being added to
satisfy those that know me but by hearsay: I have done: judging it a small
thing to be judged of any, or of man's judgment: Whoart thou that judge
another man's servant, t o his own master, he stands or falls.

The liberty of my native Country, and the freedom of all conscientious people
has been, and still is precious in my esteem: nor shall I be discouraged (by
any the unworthy slanders cast upon me) from a just and due prosecution of
both, according to my place and calling: I shall make bold to deceive the
deceiver and his instruments therein: I should be glad to see the Educated and
customary moral Christians become Christians indeed, and cease to persecute: I
should exceedingly rejoice to see the superstirious, become really religious,
and to see babes; become strong men in Christ, and all bend their endeavors to
deliver the captive, and set the oppressed free, to reclaim the vicious, and
to labor the saving of the lost sheep of the house of England: To see Charity
abound, and all envy, malice, and worldly mindedness to cease for ever, and
not to be named amongst us, as becomes Saints indeed: to see all men
ingenious, loving, friendly and tenderhearted one toward another: but I must
neither be silent, nor slothful till I see it, nor sorrow as one without out
hope of seeing it: but through evil report, and good report, do my duty?
patiently expecting a good issue? laboring in all estates to be content;
knowing there is no temptation has taken hold upon others, but may befall unto
me. In the mean time, knowing all terrestrial things to be but vain and
transitory, my chiefest comfort is, that I desire to know Nothing save Jesus
Christ and him crucified: accounting all things as loss and dung, that I may
be found in Christ, not having my own righteousness which is of the Law, but
the righteousness which is of God in him.

I have no quarrel to any man, either for unbeleefe or misbeleefe, because I
judge no man believes any thing, but what he cannot choose but believe; it is
misery enough to want the comfort of true believing, and I judge the most
convincing argument that any man can hold forth unto another, to prove himself
a true sincere believer, is to practice to the uttermost that which his faith
binds him unto: more of the deeds of Christians, and fewer of the arguments
would do a great deal more good to the establishing of those that stagger: It
being not the leaves but the fruit that nourishes and carries the seed with
it, Show me thy faith by thy works; If I have all faith and have not love, I
am as sounding brass, or as a tinckling cymball, if faith work, it works by
love: Let us all therefore henceforth walk in love, even as Christ has loved,
and has given himself an offering and a sacrifice for us: to whom be glory
and dominion for ever. Amen.
