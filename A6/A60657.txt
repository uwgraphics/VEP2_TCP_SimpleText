Sweet Oil Poured forth through the Horn of Salvation, And is Freely sent
abroad to search the Wounded Spirits, and to relieve the weak and feeble
Travelers.
THere is a Day of sore Travel into which many come after their faces be turned
toward the Lord; and many have therein walked in sore pain, and have been
tossed and driven about in much weariness, that they have been brought into
such feebleness, and weakness, as has caused them to sit down in deep
mourning, and bitter Lamentation, and in that time of weakness and weariness
the enemy has strongly wrought to draw them into Desperation, and so cause
them to cease from hoping; and as the light has opened and brought up their
sins before them, and the stroke of the Lord has been upon them, and his hand
correcting them, then has the Enemy as a deceitful worker been near to present
the greatness of their sins unto them, and when they have so appeared, and
they have seen them stand up as a mountain before them, and also the multitude
of them compassing about their heels, then has the Enemy labored to be^^t a
persuasion in them of the impossibility of ever getting over ^^m or to be set
free from amongst them, and in this persuasion he has sunk them, and cast them
into the depth of Sorrow; and then have told them that they have sinned beyond
mercy, and there has he bound down their hands that they have not been able to
lift them up toward the Mercy Seat; and when some breathings have gone forth
that panted after the Mercy and could not live without it, his Dominion has
been over it, and he has presently quenched it, and has told them*that Mercy
could not be their portion, neither was it to any purpose for them to wait for
it, or to have any expectation after it: and unto this dark persuasion did many
tender people incline, and when the Enemy had entered them with it, then he
cast them upon a bed of Sorrow, Grief and Pain, where they have roared for the
very disquietnesse of their hearts, and they have looked at themselves to be
the worst of people, and none whose condition was so bad as theirs; and in the
depth of this misery their lives have been a burden to them, and they have been
weary of their lives, then has he cast out a flood of violence toward them,
and strongly tempted them to shorten their days, by destroying their own
lives, and has told them their days were but pain and grief, and it would be
better for them to cut their days short, than to prolong them in such misery
and sorrow, and in this state they have been in the midst of flames, and the
very terror of Hell has been upon them, and in the belly of it they have been
closed, and there have cried and roared without ceasing, their Torment has
been so exceeding great upon them; and as the cry has risen and the breathings
of it gone unto the Lord, Even so has his Ear been open, and from his dwelling
place he has heard, and with his secret hand in the bottom he has supported
them, so that they have not sunk though the Enemy has wrought in his fury, and
though little acquaintance there has been with that which has supported, yet
it has caused many times a little faith to spring, and a small hope to arise,
whereby they have been kept and have not fainted; then there has been a simple
breathing after the Lord, and a little trust in him, that he would not utterly
cast off, but that he would arise in his mercy, and give them strength to
overcome; and that he would deliver them out of that deep misery wherein they
were plunging, and in this cry and simple breathing after the God of Mercy, the
little Faith and Hope has received some strength, and has been still
springing, and secretly working underneath for freedom, which the Enemy
perceiving, and knowing that he could not prevail against it, but that it would
overturn him, if he kept that ground, he in his subtilty has presently changed
his appearance, and has let fall his Temptation unto Desperation and
Destruction, and like a deceitful worker has come upon them to draw them forth
to look after something that might comfort them; and being in sore distress
and misery, there has been a readiness to join unto that which might tender
any comfort, and to pursue that Stream with eagerness; so that suddenly he
has got their minds abroad, and then has presented the beauty of Professions,
with the Excellency of Preaching, and Praying, and Family Duties, and also many
faithful Promises, which in the Scriptures they might behold and see, which
would be comfortable unto their present conditions, and then has he wrought a
persuasion in their minds, that by diligently attending these things, and
waiting in them as means, there would be comfort found and strength given, and
they would thereby come to obtain joy, for the day of their long mourning; and
this seeming a fair thing unto that eye which was got abroad, and also appeared
to be a pleasant way, and nothing that they were to lose or part withal to
obtain it, but to part with their misery and come into it for comfort, they
presently joined, and with great diligence and carefulness observed those
things which seemed most excellent; and when the enemy had thus far prevailed,
and with his subtilty drawn the minds into the things that do appear, then did
he labor to cause them to suck the breast of it, and persuaded them that
consolation and satisfaction was in it, and here he has driven them about with
the diverse and strange doctrines which in his cunning craftiness he has spread
abroad, from which they have been drawing something, and have applied it for
healing, and so they have been taking words, and getting words and applying
words, but have neglected the fountain of healing, and the enemy has perverted
Preaching, and Praying, and Family Duties, and faithful Promises, and so have
drawn the mind after the words, and to apply the words out of the power, and
people have committed the two great evils, in forsaking the virtue of the
healing Fountain, and going after that which has no healing virtue in it; and
though they have long run after this stream, and have been applying it for
healing, yet the wound is not cured, nor that satisfied which cried in the
pain, but is still in sore travel though the enemy has lift up the mind above
it in a false joy through the conceitedness of remedy received, and under this
which has been applied for relief, the innocent crying life is mourning for
want of relief.

Oh! what Cries, what Tears, what Sorrow, what Mourning, what Bitterness, what
Pain, what Anguish and Travel has been upon thousands; how Mighty, how
Powerful, how Dreadful and Terrible has been the appearance of the Lord God in
this his day, for the Redemption and freedom of his dear Seed; But how
Subtly, how Deceitfully, how Cunningly, how Craftily, and Wickedly has the
power of darkness wrought to keep it in-bondage; so that when the Lord God has
brought people down with his correcting hand, how then has the enemy wrought
to sink them into Desperation, and when the Lord has appeared for them in that
state, and by his secret hand underneath has supported them, and has been
giving strength to the little faith and hope that has been quickened, which the
Devil could not destroy, how then has he labored to get away the mind from
the hand that Corrected and Wounded, that they might not there abide, least
they should be converted and healed, and thus has he deceived by his cunning
craftiness, where he lies secretly lurking, and has beguiled people with his
false tenders, and deceitful applications, and thereby has betrayed their
life, and strangled the pure breathings of the little innocence, that once was
springing and striving after freedom, so that the little Faith is gone and the
Hope is well nigh lost, and the pure Creation yet lies in bondage, and travels
in pain until now; And this testimony has a witness in the consciences of many
tender people this day, who have traveled and been sore pained and yet are not
delivered but lie mourning, notwithstanding they have diligently observed the
divised ways of the old Serpent, and have not been slack in running after the
chiefest doctrines that have issued forth from the fountains of men, and have
also been diligent to apply the choicest of their streams, but no cure have
they found, nor no healing medicine have they yet received, neither have
attained to the rest and peace that the Seed travels to inherit and possess,
but unto this day they are under the corecting hand of the Lord God, and feel
his stroke upon them that many times opens their wounds afresh, so that it is
sharp for them to endure, and heavy for them to bear, and though they be lift
up and stand over the hand, yet does it not cease correcting, but reaches unto
them, and many times brings them down and makes their beauty to consume away.
Oh! dear people of all names and professions, whither have you run? And after
what have you been seeking? The cry has been right, but your way has been
wrong, and the stroke of God yet pursues you and pierces your very hearts, and
your pain is yet within your bowels. Oh you pierce him, you pierce him, and you
must mourn because of him; his innocence is sore burdened, his pure life is
pressed, the treacherous enemy works above him, and he has drawn you into
his deceiveable way, which causes trouble yet to abide upon you; Oh what have
you been doing? And for what have you been spending your money? You have
labored but have not reaped; you have run, but not obtained; you have sought
but are not yet relieved; you have been betrayed by those you have trusted, and
unskilful Physicians have had you under hand, they have not known your grief,
so could not give a healing remedy; your trouble has been Within, and they
have drawn you to look for remedy Without, and there have prolonged your days
in the sorrow, and your years in heaviness, and yet pain is yet upon you, and
you are not eased, and your grief does still abide, and you are not relieved.
Now unto you all does the bowels of love open, and true tenderness flows forth
to the desolate in you, that it may be relieved and comforted, for it has long
been grieved and pained, and many of you have been sore afflicted, and have not
understood the ground of your misery, neither has clearly known where to find
a remedy. This therefore is for your information, that you may come to be
sensible of your present conditions, and so see what you are in your selves,
and what you have need of from another; and before this you can know, you must
come to the light of Christ in your own consciences, and you must wait in it,
and then will you see what you are, and your poverty and weakness will be made
manifest unto you, and your weakness and miserableness will be opened in your
own hearts, and you will plainly see that of your selves you can do nothing,
but must forever lie in your misery without the Lord appear for you in his
mercy, and bring in healing to your wounded spirits, and this will bring you
into a true waiting for the appearance of Christ in you, that the wound which
is within you may in the healing virtue of the life of Christ be bound up and
cured; so will you feel the hand that smites you the same hand to bind you up,
and the same hand that wounds you, the same hand to heal you; for as it bears
the Rod for Correction, so does it also bear the Oil for healing; for the Lord
wounds and he heals, he smites, and he also binds up; therefore do not thou fly
from that which smites thee, but sink down to it, and lie down under it, and it
will take away that which it does correct thee for, and purge out that which
causes thy wound and sore affl^ction, and keeps thee in the separation from
the Lord God; So as thou feelst thy wound within thee, and all thy trouble and
pain, and grief to be there, thou must wait to feel the healing spring where
the wound is, and then will the healing reach it, and search it to the bottom,
and bring out all the corruption before it, and work the cure perfectly, and
make thee a sound man, and a perfect man, without either bruise, or wound, or
putrified sore; and if thou will not come to this, thou can not be made
perfectly whole; for there is not another fountain for healing, neither is
there any other remedy to cure a wounded Spirit, or to take away grief, and
pain, and sorrow, which lies upon the Conscience, but the pure life of Christ,
in which is the blood of cleansing, and the Oil of gladness; Therefore hither
turn, and stand open to receive thy remedy, for thou art smitten within, and
there is thy grief, and thou must know the hand within to bind thee up, before
thou be healed and comforted; and as thou come into stillnesse thou will feel
the work of it, and the healing and binding up in it, so thou will not need to
run abroad any more to seek a Physician, but thou will know him to be near
thee, and a Physician of value to thee, and he will remove all that which has
stopped the flowings of his healing virtue from thee, and will cause the well
of water to spring up in thee, that thou therein may bathe, wash, and be
cleansed; so no putrefaction or corruption will lodge within thee, nor any
grief, or anguish, or pain, will be continued upon thee, but thou will be
brought forth through the washing of regeneration, a freeborn Heir of God, and
a joint Heir with Christ of the everlasting Kingdom into which no unclean thing
must enter; and this is unto all People, Kindreds, Tongues, and Languages; And
all you tender people who have been smitten and wounded, and have been running
after unskilful Physicians, and have not received any thing at their hands to
do you good, but have wearied your selves in sucking their fruitless fountain,
and now are come to see them all of no value, and are turned unto the light of
Christ in your own Consciences, and there are waiting to receive the droppings
of his healing virtue, take heed the enemy does not deceive you, for you will
feel him work sore upon you, and if he cannot cast you down, and cause you to
fall, he will then labor to lift you up, and get you over the Cross, and
exalt you above the Judgment, and so work a conceitednesse of the safety of
your present state; but you that are to the light turned, be you always
watchful to it, and in the power of it you will be preserved in safety, and
when Correction reaches you, embrace it cheerfully, for it is unto you as a
Son, and the love of the Father you will feel in it, and the droppings of the
healing virtue of life will fall into your wounds, and bring in joy and
gladness to you.

Oh come thou Traveller, thou Mourner, thou Feeble, thou Weary, thou weak, thou
wounded, be thou comforted in the Eternal love and life of God; for now is his
Fountain set wide, and the Horn of his Salvation is opened, the Oil is freely
powered forth, thou that art yet seeking, and thy cry is after saving health,
the Cup of Salvation for thee is filled, and in the hand of the Lord it is made
ready, he has beheld thy travel, and has seen the day of thy mourning, and
with Oil of joy and gladness will he now comfort thee, and with the healing
virtue of his pure life he will relieve thee, for unto thee is his mercy that
has mourned under all Physicians, and never could receive the Cup at their
hands, but has still waited to know his rising, in whose wings there is pure
healing; Oh be thou lift up thou poor in Spirit, for unto thee glad tidings
comes, thy wounds will be cured, thy feeble knees will be strengthened, thy
broken heart will be bound up, for he is come who is the saving health of all
Nations, his reward is with him, and unto thee he will give joy for mourning,
and the spirit of gladness for the spirit of heaviness, this will he do for
thee, and will not forsake thee; therefore keep thou Judgment over the head of
the enemy, that neither his heights nor his depths may prevail with thee, but
in the quietness do thou wait, and in the patience do thou rest, and Gods
searching hand will try thy wound, and fetch out that which has oppressed
thee, and power in fresh Oil to heal thee, and will bind thee up with cords of
love and mercy and make thee strong in his strength, and joyful in his
Salvation. Oh thou poor Mourner, unto thee is the Horn of Salvation powered
forth, the fresh Oil is for thy anointing, and the virtue of it for thy
healing; arise and be thou strong, and trample Satan under thy feet, for the
God of all mercy is with thee, and the Heir of Joy and Gladness he will make
thee, and a pure Crown of gold he will set upon thee, and in Dignity, Glory,
and Dominion will he establish thee for ever.
