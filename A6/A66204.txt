By the King,
A PROCLAMATION For a General FAST.
WILLIAM R.

FOR the Imploring a Blessing from Almighty God, upon His Majesty, and all His
Dominions, and for the Averting of those Judgments which our manifold Sins and
Provocations have most justly Deserved, The Kings most Excellent Majesty has
thought fit, and does (by the Advice of His Privy Council) hereby Appoint and
Command, That a General Fast, and Day of Solemn Humiliation be Kept and
Observed throughout His Majesty's Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town
of Berwick upon Tweed, in most Devout and Solemn Manner, on Wednesday the
Twenty eight Day of April next. And for the more orderly Solemnizing of the
same, His Majesty has given Directions to the Right Reverend the Bishops of
this Kingdom, to Compose a Form of Prayer Suitable to this Occasion, to be Used
in all Churches and Chapels, and other Places of Public Worship, and to take
Care for the timely Dispersing of the same through their several Dioceses in
the whole Kingdom. And His Majesty does strictly Charge and Command, That the
said Fastings and Prayers be Soberly, Reverently and Decently performed by all
His Loving Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon Pain
of such Punishments as can justly be inflicted upon all such as shall Contemn
or Neglect so Religious a Work.

Given at Our Court at Kensington the Eighteenth Day of March, 1696/^. In the
Ninth Year of Our Reign.
