AN Explicatory Catechism: OR, AN EXPLANATION OF THE ASSEMBLIES SHORTER
Catechism.

WHEREIN Those Principles are enlarged upon especially, which obviate the great
and growing Errors of Popery; useful for those Families that desire to hold
fast the Form of sound words.

Aug. lib. 15. de Trin. Cap. ult. Domine Deus, quaecunque dixi de tuo,
agnoscant and tui: Siqua de meo, and tu ignosce and tui. London, Printed for
Henry Mortlock at the Phoenix in St. Paul's Churchyard; and White-Hart in
Westminster Hall. 1675.

To the Christian Reader; especially Heads of Families.
THose Catechisms may very well be esteemed the best, which are Explanatory of
the Creed, ten Commandments and the Lords Prayer; because these Summaries or
Abstracts contain the Essentials of the true Religion, or those choice truths
which God would have us take extraordinary notice of in our course of reading
the holy Scriptures: And therefore those that begin with Catechizing, begin the
most easy and profitable way for any; because the weightier matters of the Law
are not hard to be understood, and such words being Spirit and Life, and the
very marrow of Christianity, must needs feed and nourish us up unto eternal
life. I have fixed my thoughts upon the Assemblies shorter Catechism, because
the Principles in it are mostly agreed upon by all sober intelligent
unprejudiced Protestant Divines. You have also something of the nature of the
two Covenants superadded to, or rather enlarged upon more particularly and
expressly than in the Catechism. And because Catechisms ought to contain nothing
but received truths, you have mostly the Explication of Ancient and Modern
Divines: And therefore, where you meet with any thing that is not so elaborate
and exact, you may conclude it mine, and not theirs. Hearing occasionally a
Discourse of a very learned and godly Divine out of Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7. [And these
words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart: And thou shall
teach them diligently unto thy Children, etc.] who recommended to Parents with
the greatest earnestness the work of Catechizing; I shall make bold to
transcribe a part of it, and offer it to public view. You shall have, 1. His
Reasons to prove that Parents ought diligently to Catechize or teach their
Children [Servants also included.] 2. His Answers to the Objections against it.
And 3. The Motives he laid down to provoke and stir up all Parents to this
necessary duty.

10. Reasons for the proof of it.

1. Every man ought to promote the Glory of God, to advance the Kingdom of
Christ, and to further the Salvation of others as far forth as they are able,
and have opportunity to it. And can we effect these any better way? We pray,
Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done: Surely the coming of
Christ's Kingdom into our hearts is one way of his Kingdom's coming.

2. God has set Parents in Authority over them, and they cannot improve it to
better purpose. This is the most ancient Government. Before there was King or
Commonwealth, there was Parental Government. This being most ancient,
afterward was the Priest and Prophet. God has laid a command upon Children to
obedience in the fifth Commandment, Ephesians. 6. 1. Only Dignity requires duty;
improve your authority for God, and use it to instruct your Household in the
Word of God. Do not think you have done, till you have done this.

3. Even nature it self dictates thus much. The Birds and Beasts of the field,
yea the Sea Monsters take care of their young ones. If you do nothing but feed
and cloth your Children, you do no more than Heathens, nay than brute beasts.
It Is said of the Ostrich, Job 39. 16. that she is hardened against her young
ones, as though they were not hers: And what do ignorant Parents less, who are
hardened against their own Children who are parts of themselves?

4. Children have Souls to be saved or damned, therefore some must take care of
them, and the soul that sins must die. We see Children die as well as Aged
persons. 2 Cor. 5. 10
In Golgatha there are Skulls of all sorts: Yea, do but look into the Register
of a Parish, and you shall see as many young as old have died in it. Children
may die, and what if they die without knowledge, in their sins? better were it
with those Children mentioned, 2 Kings 2. 23, 24. than these, Isa. 27. 11. 2
These. 1. 7, 8. Thus unchastised Children shall suffer; but the Parents shall
not go Scot-free. If you would have them profit by the public Ministry, you
must Catechize them at home. To bring them to the public before they be thus
Catechized, is setting before them an hard loaf. You must give them milk at
home, that they may be fit for higher truths in public.

5. Your Children are Children of wrath, and you have been instruments to
conveigh this to them. Psalm. 51. 1, 5
They die, and that proves this. When your Children are sick, you forthwith go
to the Physician, and will you take no care of their Souls, inheriting their
spiritual maladies from you? You may say as David to Abiathar, 1 Samuel 22. 22. I
have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy Fathers house.

6. What will become of Religion in future Ages, if Parents neglect this duty
at present? If all Parents were as careless as some, the Church of God would
soon cease on the earth, Isa. 38. 19. The Father to the Children shall make
known thy truth, Psalm. 78. 3, 4. Which we have heard and known, and our Fathers
have told us; We will not hide them from their Children, showing to the
Generation to come the praises of the Lord. If we do not teach our Children how
should they teach theirs? It was above two thousand years before the Scripture
was written; how then was piety preserved but by one Generation teaching
another? Adam taught his Children. The sacrificing of Cain, and Abel's piety
therein were both the fruit of Adam's teaching. Noah taught his Children to
Abraham, and he taught his household. Isa. 1. 9. Except the Lord of Hosts had
left unto us a very small Remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should
have been like unto Gomorrah: We should have been as Heathenish, as Paganish as
they.

7. God is highly pleased with piety in younger ones. The Lord had respect to
Abel the younger; and Enoch of all the Patriarchs before the Flood the
youngest, is said to please God. How was God pleased with the piety of Samuel
and Josiah? And we read of Jehojachin that began very young to Reign; and did
that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, 2 Kings 24. 8, 9. God takes
notice of the evil as well as the good. Children might sing Hosanna, Mat. 21.
15.
as well as cry bold-head, if they were taught. Jesus said, Mat. 19. 14. Suffer
little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven. Of such, not untaught Children.

8. You cannot expect the blessings of the Covenant, except y^u teach them the
C^mmandments of God Ps. 103. 17, 18. Dan. 9. 4.

9. Assure your selves, if you neglect this duty, God will require their blood
at your hands, Genesis 9. 5. with Acts 20. 26. It is here with Parents as with
Ministers; if you do not warn and teach them, God will require their blood at
your hands. Ezekiel. 3. 18.

Object. But teaching is the work of the Minister?

Answ. It is not only his, but yours; his in public, yours in your Families.

10. Sin and corruption is so inherent in Children in their nature, that all
the care of Ministers in public, and Parents at home will be little enough to
heal this plague of original corruption. Levit. 14. 41, etc.
This plague is like the Leprosy. There must be scraping, and if cleansing
will not do, there must be pulling down. So that you see all is little enough:
without teaching, your Children may perish, and you smart for it.

Object. 1. But Children may do well that are not thus carefully instructed.

Answ. 1. They may do well as to the outward man, they may prosper in the
world. God may cause his Sun to shine upon the unjust and the unthankful. But
Parents are to wish that their Children may do well as to the inward man, and
prosper in their Souls, as John for his friend Ga^us, 3 John 2.

2. They may perish eternally for want of Knowledge. Hos. 4. 6.

3. If some Children happen to come to good, no thanks to such careless
graceless Parents that neglect instruction at home.

Object. 2. But we have known them that have been taught well enough to have
made bad proof?

A. 1. This is too sadly true, to be denied; But the fault may be in one of the
Parents by their bad example: And Children as well as the conclusion in
syllogizing will follow the worse and weaker part; yet this is blameworthy in
Parents.

2. Good Parents have severely smarted for their neglect of strict Discipline
in their Families, and their over great fondness in cock^ring their Children,
as you may read in Eli and David. 1 Samuel 3. 13. 2 Samuel 13, and 14, and 15. 1
Kings 1. 6.

3. But if the Children of good Parents prove bad, this should make us more
diligent. If a Garden well weeded and kept down prove thus ill; Is this any
encouragement to sloth, but rather a spur to double diligence?

Two or three Motives to excite to the Duty of Catechizing.

Let it be remembered that you are not persuaded to invade the ministerial
office, or to become of this or that Opinion or Party, but to fall forthwith
upon the practice of a manifest, yet indispensable Duty.

1. How does the love of God dwell in your hearts, when they are hardened
against your Children? Simon, love thou me? then feed my Lambs. They are Gods
Children, and therefore you must bring them up in the ^^ture and admonition of
the Lord. The Children of any in Covenant with God are called his Children,
Ezekiel. 15. 21. When the woman of Samaria knew Christ, she desired that all her
Neighbors might also know him.

2. Are they not your Children? You shall diligently teach them to your
Children; they are bone of your hone, and flesh of your flesh. Are we to
instruct one another, and not our own Children?

3. What a comfort will this be to you, if you faithfully discharge this most
profitahle Duty! For,

1. Such Parents shall have joy of their Children, Prove. 23. 24. Ruth 4. 15.
David and Bath^sheba had much comfort of Solomon, which they had not of their
other Children.

2. You shall have spiritual rejoicing, 2 John 4.

3. You will gain a good evidence of the truth of grace in your hearts.

4. You that thus propagate piety shall sow good seed that will endure to many
Generations, Jer. 33. 18.

5. You may avoid many crosses and heartbreaking sorrows which negligent
Parents ordinarily meet with. Abraham taught his Children, and see what comfort
he had of them: He had a numerous Family 318. instructed Servants born in his
own house [ Genesis 14. 14.] and yet no disorder or disturbance there: He had a
numerous Family, and yet a peaceable Family.

1. Abraham Circumciseth Ishmael, Genesis 17.
and yet it was a painful Sacrament.

2. Isaac makes no opp^siti^n when to be made a sacrifice to the Will of God.
Genesis 22


3. Y^u have a religious Servant. Genesis 15, and 24.

4. At his death he gives what portions he pleases, and yet you find no
discord among them, Genesis 25. 5, 6. As you therefore desire peace in your
Families, and in after Generations, bring them up in the fear of the Lord.

On the contrary, you Parents that teach your Children Arts and Trades, and not
Gods Commandments; why, you are making way for your own cross and vexation;
what heartbreaking will they be to you! As,

1. In their matching. Prove. 17. 21, 25. G^n. 26. 34. 35.

2. Their sins will be put upon your score; and have you not sins enough of
your own?

3. Their perishing will be put upon your account. Oh what fretting and cursing
will there be at your meeting your Children in H^ll! Have you not heard of
Children that have cursed Parents upon the Gallows? Oh, when the Word of God
tells you that some evil will befall your Children, how should this trouble
you! As it was said of Jeroboam, that he made Israel to sin (for all that
succeeded pursued his sins) even so you, by your cursed ignorance, negligence
and sl^th may propagate sin and misery from Generation to Generation, to your
Children.

We are to look upon this duty as one of the prime Ordinances of divine
institution: there was Family teaching before there was any other teaching.
It Is the opinion of an eminent Divine, that more Children are seasoned with
grace by i^ste^ction of Pa^ents than by preaching. Towns are made up of
Families, and where they are wicked in Towns, Kingdoms cannot ^e righteous. Our
misery begins in bad Families. This duty of Catechizing therefore is of as
great weight, as any which is commanded in the word of God. Thus far he whose
name I shall conceal, because I have published it without his privity and
consent, though I hope not against his liking and approbation. If any of you
shall please dili^ently and impartially to examine Concord^nces, and most
Catechisms; you will soon find that the former do furnish us rather with sounds
than sense; and that in the latter, upon comparing the truths and the alleged
Texts together, there is so wide a distance, that you will the better perceive
the d^fficulty of our present undertaking (notwithstanding all the
forementioned helps) than at first, possibly, you have imagined. If you find
any pertinency of the Scriptures produced for confirmation of the truths they
refer unto in this Explication, I know it will be acceptable to you, and it is
no less than what I have endeavored after. If you epsy many proofs under any
Principle of Religion, it is either because that the truths there are more
weighty, or that the cavils against them are more than ordinary. If you
expected the Scriptures at large, the numerosity of them gives you the reason
against that.

I had once some thoughts of illustrating the mystery of the Trinity of
Persons, by some apt Figure or Resemblance, and of placing it in the Catechism;
but for the avoiding of all occasion of offense to the weak I have affixed it
here: And of all Figures, Keplers Circle seems most artificial and
correspondent with this glorious mystery.



IN this Scheme or Figure you have a Center, and a Circumference, and an Inter
space, and yet but one Circle: So that there are three Persons, and yet but one
God. These three are not divided; For it is not a Center, or Interspace,
separate from the Circumference: But these are distinguished in their
incommunicable properties in their order, and in their operation (upon a
supposition of motion) The Center is the beginning (as is easy to be observed
in drawing the Circle) the Circumference is a resultance from the Center alone,
the Interspace from the Center and the Circumference.

These are Coequal; the Center and the Circumference, and the Interspace are
equidistant every where, each one from other: And the Center is no more a
Circle without a Circumference, than the Circumference and Interspace without a
Center.

Consubstantial; The Center is constituent of the Circle, not a part from but
together with the Circumference and the Interspace.

Coeternal; It is no Center without a Circumference; and no sooner is the
Circumference drawn, but you find the Interspace.

Doubtless there is Unity in Trinity in all things, had we but light and eyes
to espy it.

You will find annexed to the Explication a Discau^se out of Acts 8 30. where
you will meet with some Rules (which have obtained in Divinity) for your better
understanding, and more profitable reading the holy Scriptures: If you be of
that select numb^r that cannot content your selves with bare reading, but
labor to understand what you read; they are chiefly and more especially
designed for you. And that you may understand what you read, and remark in your
course of reading the Sacred Scriptures, those truths more distinctly which
will make you wise to Salvation, is the main purp^rt and intent of this little
piece, and intense desire of its Comp^ser,

Your Friend for Eternity.

A Short and Plain EXPLICATION OF THE ASSEMBLIES SHORTER Catechism.
Quest. 1. WHat is the chief end of Man?

Answ. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him for ever.

Explicat. Q. What do you mean by Man's chief end?

A. That which God did chiefly intend or aim at in making Man, and which Man is
chiefly to intend.

A. No Hos. 10. 1. Isa. 5. 2.
.

Q. Is it to enjoy the pleasures, profits, and preferments of this World?

A. No Ps. 4. 6, 7. 1 John 2. 15, 16.
.

Q. Is it to glorify God, and to enjoy him ^or ever?

A. Yes.

Q. What is Man's chief Duty?

A. To glorify God Prove. 16. 4. Romans 11. 36.

10. 31.
.

Q. What is Man's chief happiness?

A. To enjoy God for ever Psa. 73. 24, 25, 26.
.

Q. How does Man enjoy God?

A. Two ways 1. Here in this life, by an holy Communion with him in the Duties
of his Worship, 1 John 1. 3.
and in an upright Conversation Ps. 50. 23. and 25. 14.
2. Hereafter in the life to come, in a glorious and immediate Communion with
him in his Kingdom 1 Cor. 13. 12. Luke 13. 28.
.

Q. May a man have another subordinate, or less principal end, besides the
glorifying of God, and enjoying him for ever?

A. Yes 1 These. 4. 11, 12. 1 Timothy 5. 8. Prove. 30. 8. Ps. 144. 15. Prove. 3. 8.
Deu. 12. 19. and 14. 27, 29. with Mal. 3. 8.
.

Q. What do you mean by a subordinate end?

A. That which a man intends, or aims at, in order to another end, or for some

or else his ultimate and chief end?

A. Man's chief end.

Q. Why are the glorifying of God, and the enjoying him for ever joined as one
chief end of man?

A. Because God has inseparably joined them together, so that men cannot truly
design, or seek the one without the other Deuteronomy. 30. 19, 20. Isa. 55. 3. with
Joh. 17. 3.
.

Q. What Rule has God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him?

A. The Word of God which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, is the only way to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.

Explic. Q. What direction must we follow that we may aright glorify God, and
enjoy him for ever?

A. We must follow the Rule God has given us.

Q. What Rule is that?

A. The Word of God Psalm. 119. 16, 17. Neh. 8. 8. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Act. 11. 19. 2
Pet. 1. 18, 19. and 1. 1. 25. Mat. 7. 13. Act 13. 44. 1 John 1. 3.
.

Q Why is the Word of God called our Rule?

A. Because all Doctrines which we are bound to believe, must be measured or
judged of; and all duties which we are bound to practice, must be squared or
conformed unto this Rule Gal. 6. 16.
.

Q. Where is the Word of God contained?

A. It is contained in the Books of the Old and New Testament Ephesians. 2. 20.
.

Q. How are these Books called?

A. They are called the holy Scriptures 2 Timothy 3. 15.
.

Q. Why are these Books so called?

A. Because they were written by Penmen inspired by God infallibly to that end.

Q. How do you know that the Books of the Old and New Testament are the Word?

A. The Papists grant the Protestants, that all the Books which they receive
are the certain Word of God.

Q. But how will you convince an Infidel, that the Doctrine taught in these
Books is the certain Word of God?

A. The Testimony of the Church is of great weight and importance in this
matter. By the Church we understand the whole company of Believers, who have
professed the true Faith; whether those who received the Doctrine of the holy
Scriptures from the Prophets and Apostles, or those who lived after: whose
Testimony

1. Is profitable to prepare the heart, and to move it to believe.

2. And of all humane Testimonies (whereby the Author of any Book that has,
is, or shall be extant, can be proved) the greatest, both in respect of the
multitude, wisdom, honesty, faithfulness of the witnesses; and the likeness,
constancy, and continuance of the Testimony it self.

3. But this Testimony is only humane.

4. Not the only, nor the chief whereby the Truth and Divinity of this Doctrine
is confirmed.

5. Neither can it be the ground of Divine Faith and Assurance. And therefore
besides this Testimony,

There are four other several infallible Testimonies of Gods Spirit, which
(though each of them alone is convincing, yet) all together make up that full
evidence that will be Ground of Divine Faith and Assurance to an Infidel.

Q. Which are those four witnesses?

A. They are, 1. Antecedently* The Spirit of Prophecy, foretelling things to
come so long before.

2. Constitutively, or inherently, The Image of God that unimitable character
of Divinity which animates this Doctrine.

3. Concomitantly, The multitude of evident and uncontrolled Miracles wrought
for this very end to confirm it. And

4. Subsequently, The extraordinary success it has in the world, which will
convince a very Infidel that it is the very Word of God.

Q. What is the first witness of the Spirit?

A. 1. Antecedently, The Spirit of Prophecy.

Q What mean you by that?

A. A continuance of wonderful Prophecies, foretelling things to come, so long
before, Genesis 3. 15. and 12. 3. and 49. 10. Dan. 9. 24.
marked with their circumstances; not doubtful, like the Oracles of the
Heathen, or Merlins Prophecies, but such as expressed the things and Persons by
their Names 2 Kings 13. 2. with 23 16. Isa. 45. 1. Jer. 25. 12. and 29. 10.
with Ezr. 1.
, which had all in their times their certain performance; and therefore unto
what can we attribute these infallible Predictions but to the inspiration of
God?

Q. What is the second witness of the Spirit?

A. 2. Constitutively, or inherently The Image and superscription of God, (as
Coin is known by the Image and superscription it bears) or that unimitable
character of Divinity not only imprinted on it, but intrinsecally animating and
constituting it.

Q. Wherein is the Image and superscription of God, or that unimitable
character of Divinity which animates and constitutes this Doctrine, apparent?

A. It is apparent in the matter, and the method, and the style.

Q. How is the Image of God apparent in the matter?

A. 1. As this Doctrine contains supernatural verities, such Divine and
wonderful Truths as could never enter into the heart of man to conceive them,
and the things the very Angels desire to look into 1 Per. 1. 12.
.

Q. Declare this by some particular Instances.

A. It explicates unto us the Nature, Properties and high Acts of God, purely
and holily.

2. It describes the Person of Christ, so fitly, excellently, and conveniently,
that if the mind of man consider it attentively, it must acknowledge, it does
exceed the reach of a finite understanding.

3. It discovers to us the corruption and misery of man by nature, the
incomprehensible Love of God in Jesus Christ toward man, that happy
reconciliation (if we may so speak) of his Justice and Mercy by his infinite
wisdom, ordaining Jesus Christ to be our Mediator.

4. It unfolds the Covenant of Grace, which God made with man after his fall;
all which can be drawn from no Fountain but Divine Revelation 1 Cor. 2. 7, 10.
Ephesians. 3. 4, 5. Col. 1. 25, 26.
.

5. It teaches also the whole Duty of Man, having Statutes and Judgments
incomparably wise and good, the Gentiles themselves being Judges Deuteronomy. 4. 5, 6,
7, 8.
.

Q. How is the Image of God apparent in the Method?

A. 2. As the Method of the whole Doctrine of the holy Scriptures set together,
is the most admirable and perfect in the world; beginning with God in unity of
essence, proceeding to his Trinity of essential active Principles, and of
Persons, and so to his Trinity of works, Creation, Redemption and Regeneration,
great things past finding out, and wonders without number; and all chiefly with
special relation to mankind; both in the estate of Innnocency and Apostasy.

Q. And how is the Image of God apparent in the style of this Doctrine?

A. 3. As it is spiritual, powerful and divine; suited to holy ends, and to the
world of Persons to whom it is sent, who are commonly ignorant and unlearned,
and so more generally useful than any other Doctrine in the world: But withal
containing such weighty concerning truths and profound mysteries, as will
belong to the most learned, and to them that are of full age, even those who by
reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil, Romans
7. 12, 14. Gal. 5. 19, to the end, 1 Pet. 2. 11, 12. Romans 13. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 6.
9* 10. 11. and Matthew. 5 Psalm. 19. 7. 1 Cor. 1. 18, 23, 24. Psalm. 119. 50. Joh.
6. 63. Acts 6. 10. Jam. 1. 21. 1 These 1. 5. and 2. 13. 1 Cor. 15 32, 33, 34.
Mal. 2. 15, 16. Matthew. 19. 4, 5, 6. and 22. 25, -- 31. 1 Timothy 1. 5, -- 12.
Psalm. 19. 8, 9. and 119, 9, 10, 11. Joh. 7. 48, 49. Luke 1. 78, 79. Matthew. 4.
16. 2 Pet. 1. 19. Acts 9. 15. with 26. 17, 18.

Q. What is the third Witness of the Spirit?

A. 3. Concomitantly, The Multitude of evident uncontrolled Miracles, wrought
for this very end to confirm it Romans 15. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 14. 18, 22. Acts 2. 42,
43. and 4. 30, 33. and 5. 12, 14. and 6. 7, 8. and 7. 36, 37, 38. and 8. 6, 12,
13, 14 and 13. 11, 12. and 14. 3. and 15. 12 and 19. 10, 11. Mark 16. 17, 18,
20. with Heb. 2. 3, 4.
(Miracles being the effect of Gods own power, and the Seal and Signet that may
be set upon no other Doctrine than that of the holy Scriptures) will convince
any that are not wilfully blind that these two Ta^les of Testimony, the holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament (as those Tables of Stone) were written
with the finger of God, and were of divine Authority.

Q. But the gift of Miracles is ceased?

A. Although it be; yet, 1. The History of them is so certain from natural
Principles, that its unpossible there should be any deceit about them. And 2.
There need not be new Miracles to confirm the former, and oblige men to believe
them.

Q. Why so?

A. For then there must be m^re Miracles to confirm those; and so on to the end
of the world: and then God could not govern the world by a settled Law, which
(...) both absurd and blasphemous.

Q. What therefore is the fourth Witness?

A. 4. Subsequently, The success of the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures, to the
Regeneration of a great part of the world, is a surviving witness to the end of
the world of its divine Authority Act. 2. 41. and 4. 4. with Matthew. 28. 19, 20.
.

Q. Of what use is this Testimony?

A. Of great use.

Q. Why so?

A. For he that is not able to examine the History, which reports the Miracles
to him, may be able to find upon his Soul the Image of God imprinted by the
Gospel, and to know that the Gospel has that in it self, which it imprints
upon others; and that it comes from God, which leads men so directly to God.
And it is certainly Gods own means which he blesses to so great and excellent
ends.

Q Can we receive sufficient direction from our own Wisdom, or the Light of
Nature to come to glorify and enjoy God?

A. No Romans 1. 21.
.

Q. Can we receive sufficient direction from Gods works of Creation and
Providence?

A. No Heb. 11. 3. Psalm. 19. 1, 7. and 73 2, 3, 12, -- 18. and 36. 5, 6.
.

Q. Are not the Apocryphal Books Scripture, nor any other, but the Books of the
Old and New Testament?

A. No.

Q. Are not the Traditions of the Church to be received, with equal reverence
to the holy Scriptures?

A. No Psalm. 119. 98. 99, 100. Act. 24. 14.
.

Q Must we call no man Father, or Master upon the Earth?

A. No, for one is our Father which is in Heaven, and one is our Master even
Christ. And all Christians being taught of God by Christ are appointed to
acknowledge no Father, or Master upon the Earth Joh. 13. 13. Matthew. 23. 9, 10.
.

Q. Is there not an infallible Judge of Controversies upon the Earth?

A. Christ, and none else, has A^thority to give Laws unto us, and punish the
refractory; And it is not for any Man living upon the Earth to impose
Observances where Christ has given liberty Jam. 4. 12.
.

Q. What would you say to such as should require you to follow the Judgment of
Fathers, Councils, and learned Divines, when you find it not agreeable to
Scripture?

A. To the Law, and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this Word,
it is because there is no light in them, Isa. 8. 20.

Q. Is the Scripture plain enough to be understood, even by the simple?

A. Yes, Psalm. 19. 7. and 119. 130.

Q. Is the Word of God a dead letter of it self?

A. No, Heb. 4. 12. Joh. 6. 63.

Q. But do the things recorded in the Word of God concern us all?

A. Yes, Romans 15. 1, -- 5. Matthew. 7. 24.

Q. Is there any other Rule besides the holy Scriptures, to direct us how we
may glorify God and enjoy him?

A. No.

Q. How prove you that?

A. 1. Because God never gave any other, Rev. 22. 18. For I testify unto every
man that hears the words of the Prophecy of this Book, if any man shall add
unto these things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this
Book.

Q. What is the Form of speech here used to conclude this Book?

A. It is 1. A Symbolical and Prophetical Form of expressing the certainty and
immutability of this Prophecy; and secondly an expression of the Absoluteness
and perfection of it is order to public use, that it should be the only
Prophecy given to the Christian Church, which should bring divine authority
along with it, sent with a Commission from Heaven; and not only proceeding from
a public Spirit, but sent out with a public Charge.

Q. What is that public Charge?

A. As for all those to whom this Prophecy shall come, I adjure them all that
they neither add nor diminish, nor change a tittle of it, upon pain of Gods
bringing on them the Judgments that are here denoun^ed against Gods greatest
enemies; and withal that they look upon it as the last Authoritative Proph^cie
that is likely to come from Heaven, to be a Rule of Faith to the Church Rev.
22. 18, 19.
.

Q. What other reason have you to prove that the holy Scriptures are the only
Rule to direct us how we may glorify God and enjoy him?

A. Because they are only able perfectly and without error to direct us how we
ought so to do Psalm. 19. 7. Joh. 5. 39. with 17. 3. 17. 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16, 17.
Psalm. 119. 96 Joh. 20* 31.
.

Q. 3. What do the Scriptures principally teach?

A. The Scriptures principally teach, what man is to believe concerning God,
and what Duty God requires of man.

Explica. Q. What are the principal Heads of the Doctrine of the holy
Scriptures?

A. The Doctrines that the holy Scriptures teach may be ranked into two Heads.

Q. What is the first principal Doctrine taught therein?

A. What man is to believe concerning God.

Q What is it ^o belie^e?

A. To assent, or give credit to truths upon Authority of another Joh. 4. 39,
41, 42.
.

Q. What is the second?

A. What duty God requires of man 2 Timothy 1. 13.
.

Q. What is meant by the duty which God requires of man?

A. That which is Gods due, or that which we owe to God, and are bound to do as
we are his Creatures, Subjects and Luke 17. 10.
Children.

Q D^ the Scriptures teach us all matters of Faith, or all that we are bound to
believe?

A. Yes Acts 20. 27. and 24. 14.
.

Q. And all matters of practice, or whatsoever we are bound to do?

A. Yes Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Rev. 22. 18.
.

Q. Is not a Christian then bound to believe any thing as a point of Faith, but
what is taught in the holy Scriptures?

A. No Gal. 1. 9
.

Q Nor bound to do any thing as necessary to Salvation, but what is taught in
them?

A. No Mat. 15. 9.
.

Q. 4. What is God?

A. God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable in his Being, Wisdom,
Power, holiness, justice, goodness and Truth.

Explic. Q What are we to believe concerning God?

A. We are to believe concerning his Being and nature, that he is a Substance
and a Spirit; or that he is a spiritual Substance Ex. 3. 14. Joh. 4. 24.
.

Q. Why is God called a Spirit?

A. 1. Negatively, because he has no bodily Substance Luke 24. 39.
.

2. Affirmatively and positively, because he is a pure active life,
intelligence and will.

Q. Are not Angels, and the Souls of men Spirits?

A. Yes Heb. 1. 13, 14. Eccl. 12. 7.
.

Q. How then is God distinguished from Angels, and the souls of men?

A. God is an infinite Job 11. 7, 8, 9. Psalm. 139. 7, -- 14.
, eternal Ps. 90. 2.
, and unchangeable Psa. 102. 27. Mal. 3. 6. Jam. 1. 17.
Spirit. Angels and the Souls of men are finite Spirits Job 4. 18, 19. Heb. 1.
10. Job 8. 9. Psalm. 102. 25, 26.
, bu^ of yesterday and changeable.

Q. But since Angels as well as the Souls of men are finite, how are they to be
distinguished?

A. Angels are pure Spirits, and have no commerce or society with Bodies, which
the Souls of men have, being in the most intimate conjunction with them. And
though in the separate state they do subsist and live without them; yet because
their happiness or misery is not complete without them, the souls of the Just
already made perfect in holiness, will be carried out with strong inclinations
unto and earnest expectation of reunion with their Bodies, to be together made
perfect in happiness, in good measure pressed down and shaken together and
running over: And in the souls of the unjust, there shall be a fearful
expectation of reunion with their Bodies as of a certain approaching,
unavoidable and utterly undoing evil, to fill up the measure of their misery,
suffering together the vengeance of eternal fire.

Or more briefly, God, Angels and the souls of men may be thus distinguished.
Angels are created Spirits complete. As Angels are created Spirits, they are
distinguished from God, who is a Spirit uncreate, or the Creator of all, or the
God of the Spirits of all flesh. As Spirits complete, they are distinguished
from the souls of men which in their complete subsistence require Bodies, which
Angels do not, Aug. Enchir. c. 18.
and may therefore be called Persons, or complete subsistences.

Q. What else are we to believe concerning God?

A. We are to believe concerning his attributes that they are of two sorts; 1.
Incommunicable. 2. Communicable.

Q. What and which are his Incommunicable attributes?

A. His Incommunicable attributes are such as are not partaken of by the
Creatures, [or that cannot be communicated to them] such are these, his
Infiniteness, Eternity and Unchangeableness.

Q. What is it to be Infinite?

A. To be without end, bounds or limits.

Q. What is it to be Eternal?

A. To be without beginning, or succession, or end of time.

Q. What is it to be unchangeable?

A. To be always the same without any alteration.

Q. What and which are the Communicable attributes of God?

A. His Communicable attributes are such as in a measure are partaken of by the
creatures [or may be communicated to them] such are these, his Wisdom, Power,
Holiness, Justice, Goodness and Truth.

Q. But are they in the same manner in the Creatures as in God?

A. No.

Q. After what manner are they in the Creatures, and how are they in God?

A. God is In^inite, Eternal and unchangeable in them, and the Creatures are
not.

Q. May then Gods Incommunicable Attributes be applied to and spoken of the
Communicable?

A. Yes, they may.

Q. How is God said to be Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable?

A. 1. In his Wisdom Ps. 147. 5* Romans 16. ^7.
.

Q. What is the Wisdom of God?

A. The Wisdom of God, is his Essential property, whereby by one simple and
eternal Act, he knows both himself and whatsoever is possible to be known.

Q. How else is God said to be Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable?

A. In his Power 1 Timothy 6. 15.
, and Holiness Rev. 4. 8 and 15. 4 1 Samuel 2. 2. Job 6. 10. Ps. 71. 22. Prove. 9.
10.
.

Q What is the power of God?

A. It is his Essential property, whereby he can do all things.

Q. What is the holiness of God?

A. It is his Essential property, whereby he is infinitely pure and holy in
himself, delights in his own purity, and loves the resemblances of it in his
Creatures.

Q. What does your Catechism last of all mention God to be Infinite, Eternal,
and Unchangeable in?

A. In his Justice Psa. 7. 9.
, Goodness Psa. 119. 68.
, and Truth Exodus 34. 6.
.

Q. What is the Justice of God?

A. The Justice of God is his Essential Property, whereby he is infinitely
righteous in himself, and equal in all his ways and dealings with his
Creatures.

Q. What is the goodness of God?

A. It is his Essential property, whereby he is altogether good in himself, and
the Author of all good.

Q. What is the Truth of God?

A. It is his Essential property, whereby he agrees with himself, Truth with
Truth; and is so immutably faithful in respect of his Creatures, that it is not
possible for him to lie, or deceive any of them Heb. 6. 18. and 10. 23. with 3.
11. and Zach. 1. 6.
.

Q 5. Are there more Gods than one?

A. There is but one only, the living and true God.

Explic. Q. Does the Scripture mention no more Gods than one?

A. Yes, diverse so called in Scripture, 1. Angels Psalm. 8. 5. wi^h Heb. 2. 7.
Psalm. 86. 8. and 138 1. and 97. 7.
, 2. Magistrates Ex. 22. 28. Psalm. 82. 1, 2, 6, 7. Joh. 10. 34, 35, 36.
, 3. Satan and satanical Apparitions 2 Cor. 4. 4. 1 Samuel 28. 13.
, 4. The Belly Phi. 3. 19.
, 5. Idols Psa. 96. 5. Ex. 12. 12. 2 Chro. 7. 19. and 32. 13.
.

Q. How then is God differenced from these?

A. Our Catechism gives three differences between them in the Titles it gives
to God, the God of Heaven.

Q. Which is the first Title given him?

A. God is one only in opposition to many Gods Deu. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6.
.

Q. How may it be proved that there is but one God?

A. There can be but one Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable Being.

Q. What Titles else has the God of Heaven given him here?

A. He is, and he is said to be the living and the true God Deuteronomy. 10. 10.
.

Q. How is God said to be the living God?

A. Two ways, 1. In opposition to dead Idols Psalm. 115. 4, 5, 6, 7. Hab. 2.
19. 1 These. 2. 9.
. 2. In that he has his life from himself. and gives life to all other things
Jer. 4. 2. Deu. 32. 40. with Heb. 6. 13. and Rev. 10. 5, 6. Acts 17. 25, 28.
.

Q. But the Creatures are, and are said to be living also.

A. True, but not as God is living; they have not their life from themselves,
nor do they give life to other things, as God has and does.

Q. How is God said to be the true God?

A. Because he is God really and indeed, not by way of imagination as Idols
are, but by nature he is so Gal. 4. 8.
.

Q. How does it appear that God is true, that he has a true being, or that
there is a God indeed? Or how may it be proved that there is a God?

A. It may be proved that there is a God, by the Testimony of Conscience, and
by the Word of God.

Q. How is Conscience a witness of this first Truth?

A. 1. As it excuses and comforts in well-doing against the disgraces, slanders
and Persecutions of the world; and as it accuses and terrifies for sin secretly
committed, which never did, nor shall come into the knowledge of men: Acting
both these ways with respect to an higher Tribunal, where the supreme Judge
will avenge the righteous and vindicate their Cause, and punish the wicked,
condemning them to shame and everlasting contempt Romans 2. 15. Genesis 4. 7, 13.
with Eccl. 9. 7. and Matthew. 27. 4, 5. Acts 5. 41. and 16. 25. with 24 25. Romans
2. 5, -- 13.
.

Q. How is it proved by the Word of God, that there is a God?

A. 2. As the Word of God makes manifest the secrets of the heart, and without
excellency of speech, or of wisdom, under plainness and easiness of style
becomes the power of God to Salvation.

Q. How does the Word manifesting the secrets of the heart and becoming the
power of God to Salvation, prove that there is a God?

A. Because these are the Works which none but the All-seeing 1 Cor. 14. 24,
25. with 2 Kings 6. 11, 12. Romans 8. 27. Psalm. 7. 9.
, and Almighty Romans 1. 16. with Ephesians. 1. 19, 20, 21. Joh. 10. 37, 38.
God ever did, or can do.

Q. But who ever saw God, that every one is thus confident to affirm that there
is a God?

A. 1. Men may without suspicion of rashness and unadvised confidence affirm
that there are many things which no man ever saw or can see; for no man ever
saw the wind or the air, and yet all are confident that there are both: And who
ever saw his own face but in a glass, and never out of a glass, and yet this
contenteth him. But,

2. We are not without the sight of God; For,

1. God is seen in his works Romans 1. 20.
.

2. The Fathers have seen him by sundry visions; and Moses saw the similitude
of the Lord, or his back parts: but his face can no man see. It pleased God to
appear to them of old not as he is, but as he vouchsafed to manifest himself to
them: For if they had seen him as he is, then all of them had seen him after
one manner because he is one: And this sight of God was also external.

3. It has pleased him in more comfortable manner to reveal himself to his
Saints by his Word, by which they behold his beauty in his Temple, and with
open face see his Image as it is represented to them in the mirror of the
Gospel, and are transformed into the same.

4. God is seen by inward contemplation, and this sight is the more excellent
than the rest, because it is more inward.

5. He is seen by Faith Heb. 11. 27.
.

6. The Faithful have the clearest sight of God in Heaven. Here their Faith is
turned into Vision, and their present sight of God, if compared with that which
is to come, is not worthy the name of sight, 1 Cor. 13. 12.

7. God is to be seen in the face of Jesus Christ, who is the brightness of his
glory and the express Image of his Person; And that we might both know that God
is, and what he is, this only begotten Son of God which is in the bosom of the
Father, he has declared him Heb. 1. 2, 3. Joh. 14. 8, 9. and 1. 18.
.

Q. 6. How many Persons are there in the Godhead?

A. There are three Persons in the Godhead, the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power
and glory.

Explic. Q* What is meant by the Godhead?

A. The divine nature, or essence.

Q. Is the divine nature common to all three Persons?

A. The whole divine nature being indivisible, 1 Cor. 8. 6. is common to all
three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Gh^st, Acts 4. 24. 2 Cor. 1. 3. Joh. 1. 1.
Romans 9. 5. Heb. 1. 8. Number. 12. 6, 7. with Acts 1. 16. 1 Pet 1. 10, 11. Heb 1.
1. Acts 4. 25 with 2 Pet. 1. 21.

Q. What follows hence?

A. It follows that whatsoever does absolutely agree to the divine nature, or
is spoken of the divine nature by relation unto the Creatures, that does agree
likewise to every Person in Trinity, Joh. 1. 1. Prove. 8. 22. Rev. 1. 8. Matthew.
18. 20. Joh. 3. 13. Job 26. 13. and 33. 4. Joh. 14. 26. Luke 1. 35.

Q. Is there any Scripture Proof for Persons in the Godhead?

A. There is, Heb. 1. 3. who being the brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the
express Image of his person.

Q. Which are the three persons in the Godhead?

A. The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost Mat. 28. 19. 2 Cor. 13. 14.
.

Q. What is a Person in the Godhead?

A. A Person in the Godhead, is the Godhead restrained, or distinguished by
his personal or incommunicable pr^perty.

Q. What is the incommunicable [or personal] property of the Father?

A. To beget Heb. 1. 5.
.

Q. What is the personal property of the Son?

A. To be begotten Joh 1. 14, 18.
.

Q What is the personal property of the Holy Ghost?

A. To proceed both from the Father and the Son J^h. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26.
.

Q. How do the persons of the Trinity differ one from another?

A. They differ three ways: 1. In their incommunicable properties, as before
explained. 2. In their order; The Father is the first Person in order; the Son
as he is the Mediator between God and men 1 Timothy 2. 5.
, or the Daies-man that can lay his hand on us both Job 9. 33.
, the second in order; and the Holy Ghost the third person.

Hence 1 Cor. 8. 6.
Creation is properly attributed to the Father, because things take their
original from him; Romans 3. 24. Col. 1. 13, 14. 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6.
Redemption to the Son, because he was made Man for us, and became our
Redeemer; Sanctification inchoate and consummate to the Holy Ghost, because he
begins and perfects the work of grace in the Elect of God. Joh. 3* 5. 1 Co^. 6.
11. and 12. 11. 2 These. 2. 13.
3. In their operation. And look what order there is in the existing in the
Trinity, the same order there is in working, viz. the Father is of none Isa.
44. 6, 7.
; the Son is of the Father alone Joh. 13. 3.
; the Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son Joh. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26.
Romans 8. 9.
: In like manner, the Father works of himself by the Son and the Holy Ghost 1
Cor. 8. 6, Heb. 1. 2. Joh. 1. 2, 3. Genesis 1. 2. Job 26. 13.
; the Son from the Father alone by the Holy Ghost Genesis 19. 24. Joh. 5. 17, 23.
and 16. 13, 14, 15. Matthew. 12. 28.
; the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son by himself Joh. 14. 16, 17. and
15. 26. 1 Cor. 12. 11.
. In externals, although in respect of the things wrought, they are common to
all the Persons; yet in respect of the manner of working, there is distinction
of the Persons.

Q. If the Father be God, and the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God; why then are
there not three Gods, but one God?

A* Because they are the same in substance 1 John 5. 7.
* equal in power and Joh. 10. 30. Phil. 2. 6. Acts 5. 3, 4. and Mat. 1. 20.
Luke 1. 32, 35. with Mark 5. 7. Psalm. 18. 13. and 29. 3.
glory.

Q. 7. What are the Decrees of God?

Q. 8. How does God execute his Decrees?

A. God executes his Decrees in the Works of Creation and Providence.

Explic. Q. Are the works of Creation and Providence the Execution of Gods
eternal Decrees?

A. Yes Rev. 4. 11. Dan. 4* 35, 37.
.

Q. What do you mean by the execution of Gods eternal Decrees?

A. The bringing to pass whatsoever God has foreordained.

Q. How do the Decrees of God, and the execution of them differ?

A. The Decrees of God are from all eternity, the execution of them in time.

Q. 9. What is the work of Creation?

.

Q. In what space of time did he make them?

A. In the space of Exodus 20* 11.
six days.

Q. But why did God take all this time to make all things?

A. It was not, because he could not have made them sooner in an instant, if it
had pleased him.

Q. For what special reasons then do you imagine?

A. For these two especially, 1. That we might learn by his example to work six
days, and rest a seventh. 2. That we might learn not to do things rashly and
hastily, but with due deliberation.

Q. Of what quality did God make all things?

A. All very good Genesis 1. 31.

.

Q. 15. What was the sin whereby our first Parents fell from the estate wherein
they were Created?

A. The sin whereby our first Parents fell from the estate wherein they were
Created, was the eating of the forbidden Fruit.

Explic. Q. What was the first sin that was committed by mankind?

A. Eating the forbidden Fruit by our first Parents Gen* 3. 6.
.

Q. 16. Did all mankind fall in Adam's first transgression?

A. The Covenant being made with Adam; not only for himself, but for his
Posterity; all mankind descending from him by ordinary Generation, sinned in
him, and fell with him in his first transgression.

Explic. Q. Was Adam only concerned in the Covenant of Life, God made with him
in the state of Innocence?

A. No, for the Covenant was not made with Adam for himself only, but for his
Posterity also Romans 5. 19.
.

Q. Did all mankind sin in Adam, and fall with him in his first transgression?

A. All mankind descending from Adam by ordinary Generation, sinned in him, and

A. That whereby all mankind else came into the world, in a natural way from
man and woman, under sin Romans 3. 9.
.

Q. How could all the Posterity of Adam, being then unborn, sin in him, and
fall with him in his first transgression?

A. 1. They were in him representatively; Adam was the common head and
representative of all mankind 1 Cor. 15. 22.
.

2. They were in him virtually, they were in his loins. And as Levi is said to
pay tithes in Abraham, when only in his loins, Heb. 7. 9, 10. so Adams
Posterity sinned in his loins.

Q. And is this the reason, why all mankind sinned in Adam, and fell with him,
because the Covenant was made with him, not only for himself, but also for his
Posterity?

A. Yes Romans 5. 12.
.

Q. 17. Into what estate did the Fall bring mankind?

A. The Fall brought mankind into an estate of sin and misery.

Q. 18. Wherein consists the sinfulness of that estate whereinto man fell?

A. The sinfulness of that estate whereinto man fell consists in the guilt of
Adams first sin, the want of original Righteousness, and the corruption of his
whole nature, which is commonly called Original sin; together with all actual
Transgressions which proceed from it.

Expli. Q. How many sorts of sins be there, wherein the sinfulness of that
estate whereinto man fell, does consist?

A. Two, Original and Actual.

Q. Wherein consists Original sin?

A. In three things, as

1. The guilt of Adams first sin Romans 3. 9.
.

2. The want of Original Righteousness Romans 3. 2, 3. Eccl. 7. 29.
.

3. The corruption of the whole nature Psalm. 51. 5. Job 14. 4.
.

Q. What is guilt?

A. A binding over to punishment.

Q. What do you mean by Original Righteousness?

A. That which Man was at first Created in.

Q. What do you mean by the corruption of the whole nature?

A. That whereby the whole Man (Soul and Body) is utterly indisposed Romans 5. 6.
, disabled and made Romans 8. 7.
opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly inclined to all evil, and
that Genesis 6. 5*
continually.

Q. How do you prove the universal depravity and corruption of man's nature?

A. Besides Scripture Proof, which is as express in this truth as any upon
Record; experience it self will confirm it by our daily sinful infirmities, by
our backwardness to those duties wherein we may enjoy most of God, and by our
being Eftsoons led into temptation, and drawn into those very sins which are
more especially cross and contrary to our natural tempers and constitutions.

Q. But why is the corruption of man's whole nature commonly called Original
sin, since that is not a Scripture name?

A. For three Reasons,

1. Because it is derived from Adam the Original of mankind Acts. 17. 26.
.

2. Because it is in every one from his Original Job 14. 4. Psalm. 51. 5.
. It may say to every one, As soon as thou were, I am.

3. Because it is the original of all other sins Jam. 1. 15.
.

Q. What do you mean by actual transgressions?

A. The transgressions of our Life, which proceed from original sin Ephesians. 2*
2, 3. Mat. 15. 19, 20.
.

Q. 19. What is the misery of that estate whereinto man fell?

A. All mankind by their fall lost communion with God, are under his wrath and
curse, and so made liable to all miseries in this life, to death it self, and
to the pains of Hell for ever.

Explic. Q. What has man lost by the Fall?

A. Communion with God.

Q. What do you mean by that?

A. Fellowship Cen. 3. 8, 24.
or friendship with God, or the 2 Cor. 13. 14.
communications of Gods Love, Grace and Favor.

Q. What is man brought under by the Fall?

A. Under Gods Ephesians. 2* 3.
wrath and Gal. 3. 10.
curse.

Q. What are the parts of Gods wrath and Curse?

A. 1. All the miseries of this life. Lam. 3. 39. Genesis 47. 9. Job* 5. 7.


2. Death it self Rom* 6. 23
, Death natural (here meant) which is the separation of Body and Soul.

3. The pains of Hell for ever Mat. 25. 41. Jude ver. 7. Rev. 20. 14, 15.
.

Q. 20. Did God leave all mankind to perish in the estate of sin and misery?

A. God having out of his mere good pleasure, from all Eternity elected some to
Eternal life, did enter into a Covenant of Grace to deliver them out of the
estate of sin and misery, and to bring them into an estate of Salvation by a
Redeemer.

Explic. Q. Must all mankind unavoidably perish in their sins and misery?

A. No, not the elect of God Romans 8. 33.
.

Q. Whom do you mean by Gods Elect?

A. Those whom God has chosen to everlasting life 2 These. 2. 13.
.

Q. What moved God to Elect any?

A. His mere good pleasure Ephesians* 1. 5. Romans 9. 18.
.

Q. What mean you by that?

A. The most free, absolute, or undetermined Will of God.

Q. When did God Elect them?

A. From all Eternity Ephesians. 1. 4.
.

Q. What mean you by that?

A. Before time began, or before any thing was created.

Q. What did God do for his Elect, to accomplish his decree touching their
Salvation?

A. He entered into a Covenant of Grace with them.

Q. Why is the second Covenant called the Covenant of Grace?

A. Because Free Grace was the only motive God had to make, and perform the
Promises contained in it Romans 5. 15.
.

Q. By what other name is this Covenant called?

A. It is also called the New Covenant, because it never decays, nor waxes
old; but remains in full force, effect and virtue to the end of the world
Jer. 31. 31.
.

Q. But what is become of the Law of that first Covenant made with Adam in
Paradise Genesis 2. 17.
, that old Covenant, the Covenant of Life, or Works; repeated to the Jews Deuteronomy.
27. 26.
* The sum of which we have fully expressed, Ezekiel. 18. 4. The Soul that sins,
it shall die?

A. It is neither executed nor abrogated; but released, or dispensed with.

Q. Is it not fully executed?

A. No Romans 8. 1.
.

Q. Nor abrogated?

A. No.

Q. How prove you that?

A. By these two Reasons,

1. It is in part executed upon Believers themselves; they are liable to the
miseries of this life Ps. 34. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 19. Psalm. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33.
, and to Death it self, viz. to the first or natural Death Romans 6. 23.
, which is the wages of sin, although the second Death has no power over them
Rev. 20. 6.
.

2. It is totally executed upon finally impenitent unbelievers; who are liable
to the pains of Hell for ever 2 These. 1. 8, 9.
, over whom not the first only, but the second Death also has power Joh. 3.
18. 36. Rev. 20. 14, 15.
.

Q. But seeing Jesus tasted Death for every man, does not the Gospel relieve
impenitent unbelievers?

A, The Gospel finds them, and every one in a state of Condemnation: Those who
believe, it proclaims deliverance unto and relieves them; but those who through
unbelief reject it, and Acts 13. 46.
put it from them, and judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life, it leaves
such as it found them, viz. under the Condemnation of the Old Covenant, since
they refuse the pardoning mercy of the New.

Q. You have now satisfied us that the first Covenant is neither fully executed
nor abrogated; But how is it released, or dispensed with?

A. By super-inducing a New Covenant of Grace over it; that whosoever closes
with, and comes into the terms of the new, shall be exempted from the rigor
and extremity, i. e. from the eternal Joh. 3. 16
condemnation of the old; although he may be liable to the miseries of this
life, and to the first Death.

Q* Is the Covenant of works, as to its execution upon such as are in the
Covenant of Grace, in the chief part restrained, although in some part
inflicted?

A. Yes.

Q. In the chief part restrained, and in some part inflicted; what do you mean
by that?

A. We mean, that Believers shall never complain under the eternal and
destructive, although they do bear the temporal, and corrective punishment of
their fins Lam. 3. 33
.

Q. But because generals are obscure, tell us particularly, for the clearer
understanding of this Mystery, what obligation the first Covenant lays on
sinful man?

A. A double obligation; first, in reference to what is past. And secondly, in
reference to the future.

Q What obligation does it lay on him, in reference to what is past?

A. It requires satisfaction, and reparation from him, for his sin in breaking
it To. 6. 23.
.

Q What, in reference to the future?

A. It requires perfect conformity still as at the first, and absolute
obedience to all Gods commands, being the eternal debt of the reasonable
creature to that God, that made it in his own Image.

Q. Is it possible for us to satisfy Gods injured Law for our first breach?

A. No.

Q But if we could, might not the Law come upon us for future exact conformity,
to pay the residue of that eternal Debt, due to God as our Creator?

A. Yes Joh. 5. 14^
, it might.

Q. Does the Covenant of Grace relieve us as to both these cases, and dispense
with the rigor of the Law?

A. Yes.

Q. How does it relieve us as to the first obligation?

A. It comforts us with the good news that the Son of God has satisfied his
Fathers Justice; and if we believe but in him, God will accept of us, as if we
had satisfied in our own persons. [The case the Law leaves us in, is well
expressed, Isa. 33. 14. and Heb. 10. 31. But the relief the Gospel brings us,
in St. Paul's language, Romans 8. 33, 34. you have both together excellently,
Ezekiel. 33. 10, 11.]

Q. How, as to the second?

A. The New Covenant dispenceth with the rigor of that too; and justified and
pardoned persons shall not lose all again upon the least defailance; therefore
the Gospel proclaims pardon of sin upon Repentance, and acceptance of sincere
endeavors to obey him.

Q God gave the Law from Mount Sinai, and the voice of words was so dreadful
there, that they which heard it, entreated that the Word should not be spoken
to them any more: But we are come to Mount Sion; what is Gods language to us
now?

A. Sinners, be but in good earnest, do but love me heartily and my ways; let
me but see a child-like ingenuity in you, and I will put down your upright,
though imperfect performances, in the Book of my remembrance Mal. 3. 16.
.

Q. How is it possible our performances should be recorded in the Book of Gods
remembrance, since the best of them are imperfect, and we do daily break the
Commandments of God in thought, word and deed?

A. If there be a willing mind, it is well accepted according to that we have,
and not according to that we have not. And the Commandments of God may be
reputed as done* when whatsoever is not done is pardoned. Thus does the candor
of the Gospel dispense with the rigor of the Law Mat. 11. 30.
.

Q. But how does it stand with Gods veracity and immutability having once
declared that the soul that sins shall die, to contradict it by declaring,
That he that believes shall never die, but have Eternal Life? Joh. 11. 26.


A. We must look upon threatenings as a part of the Law, declaring the dueness
of the punishment, what the offender has deserved to suffer; Not as
predictions of the event, any more than Thou shall, and Thou shall not in the
command, are Predictions: but only are expressive of the dueness of obedience.

Q. How do the Old and New Covenant differ?

A. They differ more especially, these two ways,

1. In their tenor; the tenor of the Old is, Obey [perfectly] and live, sin and
die; The tenor of the New is, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall
be saved.

2. The New Covenant admits of Repentance, which the Old does not.

Q. But must not a believer acknowledge perfect obedience to be still his duty?

A. Yes.

Q. Why so?

A. Because this honors the equity of Gods Commandments.

Q. And has the Redeemer then by making this one of the Conditions of the
Gospel Covenant, given his Father his Law back again?

A. Yes.

Q. Does he not repeal it?

A. No, it is still the Rule of life, and every Commandment still obliges a
Believer.

Q. What has Christ then done for us?

A. Christ has only released us from the condemning power of the Law, not the
commanding power of it.

Q. How understand you that?

A. We must still press after perfection; but though we fall short of it, we
shall not die for it: Christ having Redeemed us from the curse of the Law,
being made a curse for us; He leaves us under the Government and Command of the
Law.

Q. But have you any Scripture-warrant for what you say in this matter?

A. Yes, the whole matter is excellently expressed, 1 Ioh. 2. 1. My little
Children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not: And if any man sin
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

Q. But generally and more briefly, what does God promise to deliver the Elect
out of in the Covenant of Grace?

A. Out of the estate of sin and misery.

Q. But how does God perform this Promise to them, seeing that they also are
liable to the miseries of this life, and to the first Death as the wages of sin?

A. Although the Old Covenant in part be executed on them, yet does not God
leave them in the state of sin and misery; but has entered into a New Covenant
with them to bring them out of it: And what they suffer is for their good, that
being reformed by stripes, they may be freed from those punishments which fall
on the unreformed to all eternity Lam. 3. 39. Mich. 7. 9. Romans 5. 21. 15. 22.
Romans 8. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 11. 30, 32.
.

Q. And what does God promise to bring the Elect into in the Covenant of Grace?

A. Into an estate of Salvation 1 John 5. 11, 12. Joh. 3. 16. Heb. 8. 10.
.

Q. Is then the Deliverance of Gods Elect out of the estate of sin, and his
bringing them into an estate of Salvation, the sum and the substance of what
has been said more at large in several particulars concerning the benefits of
the New Covenant?

A. Yes.

Q. How does God promise to do all this?

A. By a Redeemer, Isa. 53. 10. When thou shall make his soul an offering for
sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand, verse. 11. He shall see of the Travail of his
soul, and shall be satisfied, etc. And this by some learned Divines is called
the Covenant of Redemption.

Q. What do they mean by it?

A. That federal transaction that was betwixt God the Father and the Son from
everlasting, about the Redemption of lost and fallen M^n.

Q. Is not this the same with the Covenant of Grace?

A. This Covenant is a Covenant of Grace, but it is not strictly that Covenant
of Grace, which the Scripture holds out in opposition to the Covenant of works;
but rather the means to it, or foundation of it.

Q. Wherein do these two Covenants differ?

A. In the Confederates, For in the Covenant of Redemption, the Confederates
are Joh. 6. 37.
God and Christ, but in the Covenant of Grace, the Confederates are God and
Believers Joh. 3. 16.
.

Q. 21. Who is the Redeemer of Gods Elect?

A. The only Redeemer of Gods Elect is the Lord Jesus Christ who being the
eternal Son of God, became man, and so was, and continues to be God and Man in
two distinct natures, and one person for ever.

A. The Lord Jesus Christ.

A. As that Grace which alone receives the righteousness of Christ Phil. 3. 9
.

Q. But is justifying Faith solitary without all attendants?

A. No, justifying Faith has two Daughters that inseparably attend her.

1. Repentance: Here sinful man retracts and undoes his faults, acknowledges
his transgressions, rents his heart weeps, smites upon his breast, and cries
What have I done? laments after the Lord, and abhors himself in dust and ashes:
He executes the Law upon himself; and since God excuses him from the
punishment, he accuses himself (...) the guilt, and condemns himself to the
shame of his sin; and hereby the sinner honors the equity of the threatening by
his tears, acknowledging that his blood was due.

2. Newness of life: Here the sinner acknowledges perfect obedience to be
still his duty, which honors the equity of Gods Commandments Romans 16. 26
.

Q. But that with all requisite distinctness we may apprehend this great
affair, let us take a view of some of the most considerable and important
causes which concur to the producing this excellent effect, the discharge and
Justification of a sinner, and state their several interests and concernments
in their respective influences upon and contributions toward it, because
Justification is a main Article of our Faith; and therefore, How does
Free Grace Justify?

A. The Free Grace of God is the first wheel that sets all the rest in motion.
1. How free grace Justifies.
Its contribution is that of a Proegumenal cause, or internal motive, disposing
God to send his Son, that sinners (believing) might be Justified freely by his
grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ Joh. 3. 16 Romans 3. 24
.

Q. But did not Christ die to render God good to mankind?

A. Christ died not ^o render God good to mankind (he was so eternally) but
that with the honor of his Justice he might ^xert and display his goodness,
which contrived and made it self this way to break forth into the world.

Q. How is Christ's satisfaction concerned in our Justification?

A. It is doubly concerned in it: 2. How Christ's satisfaction.


1. In respect of God, as a Pro-catartick cause (which is an external, as the
Pro^gumenal is an internal moving cause) and is of infinite merit and
impe^rative power; for the sake of which God is reconciling himself unto the
world in Christ, not imputing their Trespasses unto them, 2 Cor. 5. 19.

2. In respect of the Law of Works, Christ's satisfaction Justifies us
formally, as our proper legal righteousness.

Q. Why do you call it our Righteousness?

A. Because it becomes imputed to us upon our believing; Faith being our
Gospel-Title, by pleading which we lay claim to all the benefits, accruing from
the merit of Christ's performance, to all effects, uses, and purposes, as if it
had been personally our own.

Q. But why do you call it our legal Righ^^^^^ness?

A. Because thereby the Law of God owns it self fully apaid, and acquiesceth
(...) it, as in full reparations, and amends ^ade unto it for the injury and
dishonor r^eived by the sin of man.

Q And may we plead this against (...) the challenges and accusations of the
law.

A. Yes Romans 8. 33, 34*
.

Q. And is this our legal Righteousness required in the first Covenant, that of
Works, which is thus imputed upon our account, wholly without us, in our
Redemer?

A. Yes 2 Cor. 5. 21
.

Q. But is our Evangelical Righteousness required in the second Covenant
without us, as our legal Righteousness required in the old is?

A. No, for though Christ performed the Conditions of the Law, and satisfied
for our nonperformance, yet it is our selves that must perform the conditions
of the Gospel. It is not Christ but we that must repent and believe Acts 20. 21
.

Q. But there are some that tell us that Christ has also performed for us the
conditions of the Gospel; that he has believed perfectly, and repented
perfectly, and that all is ours: what ought we to think of this Opinion?

A. If we judge of it in its clear consequence, it is both absurd and
blasphemous; as if Christ had a Savior to bel^eve in for pardon and life, or
sin to repent of, and sorrow for, and mortify.

Q. How is this Opinion absurd?

A. As it supposes a perfect Savior to stand in need of a Savior Heb. 7. 26,
27
.

Q. How is it blasphemous?

A. As it makes Christ the Son of God a sinner, who is God and man John 9. 24,
25 Phil. 2. 6, 7 3 How the Gospel.
.

Q. How does the Gospel Justify?

A. As it is the Law of Faith that publishes and declares to us upon what
terms we shall be Justified Romans 3. 27
.

Q. And is the Gospel our great Charter, and Gods W^rrant under his broad Seal,
that he that believes shall not be condemned?

A. Yes Joh. 3. 18
.

Q. How does Faith Justify?

A. By virtue of the Law promulgated and published as it is our Evangelical
righteousness, 4. How Faith.
or our keeping the Gospel-Law, which suspends Justification upon believing.

Q. Does Faith pretend to no merit or virtue of its own?

A. No, but professedly avows its dependence upon the merit of Christ's
satisfaction, and lays hold on it as our legal Righteousness.

Q. Nor can it show any other Title to be it self our Evangelical
righteousness, but only Gods sanction [Law, or Decree establishing it] who
chose this Act of believing to the honor of being the justifying Act, because
it so highly honors Christ?

A. No.

Q. May this be illustrated to us by some apt resemblance?

A. Yes, the Act of believing is as the S^lver; but Gods authority in the
Gospelsanction, is the Kings Coin, or Image stamped upon it, which gives it all
its value as to Justification.

Q. Without this stamp, could it never have been current?

A. No.

Q. And if God had set this stamp on any other Grace, as Love: would that then
have been current, and have Justified us as Faith does now?

A. Yes.

Q. How does God Justify?

A. God justifies in a proper sense two ways, First, as a Legislator.
Secondly, 5. How God.
as a Judge.

Q How does God Justify as a Legislator?

A. He Justifies as a Legislator, enacting by his Sovereign authority that
sweet and gracious Law of the New Covenant, by virtue of whose tenor every
sinner that believes is Justified from the Guilt of sin, from which he could
not be Justified by the Law of Moses, Acts 13. 39.

Q How does God Justify as a Judge?

A. 2. As a Judge, he may in three respects be said to Justify a Believer.

First, Forthwith upon his believing God owneth him secretly within himself, as
a person justified; God esteems and approves of him as in that state, unto
which he has by believing a Title good in Law, an indefea^ible right.

Secondly, At the moment of dissolution God Justifies as the Judge of all the
earth, passing a private Sentence and a ward unto everlasting life upon every
believing Soul.

Thirdly, But eminently at the last day, when the Ancient of days shall take
the Throne, and in open Court before the whole Creation, by public sentence
for ever acquit and discharge Believers at that great and last Assizes.

Q. How are works said to Iusti^ie?

A. 6. As they Justify our Faith, or demonstrate before God and man, and to
our own Consciences that our Faith is not a dead and barren, but a true and
living one by its fruitfulness in well-doing.

Q. How does the Spirit of God Justify?

A. 7. The Spirit of God Justifies two ways: First, Directly, by working
Faith in the heart, as the Author of that justifying Grace. Secondly,
Reflexively, as he clears up Justification to a Believers Conscience, by
discovering the truth of Faith* by working Assurance, and by sealing a Believer
to the day of Redemption Romans 8. 16, 17* Ephesians. 4. 30
.

Q. 34. What is Adoption?

A. Adoption is an act of Gods free grace, whereby we are received into the
number, and have a right to all the Privileges of the Sons of God.

.

Q. What is it for men to Adopt Children?

A. To take strangers into their Families, and account them their Children, and
accordingly to take care of them, as it they were their own.

Q. What is it for God to Adopt Children?

A. To take them which are strangers, and by nature Children of wrath, into his
Family, and to receive them into the number, and give them right unto all the
Privileges of the Sons of God Ephesians. 2. 3, 19 2 Cor. 6. 18 Romans 8. 17
.

Q. What are those Privileges which the Adopted Children of G^d have a right
unto?

A. The Privileges which the Adopted Children of God have a right unto are,

1. Gods Fatherly protection of them from temporal and spiritual evils Pi. 121.
7
.

2. Gods Fatherly provision of all needful things, both for their Soul and Body
Psa. 34. 10 and 84. 11
.

3. Gods Fatherly correction of them Heb. 12. 6
.

4. Gods Audience and return to their Prayers 1 John 5. 14, 15
.

.

sin, and live unto Righteousness.

Explic. Q. Whose work is Sanctification?

A. It is Gods work Lev. 20. 8
.

Q. What moved him to sanctify us?

A. His free grace alone 1 Cor. 6 11
.

enlightened, and the habits of all graces are infused.

Q. How is our Sanctification carried on?

A. It is carried on by degrees, as God does bless all dispensations,
especially his Ordinances, through them to communicate further measures of his
Spirit and Grace.

Q. Wherein is our Sanctification perfected?

A. In our Glorification, when we shall be made perfectly free from sin, and
fully conformable to the Image of God.

Q. Is this work done perfectly, and all at once here upon earth?

A. No, we are enabled more and more so to do Job 17. 9
.

Q Wherein does Sanctification differ from Justification and Adoption?

A. 1. Justification and Adoption are acts of God without us: Sanctification is
a work of God within us.

2. Justification and Adoption do make a relative change; Sanctification does
make in us a real change.

Q But since Scripture calls Justification our righteousness as well as
Sanctification, why do you make them to differ?

A. 1. Justification is an imputed righteousness; Sanctification is an inherent.

2. Justification is a righteousness that makes a change in the sinners state,
whereby he becomes absolved at the Bar of divine Justice Romans 8. 33, 34
(for Justification is a Lawstate, it abolisheth the convincing power of sin,
or its Guilt) but Sanctification is a righteousness wrought in the sinners
person, whereby he becomes a new 2 Cor. 5. 17
creature.

God, and that our names are written in Heaven Romans 8. 16 Luke 10. 20
.

Q Does the Scripture warrant any distinction between the Faith of Affiance and
the Faith of Evidence, or the assurance of Gods Love?

A. That it is one thing to be Justified (which is done by the Faith of
Affiance) and another thing to have it manifest to our Consciences that we are
so (which is done by the Faith of Evidence) is very clear from 1 Ioh. 5. 13.
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of

grow in Grace, and at some time or other they grow; And many times they do grow
when they do not perceive themselves to grow, but fear that they decline.

Q. Do all truly Justified, Adopted, and sanctified persons persevere in Grace
to the end?

A. They do persevere in Grace to the end, and shall assuredly attain the
heavenly Inheritance.

Q. How prove you that?

A. 1. From the unchangeableness of Gods elective Love Romans 8. 30 John 6. 37
To. 11. 29 John 13. 1
.

2. From the All Sufficiency of his Power John 10. 28, 29, 30 1 Pet. 1. 5
.

3. From his Faithfulness in his Promises Heb 10 23 2 Cor. 1. 20 Nu^. 23. 19
Heb. 6. 17, 18 Isa. 54. 8, 9, 10 and 55. 3. 11
.

4. From Christ's unchangeable Priesthood and continual Intercession for them
Heb. 7. 24, 25 Joh. 11. 42
.

5. From the nature of Grace, and the means thereof 1 John 3. 9 1 Pet. 1. 9 and
3. 4 H^b. 6. 16 1 John 5. 4 Tit. 2. 11 1 Pet. 1. 23, 24, 25
.

Q. May not any Believers by falling into sin, fall from Grace?

A. Some Believers may through the remainders of corruption in them, and the
violence of Satan's temptations fall into sin foully, and so fall from degrees
and measures of Grace; but they shall never fall totally and finally from
Grace. And when we see any to fall totally and finally from the profession they
formerly made, we may know they were never that in sincerity, which they
professed themselves to be 1 John 2. 19
.

Q. 37. What benefits do Believers receive from Christ at their Death?

A. The souls of Believers are at their Death made perfect in holiness, and do
immediately pass into Glory; and their Bodies being still united to Christ, do
rest in their Graves till the Resurrection.

Explic. Q. How manifold are the benefits of Believers at their Death?

2. In respect of their Bodies.

Q. 1. What benefits have Believers in respect of their Souls at Death?

A. They are made perfect in holiness, and do immediately pass into Glory Heb.
12. 23 2 Cor. 5. 1, 6
.

Q. Are not Believers perfect in this life?

A. No 1 John 1. 8
.

Q. Do not the Souls of Believers sleep in the Grave with their Bodies, or stay
in Purgatory?

A. No. Ibid. Phil. 1. 23 Luke 23. 42, 43
.

Q What do Papists mean by Purgatory?

A. They mean a state of Temporary punishments after this life, from which men
may be released and translated into Heaven, by the Prayers of the living and
the Sacrifice of the Mass.

Q. 2. What benefits have Believers in respect of their Bodies at Death?

A. 1. Their Bodies are still united to Christ. For, though Death does for a
while separate their Souls from their Bodies, yet it cannot separate Christ
from either; but as when Christ died, his Hypostatical or Personal union still
remained, his Divine Nature being united both to his Soul in Heaven, and to his
Body in the Tomb on Earth: So when Believers die, their mystical union unto
Christ still remains, and Christ is united both to their Souls with him in
Glory, and to their Bodies, which are his Members, even when they are rotting
in the Grave Mat. 22* 33 1 Cor. 6. 15
.

2. They rest in their Graves, as in their Beds, till the Resurrection 1 These.
4. 14 Isa. 57. 2 1 These. 4. 16 Job 19. 25, 26, 27 Dan. 12, 2
.

Q. What is the Resurrection here spoken of?

A. The last and general Resurrection of all the dead that have lived in all
Ages from the beginning of the Creation; which will be first of the righteous,
and then of the wicked at the last day 1 These. 4. 16 John 5. 28, 29
.

Q How do you prove that there shall be such a general Resurrection?

A. It may be undeniably proved from the Scriptures and the power of God. If
God be of infinite power, and therefore can raise the dead, and infinitely
true, and in the Scriptures has revealed that he will raise all the dead, then
there shall be a general Resurrection; but God is infinite in power, and in the
Scriptures has revealed that he will raise all the dead, therefore there shall
be a general Resurrection. The ground of the Sadduces error, who denied the
Resurrection, was their ignorance of these two great foundations of this
Doctrine, namely, the Scriptures and the power of God Mark 12. 24
.

Q. Shall the Dead the raised with the same body, which they had when aliu
before?

A. Yes Job 19. 26, 27
.

Q. How do you prove that the Dead shall be raised with the same Body?

A. Because otherwise it could in no proper sense be called a Resurrection, but
a new Creation.

2. Because it is fit the same Body that was an instrument of righteousness, or
sin should share in the like Reward or Punishment.

Q. Will not the Bodies, when they are raised, differ from what they are now?

A. They will not differ from what they are now in regard of their substance
and essence; But they will exceedingly differ in regard of their qualities.

Q. 38. What benefits do Believer receive from Christ at the Resurrection?

A. At the Resurrection, Believers being raised up in Glory, shall be openly
acknowledged and acquitted in the day of Judgment, and made perfectly blessed
in full enjoying of God to all Eternity.

Explic. Q. How many ways may the benefits which Believers receive from Christ
at the Resurrection be considered?

A. Three ways.

1. In respect of the Resurrection it self.

2. In respect of the day of Judgment, after their Resurrection.

3. In respect of Heaven after the day of Judgment.

Q. What is the benefit of Believers in respect of the Resurrection it self?

A. Believers shall be raised up in Glory 1 Cor. 5. 43 Phil. 3. 21
.

Q. What benefits shall Believers have at the day of Judgment?

A. They shall be acknowledged and acquitted.

Q. What mean you by their being acknowledged?

A. Their being owned by Jesus Christ as his Mat. 10. 32
.

Q. What mean you by their being acquitted, and from what shall they be
acquitted?

A. They shall be fully freed from all their sins, and finally discharged from
the sentence of Condemnation.

Q. After what manner shall they be acknowledged and acquitted?

A Openly, viz. before the Father and the holy Angels, and the general Assembly
of the whole world Mat. 10. 32 Luke 12. 8 2 Cor. 5. 10
.

Q. What is the benefit of Believers in Heaven, after the day of Judgment?

A. They shall then be made perfectly blessed.

Q. Wherein does that blessedness consist?

A. In full enjoying or God to all Eternity 1 John 3. 2 1 Cor. 13. 12 1 These 4.
17
.

Hitherto are the matters of Faith, which make up the first Part of the
Catechism, or what man is to believe concerning God.

Now follows the second Part concerning the duty which God requires of Man.

Q. 39. What is the Duty which God requires of Man?

A. The Duty which God requires of Man is obedience to his revealed Will.

Explic. Q. Does God require any thing to be performed by man to himself?

A. God requires Duty from Man.

Q. What is that Duty?

A. Obedience (to obey.)

Q. What is the Rule of Man's obedience in General?

A. Gods revealed Will.

Q. What mean you by that?

A. The written Word, or the holy Scriptures, wherein the main purport of them
is not to reveal to us the existence or nonexistence of our actions, but their
moral convenience; nor yet future contingences, and whatsoever shall come to
pass in the world, but what may and ought to be done by intelligent creatures,
and what by preventive love and enforcing obligations God will expect from us
Deuteronomy. 29. 29 Acts 1 6, 7 Mich. 6. 8
.

Q What do you mean by those obligations that enforce the Duty which God
requires of man?

A. Those beneficial resultances, or benefits which flow from Gods relation to
Man as his Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier.

Q. 40. What did God at first reveal to man for the Rule of his Obedience?

A. The Rule which God at first revealed to man for his obedience, was the
Moral Law.

Explic. Q. Is not Gods secret Will the Rule of Man's obedience?

A. No.

Q. How prove you that?

A. 1. Because the Will of God as secret is a peculiar Treasure which he has
put in his own power, and will keep to himself Acts 1. 7 Mat. 24. 36
.

2. Because a man may sometimes sin in fulfilling the secret Will of God, and
be ashamed, repenting in dust and ashes that he has done it Acts 2. 23, 36,
37, 38
.

3. Because all Creatures do this Will of God, and none ever resisted it Romans
9. 19
.

Q. Is the revealing of an event which God has determined, or those Actions
whereby that event shall be brought to pass, the Rule of Man's obedience?

A. No 1 Kings 11. 31, 35 with 2 Chronicles. 13. 5, 6, 7, etc.
.

Q. But are not Gods own positive and ceremonial Laws this Rule of Man's
obedience?

A. No.

Q. How prove you that?

A. 1. Because they were so burdensome a yoke that neither we nor the Jews
themselves were ever able to bear them Acts 15. 10
.

2. Because they were never pleasing to God irrespectively of themselves,
neither did he at all ever take delight in these Laws themselves simply
considered Psalm. 40. 6 and 51. 16 Isa. 1. 11, 12
.

3. Because these positive Laws were such, by which men should never obtain
Eternal Life Ezekiel. 20 25 Heb. 7. 11, 19
.

Q. What Law then is that which is the Rule of Man's obedience?

A. The Moral Law.

Q. Why is it so called?

A. Because it has a perpetual binding power in all Ages unto the end of the
world.

Q. When was this revealed?

A. At first.

Q. How understand you that?

A. Two ways.

1. This Law was at first given to Adam in Innocence, God having written it on
his heart; some small remainders whereof abide yet in man's nature Romans 2. 14, 15
.

2. This Law was first revealed by Gods immediate voice, after written in
Tables of Stone, and given to the Church as a perpetual Rule for their
obedience.

Q. 41. Wherein is the Moral Law summarily comprehended?

A. The Moral Law is summarily comprehended in the ten Commandments.

Explic. Q What is it for the Moral Law to be summarily comprehended in the ten
Commindments?

A. To have the sum and chief Heads of the Law contained in them?

Q. 42. What is the sum of the ten Commandments?

A. The sum of the ten Commandments is to Love the Lord our God with all our
Heart, and with all our Soul, and with all our Mind, and with all our Strength,
and our Neighbor as our selves Mark 12. 30, 31
.

Explic. Q In how many Tables were the te^ Commandments at first written?

A. In two Tables of Stone, Deuteronomy. 10. 1, 2, 4.

Q. How many Commandments are comprised under the first Table, or first great
Commandment?

A. The so^r first.

Q How many under the second Table, or second great Commandment?

A. Six.

Q. Do the Papists well in leaving out the second Commandment, and in their
dividing the tenth into two?

A. No Deuteronomy. 4. 13 Exodus 20. 17.
.

Q. What is the comprehensive Duty of all the Commandments written in these two
Tables?

A. Love, Romans 13. 9. For this, Thou shall not commit Adultery, Thou shall not
Kill, Thou shall not Steal, Thou shall not bear false Witness, Thou shall not
Covet: And if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in
this saying, Namely, Thou shall Love thy Neighbor as thy self. [The like may
be said of all the Commandments of the first Table.]

Q What is the sum of the first Table of the Law?

A. To love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and with all our Soul, and
with all our Mind, and with all our Strength.

Q. What mean you by the word Sum?

A. A general or chief Head which comprehends other particulars in it. Ibid.
Romans 13. 8.

Q. What is it to love the Lord our God with all our Heart, etc?

A. It does imply the supremacy, ardency and activity of our Love, whereby we
choose the Lord, cleave to him, and delight in him as our chief Good, and employ
all our faculties and powers in his service, in obedience to him out of Love.

Q. What is the sum of the second Table of the Law?

A. To love our Neighbor as our selves.

Q Who is our Neighbor?

A. Every man, Luke 10. 29, -- 38.

Q. What is it to love our Neighbor as our selves?

A. To love him with the same truth and constancy of Love, as we do our selves.

Q. But are we not bound to love our Neighbor with the same Degree of Love, as
we do our selves?

A. No.

Q. 43. What is the Preface to the ten Commandments?

A. The Preface to the ten Commandments is in these words [I am the Lord thy
God which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of
Bondage.]

Q. 44. What does the Preface to the ten Commandments teach us?

A. The Preface to the ten Commandments teaches us, that because God is the
Lord, and our God and Redeemer, therefore we are bound to keep all his
Commandments.

Explic. Q. How many reasons or arguments are there in the Preface to oblige
and persuade us to keep all Gods Commandments?

A. Two,

1. God is the Lord. [ I am the Lord.]

2. God is our God and Redeemer. [I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee
out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of Bondage.]

Q. How are we bound and obliged to keep Gods Commandments, as he is the Lord?

A. As he is the Lord, he is our Creator and supreme Sovereign, and we owe him
obedience, as we are his Creatures and Subjects Rev. 4. 11 Psa. 100. 2, ^ Jer.
10. 7
.

Q. You say you owe God obedience as you are his Creatures and Subjects, what
mean you thereby?

A. We mean that once we were not, were made, and are preserved by God, or that
we derived our Being from, an^ hold it of God, and that we are und^^ the
unlimited and absolute Dominion and Sovereignty of God, and therefore ought to
serve and glorify God in (...) Body, and in our Spirit, which (...) Gods, and
to be in perfect subjection (...) the Laws of Heaven.

Q. How are we bound and obliged (...) keep Gods Commandments as he is our God
and Redeemer?

A. As our God and Redeemer [our Father and Benefactor] he has brought us into
the special relation of Children to himself, and has entered into Covenan^^^
with us to bring us out of spiritual Egypt* and Bondage under sin, as he
brought his people of old out of the earthly Egypt* and the Bondage of men Exodus
4. 22, 23 John 8. 34, 36 Deu. 10. 22 and 11. 1 1 Cor. 6. 20 Luke 1. 74, 75
.

These two Rules must be learned for the understanding of the Commandments.

Rule 1. That when any sin is forbidden, the contrary Duty is required and when
any Duty is required, the contrary sin is forbidden.

Rule 2. That where any sin is forbidden, all the Kinds and Degrees of it,
temptations and incentments to it are likewise forbidden; and when any Duty is
required, all the kinds, and the highest perfection of it, together with all
the means and helps to it, are also required.

Q. 45. What is the first Commandment?

A. The first Commandment is, [Thou shall have no other Gods before me.]

Q. 46. What is required in the first Commandment?

.

Q. What is the third Duty required (...) this Commandment?

A. To worship and glorify God accordingly.

Q How is that?

A. As the only true God and our God.

Q. Are we required to worship God with the inward worship of the mind, viz.
(...) trust in him, and to love, fear, esteem, desire, and obey him?

A. Yes Joh. 4 24 Isa. 26. 4 Deuteronomy. 6. 13 and 10. 12 Psalm. 73. 25 Isa. 26. 38, 9
1 Samuel 15. 22
.

Q. And with the outward worship also*

A. Yes 1 Cor. 6. 20 Psalm. 95. 6
.

Q. What do you mean by outward worship?

A. The expressing the inward worship of the mind in our Faith, Love, and
obedience toward God, by the reverte^ performance of all external acts of
divine worship commanded by him, and more especially by our daily Prayer^ unto
him, and praises of him Ps. 55. 17 and 32. 6 P^al. 50. 14, 15 23. and 51. 18, 19
.

Q. Does the first Commandment determine of the only right object of divine
worship, or whom only we must serve?

A. Yes, Mat 4. 10.

Q. 47. What is forbidden in the first Commandment?

A. The first Commandment forbids the denying or not worshipping and
glorifying the true God, as God, and our God, and the giving that worship and
glory to any other, which is due to him alone.

Explic. Q. What are the chief sins forbidden in the first Commandment?

A. 1. Atheism, which is the denying any God, or the true God Psalm. 14. 1 Ephesians.
2. 12
.

2. Idolatry, which is,

1. The not worshipping and glorifying the true God Gal. 4. 8
. The which we do, 1. If we do not worship him as God Romans 1. 21, 23
. Or, 2. Not as our God Ps. 81. 8, 9, 10, 11
.

2. The giving that worship and glory to any other which is due to him alone
Romans 1. 25
.

Q. It is Idolatry to give outward worship to any other, viz. to pray to
Saints, or Angels, or any Creature?

A. Yes. Rev. 22. 8, 9
.

Q. And is it Idolatry to give inward worship to any other, viz. to Love, Fear,
Desire, or Trust in any thing more than God?

A. Yes Col. 3. 5
.

Q. Why so.

A. Because hereby is given that worship and glory to another which is due to
God alone, Romans 1. 25. Ibid.

Q. 48. What are we especially taught by these words [ before me] in the first
Commandment?

A. These words, before me, in the first Commandment, teach us, that God who
sees all things, takes notice of, and is much displeased with the sin of
having any other God.

Explic. Q. What things are to be learned from these words [ before me?]

A. Two things,

1. That God sees all things Heb. 4. 13 Jer. 23. 24 Psalm. 147. 5
.

2. That God takes notice of, and is much displeased with the sin of having
any other God Psalm. 44. 20, 21 Isa. 42. 8
.

Q. 49. Which is the second Commandment?

A. The second Commandment is, [Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image,
or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the Earth; Thou shall not bow down thy
self unto them, nor serve them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third and
fourth Generation of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my Commandments.

Q. 50. What is required in the second Commandment?

A. The Second Commandment requires the receiving, observing, and keeping pure
and entire, all such religious Worship and Ordinances as God has appointed in
his Word.

Explic. Q. How does the worship, required in the second Commandment, differ
from the worship required in the first?

A. The worship required in the first Commandment has a respect unto the
object of worship, whereby we are bound to worship the true God, and none else:
The worship required in the second has a respect unto the means and manner of
worship, whereby we are bound to worship God according to the way and means of
his own appointment.

Q. What is the way and means which God has appointed for his worship?

A. The only way and means which God has appointed for his worship, is his
Ordinances which he has prescribed in his Word.

Q. What Ordinances?

A. 1. Pr^yer unto God with thanksgiving, and that 1 Timothy 2. 1. Luke 1. 9, 10,
13. Phil. 4. 6. Ephesians. 5. 20. Matthew. 21. 13. Luke 2. 37.
publicly in Assemblies, Ier. 10. 25. Acts 10. 2.
privately in Families, and Matthew. 6 6.
secretly in Closets.

2. Reading and searching the Scriptures. 1 Timothy 4. 13. Ioh. 5. 39. Neh. 8. 8.
Acts 15. 21.

4. Singing of Psalms. Psalm. 149. 1. Iam. 5. 13.

5. Administration, and receiving of the Sacraments both of Baptism, and the
Lords Supper. Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23, -- 26.

6. Fasting. Joel 2. 12. Esther 4. 3, 16. 1 Kings 21. 27, 28, 29. 1 Samuel 7. 6,
10. Ionab 3. 5, 10. Luke 5. 35.

7. Instruction of Children and Households in the way of the Lord. Genesis 18. 19.
Deuteronomy. 6. 6, -- 10. Ephesians. 6. 4.

8. Holy Conference, and Religious Discourse. Mal. 3. 16. Luke 24. 17, 32.

12. Exercise of Church Discipline. 1 Cor. 5. 3, 4, 5, 11. with 2 Cor. 2 6, 7,
8. Mat. 18. 18.

Q. What does God require in the second Commandment, in reference to his
Ordinances and means of worship?

A. He requires the receiving, observing, and keeping of them pure and entire.

Q. What is it to receive and observe Gods Worship and Ordinances?

A. To receive and observe them is heartily to entertain, embrace, and attend
on them as often as opportunity is offered, and to make answerable improvement of
them.

Q. What is it to keep them pure and entire?

A. To take diligent heed that they be not corrupted by our own inventions and
additions Mat. 15. 9 Deuteronomy. 12. 32
.

Q. How know you what Worship, and Ordinances God has required?

A. God has appointed all his worsh'p and Ordinances in his Word.

Q. 51. What is forbidden in the second Commandment?

A. The second Commandment forbideth the worshipping of God by Images or any
other way not appointed in his Word.

Explie. Q. What are the chief sins forbidden in this Commandment?

A. Idolatry and Superstition.

Q. Is it Idolatry, not only to worship Idols instead of God, which is
forbidden in the first Commandment, but also to worship God by Images?

A. Yes Isa. 45. 20 Exodus 32. 4, 5 Deuteronomy. 4. 15, -- 19 with 32. 5, 17, 21
.

Q. How can persons be guilty of Idolatry in worshipping God by Images, when
they worship the true God* the God that made the Heavens and the Earth?

A. Because the Images of these men, either do bear resemblance to the object
of their worship, or they do not; If they do, then they worship false Gods, and
are guilty of gross Idolatry, there being no similitude or likeness of the true
God; If they do not, then is ignorance the Mother of that D^ votion, and with
the Samaritans they worship they know not what: Or if they do worship the true
God, they worship him ignorantly, and know not the manner of the God that made
the Heavens and the Earth. Deuteronomy. 4. 12, 15. Isa. 40. 18. Ioh. 4. 22. Acts 17.
23. 2 Kings* 7. 26.

Q. Why can there be no manner of similitude of the true God?

A. Because he dwells not in Temples made with hands, and is the
unapproachable invisible God. Acts 17. 24. 1 Timothy 6. 16.

Q. The Papists worship God by Images, the Protestants worship God without
them; which way therefore are we to worship the true God?

A. The way, the only infallible Judge of Controversies has declared unto us.

Q. Is the Pope this infallible Judge?

A. There is no infallible Judge upon Earth, and the Pope being but the H^ad of
a Party, the supreme Head of the Romanists; neither he nor they can be Judge in
their own Cause. Iam. 4. 12. Mat. 23. 9, 10. Prove. 18. 17.

Q. Who then is the infallible Judge of Controversies?

A. Christ, the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, He is
the only infallible Judge of Controversies, who has told us all things, and w^
have his Determinations upon Record Joh. 118 and 4. 25
.

Q. Where are his Determinations Recorded?

A. In the holy Scriptures.

Q. What are his Determinations concerning God, and the manner of his worship?

A. They are,

1. Negative, that God dwells not in Temples, neither is to be worshipped by
Images made with men's hands. Acts 17. 1 Cor. 7. 10
24. with 1 Kings 8. 27. Acts 17. 25.

2. They are affirmative, viz. That God is a Spirit, and that they that worship
him, must worship him in Spirit and truth. Ioh. 4. 23 24.

Q What other sin is chiefly forbidden in this Commandment?

A. Superstition.

Q. What is Superstition?

A. Superstition in the proper and strict notion of the word is the worshipping
of Idols, or dead men, Act. 17. 22. But this is the same with that Idolatry,
(the giving that worship and glory to others which is due to God alone) which
is forbidden in the first Commandment.

Q. What is therefore Superstition in the (...) generally received notion, and
as it is forbidden in this Commandment?

A. It is when things are either abhorred or observed with a zealous or
fearful, but erroneous relation to God: by means of which the superstitious
serve either the true God with needless Offices, or defraud him of necessary
Duties; or bestow such honors and service upon others, as is proper for, and
should be peculiar for him only. Or, More plainly thus,

It is the worshipping of God in any other way, or by any other means than what
he has appointed in his Word; called Ordinances, the Commandments and
Doctrines of men Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23
.

Q. How manifold is this Superstition?

A. Twofold, Affirmative, and Negative.

Q. What is Affirmative Superstition?

A. That whereby the Superstitious serve the true God with needless Offices.

Q. And what the Negative?

A. That whereby men out of a s^^^pulous Conscience, or ignorant fear of
displeasing God, abstain from things lawful and laudable, as sinful and ungodly.

Q. Does the Scripture warrant this distinction?

A. Yes Eccl. 7. 16, 17 Mat. 15. 3, 6, 7 Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23
.

Q. 1. What is the Idolatry and Superstition of the Church of Rome?

A. The worshipping of the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, out of a false and
groundless persuasion, that they are substantially changed into the Body and
Blood of Christ.

2. The worshipping and invocation of Saints and Angels; and particularly of
the Virgin Mary, which has now for some Ages been a principal part of their
Religion.

3. Their worshipping of Images: Which practice (notwithstanding all their
distinctions about it, which are no other but what the Heathens used in the
same case) flies as full in the face of the second Commandment, as deliberate
and malicious killing of a man is against the six^h. Acts 17. 29. Romans 1. 23.

4. Their superstitious Fasting, and ab staining from Flesh in Lent; Their
superstitious Holy Days; Their adding Cream, Oil, and Spittle to the water in
Baptism, and their Baptizing of Bells; Their praying upon Beads, and mary more
superstitious customs! For which there is not the least command in the
Scriptures Cor. 18. 8 Col. 2. 20, 21 1 Timothy 4. 4, 5 Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11 P^o. 30.
5, 6 Mat. 28. 19, 20
.

Q. What if the Doctrine of Transubstantiation be not true?

A. Then by the confession of several of their own learned Writers they are
guilty of gross Idolatry.

Q. Does not the Bread in the Communion remain Bread after the words of
Consecration?

A. Yes, the Scripture expressly calls it so after the words of Consecration. 1
Cor. 11. 26, 27, 28.

Q. But what if the Bread be transubstanti^te and turned into the very Body of
Christ?

A. Then all men's senses are deceived in a plain sensible matter, wherein it is
as hard for them to be deceived, as in any thing in the world.

Q. Why so?

A. For two things can hardly be imagined more different, a little bit of
Wa^er, and the whole Body of ^ man.

Q. But what if the Testimony of sens^ be not to be relied upon?

A. Then no man is sure that Christian^ty it self is true.

Q. Why so?

A. For the utmost assurance that the Apostles had of the Truth of
Christianity, was the Testimony of their own senses concerning our Saviors
Miracles.

Q. And what if the Testimony of sense (...) to be relied upon?

A. Then it plainly follows that no man (no, not the Apostles themselves) had
more reason to believe Christianity to be true, than every man has to believe
Transubstantiation to be false.

Q. But if the case be so plain, a man would think that at least the Teachers
and Guides of that Church should be sensible of it?

A. Why, they are so, and afraid the People should be so too; and therefore by
their corrupt Glosses and Ph^risai^al Traditions in their interpreting the holy
Scriptures, they tie up and keep the People in ignorance of the true meaning of
those places, which do more expressly condemn their damnable Idolatrous
practices, and their superstitious customs; and in their ordinary Ca^^chisms
and Manuals of Devotion, they leave out the second Commandment, and divide the
tenth into two to make up the Number; lest if the common people should know it,
their Consciences should startle at the doing of a thing so directly contrary
to the plain command of God.

Q. And is it not well observed by the learned from Deuteronomy. 11. 28. That he that
professes Idolatry, is as if he denied the whole Law?

A. Yes.

Q. But because after all the unanswerable Objections and Arguments of the
Protestants against Transubstantiation, (that Monster and shame of humane
nature) and the other Blasphenies and absurd Doctrines of the Papists; they do
all unanimously betake themselves to the authority of their Church, as their
main and last Refuge; and tell us, that though they cannot give us a particular
reason of every Doctrine they hold different from us; yet they have sufficient
reason to submit their judgment wholly to their Churches authority, which they
know to be infallible, and has Decreed all the Doctrines they hold in
opposition to (...) Does it not therefore concern all that ^ concerned in the
matters of their Salvation to consider whether this easy way of believing be a
safe way or no?

A. Yes, it does very much concern (...) all so to do; because our mistake
herein will greatly hazard our everlasting Salvation.

Q. And are not they certainly mistaken that adventure all, even all their
everlasting concerns, upon that authority which overthrows those very things
which must be supposed antecedent to the belief of any such authority: As 1.
The common sense of mankind. 2. The force of a Divine Law. And 3. The liberty
of Judgment concerning truth and falsehood?

A. Yes.

Q. And does not the Church of Rome so?

A. Yes, and thereby forfeits its own authority over men.

1. It requires things contrary to common sense; as in the Eucharist, it
requires all its members to deny what they see, and handle, and smell, and
taste to be Bread, to be true Bread; and to believe that the same individual
Body may be in a thousand places at once, and that things whose nature it is to
be in another, (...) subsist without their proper subject.

2. It requires things contrary to the force and reason of a divine Law; as it
has left out the second Commandment, and has made it lawful to give religious
worship to Images, and has taken away from the people their share of the Cup
in the Eucharist.

3. It takes away all liberty of judgment concerning truth and falsehood in
Religion. For this is a natural right which every man has to judge for
himself: And they that take this away, may as well command all men to put out
their eyes, that they may the better follow their Guides. But the other is so
much worse, because it is an assault upon our understandings; it is a robbing
us of the greatest Talent God has committed to our management, it is a Rape
upon our best faculties, and prostituting them to the Lusts of spiritual
Tyrants; it is not captivating our understandings to the obedience of Faith,
but enslaving them to the proud and domineering usurpations of men; wherein
they would do by us as the Philistines did by Sampson; they would put our eyes,
that we might g^ind in their Prison, and make them sport.

Q. How may men further offend and sin against the second Commandment?

A. Men offend and sin against the second Commandment not only by Idolatry and
Superstition, but also when they are not zealous Joh. 2. 17 and 4. 22, 23
for pure worship according to Gods Institution, not endeavoring what in them
lies, in their places, the Reformation of worship, according to the pattern in
the Word; as also when they disuse and He. 10. 25
neglect, especially Luke 7. 30 Mat. 23. 13 1 These. 2. 16 Acts 13. 44, 45
when they contemn and oppose any of those Ordinances which God has appointed
to be the means of worship.

Q. 52. What are the reasons annexed to the se^ond Commandment?

A. The reasons annexed to the second Commandment, are Gods Sovereignty over
us, his propriety in us, and the zeal he has to his own worship.

Explic. Q. In what words are these three reasons annexed to this Commandment,
expressed?

A. In these words [For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God?]

Q. What is the first reason annexed unto the second Commandment?

A. Gods Sovereignty over us, expressed in these words [ I the Lord.]

Q. What do you mean by his Sovereignty over us?

A. His supreme power, absolute Dominion, and sole Authority over us.

Q. What is the force of this first reason?

A. The force of this first reason, is, because God is the only Sovereign Ps.
95. 2, 3
King over us, and has the sole Authority to make Laws for the way of his
worship, therefore we ought by virtue of our allegiance, as we are subjects, to
observe his Laws and Ordinances, and to worship him no other way than that
which he has appointed in his Word.

Q. What is the second reason annexed to this Commandment?

A. Gods propriety in us, expressed in these words, [ Thy God; I the Lord thy
God.]

Q. What do you mean by his propriety in us?

A. His just right and Title to us as his own.

Q. What is the force of this second reason?

A. The force of this second reason, is, because we are Gods, therefore we
ought to keep close unto him, and his appointments, and take heed especially of
Idolatry and superstition, which do alienate the heart from him Ps. 95. 6, 7
and 106. 19. -- 22 and 45. 10, 11
.

Q. What is the third reason annexed to this Commandment?

A. The zeal God has to his own worship, expressed in these words [ Am ^ jealous
God; I the Lord thy God am a jealous God Exodus 34. 14
.]

Q. What is the zeal God has to his own worship.

A. It is his jealousy, where by out of love to his own worship and
Institutions, he is highly offended with those that turn aside from him unto
their own Inventions.

Q Wherein does this zeal and jealousy of God for his own worship show it self?

A. The zeal and jealousy of God for his own worship does show it self,

1. In his accounting the Breakers of this Commandment those that hate him, and
threatening to punish them unto the third and fourth Generation; [I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the
Children unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me.] And,

2. In his esteeming the keepers of this Commandment, such as love him, and
promising mercies unto thousands of them [ And showing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my Commandments.]

Q. How can God in justice visit the iniquity of the Fathers upon their
Children?

A. 1. If the Children do not walk in the sinful steps of their Fathers, God
will not visit the iniquity of their Fathers upon them Ezekiel. 18. 14, 15, 16, 17
.

2. It is most equal and righteous for God to visit the iniquity of the Fathers
upon their Children, when the Children are guilty of the same iniquity, and so
fill up the measure of their Fathers sins Ezekiel. 18. 24, 25 Man. 23. 31, -- 37
. [By consenting to, partaking of, and imitating their Fathers sins.]

Q. 53. What is the third Commandment?

A. The third Commandment, is, [Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy
God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless, that takes his Name in
vain.]

Q. 54. What is required in the third Commandment?

A. The third Commandment requires the holy and reverend use of Gods Names,

The careless performance of the duties of the day, when men neither do the

fears, nor are servent in Spirit serving the Lord. 2. Profaneness, or the

7. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. with 1 Cor. 7. 6, 10, 12, 25. 4.

Q 82. Is any man able to keep the Commandment of God?

A No mere man since the Fall is able in this life perfectly to keep the

, word James 3. 6, etc. To. 3. 13, 14
and deed Ps. 130. 3 Romans 3. 12, 15, etc.
.

Q. If this be true, must not that doctrine of the Papists and others be false,
that teaches perfection attainable in this life, and that men may do works of
supererogation, and that good works are meritorious?

A. Yes, this their proud, and self-advancing Doctrine must needs be false.

Q. But what do you mean by that perfection, which is not attainable in this

Mary?

A. No Romans 3 9, 10, 19, 23
.

5 Genesis 20. 6 1 Chronicles. 29. 14 Ps. 119. 136
.

^. Because all such works are Debts Luke 17. 10 Romans 6. 22
to be paid, and not gifts offered up unto God.

3. Because they bear no proportion to the reward to be received Ma^k 10. 29,
30 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18 Heb. 11* 25, 26
.

Q Can works of Supererogation consist with the imperfection of our works?

A. No.

Q. If no man can merit by his works for himself, can he communicate to another
that which he has not himself?

A. No.

Q. Is there therefore nothing in the Churches treasury superabundant for those
that do not abound in every good work themselves?

A. No.

Q. 83. Are all transgressions of the Law equally heinous?

A. Some sins in themselves, and by reason of several aggravations are more
heinous in the sight of God than others.

Explic. Q Are some sins more heinous in the sight of God than others?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you mean by more heinous?

A. More grievous, and more offensive.

Q. How many ways may some sins be more grievous and heinous than others?

A. Two ways; 1. In themselves and of their own nature. 2. By reason of their
aggravations.

Q. What do you mean by the aggravations of sins?

A. Such additional circumstances which make them more provoking in the sight
of God than otherwise they would be.

Q. And are some sins in themselves, or of their own nature more heinous than
others?

A. Yes. 1. The highest sins against the first Table are more heinous than the
highest against the second Table Mat. 22. 36 1 Samuel 8. 7, 8 and 2. 25
. And,

2. Wilful presumptuous sins are more heinous than sins of infirmity Heb. 10.
26 with 1 Timothy 1. 13 Ps. 19. 12, 13
, sins against knowledge than those of ignorance Luke 12. 47, 48
, sins ripened into action, than sins begun in the thoughts Jam. 1. 15 Mat. 21.
28, etc. Genesis 20. 3, etc.
, and sins of custom and deliberation, than those committed through some sudden
passion and iustant force of temptation 1 Samuel 2. 12, 13, 17. with 2 Samuel 6 6,
7 Prove. 7. 5, etc. with Genesis 34 1, etc. 2 Samuel 15^ 10, 11
.

Q. And are sins likewise by reason of their several aggravations more heinous
in the sight of God than otherwise they would be?

A. Yes, sins are more heinous than otherwise they would be by their
aggravating heightening circumstances, viz. from the time 2 Chronicles. 28. 22.
when, the place where Isa. 26. 10. Psalm. 106. 7.
, the manner 1 Kings 21. 9, 10. 2 Samuel 3. 27.
in which, the means Dan. 8. 24, 25. Judge. 9. 4, 5. 2 Kings 8. 15. 2 Chronicles. 13.
6, 8. with 1 Kings 12. 28.
by which, the reason Hos. 5. 1. Psalm. 37. 7, 8.
why, the person by whom 2 Samuel 12. 7, 8, 9. Ezekiel. 8. 11, 12. Mich. 3. 5. Romans
2. 23, 24, 25.
, and the person against whom they were committed 2 Samuel 16. 22. and 1. 14,
etc. and 4. 9. etc. 2 Chronicles. 36. 16.
.

Q. 84. What does every sin deserve?

A. Every sin deserves Gods wrath and curse, both in this life and that which
is to come.

Explic. Q. But though some sins are more heinous than others, yet are there
any sins so small that deserve not Gods wrath and curse, both here and
hereafter?

A. No. Ephesians. 2. 3. Deuteronomy. 28. 15, etc. Gal. 3. 10. Matthew. 25. 41. Romans 2. 5 6,
8, 9.

Q. The Papists have a distinction of mortal and venial sins: by mortal they
mean such as are in their own nature damnable and deserve eternal death, viz.
Perjury, Murder and Adultery, or those seven in the Popish Catechism, Pride,
Covetousness, Lusts, Anger, Gluttony, Envy and Sloth; by Venial they mean such
as are in their own nature pardonable and deserve not everlasting punishments,
viz. Concupiscence, sudden passions of the mind and such like; Does the
Scripture warrant this distinction of theirs?

A. No. 1. The Scripture teaches us, first, that the curse of God is due to
every one that breaks the least of Gods Commandments Gal. 3. 10
. 2. That the wages of sin (indiscriminatively, without any difference) is
death. And such a death that is opposed to eternal life Romans 6. 23
. And we must not distinguish where the Law it self does not distinguish. 3.
That for every idle word that men speak, they shall give an account thereof in
the day of Judgment, and that by such words (if not repented of) they shall be
condemned, Mat. 12. 36, 37. And on the contrary, that the forementioned mortal
sins in the Popish sense, have been, and shall be forgiven to all penitent
Believers to whom by virtue of the New Covenant all such sins are become
venial. 2 Samuel 12. 9, 13. Mat. 26. 74, 75. Luke 22. 32. Mark 16. 7. 1 Cor. 6.
9, 10, 11.

Q. 85. What does God require of us that we may escape his wrath and curse due
to us for sin?

A. To escape the wrath and curse of God due to us ^or sin, God requires of us
Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance unto life, with the diligent use of all
outward means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of Redemption.

Explic. Q. Is there any way to escape the wrath and curse of God?

A. Yes. Heb. 10. 19 20.

Q Is there any thing required on our part to escape them?

A. Yes, Faith, Repentance, and the diligent use of the means of Grace.

Q. And does God require Repentance, and Faith of us; or has Christ repented
and believed for us?

A. He requires them of us Joh. 6. 29 1 John 3. 23 John 3 26 Acts 17. 30 Acts
2 38 Mat. 3. 2 Mark 1. 14, 15 Act. 16. 30, 31 and 5. 31 and 20. 21
.

Q. Why so?

A. Because Christ had no need of Repentance and Faith, being without sin. Luke
1. 35. John 8. 46. 1 Pet. 2. 22. John 9. 30, -- 34. Heb. 7. 26. Mat. 27. 19.
Luke 23. 14, 15. John 19. 4, etc. Acts 3. 13, 14. and 7. 52. and 22. 14. 1 Pet.
3. 18. Mat. 1. 21. John 1. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Isa. 53. 4, 5, 6.

Q. Who communicates to us the works of Red^mption?

A. Christ that purchased them, conveighs and communicates them to us. Gal. 3.
13. Romans 3. 24, 25, 26. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Acts 2. 36. Tit. 2. 14.

Q. Does Christ communicate his benefits by means, or without means?

A. By means Ezekiel 36. 37 Acts 9. 10, etc. To. 10. 13, 14, 15, 17 Cant. 3. 1, --
5 1 Cor. 1. 21 Acts 8. 22 Jer. 6. 16
.

Q. What kind of use must we make of the means?

A. A di^igent use Joh. 5. 39 Acts 17. 11, 12 with Prove. 2. 1, -- 6 and 8. 34
.

Q. Why does God require of us Faith and Repentance, and the diligent use of
all the outward means?

A. That we may escape his wrath and curse due to us for sin.

Q. 86. What is Faith in Jesus Christ?

A. Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon
him alone for Salvation, as he is offered to us in the Gospel.

Explic. Q Why call you Faith in Jesus Christ a grace?

A. 1. Because it is not from nature Mat. 16. 16, 17
.

2. Because it is given, and wrought of free grace Ephesians. 2. 8
.

Q. Why call you Faith a saving Grace?

A. Because where it is truly wrought, it brings the person in whom it is to
Salvation Heb. 10. 39
.

Q Does it not then much concern us to know what this Faith is, and to labor
after it, when we cannot be saved without it?

A. Yes.

Q. 1. Is this Faith only the believing that Christ died for sinners?

A. No, for the Devils and Damned in H^ll believe this.

Q. 2. Or is it an implicit Faith, or a blind Faith (which the Popish Doctors
persuade the people to rest in) to believe as the Church believes, though they
know not what the Church believes?

A. No.

Q. Why so?

A. 1. Because, to believe as the Church believes, when we know not what the
Church believes, is to put out our own eyes that we may take a Guide; and if by
the Church must be understood the Church of Rome, it is to take such a Guide as
A blind G^i^e, or a Seducer. Mat. 15. 14 1 John 4. 2 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3 2 These.
2. 7, -- 13
either cannot, or will not guide us aright: which is in effect to refuse our
own mercies, and to run an unnecessary hazard of our eternal Salvation.

Q. How do we by an implicit Faith in the Church of Rome refuse our own
mercies?

A. Because without personal knowledge, denied us by that corrupt Church,
(which yet God has given us for this very end, to make the true Religion
judicially our own) all the Ordinances of God, viz. our Praying, Singing,
Reading 1 Cor. 14. 14, 15.
and Hearing the Word of God Acts 8. 30, -- 36. Neh. 8. 8. Romans 10. 14, 17.
Acts 28 25 -- 29.
, Catechizing Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7. Ephesians. 6. 4. Prove. 22. 6. 1 Samuel 1. 24. Luke 2.
42, 46. with Exodus 13. 12.
, Meditating I^sh. 1. 8. Psalm. 1. 2. and 119. 79 -- 101. and 77. 12. and 143 5.
, holy Conferences Mal. 3. 16. Heb. 3. 13 Luke 24. 32.
, and receiving the Sacraments Mat. 28. 19, 20. with Acts 19. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 11.
28, 29.
, will be altogether unprofitable to us and in vai^.

Q. And how do we hazard our eternal Salvation by it?

A. Because we do hereby follow the pernicious ways of that Adulterated Church
which holds such doctrines that do very much endanger it Mat. 15. 3, 6, 9 Col.
2. 20, 21, 22, 23 1 Cor. 6. 9 with 5. 11 Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21
.

Q. What other reason have you to prove that this blind implicit Faith is not
a justifying and saving Faith?

A. 2. Because it secludes that knowledge which is a necessary ingredient
incorporate into the very nature and essence of true saving Faith. Isa. 53. 11.
Ioh. 17. 3. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. Acts 26 18. Romans 10. 9. 2 Timothy 1. 12. 1 Pet. 3. 15.

Q. 3. Is this justifying saving Faith a keeping of the Commandments of God, or
obedience to his Laws, as Socinians affirm?

A. No. 1. Because obedience is the fruit and effect of Faith Rom, 16. 26
.

2. Because union with Christ, Justification and Adoption are the fruits of
Faith, and not of works or obedience Ephesians. 3. 17 Romans 5. 1 John 1. 12
.

Q. 4. Is this saving justifying Faith a full persuasion of the heart, or an
assurance that our sins are pardoned and that our souls shall be saved?

A. No, because we must be justified and pardoned before we can believe that we
are justified and pardoned, else we should believe a Lie.

Q. What then is this true saving Faith?

A. It is our hearty accepting, receiving and resting upon Christ alone for
Salvation, as he is offered to us in the Gospel John 6. 67, 68, 69 Heb. 11. 1,
24, 25, 26 John 1. 12 Cant. 8. 5 Isa. 26. 3, 4 Gal. 2. 16
.

Q. Is Christ offered to us in the Gospel as our Prophet, Priest and King?

A. Yes. Isa. 33. 22.

Q And is it not true Faith except we take Christ as a Prophet to be guided, as
a King to be ruled, and as a Priest to be saved by him alone?

A. No. Acts 3. 22. John 14 26. and 16. 14 Heb. 7. 21, etc. Acts 2. 36. 1 Timothy
6. 14 15. Mat. 2. 2. John 1. 49. Zach. 9. 9. Luke 19. 37, 38.

Q. 87. What is Repentance unto life?

A Repentance unto life is a saving grace whereby a sinner out of a true sense
of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, does with grief and
hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor
after new obedience.

Explic. Q. What Repentance is here descri^ed?

A. Repentance unto life.

Q. Why is it so called?

A. Because it brings the person in whom it is to Eternal Life Act. 11. 18
.

Q. Why is it called a saving grace?

A. For the same reason, viz. because where Repentance is truly wrought, it
brings the person in whom it is unto Salvation 2 Cor. 7. 10
.

Q. What is that which is wrought in sinners as a preparation to Repentance?

A. A true sense of sin Acts 2. 37
.

Q. What mean you by that?

A. Such a sight of sin, as deeply affects our hearts with godly sorrow for it.

Q. What is the main motive to Repentance?

A. The apprehension of Gods mercy in Christ Joel 2. 12, 19 Exo. 34 6, 7 Romans
2. 4 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19
.

Q. Can there be no true Repentance without conviction, a true sight and
discovery of sin?

A. No M^t. 9. 12, 13
.

Q. Will it be Despair and not Repentance, except together with the sight of
sin, there be an apprehension (at least of a possibility) of mercy?

A. Yes. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Mat. 27. 4. 5.

Q. In and through whom does the penitent sinner apprehend Gods mercy?

A. In and through Christ only.

Q. Does true Repentance chiefly consist in turning from sin to God?

A. Yes Acts 26 18 Jer. 31. 18. 19
.

Q. How does the repenting sinner turn from sin?

A. With an holy indignation 2 Cor. ^. 11
against it, and with that grief and hatred of it, so as never more to return
Jer. 31. 18, 19 Ez^k. 36. 31 2 Cor. 7. 11 Job 42. 6 and 11. 14 Isa. 30. 22 Hos.
14. 8
to it.

Q. And how does he turn to God?

A. With full purpose of, and endeavor after new obedience. Acts 11. 23. 1
Kings 8. 47, 48. 2 Kings 23. 3. Romans 6. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Ephesians. 4. 23, 24. Psa.
119. 6, 20.

Q. What do you mean by new obedience?

A. The penitent sinners denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and his living
soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.

Q. Is not the confessing sins to God alone, and the forsaking them sufficient
without auricular confession?

A. Yes. Prove. 28. 13.

Q. When is the confessing our faults one to another necessary?

A. 1. When our offenses are such as are not only against God, but also against
our Neighbors; then we must confess our faults to them, desire peace, and make
them satisfaction before we can reasonably expect Gods acceptance of our
persons and services Mat. 5. 23, 24
.

2. When we are not well able to judge of our selves, to discern our own
guilts, and to take the dimensions of our faults aright, laboring under the
horror, agony and disquiet of Conscience; then it is necessary to go to some
discreet and learned Minister, to confess our faults, and to open our griefs to
him, that we may receive such spiritual counsel, advice, and comfort, as our
Consciences may be relieved; and that by the Ministry of Gods Word we may
receive comfort, and the benefit of Absolution, to the quieting of our
Consciences, and avoiding of all scruple of doubtfulness.

Q But what do you think of the Auricular Confession of sin according to the
Doctrine of the Papists; who say, that it is necessary for every Christian to
search and examine with greatest diligence what his sins have been, and that he
is bound upon pain of Damnation to confess all his mortal sins unto a Priest,
even his most secret sins in heart and thought, with all the considerable
circumstances of them: Is not this a cursed adding to the Word of God, and that
in matters necessary to Salvation?

A. Yes.

Q And is not this the lading the people with ourdens grievous to be born,
which the Priests themselves touch not with one of their fingers?

A. Yes.

Q. May not an Hypocrite and a graceless (...) thus confess his sins to the
Priest?

A. Yes.

Q. And can this confession then be so necessary a part of true Repentance,
which a man may do that never unfeignedly repented?

A. No.

Q 88. What are the outward means whereby Christ communicates to us the
benefits of Redemption?

A. The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the
benefits of Redemption, are his Ordinances, especially the Word, Sacraments and
Prayer; all which are effectual to the Elect for Salvation.

Explic. Q. Are Christ's Ordinances the means whereby he communicates to us the
benefits of Redemption?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you mean by Christ's Ordinances?

A. The means and ways of worship, ordained by him.

Q. What are his special Ordinances whereby he communicates to us his benefits?

A. The Word, Sacraments and Prayer Act 2 41, 42
.

Q. What kind of means are these?

A. The outward and ordinary means.

Q. Why are the Ordinances called the outward means?

A. Because together with them, he communicates his benefits by the inward
workings of his Pro. 1. 23 Isa 59. 21 Joh. 14 26 Ephesians. 1. 19, 20 and Heb. 13 20,
21 Phi^. 2. 12, 13
Spirit.

Q. And why are the Ordinances of Christ called the ordinary means, whereby he
communicates his benefits to us?

A. Because he has not wholly limited and bound up himself to his Ordinances,
but can communicate his benefits in an extraordinary way, when, and to whom he
pleases.

Q. But may men reasonably expect Salvation without the diligent use of the
outward and ordinary means?

A. No. Romans 10. 13, 17. Mat. 3. 7. Acts 2. 38, 39, 41. and 16. 30, -- 35.

Q. To whom are the outward and ordinary means made effectual for Salvation?

A. To the Elect Romans 1. 16 and 11. 7 Acts 13. 46, 48
.

Q. 89. How is the Word made effectual to Salvation?

A. The Spirit of God makes the Reading, but especially the Preaching of the
Word, an effectual means of convincing and converting sinners, and of building
them up in holiness and comfort through Faith unto Salvation.

Explic. Q. Who is it that makes the Word effectual to Salvation?

A. The Spirit of God Joh 14. 26 and 16. 7 etc. 1 Cor. 3. 10
.

Q. In what kind of exercise of the Word does the Spirit use to make it
effectual?

A. In the Reading, but especially in the Preaching of the Word.

Q. Will not the Word be effectual without the inward workings of the Spirit?
Romans 1. 16 2 Timothy 3. 15 1 Cor. 1. 18


A. No. Ephesians. 2. 17, 18, 22. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Jude verse. 19. 1 These. 5. 19, 20.
and 2. 2, 13.

Q. How is the Word effectual to sinners?

A. To convince and convert them; showing them their woeful and undone estate in
themselves without Christ, and turning them from sin unto God 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25
Acts 26. 18 Romans 7. 9 Psalm. 19. 7
.

Q. How is it made effectual to the Saints?

A. To build them Act. 20. 32 Jude 20 Joh. 17. 17 Romans 154
up in holiness and comfort.

Q To what does the Word thus build them up?

A. To Salvation.

Q. Through what means?

A. Through Faith, 2 Timothy 3. 15.

Q. Will not the Word profit us then, except it be mixed with Faith?

A. No. Heb 4. 2.

Q Is the Conviction, Conversion, Sanctification and Consolation of sinners,
the work of the Spirit, by the Word, through Faith?

A. Yes.

Q 90. How is the W^rd to be read and heard that it may become effectual to
Salvation?

A. That the Word may become effectual to Salvation, we must attend thereunto
with diligence, preparation and Prayer, receive it with Faith and Love, lay it
up in our hearts and practice it in our Lives.

Explic. Q What must we do that the Word may become effectual to Salvation?

A. We must attend unto it with diligence. 1 Timothy 4. 13. Acts 16. 14.

Q. What is it to attend unto the Word with diligence?

A. To bend the mind, and set the heart and affections wholly to it, or to give
that heed to it, that will prepare the heart readily to receive it, and to be
delivered into the power of it.

Q. Are there not some things to be done before we attend to the Word?

A. Two things are here expressed, 1. Preparation; and 2. Prayer.

Q In Preparation what must be done?

A. 1. We must look well to our heart, affections, and mind that they be fixed,
composed and ordered, and we must summon and call all that is within us
together to this service, that we may read and hear the Word of God acceptably,
with reverence and godly fear.

2. We must follow the Apostle St. Peter's advice, 1 Epist. 2. 1, 2. Wherefore
laying aside all malice, and all guile and hypocrisies, and envies, and all
evil speakings. As new born Babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that we
may grow thereby.

Q. And what else is here expressed to be done before we attend unto the Word?

A. 2. Prayer.

Q How must this be performed?

A. We must Pray, 1. That God would open our eyes that we may behold wondrous
things out of his Law. 2. That the Word of the Lord may run and be glorified,
i. e. that we may receive, obey and honor it with an holy, unblameable
answerable life as becomes persons professing godliness.

Q. What does God require of us in our attending to the Word?

A. That we receive it.

Q How must the Word be received?

A. It must be received with Faith and Love. Heb. 4 2. 2 These. 2. 10.

Q What is it to receive the Word with Faith?

A. Soundly to believe the truth and goodness of it, and to accept of both.

Q. What is it to receive it with Love?

A. To receive it willingly with all readiness of mind. Acts 17 11. Psalm. 119.
14, 20, 97, 103, 127, 162.

Q. And what does God require of us after our attention to the Word?

A. He requires of us two things, 1. That we lay it up in our hearts. 2. That
we practice it in our lives.


Psalm 119. 11. Luke 2. 51. Luke 8. 15. James 1. 22, -- 26.

Q. Will it nothing avail us to attend unto the Word, to receive it and lay it
up in our hearts, except we practice it in our lives?

A. No.

Q. And will the Word be effectual to our Salvati^n if duly attended to,
received, laid up in our hearts, and practiced in our lives?

A. Yes.

Q 91. How do the Sacraments become effectual means of Salvation?

A. The Sacraments become effectual means of Salvation, not from any virtue in
them, or in him that does administer them, but only by the blessing of Christ,
and the working of his Spirit in them that by Faith receive them.

Explic. Q What other special Ordinances has God appointed as the means of
Salvation, besides the W^rd?

A. The Sacraments and Prayer.

Q Whence is it that the Sacraments become effectual means of Salvation?

A. 1. Negatively, not from any virtue in them, or in him that does administer
them 2 Kings 5. 12 1 Cor. 3. 5. 6 Acts 8. 13, 20, 21, 23 1 Cor. 11. 27
.

Q. Do not the Sacraments work upon the Soul by their own nature, or by the
work done and the bare receiving of them?

A. No.

Q. Does not the efficacy of the Sacraments depend upon the goodness, or
badness of him that does administer them?

A. No.

Q How then do the Sacraments become effectual means of Salvation?

A. 2. Positively, by the blessing of Christ Mat. 18. 20 and 28. 20 1 Cor. 3. 7
, and the working 1 Cor. 12. 13
of his Spirit.

Q. In whom does Christ's blessing by the working of his Spirit make the
Sacraments effectual to Salvation?

A. In them that by Faith receive them, Mark 16. 16.

Q. 92. What is a Sacrament?

A. A Sacrament is an holy Ordinance instituted by Christ, wherein by sensible
signs, Christ and the benefits of the New Covenant are represented, sealed and
applied to Believers.

Explic. Q. What did the Word Sacrament signify in ancient times?

A. It signified an Oath, whereby Soldiers bound themselves to be true to
their Captain, and he in like manner bound himself to them.

Q. What is it now used to signify?

A. Now it is used to signify the seals of the Covenant whereby the Lord does
bind himself in Christ Jesus to be merciful to us; and we bind our selves to be
true unto Christ.

Q. Is the Sacrament then an holy Ordinance?

A. Yes.

Q. By whom are our Sacraments instituted?

A. By Christ. Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25.

Q. What do you mean by being instituted by Christ?

A. Appointed and ordained by him.

Q. What are the parts of a Sacrament?

A. The sign, and the thing signified.

Q. What are the outward parts of the Sacraments?

A. The sensible signs.

Q. Do the signs offer themselves to the Senses?

A. Yes.

Q. And offer the things signified to our Faith?

A. Yes.

Q. What are the inward parts of the Sacraments?

A. Christ and the benefits of the New Covenant, as the things signified by the
outward sensible signs.

Q What is the use and proper work of the Sacraments?

A. To represent, seal and apply.

Q. But are the Sacraments of the New Testament signs, and seals to all even to
unbelievers?

A. Yes.

Q How do the Sacrameats seal to all even to unbelievers?

A. 1. As Circumcision was a Seal of the righteousness of Faith [or of the
Covenant] as well when Ishmael received it, as when Abraham received it Romans 4
11 with Genesis 17 Dr. Lightfoot.
. God is everlastingly true; and these are really Seals whosoever recelves
them. Many persons take the same Physic; the operation is not the same, the
Physic is the same. And if we might call the Tree of Life a Seal, it retains
the nature of a sign, though Adam never tasted of it. The Rainbow is a
Covenant, though there be thousands in the world that never knew it was a
Covenant. And it is the use and proper work of our Sacraments to commemorate
and seal.

2. Sacraments are visible D^ctrines, Ier. 2. 31. O Generation, see ye the word
of the Lord. In the Sacraments are written in small Characters, what at large
are found in the works of God. And Faith acts upon these Symbols upon a
doctrinal notion, as they are teaching Ordinances. They testify, as a sign
Christ's Love, as a Seal Gods faithfulness. The Word of God is given us that we
may believe, and that we may be strong in Faith: So likewise the Sacraments are
given us not only to believe, but for our increase in Faith. And as the word
Jesus Christ is evidently set forth crucified before our eyes, so do the
Sacraments as the Oracles of God teach us plainly the mystery of Faith, and
the way of Salvation.

3. The Sacraments are not only signs and Seals, but Sanctions, and such Laws
as we are charged to observe upon pain of Gods wrathful displeasure Genesis 17. 14
and Number. 9. 13 Mat. 3. 7 Luke 7. 30 Mat. 28. 19 Man. 16. 16 Acts 2. 37, 38 and
16. 30, 31, 32 and 1 Cor. 11 24, 25 Exodus 24. 8
. Which will be more manifest by our comparing the S^craments of the Old and
New Testament together; B^ptism and the Lords Supper succeeding in the place of
Circumcision and the P^ssover: For, as Baptism and the sprinkling of clean
water upon us, is to wash off the filth of the Soul that we might be clean; so
was Circumcision to take away the stony heart out of the flesh, and to give an
heart of flesh: And as the sprinkling of blood was of old a Law in Israel; so
is the Lords Supper a Sanction of the New Testament to us. And as Moses said.
This is the blo^d of the Covenant which the Lord has made with you Exo. 24. 8
wi^h Mat. 26, 27, 28
; here in like manner Christ has Preached the G^spel doctrine, and now he
comes to put a Sanction (...) this Sacrament; This, says he, is (...) blood of
the New Testament, which is (...) for many, for the remission of sins. There is
this only disparity, the sign was (...) Blood, now Wine, now Wine because there
is to be no more shedding (...) blood Heb. 9. 26 Dan. 9. 24.
, then blood sprinkling because Christ our P^ssover was not sacrificed for us
Heb. 9. 18, -- 26
: So that as to substance, the Sacraments of the Old and N^w Testament differ
no more than the Old and New Moon, which are not two, but one and the same. All
which considered jointly may sufficiently clear it to us, that our Sacraments
are not only signs and seals, but Sanctions, yea Sanctions of the Covenant of
Grace, or of the New Testament. And if he that despised Moses Law, died without
mercy, under two or three witnesses, Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and
has counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, as unholy
thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of Grace Heb. 10. 28, 29
? For if the Word spoken by Angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense of reward: How shall we escap^ if we
negl^ct so great Salvation? which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
and was confirmed to us by them that heard Heb. 2. 2, 3
him. Especially when we have Jesus Christ thus evidently set forth, crucified
among us, not only to the ear but to the eye, by his Word and Sacraments.

Q. But are the Sacraments effectual to Salvation, or savingly applied only by
Believers?

A. Yes. Romans 4. 11, 12.

Q 93. Which are the Sacraments of the New Testament?

A. The Sacraments of the New Testament are Baptism and the Lords Supper.

Explic. Q. Were there other Sacraments under the Old Testament, as
Circumcision and the Passover?

A. Yes. Genesis 17. 10. Exodus 12. 43, 47.

Q. Do these remain in use now?

A. No. Romans 10. 4* Gal. 5* 2 3, 4. 1 Cor. 5* 7, 8.

Q. What Sacraments has Christ appointed under the New Testament, in the room
of these?

A. Baptism and the Lords Supper. 1 Cor. 12. 13.

Q. Are these two the only Sacraments of the New Testament?

A. Yes.

Q. How does that appear?

A. 1. Because when the number of Sacraments were most necessary (as under the
Law) there were but two: and therefore (ours succeeding in the room of them)
there can be no more.

2. Because these two Seals do fully assure us of all Gods Graces; both of our
reg^n^ration, entrance and ingrafting into Christ, and of our growth and
continuance in him: and therefore we need no more.

Q. But there are five more added by the Papists* as Confirmation, Penance,
extreme V^ction. Holy O^ders, and Matrimony; Are not these properly and truly
Sacraments, instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and necessary to the Salvation
of Mankind?

A. No.

Q. Why so?

A. The nature of a Sacrament agrees not to them. 1. Because they are not all
proper to the Church, but common (as Marriage) to the Heathen. 2. They are not
all instituted by Christ, as perpetual standing Ordinance. 3. They do not
consist of an outward sign (as Penace) and inward Grace. 4. The Covenant of
Grace is not sealed in any of them.

Q. But is not Extreme Unction a Sacrament instituted by Christ as a perpetual
standing Ordinance; when every sick man is enjoined, James 5. 14. to call for
the Elders, th^se standing perpetuated Officers, that they may pray over him,
anointing him with Oil in the Name of the Lord?

A. N^.

Q* Why so?

A. 1. Because the anointing spoken of in S. James was frequently omitted by
the Apostles themselves in their working of cures, and was indifferently either
used or not used by them. In the Gospels many such cures are wrought without
it; and so in the Acts, by taking by the hand, by embracing, Chap. 3. 7. and
20. 10. and by Peter's bare word, Chap. 9. 34. and so again, verse 40. And by
Paul's b^re word, Chap. 14. 10. and 16. 18. and by his touching linen clothes,
Chap. 19. 12. All which different ways of healing the sick do sufficiently
evince that the usage of Oil as a bare ceremony, was not instituted by Christ,
or any way commanded to be continued by the Apostles, or their Successors in
the Church, even while the gift of healing did continue among them.

2. Because that anointing with Oil in the Name of the Lord, was never used on
any other design than to demonstrate the Man. 6. 13
miraculousness of the work, which was wrought without any contribution of
natural means; and therefore is not now of any propriety or fitness for use,
when the gift of miraculous healing is ceased in the Church.

3. That anointing was designed on purpose for the recovery of the sick,
whereas Extreme Unction (if the coine^s of Sacraments have not miscalled it)
must needs be supposed to be used only as a V^and to those that depart out of
this world, and then only when it is thought certain that they will die.

Q. 94. What is Baptism?

A. Baptism is a Sacrament, wherein the washing with water, in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, does signify and seal our
ingrafting into Christ, and partaking of the benefits of the Covenant of Grace,
and our engagement to be the ^ords.

Explic. Q. What kind of Ordinance is ^ipism?

A. It is a Sacrament.

Q. What is the sacramental Element in Baptism?

A. Water Man. 3. 11 Acts 8. 3^, 38
, (without mixture.)

Q. What are the sacramental actions?

A. 1. The Ministers blessing and consecrating the Water.

2. The right applying of it to the party to be Baptiz^d, diving, or dipping
him into it, or sprinkling him with it.

Q. How ought the Minister to bless and consecrate the Water?

A. 1. By opening to them that are present the Doctrine of Baptism, and the
right institution and use of it, what outward Mysteries are signified, and
sealed up by that outward sign.

2. By acknowledging in the Name of the Congregation Man's natural pollution,
that we stand in need of spiritual washing; by giving thanks to God the Father
for giving his Son for a propitiation for our sins, and appointing his blood to
be a Fountain to the House of Israel to wash in; and for ordaining this service
to be a Sacrament and Seal of so great a mystery.

3. By making profession of Faith in Gods promises in that behalf, and praying
that they be made good unto the party that is to receive the Seal thereof: For
as every thing is sanct^fied by the Word of God and Prayer; so in especial
manner the sacramental water in B^ptism is blessed and consecrated by the Word
of Institution and Prayer to God for a blessing upon his own Ordinance.

Q Is the action of diving or dipping essential to the Sacrament? Or is there
any ground and warrant for sprinkling, which is mostly used with us in these
cold Countries?

A. The action of sprinkling water upon the Face of the B^ptized is very
warrantable; especially upon young Children in cold Countries, to whom diving
or dipping might be dangerous.

Q What ground has the Church for this practice?

A. 1. Because neither dipping nor sprinkling seem to be essential to Baptism,
but washing and applying water to the body Joh. 13. 10
as a cleanser of the filth thereof. Ephesians. 5. 26.

2. Because, as in the other Sacrament, a spoonful of Wine is as significant as
a whole Gallon; so here a handful of Water as a whole River.

3. The action of sprinkling bears fit resemblance with the inward grace as
well as dipping, and has Authority in the Scripture of truth. Read 1 Pet. 1.
2. Heb. 12. 24. where is speech of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,
and the blood of sprinkling speaking better things than that of Abel.

4. It is not unlikely that the Apostles Baptized as well by sprinkling or
pouring upon, as by diving or dipping into: Since we read of diverse Baptized in
Houses, as well as others in Rivers.

Q. Whose Office is it to Baptize?

A. None but the lawfully ordained Ministers may Baptize. Mat. 28. 19, 20.

Q. In whose Name are we to be Baptized?

A. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Q. What do you mean by Baptizing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost?

A. In the Authority, and into the Faith, Profession, and Obedience of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Q What is signified, sealed, and engaged to, as to be done on Gods part, in
Baptism?

A. Our ingrafting into Christ, and partaking of the benefits of the Covenant
of Grace. Romans 6. 3. Act. 2. 38, 39.

Q. What is sealed to, on our part in Baptism; or what do we engage to?

A. To be the Lords. Romans 6. 4.

Q. Are our ingrafting into Christ, partaking of the benefits of the Covenant
of Grace, and our engagement to be the Lords, signified and sealed to in
Baptism?

A. Yes.

Q. 95. To whom is Baptism is to be administered?

A. Baptism is not to be administered unto any that are out of the visible
Church till they profess their Faith in Christ, and obedience to him; but the
Infants of such as are Members of the visible Church as to be Baptized.

Explic. Q. To whom is not Baptism (...) be administered?

A. It is not to be administered to any that are out of the visible Church.

Q* What mean you by the visible Church?

A. The visible Church is a company of people called from all false worships
and Religions, confessedly to worship the true God according to his Word Acts
2. 47* and 4. 3^ and 6. 7 Joh. 9. 22 and 12. 42 Phil. 2. 10, 11*
.

Q. How long is Baptism to be withheld from them that are out of the visible
Church?

A. Till they profess their Faith in Christ, and obedience to him. Act. 8. 36,
37.

Q. Does Baptism disciple, make disciples or members of the visible Church
whereof Christ alone is the Head?

A. Yes Mat. 28. 19
.

Q. But how do you prove that the Infants of such as are member of the visible
Church may and ought to be Baptized?

A. 1. Because to such Infants appertains the Covenant and the thing
signified Acts 2. 39 Mat. 19. 14*
.

2. Because whole Families were Baptized, and there is pregnant probability,
that there were some Infants among them of those House-holds. Acts 16. 14, 15,
33.

Q. But suppose there ^ were no Children in those Families; how then is it
required ^t our hands to Baptize Infants?

A. Those that plead this, plead their own ignorance; 1. Because in the Jewish
Church, this was their custom, when Parents came to be Baptized, Children came
be Baptized also, and their whole Family. And secondly, If there were Children
in those Families; as that Jewish custom (over-ballancing the others groundless
supposition) renders it most probable; be it known to all such unnatural
Parents as reject Infant Baptism, that they harden their hearts against their
own flesh.

Q Why so?

A. Because Children are parts of Parents; and by this contempt of Baptism they
reject the Counsel of God against themselves, and their Children Ink. 7. 30
.

Q* What other reason have you for Infant Baptism?

A. 3. Children were ever admitted to the sign and Seal of this Covenant, which
of old was Circumcision; and Baptism succeeds in the room of Circumcision.

Q. How does that appear?

A. 1. It appears in that the Apostle of the Circumcision commands Baptism upon
the same ground that Circumcision was Act. 1. 38, 39 with Genesis 17. 12 and 21.
3, 4 and Luk 1. ^9 and 2. 21
.

2. Because St. Paul in Col. 2. gives to Baptism the very Name of Circumcision,
to teach us that it succeeds i^.

Object. But if Baptism ought to be administered to all those to whom
Circumcision was administered, because Baptism succeeds Circumcision; by the
same reason the Eucharist ought to be administered to all those who did eat the
Paschal Lamb, seeing the Eucharist succeeds the Jewish Passover: But you stay
longer before you admit your Children to the Lords Supper, than the Jews did
before they admitted their Children to the eating of the Paschal Lamb.

A. The Jews admitted their Children to eat of the Paschal Lamb, so soon as
they were able to eat flesh, and to ask their Fathers the reason of that legal
ceremony; and we defer the admitting of ours to the Lords Supper until they be
capable of those dispositions which God requires; and are able to examine
themselves according to the command of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11. Let a man
examine himself; and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.

Q. 96. What is the Lords Supper?

A. The Lords Supper is a Sacrament wherein by giving and receiving Bread and
Wine according to Christ's appointment, his Death is showed forth, and the
worthy receivers are not after a corporal and carnal manner, but by Faith made
partakers of his Body and Blood, with all his benefits unto their spiritual
nourishment and growth in Grace.

Explic. Q. What is the other Sacrament of the New Testament called?

A. The Lords Su^p^^.

Q. Why so?

A. Because it was instituted at that time after the Paschal Supper was end^d.

Q. Are we therefore bound to celebrate it always at the same time?

A. No, because there is no command for it, nor is there the same reason for it
now as then; this circumstance of time not obliging us to do it after Supper
any more than the fashion of lying along binds us to the using of the same
posture; both of them being upon occasion of the Paschal Supper then.

Q. Why do you super add the circumstance and limitation of that present time?

A. Because the first Paschal Supper in Egypt was eaten standing; but
afterward sitting and lying along, leaning one on another breasts, in sign of
their rest and security, otherwise than they had in Egypt.

Q. What are the sacramental Elements in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine.

Q What are the sacramental actions?

A. Breaking the Bread, giving and receiving the Bread and Wine.

Q. What is signified by the Bread and Wine?

A. The Body and Blood of Christ.

Q. What are the Ministers actions?

A. Breaking the Bread, and giving the Bread and Wine, not withholding the Cup
from the people, as the Papists sacrilegiously do.

Q. What is signified by the Ministers breaking the Bread?

A. Christ's Body being broken for us.

Q. Why must the people partake of the Elements of both kinds?

A. Because all that were present at the first Sacrament, given by the Lord
Jesus himself, did so.

Q How does that appear?

A. By the plain express words of Scripture. Mat. 26. 26, 27. Mark 14. 22. 23.

Q. But all present at the first Sacrament were the twelve, whom Christ sent
forth as Apostles to Preach the Word and administer the Sacraments, and
therefore they and their Successors only had the priviled^e to drink of the Cup?

A. 1. By this argument the Bread may be taken away from the people too, and so
they would have no right to any part of this Sacrament: And what is this but
egregious sacrilege in robbing the people of their highest Church-priviledge?

2. The practice and writings of the ancient Church in this matter, which is
the best way to explicate any such difficulty in Scripture, is a clear
Testimony that both the Bread and the Wine belong to all the people, in the
Name of the twelve Disciples at that time.

Q. What is signified by the giving of the Bread and Wine?

A. Gods giving all Christ to us.

Q. What is the peoples action?

A. Receiving (eating and drinking) the Bread and Wine.

Q. What is signified by the peoples receiving?

A. Their taking a whole Christ.

Q. Why are the Bread and Wine given apart, and not together?

A. To show forth Christ's Blood, in the parting of his Blood from his Body.

Q. What is the rule of Administration and Participation?

A. All must be done according to Christ's appointment.

Q. For what end is this Supper cele^rated?

A. Hereby Christ's death is showed ^orth.

Q. How many sorts of Receivers are there?

A. Two; worthy, and unworthy.

Q. What do the unworthy Receivers partake of?

A. They partake of the outward Elements only.

Q. What do the worthy Receivers partake of?

A. They partake of Christ's Body and Blood 1 Cor. 10. 16
.

Q. After what manner do not these worthy Receivers partake of Christ's Body and
Blood?

A. Not after a corporal and carnal manner; they partake not of the substance
of his flesh and blood.

Q. Why so?

A. For that is in Heaven Act. 1. 11 and 3. 21
.

Q. But do not you affirm with the Pa^ists, that in this Sacrament the Body and
Blood, together with the Divinity of Jesus Christ, are truly, really and
substantially present; and that the whole substance of the Bread is converted
into his Body, and the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood?

A. N^, should we do it, our Senses, our Reason, and the Word of God would give
us the Lie: We perceive by our Senses that the Bread and Wine are the same they
were before Consecration: And we are not more certain that there is a God who
created us, and a Sun that gives us light; than we are fully persuaded that the
Divinity of Jesus Christ is every where, and his humane nature at the right
hand of God, from whence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead.

Q. And why are you afraid to affirm, that the Elements of Bread and Wine art
transubstantiate and changed into the substance of the Body and Blood of
Christ, when the Scripture is plain and express that Christ took the Bread, and
said, [ This is my Body.] And after the same manner took the Cup, which
Protestants, as well as Papists, interpret figuratively for the Wine in the
Cup, and said, [ This is my blood of the New Testament, etc.] as you may read
in the following Texts, Mat. 26. 26, etc. Mark 14 22, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 23, etc.

A. Indeed if the forecited Texts ought to be understood in the literal sense,
we need not dread this Popish Doctrine; But if they ought of necessity to have
a mystical and figurative sense and interpretation put upon them, we may well
enough be afraid of that Doctrine, which the Papists themselves in the supposed
case confess to be gross damnable Idolatry.

Q But if we once take this liberty to imp^se our mystical or figurative
Interpretation on the Scripture without express warrant of the Scripture it
self, we shall have no settled belief, but be liable continually to be turned
aside by any one that can invent a new mystical meaning of the Scripture, there
being no certain rule to judge of such meanings, as there is of the literal
ones: Nor is there any error, how absurd and impious soever, but may on such
terms be accorded with the Scripture: Why therefore must we of necessity
suppose the forecited Texts to be understood in the figurative, and not in the
literal sense?

A. 1. Because the letter is contrary and repugnant to our senses; which the
Scripture it self intimates to be of infallible certainty 1 John 1. ^ 1, 2, 3
Luke 1 1, 2 1 Cor. 15. 5, 6 with 14 Joh. 20 25, 27
.

2. It is absurd and contradictive of right reason.

3. There appears much in the contexts to cross it, nothing at all to
countenance it.

4. Because other places collated, expressly thwart and contradict it Romans 6. 9,
^10 Mat. 28. 6 Joh. 13. 1 Mat. 26. 11 Luke 24. 39 with Heb. 2 14, 16, 17 Joh.
16. 28 Act. 1. 9, 10 and 3. 21 2 These. 1. 7
.

Q. What sense then may or must be put upon the forecited Texts?

A. It will be an Introduction and a very good help to us for the right
understanding of the said Texts, to consider those observations taken from the
Jewish phrases and customs used in this matter, viz. 1. That the Lamb that was
dressed in the Paschal Supper and set upon the Table, was wont to be called the
Body of the Passover, or the Body of the Paschal Lamb; and probably Christ
alludes to this phrase, when he says, This is my Body; as if he should say,
the Paschal Lamb and the Body of it, ( i. e. the representation of that on the
Table in the Jewish Feast) that was the memorial of deliverance out of Egypt,
and type of your deliverance out of the state of sin and death, I will now have
abrogated; and do now institute Bread and Wine instead of that Paschal Lamb,
that you may hereafter retain and continue to posterity a Memorial and Symbol
of me, who am the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world, and am
now about to be sacrificed for you. This for the words [ My Body and my Blood:)
But then 2. For the whole phrase, and form of speech, [ This is my Body, this
is my Blood.] It seems to be answerable to (and substituted instead of) the
Paschal form ( This is the Bread of affliction, which our Fathers eat in Egypt:
or, This is the unleavened Bread, etc. or, This is the Passover.] And therefore
the Bread and the Wine in the Eucharist are no more the very Body and Blood of
Christ, than that Bread which the Children of Israel eat in the Land of Canaan
was that Identical, that very Bread of affliction which their Fathers eat in
the Land of Egypt.

Q. Is not this Popish Doctrine* that the Bread of the Eucharist is
transubstantiated into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood of Christ, a very
ancient Doctrine?

A. It is but four hundred fifty nine years, I^ (...) in the Council of
Lateran, 1215.
since it was declared by Pope Innocent the third, in the Council of Lateran.

Q Is not this impossible and incomprehensible error of Transubstantiation to
be rejected with our utmost Detestation?

A. Yes.

Q. Does not this Doctrine suppose a silly Priest to do that which all the
Angels cannot do, and that is to make his Maker, as the Papists call the Host,
and the people to devour their God?

A. Yes.

Q Can they justify this by Gods omnipotency, that God is able to effect it?

A. No, this is no better argument than the Turks may justify most of the
sopperies of their Alcoran by.

Q. What reasons and grounds have you for the rejection of this abomination?

A. There are two grounds especially for the rejection of it.

1. The Idolatry and Sacrilege which does ensue upon it, and that is the
Adoration and worship of the Host, a piece of Bread, and the mutilation or
maiming of the Sacrament by Bread only, and the propitiatory Sacrifice of
Christ himself in the Mass, who was once only offered up to God upon the Cross,
all which are the issue of this error.

2. The Monsters of contradiction and absurdity to sense and reason, which
follow thereupon. It was begotten by feigned Miracles and fabulous Legends, and
is the Mother of Blasphemies and inextricable absurdities, and has set Faith
it self on the R^ck, and surpasses all the Harlotry that the Adulterate Church
of Rome, that Mother of Fornications, ever brought forth.

Q. If you can but make good this high charge you have drawn up against that
most degenerate and corrupted Church of Rome, in this one error of
Transubstantiation being comprehensive of all errors; (Pap^l Rome being nothing
else but the worst corruption of the once most famous Church of Rome, whose
Faith was spoken of throughout the world) you may easily persuade all the
friends of the Bride, the Lambs Wife, to abo^inate all the other Fornications
of that Whorish Church: And because the Protestants Arguments against
Transubstantiation may convince us how fully they have made good this charge,
pray produce a few of the many Arguments they have against this Mother Error?

A. 1. Suppose Christ sitting at the Table with his Disciples, and eating th^s
Bread, and drinking this Cup first, as the custom at the Paschal Supper was,
and as the Papists generally, and the Fathers hold, and we deny not, because
the Scripture seems plain for it, Mat. 26. 29. Hence forth I will not drink of
the fruit of the Vine; supposing therefore this, How is it possible or
imaginable that he should eat himself? or how can he sit at Table, and yet be
in the mouths of the Apostles? Was he at the same time in the Apostles mouths
or stomachs, while he sat and rose from Table, and discoursed those three
Chapters of John 15, 16, 17. Or while he sweat that bloody sweat in his Agony
in the Garden, etc. A monstrous impossibility!

2. It Is impossible to make that which was before existent and in being: Can a
Father beget a Son that is already begotten? Can an Architect build an House
that is already built? Can the Body of Christ, which is before the Conversion
of the Bread, be made or produced by the turning of Bread into it? Can he that
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary, be made by
pronouncing of four or five words? If ever delusions were strong, these are;
For, to make that which is made, and to unmake that which is made, are equally
impossible.

3. They say that the substance of Bread and Wine is avoided, and that only the
accidents remain; so that there is length and nothing long, breadth and nothing
broad, thickness and nothing thick, whiteness and nothing white, moisture and
nothing moist, sweetness and nothing sweet, that is, a long, broad, thick,
white, moist, sweet nothing. The Priest pours out nothing but Lines and
Colors, when he pours out the Wine, for these accidents of Bread and Wine are
not in the Bread, because that is avoided and vanished, and they are not in the
Body of Christ, as themselves say, and yet it is plain this Bread and Wine do
nourish the Body, and is the Body nourished by mere accidents? Can there be
plainer contradictions?

4. Can the same Body at the same time have his just Dimensions, distance of
parts, symmetry, proportion, as the Body of Christ has, and yet not have
these, because all parts? Yea, the whole Body of Christ, say they, is in one
and the self same point or crumb of Bread.

5. Can the Body of Christ, which is much greater, be wholly contained in a
Wa^er or piece of Bread, in his full Dimensions, and that as many times as
there are points, crumbs, drops in the Bread or Wine?

6. Can the Bread be turned into the very Body of Christ, and yet not any thing
of that Bread become any thing of Christ, nor the matter, nor form, nor
accidents of Bread be made either the matter, or form, or accidents of Christ?

7. Can the same thing, as Christ's true Body, at the same time be wholly above
it self, and wholly below it self, within and without it self? Can it be moved,
and yet be still? be carried from one place to another, and yet not move? be
brought from Heaven to Earth, and yet not come out of Heaven? Who then can
assure us that when Christ hung upon the Cross, he was not walking somewhere
else, Crucified and not Crucified, eaten and not eaten, alive in one and dead
in another place?

8. What dishonor do these men render the Body of Christ obnoxious unto, to be
eaten by wicked men, by brute Creatures, by Mice, by other vermin, to be cast
into some unclean place? For so long as the form of Bread remains, so long the
Body of Christ is there, though it be in the Mouth or Belly of a Mouse, says
Hales, and the rest of the Schoolmen, who do one where or another acknowledge
the most of these monstrous Absurdities, and go about to heal, and solve them.

Q. We shall surcease from raking further into the ungrateful sink, whose Name
Transubstantiation is but of yesterday in comparison, and which dishonours the
Body of Christ, into a Monster, destroys the nature of a Sacrament, and fills
the world with dreadful Contentions and broils: And shall now consider with our
selves what may profitably be observed from all this: What therefore may be
observed upon the whole matter?

A. We may observe, 1. What grievous impositions the Romanists lay upon the
Faith of them that are devoted to her Communion.

2. What contradictions and absurdities the common people do ignorantly and
implicitly believe.

3. What strong delusions even to believe lies God gives up learned men unto,
that refuse the simplicity of the truth for interests and politic ends!

4. What a Mercy of God it is to deliver us from that Tyranny, which leaves us
no other choice, but to swallow and digest such impossible things, or to be
sacrificed in flames, and the Lord forbid the Re-entrance of that Religion
among us, Mr. Vines on the Sacrament.
which in all likelihood will cost us our Souls, or our Lives.

Q. Since the worthy Receivers are not after a corporal and carnal manner
partakers of Christ's Body and Blood; After what manner are they partakers of
them?

A. By Faith.

Q How understand you that?

A. As truly as the Minister gives them the Bread and Wine, so truly does God
give them the Body and Blood of Christ, that is, the Crucified Savior, not by
local motion, but by real communication, not to their teeth, but to their
Souls; and consequently exhibits to them all the benefits thereof to their
spiritual nourishment and growth in Grace, and all the advantages that flow to
them from the death of Christ.

Q. 97. What is required to the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper?

A. It is required of them that would worthily partake of the Lords Supper,
that they examine themselves of their knowledge to discern the Lords Body, of
their Faith to feed upon him, of their Repentance, Love and new Obedience: lest
coming unworthily, they eat and drink Judgment to themselves.

Explic. Q. How ought Christians to partake of the Lords Supper?

A. They ought to partake worthily (that is suitably) with a suitable frame of
heart to this Ordinance.

Q. What is the great duty of those that would thus partake?

A. It is required that they examine themselves.

Q. How many things must they examine themselves about?

A. Five especially, viz. 1. Knowledge. 2. Faith. 3. Love. 4. Repentance. 5.
New Obedience.

Q. Must every one that comes to the Lords Supper have Knowledge?

A. Yes.

Q Why is Knowledge necessary?

A. To discern the Lords Body 1 Cor. 11. 28, 29
.

Q. What other graces must they examine themselves about?

A. Their Faith, Repentance and Love.

Q. In their examination, what must they look after?

A. Two things especially; 1. That they have these Graces. 2. That the said
Graces be in readiness for service and exercise, that is, that they so stir up
these Graces of the Holy Ghost, as they may be most profitably exerted in this
most Sacred solemn Ordinance.

Q. Why is Faith necessary?

A. To feed on Christ. John 6. 53.

Q. Why is Repentance necessary?

A. Repentance for sin will fit them to receive, and sweeten their receiving
the benefits of Christ's death to their Souls.

Q. Why is Love necessary?

A. Because they who have no Love to God and Christ, and their Brethren, are
unfit to receive the pledge of Gods Love to themselves.

Q. What else must they examine themselves about?

A. New Obedience, whether they propose and practice it in any good measure.

Q. Why is New Obedience necessary?

A. Because Christ only communicates the benefits of his death to them that
obey him Heb. 5. 9
.

Q. What if any Communicants shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the
Lord unworthily?

A. They shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ 1 Cor. 11. 27
.

Q. What danger is there in that?

A. All such Communicants eat and drink Judgment to themselves 1 Cor* 11. 29
.

Q. 98. What is Prayer?

A. Prayer is an offering up of our desires to God for things agreeable to his
Will, in the Name of Christ, with confession of our sins and thankful
acknowledgement of his mercies.

Explic. Q. What are the parts of Prayer?

A. Confession, Petition, and Thanksgiving.

Q. And how many things are there, as the matter of these?

A. Three; our sins, as the matter of our Confession; our desires and wants, as
the matter of our Petition; and our Mercies as the matter of our Thanksgiving.

Q. What is Confession?

A. A due acknowledgement of our sins with all their several aggravating
circumstances Dan. 9. 4, etc. 2 Samuel 24. 10
.

Q. What is Petition?

A. The offering up of our desires to God.

Q. To whom are we to direct our Prayers?

A. To God only Psa. 5. 2, 3
.

Q. Why are we to direct our Prayers only to God?

A. 1. Because Prayer is such a specia^ part of religious worship, that it is
sometimes in holy Writ put for the Gen 4. 26 Acts 9. 14 Jer. 10. 25 Psalm. 79. 6
and 116. 13 Genesis 12. 8
whole worship of God, and God is the only object of religious worship Mat. 4.
10 Rev. 19. 10 and 22. 8, 9
.

2. Because God only is omniscient and omnipresent to know our wants and hear
our Prayers. 1 Kings 8. 38, 39. Psalm. 34. 15. Isa. 63. 16.

3. Because the Title of a Hearer of Prayers is one of Gods Peculiars, and that
glory which he will not give to any other Psalm. 65. 2 Mat. 4. 10
.

4. It is Paganism, and gross Idolatry to give so principal a part of divine
worship, and to do service to them that by nature are no Gods. Gal. 4 8.

5. Because God only is Almighty and can answer our Prayers, he is
All-sufficient and will fulfill all our Petitions 1 Timothy 6. 15 Psalm. 145. 18,
19 and 20. 4, 5
.

Q. Are therefore forbidden to Pray to Saints and Angels?

A. We are forbidden to Pray to them, upon pain of Gods high displeasure, and
such punishments as he will inflict upon all such as shall contemn or neglect
their known duty to him, by intruding into those things which they have not
seen. Exodus 20. 5. and 34. 14. Col. 2. 18.

Q. The Papists please themselves, and condemn Protestants in point of Praying
to Saints and Angels, as Intercessors to God, as if there were some special
humility in so doing; Have they any ground for this Doctrine?

A. They search into those things which they know nothing of, and have no other
ground for this Doctrine but their own carnal Fantasy. Col. 2. 18.

Q. For what must we make our addresses to God in Prayer, or offer up our
desires to him?

A. For things agreeable to his Will 1 J^h. 5. 14
.

Q. How shall we know what things are agreeable to the Will of God?

A. By the written Word, the Commandments and Promises of it.

Q In whose Name must we Pray?

A. In the Name of Christ Joh. 16 23
.

Q. What mean you by that?

A. For Christ's sake and worthiness Dan. 9, 17 with A ands 2. 36 Luke 1. 43 and
2. 11 See Cardinal Bellarmine, in his first Book of Indulgences, Chap. 2.
.

Q. Does not the Romish Divinity say plainly that there are some Saints and
Martyrs, who have suffered more than their sins did deserve; and that their
superabundant satisfactions are put into the Treasury of the Church, and
distributed by the Popes Indulgences?

A. Yes.

Q The Papists with one hand lay hold on the Merits of Christ, but with the
other they lay hold on the Merits of Saints, and Martyrs: Can they deny this?

A. They cannot deny it: For before God and his Angels, their Priests, when
they sing Mass, Pray unto God, not only through the Merits of Jesus Christ, but
also through the Merits of Saints, whose Relics are under the Altar.

Q. Do not their Devotoes [the more superstitiously devout Papists] publicly
assert that the holy Virgin saves us, and brings us into heavenly glory, not
only by her Prayers, but also by her Merits?

A. Yes.

Q. Does not this Opinion of theirs border upon Blasphemy?

A. Yes.

Q. Are there not in Rome it self published certain Indulgences, See this
Indulgence in the book of the Ceremonial of Bishops, page 381. of the Roman
Edition, 1606.
By the Prayers, and by the Merits of the holy Virgin Mary, of Michael the
Archangel, of St. John Baptist, of the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of
all the Saints, without any mention at all of Jesus Christ, or his Merits?

A. Yes.

Q. And is not this egregious horrid Sacrilege?

A. Yes.

Q. Are we therefore to Pray to the Father in the Name of Christ, and in his
Name only?

A. Yes.

Q. Why so?

A. 1. Because none but Christ were ever called to the honor of an everlasting
Priesthood, to appear in the presence of God for Heb. 5. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 9.
24, 25, 26.
us: And it would be sinful in us to imagine the Saints or Angels to usurp an
Office, and assume to themselves that honor they were never called unto by
God, as Christ was.

2. Because he alone is able to save us to the utmost; and seeing he ever
lives to make Intercession for us (presenting himself before God, and that one
once offered perfect Sacrifice for sin for us) we should much derogate from the
sufficiency of Christ's undertakings, to suppose any need of the Intercession of
Saint or Angels.

Q. And what is the third part of Prayer?

A. Thanksgiving.

Q. What is Thanksgiving?

A. The thankful acknowledgement of, and a faithful rendering unto God the
praise that is due unto his Name Psalm. 103. 1, 2 and 29. 1, 2 1 These. 5. 18
Phil. 4. 6
.

Q. 99. What rule has God given for our direction in Prayer?

A. The whole Word of God is of use to direct us in Prayer; but the special
rule of Direction is that Form of Prayer which Christ taught his Disciples,
commonly called the Lords Prayer.

Explic. Q. What is generally useful for our direction in Prayer?

A. The whole Word of God.

Q. But have we not left us upon Record, some special rule for our direction in
Prayer?

A. Yes, the Lords Prayer. Matthew. 6. Luke 11.

Q. Why is that Form recorded in the Gospels, called the Lords Prayer?

A. Because the Lord Jesus taught it his D^sciples. Luke 11. 1, 2.

Q. Of what use is the Lords Prayer?

A. To direct us in Prayer.

Q. Is it only of use to direct us in Prayer?

A. No.

Q. Is not the saying the very words of the Lords Prayer commended unto us, if
not commanded?

A. Yes, Luke [Chap. 11. 2.] has it, When ye Pray, say, Our Father, etc.

Q. What kind of Forms may our Prayers be presented in?

A. Either in set or extemporary unprescribed Forms.

Q. Are set Forms of Prayer lawful?

A. Set Forms of Prayer are lawful, both as the word [Set] signifies
premeditate limited Forms, as opposed to extemporary; and as it signifies
prescribed, and for some occasions and uses commanded.

Q. How do you prove it lawful to use a set determinate Form of words, either
written or fastened in our memory?

A. It is apparent both by the example of Christ, who in St. Luke bids us, when
we pray, say, Our Father, etc. (Not only pray after this Pattern, as the words
in St. Matthew may be interpreted, but use these very words, When you pray,
say, Our Father, etc* Luke 11. 2.) and of John Baptist, who taught his
Disciples to pray in some Form, though we know not what it is, Luke 11. 1. As
also of the Priests under the Law, by Gods appointment, that used a Set Form of
blessing the People, Numb. 6. 24, etc. And of our Savior himself, who used a a
part (if not the whole) of the 22. Psalm upon the Cross, My God, my God, why
have thou forsaken me, etc. And of the Church of the Jews, and Christian
Churches through all times, who have had their Liturgies, as ways and Forms of
serving God publicly, and as means to preserve the true Religion from all
corruptions in Doctrine. And to these Arguments may be aded one more of common
observation, that even when the Minister (or whosoever is the mouth of the
rest) prays, though in a Form of his own present extemporary effusion, yet at
that time all others present are limited to his conceptions, and pray in as
stinted a Form, as if what the Minister prays were read out of a Book, or
dictated by his Memory.

Q. But how do you prove it lawful to use a Set (as that signifies a
prescribed) Form of Prayer?

A. It is apparent, 1. By Christ's prescribing one, which he would not sure have
done, if it had not been lawful to have used it being prescribed; and so also,
2. By the other examples mentioned, which are most of them prescriptions. 3. By
the no Objection against the use of them; For sure, if it be lawful to use
them, it is lawful to prescribe them at some time, and for some uses, (for that
a thing in it self acknowledged, and proved to be lawful, should by being
commanded by lawful Authority become unlawful, is very unreasonable, unless
lawful Magistrates be the only unlawful things) and at other times to use other
liberty is not forbidden, and so hereby there is not any invasion or Tyranny
used upon our Christian liberty. 4. By the great benefit that accrues to the
Congregation in having discreet well formed Prayers, and so not subject to the
tem^rity and impertinences of the sudden effusions; and the same still in
constant use, and so not strange or new to them, but such as in which they may
with understanding go along with the Minister, and by the help of their Memory
the most ignorant may carry them away for his private use, and generally those
that want such helps, are by this means afforded them. And lastly, by the
consideration of this one special farther advantage of them, viz. that by means
of prescribed Liturgies the Unity of Faith, and Charity is much preserved.

Q Well then, supposing these Set Forms to be lawful in themselves, and lawful
to be prescribed; whether may any other be used but such?

A. Yea doubtless: See H's practical Catechism, p. 239.
For the Church being obeyed in the observance of the prescribed Liturgy in
public, permits sometimes (and upon special incidental occasions prescribes)
other Forms in the public Congregation, so it be done prudently, and piously,
and reverently, and to Edification; and so also in the Family, or in visitation
of the sick, if the particular condition of one or other do require it: and in
private, in the Closet, it is not supposed by the Church of England but that
every one may ask his own wants in what form of words he shall think fit; which
that he may do fitly and reverently, it will not be amiss for him to acquaint
himself with the several addresses to God, which the Book of Psalms, and other
parts of holy Writ, and all other helps of devotion will afford him, either to
use as he finds them fit for the present purpose, or by those patterns to
direct and prepare himself to do the like.

Q 100. What does the Preface of the Lords Prayer teach us?

A. The Preface of the Lords Prayer, which is [ Our Father which art in Heaven]
teaches us to draw near to God with holy reverence and confidence, as Children
to a Father, able and ready to help us, and that we should pray with and for
others.

Explic. Q. How many parts are there in the Lords Prayer?

A. Three, the Preface, the Petitions, and the Conclusion.

Q. Which is the Preface of the Lords Prayer?

A. Our Father which art in Heaven.

Q. How must we draw near to God in Prayer?

A. As Children to a Father.

Q. H^w is that?

A. With reverence Genesis 18. ^7 Psalm. 115. 3 Mal. 1. 6 2 Chronicles. 6. 13 Psalm. 95.
6 Dan. 6. 10 Psalm 89. 7 and 111. 9 Eccl. 5. 1, 2
, and confidence 1 John 5. 14 Ephesians. 3. 12 Mat. 7. 7, -- 12 and 21. 22 Joh. 14,
13, 14 and 15. 7 and 16. 23, 24 1 John* 3 22 Romans 8. 15
.

Q. Must we come to God with all holy reverence and confidence, because he is
our heavenly Father?

A. Yes.

Q. What encouragement have we so to do?

A. Because he is able and ready to help us, as a Father his Children.

Q. In what words are his readiness and ability implied?

A. His readiness in these words [ Our Father] his ability in these [ which art
in Heaven.]

Q. Why do you say, Our Father, and not my Father?

A. Because we ought not only to pray by our selves, and for our selves; but
with and for others.

Q. Must we pray for all?

A. Yes 1 Timothy 2. 1 Genesis 17. 18 and 20. 7 1 Kin. 13* 6 Ezr. 6. 10
, excepting those that have sinned the sin unto death 1 John 5. 16
.

Q. Must we pray for our enemies?

A. Yes Mat. 5. 44
.

Q. Whom must we pray for especially?

A. For the Ephesians. 6. 18 Psalm. 28. 9 and 122. 6
Church of God.

Q. And whom must we pray for more particularly?

A. For Magistrates and Ministers. 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2 These. 3. 1. Heb. 13. 18. Col.
4. 3. Ephesians. 6. 18, 19.

Q. May we not pray for those who are yet unborn?

A. Yes Joh. 17. 20
.

Q. But may we pray for those that are dead and departed out of this life?

A. No.

Q. Why so?

A. 1. Because we find not any command or example in the Scripture, that
Prayers are to be made for souls departed; but have the example of David (that
man after Gods own heart) against it.

2. The souls of the righteous in Heaven stand in no need of our Prayers, and
the souls of the wicked in Hell can receive no good by them, or by the
pretended sacrifice of the Mass.

Q. But where are those souls pretended to be, that are thought, by the
Papists, to be profited by their Prayers, and their sacrifice of the Mass?

A. In Purgatory.

Q. If then there be no Purgatory, do not the Papists themselves grant it us,
that there are no Prayers to be made for the Dead?

A. Yes.

Q. What souls do the Papists tell us must go to Purgatory?

A. They tell us that the souls of the impenitent do not go to Purgatory, but
to Hell, nor the souls of all Believers, but of some only, viz. of those that
did not fully satisfy for their sins in this life.

Q. What kind of place do they imagine Purgatory to be?

A. A place of great pain, where the forementioned souls are tormented till
they satisfy Gods Justice, and then being purged fully from sin, they are to
be received up into Heaven.

Q. What difference do they make betwixt Hell and Purgatory?

A. They say in Purgatory, the forementioned souls suffer the vengeance of a
temporary fire, but in Hell impenitent Unbelievers suffer the vengeance of
eternal fire.

Q The Papists profess to believe with us, That the blood of Jesus Christ
purges and cleanses us from all our sins: Why then have they invent^d the
fire of Purgatory? If all sins are washed away, and purged by the blood of
Christ, what then remains to be purged in this imaginary fire?

A. They mock the world in calling it Purgatory, for (according to the Romish
Doctrine) it serves not to purge, but to punish souls, and to satisfy Gods
Justice; so that it is not a purging, but a pain and a punishment.

Q* But can the sufferings of the forementioned Believers in Purgatory,
satisfy Gods offended Justice, so that by the help of the Prayers of the
living* and the sacrifice of the Mass, they shall be delivered thence, and
accounted worthy to be received up into Heaven?

A. It Is impossible that the sufferings of finite and mutable Creatures, which
are but of yesterday, should satisfy the offended Justice of the infinite,
eternal and unchangeable God: And that their temporary torments, though never
so exquisite, should merit for them that far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory, which all shall be partakers of, that are received up into Heaven.

Q. How may it be proved that we are delivered from the whole punishment of
sin, temporal and Eternal, by the death of Christ: So that we shall not need to
fear their fear, who through fear of Purgatory-fire, are all their lifetime
subject to bondage; or be affrighted with their big words, who are so hot for
this invented fire, as to say, Whosoever believes not Purgatory shall be
tormented in Hell?

A. 1. Punishment is inflicted because of sin, Job 4. 8. Prove. 22. 8. and 28.
18. Hos. 10. 13. and 14. 1. Being freed from sin, we are not liable to
Judgment, 2 Samuel 12. 13. Ier. 4. 14. Ezekiel. 18. 32.

2. It stands not with the Justice of God, being once fully satisfied, to
require a second payment at our hand. Genesis 18. 25. Isa. 53. 10, 11. Mat. 3. 17.

3. Neither will it stand with his glorious Mercy. Luke 1. 77, 78. 2 Cor. 1. 3.
Romans 9. 23. Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1. 3. Jude 21. 2 Timothy 1. 18.

4. Nor with the honor of Christ, who is a perfect Redeemer. Tit. 2. 14. Heb.
1. 3. 1 Ioh. 1. 7, 9. and 2. 1, 2.

5. Nor with the price of his Blood. 1. Cor. 6. 20. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Mat. 20.
28. 1 Timothy 2. 6.

6. Nor with our Faith in praying for full pardon of all our debts. Matthew. 6.
12.

7. Nor with our peace with God. Romans 5. 1.

8. Nor yet with right reason, that the guilt of sin should be removed, and yet
punishment for sin infl^cted.

Q. And is not this new invented doctrine of Purgatory contrary to the
intendment and design of the Gospel?

A. Yes, for the design of the Gospel is to comfort Believers against all their
sufferings in this life, with the hope of heavenly glory and happiness, to be
enjoyed immediately after their death; see Romans 15. 4. Io^. 5. 24. 2 Cor. 5. 1,
2. 1 These. 4. 17. Romans 8. 17. Phil. 1. 23. Rev. 14. 13. Luke 23. 43. and 16.
22, 23. with Mat. 8. 11, 12. Heb. 11. 13, 16. But this new invented Doctrine
speaks terror to all Believers, as being so far from making God full
satisfaction for their sins in this life (as some of them are supposed to do by
the Papists) that they were never able to make God any satisfaction for them.
And therefore must we certainly be all doomed alike to go to Purgatory, that
place of so great pain, that the most torturing wheels, and the most ardent
fires are nothing in comparison of it, if it be true (which those of that party
say) that it is ten times hotter than our fire, and that it differs from
Hellfire, in respect of duration only.

Q. And will not such Doctrine as this be a great scandal, and a Rock of
offense to weak Believers, for whom Christ died?

A. Yes.

Q. But is it not the duty of every one that names the name of Christ, to
comfort the feeble-minded, and to support the weak?

A. Yes.

Q. And do not they blaspheme that wor^hy n^me, by the which they are called,
that break a bruised Reed, and quench the smoking Flax?

A. Yes.

Q. And whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Christ;
were it not better for him that a Millstone were hanged about his neck, and
that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea?

A. Yes.

Q Now therefore, seeing we know these things before, should we not beware lest
we also being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from our own
stedfastness?

A. Yes.

Q. But that we may not as Children be tossed to and fro, and carried about
with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,
whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 'Twill highly concern us to be much in
reading the Scriptures, and to use all possible means to help us to understand
the reading, because there are some things in them hard to be understood, which
our Adversaries, the learned of them especially, do wrest for their
confirmation of the doctrine of Purgatory, as of their other inventions?

Object. 1. The Papists glory much in 1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Read it;
Does this place rightly understood confirm their Doctrine of Purgatory fire?

A. No, for if the design of the Apostle be attended unto in this place, we may
with more reason call the unlevened bread eaten in the Land of Promise by the
Israelites, the very identical bread of affliction really eaten by their
Fathers in Egypt, as it was a sign of it; than the fire here mentioned by the
Apostle, their material Purgatory fire, which is no sign of any such fond
invention.

Q. What therefore is the true sense and meaning of this place?

A. If the scope of the place be observed, we shall easily see the meaning of
the place to be nothing but this, viz. That the Faith of Christ being the
Foundation which our Apostle had laid, and indeed the only one which could
possibly be laid: That that which was regularly to be built thereon was
constant confession of Christ in despire of affl^ctions, which like Gold and
Silver, etc. would be refined and purified* not consumed in the (...); but for
any doctrine of worldly wisdom, verse. 18. of prudential complianc^s with the
Persecutors, Jews or Gentiles, If any such earthly material were brought in the
stead of the formentioned constancy, it should be brought suddenly to the
trial; And proving combustible matter, it will not bear that trial (such are
the Doctrines of denying Christ when persecuted) and it shall be so far from
helping this Gnostick complier to any advantage as the hopes it will, that it
shall bring the greatest danger upon him; and if upon timely Repentance, or by
his not having actually denied Christ (for all his superstructing of some
erroneous doctrines) he be more mercifully dealt with by Christ, and freed from
having his portion with Unbelievers, yet it shall go hard with him, as with one
that is involved in a common fire, and hardly escapes out of it.

Object. 2. They urge also, 1 Pet. 3. 19. By which also he went and Preached
unto the Spirits in Prison; Do you think when this Scripture is rightly
considered it will justify their Opinion of Purgatory fire?

A. No* 1. Because the Apostle says that these Spirits that be in Prison, were
disobedient in the days of Noah, verse. 20. And the Papists themselves hold,
that disobedient and impenitent persons go to Hell, but the Souls of Believers
only to Purgatory; so that this place is nothing at all for Purgatory.

2. Because Christ is not said to Preach in the Prison to the Spirits, but to
the Spirits in Prison: The difference betwixt these two expressions is very
great; He preached to them in the days of Noah, who were in Prison in the
days of the Apostles: He Preached to them out of Prison, that are now in
Prison; which is nothing to their purpose.

Object. 3. Mat. 12. 32. Whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come; Hence
they argue that some sins shall be forgiven in the world to come.

A. Not to be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come, is as much as,
shall never be forgiven; so Matthew explains himself, Mat. 12. 31. And so Mark
does express it, Mark 3. 29. Read the places.

O^ject. 4. They urge Mat. 5. 25, 26. read the place. This Prison, says
Bellarmine, is Purgatory, out of which, after the Debt is paid, the Debtor
shall go forth?

A. 1. Some understand the place literally, and if it be so understood, it is
altogether impertinent to the matter in hand.

2. If the place be taken in a spiritual sense, by the Prison must necessarily
be understood Hell (and not Purgatory) whence the Debtor shall never come
forth, because no mere man by his suffering can in a finite time satisfy the
infinite offended Justice of God.

3. And that which may be an argument to them, they interpret other Scriptures
where they meet with the like phrases in the same sense we understand this very
place; see Mat. 1. 25. Genesis 8. 7. Deuteronomy. 34. 6. 1 Samuel 15. 35. and 2 Samuel 6. 23.
So that in brief, in the literal sense, it is impertinent, and in the spiritual
sense it must needs be understood of Hell, whence there is no Redemption.

Q. How many sorts of Prayers are there?

A. Three, viz. Closet, Family and Public.

Q What do you mean by Closet-Prayer?

A. Entering into our Closet alone, and praying unto our Father in secret.

Q. Why is Closet-Prayer necessary?

A. Because those that pray after the manner of Hypocrites, to be seen of men,
have their reward: But if, we pray to the Father in secret, our Father which
sees in secret, shall reward us openly Mat. 6. 5, 6


Q. And must we in our Closet-Prayers pray both for our selves and others?

A. Yes Mat. 6 5, 6 with verse 9
.

Q. When you say you are to pray for others, what do you mean by it?

A. That we ought to pray for all in the Land of the living (which is the only
Land of hope) yea, though they be the greatest sinners, and such Prisoners as
are bound with the bands and setters of their sins; they are Prisoners of hope,
if they have not sinned the sin unto death; and we ought to pray for them.

Q. What do you mean by Family Prayer?

A. Praying in and with our Families for our selves and others.

Q. Why ought we to pray in our Families?

A. Because God will pour out his fury upon the Families that call not on his
Name, as having on them the mark and brand of the accursed Heathens, Ier. 10.
25.

Q. What mean you by Publick-Prayer?

A. Praying in and with the public Assemblies for our selves and others.

Q. Ought not public prayer to be preferred above all Family-private-prayer?

A. Yes, because every particular Believer has special interest and power with
God, and does prevail with him for all desirable blessings; and a multitude of
Believers assembled together in public, will have a greater interest and power
with God in Prayer, than a few met together in a private Family: And therefore
publick-prayer ought to be and will be preferred by all that regard their own
interest, above any Family-private-prayer whatsoever.

Q. Whom does the Preface of the Lords Prayer teach us to pray unto?

A. To our Father who is in Heaven.

Q. And do we by this appellation express our reverence to him, and our Faith
in him, that his Goodness, Will, and his Power can grant our requests for our
selves and others?

A. Yes.

Q. But when mention is made of the Father, do you exclude the Son, or the Holy
Ghost from being prayed unto?

A. No.

Q How and in what order are we to direct our Prayers to the persons of the
blessed Trinity? And whether may we not single out any one of the Persons, to
whom we may direct more immediately such or such a Prayer?

A. The case has so much difficulty in it, that a short answer must not be
exp^cted to so great questions, as are couched in it; yet we will endeavor to
give an answer thereunto, as briefly as we can in these following Conclusions:
Some of which will be of use to us as rules of direction to lead us into the
sound knowledge of these and other mysteries of the Gospel.

1. That in all parts of divine worship, and so in this of Prayer, the Trinity
in Unity, and Unity in Trinity is to be worshipped and respected. Or, That we
ought so to think of God in Prayer as one in Essence, yet three in Persons: and
so as three in Persons, that he is but one in Essence.

2. That we ought so to think in Prayer of some one Person in the Trinity, as
thereby to be led to the other two: The Father being in the Son, and the Son in
the Father, and the Holy Ghost in them both Joh. 14. 9, 10, 16, 17 and 15. 26
Isa. 48. 16
.

3. That in order, we are first to direct our Prayers to the blessed Father;
yet not as first, or chief in honor and dignity above the other two, but as
first in order of subsisting: according as the Scripture in two places, where
the order of the blessed Persons is set down, the Father is first set down in
order of witnessing, 1 Ioh. 5. 7. and invocation and worship, Mat. 28. 19.

4. In singling out any one Person in the blessed Trinity, we are to pitch most
usually on the Father, as he to whom we direct our Prayers through the
mediation of Christ, and by the help of the Holy Ghost: That is the Rule and
method prescribed by Christ, to ask the Father in his Name, Ioh. 16. 23. and
suitable is and has been the usual practice of the Saints: And yet in such
directings of Prayers most what as to the Father in the general intention of
their Spirits, do the Saints mind and eye the other two Persons, and include
them as jointly worshipped; and therefore in their Prefaces of Prayer they do
oftimes mention expressly, that blessed God one in Essence, yet three in
Persons, as he to whom they speak; and in the close they subscribe glory to the
blessed Father, Son and Spirit, three Persons yet one God, etc.

5. We may single out the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, as he to whom we
occasionally present some special request, either by way of Apostrophe, whilst
we are directing our Prayers to the Father, or in way of Ej^culation: as did
Stephen, Acts 7. 59. Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. And so in the instance of
that short prayer of the Converted Thief, Luke 23. 42. Lord, remember me when
thou come into thy Kingdom; and so in that short Prayer of Jacob's, The Angel
which redeemed me from all evil, bless the Lads, Genesis 48. 16. this Angel was
Christ: And in more continued and solemn manner did Abraham pray to that Angel,
Genesis 18. To him did Jacob pray again, and make supplication, by the space
almost of the whole night, and had power over him, Genesis 32. from Verse 24. to
the end, compared with Hos. 12. 3, 4. And the Reasons hereof are evident,

1. Because Prayer is a divine worship of God as God Acts 5. 4
; and therefore due to the Son, and so to the Holy Ghost as well as to the
Father. Romans 10. 13, 14.

2. We are Baptized into the Name of the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as well as
into the Name of the Father: and therefore both the Son and the Holy Ghost may
be particularly and personally invocated, and worshipped as well as the Father
Joh. 14. 1
.

3. We are to believe in the Son, and so in the Holy Ghost as well as in the
Father, and that personally and particularly: and therefore so are to pray to
either. That which the Apostle expounds of the Gentiles trusting in Christ,
Romans 15. 12. the Prophet expressed of their seeking to him, Isa. 11. 10. So
that they are inseparably due to one and the same Christ, upon one and the same
ground; see Romans 10. 13, 14. before mentioned. It is supposed that he on whom
men call, he must be believed on, or else he cannot be called upon by any; and
when the Apostle in the 13. Verse, mentions the Name of the Lord, as that which
is called upon, he in Verse 14. expounds it to be meant of the Lord himself: to
call upon the Lords Name, is to call upon himself.

4. The Lord Jesus promises that he will do what we ask, Ioh. 16. 23, 24. and
therefore he may be sought to do the same; and indeed he proves himself to be
equal with the Father by this argument, because Petitions shall not only be
granted in his Name, but by him: Neither does he make account that this is any
disparagement to the Father, but a glorifying of him, and therefore when he
says, Job. 17. 1. Father glorify thy Son, he immediately adds, that thy Son
also may glorify thee. What is said to prove that in our Prayers we may single
out the Son of God, may serve to prove the same may be done to the Holy Ghost.

Obj. Against this which has been said, it may be objected, we are to ask all
we do ask in the Name of Christ; and therefore how can we be said to ask him,
or Pray to him?

A. 1. The Lord Jesus Christ is asked or prayed unto in that prayer that is put
up to the Father in his Name, Job. 16 23. Christ speaking of the time after his
Resurrection and Ascension, says, In that day ye shall ask me nothing: or
(which is all one) Verily, ye shall ask the Father nothing in my Name, but be
will give it you. He is glorified as God, in that all is done with God in his
Name, and for his Father. For albeit it be sometimes said, For Abraham and
David's sake God will do this or that; yet this is meant in reference to Gods
Covenant of Grace with them, and so to Christ properly, in whom that Covenant
is ratified, Gal. 3. 17. They called on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
every place, 1 Cor. 1. 2. Yet surely they brake not that Rule, Job. 16. 23.
They called on the Father in Christ's Name, even in their calling upon God in
his Name: and Christ as God is also called upon, in that his Father as God is
called upon.

2. In all external worship of God, one Person of the Trinity being Named, the
other are understood, and are not to be excluded: the Trinity being undivided
in worship.

3. If Christ be considered as the Son of God in Essence with the Father, He is
he to whom we come, etc. Coming in Prayer to the Father: If considered as
Mediator, God incarnate, God and Man, He is he by whom we come to the Father,
Heb. 7. 25. and 1 Timothy 2. 5. As the Son of God, He may be, he must be prayed
to, which is God and Man in one Person; but is not prayed to as Man, but as God.

Q. 2. What are those Petitions which you offer up to God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost?

A. They are Six: In the three first we more immediately respect Gods glory; in
the three last our own good.

Q. 101. What do we pray for in the first Petition?

A. In the first Petition [which is, Hallowed by thy Name] we pray that God

.

Q. How is the Kingdom of Grace advanced?

A. By our selves and others, being brought into it, and kept in it.

Q. How manifold is the Kingdom of Grace?

obey, and submit to his will in all things, as the Angels do in Heaven.

Explic. Q Which is the third Petition?

A. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

Q. What is prayed for in this Petition?

A. That God would make us able and willing to know, obey, and to submit to
Gods Will Psa. 119, 33, 34, 35, 36 Deu. 29. 29 1 Samuel 3. 18 Psalm. 39. 9 Job 1.
21, 22 Acts 21. 14
.

Q. What is it that must make us able and willing to do all this?

A. The Grace of God enlightening, and assisting us.

Q. How ought we to know, obey, and to submit to Gods Will?

A. In all things.

Q. What do you mean by Gods Will, which we ought thus to know, obey and submit
to?

A. We are to know and obey the Will of Gods precept Mit. 7. 21 Act. 9. 6 M^c.
6. 8
, and that which he is pleased to require of us; and to submit to the Will of
Gods providence, or that which he is pleased to do with us, and unto us To. 1.
10 1 Pet. 3. 17
.

Q. After what manner ought we to do this?

A. As the Angels Psalm 103. 20, 21.

Q. What do we pray for in this Petition?

A. We pray that we may receive a competent portion of the good things of this
life. Prove. 30. 8.

A. Such a portion as is sufficient and convenient for us, or suitable to our
places and conditions here in this life.

Q Are the things in this life then good in themselves?

A. Yes, although not the only, or principal good things.

Q. How ought we to pray to receive this portion?

A. Of Gods free gift. Iam. 1. 17.

Q. What else do we pray for to enjoy with them?

A. Gods blessing 1 Timothy 4. 4. Psalm. 3^. 16 Prove. 15. 6

Q. Do not those then that trade and work for outward things, without praying
to God for them, take a wrong course to get them, and to have them with a
blessing in a Covenant way?

.

Q. And is it not sufficient that we have these outward things, unless we have
Gods blessing with them?

A. No.

Q. Why do we say, Give us [this day] our daily bread?

A. It is to teach us not to take care for to morrow, and to instruct us that
we must pray daily Luke 11. 3. Mat. 6. 34.
.

Q. And why do we pray for Bread?

A. It is to teach us to moderate our affections to, and desires after earthly
things; and to be content, if we have but necessaries Mat. 6. 31, 32. Heb. 13. 5
.

Q In what Petition do we pray for temporal things?

A. In this fourth Petition.

Q. 105. What do we pray for in the fifth Petition?

A. In the fifth Petition [which is, And forgive us our Debts as we forgive our

from the heart to forgive others.

Explic. Q. Which is the fifth Petition?

A. Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.

Q. What do we pray for in this Petition?

A. We pray that God would pardon all our sins. Psalm. 51. 1.

Q. How do we pray that God would pardon them?

A. We pray that God would pardon them freely of his Grace, for the sake and
merits of Christ. Romans 3. 24.

Q. Why are our sins called Debts?

A. Because they make us Debtors, liable to the wrath, and offended Justice of
God.

Q. Whence have we encouragement to ask of God the forgiveness of our Debts?

A. Because we that are infinitely short of his Goodness, do yet forgive our
debtors. Mat. 6. 14.

Q. How are we enabled to forgive others?

A. By the Grace of God only.

Q. After what manner must we forgive others?

A. From the heart. Mat. 18. 35.

Q. And must we from the heart forgive others their trespasses, as ever we
expect that God should forgive us?

A. Yes. Ephesians. 4 32


Q. 106. What do we pray for in the s^xth Petition?

A. In the sixth Petition [which is, And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil] we pray that God would either keep us from being tempted
to sin, or support and deliver us when we are tempted.

Explic. Q. Which is the sixth Petition?

A. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Q. What is prayed for in this Petition?

tempted to sin Luk 22. 32, 33, 34 2 Samuel 24. 1 with 1 Chronicles. 21. 1
.

Q. How many kinds of temptations be there?

A. Two, 1. Of affliction, which have tendency toward sin, if not sanctified.

2. Of enticement unto sin directly; we pray to be kept from both (if God sees
good.)

Q. And what do we pray for in reference to both these temptations?

A. If it please God to suffer us to be tempted either way, then that he would
support Ps. 55. 22 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9
us under the affliction, and not suffer us to be taken Captives by Satan, and
led into temptation, to be triumphed over by him at his Will Luke 22. 31, 32 1
Pet. 5. 8, 9, 10 Mark 14. 38
.

Q. Is there any thing more prayed for?

A. We pray that God in his due time would deliver us, when we are tempted:
That the affliction may be removed, when it is a burden too great for us to
bear, and that he would lead Captivity captive, and rescue us out of the hands
of Satan 1 Cor. 10. 13 Ephesians. 4. 8
.

Q. 107. What does the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer teach us?

A. The Conclusion of the Lords Prayer [which is, For thine is the Kingdom, the
Power, and the Glory for ever, Amen.] teaches to take our encouragement in
Prayer from God only, and in our Prayers to praise him, ascribing Kingdom, and
Power, and Glory to him; And in testimony of our desire, and assurance to be
heard, we say Amen.

Explic. Q. What is the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer?

A. For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory for ever, Amen.

Q. What does the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer teach us?

A. It teaches us to take our encouragement in Prayer from God only Dan. 9. 18
19*
.

Q. Is this an encouragement to us in Prayer, that the Kingdom, or Rule, or
Sovereignty is Gods, and therefore he may give us what he pleases?

A. Yes Dan. 4. 32, 34, 35
.

Q And that the Power is Gods, and therefore he can do according to and above
all our necessities, let our case be what it will?

A. Yes Genesis 17. 1
.

Q. And that the Glory belongs to God, and therefore we are encouraged from the
glorious excellencies of his nature to expect, and for the furtherance and
promoting of his own honor to desire the fulfilling of our requests?

A. Yes Dan. 4. 36, 37
.

Q. What else does the Conclusion teach us?

A. It teaches us in our Prayers to Praise him, or to join praises to our
Prayers, by ascribing Kingdom, Power and Glory to him only. 1 Chronicles. 29. 11,
12, 13.

Q. And is Gods Kingdom, Power and Glory then the matter both of Gods praise,
and of our encouragement?

A. Yes.

Q. Is God praised by us in our ascribing all Kingdom, Power and Glory to him,
and in extoling his excellencies and Prerogatives?

A. Yes. 1 Timothy 6. 15, 16.

Q. How long must we thus glorify, and praise God?

A. For ever 1 Timothy 1. 17 and 2. 4, 18
.

Q. And why do we say [ Amen] as the Conclusion of this and of all our Prayers?

A. In testimony of our desire and assurance to be heard.

Q Is that then the meaning of our saying, Amen, in the close of our Prayers;
So let it be, and so it shall be, as such phrases imply both earnestness in
desiring, and confidence of speeding?

A. Yes Psalm. 20. 5 Isa. 26. 9 2 Cor. 1. 20 Mat. 21 22 Ephesians. 3. 20, 21
.

The Creed.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty* maker of Heaven and Earth: And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the
Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, dead and buried, he
descended into That is, Continued in the state of the dead, and under the power
of Death till the third day.
Hell, the third day he rose again from the dead, he ascended into Heaven, and
sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come
to judge the quick and the dead: I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy
Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of Sins, the
Resurrection of the Body, and the Life Everlasting. Amen.

The Ten Commandments.
Exodus 20. GOD spoke all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which
have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage.

1. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.

2. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in
the Water under the Earth: Thou shall not bow down thy self to them, not serve
them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that
hate me: and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
Commandments.

3. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: Six days shall thou labor and
do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it
thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy
Manservant, nor thy Maidservant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy Stranger that is
within thy Gates: For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the Seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the
Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

5. Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long upon the Land
which the Lord thy God gives thee.

6. Thou shall not Kill.

7. Thou shall not commit Adultery.

8. Thou shall not Steal.

9. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy Neighbor.

10. Thou shall not covet thy Neighbors House, thou shall not covet thy
Neighbors Wife, nor his Manservant, nor his Maidservant, nor his Ox, nor his
Ass, nor any thing that is thy Neighbors.

The Lords Prayer.
Matthew. 6. OUR Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom
come. Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our Debts as we forgive our Debtors. And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power,
and the Glory for ever. Amen.

Acts 8. 30. Understandest thou what thou read?
GOD avouched Israel to be his peculiar people; In Judah is God known, his Name
is great in Israel. Deuteronomy. 26. 18 Psalm. 76. 1
God erected a partition wall between the Jew and the Gentile; Acts 10. 35
but Christ took it down, And now in every Nation be that fears God, and
works righteousness is accepted with him. Genesis 9, and 10
And this Ethiopian Eunuch, although of the Line of cursed^ Ham, becomes a
Believer upon Philip's Preaching to him Jesus. 1 Cor. 1. 26
We see how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
noble are called: Yet there are some of the most Noble, and Officers of great
honor and trust, whom God is pleased to call over to himself. Of this chosen
and royal Priesthood, whom God called out of darkness into his mavelous
light, were David, Solomon, Ieh^shaphat. You may read David's conquests, 2 Samuel
8. and 10. Chapters; Solomon's honor, 2 Chronicles. 1. 12. How the Realm of
Iehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round about, 2 Chronicles. 17. 6.
and 20. 30. And you see of what Authority this Eunuch was under Candace Queen
of the Ethiopians, Verse 27. The Law is our Schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ: Gal. 3. 24
Yea even Proselytism it self is here an Introduction to such a blessing.
Philip had a Vision, and therein an Angel from Heaven spoke unto him, to go
toward the South, unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which
is desert; where he light on the Ethiopian Eunuch, Verse. 26, 27. And finding
him studious of the way of God, reading the Evangelical Prophet, verse. 28. by
prophetic divine efflation, or revelation he is directed to go near to the
Chariot, and speak to him, verse. 28. The which he did with the greatest
readiness, running to the Chariot, and there hearing him read Esaias the
Prophet, said to him in the words of the Text, Understand thou what thou
read? Which words we may call the Deacons serious profitable question to the
Eunuch with set purpose (according to the guidance of Gods Spirit) to be an
Interpreter unto him. The division of the words would be more curious than
useful.

That every sincere serious Christian that does in good earnest look after the
Salvation of his Soul will diligently read the holy Scriptures, is here to be
supposed, as implied in the godly practice of this Eunuch: the Doctrinal truth
to be insisted upon as more express is this,

Doct. That we ought not to content our selves with the bare reading of the
holy Scriptures, but should labor to understand what we read of them. And here
you have, 1. The proof of this Doctrine. 2. Some Rules for the better
understanding the holy Scriptures.

3. The Application.

1. This Doctrine is proved --

1. By the practice of the Church of God in all Ages: Read Neh. 8. 8. and this
practice was not abrogated by Christ or his Apostles, but ratified and
confirmed. Christ expounded to the two Disciples that went to Emaus in all the
Scriptures, Luke 24. 27 Luke 4. 16, to the 22.
the things concerning himself. And you find Christ reading the Book of Esaias
the Prophet, and expounding that Scripture of himself, as that day fulfilled in
their ears by his Preaching to them. You find the Apostle James alleges this,
why they should not require or force them to be Circumcised, who from Gentiles
turned Christians; for Acts 15. 21. says he, Moses of old has in every City
them that Preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day. As if he
had said* Nor need we Jews to fear that this will bring a contempt upon Moses,
or our Law; For the contrary appears by the Christian practice, even where
these Proselytes of the Gentiles are, there the Books of Moses, as has been
customary from of old, are still continued among them, to be read aloud in the
Synagogue every Saturday, (to which the Council of Laodic^a did after add the
reading of a Chapter in the New Testament) to signify their respect to the
Mosaical Law, and their not offering it contempt among the Proselytes, though
they did not require them to be Circumcised: And Acts 13. 15, etc. you may read
Paul's approbation, continuation, and recommendation of this laudable custom to
us by his own practice. And that all Nations may be taught our of the holy
Scriptures the things that are commanded them of Christ, Mat. ^8. 19, ^0
he has promised his special presence with Ministers unto the end of the
world. Now to him that shall Question this in our days, I shall give him the
two Disciples answer to Christ; art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have
not known the things which have been, and are of ordinary practice with us
every Lords day?

2. By the command of God, Ioh. 5. 39. with Prove* 2. 4, 5. Till I come give
attendance to reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine, i. e. Betwixt this and the
time of my coming to thee, see thou be diligent in performing thy office in the
several parts of it, expounding the Scriptures, confirming Believers, and
admonishing them of any fault or danger, and instructing the ignorant or
unbelievers.

Some few Rules for the better understanding, and our more profitable reading
the holy Scriptures: And these are either Antecedent, Concomitant, or
Subsequent.

1. Antecedent Rules.
1. We must pray and beg of God wisdom to understand the Scriptures. Jam. 1. 5
Psa. 119. 18
We must pray with David, that God would open our eyes, that we may behold
wondrous things out of his Law. We must pray that God would acquaint us with
the mystery of the Gospel; For if the Gospel be hid, 2 Cor. 4. 7
it is hid to those that are lost.

2. We must lay aside all vain conceit of our own wisdom, be humble and hearken
to God alone, speaking in the Scriptur^s. God has so disposed the way to
Heaven, that the most ignorant and most humble, not the most illuminate and
most proud, shall be most ready to receive and embrace the Gospel. Mat. 11. 25


And we must account our own wisdom foolishness, 2 Cor. 3. ^
that we may know the holy Scriptures, which are able to make us wise unto
Salvation. We must lie low in the fight and sense of our own ignorance, arguing
thus with our selves; Have we lived so long, and read the Scriptures so often,
and know so little of them! Let us thus be wail our ignorance, for the humble
God will teach. The rain falls upon the Rock, but rests not there, that it may
make the Valleys fruitful: Divine heavenly wisdom will not rest upon a proud
heart, but will enrich the lowly with its treasures.

We must hearken to God alone, speaking in the Scriptures. Humanum est errare,
there is no infallible Judge upon Earth. If any man Preach any other Doctrine
unto us, than that we have received from the Canonical Scriptures, G^l. 1. 9
let him be accursed. If Pope or Council, or Pope and General Council agreeing
together, decree or determine any thing against or besides the holy Scriptures;
Let God be True, and every man a Liar, in this case we are not to attend to a
Thus faith a Father, or a Pope, or Council, etc. but to a Thus says the Lord.

3. We must go to the Scriptures without prejudice. Non re^erendus est sensus,
sed auferendus; We must not bring but take our sense from the Scriptures; lest
we wrest them to our own destruction. Take care no body plunder you, rob you of
all that you have, your principles of Christian knowledge through Philosophy,
or by such vain, empty, frothy, pretended knowledge and wisdom which the
Gnostics of old talked so much of, Col. 2. 8
taken out of Pythagoras; together with the observances of the Mosaical Law,
and very distant and contrary to Christian Divinity.

4. We must go to the Scriptures with a mind purified by Faith and Repentance,
Mark 1. 15 2 Timothy 3. 8 Jam. 1. 21 Isa. 55 1, 2, 3
and in which is the study of Piety. We must lay aside all filthiness and
superfluity or naughtiness when we go to the waters of life.

5. We must go with reverence and love of the truth. We must go with reverence
to the holy Scriptures, 1 These* 2 13*
because of their Author and matter. We must go to the Scriptures as to the
Oracles of God and the Laws of Heaven; the which we must stand in awe of, and
be subject to for Conscience sake. We must go with the love of the truth
although it be against flesh and blood, and thwart and contradict self and
carnal interest in the world. The want of this love of the truth, is given as
the reason of that fatal miscarriage of the Gnostics, 2 These. 2 ^0
those carnal Christians.

6. We must go to the Scriptures with full purpose of heart to do the Will of
God, Ioh. 7. 17. 2 Tit. 11. 12. Luke 11. 28. The fear of the Lord is a step to
wisdom, Psalm. 111. 10. Prove. 1. 7. Quia finis Scripturae non est nuda scientia,
sed praxis.

2. Concomitant Rules.
1. Non est recedendum a litera legis absque summa necessitate. When the words
of Scripture may, without any incommodity or incongrui^y, be taken properly,
and as they sound and lie in the Text, they ought to be so taken: neither are
they to be infl^cted to metaphors, Nunquam ad mataphoras ^fugi^ndum est sine
necessitate. B^
or other Tropes, or improper senses, unless when out of the words taken
properly some absurd interpretations should from thence be elicited, Aug. Hence
it follows that they are the best Interpreters, who most promptly and apertly
manifest the native and genuine sense. In which part without boasting it may be
said that the Protestants exceed the Papists* and carry away the Palm: Because
their Interpreters are wont (...), as Occumenius says in Ephesians. 5. to evert the
propriety of speech, and to turn all things into the uncertain conjectures of
Allegories. That what Epiphanius in Nicolaitis said of Origin, we may say of
them, (...), Allegorice explic^t quicquid potest; He allegorized whatsoever he
could. Indeed it is said that he interpreted literally Matthew 19. 12. and in
the same sense became an Eunuch himself: And so the Papists in like manner
interpret mostly in the Allegory, excepting that known place, This is my Body,
with a far greater and more dangerous mistake than that of Origen's, of that
kind of Eunuchs.

But this Head is too general to be laid down without some necessary cautions:
Take these few,

1. Augustini Regula tenenda est, lib. 3. de doctrina Christiana, Cap. 5, 10,
and 11. Cavendum est ne figuratam locutionem ad literam accipiamus: and vice
versa, ne locutio propria in figuratum sensum torqueatur. Let Us take heed of
taking figures literally, and of wresting the proper sense into figures.

2. It is to be supposed that some places of Scripture are true, both in the
Type and Antitype, both in the literal and mystical sense. And, Verba sacrae
Scripturae sunt praegnantia, pariunt gemellos and sensum geminum admittunt. The
words of S^cred Writ are pregnant with matter, very fruitful, and sometimes
bear twins and admit a double sense: And it is an unerring Rule in Divinity;
Scripture is always to be expounded in the largest sense; unless there be in
or about the Text some particular restriction to limit it; and thus those
words, Psalm. 109 8 and Acts 1 20.
Let another take his Office, are true both of Doeg and Judas.

3. It is to be observed, that in Prophecies some particulars agree to the
Type, and not to the Truth; some to the Truth, and not to the Type; or to the
Type in one sense, to the Truth in another. Take this Head because somewhat
large in its particular branches.

1. Some particulars agree to the Type and not to the Truth. Psalm. 40. 12.

2. Some to the Truth, and not to the Type. Psalm. 16. 10. with Acts 2. 29. and
13. 35, 36, 37.

3. Or to the Type in one sense, and to the Truth in another. So in those
Psalms wherein David is a Type of Christ: As Psalm. 2. and 16. and 22. and those
in which Solomon; as psalm. 45. and 72. Some things are spoken that must of
necessity be understood of them in one Notion; of Christ in another. Of
Pharaoh's Daughter espoused to Solomon; and the Church to Christ; the one
typified by the other, Psalm. 45. the same may be said. Gatak. in Isa. 42.

But how may we know when we are to interpret in the literal, and when in the
mystical sense?

These three Rules will in some measure direct us.

1. The first is Augustines golden Rule, Si praeceptiva locutio est aut
flagitium aut facinus vetans, etc. If it be a precept forbidding any lewdness,
or commanding something profitable or beneficial, there is no figure in the
words, Take, eat, 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25
this do in remembrance of me. This do ye, as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me. Indeed, This is my Body, etc. cannot be taken in the literal
sense, for the reasons to be mentioned afterward; But take, eat, etc. because
a preceptive speech, and commanding a necessary profitable duty, and I am
afraid a much neglected duty too, we are not to suppose a figure in the words.
If there be sins of Plura sunt peccata privativa quam positiva.
Omission, as without controversy there are; then those who have not
communicated in this Ordinance, or not frequently, cannot but be found guilty
of a dangerous sinful neglect. Nothing but ignorance and Phanaticism in the
most proper and literal sense can turn this divine precept into an Allegory.
Some are so fond as to think that this Precept imports no more than feeding
upon Christ out of and in contempt of this Sacrament: Such self-conceited
Gnostics cannot rationally expect the Churches welcome, Eat O Friends, drink,
yea drink abundantly, O beloved. And if ever such Spiritualists were really fed
by Christ, they were no doubt better fed than taught. But if any man seem to be
contentious, we have not so learned Christ, neither the Churches of God.

2. When the Text taken properly affords a fit sense, nor does ought appear in
the Context, or other places collated that may cross it, it is not safe running
into metaphorical senses. And thus we understand those Buyers and Sellers, whom
our Savior cast out of the T^mple, Mat. 21. 12. in the Letter, and not in the
Allegory; although some Novellists of our times, giving way to their own
luxuriant fancies, have turned this, and all the History of the Gospel into a
mystery, or rather a groundless conceit of their own brains.

3. Indeed when the words taken in the Letter are absurd and contradictory to
sense and reason, we must of necessity apply our selves to the figurate sense.
And surely he is brutish and has not the understanding of a man, that will
Interpret against all sense and reason. Reason does not contradict sense, nor
Faith reason, but only correct them when they exercise themselves in great
matters, and in things too high for them, and beyond their Sphere: And it is fit
that sense should give place to reason, and reason to Faith; as it did in
Abraham's case, who, Rom 4. 18. [against Hope, or rather beyond Hope] (as the
words may be better rendered) i. e. above all causes, arguments and appearances
of natural Hope, such as reason and humane understanding could afford or reach
to [believed in Hope] i. e. in Hope grounded upon the truth and power of God.
For although there be in Scripture, 1 Pet. 3. 16
(...), some things hard to be understood, yet there is nothing in it repugnant
to right reason. Although in this life and imperfect state, we see (...),
through a glass darkly, and do know (...), but in part; And, Quoad nos, there
may not always be ratio rei (^creditae) yet there is always ratio credendi;
Because infinite wisdom cannot be deceived, and infinite goodness will not
deceive. And according to the forementioned Rules, we may be satisfied against
the Papists literal interpretation of that known place, This is my Body.

1. Because the letter is contrary and repugnant to our senses; which the
Scripture it self intimates to be of infallible certainty.

2. It is absurd and contradictive of right reason.

3. There appears much in the context to cross it, nothing at all to
countenance it.

4. Because other places collated, expressly thwart and contradict it.

2. Rule. Let the fuller Scripture make out the shorter. We must compare the
shorter place with the larger, i. e. the place that speaks but briefly of a
thing, with some other that speaks of it more at large, common observation
tells us, that it is not the right method to read abstracts first; because
though they be fuller of matter, they are fuller likewise of obscurity. And
sometimes that of the learned Bacon proves true, That Epitomes are the
corruptions and moths of Histories. Epitomes give us the substance of a matter;
but full Narratives must clear it up to us, with all its due circumstances. A
compendium gives us the Quintessence; Virtue, Force and Spirit of a thing; but
the History at large is necessary to the right understanding of it.

3. Let the clearer Scripture clear the obscurer. We must compare the obscurer
with the clearer, i. e. if any place occur which is more obscure, but elsewhere
propounded to us in words that are more clear; we must have recourse to it to
clucid^te the ^ormer. We must compare Moses with the Prophets: Of all the
Prophets Esaias speaks most clearly, who is therefore styled the Evangelical
Prophet, and seems rather to write the History than the Prophecy of Christ. We
must compare the Old Testament with the New: In the N^w Testament the Book of
the Revelations is deemed (by those Interpreters that are wise unto sobriety,
and not above what is written) to stand in most need of interpretation by the
other written Revelations. The Sacred Scriptures are written very much
historically; the Doctrines being interspersed with the History. Some
Eyangelists speak more clearly than others; some most clearly of one part of
the History of Christ, some of another; that all of them collated (without
conspiring together by a contrived design) might give us the complete History
of Christ. That you may see the usefulness of this Rule, consult Ioh. 16. 16,
17, 18. with 28, 29 verses compared together.

4. Let that Scripture determine the point that intends it. You must compare
Scripture with Scripture, and you must compare them aright; compare the place
that speaks, ex casu, occasionally of a matter, with some other, where it is
the main design of the place. This Rule is to be attended unto in the
Exposition of Parables: For, if we be strict observers of all by-passages in
them; instead of Milk, we shall wring till blood comes. We must remember that
Allegories must not be strained too much, and that similitudes answer not in
all Lines, but in the chiefest. Read for this purpose Luke 16.

5. Out of the scope and intention of the writer is often collected the sense
of his words. And the scope of the writer may be guessed at by the following
circumstances, viz. Quorsum, quibus, contra quos, quae, ex cujus persona; Why,
to whom, against whom or what, of whose person, he writes, which last
circumstance clears most passages, relating to the Eunuchs Q^estion.

6. Compare Antecedents and consequents in the place, whose sense is dubious,
and it will much conduce to the right understanding of it. Where there is not
light enough in the Text, there may be a light shining round about it, in the
Context, to enlighten it.

7. Negatives are more extensive than affirmatives. Affirmativa non valent
ubique ad semper, negativa ubique; or thus, Affi^mativa valent semper, negativa
ad semper. When God says, Pray; it is always true, while in this
prob^tionsta^e, that we must pray; but it is not true that we must pray
always, i.^. do nothing but pray: But when it is said, Thou shall, not Kill,
etc. This is our duty at all times, there is no time wherein it is lawful to
Kill, commit Adultery, etc.

8. Let an exception straiten and narrow a general Rule. Jer. 44 14, 27, 28
Mat. 19. 6 with 9.
Exceptio firmat Regulam in non exceptis, terminum praescribit in exceptis. An
exception confirms the Rule in things not excepted, and bounds it against the
rest.

9. Non est distinguendum, ubi Lex non distingui^. We must not distinguish
where the Law does not warrant it. In Christ Jesus neither Circumcision
avails any thing, Gal. 6. 15
nor uncircumcision, but a new Creature. If this Rule be attended unto, we
shall easily understand how nice the distinctions of Conformity and
nonconformity are, and how unavailable either of them will be in attaining
Salvation for us without a reformed life.

10. We must carefully distinguish of the Scripture, which speaks of the growth
of the Church, from that which speaks of the infancy of it. And thus, as for
the Discipline of the Church of England, our English Reformers considered what
it was in the purest times of the first good Christ an Emperors, when the
Church was in its growth: For the times of Persecution in the infancy of the
Church (before temporal Princes embraced the Christian Faith) as they were most
excellent times for doctrine and manners; so very unproper and unfit for a
Pattern or example of outward Government and Policy. And doubtless, that
Government is most excellent, both in the community as Christian, and in the
special notion as reformed, that keeps the middle way between the Pomp of
superstitious Tyranny, and the meanness of Phanatick Anarchy: And this can be
nothing else, but a w^^l regulated moderate Episcopacy, according to this Rule.

11. That which the Scripture holds forth at all times, must not be prejudiced
by what may take in one particular case: although, Necessitas est jus temporis,
Necessity be a Law in its time. This is a Rule at all times, Borrow and pay
again: This must not be prejudiced by that of the Israelites borrowing of the
Egyptians. This must not determine, Ehud destroyed Eglon, therefore thou shall
kill, because it is not safe arguing from particulars to general duties.

12. Out of the Tradition and Interpretation of the truly Catholic Church, out
of the consent of the Fathers; and of these, either of many or of few of them
when eminent for sanctity or learning; out of the unanimous conspiration of
Doctors and Interpreters, the true and literal sense of Holy Writ may be often
cleared up unto us.

By universal Tradition is meant, Quod ab omnibus, quod ubique, quod semper
receptum fuit. What all the Churches of Christ in all places, have ever
successively received, that is universal Tradition; and he is no true Catholic
that does not receive it. Where there is a Catholic consent and harmony to
bear witness to any Interpretation, and that sense is universally and solemnly
accepted; as it will seem a wilful error to d^p^rt from it, and to choose
solitary and dangerous bypath, where the open road is so free and safe; so
what can be expected in such singularity, but many absurdities, and
implications, and violences offered to the word and truth?

13. We must interpret according to the Analogy of Faith. Romans 12. 6 2 Timothy 1.
13
We must hold fast the form of sound words. Examine the Interpretations of the
holy Scriptures by those three Forms, the Creed, the ten Commandments, and the
Lords Prayer. Mistake not, you are not to examine the Scriptures by any thing
else, nor the sense of them neither by any Creed farther than it contains it
self within the very terms verbal or real of the holy Scriptures themselves.
But as the Creed contains it self within such terms, we are to hold it fast as
a form of sound words. And as by the ten Commandments, we may discern what are
the words of God, and what are the Commandment of men; and by the Lords Prayer,
what Petitions we are to put up to God, and what Prayers we are to say Amen to:
so by the Creed we may know what doctrines are of God, and what of men: And let
what will be pretended, if any man teach otherwise, and consent not to these
wholesome words; he is proud, knowing nothing, he is of a corrupt mind, and
r^probate concerning the Faith.

I shall conclude this Head in the words of judicious Mr. Calvin, Expertus
pridem sum, and quidem saepius, quicunque de verbis pertinacius litigant,
fovere occultum virus; ut magis expediat eos ultro prov^care quam in eorum
gratiam obscurius loqui: And the liberty of not using the very words of
Scripture on some occasions, has ever been accounted lawful in the Church of
Christ; and is at some times very necessary for the obviating of growing
Heresies.

Where all these Helps are either wanting, or do not avail us, as to some
particulars and single clauses, not so necessary to be known; The Hebrew and
Greek Idiotisms (elegancies or proprieties) may possibly guide us to the true
and genuine sense and interpretation.

3. Subsequent Rules.
1. We must pray again. Aug.
Orationi lectio, lectioni succedat Oration. We must pray and read, read and
pray again.

2. We must medi^a^e upon the Scriptures we have read and understood, and that
sometimes will lead us into the true meaning of those which in our course of
reading we understand not: For Scripture will give light to Scripture.

3. We must both before and after our reading the holy Scriptures, get the
guidance of Gods holy Spirit. Methinks I hear God saying to each of you that
are much in reading the ^o^y ^criptures, Understand you what you read? And you
again saying to God, How can we, except thy holy Spirit guide us! Ask my
beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ, and it shall be given, Luke 11. 9, 13.

Suffer the word of Exhortation; You that are much in reading the holy
Scriptures; content not your selves with bare reading, but in the use of all
attainable means endeavor to understand what you read of them.

To persuade hereunto take these two Motives.

1. The bare reading of the holy Scriptures will be unprofitable to you. It
will be to you as he that speaks in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14. 2, 9, 14
whom none of you understands; or as he that speaks into the air, whose
speech is unfruitful. Indeed the Scripture is the Water of life, but to you the
fountain is sealed. It is as the Garden of the Lord; But behold Cherubims, and
a flaming Sword, Genesis 3. 24
which turns every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life. You are kept out
of this Garden, while you are kept ignorant of the true sense and meaning of
the Scripture, which is as the Soul and Life of it. It is a Vision, but the
Vision becomes to you as the words of a Book that is Sealed, which men deliver
to one that is learned, saying, Read this I pray thee; and he says, I cannot,
for it is Sealed. By what has in brief been said, you see that the bare
unintelligent reading of the holy Scriptures themselves, Isa. 44. 10
is in this like a a Graven Image which we are sure is profitable for nothing.

2. But contrariwise, if you understand what you read, the Scripture of all
writings, will be the most profi^able unto you, 2 Timothy 3. 16. It Is by way of
eminency called The Scripture, as the Original first writing, as the
handwriting of God.

It is in Genere materiae, sufficient to save our souls. It is as that Tree
mentioned, Psalm. 19. and 119.
Rev. 22. 2. which bare twelve manner, and yielded her fruit every month; and
the leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nation^. There is more
weight in one Sentence of Scripture than in all Orations, Declamations, Poets,
Satyrs, and Philosophic invectives. It was a wise observation of Scaliger,
that some passages in Plato are wiser than their Author, and many excellent
conceits are recollected from Homer and Aristotle they never dreamed of: But in
the Word of God it is quite contrary, for after all the recollections that have
been made by the most acute Sages of the world; we must say with the Queen of
Sheba in another case, the one half has not been told us. I shall therefore
conclude this Exhortation and Discourse in the words of holy and learned
Baxter, As you love your Comfort, your Faith, your Hope, your Safety, your
Innocence, your Souls, your Christ, your Everlasting Rest; Love, Reverence,
Read, Search, Study, Obey, and stick close to the Scriptures.

FINIS.
