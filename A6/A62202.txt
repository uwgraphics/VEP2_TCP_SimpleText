These Arms disarmed us, and Rebellion nursed;
It Is not for Nothing They are no^ Reversed.


SATYR ON THE ADULTERATE COIN INSCRIBED THE COMMONWEALTH, etc.
THat Commonwealth which was our Common-woe,
Did Stamp for Current, That, which must not Go:
Yet it was well to Pass, till Heaven thought meet
To show both This, and That were Counterfeit.
Our Crosses were their Coin! Their God our Hell!
Till Savior Charles became Emanuel.
But now -- The Devil take their God! Avaunt
Thou molten Image of the Covenant!
Thou lewd Impostor! State's, and Traffique's Sin!
A Brazen Bulk, faced with a Silver Skin!
Badge of Their Saints-Pretences, without doubt!
A Wolf within, and Innocence without!
Like to Their Masqu'd Designs! Rebellion
Film'd with the Tinsell of Religion!
Metal on Metal, here, we may disclose;
Like Sear-cloth stripped from Cromwell's Copper Nose.
Thou Bastard Relic of the Traiterous Crew!
A mere Invent, to Give the Devill's Due!
Or (as a Learned Modern Author says)
In their Own Coin, to Pay the Public Faith!
Heavens! I thank you! that, in mine Extreme,
I never loved Their Money More than Them!
Cursed be those Wights! whose Godliness was Gain,
Spoiling Gods Image in Their Sovereign!
They made Our Angell's Evil! and it is known,
Their Cross and Harp were Scandal to the CROWN.
Had, amongst the Jews, Their Thirty Pence been used
When Judas truckt for's Lord, 't had bin refused.
Worse than that Coin which our Boys, Fibbs do call!
A Scottish Twenty-Pence is Worth them All!
To their eternal Shame, be it brought to the Mint!
Cast into Medalls: and Their Names Stamped in it!
That Charon (when they come for Waftage ore)
May doubt his Fare, and make them wait on shore:
For, if Repentance ransom any thence,
Know! -- Charles his Coin must pay their Peter Pence.
