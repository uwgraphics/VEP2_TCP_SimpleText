An ACCOUNT OF A MOST Horrid Conspiracy, Against the Life of His Most Sacred
Majesty, February the 24 th. 1696. The Relation take as follows, viz.
ON Friday night last (upon an Information of a Treacherous Design against the
present Government,) the Guards at Whitehall and Kensington were doubled, and
the next day being Saturday his Majesty, as it is said, received a Letter from
one of the Conspirators, intimating that there were Forty or Fifty Ruffians
that had undertaken to Assassinate him as he went to Chapel; upon which a
Council was called, and Warrants issued out against a great many of these
Villains, of which Number the Following Persons are said to be, viz. Sir G.
Barlet, Capt. Walbank, Lieutenant Bartlet, Captain Fitz-Partrick, Sir William
Perkins, Mr. Boggs, Mr. King, Captain Durance, Captain Maxwell, Mr. Cranburne,
Mr. Charnock, Mr. Porter, etc. Capt. Stow, Capt. Courtney, Mr. B. Blaire, Mr.
Holmes, Major Holmes, Mr. Langhorn, Capt. Knightley, Mr..... Langhorne, Mr.
Pendergrass, Captain Bierly, Major Lowick,


And we hear Fifteen, or more of them are taken: All their Party were to be
Ready on this Occasion to carry on their bloody Tragedy, and if we may believe
what is say, the Duke of Berwick is arrived in this City to Head the Rebellion,
and the late King James is at Callais, designing to Embark for England.

These Persons concerned have been observed to be upon the Parrade at
Whitehall, and likewise at Kensington for several days past. Diverse of them are
known to be Irish Papist.
