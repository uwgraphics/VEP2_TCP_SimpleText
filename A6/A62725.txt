TO THE HONORABLE House of Commons.
The Humble Petition and Case of Henry Mortlock, Matthew Gilliflower, William
Hensman, Thomas Fox, and John Fish, Booksellers in Westminster Hall.
WHEREAS Your Petitioners, whose Names are abovementioned, are, and have been,
for these Two Years past, very much obstructed in their Trade by the Scaffolds
erected there the beginning of November 1678. for Trial of the Lords in the
Tower, which at first totally obscured the Light of their Shops, which, for
some Months, we were forced to keep shut, and after put to the great Trouble
and Expense of removing them without, where they now stand, to the manifest
loss of our Trade, which has ever since been diverted from this Place.

And whereas some others of our Profession have endeavored to make Interests
for procuring an Order from this Honorable House, for Printing the daily
Proceedings, Votes, or what else this Honorable House shall approve of to be
Printed.

We do therefore most humbly beg the Favor of this Honorable House, when any
such Matter shall come before them, or when they shall think fit to appoint
Printers in that behalf, to consider the great Damage sustained by your
Petitioners in point of Trade; And to bestow that Service upon us, who are so
near, and shall be always ready to express our Duty and Service to the utmost
of our Endeavors, as,

Your most Faithful and Obedient Servants. Henry Mortlock, Matthew Gilliflower,
William Hensman, Thomas Fox, John Fish.
