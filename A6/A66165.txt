His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Take this Occasion with great willingness to Assure you, that I am extremely
sensible of the Zeal and Cheerfulness of all your Proceedings in this Sessions
of Parliament, and of the Readiness which you, Gentlemen of the House of
Commons, have shown, in Granting such large Supplies toward the pressing
Occasions of the Navy and Army.

And I do farther Assure you, that I shall not be wanting on My Part to see
them carefully Applied to those Uses for which you intend them.

At the same time I must observe to you, that the Posture of Affairs abroad
does necessarily require My Presence at the Hague before the end of this Year;
and by consequence I must Desire you to lose no Time in the Dispatching and
Perfecting of such further Supplies as are still necessary for the Navy and
Army: And not for them only, but it is high time also to put you in mind of
making some Provision for the Expense of the Civil Government, which has no
Fonds for its Support, since the Excise, which was designed for that Service,
as also the other Branches of the Revenue, have been Applied to other Public
Uses; And therefore I earnestly Recommend it to your speedy Consideration.

FINIS.
