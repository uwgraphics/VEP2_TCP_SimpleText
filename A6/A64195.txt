A PRETER-PLVPERFECT, Spick and Span New NOCTURNALL, or Mercuries Weekly
Night-Newes; wherein the Public Faith is published, and the Banquet of Oxford
Mice described.
Saturday night.
I Would have the Reader to understand that Night-worke and Day-worke is not
all one, and as our London Diurnals (although the Writers of them have Daylight
to see to write truly, yet for all that they do often stumble into most gross
errors, which some are so bold as to call very Lies: therefore my self that
am fain to grope in the dark, (or at the best in the Moon shine) I hope, if I
chance to ramble a little at one side now and then, it may be imputed to the
darkness of the Times wherein it was written, and that want of eyesight caused
oversight; and whereas we begin our Diurnals on Mondayes, and Oxford News
begins on Sundays, I must be contrary to them both, and begin on
Saturday-night, as follows;

This Night (without any vain flourishing, lying, or Whartoning) there happened
a very strange accident at Oxford, where near the upper end of the Butchers
Row, within a quoytes cast of Carfax, there dwells one George Chambers a
Stationer or Bookseller, who since these distracted Troubles has bought and
sold many Pamphlets of diverse and contrary subjects; some of them being of His
Majesty's part, and printed at York, and at Oxford; many of them were of the
Parliament party, and printed at London, so that there remained unsold in the
said Shop of such sorts (as were stale and past sale) to the number of 160, or
thereabouts; these small Trifles were laid one upon another confusedly (like a
pack of Cards shuffled together) so these Books were intermingled together,
friends and foes, Truths and Lies, all in a heap, one amongst another, tied
in a bundle with a packthred, the Owner intending to have every sort of them
bound by themselves afterward. All these Divisions being thus accorded with a
cord, (or parcel of Hemp, which will end all Divisions) were laid upon a
shelfe in the Shop; to which Trusse, Fardle, Magazine, Mass, or Chaos of
Confusion, an Army of Mice came (on the Saturday Night) a Book-haling, where
they valiantly assaulted this Bulwark of Books, playing the Pioners part so
valiantly, that with tooth and nail they entered the papyreall Suburbs, and
never left undermining till they had made way, tyrannically tearing through the
Territories of that Babel, gnawing and eating their passage with their sharp
fanges, (as Hannibal did eat his way through the Alps with Vinegar) many of
them being almost choked with eating of three Words, only Cavalier,
Malignant, and Delinquent, the Frogs of Egypt never had such a Banquet in
Pharaohs Court, it would trouble Vitellius his Purveyers, Heliogabalus his
Clerk of the Kitchen, or Sardanapalus his Master Cook to have made the Bill of
fare, provided the acates, or dressed the Diet, the several Dishes were as
follows. (I pray you pardon me if I err in the manner of the service, for
(it was night and no order was kept in the eating) but to the Diet, of which
were all these several Dishes following.

These valiant Vermin fell first upon some famous Volumes, namely Plain
English, the Observator, Mercurius Civicus, the Continuation, Sir John Rays
eight Speeches, Master Prin's 19th and last Volume, Master Speakers Parallel
between a Parliament and Wife, Sergeant Wilds Argument for a new Great Seal,
Sir Simon Dewes his Revelation, Master Callamie his purgation of perjurie, M.
Marshall his Letter (written to himself and devised by himself) M. Pym's
deliverance from the dangerous Plague plaster, (which indeed was by his own
device taken from a galled Horse back) after that the Mice began to nibble at
Sir Benjamin Rudiard's Speeches, but finding them lukewarm (too cold for the
King, and too hot for the Parliament) they left them, and fell to
Anticavalerisme, then they fell to feed upon Queres, Mistakes, Fears,
Iealousies, Malignancies, Doubts, Orders, Ordinances, Votes; these they
assaulted, and quickly made spoil of. Then there were many printed Books,
wherein His Majesty had Declared His Gracious intention to all His loving
Subjects, as Expressions, Declarations, Exhortations, Admonitions,
Protestations, Imprecations, Proclamations, Demonstrations, and of all these
the Mice would not eat one bit, but courageously they fell upon Remonstrances,
Letters, Messages, Passages, Treaties, Animadversions, Exprobrations,
Exclamations, Objections, Questions, Answers, Replies, Replications,
Reduplications, Quadruplications, Detractions, Distractions, Rebellions,
Intelligences, Observations, Decrees, Orders, Lies, Libels, Diurnals,
Execrations, Resolves, Proofs, Disproofes, Extravagancies, Delinquencies,
Cases, Causes, Clauses, Articles, (all this while they touched not any Book or
Paper that concerned the King, or wherein any thing was expressed either for His
Majesty's Service or Honor) Then afresh they fall to it again, gnawing and
knabbling, Briefes, Breviates, Approbations, Amplifications, Transcriptions,
Massacres, Petitions, Repetitions, Declamations, Supplications, Reservations,
Degradations, Iustifications, Manifestations, Declarations, Molestations,
Condemnations, Advertisements, Remembrances, Pamphlets, Sermons, Seditions,
Fights, Battles, Skirmishes, Suspicions, Submissions, Triumphs, Firings,
Plunderings, Advices, Intelligences, News, Expositions, Propositions,
Impositions, Transpositions, Acquisitions, Depositions, Suppositions,
Compositions, Inquisitions, Commissions, and the Devil and all; some Books
also of Irish Rebellion were devoured as they had been Shamroys. Amongst which
these remarkable Passages, there was one invective railing Pamphlet (written by
a namelesse Author) against Crosses, and any Signs, Figures, or Remembrances
of any manner of Cross whatsoever; upon which crosselesse, untoward,
overthwart Book the Mice fell in such curious manner that they gnawed it some
four inches down the back, and as much on the foldings of the head, just into
the perfect form of a Cross, almost as even as if it had been cut with a
knife, which is a prediction that the very Vermin will rise against these
villainous scandalous Pamphlet-mongers, and knabble their damnable Inventions,
some all to tatters, and some into the forms and fashions of such laudable
Figures, which they have railed against. These were the varieties of Dainties
that were spoiled, devoured, sacked and ruinated at this banqueting Battle;
amongst which Viands three of Master Pym's Speeches were mistaken by the Mice
to be kissing Comfits, Marmalad, and Suckets, (for in sent and taste they were
as sweet as Sugar Carrion) but though they were delicious in the palate, it was
found (by woeful experience, that no Rats-bane could be more poisonous, nor any
venom more banefull in operation, which is an emblem that though Mice are
common pilfering Thieves, and do maintain their straggling Commonwealth only
by stealing, yet when they grow so audaciously impudent that they dare to feed
upon Treason (though it have a pleasant smacke) yet it choked them, and proved
their bane, for many of them died, and it is certain most of them are
destinated or bewitched like Traitors to be caught in a Trap, or fall into the
claws of the Cat, as Conspiratours, and wicked treacherous Rebels will drop
into the Hangmans budget: but the Day begins to dawn, therefore I Will give over
till soon at Night: yet one thing more which was almost forgotten, there were
two of Tailors Books in the bundle which the Mice touched not, the one was
entitled New Preachers, New, and the other was a sweet well favored Sermon
upon Tobias and his Dog.

Sunday Night.
THis Night was very zealously consumed by the Brethren and holy Sisters, till
between twelve and one of the clock: amongst the Flock there was a devout
Gentlewoman (one Mistress Fumpkins a Porters Wife in Pudding Lane) who made a
short Repetition of almost four hours, upon Master Woodcockes Lecture the
New-English Teacher at Laurence Church, at Laurence Lane end near Guild Hall,
quasi All guile, where true Lie, very Lie, she did exceeding Lie, lay open Lie,
how zealous Lie, fervent Lie, ardent Lie, and persuasive Lie, he had encouraged
his Auditors, vehement Lie, to continue constant Lie, obstinate Lie,
rebellious Lie, she said the Gentleman did sweat out most delicate Doctrine,
and that he labored like a Thrasher, and belabored the Pulpit and Cushion
extreme Lie, telling them that if they had not given Money or Plate toward the
Cause, or labored with the Shovell, Spade, or Barrow, for the raising of the
Defensive (most Offensive) Works and Fortifications to keep out the Army of
Protestants, Malignants, and Cavaliers, if they had done neither of these good
Actions, they were not in the state of Grace* or if they had not or would not
hazard their Estates and Lives, to oppose, cast down, destroy, extirpe, and
depose all kingly Government, all Church Order, and decency, all Laws and
Authority, all obedience and loyalty, all Christianity, humanity, and
civil society, that if they had not put any, or all of these virtues in
practice there was small hope of any goodness in them, or any happiness to
befall them.

When this good woman had finished her godly Repetition, there was wine in
bottles, and cheer in bowls brought in, which the whole Assembly fell upon
religiously, consuming all in the way of Edification.

The rest of the Night was spent with great diligence and study, in devising
who and where to break open and rifle the Houses of such as are doomed or
condemned as Malignants, the purchase so gotten (whether it be Money or Goods
to be sold) the High and Mighty, Magnificent Quartermain, the great
Plunder-master General. His Fee is three pence in the pound, for all the
pillage so lawfully taken, and it was affirmed, that at that rate his Vailes
amounted to fifteen pounds in one day. Thus has he raised his Trades from one
degree to another, from a Brewers Clerk to a Preacher in a Mault-floore, and
from a preacher to a most valiant Brownisticano, Plunderissimo, Generalissimo.

Monday Night.
ON Monday Night, about six of the clock in the morning, the Sun being two
hours high, there were Letters (with some words in 'em) directed from a trusty
hand in Oxford to one Cut-beard a Barber in scalding Alley, one of which
Letters contained briefly that the Cavaliers are in mighty distress, and the
Colleges in much want: but you must understand withal, that they want neither
meat, manners, Ammunition, or courage; and yet their case is lamentable, for
since the taking of the saucy Town of Teuxbury by the Parliament Forces,
Mustard has been at a greater price than Biefe at Oxford; also their misery
is to be pitied (if they were not Malignants, Delinquents, and true Subjects
to the King) for if there chance to come into the Market three hundred or more
of Salmonds in a day, besides other fish and flesh in abundance, yet their poor
and wretched estate is such, that it would grieve any tender heart to see what
shifts they are fain to make to get vinegar so that it is manifest that our
happiness does exceed the Malignant party in all places, for we have a great
deal more sauce than meat, and more meat by half than manners.

This Night it was Ordered, that no Butter-women should come to the City with
any Butter marked, printed, or molded with any forms of Crosses, upon pain
that all the said Crosses should be demolished and melted, for the use of
Cooks and Schul-boyes, and such like contemptible destructions; for it was
wisely taken into consideration that such Crosses were as dangerous and
papisticall, as the Cross in Cheapside, or the Crosses upon the ends of Saint
Paul his Church, or any other Crosses whatsoever, they being by the judgments
of the wise and opinions of the Godly held to be marks of the Beast, Roman
badges, superstitious, Antichristian, idolatrous and abominable, only such
Crosses are allowed and beloved as are upon any manner of money, whether it be
Papist or Protestant Princes Coin, the matter is indifferent.

It is to be conjectured, that all the Cross ways in England must be made
round, and that no Tailer shall dare to sit Crosse-legged upon pain of being
plundered, for sitting superstitiously, and his Hell raked and ransacked of all
his true and lawfully begotten Relics and Remnants.

Tuesday Night.
THis Night three hundred Dragooners brought two old seditious and wicked
Ministers out of Gloucestershire; It is said they durst not only presume to
pray for the King openly, but also with all vehemency exhorted the people to
obey, love and honor Him, according to the rules and commands of Gods Word and
the Laws of the Land; they were likewise taxed and accused for most wicked
seducers of their Auditors to sue and seek for peace, and to be constant in
the protestant Religion; and further, they denied to give any money to raise or
maintain War against His Majesty and the Orthodox Doctrine established: also
it was proved against them, that they persuade many others to the like loyalty
and obedience: one of them was so bold as to preach against Rebellion, and
cited some Authors for what he said, he quoted Casaubon, and Casaubon quoted
Suetonius, that it was recorded that Brutus, Cassius, Cymba, Cas^a, and the
rest of the Conspiratours against Caesar did all kill themselves with their own
weapons which they wounded Caesar withal: upon this he made application to
these Times, and persuaded the people to take heed, and never to dare to lift
up their hands against their Sovereign, for fear of the like or worse
judgment to fall upon them. For which rebellious and distasteful kind of
Teaching they were committed to several prisons, there to lodge amongst their
Fellows, whilst their Cattle must be seized, their Benefices suspended; it is
much hoped that Master Green the Feltmaker near Bridewell, or Gunne the
preaching Cooper hard by the Bear-garden, or Carbrain the Anabaptist Dier on
the back side, shall have their places: their Families turned out of doors,
their Houses rifled and ransacked, and their Goods carried to Plunderers Hall,
there to be sold for the supportation and furthering of the good Cause, and
themselves (for examples and terror of others to remain in Jail till such
times as they have learned better manners.

It was also Voted this Night, that no man or woman should be capable to
receive, have, hold, or keep, either goods, lands, meat, drink, apparel, or
any manner of necessaries whatsoever, except the said parties shall have the
gaining and possessions of the said necessaries, either by the means of
credit, ready money, love, or by the new made true and lawful way of stealing
and plundering.

Moreover the said Tuesday Night the Garrison at Wallingford (being all
Carosists, Royalists, and Cavaliers, are in such distress that Radishes and
Onions are exceeding scarce, and (to their further grief) Oranges and Limmons
are dearer to them than to us, so that all manner of meats are like to be in
good request amongst them, their best and only sawces are stomach, pepper and
salt.

Also this Night was brought from Brainsford to Queenhithe that the Malignant
party did oppose his Excellency, and that they would show themselves the
Benignant party, for the service of God, their King, Country, and the
Protestant Religion, and that we the true Anabaptisticall, Brownisticall, and
zealous Reformers shall be as opposite to the Truth as the Truth is to us,
which was Voted. Also this Night, there were papers found with some scriblings
written by no body, wherein our London new Bulworkes, Rampires, Trenches and
Works were abused with nicknames, as they called our Fortifications but
Twentyfications, and our Bul-workes, Cow-workes, because the women made them,
but they said, the men were only for the Ram-peire. It was also Voted that (by
reason of Fears and Jealousies that the Cavaliers would come and plunder the
City) in policy the people should be all plundered by the Parliament Forces,
so that if the Cavaliers do chance to come, they shall find nothing to take
away, for we have a purpose to consume all by this kind of stratagem of
robbing one another.

Wednesday Night.
THis Night there were Pamphlets scattered, one of them was concerning Squares
and Rounds, the Author of Square-dealing was one Homo Quadratus, the other was
Non Angulus Rotundus, wherein some worthy Citizens of Oxford were both taxed
and vindicated, namely, T. Gol. Jack of all Trades, W. G. a diligent zealous
brother in warning and meeting at holy Conventicles, with many others
meritorious brethren and sisters, who have forsaken Oxford, and their King,
Religion, and Allegiance, who now suffer worthily for their holy Rebellion, as
the Book of Homo Quadratus, does most abusively and truly deliver and lay open.

Also there came from the Press A New Learned Weak Description of Weekly
News; it was so acute that it did cut and curry the Cavaliers, in such
fearful fashion, that a deaf man would rejoice to hear it, this Volume of one
sheet was called Mercurius Civicus, the Author never wrote before that time,
and died in his first Week of his Travels; it is said by the Malignants, that
he was most unfortunately choked with seventeen neat and palpable Lies, which
he had carefully invented, and incerted in the said Book for the credit of our
Army, he is worse than dead, for his reputation is buried with this Epitaph,
Here Mercurius Civicus lies in his throat; for we are resolved to believe any
thing that makes for the advancing of our Cause, and likewise we suppress and
politiquely give no credit to such News or Losses as do make against us; in
brief, we have lost a profitable Member by the death of this painful Author,
but hang him, it is reported, that he is alive again, or the Devil in his
likeness; however, it is to be conjectured, that he that was so nimble to
abuse and tell the Malignant partieso roundly in one week, no doubt but if he
had lived longer he would have banged them back and side, beyond all belief
and credit.

It it (almost) certain, that Bruno Combertus the High and Mighty Emperor of
Aethiopia, and Quoba Cond^na Pheodorwich the puissant King of the large
Territories of the invincible and invisible Utopia, it is said, that they are
both in our Narrow Seas with a thousand ships, galleys, sloopes, and other
Vessels for the War, they have brought two thousand Tons of Gold, Silver,
precious stones, and some Hangings, they are come to aid us against the Rebels
that obey the King, they have brought five thousand Pieces of wooden Ordnance,
powder more than can be counted, or to be spoken of, and shot beyond reckoning,
with all other necessaries for War or Peace, they were feasted bravely aboard
our Admiral; and they will be ready to give Battle at Brumingham, as soon as
ever the waters are high enough to bring the ships thither.

News came this Night, that the Author of a seditious Pamphlet was taken at
Lewis in Sussex, It was a Book wherein was declared the goodness and
happiness of the King, that (beyond all example or record) in 15 years Reign
had not any Nobleman, Gentleman, or any Subject that arose against him in any
way of opposition or Rebellion, so that the Sword of Justice had no occasion to
be drawn to cut of Treason (a blessing unparalled in this Kingdom or any
other for so long time) till now; and the Book said further, that when Augustus
Caesar reigned, our Savior was borne, and that the Emperor was Monarch of all
the discovered Kingdoms of the World, and that Peace was then over the face of
the whole Earth, which whole Earth Augustus commanded to be taxed, Luke 2.1.
Shortly after there was raised a Rebellion in Spain, (by an Army of Thieves)
under the command of one Crocotus (a mad, hare-brain'd, desperate, ambitious
fellow) This Crocotus with his crew troubled Caesar, and committed many
outrages upon peaceable people; and to suppress the Rebellion the Emperor
caused Proclamations to be set forth, that whosoever could vanquish the Rebels,
or take their General Crocotus and bring him alive or dead, should have twenty
five thousand Crowns for his service, and pardon withal for any former faults
committed: as soon as Crocotus heard of this Proclamation, he began to fear
that some of his own Soldiers would cut his throat, or surprise and deliver
him to Caesar, for so great a reward as was proclaimed; upon which
consideration, he wisely disguised himself, ran away from his Army, and fell
at Caesar's feet, claiming the benefit of the Proclamation, for he had brought
Crocotus alive, and so revealed himself, and was received into grace and
favor, mending his manners contrary to all expectation.

The application of this story was, that it was desired that every offender
would imitate Crocotus.

Thursday Night.
THis Night much Time was spent in drink, smoke, and talk, at the Sign of
the Man in the Moon without Dowgate; where after some half a score rouses,
every one began to talk of that which they had nothing to do withal, amongst
the rest one ignorant fellow was bold to ask what manner of thing the Public
Faith is, and what the reason is that it is laid to pawn for Money every where,
but (that which made him most wonder was) wherefore any one man would be so mad
as to adventure to lend any thing upon it, (except upon especial good and
lawful grounded Reasons) therefore he desired to be satisfied ^^wne^, his
kind of Public Faith is, and how far (...) power (...) it may extend. To
which most saucy and treacherous (...) lea^ed and worthy Welwisher to the
Lowest Uppermost House replied, as follows:

My small Friend (quoth he) I will tell thee briefly what this new Public
Faith is, it is called Public because it is common to all, and has
community in all, and to take away, waste, and consume all; it is General,
Catholic, and Universal, not peculiar to any man, particular not private to
any person, there is no man has any propriety in it, more than he has in his
goods and lands (as at this time the case is) so that it is neither Thine nor
Mine, but every man's; it has absolute power to borrow money, and to force
unbelieving people to be exceeding desperate Creditours; and whosoever is so
wickedly minded as to presume to deny or delay what the Public Faith demands,
such refractory persons must be robbed (of all they have sometimes) some have
been so bold as to call it plundering, but instead of the word stealing, there
is a pretty nickname given to it, called Seasing; for this strange Faith has
that invisibilitie in it, not only to tolerate Thiefts and Rapines, but to
allow Burglaries, Fellonies, Murders, Rebellions, (and some parcels of
Treasons) to be no breach of Laws, and to lay all unruly persons in prison as
will not be contented quietly (without grumbling) to be rifled and undone. It
has likewise power (with the fame extorted or stolen goods or moneys taken) to
raise War* to transform Colliers into Captains, Broken Merchants to
Colonells, trade fallen Tapsters into Tyrannical Rodomontadoes, and these
brave Man-divells shall be the Leaders of such Troops of unresistable,
unconquerable Mirmidones that shall enforce all men to the obedience of the
Public faith.

This Faith, is neither Protestant, Lutheran, Calvinist, Papist, or any kind
of Christian Faith, The Turk has no faith to follow it, or the Moors to
follow it, it is a faith that is full of works, (whereby it is notoriously
meritorius) and commonly it does no harm to bad men (for it leaves them to the
judgment of another world) it only by afflictions tries the virtuous strength
of their patience, as do desire peace, and to be obedient to their Sovereigne,
and would willingly live quietly in such manner as God and the Laws of this
Kingdom (grounded and derived on and from Gods Word) has established for the
government and tranquillity both of Church and State, such men as these, and
none else but such as these are oppressed, rifled, ransacked, imprisoned,
masacred, and beggered by the mighty means of the Public Faith: for it all
the Goales in England were searched (I mean such Goales as are under the high
and mighty command of the Public Faith) all those that lie in those Gaoles
are laid there by that Faiths command for no other faults, but for being true
Protestants and loyal Subjects to their Sovereign, on the contrary there is
not any Anabaptist, Brownist, Schismaticke, Seperatist, or Rebel in any
trouble or prison under the command of the Public Faith.

And whereas (of it self) it has not power, except by direction of legal
Statutes and Ordinances, joined (and protected) by regal power and Authorietie,
yet it assumes, (or presumes to take to it self, and make of it self what
Power it list, either regal or legal, what shall most advance the self will of
it self: it is so potent, as it can maintain it self in magnificent pomp, by
forcible borrowing, and withal it is so just as to pay double (with empty
promises) it can turn Orthodox prayer and preaching into pedlary prating, also
Libels, Lyurnals, and scandalous railing Pamphlets are not only tolerated by
the Public Faith, but all and (worse than all this) has been countenanced
and encouraged by exalting the insulting swarm of mechanicke or trencher
Pulpiteers, that what betwixt the medley of their seditious gallimaufrey
hotchpotch doctrine, and the mere froathie inventions compiled and dispersed in
great Volumes for pence a piece; it is most certain, that God has not escaped
blasphemy, or the King calumny, the people unspeakable misery, the estate
obloquie, and the whole Kingdom infamy, to the most contemptible scorn of
all Nations. The Public Faith can frame and devise Navies of ships, Armies
of men and ammunition, and Letters and Messages from the Kings of Denmark,
France, and Spain, (of which Letters those Kings never knew, and those Ships,
Armies, and Arms are invisible, or like Castles in the air) this Faith can
also invent supposed Battles, Fights, and triumphant Victories, where never
stroke was struck or blow given, and it can command Bells to be rung, Bonefires
to be inflamed, and public Thankesgiving in Churches, and proclaim it self
victorious, when it is most miserably and bravely beaten, and that it killed
seven hundred with the loss of two men and one boy, and half a Horse, whereby
the credulous seduced people have their giddy brains tossed to and fro, from
Jealousies to Fears, from Fears to Hopes, and from Hopes to lend and give
Money as if they were mad, and in so laying out their Money, they deservedly
purchase their misery.

Moreover, this Faith cannot be persuaded by any means to endure or abide a
King, especially if he be a good one, or will not be such an one as this Faith
would make him, but if he do but claim his right, or stand upon lawful terms
for his Royal and just Privilege and Prerogative; if he be so unruly, that he
will not be ruled by this Public Faith, he must then be robbed and plundered
of all that ever he has, or at least of as much as this Faith can lay hold on,
for it has power with the Kings Ammunition, Arms, Ships, Money, Revenue,
Towns, Houses, Castles, or any thing that is the Kings, in the Kings name to
shoot bullets against the King, and fight against the King, for the
preservation and service of the King. Thus the Public Faith has surpassed
Pharaoh's Magicians in Legerdemain, it has trasform'd our Land into the Isle
of Guls temporally, and old England into New England spiritually. It has made
men's wealths and allegiance, crimes and causes, of their loss of estates and
lives; it has put down all Spiritual Courts, so that there is no punishment
for the sweet sin of Lechery, whereby Fornication, Adultery, Bigamie,
Poligamie, and Incest with brazen uncontrolled fronts, make whores, knaves,
cuckolds, bawdes, bastards, thieves, and beggars by the hundreds, so that if
this world lasts and this geer go forward, we shall have Plato's Commonwealth
here, and concerning our wives, we shall all turn to be Nicholaitans; by which
brave unbridled Liberty, Hey down derry Downing, Room for an Hackney
Presbyterean, that whilst his wife lay sick, got the Nurse and the
Maidservant both with child, but some satisfaction was made, for the Wife
died, he married the Nurse, concerning the other plumpe Girl, some course was
taken, but all is one for that, the Parish is big enough to keep both the Cow
and the Calfe. Thus can the Public Faith tax a reverend Clergy with
corrupted Simonie, and yet it self can make money of all things, it can turn
Obedience into Rebellion, and Loyalty into Treason, it can molest a good King,
disturb and ruinate Kingdoms, and in conclusion to wear it self so
threadbare, that all the Cloath-workers in England will never be able to set a
new nap upon it.

Thus have I declared the almighty and omnipotent sway of the Public Faith,
yet I have not related any things concerning particulars, but only touched at
the general Heads of the potencie, power, actions, force, and virtues of it,
the Day breaks, and our Author writes nothing but Nightworkes (or Deeds of
Darkness) so, Good morrow my Masters.

Friday Night.
THis Night lamentable News was brought that Prince Ruperts Troops did most
unmercifully plunder a poor old woman within four miles of South-East Wickham,
the case was pitiful as it was related, that the woman kept a blind, smoakie,
dry Alehouse, near the Highway, and that two Tinkers had been there and
drank all her Ale the day before the Army marched that way, but the next day
the Soldiers being on their march demanding drink for their money, the old
woman told them, that she had none left, but the Soldiers being offended, in a
revenging manner, entered her house, and plundered it of all the water which
she had provided to brew withal, but took nothing at all from her besides, but
the poor distressed Ale-wife cried out, and wrung her hands, saying, she was
undone, she was undone, utterly undone, at which instant the Prince coming by,
and hearing the deplorable noise of the woman, demanded what was the cause that
made her cry out so extremely, she answered, that the Soldiers had been the
breaking of her, by depriving her of the benefit of two Trades at once,
videlicet, a Brewer and an Ale-wife, by drinking up all her water, whereupon
his Highness threw her an Angel, and rode away laughing at her misery: some
say that Boy the Dog of War wagged his tail merrily in a jeering manner at the
woman's calamity; and this was the most extraordinary outrage that the Prince
or his Army committed at that or any other time, for the Malignants say it is
no robbery to plunder Rebels.

But now be amazed, astonished, and possessed with wonder and admiration, and if
ever we had cause to be beside our selves, out of our wits, or stark mad with
joy, now is the time; there was this Night brought to light the most horrible,
terrible, detestable, cruel Plot that ever was contrived since the days of
Achitophel, the Sicilian Even-song comes short of it, the Massacre of Paris
comes not near it, the Spanish intended Invasion was a toy to it, and the
Powder Plot was but a blast or puff in comparison of it; but I hold my Reader
too long before I come to the unpurposed purpose, or marrow of the matter,
which was as follows:

This Night our watchful Sentinels, closely and carefully examined all that
came near them, and if any were so saucy as to say they were for God and the
King, there was a a strict Order for them, for being dangerous persons to the
State, about nine of the clock, or two hours before or behind: a tall fellow
disguised, with a water tankard on his shoulder, stopped with a clout, as the
manner is, which he had filled at the Conduit, as he said, falsely, for it was
proved afterward to be wilde-fire-water, this audatious Herostratus knowing
where a Soldier stood with his Musket, which Soldier had a pound of Powder in
a paper loose in his pocket, which the Villain having notice of, he suddenly
stepped to him, and plucked out the stopple of his Tankard, whereat the water
gushed forth with such violence that it fired the Powder, and blew the Soldier
from the Standard in Cheap over the houses into Milkestreet, as far as Saint
What do you call hims Church, where the learned Master Case teaches, the wicked
wretch was taken with his watery Engine, and upon examination he confessed, that
he and seventy nine more of his fellows were hired by the Malignant party to
fire the City in eleven score and twelve places with this newfound stratagem
of Water-tankards, for the which Plot the Traitor was committed to Waltham
house near Bedlam, and it is thought that public Thankesgiving must be given
for this great Deliverance.

This Night also there came News of two strange disasters which happened at
Saint Albans, the the one was of one John Robotham Esquire, whom the Malignants
do call Justice Ignorance, this worthy Squire to express his Loyalty did
oppress all such as any way did love or honor the King, for which purpose his
Clerk and himself did drive a great Trade in buying and selling of
Mittimusses, Warrans, Bindings over, Withdrawings of Recognisance, Commitments,
Releasings, Fees, Plunderings, and gentle Rewards, by which means he got a
wicked deal of money; this mighty bottomless Justice Robotham did for the
service of His Majesty take away all the Arms and Ammunition that any of His
Majesty's Friends had, and with the same Armor and Arms so plundered, he
armed the Rebels, and yet all that was done by him was done for the Kings
service; amongst the rest of the Arms he had an headpiece of his own which he
took great pride in, for it was light, bright, white, and (at the least
Elder-gun proof) it was his great Grandfathers Morion (a Murrein on it) at the
siege of Southampton in Cumberland, indeed there was a privy search made for
it, (for the very house of office was examined) but no finding could be found,
and because there were so many Wenches with child in the Town, [Mistris
Justice] Master Justice Ignorant's Wife protested by her Halliday and Womanhood
that she had rather have lost his Cod-piece than his Headpiece.

Also there was one Thomas Sadler who had formerly been a fractur'd
Linnen-Draper, retired to a Country conversation, his Lawn transformed into
Land, his Holand metamorphosed into Zeal-And himself quite devoured by
invisible uncharitable Devotion; to express the ardencie, fervencie,
vehemency, and furiositie of his love to the observation of Church Orders,
upon a Fast Day he went into his Barn where he congregated his own people and
some others, there being a great Bucking-tub brought into the Barn, the said
Tub having two holes which a cole-staffe was to be put through upon occasion,
through which holes a rope was fastened, and Master Sadler being in the Tub,
the rope was cast over a beam, wherewith he commanded himself to be hoised
up, that he might make his preachment, where after nine Psalms, and a
stretched out five quarters prayer, he began and proceeded with singular and
single Doctrine to persuade his Audience to be loyal in Rebellion, and
obedient in opposing all Law and Order, which Godless instructions the
Assembly did not only give large ears unto, but also edified beyond measure
thereby; at last he being suddenly inspired and transported with a fiery
Enthumiasmicall rapture, he began to denounce destruction and confusion against
the Cavaliers, and with his violent expressions, and agilitie of action, in
stamping the word Damnation hard under his foot, he thumped out the bottom of
his hanging Pulpit, (whereby his foundation was as bottomless as Hell, of his
Doctrine) and withal fell down in the threshing floor, where he lay a good
while in a tranuce; some say he was bruised, but the wisest of his Audience do
believe that he was in private contemplation with the Spirit. And thus upon the
Fast Day was this admirable piece of fast and loose.

It was much disputed in the House what the true meaning of the word Malignant
is (that is so often repeated in Print, and Pulpit) one said, it was derived
from two Latin words, Male lignum, an evil wood, a crooked, knottie, sappie,
unserviceable timber, good only to make Gallouses.
