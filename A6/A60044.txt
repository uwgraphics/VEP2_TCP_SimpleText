A Short CATECHISM.
Quest. WHAT is man?

Answ. A reasonable creature.

Q. What mean you when you say you are reasonable?

A. I mean I am above a beast, and have something within me whereby I know what
I do, and why.

Q. That I may see how your knowledge leads to practice: tell me, what learn
you from your being reasonable?

A. That I never do any thing of which I cannot give a good account to my self
and others.

Q. You said you was a creature, what mean you by that?

Q. What learn you hence?

A. That I must constantly live in dependence on him that made me.

Q. Who made you?

spiritual, and therein above my self, most Psalm. 103.8.
gracious, 1 Pet. 1.5, 16.
holy, Romans 16.27. Romans 11.33.
wise, Job 40.9, etc.
powerful, infinite in all perfections, and therein above all spirits.

Q. You say God is a Being wholly spiritual, what mean you by it?

A. I mean he is a Being that has no flesh and bones as I have, Ier. 32.18,
19. Job. 11.7.
and cannot be perceived by any of my senses, nor can I make any thing like him.

Q. You have acknowledged a God, and told me he is a Spirit, what learn you
hence?

A. That I am bound to worship him, Ioh. 4.23, 24.
and to worship him in spirit.

6. Psalm. 39.7.


Q. You said God was holy, what mean you by it?

and can neither love nor approve it in any other.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. Never to imagine his grace will countenance me in sin. Exodus 34.6, 7.


Q. You said God was wise, what mean you by it?

A. That he has Jer. 32.19. Prove. 15.3.
knowledge of all things, and Prove. 8.14, 15, 16.
ability to do all things according to it.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. To do all Heb. 4.13.
as in his sight, and begging direction of him to rest Psalm. 37.5, 6, 7.
satisfied in his disposal.

Q. You said God was powerful, what mean you by it?

A. That he is Genesis 5.11.
almighty, and can do all things, that Job 34.12. Tit 1.2.
agree with his wisdom and holiness.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. To fear him Mat. 10.28.
above all creatures, being 2 King. 7.1, 2.
confident, that what he has promised or threatened, Ephesians. 3.20.
shall be fulfilled, though it seem impossible to flesh and blood.

Q. You added God was infinite in all perfections, what does that teach you?

A. Never to admit any low or unworthy thoughts of God; Job 26.14. Romans 11.33.
and when I have the highest, then to remember I know him best, when I admire
him most.

Q. You have told me you was made, and that God was your maker, for what end
did he make you?

A. That by Eccl. 12.13.
faithful service to him, I might Mat. 5.8.
be happy in the enjoyment of him.

Q. What learn you hence?

and never to seek happiness in worldly pleasures, and profits, or any thing
below him.

A. According to his will revealed in the Scriptures, 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17.
wherein all things are contained, which I am to believe and practice.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. Diligently to read and search them. 1 Timothy 4.13 Joh. 5.39.


Q. What does the Scripture teach you concerning man, which you have not yet
told me?

A. The Scriptures give the History of the creation of the world out of
nothing, and of Adam the first man.

Q. How was Adam the first man created?

A. The Scripture says, God made him in his own Genesis 1.26. Genesis 5.1.
Image, that he was Eccl. 7.27.
upright, and set as Lord Genesis 1.26.
over his Works.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. To admire Gods goodness in making the world and man in it, in such an
excellent estate, Psalm. 104. The whole Psalm. Psalm. 8.3, 4, 5, 6.
since nothing made by him, could bring any profit to him.

Q. Did Adam always continue in the state God made him?

A. No: he disobeyed Gods command in eating forbidden fruit, Genesis 3.
and so fell from it.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. Never to charge God with man's sin, Jam. 1.13, 14.
but condemn him whose behavior was unworthy to God, and cruel to himself.

Q. What was the state into which he fell?

A. A state of sin and misery. Genesis 3. Romans 5.12. Jam. 1.14, 15.


Q. What is the state in which you are?

A. Mine, and every man's is the same, for we all find in our selves lust
conceiving and bringing forth sin, and sin finished, brings forth death.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. To bewail my sad and lamentable condition from which I am not able to
deliver my self. Romans 7.24.


Q. O wretched creature that thou art, Who can or will deliver thee?

A. I thank God through Jesus Christ whom he has provided to be a Savior.
Romans 7.25.


Q. Who is this Jesus Christ the Savior?

A. God and man, Joh. 1.14. 1 Timothy 3.16.
or God manifested in the flesh.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. To be much encouraged, Heb. 2.16, 17, 18. Heb. 4.14, 15, 16.
notwithstanding my sad condition, since my Savior being both God and man is
able and willing to help me.

Q. What did Christ do for you.

A. He lived a holy Heb. 4.15.
yet an afflicted life, and 1 Pet. 3.18.
dyed for our sins upon the Cross, Mat. 28.6. Romans 4.15.
rose out of the grave, Act. 1.9. Ephesians. 4.8.
ascended into heaven, where he now sits to make intercession. Heb. 7.25.


Q. What learn you hence?

A. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.
Cheerfully to obey him, and willingly to part with every thing for him, who
parted with life for me, and is still mindful of me.

Q. What good do you hope for from this Savior?

A. A Romans 8.32. Phil. 4.19.
supply of all my wants; especially Act. 5.31. Tit. 3.5, 6.
forgiveness of my sins, Tit. 3.7.
sanctification, and everlasting Heb. 5.9.
salvation.

Q. What learn you hence?

A. In no case to entertain any despairing thoughts.

Q. How must you address your self to God, for the obtaining the mercies you
hope for by Christ?

A. Jam. 4.8, 9, 10. Isa. 1.15, 16, 17, 18. Act. 8.22.
First, with a deep sense of my unworthiness, unfeignedly repenting that ever I
sinned against him, Heb. 10.20, 21, 22.
(2) With a real sense of his undeserved goodness, humbly by faith in Christ
expecting from his free grace. Isa. 55.6, 7. Act. 9.6.
(3) Heartily resolving to walk before him in newness of life all my days.

Q. By your answer, you may perceive an absolute necessity of repentance,
faith, and newness of life; first, what is repentance?

A. Such a sorrow for sin, that works hatred and forsaking of it. 2 Cor. 7.10,
11. Heb. 6.1.


Q. What is faith in Christ?

A. A hearty persuasion that he is the Joh. 6.69. Chap. 11.27.
Savior, that Mark. 1.15. Acts 15.7.
what he has said, and what is said of him in the Gospel, is true; so as to
Heb. 11.8.
obey his commands, v. 7.
fear his threatenings, v. 13. Romans 4.18, 19, 20, 21.
trust him for the performances of all his promises.

Q. What is newness of life?

A. It consists in denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and living soberly,
righteously and godlily.

Q. When may you be said to live soberly?

A. When in all things I live temperately and chastely, Romans 13.13. 1 These. 5.7,
8. Tit. 3.2.
moderating all unruly passion.

Q. When may you be said to live righteously?

A. When in all my dealings I do as I would be done by. Mat. 7.12.


Q. When may you be said to live godlily?

A. When in my whole conversation I behave my self toward God, as my Psalm.
100.1, 2.
Creator and my 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.17, 18.
Redeemer.

Q. I hope you intend to practice all this, but are you able of your self?

A. No, I am not of my self sufficient, so much as to think one good thought. 2
Cor. 3.5.


Q. What must enable you?

A. Gods blessed Spirit which he has promised. Luke 11.13. Ephesians. 3.16.


Q. You say the spirit must enable you, are you then idly to lie still and do
nothing?

A. No, Phil. 2.12, 13.
I am therefore to work out my salvation with fear and trembling, because God
works in me to will and to do of his good pleasure.

Q. If you must not be idle what means must you use?

A. 1 Timothy 4.13.15, 16. Romans 10.17.
First, reading, hearing, meditating of the Word (which is the power of God to
salvation) Luke 11.13.
(2) Prayer Psalm. 119.59. Act. 16.25, etc.
(3) serious consideration of my actions, and of all Gods providence to my
self and others Mat. 16.16. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.
(4) Use of the sacraments, Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Q. I less suspect your knowledge in the rest, what is Baptism?

A. Washing with water in the Name of the Father, Mat. 28.19.
Son, and Holy Ghost.

Q. Of what use may your Baptism be to you, since you was Baptized in your
infancy?

A. The consideration of it provokes to newness of life, Act. 22.16. Romans 6.4.
(1) Because outward washing signifies purity. 1 Cor. 1.13, 15. 1 Cor. 10.2.
(2) Because my being baptized in Christ's Name, engages me to own his Doctrine,
and keep his Laws, Gal. 3.27.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. It Is according to Christ's institution, bread broken and eaten, wine. powered
forth and drunk, Mat. 26.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.
in remembrance of Christ, whose body was broken for us, and blood shed for the
remission of sin.

Q. How is this useful to provoke you to newness of life?

A. While the evil of sin, and the love of Christ crucified is herein set
before my eyes, I am constrained to live to him who dyed for me.

Q. I pray God whenever you receive this Sacrament, you may. But do all
receive this benefit?

A. No, 1 Cor. 11.21, etc.
they cannot who understand not the ends of Christ's death, nor they who desire
not to enjoy them.

Q. What if you neglect these means and quench the spirit?

A. I show that I undervalue all that Christ has done and suffered, John 3.18,
19. Heb. 2.3. Chap. 10.29. Chap. 12.25.
and provoke God to bring on me a greater measure of his wrath, for this my
contempt, than if I had never heard of a Savior.

Q. Do you believe God will bring this wrath on you, if you thus behave your
self?

A. Yes, Acts 17.31. 2 Cor. 5.10.
I believe God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
righteousness, and render to every man according to what he has done in the
flesh, whether it be good or bad.

Q. What shall be the condition of all men after the day of Judgment?

A. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, Romans 2.7, 8, 9. Mat.
25.31. etc.
seek for glory God will give eternal life, but to them that obey not the
truth, and live in unrighteousness, tribulation, and anguish, indignation and
wrath, the portion of every soul that does evil.

Q. Seeing we profess to believe these things, what manner of persons ought we
to be?

A. We ought to live in all holy conversation and godliness, 2 Pet. 3.11, 14.18.
being diligent that we may be found of God in peace, without spot, and
blameless; growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Ghrist: to whom be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

THE CREED.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth. And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified dead and buried,
he descended into Hell. The third day he arose from the dead. He ascended into
Heaven, and sits on at the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of
sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

The LORDS PRAYER.
OUR Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy
will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven, Give us this day our daily bread, And
forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil: for thine is the Kingdom, and the power,
and the glory for ever. Amen.

The X. COMMANDMENTS.
GOD spoke all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which has brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

1 Thou shall have no other gods before me. 2 Thou shall not make unto thee any
graven image, or any likeness of any thing, that is in heaven above, or that is
in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shall not
bow down thy self to them, nor serve them: For I the LORD thy God am a Jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the children, unto the third and
fourth generation of them that hate me: and showing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me and keep my Commandments. 3 Thou shall not take the name of
the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless, that takes
his name in vain. 4 Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: Six days shall
thou labor, and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
LORD thy God, in it thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. 5 Honor thy father and thy
mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God gives
thee. 6 Thou shall not kill. 7 Thou shall not commit adultery. 8 Thou shall not
steal. 9 Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 10 Thou shall
not cover thy neighbors house, thou shall not cover thy neighbors wise, nor
his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing
that is thy neighbors.
FINIS.
