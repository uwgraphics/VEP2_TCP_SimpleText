TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS ASSEMBLED In the High Court of
PARLIAMENT: An humble Representation of the pressing grievances, and important
desires of the well-affected Freemen, and Covenant-engaged Citizens, of the
City of London.
OUt of our zeal to Gods glory, so exceedingly profaned; our love to Gods
truth, so woefully corrupted; our compassionate affection to our Brethren
oppressed; the grievous calamities that lie upon our selves, and are still more
and more growing upon us; together with the sad fears which do daily possess
and afflict our hearts, because of Divine vengeance and displeasure so
imminently impending over our heads, and even ready to seize upon Church and
State, We have been forced yet once again in the discharge of our
Consciences, to take the humble boldness to pour forth into your bosoms the
sorrows of our hearts, and to present unto your Honors the conceived causes of
our Miseries; trusting, that in your grave wisdoms you will both see into
them, and in your Justice give remedy against them: For who can see Religion,
Laws, Liberties, (things of so great and precious concernment) not only
assaulted, but even overwhelmed, and the Unity, Peace, and Prosperity of the
Kingdoms violated, and almost destroyed, and by a treacherous and cowardly
silence continue to hold his peace? We cannot, we dare not, the oath of God
with a curse lies upon us, if we shall so basely yield to a Spirit of
indifferency and neutrality, in a Cause which does so much concern Gods glory,
and the Kingdoms good, and shall not (especially in such a time as this)
zealously and constantly in our places and callings, according to our power,
apply our sincerest endeavors, notwithstanding all lets and oppositions, to
promote the same.

1. It cannot but be acknowledged, most worthy Senators, that the Churches of
God in times of Reformation, have ever thought it the fittest season of all
others, in some extraordinary manner to oblige themselves unto Almighty God, as
the Divine goodness has put it into your hearts (according to the laudable
practice, upon all occasions, of the most godly and religious Governors) to
strike a solemn Covenant with him, and by your Authority to enjoyne the same
to the Kingdoms, for the reformation and defense of Religion, Laws,
Liberties, as an excellent means to acquire the favor of God, and the uniting
and strengthening of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
against the common enemies of the true reformed Religion, peace and prosperity
of the Kingdoms, to the apparent manifestation of your most Christian zeal
and piety to God and to his truth: Wherefore we cannot here but make our sad
complaint unto your Honors, in the expression of our deepest sense of that
great dishonor which is done unto the heavenly Majesty in the most horrible
slighting and treacherous infringement of this most sacred Oath, and that bold
contempt which is offered at this day to the authority of this renowned
Parliament, in this their so religious undertaking and injunction, on the one
part by those that altogether refuse to enter into this holy Covenant of God
and the Kingdoms, and on the other part by them which declaime against it, and
cast disgraceful aspersions upon it; that we can not look at these persons
(whatsoever their pretenses be) as any other then either malignant Enemies to
the Parliament, or the Peace and Union of the Kingdoms, and the reformation of
Religion; nor can we promise to our selves any security, so long as they are
suffered undiscovered, or unpunished, to live among us. We therefore make it
our humble prayer unto your Honors, that you would be pleased (as in your
pious wisdom you shall think most fit) to find out and appoint such ways or
means, to discover and bring so great misdoers and offenders against God and
your Authority to condign punishment, as may be most agreeable to the merit of
their so crying offenses; and that as you have long since enjoined by Ordinance
of Parliament the taking of this sacred Covenant, (which notwithstanding is not
yet done in many places of this Kingdom) so you would countenance and defend
it inviolable from neglect, infringement, scorn, and defamation, and by your
Civil sanction effectually impose it to be sworn by all without exception,
under some certain penalty, as best shall seem unto your Honors, to be duly
inflicted by your religious Justice upon the wilful contemners of the same.
And here give us leave in all humility to offer what seems to us both just and
necessary, That such persons as have not taken, and shall not take the solemn
League and Covenant, or having taken it, are manifestly disaffected to the ends
therein expressed, especially in point of Religion, may not be countenanced,
employed in, or advanced to places of public Trust, as being a discredit to
your Government, dangerous to the Kingdoms, and a hinderance to the
reformation of Religion. By so doing you shall preserve this great Oath of our
God from contempt and violation, a sin, which we humbly conceive is the
chiefest cause of most of those miseries and calamities that Gods just hand
has brought upon us.

II. When you did at first conclude upon that sacred Covenant, (wherein now you
have solemnly engaged both your selves and us) how glad were the hearts of all
the faithful in the Land, and what rejoicing was there at the Oath, as in the
days of Asa? We hoped then that our Religion (more precious then our lives,
which was that the truly godly had chiefly in their eye) had been so secured,
that all the malice, power, and policy both of men and devils should never
have been able to overturne the same; But with bleeding hearts we speak it,
how is it, that for all this, such an inundation of Errors, Schisms, Heresies
is broken in upon us, which if not speedily prevented by your Wisdoms, and
opposed by your impartial Justice, we fear will have its dreadful effect to
the total subversion of the power of godliness. We are even struck with
such astonishment that after such a Covenant, there should such blasphemies be
uttered to Gods highest dishonor; that such heretical opinions should be
broached, to the never so much vilifying of the truth; that such Schisms
should be acted and fomented, to the renting and dividing of the Church; that
the Government established should be so much defamed, and opposed to the
contempt of the Parliament, in words, in books, in practice, by the Sectaries
of these times, who yet seem as men under sanctuary, finding nothing done unto
them, for the hindering of these mischiefs, or the punishment of these
enormities. God has done great things for us, and has showed us great
Salvation as at this day, then woe be to us if these be our returns for so
great blessings. Trusty and Right Worthy Patriots, we know not whither to go
in these our sad distempers, but unto you whom God and this Kingdom has
betrusted with what is most precious unto him, and dearest unto us, the
protection of Religion, the preserving of it in Doctrine pure, and in
discipline from contempt and scorn, is that for which above all things else
we besee^^ your Honors again and again. Here we would lay the stre^^ of
our desires, and express the urgency of our affections, (...) think we can
never say enough for our God, and for his Truth: What are our estates, our
liberties, our lives unto us, if the Ark of God be taken? if that be gone,
the glory, yea, the life of our lives is departed from England. We tremble to
think, if a remedy be not suddenly applied, what will be the issue of these
things. Wherefore our humble desires are renewed to your Honors, That you
would be pleased to give Authority to suppress all such from public
Preaching, as have not duly been Ordained, whereby their gifts for the
Ministry, and their soundness in the Faith might be evinced: As also,
separate Congregations, the very nurseries of all damnable Heresies: That an
Ordinance be made for some exemplary punishment to be inflicted upon Heretics
and Schismatics, that your utter dislike of them and their proceedings may be
manifest to all the world, which had been made long since to appear by a
well-setled Reformation, had not his Majesty denied his consent to the Bill for
the Assembly, so often presented to him by both Houses, according to your own
Declaration in answer to his Majesty's of the 23 of October, 1642.

And that all Godly and Orthodox Ministers who labor in Gods husbandry, may
have encouragement, some course being thought upon in your wisdoms for their
competent maintenance, the Lord having so ordained that they which preach the
Gospel, should live of the Gospel: so shall Religion flourish, the wrath of
God be averted, the lips of the just shall bless you, and a gracious
recompense of reward from Gods most bounteous hand shall surely wait upon you.

And forasmuch as the welfare and safety of this Kingdom does next under God
in the preservation of true Religion, depend upon the fundamental
Constitutions of the same, and the maintenance thereof, which fundamental
Constitutions do most eminently appear in the calling of that great Council
the Parliament, and in electing of Members for the same, wherein most
conspicuously does shine the Liberty and Property of the Subject, here we can
do no less, then make it our hearty prayer unto your Honors, that you would
be pleased to give strict order, that writs for a free election without delay
may be issued to all places, where Knights and Burgesses for Parliament are yet
to be chosen; and to provide that the people be not prejudiced in their free
choice, either by force, fear, letters, promises, or solicitations of any:
that the Subjects liberties being defended and preserved, they may be
encouraged and better enabled to serve your Honors and the Public.

IV. And here we not omit to hint unto your Honors, the exorbitant practices
of many Committees and Committee men, who have such an influence by means of
their Authority upon the people, they being at their wills, and in their power
to do them a displeasure, that they dare not do otherwise then obey their
unlawful Commands, without the inevitable hazard of their peace and safety;
through which means tyranny is exercised by one fellow subject upon another,
and justice and equity cannot enter: The cries of all sorts of people
throughout the land are grown so loud against the people of this vocation and
profession, by reason of those grievous oppressions that are continually acted
by them, that in tenderness of affection toward our brethren, not being
ignorant or insensible of our own sufferings in this kind, and the great
dishonor accruing to the Parliament thereby, that we cannot but be earnest
suitors to your mercy and justice that such may be dissolved.

V. The God of your salvation through the timous help of his willing people
has now expelled your adversaries, and brought us sat through the Red Sea of
our fears and troubles, to the borders of that sweet Canaan of our desired
peace; and what now remains, most worthy Patriots, but that in thankfulness
to God for his mercy, and in grateful acknowledgement of the loving affections
of his people in their so cheerful adventures in the Cause of God and the
Kingdom, but that the heavy yoakes should be loosed, to which they so readily
did submit their necks, nay desired you to put upon them for your security and
the Kingdoms weal? Which therefore is our humble request, that the enemies
being now subdued, the Armies may be disbanded, that the so much complained of
oppressions by their means may be redressed, and taxes for their support may
be released, and the Militia of the Kingdom settled: so shall you make it
appear to the shame of slanderous tongues, that this war has not been
intended as a trade, but as a means of regaining our lost peace, and that you
had no other design in prosecution of the same, then the securing of our
Religion, Laws and Liberties, so desperately invaded by tyrannical
oppressors; and shall indeare the affections of this people to you for your
future assistance, when in a time of need their help shall be required, and
they will become yours and the Kingdoms servants for ever.

VI. And now since God has helped us in our distress, in will not be
unacceptable service unto him, that we should put forth the bowels of our
Compassions to our distressed brethren, as being the most kindly fruits of
Gods merciful dealing with our selves; And what an object is Ireland for this
purpose? Most noble Senators, sinoe God has shown you mercy, in subduing your
enemies here, let us be your earnest Petitioners for gasping, dying Ireland, in
this their great extremity: for in thoughts of their calamities our bowels are
rolled within us; never did their necessities call louder to your mercy then
now they do.

VII. And certainly one singular means to ^^^^ure so great ablessing, must
needs be the firm and established union of these Kingdoms according to our
Covenant: In which respect we cannot but with sorrowful and perplexed hearts,
resent the hellish devices of malignant, factious, and seditious spirits, who
make it their daily practice, and surely would rejoice in it as their
Masterpiece, if they could once effect to divide these Kingdoms of England and
Scotland, so firmly conjoined by a blessed, and we hope, everlasting union.
Therefore we return again unto your Justice, that according to our Covenant,
condign punishment may be inflicted upon such firebrands, the greatest enemies
to Church and State, and that your Honors would readily apply all tendrest
care in your most faithful and diligent endeavors for the preservation of
that happy union by solemn League of these two Kingdoms, which is so much the
envy of our enemies, the strength and glory of Great Britain, and the
greatest security of our Religion, peace and prosperity.

VIII. And whereas the hand of the Almighty has so eminently appeared on your
side, that your enemies are fallen under you, and has given the troublers of
yours and the Kingdoms peace into your hands: We do beseech that according
to the several qualities of their Delinquencies, your Justice may go forth
against them with speedy execution. And withal, that now you would be so
mindful of your great engagements, in the full and effectual discharge of
the Kingdoms debts (who have showed themselves such free Contributers, and
also have been such extreme sufferers for your assistance in the Kingdoms
cause) as to provide that a faithful improvement of the estates of these
notorious enemies of the Kingdom may be made by a right conversion of them
unto public use. And that those streams of wealth, which daily are flowing in
by Compositions of Delinquents, may according to your solemn promises run in
the right channel, and return back into that Ocean whence at your desire they
did so freely issue forth.

And whereas in your Wisdoms, your Honors have made so good provision, that
men of estates and fortunes in the world, may be repayed their disbursements
upon the loan of so much more, as in your Ordinance for the sale of Bishops
Lands does more fully appear: We do entreat that you would please to take
into your further consideration those well-affected persons who have so freely
and fully laid out themselves, as that they have not been able to make that
addition required in the aforesaid Ordinance, but must now be forced for the
relief of their great necessities, to sell at great loss, their very principal
lent upon the public Faith, to their great discouragement and discontent,
which we fear may prove no small impediment to your future assistance, if
need thereof should be, unless remedy herein shall by your Honors be provided.

IX. And for protections we need say little, so much having been said before
in our Remonstrance, that we hope your Honors are so sensible of the
sufferings of those Creditors who have great sums of money owing by some of
your Members, and of the injustice of those among them, that have Estates to
satisfy their engagements, yet will not, but stand upon their privilege, as
there needs no other argument to move your Honors to do us justice in this
behalf.

X. And because we are obliged to endeavor the preservation of the Liberties
of the Kingdom, therefore that we may perform our engagements as to God and
you, so likewise to the Subjects of the Kingdom, whose sufferings in matters
that concern their Rights are our own; we hold our selves bound, in all
humility, to signify unto your Honors, that contrary to the Rights and
Liberties of the Subjects, on Friday evening the 4. of this instant month,
there was an illegal Warrant, signed by Sir William Strickland, served upon
three of our fellow Subjects, and fellow Citizens, by name Patrick Bamford,
Nicholas Widmerpoole, Valentine Fyge, to be taken into custody and committed
to a Sergeant at Arms; which thing was also done contrary to the Order of that
Honorable House, as by some of the Committee themselves was acknowledged.
Wherefore we do humbly pray, that the aforesaid Warrant with the manner of
its issuing forth, may be taken into your serious consideration for the
vindication of the Honor of the Parliament, which is herein so much concerned,
and maintenance of the Subjects Liberty, and to make such reparations to the
persons wronged as may stand with justice, and in your wisdoms shall se^ me
fit.

And now renowned Worthies, we trust that in your wonted goodness, you will
not entertain any misconceptions of us, for that we have endeavored to be a
little more patheticke and pressing in our phrase of speech then heretofore;
but that in your wisdoms you will thoroughly weigh our fears and sorrows with
our pressing burdens, which have even forced us as against our wills to these
expressions; and that looking upon the sincere affections of your Petitioners
you will please to make so benigue an interpretation of what we have here
represented in the urgency of our afflicted spirits, as not to think we had
the least aim to reflect upon the Honor of this famous Parliament: but that
the sense of our miseries in our approaching dangers might stand more
conspicuously before your eyes, and as by the most forcible argument we could
think upon, effectually to move your Honors (the great Physicians of our
Church and State) to apply your most seasonable and speedy help. The Glory of
God, the safety of our Religion and Liberties, and the Kingdoms welfare, is
that we level at in this our undertaking, If through your favorable
acceptance of these our humble addresses we may obtain the security of
these, we have our utmost aim; And you shall be called the Repairers of the
breaches, the Restorers of paths to dwell in, you shall raise monuments of your
eternal praises, the Churches of God shall call you blessed, and you shall for
ever engage us not to think our estates or lives too dear to serve your
Honors and the Public so long as we have breath and being.

FINIS.
