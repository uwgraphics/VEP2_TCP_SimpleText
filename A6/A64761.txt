To the Reader.
NOw God defend! what will become of me? I have neither consulted with the
stars, nor their Vrinals, the Almanacks. A fine Fellow, to neglect the
Prophets, who are read in England every Day! They shall pardon me for this
(...). There is a Mystery in their profession, they have not so much as heard
of: Coelum stellatum Christianum; a new Heaven fansied on the old Earth. Here
the Twelve Apostles have surprised the Zodiak, and all the Saints are ranged on
their North, and South sides. It were a pretty vanity, to preach when Saint
Paul is ascendent, and would not a Papist smile to have his Pope elected under
Saint Peter? Reader, if I studied these Things, I should think my self worst
imployd then the Roman Chaucer was in his Troilus. I come out as if there were
no Hours in the Day, nor Planets in the Hours: neither do I care for any
thing, but that Interlude of Perendenga in Michael Cervantes: Let the old Man
my Master live, and Christ be with us all. Thou will wonder now where this
drives, for I have neither a Conde de lemos, nor a Cardinal to pray for. I pray
for the Dead, that is, I wish him a fair Remembrance, whose Labors have
deservd it. It happened in exposing my former Discourse to Censure, (a custom
has strangled many Truths in the Cradle) that a Learned Man suggested to me
some bad Opinion he had of my Author, Henricus Cornelius Agrippa. I ever
understood, it was not One, but many in whose sentiment that miracle suffered.
It is the Fortune of deep writers to miscary because of obscurity: Thus the
Spots in the Moon with some Men are Earth, but it is more probable they are
water. There is no Day so clear, but there are Lees toward the Horizon: so
inferior Wits, when they reflect on higher Intellects, leave a Mist in their
Beams. Had he lived in Ignorance, as most do, he might have past hence like
the last years Clouds, without any more Remembrance. But as I believe the
Truth a maine Branch of that End, to which I was born; so I hold it my Duty to
vindicate him, from whom I have received it. The world then being not able to
confute this man's Principles by Reason, went about to do it by Scandal, and the
first Argument they fastend on, was that of the Jews against his Sviour: Thou
art a Samaritan, and have a Devil. The Chief in this Persecution is Cicognes,
and after him Delrio in his Fabulous Disquisitions. But Paulus Iovius stirred
in the Vomit, who amongst other men's Lives has put my Author to Death. It is
done indeed Emphatically betwixt Him, and his Poet, whom he hired (it seems) to
stitch verse to his Prose, and so patched up the Legend. Quis (says he) in
Henrici Cornelii Agrippae sedato vultu portentosum Ingenium latuisse
crediderit? In his subsequent Discourse he states his Question, and returns my
Authors best parts as a Libell on his memory. But that which troubles him most
of all is, That Agrippa should prove his Doctrine out of the Scriptures. Then
he inculcates the solemn Crambe of his Dog-Devill, whose Collar Emblematically
wrought with Nails, made the Ruff to his Familiar. For a Close to the story,
he kills him at Lions, where being near his Departure he unravelled his Magic
in this desperate Dismission, Abi perdita Bestia, qui me totum perdidisti. This
is the most gross Lie, and the least probable in every circumstance that ever
was related. Devils use not to quit their Conjurers in the day of Death,
neither will they at such Times be exterminated. This is the hour wherein they
attend their Prey, and from seeming servants become cruel Masters. Besides, is
it not most gross, That any should dog this Devil from Agrippa's Lodging to
Araris, where (says this Prelate) he plunged himself? Certainly spirits pass
away invisibly, and with that dispatch no mortal man can trace them. Believe
this, and believe all the Fables of Purgatory. Now Reader, thou have heard the
worst, lend a just Ear, and thou shall hear the Best. Johannes Wyerus, a
professed Adversary to Ceremonial Magic, and sometimes seccretary to Cornelius
Agrippa, in his Daemonomania speaks thus. He wonders that some learned Germans
and Italians were not ashamed to traduce his Master in their public writings.
That he had a Dog whose Call was Mounsieur he confesses: and this Spaniell
during his service he used to lead, when Agrippa walked abroad, in Loro ex
pilis concinnato. At revera (says he) Canis erat Naturalis Masculus, To which
also Agrippa coupl'd a Bitch of the same color called Madammoyscelle. It is
confessed he was fond of this Dog, as some men are, and having divorced his first
wife, would suffer him for a Sarcasm, to sleep with him under the sheets. In
his study too, this dog would couch on the Table by his Master, whence this
great Philosopber, inter supellectilem Chartaceam certe insignem delitescens,
says Wyerus, would not sometimes stir out for a whole week together. So
studious was he for the good of posterity, who have but coldly rewarded him for
his pains. I have observed also in his Epistles, That when he was resident at
Malines, his Domestics used to give him an account in their Letters how his
dogs Fared; so fond was he of those Creatures. But to come to the rest of the
Legend; Paulus Iovius tells you he died at Lions ignobili, and tenebroso in
diversorio: But Wyerus, who had more Reason to be inquisitive after his masters
death, tells me he died at Granople, and that in Domino, not desperately as his
Enemies would have it. Here now was a Ioviall stride from Gratianopolis to
Lugdunum: Sure this Paul was a scant Geographer. But Reader, it is not my
Intention to conceal any thing in this matter, know therefore that Agrippa had
another dog, his Filioli: and this last died in more respect then most of his
masters Adversaries. For my author by some secret means having strangely
qualified him, diverse learned men writ Epitaphs upon him, whereof some have
been published, and are yet extant. Out of this Fable of the Cerberus Baptista
Possevinus pumpt these verses.

Vivens quem cernis Tumulum, ne ferte meretur
Os placidum, stygii Rex fuit iste Lacus.
Quare etiam Custode^ habuit, du^ viveret, Orci,
Cui nunc in Tenebris praeda daret Comitem.
Ast Hic, st Ingeniu^ moderari scisset, ad Auras
Tantum isset, Quantum Tartara nigra subit.
Thus have they all-to-be-divell'd him, but why may not Truth run in verse,
as well as scandal?

Sic Agrippa ingens, duplici quoque sufficit Orbi,
Fractaque diversas Fabrica monstrat Opes.
Terram Terra capit Caeloque affinia Coelum
Possidet: Hoc vivus scripserat ante Sophos.
Naturam Natura trahit: similemque Supernae
Hanc animam, agnoscit vita superna suam.
Sic vivens, Moriensque Docet: dumque altus in Astra
Tendit, habet Magicas parca vel ipsa Manus.
Now Reader, if thou would be further satisfied in his distaste of Black
Magic, I wish thee to read his most Christian Invective against the German
Conjurer entertained in the French Court. Nay, so zealous, and nice of
Conscience was he, that being solicited by some Divines for a Comment on
Trismegistus, he returned them a very tart answer, referring all true knowledge
to the Scripture. In a word, he did not only hate impious, but vain Arts; For
he lost the Favor of the Queen Mother, because he would not be employed by her
in Astrology. A science in whose true natural part, which concerns
Generation and Corruption, he was skilled to a miracle: but he knew it was
bootles to look fatal Events in the Planets, for such are not written in
Nature, but in the superior Tables of Praedestination. Having thus then
sufficiently proved his Integrity, I will in a few words discover the grounds
of his persecution. He was a man reformed in his Religion, and had I the
leisure to cite his works, I could quickly prove he was not of the Roman
Church. For in his Book de vanitate scientiarum he allows not of Monks and
Friars, but calls them Sects, Quibus carvit Ecclesia, cum fuit Optima. And
certainly that notable Jest of his on the Cowle, nettles the Papists to this
Day. He disclaimes also their Images, their Invocation of Saints, their
Purgatory and Pardons, and would have the Laity communicate sub utraque specie.
He corrects the Pope himself sufficiently, and is utterly against the
Inquisition Office. what also his Opinion was of Luther, is not hard to guess
out of his Epistles: For in a letter to Melancthon he has these words.
Salutabis per me invictum illum Haereticum Martinum Lutherum, qui (ut ait
Paulus in Actibus) servit Deo suo secundum sectam quam vocant Haeresin. Lastly,
he was altogether for the written word, preferring it to humane Constitutions,
which is contrary to the Papist, who will not allow it to be the Judge of
Controversies. This is the Man, and thus qualified at Home, howsoever the world
has rendered him abroad. Now for his more mysterious Principles, thou have
their Maine in this Discourse, which if thou can apprehend, I know thou will
style him in particular, as Trismegistus does Man in General, (...): or as
Panaetius did his Plato, Hominem Divinum, Sanctissimum, sapientissimum and
Homerum Philosophorum. But this sluttish shuffle fits not his Memory, and
Things fall from me now as strictures, not Compositions. I shall say nothing
more, but leave thee to thy studies, whiles I translate that Epitaph of
Platina, to his Tom. 6.

Quisquis es, si pius, Agrippam
Et suos ne vexes: Anguste
Iacent, and soli volunt esse.
E. P.
ANIMA MAGICA ABSCONDITA.
TO build Castles in the air, is a Common Proverb with all Men, but a Common
Practice with the Peripateticks only. I have oftentimes admired, That the very
end and Result of their Philosophy did not clearly discover its falsity. It is
a mere Help to Discourse. Mood and Figure are their two pillars, their Non
ultra: Their Heptarchie ends in a Syllogism, and the best professor amongst
Them is but a scold well disciplined. Their seven years study are seven years
of Famine; They leave the Soul not satisfied, Gen:
and are more a Dream then that of Pharaoh. For verily if the stage, and Reign
of Dreams be no where beyond Fancy, then the Fancies of these men being no
where beyond their Authors, may rest on the same Pillow. This Sect then may be
styled (...): Their Conceptions are not grounded on any Reason existent in
Nature, but they would ground Nature on Reasons framed, and principl'd by their
own Conceptions. Their Philosophy is built on general empty Maxims, Things of
that stretch and latitude they may be applied to any Thing but conduce to the
Discovery of Nothing. These are the first Lineaments of their Monster, and in
reference to them they have many subordinate Errors, which praetend a Symmetrie
with their Fundamentalls, but in truth have none at all. These later Quillets
are so minced with Divisions and Distinctions, That their very patrons are
dubious how to state them. I could compare their Physiologie to a Chase in
Arras, where there is much of similitude, but nothing of Truth. It Is the Child
of Fancy, a Romance in Syllogisms, a Texture of their own Brain, like that
Cob-web Campagnia, which Lucians Spiders planted betwixt the Moon, and Venus.
Nature in General (say They) is Principium Motus, and quietis. A Form is
(...), a definition they know not what to make of, and the soul is (...), or
actus Corporis Organici. These Two last Descriptions (for they are no
Substantial definitions) are such Riddles, that I verily believe Aristotle made
use of those words (...) and (...) because he would not discover his Ignorance
in these points. For why should a Form, be called (...), or in what other
Author can we find this (...)? But because Nature in General, that is, in her
Active, and Passive portions, namely Matter and Form, together with the Soul of
man, are the main Fundamentals wherein to build a Philosophy, and that this
Aristotle is so Sainted by his Clients, that the Divines of Collein tell us, He
was praecursor Christi in Naturalibus, ut Johannes Baptista in Gratuitis; I
shall further examine these his Definitions, and acknowledge the Benefit when I
find it.

In the first place then, it may be thought I am beholding to this Man for
telling me, that Nature is a Principle. So I may tell the Reader, The
Magician's passive spirit is a principle, but if I tell him not what kind of
substance it is, I will allow him ten years study, and if the Sun went back
every day ten Degrees in his Dial, he shall not without a supernatural
assistance know what, or where it is. But you will reply: He tells me further,
it is a principle causet^ Bodies to move and rest. I thank him for his Nothing.
I desire not to know what this Principle does, for that is obvious to every
Eye; but I would know what it is, and therefore he may pocket his Definition.
Again you will object, he tells me not only that Nature is a Principle, but
that Natura est Forma, and by Consequence Forma est Natura. This is Idem per
Idem, he retains me in a circle of notions, but resolves nothing at all
Essentially. Besides, Forma in the genuine scope of the Language signifies the
outward symmetrie, or shape of a Compound. But the Peripateticks who impose on
^oungs, as they do on Nature, render it otherwise in their Books; and mistake
the effect for the cause. I shall therefore take it in Their sense, and be
content for once to subscribe to their Comments. Forma then in their Conception
is the same with (...), or vis Formatrix, which Aristotle defines (...). I must
confess I do not understand him, and therefore I shall take him upon Trust, as
his Disciples expound him. Est enim (...) ( says Magirus) quoniam absolvit,
expolit, and informat Rem Naturalem, ut per eam una ab Altera distinguatur.
This is an express of the Office and Effect of Forms, but nothing at all to
their Substance, or Essence

Now let us see what he says to the Soul of Man. The Soul (says he) is (...)
that is in plain Terms Consummatio, or barbarously but truly Finitatio, though
his own followers falsely render it, Actus Corporis Organici. But this
definition is common to beasts, and plants, and therefore he has stumbl'd on
another; Anima est Principium quo vivimus; sentimus; movemur, and Intelligimus.
Now both these descriptions concern only the Operations and Faculties which
the Soul exercises in the Body, but discover not her Nature, or Original at
all. It was ingenuously done of Galen, who confessed his Ignorance concerning
the substance of the Soul, but this Fellow who had not so much honesty is
voic'd Prince of Philosophers, and the positions of more glorious Authors are
examined by his Dictats, as it were by a Touchstone; Nay the Scripture it self
is oftentimes wrested, and forced by his Disciples to vote a Placet to his
Conclusions. It is a miserable task to dwell on this Ethnic, to gather his
straw and stubble most of our Days, and after all to be no better acquainted
with our selves, but that the Soul is the Cause of Life, sense, motion, and
understanding. I pity our Customarie Follies, that we bind our selves over to
a Prentiship of Expense and study, only to compass a few superficial Trueths
which every plowman knows without book. Verily Nature is so much a Tutor, that
none can be ignorant in these Things: for who is so stupid as not to know the
Difference between Life and Death, the absence, and presence of his Soul? Yet
these very definitions, though looked upon as rare, profound, Philosophical
Determinations, instruct us in nothing more. Away then with this Peripateticall
Philosophy, this Vain Babbling, as S. Paul justly styles it, for sure enough he
had some Experience of it at Athens, in his Dispute about the Resurrection. Let
us no more look on this Olla Podrida, but on that Spirit which resides in the
Elements: for this produces real Effects by the subsequent Rotations of
corruption and generation, but the spirit of Error, which is Aristotl's,
produces naught but a multiplicity of Notions. Observe then, that this
Stagirit and Nature are at a great distance, the One ends in works, the other
in word: his Followers refine the old Notions, but not the old Creatures. And
verily the Mystery of their profession consists only in their Terms: if their
Speculations were exposed to the world in a plain dress, their sense is so
empty, and shallow, there is not any would acknowledge Them for Philosophers.
In some Discourses, I confess they have Nature before them, but they go not
the right way to apprehend her, They are still in Chase, but never overtake
their Game: for who is he amongst Them, whose knowledge is so entire and
regular, that he can justify his Positions by Practice? Again, in some Things
they are quite besides the Cushion, they scold and squable about Whymzies and
Problems of their own which are no more in Nature then Lucian's Lachanopters,
or Hippogypians. Now the Reason of their Errors is, because they are
Experienced in nothing but outward Accidents, or Qualities: and all the
performance they can do in Philosophy is to pronounce a Body Hot, or Cold
moist, or dry; But if they mind the Essential Temperament, they are grossly
mistaken in stateing these Qualifications for it is not the Touch, or sight
that can discern Intrinsecal, true Complexions. A Body that is outwardly Cold
to the Sense, may be hotter in Occulto where the genuine Temperament lies, then
the Sun himself is in Manifesto. But they know not the Providence of Nature how
she interposeth a different resisting Quality in the Circumference of every
Thing, lest the Qualities of Ambient Bodies should conspire in too great a
measure with the Center, and so procure a Dissolution of the Compound. Thus she
interposeth her passive refreshing Spirit between the Centrall Fire, and the
Sulphur; Again she places the Sulphur between the Liquor of the Celestial
Luna, and her outward Mercury. A rare and Admirable Texture, infallibly
proving, That none but God only wise, who foresaw the Conveniences and
Disconveniencies of his Creatures, could range them in that saving Order, and
Connection. But to go further with these Peripateticks: Their Philosophy is a
kind of Physiognomy, They will judge of invisible, Inward Principles, (Forms
as they call them) which are shut up in the Closet of the Matter, and all this
in perusing the outside, or Crust of Nature. 'Twere a foolish presumption, if a
Lapidarie should undertake to state the value, or Luster of a Jewel that is
Locked up, before he opens the Cabinet. I advice them therefore to use their
Hands, not their Fancies, and to change their Abstractions into Extractions;
for verily as long as they lick the shell in this fashion, and pierce not
experimentally into the Center of things, they can do no otherwise then they
have done; they cannot know things substantially, but only describe them by
their outward effects and Motions, which are subject, and obvious to every
Common Eye. Let them consider therefore, That there is in Nature a Certain
spirit which applies himself to the matter, and actuates in every Generation.
That there is also a passive Intrinsecal principle where he is more immediately
resident then in the rest, and by mediation of which he communicates with the
more gross, material parts. For there is in Nature a Certain Chain, or
subordinate propinquity of Complexions between Visibles, and invisibles, and
this is it by which the superior, spiritual Essences descend, and converse
here below with the Matter. But have a care lest you misconceive me. I speak
not in this place of the Divine spirit, but I speak of a certain Ar^ by which
a particular Spirit may be united to the universal, and Nature by consequence
may be strangely exalted, and multiplied. Now then, you that have your Eyes in
your Hearts, and not your Hearts in your Eyes, attend to that which is spoken,
and that I may exhort you to Magic in the Magicians phrase, Intellectu Cordis
Audite.

It is obvious to all those whom Nature has enriched with sense, and
convenient Organs to to exercise it, That every body in the World is subject to
a certain Species of Motion. Animals have their Progressive outward, and their
Vital Inward Motions. The Heavens are carried with that species, which the
Peripateticks call Lation, where by the way I must tell you, it proceeds from
an Intrinsecall Principle, for Intelligences are fabulous. The Air mooves
variously, The Sea has his Flux and Refluxe. Vegetables have their growth and
augmentation, which necessarily infer a Concoction; And finally the Earth,
with her Mineralls and all other Treasures, are subject to alteration, that is
to Generation and Corruption. Now the Matter of it self being merely Passive,
and furnished with no motive Faculty at all, we must of necessity conclude,
that there is some other inward Principle which acts and regulates it in every
several species of motion. But verily it is not enough to call this Principle
a Form, and so bury up the Riches of Nature in this narrow, and most absurd
Formality. We should rather abstain from Scribbling, or study to publish that
which may make something for the Authors Credit, but much more for the benefit
of the Readers. To be plain then, this Principle is Anima Mundi, or the
universal spirit of Nature. This Anima is retaind in the Matter by certain
other Proportionate natures, and missing a Vent, does Organizare Molem. She
labors what she can to resume her former Liberty, frames for her self a
Habitation here in the Center, puts her Prison into some good order, and
brancheth into the several Members, that she may have more room to act and
employ her Faculties. But you are to observe, that in every Frame there are 3
leading Principles. The first is this Anima whereof we have spoken something
already. The second is that which is called spiritus Mundi, and this spirit is
the medium per quod Anima infunditur and movet suum corpus. The third is a
certain oleous aethereall water: this is Menstruum, and Matrix Mundi, for in
it all things are framed and preserved. The Anima is a Compound ex aura
tenuissima, and luce simplicissima. Hence that admirable Platonicall Poet
styled it -- Aurai simplicis ignem. Virg.

Neither should you wonder that I say it is a Compound, for there is no perfect
specificall Nature that is simple and void of Composition, but only that of God
Almighty. Trust not then to Aristotle, who tells you, that the Elements are
Corpora simplicia, for the contrary has been manifested by absolute,
infallible Experience. The Passive spirit is a thin aereal substance, the
only immediate Vestiment wherein the Anima wraps her self, when she descends
and applies to Generation. The Radical Vital liquor is a pure Celestial
Nature, answering in Proportion and complexion to the superior interstellar
Waters. Now as soon as the Passive spirit attracts the Anima, which is done
when the first link in the Chain moves (of which we shall speak in its due
place) then the aethereall water in a moment attracts the Passive spirit, for
this is the first visible Receptacle wherein the superior Natures are
Concentrated. The Soul being thus confined and imprisoned by lawful Magic in
this Liquid Crystal, the Light which is in her streams thorough the Water,
and then it is Lux manifest e visibilis ad oculum, in which state it is first
made subject to the Artist. Here now lies the Mystery of the Magicians
denarius, his most secret and miraculous Pyramid, whose first Unity or Cone is
always in Horizonte Eternitatis, but his Basis or Quadrate is here below in
Horizonte Temporis. The Anima consists of three Portions of light, and one of
the matter. The Passive spirit has two parts of the Matter, and two of the
Light, wherefore it is called Natura media, and Sphaera Equalitatis; The
Celestial Water has but one portion of Light to three of the Matter. Now the
Chain of Descent which concerns the spiritual parts, is grounded on a
similitude, or Symboll of Natures according to that Principle of Osthanes
(...). For there being three Portions of Light in the Anima, and two in the
Passive spirit, the Inferior attracts the Superior. Then there being but one
Portion in the Celestial Nature, and two in the Middle spirit; this solitary
shining Unity, attracts the other Binarius to Fortify and augment its self,
as Light joins with Light, or Flame with Flame, and thus they hang in a Vital
magneticall Series. Again the Chayn of Ascent which concern the Matter, is
performed thus. The Celestial nature differs not in substance from the
Aereall Spirit, but only in Degree and Complexion; and the Aereall spirit
differs from the Aura, or Material part of the Anima in Constitution only, and
not in Nature; So that those three being but one substantially, may admit of a
perfect, Hypostaticall Union, and be carried by a certain intellectual Light
in Horizontem Mundi super-supremi, and so swallowed up of Immortality. But me
thinks Nature complains of a Prostitution, that I go about to diminish her
Majesty, having almost broken her S^ale, and exposed her naked to the World. I
must confess I have gone very far, and now I must recall my self: For there
is a necessity of reserving, as well as publishing some things, and yet I will
speak of greater matters. The Anima though in some sense active, yet is she
not so essentially, but a mere Isntrumental Agent, For she is guided in her
Operations by a Spiritual Metaphysicall Grain, a Seed or Glance of Light,
simple, and without any Mixture descending from the first Father of Lights. For
though his full-ey'd Love shines on nothing but Man, yet every thing in the
World is in some measure directed for his Preservation by a spice or touch of
the first Intellect. This is partly confirmed by the Habitation and Residence
of God: For he is seated above all his Creatures, to hatch as it were, and
cherish them with living Eternal Influences which daily and hourly proceed
from him. Hence he is called of the Cabalists Cether, and it answers to
Parmenides his Corona Ignea, which he placed above all the Visible spheres.
This Flux of Immateriall powers, Christ himself, in whom the Fulness of the
Godhead resided, confirmed, and acknowledged in the Flesh: For when the
diseased touched his Garment, though the prease was great, he questioned who it
was, adding this Reason, I perceive (said he) that virtue is gone out of me.
But laying aside such Proofs, though the Scripture abounds in Them, let us
consider the Exercise, and practice of Nature here below, and we shall find
her Game such, she can not play it without this Tutor. In the first place then,
I would feign know who taught the spider his Mathematics? how comes he to
lodge in the Center of his Web, that he may sally upon all Occasions to any
part of the Circumference? How comes he to praemeditate, and forecast? for if
he did not first know, and imagine that there are Flies, whereupon he must
feed, he would not watch for them, nor spin out his Netts in that exquisite
form, and Texture. Verily we must needs confess, that he who ordained Flies
for his sustenance, gave him also some small light to know, and execute his
Ordinance. Tell me if you can, who taught the Hare to Countermarch, when she
doubles her Trace in the pursuit to confound the sent, and puzzle her
persecutors? who counsels her to stride from the Double to her Form, that her
steps may be at a greater distance, and by cnosequence the more difficult to
find out? Certainly this is a well ordered policy, enough to prove that God is
not absent from his Creatures, but that Wisdom reaches mightily from one end
to another, Wis.
and that his Incorruptible spirit fills all things. But to speak something
more immediately apposite to our purpose. Let us consider the several products
that are in nature, with their admirable features and symmetrie. We know very
well there is but one matter out of which there are formed so many different
shapes, and Constitutions. Now if the Agent which determinates, and figures the
matter, were not a discerning Spirit, it were impossible for him to produce any
thing at all. For let me suppose Hyliard with his Pencill, and Table ready to
pourtray a Rose: if he does not inwardly apprehend the very shape, and
proportion of that which he intends to limne, he may as well do it without his
eyes, as without his Intellectualls. Let us now apply this to the Spirit which
works in Nature. This moves in the Center of all things, has the matter
before him, as the Potter has his clay, or the Limner his colors. And first
of all he exercises his chemistry in several Transmutations, producing
Sinews, Veins, blood, flesh, and bones: which work also includes his
Arithmetic for he makes the Joints and all Integrall parts, nay, as Christ
tells us, the very Hairs of our Heads, in a certain determinate Number; which
may conduce to the beauty and motion of the Frame. Again in the outward
Lineaments, or symmetrie of the compound, he proves himself a most regular
Mathematician, proportioning Parts to Parts, all which Operations can proceed
from Nothing but a Divine, Intellectual spirit. For if he had not several
Ideas or Conoeptions correspondent to his several Intentions, he could not
distinguish the one from the other: And if he were not sensible, if he did not
foresee the work he does intend, then the End could be no Impulsive cause, as
the Poripateticks would have it.

The Consideration of these several offices which this spirit performs in
Generation, made Aristotle himself grant, That in the Seeds of all Things there
were Virtutes similes Artificiis. We should therefore examine who weaves the
flowers of Vegetables? who colors them without a pencill? who bolts the
branches upwards, and threads (as it were) their Roots downwards? for all these
actions include a certain Artifice, which cannot be done without Judgment, and
Discretion. Now our Savior tells us, My Father works hitherto; and in
another place, it is God clothes the Lilie of the Field and again not one
Sparrow falls without your Father. Verily this is the Truth, and the Testemony
of Truth, notwithstanding Aristotle and his Problems. Neither should you think
the Divine Spirit disparaged in being president to every generation, because
some Products seem poor, and contemptible: For verily as long as they conduce
to the Glory of their Author, they are noble enough, and if you reflect upon
Egypt, you will find the basest of his Creatures to extort a Catholic
Confession from the Wizards; Digitus Dei est hic, The Finger of God is here.
Exodus
That I may come then to the point, These invisible, Centrall Artists are
Lights seeded by the first Light, in that primitive Emanation, or sit Lux,
which some falsely render Fiat Lux. For Nature is (...), not a mere sound or
Command, but a substantial active Breath, proceeding from the Creatour^ and
penetrating all things. God himself is (...); and this is the only sense
wherein a Form may be defined (...). I know this will seem harsh to some Men,
whose ignorant zeal, has made them Adversaries to God, for they rob him of his
Glory, and give it to his Creature, nay sometimes to fancies, and Inventions of
their own. I wish such Philosophers to consider, whether in the beginning there
was any life, or wisdom beyond the Creator, and if so, to tell us where. Verily
(to use their own Term) they can never find this Ubi. For they are gracious
concessions, or Talents which God of his free will has lent us, and if he
should resume them, we should presently return to our first Nothing. Let them
take heed therefore whiles they attribute Generation to Qualities: lest the
true Author of it, should come against them with that charge, which he brought
sometimes against the Assyrian. Shall the ax boast it self against Him that
heweth therewith? Isai.
or shall the saw magnify it self against him that shakes it? as if the Rod
should shake it self against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should
lift up it self, as if it were no wood. Let them rather cashier their
Aristotle, and the Errors wherewith he has infatuated so many Generations. Let
them approach with confidence to the Almighty God, who made the world, for none
can give a better account of the work then the Architect. Let them not despair
to attain his Familiarity, for he is a God that desires to be known, and will
reveal himself both for the manifestation of his own glory, and the Benefit of
his Creature. There is no reason then why we should decline this great, and
glorious Schoolmaster, whose very Invitation speaks more then an Ordinary
Encouragement. Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and our Maker: Ask
me of things to come concerning my Sons, Is. xlv.
and Concerning the Work of my Hands Command you Me. I have made the Earth, and
created man upon it; I, even my hand, have stretched out the Heavens, and all
their Hosts have I commanded. But it will be questioned perhaps, how shall we
approach to the Lord, and by what means may we find him out? Truly not with
words, but with works, not in studying ignorant, Heathenish Authors, but in
perusing, and trying his Creatures: For in them Lies his secret path, which
though it be shut up with thorns and Briars, with outward worldly Corruptions,
yet if we would take the pains to remove this luggage, we might Enter the
Terrestrial Paradise, that Hortus Conclusus of Solomon, where God descends to
walk, and drink of the sealed Fountain. But verily there is such a general
prejudice such a customary opposition of all Principles which cross Aristotle,
That truth can no sooner step abroad, but some Sophister or other flings Dirt
in her Face. It is strange that none of these Schoolmen consider, how the
several distinctions, and divisions translated from Logic to Divinity, have
set all Christendom on fire: How they have violated the Peace of many
flourishing Kingdoms, and occasioned more sects in Religion, then there are
opinions in Philosophy. Most seasonable then and Christian is that Petition of
Saint Augustine, A Logica libera nos Domine! In Genesis
And here I must desire the Reader not to mistake me^ I do not condemn the Use,
but the Abuse of Reason, the many subtleties, and Fetches of it, which Man has
so applied, That truth and Error are equally disputable. I am One that stands
up for a true Natural knowledge, grounded as Nature is, on Christ Jesus, who
is the true Foundation of all things visible, and Invisible. I shall therefore
in this Discourse, touch nearly upon those mysteries, which some Few have
delivered over to posterity, in difficult, obscure terms; That if possible,
the Majesty of truth, and the Benefit they shall receive from it, may settle
Men in a new way, and bring them at last from vain, empty Fancies, to a Real,
sensible Fruition of Nature.

You may remember how in my former discourse of the Nature of Man, I mentioned
a certain triplicity of Elements according to their several Complexions in the
several Regions of the world. I shall now speak of another triplicity much
more obscure and mystical, without which you can never attain to the former,
for these three principles are the Clavis of all Magic, without whose perfect
Knowledge you can never truly understand the least Idioms in Nature. The first
Principle is One in One, and One from One. It is a pure, white Virgin, and next
to that which is most pure, and simple. This is the first created unity. By
this all things were made, not actually, but Mediately, and without This
Nothing can be made either Artificial or Natural. This is Uxor D^i, and
stellarum. By mediation of this, there is a descent from One into Four, and an
ascent from three by four to the invisible, supernatural Monas. Who knows not
This, can never attain to the Art, for He knows not what he is to look for. The
second Principle differs not from the sirst in substance and dignity, but in
Complexion and Order. This second was the first, and is so still Essentially,
but by adhaesion to the Matter it contracted an impurity, and so fell from its
first unity, wherefore the Magicians style it Binarius. Separate therefore the
Circumference from the Center per Lineam Diametralem, and there will appear
unto thee the Philosophers Ternarius, which is the third Principle. This third
is properly no principle, but a product of Art. It is a various Nature,
Compounded in one sense, and Decompounded in another, consisting of Inferior
and superior powers. This is the Magicians Fire, This is Mercurius
Philosophorum, celeberrimus ille Microcosmus, and Adam. This is the Labyrinth
and Wild of Magic where a world of students have lost themselves: a thing so
confusedly and obscurely handled by such as knew it, that it is altogether
impossible to find it in their Records. There is no late writer understands the
full Latitude, and universality of this Principle, nor the genuine
Metaphysicall use thereof. It moves here below in shades and Tiffanies, above
in whites aethereall Vestures; neither is there any thing in Nature exposed to
such a public prostitution as this is, for it passes thorough all hands, and
there is not any Creature but has the use Thereof. This Ternarius, being
reduced per Quaternarium ascends to the Magical Decad, which is Monas
Unitissima, in which state Quaecunque vult, potest; for it is united then per
Aspectum to the first^ eternal, spiritual unity. But of these Three, hear the
Oracle of Magic, the great, and solemn Agrippa. Quatuor itaque quae diximus
sunt Elementa, sine Quorum notitia perfecta nullum in Magia producere possumus
effectum: Sunt autem Singula Triplicia, ut sic Quaternarius com pleat
Duodenarium: and per septenarium in Denarium progrediens ad supremam Unitatem,
unde omnis Virtus, and mirabilis operatio dependet, fiat progressus. Primo
igitu ordine Elementa pura sunt, Quae nec Componuntur, nec mutantur, nec
patiuntur commixtionem, sed Incorruptibilia sunt, and non a quibus, sed per
quae omnium naturalium rerum Virtutes producuntur in Effectum. Virtutes Illorum
a Nullo explicari possunt, quia in omnia possunt omnia. Haec qui ignorant, ad
nullam mitabilium Effectuum operationem pertingere potest. Secundi Ordinis
Elementa Composita sunt, multiplicia, and Varia, and impura, reducibilia tamen
per Artem ad puram simplicitatem, quibus tuno ad suam simplicitatem reversis
virtus est super omnia complementum dans omnium operationum occultarum and
operationum naturae: haec sunt fundamentum totius Magiae naturalis. Tertii
ordinis Elementa, haec primo and per se non sunt Elementa, sed Decomposita
varia multiplicia, and inter se invicem permutabilia: Ipsa sunt infallibile
Medium, ideoque vocantur media Natura, sive Anima mcdiae naturae: paucissimi
sunt, qui illorum profunda Mysteria intelligunt. In ipsis per certos Numeros,
gradus, and ordines: est Consummatio omnis Effectus in quacunque re Naturali,
Coelesti, and supercoelesti, miranda sunt^ and plena mysteriis quae operari
possunt in Magia tam Naturali, quam Divina: per ipsa enim omnium rerum
ligationes, etiam solutiones, and Transmutationes, and Futurorum cognitio and
praedictio, etiam Malorum Daemonum Exterminatio, and Bonorum Spirituum
conciliatio ab Illis descendit. Sinc his igitur Triplicibus Elementis,
eorundemque cognitione, nemo confidat se in occultis Magiae, and naturae
scient^is quicquam posse operari. Quicunque aurem haec in illa, impura in pura,
Multiplicia in Simplicia reducere noverit, Eorundemque Naturam, Virtutem,
potestatem in Numero, gradibus, and ordine sine Divisione substantiae
discernere sciverit: Is facile obtinebit omnium naturalium rerum and coelestium
secretorum sclentiam, and ooperationem perfectam. This is He with the black
Spaniell: or rather, This is he Qui ab ineunte aetate semper circa mirabilium
Effectuum, and plenas Mysteriorum operationes Curiosus, in trepidusque extitit
Explorator. Now for your further Instruction hear also the Dark Disciple of the
more dark Libanius Gallus. Joan. Trith.
Primum principium in uno consistit, non a quo, sed per Quod omnis mirandorum
naturalium virtus producitur in Effectum: per Quod diximus, quia Purum ab uno
procedens non componitur, neque mutatur. Ad ipsum a Ternario and quaternario
fit ad Monadem progressus, ut compleatur Denarius: per, ipsum enim est Numeri
regressus ad unum, simul descensus in quatuor, and Ascensus in Monadem.
Impossible est compleri Denarium, nisi per ipsum: Monas in Triade laeta
convertitur. Omnes hoc principium post principium Monadis Ignorantes nil in
Ternario proficiunt, nec ad sacrum quaternarium pertingunt. Nam etsi sapientum
Libros omnes habeant, syderum cursus, virtutes, potestates, operationes, and
proprietates perfect cognoscant, ipsorumque imagines, Annulos, and Sigilla and
secretissima quaeque ad plenum intelligant, nullum tamen mirandorum consequi
possent in suis operationibus effectum, sine hujus principii a principio
cognitione, in principium; unde omnes quotquot vidi in Magia Naturali Operantes
aut nihil consecuti sunt, aut ad vana, frivola, and superstitiosa, post longas
and inutiles operationes desperatione prolapsi sunt. Principium vero secundum
ordine non Dignitate quidem a Primo separatum quod unum existens facit
Ternarium, est quod operatur miranda per Binarium. In uno est enim unum, and
non est unum, est simplex, and in Quaternario componitur: Quo purificato per
Ignem in sole Aqua pura egreditur and ipsum ad suam simplicitatem reversum,
Complementum operanti monstrabit occultorum. Hic Centrum est totius Magiae
naturalis, cujus circumferentia sibi unita circulum repraesentat inmensus ordo
in infinitum: Virtus ejus super Omnia purificata, and simplex minor Omnibus,
Quaternario super gradu composita. Quaternarius autem Pythagoricus numerus
Ternario suffultus, si ordinem gradumque observat, purificatus purusque in uno,
ad Binarium in Ternario miranda and occulta Naturae operari potest. Hic est
Quaternarius in cujus mensura Ternarius Binario conjunctus in uno cuncta facit,
quae mirabiliter facit. Ternarius ad unitatem reductus per aspectum omnia in se
continet, and quae vult potest. Principium tertium per se non est principium,
sed inter ipsum and Binarium est finis omnis scientiae and Artis mysticae, ac
infallible Medii Centrum: in alio quam in ipso facilius non erratur, quoniam
paucissimi vivunt in Terris qui profunda ejus intelligant: Varium est
compofitum, and per septenarium in Ternarium octies multiplicatum consurgens,
and manens fixum. In ipso est consummatio Numeri graduum, and ordinis: per hoc
omnes Philosophi, occultorum naturae very Inquisitores mirabiles effectus
consecuti sunt; per ipsum ad simplex Elementum in Ternario reductum subito
fiunt infirmitatum curae miraculosae, and naturaliter omnium aegritudinum:
opusque in Magia Naturali and praeternaturali operantis consequitur Effectum
per dispositionem quaternarii. Praedictio futurorum per ipsum verificatur,
Occultorumque insinuatio, non aliunde quam per ipsum a Natura percipitur. Hoc
unico Medio secretum Naturae a peritur Alchimistis, sine quo nec Intellectus
Artis acquiritur, nec operationis Effectus invenitur. Errant, creed mihi,
Errant omnes, qui sine istis Tribus Principiis quicquam operari in occultis
Naturae Scientiis Se posse confidunt. Thus far Trithemius; where for thy better
understanding of him I must inform thee there is a twofold Binarius, Lucis, and
Confusionis: but peruse Agrippa seriously de scalis Numerorum, and thou may
apprehend all, for our Abbot borrowed this Language from Him, the perusal of
whose Books he had, before he published any thing in this Nature of his own.
Now for thy further Instruction go along with me, not to Athens or stagyra, but
to that Secretary and Penman of God Almighty, who stood in a Cleft of the Rock
when he made all his Goodness to pass before him. I am certain the world will
wonder I should make use of Scripture to establish Physiologie, but I would
have them know that all secrets Physical and Spiritual, all the close
Connexions, and that mysterious Kiss of God and Nature is clearly and
punctually discovered there. Consider that merciful mystery of the Incarnation
wherein the fulness of the Godhead was incorporated, and the Divine Light
united to the Matter in a far greater measure then at the sirst Creation.
Consider it I say, and thou shall find, that no Philosophy has perfectly
united God to his Creature, but the Christian, wherefore also it is the only
true Philosophy, and the only true Religion: for without this union there can
be neither a natural Temporal, nor a Spiritual aeternall Life. Moses tells us
that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth, that is the Virgin
Mercury, and the virgin Sulphur. Now let me advice you not to trouble your
selves with this Mercury, unless you have a true friend to instruct you, or
an Express Illumination from the first Author of it, for it is a Thing
attained Art mirabili. Observe then what I shall now tell you. There is in
every star, and in this Elementall world a certain principle which is Uxor
solis. These two in their Coition do emittere semen, which seed is carried in
the womb of Nature: But the ejection of it, is performed invisibly, and in a
Sacred silence: for this is the conjugall mystery of Heaven and Earth, their
Act of Generation, a thing done in private between particular Males and
Females, but how much more think you, between the Two universal Natures? Know
therefore that it is impossible for you to extract, or receive any seed from
the Sun, without this Faminine Principle, which is the Wife of the Sun. Now
then my small Sophisters of the stone, you that consume your time and substance
in making waters and Oils with a durty Caput Mortuum: You that deal in Gold
and Quicksilver being infatuated with the Legends of some late and former
Mountebanks: Consider the last end of such men. Did they obtain any thing by it
but diseases and Poverty? Did they not in their old age Inveterat^ dierum
malorum, fall to Clipping and Counterfeiting of Coin? and for a Period to
their Memory did they not die in Despair, which is the Child of Ignorance?
Know then for certain That the Magicians Sun and Moon are two universal
Peers: Male and Female, a King and Queen Regents, always young, and never
old. These two are Adaequate to the whole world, and coextended thorough the
universe. The one is not without the other, God having united them in his work
of Creation in a solemn Sacramental union. It will then be a hard and
difficult Enterprise to rob the Husband of his wife, to put those asunder, whom
God himself has put together: for they sleep both in the same Bed, and he that
discovers the one must needs see the other. The Love betwixt these two is so
great, That if you use this Virgin kindly, she will fetch back her Cupid,
after he has ascended from her in wings of Fire. Observe moreover that
Material Principles can be multiplied but materially, that is by addition of
parts, as you see in the Augmentation of Bodies, which is performed by a
Continual Assumption of Nutriment into the stomach, but it is not the Body
that transmutes the Nutriment into flesh and blood, but that spirit which is
the life and light of the Body. Material Principles are passive, and can
neither alter nor purify, but well may they be altered, and purified: neither
can they communicate themselves to another substance beyond their own extension
which is finite and determinate. Trust not those Impostors then who tell you of
a Sulphur Tingens, and I know not what Fables; who pin also that new and narrow
name of Chemia, on a science both Ancient and Infinite. It is the light only
that can be truly multiplied, for this ascends to, and descends from the first
Fountain of Multiplication, and Generation. This Light applied to any Body
whatsoever exalts and perfects it in suo genere. If to Animals, it exalts
Animals, if to Vegetables, Vegetables, if to Minerals, it refines Minerals, and
translates them from the worst to the best Condition. Where note by the way,
that every Body has passive principles in it self, for this light to work
upon, and therefore needs not borrow any from Gold, or silver. Consider then
what it is you search for, you that hunt after the Philosophers stone, for
Eiusdem est Transmutare, cujus est Creare: you seek for that which is most
high, but you look on that which is most Low. Two things there are which every
good Christian may, and ought to look after, Verum, and Necessarium. Truth is
the Arcanum, the Mystery and Essence of all Things: for every secret is truth,
and every substantial truth is a secret. I speak not here of outward
Historical trueths, which are but Relatives to Actions, but I speak of an
inward Essential Truth which is Light, for Light is the Truth, and it
discovers Falsehood which is Darkness. By this truth all that which is
necessary may be compassed, but never without it. I preferred wisdom (said the
wise King) before Sceptors and Thrones, and esteemed Riches nothing in
comparison of her. Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all
Gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as Clay
before her. I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead
of light, for the light that comes from her never goes out. All good things
came to me together with her, and Innumerable Riches in her Hands. And I
rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goes before them, and I knew not that
she was the Mother of them. If Riches be a Possession to be desired in this
Life, what is Richer then Wisdom that works all things? For she is privy to
the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. God has
granted me to speak as I would, and to concerve as is meet for the things that
are given me: because it is he that leads unto Wisdom, and directs the
wise, For in his hand are both we and our words, all wisdom also, and knowledge
of workmanship. For he has given me certain knowledge of the things that are,
namely to know how the world was made, and the Operation of the Elements. The
beginning, ending, and midst of the Times, the alterations of the turning of
the Sun, and the Change of seasons. The Circuit of years, and the position of
stars. The Natures of living Creatures, and the furies of wild Beasts, the
violence of winds, and the reasoning of Men: the Diversities of Plants, and
the virtues of roots. And all such things as are either secret or manifest,
them I know. For wisdom which is the worker of all things taught me. For in her
is an understanding spirit, holy, only begotten, manifold, subtle, lively,
clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good,
quick, which cannot be let, ready to do good, Kind to Man, steadfast, free
from Care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going thorough all
understanding, pure, and most subtle Spirits. For wisdom is more moving then
any motion, she passes, and goes through all Things by reason of her
pureness. For she is the Breath of the power of God, and a pure Influence
flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, therefore can no defiled thing fall
into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted
mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but One
she can do all things, and remaining in her self she makes all things new: and
in all Ages entering into Holy Souls, she makes them friends of God, and
Prophets. For God loves none but Him that dwells with wisdom. For she is
more beautiful then the Sun, and above all the Order of stars, being compared
with the Light, she is found before it. For after this comes Night, but Vice
shall not prevail against Wisdom. Thus Solomon, and again a greater then
Solomon; First seek you the Kingdom of God, and all these Things shall be given
you. For of a truth Temporal blessings are but ushers to the Spiritual, or
to speak more plainly, when once we begin to love the Spirit, then he sends us
these things as Tokens and pledges of his Love. For Promotion comes neither
from the East nor from the West, but from God that gives it. Verum (says One)
est esse, a quo nihil abesse cuiq^ nil adesse multoque minus obesse potest.
Necessariu^ id omne, quo carere no^ possumus. Veritas itaque su^ma virtus est,
ac inexpugnabile Castrum paucissimis inhaerentibus Amicis, at innumeris
obsessum inimicis, paulo minus quam toti mundo nunc invisum, sed insuperabile
Pignus iis qui possident illud. Hac in Arce verus and indubitatus Philosophorum
Lapis, and Thesaurus continetur, qui non erosus a tineis, nec perfossus a
furibus, manet in aeternum caeteris dissolutis omnibus, multis in Ruinam
positus, aliis ad salutem. Haec est res vulgo vilissima, spreta plurimum, and
exosa, non tamen odibilis, at amabilis, and preciosa supra Philosophis, supra
Gemmas, and aurum obrizon: Omnium amatrix, omnibus ferme inimica, ubique
reperibilis, and a paucissimis, quasi nullis, inventa per vicos acclamans
omnibus, Venite ad me omnes qui quaeritis, and Ego vos ducam in veram semitam.
Haec est res illa tautum a veris praedicata Philosophis, quae vincit omnia, nec
ab ulla re vincitur, Corpus, and Cor omne durum and solidum penetrans, ac omne
molle consolidans, and ab omni duro resistendum confirmans. Nobis omnibus se
facit obviam, and non videmus eam, vociferans, and alta voce dicens, Ego sum
via veritatis, transite per me: quia non est alius ad vitant transitus, and
nolumus eam audire. Odorem sua vitatis emittit, sed non percipimus eum. Dapibus
sese nobis liberaliter in sua vitatem offert indies and non degustamus eam^
Blande nos ad salutem trahit, and ejus tractui resistentes, sentire nolumus.
Quoniam facti sumus sicut lapides, oculos habentes and non videntes, aures
habentes and non audientes, nares non olfacientes habentes, ore linguaque
muniti non degustantes, neque loquentes manibus and pedibus nil operantes, nec
ambulantes. O miserum tale genus Hominum, quod lapidibus non est praestantius,
imo long inferius eo, quod hoc, non Illi rationem daturi sunt operationum
suarum! Transmutemini (inquit) transmutemini de lapidibus mortuis in Lapides
vivos philosophicos. Ego sum vera Medicina, corrigens and transmutans id quod
non est amplius, in id quod fuit ante Corruptionem, ac in Melius, ac id quod
non est, in id quod esse debet. Ecce prae foribus conscientiae vestrae sum
Noctes ac Dies pulsans, and non aperitis mihi, t^men expecto mitis, nec a vobis
irata recedo, sed patiens injurias sustineo vestras, cupiens per patientiam ad
eam exhortando vos ducere. Venite iterum, atque saepius iterum venite, Qui
sapientiam quaeritis and emite gratis, non auro nec Argento, minus laboribas
propriis, quod vobis offertur ultro. Sonora vox, suavis and grata
Philosophantium auribus. O Fons divitiarum Inexhaustibilis veritatem and
Justitiam sitientibus! O Desolatorum Imperfectioni solatium! Quid ultra
quaeritis Mortales anxii? Cur infinitis animos vestros curis exagiratis Miseri?
Quae vestra vos excaecat Dementia, quaeso? Cum in vobis, non ex Vobis sit omne
quod extra vos, non apud vos quaeritis. Proprium hoc solet esse vulgi vitium,
ut Propria contemnens, aliena quae sunt, semper appetat. Proprium hic pro nobis
appropriati sumimus, nam ex nobis ipsis nihil habemus Boni, sed si quid habere
Boni possumus, ab eo qui solus est Bonus, ferimus acceptum: e Contra quod
habemus Mali, nobis ipsi nos appropria vimus, ex alieno malo per inobedientiam.
Proprium ergo nihil Homini est ex suo praeterquam Malu^ quod possidet: Quod ex
Bono Bonum habet, non ex seipso, sed contribute proprium habet, ex Bono cum
recipit tamen. Lucet in nobis (licet obscure) Vita Lux hominum tanquam in
Tenebris, quae non ex nobis est, sed ab eo cujus est. Hic Illam planta vit in
Nobis, ut in ejus Lumine, qui lucem inhabitat inaccessibilem, videremus Lumen,
and hoc Caeteras ejus praecelleremus Creaturas: Illi similes hac ratione facti,
quod semtillam sui luminis dederit nobis. Est igitur veritas non in nobis
quaerenda, sed in imagine Dei, quae in Nobis est. This is He to whom the
Brothers of R. C. gave the Title of Sapiens, and from whose writings they
borrowed most of their Instructions ad Candidatum quendam Germaniae. But that
you may the better understand how to come by this stone, hear what he speaks in
another place. Non prius incipit vera Cognitio, quam perennium and Labilium,
cum vitae, tum Intetitus oblata comparatione, selegat anima cum animo jungi,
deleetatione majori tracto hujus, quam Corporis. Ex ea ^ognitione Mons oritur,
and Corporis voluntaria separatio sumit exordium, cum anima respiciens ex una
Corporis faeditatem and interitum, ex altera part praesta^itiam and
foelicitatem animi perpetuam, cum isto (divino sic disponente statu) connecti
cupit, altero penitus neglecto, ut hoc solum appetat, quod a Deo conclusum esse
videt in salutem and Gloriam: Corpus in amborum jam unitotum unionem
condescendere cogitur. Haec est admirabilis illa Philosophorum transmutatio
Corporis in Spiritum and hujus in corpus, de qua Dictum nobis relinquitur a
Sapientibus: Fac Fixu^ Volatile and volatile fac Fixu^, ut habeas magisterium
nostrum: (intellige) fac de pertinaci copore Tractabile, quod animi praestantia
cum anima conveniente constantissimum fiat corpus ad omnia sustinendum examina.
Probatur enim aurum igne, quo reprobatur omne quod aurum non est. O
praestantissimum Philosophorum aurum, quo ditantur sapientiae filii, non Illo
quod cuditur: Adeste qui Thesaurum Philosophorum tam vario Conatu quaeritis,
reprobatum a vobis Lapidem cognoscite, prius quis ille sit antequam quaeratur.
Mirum est super omne miraculum, quod quispiam appetat ignotum sibi: fatuum
certe videtur id ab hominibus quaeri, cujus Veritatem non norunt investigantes,
quia nihil in eo spei relinquitur. Suadeo quibusvis ergo perquirentibus, ut
cognoscant prius ejus quod quaerunt, veram existentiam, antequam quaerant: sic
eos laboribus frustrari non continget. Sapiens quaerit quod amat, nec amare
potest quod non cognoscit, alioquin Insipiens esset; Ex cognitione igitur natus
est amor omnium Veritas, quae sola viget in omnibus veris Philosophis. Thus He,
and again: Frustra laboratis omnes abditorum Naturae secretorum Indagatores,
cum aliam ingressi viam, Terrenorum virtutes per Terrena detegere conamini.
Discite igitur Coelum per Coelum, non per Terram, sed hujus per illius virtutes
cognoscere. Nemo enim ascendit in Coelum quod quaeritis, nisi qui de Coelo
(quod non quaeritis descendit, prius illuminet eum. Incorruptibilem quaeritis
medicinam, quae Corpora nedum a Corruptione transmutet in verum Temperamentum,
sed etiam temperata diutissime conservet: talem alibi quam in Caelo reperire
non poteritis unquam. Coelum virtute sua per invisibiles radios in Terrae
Centrum undique concurrentes, omnia penetrat Elementa, and Elementata generat,
fovetque Nemo in seipso, sed in sui simili, quod etiam ex ipso sit, generare
potest. Foetus etiam promiscuus utriusque parentis in se Naturam ita retinet,
ut in eo parens uterque potentia and actu sit reperibilis. Quis haerebit
amplius nisi lapis in Generatione Philosophica? Disce ex Teipso, quicquid est
in Coelo, and in Terra cognoscere, ut sapiens fias in omnibus Ignoras Coelum
and Elementa prius Unum suisse, Divino quoque ab invicem artificio separata, ut
and Te, and omnia generare possent? si hoc nosti, reliquum and Te fugere non
potest, aut Ingenio cares omni. Rursus in omni generatione talis separatio est
necessaria, qualem de te supra dixi fiendam, antequam ad verae Philosophiae
studia velum applices. Ex aliis nunquam unum facies, quod quaeris, nisi prius
ex Teipso fiat unum quod audisti. Nam talis est voluntas Dei, ut pii pium
consequantur Opus quod quaerunt, and perfecti perficiant aliud cui fuerint
intenti. Malae voluntatis Hominibus nihil praeter quod seminaverint, datur
metere: imo quod magis est, persaepe bonum eorum semen in Lolium, propter eorum
Malitiam convertitur. Fac igitur ut Talis evadas, quale tuum esse vis. quod
quaesieris opus. This is now the true Essential mystery of Regeneration, or the
Spiritual Death. This is, and ever was the only scope, and upshot of Magic.
But for your further Instruction ruminate this his other mystical speech.

Agitedum igitur anima mea, corpusque meum: surgite nunc, animum sequamini
vestrum. Ascondamus in montem hunc excelsum nobis oppositum, de cujus cacumine
vohis ostendam iter hoc bivium de quo per Nubem, and sine iumine locutus est
Pythagoras. Nobis aperti sunt oculi, tum praelucet sol pietatis and Justitiae,
quo duce non possumus a via veritatis deflectere. Volvite primum oculos ad
detram, ne videant vanitatem, antequam sapientiam perceperint. Videtisne
relucens illud, and Inexpugnabile Castrum? In eo se continet Philosophicus
amor, de cujus Font fluunt Aquae vivae quas qui degustarit semel, non sitiet
vanitatem amplius. Ab eo loco tam amaeno, suavique recta progrediendum est ad
amaeniorem, in quo Sophia moram trahit: de cujus etiam font scaturiunt Aquae
primis long faeliciores, quas qui gustarint inimici, pacem eos mire necesse
est: Eorum qui deveniunt eo plerique solent altius tendere, sed non omnes
ontatum assequuntur. Est locus ultra dictos, quem adire vix licet mortalibus,
nisi per Divinum numen ad immortalitatis gradum assumpti sunt: at antequam
introducantur, mundum coguntur exuere; caducae vitae spolio retento. Non est eo
cum pervenerint, quod amplius mortem timeant, imo potius eam indies
amplectantur suavius, quam in mundo quid unquam suave judicatum est eis amplexu
dignum. Ultra haec tria loca quicunque progrediuntur, ab hominum oculis
evanescunt. Quod si secundum and tertium Locos videre lubet, ascendamus altius.
En supra Chrystallinam primam arcem, aliam Argenteam videtis, ultra quam and
Tertiam adamantinam, Quar^^ vero non cadit sub sensum, donec ultra Tertiam
deventum sit. Hic est aureus perpetuae foelicitatis locus, sollie itudinis
expers, and omni repletus gaudio perenni. This is the pitch and place, to which
if any man ascends, he enters into Chariots of Fire with Horses of fire, and is
translated from the earth, soul and Body. Such was Enoch, such was Elijah, such
was Esdras, to whom this Medicine was ministered by Vriel the Angel. Such was
Saint Paul, who was carried up to the third Heaven; such was Zoroaster, who was
transfigured, and such was that Anonymus mentioned by Agrippa: I dipsum (says
he) and de se prodidit sapiens quidam, ita ut scintillantes Flaminae hinc inde,
etiam cum sono prosilirent. This I suppose; was R. C. the founder of almost
Christian, and famous society, whose Body also by virtue of that Medicine he
took in his life time, is preserved entire to this Day, with the Epitomes of
two worlds about it. Such Elijahs also are the Members of this Fraternity, who
as their own writings testify; walk in the supernatural light. Vt nobiscum

impossible est nos videre, nisi quando volumus. I know some illiterate
School-Divines will no sooner read this, but they will cry out with the Jews:
away with such a follow from the earth. Truly they are the men, Quibus and ego
nunc consulo, ne nostra scripta legant, nec intelligant, nec me^^inerint: nam
noxia sunt, venenosa sunt; acherontis ostium est in in hoc libello, Lapides
loquitur, caveant ne cerebrum illis excutiat. Let them not mind it, buy it not,
touch it not.

--,Procul hinc, procul ite Prophani.
Go on still, and proceed in your own corrupt Fancies, ut servetur Iustitiae
locus. Follow your old beggarly Elements, the Rudiments of this World, which
hitherto have done despite to the spirit of grace: which have grieved that
holy and loving spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the Day of Redemption.
But consider whiles you are yet in the flesh, whiles it is to Day with you, and
timely to consider, that God will use those men whom you revile for his Truth,
as witnesses against you in a Day when you shall have nothing to speak for your
Ignorance, unless you plead your obstinacy. Of a truth God himself discovered
this Thing to the First man, to confirm his Hopes of those three supernatural
mysteries, the Incarnation, Regeneration, and Resurrection: For I amblichus
citing the Egyptian Records with a Credendum est Arcanis sermonibus, has
these very words, Traditam fuisse Materiam quandam a Deis per beata Spectacula,
haec ergo illis ipsis tradentibus cograta est. And our former Christian Author
in a certain place speaks thus. Dubium non est quin Deus Antiquis Patribus
medicinam aliquam revelaverit, per spiritum sanctum suum qua tuerentur Carnis
Corruptionem and potissimum iis, cum quibus locutus est, and faedus inivit. Let
me tell you then that the Period and perfection of Magic is no way Physical,
for this Art Attingit solium Iovis, and Coelestia tentat.


In a word it ascends per lumen Naturae in lumen Gratiae, and the last end of
it is truly Theological. Remember therefore that Elijah deposed his mantle,
and past through the waters of Jordan before he met with the Chariots of Israel.
But as Agrippa says, Clausum est veritatis Armarium: The Scripture is obscure,
and mystical even in Historical passages. Who would believe that in the
History of Agar and Sarah, the mystery of both Testaments was couched, but that
Saint Paul himself has told us so? Gal. 4.22.
For it is written (says he) that Abraham had two Sons, the one by a Bondmaid,
the other by a Freewoman. But he who was of the Bondwoman, was born after the
flesh, but he of the Freewoman by promise. Which Things are an Allegory; for
these are the Two Covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to
bondage, which is Agar: For this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers
to Jerusalem that now is, and is in Bondage with her Children; But Jerusalem
from above is free, which is the `Mother of us All. I could instance in many
more such places, as that of the Royal Prophet, That the Dew of Hermon descends
to Mount Sion, which is altogether impossible in the literal Sense, for every
Geographer knows there is a vast distance between These two. But to return to
my former discourse: some Philosophers who by the special mercy of God
attained to the Ternarius, could never notwithstanding obtain the perfect
Medicine, neither did they understand it. I never met in all my Reading but
with Six Authors, who fully apprehended this Mystery. The first an Arabian, a
most profound, but exceedingly obscure writer, and from him I conceive,
Artesius borrowed all his Knowledge. The second a most ancient Christian
Anonymus, the greatest that ever was in point of Practice, for he ascended to
that glorious Metaphysicall Height where the Archtype shadows the Intellectual
Spheres. The other Four are famously known in Christendom. To instruct Thee
then, This Mystery is perfected when the Light in a sudden, miraculous
Coruscation strikes from the Center to the Circumference, and the Divine Spirit
has so swallowed up the Body, that it is Corpus glorificatum tanquam sol and
Luna splendidum. In this Rotation it does pass (and no sooner) from the
Natural to a supernatural state, for it is no more fed with Visibles, but with
invisibles, and the Eye of the Creator is perpetually upon it. After this the
Material parts are never more to be seen, Atque haec est illa toties decantata,
and sine scelere Magorum Invisibilitas. Verily this is the way that the
Prophets and the Apostles went, this is the true primitive Divinity, not that
clamorous sophistry of the Schools. I know the world will be ready to Boy me
out of Countenance for this, because my years are few, and green. I want their
two Crutches, the praetended modern sanctity, and that Solemnity of the Beard,
which makes up a Doctor. But Reader let me advise thee, if by what is here
written thou attain'st to any knowledge in this point (which I hold impossible
without a Divine Assistance) let me advice thee I say, not to attempt any thing
rashly: For Agrippa tells me, Quicunque impurificatus accesserit, superinducit
sibi Judicium, and traditur ad devorandum spiritus nequam. There is in the
Magical Records a memorable story of a Jew, who having by permission rifl'd
some Spiritual Treasures, was translated in Solitudines, and is kept there for
an Example to others. I will give thee the best Counsel that can be given, and
that out of a Poet: Orandum est, ut sit Men's sana in Corpore sano.


Thou must prepare thy self, till thou art conformable to Him, whom thou
would entertain, and that omnimoda Similitudine. Thou have Three that are to
receive, and there are three accordingly that give. Fit thy Roof to thy God
in what Thou can, and in what thou can not, he will help Thee. When thou
have thus set thy House in Order, do not think thy Guest will come without
Invitation: Thou must tire him out with pious importunities, Perpetual
Knockings at his Door,
Tears sullying his transparent Rooms.
Sighs upon sighs: weep mors and more,
He Comes.


This is the way thou must walk in, which if thou do, thou shall perceive a
sudden Illustration, eritque in Te cum Lumine Ignis, cum Igne Ventus, cum Vento
Potestas, cum Potestate scientia, cum scientia sanae Mentis Integritas. This is
the Chain that qualifies a Magician: For says Agrippa, Explorare de Futuris,
and Imminentibus, allisve Occultis, and quae hominibus divinitus portenduntur,
veridicas sententias, atque operari opera Virtutum communem Naturae
Consuetudinem excedentia, non nisi profundae and perfectae Doctrinae,
Integerrimaeque vitae, ac fidei est, non hominum levissimorum, ac indoctorum;
and in another place. Non poterit illa Dare, qui non habet. Habet autem Nemo,
nisi qui jam cohibitis Elementis, victa Natura, Superatis Coelis, progre^sus
Angelos, ad ipsum Archetypum usque transcendit, cujus tunc Cooperator Effectus
potest Omnia. This is the place, where if thou can but once ascend, and then
descend, Tunc ire ad Mundum Archetypum saepe, atque redire,
Cunctarumque Patrem rerum spectare licebit.


Then I say, Thou have got that Spirit, Qui quicquid portentosi Mathematici,
quicquid prodigiosi Magi, quicquid invidentes Naturae perrecutores Alchymistae,
quicquid Daemonibus deteriores Malefici Necromantes promittere audent, Ipse
novit discernere, and efficere, idque sine omni Crimine, sine Dei offensa, sine
Religionis injuria. Such is the power he shall receive, who from the Clamorous
Tumults of this World ascends to the Supernatural, still Voice; from this base
Earth and Mud whereto his Body is allied, to the Spiritual invisible Elements
of his Soul Ille Deum vitam accipiet, dovisque videbit Permotot Horoas, and
Ipse videbitur Illes. This, Reader, is the Christian Philosophers stone: a
stone so often inculcated in Scripture. This is the Rock in the wilderness; in
the wilderness, because in great obscurity, and few there are that know the
right was unto it. This is the stone of fire in Ezekiel; this is the stone with
seven eyes, upon it in Zachary, and this is the white stone with the new Name
in the Revelation. But in the Gospel where Christ himself speaks, who was born
to discover Mysteries, and communicate Heaven to Earth, it is more clearly
described. This is the Salt which you ought to have in your selves, this is the
Water and spirit whereof you must be born again, and this is that seed which
falls to the ground, and multiplies to an hundred fold. But reader, be not
deceived in me. I am not a Man of any such faculties, neither do I expect this
Blessing in such a great measure in this Life: God is no debtor of mine. I can
affirm no more of my self, but what my Author did formerly: Accipe me volo
velut Indicem, qui semper prae foribus, manens, Aliis quod Iter ingrediendum
sit, ostendat. Behold^ I will deal fairly with Thee; show me but one good
Christian, who is capable of, and fit to receive such a secret, and I will show
him the right, Infallible way to come by it. Yet this I must tell Thee, It
would sink thee to the Ground to hear this mystery related: for it cannot
ascend to the heart of the Natural Man, how near God is to him, and how to be
found. But of this Enough. I will now speak of a Natural Celestial Medicine,
and this latter is Common amongst some wise Men, but Few are they, who attain
to the Former. The common Chemist works with the common fire, and without any
Medium, wherefore he generates nothing; for he works not as God does, to
preservation, but to Destruction: hence it is, that he ends always in the
Ashes. Do thou use it cum Phlegmate Medii: so shall thy materials rest in a
Third Element, where the violence of this Tyrant cannot reach, but his Anima.
There is also a better way: for if thou can temper him with the Spirit of
Heaven, thou have altered him from a corrupting to a generating fire. Sublime
the middle Nature fire per Trigonum and Circulum, till thou come to a Breach
of Inferiors and Superiors. Lastly, separate from the Magical compounded Earth
that Principle which is called Terra Media, because it is middlemost between
the Vnarius, and the Binarius: for as it attaines not to the simplicity of the
First, so it is free from the Impurities of the Second. This is the true Petra
Chrystallina, a bright virgin Earth without spot or Darkness. This is Terra
Maga in aethere clarificata, for it carries in its Belly Wind and Fire. Having
got this fundamental of a little new world, unite the heaven in a triple
proportion to the Earth, then apply a Generative heat to Both, and they will
attract from above the Star-fire of Nature. Sic habebis Gloriam totius Mundi,
Ergo fugiet a Te omnis Obscuritas. Now because the Law of Nature is infallible,
and confirmed to the Creature by Gods Royal Assent, think not therefore there
is any Necessity upon God, but what he has inacted in General, he can repeal
in any particular. Remember who translated the Dew from the Earth to the
Fleece, and from the Fleece to the Earth. God bestows not his Blessings where
they are to turn to Curses. He cursed the Earth once for Adam's sake: take heed
he does not curse it again in thy work for thy sake. It is in Vain to look a
Blessing from Nature, without the God of Nature: for, as the Scripture says,
without Controversy the lesser is blessed of the Greater. He must be a good
steward, that shall overlook the Treasuries of God. Have therefore a Charitable
Seraphick soul: Charitable at Home, in being not Destructive to thy self as
most men are: Charitable abroad, in a Diffusive goodness to the poor, as many
are not. There is in every true Christian a spice, I can not say a grain of
Faith, for then we could work Miracles: But know thou that as God is the
Father, so Charity is the Nurse of Faith. For there springs from Charitable
works a Hope of Heaven, and who is he that will not gladly believe what he
hopes to receive? On the contrary there springs no Hope at all from the Works
of Darkness, and by Consequence no faith, but that Faith of Devils, To believe
and tremble. Settle not then in the Lees, and Puddle of the World, have thy
Heart in Heaven, and thy Hands on Earth: Ascend in Piety, and descend in
Charity, for this is the Nature of Light, and the Way of the Children of it.
Above all Things, avoid the Guilt of innocent Blood, for it utterly separates
from God in this Life, and requires a timely, and serious Repentance, if thou
would find Him in the Next Now for thy study, in the Winter Time thy
Chamber is the best Residence; here thou may use Fumigations, and spicie
Lamps, not for superstition, but because such recreate the Animal Spirits, and
the Brain. In the Summer translate thy self to the Fields, where all are green
with the Breath of God, and fresh with the Powers of Heaven. Learn to refer all
Naturals to their Spirituals, per viam Secretioris Analogiae: for this is the
way the Magicians went, and found out Miracles. Many there are who bestow not
their Thoughts on God, till the World fails them; He may say to such Guests,
Quum Nemini obtrudi potest, itur ad Me. Do thou think on Him first, and He will
speak to thy Thoughts at Last. Sometimes Thou may walk in Groves, which
being full of Majesty will much advance the Soul. Sometimes by clear, Active
Rivers, for by such (say the Mystic Poets) Apollo contemplated.

Omnia, quae Phaebo quonda^ meditante, beatus Audiit Eurotas: etc. So Have I
spent on the Banks of Ysca many a serious Hour.

It Is Day, my Crystal Usk: now the sad Night
Resignes her place, as Tenant to the Light.
See, the amazed mists begin to fly,
And the Victorious Sun has got the sky.
How shall I recompense thy streams that keep
Me and my Soul awaked, when others sleep?
I watch my stars, I move on with the skies,
And weary all the Planets with mine Eyes.
Shall I seek thy forgotten Birth, and see
What Days are spent since thy Nativity?
Did run with ancient Kishon? can thou tell
So many years as holy Hiddekel?
Thou art not paid in this. I Will leavie more
Such harmles Contributions from thy store,
And dress my Soul by Thee as thou do pass,
As I would do my Body by my Glass.
What a clear, running Crystal here I find?
Sure I will strive to gain as clear a Mind.
And have my spirits freed from dross, made light,
That no base Puddle may allay their Flight.
How I admire thy humble banks! Nought's here,
But the same simple vesture all the year.
I Will learn simplicity of Thee, and when
I walk the streets, I will not storm at Men,
Nor look as if I had a mind to cry,
It is my valiant Cloth of Gold, and I.
Let me not live, but I Am amazed to see
What a Clear Type thou art of Piety.
Why should thy Floods enrich those shores, that sin
Against thy Liberty, and keep thee in?
Thy waters nurse that rude Land which inslaves
And Captivates thy free, and spacious waves.
Most blessed Tutors! I will learn of Those
To show my charity unto my Foes,
And strive to do some Good unto the Poor,
As thy streams do unto the Barren shore.
'All This from Thee my Ysca? yes, and more:
I am for many Virtues on thy score.
Trust me thy waters yet: why, wilt not so?
Let me but drink again, and I will go.
I see thy course anticipates my Plea,
I Will haste to God, as Thou do to the Sea.
And when my eyes in waters drown their beams,
The Pious imitation of thy streams,
May every Holy, happy, hearty Tear
Help me to run to Heaven, as Thou do there.
This is the way I would have thee walk in, if thou do intend to be a solid,
Christian Philosopher. Thou must as Agrippa says, Vivere Deum, and Angelos:
reject all Things Quae Coelo dissimilia sunt, otherwise thou can have no
Communion with Superiors. Lastly, Unus esto^ non Solus: Avoid the Multitude,
as well of Passions, as Persons. Now for Authors, I wish thee to trust no
moderns, but Michael Sendivow, and that other of Physia Restituta, especially
his first Aphonisticall part. The Rest whom I have seen suggest Inventions of
their own, such as may pass with the Whymzies of des Chartes or Bovillus his
Mathematical Roses. To conclude, I would have thee know, That every day is
Annus Contractus: That every year is Dies extensus. Anticipate the year in the
day, and lose not a day in the year. Make use of Indeterminate Agents till thou
can fi^de a Determinate One: The Many may wish well, but One only Loves.
Circumferences spread, but Centers contract: so superiors dissolve, and
Inferiors coagulate; stand not long in the sun, nor long in the shade: where
Extremes meet, there look for Complexions. Learn from thy Errors to be
Infallible, from thy Misfortunes to be constant: There is nothing stronger then
Perseverance, for it ends in Miracles. I could tell thee more, but that were to
puzzle Thee: learn this First, and Thou may teach me the Last.

Thus Reader, have I published that knowledge which God gave me, ad fructum
Bonae Conscientiae. I have not Busheld my Light, nor buried my Talent in the
Ground. I will now withdraw and leave the stage to the Next Actor: Some
Peripatetick perhaps, whose sic probo shall serve me for a Comaedie. I have
seen scolds laughed at, but never admired: so he that multiplies Discourse,
makes a serious cause, Ridiculous. The only Antidote to a shrew, is silence:
And the best way to convince Fools, is to Neglect Them. Faelices Animae! Quibus
Haec cognoscere primu^,
Inque Domos Superas Scandere, Cura fuit.
Credibile est Illos pariter Vitiisque Jocisque
Altius Humanis exeruisse Caput.
Si Tu Iehova, Deus meus, Illuminaveris Me, Lux fient Tenebrae meae.

FINIS.
To his ever honored friend, the Learned Author.
SIR,
YOur book now finished. Let a shallower Pen
Ad these few drops, to your vast Ocean.
Not by my shaddowing praise, t'eclipse the glory
Of your high worth: this book must tell that story,
To truth-beleiving Souls; whose Eagle-eyes
Can penetrate these hidden Mysteries.
But you (thrice honored sir) my grovelling mind
Have raised to higher Pitch, to tell how kind,
How rare a friend, how dear, how choice a Treasure
My Fates have blessed me with, above the measure
Of vulgar thought: how this diviner ray
Of your bright soul, would fill with clearest day
The darkened world: did not earth-shadowing mist.
With thickest clouds, heavens influence resist
But who from envies sordid mire
Is washed, is clad in pure attire
Of innocence; a light shall see,
(unthral'd from errors Sophistry)
Will kindle that magnetic fire,
Which shall concenter, wild desire;
And fix the roving thoughts in one
Inseperate TRIVNION
Heel then disdain the slymie Earth;
A house too mean for nobler birth,
His heaven-rais'd soul, will then aspire
To bear a part in The Angels quire.
Dear so, fare well. Let seekers thirsty flames,
Refresht by these your soul-reviving streams,
Echo you Praise: with thankful elogies
Your ever-living name immortalize.
SIR, Your own beyond Expresses H. B.
