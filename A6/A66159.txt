His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am so sensible of the Readiness you have showed to Supply Me with Money for
the Carrying on the Wars I am Engaged in, that I am glad of this Occasion to
give you Thanks for your Cheerful Dispatch of that Matter, which was absolutely
Necessary for the Common Safety.

The best Return I can make to your Kindness is, to Assure you, That as far as
it will go, it shall all be Employed to the Purposes it was Given.

It is a very sensible Affliction to Me, to see My good People Burdened with
Heavy Taxes; But since the speedy Recovering of Ireland is, in My Opinion, the
only Means to Ease them, and to Preserve the Peace and Honor of the Nation, I
am Resolved to go thither in Person, and with the Blessing of God Almighty,
Endeavor to Reduce that Kingdom, that it may no longer be a Charge to this.

And as I have already ventured My Life for the Preservation of the Religion,
Laws and Liberties of this Nation; So I am now willing again to expose It to
Secure you the quiet Enjoyment of them.

The Spring draws on, and it being requisite I should be Early in the Field, I
must immediately apply My Thoughts to the giving Orders for the necessary
Preparations; Which that I may have the more Leisure to do, I have thought
convenient now to put an End to this Session.

Then the Speaker by His Majesty's Command said,

My Lords and Gentlemen, April next; And this Parliament is Prorogued to the
Second Day of April next.

FINIS.
