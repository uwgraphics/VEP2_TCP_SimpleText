By the King, A PROCLAMATION.
JAMES R.

FOrasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God lately to call unto his infinite
Mercy the most High and Mighty Prince, Charles the Second of most Blessed
Memory, the Kings Majesty's most Dear and most Entirely Beloved Brother, by
whose Decease the Authority and Power of the most part of the Offices and
Places of Jurisdiction and Government within His Majesty's Dominions did cease
and fail, the Sovereign Person failing, from whom the same were derived. The
Kings most Excellent Majesty in His Princely Wisdom and Care of the State
(reserving to His Own Judgment hereafter, the Reformation and Redress of any
Abuses in Mis-government, upon due Knowledge and Examination thereof) is
pleased, and has so expressly Signified, That all Persons that at the time of
the Decease of the late King His dearly beloved Brother, were Duly, and
Lawfully Possessed of, or Invested in any Office, or Place of Authority or
Government, either Civil or Military, within His Majesty's Realm of England and
Ireland, Islands of Jerzey and Guernsey, Sark or Alderney, or within His
Majesty's Colonies and Plantations in America; And namely, all Governors,
Lieutenants or Deputy Governors, Counselors, Judges, Justices,
Provost-Marshalls, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and all others in place of
Government, either Meaner or Superior, as aforesaid; And all other Officers and
Ministers, whose Interests and Estates in their Offices are determined, shall
be, and shall hold themselves continued in the said Places and Offices, under
the same Condition as formerly they held and enjoyed the same, until His
Majesty's Pleasure be further known, or that other Provision be made pursuant
to His late Majesty's Commission and Instructions to His Governors and Officers
of the Islands, Colonies and Plantations aforesaid. And that in the mean while,
for the Preservation of the State, and necessary Proceedings in matters of
Justice, and for the Safety and Service of the State; All the said Persons of
whatsoever Degree or Condition may not fail, every one severally, according to
his Place, Office or Charge, to proceed in the Performance of all Duties
thereunto belonging, as formerly appertained unto them, while the late King was
living. And further, His Majesty does hereby Will and Command all and singular
His Highnesses Subjects, of what Estate, Dignity, and Degree, they or any of
them be, to be Aiding, Helping and Assisting, and at the Commandment of the
said Officers and Ministers, in the Performance and Execution of the said
Offices and Places, as they and every of them Tender His Majesty's Displeasure,
and will answer the Contrary at their uttermost Perils. And further, His
Majesty's Will and Pleasures and Express Commandment is, That all Orders and
Directions Made or Given by the Late King, of most Blessed Memory, the Lords of
His Privy Council, or His Principal Secretaries of State, or other Legal
Authority, derived from His said Majesty in His Lifetime, shall be Obeyed and
Performed by all and every Person and Persons, and all and every Thing and
Things to be done thereupon, shall Proceed as Fully and Amply as the same
should have been Obeyed or Done, in the Life of the said Late King, His
Majesty's most Dearly and most Entirely Beloved Brother, until His Majesty's
Pleasure be further known thereupon.

Given at the Court at Whitehall, the Sixth Day of February, In the First Year
of His Majesty's Reign of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, and other His
Majesty's Territories and Dominions.
