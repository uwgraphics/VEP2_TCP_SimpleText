March 21.
Very joyful News from Ireland, read in the Honorable House of Commons, and
commanded to be immediately Printed.
Master John Hawkredge:
I Have written by the two last Posts, and now I have gotten a lame hand; but
having good News, it shall trot to impart it unto you. The last Saturday the
Lord Moore, and Sir Henry Tichbourne sallyed out of the Town, and fell upon the
enemies, and drove them out of their Trenches, and raised their siege, slew
about 350 of their men, and took many of their chief Officers, and have relived
themselves bravely, and took 150 of their Muskets, and a field full of Pikes,
we having lost, as some affirm, no men. Here are three of our Captains come by
Land, so that this News is true. Upon Monday our Forces went out, 4000 Foot,
and 500 Horse; they are already within 5 miles of Tredagh: by the way,
Lieutenant Colonel Read came in to our men, and submitted; if he had not done
it, he could not have fled: he is sent hither, and lodged in the Castle. I do
believe we shall now get good store of Corn out of the Country, which will
keep the price from rising. Our men are not expected home this week, pray God
keep them safe. Sir Phelomy o Neal was in the Battle, but was fain to fly; and
that was not like to serve turn, so he hid himself in a Furs-Bush.

With my true love, I rest: Your affectionate Friend, Raphael Hunt.

21 Martii.
It is this day Ordered, That this Letter be forthwith printed.
