MERCY TRIUMPHING OVER JUDGMENT OR, A WARNING FOR SABBATH BREAKERS.

Who for profaning the Lords Day was ^o;t miraculously stricken by the hand of
God, and ut^ly deprived of all my senses, for the space of 4 years; ^d now by
his great mercy (upon my hearty repen^^nce) being perfectly restored to my
former health, I as moved to set forth this ensuing Relation, as a testi^ony of
my thankfulness to God for his fatherly ^^astisement; and that all others by
my example, may ^e deterred from so heinous an offense as Sabbath-^reaking.

THE PROLOGUE.
BEloved Christians, before I was punished for my sins I followed mine own
ways, but now I desire to keep the commandments of my God; therefore I will
first relate unto ^u in Prose the manner of my chastisement, and what I
con^eive to be the cause wherefore I was afflicted. Upon the Lords ^ay or
Sabbath called Whitsunday, in the year 1624. I disobayed the Lord, and
violated that great day in Cursing, Swearing, Drinking, and keeping of bad
company, making an Alehouse, or a worse place my chiefest Sanctuary all that
day, from which time my memory was taking from me for seven weeks, that I
could never since remember any thing I did, ^eing eight days after that
offense committed in perfect health, and cannot conceive how I spent the next
Lords day, but on Trinity-monday riding to a wedding my horse slumbled, in a
plain green way, and cast me from off his back upon a stone, where (as I am
informed) was scarce another stone to be seen for half a mile, thence was I
carried home to the Priory of Brecknock as dead, and lay as one languishing for
a week, having a Physician and a Chyrurgion with me, but could not agree where
the fracture was, for outwardly there was no wound to be seen, nevertheless
the Sirgeon conceiving where the fracture was, (and that I might dye within
three days if the brain had not vent) immediately made an incision in the
Temples on the right side of my head, and cutting all the Vein in that place,
I bled by report six or seven quarts of blood before the veins stopped
bleeding, yet at the seven weeks end I was almost recovered of that desperate
wound, and my memory came to me again, but how, when, or where, I was thus
chastised, I know not, nor whether I felt any pain, when I was so grievously
wounded, and cured, I could not, nor can I remember, only my violating or
profaning the Lords day (before declared) I did, and do as yet remember,
which made me demand of the Surgeon and others that were about me, at the
seven weeks end, how long it was since Whitsuntide. And being commanded in a
dream to give an account of the Talent which was given me, since I repented
for violating the Lords day, I have made bold to present these my endeavors to
your charitable censures, not doubting but if the rest of my Talent were
manifest to the world it would be pleasing to God and man, most beneficial and
useful for this Kingdom, and fit for all young Clearkes, Scholars, and
Artificers, who understand not the Latin Tongue: which I wanted my self
before my Lord and Master corrected me.

And for these seaventeene years has me repriv'd
From death, to show the world Gods gift, this Story,
That Sabbath Breakers might behold my glory;
And Gods elect may see the reason why
I was so plunged in dreadful misery:
The truth it does declare at large, and how
Upon repentance God does mercy show:
This gift is his, which humbly I present,
In hope you will please t'accept the good intent
Of him who praise, Your honored days, May Zealous be, Eternally. His life
is yours While heart endures. THOMAS JONES.

A R I A P R I S E

To all true Christians, REAERS and others.
Since Scholars Toads and Spiders do commend,
I hope a Trades-mans Mite cannot offend;
Such venomous creatures Christians loath, or hate,
But this my Mite may prove more fortunate;
Yet Toads and Spiders serve God in their kind,
And does his will, whereto they are assigned:
Each creeping thing's ordained by Gods decree,
All things were made for man in some degree,
The Poison which makes vermin break, or swell,
Most precious is, Physicians best can tell:
Yet though they loathsome are to mortal eyes,
Within this world their shame and sorrow dies:
But man who sins on earth continually,
Death shall not end his shame, nor misery;
Then does his woe begin, for whom I pray,
Although they scorn and hate what now I say,
Then shall he know that God caused me to write,
The Sabbaths praise, (his gift) or Trades-mans Mite,
Then shall proud gallants wish would they had bin
As weak as I, or vermin void of sin,
Sin's therefore worse then death, then Hell, the Devil,
And of all sin, Pride is the greatest evil,
Pride makes men hate, and loath, and scorn the poor,
Yet shall a Trades-mans Mite strike every door,
Open therefore and let instruction in,
Observe Gods day with zeal, abandon sin,
Then in this world thou shall begin true joy,
For Death and Hell Christ Jesus did destroy:
Though Reprobates this Mite does discommend,
The gift of God my faith shall have no end.
Before I declare the manner of that fearful Acciden^ (which I conceive
happened to me for profaning the Sabbath of the Lord my God) I will recite
unto you the first Verses tha^ ever I made, which is the gift of God bestowed
on me since h^ Chastisement, containing a Dialogue between my Soul an^ Body.
And in the end of this Pamphlet, you shall see the Praye^ which I made when I
was deprived of my speech and Senses*

An Acrostick Elegy on my brothers name, made at the News of his death, my
descent, my own, and wives Anagrams, her descent, an Acrostick on her name,
made on the words she spoke on her Deathbed, I lamentted her death, an^
concluded with a thanksgiving and Prayer in Verse.

To which Book I have added an Antidot f^r troubled Soule^ or the fruit of
repentance, which a friend delivered unto me sin^ I was recovered of my
numnesse.

The Authors first beginning to make Verses, which strain came naturally to
him since his affliction.
A Dialogue between his Soul and Body. The Argument.
I Lay amazed when as I seemed as dead,
I thought my Soul was from my Body fled,
The wings did take, and through the Clouds did sore,
Which made me faint, then God I did implore,
To view my doleful, wretched, ghastly plight,
Most weak, as dead I seemed in mortals sight:
Then 'twas Gods will we should discourse in Verse,
^n these plain terms which now I will rehearse.
THE DIALOGUE.
SOVLE.
I Like a Pilgrim wandered to and fro,
Twixt heaven and earth, still crossed by man's dread fo,
To heaven I fled where blessed Souls remain,
The spirit from thence did send me back again
To earth, to thee from whom amazed I fled,
When gapsing on the ground thou layst as dead:
Then he who does by fear his servants prove,
Sent me again to testify his love.
BODY.
VVElcome sweet soul thrice welcome unto me,
We lived as one, I thought we did agree;
I wept, I mournd, since you did me disdain,
As dead I lived, which caused me to complain:
A sudden death I ever thought a curse,
But your departure made mine seem far worse;
Yet senseless did I live, I felt no pain,
Nor know I when, or how I did complain.
SOVLE.
When from earth's Center I did mount on high,
The damned Fiend pursued me instantly,
And there proclaimed what sins I did commit,
Which made me quake, and fear, and tremble. Yet
My faith, my hope and fear, together strave,
Faith hope embraced, but fear no rest could have:
Then did my chief commander this decree,
That I should redescend to earth in thee.
BODY.
GOds justice is severe, yet mercy found
Me out, when I lay tumbling on the ground,
And then I thought the immortal spirit said,
Christ died for him sad soul be not afraid,
Return, return, let nothing thee dismay,
Christ is thy life, thy health, thy help, thy stay;
The Trine that is blessed likewise those words he spoke,
When death perforce would thy possession take.
SOVLE.
THy faith, thy hope, has sent me back with joy,
Abandon fear, Christ will our Foes destroy,
Thy faith God saw, thy hope, thy heart, thy zeal,
When at his feet I humbly did appeal;
His sacred spirit showed thee then his will,
Cause on his mercy thou dependedst still;
Now see, behold, his love has sent me back
To thee, his grace therefore we shall not lack.
BODY.
AS heaven bright Sun does clear the misti'st morn,
So does my soul refresh my heart forlorn,
As heavenly dewes the parched earth do cherish,
So does my soul my heart, who thought to perish;
As Cynthias beams makes clear the sable night,
So bright my soul does shine, to me most light;
As heaven and earth obeys our God the chief,
So would my heart, his will be done in brief.
SOVLE.
THy hapless fall a happy chance did prove,
Thy faith, thy hope has gaind thy Saviors love
That sudden fearful spectacle most strange,
Declares thy faith, which scorns for fear to change;
God turns grief and fear to happy ends;
Most happy they who on his aid depends,
Such is thy faith, thy grief, thy fear also,
Which shows Gods love and mercy after woe.
BODY.
LO, where Gods dreadful stream did run, there grows
Faith, hope and zeal, his mercy it of reflows,
My shield is Christ, the Trinity I praise,
Whose love and mercy has prolonged my days;
With ardent zeal I will on God depend,
Sweet soul revive, my sorrows here shall end:
Let mutual love in us again be seen,
More strong, more firm, then heretofore has been.
SOVLE.
ALthough thy foul frail spotted sins did draw
Gods direful wrath on thee, observe his Law:
The Apostle Paul Christ's Gospel did deny,
The Prophet Jonas thought from God to fly,
Yet God in mercy did their sins forgive,
And they eternally with him shall live:
Therefore O Lord keep us from Satan's claws,
And hunger starve his guts and greedy jaws.
SOVLE and BODY.
HEre on the earth again in one we live,
Heavens grant we may no more offend, nor grieve,
Blessed be the night when fear did make her us part,
Blessed be that day when God did prove my heart,
Blessed be him who did Gods wrath appease,
Blessed be him who does my faith increase:
Bless me ye powers divine, (three one most wise,)
Make all my thoughts and deeds please thy blessed eyes.
A WARNING FOR Sabbath Breakers.
When as the All-seeing God of Gods did give
The Reins to me, I carelessly did live,
For on his great and Sacred day of rest,
His Sabbath made for man, which he has blessed,
I with the vulgar ran and did transgress
His chief command, which here I will express:
On Whitsunday that is past was sixteen year,
I grossly sinned, eschewing grief and fear,
For in the morn when from the bed I rose,
The world, the flesh, the Devil did dispose
Of me, and made me rave, disdain and swear,
My heart was vexed, which made me then forbear
To go to Church, to ease my troubled mind,
But in an Alehouse thought more ease to find,
Where I Tobacco took, and healths did drink,
Of Whitsunday I never once did think,
Nor of Gods will, that morn I thus did spend,
Till Divine prayers, and Sermon both did end;
Then in that Alehouse I my dinner took,
Gods word, his House, that day my heart forsook,
Yet after noone I to my Master went
To wait on him to Church, but my intent
Was crossed by sloth, for by the way I met
His spouse and him, and children all complete,
Then with his servants did I go along
Unto the Church, but from that zealous throng
I did depart, and I again did go
Unto those joviall lads, whose zeal I know
For my return did stay, among them there
I tippled still, Gods wrath we did not fear.
But when I asked if Evening prayer were done,
A Maid replied that Sermon was begun.
Then up we stood, a health we did begin,
A Frollicke called, no thought that day of sin,
But when we thought that Sermon was nere ended,
To Church we did repair, yet I attended
Still at the door, as if at Church I was
With zeal devout, but this I brought to pass
When from Gods House we all departed home,
I privately desired my Masters groom
To help me to a horse, that I might go
(...)
To visit her, whom he too well did know;
Which he with speed performed cause sick he lay,
There did I spend the rest of Gods blessed day;
But how or when I did return again,
Or where the horse I rid on did remain,
Or eight days after being sound and well,
What then I did, I never since can tell:
But by report of honest worthy men,
On Trinity monday next that followed then,
A special friend reposed trust in me,
To gain a License for him speedily:
Then to my friend the Register I went,
Who instantly petformed my intent,
He forthwith brought the License sealed to me,
^or which I paid to every Clarke his fee;
That Antidote I thought with speed to bring,
^o ease their hearts who felt blind Cupids sting;
^ut they who thought each hour, I stayed a day,
With all their friends began to lead the way:
Cause Evening came, and far they had to ride
Unto the house who for them did provide,
Then after them I rid with joy and speed,
To show my love I brought them what they need,
Their License 'twas, for which they long had staid,
The sight of it did make their hearts apaid;
When they the same received I went on still,
Till Phoebus light was clouded with a hill;
Then from them did I part, with many mo,
Who thought with me to Brecknocke back to go,
But mark the end, when we were at a stand,
A Glo-worme came and lighted on my hand,
Then did I ride before when it was night,
And bragging said, that God had sent me light,
With that I fell from of my horses back,
And on a stone, my scull I there did crack;
My friends amazed stood, I lay as dead,
No wound they saw, but inwardly I bled,
Which stroke my friends and fellows in a fear,
Some grieved and sighed, and some their hair did tear
Far from a house it was where I did lie,
What comfort could they have if I should dye,
Upon their hands? each to their friends did go,
And my disaster told, their fear, my woe.
Then God awaked a friend who heard the matter,
He ran with speed and brought me his strong-water,
His daughters followed him, they did repair
Where I did lie, thither they brought a chair,
His water did my heart and soul revive,
And made both life and death begin to strive
In me; within the chair was I laid,
And to his house I gently was conveyed;
And by relation there of many a one,
In half a mile was scarce another stone,
For to be seen, save that whereon I fell,
Yet where or how it was I cannot tell:
The Groom more bold and ventrous then the rest,
Unto my Master rid, and him possessed,
By break of day what dire mischance I had
Who rose with speed and came to me (most sad)
By that time came a Surgeon unto me
To view my corpse, but he no wound could see,
With him my Master stayed four hours and more,
And they with all my friends did God implore
To save my life, I scarcely then had breath,
Which they perceived, and gave me ore for death;
My Master then returning, news was spread,
What chance I had, and how I lay as dead:
Which made my friends lament, and fear, and grieve
Yet some that sudden news would scarce believe;
Most of that Country wide, and nere about,
Came thither to see, and to resolve their doubt,
My Master riding home again did find,
The Bayliffe of Brecknocke and the Townsmen kind,
To me they came, he met them by the way
And gave them thanks, they for my life did pray:
But sure said he, my Man is dead ere this,
He cannot live, or else I aim amiss.
Therefore you need not take such pains in vain,
Then all (as one) replied to him again,
We hope he will live as yet this many a year,
Yet home he went, and thither sent a biere,
To carry me upon when I was dead,
Whereon they placed me, underneath my head
A Scholar of mine, whom I did teach to write,
Thus I as dead did lie in doleful plight,
Then on men's shoulders was I carried home,
To Breknocke Priory, brought into that room,
Wherein I lay full four years and more,
A Covenant servant in that house before,
There I no sooner was laid down, but straight
A Surgeon, and Physician, both did wait
To view my mortal corpse, and rufull fate,
For fear least help and skill should come too late.
Two days they did consult and feel my head,
But disagreed; then I being almost dead,
The 'ternall just who kills, and does restore
To life made them consult no more:
And then the Surgeon found the Brain-pans rent,
Who an incision made to give it vent;
The fracture in the Temples he had found,
Where he did make a desperate bloody wound,
There he the veins did cut, then as a flood
Did issue thence, abundance of my blood,
In streams it ran, till I had lost my breath,
Then all men feared that I should bleed to death:
Yet after I six quarts, or seven did bleed,
My blood did stop, and I from pain was freed:
Then did my worthy Master send again,
To diverse Shires a Surgeon to obtain
Who had more skill, for I was grown most weak,
Languish I did, they thought I could not speak:
Thus I remained, a week (they say) and more,
In woeful case, impatience made me rore,
With me the Surgeon and Physician staid,
Expecting still to have more skillful aid;
Now when 'twas thought that I was almost spent,
A skillful Surgeon unto me God sent
Out of, Glamorganshire, from thence he came
By chance, John Nichols was the Surgeons name,
Who when he saw how ghastly I did lie,
He said I was past hopes to live, but dye
I should ere it were long, and thought it best
For to withold his skill, and not molest
My lingering life, which made my Master grieve,
And thence return; and say, he cannot live
If he no skill will show, he needs must dye,
But if his best he does, what remedy?
Then when my Masters grief and fear was past,
Unto the Surgeon he thus said at last,
Be pleased I pray to let him dye with skill,
That Is all I crave, for God must have his will.
The Surgeon then unto my Chamber turned,
Where many feared, and hoped, and wept, and mourned,
Then did he raise me up; small hopes I have
Says he, death I do smell, his life I cannot save.
Yet in the name of God he did begin,
To view the wound which I had for my sin:
God out of ill draws good, and who does know
If unto him the Lord will mercy show,
While that he breathes (says he) in hope I live,
That God in mercy will assistance give
To what I undertake, I must confess,
Ten thousand in the world are killed with less;
A stroke upon the Temples of the head,
Without a wound or fracture strikes men dead,
Therefore my brother Surgeon showed his skill,
Whose aid I crave, I shall applaud him still:
If in the head the fracture were not found
Before this time he had been in the ground:
In Brecknockeshire he lives, one of his name
Did live in Hereford, and died with fame,
He was a noted Surgeon of account,
Who to the seat of justice there did mount,
When I a Schoole-boy was, he then was Mayor,
And ore the City swaid in justice chair,
His name was Thomas Williams, there approved
For knowledge, wit and skill, of all beloved.
My Surgeon here is of that name, and nature,
Ordained of God, to make me live Gods creature,
And here on earth his servant would I be,
To blaze his love and mercy unto me,
This dreadful news to Hereford did come,
Which struck my brother, friends, and mother dumb,
Then she who never thought to visit Wales,
God did appoint to mount those hills and dales,
If any were within that sad short way,
She did not them respect, with delay:
She and my brother came with speed to see,
What dire mischance had happened unto me.
Oh! for my sins is was on God blessed day,
For which my Conscience makes me fast and pray,
His Sabbath I profaned sundry times,
But specially I grieve for all those crimes,
I did on Whitsunday (declared before)
Which caused the Lord to punish me so sore:
Wherefore with heart and soul I daily pray,
That I may truly keep his Sabbath day.
Lord make the world detest that great offense,
And let all Christians have that spiritual sense.
The Surgeon whom God sent began to try,
His hopeful skill, my wound he did unty,
The sharp incision made, he open laid,
Which made (my friends) the lookers on afraid,
Saying with fear, if more blood this man spill,
He needs must dye, yet does he dye with skill;
Then he replied, think you my skill so small,
What ere I do there shall not much blood fall
From him, my flesh he scared as he thought good,
And with his fingers still he stopped the blood,
My skin he flaid, and did raspe out that bone
Which in my temples cract upon a stone;
But by Gods providence and Surgeons skill,
A spoonful more of blood he did not spill,
The bone wraspt up it smeld egregiously,
And ore the brain he said three skins did lie,
^f each of them were putrified, then he
May linger yet, but long he cannot be
Alive, two tainte, where the third was not
With putrefaction stained, blemish, or spot;
Whereat my friends and Surgion did rejoice,
^n hope the Lord my God did hear the voice
Of some that prayed, yet they an alteration
Feared, which fell beyond man's expectation;
For God himself which did my flesh torment,
Revived my soul, and made my heart repent,
Then in the morn before the break of day,
The Surgeon sent to see how quiet I lay,
My loving friends who watched with me that night,
With courteous words again did him requite,
Surely said they the Surgeon hands are blessed,
For since his fall he took not so much rest:
The former Surgeon his attendance gave,
And all things brought which he desired to have,
Their care, their pains, their love did still abound,
They grieved, they feared, they hoped I mercy found
With God, and when they hopes of life did see,
They praised the Lord, and each one prayed for me,
Then did they view my dreadful wound again,
And order gave what meats I should refrain,
And when my grievous wound they view and dressed,
The Surgeon (God did send) made this request,
Cause I have many patients here, and there,
And my long absence might put them in fear,
I pray be pleased since fear of death is past,
That unto them again I now may have;
His brother Williams he would leave with me,
For under God he saved your life said he,
Had not he found the fracture in the head,
And an incision made, you had been dead
Before this time, therefore you live to God,
All comes from him, he smote you with his rod;
These words my Masters pleased my friends also,
Who said to him, you know your time to go,
Let us not hinder you, go when you please,
For God appointed you to give him ease,
After which time he two days more did stay,
But then with speed he seemed to post away;
The former Surgeon then his skill did show,
But how this wound I had I did not know;
For after I abused the Sabbath day,
I did remain in health a week (they say)
And more, but all that time I cannot tell
What ere I did, being then both sound and well,
Nor six weeks after I was hurt (alas)
Nothing I know, nor how it came to pass,
But by relation I will make it known,
Wherefore Gods judgment was upon me shown,
It was for mine offense seven weeks before,
Which still I do remember, but no more,
Saving those things I did on Whitsunday,
For then I know from God I went astray:
Within six weeks the Surgeon came again
To me, but then (they said) I told him plain,
I knew him not, wherefore he did reply,
Your brains I felt when you were like to dye,
Witness this bone which then I took from you,
My friends did say (alas) it is too too true,
He under God did save your life on earth,
And gave a being to your second birth;
Then as a child I did begin to go,
And senseless lived of grief, of pain, of woe;
My mother and my friends newly did grieve,
And prayed, that I so simple might not live,
They of a wedding speak, where I had been,
Wishing that I those parties nere had seen;
Whereat I mused, for I had clean forgot
The same, alas said I, I know it not,
Has not the Lord new molded me again,
And makes me now a spectacle for men
To gaze upon: but it is my makers pleasure,
Which I embrace, as worldlings do their treasure,
His Sabbath I profaned, not once, nor twice,
But too too often, for which I Sacrifice
These sighs of mine, my wound it fairly healed,
Which pleased my Surgeon well, yet he appealed
To God, he could not make me speak again,
Yet I but half a year did so remain,
Nay in a month or two my health I had,
Though weak and feeble, melancholy sad,
But then my Mother she my double nurse,
Departed home, whereat I grieved, far worse
To think my faculties from me were gone,
Which made me sigh and pray to God alone
For grace, and that he would be pleased to see,
My doleful case, my fear, infirmity.
In mercy then my memory he sent
Again, and gave me grace for to repent,
Then on the Sabbath day my thoughts did run,
I grieved, I mourned, to think what I had done
On Whitsunday before declared, (alas)
For which I fear the heavens brought this to pass
On me, and makes me to the world relate
The cause, that mortal man that sin may hate,
My heart condemns me still for that offense,
Cause seven weeks after, I had lost each sense,
My memory fayld in all things that I knew
Before that time, which I before did show,
Then in my grief I slept, and in my sleep
The Angel spoke that did my body keep.
Yet four, and thou shall be as thou have been,
Which made me hope at four weeks end to have seen
It come to pass, but that night in a Dream
The Angel spoke again, four years I mean,
With that I wak't, and praised the God of might,
Who in my sleep resolved my doubt that night,
Which made my heart rejoice, then as I prayed,
The spirit spoke again, and thus it said,
Gods sacred Book take thou and understand
His will, read it, and mark what he commands,
Do not despair, he knows thy judgement's weak,
Thy heart he knows, and what thy tongue would speak
Observe, and note his mercies manifold
To heinous sinners, our fore-forefathers old;
Which Book in time I read, in hope, in fear
Yet speechless I remained for half a year,
After that dreadful accident most strange;
But then my desperate thoughts to faith did change
Now when the Idol of vain pleasure, she
Whom on the Lords day I did ride to see,
Was of her sickness late recovered quite,
Her lewd temptation made my soul affright;
But then I found God was displeased likewise
With her, the Lodestone to my miseries,
For on his blessed day, his day of rest,
His word I loathed when she my heart possessed.
To her I rid, who likewise did profane
Gods day; for which (offense) she came to shame.
That year, she from those parts disgraceful fled,
And in another shire was brought to bed;
The child being borne, of it she was bereft
By death, ere since her native place she left,
Thefore I pray as God converted me,
Do so O Lord to her where ere she be:
Then from my mother speedily I heard,
My father in law lay sick, his death she feared,
Which made me strive to write my mind again
To her, and then I wished her to refrain
To grieve excessively if he should dye,
God would provide enough fot her and I,
After which time, eight days he lived (the most)
Then as they say, he yielded up the ghost:
Which when I heard I grieved, yet then
I thought that God did look on me again,
And for my mothers good this chance befell,
That after ages may this Story tell;
When she was married to that second man,
I then being Prentice from my Master ran,
Because I grieved at her unluckie fate,
I feared her choice would prove unfortunate,
Which soon did come to pass: his gains did slip
Still through his hands by too often suretiship,
Which made my mother vex, she wept, she grieved,
Yea small content she had while here he lived:
Wherefore this dire mischance the Lord did send
To me, that she in Wales might me attend,
But when to Hereford she was returned
Within eight days she for her husband mourned,
Whose unexpected death perplexed her heart;
But then Man's chief protector took her part;
On her my thoughts did run, I could not rest
Until she yielded to my small request;
Which only was that she would live with me,
The which the powers divine did first decree.
With me my fathers name she had again,
'Cause I her son as husband did remain,
Two years being past and gone in hope I lived,
At Bath to gain my speech, for which I grieved,
Which made me often to be vexed and crossed,
For all my faculties and speech I lost;
At Bath I stayed nine days in expectation,
Not as brave gallants do for recreation,
But I with Faith and hope my time did spend,
Then as from Bath I rid, at the Towns end
My horse did stumble at a heap of stones,
Whereon I fell, there might I break my bones,
My foot within the Srirrop hung to show,
My life, my soul, my all to God I owe,
He made my horse afraid to stir or move,
From thence, until my foot I did remove
Out of the Stirrup then my friend came in
And held my horse, who saw that I had bin
Deliv'red safe from harm, but fearful sad,
Which made me think upon a dream I had,
Two years before, my heart did then perceive
God might my brains dash out, and me bereave
Of life; because I did mistrust that he
At four years end would make me be
As I had been, Lord pardon me for it,
And I shall wait until thou think it fit
To make me sound, yet I in Bristoll stayed
At that new well, till I was there afraid
Of Gods all-seeing power, then did I grieve,
Because my faith would not a dream believe;
And I returned home again with speed,
Where for my secret sins my heart did bleed,
Then did I call to mind what God had pend,
There I observed Gods mercies has no end;
(Made known by's Prophets and Apostles grave)
Which did increase my faith, and comfort gave,
To me, yea there I marked what fearful sin,
Our forefathers did too too much run in,
Gods mighty wrath they often did provoke,
Yet soon it vanished as the Airy smoke:
But most severe he has been unto those,
Who did his Sabbath break when they might choose,
Witness the man who for a small offense
On Gods blessed day, death was his recompense,
He only gathered sticks to serve his need,
But from neglect or sloth it did proceed;
God seven days did make, and did exempt
But one for his own use, now in contempt
If man abuse his Sabbath which he blessed,
And from his worldly labors will not rest.
Or if we lewdly spend the Sabbath day,
Or carelessely his sacred will obey;
Or if that day our duties we neglect,
For that offense we may the like expect,
But he that gathered sticks and I have bin,
Thus plagued, that others may abhor that sin.
Praised be God for it, though I have been
Ere since perplexed in mind; yet has he seen
Me daily on my knees for mercy praving,
And with repentant tears always am saying,
O Lord, my God, my faith, my hope increase,
My weak petitions grant, when thou shall please:
Yet all those faculties which I enjoyed,
For seven years, the Lord my God annoyed.
But I with faith and hope did always pray
Unto him still, whose mercy does o'resway
His justice great, for in all ages past,
Gods dreadful wrath did but a moment last:
And his chastisement which in mercy fall,
The greater blessings do attend them all,
Witness the Thief that dyed with our Savior,
His faith upon the Cross, his last behavior,
Made him with Jesus Christ to live for ever,
And with the Saints he Lauds The Almighty giver
Of Heaven and Earth, of joy, of Peace, of Rest,
(The only man that at his Death was blessed)
Now seeing in mercy God chastised me,
With faith I hope, my life was his decree,
(He turned my tears to smiles, and in my sleep
The Spirit that spoke true promise then did keep)
For long before the time was at an end,
A married wife from London God did send,
Unto her husband who in Brecknocke lived,
Where he with sickness was long vexed, and grieved,
Now in this second M^trymoniall knot,
Gods love and mercy shall not be forgot,
For when the Sick-mans means was almost gone,
It was encreast (past hopes) by God alone,
Who made his wife return to ease his heart,
And from her gold most freely she did part,
She travailed, far and near, by day, and night,
To gain Physicians aid if that she might,
No cost she spared, no physic did he lack,
But all in vain, for death at crushed his back,
Yet God did make their love again more strong,
Then ere it was, which death did cross ere long,
For Atropo's stole with his dierfull knife,
And suddenly did cut his thread of life:
Before his death she dreamed by her relation
Unto their friends, beyond man's expectation,
She being with child was often sick with fear,
Then in a dream her Uncle did appear
To her, and to her comfort thus he said:
Think on Christ Jesus, be not thou dismayed,
On wednesday thou shall ease and comfort have,
But when she waked the man was in his grave;
In dust and ashes he was long before,
For he had then been dead six years and more.
Her husband being in tomb'd within the earth,
Two children strove in her to have their birth,
Then two months after upon Friday night,
Strong throws and labor did her soul affright,
Yea day by day she was in mortal pain,
Until that hopeful wednesday came again,
The Midwife and her friends this counsel gave,
To cut her womb, that she her life might save,
But she replied, nay, God forbid that I,
Should rip my womb, no, rather let me dye;
But on the wednesday morn that followed next,
Her grief encreast, and she was more perplexed,
Then from her womb a sweet girl there did spring,
Which did increase her faith, not fear deaths sting;
Yet then her throws increased, she had more pain,
Till from her womb a dead child sprung again,
Which was a boy, the girl on earth did live
Eleaven days. Then Christ her soul did give
To God, and all her friends with one accord,
Did humbly praise the eternal mighty Lord,
Who such a wonder on a stranger wrought,
The like was never seen in Wales it is thought,
God saved her life past hopes, and made her know
The day, that his great mercy he would show
To her, her friends thus said, she was beloved
Of God, for God her faith and patience proved,
She was chastis'd to show that she was blessed,
God spared her life, her faith the heavens increast,
Her love, her care of him who caused her woe,
Does show her faith, yet she (they said) must do
The like (no doubt), Gods glory she must raise,
For which she lives, to gain eternal praise;
Cease doting Muse in vain thou setst her forth,
God knows her heart, let heavens make known her worth;
She being restored to her health again,
Among her husbands friends she did maintain
Her self, according to her rank and blood,
In modest sort, during her widdow-hood
She taught, to sow, to wash, to starch, to read,
Her love, her fame in diverse shires did spread,
From whence the Gentry did their children send
To her, her breeding they did still commend,
Her pains, her care, her love gave all content,
The heaven of heavens did know her true intent:
Then did she dream again as it was reported,
A Painter to her company resorted,
He gained her love, to him she married was,
But thought that it would never come to pass
When she awak't, but in the morning she
Did ask what Painters here in Wales might be,
Her friends replied, truly we know not well,
But in this Town there is one we all can tell:
This night said she, a Painter won my love,
A black haird man, of him I did approve,
But now the Painter I have lost, my love
Is God, who did my faith, and patience prove.
Then when she was grown strong, she did return
Unto that house where she began to mourn,
For her late husband dead, but when again
She came, my mother near her did remain,
Where they close neighbors for a twelve month lived,
And often discoursed, sometimes wherefore they grieved,
My mother finding her most loving, courteous kind,
Of good conditions, and a zealous mind,
They both were intimate, and lived together
More dear then neighbors; for I knew not whether
Greater affection bore unto each other:
Then for her kind respects unto my Mother,
In commendations of her blessed name,
I these unpolisht lines did frame,
Mary a Virgin God and Man did bear,
Who conquered Death for those in thraldom were,
And you in name and nature blessed also,
For health unto the Virgins Son did go,
Your love, your faith, your hope in God your joy,
Brought you to him, who did death, hell, destroy:
Then when the Spirits promise did grow near,
Fresh hopes revived my heart, as shall appear,
My senses all benumbed, my drooping mind,
My tongue, my limbs did alteration find,
(For when my speech and faculties I lost,
Upon deep despaires tomb my heart was tossed)
And now the heavens who life does still presage,
Bound up my wounds, and bids me cherish age,
What cares, what fears then harbored in my breast,
Is known to him who matrimony blessed.
He made me go unto my Mothers friend,
That faithful widow whom she did commend;
Our hearts we linkt in one, we did agree
When that our Nuptial day should be,
Which now I note it was just four days before
The four years were expired and no more,
Upon which day she said, for you I tarried,
My life God spared for you, yet was I married
A twelve month since, unto an Artist kind,
Unto a black hair'd Painter, but I find
Dreams are but fantasies, they are seldom true.
Then I replied, that dream perhaps comes now,
For I a Painter am, or would be so
Though I of late no faculty could show,
And Doctor Laud the Lord Archbishops grace
Of Canterbury, being Bishop of this place
Saint Davies called, his Lordship promise made
That by Commission I should use that trade,
Throughout his Dioces, to beautify
The House of God, by his authority;
And though of late he be translated hence,
Your dream my hopes revive without offense,
Then when the next Lord Bishop there did come,
For to succeed the Lord Archbishops room,
That's now, in my behalf my Master spoke
To him, who nobly for my Masters sake
The like Commission caused to be made
For me, I his assistance had, and aid;
Then with my men Gods house I did adorn,
Although before I seemed as one forlorn,
But riding on the Sabbath day again,
My soul and conscience grieved, and did complain
Against my heart, God now the umpire is
Who will not suffer man to do amiss;
Then as I rid I thus resolved the doubt,
It is Gods house which makes me ride about;
Therefore I know I do not God offend,
With that my heart did faint, because the end
Was for my gain, and not to rectify
The house of God, which I did beautify,
Then my Commission close two years I staid,
Because my greedy heart made me dismayed,
My wife being then with Child, that night when she
Did hope by her account her Child to see,
At midnight she fell in a shivering fit,
Whom I awakt and asked the cause of it,
This night says she, when I expected ease,
My spirit or guardian angel, which you please,
To me did speak, whereat I was affrighted;
Think not (its said) that you shall yet be lighted,
On All Saints day God has decreed that you
Shall then be brought to bed, alas its now
Full six weeks hence, (says she) alas that I
Must so long yet endure this misery,
Yet it is Gods will she said, his name I Will praise,
His will be done, he has prolonged my days.
Then in the morn she heart of grace did take,
All grief, all fear distrust she did forsake,
On All Saints eve her labor then begun,
Sad gripes and throws in every part did run,
But by the break of day on that blessed morn
That followed next, a man child she had borne
Into the world, wherefore she praised the Lord,
Blessing his name who has performed his word,
With her, and said I most unworthy am
To know thy will or call upon thy name.
Then I another course of life did undertake,
And for a time all Painting did forsake,
Because a friend of mine was Sheriff there,
And his Recorder made me for that year,
I by that place experience still did gain,
There I with credit did my charge maintain,
My son by promise by my wifes relation,
God blessed with virtue, beyond expectation:
He being a twelve month old or somewhat more,
His mother dreamed again as heretofore,
When Mistress Prise of Brecknocke Priory lay
Most dangerous sick, expecting every day
The time she would this wretched life depart,
Cause all Physicians fayld with skill and Art,
To cure her long disease, yet if she played
With her young child, a voice unto her said,
She should be eased of each sick tedious fit,
But wished my household not to speak of it,
Least she should there be made a laughing stock,
For dreams are fancies which do most men mock:
Still Mistress Prise lay sick as heretofore,
After that time a month I know and more,
About which time my wife did ride to see
Her mother, friends and kindred, Gods decree
That morn she went from home one privately
Revealed her dream, but told it secretly
To Mistress Prise, who for my child did send
To see if after that her grief would end,
The child being brought to her, with him she played,
And him Physician called, but thus she prayed,
Lord if it be thy will that I shall live,
And have ordained this means I praises give,
Unto thy sacred name, for this thy love,
Bless this sweet child with grace, that he may prove
Thy Servant here on earth, and in the end,
Make his sweet soul unto thy Throne ascend.
After the child's being there she mended still,
And did recover her health, Gods sacred will,
His mother scarce a week from home did stay,
After the child with Mistress Prise did play,
But God was pleased before my wife came home,
To make my Mistress walk about her room:
Then God restored her to her health again,
And ever since in health she does remain,
She can declare the truth which I have Writ,
To show the gift of God I thought most fit,
I having now discharged in Brecknockshire,
The Shire-Clerks place, which held but for a year,
It pleased the Judges there my will to grace,
And did confer on me another place,
They made me an Attorney at th'Assise,
Which office there my fortunes did not rise,
Because my Clyants they were Welsh-men bred,
And when they spoke, I knew not what they sed,
Then I a Prentise took and thought it fit,
To teach him all things that was requisite,
But when I found he Welsh and English spoke,
I thought with him I should more profit make,
If he and I with my Commission went
T'adorne the House of God: then my intent
And purpose I began, yet still I prayed
My God, my Lord, who made my soul afraid,
T'assist my good desire, Lord send me skill
Again t'adorne thy house, he knew my will,
He was my aid, though he chastised me,
He makes me cautious of his blessed decree.
Though I did once profane his day of rest,
Henceforth I hope t'observe his Sabbath blessed,
For on that day within his sacred Book,
My heart and soul for profit there shall look,
His grace and favor I have found again;
He with his blessings does my life sustain.
Still he is pleased t'assist me with his grace,
Which does my mind content in every place,
Yet every day my sorrows did increase,
Because my special friends did still decrease,
Death strikes them here too fast, ah me I grieve,
To see strong Oaks cast down and brambles live:
Then when I left my Church-worke every night,
I still would take a Pen, and thus did write.
We Painters err to picture death still blind,
For I observe he sees the best to find,
But meagre death thy Dart has done them good,
Thrice happy they wherein thy sting has stood,
Thou art deceived, their souls to heaven fly,
Though in the earth their bodies rotting lie,
Thy ghastly pale grim face makes friends to weep,
When thy sharp dart makes friends in earth to sleep,
Yet naught thou can with all thy hate or love,
Save what is decreed by that three-one above,
Then let me spare to rave and be content,
He is commanded by th'Omnipotent:
He does command the world, and him also,
Therefore let us prepare with death to go,
Let those alas who too too often have stood,
More for the Church goods then the Churches good,
Repent and grieve for it with awful fear,
Praising his name who does his rod forbear,
And let those great ones next who seem most strong,
Can hardly offer right or suffer wrong:
Let them with humble hearts and souls confess,
That heretofore they weakly did transgress;
Let every one make privy search within,
And with repentance root out damned sin,
Let Us firmly love, yea with a tender heart,
All envy, malice, discord set apart,
Such sins as those, and others not much less,
Is the only cause of grief and heaviness,
It Was not their sins alone which bred our woe,
But ours with theirs, and many sinners mo,
We are the cause alas, as well as they,
For which our friends so soon do rot in clay,
We often speak fair and love is daily faind,
Gold some do make their God, ungodly gaind.
When men grow rich they then grow insolent,
Scorning the poor and harmless innocent,
Gods wrath we do provoke, he often does threat,
With bitter tears let us humbly him entreat
To save the rest, and turn his wrath away,
Oh! turn us Lord, I Am bold my self to pray,
For, for our sins, and for our wicked crimes,
Thou take away the godly oftentimes:
God takes from us in my conceit the best,
My faithful friends with death he did arrest;
Thus I my heart did ease at idle times,
With making such unpleasant doleful lines;
Six sheets of Paper closely did I write,
The more I grieved bewailed the more I might,
Of them I only here have given a touch,
To Critics ears I know its too too much:
Therefore I Will cease, and hold on my discourse,
In praise of God, which may perhaps seem worse
To them; when I had gone through Brecknockshire,
And Painted most of all the Churches there,
My Prentise did desire his friends to see,
And with his father rid to Mountgom'ry,
That day from Herefordshire a message came,
To me, (and said, that there God spread my fame)
I thither must make have without delay,
And there resolve a month or two to stay,
To teach young Gentlemen to write with speed,
Whom Doctor Rogers in his house did breed,
To them I went, where I did find such love,
As if the powers divine had from above
Decreed, that to my native place I must return,
And for the good of others am I borne.
My Prentise then returned to me no more,
Wherefore my Church Commission I gave ore.
Now was my first borne son on All Saints day
^ust five years old; and as my friends did say,
About that time, the day, the hour of's birth,
His blessed soul forsook this mortal earth,
Then on the morrow when I heard that news,
(...) came unto my house where I did use,
(...) Job like patient mind, and praised the Lord,
Not doubting but his mercy would afford
Me grace to be content, then did I write
And make this Epitaph, his fathers mite,
On All Saints day thou did draw vital breath,
On All Saints day God sent for thee by death
On All Saints morn it was five years since that time,
Thou first unto thy mothers papes did climb*
God called thee hence; twice all the Saints did show,
Thou wast a jewel which God himself did owe,
God did decree that all the Saints should bring
Thee to the earth, and fetch thee to their King:
Who so is borne to day and dies to morrow,
Loses few days of mirth but months of sorrow.
Then when some mournful days for him were past,
To Herefordshire again I did make have,
Unto my Scholars there, but by the way
I at a zealous house was forced to stay,
Whose sons that Doctor did instruct, and I
Their want in th'Arte of writing did supply;
And as I back returned home again,
At that religious house, I did remain
All night, and on the Sabbath day I went
From thence, (unknown) because I would prevent
The time, for riding to and fro so far,
My expectation it did seem to bar,
But when I came to them again I heard,
A mild discourse, which made my soul affeard:
Cause I again had trespast on Gods day,
For which offense I wept, and thus did pray,
Be pleased O Lord to make me recompense,
My weak desire and wilful ignorance,
With zeal devout, Lord shield me every where,
From bold presumption, grief, despair, and fear;
Then as through Hereford I often past,
The Free Schoolmasters, and his friends at last,
With many a Townes-man there did speak to me,
That in their City I sometimes would be
To teach to write. For in your native Town
Said they, where you once lived, your fame is blown,
Their kind persuasion soon impression took,
In me, for Wales I instantly forsook
And all preferments there, to Hereford
I came, whose Church and College will afford,
A pensive man true comfort in distress,
True food for souls and men in heaviness.
Now in this City can I scarcely gain
Sufficient means, yet do I still maintain
My self, my family, taxations pay,
And all God sends, to whom I fast and pray.
Grant me thy grace O God, contentment still,
Lord my ambition is to do thy will,
Thou know that is all the wealth I wish on earth,
Which is thy gracious gift (my second birth.)
My heart, my soul shall on my God rely,
His name I bless, I praise, I magnify,
Which is the cause that I this Mite have writ,
To show my zeal, but not to blaze my wit
Which is but weak, a Tradesman weak I am,
Whom Christ I hope has called to adore his name.
THE PRAYER.
O Lord God everlasting, Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, glorious,
holy and merciful art thou in all thy works, of thy goodness and mercy thou
maa'st me of the dust of the earth, breathing in me the breath of life, to the
intent I should continually serve thee, but I a miserable and wretched sinner,
following the steps of my first parents, transgressed thy commandments, and
have been often inveigled by the world the flesh and the devil to break thy
Sabbath, for which my conseience persuades me (by many infallible reasons) that
thou in mercy have afflicted me for the same, yet upon my weak humiliation
thou wast pleased (after thy chastisement) to comfort my heart with the
remembrance of thy fatherly love declared in thy sacred word, for thou causedst
thine only Son Christ Jesus to descend from thy throne of Majesty into this
vale of woe and misery, who became as it were a sinful man and suffered the
most shameful death of the Cross for my sins, and for the sins of all
Mankind, he being spotless and righteous; nevertheless I still erred and
procured thy wrath and indignation against me, yet in mercy thou only afflicted
sime for my sins and offenses, piercing my conscience for profaning thy
Sabbath, for which thou might justly have consumed me, and rooted me out
from the face of the earth, but thy mercy overswayed thy justice, for thou
sparedst my life when all that saw me or heard of me said I was either dead, or
past hopes of recovery, verifying in me the Apostles words, This is the Lords
doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes, and what thy Servant David said is true
in me, Lord thou have chastised and corrected me, but have not given me over to
death; therefore my heart and soul and all my vital spirits shall magnify
thy great name, beseeching thee for Jesus Christ's sake, if it be thy blessed
will and pleasure, to restore me to my former stoength, speech, health, memory
and faculties, that I may hereafter walk faithfully before thee, all the days
of this my earthly pilgrimage, doing, and performing diligently, (with faith
hope and zeal) those things which thou command me, banishing from my heart
presumption and despair. Lord forgive me my former sins and iniquities which I
ungraciously (and partly through ignorance) have committed against thee. Thou
know O God my simpleness, and what I need, better then I can ask or crave,
therefore in all humility I refer my will to thy blessed pleasure, beseeching
thee O most gracious Father to continue, multiply and increase thy love and
favor bestowed on me, that I never offend thee in thought, word, deed, or
consent, and when it shall please thee to call for this my wretched body out of
this miserable world, that my Savior may present it spotless unto thee
amongst thine elect, notwithstanding the wickedness of my corrupt nature: which
blessing I humbly beg at thy merciful hands for the merits of thy only Son
Christ Jesus my Savior, redeemer, and advocate O immortal, eternal, and
everliving God from the bottom of my heart and soul I bless magnify and
adore thy sacred name, beseeching thee again and again for Jesus sake, to
accept of these my humble petitione, although my hand is not able to write, nor
heart conceive the praises due unto thee, neither can any tongue declare thy
love, goodness, and mercy Wherefore I conclude this my humble desire, praise, and
thanksgiving with that absolute prayer which thy Son my advocate Jesus Christ
has taught us saying, Our Father which art in Heaven; etc.

FINIS.
