To the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
I Have carefully, though not curiously, disrobed that worthy Knight, and
excellent Doctor in Physic and Surgery, Leonard Phioravant out of his
Italian Vesture, and put him into our English habit, that such an excellent
Piece may not lie cloystered in the Precinct of one Principality, but that our
own Nation may participate of the Honey, this Laborious Be has brought to his
Hive: If all relish not at the first gust, the fault is not in the Work, but
their judgments that understand him not, nor the jewels presented unto them.
Avicen King of Arabia in the Arabic, Hippocrates and Galen in Greek, and
Pliny and Celsus in Latin; besides many English and French, have testified
their love to their native Countries, by publishing in their own Languages such
rare Treasures as these. Nor fear I detraction from any for these my Labors,
unless it be from some runnagate Varlets, that carry all their cunning in a
Chirurgians Box in their Pockets, and their learning in a Cap-case behind at
their backs; who through Ignorance, neither regarding the quantity, nor quality
of those excellent Medicines, abuse, and sophisticate them in making them up,
but this must be obtruded unto the Men, not the Medicines; for prevention
whereof hereafter, that honorable Society of London Physicians have chose out
a Chymick Artificer, whom they have placed in their own College, and over whom
they have set discreet, and learned overseers to oblige the public for their
care to their Medicines hereafter. So wishing you the happy fruition of health
is intended you by these labors; I rest,

J. H. W. J.

To the Reader.
HAving taken upon me to write a brief Treatise of Surgery, in the which I
will write the mere verity, and that with as much brevity as may be, because
the truth uses but little room, for the Philospher writes, that the truth is
such a light as all men do hide, covering it with diverse abuses, as the Poets
many times do; for when they write one of their tales, they go about to hide
it, and thus to our purpose: Those that write great volumes cannot choose many
times but hide the truth; for in much matter there enters both good and bad,
and therefore I will write no more then is necessary, declaring what Surgery
is, and in what order it should be used with all his accidents, showing what
Wounds are, with Imposthumes and Ulcers, how they engender, and when they are
ingendered, how to cure them and dissolve them: A discourse which will please
many, because it is only truth, and of great importance: Let every one
therefore know, that Science with experience do appear to be one thing, and at
this present every one is certain thereof, that the experience of Physic as
well as of Surgery, cannot be good without Science or Method, as a man may
term it; but I say, that Experience is better then Science in these two Arts,
that is, in Physic and Surgery, for Science only shows the virtue, the
which may be done with Practice that has no Theorick; of which I have written
sufficiently in my Caprici Medicinale, and that this which I write is truth, I
will prove it, for I say, that none can help with the only Method, but always
it is necessary, that there be some experience or practice, therefore those
that do delight to understand, let them follow this my short Treatise, in the
which I will treat of things most necessary to be known, and will show how
easy it is to work in that Art, declaring all the difficult matter, so that
every one may see and perceive it plain, and afterward I will show how to make
many new Medicines, as well for Wounds, as for the other sorts of sores, which
have not been used neither of old Doctors nor of new; the which Remedies are of
such virtue and strength, that the world will wonder at them for their notable
quick working, and hereafter I will write what Surgery is.

Short Amimadversions upon the Book lately Published by one who styles himself
NOAH BIGGS, Helmontii Psittacum.
Friend,
YOu set a bigg Sail to a little Vessel: I believe your Arc does not like
Noah's, contain all the vitality of Rationals, and Sensibles.

You write Page 205. concerning Mastication. Seeing all Aliment ought to pass
into a liquid Reduction, or tendance to Chilificative mutation, or Alimentall
conversion, therefore Mastification is to be highly commended.

You have like the great Fish, that swallowed Jonah, received in Van Helmont,
though not digested him; and the same tax may pass on you, which sometimes did
on a Noble Courtier, devorasti, non edisti. It was the judgment of Doctor
Charlton; a Learned Physician, a favourer of Van Helmont, that he had a better
Faculty, Evertere opiniones Veterum, quam extruere, and stabilire Novas.

When was ever Practice amongst the Physicians so narrowly confined, as they
kept themselves to one Author? Do not some of them follow Minfect, others
Hartman, others Grulingius, others will have their prescriptions made after
Quercetan, Faber, or Poterius, some after Begvinus, Millius, Billich,
Burgravius, Becherus, or other Authors; And some disgust all, which are not
Paracelsian, or accord with Basilius, Valentinus his Master, and are pleased to
practice after their Medicines, with the additions of their own Experiments,
out of their reading, and judegment on their several Authors. I would gladly
know who ties himself to Sennertus, Riverius, or any one Modern Author, as if
universal Learning were contained in the sphere of one Microcosme: Yet you are
so much for Helmont, as if he were the great Luminary of the World. I confess,
I honor Van Helmont, but if you do no cures out of the tract of his Method, I
believe you must study more knowledge in his Medicines then barely how to
Translate them, or otherwise you will fail in the honor you aspire unto, and
from teaching others, come your self to learn from those you unworthily
vilify.

You say Page 12. The Schools are ignorant of the Quiddities, and Dihoties of
things, do you your self understand either your own, or the essence of the
lowest inferior Animals? Page 15. Why did you not by the golden Trident of
Chymicall Theoremes, whom as a Lady of Honor you have courted, devoutly
kissed, and profess your strict observance to, becalm this Sea of distraction?
And as you say, Page 16. write in that, in which there is no beaten path, which
you think most honorable, because he that leads has this advantage above
others, if others follow him, he has the glory of the first undertaking, if
not the excuse of prejudice: But had not Van Helmont traced out this Path to
you, I could think you would have acquiesced to the ancient opinions, and not
have aspired to be reckoned amongst the public Benefactors of Civil and
Humane life.

Page 35. You have a jerke at Bartholomeus Carichterus, but I believe your own
learning and judgment will hardly bring you to be a Physician to so great an
Emperor as Maximillian the Second. For your threefold Character you give of a
good Purge, Page 80. I hardly believe your Patients will be so happy as to meet
with such from you. The London Dispensatory has variety of medicines, some
following one Author, and some another, for which purpose it was so enlarged,
as thought necessary in respect of the several variety of judgment, and
practices of our Modern Physicians.

You say, Page 11. reading is no way conducible to knowing: If you had never
read Van Helmont, you had never written in this style. You say, Page 11. The
disease known is not the half way to the cure, but if you know not the
disease, I conceive you would hardly, or blindly come to the cure of them. You
write, Page 15. The Physicians like to the self-conceited Laodiceans, while
they presume they keep the keys of the Science, they neither enter themselves
into the Closet, and inner Parlour of Nature, nor admit, willingly, others that
would. But observe your own incircumspection and levitie: For had you perused
their Pharmacopoea, published 1650. A Capite ad Calcem, you could not have
committed so gross an error, (nor did their former want prescriptions of
Chymick medicines) but if you please to cast your eye on it, from Page 187. ad
finem Libri, you may see many good Chymick preparations, besides the multitude
of other prescriptions, which are left to the judgment and choice of Ingenious
Practitioners, to fetch out of other Chymick Authors.

And had you but cast your eye on their careful expression, in fine
Pharmacopoeae, you would have been silent, or written more temperately, which I
must expose to your knowledge in their own words.

Ne nos (Amice Lector) in hac operis suscepti meta, simulque cum calamo nostro
curam deposuisse tui videamur, certior ut fias, cupimus, nos etiam saluti tuae,
publicaeque utilitati, nihilo segnius invigilare, adeoque officinam Chymicam,
seorsum in horto Collegii erigendam curasse, artificemque Idoneum accersivisse,
eidemque instruendo and corrigendo Collegarum peritissimos destinasse, ut
medicamenta, quanto efficaciora, tanto cautius, quanto difficilliora, tanto
diligentius, quanto pretiofiora, tanto sincerius componerentur. Denique eidem
suffragia nostra, locumque ac lucrum omne gratis dedisse, and concessisse, ut
ad tam singularem benevolentiam promerendam pari honestate impelleretur. Tu
Quisquis es, nobiscum fruere, vove and vale. Now judge of the condition you
stand in with knowing men.

Has not Rome, France, Augusta, Collen, Amsterdam, and other Nations their
several Pharmacopaeas? Must all be drowned, if Noah, your petty Arc hold them
not up. Page 107, and 108. Concerning Glisters, that they never reach to the
Ileon, or have any nourishing quality.

Bartholinus in his Physical exercitations, has a tract against that opinion;
where, by his authorities, experiments, and reasons, you might be somewhat
staggered, if you do not jurare in verba Magistri: against whom Doctor Heers,
in his tractate de Fontibus spadanis, casts forth bitterrer language then I
will throw upon you; yet I desire you to remember what Doctor Metcalfe of
Cambridge not long since said, on the censures of some nimble-tounged Scholars
on the grave Academians: You young men think us old men fools, but we old men
know you are so. And be not offended that I advise you, that would be held
Magistrum in Artibus, to study also to be Magistrum in Moribus. But I will
conclude with these two Grammar verses, Add quod ingenuas dedicisse fideliter
Arts
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse (...).
And must tell you, for your rash extravagant censures, you are worthy to be
transmitted back to the College Censors, or Deanes.

W. I.

FRIEND CULPEPR,
I Had thought the sober animadversions were given you lately upon the
publishing of the translation of Papius, would have reformed your insolent
Language you formerly used against your bettters; but I see Quo semel est
imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa diu. The Vessel cannot put off the first
foetid smell it received, for in your disponsatory Epistle, and in these of
your Midwifery with a great deal of railing, and nonsense, as if it were
Cuckow-moneth with you, you chatter still in one note, against Priests, and
Physicians, and cry out, We are Prisoners, and kept in darkness, and who are
our Jaylors but Scholars: Out of which by your selfe-conceited omniscience you
undertake to deliver them, from the unsufferable ignorance men and women are
now trained up in, and teach them a desperate unwarrantable practice. And this
is done, you say, to uphold a Company of Lazy Doctors, most of whose
covetuousnesse outweighes their wits, as a Millstone outweighes a feather, etc.
I cannot but smile at your nonsense similitudes; but I shall account you an
exact Mathematician, if you can tell me how many feathers would counterpoyse a
millstone, but that task would make your brain as light as your tongue. I
allwaies conceived men were bred up in callings, to enable them in future to
preserve themselves and their Families, and in their professions to be
serviceable to the Commonwealth, and might lawfully live by them. I pray, why
do you translate but to live by it not agere stultum, and Zoilum? I wonder
whether gain put you not at first (when other Trades failed you) to write, or
rather translate Physic in your mother tongue: and it seems you rather know
how to translate Latin, then transfer it into a Sentence, as you do legere,
and non intelegere, neglegere est. But I will admit the excuse, it is the
Compositors overfight. You say, If any want wisdom, let him ask it of God,
not of the College of Physicians; and yet you undertake to teach them; for you
say, You intend to lay down some Rules, whereby a man may as well prevent a
sickness before it comes, as remedy it when it comes, and that you will write
of the preservation of man, even from his conception to his grave: a great
undertaking, and I believe too high Mr. Culpeper for your reading, and will
scarce be gained out of your translating some fragments of Galens, and some
pieces of modern Anatomy. You say, Physicians of our times keep our
understanding in as great bondage as Pharaoh kept the Hebrew Midwifes bodies, I
pray did the other Physicians before them walk in your tract? but why
transcend you the text with your foolish additions? what bondage do you read of
either the Egyptian Midwifes, or women suffered under Pharaoh themselves,
though the males were overcharged with rigor. You confess God has given you
some little sparks of Knowledge, and you will not wrap up your talent in a
napkin and bury it in the ground: Truly I think you need not hide any you
have; and for that of railing you will not. You desire others to judge
charitably of you, for Charity and Honesty you say always walk hand in hand
together, and think ill of no man: If your own rule be your judge, you are
neither Charitable nor Honest: you say in your Epistle to the Reader, The water
may be muddy in the stream, which is clear in the Fountain, but yours is clear
in neither: You say, The Translators have given us a Translation of the Bible
(such a one as it is) but have given all the proper names in Scripture in pure
Hebrew words in an English Character, and yet all the Scripture was written for
our instruction: Had you been as well versed in the Translations, as you are in
rash Censures, you might have found the Hebrew words exactly interpreted,
adjoined to many translations: not conceived so necessary to be joined to all;
because whosoever understood the language well (as God be praised many of our
Nation do) they needed not that key to open it to them: Besides you say, whole
Sentences in Scripture are so translated, that it would make a man sick to see
them, I believe you mean read them; but why quoate you not the places, as you
did before, the fourth or fifth first Chapters of the Book of Chronicles. If
you had said some sentences of Scripture are omitted, or perverted, you might
justly have taxed the lazy ignorant Printers, both here and beyond the Seas,
in these times, that have not had so much care of their Presses in putting
forth those sacred Books, as your Printer has had of yours. You say, The
first virtue a Child aims at so soon as it is born is knowledge. I would
gladly learn what Virtue is native; I conceive them dative, and that scientia
is rather acquisita, then nata, if it be true nemo nascitur artifex; or the
Platonic opinion hold, man is Tabala rasa, capeable of impressions, but has
none written in it. The desire to be as Gods was the cause of our Parents first
fall, knowledge of good and evil, but the knowledge of Good comes only from
God, the Fountain of goodness, in whose stream you must be dipped, before you
desert your pride, and self-love, and put on humility. You say, Had not the
Priests formerly absconded the mysteries of Truth from us, Sermons would have
been so cheap that they would have been cried about streets for three
halfpence a dozen; You might have done well to have expressed your self,
whether you meant our Priests, or the Roman, for I dare justify a few of the
Sermons of our late reverend Divines, as Andrews, Hierons, Holsworth, Adams,
and many others which I could name, are of far greater worth and esteem, then
your dispensatory, unless with some ignorants and women: Though you undervalue
Sermons at a less rate then sparrowes, when your learned labors are prized at
five or six shillings a piece. For Gardener, I think every good Christian
abhors his name and life; and I know no man desires to die his death. Giant
proportions have often Pigmy conceits, but our gentleman's fancy far
outstrips. Bayards leap, who brings Dianas Image from Ephesus to jumpe to
England at one leap, where silver shrines must be made for her still. It is a
Riddle to my understanding, where the Image and Shrines are; and I should be
glad to see you clear that passage, of the Image fell down from Jupiter, and
that of the silver shrines from impertinent nonsense, and show how you can make
them correspond with our Physicians. It Is true you put an effigies Image, or
sculpture before every book you write; I conceive you mean not your own, I
confess I have that in your Book at Amen Corner, but for your Silver smith and
shrines you write of, I hardly believe you will have one, unless the Midwifes
you flatter so, make you one. For Amen Corner, I persuade my self, it is a
formidable place to you, for fear of dissection, for you never durst hitherto
venture your approbation there before the Doctors for your sufficiency in your
trade you were bound to, and some-while brought up in: And for your judgment
in Physic, I know you dare not come thither to the test, though you rail
against them. Pray let me not trouble your weak brains with a relation of a
Gentleman and Scholars, censure upon your Book, who perusing some passages in
it in a Booksellers shop, asked whether Culpeper made that obsceane book or no,
and being answered he did, replied, truly Culpeper has made Cul-paper, paper
fit to wipe ones breech withal. Where you writ, You could have written deeper
notions in Physic then shall be found in this book: I must tell you, you would
seem to be a Physician, who have scarce aspired to the Apothecary. But the
College has wrapped up their Children in blankets of ignorance, have they not
shut them up in a Chamber, as it is related your Patron sometines did you: you
say, man may meddle with generals, but before he meddle with particulars, let
him look to himself: But you have Lynceus eyes in others affairs, sed non
vides manticae quod in tergo est. He is a saucy insolent Soldier speaks
irreverently against the Gerall under whose Colors he marches, you profess
your self studient in Physic, but want some Physic your self to purge away
the Malignant humor possesses you, against the honorable Society of the
College of Physicians: A little Hellebor would do well to purge your brains
with, if you could but jump over as easily to Italy or Greece, where it grows,
as Dianas Image did hither. Were you asleep or awake when you saw it jumpe so
far, otherwise I shall think it like one of the stories in the Mirror of
Knighthood. Every bird thinks his own young one fairest suum cuique pulchrum,
you acknowledge the direction for Midwives to be your own child, but whether
you are more properly a borrower or translator, then Father, Judicent Medici.
It Is a slovenly Bird bewrayes his own nest and though you seem to adhere to
Hypocrates you shall never be counted Harpocrates for he was borne with one
hand on his mouth, and the other on his members, but you will close yours upon
neither. But I will conclude with our Mercury, with a story of Mercury out of
our Latin Emblems. Mercury having a good conceit of himself (as our Mercury
has) desirous to know what opinions mortals conceived of him, would needs
descend, and fixed on a Statuaries shop, where lighting and coming in, he
spies many Images of the Gods and Goddesses, and enquires the price of them but
not seeing his own, enquires whether he had the Statue of Mercury or no, he
replied he had, and fetched him forth of a bye corner he had in his shop of
whom Mercury demanded what price he would ask for it, the Statuary replied,
Sir, If you mean in good earnest to buy the other Statues you Cheapned, you
shall have him into the bargain, whereupon Mercury went away discontented, I
leave the Moral to your own application: and your self also; wishing you more
government in your tongue, and discression in your pen, hereafter, concluding
with that saying, His tongue is no slander, whose tongue is all slander,

Your well willer, and a wellwisher to the Substances not shadows of Physic.

The Epistle to the Reader.
COURTEOUS READER,
THere having come to my hands three several Books; Phioravants Secrets, and
also his Chyrurgery, to which is added The Jewel of Practice: Published a good
while since by JOHN HESTER, a Spagyrick Professor, in his time of eminent note:
And knowing the Books very scarce, and out of Print, much desired by Ingenuous
Practitioners in Physic, I have for the Public good communicated those three
several Books to my Friend: assuring my self out of my knowledge of the
Books, that there are in them contained many Chymica arcana, which will be much
advantageous to Spagyrick Students, with the more confidence, because whosoever
desires to have, and make use of the choycest Secrets delivered in them, may
have them faithfully made up, and dispensed in Amen-Corner, by W. I. Chemist to
that honorable Society, and College of London Physicians, who has heretofore
made up the choicest of them, for sundry Physicians, who have earnestly desired
them, and with good success used them: And I doubt not, but they will receive
as good satisfaction in their compositions, as that worthy Spagyrick, (that
from an Italian Coat, put them into an English Vesture) formerly gave them:
Desiring you for your fuller approbation to peruse his Epistle praefixed before
his translation, which I presume, will give you that content is desired from

your Friend, W. I. M. B.

A SHORT DISCOURSE OF THE SECRETS OF THE Most Famous Knight and Excellent
Physician and Surgeon, Lord PHIORAVANT^.
CHAP. I. What thing infirmity is, and whereof it proceeds.
Sickness or Infirmity is no other thing then a distemperature of humors in
the bodies of creatures, as well reasonable as unreasonable, which are subject
to sickness and to death. And these do not proceed of any other thing, then of
the diverse and sundry disorders committed many ways, which disorders every man
might very well defend himself from, if he would. And these disorders which are
thus committed are very many, whereof I will name you a few, and will tell you
also of the infirmities which follow them.

There are many which disorder themselves in their eating, and in the variety
and superfluity of meats, and so corrupt themselves; and of such corruption
engenders ill disposition of the stomach, and loss of appetite, and thence
comes the Itch, and diseases of the legs, and other like matters, which
commonly proceed of much repletion* Others disorder themselves in the excess of
Lechery, of which disorder comes debilitie of the Reins, want of the sight,
weakness of the brains, and oftentimes diseases about the Yard, and other kind
of infirmities hanging upon the French sickness. Some disorder themselves in
fishing, standing much in the water; and of this access comes coldness of
the Nerves, pains of the legs and feet, and such other things which such
access causes. Other some disorder themselves in hunting, in such sort, as
they take heat, cold, weariness, hunger and thirst; of which disorder there
follows Agues, Opilations, Rheums, Numnesse, and such like things; which,
with such disorder and great travel, commonly are wont to be caused. And in
diverse other manners men may disorder themselves, which at this time I will
omit, because I will not be over-tedious to the Reader. It suffices, so that I
show the substance of the thing, and to do it, that every one may understand
it. If then the causes are infinite, by which infirmities or sickness come, and
the remedies a great many more then enough to cure them: I mean therefore to
set down in the Chapters following the infirmities, together with the remedies,
with the which they may be healed, beginning with the infirmities which men
have from their birth unto their death, discoursing of them one after an other.
And first I will speak of Infants and children, which happen into the falling
sickness as soon as they are born.

CHAP. II. To help the falling sickness in young Children.
THe Falling Sickness is a disease, the which in young Children is caused of
great humiditie in the head, and the cure thereof according to our Order, is
with drying things which dissolveth that humiditie, and the Remedy is this:
Take our Cerot Magistrale, and spread it on a cloth the breadth of two fingers
square, and strew thereon the powder of Cantharides: the which of his own
quality and nature is attractive, and brings forth great quantity of water:
then lay this Cerot in the nuke of the neck, and there let it lie at the least
eight or ten days, taking it off every day, and making it clean, then lay it
on that place again. Likewise you shall anoint the head with Oleum Petroleum,
the which is very drying and penetrative; because it comes forth of a Mine
under the earth, the which continually does boil, and so comes forth with the
water, and then is separated. This Oil has a mavelous virtue in himself,
that it defends the fire, for if a man anoint his hands therewith, he may
wash his hands with molten Lead presently, and never hurt him: and that comes
through a certain hidden virtue in that Oil. Also you shall understand, that
this Oil will burn being set on fire, and yet it will not hurt or scald any
thing which it falls on, or touches it.

CHAP. III. To help young Children of certain gross Scabs, that come in the
head and face.
THese gross scabs that come in the head and face, are caused of abundance of
fatness, and moisture of the milk of the Nurse; for the child being tender and
weak of complexion, is not apt to digest that superfluous humor, and so Nature
drives it forth in that order, with great abundance of humiditie, And the best
remedy is, That you shall give the child every morning one scruple to drink,
of our Elixar vitae, because it is a friend to Nature, and nourishes the
body, and dries up superfluous moisture, and so the child shall be helped.
Also you shall anoint the child with our Magno liquore, the which is temperate
of nature, and does penetrate, and so causes solution of that humor.

CHAP. IV. To help young Children of the Rupture.
THe Rupture is caused two ways, the one through weakness of the place, and
the other through much crying, and the remedy is thus: You shall make a Trusse
fit for the child that shall come very close, and then let them use our
Electuarie of Consolida majore, the which is written in my discourse of
Chirurgerie, with diverse of my Medicines: And also you shall give the child to
drink the powder of Alkimilla in wine; and every night you shall anoint the
Rupture with our Oleum Philosophorum, made of Turpentine and Wax: the which is
so peircing, that it warmeth the place that is broke, and helps it to
siccatrize. And so using these three Medicines, thou shall help him quickly,
for this have I proved an infinite of times, and always have had good
success, thanks be to God.

CHAP. V. Of the small Pox that come to Children.
THe Small Pox are caused of superfluous choler and phlegm, the which is mixed
with the blood, and so continuing a certain time it does increase so much, that
Nature cannot bear it, and so drives it forth with a great accident of a
Fever, the which commonly does continue four or five days together, and then
comes forth certain wheals or bladders full of corruption, which within three
days will break and run forth, and many dry. You shall understand that there
are some so weak of Nature that they cannot come forth, but remain within, and
so having no evaporation outwardly, it does choke them, and so die, and that is
the cause why so many creatures from four years old to ten do die without
help. And therefore I considering the true cause of the disease, I have also
found out the true remedy to help them, and that is this. When the child
feels that Accident, give him presently one dram of our Aromatico to eat:
The which has such force and virtue attractive, that it joining unto the
stomach draws unto it all the humors that offend, and carries them forth
both by vomit and sege, and so leaves Nature eased, and the party out of
danger. Then after that anoint him four evenings with our Balsamo artificiato,
and lay him down to sweat, and so he shall be well.

CHAP. VI. Of the Fersa or Measels that come to young Children.
THe Measels that comes to Children, commonly comes after the small pox one
year or two, or three, and is caused of the aforesaid cause; and there is no
other difference between them, but that the person is of more age and strength,
and both come with an accident of a Fever, but in this cause they come forth
thicker, and they dry without breaking or running. Nevertheless, this many
times causes death, if it be not helped quickly, and with the remedies
appropriate. You shall understand that this does not come with so great
vehemency as the other does. You shall only defend the heart and preserve the
stomach from corruption, and putrefaction, and so you shall help them quickly.
The Remedies are these: You shall give them four or five mornings this drink:
Take Julep of Violets, ii. Rosewater, iiii. Oil of Vitriol four grains, mix
them and drink it cold: for this is a rare Medicine.

CHAP. VII. Of Waxing Kernels, which are called of some Scrophulae.
THese Kernels that commonly come in the throat of young Children, are caused
of superfluous melancholy humors corrupted, and are a kind of Ulcer, very
hard to be helped, and evil to have, for when they are broke they cause
excessive pain, because thereunto runs great abundance of humors, and are
so hot and corrupt, that it is impossible to help them with outward Medicines
only, because they proceed of an inward cause. Therefore if thou will help
them, first remove the Cause, and then cure the Effect.

First therefore thou shall give them our Sirrup against Melancholic humors,
written in our discourse of Chirurgerie, and then give him a Dose of our
Aromatico fasting, and that will evacuate the stomach of choler and phlegm, and
dry up those humors that run to the sores. The Medicines that you shall use
to the sore, are two: The first is our Costick, which being laid on the sore,
does mortify it in four and twenty hours, and takes away the corruption.
Note, that you may not take away the Askar, until such time as it falls out
of himself, then lay thereon the black Cerot of Godfredo de Medic. the which
Cerot is written also in Galen. And in short space it will be holp, as I have
proved diverse times.

CHAP. VIII. Of diverse sorts of Scabs, and their Remedies.
SCabs proceed of diverse and sundry causes; Nevertheless, they all are caused
of putrefied blood, as you may see by daily experience. But the said
putrefaction may be caused of diverse accidents, as by eating much moist and fat
meat. It may be caused of a corrupt humor of the French Pox, and of diverse
other causes, which I will leave at this time. Therefore if thou will help any
of the aforesaid causes, it would be necessary to use Purgations, and Unctions:
The Purgations are two, and the Unctions also two. The first Purgation is half
an ounce of our Electuario Angelico, which take in the morning fasting thereon
at the least four hours: then take for ten days together our Soluble Sirrup;
the dose is from. iiii. to. vi. And then if the Scabs come of the Pox, you
shall anoint them five or six nights with our Vnguento magno, and they shall
be helped. But if the scabs come of any other cause, you shall anoint them
with Vnguento de Lithargiro simple, after they are well purged. The Unguent is
made with Vinegar, with the Oil of Roses, and with Litarge.

CHAP. IX. Against Worms in Children.
THis is a rare secret against the Worms, the which I have used a long time,
and always have had good success. Take the seed of Levant, the which is
sweet, and is called in Italian Sementina, and the seeds of Carduus Benedictus,
and of a certain Herb growing on the Sea, called Carolina, ana: stamp it very
fine, and give thereof one dram in honey, and it will kill the Worms, also
thou shall understand that I have a great secret against the Worms, the which I
will show thee; for it may be used more safer then any of these Herbs above
named: You shall anoint all the body over (leaving no part) with our Balm
Artificial, and give the Patient thereof to drink. i. with Wine or Broth. Thou
shall understand, though the child have no Worms, yet the Medicine will do him
great good, because it helps against all manner of diseases that may happen
unto children, and also to other persons.

CHAP. X. Of certain Warts or Carvoli, that come on the Yard of a man.
When Children have passed the foresaid diseases, and that they come to the
age of fourteen years, or fifteen, or more, and that they begin to fall among
women, many times by some accidents, they get these Carvoli, or Warts on the
Yard. And they are of diverse kinds, for some come on the very skin, and some
come on the flesh or end of the Yeard. Some are as though they were burnt or
scorched, and other like Ulcers, and other like Warts. Those that come as
though they were scorched are of small importance, and may be easily helped,
for if you touch them once or twice with our Aqua reali, they will be whole.
Those which are Ulcerated are evil to heal, yet you shall use no strong
Medicines thereto, but only dress them with our Magno liquore, and in short
time they will be whole. Those that are like Warts are very evil to be helped,
for you must mortify them with our Costick, one after another. But if they be
not mortified at once, touch them again, and again. if need require; and when
they are mortified, help them only with our Magno liquore, until they be
whole: And with this Order I have cured a number.

CHAP. XI. Of the Running of the Reins.
THe running of the Reins most commonly comes of the much use of women, or
because those women are corrupted with a certain distemperature of heat, that
is able to corrupt a man using with her. And of this running there may grow
diverse diseases, as you may see by those that are troubled therewith, if they
be not helped as they ought to be. One of the diseases that may come of this,
is great pains in the back, because it does weaken the virtue of the Reins.
There may come also a great burning in the Yeard, and botches in the Groin, and
such like, all which are hard to be dissolved. The cure of this disease is,
You shall take three times our Pills called Pillolae Aquilonae, every third day
once, that being done, he shall use this Electuarie seven or eight days
together.

Take a certain shell which is smooth, and is called of some Calcinelli, and of
some Toninole, and of some Telline; Take them and burn them, make it into fine
powder, and take thereof i. the buds of Cankers or wild Eglantine that the Rose
comes of, it is called in Italian Rose canine,. di. Hysope of the Mountain.
ii. white honey crude. vi. Make thereof an Electuarie without fire. The dose
is,. i, in the morning fasting, and at night before meat. Note, that when you
use this Medicine, you shall eat no Pork, nor Fish, nor slimie things.

CHAP. XII. Of a Botch which is caused of a corrupt humor, which is a kind of
Pox.
I Would here show the cause more plainer, but that there are diverse which
have showed it plain enough: but I will show thee the true secret and remedy
to help them. First, Thou shall give them ten mornings together our Soluble
Sirrupe, and then take our Aromatico three times, that being done, and that the
botch is open, you shall dress it with our Magno liquore upon a tent, and lay
upon the sore our Magistrale Cerotte, and with these two medicines thou shall
help it from the beginning to the ending, as I have seen the experience diverse
times.

CHAP. XIII. Of Pellarella that causes the hair to fall off.
PEllarella, or Morphewe, is a kind of Pox, and is one of the first Presagia of
that disease, and is a corrupt humor, and so drying, that in short time it
mortifieth the hair of the head and beard, and eyebrows, and causes them to
fall off. You shall understand that this disease is such a thing, that it
cannot be helped by any means, except it be taken in time, before the hair be
mortified. Nevertheless I will show a secret unto the World, to know when a
man has that disease or no, and in what time he may help it that they shall
not fall. The secret is this, Thou shall understand, that the beginning of
Pellarella, is one Carvoli or more that comes upon the Yeard, the which
seems to be of little importance, because they are helped with ease, but
within ten, or fifteen days after they are whole, there will come a certain
alteration in the throat, which will not suffer him to swallow his meat, which
does endure commonly eight or ten days, and so go away by it self without
any medicine, and in that time the hair is mortified, and then within two or
three months the hair will fall: so that this is the cause why they cannot be
helped when they fall away, for the time was passed before, and the roots
mortified. Therefore if thou will keep thy self from running into such a great
danger, thou may do it easily if thou take it in time: and the remedy is
this. When you have had any of these Carvoli, and that after there comes an
alteration in the throat, then presently purge, and use a defensive unction
that the hair may not mortify. You shall purge him nine days every morning
with our Sirupo Magistrale, and fast thereon four hours. The dose is from iii.
to vi. that being done, you shall give him. di. of Electuario Angelica,
according to the recept, and in the mean time anoint all his face and head
with our Magno liquore, and doing thus, it is not possible that the hair
should fall off. This is a secret, the which few men have known, and never
written of any before this time, and is of so great importance, that it were
necessary to be known for an universal health, that every man might keep
himself from this disease.

CHAP. XIIII. Of Scabbes that come through the Pox.
THe Scabbes that come through the Pox, are of diverse sorts; as you may see by
experience: yet all may be helped with one order of medicine, because they
proceed of no other thing then of the evil disposition of that disease. And
these most commonly do proceed and come after Pellarella, and this is the cure.
You shall give him our Soluble Sirrup every morning warm, with two ounces of
Mel Rosarum, and lay him down to sweat, and cover him well, and then at night
anoint him with Vnguento di Lithargiro, and thus doing five, or six days, he
shall be helped. For with this order I have helped an infinite number, to my
great honor, and satisfaction of the Patient.

CHAP. XV. Of certain Tumors, or swellings in diverse parts of the body.
SWellings, which use to come to man, are called Tumors against nature, and
may come of diverse causes, as by cold, and they do cause inflammations without
pain, and most commonly they come in the articular parts: There are others
which are caused of hot humors, and those are called Risepelli: There are
other that come of the Pox, and these come in the head, and on the legs and
arms, and are of evil digestion, because they are engendered of corrupt,
viscous, and crude humors. You shall understand that these three kinds do
differ in quality, and are also helped with sundry medicines. Those that come
of cold, are windy humors, and may be helped with bathes of herbs, and hot
unctions that have virtue to dissolve the wind. The herbs to make the bath,
are these: Nettles, Mallows, Pelletory of the wall, Bran and Ashes, and make
thereof a bath; and then anoint them with our Oleum Philosophorum, made of
Turpentine and Wax. Those that come of hot humors, you shall wash with Aqua
Vitae, because it opens the pores, and dissolveth that heat. Those that are
come of the Pox, are evil to heal, and his cure must be with great purging:
and the chiefest thing that you can give him, is our potion of Lignum Vitae,
because it does make thin those gross humors, and dissolve the swellings, if
it be taken according to the order of the recept, the which is written in this
Book. And so with this order thou shall help them perfectly.

CHAP. XVI. Of Ache in diverse parts of the body.
AChes, that come to diverse parts of the Bodies, do spring of diverse causes, as
it is said before of the Swellings, or Tumors: but for the most part now in
this our time, they are caused of the Pox, and those kinds of Aches are evil
to be helped, because they are engendered of viscous humors, and putrefaction
of the blood, and of evil disposition of the Liver. And the cure of those
Aches, is to purge the body, and purify the Liver: and that thou shall do with
our Soluble Sirrupe, taking it ten days: and then take our Electuario
Angelica, or Pillole Aquilone, and then use your wine of Lignum sanctum, and
sweat therewith as much as thou can, for it is warm and dry, and apperative,
and provokes sweat, and so they shall be helped. But if it happen that this
will not help, then anoint them three or four times with our Vnguento magno,
and without all doubt by Gods grace, they shall be helped and sound of that
disease.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Cough in the stomach.
THe Cough comes diverse and sundry ways to the stomach, as by cold, and that
is one of the most common causes that may be, and is of small importance,
because it will go away of it self without medicine. There is another kind of
Cough that troubles much old folk, and that is of a Catarrhous humor. The
third kind of Cough written of by us, is that which comes to those that have
the Fever Hectic. Also there is another kind which is caused of the French
Pox. And these are the four kinds of Coughes that do commonly happen unto men
and women. The first kind of Cough that happens unto man through cold, is
easy to be helped, for nature of it self will help it without any other help:
but if thou will help nature thou may with ease, and that shall be with
eating dry and apperatiue meats, and drinking good wine, and so the Cough
will go away quickly. But the Cough which comes to old folk, is caused of a
Catarrhous humor, which is nothing else but debilitie of nature, for lack of
natural heat, the which causes the stomach that it cannot digest his meat in
such order as it should, but ingendreth those superfluous humors, that cause
the Cough. And this must be helped with keeping of diet; that is, to eat little
meat, and to use thing that warm the stomach and help digestion, and this thou
shall do in this order. Take. ii. of our Aromatico, which has virtue to
evacuate the stomach, and then use our Quintessence of Wine, and anoint the
stomach with our Balm artificial, and so shall thou help this kind of Cough.
The third kind of Cough, which is caused of the Fever Hectic, is of evil
nature, that I dare say nothing nor show a Medicine, because the most part that
are troubled therewith, go to Church and never return again to their houses, as
you may see by experience. The fourth kind of Cough is devilish and evil to
help, because it is caused of the Pox, and does not only hurt the stomach, but
causes great pains to the party beside. Nevertheless, thou shall understand
that this is easy to he helped by Gods grace, for them that know the true
secret, which is thus: You shall give him eight or ten days together our
Soluble Sirrup, then take two drachms of our Aromatico, and then perfume him
with Cinabar five or six mornings, or so long until that he feel pain in his
gums, and then he shall be whole. For this is a great secret, to help that
kind of Cough caused of the Pox, as I have proved a thousand times with good
success.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the white Scab that comes in the Head.
THis Scab is of an evil corruption in the superior parts, which is caused of
abundance of moisture, and heat of the Stomach, which sends these vapors up
to the head, and so goes out that way. This is of two kinds, the one is hot
and dry, and that is with a certain white crust, without any other kind of
putrefaction: the other kind is hot and moist, and that causes a certain
crust, which is full of matter under it; so that as they differ in quality,
they differ also in cure. Those that are hot and dry, must have Medicines that
cool the heat, and extinguish the dryness, and this thou shall do with Sirrup
of Citarch, and purge often with Cassia, and use cooling things, as Succorie,
Melons, Lettice, and such like. The other kind which is hot and moist, you
must first help the heat, and then dry the humiditie, which you shall do with
vomiting, and purging, and keeping diet, and eating of drying meats. The first
drying scab you shall anoint only with our Magno liquore, which without help
of any other thing, will cure it after they be purged, as is before said. The
second kind you shall help, after the body is purged with our Cerot
Magistrale, strewing thereon Cantharides in fine powder, which have virtue
attractive; by which means it mundifieth the head of that superfluous
humiditie, and then anoint him with our Vnguento magno, and in short space it
will be whole, because it is cold and dry. And so by this means thou may
heal these two kinds of Scabs, as I have done diverse times, having respect to
the cause. Ye shall understand that this disease is many times taken from the
Nurse, the which is infected with the Pox, and so her milk being corrupted, it
corrupts the child, and therefore there must be good consideration thereof in
the cure.

CHAP. XIX. Of Risipella.
THis Risipella is an inflammation with swelling and redness, the which
commonly comes in the face, arms and legs, and in no other places of the
body, and it is caused of alteration of the blood, as I will show you an
example by a pot that you sees your meat in: When it is set on the fire, and
is full of liquor, lacking one or two inches of the top, and when it begins
to boil through the great heat of the fire, it runs over the pot: and so by
the like example we may say, that Risipella is a great alteration of the blood,
through superfluous heat; and this occasion of heat proceeds of great
quantity of phlegm, that is in the stomach; for because as soon as they have
vomited the phlegm, they are helped of Risipella, for I have seen the experience
thereof diverse times. Therefore give them of the juice of Elder-Roots. iiii.
and of Honey of Roses. ii. in the morning fasting, for this purges the Stomach
of phlegm, and cools the blood, then hold the parts over the fume of hot
water, and bathe it with pure Aqua vitae, distilled without phlegm: for this is
one of the most excellent Medicines that can be found, because it is aperative
and attractive, and presently dissolveth that alteration, and takes away the
pain. Also it would be good to use five or six mornings to drink. i. of Julep
of Violets, with six grains of Vitriol, for this mundifieth the stomach, and
causes digestion, and of himself is most wholesome, for that it mortifieth all
hot diseases.

CHAP. XX. Of the Squinancie.
THe Squinancie is a certain alteration in the throat, which is caused of a
flatuous or windy humor, and this comes with such a vehemency, that if it be
not helped quickly, it will choke him, for it stops the conduites where the
breath comes through, and lets a man to swallow his meat, and the Remedy
is this: Take of our Electuario angelica,. di. and then touch the throat within
with our Aqua reale three or four times, and without anoint it with Oleum
Philosophorum of Turpentine and Wax, because it is very drying: And thus using
the aforesaid remedies, thou may help them without letting blood, or any
other thing in short space: for herewith I have cured a great number. You shall
understand, that oil of Linseed is very appropriate to that matter, if you give
the Patient four ounces. Also the tooth of a Bore made in powder, and drunk the
quantity of. ii. in Linseed oil helps the Squinancie. These I have proved
diverse times.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Emerodes that come in the Fundament.
THese in Naples be called Moricole, and in Venice, Maroelle, and in Spain,
Almorane; and are an alteration of blood in the Emorodiall veins, which many
times come forth in the lower parts with great pain, and these are caused of
putrified humors of the body, and corruption of the blood, which corruption
many times comes of the Pox, or such like diseases. There are also diverse
kinds, but principally two: The one sort is within the fundament, and causes
great pain when they go to stool: The other sort comes forth of the fundament,
and are not so painful as the other are. To cure them that are within the
Fundament, you shall give the Patient eight or ten mornings our Syrupo
Magistrale, and then let him take of our Aromatico,. ii. and use Glisters
wherein is put half an ounce of Aqua reale at a time, and so thou shall help
them. The best remedy for those that come forth is to make incision, or to
make a little hole in them, that the blood may come forth which is putrified,
and so by evacuation thou shall help them. Also thou shall understand, that
vomiting is necessary in the cure of them both, because it opens the veins.
Also oil of Eggs, and oil of Frankincense, and oil of Linseed are very
profitable to anoint them therewith to ease the pain.

CHAP. XXII. A goodly and easy way to help all sorts of Fevers according to
our Order.
THe Fever Quotidian or continual Fever, or any other kind whatsoever, do
proceed only of two principal causes, that is, of corruption and
putrefaction, as you may perceive how that when the Fever is entered, the
Patient is all corrupted, beginning at the stomach, the which is first
corrupted. For proof you may always see that as soon as a man is sick,
presently he loses his appetite and cannot eat; afterward it corrupts the
blood, for by experience, if you let them blood, it is always found corrupted,
and not as it is in a sound body. It corrupts also the senses, so that the
sick is not stable senced, nor cannot sleep, or rest by any means whilst he
has that accident. That it is caused also of Putrefaction you may see by them,
that have the Fever. For always when the Fever comes, presently the stomach
does putrify, and spitteth forth filthy spittle: Also it does putrify the
body, because their Excrements that they void are putrified and stinking more
then others, and their Urine putrified and alterated from his natural course.
Then seeing the Fever is caused of corruption and putrefaction, there are four
things necessary to be done in the cure thereof. The first is, to evacuate the
stomach: The second, to purge by urine: The third, to evacuate the body: And
the fourth is, to purge by sweat: Which four operations may be done one after
another with great ease, and will restore the Patient to his health. But you
shall understand, that all cannot be holp, for that God almighty has made us
to die, and when that time comes, medicines will do no good, but if that time
be not yet come, by the help of God, with these Medicines he shall be restored
to his former health. The first thing, as I said, is to take a vomit, which
does evacuate the stomach of choler and phlegm, that does much offend the body
diseased: After that, evacuate the body with those things that the Physician
thinks most convenient for that purpose, for there be many purgations to
dissolve the body, and to evacuate malign humors: After that, make him purge
by urine. Fourthly, and last of all, give him medicines that open the pores,
and that provokes sweat. And thus with these four operations, the most part
shall be holp of that infirmity with great ease, and in short time: And as I
have said, this is a most true order that never fails, except (as I said
before) when the Lord will call them. And as for these medicines, you shall
find them written in this book severally with their uses and quantities.

CHAP. XXIII. Another cure of the said Fevers.
IF thou will help the said Fevers according to our order: when the Patient is
greatly alterated therewith, thou shall use five ways wherewith thou shall
easily help them, the which are these. The first as I said before is Vomit: the
second evacuation of the body: the third evacuation by urine: the fourth to
provoke sweat: and the fifth by unction. Nevertheless each of these alone is
sufficient to help the said Fever: but yet using them all five, there is no
doubt but thou may dissolve any evil sort of malign Fever, except as I
said before, God will call them out of this World: but to the purpose of the
cure. First thou shall set on five or six boxing glasses, according to the
complexion and age of the infirmed: then the next morning give him one dose of
our Electuario angellica, with Sirrup of Sorrel, and water of Sorrel. Then
the next morning following give him some Sirrup appropriate for that disease,
and put thereto. ii. of Sirrupo Magistrale, with Rhabarbe: that being ended,
give him three or four times Julep of Violets with Oil of Sulphur, made per
Campana, the dose of the Julep is ii. and of the Oil of Sulphur four or five
grains mixed together, and this you shall take in stead of Sirrup betimes in
the morning, and it will make them sweat and purge by urine, which are most
necessary for the sick: and in the mean season you shall anoint them every
night with Magno liquore, which will make them rest well, and take away all
their pains throughout the body, and so by this means the Fever shall be
perfectly taken away. Also take great heed that you take no more blood then is
necessary, neither let them keep any straight Diet, but let them keep a good
regiment of Life. But when this Fever does come through some other cause, then
it were necessary to remove the principal cause, if thou will cure them: For
if it be caused of a Catarre, of necessity you must dissolve the Catarre
first; and then help the Fever. Also if the Fever be caused of a wound, it were
necessary first to take away the pain of the wound, and then the Fever will
depart. And thus in every kind of Fever, it is most necessary to know the
original from whence it is caused: And this is the true way to cure these
infirmities, which I have proved infinite times.

CAAP. XXIIII. Of the continual Fever.
THere are many kinds of Fevers, therefore I will mention of them that are
most known unto the world, and first of the continual Fever, that is of those
that are only hot, and continue in one order both day and night, the which is
caused of alteration and corruption of the humors in the body, which engender
so much corruption in the stomach, and in the blood, that they cause that
accident of Fever: And the very order to cure it is this. In the beginning of
the alteration let him keep a good diet, and drink no wine: and that is done
because that corruption is apt to corrupt all that enters into the body
during that alteration, and therefore meats of great substance or nourishment,
are sooner turned into greater putrefaction in the body: But when the third day
of the Fever is past, then take of our Aromatico. ii. which will evacuate the
stomach of that corruption: and that day that you take this Aromatico, drink as
much crude water as you will: which is done because the stomach shall remain
clear washed of that corruption, which being done, you shall give him three or
four mornings our Soluble Sirrup, and give him good meats, and let him drink
Wine, because it cannot hurt in any wise, for it cannot putrife in the body:
For the sirrup does evacuate every day the corruption: and when the blood is
alterated of that putrefaction, it goes to the veins, and so disperseth
through the whole body. It would be good to set on boxing glasses to take away
blood, and also to use drying unctions, as our Balsaemo artificato, and Oil of
Turpentine and Wax, and thus doing (if the Patient be not called of God) thou
shall help him within short space. And this is the true secret to use for that
Fever, which I have revealed unto the world, that every one might have it at
their pleasure.

CHAP. XXV. A great Secret that helps the continual Fever.
THese Fevers that are not accidental, that is, not caused of a wound or
imposthume, or other kind of infirmity apparent, are caused of a certain
humor between the skin and the flesh, which would have exhalation: as you may
see by experience in this kind of Fever, how that sweats and boxing is very
appropriate to their solution. And in this case I will show thee a great
remedy, with which after convenient purging thou may help in manner all
those kinds of Fevers. And this is the remedy: Take Oippa ofir, the which is
a simple well known to all the world, take of that herb a small quantity, and
stamp it a little, and lay it upon the wrist, and bind it hard, and there let
it lie until it have made a blister full of water, which you shall break, and
there will come forth great abundance of water, and by that place the Fever
shall be dissolved. And the reason is, because it evacuateth that humor which
engendereth the accident: then the cause being removed, the effect will cease,
and the Patient shall be whole.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Fever Tertian.
THe Fever Tertian does not continue in one manner, but comes and goes, and
is caused of chollerick humors: for as soon as the fit comes it moves
choler, and in many it provokes vomit. There are two sorts of those Fevers,
The one comes with an accident, first cold, and then hot: and the other sort
comes always hot, when the accident comes: and sometimes that accident
comes twice a day, and that is called a double Tertian, which is hard to
help, because letting blood, the diet, and purging of the body are all hurtful
and contrary to that disease, therefore I will open to thee a secret wherewith
thou shall help them. Thou shall give him three hours before the fit ss. of
Eleborus niger in powder, with. i. of Mel Rosarum: and after it drink. i. of
common water, and this you shall take twice, and then use this potion ten days
every morning. Take Julep of Violets. i. fine Aqua vitae. di. Oil of Sulphur,
that is perfect iiii. grains, and mix them together, this mundifieth the
stomach, and purges by urine, and provokes sweat, and warmeth the blood:
which effects are necessary to the solution of that Fever, giving you great
charge that you keep no straight diet in any wise, because it weakneth the
stomach, cools the blood, and hinders nature, so that the Patient can
scarce be helped. But with our order thou shall help the most part of that
Fever.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Fever of Repression.
THis Fever is an alteration of the blood, which is caused of being over hot,
and then cold and this is called a Fever propter accidens, and is not holp as
the other Fevers are: for thou shall help only the Repression, and the Fever
will go away without any other help. Thou shall give the Patient of our
Aromatico,. ii. that being done, give him two Sirrups every day, the one in the
morning, the other at night two hours after Supper, as hot as you may suffer
to drink, and these are the Sirrups. Take Sirrup of Quinces, Stecados, Mel
Rosarum, ana,. i. new Must boiled,. vi. and in the mean time while you take
this Sirrup, it were necessary to make a moist bath with herbs, as Nettles,
Mallows, Egrimonie, Carduus Benedictus, Rosemary, Origanum, and Calamint, ana
lb. iii. Commin, Anniseede, Coliander, Sileri montani, ana lb. i. then boil
all those in a great Kettle with water, and then let the Patient sit over the
fume, and cover him with clothes until he sweat. And thus you shall do three
times one day after another: and thou shall help him perfectly, as I have had
experience.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Fever Hectic.
THis Fever is a viscous and putrified humor in the stomach and lunges, the
which is caused of a debility and weakness of nature that cannot digest the
offensive humors. There are diverse sorts of this Fever, nevertheless they are
all evil to be holpt, and are counted uncurable. Nevertheless, I will show
thee some excellent remedy very wholesome, that may pleasure them, although they
are nigh their death. The first medicine that shall do them good, is our
Electuario angellica, of which you shall give half an ounce in the morning
fasting, for this presently joyneth unto the stomach, and draws to it all the
offensive humors, and carries them forth by vomit and seege, and so leaves
the stomach eased and clean, that the Patient thinks himself whole: But yet
the stomach begins again to fill with a great suffocation, that will not
let the Patient take rest, so that this medicine may well ease them, but not
help them quite. Also our Elixar vitae does much good in this disease, and
also our Balm artificial: if you anoint the stomach therewith at night when
you go to bed. Also use our distillation for the Hectic: these may all help a
little but not cure. The Fever Hectic may come also of a Catarre, of the Pox,
and such like causes, and then they require medicines according to the cause:
as if the Fever be caused of a Catarre, let them use our Magno liquore to
drink, the dose is one ounce at a time, with half an ounce of Mel Rosarum, and
these use for a month at the least. And if it be caused of the Pox, let him
take Sarsaparilla, or Lignum vitae, Pillole Aquilone, or such like that will
help the Pox: and thus doing, the cure will have good success: but when it is
caused of debility of Nature (as is said before) they spit blood until the end.

CHAP. XXIX. A new order wherewith thou may cure and help the most part of
the Fever Hectic.
MAny have thought that the Fever Hectic is altogether desperate and
uncurable, and that by no means it might be resolved: But because it is caused
of diverse and sundry accidents, I say that many kinds may be helped and cured:
For I find it may come of infinite causes, as aforesaid. There is one kind that
comes through the weakness of nature it self, and that begins to destroy
the Lunges, and that kind I find to be incurable, because it is caused of the
evil nature of the man, and not through any accident, and in that case I
believe it cannot be dissolved by any means. Also there are many other
Hecticks caused of the French Pox, of which I have seen and cured an infinite,
and they are easy to cure: For curing the Pox, the Fever will be dissolved.
There is another kind that depends of a salt humor, and some other of a
Catarre, and of many other things: Therefore if thou will help the said Fever,
it were necessary to know the true cause whereof it depends, the which in my
judgment is hard to be known, if that the Patient himself do not tell it: and
therefore it is necessary for the Physician to examine them well, and to enquire
whether they have had any kind or spice of the Mal Francese before, whereof the
said Fever might have his original: and so doing, he with his judgment may be
resolved of the nature of that infirmity: and if it chance that the said Fever
had his original of the Pox, the Phisician may resolve it with medicines
appropriate for that disease, with purging him strongly, and giving him Lignum
Sanctum, or Salsa pariglia, and also perfume him with Olibanum Sinaber and
Mirrha, ana: and so by the help of God, and means of these medicines thou
shall help them all, or at least the most part of that kind of Fever Hectic.
But if the Phisician find that kind of Fever to be caused of a Catarre, then
use the medicines that help the Catarre, and so the Fever shall be whole. But
when he finds it to be of the weakness of Nature, in that case there is no
help that is sure. Nevertheless, I have cured some of them with great
difficulty, and with Medicines of great efficacy: And that was with giving
them every morning one dram of good Soap in tablets according to our
invention, and that they used for a month together: the which Soap has virtue
to dry that abundance of spittle, and to heal the Lungs ulcerated, and it also
strengthens the Stomach marvellously: After that I caused them to use our
distillation of a Hen for the Hectic, and this they did continually drink:
Also I caused them to use our Balsamo artificiato to anoint therewith every
night after Supper, the which is peircing, and comfort and augmenteth
natural strength, and comfort much the infirmed: Also I caused them to use
Aromatico Rosato, the which comfort the weak Stomach. And by this means I
have helped some of them as it well known.

CHAP. XXX. Of the Fever Quartane.
THe Fever Quartane is a motion of a certain accident cold and hot, which is
caused of melancholy humors corrupted and putrified, the which every third
day does cause that accident to come, and begins with great cold and
continues a good while, and then comes hot. And this Quartane both the
ancient Doctors, and these in our time do count in a manner uncureable.
Nevertheless, I that have sought always to help those diseases which were
counted uncurable, amongst the rest have found the true and perfect cure for
the Quartane Ague, and to dissolve the melancholy humors, which is done with
three Medicines that are rare and mavelous to dissolve any Quartane. The
first is, Mercury Precipitate without corrosive, giving thereof ten grains,
with half an ounce of Sugar Rosate, and that day eat little meat; that being
done, take a pound of Iva Artetica, and boil it in eight pound of white wine,
and common Honey one pound, until a third part be consumed, and of that drink
morning and evening six ounces warm one hour after supper: And in the mean time
anoint every night his Reins with our Balsamum artificial. Thus doing thou
shall help any Quartane. I have also found other rare ways to cure this Fever
Quartane, as hereafter follows.

CHAP. XXXI. The Order to help the Fever Quartane of all sorts, in short time.
THe Fever Quartane is caused of a melancholy humor as aforesaid, with a
continual distillation of the head, descending to the stomach, and augmenting
the evil disposition of the body; and by reason of that distillation,
provokes much sweat when the accident of the Fever comes: And likewise that
distillation causes such cold in the Marrow of the Reins and Back, and an
infinite of other disorders which trouble the body greatly. But to avoid all
these inconveniences, and to dissolve wholly that accident of the Quartane
according to our order, because I have helped more then any Physician of our
time. I will show thee how with these Remedies following thou shall help them,
though not all, yet the greater part truly most miraculously, and the Order to
dissolve it is thus. You shall give the Patient a dose of our Aromatico in the
morning to eat, and drink thereon two or three ounces of good wine, and fast
thereon six hours, and this Medicine is most convenient the day of the fit,
because the infirmity removes great quantity of humors, and the medicine
evacuateth them; and thus giving it three times in the day of the fit, it will
work a great operation. But if the Fever be in a person of melancholy
complexion, then it is where it would be; for you may see that in a melancholy
person, the Fever has more force, then in any other complexion, which proves,
that the Fever, and that complexion are most like: But in that case you shall
cure them in this Order: You shall give him ten or fifteen days out Sirrup
against the melancholy humor, which is written in this Book, which you shall
take two hours before day hot, and then sleep one sleep thereon, and thus do
every morning, and every night anoint all the parts of the body with our
Balsamo artificiato, and he shall be helped. But if it happen that this does
not cure him, let not to give him this remedy, which most surely (God willing)
will help him, and that remedy is our Aqua Balsami, of which he shall take
every morning two Drachms fasting, and so continue until the Fever be gone
quite: so that of force using all the aforesaid remedies, the Fever must needs
depart. And the reason is this, that our Aromatico evacuateth the stomach of
all impediments by vomit, and lets the descension of the head, which causes
the accident. Our Syrrup evacuateth the melancholy humor, and dissolveth it
by his proper quality. Our Balsamo the which is subtle and penetravive dries
and comfort the place offended, in such order, that it casts forth all the
matter that may offend Nature. Our Aqua balsami also being drunk, does dry the
evil humors, and augment strength, in so much that it quite extinguisheth the
said Quartane. And this may be used in all manner of persons, and in all times
of the year without any doubt of inconvenience: and it is a new remedy that
never was set out before of the Ancients, which I have used to the great profit
of the Patients.

CHAP. XXXII. Another discourse a mavelous secret against the said Quartane.
THe Fever Quartan is caused of melancholy humors, which has his fit coming
every third day, first cold with great thirst, and then comes the heat, which
remains with some longer then with other some, and the cause, hereof is hard
to be known. Nevertheless, I seeking out continually natural things, and the
quality of the accidents, I do find that this Fever begins always in some
particular place, as in the head with a certain pain round about it, or in the
nose and ear, or in the Reins and Legs: And therefore he that can find out the
place where first begins the accident, may easily help them, because the
Fever is dissolved with two things only, that is, exhalation and exsication,
and herein consists the secret. The order to make the Exhalation shall be
thus: Make a Cerot of Frankincense, Pitch, Wax, Turpentine, Myrrh and Aloes,
upon the which Cerot you shall put the powder of Cantharides, and then lay it
upon the place where they feel the Fever come first, that is on the particular
part where the accident comes, and this you shall change twice, except the
first day of the Fever. And to make the exsication, give him every day in the
morning to drink,. di. of our Aqua balsami for twelve days, and with the
Balsamo artificiato anoint every night his Stomach and Reins, and so he shall
be helped, giving you charge also that before you use these Medicines, that he
take three times our Aromatico, and so he shall be quite helped.

CHAP. XXXIII. A secret to help all Fevers in their beginning.
When the Fevers are new begun or taken, and that the putrefaction is not yet
confirmed, then may it be helped with great ease, but after they have taken
their beginning, they are hardly helped. Therefore when the Fever is new begun,
you shall give them ii of our Aromatico fasting in the morning: and the next
day about the same hour you shall give them. i. of our Vegitabile Sirrup: and
the third day you shall give them four Drachms of our Electuario angelica with
broth, the which takes away the Fever altogether. And this operation intends
only to the continual Fever, Quotidian, Tertian, and putrified or
pestilentiall, but not to the accidental, or Hectic, nor Quartane: For these
three kinds are much differing from the rest, because the accidental is caused
of another infirmity anterior or going before. The Fever Hectic is caused of
weakness of nature, and the Quartane is caused of great quantity of
melancholicke humors, and they are cured by contrary means unto the first.
The accidental are cured with helping the principal infirmity: The Hectic
is cured by helping of Nature, and preserving the Liver and Lungs from
putrefaction: The Quartane is cured with Vomits, Unctions, Cerottes, and drying
drinks, and these are great secrets to be known: For in this Chapter consists
a great part of Physic, and Surgery if you consider well thereon.

CHAP. XXXIIII. A Secret of one Simple that helps in manner all Fevers.
THere are an infinite of medicines that dissolve the Fever, but above all
other this seems to me of great authority, because it helps it with such
ease, that it is to be wondered at. With this remedy through the Divine
goodness, I have cured a great number, and the Secret is this. You shall gather
in the Month of August a certain herb, which the Italians do call Oreula,
which you shall dry and make into powder, of the which you shall give the sick
as much as will lie upon a sixpence, with water or wine, and give it warm in
the morning, and fast thereon three or four hours, and thus doing, the Patient
shall be helped with great ease, and in short time: for this is a great secret
which may be used in all times and in every occasion, and always it works an
operation in one manner.

CHAP. XXXV. Of the Gout.
THe Gout which comes to men, is a distemperature and alteration, which is
caused of corrupt and undigested humors, and also of feeding on meats that
nourish much, and then to use no exercise, as you may see by the most part of
them that be troubled with that disease. Also this disease, both of the old and
new Doctors has been counted uncurable, as it is known to every one: But yet
I, which have done nothing else but sought out the nature and quality of
things, have found diverse inventions in sundry Arts, as thou may read in my
Caprici Medicinali, and so amongst the rest, I have found (through the help of
God) the true and perfect Secret to help the Gout, so that it shall never come
again: Of which disease I have cured a great number in diverse Cities of the
world, as in Palermo, in Sicilia, in Messina, and in diverse places of Calabria,
in Naples, in Rome, and in Venice, as it is well known unto the most part of
the Inhabitants of those Cities.

CHAP. XXXVI. A Note concerning the Cure of the Gout, taken out of a Letter
which this Author wrote unto a certain noble Seigniour, the Duke of Vrbine.
FIrs;t you shall understand, that the Gout of what kind soever it be, either
hot or cold, or of any other temperature, they all come of one only cause,
although they work diverse Effects, which Effects come through the complexions
of them that have that infirmity: As for example, to show it more plainly, you
may see that in fat men, the Gout comes always with inflammation and redness
and great pain: In lean persons it comes always with pains, but with less
inflammation. In choleric and melancholy persons, it comes with tumors, and
that is Nodosa. And the cause of this infirmity is, of an evil quality
ingendered in the stomach, in the Liver, and in the blood: And the cure
thereof, is to ease the stomach of that evil, and to purge the Liver and the
blood, and to mittigate the pain: All which thou may do with these three
Remedies following, viz. our Pillole Magistrale, our Unction for the Gout, and
our Quinta essentia solutivo: for the Pills do discharge the stomach, and our
Quinta essentia solutivo purges the Liver and the blood, and our Unction
takes away the pain, for if you remedy the cause which is only one, the
effect will cease. As concerning the Gout you shall cure it in this Order:
First, when you feel the pain begin to come, you shall take two doses of those
Pills in the morning fasting, one day after another, or if you will, rest a day
or two according to your strength, that being done, you shall take every
morning. ii. of our Quinta essentia solutivo in half a Porringer full of the
broth of Veal, and a little Sugar, and this take five hours before meat; and
keep no straight Diet, but eat reasonably, and every night after Supper anoint
the grief with our Unction for the Gout, and thus through the help of God, and
the virtue of these Medicines, the Gout shall be cured.

CHAP. XXXVII. Another Discourse upon the same infirmity of the Gout, and the
Order to cure it, taken out of his Book called, Thesaurro della Vita Humana.
ALthough the wise and learned of the world, have always believed that the
Gout is of diverse kinds, yet they have all been deceived; for that infirmity
is one only, and comes of one only cause, although in some it come in manner
of Phlegmone, and in some other like Risipilla, and in other Nodosa, and in
other with pain without alteration, and in some other in diverse manners; all
which is caused through the diversity of complexions, for that one man is
phlegmatic, the other sanguine, the other choleric, and the other adust, and
thus by these means, many have thought the Gout to have been of diverse kinds,
whereas indeed it is only one, and is cured with one only order, and
dissolved altogether for ever; for that infirmity is caused of no other then
of rotten humors caused of indigestion, and to say truth, we see that the said
infirmity never comes in manner, but unto those persons that feed well on
meats of great nourishment, which for want of exercise, that Nature might
digest it, they wanting natural heat, cannot have their orderly digestion, and
for that cause the humors do ingrossse out of measure, and engender that
infirmity, and then Nature that always seeks to ease her self of that which
offends her, drives forth that humor unto the extreme parts, as the hands,
and feet, or other particular parts, and this is the Gout: And these humors
many times are cause of Mal francese, and this is all the secret. He therefore
that is advertised by me, shall be most cunning in curing of it.

CHAP. XXXVIII. What order must be used in curing of the said Gout.
SEeing the Gout (as I said before) are gross humors undigested coming of the
aforesaid cause, it were most necessary, if thou will cure them to do three
operations. The first of them is Phlebothomie, which must be done under the
tongue, cutting overthwart one of those two veins: For that Phlebothomie
evacuateth the stomocall humors that are cause of that corruption. The second
operation that is to be done, is to assubtiliate the gross and rotten humors,
and to evacuate them quite. The third operation that is to be done, is to
preserve nature in good temperature, and to help the digestion, and thus doing,
the said infirmity shall be extincted. If therefore thou will help the Gout,
and after they are helped, keep the Patient in good temperature and prosperity
of life, it were necessary to do these three operations. After the first is
done, as I have said, it were needful to come to the second, which is to
assubtiliate the gross humors, which will be done with four remedies. The
first of them is our Quinta essentia solutiva, which subtiliateth the humors,
and evacuateth them downwards. The second remedy is our Electuario angelica,
which evacuateth the humors hanging in all parts, and leaves nature so eased,
that it may well prevail. The third remedy is a Fomentation, which dries up
the humidity of the head and stomach, and by means of that operation the
disease shall remain extincted. The fourth and last remedy is our Balsamo
against the pains, with which you shall anoint upon the place grieved, for it
mittigateth the pains greatly. And thus with these four remedies thou shall
help the Gout perfectly, as I have often times done in Venice, and at Rome, and
in diverse other places of Italy, well known there unto all men.

CHAP. XXXIX. The Order to preserve a man from the Gout, when he is once helped.
AFter that a man through the divine goodness of God shall be helped of the
Gout, he may if he will preserve himself in health, with these three noble
Remedies. The first of them is our Vegitable Quintessence, the which does cause
good digestion, warmeth the stomach, and defends it from corruption, by which
Effects it will return Nature in manner as it was in youth, and it preserves
the sight and the hearing, and diverse good operations which are all necessary.
The second Remedy is our Oleo incompostibile, with which you shall anoint the
stomach, and that will cause digestion, comfort the heart, provoke sleep, and
keep the stomach, that therein shall breed no evil quality of humors. The
third Remedy is, our Pillolae aquilonae, which does evacuate the humor
hanging, always when it ingendereth in the stomach, they cleanse the head, and
are by their nature against all sorts of pains. And thus with these three
Medicines, every one may preserve himself from that infirmity, as it is daily
proved, and seen in Venice, and in diverse other places in Italy.

CHAP. XL. The cure of a certain Gentleman that was troubled with the Gout, and
a great Stitch in his side.
THe Cure of this man was with these five Remedies following, that is, with our
Aromatico, Quinta essentia solutiva, Pillole angelica, Oleo incompostibile, and
Quinta essenti Vegitabile: For you shall understand, that our Aromatico takes
away the pains of the Stomach, so that the other Medicines may work their
operations the better. Our Quinta essentia solutiva, takes away the cause of
the infirmity, and the Pills take away the evil quality. The Unction takes
away the pain: And the Vegitabile Quintessence, preserves them that it comes
not again. The Dia Aromatico must be taken in the morning fasting, the dose is.
ii. at once. The Quinta-essentia solutiva you shall take with broth of a Capon
and Sugar fasting, without any observations, the dose is two or three drachms
at a time. Our Pillole Angelica you shall take two hours before supper, the
dose is from i. to. ii. The Unction you shall anoint after Supper upon the
sore places, so often until the pain be gone. Our Vegitabile Quintessence you
shall drink every morning half an ounce, and thus continuing thou shall be
perfectly whole by Gods help.

CHAP. XLI. A Discourse upon the Sciatica, and his remedy.
THe Sciatica is so called, because it is upon the bone which is called Scio,
and of that it takes the name Sciatica, the which is caused of an evil
quality in the Stomach and Liver, the which you may see by the cure; for if ye
cure the Stomach, and help the Liver, the Sciatica will cease, and by this
means thou may see whether I say the truth or no. Seeing then that the
Sciatica is caused as is said before, ye shall understand that it is so caused,
by reason that the stomach cannot well digest that which it should, and so it
causes crude and undigested humors, of the which Nature would be discharged,
he casts them forth of the stomach, and having no other way to come forth of
the Stomach but by the ordinary ways, they do pass, and of force they must
pass by those powers that pass by the Liver, and so the Liver which is able
both to resolve the good and the evil quality, remains still infected of
that indisposition, and not being able to digest them according unto the order
of Nature, they ingross and become malign, and then Nature the which with all
industry would discharge himself of that burden, sending them to the higher
parts, sends them downwards, and when they come unto Scio, where they must
pass with difficulty by certain small muscles, they ingrosse in that place,
and cause inflammation and pain, the which Inflammation or swelling, after the
body is well purged, is resolved with Vesicatores Ventosos, and attractive
Cerots and such like things. Also attractive Glisters are most wholesome,
because they discharge the humor in the lower parts, and comfort the Sciatica.
Nevertheless, ye shall understand that there are certain and true appropriate
Medicines to resolve it with brevity, the which are these that follow. First,
when the Patient is in most extreme pain, let him blood under the tongue, the
which is such a singular remedy, that it causes the world to wonder thereat:
after that purge him with our Soluble Sirrup, six or seven days, that being
done, take away the water which causes the pain, then comfort the Patient with
the Oil that is separated from the flower of flowers, and distilled in a
Retort, then all this being done, the Patient shall remain helped to thy great
honor. And therefore he that will cure the Sciatica, it were necessary that
he consider well of the nature and quality of the infirmity, and when they
are satisfied to be the Sciatica, in that case cure them according to this our
Order, the which by the grace of God, and virtue of these Medicines, they shall
remain helped of that indisposition, for this is a great Secret.

CHAP. XLII. Of the Pains of the Mother.
THe Pains of the Mother which women are troubled withal, is an alteration in
the Matrix, that may come of diverse causes, as of cold, of moistness, of
dryness, of melancholic humors, of phlegmatic, and of choleric, the which is
to be proved diverse ways. Nevertheless, I will show thee the Secret to cure
it generally, and the order is thus. You shall give the Patient a dose of
Pillolae Aquilonae fasting, and sleeping thereon one sleep, for these Pills do
purge the Matrix, then take Electuario Angelica half an ounce, which purges
the blood and choler: That being done, take Cantharides in powder i.
Galingale, and the roots of Mercury, ana. di.. mix them altogether, and put it
into a little piece of Sarcenet, and bind it like a button, and put it into
the Matrix as high as you can, and there let it remain four and twenty hours
without moving of it, for it purges divinely; and herewith thou may cure any
great impediment in the Matrix: That being done, they shall use our Sirrup
against the pains of the Mother, the which comfort and purges all humors
in the body that offend the Mother: And this is a great secret which was found
out by me. You shall understand, that whosoever would know the truth of this
disease, it were necessary for him to be expert in Philosophy, because it is
an operation of natural things, the which cannot be well understood without
great knowledge in natural Philosophy.

CHAP. XLIII. Of the pains in the head.
THe pain in the Head is a disease of the brains, which is caused of putrified
humors in the stomach, the which is like unto a pot that boileth, causing the
vapors to ascend, which if they be evil, the fume is evil to the taste and
smell; but if there boil any good thing therein, the fumes are pleasant both to
the smell and taste. And so likewise our stomach being filled with good juice,
fills the brain with good fumes; but being filled with evil corrupt humors,
it hurts the brain, and causes pains of the head. The like pains of the head
may come of alteration of the blood, and to help that accident, you must first
remove the cause principal, which is done with purging, and evacuating of the
stomach of those putrified humors; which thou shall do with our Aromatico,
giving it to the Patient two or three times, every five days once. The dose is
ii. and then the pain will cease, of what cause soever it do come; this done,
take the juice of a Beet root one ounce, Oil of bitter Almonds one dram; mix
them well together, and snuff it up into the nose every morning until it come
into the mouth, for this does purge the head marvellously; this being done, it
would be " good to take our Soluble Sirrup four or five mornings cold, and so
the Patient shall be helped.

CHAP. XLIV. Of deafness of the Ears.
Deafness in the Ears do proceed of diverse causes, as of a Catarre, cold, and
humiditie of the head. But of what cause soever it come, I will show thee a
true secret to cure them quickly. First purge them eight or ten days with our
Sirupo Magistrale, and then take our Pillole Aquilone, three times, and then
perfume them five mornings with this: Take Synabar. i. Olibanum, and Myrrh, ana
one scruple, mix them and divide it in five parts, the which you shall occupy
at five times, standing over them with your mouth open, that the fume may enter
in, for it dries and resolves the evil humors in the head that himder the
hearing; and thus doing thou shall be helped. Nevertheless, it would be good to
put the fat of a silver Eel into the ear, which has a principal virtue to
comfort the hearing. Also our Aqua balsami being put into the ear, comfort
the sight and hearing marvellously, and all impediments in the head, and evil
humors it destroys through his quality and nature, and augmenteth the good,
in such order that using of it thou shall see great marvells: for these are the
true secrets for that disease.

CHAP. XLV. Of the Infirmities of eyes, and their causes and cures.
THe Infirmities of the Eyes comes of diverse and sundry causes, of the which I
will make mention, especially of those that are of most importance, and most
dangerous to hurt the sight. There is one that is called in Italian Razoni, and
that is caused of the heat of the blood, and his effects are certain small
wheals that run round about the eyelids, and this Infirmity is of small
importance, for only with linament of Tutia they may be healed, anointing
them three or four times. There is another kind of infirmity in the eyes that
comes to many, and is caused of moisture and heat in the head, and that is a
redness with watering and great burning: And although this be troublesome, yet
it is not dangerous to heal. For with purging the head and body, and with
Boxing glasses, and with certain Unctions appropriate they shall remain whole.
There is another kind of infirmity in the eye, and that is when the ball of
the eye waxes out of measure in greatness, and this is called Dilatatio
pupillae, the which is very hard to heal. For my part I never saw but one
remedy that did preserve it, and that is our Balsamo Artificiato, of the which
you shall put every night one drop into the eye, and it will do thee great
pleasure, because it is temperate hot, and has a penetrative virtue and
resolutative, by the which means it does hinder the relaxation, and preserves
the eye. There is yet another sort of infirmity that causes the eye to be
full of pain, and comes all thick and filthy, and blinds it, and this
indisposition is caused of Morbo Gallico; and although it seem foul and
uncurable: Nevertheless, it is easy to be cured if you help the principal
cause, and fume the head with Cinabar, Myrrh, and Olibanum, they shall be
quickly helped. There is another infirmity that comes in the eye, the which
is a cloud that ingendereth in the point of the eye upon the ball, and
hinders the sight, and that is easy to be helped, for if you drop therein
one drop of our Balm twenty or thirty days together, it will resolve it
thoroughly. There are diverse other infirmities which do trouble the eyes, the
which I will let pass till another time.

CHAP. XLVI. Of the pains in the Teeth.
THe pain of the teeth is an accidental disease, which comes of diverse and
sundry causes, of the which causes, I will show the chiefest. It comes
sometimes of a Rheum in the head, or of a Catarr, or of humiditie in the head,
and diverse other ways. Nevertheless, let it come which way it will, it
proceeds of the head and stomach, the wihch sends up vapors, and then fall
down again, and cause that pain, and the remedy is this: First, give them our
Magistrale Syrupo five or six days, the which purges the blood, and
evacuateth the body; that being done, take our Electuario angelico, three
times according to the receipt, for this evacuateth the stomach and purges the
head; and then take our Aqua reale, and hold it in thy mouth a Paternoster
while, and then spit it forth again, and with this order thou shall help all
manner of pains in the teeth, except they be rotten stumps; and then the best
way is to take them forth with an Instrument: but if thou will not take them
forth and ease the pain, thou may touch them with Aqua fortis until the
marrow be mortified? that being done, you shall hold our Aqua balsami two or
three times in your mouth in a day, until the pain be gone, and so with this
order thou may keep them without pain. Also I will show thee another easy
way. Take Henbane seed, and mix it with white Wax, then cast it on the coals,
and hold thy mouth over it to receive the fume, and then thy pain will cease if
they be rotten teeth; and this it does by stupefaction. Also it will be good to
hold in thy mouth Mastick, Pellitorie, and Allom, after ye have purged, for
this draws down the matter.

CHAP. XLVII. Of a stinking breath.
THe stinking breath is a putrefaction the which is caused of the stomach,
being corrupted and foul, as you may see by experience of those that have that
infirmity, and the remedy is this. You shall give them of our Aromatico. ii.
fasting, every third day for three times, and then use our Quintessence for a
month continually; The dose is. i. every morning, and after supper two hours,
for this comfort the stomach and the heart, and takes away the stinking:
That being done, take five or six mornings together, every morning f oil of
Turpentine one scruple with white Wine, and so they shall remain helped.

CHAP. XLVIII. Of spitting of blood.
THe spitting of blood is an alteration of blood in the veins, which alteration
is so much, that Nature provokes it to the stomach, from whence it had his
Original, and does not come of a vein broken as many have said, as thou may
well see the truth; for if the vein were broke, the blood would come forth at
one time or instant without any tarrying, and they would die quickly, the which
comes not by spitting of blood, for they spit none until the alteration
comes: and this is caused of a kind of Fever that comes inwardly, that
ingendereth that alteration, and when his fit comes, the blood does alter, and
the veins swell, and the blood does come forth at the proper mouths of the
veins, and so they spit it forth; and when they spit blood, it is the beginning
of the Fever Hectic. the which when it is confirmed, is uncurable and mortal:
But if thou will take it at the beginning when they spit blood, it may be
helped with ease, and that thou shall do with giving them three or four times
of our Petra Philosophale twelve grains, with half an ounce of Sugar Rosate,
every third day once; that being done, let him take every morning Oil of
Vitriol iiii. grains, with Julep of Violets. i. because there is no better
medicine in the world that disposes the alteration of the blood, then our
Petra Philosophale, and the oil of Vitrial mittigateth the heat and
extinguisheth the accident. You shall note, that this which I have written is
not understood of many as I understand it. And likewise the Medicines to use in
that case has not been put in practice of any man, and the cause is this. That
since Physic has been in use until this time, the Physicians have not
understood of other then the Theorick, and none they cured of practice and
experience, and that is the cause that so few have found the truth. But I that
continually do travel in practice, have found rare things, as I will set
forth to the world hereafter.

CHAP. XLIX. Of diseases of the Liver.
THe sickness of the Liver is caused of diverse and sundry accidents of the
body, as you may see by experience, when a man is never so little sick, by and
by the Liver is alterated, and does no more work well, and that is because the
Liver is the receptacle of the blood and of the Gall, and the master which
rules and governs our bodies, and distributeth the blood into the veins, and
does purify it, separating the sharp and evil parts, and sending it to a
certain bladder, which we call the Gall; and when it is so full that it can
receive no more, it runs over, and so causes the body to become yellow, and
thereupon the Urine is yellow, and is so evil, that in short time it dries
that body, so that the Liver being dispensator both of the good and bad
qualities of the humors, it cannot be but through the infirmities of the
body. Also when the Liver is over hot and dry, it causes the Patient to be
lean and dry, and with great heat: and when the Liver is troubled with
humiditie and cold, it causes the Patient to become full of sores and scabbs,
and these are the effects that come of the Liver when it is distempered. But if
thou will help it from that indisposition, it were necessary to evacuate the
body and stomach of superfluous humors, which thou shall do with our Soluble
Sirrup, giving it eight or ten days together cold, and then purge the Stomach
with our Aromatico fasting in the morning; that being done, you shall use
remedies that help the Liver, which a^ many, as Citrake, Liverwort,
Scolopendria, Cycorie, and such like; and so observing this order thou shall
help them. For I have had an infinite of experience of it.

CHAP. L. Of diseases of the Lungs.
THe infirmities of the Lungs are of two kinds, that is cold and moist, and
hot and dry, the which infirmity is caused of evil temperature of the body.
You shall note, that when the Lungs is infected with cold and moist, it will
easily turn to that kind of Hectic that causes the Cough, and to spit matter
at the mouth. But when it is grieved with heat and dryness, it is in danger to
turn to a Tissick, the which disease causes a man to become lean and dry,
and keeps back his breath, and so the one with another they are mortal
diseases, so that there can scarce be found any remedy; and therefore I will
begin with the first kind, and then with the second, and then the third, and
then with the fourth and last, for the which there is no redemption or hope of
life. But for the first and second, there are a number of remedies that do
help, the which be these. First, give the Patient of the juice of the Roots of
blew Lillies, ii. with Mel Rosarum,. i. in the morning fasting, and that use
three times, every third day once: That being done, let him use our Elixar
vitae for thirty or forty days together morning and evening; the dose is.
ii. at a time, and also put therein every time half an ounce of our Magno
liquore, and drink it a little warm, for this is a perfect remedy, with
which I have cured an infinite number in my days. And of all the Medicines
that ever I found, I never had any like this, because the juice of the
Lilly-root has virtue attractive that mundifieth the stomach, and the Elixar
vitae comfort and resolves all Ulcers in the Lungs, and the Magno liquore
dissolveth the Catarr, and heals the stomach, for I have proved it a number
of times, as is said before. I remember me that in the year of our Lord, 1557.
I being in Rome cured a young man which was a Painter, that was in the house of
the Cardinal de Medici, the which had his Lungs ulcerated, and did spit great
quantity of blood, and had a great Catarr and Cough, and did spit also matter,
in the which there was no hope of life. I caused him to use the aforesaid
remedies, and so in short time he was helped, and not only he, but a great
number more at sundry times.

CHAP. LI. Of the Spleen.
THe Spleen is never sick but through other diseases, as you may see by
experience, how that those that have the Fever Quartane, for the most part have
their Spleen alterated and hard, and this proceeds of evil temperature of
the body and Liver, that cannot digest the humors, and so Nature sends them
forth in the weakest parts that are most apt to receive them. So that the
Spleen is like a sponge, and very apt to receive that humiditie, that Nature
cannot dissolve otherwise, and so by this reason it is most apt to be sick or
diseased: therefore if thou will cure it, first cure the disease which causes
that alteration, for that being once helped, Nature of it self will help the
Spleen without any other Medicine, and therefore strive not to help the Spleen
with particular Medicines, for it is vain; but look what kind of disease the
Patient is troubled with, and cure that, and then the Spleen will heal well
enough. And this is the true way to cure the Spleen.

CHAP. LII. Of the Flux of the body.
THe Flux of the body is a distemperature of the guts and stomach, which is
caused also of an evil disposition in the Stomach, as well as of all other
interiours, and is very troublesome to the Patient, and hard to be helped.
Nevertheless, I will show thee a secret and that is this. Take of our Petra
Philosophale twelve grains, which does evacuate the humor hanging, and
dissolveth the Flux. But when it is a hot Flux with a Fever in the Summer, let
him stand two hours after supper in a bath of salt water of the Sea that is
cold: for it is of great effect. You shall understand, that our Petra
Philosophale must be taken with Sugar Rosote di.. Also when you have done the
aforesaid things, you shall take our Sirrup against the melancholy humors five
or six mornings. And so using this order, thou shall help any kind of cruel
Flux, as I have proved infinite times.

CHAP. LIII. Of Costivenesse in the body.
THis disease is caused of great dryness and adustion in the body, through the
which cause there comes many diseases: and that is, that our meat lies long
in the body: and of that comes indisposition of the stomach, pains in the
head, Flux of Urine, alteration of blood, augmenting of choler, and such like.
Therefore if thou will help these inconveniences, it were necessary to seek the
principal cause, and to cause the body to be loose: and that thou shall do
with our Sirrup Magistrale, using it according to reason every morning. For it
evacuateth the lower parts, and cools the Liver, and purges the blood, and
consumes choler, and helps digestion. And with this only shall thou help
them perfectly.

CHAP. LIVE. Of the Flux of Urine.
THe Flux of Urine is an alteration of the pores, and opening of the reins,
caused of indigestion in the body, as you may see by experience. This Flux
weakeneth the stomach, and the reins, and takes away the taste, and lets
sleep: so that many times of these effects come cruel diseases, as Gonorhea,
the Strangury, Ulcerations in the Yeard, and such like: and therefore if thou will help the aforesaid disease, use this Medicine. Let him take of our
Aromatico two drachmes, and drink thereon a little water, and then let him use
of this Sirrup every morning warm. iiii. Take Sage, Carduus Benedictus,
Egrimony, Betony, Citrake, Scolopendria, Cicorie, of each one handful, red
Saunders, Box, ana. iiii. Alloes, Epatick, Coloquintida, Sin, Turbit,
Hermodactiles, ana. i. course Sugar one pound and a half, commom Honey one
pound: then lay all the aforesaid things to infuse in five and twenty pound of
White wine the space of twelve hours: then boil them close until half be
consumed: then strain it without expression, and put thereto a carrect of Musk
dissolved in, iiii. of Rosewater: and of this take every morning three or four
ounces, and fast thereon at the least four or five hours, and in the mean time
that you use this Sirrup, you shall not eat Hogs flesh, nor Fish, nor salt
things, nor Rapes, nor Raddish, nor Parsley, nor any other aperative thing: This
being done, take Hysop of the Mountain that is dried lb. ii. and boil it in
thirty pound of White wine, and put thereto one pound of Honey, letting them
boil till the fourth part be consumed, and then strain it, and drink it
continually for fourteen or fifteen days. And by this means thou shall have
help God willing.

CHAP. LV. A discourse upon the retention of Urine, and his cure.
THe causes of the retention of Urine are many, among the which, there are
three principally above the rest, and are so manifest, that every one may
understand them: and are these. Stones, as well great, as gravel, viscosity in
the Reins and Bladder, and alteration in the pores: And thus through those
three accidents, most commonly they cannot make water: the which if thou will
help, it will be somewhat hard, because you must understand the cause thereof,
the which is not easily done of every man: for he that knows not the cause,
can less help the effect, and he that knows not the effect, can less help
them. And therefore, I say, he that will help those that cannot make water,
because of the stone in the bladder, he must seringe them to take forth the
Urine: but if thou will help those that cannot make water through the gravel,
you shall give them our Pillole Aquilone: and then give them a Flintstone made
in fine powder, to drink with water of Saxifrage, and thou shall see thereof
miracles. And if thou will help them that cannot make water, because of
viscosity, give them our Aromatico, and anoint the reins with our Balsamo
Artificiato, and also his Testicles, and so by these means you shall help them
quickly of that accident: as I have proved diverse times.

CHAP. LVI. Another discourse upon the retention of Urine; and his remedies.
THe retention of Urine is caused diverse ways, as by overmuch heat, or
overmuch cold, or through too much dryness, or too much moistness. And
therefore he that will cure this infirmity, must first know the cause, and also
the virtue and quality of his Medicines wherewith he will cure them: for if he
do otherwise, he shall walk in the dark, and be as a Diviner: for many have
written receipts, wherewith they show to help many infirmities, without giving
any reason at all. But to the purpose of the retention of Urine, as as I have
said, that it may come through four principal causes. So will I show it in
four Chapters, and also their remedies wherewith they may be helped.

CHAP. LVII. Of the retention of Urine that comes through heat, and his
remedies.
THe retention of Urine which comes through heat, is that which ingendereth
the stone and gravel, for through that superfluous heat it ingendereth. And
this is one of the four causes of the retention of Urine, the which is helped
with Instruments and Medicines concerning the stone. The most certain Medicine
is, to be cut and take it forth. Nevertheless, there are many Medicines that
may pleasure them of our invention: As concerning the gravel, there are many
things that dissolve it, of the which I have spoken of in diverse places: As
concerning the remedy of the cause, that is easy: for by purging the stomach
and the body, the heat will be dissolved, and the body left in good
temperature. And the purging of the body shall be done with our Sirrup against
the melancholy humor, and to use our Aromatico, and Electuario Magistrale, de
Althea with Sulphur. And thus much concerning that heat.

CHAP. LVIII. Of the retention of Urine through cause of dryness, and his
Medicine.
THe retention of Urine through dryness, is, because the Reins and the
Conduits where it passes are to much dried, and that dryness is cause of
adustion of the Liver, the which must be helped with taking away a little
blood: and to purge the body with Cassia, Sirrup de Pomis, de Succuria, de
Lactutia, de Malvis, de Siterache, and such like, that cool and take away the
adustion of the Liver: then anoint the Reins, the Members, and Yeard with
Hogs grease, because that fat does mollify and moisten: and give him to drink
Sero lactis, because that inlargeth and moisteneth, and provokes Urine without
burning.

CHAP. LIX. Of the retention of Urine that comes through cold, and his
remedies.
THe alteration of Urine that comes through cold, is that kind which makes a
man that he cannot make water, without the help of some warm thing laid upon
the body, and upon the bottom of the belly, and the cure thereof is to vomit
those cold humors out of the stomach, and to purge the body with solutives of
warm Nature, and with warm Decoctions, with the Decoction of Lignum Sanctum, of
Carduus Benedictus, and of Rosemary, and annoint the back with our Oleum
Philosophorum, de Terebinthina, and Cera,, or Oil of Frankincence, or such
like things that warm the coldness. And so by these means the Patient shall be
helped of that retention of Urine.

CHAP. LX. Of the retention of Urine through cause of moistness, and his
remedy.
THe retention of Urine caused of humidity, is that which causes the pores to
swell through moistness, so that the Urine cannot pass, as those say, which
are troubled with the carnosity: which carnosity is not alteration of the pores
through cause of humidity. For the way to cure this kind of retention, is to
purge the body with drying Medicines, as Turbite, Scamonie, Euforbium,
Eleborus, and such like: and to use drying Unctions, as Vnguento de
Lithargirio, or Balsamo, water of Frankincence, Oleum Benedictum of our
invention, and such like things, and then eat dry meats; and drink good Wine;
and thus the humidity shall be dissolved: So that hereby every one may have the
understanding of the cause, and the effect of the same, and the Medicines.

CHAP. LXI. Of the difficulty of Urine, and of what it is caused, with the
order to cure it.
THere are diverse kinds of difficulty of Urine, and are also caused of diverse
causes, as aforesaid, of the which one is caused of a corrupt humor of the
French Pox, and this is one of the chiefest causes that may be in that matter.
For we see manifestly, that the said kind of infirmity corrupts the blood,
ingendereth evil qualities in the Liver, and distempereth all the body of
those that are troubled therewith. Also we may see, that those which are
infected with that kind of disease, most commonly have Warts, or Carvoli,
Pellaria, Botches, Scabs, Tumors, pains of the Stomach, in the Arms and
Legs, with a number of other more strange accidents that come through that
disease, But when that infirmity infecteth inwardly, it works these effects:
It brings Emeroides, pains in the Entrals, Fluxes of the body, continual
spitting, Gonorrea, or running of the Reins, such like effects. All the which
cause difficulty of Urine, of the which difficulty, there uses to engender the
Stone, Gravel, Viscosity, Stitch in the side, and diverse other mischiefs very
hurtful unto the body. The difficulty of Urine may also be caused of diverse
other infirmities, as of a rotten Catarre, descention of the head, of the evil
quality of the Liver, and such like, as by excessive cold, or heat of the
Reins, but let it be as it will, I know these are hard matters to be helped,
because it behooveth certain manual practice in that faculty, the which I
cannot show in writing: although I have great and high secrets for that
indisposition, as concerning the Physic part, the which thou may find in
diverse places of my works. Nevertheless, because I will not leave this Chapter
unperfect, I will here name unto thee a most excellent rare man of that
Profession, the which is both Doctor and Knight, and is most excellent in
cutting out the Stone, and the Rupture, and can remedy the great difficulty of
Urine, and heal the Rupture, and heal the infirmities of the eyes, and such
like things most excellently, and his name is called Prastecio Stelin
Venetiano: the which is at this present dwelling in Venice. And this I have
written of that Doctor, because he is one of the most excellent that may be
found in that Art.

CHAP. LXII. To help those that have great burning of their Urine.
THis infirmity may come of diverse and sundry causes. Nevertheless, I will
treat of some of the principal, and of most importance; and also will show the
true order to help them with ease and brevitie. The first cause assigned by me
is the Stone in the Bladder, and this is in a manner uncurable. The second
cause is, the running of the Reins, the which is taken by companying with women
corrupted with the Pox. The third cause is, the proper French Pox, the which is
that kind that is called Gonorrea. The fourth kind is a certain corruption that
is called Stranguria, the which moves continually to make water. The fifth
cause is the Gravel: there are also other causes, as scorching in the Yeard,
carnositie, and such like things, the which I will leave for troubling of the
Reader. The first cause which is the Stone, is helped by two remedies, the one
is with cutting and taking it forth of the bladder, the other remedy is
written in this book. The remedy for that which is caused by the running of
the Reins, shall be to take three mornings our Aromatico, because it resolves
that heat, and extinguisheth the burning. The remedy for that which is caused
of Gonorrea, is none other then to cure the principal disease, and to anoint
them with our Vnguento magno, and perfume them, and so they shall remain whole.
That which is caussed of the Strangurie, is cured by great purging, and by
taking oftentimes our Aromatico. That which is caused of the Gravel, is cured
by taking oftentimes our Electuario Angelica, and using to drink Wine
distilled with Cherrie stones, and Medler stones. That which comes through
carnositie, is cured with an Unguent made of oil of Sulphur, and Vitriol, Aqua
reale, Oil of Frankincense, and new Wax, all Medicines devised by us, giving
you charge, that before you begin to cure them, to seek out the right cause
from whence it proceeds, and so thou shall help it with brevitie and great
ease.

CHAP. LXIII. A Discourse upon the carnositie in the Yeard, and the Order to
cure it.
ALthough we have something touched this Infirmity before in the Chapter of
the burning of the Urine. Nevertheless, in this place, I mean, something to
discourse thereof, because that Chirurgions may not be void of such a noble
Secret, to do them honor in their cure of the like disease, for there are
many troubled with that infirmity: You shall understand, that this carnositie
is an infirmity whose original depends of the corruption of the French Pox,
and to show it plainer, it is an Ulcer in the neck of the bladder where the
Urine enters into the Yeard. And therefore, if thou will help that infirmity,
cure the principal disease, and the carnositie will heal; but if thou will
cure them with the Candle, take that Unguent which is written for the
carnositie in the Chapter of the burning of the Urine; but if thou will cure
the principal disease, give him three times, Pillole aquilone, and then take
our Sirrupo Solutivo, ten or twelve days together; that being done, let him
take twenty days the Wine of Lignum Sanctum, written hereafter in this Book,
and those which understand not this Chapter well, let him look over this Book,
and he shall find those Medicines with their Uses.

CHAP. LXIIII. Another Cure for the said Carnositie.
THat Carnositie which hinders the Urine that it cannot come forth, is a
certain kind of matter that is ingendered in the mouth of the bladder as is
showed before, the which is like in all points unto the Emeroids, that come in
the neck of the Intestivall about the Fundament, and because it is a gross
matter and ulcerated, the Urine passes with great difficulty, and great
burning and pain unto those that are troubled therewith, the which
inconvenience if thou will help, it were necessary that the body were well
purged, and that they keep a diet, and drink the decoction of Hypericon, with
a little Honey, and use to eat dry meats, and then make certain small long
Candles with Wax, and Frankincense, like unto searing Candles, then make this
Unguent. Take red Lead, white Honey, of each an ounce, fresh Butter two ounces,
white Wine as much as will suffice to incorporate all the aforesaid together in
a liquid form, then boil it on a soft fire, and have ready ten or twelve
quills fresh pulled out of the wing of a fat Pigeon; and note that when ye take
them forth of the wing, that they may be full of blood in the ends, then take
one of the quills and stir the said Unguent upon the fire continually while it
boileth, and when one quill is dried take another, and so do until the wine
be consumed, then take it from the fire and keep it, and when ye will occupy
it, take one of those Candles, and upon the end put the said Unguent, and put
it into the Yeard until it touch the carnosity, and this do from time to time
until the Candle pass without pain, and then the Patient shall be whole; for
this is a great Secret and has been proved many times.

CHAP. LXV. A Discourse as concerning those that cannot hold their water, and
his Remedy.
THis Impediment comes of two principal causes, the one is, through heat and
moisture of the body, and this is commonly in young children, which commonly
do be piss themselves, because they are by Nature hot and moist. The other
cause is through opening of the Pores where the Urine does pass; the which are
so stretched or opened, that they cannot retain the Urine, because the Urine is
a voluntary motion, and a natural motion together, they are hard to agree
together, because the natural motion makes his voluntary motion; so that
Nature first moves the man, and thereof comes the motion; for if a man would
make water, and that Nature does not move the motion, he cannot piss; for
sometime Nature does not give his natural motion because of some impediment,
for when a man cannot hold his water, it is a sign that Nature has no
retention; and to redress the same, it were necessary to reduce Nature into
good temperature, so that it may retain the Urine; the which thing thou shall
do with purging the body, and the stomach wherein is the matter that causes
that retention of Urine. And to purge the body you shall use our Sirrup
against the melancholy humor: And to purge the stomach, you shall take our
Electuario angelica, and to restrain the pores, you shall use the decoction of
wild Hysop, with the powder of Mastick, for you shall understand, that the
purging takes away the cause, and the decoction of Hysop with the Mastick,
does restrain the pores, and so by these means thou shall remedy quickly that
infirmity.

CHAP. LXVI. To break the Stone in the Bladder and also the Gravel, and to
cause it to avoid by Urine.
THere is found a certain bird called Solone, of Albertus Magnus in his Book of
Secrets; the which birds are very plenteous in Rome, and are called Palmum
bellae, and in Lumbardie, Sassarvoli, the which in English I suppose, is called
a Ring Dove, or Wood-colver, or the Stock Dove, which Birds are subject to the
Stone, that if you keep them in a Cage, and feed them with such meat as they
commonly use, being deprived of their medicine, within the space of four or six
months at the most, there will engender a Stone in the belly so great, that
their meat cannot pass through them, and so choaketh them, and they die, and
that is because the poor Bird cannot go and help himself with that Medicine
which Nature has taught her. For those that are at liberty in the field, fly
unto the Seaside, and there they find a certain kind of small stone very hard,
the which stone has virtue to dissolve the stone in the body of the Bird, and
this Bird knows it by the instinct of Nature, and eats great abundance of
them, and so dissolveth the stone in their bellies, and live a long time after
it without any trouble of the Stone. You shall understand, that this stone is
unpossible to be found in any other place, then in the belly of the said bird,
because they are very little, and man's reason cannot discern them from other
Stones, the which being beat in powder, with the flowers of Elders, and
Cinnamon, of each a like, and given to drink with broth, in short time it will
dissolve the Stone, and cause them to avoid it with their Urine most
miraculously: But if you ask me the reason, I know not what I shall answer, but
I hold it to be his proper hidden quality and virtue. For truly this I have
taught to many, and have seen the experience thereof sundry times, and it
cured the most part that did use it. For truly the virtue of Stones are very
great unto those that know them. I saw once two Stones in Rome of inestimable
virtue; The one was a round Coral like unto the Serpentine Purphire, but
therein was much green, and was of that virtue that being laid upon the flesh
of a man or woman, it causes them to piss great abundance, so that it were to
be wondered at. The other Stone was of Diasper, but bright and thorough shining
with certain white veins, and was of such virtue, that being laid on a wound,
presently the blood stenched so that there fell not down one drop, The which
Stones were in the hand of an old Spaniard, who said, he brought them out of
India, from Nova Hispania. I have seen also diverse and sundry Stones of most
strange virtues. You shall understand, that those Stones of the Bird must be
gotten in this order. You shall get a number of the said Birds, and take the
stones out of their bellies, and wash them clean, and keep them to thy use. The
quantity is as much as you can hold upon a Sixpence, as well of the Stones as
of the other matters: You shall drink the said quantity seven or eight
mornings together, and let your Diet be according, and drink good wine, and so
in short time you shall be helped.

CHAP. LXVII. Of the Gravel in the Reins.
THe Gravel (as is said before, is a disease of the Urine undigested, which is
caused of superfluous heat of the reins and blood, the which sometimes does
stay it self in the Conduites, and causes great pains; and sometimes it does
ingrosse so in the Bladder, that it lets the Urine, and this is an evil
disease to be troubled with, and the remedy is to purge often, and use that
water against the Gravel that is written in my discourse of Chirurgerie, for
it is one of the most excellent remedies that can be found for that disease;
and the order to use it is also written after the Receipt, and the best
Purgation that you can use for that purpose is our Pillole Aquilone.

CHAP. LXVIII. Of a certain Scab or Itch that comes over all the body.
THis Disease comes in all places of the body, and in Naples it is called
Prurito, and in Rome, Rosura; in Venice, Pizza; and in Spain, Lomezon: And it
is a salt humor that comes forth of the veins, and so disperseth through the
whole body between the flesh and the skin, and has in it such an heat, that
they cannot abide it, and is caused of alteration of the blood, the which is
corrupted and distempered; and the remedy is, to purge the stomach, and to
purify the blood, which thou shall do with giving them three times our
Pillole aquilone every third day once; that being done, make this Bath: Take
Nettles, Mallows, Pellitorie of the wall, Agrimonie, Sage, and Coleworts, ana.
lb. iiii. the Bran of Wheat almost a peck, common Ashes half as much: Mix them
altogether in a great kettle of water, and let it boil an hour, and then take
it from the fire and sit over it, and cover thee with clothes, that thou may
sweat an hour, then dry thee with warm clothes, and then wash all thy body
with pure Aqua vitae, and this thou shall use three times at the least, for the
oftener the better, and so thou shall be perfectly whole.

The Second Book of the Secrets of PHIORAVANTE.
CHAP. I. What Surgery is.
Surgery is a manual Art, with the which the Chirurgian does cure Wounds,
Ulcers, and Imposthumes: And this was found of Husbandmen, and Experimenters of
natural things. For there is no Art in the world, that has more need of the
knowledge of diverse things then this Art. It is also necessary to the knowledge
of natural things belonging to Surgery, to have skill in Husbandry. It is
also necessary to understand the Art of Painting, whereby you may set broken
bones in their places, and to join or close wounds well. It were needful also
to have skill in the Art of Joining, whereby he may make Instruments for broken
bones in the Arms, or Legs, or Hands, or other parts. It would be also
necessary to have the Art of a Smith, whereby he may make his Instruments. It
is chiefly needful to be expert in the Art of an Apothecary, to make his
Unguents. And last of all, it is most necessary to know the Art of Alchimie,
whereby he may distill his Oils and Waters appertaining unto Surgery. Also
it is necessary to have a good judgment, and to help in all causes of
Surgery, and to have a light hand in working. And when the Chirurgian is
expert in all the aforesaid things, he may help without any suspicion of any
thing. And hereafter I will show thee what Wounds, Ulcers, and Imposthumes are,
and all other things appertaining to Surgery, and the order to cure them: a
discourse grounded on true reason and approved by experience, showing to all
men, which are the true and perfectest Medicines, and which are false and
naught: writing and opening the true secrets of Surgery, with a new order
found out by me, to exercise the same Surgery with more ease and brevity, so
that every one may be satisfied: For they are true, and are Medicines, with the
which thou may do much good to the sick: and great honor will redound to
the Chirurgian, if he use it according to our order: for they are Medicines
proved of us infinite times in diverse places of the world, as well in the
Feilds as in the Cities, or on the waters* in the wars, where we healed
Wounds, Gunshot, Ulcers, Imposthumes, and other diseases appertaining unto
Surgery: and always (thanks be unto God) I have had good success, as it is
well known in most parts of Christendom. And so I make an end.

CHAP. II. The order to be used in curing Imposthumes of diverse sorts, taken
forth of the short discourse of the Surgery of this Author.
THere are diverse kinds of Imposthumes that come unto man's body, and are caused
of diverse and sundry accidents, and therefore they must be cured in diverse
orders, and with sundry Medicines, according to his nature: for some
Imposthumes are caused of contusions or bruised flesh: Some are certain
humors, of which Nature would discharge her self, and so sends them forth:
some are caused of cold; othersome are melancholy humors, and others are
caused of the Pox: And these are the kinds of Imposthumes that most commonly
do come, and I will show thee the order to cure them one by one, and then
after I will speak of that sort which is caused of contusions, because it is
bruised flesh: for every contusion does putrify and turn into matter, unto
which it were necessary to lay Ma^ur^tives, and bring it to suppuration, and as
soon as thou perceivest there to be any matter, then presently lance it: and
his Medicine shall be the yeolk of an Egg mixed with our Magno liquore, and
with that dress it as well within as without, without any other thing, for it
will help any great Tumor: but you must make your Unguent fresh every day, and
with new Eggs. Furthermore, as concerning those Imposthumes that come through
the indisposition of Nature, and are certain Sborine (a word so called in
Italian) by which Nature would prevail: and those would be left unto Nature,
until such time as they break alone, and then thou shall dress them with this
Unguent. Take Oil of Roses. vi. Litarge of gold finely ground, Turpentine,
ana. ii. Storax liquida. i. New Wax. iii. boil them on a soft fire until it
be black, which if it be too hard, you may put thereto oil of Roses, and make
it in form of an Unguent, and therewith dress those kinds of Imposthumes: and
lay thereon the Cerotte of dia Palma, and so with these Medicines thou shall
work miracles. As concerning these Imposthumes that are caused of cold, you
shall use hot Medicines and attractive, as the Cerotte called Oxicroxi, which
is a perfect Medicine in these kinds of Imposthumes: also our Balsamo
artificiato, and Aqua balsamo, and such like things which are by nature
temperate hot, are very convenient. But those Imposthumes that have their
original of the French Pox, are evil and malign, because their original is
malign and evil. The cure of these is with great purging, and to let the
Imposthume increase of it self, and when it is ready to lance, then lance
it, and make this Medicine. Take Vnguento magno. ii. Magno liquore. i.
Precipitate di.. mix them well together, and therewith dress the Imposthume,
and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerotte, and it will be perfect whole in short
time: Letting you to understand, that in all the aforesaid cures, if you will
cure them perfectly, it were necessary that the body were well purged of those
corrupt humors that hinder the cure, and to use defensives appropriate to that
kind of Imposthume: as the oil of Frankincense, of Turpentine, of Wax, of Honey,
Aqua vitae, and such like, which every one is a sufficient defensive,
anointing it round about the Imposthume: And hereafter I will show thee the
cure of these Imposthumes particularly by themselves.

CHAP. III. What Imposthumes are.
IMposthumes are certain Tumors or swellings, that come in diverse parts of the
body: the which are caused of blood and choler putrified, which cannot pass
through the pores, and therefore ingrosse in that place, and so comes to
putrefaction, and that is an Imposthume: which thou shall help in this order.
First purge the body to take away the humors which would go to the
Imposthume: which thou shall do with our Magistrale Sirrup, taking it eight
days together: that being done, give him our Aromatico: this being done, thou
shall quickly help the Imposthume, as I will show thee hereafter, with their
perfect cure.

CHAP. IV. Of Imposthumes that come in the Groine.
THe Imposthumes that come in the Groin are of three kinds, of which one is
called in Venice, Pannochi, and at Rome, Tinconie, and at Naples, Dragonello,
and in Spain, Incordio. To these after the body is purged, as is aforesaid, you
shall lay a Maturative plaster, the which is made thus. Take Marsh Mallows,
common Mallows, the mother of Violets, the leaves of Coleworts, Wheat flower,
Auxungia, Oil of Lillies, of each alike, and boil them together, and then
stamp them in form of an Ointment, and lay it on the Imposthume until it look
red and is soft, for then it ^s apt to be launced: Giving you charge, that when
you lance them you go not too deep; but only that the matter may come forth,
and then put therein a little tent, and anoint it with our Magno liquore, for
because it is the best Medicine that can be found for wounds: for it
mundifieth, incarnateth, and siccatrizeth without any other help, and lay upon
the Imposthume our Magistrale Cerot, and never change your Medicines until you
be whole; for this is the true secret found out by me to help these
Imposthumes, which I have proved infinite times.

CHAP. V. The second kind of Imposthume that comes in the Groin.
THe second kind of Imposthume in the Groin is called Glandulae, both this and
the aforesaid are caused of humors infected with the Pox, and these
Imposthumes seldom come to maturation; but if it do, it will be long first,
and it is evil to heal, because it requires great cure and terrible medicines.
But if thou will cure them perfectly, it were necessary to cure the principal
cause, and that is the Pox. But when these Imposthumes are broke, the best
remedy will be this. Take Wax, Litarge of gold; Oil of Frankincense, ana. and
boil them together until it become black: and therewith dress these
Imposthumes, for this is a perfect remedy, and a great Secret.

CHAP. VI. The third kind of Imposthume that comes in the Groin.
THe third kind of Imposthume that comes in the Groin, is caused of much
travel or heat of the blood, and these are called Anguinaglie, and they use to
come with a great accident of a Fever, cold and then hot, and in seven or eight
days at the most, they come to maturation, and then lance them, and his
medicine shall be this: Take Turpentine well washed, the yolk of an Egg, and
oil of Roses, as much of the one, as of the other, and mix them well together,
and with this only thou shall help them, because it digesteth the Imposthume,
and mundifieth and incarnateth with great speed; giving you great charge that
the body be well purged first with our Magistrale Sirupe.

CHAP. VII. Of Impostumes under the arms.
THese Impostumes are caused of gross and viscous humors, the which Nature
cannot digest by any other part, and these commonly are called Topinaxia,
because they are like to a Molehill. And although this seem to be a great
matter, yet it causes little pain, and may be helped with ease. First purge
the body with Soluble Medicines, and then lay on this plaster until it be
ripe. Take grated bread, leaven of bread, Cow Milk, Oil of Lillies, ana, and
boil them together and lay it on; for this has virtue attractive and
putrifactive, by means whereof it will bring it quickly to maturation; and
when it is ripe, open it with a lance, and dress it the first time with the
white of an Egg and Salt beaten together with a tent, and lay on a stopine wet
with the white of an Egg, the which thou shall let lie at the least four and
twenty hours, and then dress it with digestive until it be incarnated, and
then lay thereon a plaster of Dia aquilone magno di Mesue, and so thou shall
help them quickly.

CHAP. VIII. Of Impostumes in the throat.
THese Impostumes are of diverse and sundry kinds, as you may see by
experience; for some are Scrophule, others are melancholy humors, others are
caused of the Pox, and others are caused of heat, or of cold; the which are
all cured sundry ways, as I will show thee hereafter.

CHAP. IX. Of Impostumes in the throat caused of melancholy humors.
THese Impostumes in throat caused of melancholy humors are hard and crude,
and are long before they come to maturation, and you may not in any wise cut
them, because the place is full of Muscles, Arteries, Vene capillari,
Cartilagines, Sinnews, and such like; the which although there come an
Impostume there, it shall not hurt them; but if ye cut them with an Instrument
you may offend them greatly, and for that cause you may not cut them by any
means, but leave it unto Nature, the which will cause it to break, and then use
this remedy. First, you shall take our Sirrup against the melancholy humor
for twelve days, continually in the morning, fasting; that done, you shall
give him our Pillole Aquilone, and help the Impostumes with Vnguento negro di
Godfredo di m^^i, written in the Antidotary of Galen, Cap. 45. for that is
miraculous to help those kinds of Impostumes, as I have proved it diverse times.

CHAP. X. Of Impostumes in the throat coming of the Pox.
THe Impostumes that come in the Throat which are caused of the Pox, are
commonly of evil quality, because they are much alterated, and cause great
pain, and these likewise are dangerous to be cut for the aforesaid causes: but
when they are broken, they go creeping over the body, healing in one place,
and breaking out in another, and these are evil to be helped, for them that
know not the perfect secret, and the order to cure them is this. You shall give
them eight or nine mornings our Soluble Sirrup; that being done, you shall give
them our Aromatico twice, and then let them use Sarsa Parilia, or our wine of
Lignum vitae, and let them sweat ten or twelve days together, and then perfume
them with Sinabar, Myrrh, and Olibanum, the which fume you shall use only at
the mouth, and so thou shall help any crude kind of Imposthume coming in the
throat: for this Secret never fails, as I have proved diverse times.

CHAP. XI. Of Imposthumes in the throat coming of hot humors.
THese Imposthumes in the throat coming of superfluous heat, are caused of the
blood being alterated with heat, and because of that alteration, it ingendereth
gross vapors and viscous in Vena Capillari, the which through their grossnesse
and want of digestion cannot dissolve, and so engender that kind of Imposthume
in the throat, because in that place there is much blood, and less flesh then
in any other place, but yet these be not troublesome to help, and his cure is
thus: You shall purge him with aperative things, and refriscative that purge
the blood; and when the Imposthume is open, you shall dress it with a
digestive until it be mundified, and then dress it with Vnguentum de Tutia
until it be siccatrized: Also you shall cause them to keep diet ordinary, and
to drink no wine but only this drink: Take Citrake, Liver-wort, and
Scolopendria, ana a handful, Anniseed. i. common white-Honey one pound, then
put them all to infuse in four and twenty pound of fair water, and let it boil
until a third be consumed, and then strein it without expression, and keep it
in a glass close shut, and this shall be his common drink: but let him eat no
salt, nor slimie meats in any wise, neither Hogs flesh, nor other hot meats
that may alter the blood: And this doing you shall be quickly helped, for the
drink cools the blood, and purges it, and helps the Liver of all
infirmities, as I have proved diverse times.

CHAP. XII. Of Imposthumes in the throat caused of cold.
IMposthumes in the throat caused of cold humors are small and without pain,
and this goes creeping by little and little until such time as it breaks of
it self, and are an evil kind to help, because all Unguents are an enemy unto
them, and all cold meats. Therefore if thou will help them, let the Patient use
twenty days together our Quinta essentia solutiva, which purges all cold
humors, and warmeth the blood, and causes the Imposthume to heal with ease;
and when they are broken, you shall help them with our Balm artificial, which
does subtiliate the humors, and mundifie the Imposthume, and incarnate and
heal: And this Order of curing is effectual and of great profit for them that
shall use them. And of this opinion are many excellent Physicians, and chiefly
M. Decio an ancient man, who has been an experimenter a long time both in
Physic and Chirurgerie, with a number of others, which I will leave to name
until another time.

CHAP. XIII. Of Imposthumes in the throat coming of hot humors.
THese Imposthumes coming in the throat of hot humors, is a kind that comes
with redness, and causes great pain, with an accident of a Fever, and in
short time they come to maturation, and break, and then the matter will come
forth, and the pain will cease; and these kinds are not evil to heal, and the
remedies are these. As Soon as they are broke thou must press it out with thy
hand, that being done, you shall have Oleum Benedictum of our invention,
anointing the Imposthume within, and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerot, and so
thou shall help those kinds of Imposthumes. For this is our Secret never
written before of any man.

CHAP. XIV. Of Imposthumes in the Eyes.
IMposthumes in the eyes are like certain white bladders that come about the
nose, and the matter that is within them is like the white of an Egg, and these
are caused of humiditie and moistness of the head, and because they have a
conference with the head, they are evil to heal, for they turn to watering
Fistula's, which, when they come to Fistula's, continue for ever. But if thou will cure them perfectly that they never come again, you must first purge the
head with our Aromatico, and that you shall do every five days once for three
or four times; that being done, thou shall anoint the head with Oil of
Frankincense the space of a month, and into the eye where the Imposthume is,
thou shall put once a day one drop of our Balm artificial, which will help it
and dry the Imposthume, and so in short time thou shall be helped. For this is
the true Secret wherewith thou may help those Imposthumes, never known
before of any man, and they are much contrary to the Medicines of Mesue, by
which our Physicians now adays make their Medicines.

CHAP. XV. Of Imposthumes in the Ears.
IMposthumes in the ears are caused of cold and viscous humors, which
ingrosse in that part of the body, and cause great pain until such time as
they are broken, and these Imposthumes are evil to heal. Nevertheless, I will
show thee a Secret to take away the pains, and to help it quickly, and that is
thus. There is found a certain kind of shell in the Sea, the which is of the
length of an hand, and somewhat more, the which, in Venice, and in Istria, in
Dalmatia, in Puglia, and in diverse other places of the Adriatic Sea, are
called Asture, which is like unto a pair of bellows, the which has a certain
beard, like the hair of a man's head, and it has a certain attractive virtue,
that if they put it into the ear, presently they take away the pain, though it
be never so great or extreme: the which virtue comes through the saltness of
it. For this I have proved diverse times, and did learn it of our old Fishermen,
which knew it by experience. But if it chance that one be troubled and cannot
get that thing, they shall take Cantharides in powder, and put it into the
ear, the which will work the same effect, because they be attractive and
mundificative: And these are two natural remedies, found out by true
experience, and does more good then any other that I could find.

CHAP. XVI. Of Imposthumes in the Mouth.
THese Imposthumes are of diverse kinds, and may breed of diverse causes: but let
them come of what cause soever they will, they cause great pain to them that
have them, for that they cannot swallow their meat without pain. And therefore
I will show thee a general cure for all Imposthumes in the mouth, and that is
thus. You shall take our Pillole Aquilone twice: that being done, take our Aqua
balsami, and hold it in your mouth as long as you can, and this do three times
in a day: then take the juice of Beet roots. i. oil of bitter Almonds. i. then
snuff it up at the nose until it come into the throat: And thus doing, thou
shall help any Imposthume in the mouth, as I have proved diverse times. For the
Pills cleanse the head, and evacuate the stomach, and hinders the alteration,
the water of Balm does cure and mittigateth the pain, and the juice with the
Oil mundifieth those secret places at the nose and mouth.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Imposthumes in the Joints.
THese Imposthumes in the Joints are evil, and of hard and crude digestion,
because they are caused of great abundance of gross and viscous humors, the
which through their grossness cannot pass the Joints, and there remain and
come to Imposthume, and these cause extreme pain, because thereunto comes
great abundance of matter, and the remedy is thus. First give him a general
purgation, and let him blood on the common vein, and then lay on this plaster.
Take Marsh Mallows, common Mallows, Pellitory, and the Mother of Violets, and
boil them in water till it be consumed, then stamp them, and put thereto
Leaven of bread, Barley flower, Hens grease, and Hogs grease, according to thy
discretion, and set them on a small fire until they be incorporated, then lay
this on once a day until it be ripe, and when it is red and soft open it, and
dress it with our Magno liquore, and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerotte: and
so with these two thou shall help them, except the Imposthume be of the Pox,
for then it will do small good.

CHAP. XVIII. Of inward Imposthumes.
THese Imposthumes inwardly are evil to know, and uncertain to cure, because
the Patient himself cannot tell in what place they be, though he feel the pain:
and therefore all that we reason of in that matter, may be to the contrary. For
where a man cannot see with the eye, nor touch with the hand, the matter is
doubtful whether it be, or no^ and therefore it is best to say little, For
these Imposthumes may come of diverse causes, and yet cannot tell of what
certain cause, and therefore you cannot know which is the true Medicine to help
them: but by experience you may do them some good; For (as I said before)
Imposthumes never come but through distemperance of Nature, and alteration of
the blood. Therefore if thou will help them, help first the principal cause,
then give them eight or ten mornings our Magistrale Sirrup, and then take
twice, our Aromatico: that being done, use morning and evening our Vegitabile
Sirrup, and herewith thou shall help them.

CHAP. XIX. Of Ulcers, and what they are.
Ulcers are of diverse and sundry kinds, and are ingendered of many causes, as
hereafter I will show. But first I will write of those kinds of Ulcers that are
caused of Wounds. You shall understand, that wounds in what part of the body
soever they be, being imposthumated or cancrenated, they change their names,
and are no more called wounds, although their original was a wound. For when
it is cancrenated, it is called Vlcera corrosiva, because it goes eating and
creeping on the flesh: but when the wound is imposthumated and full of matter,
it is called Vlcera putrida, that is putrified, and it is because it is filthy
and stinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated, nor yet aposthumated, but
that through some evil disposition the wound is closed, and that there comes
in it evil qualities without alteration, then is it called Vlcera sordida,
because therein is evil quality, and it appears but little, but it is evil
to heal. There be other sorts of Ulcers also, which are caused of diverse and
sundry kinds of Tumors: and the most evil and mischeivious are those that are
of Tumors caused of the Pox: for unto those there run abundance of evil
humors that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worst sort, for they cannot be
healed by themselves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the
humors that are offensive. There is another kind of Ulcer that comes of an
Imposthume as well hot as cold, and those are more gentle and easy to be
helped, if you know the Medicines that are apt to help and dissolve those kinds
of Ulcers. These are the three kinds of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men
and women through diverse causes, as before is said, so that these are the
principal causes of those malign Ulcers.

CHAP. XX. To help Ulcers of all sorts.
SEeing that Ulcers are of diverse and sundry kinds, it were necessary to know
of what kind and quality they are, so that thou may help them in form and
order convenient. And first I will write of the corrosive Ulcers, as of a wound
cancrenated, of Mal di formica, and of other sorts of Ulcers that go creeping
upon the flesh. The cure of these kinds of Ulcers is, to apply quickly our
Caustic to mortify the evil, which thou shall do thus. Wet a little Bumbast
in our Caustic, and therewith wash all the sore, and then leave it so open
four and twenty hours without binding it fast, and when four and twenty hours
are past, wash the sore with strong Vinegar, and water of a like quantity, with
charge that there remain none of the Caustic in the sore: then lay thereon
Butter washed with a Colewort leaf, until the asker or dead flesh fall: then
take our Cerot Magistrale, with a little Precipitate strewed thereon, and then
anoint it with Magno liquore, and lay it upon the sore: for this Cerot helps
all manner of corosive Ulcers without any other help, and every plaster will
serve three or four days, taking them off every four and twenty hours, and
making them clean, and then lay them on again. And as for the filthy Ulcer that
I have showed of in this Chapter, you shall dress it only with our Vnguento
magno, the which, without any other help, will heal them quickly. But you must
every four days touch them with Aqua fortis drawn from Precipitate, which
water draws forth the offensive matter, and leaves it purified and clean.
And in all other sorts of Ulcers, our Balm artificial, our Magno liquore, Oil
of Wax, and Turpentine, the black Cerot of Godfredo di me di, our Cerot
Magistrale with Precipitate, are able to help, be they never so evil. And
hereafter I will write of Ulcers particularly with their cures.

CHAP. XXI. Of Ulcers, that come in the feet, of corns, or of chaps.
ULcers that come in the feet may come of diverse causes, and are also of diverse
kinds, as of chaps, of corns, and such like. When they are chaps they come of
an hot matter and fiery, as you may see by experience: For the Patient feels
great heat in his feet, and is always thirsty, the which gives manifest
signs that the humor is hot: and their cure is with cooling purgations, as
our Sirrup against melancholy humors, taking it ten days together: then take
our Pillole Aquilone twice, and so thou shall take away the heat in the feet:
and to help the crepature or chaps, make this Unguent. Take oil of Roses,
Vinegar, and liquid Pitch, ana, and boil them until the Vinegar be consumed,
and so being warm, wet a cloth therein, and lay it thereupon, and in short time
it will be whole: but if they be corns, you shall cut them unto the quick, and
then lay thereon a cloth wet in Oleum benedictum, which does comfort and dry,
and quickly take away the pain. But when they are scratching, or as it were
scorched, you shall lay thereon Vnguento de Lithargiro crudo, and so thou shall
help them, as I have seen the experience.

CHAP. XXII. Of Vleers in the Legs
THese Ulcers in the Legs are of two kinds, that is, filthy, and corrosive. The
filthy Ulcers are caused of cold and moist humors: The corrosive are caused of
humors hot and dry: and these are those Ulcers that go creeping in the flesh,
healing in one place, and breaking out in another. The filthy Ulcer is stinking
and full of matter, and causes little pain, and their cure is with our Balm
artificial, which has virtue to penetrate, digest, mundifie, and incarnate,
and heal, when that the body is first well purged: but those that are caused of
heat and dryness, you shall cure with the remedy written in the Chapter next
abovesaid, and then dress them with our Magistrale Cerot, and put thereon a
little Precipitate, and anoint it with Magno liquore, and so thou shall help
them. But if so be it chance the said Medicine do not heal it, you shall
perfume them five times with Sinabar, Incense, and Myrrh, and without all
doubt thou shall heal them.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Ulcers that come in the Knees.
THese Ulcers in the Knees are gross humors that cannot pass by the Joints
downwards, and so remain in those places, and cause a fastidious Ulcer, which
puts the Patient to great pains, by reason of abundance of humors that
comes there. And the cure of this Imposthume ulcerated is thus, purge the body
with our Soluble Sirrup, seven or eight mornings warm: and then give him di..
of Electuaria Angelica, and so thou shall help them quickly: then dress the
Ulcer with Vnguento magno, putting therein a little Precipitate and Magno
liquore, and so in short time it will heal.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Ulcers in the Groin.
THese Ulcers for the most part are Tumors, or Botches, the which through the
evil disposition of Nature, and evil Medicines are ulcerated. And of that may
come many infirmities, which I will leave to treat of at this time, and I will
show thee a remedy. Give the Patient seven or eight mornings our Soluble Sirrup
cold, and then give him our Aromatico, and after let him use Lignum Sanctum
according to our order, and dress the Ulcer with this Unguent. Take Vnguento
magno. ii. Magno liquore di.. and common Precipitate. ii. Mix them well
together, for this is the true secret of our invention, never made before of
any man, the which I have proved infinite times.

CHAP. XXV. Of Ulcers in the Arms.
THese Ulcers are not of so evil nature as those in the Legs, because
thereunto come not so many humors, and these are commonly caused of the Pox,
the Cure is this. Purge them well with our Magistrale Sirrup, seven or eight
mornings together, then take Pillole Aquilone, and then anoint them with
Vnguento magno every night until the Ulcers remain whole and without pain. Thus
have I used diverse times.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Ulcers that come in the Breast and Shoulders, and in the Back
and Belly.
ULcers that come in the foresaid parts, are all caused of Imposthumes of evil
qualities, that have not been well healed of the Chirurgians, which knew not
how to remove the cause, and by that means the Imposthumes are become malign
Ulcers. He therefore that will cure these Ulcers, it shall be necessary for
him to do that which was not done; that is, to remove the cause first, and then
the cure will follow with more ease and speed, so there be good regard and
consideration had thereof. And yet amongst Ulcers there is one kind that will
receive no curation, and they are called Cancri, that are crude and of evil
digestion, and go creeping along the flesh, and have a root as it were a Plant:
And for those kinds there is found no better remedy to mittigate them, then is
our Quinta essentia Vegitabile, for if you put it therein, and lay a cloth wet
in the same thereon, it takes away the pain, in such sort, that it is to be
wondered at, and will not suffer it to putrify; it takes away the stinking,
and comfort the place very much. As concerning the other kind of Ulcer, you
must first find out the cause before you can help it, and the cause being
found, the cure is easy to find and sure. He therefore that will be diligent,
shall not only heal those kinds of Ulcers, but also all other Ulcers.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Ulcers that come outwardly in all the body.
THese Ulcers are a kind of fat sore that causes abundance of matter, which
comes through superfluous humiditie of the body and blood, and these are
evil to heal, because their Original comes of the inward parts, and the cure
is thus: Give the Patient fourteen days our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, the
which is soluble and drying, and purges the blood, that being done, anoint
the Ulcer with Vnguentum de Lethargiro simple, and so they shall be helped
perfectly.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Ulcers in the Head.
ULcers in the Head are of diverse kinds, as of Wounds, Contusions, Swellings,
Scabs and white Skalls, and such like, which come of sundry causes, and are
helped diverse ways. For the Wounds Ulcerated, are mortified with our Castick,
laying it on four and twenty hours, and then wash it with strong Vinegar,
until all the Castick be come forth, and after help it with our Magno liquore:
The like cure is done in Contusions ulcerated, but the Swellings do differ
much, for that they are caused of the Pox, and thou shall cure them with
Soluble Medicines: Viz. Take Sarsa-Parilia, and then perfume him five or six
times with Sinaber. The Scabs or Crusts are helped with taking three times our
Electuario angelica, and then anoint them every night with Magno liquore. The
white Scab is helped with our Magistrale Cerot laying on Cantharides, and so
let it lie three days, then take it off, and lay on another like the first,
and let it lie other three days, and then anoint the head with Oleum
Benedictum continually.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Ulcers in the mouth, their Kinds and Remedies.
ULcers that come in the mouth are of diverse and sundry kinds, for some proceed
of heat in the head, others of cold, others are humors Gallico. Those that
come of heat in the head, are as it were scorched with great burning within
them, and the cure thereof is in letting blood in the veins under the tongue,
and the next day give him one dose of our Electuario angelica, and let him wash
his mouth with Planten water, wherein is boiled Tutia prepared, Roch Alum, and
Honey of Roses, and this is the true order to cure those kind of Ulcers with
speed. Those Ulcers which are caused of cold, are a certain hardness
alterated, which cause little pain; and the cure of these is to drink our
Vegitabile Quinta essentia, with Mel Rosarum: and dress the Ulcer with Oil of
Sulphur and Tartur mixed: And herein consists a great Secret worthy to be
known, and is of our invention. Ulcers that are caused of Morbo Gallico, if you
will cure them, you must first remove the cause, as I have said diverse times,
and touch them with our Castick. and let the Patient hold his mouth open a good
while after, that the Water may run out: And then make a Lavatory of Aqua
vitae, Honey, and Oil of Vitriol, aad therewith wash the mouth, for these are
great Secrets which bring both health to the Patient, and honor to the
Professor of this Art.

CHAP. XXX. Of Wounds and their kinds, and of their secret Remedies.
VVOunds are of diverse and sundry kinds. Nevertheless, they consist in two,
that is Simple, and Compound. The Simple wounds are those, where the flesh is
only offended. The Compound are those, where there is offense of flesh,
sinews, veins, and bones, and the cure of either of them is in three manners.
The first is a cure pertaining to Nature and not to Art, and that is it which
Dogs and other Animals do use, who being wounded, use no other Medicine then
to keep the wound clean with their proper tongues, and keep a Diet, and the
rest is left unto Nature which works well without pains of Medicine, and this
is the first. The second is that which is called Canonico, in which there be
four operations. The first is, Digestion. The second, Mundification. The third,
Incarnation. The fourth, Siccatrisation. The third order is of our invention,
and is done in this order, that is; Whenever a man has a wound either simple
or compound, the first thing that is to be done therein is, to join the parts
close together, and stitch them, and dress them with diverse sorts of drying
Medicines, as I will show thee hereafter in the cure of Wounds, in sundry parts
of the body.

CHAP. XXXI. What Medicines are fittest to heal Wounds outwardly with ease, and
in short time.
HAving declared already what wounds are outwardly, it is necessary also to
show the true order to cure them with as much ease, and brevitie, as is
possible to be done: And first, I will begin with simple wounds that are only
in the flesh, without offense of vein, sinew or bone. Although these sorts of
wounds are not to be helped with artifice, but only to join the parts
together, and if it be necessary also to stitch them, and so leave it unto
Nature, the which in short time will heal it, nevertheless if thou will help
it with artifice the faster, you shall anoint it once a day with oil of
Frankincense made by Distillation, as is showed in this Book. But those wounds
where there are veins cut, have need to be succored presently with ingenious
artifice, and perfect Remedies to ease and heal them with the most speed that
can be, because the veins may join together, without greater offense of the
wound, and this Mystery thou shall do in this order: The first is to join the
wound together quickly, and stitch it close as they use to sow bags, and not to
leave great wide stitches as they most commonly do; that being done, dress it
upon the wound with our Magno liquore, wetting therein a cloth, and laying it
on as hot as you may suffer it, then strew thereupon our secret powder, and
also round about it, for that subtiliateth the matter that runs to the
wound, and takes it forth with great ease, and without pain of the wound, and
therefore this is one of the most safest Remedies in that case, that Nature
with Art can make, and has been proved an infinite of times by me, and always
have had goodly experiences thereof. Also understand that these wounds, where
the bones and sinews are cut, have need of great artifice, for they are of
great importance. But when there is offense only of the sinews, you shall
stitch them presently, and do as I have said before of veins that were cut,
but dress them not with Magno liquore, but in stead of that take Oleum
Benedictum, and oil of Frankincense, of each alike, because these Oiles do
comfort marvellously those sinews that are cut. If it chance so, that a sinew
had a puncture, or cut half away, in that case it is necessary to cut it
overthwart, lest it should bring a Spasm in the wound. But in case afterward
that the bone be offended, and that there be some part to come forth, it were
necessary to leave the wound open until the bone be come forth, and then
incarnate it; and this thou shall do with our Balsamo Artificiato, and lay
thereon the Cerot of Godfredo di medi, the which helps with great speed. And
this is the order wherewith thou may help all those sorts of wounds before
named, and the defensive to use in these wounds is this. Take perfect Aqua
vitae made of good Wine, and put therein Hypericon, Millefolly, Viticella,
Betonie, and with that Infusion wet clothes, and lay them for a defensive round
about the wound, and thou shall have good success. Wounds in the head are
helped in the order, as those in whom the Sinews are offended. There are diverse
other sorts of wounds, which may be healed with the aforesaid remedies, as
hereafter shall be showed particularly.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Wounds in the Head, with offense of the brain, and how to cure
them.
VVOunds in the head, where there is offense of the brain, are mortal: and
there is no Physician that will take them in cure, but he counts them dead
men without any hope. But I by the grace of God and gift of Nature, have found
the order to cure and heal them in short time. I remember that when one was
wounded in the head in the famous City of Naples, yea, although the brain were
not hurt, but that the skin were cut unto the bone, they counted him mortal,
but I dressed them, and closed their wounds, and helped them in short space, so
that they wondered thereat; and that order I used for the space of seven years
that I tarried there, and caused them to walk in the streets, as it is well
known unto all those that dwell there. And among a number of other, I cured a
Portingall that was called, Il Seignior Diego di mena, of whom I took away all
the bone of the forehead, and every day he came to my lodging to be cured,
which I did with great speed, so that it caused every one to marvel thereat.
Afterward I went to Rome in the time of Pope Paulus the iiii. Carafa, and
always I cured in the same order, and did miracles, of which I call to
testimony the Romans. And among the rest, I cured a certain Gentleman called
M. Alessandor (I cannot remember his Surname) who was wounded in diverse places,
and I cured him quickly. After that I cured, and that in short time, a young
man that was in manner cut in pieces, and of that M. Jacomo da Perugia, M.
Alessandro da Civita, M. Daltilo Hebraeo, all learned Doctors can testify, for
they were present. And such like cures I have always done in Venice: But among
the rest I will not leave to write of a great chance, the which is true, and is
thus: There is in Venice a rare Poet and Orator and Historiographer, well known
unto the world called M. Dionigio Antanagi, who through his evil destiny was
wounded in the head, so that it penetrated the flesh and the bone, and entered
half a finger breadth into the brain, and there that virtuous man fell to the
ground as a dead man, and he lifted himself up to rise, but he could not, but
fell down again, and there came a dimness over his eyes, with a vomiting and
and a Fever, and the blood would not stint, and he lay in extreme pains, which
were all mortal signs: then I being called unto that cure, because he and I
were of great familiarity, and presently I shut the wound, and put therein our
Aqua balsami, and I anointed all his head with our Balsamo artificiato; that
being done, presently the blood stenched, and the pain went away, and the night
after he took his rest, and in the morning the Fever was also gone: After that,
I dressed him with Magno liquore, wetting clothes therein, and upon the cloth I
strewed the powder of Hypericon: And this Medicine I used eight days, in the
which time he came forth of his bed; and shortly after he was perfectly whole,
and before six months were past, it was so siccatrized, that no man could
perceive any wound. And of this I have to testimony Venice, Rome, Vrbine,
Caglie, and all Italy. To conclude this Chapter, I say, that wite the aforesaid
order, thou may cure any such sort of wound.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Wounds in the Head, with Fracture of the Bone.
VVOunds in the Head, with Fracture of the bone, of the common Physicians and
Chirurgians, are counted difficile to be healed, because thereunto belongs
great art or cunning, for they open the flesh and raspe the bone, with many
other things, of which here I account it superfluous to treat of, because that
many be helped without them. For always when the Physician or Chirurgian, does
defend the wound from alteration and corruption, nature it self will work very
well, and heal it without any other aid; but with our Medicines they may be
helped with much more speed, because they let the alteration, and defends
them from Putrefaction, and mittigateth the pain, and the order to cure those
kinds of wounds is thus: The first thing that is to be done in those wounds is,
to join the parts close together, and dress them upon the wound with our Oleum
Benedictum, and upon the oil lay clothes wet in our Magno liquore, as hot as
you may suffer it, and so with these Remedies thou shall help them quickly,
because our Oleum Benedictum takes away the pains, and keeps it from
putrefaction, and repercusseth: Our Magno liquore digesteth, mundifieth, and
incarnateth, and heals. And therefore this is the best Medicine that can be
used in these kinds of wounds. For hereof I have had an infinite of
experiences, the which have been counted Miracles, and therefore I have let the
world to understand thereof, that they may help themselves, if occasion shall
serve; therefore he that will follow this our order in curing, shall work
Miracles on the earth.

CHAP. XXXIV. Of Wounds in the Head, where the bone is not offended.
VVOunds in the head where the bone is not hurt, are not of so great
Importance, but are easy to be helped; for you shall need to do nothing, but
to keep it from putrefaction, and defend it from inflammation, which are easy
to be done, and so Nature will work well with great speed. To keep the wound
from putrefaction, you shall anoint it round about with our Oleum
Philosophorum de Terebinthina and Cera. And to keep it from Inflammation, you
shall wash it with our Quintessence, and upon the wound dress it with our
Magno liquore. Thus doing thy cure shall prosper happily, and you shall not
need to take away any blood, nor yet to keep any diet, nor yet to keep the
house, but to go where you think good, without any peril or danger. And this
Order I have used a long time, as diverse Cities can testify.

CHAP. XXXV. Of Contusions* or bruises, as well in the head, as other places.
COntusions, or bruises in the head, or any other place of the body, of the
ancient Physicians has been counted dangerous to heal. For, they say, that
Contusions must be brought to putrefaction, and turned into matter: which
opinion I do not allow: For by me those Contusions or bruises, are very easy
to be dissolved without maturation: And that I do with our Oleo benedicto, and
Magno liquore, as much of the one as of the other mixed together, and made very
hot as you may suffer it, and then wet clothes therein twice a day, and in
three or four days at the most, they shall be resolved: and this it does,
because this remedy assubtiliateth the humors, and opens the pores, and
draws forth the matter that is run unto the place offended, and so by those
means they shall be helped. With this remedy I have cured hundreds when I was
in the wars in Africa, in Anno 1551. when the said City was taken and
destroyed by the Camp of Charles the fifth Emperor.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of Wounds in the neck, and the order to be used in curing them.
VVOunds in the neck are very perilous, and hard to be cured, and long before
they will heal: and this comes because in it are all the ligaments of the
head, as bones, sinews, veins, flesh, and skin, all instruments that hold the
head and the body together, without the which a man cannot live: and therefore
those wounds are so perilous to be healed, seeing thereunto runs so great
quantity of humors, that they will not suffer the wound to be healed. The true
way therefore to help these wounds, is to stitch them well in his place, and
dress it upon the wound with clothes wet in Oleum benedictum one part, and
Magno liquore three parts mixed together, as hot as you can suffer it: and upon
the cloth lay the powder of Mill folly: and this thou shall do once in four
and twenty hours, and so thou shall help them quickly; giving you great
charge, that you change not your Medicine, for this mundifieth, incarnateth,
and heals the wound without any further help: For I have proved it an
infinite of times.

CHAP. XXXVII. Of wounds in the arms, and their importance, and Medicines.
VVOunds in the arms are dangerous, for that there also are a great number of
Sinews, Cartiligines, Veins, Muskles, and other dangerous things, as it is
well seen in wounds of the arms, how that many times thereunto runs
abundance of humors, and there comes alteration, inflammation, and
imposthumation, which hurts the Patient much. Therefore in this case, I will
show thee a rare secret, wherewith thou shall help any sort of wound in the
arm, without any alteration, and with little pain, and the secret is this:
Dress the wound upon the upper parts with our Magno liquore very warm, without
any tenting at all: and this do once a day and no more, and in any wise change
not your Medicine: For with this thou may help all wounds in the arms with
great speed: and it is one of the greatest secrets that can be used for wounds
in the arms, and proved by me infinite times.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Of Wounds in the breast, as well peircing through, as other.
ALl wounds in the breast are troublesome, and very dangerous, as well they
that pierce into the body, as others. And the cause is, for that the parts of
the breast are compounded of Skin, Cartilages, Sinews, Flesh, and Bones. So
that it cannot be but troublesome and perilous. For where the sinew parts be
hurt, there arises ever great pain, which for the most part brings Fevers,
and other accidents, and therefore is evil to cure. The cure of them is with
our Balsamo and Quinta essentia. For the one takes away the pain, and the
other keeps from alteration. But when they are peircing into the body, they
are most dangerous, because the Chirurgian cannot tell certainly what part
within the body is offended or hurt. Either the Liver, or the Lungs, or the
Milt, or any other particulars. Moreover, there is another matter which makes
it dangerous, which is, when they are penetrating, the matter that proceeds
from the Wound falls into the body, as well as out. And remaining in the body
causes putrefaction, then Fevers follow, and commonly death. Wherefore in this
case, cause the Patient to vomit, and to keep slender diet, because the humor
should not alter to the damage of the wounded. And to preserve him from
putrefaction, you shall anoint all his body over with our Balsamo, and let him
drink our Quintessence morning and evening. And this done the cure shall
prosper, or else there is no hope by any other means.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of Wounds in the belly, and in the reins, and their affects and
Medicines.
VVOunds in the belly are doubtful, and very uncertain to cure, because it is
unpossible to know how they are, or of what importance they be: for although
ye may see the Orifice where the Weapon went in, yet ye cannot know what
offense it has done in the interior parts, and therefore they are bard to be
helped, and worse to judge of, and for that cause I will not stand long in
reasoning thereof: for I have determined not to speak of things uncertain and
doubtful, but only of things that may be proved by reason and experience. And
because those wounds be uncertain, I will write nothing of them, for fear of
hiding the truth: but I will write of those in the reins or back, and first I
will show what the reins are, because every one may comprehend my reason. It
is to be understood, that our bodies are made all of sensible things: as
inwardly, the Stomach, the Heart, the Liver, the Lungs, the Belly, the Milt,
the Guts, with a number of other things which are not common, or known to all
men, as those which I have spoken of. The rest of the man is made of
Cartilagines, of Veins, of Muskles, of Flesh, of Skin, and other particulars
of small importance to know, because the wise, learned, and reverend, my Lord
Canan Ferrarese, has writ thereof better then ever any in the world has done,
and therefore if you believe not me, believe his writing set forth in print.
But to return to our purpose, I say, that God has compounded the m^n naturally
of all these things that I have spoken of: and because they are soft and
tender, he has placed the bones in the midst of them to strengthen them, and
to keep them straight, etc. And from the shoulder to the thigh, he has made a
great pillar, of many pieces of bones joined together: On the one part whereof
grows the ribs, which holds the flesh, skin, and other particulars far
from the interiours: and upon that bone on the outward side, are the magistrall
sinews that descend from the head, and bind all the back together, and
reaches down unto the feet. Therefore (this being true that I have said)
wounds in the head are very dangerous in all his actions, and their cure very
hard, because all those senses that give nourishment, pass by the reins
downward to the lower parts: and most commonly when a man is wounded in those
places, he remains lame on the leg that is on that part, and being, as it is,
hard and dangerous, the cure of it, according to the Canons of the Ancients, is
also perilous; because in those places where so many particulars do meet and
communicate, there ought not in any wise to be putrefaction, or digestion, but
to preserve: You may not bring it to maturation, but to keep it from it; you
may not incarnate, but with speed heal it up: and so in this order the cure
shall succeed well, and without danger. And this I will show unto every one,
because he shall profit by our doctrine to the glory of God, and health of the
wounded. When one is wounded in those parts, I counsel that the Chirurgian
presently shall close the wound with all his diligence, putting thereupon of
our Quinta essentia, and instead of a defensive our Balsamo, and upon the wound
lay a cloth wet in our Magno liquore, and upon the cloth strew our secret
powder for wounds, and following this order, he shall be reputed for an
excellent Chirurgian above all other: and this is the mere truth as by most
evident proof thou shall more largely find.

CHAP. XL. Of Wounds in the Legs, and those parts.
VVOunds in the Legs are in manner of the same quality as those in the arms,
because the Legs are of their proper quality and Nature compounded of the like
substance that the Arms are, that is, skin, flesh, muskles, veins, sinews, and
bones. And these when they are offended, or wounded, are very perilous, because
unto them runs great quantity of humors. And in the Legs are certain
deadly places as a man may say: As the hinder part of the Caulf of the Leg: And
the middle of the inner side of the thigh: The Ancle and the foot are all
places troublesome and curious to heal, when they are wounded. And therefore to
heal them according to the manner of the Ancients, it were great trouble to the
Chirurgian, and pity to see the pain of the Patient. Wherefore in no wise use
not the Medicines of the Ancients, but when thou have occasion, join unto the
skill of thy Art, the use of these Medicines, our Quinta essentia, Balsamo,
Magno Liquore, Oleo Benedicto, Oleo di Rasa, Oleo Philosophorum, any of these,
or such like, which are incorruptible, which by their proper quality
assubtiliateth contusions, pierces to the bottom of Wounds, keeps the flesh
in his natural caliditie and humiditie, preserves from putrefaction, and
naturally makes the flesh to join and grow together, and that in short space.
Therefore consider well which works better effect, ours or the Ancients: And
use them at thy discretion.

CHAP. XLI. Of wounds that pierce into the body, and of their danger.
VVOunds that pierce into the body are very perilous and mortal, because the
most part of them cannot be cured by ordinary means, and especially when the
interiours are ulcerated: In that case the Physician not seeing it, nor knowing
the truth of the wound, cannot apply convenient Medicines, therefore he shall
be much less apt to heal them, and therefore you must stand to the benefit of
Fortune. And of this I will discourse nothing, for that it will be hard for me
to show that thing, that I cannot see with mine eyes, nor touch with my hands:
And because this discourse cannot be approved of the truth, and of experience,
I will not meddle therewith in any wise: Nevertheless, I will write of those
sorts of wounds that are penetrative, and yet not offend the Intrals, for those
may be helped with ease, as I have cured a great number, and among the rest in
Anno 1551. in the month of June (as I remember) the 17. day, being in the
Army of Naples to go to Africa, there happened a great chance which was thus:
The Captain General of the Galleys of Fiorenza, named Il Seignior Giordano
Orsino sitting at the Table with diverse Captains and Gentlemen, among the rest
there was one Captain falling in talk with another, sitting at the same Table,
took a loaf of bread, and flang it at his face, then Seignior Giordano seeing
that little respect of the Captain, rose from the Table and took him by the
collar, and gave him five Stockadoes in the breast to have slain him, and left
him lying: That being done, the said Seignior Giordano repented him, and seeing
that he was not yet dead, called for me being in the Galley with Don Garsia de
Toledo my General, and when I came, I found the poor Captain almost dead; whom
I dressed with our Balsamo artificiato, and twice a day I gave him to drink of
our Quinta essentia, and gave him meats of good nourishment, and I never put
tent into the wound, and in three days he was helped, and of this the whole
company, that was in the Gallie can testify, and especially the said Seignior
Giordano who did the fact. Then afterward in Africa I cured an infinite number
that were wounded in diverse manners. And of these Experiences I have done and
do yet daily, in so much that if I should write of them, it would be tedious,
and therefore I will stand no longer about matters concerning wounds, because I
have written a Discourse upon Surgery, and Il Capricio Medicinale, in the
which I have declared many things most profitable in the same.

CHAP. XLII. A Discourse upon old wounds which are not yet healed, with their
Remedies.
WHen that wounds are evil healed, and that therein comes Imposthumation, and
that the part wounded be indurated and full of pain. Then use this Secret of
our Invention, which was never yet seen or heard of by the Ancients, nor yet in
our time but of us. When thou find such a case, wash the wound well, and
make it clean round about, and then wash it with our Quinta essentia
Vegitabile, and bath it well through, for that the said Quintessence does open
the pores, and assubtiliateth the matter, and causes the humor to come forth.
This being done, anoint all over with our Magno liquore, and this doing,
within three days the Patient shall feel great ease, and in short time after
he shall be whole. This is one of the noblest Medicines that can be made, for
it takes away the hardness, heals the wound, and comfort the place
offended.

CHAP. XLIII. A rare Secret to heal wounds of Gunshot, Arrows or such like in
the wars, when they require haste.
IF thou will cure those wounds, presently join the parts together, and wash it
with our Aqua Celestis and Oleum Balsami of our invention, and lay a cloth wet
in the same thereon.

CHAP. XLIV. To heal a Wound quickly.
VVAsh the wound well with our Aqua Balsami, and close it up, and thereupon lay
a cloth wet in the Oil of Frankincense, and so by this means thou shall help
any great wound quickly, for I have proved it infinite times, to my great
honor.

CHAP. XLV. To help a Wound quickly, that is in danger of any accident.
VVOunds in some parts of the body, are very dangerous of life, and specially
where the sinews be cut or pierced, or veins or muskles hurt, or bones broken,
and by an infinite of other particulars, which being open, or evil healed, the
Patient may be in danger of life, because the wind enters in, and they cause
pains and inflammation, and therefore to avoid all these aforesaid matters, so
that the wound shall have no detriment, use this remedy. First, join the parts
close together, and put therein our Quintessence, and lay thereon a cloth, wet
in our Balm, and bind it fast that the air get not in, for it is very hurtful.
Ye shall understand that these are two of the excellentest Medicines that may
be found, because our Quintessence does assubtiliate the blood, and takes it
forth, and takes away the pain, and the Balm does warm and comfort the place
offended, and will not suffer any matter to run thereunto by any means, for
this is most true, as I have proved diverse and sundry times, and always have
had good success.

CHAP. XLVI. To stay the Flux of Blood in Wounds.
When there is a Flux of Blood in any wound, by reason of some vein that is
cut, and that the Chirurgian would stop it. It is necessary that he put into it
our Quintessence, and then to stitch it up very close and hard, and upon the
wound strew the blood of a man dried, made in powder, and lay upon the blood a
cloth wet in our Balm artificial very warm, and upon that bind the wound very
straight with ligaments. And every day twice wash it with our Quintessence, and
round about it anoint it with our Balm, and also cast thereon our secret
Powder for wounds; and that do Morning and Evening every day, without opening
the wound. And in short time it will remain well. Giving you charge that the
wounded person do keep no straight diet, because Nature being weak, relaxeth
the veins, and that causes the flux of blood.

CHAP. XLVII. Another for the same.
FIrst, stitch the wound close, then cast thereon man's blood, and bind it
somewhat hard, so let it remain 24. hours, and when you unbinde it, take heed
you remove nothing, and cast thereon more dried blood, and anoint it round
about with Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina and Cera, and bind it up again
other four and twenty hours, and then bind it gently, and anoint the wound
with Oil of Frankincense, and in short time it will be perfectly whole.

CHAP. XLVIII. A Defense to be laid upon wounds.
TAke perfect Aqua vitae, of good wine, what quantity you will, and put
therein Hypericon, Millefolie, Viticella, and and Betonie, ana, then let it
stand certain days close stopped, and when ye will use it, wet a cloth
therein, and lay it round about the wound. And thou shall have thy intent, to
the great satisfaction of the Patient.

CHAP. XLIX. Our Secret Powder for Wounds.
TAke Hypericon flowers and leaves, Millefolie, and Viticella, ana, stamp them
well together, and strew it upon the wound, and round about the wound when it
is dressed, for it does defend it from accidents.

The Third Book of the Secrets of LEONARDO PHIORAVANTE.
CHAP. I. In this third book is showed the order to make diverse Compositions,
appertaining both to Physic and Surgery, with the hidden virtues of sundry
Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, well approved by this Author, and first of
his Petra Philosophale, the which helps against all diseases that happens
unto man and woman.
THere has always been a great questioning among the Philosophers, whether
that one Med^cine might help against all diseases or no. The which I affirm,
and will approve with sufficient reason, that the Petra Philosophale, made of
our invention, may help against all the infirmities that comes unto man's body*
and two only reasons I will show thee with brevity: The first of them is this,
that all sorts of infirmities have their original and beginning of the
Stomach, and to know the truth, ye may see manifestly, that if the body be
never so little infirmed, the stomach is also grieved: For ye may see how the
Animals terestriall, never help themselves of other infirmity then of the
stomach, and when they will help themselves, they eat herbs, the which causes
them to vomit, and this does signify that they have no other infirmity, then
the aforesaid; so by the experience of the Animals, I approve that the
infirmity is caused of the stomach, and this is the first reason. The second
is, that all the Medicines, wherein our Petra Philosophale is put, as soon as
they are come into the stomach, it draws unto it all the evil humors of the
stomach, and also of the whole body, and mixeth with them, and so nature
sends them forth by vomit, or by seege, or both, and so the stomach shall be
evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of
infirmities, so that by this reason I affirm, that our Petra Philosophale may
help against all sorts of infirmities. And to know the truth, I have proved it
by experience in all manner of infirmities, and always have found it to do
much good unto all men, and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make
this Petra Philosophale, is thus.

Take Sal Niter, roche Allome, Vitrioll Romain, of each two pound.

First, dry the Vitrioll in an earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and mix
it with the other matters, and put thereunto four ounces of Sal Gemmae, then
put it in a Goord with his head, and a Receiver well luted, and distill it in a
wind furnace, so that ye may make fire with wood, and at the first make small
fire, and so increase it according to Art, and always lay wet clothes on the
Head and Receiver, and that thou shall do, because the spirits of the water
shall not fly away. Ye shall understand, that in the beginning of your
distillation, the Receiver will wax red like blood, and then turn white, and at
the last, when ye give it strong fire, it will turn red again, and those are
the pure spirits of the Aqua fortis, and then at the end, the Receiver will
turn white again, and then it is ended* then let it wax ^old, and then keep it
in a glass close shut, to make our Petra Philosophale.

Then take Mercury one pound, quick Lime. vi. ^ope. iiii. common Ashe^ * ^^^.
Mix them together in a Mortar of stone, and then put them into a Retort (...)
and distill it with a strong fire until all the Mercury be come forth into the
Receiver, then take it forth* and keep it in a glass to make thy Composition,
the which is made thus*

Take the water that thou m^dest first, and (...) a Goord of glass being well
luted, and then put in the Mercury that thou did^^st distill before. After that
take S^^^l in thin plates i. Iron also in thin plates. ii. Fine gold in leaves,
the weight of (...). ii. and put them altogether in the glass, and presently
set on the Head, for it will begin to boil, and cause red fumes like blood, the
which thou shall receive in a Receiver, and presently set thy glass in the
Furnace, and give it fire until all the water be come forth with the fume.
Then let it cool, and keep that close in a glass, then break that other glass
that stood in the fire, and in the bottom thou shall find our Petra
Philosophale, the which thou shall grind fine, and searce it into most fine
powder, and then wash it well with Vinegar distilled, and dry it again, and at
the last wash it with Rosewater, and dry it very well, stirring it continually
over the fire, then keep it as a precious Jewel close in a Glass.

For the order to use it, I will write hereafter in sundry places: Ye shall
understand, that the water which ye distilled away from the stone; will serve
for the same purpose again: But ye must take but half the quantity of the
aforesaid matters, and when ye have distilled it again from the stone, ye
shall preserve it for an infinite number of purposes, as I will show thee
hereafter.

CHAP. II. To make our Balm artificial, with the order to use it, and
wherefore it serves.
THis Balsamum has all the virtues of the natural Balm, although not in
quality, yet in virtue, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Veni^e Turpentine one pound, Oil of Bays that is perfect without
mixture. iiii. Galbanum. iii. Gum Arabie. iiii. Olibanum, Mirrba elect, Gum
Hedera, of each. iii. Lignum Alloes, Galingall, Cloves, Consolida minore,
Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Zedoaria, Ginger, Diptamum album, of each. i. Musk of Levant,
Ambergriece, of each. i. Beat all those aforesaid things together, and put
them into a Retort of glass well luted, and put thereto six pound of rectified
Aqua vitae without phlegm, and so let it stand eight days, and then distill it
by Sand, and there will come forth a white water mixed with Oil, and so keep
thy fire small, until there come forth a blackish Oil, then change thy
Receiver, and set thereto another, and increase thy fire until all the spirits
be come forth, then separate the Oil from the black water, and keep them by
themselves, and the like shall ye do by the first water. The first water that
is white, is called Aqua del Balsamo, and the Oil separated from that, is
called Oleum del Balsamo. The second water that is black, is called Matter
Balsami, and the Oil separated from that water, is called Balsamo artificiato,
the which would be kept as a precious Jewel.

The first water is most excellent to clear and preserve the sight of the eyes,
also the face being washed therewith, it makes it very fair, and preserves it
youthfully, it keeps back age, it breaks the gravel in the reins, and
provokes Urine, the which is stopped through carnositie, it helps all manner
of wounds, in what place of the body soever they be, if ye wash them with the
said water, and wet therein clouts and lay thereon, for his operation is so
strange, that it seems rather divine then humane. It helps much against the
Etisie, and against all sorts of Catarres, and Cough. If ye wash a Sciatica
therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same, it takes away the pain
presently.

The other water called the Mother of Balm, helps Scabs in short time, if ye
wash them therewith: so does it help the white Scall, Lepra, and all sorts of
Ulcers that are not corrosive, most miraculously to see, and without any
trouble. It serves also against a number of other infirmities, the which I
will let pass at this time.

The Oil of Balm does serve for an infinite number of things, and especially
for wounds in the head, where the bone and pannicle is hurt, putting it
therein. It preserves the face if ye anoint it therewith. It is most
excellent against the Plurisie, giving thereof. i. at a time with the water of
Balm.

The Balm artificial is a miraculous liquour, for if any have the stitch in
the side, and take. ii. thereof, it presently will help him. It is also good
against the Cough, and Catarre, and coldness in the head and stomach, and for
wounds in the head. It is a most Sovereign remedy, if ye anoint all the head
therewith once a day, because it pierces into the brain, and also unto the
stomach beneath. It resolves a Quartan in short time, if ye anoint all the
body therewith, leaving no part. And to be short, I know no disease, neither
hot, nor yet cold, but that this Balsamum does good unto, as well the hot
diseases as the cold, because it cools the hot and heateth the cold, and this
it does by his quality and hidden virtue, so that I have found in this
precious liquor, such great virtues, that I am not able to declare them all; so
that every one, the which is furnished with this precious Balm, may be kept
from infirmities, and shall not need to seek the natural Balm, with so much
expenses, and danger of the life, as has been many times seen.

CHAP. III. To make our Aromatico, the which helps against all manner of
infirmities, of what quality soever they be.
ARomatico Leonardo, is so called, because it was compounded and made by his
invention, and is a miraculous Medicine, that serves against all manner of
diseases, of what quality soever they be, for it works this operation, that
is, as soon as it joyneth to the stomach, it draws to it all the evil humors
of the body, and imbraceth them, and carries them forth by vomit and seege,
and so leaves Nature unburdened, the which may prevail to his pleasure because
it has no impediment, and by this reason I approve that our Aromatico helps
against all diseases; as is said before, and the order to make it is thus.

Take fine Sugar. iiii. pure Pearls, Musk, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamon,
ana.. i. Petra Philosophale,. iiii. mix them together, and make thereof
Lozanges with Rosewater according to Art, the which ye shall keep in a box of
wood close shut, and the order to use it is thus, that when the Physician does
go to visit any sick person, and that he will prepare him some Medicine to take
inward, the best and most perfect Medicine that he can ordain is our Aromatico,
because it evacuateth the stomach by vomit, and the body downward, and his
operation is such, that it does in manner help any crude sort of infirmity,
and the quantity is from i.. to ii. and may he taken in broth, in wine, in
water, or mix it with any Pills, or Potion, giving you charge, that when ye put
it in any Potion, that ye leave none in the bottom of the cup where ye drink
it out, because the Petra Philosophale, is heavy, and will remain in the
bottom, for if that remain it will not work at all, giving you also charge,
that the said day that ye give this Medicine, that ye let the Patients drink
as much crude water as they will, and give them little meat to eat that day,
and this is the order to use this Medicine.

CHAP. IIII. To make our Electuario Angelico, and the order to use it, and in
what diseases.
ELectuario, Angelico Romano is so called, because it was compounded of me in
the City of Rome, in the time of the Pope Paulo quarto, and because this
composition works divinely, I called it Angelico, and is most excellent
against many diseases, it is good against all sorts of Fevers, giving it
Per-minorativo, and for the Stitch in the side it is most rare, because it
takes away the viscositie in the Stomach, and opens the Pores, and is good
against the Gout; for if they take it every third day once, in ten days they
shall be helped. It is also good against the Cough, Catarr, and for the Milt,
and for those that have the Pox, or the running Gout, and such like
influences, and the order to make it is thus:

Take Saffron, Lignum aloes, Cinnamon, red Coral, ana. iii. Elliborus niger,
without preparation,. ii. Electuario de succo rosarum M^fue, that is not too
much boiled. vi. Sugar Rosate. viii. Musk of Levant. i. Petra Philosophale,.
iii. our Quintessence of wine. ii. purified Honey as much as will suffice to
make it in form of an Electuarie, mix them on a small fire in an earthen-pan,
and when it is made, keep it in a vessel of glass, for any other vessel will
not be good. This Electuarie ye may mix with any soluble Medicine, but ye must
take it fasting, the quantity is from ii. to. iiii. Ye shall understand, that
this in a manner reviveth the dead by his great virtue, as has been seen many
thousand times in Venice, and in Rome, most worthy of memory: And therefore if
any Physician desire to get fame in the world, let him use our Electuario
Angelica, the which works miracles on the earth.

CHAP. V. Our Sirrup Solutivo, with the Order to use it.
SOluble Sirrups made in decoction are very wholesome and of great faculty, and
specially in the crudity of humors, and the reason is this, because it
disperseth the matter, and evacuateth it with great ease, and without danger or
trouble of the Patient, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Sage, Rue, Rosemary, Wormwood, Cicorie, Carduus Sanctus, Nettles,
Organie, of each a handful; Figs, Raisons, Dates, sweet Almonds, Sal gem. ana.
iiii. Coloquintida, Aloes hepatica, Cinnamon, Mirabolani citrini, ana. ii.
common Honey two pound, stamp them all grossly, and put them to infuse in
eighteen pound of fair water, then boil it till half be consumed, then strain
it, and distill it by a filter, and aromatise it with two carets of Musk, and a
pint of Rosewater, and then it is made, the which ye shall keep in a bottle of
glass close stopped, the quantity is from. iiii. to. vi. In Winter you shall
take it very warm, and in the Spring and Autumn, ye shall take it but warm. In
Summer ye shall take it cold, for this purges the gross humors of the body,
and hurts not the stomach, you may use it in a Fever four or five days
together, and it will help it. In cruditie of humors, as the French Pox,
Gouts, Catarrs, Doglie Artetich, and such like matters, where there is no
accident of Fever, ye may take it ten or fifteen days together, and cannot
hurt by any means, for it purges most excellent; it is given against the
Cough, against Flux of of the Urine, and pains in the head, and carnositie in
the Yeard, for the Emeroids; and in sum, it is good against all diseases c^^^ed
of corrupt humors, for it has such virtue, that it draw^^^ from all parts,
and evacuateth the humors intestinall, for of this Sirrup I have had great
experience, in such persons as were in manner banished and had lost their
taste, and presently using this, they came to their good tempera^^^^, and I
have used it an infinite number of times in persons that were ulcerated, and
full of sores, evil handled of Fortune, and of the infirmity, and finding no
means to cure them as they should be: I gave them this Sirrup fourteen or
fifteen days, and then they were cured, with a number of other things, the
which would be too long to write, and therefore I would wish every one to use
this, not only in the aforesad matters, but in all other diseases.

CHAP. VI. Our Sirrupo magistrale Leonardo, the which serves against an
infinite number of Diseases.
THis Sirrup is solutive, and very pleasant to use, and cannot hurt in any
wise, the which is seldom seen in other Medicines, and the order to make it is
thus.

Take the leaves of Sine,. ii. Fumitorie, Maidenhair, H^rts-tongue, Liverwort,
Epitimum* Ellemo, Pollipidie of the Oak, the flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse,
Liquorice, of each. iii. Coloquintida, Elleborus niger, Aloes Hepatica,
Mirabolani Indi, ana. i. Prunes xiiii. Sebestien xii. Tamarise. i. Stamp them
grossly, and infuse them in ten pound of Fumitorie water, then boil it until
the consumption of the third part, and then strain it, and in that which is
streined put these things: Sirrup of St^cados one pound, Saffron. i. Mel
Rosarum,. vi. rectified Aqua vitae,. iiii. Musk. i. The Mullege of Marsh
Mallows. iiii. Benzoin,. i. Rosewater,. iii. and then it is made, the which ye
shall keep in a glass close stopped* and keep it in a temperate place, and this
you must take warm; the quantity is from. ii. to. iiii. and it is a most safe
Medicine to be used without keeping of any diet. It helps those much that
have Pellaria, Scabs, Emeroids, and such like diseases, and may be given unto a
woman with child, without any danger, when she shall have occasion to use any.

CHAP. VII. Our Sirrup against the melancholy humor, and specially where there
is ventositie in the Stomach.
IT were necessary for those that will make this Sirrup, to be expert in the
Art, for it would be made with great diligence, and the order to make is thus:

Take water of Fumitorie, of Hops, of Wormwood, of Maidenhair, of each five
pound. Then with this water thou shall make a decoction with these things that
follow.

Take Pollipodium of the Oak, one pound, Sine leaves, Epitimum, ana. iiii.
Cordial flowers two handfulls, Maidenhair one handful, Liquorice, Raisons,
Cinnamon, of each. ii. The four Cold seeds,. ii. Make thereof a decoction
according to Art, and strein it, then take four pound of that Decoction, and
put thereto the juice of Bourage, of Buglosse, of Hops; of each. ii. common
Honey,. vi. then with white Sugar make a Sirrup in good form, and aromatise it
with Musk and Amber, putting thereto i.. of Plyris without Musk, and then it is
made. The dose is from, iii. to. iiii. in the morning warm, and fast thereon at
least three or four hours, for this purges marvellously the melancholy
humors, and all other gross humors, and dissolveth wind, and comfort the
heart, etc.

CHAP. VIII. Our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, the which is miraculous to dissolve
crude, and ma^ign humors, with the order to use it, in the French Pox, and
such like diseases.
BEcause the Pox is a disease contagious, putrified, and corrupt, and works
many evil Effects, as I have written in my Caprici Medicinali. Therefore it
were necessary to prepare most excellent and rare Remedies to dissolve the
same, which Medicines are infinite.

But in this Chapter I will write one, that purges the crude and viscous
humors downwards, and does assubtiliate the gross humors, and dries all
sorts of subtle humors that offend Nature, and sends them forth by sweat:
It dries the melancholy humor, and dissolveth choler, and is most wholesome
for those that are troubled with that disease, because it dries much and
dissolveth the disease, with many other good effects, as by experience thou
may see, and the order to make it is thus.

Take the Bark of Lignum Sanctum grossly beaten one pound, and lay it in steep
in fourteen pound of fair water, 24 hours, then boil it until four pound be
consumed, then put thereto Pollipodie of the Oak,. ii Cicory one handful,
Aloes hepatica,. iiii. and let them boil for an hour, and put thereunto the
leaves of Sine, Epitimum, ana. i. Coloquintida,. vi. Sugar. viii. then let it
boil till half be boiled away, and that there remain vii. pound, then strein
it, and put it in a glass with xii. grains of Musk, and keep it very close
stopped, and this is the Sirrup, the which ye shall take twice a day, that is
morning and evening; then make this drink following, the which shall be the
common drink at all times to your meat.

Take a pound of Lignum Sanctum, Raspead, and steep it in ten pound of white
wine that is ripe, and let it boil an hour, then put thereto fifteen pound of
fair water, and let it boil a little more, and then strein it, and keep it in a
glass bottle, for this is to be used all the day time, and the order to use
these is thus.

First, when any feels himself grieved with the Pox, or any such like
disease, he must keep his bed at least twenty days, and use to take of the
first Sirrup or Potion every morning a good draught, being as warm as he may
suffer it, then cover him well with clothes that he may sweat as much as he
can, then take off the clothes by little and little, and dry him with warm
clothes, and so let him repose for two hours, and then let him eat, and his
meat must be dry, as Biscuit, Rostmeat, Raisins of the Sun, Almonds, and
sometime a rere Egg, and his drink at meals, and all the day beside, shall be
the last made with wine and water: then at night give him of the first Sirrup
as ye did in the morning, and cause him to sweat, and then dry him: and this
order thou shall use twenty days together, not coming forth of thy Chamber,
and by the grace of God thou shall be helped of any such grievous infirmity, as
I have seen the experienee thereof an infinite of times, to my great honor,
for it may be occupied in all complexions with safety, as by the Ingredients
thou may see.

CHAP. IX. To make the water of Lignum Sanctum, most wholesome against the Pox,
with a new order.
COmmonly they use to take the water of Lignum Sanctum against the Pox, the
which surely is most wholesome, but it must be taken in good order and form,
and must be made with great discretion, and not as they use it now adays, for
they give it some three or four times, and never the better, although the wood
be sufficient enough to help them, and therefore I would wish every one that
will use this water, to take it in such order as it ought to be, the which I
will show thee hereafter.

Take Lignum Sanctum, Raspead small one pound, the bark being beaten. iii.
infuse them in twelve pound of fair water one night, and the next morning put
therein one pound of Honey, the which is put in, because it is aperative and
warm, and helps to provoke sweat, and causes it to have a good taste: then
boil it till half be consumed, then put thereto Carduus sanctus. iiii. strong
Wine three pound, then boil it until a third part be consumed, and then it is
made; then strain it, and take forth the Carduus sanctus, and put therein
twenty pound of fair water, and one pound of Honey, and let it boil until four
pounds be consumed, then strein it and keep it in a glass bottle, for this is
the common drink to drink all the day long, and the order to take it is thus.
First before ye will take this water, it were necessary to take our Sirrupo
Solutivo seven or eight days, after that take of our Electuario Angelica. ss.
That being done, in the name of God take this potion of Lignum sanctum in this
order. Take in the morning at the appearing of the day. viii. very warm as he
may suffer, and presently lay clothes on him, and cause him to sweat two hours,
and then dry him with warm clothes, and so let him remain two hours, and then
give him to eat, and his meat shall be Biscuit, Raisins, Almonds, and sometime a
little roast meat, and no other: then in the evening about the 22. hour, ye
shall give him the said Sirrup as ye did in the morning, neither more nor
less, and cause him to sweat, and about the 24. hour give him only Biscuit and
Raisins, and the other common drink that was made last, giving you warning that
ye make this drink fresh every third day, because it shall not hurt the
stomach, and every week once, ye shall take a pill of Mart millitare, and
that day thou shall eat Birds flesh because of weakening: Also ye shall take
very great heed to one thing, and that is this. If it happen, that at the
beginning of this cure there comes a Fever, or other accident unto the
Patient, that in any wise ye leave not the cure, but follow the order, for
that is a certain sign of health: for many times I have given this water, and
unto some in the fourth or fifth day the Fever came, and tarried many times ten
or twelve days, and then the Fever went away with the corrupt disease, and all
for company, and so in short time they were cured, so that, as I have said
before, when that sign appears and is delivered, it is a certain sign of
health: Also I will advise thee of another thing, and that is this: If the
Patient cannot sweat ye shall anoint him all over with the Oil of Quinces,
the which shall cause him to sweat apace; for without sweat the cure will not
be perfect, and this order thou shall keep, at the least forty days together
within thy Chamber, so that there come no air in, for it will hinder the cure.

CHAP. X. An Electuary that helps the Cough with great speed and ease.
THe Cough is caused of a Catarrous humor, and coldness of the stomach, and
therefore if ye will help it, it were necessary to have a remedy that does
ripen the Catarre, and mollify the stomach, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Enula Campana. iiii. Marsh Mallows. xii. Quinces. xvi. But if ye cannot
get Quinces, ye may take Marmalade ready made, and boil it in fair water with
the said roots until they be dry, then stamp them in a mortar, and strein them
through a streiner, then take for every pound of that matter two pound of white
Honey, and boil them together, but boil them not too much: then take it from the
fire, and put thereunto for every pound of the aforesaid matter. i. of Saffron,
and. i. of Cinnamon, and. ii. of Sulphur, and. i. of Licorice, and then
incorporate them well together, and aromatise it with musk and Rosewater, and
this ye shall use morning and evening, for this is of so great virtue, that it
is to be wondered at, because the Mallows do mollify, the Enula Campana does
warm, and causes digestion, and comfort the Stomach: the Quinces are
cordial and warm, the Sulphur is a great drier, the which destroys the evil
humors of the body, the Saffron comfort the heart, the Cinnamon is
stomackall, the Licorice is mollificative, and digesteth the matter: so that of
force this Electuary must help any kind of Cough, except it come of the Pox,
for then it will do small pleasure* as I have proved.

CHAP. XI. Our Magistrall Electuary of Sulphur, the which serves against
diverse sorts of infirmities.
AS the fire has virtue to heat and dry material things: so has the Sulphur
virtue to warm and to dry the humidity and coldness of our bodies, for I have
occupied it diverse and sundry times, and always have seen diverse and sundry
good effects, but for the better commodity, and more ease to use it, I have
compounded this Electuary, the which thou may use with ease and benefit unto
a number, and the order to make it is thus.

Take very fine Sulphur that is without earth, and make it into fine powder one
pound, Cinnamon. ss. Saffron. i. Ginger. ii. Musk dissolved in Rosewater two
Carets, white Honey crude, as much as will suffice to make it into an Electuary
without fire, then keep it in a dry place; and this ye shall use in the morning
fasting, and his quantity from four drachms to seven, This dries up Scabs,
provokes Urine, breaks the stone in the Reins, it helps the Cough, dries
up the watering of the eyes, causes a good appetite, with diverse other things,
the which I will leave to the Experimentors.

CHAP. XII. Our electuary of Consolida majore, that serves for many diseases
inwardly.
THis Consolida majore, is a herb so called, because of his effect that it
does in healing of wounds, and other places of the flesh separated, for if ye
eat thereof it will help the Rupture, and all sorts of Wounds penetrating, and
Ulcers of the Lungs, it dries the Milt, and such like effects: but because
thou may use it more commodious, I have compounded an Electuary, the which
is excellent and rare, and is made thus.

Take the root of Consolida majore one pound, and boil it in water until the
water be consumed, then stamp them in a Mortar, and pass them through a
Streiner, then put thereto as much white Honey as the matter weighs, and boil
them on a small fire, until it be come to the form of an Electuary, and when
it is boiled, put thereto these things.

Take the Rindes of Pomgranates in fine powder. i. Lignum aloes. vi. Mirrh,
Mastick, Sarcocolla, Sanguis draconis in grain, ana.. ii. Cinnamon,. i. Musk of
Levant dissolved in Rosewater, one Carret, then incorporate them well while it
be warm: You must note, that the body must first be well purged, ere ye take
this Electuarie, and ye must also keep a diet, that the Medicine may work the
better, for this helps all the aforesaid disease inwardly, as is said before:
You may use it emplaister wise upon the wounds, and on broken bones, and use it
inwardly, and so the Patient shall remain helped. With this I have seen men of
great age helped, that were burst below, and wounded from one part to the
other, and also broken bones and bruises, the which if I should write them, it
would not be credited.

CHAP. XIII. Vnguento magno Leonardo.
THis Vnguento magno is so called, by reason of his great virtue and operation,
for it works so strange in some diseases, that it in manner reviveth the
Patient, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Otnegra oviv.. vi. Oximel Squilliticum,. ss. mix them together in an
earthen dish, until the Otnegra oviv. be become like ashes, then it is
deisitrom, then put therein. ii. of Vinegar, and wash it well, until it remain
pure and clear, then take Olibanum. ss. Cerusae. i. Beat them fine, and mix it
in a stone Mortar, with as much Magno liquore, as will serve to incorporate
them well, then put thereto the Otnegra oviv. and mix them very well together,
that being done, put thereto Auxungia porcina,. viii. And mix them very well
together, and then it is made, the which keep in a vessel well glased, for it
will keep a long time without corruption, and is apt to help those that are
lame, full of pains, and sores and swellings, pains of the eyes, the stone in
the reins, and such like matters, it helps all man's of French Pox, if ye
anoint them therewith, until the Gums be sore and then leave. But ye shall
note, that the body must first be well purged before ye anoint them. This
Unguent cools all corrosive Ulcers, and helps them in short time, it
helps all pains in the eyes, if ye put it therein; and takes away all
burning with speed. And to be short, it helps those diseases in most short
time, so that it is to be wondered at.

CHAP. XIV. Oil of Hypericon, the which is most miraculous, for Wounds and
bruises.
THis Oil of Hypericon compounded by us, is of great virtue in diverse and
sundry accidents, and specially in wounds, for it helps them without any
pain, although the veins, sinews, or bones were hurt or cut, and that in very
short time: It preserves the wound from corruption, and takes away the pain,
and incarnateth and cicatrizeth, as by experience thou may plainly see. It
dissolveth Contusions, and is most mavelous against poison. It helps against
any crude sort of venomous Fever, if you anoint all the body therewith,
leaving no part; and the order to make it is thus.

Take the flowers, leaves, and seed, of Saint John's Wort, as many as ye will,
and stamp them together, and put them in a Glass, with as much strong white
wine as will cover it well, then set it in the Sun ten days together, then put
thereto as much pure Sallet oil, as the herbs and the wine does weigh, then
let it stand in the Sun other ten days, giving you warning that you weigh your
oil before you mix them; that being done, put thereunto for every pound of
oil. ii. of Turpentine, and. i. of Saffron, of Nutmegs, Cloves, Myrrha elect.
of each. ss. Frankincense. i. Viticella. ii. for every pound, stamp them
altogether, and put them into a great glass, and set it to boil in Balneo
Mariae, with a head and Receiver close shut, and to know when it is boiled
enough, is, that there will ascend no more vapors into the head, and that will
be within 24. hours, or thereabout, then take forth the Glass being yet hot,
and strain it, and keep it in a Glass close shut as a precious Jewel. Ye
shall note that this Oil must always be occupied very warm, and in any wise
^ent no wound, but wet clothes therein, and lay it thereon, and thy cure shall
prosper well, for this I have proved a thousand times in diverse places.

CHAP. XV. To make our Oleum Benedictum, the which heals wounds divinely.
THis Oleum Benedictum serves chiefly for wounds in all parts of the body,
and especially for wounds in the head: If there were fracture of bone, and
offenses of the Pannicle, and in other places where sinews were hurt, or
muskles, or veins, or in any other noble place of the body, with this Oleum
Benedictum, and with our Vegitable Quintessence, thou may help them easily,
and in short time, without any danger or detriment of the wounded person, as is
said before, and the order to make it is thus.

Take the whites of Eggs being hard sod in water,. xii. Clear Turpentine xiiii.
Pure Myrrh. iii. Mix them, and put it into a Retort of glass, and give it
gentle fire at the first, and then increase it according to Art, until all the
substance be come forth of the Retort, the which will be both water and oil,
the which separate, and keep the Oil by it self in a Glass as a precious
Jewel, for this works miracles in wounds of what sort soever they be.
Moreover, it causes hair to grow on the head or beard, the which were fallen
away, and that it does in short time by the only anointing the place
therewith. Also if any have a stitch in his side, and retention of Urine, let
him take a Glister, wherein he shall put a little of this Oil, and he shall be
helped; and this effect it does, because it dries mightily that alteration
made in the secret parts of the Reins inwardly, where no local Medicine can be
applied.

CHAP. XVI. Oleum Philosophorum de Terementina and Cera.
THis Oil of Turpentine and Wax, is a most precious Balm, and his virtues are
infinite, because it is made of simples in manner uncorruptible, and is most
miraculous for those that are corrupted, or stricken with the Pestilence,
because it is most penetrative, and of nature drying, and comfort all weak
parts in man's body, of what infirmity so ever they be, and the order to make
it is thus.

Take new yellow wax,. xii. clear Turpentine,. xviii. Benjamine,. ii. Fine
rectified Aqua vitae,. xxx. common ashes,. vi. mix them, and put them into a
Retort of glass well luted, and then distill it in a wind Furnace, until the
sustance be come forth, and in the Receiver thou shall find three things: The
first is Water, the second Oil, the third phlegm, the which thou shall separate
one from another, and keep them close stopped in a glass, the which is most
excellent in time of the Pestilence, as well for unction, as for to help the
sores, for if you put it into a sore or botch that is broke, presently it
takes away the pain, and being mixed with other of our Medicines, as I have
showed in my Regiment of the Pestilence, it helps them with great speed. If
any anoint all his body with this Oil twice a month, it will preserve him
youthful, and in health a long time, it preserves also dead flesh or fish,
that is put therein from corruption. Also if any be wounded in any part of the
body, let him anoint it with this Oil four or five times, and it shall be
whole: Also if any cannot make water, give unto him. ii. of this oil to
drink, and presently he shall make water. It is also good against the Stitch
in the side and Plurisie, and Worms, and the Cough and Catarre, and against the
Pestilent Fever, and such like indispositions, if ye drink a little thereof;
it has a number of other virtues, the which I will leave unto the
Experimentors.

CHAP. XVII. Our Magno liquore, the which is of great virtue.
THis is of my invention, and the order to make it, is thus Take sweet Sallet
oil twenty pound, white wine two pound, boil them together until the wine be
consumed, then put it in a vessel of stone, and put thereunto these things
following:

Take the flours of Rosemary three pound, Lignum aloes,. vi. Olibanum,
Bdellium, ana.. x. then stop it very close, and bury it in the ground four foot
deep, and this would be buried in the beginning of August, and there rema^n
until the month of March, then take it forth of the ground, and set it in the
Sun, and put thereto these matters following, Sage, Rosemary, Rue, Betonie,
Millefolie, Comferie roots, Tamaro, Viticella ana, one handful: Galingal,
Cloves, Nutmegs, Spikenard, Saffron, ana. i. Sarcocolla, Sanguis Draconis in
grain, Mastick, ana. ii. Aloes Epatica, Frankincense, ana. viii. yellow Wax,
Auxungia ana. xviii. Colophonie one pound, Hypericon with the seed and all two
pound. Musk. i. mix these all well together, and boil them in Balneo, until
the herbs become dry, and have no more substance, then take it forth, and
strain it, and put thereunto for every pound,. vi. of our Balm artificial, and
when the month of September comes, put thereunto two pound of the fruit of
the herb called Balsamina, the which are red, and then it is ended, the which
thou shall keep in a glass close shut, for the older it is, the better it is,
and is of such virtue, that it helps the Etici, and Hidropsie, if ye give
them every morning. ss. with. i. of Sirrup of Roses warm, the space of forty
days, as I have proved: And this is the true and perfect Unction, that helps
Petecchie, a disease so called in the Italian: If any were wounded, and had cut
veins, sinews, and bones, let him join the parts close together, and dress it
with this Oil very hot upon the upper parts, and in short time it shall be
whole, without any alteration. It helps also the white Scall if ye anoint it
therewith: It helps coldness in the head, and Catarrs, if ye anoint it
within the nostrils at night when ye go to bed: If ye anoint the Stomach
therewith it causes perfect digestion of the meat, it provokes Urine where it
is let through carnositie or Gonorrea, or such like matter; It causes hair to
grow, it preserves the beard black, and it is good against Worms, and all
these Experiments are true, and proved of me diverse and sundry times, in the
aforesaid infirmities, and also in diverse others, the which I leave until
another time: Ye shall note, that if ye anoint any all over that is greived
with the Pox with this Oil, it will increase his pain, and so by that means
ye may know whether he be infected or no.

CHAP. XVIII. Pillole Aquilone of our invention.
THese Pills are above all other in operation, as the Eagle is above all other
Birds, and therefore I thought good to call them Pillole Aquilone, and the
order to make them is thus.

Take conserve of Damask Roses made with Honey iii. Lignum Aloes. i. Oil of
Vitriol twelve grains, Cinnamon elect ii scruples. Petra philosophalis of our
invention. ss. Sugar-candie ii. Mix them, and make thereof a paste with Syrupo
Acetoso and keep them in a glass. The Virtue of these Pills I will not at this
time write: but only I say they help against all sorts of infirmities, and
hurts none in any wise. The Dose is from. i. to. ii. in the morning fasting,
but ye may not gild them in any wise, but drink after them a cup of water or
wine, to carry them down, then sleep thereon, and that day eat little meat.
and light of digestion.

CHAP. XIX. Our Quinta essentia solutiva, the which is of mavelous operation
in diverse matters.
THis Quinta essentia solutiva evacuateth the body with great ease, and without
any detriment, and it purges all parts of the body that are troubled with
gross and viscous humors, it resolves swellings, and takes away the pains,
it preserves the sight, and kills worms, and causes a good appetite, with
many other good qualities, the which I will leave at this time, and the order
to make it is thus.

Take Aloes, Cinnamon, Turbite, Aloes Epatica, ana. i Coloquintida. ii. Cloves,
Saffron, of each. i. Musk of Levant. i. Julep of Violets one pound. Mix all the
aforesaid matters together in a glass, and put therein two pound of our
Quintessence, and so let it stand twelve days, and then strain it, and put it
into a vessel of glass close shut, this may be taken with broth, wine, or
with what sirrup or potion ye will, the quantity is from. ii. to. ss. in the
morning fasting, without keeping of any diet at all, and it shall work well
without any trouble.

CHAP. XX. Pillole Magistrale, the which is good against diverse infirmities.
THese Pills are of great virtue, and specially against all kind of pains
coming of corrupt humors, for they purge the putrified humors, and preserve
the body from corruption: and the order to make them is thus.

Take Olibanum, Mastick, Mirrh, Sarcocolla, Aloes Epatiee, Elleborus niger,
Saffron, Turbith, Colloquintida, ana q. v. Stamp them finely, and for every
ounce of the aforesaid matters, put thereunto two Carets of Musk, and then
incorporate it with Honey of Roses, and Aqua vitae, of each alike, and this
paste thou may keep for six months in a vessel of Lead, the quantity is
from. ii. to. iii. in the morning fasting, and drink thereon a little wine.
These pills are most excellent to take away the pains of the Gout, and to
preserve a man from it, they are also good for those that have the French Pox,
because they evacuate the gross and viscous humors, and maintain the body in
good temperature, and using them in those diseases, it preserves the body in
good state. They are also good for women that are troubled with pains of the
Mother, and retention of their Terms, for these are aperative, and provoke
them, and purges the Matrix of all impediments contained therein: They serve
against the Megrem, and all pains of the head, and also against all kind of
putrified Fevers, as I have seen the experience thereof sundry times.

CHAP. XXI. To make Aqua reale, vel Imperiale, the which makes the teeth white
presently, incarnateth the Gums, and causes a good breath.
THe teeth being black and rustie, and full of filth, and the Gums putrified or
corrupt, are the worst things that may be seen in man or woman, and are also
very unwholesome; and the Remedy to make the teeth white, and to help the
gumms, is thus: Make this water, and use it in this order as I will show thee.

Take Sal Gemmae, Roch Alum, Brimstone of each two pound, Borax. x. Pearl beat
fine, Coral, each. ii. Pure distilled Vinegar. iiii. Put all the aforesaid
matters in a Goord, with his head and receiver, and give it fire according to
Art, and at the last there will come forth a white water like Milk, the which
after it has stood a while, will wax clear. You shall understand, that this
water is above all other waters in the world, to help Ulcers in the mouth, and
to incarnate the gums, and to make the teeth white, and causes a good breath
in those which are troubled with the aforesaid matters. For of this water I
have made great quantity, and it has been carried into Spain, into Almain,
into Poland, into Constantinople, and in diverse other Countries, as though it
had been a Divine thing, and not material.

For truly this experience does cause the world to wonder at it, the use hereof
I have written in this Book, and hereafter I will write it again in some of my
Books, where occasion shall serve to use it in cures.

CHAP. XXII. Of the hidden Secrets of Frankincense.
THe Pine is a tree, the which by nature is uncorruptible, and the gum that
runs from it is of great virtue and strength, because it preserves those
things wherein it is put, and when his Elements are separated out of that Gum,
the Physician may work strange things therewith, against most part of
infirmities that happen unto man's body, if he apply them where they are
convenient: For the water being drunk helps wind in the stomach: Also it
helps the white Skall, and all such like scabs, if ye wash them therewith
morning and evening. It dries up Ulcers, also it is of mavelous virtue
against chilblains and kibed heels, and chapps, and such like, in the hands or
feet that come through cold, being used thus. You shall first perfume the parts
that are sore over the fume of hot water, so that they may sweat, then dry
them and wash them with the aforesaid water, and anoint them with the Oil, and
put on a pair of gloves or such like, and in very short time they shall be
whole. The air helps much in wounds in any part of the body, because it
preserves the flesh from putrefaction, and keeps it from alteration, and
takes away the pain and heals the sore: Also it preserves the face if it
be anointed therewith. Moreover, it is mavelous in old diseases inwardly, if
ye give them thereof every morning i. with ss. of our Sirupo Vegetabile. The
fire cures sores and such like, and the earth remains in his state. Ye shall
understand, that these are great secrets of importance, the which I have
revealed of this Gum, and happy shall he be that uses them in the time of
need: And the order to make this Oil is thus.

Take as much Frankincense as thou will, and put it into a Retort of glass,
with the fourth part of common Ashes, and set it to distill, and give it first
a small fire until the Oil change color, then presently change the Receiver,
and augment the fire until all the substance be come forth. Ye shall
understand that this Oil is best fresh, for when it is old, it will wax
thick, and cannot pierce so well.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Oil of Honey, and the order to make it.
THat which most men call Oil of Honey, is not an Unctous Oil like unto other
Oils, but rather a certain Element, the which is neither oil nor water,
although it be clear, and this serves not much in Surgery, because it is
not convenient in sores, but much rather it is a perfect remedy in things
appertaining to Physic, because it comfort the Stomach, and fortifieth the
virtue, and extinguisheth all sorts of Fevers. It helps the Colic, it
dissolveth the Stone in the Reins, and provokes Urine, and also makes the
hair yellow as gold, if ye wash it therewith, and the order to make it is thus.

Take pure Honey two pound, and put it into a Retort of glass, that holds at
the least fifteen or twenty pounds, and set it in a Furnace, and give it a
fire of the second degree, and first there will come forth a clear white water,
and when it changes color, change the receiver, and give it strong fire
until all the fumes be come forth, the which is the Oil, and that keep by it
self as a precious Balm against malign Infirmities that are cured with Physic.

CHAP. XXIV. To make our great Cerot, the which is of mavelous virtue.
TAke Galbanum, Armoniacum, Oppoponax, ana. ii. Olibanum, Verdigrease, ana. i.
Bdellium, Gum Arabi, Lapis ematites minerale, ana. ii. Turpentine,
Frankincense, ana. iiii. Oleum Philosophorum of Turpentine and Wax,. iii.
common Oil four lb. new wax. vii. beat all those that are to be beat, and
searce them, then dissolve the Gums in distilled Vinegar according to Art, then
vapor away the Vinegar until it come thick, then take thy Oil and Wax, and
melt them together, then put in the rest, and stir them until it be boiled,
and to know when it is boiled, is this. First, in the beginning it will begin
to rise marvellously, and then fall down; then let it boil until it begin to
fume or smoke, then strein it into a vessel of Copper, and presently put
therein. iiii. of Precipitate, and stir them well together until it be cold,
then make it in rowls, and keep it as a precious Jewel in Chirurgerie, because
it mundifieth, incarnateth, and heals all sorts of Ulcers, better then any
other Cerot that ever I could find.

CHAP. XXV. A Magistrall Unguent that heals all manner of sores.
THis Unguent is most rare in the cure of Ulcers when they are already
mundified, because it incarnateth, dries, and siccatrizeth, and the order to
make it is thus.

Take common Oil one pound, Litarge. ii. new Wax,. iii. Turpentine,. vi. boil
them as the aforesaid Cerot, and when it is boiled, put thereto. iii. of the
dead cope of Aqua fortis, the which is made of Vitriol Romain, Roche Allom, and
Saltpeter, and stir them well together, and keep it to thy use. Ye shall
understand, that the maker must be expert in the Art, least he overboil it, or
boil it too little, for if it be not in order as it should be, it will not work
his effect.

CHAP. XXVI. A Magistrall Cerot of our Invention against the white Scall.
THis Cerot is of great virtue, and of mavelous experience, to resolve the
white Scall, because it is penetrative, mundificative, and resolutive, and
causes the hair to grow that is fallen away, to the great content of the
Patient and honor of the Physician, and it is made in this otder. Take
Frankincense that is strained from his filth, what quantity you will, and
distill it in a Retort, and give it fire at the least forty hours, then let it
cool and break the glass, and in the bottom thou shall find a black mase,
the which make into powder, then for every pound of the said powder, put
thereto one ounce of Wax, and four ounces of the said oil that ye distilled,
and half an ounce of the heads of Bees, the which are easy to be had in
Summer: Mix all the aforesaid things in a Vessel of Copper, and with a small
fire make them in form of a liquid Unguent, and when thou will use it, shave
the head, and wash it, and lay thereon this Cerot upon a fair cloth warm, and
every two days change it, and so in short time thou shall see strange effects
of his virtue, as I have done diverse and sundry times to my great honor. This
serves also against breaking of bones, dislocations, and for Scabs ulcerated,
because it dries, and comfort, and resolves all the evil qualities;
giving you charge in the distilling, because the fire many times consumes it
so, that in the bottom there remains nothing that good is, and therefore
beware in the making.

CHAP. XXVII. To make a divine and blessed Cerot against diverse infirmities.
ULcers are of diverse sorts, and are caused of sundry causes, as of Choler,
Blood, Phlegm, Melancholy, and for that cause the Medicines would be agreeable;
nevertheless, I will show thee a Cerot of such a temperature, that it will
serve to help any sore in any place of the body, of what quality soever it be,
except it be Scirro, or Noli me tangere, the which are in a manner counted
uncurable, of the common Practitioners: but not by me, for I have cured them,
and the order to make it is thus.

Take oil of Frankincense one pound, oil of Sulphur. i. Vitrioll rubified. iii.
Precipate. i. fresh Butter. iii. and as much Wax as will suffice to make it in
form of a Cerot, the which will have all the aforesaid intentions: because the
Precipitate does mundifie the Ulcer; the oil of Frankincense takes away the
pain, and incarnateth; the oil of Sulphur cleanses; the Vitrioll dries; the
Butter mundifieth; and the Wax consolidateth, in such sort, that any one may
perceive his virtue.

CHAP. XXVIII. To make a miraculous Emplaister for Flegmon, or Erisipella.
THis Flegmon or inflammation, called Saint Anthonies fire, is a tumor caused
of the alteration of the blood, by reason of superfluous heat, and this most
commonly comes unto Choleric and Sanguine bodies, that are full of flesh, and
have much blood: And the Erisipella is caused of a windy humidity, and of a hot
humor, and to show it, ye may see how that Flegmon is no other then blood
that runs to the place offended: And when it cannot find way to resolve, it
putrifieth and turns into Sanius matter, so that by this ye may see that to
be true which I have said. Also Erisipella is a wind hot and moist, for when it
comes to suppuration, then comes forth nothing but wind and water, and this
is the true proof by demonstration, and therefore seeing that these two
infirmities are in a manner alike, or little differing: this Medicine shall be
appropriate as well to the one as to the other, because it resolves and
cools, and the order to make it is thus.

Take fine Clay that has no stones nor gravel in it, and searce it very fine,
and put it in a pot, and for every pound thereof put thereto. iii. of Oil of
Frankincense, that comes forth last in the distillation, and as much of our
Quintessence as will serve to make it in form of a liquid Unguent, and this ye
must mix without fire, and then lay it upon a cloth, and warm it over the fire
a little, and lay it upon the Flegmon, or Erisipella, but first ere ye use
this remedy unto those that have Flegmon, ye shall give them a dose of our
Electuario Angelica, and in Erisipella give them a dose of our Aromatico, and
so thou shall help them perfectly, as I have proved diverse times, and may be
used although ye take no blood; but if ye take blood, let it be in augmentu,
and not in statu, nor in declinatione, because it would so weaken Nature, that
afterward it cannot defend it self to drive forth the humor peccant, that is
cause of the disease.

CHAP. XXIX. To make a resolutive Plaster of great virtue.
THis Plaster is to resolve tumors and hardness, if it be laid thereon very
hot, and when it is cold to lay on another: and this ye shall do until the
hardness be resolved, and it is made in this order.

Take common Ashes that are well burnt and white, and finely searced one pound,
Clay beat into fine powder half a pound, Carabe. iii. mix all these in an
earthen dish on a small fire, with Oil of Roses in form of a liquid Unguent,
and that ye shall lay upon the place greived as hot as ye may suffer it, and
change it morning and evening, and thou shall see it work a mavelous effect.
Moreover, when that Petecchi comes forth of a diseased, let him be folded in
the same remedy very hot, and in 24 hours he shall be helped, if he be first
well purged, for this is a great secret that I have revealed. This word
Petecchi is, as it were, certain spots like those which we call Gods Tokens,
the which commonly come unto those that have the Pestilent Fever.

CHAP. XXX. To make a maturative Plaster of great virtue.
THis Maturative does open an Imposthume without Instrument and pain, and the
order to make it is thus

Take the yolks of Eggs. ii. white Salt finely ground. i. Snails with their
Shells stamped. ss Hens dung that is liquid, and red like Honey. i. Mix all
these well together without fire, and when you will bring an Imposthume to
suppuration and break it, lay on this plaster morning and evening a little
warm, and in short time it will draw forth the Imposthume, and break it, and
heal it, without any other help. Keep this as a secret.

CHAP. XXXI. A composition of great virtue, against all Ulcers and Sores.
TAke Oil of Vitrioll that is perfect, as much as you will, and put it in a
glass, with as much oil of Tartar made by dissolution, and so let it stand ten
days. Then take. i. of that and. i. of pure Aqua vitae, and mix them
together, and therewith wash the hollow Ulcers, and they will heal in short
time. It helps any crude kind of scab or sore that is caused of the evil
quality of Nature.

CHAP. XXXII. A strange composition of great virtue.
THis Composition is divine in his operation, because it heals many
indispositions in our bodies, when it is applied rightly, and the order to make
it is thus.

Take water of Carduus Sanctus one pound, Oil of Honnie, one ounce, oil of
Sulphur,. ss. Mix them together, and let it settle till it be clear: for this
helps Ulcers in the mouth, and makes the teeth fair and white, if ye wash
them therewith. It causes a sweet breath, and preserves the Gums, and makes
the hair and beard fair, if ye wash them therewith. And this it does because
the water of Carduus Sanctus preserves where it is applied: Also the oil of
Honey has a virtue preservative and retentive of the hair, and the oil of
Sulphur mundifieth, and cleanses, and incarnateth, so that by these means the
said water has these virtues aforesaid.

CHAP. XXXIII. To make an Unguent of great Virtue against Ulcers.
THis Unguent has a great virtue in healing all sores that are putrified and
corrosive, except they be Cankers or Noli me tangere, the which are counted
among the uncurable cures: But when they are other sores, this will heal them
quickly, and the order to make it is thus.

Take a good quantity of Calex vivae, and put it into a great Tub, and cover it
with water four fingers high, and stir it well together, then let it settle,
and thereon will come a thin scum the which ye shall gather together with a
Scummer, and keep it until ye have sufficient quantity, then take oil of
Linseed, oil of Nuts, oil of Almonds, and of the said scum that is gathered,
of each one pound, then distill it in a Retort, until all the substance be
come forth, then separate the oil from the water, and then make this
composition.

Take of the said oil distilled one pound, Tallow such as they make candles
of, Hogs grease, new Wax, Mercury precipitate of each two ounces, fine Aqua
vitae iii. ounces, mix them all together in a Copper pan on a soft fire, until
the Aqua vitae be consumed, and that it remain a liquid Unguent, then take it
forth, and keep it in a close vessel, that it take no air: and this ye shall
apply cold unto Ulcers, upon a fine linen cloth, for first it does mundifie,
and then incarnate, and last siccatrize, it helps sores, scabs, scrophule,
mall de Formica Setole on the Nipples of women's breasts, Emeroids, pains in the
privy members, and such like, for it is temperate.

CHAP. XXXIV. A Discourse upon sundry sorts of Unguents, and their qualities.
THere are many sorts of Unguents that are found out, of which I believe that
many Chirurgians are greatly abused of their operation, but for that which I
do find, that some sorts of Unguents are occupied for one effect, and they
work another; as for example, Vnguento Camphorato which many do occupy to
cool hot sores, in stead of cooling heateth them more then they were before,
which comes by means of the Camphire which is a hot substance, as I will prove
by sufficient reason that it cannot be denied. For you shall understand, that
into Vnguento Camphorato, is put Camphire and oil, both hot materials, as for
experience: Take Camphire and lay it by the fire, or set it nigh a candle, and
thou shall perceive, that as soon as it feels the heat, it will fly into the
fire and burn fiercely; and the like will the Oil do; for if you wet a cloth
therein and hold it over the fire, presently it will burn, which are manifest
signs that they be both hot, becuse they are friends unto the fire; whereas if
they were cold and moist, the fire would not burn them with such force. As for
example, take water, earth, stones, and metals that are cold and moist, and
lay them on the fire, and you shall see that the flame of a candle shall not be
able to kindle the fire with such ease as it does with the Camphire and oil.
So that you may see that Camphire and Oil are hot and friends unto the fire
which is most hot, and earth, stones, and mettalls, are moist and cold, and are
enemies unto the fire, and therefore I conclude, that Vnguento Camphorato is
very hot, and cannot by any means cool hot Ulcers. Also Vnguentum Apostolorum
is a composition in which there is put Verdigriece, a material which is most
enemy unto the sore, for laying it thereto causes great pain, as you may
understand of those that have proved it, and in my judgment this is no Unguent
to be laid on a sore, because they cannot suffer it, neither is it possible to
heal the sore with that Unguent, for that it corrodeth the flesh and will not
let it heal. Also Vnguento de minio is a mixture not very profitable for
Ulcers, because it is too much drying; for applying it unto a sore that is not
mundified, it dries it in Superficie, so that if Nature send humors unto
those parts, and they find no exhalation or vent by reason of that drying, it
will cause the gathering of abundance of humors, and be a means of greater
mischief: But if the sore be well mundified and cleansed, you shall have little
need of that Unguent, because Nature will do it alone without any other help,
so that this Unguent is of small profit to be used of any. But to the contrary,
there are many sorts of Unguents which are most necessary to dress sores, as
Vnguento di Rasino, which by his Nature is friendly to the sore, because it
mundifieth and heals, helping Nature that it may work with greater speed. The
Diachilone commune is also an Unguent very profitable to mundifie or purge
sores, and likewise to siccatrize them. The Unguent of Litarge is refriscative
and drying, and heals scabs, and cools the heat of the flesh alterated.
Vnguento Rosato does mittigate the pains of foul Scabs. And thus discoursing
from time to time, there are many sorts of Unguents very hurtful, and not to
be used, and also there are many sorts that are wholesome and good, without
which in a manner they cannot work. Nevertheless, it were necessary to know
how and where to apply them rightly.

CHAP. XXXV. Medicines appropriate against all kinds of Poisons, as well
Vegetables as Minerals.
THere are an infinite number of Poisons, and they are differing in their
operation, but yet they work in manner one effect, as you may see by experience
in those that are poisoned, for after that they be dead, they are swollen and
become black, and in their Stomach is abundance of aquositie: And the cause is
this, that if a poison have power to kill or strangle a man or woman, of
necessity it must be corrosive, and being corrosive, it will work this effect,
that is, as soon as it arriveth at the stomach, it begins to make alteration
and quickly congealeth the blood, and enflameth the parts round about it, it
draws unto it great quantity of water; and it causes the congelation of the
blood on the one part, and the inflammation of the stomach on the other part,
and the gathering of the water on the other part. And in a manner all poisons
work one effect, and there are great number of these Poisons, of which I would
show their qualities, but that I fear I should cause such as are ignorant to
know them, and therefore I leave them. But I will write the order wherewith
thou shall help all those poisons that are curable, with as much facility as
is possible. Poisons, as I said before, do work three evil Effects, they
inflame the stomach, congeal the blood, and draw unto them great quantity of
water, which three things being in a man kills him out of hand; and the
necessariest cure in that matter of poison is this. First cause the poisoned
person to vomit so much as he can, and as soon as he can, and that thou shall
do with. ss. of our Electuario Angelica, which provokes vomit, and evacuateth
the stomach of the poison, and of the matter drawn by the poison into the
stomach, and it is excellent against all kind of poisons; that being done,
anoint all his body with our Balsamo artificiato, the which will keep the
blood liquid, and will not suffer it to congeal by any means: after that let
him take every morning. iii, of our Pills against poison, which are written in
my discourse upon Surgery; and when he has taken those Pills, let him drink
thereon a little good wine: and after let him drink the decoction of Diptamo
bianco, and dress his meat with herbs that are good against poison, as there
are a great number: And this doing, by the help of God thou shall help all
those that are curable, for it is a rational Medicine and experimented, which
works incredible operations.

CHAP. XXXVI. A water that preserves the Face and Teeth.
THis water is miraculous, for if ye wash the face therewith, and rub the
teeth, it will make the face shining and bright, and the teeth like fine Ivory,
and the order to make it is thus.

Take Mother of Pearl in powder one pound, the juice of Lemmons pressed with
their pills and all three pound, put them in a glass, and let it stand fifteen
days, then put thereto so much strong distilled Vinegar as there was of the
juice, and distill it in a Retort of glass, with a small fire, until the
spirits do appear, then presently change thy Receiver, and keep it, wherewith
thou shall wash thy face and rub thy teeth: Note, that when ye will occupy
that water, it were necessary that the face were washed so clean as is
possible, and to rub the teeth with a clean cloth, for with this I have seen
many goodly experiences in those matters.

CHAP. XXXVII. To Clarify and take away spots out of the Face.
TAke Lac virginis two parts, pure Oil of Tartar one part, fine Aqua vitae six
parts, mix them, and when thou go to bed anoint thy face therewith, and in
the morning wash thy face with the decoction of Bran, and dry it well, then
anoint it with the Oil of Almonds, and so using this order, in short time thy
face will be bright and clear without any spot. For this Composition is of
mavelous virtue to preserve the flesh, and to defend it from all impediments
of Nature, and preserves the head from many infirmities.

CHAP. XXXVIII. The order to make a goodly Remedy, to cause the hair to grow.
THe beard and hair commonly do fall through two causes, the one is, when the
Patient has a Pestilent Fever, that is, Mal di Mazzucco, for when they are
cured, all their hair will fall away, and many times most of them do change
that subtle skin, called of the Doctors Epiderma, and this is one of the
causes: The other cause is, when they accompany with unclean women, and that
they get those Carvoli on the Yeard, the which as soon as they are cured, there
comes an alteration in the throat, so that they cannot well eat their meat,
then after that in short time the hair will begin to fall, and these are the
two causes of falling of the hair. In that which comes after Mal di Mazzucco,
ye shall need nothing else but to anoint the head when ye go to bed, with
our Oleum Philosophorum a little warm, and that will cause the hair to grow,
restore the sight and hearing, the which those commonly do lose when they are
sick, through their long sickness. But when the hair does fall through the
other cause, ye must use forcible Medicines to cause it to come again, and
that thou shall do with this Cerot. Take Turpentine, Ship-pitch, Rosin of the
Pine tree, and new Wax, and make thereof a Cerot, the which spread upon a
cloth, and strew thereon Cantharides in powder, then lay it upon the head, and
there let it remain five days without moving it, and when ye take it away,
take Magno liquore, and our Oleum Philosophorum, of each alike, and therewith
anoint the head once a day very hot. And while ye use this Unction, take
Sinaber. i. Olibanum, Mirrh, and Colles, of each two scruples, and grind them
together, and divide them in six parts, and every night when ye go to bed,
perfume the bed with one of these parts, the which thou shall do in this
order: Take Coals in a Chafing Dish, and cast it therein by little and little,
and then cover thy head with a cloth, and receive the fume, and then go to bed
with the said cloth about thy head, and this thou shall do six evenings, and
continually use the Unction until it be helped, the which will be in short
time.

CHAP. XXXIX. To make our Sirrup of Bays.
THis Sirrup being well made, is of mavelous virtue for those women that are
troubled with pains of the Mother, and pains caused of wind and cold, because
the Bays of their nature are hot and drying, and resolves the wind, and
warmeth the cold, and dries the humidity, so that whosoever does use this
Sirrup oftentimes, shall be free from the stitch in the side, and gravel in
the Reins, because it does mundifie the Reins, and resolve the humor hanging,
and therefore this would be used in Polonia, and Almaign with great profit,
because those Countries are cold, and they feed on most meats which are
contrary to those aforesaid infirmities, and the order to make it is thus. Take
a branch of Bays weighing one pound, and put it in a glass with eight pound
of white Wine, and two pound of purified Honey, and distill it in Balneo three
hours, then take it from the fire, and keep that by it self, then take that
which remained in the glass, and distill it by a filter three or four times
until it be clear, then take two pound of Sugar, and clarify it with the
white of an Egg, and then mix it with that which ye distilled by a filter,
and give it a little walme or two, but not too much, then when it is boiled,
before it be cold, put therein the said water that ye distilled in Balneo, and
aromatise it with six grains of Musk, and. i. of Cloves, and another of
Saffron, and. ss. of Cinnamon, and. iii. of Rosewater, and then keep it in a
glass close stopped, and it will preserve a long time: The dose of this Sirrup
is from. i. to. ii. and no more. And therefore if any will sweat for any
indisposition in the body, let them take four ounces as warm as they may
suffer, and lay them down to sweat, and it will resolve great infirmities.

CHAP. XL. The order to make a Sirrup of Cinnamon and Ginger.
THis Sirrup is exceeding hot, and preserves a weak stomach through cold,
resolves the Cough, and the Catarre caused through want of natural heat: but
ye shall note, that if the indisposition were of a hot and dry cause, in any
wise ye shall not use this. It causes digestion, and provokes venereous acts,
and kills many that oppress themselves therewith, for they will do more
then Nature is able to carry, and so fall into a disease called Apoplexia, and
die, or else live with great pain; and therefore I would wish those that have
no great need thereof, not to use it for Lechery sake, for better it were to
leave it in Vase spermatico, but as for those that have need thereof, it will
revive them if they were in a manner dead, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Ginger, Cinnamon, of each one pound, beat them in powder, and infuse it
in half a pound of Rosewater, and there let it remain four or five days, and
then put thereon. iiii. of the water of a Herb called Mortella, in the Italian
tongue, and six pound of the best white wine, and distill them altogether
until all the substance be come forth; then take as much white Honey as the
matter purified weighs, and while it is yet hot on the fire, put therein the
said Water which you distilled, and six grains of Musk powdered with Sugar, and
incorporate them well together, and keep it in a glass close shut, and when ye
will use this, ye shall take it in the morning warm, fasting thereon four or
five hours, because it may pierce the better, and do his operation; the
quantity that you shall take ordinary is. i. but if it do not work his
operation well, augment the quantity, and take somewhat more or less
according to thy stomach, and the time shall be two or three weeks, or more or
less, according as thou feel thy self, for it is of so much virtue that it
will not be credited, except it be of those that have seen the experience
thereof, therefore keep it as a thing of value.

CHAP. XLI. Our Sirrup of a Capon, that is made with Consumato.
THis Sirrup is a restorative of great virtue, never seen or heard of before,
and is of such virtue that it is able to sustain a sick person many days
without taking any other meat, because it is of flesh and blood, for the flesh
sustaineth the flesh, and the blood sustaineth the blood, and the order to make
it is thus.

Take a great fat Capon that is well-fleshed, and pull it while it is alive,
and take forth only the gutts and the belly, and when he is dead, stamp it in
a Mortar grossly, and put it in a distilling glass with twenty pound of good
white wine, and. ss. of Salt, and four ounces of Sugar, and. ss. of Cinnamon,
then distill it in Balneo until the two thirds be consumed, then keep that
which is distilled, and that which remained in the glass strain through a
cloth, and press out all the juice of the flesh with a Press, then pass all
that through a filter, and then with Sugar make it in form of a Sirrup, but
boil it not too much, then put therein that which ye distilled from the Capon,
and aromatise it with Cinnamon half a dram, Saffron one scruple, Musk four
grains, Rosewater. ii. then keep it in a glass close stopped, and this has no
dose, because it is taken only to sustain a weak nature; you may put it in
broth, or in any other meats, or by it self, and always it will work his
operation, in strengthening those that are weak.

CHAP. XLII. A Magistrall Sirrup of Quinces, the which is Restorative.
THis Sirrup of Quinces is of great virtue, because it restores strength,
helps digestion, comfort the Stomach, and makes the heart merry, as you
may see by the Ingredients; it comfort also the sight, and quickens the
memory: And the order to make it is thus.

Take of the best Quinces you can find, and cut them in small pieces, with seed
and all three pound, Cinnamon half an ounce, Cloves, Saffron, of each a
scruple, Lignum Aloes, i. ss. Bengewine. i. stamp all these and infuse them in
seven pound of strong white wine, then distill it in Balneo, until all the
liquor be come forth, and when it is in manner done, take it from the fire, and
put it into an earthen vessel well glazed, and put therein that which ye
distilled, and mix them well together, then strain it hard through a Canvas,
and pass it by a filter, or a linen cloth, and make it as clear as you can
possible, then take that, and with refined Sugar, make a Sirrup according to
Art, and when it is made, aromatise it with Musk, and Rosewater, and keep it in
a glass close stopped, that it take no air, giving your charge that it be not
over-boyled. And this thou shall give unto those that cannot digest their meat,
because it warmeth the stomach, with a temperate heat, the which resolves the
cruditie of humors, that are in the stomach, and disposes Nature to
digestion, for because the Quinces by nature are hot, and helps it to digest,
the Cloves and Saffron make the heart merry, and the Lignum Aloes, preserves
from Corruption, in such sort, that all these being together, works
wonderful effects in the body of many, the quantity thereof is. i. in the
morning, and two hours after supper cold.

CHAP. XLIII. A Magistrall Sirrup of Lignum Sanctum.
THis Magistrall Sirrup is of such virtue in his operation, that it will help
the Mal' Francese, if it be made according to the order, and taken as it should
be: And the order to make it is thus.

Take Lignum Sanctum rasped. vi. the Bark of the same. iiii. and lay it to
infuse in twelve pound of good white wine, with one pound of white honey, then
distill it until ye have received three pound, then take it from the fire, and
keep the water by it self; then take that which remained in the glass, and
distill it by a filter until it be clear, then put thereto the water that ye
distilled away, and for every pound of that water put thereunto. iii. of Julep
simple, and mix them well together, and keep it in a Bottle of glass well
stopped, for this is mavelous in the cure where Sweatings is needful: For if
ye give five or six ounces of this, as hot as he may suffer it, and cover him
in the bed, he shall sweat marvellously, the which sweating resolves cold
tumors, pains, and diverse other indispositions, that are to be resolved by
sweat. And as for the cure of the Pox, this is a most sovereign remedy, when
there are tumors, or pains, or inflations. But when there are Ulcers, Scabbs,
or Inflammations, in that case you may not use it by any means, because it is
very hot, and will cause greater inflammation. And therefore if any will use
this Sirrup to cure pains, swellings, or inflammations, it were necessary
first to take our Aromatico, written in this Book, with diverse other Medicines
of our Invention, that being done, let him take seven or eight times our
Sirrupo solutivo,, and then begin to take this Sirrup, and sweat thereon
morning and evening: His meat shall be roast Mutton, or a Bird, Raisins, Dates,
Almonds, and such like, but he must not eat too much. His bread shall be
Biscuit, and his drink good wine at meals, and if it do happen that he be bound
in the body, ye shall give him every week once our Sirrupo Solutivo, and so
continue with his sweating until he be helped.

CHAP. XLIV. A Sirrup of Juniper Berries.
THis Sirrup of Juniper Berries is of great virtue, because it is one of those
fruits that continues green all the year: of the which herbs I have written a
discourse in my book called La Physica del Phioravante, and the order to make
it is thus.

Take Juniper Berries when they begin to wax black four pound, and stamp them,
and infuse them in twelve pound of strong white Wine six days, then distill it
with two pound of white Honey, and. i. of Cinnamon, until ye have received two
pound, then take it from the fire, and strain out the Fesses that remained with
a press, then strain it by a filter again, then with Sugar make a Sirrup in
good form, and when it is boiled, put therein the said water distilled from the
berries, and so without fire incorporate them well together, and keep it in a
glass close shut that it take no air: the dose is an ounce and a half to be
taken warm. This is excellent for those that are troubled with wind, or
coldness of the stomach, because it warmeth, dries, and helps digestion,
and therefore this would work miraculous effects in Almaign, because it is a
cold Region, and that they eat many moist meats, the which Nature cannot well
digest: It is also appropriate against pains of the Mother, because it
provokes menstrua, and purges the Matrix, and helps digestion, and causes
sleep, with diverse other virtues.

CHAP. XLV. To make a Sirrup of the Bran of Wheat.
THis Sirrup is of mavelous virtue against diverse infirmities, for by nature
it is hot, and provokes sweat, and urine, and serves very much against the
French diseases, if you can use it in his time and place, and it is made in
this order.

Take Bran one pound, and infuse it in twelve pound of white Wine, and so let
it remain two days, then boil it in a glass with a Head and Receiver, until
the third part be consumed, the which ye shall reserve to mix with it
afterward, then strein that in the glass, and pass it by a filter, and when
it is clear, put thereunto the aforesaid which ye reserved: Then take Honey and
Sugar, of each alike, and therewith make a Sirrup according to art, and when it
is made, aromatise it with a little Cinnamon, Cloves, Saffron, Lignum Aloes,
and Musk, according to thy discretion, and for every pound of the said matter,
ye shall put thereto half an ounce of our Vegitable Quintessence, and it shall
be finished, the which keep close shut, for it is of such virtue, that it will
not corrupt, the dose is from. ii. to three, to be taken warm, and then lie
down to sweat, for this will resolve all infirmities that may be resolved by
sweat. It is very profitable for those that are troubled with any old
indisposition, as the Cough, the Catarre, indisposition of the Stomach, and
such like: Ye shall note, that this would not be used in the Summer, for
because it is too hot for that time.

CHAP. XLVI. To make a Sirrup of Sarsa parilla, of our invention.
THe Sarsa parilla is a Root that comes from the Indies, the which is hot and
drying, of the which Physicians make Sirrups and Potions for diverse
infirmities, wherein it is needful of drying by sweat: but until this time
they have all abused themselves in the order, because all hot and dry things
are spiritual, and so in making their decoction the spirits go away in fume,
and the decoction remains senza anima, and virtue, in respect: ye shall
understand, that the Sarsa parilla is a root miraculous in his operation,
because it warmeth the cold, and dries the humidity, and resolves tumors,
and heals sores, and helps pains, when it is made according to our order,
and because it is a Medicine in so common use, I will show thee the order to
make this Sirrup, that shall have both anima, and virtue, in so much that the
world shall wonder at it: and the order to make it is thus.

Take one pound of the best Sarsa parilla that ye can find, and cut it very
small, and put it in a glass with one pound and a half of Honey, and. i. of
Cinnamon, and. ii. of Lignum Aloes, and put them in twelve pound of white Wine,
and so let it stand four and twenty hours, and then distill it, until ye
have received three pound of water, giving you charge, that the Receiver be
great, and lute not the mouth but stop it with Tow least it break, then take it
from the fire, and let it wax cold, and when it is cold, pour forth that which
is clear, and put it unto the water that ye distilled first, and keep it
close, for it is a blessed Sirrup: this being done, put upon the Fesses twenty
pound of white Wine, and one pound of fine Sugar, and let it boil half an hour,
and then strein it, and when the Physician will give it, he may give. viii. at
a time as hot as he may suffer it, and then lay him down to sweat as much as he
can. And with his meat let him drink the last decoction, and thus the Physician
shall reap honor, and the Patient health, and therefore if any will have his
intent, let him not break this our order in any respect.

CHAP. XLVII. To make a Potion of China as it ought to be.
THis China is a root like unto the root of Canna, the which is brought unto us
out of India, from an Isle called China, from whence it took his name China,
and there are of two sorts: the one is white and heavy, the other is great, and
red, and light, and of this I have made no experience at all: But of the other
I have had great experience, and by the help of God have resolved great and
terrible diseases, and the order to condite them after our order is this.

Take. vi. of China, and. iii. of Lignum Aloes of the best that ye can find,
and. iiii. of Pollipodie, and. i. of Coloquintida, beat all these grossly, and
put them into a distilling glass, with twenty pound of good Wine, then give it
fire until ye have received three pound of water, then let it cool, and strain
it, then put therein the water that ye distilled first, and incorporate them
well together, and of this give. iiii. at a time warm, then cast away the
Fesses, for they are unprofitable. But the Sirrup is of such virtue, that it
resolves tumors, sores, pains, and all other indispositions caused of the
Pox. It serves also for Doglie Artetich, for pains of the Gout, and for many
other indispositions caused of cruditie, and coldness of the humors, because
it is of nature hot and drying, and his virtues are to dry: I have seen of
this Sirrup great experience in diverse and sundry causes.

CHAP. XLVIII. A Potion of Alchachengie, and wherefore it serves.
THis Herb Alchachengie with his fruit is aperative, and most profitable for
those that cannot make water, by reason of alteration of the pores that are
altered through cold, for this is hot and drying, by the which means, it
resolves the alteration of the aforesaid cause, and causes the Urine to pass
with ease; It helps the digestion, and comfort the stomach, when it is
grieved through wind or cold: And the order to make it is thus.

Take that Herb, with Root, Leaves, fruit and all, and lay it to infuse in the
water of Mallows, with the Herb Pelitorie, and there let them remain five or
six days, then put thereunto course Sugar, and let it boil one hour and no
more, and then strain it, and put thereunto a little Cinnamon, and then it is
finished: and when you will occupy it against difficulty of Urine, give them
thereof. iiii. and keep them warm in bed, and they shall feel great ease.

CHAP. XLIX. A Pectorall Potion, of our new Invention.
THis Potion is appropriate against the indisposition of the Breast and
Stomach, and is of a mavelous operation, because it is aperative, softning
the stomach, and mundifieth the breast, and makes the heart merry: And this
is most sovereign for the Cough, Catarr, and all the other indispositions, that
come unto the breast through cruditie, and viscositie of humors, and the order
to make it is thus.

Take Pomi Calimani, and Pomi Apiae, of each one pound, Quinces half a pound,
common Honey,. iiii. fine Sugar one pound, sweet white wine ten pound, water of
Bugloss four pound, boil all these together in a Copper Vessel, that is well
tinned within, until the Apples do begin to fall in pieces, then take it from
the fire, and strain them through a strainer, without pressing of the Fesses,
then put into that two drachms of Cinnamon, and then strain it by a filter four
or five times, until it be clear, then keep it in a vessel of glass close
stopped, that it take no air. The quantity is. iiii. as warm as ye may, take
it in the morning, fasting at least five or six hours after it, and if it be
possible sleep thereon in your bed, for it is a thing of great virtue, in
resolving the indisposition of the breast and stomach.

CHAP. L. To make a Potion of Camedrios, and Iva Artetica, which dissolveth all
Fevers that come with cold.
THe Herb Iva Artetica, as I have showed in another place, is of mavelous
virtue, also the Camedrios is of great virtue, and is hot and dry by nature.
The Iva is good against the accident of the Fever, and the Camedrios dissolveth
the melancholy humor; and therefore when a decoction is made of these two
Herbs, it will work a mavelous effect in the cure of the said Fever, because
it provokes sweat, and assubtiliateth the grossness of the humor, and
extinguisheth the accident of the Fever in such sort, that the Fever shall
resolve with good success, and the order to make that Potion is thus.

Take Camedrios, and Iva Artetica, of each one pound, and dry them in the
shadow, Lignum Aloes. i. the seed of Walwort. iiii. common Honey. vi. fine
Sugar one pound, strong white wine xvii. pound: Mix all these together in a
distilling glass, and so let it stand three days, then distill forth three
pound, and let it cool, and strain it through a Searce, and put thereunto the
water that ye distilled out before, then pass it by a filter three or four
times until it be clear, then keep it in a Glass close shut that it take no
air, and it will last a long time without corruption, and when any will take
it against the said Fever coming with cold, give him every morning fasting. v.
warm, and let him lie down to sweat as much as he may, and fast thereron at the
least four hours, and take heed ye eat no things that are cold, and moist, for
they will hinder the cure very much, and at night when he goes to bed, give
him. iii. warm, and if it hap that in his sleep he sweat, dry him well with
warm clothes, and thus doing, in short time he shall be delivered of that
infirmity, for this I have used diverse and sundry times to my great honor,
and profit of the Patient.

CHAP. LI. To make a Potion that is good against all Infirmities.
THis is a Magistrall Potion, the which helps against all Infirmities, by
reason that it destroys all the evil qualities in our bodies, it comfort
Nature, helps digestion, provokes Urine, and loses the body, the which
things are most comfortable to our bodies, and the order to make it is thus.

Take the seed of Quinces,. x. the Pills of Citrons,. vi. Balm, Nettles, of
each,. iiii. beat all these grossly, and infuse them in twelve pound of strong
white wine, and there let it remain six days, then distill it with. vi. of
Honey, and. xv. of Sugar, until ye have received two pound of water, then take
it from the fire and let it cool, and strain it by a filter, and then put
therein the first water, and eight grains of Musk, dissolved with a little
Rosewater about. ii. and then for every pound of the said matter, put
thereunto. i. of Oil of Vitrioll, and incorporate them well together, then
keep it in a glass close stopped that it take no air, and of this ye shall
take. i. in the morning cold, and fast thereon; for whosoever does use this in
his health shall seldom be sick, but live in health. For in this composition
there enters the seed of Quinces, that resolve the evil quality of the
Stomach, and make the heart merry: The Pomcitrone pills preserve and help
digestion: The Balm purifieth the blood, heals the Liver, causes good
digestion, and comfort the Heart: The Nettles warmeth, provokes Urine, and
mundifieth the Reins, and resolves the malignity of the Sinews: The Wine
comfort Nature, strengthens the Head, and sustaineth the strength: The
Musk is warm by Nature, and resolves the windiness, and purges the blood:
The Oil of Vitrioll heals all the Scoriaciones of the Mouth, the Breast, and
Stomach, and preserves the body from all corruption: So by this ye may see of
what importance this Composition is, through the virtue of the Simples that are
therein: so to conclude, I say, that this is one of the best Compositions that
can be made, because of his nature: It lets alteration in our bodies, and
helps against all diseases or infirmities, and prolongeth life.

CHAP. LII. An Infusion with Wine most precious against the Gout.
THe Gout is a putrified and rotten disease, as I have written of in diverse
places, and the cure thereof is hard, because it were needful to help many
inconveniences before ye come to the cure. Nevertheless, it is a strange
thing to see diverse, that after they are cured they have no care to preserve
them: so that look which way they got it, that way it will come again, but if
they would use defensives and preservatives, they may remain well, and
therefore I have devised this Wine, the which they shall continually drink: for
as long as they use this Wine, the Gout shall never trouble them, and the order
to make it is thus.

Take Vino negro that is sweet and pleasant, about twelve gallons, and put it
in a vessel that is well seasoned, and in that Wine put fine Lignum Aloes in
powder. iii. Pollipodie of the Oak. iiii. Sena of Levant. ii. Musk dissolved in
Rosewater ten grains, common Honey two pound, then let it repose until it be
clear, and then begin to drink thereof; for this Wine purges, the which if it
purge too much, ye shall refrain it now and then, according as ye find your
body: This does not only help the Gout, but all kinds of pains caused of
corruption of humors, because it dries, resolves, and preserves, the which
are convenient to preserve the body.

CHAP. LIII. Another artificial Wine, against the stitch in the side, and
gravel.
THe stitch in the side, and the gravel in the Reins, are somewhat of kin
together, because they are caused of one cause, that is, of vapors corrupt and
rotten, and of grossness, and evil qualities of the humors, the which, one
with the other, engender that infirmity, which in some men is no other then an
evil indisposition inwardly, the which is very hard to be helped, for if thou will resolve it, it were necessary, first to remove the evil quality, and then
cure it, and after they are cured to preserve them, that the said indisposition
return not again, and in so doing thy cure shall have good success, and
therefore I have made this Wine to preserve thee from that indisposition, and
the order to make it is thus.

Take as it were a Hogshead or a Barrel of good white Wine, that contains
about eighteen gallons of Wine, in the which ye shall put Carduus Benedictus.
ii. Saxifrage. vi. Walwort. iiii. Pollipodie. iiii. Cinnamon. i. Spikenard half
an ounce, Lignum Aloes. ii. fine Sugar three pound, then let it repose three or
four days, and then begin to drink it, for ye may use it with small wine, or
water, or in what order ye will. And in the mean time that ye take this
drink, ye shall not eat fat Pork, nor any other fat meat, nor Butter, Milk,
Cheese, or Pie-crusts, or such like things, that are of gross and hard
digestion, because they will let the operation of this wine. For whosoever does
use this wine, shall never be troubled with those kinds of infirmities, because
it does losen the belly, mundifie, cleanse, and preserve from all evil
qualities. I call to remembrance that in the City of Naples, where I dwelled
six years, I caused diverse and sundry persons to use this Wine, and they found
such profit thereby, that it was to be wondered at, for in that City* there
were many troubled with the said indisposition, in respect of Hogs flesh, fish,
and such other moist things as they commonly eat in that City, and therefore
whosoever uses this Wine shall not be troubled with the said infirmities.

CHAP. LIVE. To make a Quintessence of mavelous virtue.
THe Quintessence is so called, because it is an essence taken from the
Elements without corrupting the said Elements; and therefore it is called
Quinta essentia: for it is an essence above the four Elements, the which has a
mavelous virtue in preserving, and conserving all things from putrefaction,
and is of so much virtue, that drinking thereof every morning half an ounce
when they rise out of their bed, it preserves them for ever in health. It
heals wounds and all sores, washing them therewith. It preserves all flesh,
fish, and fruits, that is put therein, and the order to make it is thus.

Take good strong Wine fourteen pound, common Honey one pound, Anniseed,
Coriander, Lignum Aloes, Calamus Aromaticus, of each. iii. Rosewater. iiii.
Beat all the aforesaid things grossly, and infuse them in the said Wine two
days, and then put them in a Goord of glass, and distill it by Balneo, so
long until the water that comes forth do burn, and when it will not burn,
distill no more, then keep that which is distilled in a glass close stopped
that it take no air, and so keep it until thou have occasion to use it, for it
is a most rare liquor, because, as I have said before, it resolves all the
indispotions that happen unto man's body. For of this Composition the ancient
Doctors had small knowledge, nor of many things more written in this book. If
any man desire to have this Quintessence more perfecter, let him take a tenth
part of good Honey, with a little fine Cinnamon, and distill it again by Balneo,
and the Phlegm will remain all in the bottom of the vessel, and the
Quintessence will be so fine, that the air will take it away, and therefore he
that can make this well, shall work strange cures therewith, so that the world
will wonder thereat:

CHAP. LV. To make Diatartaro, the which is mavelous in diverse infirmities.
THis Diatartaro is good against pain of the stomach, of the body, and for
those that are slipticke of body, that cannot go to stool, and such like
matters, because it is of nature temperate and lenitive, and has virtue to
heat and dissolve the evil quality, and it is made in this order.

Take Pears of what sort ye will, and cut them in four pieces, then boil them
in water till they be soft, and that the water be almost consumed, then pass
it through a strainer, and put thereunto as much white Honey purified as it
weighs, and thereof make an Electuary in good form, and when it is made,
aromatise it with Musk, then for every pound of the said Electuary, put
thereunto. i. of perfect oil of Tartar, made by dissolution after it is
calcined white: But ye shall note, that the Oil must be put in when the
Electuary is cold, and so mix it together, then keep it in a glazen vessel:
The dose is from. ss. to an ounce in the morning fasting, and eat no meat in
four hours after: for this, as I have said, will cure the indisposition of the
Stomach, pains of the Milt, pains of the Body that have continued long, pains
of the Mother, and such like things that are caused of cold and moist humors.

CHAP. LVI. A Composition of great value to comfort the Stomach.
AMong all the compositions that the Apothecaries have, this is one of the best
and most perfectest, because it comfort the stomach that is weak, and
spoiled through a long and fastidious infirmity, for it is of a temperate
heat, and helps to digest, causes sleep, and comfort the breast, and the
composition is this.

Take the best Honey that ye can get, and clarify it with Rosewater and the
white of an Egg, as ye would do Sugar, and scum it very well, then take as
much fine Sugar as ye have of Honey, and incorporate them together on a small
fire, and when it is come to the thickness of an Electuarie or thereabout, for
every pound of the said matter, ye shall put. i. of our Quintessence
Vegitable, and. ii. of Oil of Almonds newly made, and stir them well together
being cold, then put thereto a little Musk and Cinnamon to give it a pleasant
smell, then keep it close: The quantity is. i. more or less* according to the
strength of the stomach; ye may temper it with good broth if ye will, and fast
thereon four hours at the least, and thou shall see strange effects of this
composition.

CHAP. LVII. To make a stomachall Emplaister to cause digestion where it
wants.
THere are many causes that hinder digestion, as through coldness of the
Stomach, through heat, through moistness or dryness, or through superfluous
choler, or phlegm, or melancholy, of the which things the Physician cannot
certify himself which it is, so by that means many proved diverse Remedies for
that indisposition, and cannot find the way to help it. And therefore I will
show thee a plaster that has all these four principal intentions; that is,
to help digestion, strengthen the stomach, make the heart merry, which things
are all necessary to preserve a man within good temperature and health, and
the Remedy is this.

Take these Herbs gathered in their times and dried, that is, Sage, Rosemary,
Wormwood, Balm, Saint John's Wort, Nettles, of each as much you will, beat them
finely, and searce them: then take for every pound of that powder of Cinnamon,.
i. half an ounce of Cloves, and as much Lignum Aloes, and ten grains of Musk
dissolved in Rosewater; then take for every pound, of good Honey. ii. and as
much Vinegar, and make them into the form of a liquid Plaster, and when thou will occupy it, spread it upon a cloth warm, and lay it to the stomach, and in
the mean while eat restorative meats, and drink small wine.

CHAP. LVIII. A rare Secret to help the Eyes.
THis is a great Secret for those that have lost the sight of their Eyes, and
was never written of before of any man, but of me, and the order to make it is
thus.

Take Swallows and stamp them feathers and all in a Mortar, then take for every
pound of that,. iiii. of bread, and four pound of white wine, and so let it
stand six days to infuse, then distill it by Balneo until all the substance
be come forth, then keep that water in a glass close stopped, and set it in
the Sun twenty days, and then use morning and evening to drop it in the eyes,
and thou shall see strange operations of the same Experiment, for it takes
away the dimnesse of the eye, quickneth the sight, and comfort the brain,
that it cannot be hurt by any means.

CHAP. LIX. To make a Liquor to comfort the Smelling, and to preserve the Head.
THe Smelling is one of the five Senses of our Body, of the which four-footed
beasts have great use; for they will not receive any thing into the body
before they have smelled unto it, and then if it be against their nature, they
will not eat it, and therefore this smelling is that which preserves the
hearing, the seeing and the taste; for if the nose take an evil smell, all the
other senses have part: For if ye smell to Onions or Scallions, the taste will
be troubled, the eyes will weep, the ears will also be troubled: And to the
contrary, when a man smells a good smell, it comfort the eyes, the
hearing, and taste, and for that cause I have made this liquor, to comfort the
Smelling, for by that the whole body is comforted, and the order to make it is
thus.

Take Lignum Aloes. ii. Annise seed,. iiii. Calamus Aromaticus. i. Calaminte
dried, three ounces, common Honey two pound, strong white wine twelve pound,
let all these be infused for four days, and then distill it in Balneo, and
when ye distill it, put into the Receiver six grains of Musk dissolved in two
ounces of Rosewater, and distill away but three pound, the which keep in a
glass close stopped, and when ye will comfort the smelling, wash the face and
beard therewith, and thou shall smell a savor of mavelous effect, the which
comfort Nature marvellously: It comfort the Stomach, and helps a
stinking breath: It helps the mouth being ulcerated, and those that have the
Rupture in short time, if ye wash it twice a day therewith. It helps also
women that are troubled with dissension of the Matrix, if ye wet a cloth
therein and lay it upon the Mother, in short space it shall receive great
health. Also it helps those that are troubled with the Meagrum, or pains in
the Head coming of cold or wind, if ye wash the Head with the said Liquor,
presently they shall feel ease, with diverse other virtues, the which I will
leave until another time.

CHAP. LX. A Decoction of the Vine, and wherefore it serves.
THis Decoction is a composition of our Invention, and may be made in the same
order as ye do with Lignum vitae, or Sarsaparilla, and has no less virtue
against contagious diseases, and has so great virtue in drying and resolving,
that it is to be wondered at, and may be used in all causes in stead of
Sarsaparilla, or Lignum vitae, or China, and this I have found out by great
travel and experience, and the order to make it is thus.

Take the Roots of the Vine, or the stalks, and cut them small, then take
thereof two pound, and infuse them in strong Vinegar until they be covered,
then put thereunto xii. pound of common water, and one pound of white Honey,
and boil them until the consumption of the third part, so that there remain
eight pound, then strain it, and put thereunto ^ ss. of Julep simple, then keep
it in a glass close shut to thy use, for it serves against many diseases or
infirmities, and for those that have lost their appetite, if they take thereof
four ounces morning and evening warm, and fast thereon four or five hours, in
short time they shall recover it again. It is also good for those that are
troubled with the Colic: It also ingendereth Milk in women's breasts; it
cease pains of the Matrix, and also the Cough, Catarr, and pains of the
Reins, and such like, the which I will not speak of at this time. Also of the
seed of the Grape I have made an oil by Expression, as they make oil of
Linseed and other seed, the which is of so much virtue, that it helps in
manner against all indispositions, and especially against Ulcers and Wounds by
his proper quality, for unto this oil ye can neither attribute heat, not
dryness, moistness nor cold, but only a temperate thing, the which thou
may know by his experience. If ye use to eat of this oil, it mittigateth
and heals all the indispositions of the body, for it is of so much
sustenance and virtue, that it preserves the body in temperature: And these
have I found out by experience.

CHAP. LXI. To make a composition of the Herb Mercury.
THis Herb Mercury is of so much virtue that the tongue cannot express it,
and many Philosophers have assigned unto it Celestial virtue, because it
preserves a man in a youthful state a long time, and from infirmities: It
makes the heart merry, the which it does by his secret and hidden virtues,
and the order to make the said composition is thus.

Take the Juice of this Herb in May when it is with flour, and strain it
through a filter until it be clear, then take of that juice i. pound, Julip
simple half a pound, fine rectified Aqua vitae without phlegm. vi. Pure Oil of
Vitriol,. ii. fine Musk two Carrets; Mix these together in a glass, and stop
it very well, and set it in the Sun forty days together, and look that ye
take it in every night: that time being expired, you may use it when ye will,
and the order to use it s thus. Ye shall take in the morning. i. with two or
three ounces of the broth of a Capon, or other flesh, and fast thereon four or
five hours at the least, and thus using it two months together, it will be
unpossible to have any infirmity a long time after, by the virtue of the said
composition. Among the rest I saw once a Gentleman that had the Palsy one and
twenty months, the which by using of this composition the space of ten
months was perfectly whole. Another Composition also I have made, the which is
of mavelous virtue, and is in this order.

Take the Herb Mercury when it is floured, and accompany it with Wine and
Honey, then distill it, and separate the Elements according to Art, and thou
shall have a most rare Medicine, wherewith thou may help many infirmities.
But first I would counsel you, ere you use this, to prepare the body with
taking once our Aromatico, the which cleanses both the stomach and body, and
thus doing thou shall reap fame.

CHAP. LXII. A Medicine of Lappaciole Minor, the which is mavelous in curing
any sort of Catarre.
THere are four kinds of these, according to the writing of Dioscorides, but
that which the Author does write of in this place, is that which Dioscorides
calls Xanthium, and in the Shops it is called Lappa Minor, and Lappa Inversa,
and in the Italian Lappaciole Minore, and in English it is called the
Ditch-Bur, and Louse-Bur. Take that herb with the root and all, what quantity
ye will, and distill thereof a water, the which keep unto thy use, and when
ye will use it against the Catarre, take of that water four ounces, with white
crude Honey half an ounce, mix them well together, and drink it in the morning
warm as soon as ye rise, and fast thereon four or five hours, and use a
reasonable diet in your meat and drink, and eat nothing that may offend the
Catarre, and so using this remedy for a month together, thou shall help any
sort of Catarre perfectly, by virtue of that herb. For this I have
experimented diverse and sundry times in poor and simple Catarres. But ^ if they
come of the Pox, or Hectic, in that case it may pleasure them much, but yet
not cure them. Ye shall note, that it would be necessary for the Patient to
take a dose of our Aromatico before he take the said Medicine, because our
Aromatico disposes the Catarre to solution, whereby it may be the sooner cured.

CHAP. LIII. Of Pollipodie, and his virtues.
THis herb is well known to most men, and has great virtue against old
greifs, and opilations, and all indispositions that come through distemperment
of humors, because it evacuateth the body, cleanses the head, and purges the
blood: and the order to make it is thus.

Take Pollipodie two ounces, Seen one ounce, Lignum Aloes half an ounce, mix
these well together in a stone mortar, then take white Wine as much as ye
will, and for every pound of Wine put thereto. i. of that mixture, and so let
it stand four and twenty hours, and then drink it, for it will purge without
any pain, those that have any indisposition of the stomach, weakness of the
legs, and faintness of the body, and such like. For ye shall understand, the
Pollipodie purges Phlegm, and the Seen purges Choler, as by the viscosity is
known: The Lignum Aloes preserves nature, so that by the ingredients ye may
know the virtue of this composition. Ye shall understand, that this root would
be gathered when the Sun is afar off; and that the cold time of the year
does begin to draw on, for then they are of most force.

CHAP. LXIV. Of the Olive, and his virtues.
TAke common Oil, the which is made of the Olive, two pound, Frankincense one
pound, Turpentine one pound, distill them together in a Retort two days long,
then separate the oil from the water, and keep each alone, then take forth the
Fesses out of the Retort, the which is a miracle of Nature, because it serves
against all Infirmities, where it is applied. It helps broaken bones
wonderfully, and these secrets I have found out by experience. There is also
drawn out of the wood a liquour by discention, the which is black of color,
and is of mavelous virtue against pains. A little of this Oil being mixed
with Oil of Sulphur, helps all putrified and corrosive Ulcers that are caused
of putrefaction of humors. The Lie made of the Ashes of Olives, preserves the
beard and hair in their natural color, if ye wash the head often therewith.
Of this Oil I have made a great discourse in my Surgery.

CHAP. LXV. Of Ciperous, and his virtues.
THis herb being put into new Wine, when it works in the Hogshead, gives it
a pleasant savor, and whosoever uses to drink of that Wine, it will defend
him from all interior passions that are caused of ventosity, and helps those
that are troubled with the Rupture, because it resolves the wind, and has a
restrictive virtue. It purges the blood marvellously, and causes digestion,
and of this I have seen the experience. Also I saw one, that in the months of
April, May, and June, took the roots of Ciperous and beat them to powder, and
made thereof a plaster, and laid it upon the Rupture, changing it every day
once: and also he eat of the said roots, and so in short time he was helped;
and that experiment I have seen diverse times. Also if ye take those nodes or
knots that are on the roots, and stamp them, and boil them with common Oil,
Frankincense, and yellow Wax, until it become black of color, it will cure
wounds marvellously, it mittigateth the pains in all old sores, it cures all
pains coming of humidity and wind: Moreover, if ye anoint the body with the
said Oil, and drink the Wine wherein has lien infused the said root, it will
preserve it marvellously. And among all other things that I saw of this
Ciperous; there was a Merchant called Nicolo Carbolo, the which was of the age
of thirty years, and was troubled with a kind of scab like a Leper, and had
carried it long, the which I caused to make this Oil, and he did not only
anoint him therewith, but also drunk thereof every morning. ss. with wine, so
that in short time he became so whole and sound, that it was to be wondered at.

CHAP. LXVI. Of Rue, and his virtues.
TAke Rue when it is seeded, but yet not dry, and stamp it in a Mortar, and for
every pound of Rue, put thereto. vi. of Turpentine, and as much of the yolks of
Eggs hard sod, and incorporate them well together; then put it in a glass
close stopped, and set it to putrify in warm dung five and twenty days, then
distill it by a Retort according unto art, until all the substance be come
forth, the which will be both Oil and water, the which ye shall separate. The
water serves against all pains of the belly that are caused of cold and
moistness; the dose is. ss. in some warm broth, and may be taken at any time.
Also giving it to any that has a ^ever coming with cold, it will help him in
short time: yea, some have been cured at once or twice taking the same.
Moreover, the Oil is most sovereign against cold greifs, as well inward as
outward, it preserves those greatly, that take every morning a dram with
sweet wine, and fast thereon four or five hours. Also for outward griefs it is
most excellent, if ye anoint them therewith cold, because it resolves and
dries all evil qualities of our bodies: besides these experiences, I have
made an Oil of the seed of Rue by expression, the which is of so much virtue,
that if ye anoint the head therewith, it causes a good memory unto those
that have lost it, or are weak by reason of humidity, or cold.

CHAP. LXVII. Of Wormwood, and his virtues.
THis herb Wormwood is of great virtue, if ye can use it well: for if any
lean persons or evil colored use the same, it will bring them to their
perfect health and color, and the order to make it is thus.

Take Wormwood and distill it in Balneo, then put thereunto Oil of Vitriol, as
much as will suffice to make it tart, and thereof use every morning one
spoonful fasting, and in short time it will restore thee to perfecter health
than ever thou wast before, and bring thy color again.

CHAP. LXVIII. Of Gratia Dei, and his virtues and operation in diverse
infirmities.
THis Gratia Dei is an herb well known unto most men, and is like unto
Germander, and bitter in taste, and it ought to be gathered in July and August,
and must be dried in the shadow, hanging so that it may touch nothing, and then
i. of this powder will provoke vomit, and ease Nature. It helps also
putrified Ulcers, if ye make a decoction thereof with Lie, and then wet clothes
therein, and lay them upon the sore; for as it causes to vomit and evacuateth
the stomach, so neither more nor less it causes the Ulcer to vomit, or purge,
and heals it with great speed: It helps much those that are Phrenzie, by
reason that it mundifieth the stomach and body from such putrefaction.

A most excellent composition of this Herb. Take thereof in fine powder,.i.
Cinnamon,.i. Cloves,. i. Wheat flower one pound, Zucche compost condit.. iii.
Oranges condited, one ounce, beat them altogether, and make thereof a past with
Honey, and form it like a loaf, and set it in an Oven to bake, but take heed it
do not burn, and when thou will use it, give thereof one ounce, and it will
purge gallantly, and is very delectable to be eaten. This Purgation is divine
in many infirmities, but above all other against Scrophule, the white Scall,
and Scabs, because it evacuateth only the superfluous humiditie, and dries,
and is appropriate for these infirmities: For ye shall note, that all Soluble
Medicines do not serve in one infirmity, because one is Choleric, the other
Sanguine, one Phlegmatic, and the other Melancholy, and for that cause it is
necessary to find the proper Medicine for the infirmity. The Rhabarb purges
Choler: The Eleborus Melancholy; the Ebulus or Wallwort Phlegm, and the Gratia
dei the bloody, so that every one has his property.

CHAP. LXIX. Of Wallwort and his Virtues and Operations.
VVAllwort is an Herb* well known, and grows in a fat ground, and has
leaves, flouers, and seed like Elder, and is of such virtue that it is to be
wondered at, for if it were brought unto us from far Countries, it would be
accounted above all other herbs, but being so familiar among us, we make no
account thereof. This Herb called Wallwort or Dainwort, by his property and
nature provokes vomit and dissolveth the body, if ye drink the juice
thereof, or eat the Herb green: The water distilled of this Root being drunk,
and applied outwardly with wet clothes unto the Gout, it takes away the pain.
If ye give the juice of this Herb with Sirrup of Acetose to drink, it will
help frantic Fevers. The powder of his leaves has great operation in all
sorts of putrified Ulcers, because it takes away the pain, mundifieth, and
incarnateth, with diverse other virtues, the which if I should write them they
would not be credited, and therefore I leave it to the Experimentor.

CHAP. LXX. Of Millefolie or Yarrow, and his great virtue.
THis Herb Millefolie, is well known unto most men; and of many is little
esteemed, because it grows so commonly amongst us. This Herb being green, is
a miraculous and divine remedy, to help any sorts of fresh and bleeding
wounds, if ye stamp a handful thereof, and lay it thereupon the lips being
close joined together, within the space of four and twentie-houres it shall be
perfectly whole. If ye drink three ounces of the juice of this Herb with new
Milk, morning and evening, it will help Gonorrea in short time. It is also an
excellent remedy for those that have their Liver and Lungs ulcerated, for this
I have proved diverse and sundry times in Goats, the which are troubled with a
certain infirmity, the which is called Bissole of the Goat-keepers, for they
are certain Imposthumes that do engender in the Liver and the Lungs, and
causes them to die. I then seeing that in the interior parts of the Goats,
made this experience, I took Millefolie made in powder, and gave it unto the
Goats with Salt, and for the most part they were helped; and after that I cured
a number of men and women of that disease, for of that infirmity there die a
great number in the world. And with the said order aforesaid, thou may save
a number, but it must be mixed with Sal artificiato Leonardo. Those that are
Ettici and Tesici die commonly through Imposthumes and Ulcers that are caused
in the Liver, for of this I have seen above an hundred. For after they were
dead, I have caused them to be opened to see the experience. You shall
understand, that this Herb Millefolie has a great property to heal those
Ulcers. And therefore the Chirurgian that understands not Physic, can ill
help those Ulcers inwardly, because he cannot apply his Unguents and Plasters,
as he does outwardly. And those kind of Ulcers cannot be known, but of those
which have seen them, and have seen the success of their diseases, and
therefore I may well discourse thereof, because of them have passed a great
number through my hands, and I have seen them with mine eyes. So that I
conclude, that all which I have said is two things, the one is, to see the
thing in fact, the other, to have approved Medicines to help them. A most
excellent composition of this Herb, the which helps wounds in very short
time.

Take this Herb when it is floured, and ready to seed, and put thereunto
Bdellium, Frankincense, and common oil, and make thereof as it were Mustard,
then distill it with a gentle fire, with great diligence, as ye distill our
Oleum Benedictum, and thou shall have a rare Secret against all manner of
wounds, so that it causes the world to wonder at his operation.

CHAP. LXXI. Of Gentian and his Experiments, approved by me many times.
THis Herb is well known, and his virtue is most in the Root, and is a
miraculous and divine remedy for those that have pains within the body caused
of wind, and also for those that have the Stitch in the side, if ye give the
powder thereof in sweet white wine, for presently it takes away the pain,
because his nature is to dissolve wind, the which is caused of oppilations of
the Pores through abundance of humiditie, and the Gentian has virtue to dry
and dissolve wind, and so Nature does evaporate the ventositie: And this is the
reason why the Gentian does that effect.

CHAP. LXXII. Of Imperatoria and his great experience that it does against
pains of the Mother.
THis Herb is of great virtue in his operation, if his Root be made in powder,
and given to eat with Honey unto a woman that is troubled with the Mother,
either through cold or heat. For if they be grieved through cold, the
Imperatoria which is hot, does dissolve it, and they shall be delivered. If it
be through heat, the heat is always windy, because the heat is none other
thing, then a humor retained in those parts, the which this herb by his
proper virtue and quality does resolve. So that whether it be cold or hot,
this virtuous herb helps them with great speed, for this I have proved an
infinite number of times. Moreover this herb has great virtue to comfort the
stomach, and causes digestion, and to preserve all the body, and for that
cause the Ancients have called it Imperatoria.

CHAP. LXXIII. Of Cardo Sancto and his virtues particular, the which I have
proved.
THere are many kind of herbs, the which are called Cardi, but unto that which
they call Cardo Sancto; they have added Sancto, because the people should know,
that it is an herb of great value in certain diseases, so that it is to be
wondered at for his operation. And that which I have seen, thereof will I write
in this place, that is, if ye stamp this herb when it is green, and lay it
upon the wound, it will heal it miraculously, and with great speed. Also the
juice or powder of the said herb being given to drink unto those that have
worms, presently it helps them. This Herb being dried and infused in Aqua
vitae, and given to drink to any that is grieved with any grievous pains, in
short time he shall be whole. This Herb is also good for the sight of the
eyes: If ye make a past thereof with Bread and Honey, and distill it with white
wine, it is most excellent. It has also two great Virtues to preserve humane
bodies, the which I have proved, the one is outwardly, and the other inwardly,
and they are made in this order.

Take Carduus Benedictus when it begins to flour, and stamp it grossly, and
infuse it in common oil and Aqua vitae, with a little Frankincense, and there
let them remain, until they be macerated, then boil them and strain it, then
take thereof a third part, and put thereto a little Virgin wax, and let it
boil, until it begin to fume, and turn to a black color, then strain it, and
keep it in a glass close shut, that it take no air, then if ye take one
dram of the oil with sweet wine cold, it will resolve any infirmity, and
preserve them that use it in health; with the black liquor ye shall anoint
all the body when ye go to bed, cold, the which does not only resolve the
evil quality, but preserves a man in good state. It maintains the hair
black, so that it shall not wax white: It kills worms in the body, with
diverse other things, that I will leave until another time.

CHAP. LXXIV. Of sweet Marjoram, and of his Secrets the which I have proved.
MArjoram has great and rare virtues, the which I have proved, because others
might know them and use them, when occasion shall serve. And first I will write
of the juice, the which is of such strength and virtue, that one ounce thereof
being mixed with one dram of Oil of bitter Almonds, and one scruple of Mastick
in powder, being snuffed up at the nose, until it come unto the mouth, it
purges the head of all pains, dissolveth tumors, quickneth the sight, and
causes sleep, and helps the head of all infirmities: Also Marjoram put into
Vinegar, with Cloves and Cinnamon, and make thereof an Epithema, it dissolveth
the evil disposition of the stomach, and quickens the appetite, and
provokes sleep, and being eaten in Sallets, it comfort the Stomach
marvellously, with diverse other virtues, the which I have not seen.

CHAP. LXXV. Of the Herb called Laciola, or Ophio Glossen, of some Adders
tongue, or Lancea Christi.
THis Herb is of mavelous virtue, for if it be laid upon a wound, either
green or dry, it heals it marvellously, and with speed, and that it does by
his hidden and secret virtue. The decoction of this Herb heals wounds
inwardly, and also other offenses, it helps the Rupture in young children,
being new done, if ye lay it thereon, and bind it hard with a Trusse, these
Virtues I have seen of this Herb.

CHAP. LXXVI. Of Hypericon or Saint John's Wort.
THere is an Oil made of the Seed of this Herb by expression, the which being
anointed upon a wound, it does heal it with great speed. It is also excellent
for those which have the Pitechie that is, a certain disease so called in the
Italian tongue, it is also most excellent against all Poisons. This Herb is
also good against scabbs, if ye anoint them with the juice, and drink his
decoction, because it quenches and cools the superfluous heat. And this it
does by his proper quality, and hidden virtue.

CHAP. LXXVII. Of Nettles, and his virtue in many operations.
THis herb is commonly known among us, and is of mavelous virtue, and his
effects are uncredible. Nevertheless, I will not let to show one experiment of
it, the which is mavelous, and is this: Take a Capon, and pull away all his
feathers from his breast, and beat him with Nettles, and he will call in the
young Chickens, and govern them like the Hen. Nettles being dried and made into
powder, and given to eat unto a man, it will provoke venereous acts, being used
to be eaten in meats, it purges the Matrix, it helps scabs, if you wash them
with his decoction, and mittigateth all pains coming of cold, making a bath
thereof; his decoction helps the toothache, with many other virtues that I
have not proved. But truly I believe, that if any would give himself to seek
experience in this herb, he should see strange things. For I have always seen
that in these kind of herbs, that naturally will not be touched, God and
Nature has given great virtue.

CHAP. LXXVIII. Of Hysop of the Mountain.
THis herb has great virtue, for if his decoction be given to drink unto
those that have the flux of Urine, in short time it will help them: The like
does his decoction in wounds imposthumated, for if ye wash them therewith, it
will mundifie, and restrain, and bring it presently to be whole. Also if ye
make powder thereof, and lay it upon a fresh wound, it will help it presently,
and that it does by his great estranged virtue. It helps the Cough, being
infufed in Wine and drunk.

CHAP. LXXIX. A great secret of a kind of Betonie.
THere is found in the field a certain kind of Betonie, the which is the length
of an arm or more, and as big in the stalk as a Goose quill, and it is four
square, and the leaf is much like unto the Oaken leaf, and his flour is much
like the color of a Violet, and his seed is black, and much lik unto the
grains of Gunpowder, and this herb in Lumbardie is called Betonica, and in the
Realm of Naples it is called Centra galla, and of this herb I have seen great
virtues and experience, and especially when it begins to flour until it be
seeded: for if ye distill it with sweet Wine, and receive thereof only the
fourth part, it will restore the sight unto those that are almost blind: It
comfort a weak stomach very much, if ye drink thereof every morning three
or four drachms. The Fesses which remain in the glass being mixed with Honey
and a little Zedoaria, helps women that are troubled with the Mother, if they
drink thereof every morning. viii. warm. This herb being bruiesd with Wine and
Salt, and laid upon a fresh wound every three days once, helps the same with
speed: Also if ye put one of his seeds into the eyes, and there let it remain
so long as ye may suffer it, it will clear the sight marvellously, for it has
been proved many times. It helps those kind of Scabs the which are most evil
to be helped, being mixed in this order.

Take the juice of this herb, although it be somewhat dry and hard to get
forth, and for every ounce of that juice, put thereunto. iiii. of the Oil of
Frankincense that comes forth last in the distillation, and boil them a little
together until it begin to fume, then take it from the fire and strain it
through a cloth, and when ye go to bed anoint all the scabs therewith cold,
and thou shall see a most strange cure, never written of before by any man, the
which I have proved diverse and sundry times, and is a secret to be used on
noble personages, because it does his effect without letting of blood, and
purging, most wonderful to behold: So that it is to be accounted rather a
divine Medicine then humane; for truly I have done more cures with this herb
then with any other that ever I used.

CHAP. LXXX. Of the effects of Wine, and what comes thereof.
FIrst I will speak of Wine and his qualities. You shall understand, that Wine
is a liquour the which changes into diverse kinds differing from his own
nature: And first it changes into Vinegar of it self without any artifice, the
which can never be turned into Wine again. Also they separate from Wine Aqua
vitae, the which being separated cannot be turned into Wine again. Also Wine
makes, by settling it self, a certain stone called Tartar, the which can never
be turned into Wine again, nor yet into Vinegar. And thus when the workman does
transmute or change it, it cannot be turned again into his first quality. Wine
is very apt to corrupt, and to change into other kinds, but after that it
changes or transmuteth, it is uncorruptible: for when it is turned into
Vinegar, it is apt to conserve all things. Vegetable and Animal that is put
therein, but not the Minerals, for by nature it is enemy unto them. There is
also separated from Wine Aqua vitae, the which is conservatrix of all
Medicines; for when it is circulated and made into a Quintessence it becomes
celestial, as I have showed in my other books, and therewith thou may help
many infirmities, because it mittigateth all pains, and dissolveth in a manner
all infirmities, and especially when it is compounded in this manner.

Take of that Quintessence four parts, Oil of Sulphur and Vitrioll of each one
part, Julep of Violets sixty parts: Mix them all together, and it will be of
such virtue, that if ye give. i. thereof to drink to one that lay at the point
of death, it would recover him, because it breaks choler, preserves the
stomach, causes an appetite, and helps any sort of Fever, and preserves
both men and women in lusty state, if they use it oftentimes; for these
experiences I have seen diverse times. Also of the Tartar ye may may make Oil,
the which is of mavelous virtue, both in Physic, Chirurgerie, and Alchimie.
There is also drawn forth of Tartar, his spirit and oil in this order, as
Andernacus writes, the which is most profitable against sundry infirmities,
and the order to make it is thus.

Take white Tartar and beat it to powder four pound, and put it into a stone
pot or glass well luted, and set it in a furnace to distill with a great
Receiver close luted, least all the fumes come forth or break the glass, then
give it first a small fire, and so increase it as though thou would draw a
strong water, and so continue it until there come forth no more spirits, then
let it wax cold, and take forth the liquor, and put it into an upright glass
with his head and receiver, and distill away the water in Balneo, then take
that oil which is in the bottom, and distill it in Sand or Ashes, and there
will come forth at the first a yellowish oil, and so by little and little it
will change color, and become blacker and blacker, and thick like unto a
Balm, or a Sirrup. You shall understand, that the first Liquor separated in
Balneo, is called Liquor fecularum vini, or Spiritus Tartari, the oil which
ye rectified in Sand, is called Oleum fecularum vini, sive Mumia fecularum
vini the which is most effectual and profitable in curing all running Ulcers
that goes creeping upon the flesh, and especially those that come Ex lue
venerea, for this Mumia does so cure those malign Ulcers, that their malice can
hurt no more, but shall be quite extincted: Being drunk with wine, it does
break and expel the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, it provokes Urine and
purges Ulcers. Furthermore,. i. of the liquor or spirit of Tartar, being
drunk with water of Fumitorie or Hirundinariae or such like, as is most
convenient for Pustulas gallicas ex anthemate ericipelas, the Dropsy, Water
betwixt the skin and the flesh, Fevers, Menstrua, and all obstructions of those
parts; it will work all those effects more effectual if it be taken with water
of Triacle, the which is made as hereafter follows. Also ye shall understand
that this spirit of Tartar must be rectified four or five times from the calces
of his Fesses in Balneo, to take away his stinking smell, and then it will be
the purer and more effectual, and this is the making of Aqua Theriacalis.

Take Triacle of Alexander that is perfect good*. v. red Myrrh,. ii. Saffron,.
ss. mix them together in a glass, and pour thereon,. x. of the spirit of Wine,
and then set them close stopped to digest, then distill it according unto art;
sometime they put into this water. ii. of Camphire especially when it is used
in hot burning Fevers and Infla^mations, and and then it is called Aqua
theriacalis camforata, this Composition following being drunk, has a singular
piercing virtue. Take Spiritus calcanthi,. i. Liquoris fecularum vini
correcti,. iii. Aqua Theriacalis. v. give thereof. i. in strong wine or other
convenient liquor both for the aforesaid defects, and also to prevent and cure
infinite other diseases.

CHAP. LXXXI. Of the quality of Vinegar, and his Secrets.
VInegar is made of wine, and of water. Whereas there is wine, they make it of
wine, but in those Countries where there grows no wine, they make it of beer
and ale, in stead of wine, the which Vinegar is very strong. Nevertheless, it
has not the virtue and quality of that which is made of wine, because his
nature is to preserve those things which are put therein, as is said before. If
ye do distill Vinegar in Balneo until it remain dry, and then burn those
Fesses until they come white, and then lay them in a moist place, it will turn
into Oil, the which is of such virtue for man's body, that it is not to be
credited, for if ye give thereof a small quantity to drink, it will dissolve
the Gravel, and Stone in the Bladder. And therefore this is a worthy secret to
be known, the which was never revealed before to any man: As for his other
virtues, they are known to all men. Distilled Vinegar being mixed with a little
oil of Tartar and Aqua vitae, preserves the face, and makes it fair, but if
it were not a sin to offend God, I could say such great and strange things of
distilled Vinegar, that it would cause the world to wonder at it, but for
troubling my conscience, I will hold my peace for this time, and leave this to
be sufficient, which I have written already.

CHAP. LXXXII. Of the Fesses of Wine, and of his Secrets that I have found out.
THat which is called Alum du Fesse, is the Fesses of Wine burnt, the which I
have spoken of in other places, but here I will show thee a great and rare
Secret, never written before by any man, the which shall be to the honor of
the Physician, and this is the Secret.

Take the Fesses of Aqua fortis, made with Roch Allom, Sal Niter, and Vitriol
two pound, Alum du Fesse two pound, mix them well together, and put them into
a Furnace to calcine, until it become to a hard stone: and when it is
calcined, make it presently into powder, and set it four or five nights in the
air, and it will turn moist, then take six pound of pure Aqua vitae without
phlegm, and put therein the same powder, and so let it remain eight days, every
day stirring it once, then pour of that part which is clear, and keep it as a
precious Jewel, then take the Fesses and calcine them again, as ye did at the
first, and make them in powder again: And this powder mundifieth all filthy
and stinking sores, and with this water thou may help them, if that the
workman can apply it with reason. Also with this water may be done great cures
in Physic, if it be given as it ought to be. Also of the said powder there may
be made Pills and Potions, that works miracles in the world, as I have seen
diverse times.

CHAP. LXXXIII. Of Verjuyce made of Grapes, and his Secrets.
VErjuyce is the Juice of unripe Grapes, the which is kept to dress and season
meats, to give them a better taste, and it is of great virtue, and appropriate
for many things. But when it shall be distilled with Honey, and Alum du Fesse
in a Limbeck of glass, it will be a miraculous remedy for Imposthumes that
are very hot. It makes women fair and shining, if they wash them therewith.
But if this be mixed with oil of Talk, it will restore the sight unto those
that are almost blind. Also two drachms of distilled Verjuyce, with two drachms
of the juice of Betonie, and four ounces of Milk being used, will make a man
very luxurious, and help a weak back. Also Verjuyce being distilled, will bring
an appetite unto those that have lost it. And all these are with great reason,
for ye shall understand that the Verjuyce without any other Artifice, does
mundifie the stomach, and loose the body, and purify the blood: The Honey is
Cordial, and is hot by nature, and dissolveth wind, the Alum du Fesse dries,
and destroys all the evil humors: The Talk is bright and shining, and his
whiteness does penetrate very much: The Betonie comfort the stomach, and is
windy: The Milk is aperative and nutritive, and therefore consider well
thereon, and thou shall find it reason and experience that I have said.

CHAP. LXXXIV. Certain Secrets of Animals, and first of the Ox.
THe fat of the Ox is very appropriate to Unguents, to help all manner of
sores, because it comfort the place offended, and mittigateth the pain; but
when this grease or fat shall be distilled with Turpentine and Wax, it will
work Miracles in diverse operations, of the which I will not speak in this
place. There is in the throat of diverse old Oxen certain knots or kernels as a
man may term them, the which are of the bigness of an Olive, some are bigger
and some lesser, according to the age of the Ox. Take of those kernells, and
hang them up to dry in the shadow, and make thereof powder, and of that powder
give every morning, ss.. unto those that have the Dropsy, and in short time
they shall be helped. Also the sinnews of an Ox being dried, and made lint to
make tents or stoppings, is most excellent, and will work great effects, and
this is one of the Secrets, the which I never meant to reveal until death. The
blood of a young Bull that is not gelded, being drunken as it is warm, is most
strong poison, there are also diverse other things, the which I would write of
this Beast but for tediousness sake.

CHAP. LXXXV. Of the Goat.
THe fat of the Male Goat before he is gelded is of much virtue, because it
comfort all members that are offended, as well inwardly as outwardly: If ye
anoint any that has the Flux with the said grease, it will do him great
pleasure. Also the dung of the Goat is most excellent to mollify sinnews that
are indurated in any place, and therefore this dung being put into Unguents
appropriate, of force must work great Effects.

CHAP. LXXXVI. Of the Horse and his Virtues.
THe Dung of the Horse is of great virtue, for if a man were lame, and
indurated through gross and viscous humors, let him be buried in fresh warm
Horse dung two hours, and in ten or twelve days he shall be helped. The fat of
the Horse is very hot and penetrative, and especially that in the neck, where
the Main grows. Also the fat being distilled with the rosin of the Pine tree
and Myrrh, is miraculous against shrunk sinnews.

CHAP. LXXXVII. Of the Dog and his Secrets.
THe Dog is an amiable Animal above all other unto man, for he understands
in a manner what a man does say; and from the Dog is taken many wholesome things
for man, for of the skin they make Gloves, and such like, the which are
wholesome for them that wear them. The fat of the Dog is very hot and piercing,
and dissolveth all pains that come of cold. The dung of a Dog is profitable to
dress Leather withal, also his blood mixed with Hogs grease, and the Ashes of
a Vine, dissolveth all manner of swellings, that come in diverse parts of the
body.

CHAP. LXXXVIII. Of the Cat and his Virtues.
THe Cat is very hot, above all other animals, that appertain unto the house,
and his fat is of such heat, that it is uncredible to be spoken of, and he is
never in love, or goes a catterwalling, but in the coldest weather. The Brain
of the Cat is of such a heat, that if any do eat thereof, it will make him
mad; if ye anoint certain places of the house with the fat, it will cause the
Mice to run away, fearing least the Cat were there, and that is by a hidden
property. There ingendereth in the flesh of a dead Cat certain putrified
Worms, the which afterward become a kind of Fly, that are called Taphaeni,
the which is a very great enemy to the Ox, and all other Cattle, for they
will run away from them, for if they be bitten therewith, they will in a manner
be mad.

CHAP. LXXXIX. Of the Hare and his Secrets.
THe blood of the Hare being dried in the Furnace, and made into powder,
helps those much, which are troubled with the stone and gravel, giving it to
drink with the juice of Pelitory. The hair of the Hare serves to stench blood
in wounds. The Testicles of the Hare dried in a Furnace, and made into powder,
and being drunk, provokes venereous acts. The Gaul of the Hare being distilled
with Honey and Aqua vitae, is a miraculous remedy for the sight of the eyes,
putting therein every night one drop when ye go to bed. There is yet a great
virtue in the Hare, that if I should reveal it, the world would wonder at it,
and therefore I omit it unto the ingenious.

CHAP. XC. Of the Frog and his secrets.
THese Frogs are of great virtue in diverse operations; for their fat helps
the Leprosy if ye anoint them therewith, and is a most miraculous thing for
those that are burnt, or scalded with water; for if ye anoint them therewith,
it will help them quickly, and leave no scar. But if this fat be distilled with
Mirrh, and Aqua vitae, and accompanied with Aloes, and the juice of Brassica
Marina, called Soldanella, and thereof made Pills, they will be of so much
virtue, that one scruple or two of those Pills being given oftentimes unto one
that has the Dropsy, they shall be helped quickly, and hereof I have had
great experience, to my great honor and profit of the Patient.

CHAP. XCI. A discourse upon certain stones, and their qualities in Physic and
Surgery: and first of the Marble stone.
THere are a great number of stones that the Majesty of God has created in the
world, of the which I will make mention of some, as well Mineral as
Artificial, because the Physician as well as the Chirurgian, may be served
thereof in their affairs, although it be hard to have knowledge of those things,
because they are much differing one from another, and grow in diverse parts of
the world: yea, and although they be brought unto us, yet they are so unknown,
that we cannot know the thousand part of their virtues and qualities. And to
begin, I will write of the Marble, the which is a white stone, like unto Sugar
when it is broken, and it is of great virtue in Surgery, for when it is
brought into calkes, thereof may be made an Unguent of great virtue in this
order. Take of that calkes, and lay it to steep in fair water, so that it may
be covered four fingers, then stir it eight or ten times a day, and then let it
wax clear and settle, then pour it off, and put on more, and do as ye did
before, and when the water is settled clear pour it off again, then take of
that calkes what quantity you will, and with Oil of Roses make it into an
Unguent, the which is mavelous for such as are troubled with heat, for it
dries, and cools, and sets it in good disposition, so that with ease it
may be healed.

CHAP. XCII. A Discourse upon Lapis Ematites, and his virtues in Surgery.
THis Lapis Ematites is a stone like unto the Mine of Iron, the which if it be
ground into powder will be red like unto Sinaper, and thereof thou shall make
an Unguent in this manner. Take Oil of Roses four ounces, Auxungia two ounces,
new Wax half an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, Lapis Ematites in most fine powder
three ounces, mix them well together in a Copper pan with a small fire, until
it begin to give certain fumes, or smell, and it will be black, then take it
from the fire, and always stir it until it be cold; and then it will be hard
like a Cerot, the which is miraculous in healing corrosive Ulcers. Also this
stone being in fine powder, and made into a Lineament with Vinegar, Oil of
Roses, and a little Litarge, helps Scabs, and quenches their heat, and
cools the blood. Also two drachms of this powder being eaten with Sugar
rosate, helps those which have inflammations in their stomach with speed.
This stone has also diverse other virtues, the which I will leave at this time.

CHAP. XCIII. Of the stone of Iron, which some call Loppa.
THese stones which the workmen take from the Forge, that are called Loppa
diferro, are of great importance, if we may believe the Alchimists, because
they say, that this stone is the beginning of their Stone, etc. Ye shall
understand, that this stone is most necessary both in Physic and Surgery,
when it shall be well prepared as it ought to be: and his preparation is in
this order. Take that mass of matter and stamp it, and searce it very fine,
and then put it into a vessel that is apt to resist the fire, and set it in a
glass Furnace for twenty or thirty days, and then it will be a red mass, the
which ye shall beat into an impalpable powder, the which if thou will use in
Physic thou may dissolve in Vinegar, and when it is dissolved keep it for
inflammations of the Liver and Stomach, the which thou may give with any
kind of Sirrup appropriate, for this is a miraculous Medicine against the flux
of the body. Also if ye make an Unguent of the said powder with Oil of Wax, of
Frankincense, and Eggs, it will work strange operations in Contusions and
Dislocations of bones, laying it thereon very warm, because it resolves all
alteration, mittigateth the pain, and comfort the place offended. Ye shall
understand, that it was never made of none but of us, which ever seek new
Medicines and goodly experiences, to pleasure the world with that Art.

CHAP. XCIV. Of Lapis Judaicus and his form, and wherefore it serves in
Physic and Surgery.
THis Lapis Judaicus is a certain stone, the which is like unto the similitude
of the Cuckows Egg, and is of a grayish color and rough, and within it is
another stone like unto a Nut, and this stone is of a great virtue in his
operation; for if it be beaten into powder, and dissolved in distilled Vinegar,
and then mixed with Sirrup of Saxifrage, and given to drink to those that are
troubled with gravel, it will cause them to avoid it in their Urine: and to
break the stone, they shall mix the powder with Honey, and lay it on
plaister-wise upon the Reins, and it will break the gravel with speed.
Moreover, this Stone has two rare virtues, the which I will not write of in
this place, but I would counsel those that carry them upon their bodies to
have two, a Male and a Female, and look upon them every day once, for of this
stone I have seen great experience.

CHAP. XCV. Of Lapis Lazuli and his operation.
CErtain wise men in the world that have made great consideration of this
stone, say, that this is the stone of gold, because it is mixed with Azure,
white and yellow, and also other colors; but I find that in many places of the
world, they have the Mine of gold, and yet they find no Lapis Lazuli; and
therefore it is a sign that it grows in places where Nature does produce it
in that form. And for that which I have seen of Lapis Lazuli is, that if ye
give it inwardly it provokes vomit, and helps the Quartain Ague: And I have
proved to calcine it in the Furnace where they bake Bricks, and when it was
calcined to dissolve it in Aqua vitae: the solution helps many infirmities,
giving it inwardly, and especially malign Fevers. Also being put in malign
sores, it brings them to so good a temperature, that it is miraculous, and
not credited, except of those that see the experience. And at this time I am
seeking to bring it to a certain perfection, the which shall work miracles, and
hitherto I have had good success, for thereof I have seen great miracles that
causes the world to wonder: And yet of late I have found an Oil made of the
same Stone, that provokes sleep, and causes quiet rest, and is mavelous for
the sight of the eyes, anointing the head, the eyes, and the stomach therewith
when ye go to bed: For of this I have seen an infinite of experiments, and I
swear by that I am, that with all the travel that I have had, I never found a
better thing then this Oil; for if ye anoint the Gout therewith, presently it
takes away the pain, and inflammation, or alteration, but the reason thereof I
know not, because as yet I had no leisure to consider thereof: But by the grace
of God, at the next impression I will set forth some notes of their experience
that I have seen in the Art.

CHAP. XCVI. Of the Flint-stones and their virtues.
THe flint is a stone, the which if it be stricken with Iron or Steel it will
give fire, and his virtues are great both in Physic and Surgery, and also
in diverse other Arts. First in Physic it has virtue to dissolve the gravel
in the Reins and Bladder, if ye give thereof two drachms with unriped Wine, and
this it does by his proper quality and hidden virtue. In Surgery it has
great virtue, for being ground into most fine powder, and made into an ointment
with Oil of Roses, and Wax, it mittigateth all inflammations, and takes away
the pain of the sore, because it cools and dries Moreover, this stone is
used of those that make Glass, to make their composition with their Ashes and
Maganese. There are yet a great number of virtues, the which I leave unto the
Experimentour.

CHAP. XCVII. Of the white stone which some call Alum, Scaleola, or Gesso.
THis Alum, Scaleola, or Gesso is used much in Italy to make Lime of, I
suppose it to be that which is called Muskovie Glass, or Lapis Specularis;
this is very necessary both in Physic and Chirurgerie, because it is by virtue
attractive and drying, and helps much against burning Fevers, tempering it
when it is burnt like flower with Vinegar, and when it is tempered, lay it
presently upon the Reins, and lay it just the length and largeness, and so let
it remain three or four hours, because it draws like Boxing Glasses, and so
leaves the Reins cold and eased: and so by that effect it does great pleasure
in those kind of Fevers. It helps also in Ulcers if ye make a paste thereof
with common lie, and lay it thereon eight or ten hours, and then change it,
for of this I have seen strange effects.

CHAP. XCVIII. Of the Stone called Lapis Amiante.
THis Stone called Amiante, as all they which have written thereof say, is a
stone like unto Cycile, or Alum du plum, but not so white, of the which stone
there is found great quantity in Cyprus, and there they spin it like as it
were Flax, and do make thereof Napkins and such like, and when they are foul,
in stead of washing them, they make a great fire, and lay them thereon, and so
make them clean and white, for the experience thereof I have seen, and that
which I have said, is in the Lapidarie of Dioscorides and Pliny, and Petro
Andrea, Mathiolus Sanesie. And hereof I will show thee a mavelous strange
secret, the which I have proved, and is this. Take of the said stone and make
it in powder, and mix it with crude Lead being in powder, as I have showed in
my Caprici Medicinale, with Tutia prepared, the composition thereof is this.
Take of the stone. iiii. Lead,. xii. Tutia. ii. Mix them and calcine them in
the fire, and when they are calcined, beat them to powder, and lay them to
steep in strong Vinegar in a glass, and so let it stand a month stirring it
every day once, and then at the months end let it boil on the fire a quarter
of an hour, and then let it settle until it come clear, then take of that
Vinegar as much as ye will, and mix it with as much oil of Roses, stirring it
until it come to a body, the which is a precious linament and rare, for if ye
anoint the white scall or such like scabs on the heads of young children, it
will heal them with great speed. Also for Scabs and Itch in the legs it is
excellent, if ye anoint them therewith every night when you go to bed. This
Stone serves also when it is dissolved by it self in Aqua vitae and Sugar, for
those women that are troubled with the whites; for if they drink thereof every
morning a little, it helps them quickly. I believe this Stone has many other
virtues which I know not.

CHAP. XCIX. Of the Sapphire, and his virtues in Physic.
SAphires are certain stones, like unto Azures, small, and are transparent, the
which if thou will use, it were necessary to be cunning in the knowledge of
them, for otherwise ye may be deceived. And furthermore, above that which many
Philosophers have written thereof, I have found two goodly experiences never
known before, and are these. First to make the heart merry, and to help the
passions of the same, the which ye shall use thus.

Take thy Sapphire, and stamp it very finely, and dissolve it in Vinegar, or
with the juice of Limons, and when they are dissolved, take thereof i. with as
much of our Elixar vitae, and of Oil of Honey i. and a little of the Julep of
Violets, and give it to drink unto those that have the aforesaid infirmities,
and thou shall see miracles of their operation. I hope ere it be long, to set
forth a great and strange secret of these Stones.

CHAP. C. Of Red Coral.
REd Coral is a stone, the which most commonly does grow upon baked stones or
bricks, and to approve it to be so, there is a certain Island of Barbary, the
which is called Tobacco, the which was sometimes inhabited, but sithence the
Sea has overrun a great part thereof, and so the stones of the houses, and
the Bricks were scattered in the bottom of that Sea, and at this time the
Genoes gathered a great quantity of Red Coral, the fairest in all the world.
I call to remembrance that in the year 1549. I being in Messina, a famous City
in the Realm of Cicilia, I saw a Fisherman cast his Net in the gate hard by the
tower called Salvatore; and he took up a branch of red Coral that was grown
upon a Brick, and was of such greatness and beauty, as had not been seen in
two hundred years before. So that by this I have proved, that the Coral does
grow upon Bricks, or baked stones, and these have great virtue in Physic and
Chirurgerie, when they be dissolved in the juice of Limons, or distilled
Vinegar. For howsoever it be taken inwardly, it comfort the stomach, and
makes the heart merry, dissolveth the Fever, and not without great cause. For
it is so good of nature, that our nature does desire it. Coral being calcined
and dissolved with Aqua vitae, or with our Quintessence of Wine, helps very
much against Ulcers, because it takes away the pain presently, and mundifieth,
and incarnateth, and cicatrizeth. Of this Coral ye may make Lozenges, or such
like, the which are very Restorative.

CHAP. CI. A Discourse upon the Stone Salt.
THere is found a Salt in the Realm of Naples, in the Province of Calabria, in
the state of the Prince of Besignano, in certain Mountains that are of the Mine
of Salt: I do verily believe that this Salt is a fifth Element, because Salt
would be called no other then wisdom, as a man may say, taste. And to prove
that which I have said, ye may see that the world cannot live without it.
Moreover this Salt serves much in Physic and Surgery, for they put it into
Clisters, and lay it also upon wounds. But I have found a way to prepare this
Salt sweet like Sugar, but yet Salt, and is of such a pleasant taste, that it
comfort them that use it, and this is called Sal conditum Leonardo, the
which Salt is good against Worms, and comfort the stomach, causes an
appetite, purges the Urine, with a number of other virtues. And the order to
take it is thus. Ye shall take thereof half a spoonful in the morning at one
time, and also use it in stead of Salt to your meat, and season your meat
therewith. Also if any have pains in any part of their body, anoint it with
this Salt, and bind a cloth thereon, and it will be helped.

Hereafter follows the Virtues of certain Mineralls, and mean Mineralls. And
first of Vitrioll.

CHAP. CII. Certain Secrets of Vitriol.
IN Vitriol are many Secrets which until this time have been hidden, by means
of which there may be done many strange and great matters in diverse operations,
not only in Physic and Surgery, but in many other things. Ye shall
therefore take Vitriol and put it in a pot; and make him sweat until ye see
him weep; the which sweat being taken from him, is a mortal enemy unto sharp
Fevers, when it is drunk with sodden or distilled waters. Also if those that
have the Etica or Tissick do drink it with Mel Rosarum, it will do them
great pleasure, it serves also to make the hair of the head or beard black.
Then if that by force of fire ye cause him to vomit a black liquor, it will be
a thing very apt to dissolve any humor, the which in short time will dissolve
any pain. For if ye put it into Gangrena, or other putrified Ulcer, it does
mundifie it with great speed: It mortifieth Warts Chaps, Fistulaes, and any
kind of those humors. If it be drunken with Wine or other liquor, it is good
against Fevers of any quality. Then his Feces being reduced into water with
Vinegar, and his Salt being taken out, it is of such virtue, that in a manner
it will make men immortal. And above the aforesaid matters, in Alchymie it
works strange things, for by the means thereof they may make the great
Amalgam of Mercury and Mars, wherewith may be done great matters, and happy
shall he be that goes to work that way. For with Vitriol, Mercury and Mars is
made full glad the Master of the Art.

CHAP. CIII. Strange secrets of Roch Alum.
IN Alum are great virtues, and especially in Roch Alum; for the water being
separated from the Feces, and accompanied with our Quintessence, works most
strange cures, and especially in desperate diseases: And the Feces which cannot
dissolve, when with fire they shall be brought to perfection, and accompanied
with Mars, they shall be apt to heal any sort of Ulcer inwardly, and with speed
take away the pain, and not without great reason: for the Roch Alum is Anima
Terrae, a firm Element, and that which dissolveth and turns all things into
his nature. Mars also is Anima Terrae, and is that, in which is found all
virtue and richness: But he that is not expert, let him not settle himself to
this enterprise, least it fall not out right; for he that cannot prepare,
calcine, dissolve, and congeale, shall never do any thing that is ought worth,
therefore it were better to leave then meddle.

CHAP. CIV. Of Orpiment and his nature.
THis Orpiment is a stone, as it were, made of scales, and is of diverse
colors; there is white, and yellow, and red like blood; nevertheless, they
are all of Sulphurous matter, the which burns visibly like Sulphur, of the
which I know no use, neither in Physic nor Surgery, although that some
Chirurgians do lay it upon sores to dry them, the which they do for want of
reason or knowledge: With this Orpiment, being mixed with Calx viva, and strong
Lie, and so made into an Unguent, they use to take away hair: It serves also
for Painters to make a yellow color like Gold, the which if it be burned, it
changes into another color. This serves for infinite uses in Alchimie; for
his sublimation being made with Sul niter, and Tartar, when it is white, and
Amalgamed with Quicksilver and fine Silver, and given in projection upon Venus
purged, it will make it very fair and white, and much like Lime. Orpiment is
dissolved, by way of calcination with strong Vinegar, until such time as his
substance be taken away; then let it settle and wax clear, and vapor away that
clear part, and in the bottom ye shall find the whiteness of Sulphur, the
which being fixed with sufficient order, it does blanch all metals, and this is
called the Quintessence of Sulphur Mineral: This serves for many other uses
in Alchimie, the which I will leave until another time: But this which I have
written is most true.

CHAP. CV. Of Cinaber Mineral, and wherefore it serves.
THis Cinaber is of two kinds, Mineral and Artificial; the Mineral is a stone
of the color of Iron, the which being ground into powder it will be red like
blood, the which is of a great drying nature, by the reason that it contains
in it Sulphur, it dries malign Sores, and being made in a Perfume, it helps
the mouth being ulcerated, and being made into an Unguent, it cools greatly;
also being dissolved in Vinegar, it mittigateth the pain in malign Ulcers, and
heals them in short time; his sublimation being made with Salt and Tartar,
blancheth Copper and Lattin like to Silver.

This stone serves also to burnish Metal or Silver therewith. The artificial
Cinaber is made of Sulphur and Mercury by way of sublimation, the which serves
for diverse uses; as for the Painters, or to write with; also to make drying
Unguents, and for fumes against the Pox, with diverse other uses, the which I
leave at this time.

CHAP. CVI. Of the secrets of Salt, and his royal virtue.
THere is in Salt a great virtue, and his secrets are of great force, for if
Salt be dissolved in the mighty water of Vitriol, together with Mars, and then
caused to vomit with great heat, until it remain in a dry powder, and then
circulate it with our Quintessence of Wine and Honey the space of a month, the
which if the workman can do, he shall make a miraculous Medicine, which by his
virtue and hidden quality, will serve against diverse great infirmities, because
his nature is to preserve the body in his strength, and to discharge all evil
humors that may offend Nature. But to speak of some particular thing, I say,
that this glorious Medicine does help the Fever Hectic when they are new
begun, giving thereof a little quantity with water of Vervane, Agrimonie, and
Betonie; with the water of Fennel and Selandine, it restores the sight unto
those that are obscure; it helps also the flux of the body, with diverse other
things, the which I will not utter in this place.

CHAP. CVII. Of the secrets of common Salt, and his virtues.
THere are three sorts, or kinds, found of common Salt, the one is natural, the
which is found in Mountains, as in Naples in the Province of Calabria, where
are great Mountains of it, and also in Spain in the Isle of Anvisa, and this
is the Mineral Salt. The second kind is Artificial, as is made in Germany in
their Cauldrons. The third kind is also natural of the Sea, which is made upon
dry sands in pits, by force of the Sun; but the most sweet and savourest is
that which is made with fire, because it is purified and clean: The Salt of the
Mountain is of more virtue then all the rest in Physic; for when it shall be
calcined forty days together in a Furnace, and then dissolved with our
Quintessence of Honey, so that there remain no Feces, it will be of such
virtue, that in manner it will revive the dead, if you give them thereof a
spoonful. With this the antientest Doctors did mavelous things, and they
called it the Salt of Wisdom, for he that knew well his virtues would marvel
thereat. This Salt serves also against the infirmities of Oxen.

CHAP. CVIII. Certain secrets of Saltpeter.
Saltpeter is a certain kind of salt of Urine, the which is taken out of the
earth by art, and is most wholesome against diverse infirmities; for when it
shall be calcined thirty days together in a Furnace, with as much Tartar, and
then dissolved with our Quintessence, accompanied with the spirits of Cinnamon,
Ginger, and Cloves, it will be a most wholesome Medicine, and will cause the
Professors of the Art to be amazed at his operation, for it helps the
Hectic, and Dropsy, and diverse such like infirmities, the which I will not
speak of in this place, fearing that they will not be credited: Nevertheless,
those that are disposed to travel on that matter shall find their desire, and
reap great fame in the world.

CHAP. CIX. Certain secrets of Alum du Fece.
THis Alum is made with the Feces of Wine, in this manner. You shall
understand, that in those Countries where they make Wine, they put it in
vessels, and lay them toward the East, and then in certain space there
settleth great quantity of Feces, the which being put into certain bags, and
hanged up to dry, the humor runs out, and the Fesses remain in a hard
mass, the which afterward is dried and burned, and the ashes thereof is called
Alum du Fece, in the which are found great secrets; for without this certain
colors cannot be dyed: It makes also women's hair yellow, and takes away all
spots or stains, and the like virtue it has in our Physic, if that the
workman were able to prepare it as it should be, for it will transmute one
complexion into another.

CHAA. CX. A great secret of Gold.
GOld, which Alchimists do call Sol, is a metal of such importance, that it is
superior of all the rest in virtue, weight, and prise, and of brightness and
fairness, and is that, with the which may be made a Medicine, that in manner
gives life unto the dead, when it is prepared with the fire, and accompanied
with Mercury: Then with our two Quintessences it may be dissolved by and by,
and by way of circulation it may be separated from all company, and when it
shall be dissolved, you may give it to help against any great infirmity, if
thou know how to apply it conveniently.

CHAP. CXI. A great Secret of Silver.
SIlver, which we call Luna, is a Metal very bright in whiteness and next unto
gold, for of it may be made mavelous things, especially in dangerous
infirmities that are of importance. For being prepared and reduced into his
first matter, it may be accompanied with our Quintessence, and make thereof a
drink that will be very profitable against the Leprosy, and this composition
shall be given in the broth of a Chicken unto those that are Asmatick, for it
will do them great pleasure, and cure all those that are troubled with the
Leprosy. It makes also women's faces shining and mavelous fair. But when it
shall be further prepared, it will restore the sight unto those that are almost
blind through debilitie. Also if it be used in Alchymie, it will work strange
effects.

CHAP. CXII. Certain Secrets of Saturn.
SAturn is that metal which we call Lead, in the which is found great secrets
both in Physic and Surgery. For when it shall be brought into powder
without fire or other mixture, but only grinding it in a brazen mortar with
the spittle of a man, until it become into fine powder, it comfort much
against all corrosive and malign Ulcers, because it cools and dries
miraculously, but when Saturn shall be calcined and dissolved in Vinegar, and
his Salt taken forth, and then that Salt dissolved in our Quintessence, will
help many infirmities, and especially those that are caused of humiditie, and
caliditie, because it dries and cools by his Nature. Also an Unguent made of
the calx of Lead, serves against diverse sorts of Sores. Also if the Workmaster
were diligent, with Lead, Feretto of Spain, Vitriol, and Tutia, he might make a
metal like unto Gold of the Ducket, of the which he might receive a great
benefit.

CHAP. CXIII. Of the secrets of Copper.
When Venus shall be well prepared, and with art of fire shall be well
calcined, and done thereunto what is convenient, it will be valiant in his
operation. For of it is made an unguent, that mundifieth sores with great
speed. Also therewith is made a water, that helps all kind of crude
infirmities in the eyes: It helps Scabbes, and is of great profit against the
white scall, warts on the privy parts, and sores in the secret parts. For it
resolves them very vell. Moreover if the workman be his crafts master, he may
bring it into such an extreme whiteness, that it shall appear like Luna. Also
if he can amalgam it with Mars and Mercury, and give him his cocture, he may
draw forth a great quantity of Sol.

A great Secret of Copper, as concerning Chirurgerie.
Take Sal Niter lb. ii. Roch Allom half a pound, Sal Gem. four ounces, Vitriol
Roman one pound, Soot of the Chimney three ounces, mix these together, and
distill thereof a strong water according to art, that being done, put the water
into a Retort, and for every pound of water, put thereto four ounces of
Verdegriese finely cearsed, then set thereunto a Receiver, and give it fire
according to art, until all the fumes be come forth, then let it cool, and
break the glass, and take forth that which remained in the bottom, and beat
it to powder, then put that into another Retort, and put thereon as much
distilled Vinegar as the powder weighed, and distill it again, until there
come no more fumes, then let it cool, and break the glass, and take forth the
matter, and grind it to powder, and keep it in a glass that it take no air.
For this is most mavelous in ulcerated and putrified sores, because it
mundifieth, cleanses, and incarnateth, and with great speed brings them to
be whole with small pain, or none at all: If ye make an unguent thereof with
oil of Roses, Wax, and Frankincense, it helps all manner of sores with speed.

CHAP. CXIV. Of the Secrets of Jupiter or Tin.
IVpiter is a shining Metal, by the means of which all the other Metals become
shining, and are preserved, and in this is found great virtue and experience,
both in Physic and Chirurgerie, and also in Alchimie. For when it is well
prepared, and reduced into a potable water, it will be a glorious Medicine for
the solution of the Hectic, Tissick, and Dropsy. But if it be brought into a
Quintessence, and accompanied with our Quintessence, and the Quintessence of
Honey, it will be a precious Medicine to restore the sight of the eyes. Also if
the Chirurgians could well prepare it, after it is calcined, and make thereof
an Unguent with things appropriate, they might do strange cures therewith.
Moreover if the Alchymists could reduce him to his perfection, it would be a
Medicine of great price. For if they could join it with Venus purged and well
prepared, it would be as white as Luna, and then he that had a Medicine
appropriate, might bring it to a perfect body.

CHAP. CXV. Certain Secrets of Iron.
IRon, which the Alchymists do call Mars is a Mineral, the which is
appropriate against diverse and sundry infirmities when it is well prepared and
dissolved, the which is done in this manner.

Take Iron filed in powder, and dissolve it in strong water, the which solution
will be red like blood, then vapor away that water until it remain in a red
stone that has no moisture left in it, then break the glass, and grind it to
fine powder, and wash it with fair water, until the water remain sweet, then
dry it on a great fire, and grind it again, then put it into a glass with a
long neck, and put thereon Vinegar distilled likewise, and set it in warm
horse-dung thirty or forty days, and the powder shall be dissolved into
clear clear water, of the color of blood. And when that thou see it all
dissolved into water, vapor away the Vinegar, and there will remain a stone
blackish of color, which take forth of the glass, and grind it to powder,
then dissolve it in rectified Aqua vitae, and then shall be finished the
solution of Iron Physically, the which thou may give safely when need shall
require, and chiefly against Fluxes of the body, against spitting of blood, the
Emeroids, Scabs, and also for the Leprosy, and Tissick, and Hectic. And this
is the true solution of Iron devised by me, and I promise thee, that this is
one of the greatest Secrets that may be found in the world: and his virtues are
such and so many, that I cannot express them. And therefore I would wish all
Physicians and Chirurgians, to follow this glorious enterprise worthy of
praise, by the which means men may come to great perfection in Physic and
Chirurgerie, if they can use it when time and place shall serve.

CHAP. CXVI. Of the Secrets of Mercury.
QUicksilver is a liquid Mineral and Volatile, the which the Alchymists call
Sulphur volatilis, and will accompany with all other Metals, but with small
fire they may be separated again, and will fly away in Fume, and for that
cause the Philosophers call it Servus fugitivus, as a man would say, it can
hold friendship with none, but so soon as he has done his service he flies
away, as it is seen by Goldsmiths that gild Plate. For when they have laid him
on with the Gold, they put it to the fire, and he flies away, and the like it
should do when any man does occupy him in any sort of infirmity, and the
order to calcine it is thus.

Take a long pot of stone that is very well glazed, and that has a neck of a
foot and a half long, and that has a very narrow mouth as is possible, and put
therein two or three pound of Quicksilver, then set the same pot in a Sallet
of Iron, and lute them close together, and set it upon a Furnace, and give them
fire according to Art, until the Quicksilver remain calcined; giving you
charge, that your head and receiver be very well luted, least you loose some
part of the Quicksilver; and thus in eight days it shall be finished, the
which shall be apt unto solution: Also this calcination serves to diverse and
sundry Medicines: It mortifieth corrosive Ulcers without any pain; the solution
is made in this order.

Take the said Calx, and put it into a glass with a long neck, and put thereon
distilled Vinegar, and set it in warm sand four and twenty hours, and then
give it one walm, and when it has boiled, pour out the Vinegar, and then if
there remain any Feces in the bottom, put thereon fresh Vinegar, and do as
thou did before; and this thou shall do so often, till it be dissolved
into water, and when all is dissolved, evaporate away the Vinegar, that there
remain but little in the bottom; then put thereto water of Honey made by
distillation according to our order; and so the solution of Mercury shall be
finished, the which is miraculous in many infirmities: It serves against the
Cough, Catarhe, and for those that have their stomachs putrified with the Pox,
causing them to use it with other Sirrups or Potions: It helps those whose
Milt is indurated; and also for those, that have any sort of Fistula in any
part of the body: It is also good for diverse other things, the which I will not
write in this place, because I would have other men to exercise themselves in
the practice thereof, whereby they may find out diverse other secrets as I have
done.

The virtue of this Balm.
IT preserves all things from putrefaction that is put therein, or anointed
therewith, as the natural Balm does in all respects.

If any be touched with the Pestilence, so that the heart or brain be not yet
infected, give them. ii. thereof to drink, and anoint his stomach with the
same, and lay him down to sweat, and in once or twice using it, by the grace of
God they shall be helped, for it will suffer no venom to remain within the
body: Being taken in the aforesaid order, it helps those that have surfeited
by any means.

Being anointed on the stomach morning and evening, it causes an appetite,
and consumes cold humors: Also if ye drink thereof every morning. i.
fasting, it will purge the head and stomach of all superfluous moisture, and
sharpeneth the sight, if ye drop now and then one drop into the eye.

Being drunk as is aforesaid, it helps those that are troubled with the
Rheum, Catarhe, and Cough, and Stitch of the side caused of wind.

Being put into the ear, it comfort the sight and hearing marvellously, and
all impediments in the head, and consumes all evil humors by his proper
quality and nature, so that if ye use it, ye shall wonder at the operation.

It helps all manner of Wounds, in what place of the body soever they be, if
ye wash them therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same.

If ye wash the Sciatica therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same,
it takes away the pain presently.

It expels gravel in the Reins, being drunk with Parsley water.

It is good against the Fever quartain, if ye drink thereof ten or twelve
days together every morning. i. or ii. after that the stomach has been
evacuated.

It resolves aches and swellings coming of cold, if ye bath them therewith.

It helps the toothache, if ye hold it in your mouth so long as ye may
suffer it.

It helps those that are troubled with the Cramp, or that have their mouths
drawn awry by that means, if ye drink a small quantity, and hold the same in
your mouth, and then anoint the parts therewith.

FINIS.
A TREATISE OF SURGERY: PUBLISHED Wih many EXCELLENT EXPERIMENTS AND SECRETS;

Found out by the Same Author.

LONDON, Printed by G. D. 1652.

How that our Physic and Chirurgerie is better then that, the which the
Ancients have commonly used.
I Here is no doubt, but that our new Physic and Chirurgerie, is better then
that, the which the Ancients have used, because it helps the sick with more
ease and speed, and much more safer, and to show the truth, the Ancients had
never knowledge of our Dia Ar^matico, nor of Electuario Angelica, nor of our
Pillole Aquilone, nor did not make our Sirrupo solutivo, nor yet our magno
liquore, with a number of other Medicines found out by me, the which are
written in the end of this Book, with the which I have done wonderful cures,
as thou may read in my Thesauro de la vita humana, and truly most necesary
for all Professors of this Art, because therein thou shall find so many goodly
experiences, as it would cause the world to wonder thereat: But to return to
our purpose, I say that the Ancients, which had not knowledge of our remedies,
they wanted also knowledge of the true Physic and Chirurgerie, as by the
experience thou may see; I say not this to speak evil of those wise and
Ancient Doctors, that were Inventors thereof, but I say it to say the truth,
and many shall be my testimony of this truth. Because in many countries, where
our works that are Imprinted are come, they begin to pactice after our order.
And this order of curing, I repute it not to my Science, but a work that God
would reveal unto the world through my means, and to show the truth, there
has been none, that has found the Medicines for wounds with so much ease and
brevitie, as I have done.

Who has ever found the true Remedy for the Gout, for the Quartan, for
Fluxes, and all sorts of Fevers, as I have done? Or what is he that ever
brought the whole Art of Physic and Chirurgerie into eight small Volumes, as I
have done? What is he that ever writ of the Pestilence, and of his quality,
and remedies, and orders to be used in the same, as I have done? And if there
be any that does not credit me, let them make experience of all that I have
said; and I promise you, and swear as I am a true Knight, they shall find more
truth then I will write at this time, being as I have said, a Work given of
God, for a universal benefit of all the World, and therefore I exhort every
one of the Professors of Physic and Chirurgerie, to follow this our truth,
because they are of so great experience, that it seems miraculous unto man,
as I have seen many years ago, to my great honor, and satisfaction of the
people of the world, and thus doing and working, thou shall come to know that
our Physic and Chirurgerie is better and wholesomer, then that which has been
used of the Ancients until this present time.

Certain Remedies for all Captains and Soldiers that travel either by Water
or Land.
THere are three Infirmities, that offend the Soldiers in the camp above all
the rest, the which are these, Fevers, Wounds, and Fluxes of the body, the
which thou may help in this Order following, with these Medicines, that is,
our Quintessence of Wine, our Balsamo, Magno liquore, Quinta essentia solutiva,
and Specie Imperiale, and the order to use them is thus. When any has a Fever
or a Flux, then presently, when the disease begins, let him blood in one of
the two Veins under the tongue, cutting it overthwart, and this thou shall do
in the evening, then the next morning, take a dose of our Imperial powder mixed
with wine, and this ye may do without any diet or straight order, that being
done, give him three mornings together, half an ounce of our Quintessence
solutive with Broth. But if it be a Flux, and that the Patient is not cured,
let him stand in a cold bath of salt water of the Sea, three or four hours or
more, and he shall be perfectly helped.

Then as concerning wounds, as well cuts as thrusts, and as well gallings with
arrows, as Harquebusse-shot, and other sorts, thou shall cure them thus. The
first thing that ye shall do to them is to wash them very clean with Urine,
and then dry them well, then put therein our Quintessence of Wine, and
presently join the parts together, and sow or stitch them close, then put
thereupon five or six drops of our Balsamo, and upon the wound lay a cloth wet
in our Magno liquore, as hot as he may suffer it, and this ye shall do the
first day. Then the next day follow this Order: First put thereon our
Quintessence, and a little of our Balsamo, and then our Magno liquore, very
hot, and never change that Medicine, and thus doing the wound shall heal with
great speed, and in a quarter of the time, that the common Chirurgians are able
to do it, by the grace of God.

A short discourse of the most excellent Doctor and Knight Leonardo Phioravante
Bolognesse upon Surgery, with a declaration of many things necessary to be
known. Never written before in this order; whereunto is added a number of
notable secrets found out by the said Author.

The Preface.
IT is to be understood, that when the Almighty Creator had made the world, he
also created all manner of Beasts, as well on earth as in the water, with other
Fowls, after which, says the holy Scripture, he created man after his own
Image and similitude, and to him gave power over all things created, and with
the same grace and reason, through the which he was apt to rule, and have
knowledge of all through the Spirit of God, as to have knowledge of all things
whereunto he gave his mind and understanding, as it is at this present to be
seen among men in the world, that have knowledge of diverse and sundry things,
all necessary for those that will live in the world with honor: For some
understand the Art of Husbandry, which was the first Art used in the world, for
so much as without it we cannot well live, as it is plainly seen. There are
others that have knowledge in keeping beasts of all kinds, apt or meet for man's
body, as Goats, Kine, Hogs, Hens, Geese, Horses, Mules, and such like. There
are others that have knowledge in Navigation, without the which also the world
would be unperfect, as it is seen by experience. There be others that have
knowledge in Cosmograhie, whereby they know diverse parts of the world whether
men may travel. There be others that have knowledge in the Art of Wars,
whereby they may help to defend their Prince and Countries in executing of
justice. There be others that understand Astrology, by the which they know the
course of Planets, and their effects: Others understand the Mathematics,
whereby they measure land and all other things: Others study Music to accord
voices together: And others understand Physic to help the diseased bodies of
humane Creatures, and also Animals of diverse and sundry infirmities. There be
others that understand Surgery, to help all manner of sores that happen unto
men: upon which Surgery we will write a brief discourse, and pleasant
reason, and will leave apart the Science that is doubtful, because there is no
Science in the world wherewith a man may do good, if therewith be no practice
or experience, as a man may say. The which experience is master of all things,
as it is plainly seen; and therefore we will give you to understand, which of
those parts be best or most necessary in this Surgery, either to help those
that are hurt, or the Science, or experience. And we will show the mere truth
without any dissimulation or fraud, as I have always done in my Works which
are printed, and at this present do intend to do, if Almighty God give me
grace, and quicken my spirits or wits, in writing that which shall be to his
honor, and profit to the world.

What Surgery is.
Surgery is both Science and practice, and to say the truth, he that will
know the composition of man's body, must of necessity have some Science, and be
Anatomist, although the same Science be a thing to be learned by practice, for
I have seen many times, those which were unlearned, to be expert in the Anatomy
of man's body, and those were Painters and Drawers, the which was necessary for
them to know to frame their figures accordingly: and therefore I take not that
for Science, but practice: For Science is only that wherewith the causes of
every infirmity is found out, and is of small effect to our purpose, because
Surgery helps not only the cause, but also the effect after it is known,
and therefore I may say, that Surgery is no other then a pure and mere
practice, and that it is only necessary for the Chirurgian to know how to
stitch a Wound well, to mundifie an Ulcer, and to keep it from putrefaction,
and keep it from alteration, so that there run no evil humors unto the place
offended, and to know all kind of Unguents that are apt to heal all kind of
Wounds and Ulcers, which thing must be known by practice, And likewise to make
all manner of Unguents necessary for Surgery, and for that cause I conclude
most truly, that our Surgery is only practice or experience. And that which
causes me to believe it is, that I have always seen the most part of
Chirurgians, when they should have any case in Surgery, they knew not what
Unguent would help the sore, but many times they prove this, and that, and so
continue until they have found one that is convenient for the sore, whereunto
it is applied, and therefore this is a certain sign, that they know not by
Science their Medicine to help the sore, but with experience they search it.
Therefore if it be so, it is a sign that I have said the truth, and so
conclude, that Surgery is a practice to help sores on men's bodies, and also
on beasts, when occasion shall serve.

What Wounds are.
VVOunds are those which in Latin are called Vulnus, and of the vulgar
Vulnera, and they are of two kinds, that is, simple, and compound. The simple
are those that are only in the flesh, the compound are those where are cut
Sinews, Veins, Musckles, and Bones, and these are of diverse and sundry kinds,
And the difference that is among them is, by the variety of the place where
they are wounded, and by the difference of the weapon wherewith they were hurt,
for some go right, some overthwart, some long, some broad, some are thrusts or
stocate, that offend diverse parts of the body. The simple are of small
importance, because if ye keep them clean and close shut, nature will heal
them without any kind of Medicine. But those, where Veins are cut, have need of
some art or practice, with the which they may stop the blood, and in any wise
not to suffer the wound to remain open, but to sow it up very close, so that
the Vein may heal. Also those where Sinews are hurt are of great importance,
and would be healed with great speed, so that the Sinews may join with more
ease. But those where Bones are hurt, are of greater importance, for if the
Bone be separated from the other, of necessity it must be taken forth before
the Wound be healed. So that by this means every one may know what Wounds are,
and their kinds.

Of Ulcers, and what they are.
ULcers are of diverse and sundry kinds, and are ingendered of many causes, as
hereafter I will show. But first I will write of those kind of Ulcers that are
caused of Wounds. You shall understand, that Wounds, in what part of the body
soever they be, being imposthumated, or cancrenated, they change their names,
and are no more called Wounds, although the original was a wound. For when it
is cancrenated, it is called Vlcera corrosiva, because it goes eating and
creeping on the flesh. But when the wound is imposthumated and full of matter,
it is called, Vlcera putrida, that is putrified, and it is because it is filthy
and stinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated, nor yet aposthumated, but
that through some evil disposition the wound is closed, and that there comes
in it evil qualities without alteration, then it is called Vlcera sordida,
because therein is evil quality, and it appears but a little, but it is
evil to heal. There be other sorts of Ulcers also, the which are caused of
diverse and sundry kinds of tumors, and the most evil and mischievous are
those that are of tumors caused of the Pox, for unto those there runs
abundance of evil humors that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worst sort,
for they cannot be healed by themselves, except the body be well purged and
evacuated of all the humors that are offensive. There is another kind of Ulcer
the which comes of an Imposthume, as well hot as cold, and those are more
gentle and easy to be helped, if ye know the Medicines that are apt to help
and dissolve those kind of Ulcers.

These are the three kind of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women
through diverse causes, as it is said before, so that these are the principal
causes of those malign Ulcers.

Of Imposthumes, and their kinds.
IMposthumes are a certain kind of Tumor that are called after diverse
manners, because they come in diverse places of the body, as those sorts of
Imposthumes that come in the Groin, which in Venice are called Pannoche, in
Rome, Tencone, in Naples, Dragonselly, in Spain, Incordi, and the Ancients
called them Buboni, and some with other names. There are other that come in all
parts of the body, and when they come they cause great pain, and then they
ripen and break of themselves for the most part, and these in Naples, are
called Autrax, and in Rome, Chicholini, in Venice, Vn-nasito, in Lumbardie, Un
bungo, and in Spain, Un nacido mui viliaco. There is another kind of
Imposthume, that is ingendered of a contusion or bruise, and is properly called
Apostumatio pro Amacatura. In the Head there grow certain kinds of sores that
are called Talpae, or Topinare, the which are of small Importance, for they may
be healed in short time, and these are seen in childrens heads, that are often
troubled therewith, and sometimes in their throats, and for the most part about
the ears.

Of Fistulaes, and their kinds.
ALl manner of Sores that do not siccatrize perfectly, and have communication
with the inward parts, are called Fistulaes, and we term them in Italian Sofio,
or Spiraculo, as ye may see by experience, and this is perilous, when a
Fistula closes, being in the body, and specially those Fistulaes that are in
the Fundament, for Nature her self does engender it for ease. But these
Fistulaes that come in diverse parts of the body are troublesome, but not
perilous: Also all such sores as tarry long before they be incarnated come to
Fistulaes, and many times it comes through their being long curing, by tenting
with their tents, which are the causes that Nature makes a Callow, and leaves
the sore so hollow, that it will never be filled with flesh, but so remain
hollow, as it is seen easily by experience. There be other sorts of Fistulaes
in form of a sore, and they be those sores that most commonly come on the
legs, the which do purge a long time, and are also very hard to heal, because
if ye heal one of them presently, there will rise another hard by it, and that
is a kind of Fistula* There is another kind of Fistula that is caused of those
sores that are upon the bone, the which by his continuance do break and
consume the skin and the bone, and these many times remain Fistulated, but who
so takes away the cause of the sore, nature it self will prevail mightily, and
will heal it, as may be seen daily by experience, in those that be so troubled.
The Fistulaes that come in the eyes, are called Fistula Lachrymosa, and they
have some communication with the inward parts, and are evil to be healed.
Because first the cause must be taken away inwardly, and then nature will heal
it by it self, as I have seen by experience, so that these are the kinds of
Fistulaes most known unto all men, and the causes of these Fistulaes are two,
and for my part I am fully persuaded it is so. The First is of wounds evil
healed, that remain Fistulated. The Second cause, I find to be of sores caused
of the Pox, and to show a truth, ye shall cure them of the Pox, and their
Fistulaes will heal of themselves without any other help, as it is daily to be
seen. There may be many other causes the which as yet I know not, but these two
are a sufficient reason, and to be considered of the Professors of this Art, if
they desire to come to any excellency; and therefore I will reason no more of
the matter, because the Science, and my experience will reach no further.

Of all sorts of Scabs.
THere be diverse kinds of Scabs, but I will only treat of those in which I
have had most experience, and will set them forth as plainly as I can, that
every one thereby may have profit. The first kind of Scab is that which is
caused of Ripletion of the body, by eating much meat of great nourishment, and
then not to digest it, so in that cause nature, to ease it self, sends forth
that humiditie, and when it joyneth to the skin, it ingrosseth and causes an
Imposthume, and passing to the outward parts, it is already corrupted, and so
causes the Pustulaes, as by experience may be seen, and this kind is a
viscous and fat humor with great humidity. There is another kind of Scab that
is always dry with redness, and is small, with great heat and Itching, and
the same in my judgment is caused by much heat of the Liver; and adustion of
blood, and may be healed easily. There is another kind of great scab that has
a great dry crust on them, and they grow big, and the same is of the French Pox
being new taken. There is another kind like Serpigo, that goes creeping, and
has a dry crast, and has no matter under it; and the same is also of the
French Pox inveterated. There are also diverse other kinds, the which I will
leave at this time, because they are of small importance, and may be helped
with those Medicines which are fit for the ^inds aforesaid.

Of Formicola, and his Effects.
THose kind of Ulcers that are commonly called Mal di Formica, are so called,
because they are a kind of malign Ulcers and corrosive, that goes creeping
upon the flesh, and makes many holes that are lifted up on the sides, and are
red, and these for the most part are caused of the Pox, as may be seen by
experience, and these sores are evil to be healed, because thereunto runs
abundance of humors, the which cannot be resolved but with inward Medicines,
that is, with exquisite Purgations that purify the blood, and that cutteth
away the evil humors that run thereunto, and cause great alteration with
burning. This kind of sore comes many times in the head, and when it comes
in that part, it is called Tigna, or the white scall, and to show that this is
the truth, ye may see that those Medicines which heal Formicola, does also
heal the white Scall, for this is a kind of the Pox, as by the Effects ye may
plainly see; for if any should say the contrary, I would answer him again, that
this may well be, because the same infirmity may be taken in the mothers womb,
or as soon as the child is borne, it may take it of the Nurse that gives it
suck, if she be infected with that disease, so that I conclude it may be so.
But there are a number of that kind of disease, which I let pass, because I
have seen no experience of them.

A Discourse of Wounds, and other kinds of Inward Sores.
VVOunds that are within the body, as in the stomach, or belly, or Intestinals,
in the bladder, reins, or guts; The Milt, Liver, Lungs, Heart or other Muskles
or Arteries, as there be a number, I confess to know nothing therein, and I
will show you the reason: You shall understand, that when a wound does offend
the Interior parts, the Physician or Chrurgian, or great Anatomist whatsoever
he be, cannot know all those parts offended in the body, for after the weapon
is within the body, it may turn, and with the point hurt other parts afar off
the wound, and offend diverse particular parts one different from the other, and
therefore I beseech you, excellent Chirurgians, when such a case comes, how
do you know or discern which parts are hurt? but to say the truth, I believe
in that case they know all alike, but what should I say of the cure of such a
wound, if the Chirurgian know not where it is, nor of what importance, but
works by imagination, and if that Nature does prevail, and that the wound
does heal, it is by the good fortune of the Physician, so that for wounds
inwardly I, conclude no other at this time, but will leave it to those that
know more then I, and hereafter I will discourse of Ulcers and Imposthumes
inwardly, what they are, and how to cure them with our order: ye shall
understand that there are a number of kinds of Ulcers and Imposthumes that may
engender inwardly, but it seems to me so hard to understand, that I can
determine nothing that were true, and the cause is this, that we have seen an
infinite of Physicians and Chirurgians that have visited one Imposthumated, or
Ulcerated, and the Physician could not know the place, and particular of that
Imposthume or Ulcer, if that the Patient do not tell him and show him, and
cause him to feel with his hand, and this is most true, and therefore if one
cannot resolve him of outward things, that he may see and feel with his hand,
how can he resolve him when one of those accidents is within the body, where
the Patient knows not himself, which is grieved? Truly, I would gladly know
what judgment they would give of that matter, for because if there be any
Imposthume or Ulcer in any part of the body, the sick shall feel great offense
and pain, nevertheless he cannot tell where it is, nor what part is hurt, so
that I conclude, if that the Patient know not, much less the Physician
knows, and of this I have made a large discourse in Caprici medicinale, for
as I have said before, in this case I know nothing. Nevertheless, when it
shall come to his place, I will write a discourse of the order to cure the most
part o^ ^liters, and Imposthumes, but touching wounds, I will promise no more
then I have said before. Also I will write excellent Remedies of great
experience, with the which all wounds, so they be not mortal, may be helped and
healed, and also the reasons convenient in that matter.

An order to use in healing all manner of Diseases appertaining unto the
Chirurgian.
VVOunds and all other sorts of sores, are of sundry and diverse kinds, as is
aforesaid, nevertheless the order to help them is not much different one from
the other, if we should say only the truth without abuse. For ye shall
understand, that Nature is the master of all things created, and the Physician
and Chirurgian are helpers of that Nature, as the ancient Professors of the Art
have affirmed. Then seeing this is so, what need we to make such ado, having
Nature that works so gently, if it be not hindered by the Minister, and
therefore if we will speak of Wounds, I say, that the Minister has three
operations to do and no more, and the rest leave to Nature that works
gently. The three operations that the Master has to do are these: To defend
the Wound so that there runs no humors to it, and that it putrfie not, and
to keep it clean, and when the Minister has done that, let Nature work that
which she will work well, and if any desire to see if it will be so in effect,
ye may see by a Dog, for if he has a great wound upon his body, he heals it
without any Medicine, only with diet, and keeping it clean with his tongue,
and this is most true, that those which do help Wounds by enchantment, do
nothing but keep the Wound clean, and cause the Patient to keep a diet, and so
nature works as well on a Man as on a Dog, therefore let none marvel of this
authority of a Dog, although I approve the like of a Christian. But for so much
as it would be good to help Nature, that it might work with more speediness,
as Husbandmen and Gardners do, who because they would have Nature to work the
better, and quicker in their ground, do cast thereon diverse sorts of dungs,
etc. The which is done only to help Nature to work the quicker, and to
conclude, I say, that the Chirurgian should do the same in helping of Wounds.
But as for Ulcers of diverse sorts, it were necessary to find out the cause,
because they come of diverse causes, for when the cause is found, it will be
more easy to be helped, because Ulcers cannot come but by great distemperance
of Nature in our bodies, as by great heat or cold, or by repletions of the
body. Therefore in this case it is necessary to purge the body: First, to ease
Nature which is offended, and to extinguish the superfluous heat or cold that
is in the body: That being done, the minister or helper of Nature has three
things to do. The first is to mortify or kill the sore, the second to
mundifie, and the third to incarnate, and then Nature will cicatrize it, and
these three operations are to be used in Ulcers. Also Imposthumes are caused of
diverse accidents, in the which it is also necessary to seek out the cause,
whereby to know what purgations are fit to purge the body of the superfluous
humors, and then the Minister has three things to do in that case. First to
bring it to maturation quickly, then when it is ripe and broke, to mundifie it
well, and thirdly to incarnate it, and these are the three operations that are
to be done in an Imposthume to help Nature to work well, and so following this
order thy work shall prove well, and go the right way, as hereafter I will
show in his place, the operations to use in the effect, with the order to help
them, and also to make thy Unguents, showing their quality and virtue, and will
prove by reason those things that are doubtful, so that every one shall be
satisfied in that matter.

Of Medicines to be used in all kind of Wounds outward, with ease and brevity.
HAving declared what outward Wounds are, it is also necessary to show the
order how to cure them, with as much speed and ease as it is possible, and
therefore I will begin first with simple Wounds that are only in the flesh,
without offense of Veins, Sinews, or Bones, although these need no help, but
only to join the lips close together, and if need be, to stitch them close,
and then let Nature work, the which in short time will heal them, but if thou
by Art wilt help nature, thou shall anoint them with oil of frankincense once
a day. But Wounds, where Veins are cut, have need of present help, and
artificial means, and sufficient remedies to help it, with as much speed as
may be, so that the Veins cut may join again together, without any great
offense of the Wound, and that is done in this order. The first thing is to
join the parts close together, and stitch it well, not as the common
Chirurgians do, but as they do use to stitch bags, and when it is stitched
close, anoint it only upon the Wound with our Magno l^quore, and lay thereon
a cloth wet in the same Oil very warm, then take Hypericon with the seed,
Millefolie, Viticella, ana and make thereof a powder, the which thou shall
strew upon the Wound being dressed, and round about it, for this Medicine does
assubtiliate the matter that runs unto the Wound, and takes it forth with
great ease, and without pain of the Wound, for this is the most sovereign
Medicine in that case, that Nature with Art may make, and has been proved a
thousand times by experience in diverse places. But those Wounds where Bones and
Sinews are hurt, have need of great artifice and cunning, because they be of
importance; But when the Sinews be only offended, it were necessary to stitch
them presently, as I have said of those where Veins are cut, but not to dress
it with Magno liquore, but instead thereof to take our Ole^m Benedictum, and
Oil of Frankincense, of each alike, for those Oils do exceedingly comfort the
Sinews that are cut, and when it happens that a Sinew has a puncture, or is
cut half way, in that case it were necessary to cut it overthwart, because it
shall bring no Spasmus to the Wound, but if so be then that the Bone be hurt,
and that there be any part to come forth, it were necessary to leave the Wound
open until the Bone comes forth, and then to incarnate it, and this thou
shall do with our artificial Balm, for the same serves for Wounds, and lay
thereupon the Cerot of Gualtifredo di Medi, the which heals it with speed,
and so with these orders thou may help all the aforesaid sorts of Wounds,
and the defensive to use in these Wounds is this. Rec. Aqua vitae made of pure
wine, and that will burn all away, and put therein Hypericon, Millefollie,
Viticella, Betonica, and then wet a cloth in that infusion and, lay it for a
defensive round about the Wound, and so thou shall have thine intent to the
great satisfaction of the Patient. Wounds in the head are helped as those are
where the Sinews are offended, there are also diverse other sorts of Wounds
which are helped with the Remedies by us formerly mentioned.

To help Ulcers of all sorts.
SEeing that Ulcers are of diverse and sundry kinds, it were necessary to know
of what kind and quality they are, so that thou may help them in form and
order convenient, and first I will write of the corrosive Ulceras of a wound
cancrenated, mal di Formicola, and other sorts of Ulcers that go creeping upon
the flesh. The cure of these kinds of Ulcers is to apply quickly our Caustike
to mortify the evil, the which thou shall do thus, wet a little bumbaste in
our Caustike, and therewith wash all the sore, and then leave it so open
twenty four hours without binding it fast, and when twenty four hours are
past, wash the sore with strong Vinegar and water, of each a like quantity,
with charge, that there remain none of the Caustike in the sore, then lay
thereon butter washed, with a colewort leaf until the asker or dead flesh fall
away, then take our Cerot Magistrale, with a little Precipitate strewed
thereon, and then anoint it with Magno liquore, and lay it upon the sore, for
this Cerot helps all manner of corrosive Ulcers without any other help, and
every Plaster will serve three or four days, taking them off every twenty
four hours, and make them clean, and then lay them on again, and as for the
filthy Ulcer that I have showed of in his Chapter, ye shall dress them only
with our Vnguento magno, the which without any other help will heal them
quickly: But ye must every four days touch them with Aqua fortis drawn from
Precipitate, the which water draws forth the offensive matter, and leaves it
putrified and clean; and in all other sorts of Ulcers, our Balm artificial,
our Magno liquore, Oil of Wax and Turpentine, the Black Cerot of Gualtifredo,
di Medi, our Cerot Magistrale, with Precipitate, are able to help, be they
never so evil.

The Order to be used in curing Imposthumes of diverse sorts.
THere be many sundry kinds of Imposthumes that comes to man's body, that are
caused of diverse and sundry accidents, and therefore must be cured by diverse
orders, and with sundry Medicines according to his kind, because some
Imposthumes are caused of a contusion or bruised flesh, some are certain
griefs, that Nature would discharge her self of, and so sends forth that
matter, some are caused of cold, others of melancholy humors, and others are
caused of corruption of the Pox, and these are the kinds of Imposthumes that
commonly come, and hereafter I will show the order to cure them one after
another.

And first of those that are caused of a contusion, because it is bruised
flesh, for every contusion must be putrified and brought to matter, therefore
make a maturative, and bring it to suppuration, and when you know there is
matter, presently lance them, and dress them with this Medicine as well
within as without, the which without any other help will heal any great
contusion. But you must make the Unguent fresh every day, and with new Eggs,
ye shall mix the yoalk of an Egg with our Magno liquore, and therewith dress
them. And as for those Imposthumes that come by indisposition of Nature, are
certain Sborine, a word so called in Italian, by the which Nature would
prevail: it were necessary to let those have their cures according to Nature,
until they break of themselves, and when they are broken, dress them within
with this Unguent. Oil of Roses,. vi. Litarge of Gold in fine powder,. ii.
Storax liquida,. i. Turpentine two ounces, yellow Wax,. iii. mix them and boil
them one the fire until it be black, and if it be too hard, put thereto more
oil of Roses, and make it in form of an Unguent, and therewith dress those
kinds of Imposthumes, and lay thereon the Cerot Diapalma, and therewith will
be wrought miracles. Also for those Imposthumes caused of cold, ye shall use
hot Medicines and attractives: The Cerot of Oxicrocii is excellent in those
kind of Imposthumes, our Balm artificial, or the water, and such like things
as are temperate by Nature. But those Imposthumes that have their Original of
the French Pox, are evil and malign, because their cause is malign and evil,
and therefore their cure is with great purging, and to let the Imposthume ripe
of himself, and when ye lance it, dress it within with our Vnguento magno,
mixed thus,. Vnguento magno. ii. Magno liquore i. Precipitate,. ss. mix them
well together, and therewith dress the Imposthume, the which will heal quickly
and well, and lay thereon our Cerot Magistrale, with this charge, that in all
the cures aforesaid ye purge the body well, so that the humors run not unto
the place offended, and use defensives according to the kind of Imposthume, as
oil of Frankincense, of Turpentine of Wax, of Honey, Aqua vitae: all these are
excellent defensives by themselves, anointing them round about the Imposthume.

The Order to cure all manner of Fistulaes.
FIstulaes, as I have said before, are of diverse kinds, and caused of diverse
accidents, and so likewise they have need of diverse Medicines, and first I will
write of those Fistulaes that come of Wounds evil healed, and that have made a
callow in that order that Nature cannot siccatrize, and so remain Fistulated,
and the cure of these kind of Fistulaes is to put therein a Rupture that does
cut and mortify the callow, and causes it to fall away, and then with
incarnating Medicines, incarnate them, and siccatize them, and this is the true
cure of these Fistulaes. But those kind of Fistulaes that nature causes to
ease her self of some accident, commonly come in the lower parts about the
fundament, and they be very perilous, and and not to be healed as they before
were. But they must be with purging the body, stomach, and head, the which is
to be done thus, First, purge them ten or twelve days with our Magistral
Sirrup, then give them our Aromatico, and drink thereon a little white Wine,
then purge the head with a perfume made of Myrrha and Cinaber, after these
things be done ye shall rectify the Liver with some decoction fit for that
purpose, as of Lignum Sanctum, or Sarsa parilla, or such like that work effect,
for this Medicine does also help Fistula lachrymosa, that commonly come about
the eyes or ears. There be other Fistulaes in form of a sore, which must be
helped with purging, and lay upon the sore our Cerot Magistrale with
Precipitate, and anoint it with Magno liquore, for with this Cerot only may
all Fistulated sores be healed, for it does mundifie and afterward siccatrize
it, there be also diverse such like matters that are easily cured, if ye apply
thereunto those Medicines that are appropriate.

To help all manner of Scabs.
THe kinds of Scabs be many, and caused of diverse causes, and their cures are
also diverse ways. Those that are caused of repletion of the body, and of
gross blood, the which are caused by eating abundance of such meats as are of
great nourishment, the which if thou will cure them, it were necessary to purge
them with our Sirrupo Solutivo, ten or twelve days, then give him or her one
dram of our Aromatico in the morning fasting, and drink thereon a cup of
sweet Wine, then let him sweat three or four times, and after anoint him with
our Vnguento magno two or three times, and it will heal him of those kind of
scabs.

Now to cure that kind of seab that is red and small, and causes great
itching, you shall make a decoction of Herbs, that cool the liver and purify
the blood, as Borage, Buglosse, Endive, Maidenhair, Liver-wort, Hart's-tongue,
Agrimony, Citrach, Succorie, and such like Herbs, then purge with Alves, the
juice of Elder roots, Hiera pigra solutiva, and such like, as does cool the
Liver and Blood, and then anoint them with Vnguento di Lithargirio, and
therewith you shall help all those kinds of seabs. There be also certain great
scabs over all the body, the which are very thick, and those are a kind of the
Pox, the which may be helped with giving them our Pillole contra il mal
Francese, the quantity is according to the discretion of the Physician, and
these Pills ye shall take three times every third day, and then anoint them
with our Vnguento magno, and he shall be helped. There is another kind of scab
that goes creeping with a dry crust like unto Petigine, and those are the mere
Pox inveterated, and and the order to cure them is thus, give them our Sirrup
against the melancholy humor, because it purges the blood and cools the
Liver, and dissolveth that viscous humor that ingendereth that crust, that
being done, give them our Aromatico, and anoint them with our Magno liquore,
and he shall be perfectly helped in short space. There are other kind of Scabs
that come through great cold, and those are healed only with anointing them
with oil of Frankincense three or four times.

To help Mal di Formica.
THose be certain Ulcers which go creeping in the upper part of the flesh, and
have many orifices or mouths, and these are caused of the Pox being
inveterated, the which are cured in that order that the Pox is, and that is
this: First, purge the body with our Electuario Angelica, the which purges
away gross and malign humors, and evacuateth the stomach of choler and phlegm,
this being done, cause the Patient to sweat, for that will assubtiliate the
humors, and cause them to come forth, that being done, take our Cerot
Magistrale, and strew thereon Precipitate, and then anoint it with our Magno
liquore, and lay it upon the sore, and there let it lie twenty four hours
before ye change it, then make it clean, and lay it on again, for that Plaster
may serve four days, making it clean every 24. hours, and when the Plaster
will draw no more matter, you shall use our Vnguento magno, the which will help
it in short time. But if it do happen that this Order do not cure them, then
it would be necessary for them to be anointed with the Unction for the Pox,
and to anoint them so long till the mouth be sore, and when that sign does
appear, anoint them no more, for he will spit or vapor at the mouth for
twelve or fifteen days, and as soon as he vapoureth make a Bath and wash him
well, and wash the mouth with Wine, and without all doubt it shall help him God
willing; now hereafter I will write of certain things which are used of common
Chirurgians, with a brief discourse upon them.

Of the Tow which is laid upon Wounds by common Chirurgians.
THe pleggits of Tow, which are laid upon Wounds when they are first stitched
is made in this order.. The white of an Egg, Salt, and Rosewater, and beat
them together, and when the Wound is stitched then lay it thereon, because the
blood should stint, and the Wound remain shut, so that it may be helped with
more ease. Now touching this, I will show thee a reason why they use it in
their first cure, ye shall understand, that every like desires his like to
succor him, or keep company with him, and therefore the Ancients, our ancient
Professors of Art, willed the white of an Egg to be occupied in Wounds,
because it is a substance of flesh like unto the other flesh; and to declare
the truth, I will prove it by natural reason, for ye shall understand, that
the white of the Egg is that part which ingendereth the flesh, the skin, and
the feathers of the Hen, and the yolk ingendereth only the guts and other
intrals of the Animal, then seeing the white is that which ingendereth the
flesh only, it is like unto flesh, as it is said before; then the Salt is a
material which preserves all things from putrefaction, as is seen by
experience daily, and for that consideration it was put in this Composition to
preserve the flesh, the Rosewater by nature is cold and dry, and by his
coldness defends the inflammation, and by his dryness is repercussive, and
mittigateth, so that these are the reasons why the said Tow is laid upon
Wounds, but I would to God that such things were used, as by their excellent
operations would help and heal from the beginning to the latter ending and to
leave of such trifling orders.

Of the digestive with the which they dress wounds after the aforesaid Tow.
AFter that the Tow is taken away from the Wound they dress it with a
Composition called digestive, because it digesteth the Wound, although this
Medicine be somewhat scrupulous, and against Science, and the reason is this,
ye shall understand, that when a man is wounded, the place before was sound,
and therefore being wounded, our true duty is to help the same Wound, and not
to digest or rot it, as commonly all Chirurgians do, for by rotting of it in
that order it is perilous, and more dangerous to be cured, as is daily seen by
experience, and this no man can deny. But now I will follow our Regiment in
showing what this digestive is, the which is made thus.

The yolk of two Eggs, Turpentine washed. i. Oil of Roses. ss. mix them in an
Unguent, and this is the digestive wherewith they dress it until the sore
have made matter enough, and then they use to dress it with Medicines much
differing from the same; but I marvel much at the diversity of this matter,
that this digestive being applied to a putrified Ulcer works diverse effects,
for it heals it divinely: and moreover, ye shall understand, that if it be
applied unto when they be incarnated, it will sicatrize them marvellously, for
truly these are things worthy to be known, and he that understands the
reason, I account him to be wise, for if this digestive be laid on fresh wounds
it putrifieth and rotteth them, again being laid on a filthy sore it does
mundifie and heal, and then if it be applied on a Wound incarnated, it
sicatrizeth and heals it, for this I have done diverse and sundry times, the
which is to be wondered at.

Of the mundificative Unguent wherewith they dress the Wounds after they are
digested to mundifie them.
When Wounds are come to digestion, and that they purge, always they change
Unguents, and they apply Unguents that have virtue to mundifie the Wound and
make it clean, so that it may the better incarnate, and that Unguent is called
properly a mundificative, the which is made of Barley flower, and Honey, or Honey
of Roses, and Oil of Roses, and this is the mundificative they use eight or ten
days together, for if the Wound were not well mundified, it would never
incarnate well, so that this Unguent is most necessary in that operation, in
respect of the ingredient.

Of their incarnative wherewith they dress the Wound after it is mundified.
When that the Wound is mundified, so that thereunto comes small quantity of
matter, then it is necessary to apply Unguents that incarnate, so that they may
siccatrize with more ease, and this kind of incarnative is in the most use
among the common Chirurgians, the which is made of Turpentine, Wax, and
Frankincense, and a little Oil of Roses mixed on the fire, and this is their
incarnative.

A rare secret, the which this Author did send unto a special friend of his,
being in the wars in Africa, the which helps all Wounds, either by cut,
thrust, galling with Arrows, or harquibush-shot, or otherwise.
THe first thing that ye shall do is, to wash the Wound very clean with
Urine, and then dry it very well, then put therein our Quintessence of Wine,
and presently join the parts close together, and stitch or sow them well, but
in any wise sow nothing but the skin, for otherwise it would cause great pain,
then put thereon five or six drops of our Balsamo, and upon the Wound lay a
cloth wet in our Magno liquore, as hot as he may suffer it, and this do the
first day, then the next day follow this order, first put thereon our
Quintessence, and a little Balsamo, and then our Magno liquore very hot, and
never change this Medicine until it be whole.

Of those Unguents that siccatrize Wounds.
THe Unguents that siccatrize Wounds after they are incarnated be of diverse
kinds, although they work one effect in siccatrizing, or causing a skin. The
digestion that is written of before, being applied upon a Wound incarnated,
does siccatrize it with speed, the like does Diachilon, and Vnguentum de Tutia.
The Cerot called Gratia Dei, although these be sundry Compositions one
differing from another, yet in effect they serve all to this siccatrization, as
ye may see by experience, and this they do, because they be temperate and of
good qualities, and so they help nature to work more quickly, and they are
called helpers of nature. But these kind of Unguents that work by themselves,
as Vnguento Apostolorum, the Caustic, Aegypciacum, the Rottery, and such like
Unguents as work with violence, and suppress nature, and do that which nature
cannot do by it self without help, but all those Unguents that are not violent
neither in heat or cold, are apt to siccatrize Wounds, and all sores, that are
mundified and incarnated.

A Remedy to help a Wound with great speed, of our invention.
VVOunds of diverse and sundry sorts are very perilous of life, but to help
them quickly, because the Patient may take no harm, ye shall use this secret,
wash the Wound with our water of Balm, and cleanse it well, and lay thereon
clothes wet in Oil of Frankincense made by distillation, and therewith thou
shall heal any great Wound in short time, as I have proved diverse and sundry
times, in sundry causes.

An excellent secret to heal Wounds of Gunshot, or Arrows, without any danger.
IF thou will help the aforesaid Wounds, it were necessary first to join the
parts close too, and wash it with our Aqua celestis, and lay thereon our Oleum
Balsami, and therewith thou shall save the lives of many wounded persons.

A Discourse upon old Wounds that are not yet healed, and their sovereign
Remedy.
When that Wounds are evil healed, and that they imposthumate, and that the
Arm, or Leg, or other parts where they were wounded, is indurated and full of
pain, thou shall use this secret of our invention, never known before of old
nor new Writers, for it is of great virtue, and many times proved: first ye
shall wash the Wound well, and make it clean round about, then wash the Wound
with our Quintessence, and make it to fume, because our Quintessence does open
the pores, and assubtiliateth the matter, and causes the humor to come forth,
that being done, anoint it all over with our Magno liquore, and thus doing,
before three days end he shall feel great ease, and in short time it shall be
helped, because this Medicine takes away the hardness, and heals the Wound,
and comfort the place offended.

To dissolve a Bruise in short time, when it is new done.
THese are called Contusions, unto the which nature sends quickly great
quantity of humidity, and in that place it causes Imposthumation: But if our
Chirurgians would be diligent and quick, all Contusions might be helped with
great ease in short time, and therefore if thou will work miracles in the cure,
use this our means, and it will turn to thy great honor, and the remedy is
this.

. Liquid Vernish three pound, yellow Wax. iv. common Ashes. vi. Aqua vitae
rectified two pound. Put all the aforesaid matters in a Retort of glass, and
distill it with a gentle fire until all the substance be come forth, the which
will be Oil and water, the which ye shall separate, and keep them, and when
occasion serves, anoint the Bruise therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in
the same, for this is a miraculous Medicine, experimented and proved by reason,
for an experiment without reason is as a man without clothes, and therefore if
thou will know great and rare secrets never written before, look in my Spechio
del scientia universali, and in my Thesauro del vita humana, and therein thou
shall find strange things proved by reason and experience, the which books God
willing, I mean to set forth in the English tongue to the profit of my Country.

To help a Wound quickly that is in peril of any accident.
VVOunds in some parts of the body are very dangerous of life; and especially
where Sinews be cut or peirced, or Veins or Muscles hurt, or Bones broke, and
by an infinite of other particulars, which being open or evil healed, the
Patient may be in danger of life, because the wind enters in, and they cause
pains and inflammation, and therefore to avoid all these aforesaid matters, so
that the Wound shall have no detriment, use this remedy. First join the parts
close together, and put therein our Quintessence, and lay thereon a cloth wet
in our Balm, and bind it fast that the air get not in, for it is very hurtful;
ye shall understand, that these are two of the excellentest Medicines that may
be found, because our Quintessence does assubtiliate the blood, and takes it
forth, and takes away the pain, and the Balm does warm and comfort the place
offended, and will not suffer any matter to run thereunto by any means, for
this is most true, as I have proved diverse and sundry times, and always have
had good success.

To stop the flux of blood in Wounds with great speed.
When there is any great flux of blood in Wounds, by reason of some vein that
is cut, and that the Chirurgians would stop it, it were necessary to stitch it
well, but not as the common Chirurgians do, with wide stitches, but stitch it
very close and hard, and put therein our Quintessence, and upon the Wound strew
the blood of a man dried in powder, and lay upon the blood a cloth wet in our
Balm artificial very warm, and upon that bind the Wound with ligaments very
straight, and every day twice wash it with our Quintessence, and round about
anoint it with our Balm, and also cast thereon our secret powder for Wounds,
and that do morning and evening every day, without opening of the Wound, and
in that time the Wound will remain well, and the veins will be in a manner
healed so that they will not bleed, giving you charge, that the Wounded man
keep no diet, because the virtue being weak relaxeth the veins, and that
causes the flux of blood.

Another Remedy to stay the flux of blood in a Wound.
When there is a great flux of blood in a Wound, the perfectest remedy is to
stitch it very close, then take man's blood being dried, and made into powder,
and cast it upon the Wound, and bind it somewhat straight, and so let it remain
four and twenty hours, and when ye unbind it, take heed that ye remove
nothing, and cast on more dried blood upon the Wound, anoint it round about
with our Oleum Philosophorum de Turpentina and Cera, and bind it up again other
four and twenty hours, and then bind it gently, and anoint the Wound with Oil
of Frankincense, and so in short time it will be whole, giving thee great
charge, that ye put in no tent or such like, and then thou shall see miracles.

Of our Cerot Magno, that helps against all sorts of Sores and Wounds.
THis Cerot is of great virtue, and heals all manner of Sores and Wounds, if
it be spread on a cloth and laid thereon, and the order to make it is thus.

. Galbanum. i. Ammoniacum. ii. Oppoponax. ii. Aristolochia longa. i. new Wax.
xviii. fine Mirrh, Olibanum, Verdiguieco, ana. i. Bdellium. ii. Gum of the
Proin tree. ii. Lapis h^matites. ii. Turpentine, Frankincense, of each. iiii.
Oil of Wax. iii. Beat all those that are to be beaten, and searce them finely,
and keep every one by himself, then dissolve the Gums in distilled Vinegar,
according to Art, and then vapor away the Vinegar again, and strain the gums
through a cloth, then take the Wax with as much sweet oil and melt them on the
fire, and when they are melted, put thereunto. ii. of Litarge of gold finely
searced, and stir them continually until it be boiled, the which ye shall know
by this token. Put a feather therein, and if it be boiled enough, it will burn
straightwaies, or else let it boil until it burn it, then take it from the
fire, and cool it a little, and then put in the gums and stir them well
together, and set it on the fire again, and it will rise with a great noise,
and therefore let it boil until it do fall down again, then take it from the
fire, and put thereunto all the aforesaid powders, and stir it until it be
cold, and therewith thou shall work mavelous cures, if it be made well,
according to Art.

Of our Magistrall Unguent that helps diverse sorts of Sores.
THis Unguent is appropriate for many kind of sores, because it comfort the
sore, and takes away the pain, and draws the matter from the lower parts or
bottom of the sore, the which matter is cause of the pain: It keeps also from
accidents, giving you charge that it be made artificially, for otherwise it
will not be of so much virtue, and this is the Unguent.

. Litarge of Gold, four ounces, Oil of Roses, two pound; boil them in a Copper
pan so long, as if ye put a feather therein, it will burn it, then it is sod,
then put thereto of new Wax,. vi. Storax liquida, two ounces, common Honey,
three ounces, then let it boil awhile until they be well incorporated, then
take it from the fire, and put thereto Olibanum, Myrrha, Mercury Precipitate,
Oil of Wax, Oil of Turpentine, Oil of Frankincense, of each two ounces, mix
them well till they be incorporated, then put thereto pure rectified Aqua
vita,. iiii. and mix them well, and then it is ended; and this is of my
invention, wherewith I have done very strange cures.

To make Oil of Frankincense.
TAke a Retort of glass well luted, and fill it half sull of Frankincense, and
for every pound of Frankincense, put thereunto. iii. of common Ashes finely
searced, then distill it in sand, and the first that comes forth will be
water, the which will be clear, then increase the fire, and there will come
forth an oil of the color of a Rubie, the which keep close in a glass, the
first water is of mavelous virtue in diverse operations, but one miraculous
experiment I will not leave to write of, because it is a thing very necessary,
and it is this. For those that have chilblains, or kibes, or chops in the hands
or feet that comes through cold, ye shall first perfume the parts that are
sore over the fume of hot water, so that they may sweat, then dry them and wash
them with the aforesaid water, and put on a pair of gloves, and in short time
they shall be whole, it helps also the white scall and scabs, and such like
things. The Oil serves in many operations, and specially in all cold
diseases; if they be inwardly, give thereof every morning one scruple to
drink, and if they be outward anoint. Also it helps all manner of wounds be
they never so great: If ye anoint them therewith, and keep them close from
the air.

And in any wise use no tenting to keep them open, but wet a cloth therein, and
lay it thereon, and in short space they will be healed, also it dissolveth a
bruise in short space if ye anoint it often therewith, this oil serves also
for Painters to make Varnish.

Of Oil of Wax, and his Effect.
THis Oil of Wax is mavelous excellent, for so much as it serves for the
most part against all diseases; which Oil Raymond Lulli does approve to be a
more heavenly and divine Medicine then humane, and is most rare for wounds, but
it is not good for common Chirurgians, because it helps a great wound in ten
or twelve days at the most, but as for small wounds, it heals them in three
or four days, anointing only the wound therewith, and lay thereon clothes
wet in the same. Also this oil works miracles against diverse diseases
inwardly, if ye give thereof one dram with white wine, and as for those
whose hair and beard do fall away, it is a rare thing and of great profit, and
the order to make it is thus.

. A retort of glass well luted, and put therein what quantity of Wax you will,
so that it be not half full, and for every pound of Wax, put thereunto four
ounces of the powder of Bricks, then set it in a furnace, and give it gentle
fire until all the substance be come forth, the which oil will be congealed
hard, the which is his perfection, for if you will distill it so many times
that it congeal no more, it will be too hot and sharp, and not to be used
within the body in any wise, but the first distillation you may use safely
inwardly, and make Unctions for any kind of disease where need shall require,
and always it will be good, and do no hurt in any wise in any disease, and
therefore this Oil ought to be had in great regard of all men.

To help the Toothache, that is caused of rotten teeth, or that comes of a
descention of the Head.
THe teeth being rotten or corrupted always causes great pain, and many times
it comes of a descention from the head and such like humors, as Catarrs,
Erisipella, but let it come of what cause it will, I will show a remedy of
great importance, and it is very short, ye shall take our Aqua reale, and hold
it in your mouth a good while, and then spit it out again, and this ye shall
do for three days together every day once, then afterward it were necessary
to wash your mouth in like manner with our Aqua balsami for the space of a
month, and so the toothache shall be taken away with ease, for this is our
Secret, and may be used in all times of the year.

Against a stinking Breath.
THe Breath may stink through many causes, as by Ulcers in the mouth, or by
corrupt and rotten teeth, and sometime it comes of the stomach, and that is
evil to be helped, and therefore if thou will help these, thou must use diverse
Remedies, and first to help those that have their mouths ulcerated, ye shall
give them a quantity of our Pillele aquilone, and then let them wash their
mouths with our Aqua reale, and so the Ulcers shall be helped, and the mouth
shall not stink. But when the stench comes of rotten teeth, use the aforesaid
remedy or Medicine that is written for the toothache, the which will make the
teeth as white as snow, and will ache no more, but when the stink comes from
the stomach, it were necessary to purge the body with our Sirrup Sclutivo, six
or seven days, and then to take our Aromatico, that being done, take rectified
Aqua vitae, and the water of Honey, and oil of Turpentine, of each alike, mix
them well together, and every morning drink thereof. ss. fasting, for the
space of of a month or thereabout.

To help all such persons that have a great Cough in the Stomach.
THe Cough does come of diverse and sundry causes, but let it come of what cause
it will, it always offends the stomach and the head, for always when the
stomach is offended, of necessity the head is offended, because it has
communication with the Stomach, so that the Stomach ^^ cause of the pains in
the head, and therefore it is necessary to help the stomach first, and that
thou shall do with our Pillole aquilone, the which is written in this Book
following, and if so be you cannot take Pills, take our Aromatico, this being
done, if there be no Fever, give him every morning,. i. of our Electuarie
Magistrale per la toss, and every night anoint his stomach with Magno
liquore, and also his head and nosthrils, but if it happen that the aforesaid
things help it not, then take the blood of the Liver-vein, and purge the body
with our Sirrup against the melancholy humor, and so by the grace of God they
shall remain healed.

To help those that cannot hold their water.
THis proceeds of two causes principally, the first is, of superfluous heat
of the body, through the which heat, nature does assubtiliate too much that
humid part, and continually does send it down into the Bladder. The second
cause is, that the pores are too much relaxed or opened, by the which operation
the Urine does pass without retention, and these are the two causes why the
Urine cannot stay, and this comes commonly to young children, because they are
very hot of complexion, and the order to help them, is this.

Give them our Pillole Aquilone three times, the quantity is from. i. to one
and a half; that being done, ye shall make them a decoction of Hysope of the
mountain, and put therein Sugar, and this they shall use ten or twelve days at
the least, for this mundifieth the place offended, and disposes it to
solution. Then after this is done, ye shall give him for ten days together
half a dram of Mastick, with a little Plantain water, for this is hot and
restringeth the pores, and ingrosseth the Urine, and so the Patient shall
remain whole of that infirmity, by the virtue of the aforesaid three
Medicines, and it is a very easy cure, and sovereign for that purpose. But
sometime there happens a Flux of Urine somewhat like this, and it is not of
the aforesaid causes, but of causes much different from them,, for this is in
men and women of age, and thi^ I find to be caused of the Pox that causes the
Flux, and they void certain threads which some call G^norea, and the remedy
thereof is only with great purging and sweating, and then to anoint them five
or six nights with our Vrguento magno, and keep them warm in bed until ye have
ended to anoint him, and then go to the stow, and he shall be helped of that
infirmity.

To help those that cannot make water.
THe Urine is staid through diverse and sundry causes, and the principal are
three, of the which one is the Stone that ingendereth in the Bladder, for
always it hangs down in the neck of the Bladder, and stops the Meatus, or
pores that the Urine cannot pass, the which grieveth the Patient marvellously.
The other is caused of gravel, or gross and viscous humors that cannot pass
the pores, and so cause that retention of Urine with great pain. The third is
caused of an obstruction or restriction of the pores or conduits, where the
Urine does pass, and so keeps the Urine within with great pain, so that
these be the three chiefest causes of the retention of Urine

The cure of the first cause which is the Stone, is to purge them well, and
then to use our most sovereign Remedy that is written in this Book following,
the which is of great virtue to break the Stone, as I have proved many times,
but when this Medicine is not able to break it, then it is necessary to cut it
forth, and this is all concerning the first cause.

To help the second cause, it were necessary to use Purgations that purge the
Reins well, and then to give them our Aromatico, and then to anoint the Reins
six days every day once with Vnguento magno, and with this Medicine thou shall
help him perfectly.

To cure the third cause it were necessary to purge with aperative things, and
then to anoint his Reins, and under the members and belly with our Balm
artificial, and give him to drink the powder of Hoglice, or Centum pedes,
that are found under stones, and by the grace of God he shall be perfectly
whole.

To help those that have great burning of their Urine.
THe burning of the Urine may come of diverse and sundry causes, but I find four
principal, of which one is the Stone in the Bladder being great or small. The
second cause is a certain heat, the which corrupts the place where it passes
and carries forth, as it were, certain long threads, the which causes that
burning. The third cause is a certain viscousnesse, the which holds to the
bottom of the Urinall, and it will not well break, and this is called
Gonorrea. The fourth cause is certain fluxes of Urine caused of some kind of
the Pox, as ye may see by those that use company with evil women, and take
harm, for presently this burning comes, and therefore this shows me plainly,
that it is the Pox that causes the burning of Urine.

But if thou will help the aforesaid four causes, thou may do it with ease
having the true Art of a good Physician, and the remedy of the first cause
coming of the Stone, is to take it forth of the Bladder.

The second cause is to be helped with purging with our Sirrupo Solutivo, and
then after that, to use our oil of Vitriall compound, taking thereof every
morning,. i. and so they shall remain helped.

The third cause is helped with taking every ^en days a quantity of our
Aromatico, and so with this only Remedy they shall be helped.

The fourth cause is helped with Medicines appropriate for the Pox, and to
anoint them with Vnguento magno.

To help those that have great pain of the Gout.
THe Gout is a corrupt and malign infirmity, and properly ingendered of
corruption, as it is plainly seen in those that are troubled therewith, and to
prove it to be true, Nature does show it well, because you may see how great
the alteration is of that accident, and seeing that humor is caused of a
windy humor, and alteration of the blood, as is seen by experience, I believe
the same disposition has his original and beginning of the stomach, for so
much as all those that are troubled with that disease, the first sign that
appears unto them, is a great pain in the Stomach, three or four days or
more before the grief comes, and then the pain increases exceedingly, so that
by the said sign, I judge this accident cannot proceed of other place then the
stomach, and to affirm it better, ye shall understand, that those which are
troubled therewith can find no better remedy then to evacuate the stomach from
all corruption, and therefore if thou will help them of that accident, the
first thing that ye shall do is, to give them a quantity of our Aromatico in
the morning fasting, and drink thereon a little white Wine, that being done, it
would be necessary to make a fomentation with Nettles that be well boiled in
water, and then to anoint them with our Balsamo artificiato, and so for that
time the Gout will be gone, and will remain away for a long time.

But if God permit me life, I will hereafter set forth the order to help the
Gout that it shall never come again, with a certain order to be observed in the
same, found out by this Author, and has been proved an infinite number of
times in diverse places, and on diverse noble men, as ye may well understand in
his Thesauro della vita humana.

A remedy against the Pestilence, that preserves those that use it.
THe Pestilence is a certain corrupt humor, which is the cause of the evil
disposition of the air that is corrupted and poisoned, and it is so contagious,
that in six and thirty hours it corrupts the body, and causes them to dye,
and therefore if any will defend them from that infection, they may do it by
the help of God and the Physician with these Medicines; the first thing is to
confess our selves unto Almighty God, and to pray heartily unto him, and then
as concerning Physical Medicines, three things are to be used, which may save
the lives of many: The first thing is to evacuate the stomach, the second to
sweat, the third unction. And touching the first, ye shall use every three
days our Pillo^e Aquilone, for they evacuate the contagiousnesse, and will not
let it corrupt the body. For the second, ye shall cable them to sweat by
artificial means, for that evacuateth a certain matter very apt to corrupt.
And the third is, to anoint all the body with our Balm artificial, for that
preserves the body, and defends it from the contagiousnesse, so that by
these three means men and women may be preserved from that violent death.

To help Pellaria, that is a disease which causes the hair and beard to fall
away,
THis Pellaria is a certain kind of fantastical infirmity, of the which we by
practice do know the cause, which is by using company with women corrupted
with the Pox, and by the same practice we see, that those whose hair do fall
away, do fall into great infirmities of the Pox, although not all, yet the
most part, and therefore if thou will help that accident, it were necessary to
purge them with our Sirrupo Solutivo eight or ten days together, that being
done, give them our Arcmatico, and then anoint the place where the hair is
fallen away every evening with our Balm artificial, so that with the use of
these three Medicines the Patient shall remain perfectly whole of that matter,
because the Sirrup purges the whole body universally, and the Aromatico
purges the stomach and the head, and the Balm comfort and defends the
place where the hair is fallen, so that it shall fall no more, for this I have
proved an infinite of times. You shall understand, that there be two other
kinds of Pellaria, the which will not be helped in the aforesaid order, for the
one comes of a great fear, and the other comes because they have had Mal di
Massuca, and their heads be corrupted by that means, and for these two I know
no remedy, but to let nature have her course.

To help a Carnositie in the Yeard.
THe Carnositie that comes in the Yeard hinders the Urine so that it cannot
pass, and grows in the mouth of the bladder, and is a kind of matter
ingendered in that place, the which is much like unto an Emerode that comes in
the neck of the intestine about the fundament, and because it is a gross and
ulcerated matter, the urine passes with difficulty and great burning, the
which is very painful unto those that have it, but if thou will help that
inconvenience, it were necessary to purge the body well, and to keep a diet,
and to drink the Decoction of Hypericon made with Honey, and use to eat dry
meats as much as is possible, and then make certain little wax Candles of Wax
and Frankincense, and then make this Unguent.

. Red Lead. i. white Honey. i. Butter. ii. white Wine as much as will suffice to
incorporate them in a liquid form on a soft fire, and then take ten quills that
has blood in them, out of the wing of a young Pigeon that is fat, and
therewith stir the Unguent when it boileth, and when one quill is dried take
another, and so change them until the Wine be consumed, and then it is made,
and when thou will occupy it, take one of the said Candles of wax, and upon
the end put of this Unguent, and put it into the Yeard until it touch the
Carnositie, and this thou shall use day by day, until the Candell pass
without any impediment, and then the Patient shall be helped, for this is most
true, and I have proved it an infinite of times, to my great credit, and
content of the Patient.

To help the white Scall.
THis disease being so odious is a corrupt humor, which is not only in the
head as many do think, but it depends of the inward parts, and has
communication with the head, and this humor is like unto the Fume, for
continually it vapoureth up, and when it can ascend no more because it is
hindered in the skin, then it settleth, and ingrosseth, and causes the head to
break forth in that grievous order as is seen. But I will show a secret to help
it, so that it shall never come again, and the order to make it is thus. You
shall give them our Sirrupo Solutivo eight or ten days together, that being
done, give them our Pillole Aquilone three times, the which pills must be taken
every three days once, that being done, take Sinaber finely beaten. ii.
Olibanum, Mirrha, ana.. i. mix them together, and divide it into ^ive parts,
and make thereof five perfumes in five mornings, and cover their heads with a
cloth, so that it touch not the head, then let the powder be cast on by little
and little until it be spent, upon a chafingdish of coals, and so let them
stand covered one hour without moving, and this do every one of the times,
that being done, anoint the head for the space of a month with Oil of Wax,
and Turpentine, and they shall be helped, for this is a remedy that cannot
fail, for I have proved it an infinite of times, in Palermo, in Mesina, in
Naples, in Rome, and in Venice, and always I have had good success, to my
great credit, and profit of the diseased person.

To help those Carvoli that come upon the Yeard, and their causes.
THose Carvoli that come upon the Yeard are of diverse kinds, as by reason and
experience thou may see, but the most part are taken by using the company of
lewd and corrupt women infected with the Pox, and those are the worst kind, for
they are the first original of the Pox, and of those Carvoli come, Pannochi,
or Botches, and certain great Scabs, Pellaria, Aches, and Tumors, and an
infinite of other evil effects, and these are the first kind. There are
another kind, which commonly come of their own accord by reason of heat, and
those are easy to be helped, and are not perilous or painful. There is
another kind, the which is as though it were scorched or burnt, the which
comes through debility of the Yeard, and having company with women, and these
are also of small importance.

The first kind are certain Ulcers that come upon the end, and some upon the
proper substance of the Yeard, and some upon the skin, and the order to cure
them is thus. Ye shall mortify them within and without with our Caustic and
when they are mortified ye shall dress them with our Magno liquore, and they
shall be whole quickly.

But ye shall well note, that many times after they are healed before fifteen
days do pass, there will come a certain alteration in the throat, so that
they can scarce swallow their meat, and this alteration many times endures
eight or ten days, and then it resolves by it self, and that is a certain
sign of Pe^aria.

And therefore if thou will avoid that inconvenience that the hair fall not
off, as soon as ye feel any of the aforesaid griefs, then presently take a
quantity of our Electuario Angelica, and then take our Sirrupo Magistrale,
four or five days, and anoint thy head ten or twelve days with our Magno
liquore, and so by these means the hair shall not fall. Because our Electuario
Ang^lica, does evacuate the stomach, and cleanses the head, and dries up the
matter, the which is already alterated by that disease. Also our Sirrupo
magistrale, does evacuate the body, and purify the blood, and s^aketh the fury
of the disease. Our Magno liquore preserves the hair from drying and falling.

There comes many times, after those Carvoli are healed, certain Imposthumes
in the groin, of the which we will speak in another Book particularly. The
other kind of Carvoli that come upon the Yeard, are helped only by washing
them with some ^ath, that is restrictive and comfortative. The other kind which
are like scorching or burning, are helped by keeping them clean, and anointing
them with a Liniment of Tutia camphorata.

And thus I make an end, giving to understand to those that practice, how that
they may avoid that disease called Pellaria, or falling of the hair or beard,
for this is one of my Secrets, whereof I mean to write a great number, if God
permit me.

A Discourse of those Sores that come of the Pox, and how to help them quickly.
THe Pox, as I have written of diverse times, being a putrified and corrupt
disease, the sores coming thereof of force must be of his nature, that is
corrupt and stinking, therefore if thou will help them, and take away their
pain quickly, thou shall use three operations, the first is to give them our
Pillole Aquilone, and then to wash the sore with oil of Sulphur, and then lay
thereon our Cerot magistrale, with Precipitate, and anoint it with Magno
liquore, and therewith thou shall help them quickly, because those Pills are
appropriate for that disease, and the oil of Sulphur draws forth the filth
from the Center, and the Precipitate draws forth the gross matter, so that
of force it must heal.

The cure of one that had the Pox in his head.
BEing in Naples, among all other that I cured, there came unto me a Spaniard
called, Il Siegnior Diego di Menas, a man of the age of 36 years, of complexion
choleric adust, the which had the Pox, and in his forehead he had a certain
tumor, the which had perished a great part of the skull, and was open, and he
had been taken in hand of diverse men, and none could do him good: I seeing
that took him in hand, and gave him our Sirrupo solutivo eight or nine days
together, afterward I gave him our Aromatico, and then gave him the roots of
Cina in decoction, and then perfumed him with Olibanum, Mastick, Myrrha, and
Sinaber, and so by these means he was helped of that infirmity, but the bone
remained bare, and I laid thereon our Cerot Magistrale, and so in short time,
the bone did separate of his own accord, and one day I took it off altogether,
it was so great, that it covered the fourth part of the head, then presently
this Seignior Diego went abroad, showing what was taken from his head, as
diverse can testify.

The cure of a Wound in the Head, and in the Hand.
THere was a certain Gentleman called Gionan Jacobo Veniciane, the which had a
great Wound one the head, and in one of his hands, the which being taken in
hand of diverse Chirurgians, was brought to a very evil case by reason of great
alteration in the Wounds; and the Physician that had him in hand, was one
called Realdo Polumbo cremense, the which dressed his head with Wine and Oil,
and the hand with Turpentine and Oil of Roses. Than I being in company told
him, that it were good to change those Medicines, because in wounds of the
head, those Medicines were not convenient, for the oil being crude,
putrifieth, and the Wine is repercussive* and will not suffer the Putrefaction
to come forth that the oil ingendereth, and for that reason the said Medicine
would not be used.

And as for the Medicine for his hand, I say that the Turpentine is not
convenient, for where there is offense of skin, veins, sinnews, and bones,
Turpentine is not good, because it is hot and putrefactive, by means of the
Oil, and causes inflammation, and therefore it ought not to be used.

Put if thou will help the head and hand both, ye shall use a kind of Medicine
that comfort the place offended, and that does assubtiliate the matter, and
incarnate, to the which the said Realdo answered and said my reason was good,
if I could find Remedies that will do that Effect, the which I sent for to my
house, and used them in this order.

First, I did put our Quintessence into his wound in the head being cold, and
then a little of our Balsamo cold, the which seemed strange to Realdo, and then
I laid thereon our Magno liquore, and upon the cloth I laid a little of our
secret Powder, and the like I did to the hand, and so in fourteen days the
wounds were whole, to the great marvel of a number.

A great Secret particular for the Flux, and Dissenteria.
THe Fluxes of the body are no other but a distemperance of Nature, and are of
two kinds, the one is caused of an evil quality and distemperance of the
Liver, and that is called Flusso Epatico. The other is caused of great heat,
Fever, and distemperament of Nature, and this is called Dissenteria, that is a
distemperament of the guts, and both these sorts are hard to be helped of the
ancient Doctors, as it is well seen by experience of those that practice, for
they will help them with repression and restrictives, but that is not the way
if we shall believe Galen, the which writes, Fluxus Fluxum curat, the which is
most true, for I have cured a thousand of the Flux with giving them our
Aromatico, and three or four doses of our Si^^^o solutivo, therefore Galen
says true.

But the Dissenteria is cured with giving them our Electuario Angelica, and
then every day after dinner stand in a bath of water of the Sea cold two hours
at the least, and so in this order thou shall help any crude kind of
Dissenteria in short time, and with great ease, use this as a Secret.

The cure of one that was poisoned with Arsenick.
THere was a certain man poisoned with Arsenick given him in a mess of
Rice-pottage in an evening at supper, and as soon as it was in his stomach, he
began to groan, and sweat, and vomit, in such order as it was strange to see,
and it happened that at the said time there was a learned man in the house, who
seeing this man in that case, suspected him to be poisoned, and so sent for me,
and when I came, the poor man was almost dead, then presently I called the wife
of the house, and told her that her husband would die, and that she should have
the Law for poisoning of him, but if that she would tell him what poison she
had given him, perhaps he might recover him again, with many words more: so to
conclude she told him, that she had given him two grains of Arsenick in
Rice-pottage, then presently I called for a cup of Sack, and caused him to
drink, and then he vomited and went to the stool, and then I anointed him
with our oil of Hypericon, and Scorpions, all the body over, and still caused
him to drink that he might evacuate that poison, but all his mouth and throat
remained swollen, and he did spit great abundance, and I caused him to use that
Unguent, and every morning gave him Triacle with Wine, and every three days, I
gave him a quantity of Pillule Aggregative, and last of all I caused him to
use Aqua vitae compound, and so ere forty days he was perfectly whole, and
rid of a terrible disease, the which he had before he was poisoned.

The cure of an Vlcerated Leg.
THere was a certain man of the age of six and thirty years, of complexion
choleric and sanguine, the which had his left leg all ulcerated, in such order
that the Physicians and Chirurgians of the City would have cut it off, but in
any wise I would not consent thereunto, but took it in hand, and gave him first
our Magistrall Sirrup in the morning eight or nine days together, and in the
mean time I washed the leg with Wine wherein was boiled Mallows, Consolida
majore, Carduus benedictus, and Honey, and then wet clothes therein, and laid
them on twice a day, then I caused him to use a decoction of Lignum vitae, and
the bark with Iva artetica, Carduus benedictus, Pollipodie, Ripontico, Wine and
Sugar, and his common drink was wine and water boiled on the Fesses of the
same, and this he used four and twenty days, then I perfumed him with Cinaber
three times, and ere three months were past, he was perfectly whole, for his
disease came of the Pox, and those sores are commonly called Mal di formica.

The Cure of the Gout on a certain Gentleman.
IN the aforesaid year, in the month of August, I was called to visit a noble
Gentleman called, Il seignior Don Christ of alo, della roca, a man of five and
thirty years, of complexion choleric, and sanguine, the which was sore
troubled with the Gout, and because it was in the beginning of August, our
ancient Doctors have forbidden to take any soluble Medicine in that time, in
respect of the Canicular days. Nevertheless, I called Armellio, and Leonardo
Testa, two excellent Physicians, the which gave their counsel to take no
Medicine, nevertheless I proved that the Gout was extreme hot, and for that I
ordained a cold Sirrup to mittigate the superfluous heat, the which was made of
Liverwort, Hart's-tongue, Dates, Raisins, Figs, Sugar, and Succorie water, and
aromatised it with Musk and Rosewater, of the which he took every day four
ounces, and for the alteration of the Gout, I washed it three or four times a
day with our Aqua del Balsamo, because it penetrateth and opens the pores,
and assubtiliateth and dry-the humor offensive: also I ordained him bread of
Barley, because it cools the blood, and is of good digestion, and caused him
to refrain from all fat Brothes, and his drink was temperate, and to this one
of the Doctors did agree, but the other would not, nevertheless the Gentleman
was content with my advice, then I began to give him the aforesaid decoction,
with our Soluble Quintessence, and therewith he had every day two or three
Stools, and I washed the Gout three or four times a day with our Aqua Balsami,
and the first day he began to feel ease, and the second he felt more, so that
in seven days all his pains were taken away, and then I applied thereunto our
Secret of Secrets for that kind of disease, the which in three days delivered
him; then I caused him to use certain Medicines to defend the Gout from coming
again, and so he continued whole to his great satisfaction.

Of the causes of the Scyatica, and how ye may help it.
THe Sciatica is a disease so called, because it comes in that place of the
body called Sio, and is caused of an evil quality, and gross humors that
are staid in that place, because they cannot pass down, and this is seen by
experience daily, for where that pain is, there is alteration, and the cure
thereof is with Glisters, Vomits, Purgations, and Unctions, because the Glister
does evacuate those places next unto it, and so eases the humor, the vomit
cleanses the Stomach, the Purgations do evacuate the body downwards, the
Unctions dissolve the Wind, and so by these means thou may help the
Sciatica, as I have done many times to my great honor, and satisfaction of the
Patient.

A most excellent remedy to help the flux of the body, with a certain
discourse thereon.
IF thou will help the flux of the body, it were necessary to know first from
whence it proceeds, for he that knows not the cause, is less to be
credited to cure the effect, and therefore I will show thee what the Flux is,
and from whence it comes, and then I will show the order to cure it, and also
to make the Medicines.

The Flux of the body is caused of a superfluous heat conceived in the stomach,
the which make a continual solution inwardly, as ye may see by experience of
those that are troubled therewith, for so long as the cause is not taken away,
all their meat does turn into that matter, the which if it be so, that is true
which I do say, that the Fluxes are a distemperance of the body, caused of hot
and corrupt humors in the stomach, and therefore if thou will cure it, it were
necessary to extinguish the heat, and to take away the corruption, the which
thou shall do with the redness of Mart Militare written in this book
following; for that is the most sovereign remedy that can be found But first
ye shall take twelve grains of our Petra Philosophale, with. ss. of Mel
Rosar^m, and then take for four mornings together one scruple of the redness
of Mart, with. ss. of Sugar Rosat, and therewith thou shall work miracles.

A discourse as concerning Corns in the feet or elsewhere, with their remedies.
THis callous matter is a certain hot humor, of the which Nature would
discharge her self, and when that humor is driven forth of Nature, it goes
unto the lower parts into the end of the Toes, for in that extreme part of the
toes, that skin that is called Epiderma, is hard, and will not suffer it to
pass or exalate, and there many times it ingendereth a tumor in the skin with
great hardness, and many times that tumor does increase and cause such pain,
that it does not only hinder their going, but hinders them from sleep in the
night, and this kind of tumor is called commonly Callo, or Corns in English,
and I thought it good to call them Creste, because they are always growing,
and are of great importance among the Chirurgians, for an infinite number of
persons are troubled therewith, and therefore I will show thee our secret to
help them quickly, and with great ease; which secret was never known before of
any. First ye shall pare them with a sharp knife unto the bottom, and there
ye shall find a certain thing like matter, but if ye find no matter, ye
shall pare it until the blood does appear, then touch it once with Oil of
Sulphur, and then dress it with our Balsamo artificiato once a day until it
be whole. Keep this as a secret.

Of an Infirmity of Importance, that comes upon the extremity of the toe upon
the nail.
THere are many men that are troubled with a certain infirmity under the nail
of their great toe, the which seems as though that the nail grew in the
flesh, which is not so, but the flesh grows over the nail, and although this
seems to be a thing of nothing, and that the Ancients have had small
consideration thereof: Nevertheless, it is an infirmity of great importance,
and to be considered of, because many are troubled therewith, and especially
men of authority, and especially those that are troubled with the Gout. I call
to remembrance, that in the time that I was in Naples, I cured a great number,
and especially those that were of great authority, to my great honor and
profit. The first thing that I did, I cut the nail on the part which was
grieved and took it away, the which was done easily and with little pain, which
thing being done, I touched it with our Caustic, and so let it remain three
days together, and then I dressed it every day with our Magno liquore until
it was whole, which was in short time.

A discourse upon the Emeroids, with the order to cure them with most excellent
Medicines of our invention.
THe Emeroids are a certain kind of evil tumor, caused of the blood in the
veins ^merodiall, and these come always in the extremity of the Intestinals
about the Fundament, and some of them cause great pain, and some of them do
burn excessively, or do scald; the which comes through the quality of the
good and evil humors, as ye may see by experience, how that some have such
burning that they cannot rest in the night, the other have such pain that they
cannot sit, the other are so scalded that they cannot abide it, ye shall
understand, that this infirmity is more painful in one complexion then in
another, and the cure thereof is difficile Nevertheless it may be cured, and
the order is this.

First take our Aromatico, then take our Sirrupo Solutivo three or four days,
then take our perfume three or four times on the Fundament, that being done,
anoint the place with our Balm artificial, for that dries and takes away
the pain altogether, and so the Patient shall remain perfect whole.

There is also a great secret in the tooth of a Horse-fish, if it be worn on a
man's finger, to take away the Emeroids, the which tooth I have known proved at
the least seven or eight times, for I have a ring made thereof, and have used
it.

A great secret to help those that are burst, or have the Rupture.
THis is a rare secret, never known before of any man, and especially for those
that have not been burst long time, and that the Rupture has not yet made a
Callow, and the order to cure it is thus.

First ye shall give them our Aromatico every ten days once, and every
morning fasting give them one ounce of fine Tartar beaten into powder, with
water or wine to drink, and likewise in the evening, two hours before supper
give him as much, and his bread shall be Biscuit made of Rye, also he must wear
a Trusse made fit for that purpose, and use this remedy.

. Rectified Aqua vitae without phlegm. xii. Rosin of the Pine tree that is dry,
Olibanum, Mastick Sarcocolla, ana.. ss. Mix them altogether, and with this
water wash the Rupture every day twice, and then cast thereon presently the
powder of a herb called Bislingua and Balsamina, ana. and then wet a cloth in
the said water, and lay it thereon, and bind the Trusse very hard, and keep thy
house with as much ease as thou may, and strain not thy self in any wise,
and thus within a hundred days thou shall help any great Rupture, keeping the
aforesaid order.

A rare secret and divine, to help those that are troubled with the Spleen.
THe Milt is alterated and becomes hard, by reason of a superfluous humidity,
which it receives by the evil disposition of the Liver and Lungs, and
therefore if thou will help it, it were necessary to use Medicines abstersive
and drying, and to give them our Aromatico once, and then to use this
Electuary, the which is of mavelous virtue in that operation.

. Squamma ferri. i. Scolopendria. i. Spicknard, Lapis Lazuli, ana. ii.
Cinnamon. ss. beat them fine, and make thereof an Electuary with purified Honey
according to art, and take thereof every morning a spoonful, and as much at
night two hours before supper, and anoint the place where the Milt lies with
our Balsamo artificiato, and so by the grace of God, and means of these
Medicines, thou shall be helped quickly.

A great secret to help the Spleen with great sppeed.
THe Milt, as is aforesaid, is grieved through abundance of humidity which it
receives, and therefore thou must only seek to dry that humidity, and for
that purpose I will show thee two great secrets wherewith thou shall work
miracles, and are of great reason and experience, The one is to be let blood
under the tongue in one of these two veins, that is on that side where the
Milt lies, that being done, ye shall take Mustard, and mix it with the Urine
of a Boy, and say it between two clothes, and lay it on the sore place one
night, and then if it be not well, use it still until it be helped, for this I
have proved an infinite of times.

The cure of a certain Spaniard called Carabasall di Cordonet, the which was
troubled with the Pox.
THis Soldier, being of the age of two and thirty years, was mightily
troubled with the Pox, with extreme pains and sores, among the which, he had
all his thigh so eaten away, as though he had been gnawn with Dogs, with most
extreme pain, and the way that I cured him was thus. I gave him twelve grains
of our Petra Philosophale, with Sugar Rosate, the which caused him to vomit and
to evacuate downward, of the which he found great case: that being done, I
prepared him our decoction of Lignum sanctum solutivum, the which is written of
hereafter, with a certain drink made with Wine, and Lignum vitae, and this he
used five and twenty days, and then I anointed him with our Vnguento magno,
and in the space of forty days he was perfectly helped to the sight of all men.

The cure of the Stitch in the side with retention of Urine.
THere was a certain Gentleman called, Marco di Chiuffunt of the age of six and
thirty years, the which was troubled with a terrible stitch in the side, and
had proved many Medicines, and none did him pleasure, the which, after I took
him in hand, I gave him our Aromatico, and after that the pain slacked, than I
caused him to anoint all those parts with the oil of Nutmegs, and the oil of
Eggs mixed together, and so he remained quite whole, for in this order I have
cured an infinite of persons to my great honor.

A cure of a certain Spaniard wounded in the head in Naples.
THere was a certain Spaniard called Zamora, of the age of four and thirty
years, of complexion choleric and sanguine, the which was wounded in the left
side of the head, with incision of the bone; also you shall understand, that in
Naples the air is most evil for wounds in the head, by reason that it is so
subtle, and for that cause the Doctors did fear the cure, nevertheless I
dressed him with our Magno liquore, and Balsamo artificiato, keeping the wound
as close as was possible, anointing it only upon the wound, and so in
fourteen days he was perfectly whole, to the great wonder of a number of
Chirurgians of that City.

The cure of a certain Gentleman that had Mal' di formica.
THere was a certain Gentleman Neopolitan, the which was called, Il Seignior
Giovan Francisco Gaetavo, of the age of thirty eight years, the which was
marvellously tormented with a sore arm, and a sore leg, called Mal' di formica,
and he was of complexion choleric and melancholy, and these sores went
creeping upon the flesh, healing in one place and breaking out in another, and
in his arm he had nine sores, and in the leg fourteen, and this Gentleman had
sought help the space of two years, and could find none, and had twice taken
the Diet, and yet could find no help, the which Gentleman I took in hand, and
the first thing that I gave him was this: i. of Hierapiera Galeni, with twenty
grains of our Petra Philosphale, the which provoked both vomit and seege diverse
times, that being done, I gave him our Sirrupo Solutivo 12. mornings together,
that being done, I gave him a Medicine with our Petra Philosophale and Eleborus
niger, the which caused him also to vomit and purge downwards, that being done,
I caused him to make a Sirrup of Lignum Sanctum, and the Bark, Iva Artetica,
and Carduus Benedictus, in the which I put seven pound of Wine, and one of
Sugar, and then I caused him to make a drink with water, and wine, and Honey,
to drink continually, and that I caused him to use five and twenty days, and
then I anointed him with our Vnguento magno five times without fire, the which
Unguent caused him to spit abundance of filthy matter, and at the last it
caused him for to spit blood, after the which I caused him to make a Bath the
which is written in our Regiment of the Pestilence, called the Joyful Jewel,
and I said on the Sores our Cerot Magistrale, and thus within thirty eight
days he was perfectly whole.

Certain Cures that this Author did when he traveled into Africa.
IN the year 1550 he traveled into Africa, and there he was chosen by Il. S.
Don Pietro di Toledo viceroi di Napoli, to be Physician unto the camp under Don
Gracia his son, and so in the year 1551. in the month of May he departed from
Naples with all the army of the Emperor, Carolo quinto D' Austria, and so
having a prosperous wind, arrived in Barbary by a certain old city called
Monasterio, and there gave an assiege, and took it without any remission or
ransoming, and made slaves of all those that were left alive, and it remained
utterly destroyed, but not without great mortality of our Christian Soldiers,
and beside those that were killed, there was a great number wounded, the which
were brought into the Galleys, and carried to the Isle of Sicilla, in a certain
city called Tarpano, the which say they, was builded by a great Idolater
called Tarpos, and there in the Hospital those wounded persons were left, with
certain Chirurgians that were under my jurisdiction, and with certain Medicines
of my invention, and so in short time the most part were helped, and then the
Army returned unto Naples again, and refreshed them with new men and victual.
And then on the fifteenth of June, we set up sail and failed, and when we were
in the midst of the gulf between Naples and Palermo, there happened a great
misfortune, the which was thus.

In the Gallie of Si. Giordano Captain General of the Galleys Duke of Florence,
it happened that he being at the table with diverse Captains and Gentlemen, and
as they were, at dinner, a certain Captain being grieved with another,
multiplied words, and took a loaf of bread, and threw it at his face, without
any reverence or respect of the said General Sig. Giordano. That being done,
the said General rose from the table, and took him by the bosom, and gave him
five stocadoes in the breast, the which pierced within the body, and there he
fell for dead: that being done, the said General repented himself of his
rashness, and presently sent for me being in the Gallie of Don Gracia to come
and dress him, and so my General caused me to do with all diligence, and
when I came, this poor Captain lay as though he had been dying, nevertheless I
dressed him with great diligence, and that Medicines which I used were these:
First, I put into the wounds, of our Qiuntessence, and upon the wound I dressed
it with our Balm artificial, and gave him a vomit, the which caused him to
cast great quantity of blood, and then every morning I gave him half an ounce
of our Aqua Balsami, and thus within two days after we arrived at Palermo, the
Captain was perfectly whole, to the great marvel of a number. After that we
departed from Palermo, and went to the City of Trapano, where the rest of the
galleys were, and there continued four days, and then on Saint John's even, we
went to an Island called Fanignana, and there kept the feast of Saint John, and
then we departed with all the army, and went on the side of Africa, and on
Saint Peter's day we landed in the Gardens of that City, and there began to
offer battle, and there remaining about 24. or 25. days, the army began to be
infected with a certain kind of flux, whereof a great number dyed every day. My
General seeing that called me, and asked if it were possible to find some
remedy for that flux, unto the which I answered willingly, and said, I would
devise by the help of God some remedy, because it was my duty, to labor for
the health of the Soldiers of the Emperor, the which thing I did in short
time through the whole camp; as I will write hereafter in the next chapter.

The cure of the Flux, wherewith I helped the Army of the Emperor in Africa.
BEing as I have said before in the camp, where they were marvellously
tormented with a Flux, and many died thereof, and could find no help, although
they had Medicines. Than I which had the experience in hand, began to laugh to
my self, and the remedy wherewith I helped them all, was this. First, I caused
them to eat well, and then in the morning I gave them a vomit, and then every
day after they had eaten, I caused them to go into the water of the Sea, and
there to reremain four or five hours, and so doing within four or five days
they were helped, for I swear as I am a Knight, that if I had not been there,
the whole Army had died of that Flux, for of fourteen or fifteen thousand that
were there, there was not left two thousand but they were infected with that
Flux, or distemperance of the Liver caused of superfluous heat, the which heat
distempereth the Stomach, and causes the continual Flux; you shall understand
that our vomit does evacuate the stomach of the putrefied humor, and the
salt water cools the heat, and restrains the Flux, so that by these means
they were helped.

A goodly Remedy found out by me for Wound in the head.
VVOunds in the head were very perilous in that place, so that if a hundred
were hurt in the head, it was not possible to recover ten, and that came
through two things, the which were much contrary in that Region, for the day
was so hot that it burned all things, and the night to the contrary so extreme
cold, that it was intolerable, and not to be credited, and so by this
distemperance, when the Craneum was uncovered that the air might touch it,
presently they died without any help, then I seeing that, began to consider of
the matter, desiring to find some mean to help them, and so studying, it came
in my memory, that the air was cause of their death, as it was in truth. Then
presently I commanded all those Chirurgians that were under my jurisdiction
that they should not meddle with any wound in the head without my presence, the
which thing was done, and as many as were wounded, the first thing that I did,
in stead of cutting or launcing or discovering, according to the common order,
I joined the parts, and sowed them close, and dressed them upon the wound with
our Quintessence, and with Balsamo, and Magno liquore, and so in short time the
most part were helped, and there died none so desperate as they did before, and
therefore to my judgment, this was a good invention, and never used of any
before, and this order of curing is very natural, for Nature does show it in
herbs, plants and stones, how that they cannot stand dis-united, then much
more our flesh cannot stand dis-united, without great torment of the Patient,
for until it be joined together again, it is unpossible to be helped, then
seeing that is true, it is most natural for the wound to be joined together,
and to use those Medicines, that where they be applied, will not suffer the
humor to come thereunto, nor putrify the place that is hurt, and seeing it is
so, as by experience is seen, we must believe this to be a natural and most
wholesome remedy, so that I affirm that the joining of the parts of the wound
in the head, and other parts of the body is most sovereign, and of great
satisfaction to the sick, for they never felt pain, nor have no Fever, nor
other sort of accident, for of those I have cured a great number with good
success.

The cure of one that had his nose cut off, and set on again.
IN that time when I was in Africa, there happened a strange and that was thus.

A certain Gentleman a Spaniard that was called Il Seignior Andreas Gutiero, of
the age of twenty nine years, upon a time walked in the field, and fell at
words with a Soldier, and began to draw, the Soldier seeing that, struck him
with the left hand, and cut of his nose, and there it fell down in the sand,
then I happened to stand by and took it up, and pissed thereon to wash away the
sand, and stitched it on again very close, and dressed it with our Balsamo
artificiato, and bound ^t up, and so let it remain eight days, thinking that
it would have come to matter: nevertheless, when I did unbind it. I found it
fast conglutinated, and then I dressed it only once more, and he was perfectly
whole, so that all Naples did marvel the real, as is well known, for the said
Sig. Andrea does live yet, and can testify the same.

The cure of an arm of S. Giordano Ursino.
AT the same time the said Sig. Giordano Vrsino, and Si. Antamo Savello Romano,
and Sig. Astor Baglione, with diverse others, took their Horses and rid about
two miles from the Camp, and there perceived certain Mores on horseback, the
which did assault these Gentlemen, and one More with his Lance did thrust
through the arm from the elbow through the shoulder, then the said Sig.
Giordino returned to the Camp with great pain, and presently I was sent for,
and when I had seen it, I put therein our Quintessence, and upon the Wound I
said our Balsamo, and Magno liquere, and bound it straight, and so left it, and
in five days it was whole and sound, and then went to the assault most
valiantly, as many can testify, because he was general of Firenze.

A great chance that happened in the assault in Africa.
AT the same time there was a Gentleman Florentine, that was with the said Si.
Giordano Vrsino, that was called Millematti, the which fought with his Sword
and Target, and defended many shot of Calivers, and such like, at the last one
peirced his Target, and struck him upon the breast, and bruised him
marvellously, and yet broke no skin, and therewithal he fell to the ground for
dead, and the carrier of dead men, or Becamort, as they call them, would have
buried him in a Mine, I then being present, caused him to be brought into the
Tent of Sig. Astor Baglione, and there I put our Quintessence into his mouth,
and that caused the blood to liquifie and come forth at the mouth, and laid
upon his stomach a plaster of Ashes and Oil as hot as he could abide, and that
I changed morning and evening, and always I gave him of our Quintessence to
drink, so that in short time he was helped, and yet lives in health: and this
was one of the most strangest things that ever I saw, that a pellet of a
Caliver could not break the flesh, and that came by certain words that the said
Millematti did carry written upon his breast, as he persuaded me afterward, for
he said, In verbis, and in herbis, and in lapidibus sunt virtutes, etc.

The cure of Wounds being poisoned, and of there Sores.
While that wars dured in Africa, many times the Chirstians were poisoned
with venomous Arrows and such like, for the Moors commonly when they fight
against the Christians, they stick the heads of their Arrows in a Squill, and
poison it with the juice, and when those Arrow heads or other weapon goes into
the flesh of a man, it causes so great burning, that it brings Spasmus, and
so in short time they dye. And until this time there has been no other
Medicine found, but to cut away all the flesh that the weapon has touched, or
else to cauterize it two or three times with a red hot Iron to extinguish the
venom, but I, through the grace of God, have found the true and perfect way to
help them quickly, and with great ease, and without detriment of the wounded,
and the remedy is this; ye shall put our Quintessence into the Wound, and lay
thereon our Magno liquore, the which are two Medicines that kill the poison of
the Squill, and therefore if any will prove this to be true, to see the
experience, take a piece of a Squilla, and scratch it with thy nail, and then
put thy finger into thy ear, or scratch any other place that ye may touch the
flesh, and presently thou shall feel a terrible burning, and to quench it,
presently take of our Quintessence, and wash the place therewith, and presently
the pain will cease, and therefore use this as a secret, for therewith I have
cured a great number.

A remedy found out by me against the poison of a Fish.
When that I caused so many sick of the Flux to go into the sea, whereby they
were helped, there was a certain kind of fish, that as soon as they touched the
flesh of a man, presently it inflamed, and the poison so increased, that in two
or three days it caused corrosive Sores, the which caused many to dye, and
many were stung with that fish which never could find help: I then seeing that
desperate case, upon a time visited a young man being a Roman, the which was
hurt on the Codds and Yeard with such a Spasmus, that it was wonderful to
behold, and having a glass full of my Quintessence in my hand, I opened the
sore and washed it therewith, and presently the pain ceased, then afterward I
dressed it with an Unguent made of the fat of the fish, and so therewith he and
a great number more were helped in short time, and these are secrets of my
invention.

Of the taking of Africa and his destruction
IN the year 1551. the eleventh of September about the nineteenth hour the
general assault was given to the City of Africa, and in the space of two hours
it was taken, and destroyed by the soldiers of Carolus Quintus Emperor,
whereat was slain a great number of both parts, and there was such a number
hurt, that it was to be wondered at, the which were healed with our Magno
liquore, and Balsamo, and when the City was taken and all ended, the Galleys
remained there all September, and the fourth of October every man went to serve
at their ports appointed, and so we returned to Naples to pass the winter, but
yet we remained but a while, for there was occasion to go to Siena, the which
rebelled against the Emperor, and so we went with Don Pietro da Toledo the
which died after at Firenza, etc.

The cure of a great wound on the head.
IN this year 1551. in the month of November, there came unto my house a
Spaniard, the which was called Giovan Ruiz di Zamora, the which had a great
wound over the ear, on the left side that reached half over the head, with
great fracture of the bone, the which I presently stitched with diligence, and
put therein our Quintessence, and upon the wound I dressed it with Magno
liquore, and Balsamo, and made a gentle ligature with a piece of silk, and
sent him home to his lodging, and commanded him to come again the next day
about the said hour, and those that were about me, fell a laughing at my
words, and said that he would die of that wound, because I let him go forth in
the air, to the which I answered that he might safely go forth, and so the
next day he came again, and I took off the ligament, but not the cloth, and
thereon I put of our Quintessence and Balm, and so in three days I touched it
not, and then I took off the Ligament again, and dressed it upon the cloth,
and let it remain until the 8. day, and then I opened it, and took away the
cloth, and found the wound so healed that ye could scarce perceive any
scarre, and many said that it was impossible to be healed, for it would come to
imposthumation, nevertheless it remained perfectly whole for five or six
months that he remained in that City, in the which time I cured a great
number in the same order that were wounded in the head, to the great wonder of
those that dwelt in Naples, for they count all wounds in the head to be
mortal, because the air is so pestilentiall-, for as soon as it touches the
scull it corrupts the wound.

But using our order thou may safely help them, so that the wound be not
mortal, for by keeping it close shut it is preserved.

A very strange thing that happened in the aforesaid year.
THere was a certain young Mariner of the age of 26* years, the which was
called, Francisco di Giovanni Raguseo, of the Isle of Mezo, the which being in
fight fell down, and the other that fought with him out him over the side and
back a handful long, in so much that a piece of the Milt was cut overthwart,
then he was carried to a Chyrurgian, and he stitched him up, then the next day
I was called, and there I found the Wound not well stitched, the which I ripped
up again, and found the belly full of blood, and when I saw that, I caused
diverse to make water, and therewith I washed him, and with taking forth of the
blood, there came a piece of the Milt that was cut, the which I washed, and
gave it to a Mariner that stood by, and the Patron of the ship took it from
him and carried it away, then I stitched him up again and left a little hole
or orifice beneath, where the matter might come forth, and dressed him with our
Quintessence, with Balsamo, and Magno liquore, and in the space of 22. days he
was whole perfectly.

The cure of a Fistula in the lower parts.
IN the year, 1552. in the month of March, I was brought unto a man of the
age of forty years, of complexion choleric and melancholy, the which had a
Fistula in the lower parts, the which was of this Nature, that it had alterated
the cods, the member, and all the parts thereabout, with eleven holes
infistulated, at the which holes he made water with great burning, and
intolerable pain, and which are accidents of a Fever in manner continual, the
which Patient had been taken in hand of diverse, and none could do him
pleasure. Then the first thing that I did, I gave him our Aromatico, that being
done, I gave him xii. days together our Quintessentia solutivo, that being
done, I gave him a quantity of our Electuario Angelica, and then he used one of
my secrets, the which I will not write in this place, that being done I caused
him to spit with one of my confections, written hereafter, and so by these
means he was perfectly whole.

Of many that I cured in Naples.
IN that time that I remained in the famous City of Naples, until the year
1555. in the Month of February, and then I thought it good to go to Rome,
where at this time I cured a number of persons, and have helped so many by the
help of God, which if I should record them, it would be sufficient to fill a
great volume, for there came such a number to my door, that the people wondered
thereat, and with four Medicines compounded by me, I helped in manner all of
every disease, and the Medicines were these, one Pill made with our Petra
philosophale, Elbero negro, Olio di sulpho, Olio di melle, mixed with
Marchpane, and made in Pills. The second Remedy was soluble Pills, made with Aloe
hepatico, Colloquintida, Siena, and oil of vitrioll made in pas^e with sugar,
and common honey. The third Remedy was an unction, made with Sage, Rosemary,
Wormwood, R^w, Mint, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, Mastick, Trankincense,
Turpentine and wax with common oil. The fourth Remedy was our Quintessence,
and these four Remedies, I gave unto those people to help their griefs: and I
willed them that took these Medicines to eat well, and of good meats, and so
always they praised these Medicines, the which was not without great reason,
because the Pills first evacuate the stomach of all Impediments, and leaves
nature eased, the second Pills evacuate the body of the corruption.

The unction comfort the stomach, and helps digestion, and mitigateth the
pain. The Quintessence comfort the stomach, causes good digestion,
purifieth the blood, and comfort the head, so that by these aforesaid
Reasons, ye may understand that these four Remedies may help against all
indispositions inwardly, and for cause of those Remedies those people honor me
like a Prophet, and always have had me in great Reverence, as long as I
remained among them.

A cure of Ulcera putrida which was in the arm.
IN the year aforesaid, and in the month of August, there came to my hand a
certain Gentleman of the Ambassadors of Portingall, that was called Il signior
Jari, a man of the age of two and thirty years, of complexion melancholy,
the which had a putrified Ulcer about the left shoulder, that he had carried
above three years, and was as big as a hand, and very deep, which could not be
healed of the common Chirurgians, nor yet be eased of his pain, then I
reasoning with this Gentleman, told him that the cause of that sore, was
corrupt and putrified blood, and by that means the Liver received evil
qualities, and that if he would be helped, the cause must be removed, the which
was hard to be done, because the blood must be evacuated a little, and then the
stomach must be evacuated of moist matter that offends it, and hinders
digestion of the meat, and will not suffer good blood to engender; then will it
also be necessary to evacuate the body downwards, that the corruption send not
up his vapors unto the upper parts of the body, and hinder the cure of the
Ulcer, all this being done, it were necessary to evacuate the humor between
the skin and the flesh by sweat, so that all the parts of the body may remain
purified, and so by these means the Ulcer may easily mundifie, incarnate, and
siccatrize, and shall be a perfect cure: to the which thing the Gentleman was
willing, for he had as willingly dyed as lived, and so in the name of God I
took him in hand, and the first thing that I gave him was a vomit that purged
the stomach, and took away great part of his pain: then I purged him with our
Quinta essentia solutivo eight days together, that being done, I made him a
Fomentation that caused him to sweat well, and to spit abundance, then I caused
him to be let blood under the tongue, and then I anointed all the Ulcer with
our Caustic, the which mortified all the filthiness therein, and then I
dressed it with Magno liquore, and our Cerot Magistrale, and so with these
Remedies in short space the said Gentleman was cured, to the great marvel of
the said Ambassador, and all those that saw it: By reason of that cure came
another of the same house unto me, called Il Seignor diego Iaimes, the which
was troubled with a difficulty of Urine, which did trouble him mightily, to
whom I gave three times our Petra Philosophale, and once the juice of Elder
Barks, and he was helped: I cured another in the same house of a Fever with our
Oil of Honey, and with Balsamo: The Ambassador likewise being troubled with
the Gout, willed me to take him in hand, the which I did, and cured him, so
that in three years after while I continued in Rome he never felt pain, and of
these cures I helped an infinite in Spain, as is well known to the Inhabitants
thereof.

The cure of Ethesia in the beginning.
IN the year 1555. in the Month of March, there came to my hands a young man
of Millayne, the which was a Painter, of the age of five and twenty years, the
which was fallen into a spice of Etisie, and did spit much blood with a
continual Fever, whom I cured in this order.

First, I let him blood under the tongue on the right side, and after that I
gave him a quantity of our Aromatico with Plantaine water, because the bleeding
takes away the superfluous blood of the breast, which nature sends forth by
it self, and the Aromatico with Plantaine water is cold and dry, which are
most necessary for that disease, for they evacuate the stomach, repercute and
mitigateth the alteration, those things being done, I caused him to use our
Quintessence solutive to evacuate the body in respect of the Putrefication
already conceived within the intestinals, also I caused him to use the
Quintessence of the Flower of Flowers, and I anointed his stomach with Magno
liquore, and also he used our Electuarie of Althea, and so by these means he
was helped perfectly.

The cure of a certain man wounded in thirteen places.
IT happened that a certain man called Alessandro Orefice, was wounded before
my lodging in thirteen places, and there fell for dead, and then by a certain
friend was brought into my Lodging, and there I laid him upon a Table, and took
off his clothes, and sowed all those wounds which were to be sowed or stitched,
and dressed him with our Quintessence, and Balsamo, and Magno liquore, and our
secret Powder, and so by those means in 15. days he was perfectly whole.

Of Remedies that help many diseases.
THere are diverse and sundry diseases, and they be helped with diverse and
sundry Medicines; therefore I will make a note only of those which are most
used.

And first I will write of those Remedies that help the Fevers of all sorts,
which are these, the Sirrup of Burrage, Bugloss, Endive, Cicory, Hops,
Fumitorie, Rhabarb, Cassia, Scamony, Sine, Barly-water, Sirrup of Scytrones,
and such like.

The Remedies that help the Pox are these, Aloes, Coloquintida, Turbit,
Hermodactils, Scamony, Precipitate, Oriola, Olivella, the Unction of Mercury,
Lignum sanctum, Cina, Salsa perilla, the perfume of Sinaber, a stove of herbs,
our Ceroto Magistrale, and such like things. Those Remedies that help the
Cough, are Enula Campana, Garlike, Sulphur, Honey, Lapaciolle, the Oil of
Sulphur, and such liket: Those Remedies that help the Scabs, are the juice of
Aureola, Sulphur, Litarge, Aqua Reale, Roch Allome, those that are troubled
with pains in the body, may use Genciane, Nutmegs, Dictamus albus, Euphorbio:
those that are wounded shall use Turpentine, our Balsamo, Magno liquore, Aqua
Balsami, Elixar vitae, Ceroto Magistrale, Oil of Hipericon, of our invention,
and such like. Those that provoke urine, are the flours of Mallows, Alkekengi,
Hogs life, Cantharides, and such like, and therefore I will not trouble you
further, because I have written sufficiently in my other Books in sundry
places, and hereafter I will write of diverse; and sundry Medicines of our
invention never found out before of any man.

Here begins the order to make diverse and sundry Medicines of our invention
never found out before by any man. And first to make our Petra Philosophale,
that helps against all manner of diseases that happens unto man, or woman,
or any other Animal terrestrial.
THere has always been a great questioning among the Philosophers, whether
that one Medicine might help against all diseases or no. The which I affirm,
and will approve with sufficient reason, that the Petra Philosophale made of
our invention may help against all the infirmities that comes unto man's body,
and two only reasons I will show thee with brevity, the first of them is this,
that all sorts of infirmities have their Original and beginning of the
stomach, and to know the truth, ye may see manifestly, that if the body be
never so little infirmed, the stomach is also greived: For ye may see how the
Animals terrestrial never help themselves of other infirmity then of the
stomach, and when they will help themselves, they eat herbs, the which causes
them to vomit, and this does signify, that they have no other infirmity then
the aforesaid, so by the experience of the Animals I approve that the infirmity
is caused of the stomach, and this is the first reason. The second is, that all
the Medicines, wherein our Petra Philosophale is put, as soon as they are come
into the stomach, it draws unto it all the evil humors of the stomach, and
also of the whole body, and mixeth with them, and so natrue sends them forth
by vomit, or by seege, or both, and so the stomach shall be evacuated of that
matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of infirmities, so that
by this reason I affirm, that our Petra Philosophale may help against all sorts
of infirmities, and to know the truth, I have proved it by experience in all
manner of infirmities, and always have found it to do much good unto all men,
and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make this Petra Philosophale
is thus.

. Sal niter, Roch Alum, Vitrioll Romain, of each two pound.

First, dry the Vitrioll in an earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and mix
it with the other matters, and put thereunto four ounces of Sal gemma, then
put it in a goord with his head, and a Receiver well luted, and distill it in a
wind Furnace, so that ye may make fire with wood, and at the first make small
fire, and so increase it according to Art, and always lay wet clothes an the
head and Receiver, and that thou shall do, because the spirits of the water
shall not fly away. Ye shall understand, that in the beginning of your
distillation, the Receiver will wax red like blood, and then turn white; and at
the last, when ye give it strong fire, it will turn red again, and those are
the pure spirits of the Aqua fortis, and then at the end, the Receiver will
turn white again, and then it is ended, then let it wax cold, and then keep
it in a Glass close shut to make our Petra Philosophale.

Then take Mercury, lib. 1. Quick-lyme,. vj. Soap,. iiij. Common ashes,. iij.

Mix them together in a Mortar of stone, and then put them into a Retort, and
distill it with a strong fire until all the Mercury be come forth into the
Receiver, then take it forth, and keep it in a Glass, to make thy
composition, the which is made thus.

. The water that thou made first, and put it into a goord of Glass being
well luted, and then put in thy Mercury that thou did distill before. After
that, take Steel in thin Plates, j.. Iron also in thin Plates,. ii. Fine
Gold in leaves, the weight of two French Crowns, and put them altogether in
the Glass, and presently set on the head, for it will begin to boil, and
cause red fumes like blood, the which thou shall receive in a Receiver, and
presently set thy Glass in the Furnace, and give it fire until all the water
be come forth with the fume. Then let it cool, and keep that water close in a
Glass, then break the other Glass that stood in the fire, and in the bottom
thou shall find our Petra Philosophale, the which thou shall grind finely, and
searce it into most fine powder, and then wash it well with Vinegar distilled,
and dry it again, and at the last wash it with Rose Water, and dry it very
well, stirring it continually over the fire, then keep it as a precious Jewel
close in a Glass.

For the order to use it, I will write hereafter, in sundry places: Ye shall
understand that the water which ye distilled away from the stone, will serve
for the same purpose again: But ye must take but half the quantity of the
aforesaid matters, and when ye have distilled it again from the stone, ye
shall preserve it for an infinite number of purposes, as I will show thee
hereafter.

To make our Balm artificial, with the order to use it, and wherefore it
serves.
THis Balsamum has all the virtues of the natural Balm, although not in
quality, yet in virtue, and the order to make it is thus.

. Venice Turpentine, pound 1. Oil of Bays, that is perfect without mixture,.
iiij. Galbanum, ounces iij. Gum Arabie, ounc. iiij. Olibanum Mirrha elect, Gum
Hederae, of each,. iij. Lignum Aloes, Galingal, Cloves, Consolida minore,
Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Zedoaria, Ginger, Diptamnum album, of each, ounce 1. Musk of
Levant, Ambergriece of each one Drachme. Beat all those aforesaid things
together, and put them into a Retort of Glass well luted, and put thereto vj.
pound of Rectified Aqua vitae without fleame, and so let it stand viiij. days,
and then distill it by sand, and there will come forth a white water mixed with
Oil, and so keep thy fire small, until there come forth a blackish Oil, then
change thy Receiver, and set thereto another, and increase thy fire until all
the spirits be come forth, then separate the Oil from the black water, and
keep them by themselves and the like shall ye do by the first water. The
first water that is white, is called Aqua del Balsamo, and the Oil separated
from that is called Oleum del Balsamo. The second water that is black is
called Matter Balsami, and the Oil separated from that water, is called
Balsamo artificiato, which would be kept as a precious Jewel.

The first Water is most excellent to clear and preserve the sight of the eyes,
also if the face being washed therewith, it makes it very fair, and
preserves it youthfully, it keeps back age, it breaks the gravel in the
reins; and it provokes Urine, the which is stopped through carnosity; it
helps all manner of Wounds, in what place of the body soever they be, if ye
wash them with the said water, and wet therein clouts, and lay thereon, for
his operation is so strange, that it seems rather divine then humane. It
helps much against the Etisie, and against all sorts of of Catarres, and
Cough. If ye wash a Sciatica therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the
same, it takes away the pain presently.

The other water called the Mother of Balm, helps scalls in short time if ye
wash them therewith; so does it help the white scall, Lepra, and all sorts of
Ulcers that are not corrosive most miraculous to see, and without any trouble;
it serves also against a number of other infirmities, the which I will let
pass at this time.

The Oil of Balm, does serve for an infinite number of things, and especially
for Wounds in the head, where the bone and pannicle is hurt, putting it
therein. It preserves the face if ye anoint it therewith. It is most
excellent against the Plurisie, giving thereof j. at a time with the water of
Balm

The Balm artificial is a most miraculous Liquor, if any have the stitch in
the side, and take two drachms thereof, it presently will help him. It is also
good against the Cough, and Cattare, coldness in the head and stomach, and for
Wounds in the head. It is a most sovereign Remedy, if ye anoint all the head
therewith once a day; because it pierces into the brains, and also unto the
stomach beneath. It resolves all tumors in all parts of the body with speed.
It resolves a Quartaine in short time, if ye anoint all the body therewith,
leaving no part.

And to be short, I know no disease neither hot nor yet cold, but that this
Balsamum does good unto, as well the hot diseases as the cold, because it
cools the hot, and heateth the cold, and this it does by his quality and
hidden virtue, so that I have found in this precious Liquor such great virtues,
that I am not able to declare them all; so that every one which is furnished
with this precious Balm, may be kept from infirmities, and shall not need to
seek the natural Balm with so much expenses and danger of the life, as has
been many times seen.

To make our Aromatico, the which helps against all manner of infirmities, of
what quality soever they be.
ARomatico Leonardo, is so called, because it was compounded and made by his
invention, and is a miraculous Medicine, that serves against all manner of
diseases of what quality soever they be, for it works this operation, that
is, as soon as it joyneth to the stomach, it draws to it all the evil
humors of the body, and imbraceth them, and carries them forth of the body
both by vomit and seege, and so leaves nature unburthened, the which may
prevail to his pleasure, because it has no impediment, and by this reason I
approve, that our Aromatico helps against all diseases, as is said before,
and the order to make it is thus.

. Fine white Sugar. iv. pure Pearls, Musk, Saffron, Lignum Alloes, Cinnamon,
ana.. i. Petra Philosophale. iv. Mix them together, and make thereof Lozanges
with Rose Water according to art, the which ye shall keep in a box of wood
close shut, and the order to use it is thus, when the Physician does go to
visit any sick person, and that he will prepare him some Medicine to take
inward, the best and most perfectest Medicine that he can ordain is our
Aromatico, because it evacuateth the stomach by vomit, and the body downward,
and his operation is such, that it does in manner help any crude sort of
infirmity, and the quantity is from one dram to two drachms, and may be taken
in broth, in wine, in water, or mix it with any pills, or potion, giving you
charge, that when ye put it in any potion, that ye leave none in the bottom
of the cup where ye drink it out, because the Petra Philosophale is heavy, and
will remain in the bottom, for if that remain, it will not work at all, giving
you also charge, that the said day that ye give this Medicine, that ye let
the Patients drink as much crude water as they will, and give them little meat
to eat that day, and this is the order to use this Medicine.

To make our Electuario Angelico, and the order to use it, and in what diseases.
ELectuario Angelico Romano, is so called, because it was compounded by me in
the City of Rome, in the time of Pope Paulo quarto, and because this
Composition works suddenly, I called it Angelico, and is most excellent
against many diseases, it is good against all sorts of Fevers, giving it
Perminorativo, and for the stitch in the side it is most rare, because it
takes away the viscosity in the stomach, and opens the pores, and is good
against the Gout, for if they take it every third day once, in ten days they
shall be helped, it is also good against the Cough, Catarre, and for the Milt,
and for those that have the Pox, or the running Gout, and such like influences,
and the order to make it is thus.

. Saffron, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamon, red Corrall, ana.. iii. Elleborus niger
without preparation. ii. Electuario de succo rosarum Mesue that is not too much
boiled. vi. Sugar Rosate. viii. Musk of Levant. i. Petra Philosophale. iii. our
Quintessence of Wine. ii. purified Honey as much as will suffice to make it in
form of an Electuary, mix them on a small fire in an earthen pan, and when it
is made, keep it in a vessel of glass, for any other vessel will not be so
good: This Electuary ye may mix with any soluble Medicine, but ye must take
it fasting, the quantity is from two drachms to four drachms. Ye shall
understand, that this in a manner reviveth the dead by his great virtue, as
has been seen many thousand times in Venice, and in Rome, most worthy of
memory, and therefore if any Physician desire to get fame in the world, let
them use our Electuario Angellico, which works miracles on the earth.

Of the vegetable stone of our invention, to transemute a body of one
complexion into another, and to make him sound for ever.
THe way to make the vegetable stone is rare, and his virtues are infinite, and
without comparison, and the cures that are done therewith are so miraculous,
that the world will no^ believe them, although it be the mere truth, and the
order to make it is thus.

. Tartar of white Wine that is thick and shining, Turpentine that is clear and
pure: The herb called Alloes, that has leaves as long as an arm, and dented
on both sides, and some call it Semper-vive, take of each of these one pound,
and stamp them together, and put them into a Urinall with a Head and Receiver,
and distill them in a Wine Furnace until all the substance be come forth, then
take the Fesses out of the glass, and grind them with the said water, and then
distill them as thou did before, and always at the last give it a strong
fire that the fesses may remain well burnt, then take out the fesses again, and
grind them with the water as thou did first, and distill it again, and this
thou shall do fifteen or twenty times, until all that water be consumed, and
the fesses remain white like salt, then lay that fesses on a smooth stone in a
moist place, and it will turn into water, the which keep in a glass close
shut, and that is the water of the vegetable stone, which water is of so much
virtue, that one scruple thereof being put into two ounces of Julip of Violets,
and given to drink to any that is infirmed or evil complexionated, in less
then four and twenty days he shall be helped of any grievous disease, and this
must be taken in the morning fasting, when the stomach is empty, for then it
works better his operation.

This is also an excellent remedy against the worms, giving it in the
aforesaid manner, it mundifieth the Liver, and dries the humidity of the Milt,
it dissolveth the Cough, and Catarres, it provokes Urine where it is let, with
diverse other virtues, the which I will let pass until another time, for if I
should write them all, they would not be credited, and therefore we Physicians
should not rest to practice in all things that seems to us convenient, and I
promise thee truly, that he which shall occupy this thing, shall work
miracles on the earth, and win great fame and honor. Ye shall understand,
that this is the stone that the Philosophers have long sought to fix their
Medicine Mineral, so that making the projection they join the Medicine with
metalling bodies, and not to go away in fume, because this stone resists all
great fires without consuming, and fixes Sulphur and Orpiment, so that they
shall abide the fire, and makes them white: If ye make projection therewith
on Copper, or on Lattin, it will turn it into the whiteness of pure silver,
and that I have seen with my eyes, so that ye may see of what importance this
vegitable stone is, the which works such goodly transmutations, as well in
mettalling bodies as in humane bodies, and therefore it is to be accounted of,
because it may save the life of many that use it in their Medicines.

Our soluble Sirrup, with the order to use it.
SOluble Sirrups made in decoction are very wholesome, and of great faculty, and
especially in the crudity of humors, and the reason is this: because it
disperseth the matter, and evacuateth it with great ease, and without danger or
trouble of the Patient, and the order to make it is thus.

. Sage, Rosemary, Wormwood, Cicory, Carduus sanctus, Nettles, Organy, of each a
handful, Figs, Raisins, Dates, sweet Almonds, Sal gem, ana. iiii.
Coloquintida, Aloes hepatica, Cinnamon, Mirabolani citrini, ana.. ii. common
Honey two pound.

Stamp them all grossly, and put them to infuse in eighteen pound of fair water,
then boil it till half be consumed, then strain it, and distill it by a filter,
and aromatise it with two carets of Musk and a pint of Rosewater, and then it
is made, which ye shall keep in a bottle of glass close stopped, the quantity
is from four ounces to six ounces.

In Winter you shall take it very warm. And in the Spring and Autumn, ye
shall take it but warm. In Summer ye shall take it cold, for this purges the
gross humors of the body, and hurts not the stomach, ye may use it in a
Fever, four or five days together, and it will help it. In crudity of
humors, as the French Pox, Gouts, Catarres, Doglie, Artetica, and such like
matters, where there is no accident of Fever, ye may take it ten or fifteen
days together, and cannot hurt by any means, for it purges most excellently:
it is given against the Cough, against Flux of the Urine, and pains in the
head, and Carnosity in the yeard, or the Hemeroids: And in sum it is good
against all diseases caused of corrupt humors; for it has such virtue, that
it draws from all parts, and evacuateth the humors intestinal, for of this
Sirrup I have had great experience, in such persons as were in manner banished,
and had lost their taste, and presently using this, they came to good
temperature; and I have used it an infinite number of times, in persons that
were ulcerated, and full of sores, evil handled of Fortune, and of the
infirmity, and finding no means to cure them as they should be, I gave them
this Sirrup fourteen or fifteen days, and then they were cured, with a number
of other things, the which would be too long to write; and therefore I would
wish every one to use this, not only in the aforesaid matters, but in all
other diseases.

Our Sirrupo Magistrale Leonardo, which serves against an infinite number of
diseases, and is a rare Medicine.
THis Sirrup is solutive, and very pleasant to use, and cannot hurt in any

thus.

Hemeroids, and such like diseases, and may be given unto a woman with child,
without any danger, when she shall have occasion to use any.

Our Sirrup against the Melancholy humor, and especially where there is
ventosi^ie in the stomach.
IT were necessary for those that will make this Sirrup, to be expert in the
Art, for it would be made with great diligence, and the order to make it is
thus.

. Water of Fumitorie, of Hops, of Wormwood, of Mayden-haire, of each five
pound. Then with this water thou shall make a decoction with these things that
follow.

Decoction according to Art, and strain it, then take four pound of that
Decoction, and put thereto the juice of Burrage, of Buglosse, of Hops, of each
two ounces; Common Honey, vi. ounces. Then with white Sugar, make a Sirrup in
good form, and aromatise it with Musk and Amber, putting thereto one ounce of
Plyris without Musk, and then it is made. The quantity is from three ounces to
four ounces in the morning warm, and fast thereon at the least three or four
hours, for this purges marvellously the melancholy humors, and all other
gross humors, and dissolveth wind, and comfort the heart, etc.

Our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, which is miraculous to dissolve crude, and
malign humors, with the order to use it in the French Pox, and such like
diseases.
BEcause the Pox is a disease contagious, putrefied, and corrupt, and works
many evil effects, as I have written in my Caprici medicinale; therefore it
were necessary to prepare most excellent and rare Remedies to dissolve the
same, which Medicines are infinite.

But in this Chapter I will write one, that purges the crude and viscous
humors downwards, and does assubtiliate the gross humors, and dries all
sorts of subtle humors that offend Nature, and sends them forth by sweat,
it dries the melancholy humor, and dissolveth choler, and is most wholesome
for those that are troubled with that disease, because it dries much and
dissolveth the disease, with many other good effects, as by experience thou
may see, and the order to make it is thus.

. The bark of Lignum sanctum grossly beaten lb. 1. and lay it to steep in lb.
xiiii. of fair water 24. hours, then boil it until four pounds be consumed,
then put thereto Pollipodie of the Oak, two ounces, Cicory one handful, Aloe
Epatike. iiii. and let them boil for an hour: Then put thereunto the leaves
of Syve, Epitemum, ana,. j. Coloquintida,. vj. Sugar, seven ounces, then let it
boil till half be boiled away; and that there remain lb. vii. then strain
it, and put it in a Glass with 12. grains of Musk; and keep it very close
stopped; and this is the Sirrup which ye shall take twice a day, that is morning
and evening; then make this drink following, which shall be the common drink
at all times to your meat.

. One pound of Lignum sanctum, Raspead, and steep it in ten pounds of white
Wine that is ripe; and let it boil an hour, then put thereto lb. xv. of fair
water, and let it boil a little more; and then strain it, and keep it in a
glass bottle, for this is to be used all the day time; and the order to use
these is thus. First, when any feels himself grieved with the Pox or any
such like disease, he must keep his bed at the least twenty days, and use to
take of the first Sirrup or Potion every morning a good draught, being as warm
as he may suffer it, then cover him well with clothes that he may sweat as
much as he can; then take off the clothes by little and little, and dry him
with warm clothes, and so let him repose for two hours, and then let him eat,
and his meat must be dry, as Biscuit, rost-meat, Raysins of the Sun, Almonds,
and sometime a raw egg, and his drink at meals, and all the day beside shall be
the last made with Wine and Water, then at night give him of the first Sirrup
as ye did in the morning, and cause him to sweat; and then dry him; and this
order thou shall use twenty days together not coming forth of thy Chamber,
and by the grace of God thou shall be helped of any such grievous infirmity; as
I have seen the experience thereof an infinite of times, to my great honor;
for it may be occupied in all complexions with safety, as by the ingredients
thou may see.

A most mavelous water and rare, to cause a man to avoid the gravel in
Urine, and to mundifie the Reins.
THe gravel in the Reins of the back is caused, and engendered of great heat,
and dryness in those parts, as thou may plainly see by those which are
troubled therewith; for their Reins are so hot that they cannot abide any
heavy garment to lie thereon, and they always make their water with great
pain and burning: therefore if thou will help that infirmity, it were
necessary to refrigerate the Reins, and moisten it with good juice, and take
away that burning of the Urine; and so in that order the Patient shall be
helped; and this thou may do in short time, and with great ease with this
Remedy.

The seed of small Lemonds, the seed of Oranges, and one pound, Saxifrage, six
pound, Balm, Scolopendria, Pellitory of the wall, Sparagus, Crisoni, Isop,
Fenel-roots, Parsley roots, ana.. vi. stamp them altogether, and make them in
form of a liquid Unguent with the juice of Lemons, then distill it in a common
tin Stillitory being luted, until the matter remain dry, then keep the water
in a Glass close stopped, and when ye will occupy this water, ye must first
purge the body of the crude and viscous humors, and likewise evacuate the
stomach of choler and phlegm; that being done thou shall take every morning and
evening. vj. warm, and it would be necessary for those that take it, to use a
diet, and to refrain moist and cold meats, and use only dry things, and so
this water shall help those aforesaid griefs; as I have proved diverse times.

To make the water of Lignum Sanctum, most wholesome against the Pox with a new
order.
COmmonly they use to take the water of Lignum Sanctum, against the Pox; the
which surely is most wholesome, but it must be taken in good order and form, and
must be made with great discretion, and not as they use it now adays; for they
give it some three or four times, and never the better, although the wood be
sufficient enough to help them; and therefore I would wish every one that will
use this water to take it in such order as it ought to be, the which I will
show thee hereafter.

. Lignum sanctum, Rasped small one pound, the bark being beaten. iii. infuse
them in twelve pound of fair water one night, and the next morning put therein
one pound of Honey, the which is put in, because it is aperative and warm, and
helps to provoke sweat, and causes it to have a good taste, then boil it till
half be consumed, then put thereto Carduus sanctus. iiii. strong Wine three
pound, then boil it until a third part be consumed, and then it is made, then
strain it, and take forth the Carduus sanctus, and put therein twenty pound of
fair water, and one pound of Honey, and let it boil until four pounds be
consumed, and strain it, and keep it in a glass bottle, for this is the common
drink to drink all the day long, and the order to take it is thus: First before
ye will take this water, it were necessary to take our Sirrupo Solutivo seven
or eight days, after that take of our Electuario Angelica. ss. that being
done, in the name of God take this potion of Lignum sanctum in this order, take
in the morning at the appearing of the day. viii. very warm as ye may suffer,
and presently lay clothes on him, and cause him to sweat two hours, and then
dry him with warm clothes, and so let him remain two hours, and then give him
to eat, and his meat shall be ^isket, Raisins, Almonds, and sometimes a little
roast meat, and no other: then in the evening, about the two and twentieth hour
ye shall give him the said Sirrup as ye did in the morning, neither more nor
less, and cause him to sweat, and about the four and twentieth hour give him
only Biscuit and Raisins, and the other common drink that was made last, giving
you warning, that ye make this drink fresh every third day, because it shall
not hurt the stomach, and every week once, ye (...) take a pill of Mart
millitare, and that day thou shall eat birds flesh, because of weakening, also
ye shall take very great bee^ to one thing, and that is this, if it happen,
that at the beginning of this cure there comes a Fever, or other accident unto
the Patient, that in any wise ye leave not the cure, but follow the order, for
that is a certain sign of health, for many times I have given this water, and
unto some in the fourth or fifth day the Fever came, and tarried many times ten
or twelve days, and then the Fever went away with the corrupt disease, and all
for company, and so in short time they were cured, so that, as I have said
before, when that sign appears, and is delivered, it is a certrin sign of
health: Also I will advise thee of another thing, and that is this, if the
Patient cannot sweat, ye shall anoint him all over with the Oil of Quinces,
the which will cause him to sweat apace: For without sweat the cure will not be
perfect, and this order thou shall keep at the least forty days together
within thy Chamber, so that there come no air in, for it will hinder the cure.

Our distillation for the Etesia, which is of mavelous virtue, and without
comparison, with the order to use it.
HAving written sufficiently of the quality of the Fever Hectic and his cure,
in my Caprici Medicinal^, (...) I will write of nothing but the order to make
this precio us Liquor, with the order to use it, as well for that disease as
for other such like, and the order to make it is thus.

. A young Hen that has not yet laid Eggs, and pull her quick, and then take
forth her guts only, and stamp her in a stone Mortar, and put thereto as much
crumme of white bread as the flesh does weigh, and stamp them together, and put
thereto a handful of fresh Scabious, and as many leaves of Gold as weighs a
French Crown, then put thereto as much water of Mortella as all the aforesaid
matter does weigh, and so leave it one night, and then distill it in a Urinall
of glass, with three pound of strong Wine in Balneo Mariae, until the fesses
remain dry, and then it is ended.

Then for every pound of this distillation, put thereunto. i. of the water of
Honey made according to our order, and keep it in a glass unstopt, that the
strong savor may go away, and the order to use it in the Fever Hectic I have
written in his Chapter, this serves also for those inward causes which are
most troublesome, and for those that have a burning Fever. Also for women that
have a Fever in their childbirth.

Our vegetable Sirrup, which is miraculous and divine.
THis Sirrup is one of my seven secrets, with which I have done many miracles
many times, in diverse operations on many infirmities, and have been so chary of
it, that I meant never to set it forth in my life time, but yet I considering
what great benefit it might be unto the world, I thought good to set it forth,
that every one might be served according to his pleasure: and the like I will
do of many other secrets of great importance, which shall be dispersed among
my books, and the order to make this Sirrup is thus.

. Lignum Aloes, Riopontico, Eupatorio, red Saunders, of each. ii. Beat them,
and make thereof a decoction in good form, and with lb. iv. of this decoction
make a Sirrup, and put thereto these things following while it is hot, Saffron.
i. Ginger. i. Musk two Carets, the solution of our Petra Vegetable. iii.
Cloves, Nutmegs, of each. i. and a half, then keep it in a glass close shut,
and this is our vegetable Sirrup which works miracles in diverse infirmities,
for by his nature it purifieth the Blood, mundifieth the Liver, comfort the
Heart, preserves the Stomach, provokes Urine, dissolveth gravel in the
Reins, it helps the Cough, and helps digestion, and quieteth all the
humors in the sick person, with diverse other virtues, which I will leave till
another time. This may be taken with broth, with distilled waters, or with any
Decoction, or Medicine fasting, the quantity is from one dram to two drachms,
and happy shall they be which shall use it.

An Electuary that helps the Cough with great speed, and ease.
THe Cough is caused of a catarrous humor, and coldness of the stomach, and
therefore if ye will help it, it were necessary to have a remedy that does
ripen the Catarre, and mollify the stomach, and the order to make it is thus.

. Enula campana,. iiij, Marsh Mallows. xij. Quinces. xvj. But if ye cannot
get Quinces, ye may take Marmalade ready made, and boil it in fair water
with the said roots, until they be dry, then stamp them in a Mortar, and
strain them through a strayner, then take for every pound of that matter two
pound of white Honey, and boil them together, but boil them not too much,
then take it from the fire, and put thereunto for every pound of the aforesaid
matter, one scruple of Saffron, and one Dram of Cinnamon, and two ounces of
Sulphur, and one scruple of Licoris, and then incorporate them well together,
and aromatise it with Musk and Rose Water, and this ye shall use morning and
evening; for this is of so great virtue, that it is to be wondered at, because
the Mallows do mollify, the Enula campana does warm and causes digestion,
and comfort the stomach; the Quinces are cordial and warm; the Sulphur is a
great dryer, the which destroys the evil humors of the body; the Saffron
comfort the heart; the Cinnamon is stomachall, the Licorice is mollificative,
and digesteth the matter; so that of force this Electuary must help any kind of
Cough, except it come of the Pox; for then it will do small pleasure; as I
have proved.

Electuario benedicto Leonardi, the which purges the body without any grief,
and is miraculous in his operation.
THis Electuario benedicto, is a compound of our invention many years ago; and
is so called, because of his mavelous operation, and the order to make it, is
thus.

. Of a certain kind of fruit called of some, Spina merula, of other Spini
cervini, with his berry they make a kind of sap green, take of these berries
when they be ripe, and stamp them, and take thereof the juice, and strain it
by a filter, and for every pound of the aforesaid Juice ye shall put therein
these things; Cinnamon, Safron, Cloves, Nutmegs, Ginger, ana. 1. Dram Sena,

much Honey purified, and that is our Electuario benedicto, the which purges
the body without pain, and preserves the stomach, purges the head, and
helps putrified Fevers, with diverse other things the which I will not write
at this time. Ye may keep this mixture 6. months after it is mixed with Honey:
the dose is from half an ounce to a whole ounce. Ye may take them in Pills in
broth, in an Electuarie, or in Wine, or how ye will, and always they shall
make his effect well.

An Electuarie against the evil disposition of the Liver and Stomach.
THe Liver is troubled with diverse and sundry causes: but for the most part it
is of heat: For the heat shows some outward sign, as is seen by experience;
for their Face and Nose are red; they have heat in their Legs, chops in the
palms of their hands and feet. It ingendereth Fluxes in the body, burning of
Urine, running of the Reins, and such like effects. And the order to cure them
is thus.

. Citraca, Scolopendria, Epataca, Eupaterio, ana. iij. beat them in fine
powder, Lignum aloes three Drachms, Saffron ij. scruples, Cinnamon, two Drachms,
white crude Honey one pound and a half, mix them and incorporate them together

ye begin to take this Electuary, ye shall take a quantity of our Electuario
Angelica, and then in short time they shall be helped, as thou may well see
by the ingredients that goes into this composition.

Our magistrall Electuary of Sulphur, the which serves against diverse sorts of
infirmities.
AS the fire has virtue to heat and dry material things, so has the Sulphur
virtue to warm, and to dry the humidity and coldness of our bodies; for I
have occupied it diverse and sundry times, and always have seen diverse and
sundry good effects; but for the better commodity, and more ease to use it, I
have compounded this Electuary, the which thou may use with ease and benefit
unto a number, and the order to make it is thus.

. Very fine Sulphur that is without earth, and make it in fine powder, one
pound, Cinnamon half an ounce. Saffron one scruple, Ginger ij. Drachms, Musk
dissolved in Rose Water, ij. Carrets, white honey crude as much as will suffice
to make it in an Eelectuary without fire, then keep it in a dry place: and this
ye shall use in the morning fasting, and his quantity is from four Drachms to
seven. This dries up scabs, provokes Urine, breaks the stone in the reins,
it helps the Cough, dries up the watering of the eyes, causes a good
appetite, with diverse other things, the which I will leave to the experimentors.

Our Electuario of Consolida majore, that serves for many diseases inwardly.
THis Consolida majore is an herb so called, because of his effect that it
does in healing of Wounds, and other places of the flesh separated; for if ye
eat thereof, it will help the Rupture, and all sorts of Wounds penetrating, and
Ulcers of the Lungs, it dries the Milt, and such like effects; but because
thou may use it more commodious, I have compounded an Electuary, the which
is excellent and rare, and is made thus.

. The root of Consolida majore, one pound, and boil it in water until it be
consumed, then stamp them in a Mortar, and pass them through a strayner, then
put thereto as much white Honey as the matter weighs and boil them on a
small fire until it be come to the form of an Electuary, and when it is
boiled, put thereto these things.

Mastike, Sarcocolla, Sanguis drachonis, in grain, ana ij. Drachms. Cinnamon, j.
Dram, Musk of Levant dissolved in Rose Water, one Carret, then incorporate
them well whiles it be warm: Ye shall note that the body must first be well
purged ere ye take this Electuary, and ye must also keep a diet that the
Medicine may work the better; for this helps all the aforesaid diseases
inwardly, as is said before: ye may use it implaister wise upon Wounds, and on
broken bones, and use it inwardly, and so the Patient shall remain helped.
With this I have seen men of great age helped, that were burst below, and
wounded from one part to the other; and also broken bones and bruises, the
which if I should write them, it would not be credited.

Our Imperial Electuary for the Mother.

great experience; it procures a good appetite unto those that have lost or
spoiled it, it helps the Milt, it dissolveth the pains of the head and teeth,
with many other virtues, which I will not write at this time, it preserves old

excellent in time of the Pestilence, as well for unction as for to help the
sores, for if ye put it in a sore, or botch, that is broke, presently it
takes away the pain, and being mixed with other of our Medicines, as I have
showed in my Regiment of the Pestilence, it helps them with great speed. If
any anoint all his body with this Oil twice a month, it will preserve him

space of xl. days, as I have proved: And this is the true and perfect Unction

sundry times in the aforesaid infirmities, and also in diverse other which I
leave until another time: Ye shall note, that if ye anoint any all over
that is grieved with the Pox with this Oil, it will increase his pain; and so
by that means ye may know whether he be infected or no.

Pillole Angelica, which evacuate the body without any Impediment, and are most

body, and preserves the body from putrefaction, as I have seen the experience

A compound Aqua vitae, which serves against all cold diseases of the stomach.
THis Aqua vitae, aromatised with simples of Levant, is of most excellent
virtue, as by the ingredient thou may perceive, and the order to make it is
thus.

. Nutmegs, Cloves, Gallingall, Cardamomum, Cubebes, Mace, Cinnamon, Ginger,
Saffron, Olibanum, ana.. i. Beat them finely, and put them in a goord of
glass, and put therein lb. vi. of pure rectified Aqua vitae, and so let it

water, which is most precious against all infirmities caused of cold, it
mundifieth all sorts of Sores, and helps all Wounds without pain. It causes
a good memory, it helps the Cough, and makes the heart merry, with diverse
other virtues, which I leave to the Experimentour.

A compound Oil against Poison, which is of a mavelous virtue
IF thou will help those that are poisoned, it were necessary to have remedies
of such virtue that are apt to the solution of the poison, for the poison
works those three effects, as is said berore, in the Chapter of the effects
of poison, wherein it is written, how that it is necessary to keep the blood
liquid, so that it congeal not in the veins, and likewise to let or stay that
water which comes to the stomach, and to let that alteration, or inflammation
as we may term it. And all these operations are necessary to be done with most
excellent remedies, in which there enters part of poison, for the Proverb
says, that one poison kills another, and that I will approve in this
Chapter, and the order to make this Composition is thus.

. The oldest Oil that thou can find lb. i. Aloes hepatica, Rhabarbaro, Spico
nardo, Mirrha, Tormentilla, Dictamnum album, Gentiana, Bistorta, Consolida
majore, Rubia di titory, ana. half an ounce, Theriaca Methridata, ana,. iii.
quick Scorpions to the number of sixty. First put the quick Scorpions into the
oil, and let them boil in Balneo Mariae four hours then put thereunto the other
matters, and let them boil altogether other four hours, then strain it, and
keep it in a vessel of glass close shut, for truly this is a divine Oil for
that accident, in which ye see enters Scorpions which are venomous, and yet
his poison is wholesome for those that are poisoned.

The like ye may see by those that are burnt with fire, for the best Medicine
that they can find, is to burn that place again: Also ye may see, that when
great quantity of blood comes forth of a Wound, the Chirurgian presently
lets him blood in another place to turn the same. Seeing then that these are
true, it is also true, that one poison does kill another poison. And by this
reason I approve, that if ye extinguish the poison, it were necessary to be
done with his kind, nevertheless it must be prepared so, that the matter be
not alterated, and become hurtful unto the poisoned person, and the order to
use this Oil against poison is thus.

When that a man is poisoned, presently anoint all his body with this Oil, and
give him thereof to drink two drachms with white Wine Vinegar morning and
evening, and God willing thou shall help any poison be it never so strong: If
he be poisoned with Sublimate, or a Diamoud, this remedy will not be good,
because they are not poisons, but are deadly Minerals, which by no means can
be digested, ere their evil effect mitigated. Therefore when one is poisoned
with Sublimate, his remedy is no otherwise, but to make him bathes of Vinegar,
and let him drink Milk enough, and eat Butter, and drink Siero, for this is the
true remedy; as for example, when that a sore is mortified with a rottery made
of Sublimate, or Arsenick, presently it causes great alteration, for which
there is no excellenter remedies then Vinegar, Butter, and Milk: Then seeing
that these remedies are so profitable to be used outwardly, there is no doubt,
but that they will do the same effect inwardly: Also it would be necessary to
cause them to vomit every day once at the least, to keep the stomach evacuated
of that matter, so that it come not to choke the infected person, or infect the
sinews, so that the party remain not lame for a long time after, as is daily
seen in diverse places.

A mavelous Soap that helps those which cannot spit but with great pain.
THis Composition is called Saponea nostra, because it is made of Soap, but not
of that Soap which is in the Apothecaries shops in Venice, but this is a
confection, which being eat every morning a little quantity, it helps those
that spit with pain, it opens the stomach, and breaks that evil matter
contained therein, and casts it forth at the mouth with the spittle, and so
leaves the Patient well disposed and merry, and the order to make it is thus.

. White Venice Soap, and beat it into powder. i. pure Mastick. ii. Cinnamon,
Licorice, ana.. i. fine Sugar as much as will suffice to make it in tables
according to art, the which are most strange, nevertheless marvel not
thereat, for I will show the reason, so that every one shall be satisfied.

Ye shall understand, that the first ingredient being the Soap, is made with
the Lie of Soda and Calx, which things do dry and mundifie all sorts of Ulcers
sordid, and cools them: Also therein is Oil Olyfe, which is one of the most
excellentest liquours in the world, for this of it self is able to cut that
matter from the stomach, and to mundifie it; then in this compound there is
Mastick, which is most excellent for the stomach, and draws down from the
head, then the Licorice and Cinnamon are aperative, and comfort the stomach,
so that all these being mixed together, of force it must help against these
infirmities of the breast, and the quantity thereof is from. ii, to. ss.

To make the Quintessence of Honey.
THis Quintessence has all the virtues of the Quintessence of Wine, and is
made in this order, and is rather to be counted a divine remedy then humane.

. The purest Honey that ye can get, which is not mixed with any thing lb. ii.
and put it into a goord of glass with his Head and Receiver close luted, and
give it first a gentle fire, until there appear certain white fumes in the
Head, which will turn into a red water by laying of clothes wet in cold water
upon the Head and Receiver, then keep in thy fire according to art, until all
the substance be come forth, which thou shall keep in a glass close shut, and
in short time it will turn into the color of a Rubie, then distill it seven
times in Balneo Mariae, and it will lose his red color, and be of a very
pleasant smell, and remain in the color of Gold, and this Quintessence
dissolveth Gold and makes it potable, and also all manner of Jewels that is
put therein; also if ye give two or three drachms to any that lie a dying,
presently it will recover him again, as the Quintessence of Wine does; if ye
wash any Wound or Sore therewith it will heal it quickly; it is good against
the Cough, Catarre, and pains of the Milt, and many other sorts of diseases
which I will not write at this time, for few or none will believe his great
operation or virtue. If ye distill it twenty times with fine Silver, it will
restore the sight unto those that are almost blind. Moreover, I have given this
six and forty days unto one that had the Palsy, and he was helped quickly.

It helps also the Falling sickness, and preserves the body from
putrefaction, so that by these means we may see, that it is a celestial
remedy given unto us by the Almighty God, and therefore I would wish some
virtuous men to take a little pains in making of this precious liquour, and
they shall see such wonders thereof, that the world will marvel thereat, as I
have proved many times, to my great honor and profit of the Patient. For many
times I have given it the sick that no man did see me, and presently they
thought I had wrought by enchantment, by reason of his great virtue, and
therefore all men that profess Physic and Surgery, ought to be provided of
this liquour, and such like for their commodity, and profit of the Patient.

To make our Elixar vitae, or Aqua Coelestis.
THis Elixar vitae is a Medicine of such virtue and strength, that it helps
in manner against all diseases that comes to man's body, for those that are
hot, it cools, and those that are cold, it warmeth, and that it does by his
proper quality and virtue, for this I have proved a thousand times, and have
used it against sundry diseases, and always have had good success, and the
order to make it is thus.

. Ginger, Zedoaria, Gallingal, long Pepper, round Pepper, Juniper berries,
Citron pills, Orange pills, Sage, Basil, Rosemary, Mint, Majorame, Bay
berries, Penniroyall, Gentian, Calamint, the flowers of Elders, red Roses and
white, Spica nardi, Cubebe, Lignum aloes, Cardamomum, Cinnamon, Calamus
Aromaticus, Germander, Staecados, Camepiteos, Meligette, Mace, Olibanum, Aloes
hepatica, the seed of Mugwort, of each. ii. Figs, Raisins, Dates, Almonds,
Grains of the Pine, ana.. vi. pure white Honey lb. i. Musk of Levant. i. fine
Sugar lb. iv.

Mix them altogether, and infuse them in lb. v. of pure Aqua vitae without
phlegm, and so let it stand eight days, then distill it in Balneo Mariae until
the fesses remain dry, then take that and sercolate it in a Pellicane in
horse-dung forty days, then take the glass with the fesses, and distill it in
sand until all the substance be come forth, which will be red like blood, and
stinketh of the fire, and is thick, the which must be sercolated as the first,
and this is the fiery part, which is of mavelous virtue, insomuch that it
reviveth those that are at the point of death, and therefore I will write of
some of his virtues which I have proved.

The first water distilled by Balneo, being taken every third day. i.
preserves the body in prosperous state, and defends it from many sorts of
diseases It helps all sorts of wounds if ye wash them therewith three or
four times, and is most excellent against all impediments in the eyes, if ye
put therein one drop, and preserves the sight a long time, so that ye shall
not need to wear Spectacles. If a young woman does wash her face therewith
oftentimes, it preserves her a long time in that state. If ye use to drink
this Elixar, it provokes venereous acts; and disposes women to be delivered,
with diverse other virtues, which I leave to the Experimentour.

The last water, which is red, is excellent good against the pains of the
Mother if it be drunk. It dissolveth also the Plurisie, if ye give thereof.
ii. and anoint the parts grieved therewith. It helps the pains of the
Colic, and hardness of the Milt. It is also good against pains in the
teeth, and stinking breath, and many such like things. It helps all manner of
Fevers, and the reason is, because it dries up all the evil humors that
offends Nature, as well within as without, so by this reason it is apt to
help all sort of diseases. If any were sick and could not speak, let him take.
i. of this with. i. of the first, and presently he shall speak most
miraculously, for this I have proved a thousand times, to my great honor and
content of the Patient, and therefore I would wish all those that profess
Physic, or Surgery, to be prepared with this liquour, and such like, for
their own profit, and health of their Neighbor.

To make Aqua Reale vel Imperiale, which makes the teeth white presently,
incarnateth the gums, and causes a good breath.
THe teeth being black, rusty, and full of filth, and the gums putrified or
corrupt, are the worst things that may be seen in man or woman, and are also
very unwholesome, and the remedy to make the teeth white, and to help the gums
is thus. Make this water, and use it in the order as I will show thee.

. Sal gemmae, Roch Alum, Brimstone, of each lb. ii. Borax. x. Pearl beaten
fine, Corrall, ana.. ii. pure distilled Vinegar.. iv. Put all the aforesaid
matters in a Goord, with his Head and Receiver, and give it fire according to
art, and at the last there will come forth a white water like Milk, which after
it has stood a while will wax clear. Ye shall understand, that this water is
above all other waters in the world to help Ulcers in the mouth, and to
incarnate the gums, and to make the teeth white, and causes a good breath in
those which are troubled with the aforesaid matters. For of this water I have
made great quantity, and it has been carried into Spain, into Almainy, into
Poland, into Constantinople, and into diverse other Countries, as though it had
been a divine thing, and not material.

For truly this experience does cause the world to wonder at it, the use hereof
I have written in this book, and hereafter I will write it again in some of my
books, where occasion shall serve to use it in cures.

A kind of Pill most convenient for the eyes, and comfort the stomach.
THose Pills which comfort the stomach, by force must help the sight, for when
the stomach is filled with malign humors, it distempereth those parts that are
about it, and the fumes that ascend up to the head moisteneth Neruos opticos of
the eyes, and by this cause the eyes are offended, therefore it were necessary
for those Pills that help the eyes also to comfort the stomach, which must be
done by evacuating the matter hanging by vomit, and the order to make these
Pills is thus.

. Marchpane made with Sugar and Almonds. i. Petrae Philosophale ten grains,
Elleborus niger six grains, Diagridii three grains. Mix them well in a Mortar
in form of a paste, and make thereof five Pills, and those thou shall take in
the morning fasting, for they are of so much force and strength, that they help
not only the eyes and stomach, but in manner all diseases, because they
cleanse the stomach, and evacuate the body, which two things are most necessary
in all diseases.

A discourse upon a Composition that preserves a man or woman in health a long
time.
IF thou will make a paste that shall have virtue to preserve whole bodies, and
to help the sick, it were necessary to look out simples that have virtue to do
it, and when thou have found out those drugs that have virtue to preserve, thou
may put thy trust in them: which I discoursing by the way of reason, and
conferring it by experience, have found out a number of drugs that are friends
unto our nature, and preserves it, of the which I will show thee some that are
of great importance, which may be proved by reason and experience, and are
these.

. Aloes hepatica, Olibanum, Mirrha, ana.. ii. Beat them into fine powder, and
make them into a paste like a salve with rectified Aqua vitae, then dry it in
the Sun, then beat it into powder again, and make it into a paste with our Oleo
del Balsamo, and then thou shall have a past of most mavelous virtue, for if
ye take thereof every morming. i. it will preserve him long in health, it is
most excellent for those that be wounded, or have any sore upon them, because
it keeps the sore from putrefaction, as by the ingredient thou may
perceive.

A mavelous Water, to be used of all Chirurgians in curing of their Patients.
IT is necessary for the Chirurgian in the cure of Wounds and Sores, to help
the body as well inwardly as outwardly, to take away the evil qualities and
corruption of the humors, and to preserve it from putrefaction, and then the
sore will heal with little help, and in short time, and that thou may do
with this Water, which is uncorruptible, and of great experience, and the order
to make it is thus.

. Of that Aqua vitae whereof we make our lb. x. and put therein these things
following, Quintessence Cinnamon,
Lignum aloes, red Saunders, Carduus benedictus, ana.. iii Cloves, long Pepper,
Calamus Aromaticus, Saffron, ana.. ii. Almonds, Grains of the Pine, Dates,
ana.. iv. Melegette,. i. fine Sugar lb. iv. Musk four carrets; let all these
stand in a long necked glass close stopped eight or nine days, and then
distill it in Balneo until ye have received lb. v. which keep close stopped
in a glass as a precious Jewel: then distill the rest in sand until the
fesses be dry, and that will be a red Water, and will stink somewhat of the
fire or smoke, which also keep in a glass, for in time it will loose his
stinking smell, and be most precious. The first Water is of such virtue, that
it helps all putrified Ulcers if ye dress them therewith. The second is
also perfect, that if any man drink every morning. ii. it will so preserve him,
that it were unpossible he should have any infirmity. For of this Water I have
made great experience in many kind of diseases, and especially in the Plurisie
and Petecchie.

To make our Caustic.
ALthough I have written of this Caustic in my Regiment of the Pestilence,
called now in English, a Joyful Jewel, imprinted by William Wright, dwelling
under Saint Mildreds Church. Nevertheless, I thought good to write it in this
place, because every one has not both these books, and the order to make it is
thus.

. Arsenike cristaline, Sal armoniack, Sublimate, ana. boil them, being finely
ground, in as much strong Vinegar as the matter weighs, until two third
parts be consumed, and that there remain a third; then keep it in a glass
close shut unto thy use, as I will show thee in diverse places, when occasion
shall serve.

To make Oil of Antimony.
REc. Antimony, and calcine it until it will smoke no more, and that it be of
a grayish color, and always as it cluttereth stamp it again, then take as
much common Ashes as the Antimony finely searsed, and put them into a Retort
well luted, and give it fire according to art, till all the fumes or spirits be
come forth; giving you charge, that your Receiver be very great least all
break. This Oil is of mavelous virtue against Ulcers, if ye give thereof
four grains with any Sirrup; it helps the Fever presently; it helps
Fistulaes; and to be short, it is most wholesome in diverse things. But it were
necessary for the Chirurgian to be expert in the use thereof, and to mix it
according to his work. And therefore he that cannot use it well, were better to
let it alone, because it is a perilous thing unto the unskilful, and precious
unto those that know how to use it.

A precious Liquour above all other.
THis is the most precious water that may be made in the world, and his virtues
are such, and so many, that they cause the world to marvel at them. The Mirrha
and Aloes, with Vernish, and with as much of our Quintessence being mixed,
which without Fire, Ashes, and Coals cannot be separated, and when the Air, the
Water, and Earth are separated, each of them shall be apt to mitigate pains,
dissolve humors, help wounds, dissolve pains within the body, and such like
matters. This water I have used diverse times, and caused the world to wonder at
its operations, and so shall every one do, that desires to follow the right
way, and that will be a child of Art. Thou shall understand, that I would have
written this plainer, but that I write it to those that have judgment both of
the quantities and virtues; because Pearls are not for Swine.

A Secret of mavelous virtue.
REc. A new Brick forth of the Kill, and break it in small pieces like a Nut,
then lay them in the fire until they be red hot, then take them forth, and
quench them in sweet Sallet Oil, then take them forth again, and lay them in
the fire until they be red hot, then quench them again, and this ye shall do
at the least five times, and at the last time take them forth, and put them
into a glass, with Aloes, Frankincense, and Mirrha, and distill it according
to art; then separate each liquour by himself, and therewith thou shall work
wonderful cures, if thou know how to use it, and whereunto.

Our Secret of mavelous virtue in act and strength
THis Unguent is of mavelous virtue, and was never made by any before,
neither Ancients nor of our time, which Unguent helps putrified Ulcers in the
legs, so that it is to be wondered at: for it works diverse operations, it
mortifieth the evil, mundifieth, incarnateth, and siccatrizeth, which things
to the Professors of the Art seems hard: Nevertheless it is true, as I have
proved an infinite of times; and because the world should have it, I have
written here the receipt.

. Of our Magno liquore, and Oil of Mastick, made at the Apothecaries, and put
them into a vessel of Copper, with as much Litarge as ye shall think good,
and so let it stand a good while on the fire, and put thereto of our Cerotte
Magistrale, and incorporate them well together, and so of yellow it shall
become black; then take it from the fire, and put therein Mercury precipitate,
and stir them well until it be cold, and herewith thou shall work wonders. It
would be necessary for him that will make this receipt, to consider well of the
Ingredients of the Compositions, which are written in this book.

To rectify and preserve the sight of those that are weak-sighted.
IF thou will rectify and preserve the sight in those that are weak-sighted,
of what cause soever it be; thou shall make this water, and use it according to
this receipt.

. Fenell seed, the flours of Rosemary, Rue, Celendine, Carduus benedictus,
Staveseaker, Eufrage, of each a handful, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, sweet Almonds, of
each. i.

Stamp all these grossly, and infuse them in thirty pound of pure white Wine,
then let it stand four days, and then distill it in Balneo, until ye have
received four pound, which keep close by it self, and when thou will use it,
put thereof one drop into the eye when ye go to bed, and in the morning when
ye rise; and thus using it, it will preserve the sight a long time.

Of Lac Virginis, and the order to make it
THis Lac Virginis is a solution of Saturn, and Sal gemma, which is a thing
most necessary for the Chirurgian to use, and the order to make it is thus.

. Litarge of gold as much as ye think good, and beat it into fine powder, then
put thereon strong distilled Vinegar, and so let it remain two or three days,
stirring it every day, then boil it until half be consumed, then let it repose
two or three hours, and the Vinegar will be clear and of the color of Gold,
then pour it forth into a glass, and keep it, then take Sal gemmae, and rain
water, ana. and dissolve it on warm ashes, and when it is dissolved, keep it in
a glass, and when thou will make Lac Virginis, take of each of these solutions
alike, and mix them together, and thou shall see a strange thing. For as soon
as they are mixed together, they will turn into a white Unguent like Ceruse, or
white Lead, which serves in diverse causes according to the intention of the
Chirurgian.

The solution of Litarge by himself, with as much Oil of Roses, being mixed
together, makes a delicate Unguent, and refriscative, which siccatrizeth
Ulcers with great speed.

To calcine Tutia, and to bring it into a salt.
Thou shall dissolve thy Tutia in this water following.

. Sal niter, Roch Alum, Vitrioll, Sinaber, ana. lb. i Beat them together, and
distill them according to art; then take that water, and put therein thy Tutia,
and let it dissolve upon the warm ashes, and when it is dissolved, vapor away
the water until it remain dry, the which take forth, and put it into an
earthen pan unglazed, and calcine it with a strong fire, then dissolve it in
distilled Vinegar, and when it is dissolved, vapor away the Vinegar, and the
salt will remain in the bottom, which serves much for Tincture, and to make a
Liniment for the eyes, the which is most precious and rare, for if ye mix a
little thereof with Hogs grease and Camphire, and then put it into the eye, it
helps them with such speed, that it is to be wondered at, and not without
cause. For his nature is to give light, and to heal things imperfect. The Tutia
mixed with Borax, and with our Varnish that we guild leather with, and given in
projection upon Venus melted, it causes it to be in color not much differing
from Sol, of the which thou may make strange things, for he that knew the
virtue and quality of Tutia, as well in Alchymie, as in infirmities, was to be
counted a wise man.

To Precipitate Mars, and to bring it into a red powder, called Crocus Martis,
the which serves for diverse purposes.
REcipe, Sal niter refined, Roch Alum, Vitriol Romain, ana and thereof make a
water according to Art, with all his spirits, and in that water dissolve thin
plates of Iron or Steel, and when it is dissolved, vapor away the water,
until it remain dry in a red powder, then take it forth, and calcine it in a
Furnace of reverberation 24 hours. Then keep it to thy use, until thou
know more thereof, for it is wonderful in his operation, as I will show
thee hereafter.

A Secret of Turpentine of Ciprus.
THe Turpentine of Ciprus is a kind more finer then our Turpentine, and
without comparison, and of more virtue then ours is, and this the Doctors say,
does dissolve pains and preserves the body, if it be taken inwardly, because
they say, That Turpentine is an uncorruptible Gum, the which is most true. But
in that Gum there is one part thick and gross that hinders his operation,
and he that can separate this gross part from the noble parts, shall do great
wonders therewith: It is needful then with the fire, and the means of our
Quintessence, to make the separation of the Elements, the which are four,
Water, Oil, Liquor and Earth. The Water is profitable, the Oil is perfect,
the Liquor is noble, and the Earth that remains, is spoiled, and of no
substance, and with those things thou may do high and great cures, when
they are applied according as they ought to be, because many good and
profitable things, through the want of perfect application in time and place,
many times do hurt, and to show the truth, I will show thee an example of
wine, the which is a precious liquor, the which being drunk in the morning is
hurtful to many, to eat meat betwixt meals is not good, and many such like
things, that when they be not done with order do hurt, and therefore it is
necessary for those that will understand, that matter to be of a good
intelligence, as well in making it, as in using or applying it to the sick.

FINIS.
THE EXCELLENCY OF PHYSIC AND CHIRURGERIE, Collected out of approved
Practices, and learned Observations of many expert men in both Faculties.

LONDON, Printed by G. D. 1652.

To the Freindly Reader, as much health as he wishes of Soul and Body.
MEN many times meddle in some matters, wherein they take more toil then thank
for their labors; and he, which thinks in the night that he has pleased all,
shall find in the morning that he has angered some. So many as know me well,
and whereto I was chiefly adicted within these eight or nine years, that is,
unto the study and practice of the soul Physic, may now make a question of my
meddling so long with bodily Physic. But my twofold answer they may take with
them for their satisfaction: First, that I keep still Depositum illud, which
God has committed unto me (and sealed the same by mine own spiritual birth,
and other men's sanctification) till he that has said, Go, points the time,
and gives the occasion of my further service in that weighty Function.
Secondly, as when I conversed in that calling I was chargeable to none, so (not
surceasing the same of mine own accord) I have since, by God his blessing of my
labors herein, as not greatly enriched my self, so not impoverished any: That
wherein I have thus continued, seeing it concerns learning, and an honest
man's maintenance, cannot, or ought not to offend any that are well in their
wits. These few secrets contained in this Collection, and Appendix thereto
adjoining (which I have reduced into method for his sake that gathered them
here and there) cannot, or ought not to scandalize any, that have a sanctified
cunning in Physic or Surgery. I must needs tell thee, that I lean more to
that safe, speedy, and pleasant kind of curation, with Medicines rightly
prepared, then to the careless Composition, made by addition of other simples,
clogged with more impurities then are in that simple which they labor to
correct. I dare also avouch, that any poor body may better commit his crasie
body, to be healed or helped of any outward or inward malady, by the right
prepared Medicines, for the value often Shillings (which he can hardly spare)
then a wealthy man to their deceits (I would say receipts) for ten Crowns,
which he may well enough forbear: Many of the ignorant sort have counted the
Chymicall or Paracelsical Physic dangerous, and not without cause, for woeful
experience has brought it into that suspicion. But (good Reader) hear me in
that which I Will tell thee, and so take thine answer for this time: Some of the
learned, and most of the ignorant, have in general despised them, but by your
leave, after they have heard a particular of the excellent success attained by
many of them; they have adventured upon those, without knowledge, experience,
direction, and so have made many Patients to smart for it: Therefore I would
not, that the fine fingered Physician should scorn to wear this Pearl, which is
as fit for Sir John lack-Latine, for the Land-leaper, or cogging Quacksalver,
as a Pipe for an Ass, or a Cage for a Cow. The Salts, Oils, Waters, Extracts,
Tinctures, Simples prepared, and Compositions of Simples conjoined, mentioned
in this book or not mentioned, I mean not to make sale of (as the Grocer or the
Apothecary does,) but I keep them in store, and mean to increase them for mine
own use and my friends, and for such as shall need them, as the learned
counsel of Physic rules shall give occasion.

Farewell.

FINIS
The Proheme or Entrance into this Collection, contained in the first four
Chapters.
CHAP. I. What the duty of an expert Chirurgian is.
A Good and true Chirurgian is no other, then a Minister, and helper of nature;
who has three operations to perform in curing of wounds: The first is, that he
join the separated parts close together: The second, to preserve it from pain:
The third, that he keep it from putrefaction; all the rest he may leave unto
nature, which will work with good expedition: And this is a sure intention
concerning the cure of Wounds; never keep the flesh open with tents or
pledgets; neither weaken nature by letting of blood, or by purging, nor yet by
straight diet, to cause the pain to increase, but keep the wound always clean,
washing it with Aqua Balsami, and lay upon the wound clothes wet in Magno
liquore: This is a good and an approved order, whereof whosoever will know
more, let him look in Leonardo Phioravante his book of Rational Secrets, where
he shall be satisfied more at large.

CHAP. II. The cure of all manner of Wounds in general
ALl kind of wounds may be healed with these Medicines following (according to
the method before mentioned) viz. with our Balsamo, with Aqua balsami, Balsamum
artificiale, Quinta essentia vini Oleum refinae pini, Oleum Cerae and
Terebinthinae, Magno liquore, Cerotum magistrale, Elixer vitae, Oleum
hypericonis compositum, our secret Powder, all which are set down in the
forenamed book, and for the most part, are to be had for a reasonable
consideration, at the house of W. I. in Amen Corner.

CHAP. III. The cause why Wounds cannot heal quickly.
THough there be many more, yet chiefly they may be reduced unto two causes:
The one is, an immoderate and extreme diet, which weakeneth the stomach and
body so much, that nature cannot prevail to conglutinate or soder the flesh
together; and thus, through want of natural heat, the wound falls to
Imposthumation, Gangrena, Fistulaes, etc. and can hardly be cured. The second
cause is, the keeping of them too much open, by reason of their tents or
pledgets, so that they cannot join together again, but grow to Cancers and
Fistulaes, whereupon many times the Patient remains lame ever after, or else
speedy death is the end thereof.

CHAP. IIII. Of Wounds in the head, how they must be dealt withal.
ALl wounds in the head must be close joined and kept together, the blood must
be crushed out, then wash it well with something that has virtue to liquifie
the blood, as the Quintessence of Wine, or such like; then lay thereon lint wet
in Oleum benedictum; this Medicine you shall change in four days, but every
day once wash the wound round about with that Quintessence, and anoint it with
the said Oil, and at the fourth days end dress it again, and let it remain
two days more, and after that for a day more, and the wound (by the help of
God) shall be cured in twelve or fourteen days: Thus may you deal with all
wounds, save those that are made in the belly; as for all other, either simple
or compound wounds, you shall find their cure, methodically showed, in the
Rational Secrets of Leonardo Phioravante published in English.

CHAP V. The healing of a grievous Wound on the side of the head.
THe wound was made on the side of the head, almost to dura matter, and it was
healed in this manner: First there was put into the same the Quintessence
aforesaid, then a little Balsamo, then there was applied a cloth which was wet
in Magno liquore, made very hot, upon which cloth was laid our secret powder,
covered with lint, and thus he was dressed once every day till he was whole.
You must note, that whenever the skull is hurt unto dura matter, there must be
cast up at the nostrils our balsamo that the smell may pierce upward, and
resolve the offense. Sometime also in stead of a Defensative, you may anoint
round about the wound, with the foresaid Balm, which preserves from
putrefaction and alteration.

CHAP. VI. A dangerous wound in the head, cured in five days.
IT was healed very quickly, by putting therein our Aqua caelestis and balsamo,
and by applying unto the same very hot clothes wet in Magno liquore.

CHAP. VII. The cure of a wound on the ear to the skull.
A Sore wound was made on the ear, which was cut unto the skull of the head,
and was healed in this manner; First, by anointing it with out Quintessence,
which caused it to wax very hot, the space of two hours. After that there was
put in our Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina and Cera, and so he dressed it
every day once.

CHAP. VIII. How three wounds in the head, with fracture of the bone or scull
were healed by I. P.
A Ceriain Miller in Buckinghamshire, called Peter Bull, being sore wounded in
the head, whereof one wound was in the midst of the head, with fracture of the
skull, another within an inch of that six inches long, he had another wound
over his eye brow two inches long. Besides the wounds in his head, he had also
a great wound in the bow of his arm beside the elbow, so that a man might have
laid his three fingers in it, diverse of his fingers were also cut, and he lost
two joints. This man bled by the space of seven or eight hours before it was
stinted; nor was he dressed until the next day, but yet he was cured in this
manner. First the hair was shaven away round about the wounds on his head, and
the wounds were made clean, then was there dropped into the wound, Balsamum
sulphuris, made very warm, and a fine cloth wet therein was applied to the
wounds, and round about the wounds there was a Defensative applied, thus he was
dressed once in 24 hours, and within the space of 3. weeks, he was perfectly
helped, that he wore no plaster at all. Also you shall note that upon the
wound next the cloth, there was laid cerotum magistrale, of Leon. Phioravante;
Forget not, that this Balsom must always be used warm, with a fine linen
cloth, or a piece of Cambrick, and not with any lint. This Balsam did cause the
hair to grow so fast about the wounds, that it was fain to be shaven away very
often.

CHAA. IX. Of contused wounds on the head, or other parts of the body
THe ancient Practitioners have esteemed contused wounds to be very dangerous.
For they say contusions must first be brought to putrefaction, and turned into
matter which opinion is not to be allowed, for the bruises are to be dissolved
without maturation, which has been a thousand times proved in the wars, after
this manner to have been performed.. Magno liquore, Oleum benedictum, ana, mix
them, and being very hot, wet clothes therein, and lay thereon twice a day, and
in three or four days they will be resolved. Also the oil of Frankincense, or
Oleum Philosophorum de Tereb. and Cera, will resolve any simple bruise in three
or four hours, only by continual anointing the place therewith, so fast as
it drinks in any. Provided, that the bruise be not above six or eight hours
old, for if it be, then will your work be somewhat the longer before it be
finished.

CHAP. X. A contused wound on the head healed by I. P.
A Young man of 28. years of age, that had a great contusion on the head with a
staff, was helped thereof in 9 days, by applying thereunto Balsamum sulphuris
before mentioned.

CHAP. XI. A wound in the head, with fracture of the skull, cured by I. P.
A Little boy with a fall from a horse, had a fracture in the skull, which was
healed with Balsamum sulphuris, and Cerotum Magistrale Leonardo. The child did
at his dressing, vomit very often, which argued the breaking of his scull, yet
was he healed in seven days.

CHAP. XII. To heal wounds speedily.
FIrst wash them very well with our Aqua balsami, then join them very close
together, and lay thereon a cloth wet in Oleo rosini pini, and (through Gods
help) they shall be quickly healed.

CHAP. XIII. To heal Wounds, by shot, or lance.
HE that will cure Wounds that are made with shot, lance, Arrows, etc. must
first wash the Wound well with urine, and dry the Wound well, then let him put
therein the Quintessence of Wine, and forthwith join the Wound close and hard
together, then let him put immediately therein, five or six drops of our
Balsamo artificiato, and lay a cloth upon the Wound wet in Magno liquore, which
must be applied so hot as he may suffer it; thus must he do the first day.
That being done, he must put thereon our Quintessence of Wine, and then a
little Balsamo, after that some Magno liquore (as before was said) and so let
him hold on unto the end of his cure.

CHAP. XIIII. A most singular and wonderful remedy to heal Wounds quickly.
VVOunds must be helped with drying Medicines, (as was noted in the third
Chapter) such Medicines, I say, as have virtue to preserve the part offended
from putrefaction. This will be performed with our Aqua Balsami, and the Oil
distilled from Vern^ce liquid; for these two are apt to heal all sorts of
Wounds, if ye wash them with the water, and anoint them round about with the
oil, for they do not only keep the Wounds from putrefying, but they help to
siccatrize quickly, and in such manner, as it seems mavelous, not only
most profitable for the wounded Patient, but best for the good and honest
Chirurgian, who abhors in his work to play the Tinker, which in stopping of
one hole is wont to make three, but with as much safety and speed as Nature and
Art will yield, to bring to pass all his honest intentions.

CHAP. XV. A wound in the eye with a splinter, healed by W. H.
A Splinter of wood leaped into the eye of a certain Maiden as she was chopping
of sticks. The wound was so grievous, that the gelly of her eye came forth by
the space of a month; all this while she could neither see, nor take any rest.
By the blessing of God, within four days after she could thread a needle, and
was recovered in this manner. First there was dropped into her eye Balsamum
Sulphuris warm, and then a cloth wet therein was applied thereunto, by which
only she was cured: the Maid dwells in Nottinghamshire.

CHAP. XVI. A prick in the eye with a knife, healed by W. H.
A Child of seven years of age had a puncture in the eye with a knife, which
was cured by dropping therein Balsamum Sulphuris warm, and laying a defensative
round about it.

Another cure performed in like manner, by W. H.
ONe George Clarke, servant to the right worshipful Mr Butler of Denham (then
high Sheriff of Bedford) was healed of a puncture in his eye with the
aforesaid Medicine.

An hand flat squatted and contused, healed by W. H. CHAP. XVII.
AN old man, called Thomas Smith, of Carlton in North-hamptonshire, Husbandman,
in lopping of a tree had his hand caught between two boughs, and was squatted
in pieces; this contused hand was presently put close together, and anointed
with Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina, and Cera, and through Gods goodness,
was perfectly cured in eight days.

CHAP. XVIII. A wound or puncture through the arm. I. P.
A Young man, called Hudson, a Carpenter of Carlton in Northamptonshire, being
thrust through the arm with a Pitch-forke, was thus cured. First there was
injected Magno liquore (as hot as he could abide it) into the wound; then was
there a linen cloth wet in the same oil applied unto the wound, upon the
which cloth was also laid a pledget of Cerotum magistrale; this wounded man was
healed in five or six days.

CHAP. XIX. Five wounds in the breast.
A Certain man that had five stocadoes into the body was thus cured. First
there was put into the wounds the Quintessence of Wine, then were the wounds
dressed with Balsamo artificiato, which caused him to vomit, and to avoid much
bruised blood; after that he drunk every morning a little Aqua Balsami, and in
short time by Gods help was perfectly cured.

The manner to stay any flux of blood, or vein, you shall find in the 17.
Chapter of the second part of this Collection, and in the Secrets of Leonardo
Phioravante, where he treats of Wounds.

The Second Part of the first Division.
VErbum sapienti sat est, and a man may know by the half what the whole means;
by these few experimented secrets, you may proceed unto the cure of any Wound,
Contusion, or Puncture, in what part of the body soever they shall be. The
things wherewith you are to work, as Balsamum Sulphuris, Oleum Philosophorum de
Terebinthina and Cera, Cerottum magistrale, etc. you may have of Mr. William
Johnson dwelling in Amen Corner. Now let us proceed unto the experimented
secrets, concerning Ulcers and Sores, either simple or complicate with
diseases, as they have been observed by those which have proved them.

CHAP. XX. The healing of sore mouths.
THe Ulcers and Sores that have been in the mouths of young and old, have been
healed by the lotion or gargarisme made with Plantaine water, Hony-suckle
water, and Barley water, mixed with Saccarum Saturni.

CHAP. XXI. An Ulcer in the upper lip.
A Certain Porter of London having an Ulcer on his upper lip, which was like a
Cancer (some called it Noli me tangere) continually running, with filthy
stinking sanies, was thus cured. First he was purged with Turpetum minerale,
then was the sore dressed with this Medicine.

. Aloes lotae. ss. Salis preparati. ii. Mellis. iiii. Misce and utere.

CHAP. XXII. An Ulcer in the throat, ex morbo Gallico.
A Young woman that was much troubled in the throat with a grievous Ulcer, was
thus cured. First she was purged with Aromatico, and twice or thrice with our
Quintessence solutive mixed with Sirrup of Roses, then was the sore touched
with Aqua realis, two or three times with a little lint, and lastly she used
this gargarisme.

. Mellis Rosarum ii. Diamorum. ii. ss. Hony-suckle water, ana. vi. Oleum
Vitrioli as much as will suffice to make it tart; this has been often proved
in dangerous cases.

CHAP. XXIII. The healing of a scall'd head.
A Woman had all her head covered with a most silthy scab, which was dry above
and moist underneath, very noisome to behold, who could neither be healed by
purging, or local Medicines that were used, till this Medicine was applied
unto her. Once in a day Oleum ligni Guaiaci was applied, and in short time the
scall fell away, like a scull of an head, and there began hair to grow
underneath it; this cure was performed in twelve days.

Another cure performed upon a scall head.
A Maiden of eighteen years of age, having an huge great scall upon her head,
was cured (after she had taken one dose of Aromatico) by often washing the part
affected with Matter Balsami Phioravante

CHAP XXIV. An Ulcer on the Thumb.
ONe had such a filthy and stinking Ulcer on the Thumb, that the Chirurgians
would have cut off the whole Thumb. This party was afterward cured by the
application of Fodicationum emplastri.

CHAP. XXV. An Vlcerated leg wonderfully swollen.
A Young boy that had an ulcerated leg wonderfully swollen, was thus cured. He
received at two several times Quintessence solutive, with Sirrup of Roses;
then were the sores washed with salt of Vitrioll dissolved in Plantaine water,
a cloth being wet therein and applied thereto morning and evening.

CHAP. XXVI. Two putrified Ulcers on the leg, healed by I. P.
FIrst this Patient was purged with Aromatico Leonardo once or twice, then his
Ulcers were dressed with this Un^uent made of rubified Vitrioll, and a Cerot
called the great Cerot: this was applied unto the Ulcers, with a pledget of
Lint, and was suffered to lie four and twent^ hours, which mortified the sores;
then was more of the same Unguent applied, and with an Instrument the escare
was loosed round about, and in three or four days, the escare came away
easily with a pair of Mullets: then he healed it up with Magno Liquore, and
Saccarum plumbi, within a little while after.

CHAP XXVII. Three Ulcers in the legs healed by W. H.
A Certain woman of Bedford, had three Ulcers in her leg, who had sought her
cure at the hands of diverse, the space of four years, but could find no help,
yet she was afterward cured in this manner. First, she took in the morning
fasting Aromatico Leonardo, which evacuated her stomach and belly. Then was
there applied unto the sores Saccarum plumbi, three or four days together,
which caused every day a certain thin skin to come upon the Ulcers, much
like the filme of an egg, the same skin was taken away every day: with this
Medicine following, it was dressed the fourth day, which caused it to look
fair and red the next dressing: and so in short time it was perfectly cured.
To one spoonful of Magno Liquore was put as much Saccarum Saturni, as would
lie upon a threepence; and so it was incorporated warm: the sores were
dressed therewith every day.

CHAP. XXVIII. The cure of old rotten sores by W. R.
A Certain old woman, did in this manner help diverse old sores in the body.
First she purged the Patients, and then she applied this unguent to the sores.
Take a pot of strong Ale, and set it to boil over a gentle fire, till it wax
thick like a salve, and then use it. At the first this Medicine will smart,
and be somewhat painful to bear; nevertheless it will cleanse and heal.

Note. Also a friend of mine told me, that the juice of Marigold leaves, or the
leaves boiled with milk to an Unguent, will heal all Ulcers and Wounds.

CHAP XXIX. The healing of Ulcers in most parts of the body: but chiefly in the
head by W. H.
A Certain man being full of Ulcers, coming of the Pox, in most parts of his
body showing themselves, but chiefly in the head, was cured in this manner.
First, he was purged twice or thrice, with Panch^magogon, after that, he kept
his Chamber, (that had a good fire in it) and took six grains of Turpetum
diaphoreticum, mixed with. i. of Amul^tum Palmarij. Half an hour before he
took a draught of fat broth, and kept his bed; and always as he vomited, he
washed his mouth with a convenient Gargarisme, and sweat thereon one hour or
two, and then was dried with warm clothes: That done, he reposed a day or two,
and took the aforesaid Turpetum again, in manner aforesaid: this he did three
or four times. In the mean while, he anointed his Ulcers with oleum Guaiaci,
which did both cleanse, and heal. Also diverse times, he used this Potion in
the morning, which caused him to sweat... ii. of the water of Lignum vitae,
made by distillation, and as much of the Sirrup of Fumitorie, and. i. of the
salt of Lignum vitae, mix them warm, and drink it fasting. Thus in very short
time he was cured. This one thing must not be forgotten, that when there shall
come any inflammation or soreness in the mouth, you do use this Gargarisme
following. Take Plaintaine water, honey suckle water, ana,. iiij. Barley water,.
vi. mel rosarum. ii. ss. Diamor^m. ii. Oleum vitrioli, as much as will make it
tart: this will heal any sore in the mouth. Remember also, that if the Ulcers
be very corrosive and foul, you shall touch them once or twice, with Oleum
vitrioli, or Oleum tartari faetentis, whereby they will heal the sooner, this
has been often proved.

CHAP. XXX. The healing of scabs, like the Leprosy, by G. M.
A Young man (which was thought to be infected with a Leprosy) had on his
head, and most parts of his body, hard and dry scabs, but he was cured in this
manner. First, he was purged with Aromatico Leonardo once or twice. Then every
morning till he was cured, he took i. of the extract of Camepiteos, either in a
Pill, or in drink as he thought good. After that his sores were dressed with
this Unguent.. Succi sempervivi. ii. Succi plantaginis,. iiii. ss. Succi
solani,. iii. Sacchari Saturni,. ii. ss. mix them, and stir them well
together over a gentle fire, till all the Saccharum be dissolved, and therewith
dress the sores twice a day.

CHAP. XXXI. The healing of a Child, that was full of Ulcers, coming of the Pox.
A Young child four years old that was grievously tormented with the French
disease, having extreme pain in the body, and being full of sores, was thus
cured. the distilled water of Lignum vitae, i, Salis ejusdem,. i. mix them, and
thereof the Child drank, with Sirrup of Fumitorie or Hops, morning and
evening, and sometime the Child sweat thereon. Also the sores were anointed
with this Unguent,. Oleum guaiaci,. ss. Balsamum Sulphuris,. ss. Saccarum
plumbi,. ss. Oleum camphorae, five or six drops, the caput mortuum of Aqua
fortis,. i. Mix them well, and grind them on a stone with May butter, and
therewith the sores were anointed morning and evening.

CHAP. XXXII. A Cancer cured by an old Empericke.
A Certain Empericke did help many Cancers, in diverse people (that were
troubled with them) after this manner. He took certain worms called in
Latin Centumpedes, in English sowes: they are such as lie under old timber, or
between the bark and the tree. These he stamped, and strained with Ale, and
gave the Patient to drink thereof morning and evening. This Medicine caused
many times a certain black bugge, or worm to come forth, which had many legs,
and was quick; and after that the Cancer would heal quickly with any
convenient Medicine.

CHAP. XXXIII. The healing of pockie Pustulaes, with Serpigo by W.H.
A Certain man having a number of sores all over his body' and a Serpigo in
the palm of his hand, so grievous, that a man might have laid great strawes
therein, was healed in this manner. First he was purged three times with six
grains of Turpetum minerale Phadronis, mixed with half a Dram of Amuletum
Palmarij. That done, he anointed all his sores twice ot thrice with Oleum
Tartari faetentis; afterward with Vnguentum ex Lithargirio Phioravante. Now
touching his hands, which had the Serpigo, he held them morning and evening
over a bath of oats, or some warm herbs, that they might sweat; and then
anointed them with Balsamum Sulphuris, and in short time they were helped. An
Unguent made with Saccarum Saturni, and oil of Roses, will do the like effect.

CHAP. XXXIIII. A Tetter or Ring-worme, cured by W. K.
THere is a certain Worm or Tetter, which many times comes on the back of
the hand or arm, and does corrode like a Serpigo, but it is none; which (after
the use of many other Medicines) has been cured in this manner. The place was
anointed five or six times a day, with the Sirrup of Sugar, that the Worm
might come to the upper place or skin; then within three or four days after,
he anointed the place with Oleum Tartari faetentis; and in short time he was
cured, though his disease had continued three years, coming and going. Some
have killed the Worm with Oleum vitrioli.

CHAP. XXXV. A man cured that was full of Tetters.
THis was the manner of his cure. He took the rennet of a Calfe, and drank it
in milk three or four times, and sweat thereupon; then he anointed the parts
affected with Saccarum Saturni, mixed with oil of Roses warm.

CHAP XXXVI. Totters in Women's breasts, oftentimes cured as follows.
THey took five spoonfulls of Madder, and boiled it in ale, and then strained
it clear, without pressing it at all, and drank thereof three or four mornings;
then with the foresaid oyntmnet they used to anoint the parts grieved, and
thereupon (with Gods help) were quickly healed.

CHAP. XXXVII. The healing of Shingles.
THey took for them Doves dung newly made, and barley meal, stamped them well,
and mixed them with half a pint of Vinegar; they used it cold to the place
grieved, and applied vine leaves (to keep in the Liquor) round about it. Then
they bound it up with clothes, and suffered it to lie three days, and then (if
need were) refreshed it again with a new Plaster, and at the most, with the
use of three Applications, it was perfectly helped.

CHAP. XXXVIII. The breaking of a plague sore, by W. K.
He took of Elder leaves, as much as was sufficient, he stamped them very
well with dry figs, and put thereto auxungiae porcinae, and applied it warm to
the sore, three or four times a day, and quickly brake it.

CHAP XXXIX. Scabs, and Itch, with small Pustulaes, taken quite away by I. H.
A Certain man greatly troubled with itch and pustulaes in his hands,
proceeding of a dissolved salt in his body, could find no help till he used
this course. He took Panchimagogon twice in three days; that done, he washed
his hands with the salt of Vitrioll dissolved in Plantaine water, and shortly
after they went quite away.

CHAP. XL. Three deep Fistulaes in the breast, cured by W. T.
THere was a certain man, called R. B. dwelling in London, which having three
deep Fistulaes in his breast, had been long under the hands of unskilful
Chirurgians, consuming both himself and his substance; but afterward by Gods
help, he using the course that W. T. prescribed, was cured very speedily. First
he was purged every second or third day, for five or six times together with
Turpetum minerale Phaedronis, receiving thereof five or six grains in Amul.
Palmarii; afterward he was caused to sweat five or six times with this potion
following.

. The distilled water of Lignum vitae. ii. Salis ejusdem. i. water of Carduus
benedictus. ii. which being mixed, he drunk it warm in the morning, and sweat
thereon two hours. After he was purged, he dressed the Fistulaes two hours
with this Unguent (until they were mundified) upon tents of shoe-leather. When
the Fistulaes were cleansed, he dressed them only with Emplastrum Fodicationis
(being made liquid to wrap up the tent with) till they were whole.

The mundificative Ointment was this.
. Oil of Wax, of S^ccinum, of Guaiacum, Oleum Hypericon, Compositum, ana.. ii.
mix them without fire, and use it with the aforesaid tents. Also you shall
note, that he drunk no other drink then this all the while.. Lignum vitae, the
bark, Sarsaparilla, ana.. iv. the roots of Tormentill, Bistorta, Virga
pastoris, Licorice, corice, ana.. ii, Juniper berries. i. Mallow leaves,
Sanicle, Alchimilla, Mugwort, Hypericon, Brunella, Comfery, ana. M. ii. Bring
these into powder, and for every gallon of new tunned drink, add thereto two
or three ounces of this powder in a linen cloth; let it stand till it be
stale, and let him drink thereof.

CHAP. XLI. The cure of Lichen, or Impetigo, by M. K.
A Certain Maiden 17. years old, had all the flesh on her thumb and
forefinger eaten away with the aforesaid disease, which was cured by strewing
thereon Saccarum Saturni, and applying thereto Cerottum magistrale Phioravante.

CHAP. XLII. A great Wen taken away, by W. H.
ONe that was troubled with a great Wen, had it taken away by washing it with
strong lie made of oaken ashes. I have been since told of a certainty, that if
ye rub the Wen often with the hand of a dead man, until the Wen wax hot, it
will consume away in short time after. Some roast an Egg hard, and cut it in
the midst, and lay it thereon, and using this often the Wen will wear away.

The Second Part concerning the Cures of internal diseases.
Thus much briefly in these short Chapters is expressed and declared,
concerning Wounds and Ulcers, wheresoever they be, or howsoever they arise; by
which examples, the learned Artist may undertake other things which are not
here mentioned: But in any ease let him be advised by the wise Physician in his
business, when there is any difficulty, and not run by and by to his receipt
or experiment. It follows now (in manner aforesaid) to set down the observed
practices of those that have cured internal diseases, which have taken effect,
and brought forth symptoms outwardly or inwardly.

CHAP. I. Of the cure of grievous Aches and pains, performed by W. H.
A Certain man was greatly afflicted with diverse woeful Aches, and pains in
his knees and shoulders, who was cured by receiving a dose of Aromatico, and by
application of Emplastrum faetidum unto the greived parts.

CHAP. II. The healing of Aches coming of the Pox, by W. H.
ONe of a very dark and melancholy complexion, to whom some men in London had
given the fume, and the unction three or four times; and yet left him possessed
with most pitiful Aches, and pain in his joints; who for want of
maintenance, was enforced to go into the country where he was born, and was
there pitied of an honest Gentleman, which cured him in this sort. First he
purged him twice or thrice with Aromatico Leonardo, which done, he took, for
four or five days together,. ss. of the extract of Hermodactiles with white
Wine; then unto the articular parts that were greived, he applied Emplastrum
faetidum, W. H. and thus in short time he was healed thoroughly.

CHAP. III. A notable experience of a Medicine that has brought great ease to
any great Ach, or pain, as of the Gout, or otherwise.
TAke one or two of the foremost sucking whelps of a Mastiff, or Bear-bitch,
kill them, and take forth the guts, fill them with black Snails, roast them, and
bast them with. xii. of oil of Spike colored with Saffron; reserve that which
droppeth from them, and mix it with as much oil of Wax, and therewith anoint
any ach or grief.

CHAP. IIII. A particular way, whereby the pain of the Gout is soon eased or
prevented, S. N.
TAke Minium, the yolk of an Egg, oil of Tartar, oil of Roses, as much of each
as you think sufficient, and with a little Saffron make it in form of a
plaster, and lay it on cold. I knew another Gentleman greivously vexed with
the Gout, who was in this sort soon eased. First when he supposed that the pain
would come, he took a dose of Aromatico Leonardo, then the next day, unto those
greived parts he applied this plaster. Take a pickle herring and cut forth the
bone, stamp it very small with a little bole Armoniacke, and Rosewater, and
apply it cold to the grief, from place to place as it goes. Many men after
they have been well purged, have had great ease by anointing the place three
or four nights together with Aqua Balsami Phioravante, also Oleum Cerae is very
profitable in that case.

CHAP V. The cure of Gouts, and all Aches coming of heat, by L. F.

sleep, and were in manner frantic, have taken five or six grains of Laudanum,
with conserve of Succorie flowers, and therewith were speedily delivered out of
their extremities.

Pestilent Fevers, with great thirst cured by I. H.
FIrst they were purged once or twice with Aromatico Leonardo, then was the
stomach comforted with some pectorall Potion. That being done, there was Barley
water made with Raisins, Liquorice, and cool herbs, if you may have them. Then
strein it clean, and put therein as much Oleum vitrioli as will make it tart,
like a Pomegranate. Drink thereof when you are dry, for it comforts nature,
asswageth heat and thirst wonderfully, opens all obstructions, and defends
the body from putrified Fevers ^f they be grieved with the headache, you shall
cause them to be let blood under the tongue, cutting those veins over-thwart,
and they shall presently be cured.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Against Poison, or the Pestilence, a Diaphoreticall Potion, by
W. T.
REcipe Myrrhae, croci, ana ii. Amuleti Palmarii i. Spiritus vini, lb i. Oleum
piperis, Oleum gingiberis, ana i. mix them in a glass, and give thereof ss. in
old Sack at once against the Pestilence or Poison.

CHAP. XXXIX. Signs of death in the Plague, W. K.
TAke a quick Frog, and lay it with the belly next the sore; if the party
will escape, the Frog will burst in a quarter of an hour. Then lay on another,
and this you shall do till no more do burst, for they draw forth the venom. I
have been told, that a dried toad will in better sort do the same. If none of
the Frogs do burst, the party will not escape, this has been often proved.

CHAP. XL. Counsel, antidotes, and Preservatives against Infectious airs, on
the water, or land, by W. T.
YOu shall use to chew, or hold in your mouth, a little of Essentia Angelicae.
Also it would be very profitable to drink three or four drops of the same
fasting. Also Oleum Camphorae being drunk effects the same. In like manner,
aqua balsami Phioravante, if it be drunk in the morning with Wine, or Alum,
preserves a man from all poison and pestilent airs: and is a most singular
remedy against surfets, or the Pestilence. Also, if you be in any infected
ship, or house, it were necessary to wear a bag of Saffron under your armpits
to defend the heart.

Also it were very necessary to drink two or three drops of the essence of
Saffron for the same purpose.

Amuletum Palmarii is also very excellent, being taken in the morning fasting.

Dissolved Pearl, eaten or drunk, defends the heart, purifieth the blood, and
reviveth the spirits above all other things. You may make it in Lozanges, or
drink it in any cordial, in what quantity you will.

CHAP. XLI. An Inveterate Gonorrhaea, either in man or woman, oftentimes cured,
by W. T.
MAny have been cured of this, and such like infirmities with this composition
following. Among the rest, one Gentleman in Buckinghamshire, who was vexed
therewith above seven years continually.

A Gentlewoman also was so grievously afflicted with flux. albo, that she waxed
lame, and went with a staff: these were both cured in 12 days. But one thing
must be remembered, that if it come ex lue venerea, it were necessary, first to
be purged, and then to use these Pills.

An Electuarie against Gonorrhea, by W. T.
A Certain man, being troubled with a stinking Gonorrhea, was in this order
cured. First he was purged with Aromatico Leonardo; the next day he took a pill
or two of Venice Turpentine, washed in plantain water; that done, he used to
eat morning and evening the quantity of an hazel nut of this Electuarie until
he was helped, which was not long after.

time he anointed the reins, with the foresaid Unguent.

CHAP. XLII. The immoderate Flux menstruall, suppressed, or stayed by W. T.
A Certain woman being grievously weakened with that disease, and having great
heat and pain in her body, was thus cured. Take the roots of Orpine, and
Comfery, thinn sliced, Clary, q. v. boil them with a Chicken, and with that
broth make Almond milk, and to every handful of Almonds add. i. of Laudanum
nostrum, Grind them well together, and drink thereof morning and evening. Also
you shall anoint the reins and grieved parts with the unguent mentioned in
the Chapter aforegoing.

Another aginst the same.
I Was informed that the powder of a Land-Frog bound about the woman's neck,
does stay the foresaid Flux.

CHAP. XLIII. A Flux stopped by G. F.
DIssolve Bay Salt in Malmesey, and therewith wash the soles of your feet, and
in three or four days it will stay the Flux. Diverse Soldiers in the Wars
have been cured thereof by setting their Fundament in warm Horse dung. Also the
powder of red-Roses drunk in red-wine is very profitable for the stopping of
the Flux.

Bloody Flux of long continuance cured by W. T.
REcipe conserve of red Roses, Marmalade of Quinces, electuary of Sulphur of
Leonardo Phioravante his description, of each two ounces, Amuletum Palmarii,

others.
TAke Mullen, and fry it with Butter, and therewith anoint the part diverse
times.

The oil of Eggs is a notable remedy to withdraw the said infirmity.

Balsamum sulphuris anointed upon them, does with great speed and good
success cure them: this also has been oftentimes proved very excellent.

If they be anointed with Oleum Tartari faetentis, it dries them up in short
time. But first it were necessary to purge the body of the melancholic
original of that disease, both by vomit and seege.

Some use to take them away, by applying a caustic unto them.

The cure of Ficus in ano, ex lue venerea performed by I. P.
MAny have been sore troubled with Warts or Blathers in the fundament, which
have in very short time been cured by anointing them with Balsamum Tartari
faetentis. Among other men there was a strong lusty fellow, fifty years old, of
complexion melancholy, which was beastly bewraied with the Pox, about whose
fundament or Longanon, there remained twelve or fourteen growing, whereof some
were so big as a little Figg, all of them did run or yield a loathsome yellow
sanies or matter. This man was cured with Balsamum Tartari faetentis, without
any pain to him; and the warts were so dried, that they were pulled off with a
pair of mullets: after which he remained whole. This man was healed in
Bedfordshire.

The end of the second part of this Collection.
A Supplement, or Addition unto the former Collection.
This Appendix or Addition contains both Philosophical discourses, of the
causes and cures of diverse and sundry diseases: as also many pithie discourses,
of the virtues and use of many Vegetables, Animals, etc. culled and translated
out of the Physics and Surgery of Sir Leonardo Phioravante, and left to
pass forth in print with this Collection.

CHAP. I. Of pain in the head.
THe pain in the head is an infirmity, whose cause until this time has not
been sufficiently known, as by mine own experience shall prove unto you.

All, or the most part of Physicians in the world do hold this position, that
pain in the head is no other thing, then vapors ar^sing from the stomach, and
ascending unto the head, which do offend membrana, whereupon ensues pain.
Herein they speak some part of the truth; but (in my judgment) they are not
yet come perfectly to know all the cause of this infirmity: for I see, that in
the cures, which these Theoricks would perform, it falls not out according to
their expectation and desire, for that they know not the whole, or the
principal cause of the malady, therefore what certain Medicine can they find
out to cure the infirmity? They may perchance (as the blind man hits the Crow)
help they know not what; which thing I speak not to back-bite or injury any of
them, but to tell them, out of love that I bear to them and others, the whole
and true cause of that, whereof heretofore they have been ignorant. The first
cause is putrified blood in Leonichi: The second is the vapors that ascend
from the stomach and offend the head: The third is the humidity or moisture
between the skin and the flesh: So that the causes are three, and the remedies
as many to dissolve the Antecedent causes. I have now showed thee the original
and root of the pain in the head, about which thou shall never more need to
beat thy head, or break thy brains, either in seeking the Aphorisms of
Hyppocrates, the Commentary of Galen, or the Authority of Avicen, for in these
four or few words I have said all. Now of the cure of this disease, as I have
experimented the same an infinite sort of times in my life, which way soever
the cause comes, work thou after this manner, and thou shall never sustain
blame or discredit.

When the pain in the head is confirmed, and that thou can find no help by
common Theorick or Practick do these things following. First let them blood on
Leonichie, cutting it overthwart, and let the Patient spit as much as he can;
then the next morning let them take our Aromatico fasting; the next day let the
head be shaven, and lay thereon an attractive plaster, drawing out the
humidity, whereof I have made mention in my Caprici medicinale; in the end,
cause them to sneeze, and hereby all the pain in the head will cease.

CHAP. II. Of the Catarre, and rhume in the head.
THe Catarre is a moist vapor which assaulteth the head, and afterward
falls down again into the stomach, where it ingrosseth and corrupts. This
moisture has his beginning of the moisture of the Lungs, and until such time
as the Lungs be discharged thereof, the Catarre will continue in his force.
This infirmity reigns more in phlegmatic and melancholy bodies, then in any
of other constitutions: Such as are troubled with it are not long lived,
because their Lungs consume by little and little, and thereupon they are
troubled with the Ptisick, and consequently they perish if they be not quickly
releived. I will now show thee a rare secret to cure the same.

Take Pulmonaria, and Sena, that is fresh and new, infuse them in wine and
water over a small or gentle fire, till the wine have drawn out the virtue;
then strain it, and put thereunto our Quintessence, and keep it close in a
glass, let the Patient drink thereof every morning. iii. luke warm for twenty
days together; let him eat good nourishing meats, for they agree well with
this disease: If the Patient be not too far spent, you shall see your cure
performed in short time: In the mean while, if the Patient be weak, you shall
give him new laid Eggs, and good white Wine: If the humidity be perceived not
to be quite expelled and evacuated, then give him our Aromatico, afterward
comfort him again with Restoratives and Cordials to make him strong, and no
doubt, by the help of God he shall be cured. This method of curing this
infirmity, differs from the common course that Physicians take, which would
cure it with diet, bleeding, and mollifying liniments, and causing them to
spit, and such like, which are means rather to augment the Catarre, then to
diminish the same.

The second course to cure the descension, that comes from the head to the
stomach.
USe these five things if you will cure this disease; 1. our Electuario
Angelica. 2. Quintessence solutive. 3. our Pillulae pro descenso. 4. Unguents
for the stomach and head. 5. our Quintessence vegetable. The Electuary
cleanses the head and stomach; the Quintessence solutive evacuateth the body;
the Pills take away the cause of the descension; the Unguents dry; and the
vegetable Quintessence preserves the body from all ill and noisome
infirmities. The Electuary must be taken first in the morning; of the
Quintessence solutive you must take a spoonful in the morning in a little
broth and sugar, keeping a reasonable good diet, and do this four or six
days; then take the Pills in the evening, and in the mean time anoint the
head and stomach with Oleum Cerae, and drink every morning a little of our
Quintessence, which if you do use continually (by the blessing of God upon it)
there is no doubt, but the body shall be free from many troublesome maladies.

There was a certain woman of the age of 58. years, who being greatly troubled
with a Catarrhe, was cured by the use of our Aqua preservans morning and
evening, and by anointing the stomach with Balsamo.

One that was affected with a Catarrhe, and a stitch in the side, was thus
cured. He took our Aromatico twice; then he took every morning a spoonful of
our Quintessence solutive with the broth of a Capon, for seven or eight days
together; and every night when he went to bed, he anointed his stomach with
Oleum Incompostibile, and thereby was soon after cured.

A woman that had great pain in her head and stomach, and had her menstrues
stopped, with loss of her appetite, was thus helped.

First she took two doses of our Pillulae Angelicae; that done, she took every
morning a spoonful of Quinta essentia solutiva, with broth and sugar, for five
or six mornings together; after that she took every morning one spoonful of
our Aqua preservans, whereupon in short time after she was cured.

A Contusion in the head.
A Certain man had a great fall from an Horse, wherewith he bruised his head
most greivously, who was cured in four days, by anointing the place with
Oleum benedictum nostrum.

The taking away or healing of the white Scall.
THis noisome malady is perfectly cured, by purging the Patients with our
Aromatico, and anointing the head with our Oleum Philosophorum.

Also the Artificial Balsom of our description does the like, and Oleum
benedictum nostrum effects the same.

Pain in the eyes, with great dimnesse of sight.
A Certain man that had great pain in his eyes, and was almost blind, recovered
his sight by letting blood under the tongue; the next day he took Aromatico
once, after that he used our Quintessence solutive seven or eight days
together, and every night he anointed his stomach with Oleum Cerae rectified;
then was dropped into his eyes our Quintessence for the eyes, and thereof was
he well cured.

An Unguent for sore eyes
TAke Rosewater. Fennel, and Eufrage water, ana. put therein a small quantity
of Verdigreace, and boil it a little on the fire; then let it settle till it be
clear, and pour it off. With this water see that you wash Auxungia porcina
seven or eight times, and of that put a little into the eye when ye go to bed.

To cure or stay the spitting of blood.
ONe that spit blood was cured in ten days, by drinking the liquour of Honey
morning and evening Another was healed by drinking the decoction of Mint in
Vinegar: another by drinking of Crocus martis.

The description and cure of the Sqinancie.
THis disease is a windy moisture, and a suffocation of blood, as you may see
by experience, that such as are possessed therewith, have a great alteration,
or many changes of Fevers, with a swelling in the throat, and many times, if it
be not quickly helped, it will choke them, and this is the cure thereof. You
shall give them. i. of the powder of a wild Boares tooth, with. iii. of oil of
Linseed, and forthwith by the help of God they shall be greatly eased.

CHAP. III. The description, and manifold cures, of the disease called
Scrophulae, or forunculi, which some do call waxing kernels, but rather the
Kings Evil.
THe Scrophulae or waxing kernels (so called of some) which use to come in the
throat, or other parts of the bodies of young children, do arise and are
caused of great quantity of melancholy humors, because that does for the most
part reign in persons that are weak of complexion; for you may easily see, that
such as are vexed with that infirmity, are not very quick spirited. These
Scrophulae are a long time ere they will come to suppuration; and before they
break, and when they are broken, they cause excessive pain, and are hard to be
cured: For all infirmities that come of melancholy, are troublesome to cure, or
resolve, as you may see in the Quartain, and such like. But here I will show
thee a secret to cure these Scrophulae. First you must remove the cause, and
then cure the effects, for otherwise it were impossible to cure them with
outward Medicines. This melancholy is purged with our Sirrup against
melancholy, which you must use eight or ten days, the dose is about. iv. cold;
that done, give them our Aromatico, which cleanses the head and stomach, and
purifieth the blood. As touching local Medicines to break it, you shall lay
thereon our Caustic 24. hours, which mortifieth and dries, for it will draw
forth a great deal of moisture; after this anoint it with our Magno liquore
until the escare be fallen out, and when it is mundified, apply thereon the
Cerot of Gualtifredo di Medi, and use no other Medicine, for it will incarnate,
and siccatrize without scarre.

Another cure for Scrophulae.
A Certain young boy of 14. years, of complexion choleric and melancholy,
who had Scrophulae in his throat on both the sides, was cured thus. The first
Medicine that he took was the Infusion of Rhubarb, with the Trochisches of
Agarick, and acetum squilliticum, and water of Maidenhair mixed together, which
he used by the space of ten days. Then was laid upon the Scrophulae, a
plaster of Cerot magistrale with Cantharides, which drew forth the malignitie
of the Ulcer, and great store of Sanies, being applied for 15 days together.
This done, I gave him the decoction of Salsaparilla, with a good diet for
twenty days together. Then I applied unto the sore a Cerot of Gualtifredo di
Medi, which in a short time cured him, that had been vexed with them four
years before.

Another for the same.
ANother which was a maid of 13. years of age, was vexed with Scrophulae in her
throat, which was also in this manner cured. First, gave her the extract of
Elleborus niger, with mel Rosarum, which does very effectually purge the
melancholy humor. That done, I gave her our Sirrup against the melancholy
humor, for eight or ten days together, and applied unto the sores an Unguent
of Litarge, boiled with the powder of Scrophularia, thus was she in short time
perfectly cured.

Another against Scrophulae.
REcipe Verdigrease, Pelitorie of Spain, Dock root, the Juice of Leeks, of the
Herb Scrophularis, ana, mix them, and lay on lint, and apply it unto the
Scrophulae, but take some care thereof.

CHAP. IIII. Of Panaricium, or Panaricies, called the Whitblow.
THis grievous and intolerable malady, (as those know well that have felt
them) comes on the end of the finger, and is an infirmity bred in the liver,
whereof nature being willing to discharge her self, sends it to the extreme
parts of the fingers, and most commonly it comes to the finger next the thumb,
but seldom in the other. The reason or cause whereof is hidden, save that we
may conjecture (as we have said before) an accident in the Liver, which nature
sends forth unto those parts to ease her self. When it comes to the end of
the finger, that it can go no further, it causes a sharp and excessive pain;
and the accident coming unto that place, not having passage, is so hot, that in
short time it putrifieth the sinews, muscles, and cartilages, and in the end
rotteth both flesh and bone. The secret of this grief is not commonly known of
the most Chirurgians, who with all their learning cannot devise to cure it as
it ought to be cured. The most part of such as have that infirmity lose their
finger; but if thou will quickly help them, follow this method.

First, let them bleed on the Liver vein, then let them be well purged.
Afterward dress the finger, with Oleum Sulphuris, which will cause some pain,
nevertheless (to have some ease) you must abide it. The next day dress it
with Magno liquore until it be whole, which will be in short time, as I have
often proved.

CHAP. V. Of grievous Ulcers in Women's Breasts.
FIrst they must be touched with Oleum Sulphuris, then make this Unguent. Take
the yolks of Eggs, ii. Turpentine, Butter, Barlie flower, Honey of Roses, ana,
ss. incorporate them all in a mortar, and therewith dress them, until they be
whole. But if they come of any kind, or spice of the pox this unguent will be
to very small purpose. But then shall you dress them, with our Vnguento magno,
which is appropriate unto the disease, and look that you purge them with our
Aromatico.

CHAP VI. Of the disease called Astma, and the cure thereof.
THis disease which is called the Ptisick, is a certain infirmity contained in
the lungs, which does harden and dry them in such manner, that such as are
troubled therewith cannot fetch their breath. It proceeds of adustion of the
blood, that can not run into the veins: and so the lungs lacking sustenance
worsteth that effect. This disease is cured four manner of ways. First, you
shall let them blood under the tongue, cutting those veins overthwart, and
suck them as much as they can: for it evacuateth and opens the opilation of
the blood, and eases the lungs of all that evil matter which offends.
Secondly, you shall give them a dose of Aromatico, which evacuateth the stomach
of all evil qualities that offend the Lungs. The third is, to let them eat for
a month together every morning. i of our Electuario de Althea. The fourth, to
anoint the stomach every night with Magno liquore. But every ten days you
must take a dose of our Electuario Angelica, whereby thou shall help them
quickly. You must also keep a sober diet, refraining Fish, Porke, slimie
things, spice, baked meats, cheese, and such like, which nourish grosely, and
do infect the blood.

CHAP. VII. To know the Dropsy confirmed in a man, the cure whereof is showed
in xxxii. Chapter of the second part of the Collection
THere are three signs or tokens of a confirmed Dropsy. First, look whether
the tongue be white and cold: Then whether the yard be shrunk into the belly.
And lastly if there do any veins appear on the belly. If you perceive these
they are infallible declarations of a confirmed Dropsy.

CHAP. VIII. An excellent remedy against Worms.
YOu shall give the Patient two drachms of our Vnguento magno to drink with Mel
Rosarum, three mornings together anoint the nostrils therewith, and in three
days they will be expelled, were they never so many.

CHAP. IX. Of the hardness of the Milt, and the cure thereof.
THe Spleen or Milt is hardened by reason of superfluous humidity, that it
takes from the Liver and Lungs. Therefore if you will help this infirmity, it
were necessary to use medicines abstersive and drying, which thou shall do thus
First give them our Aromatico, then let them use this Electuray, which is of
mervellous virtue in that operation. Take Crocus martis, Scolopendria, ana.. i.
Spicknard, Lapis lazuli, ana.. ii. Cinnamon,. ss. mix them, and make an
Electuary thereof with purified honey, and take thereof every morning one
spoonful, and every night (two hours before supper) another spoonful, and
anoint the outward part where the grief is with our Balsamo Artificiato, and
in short time the disease shall be cured.

Another remedy very effectual for the former disease
LEt them blood on the two veins under the tongue. That done mix mustard seed
with the Urine of a Boy, and lay it between two clothes, and apply it to the
part affected one night, and then (if thou feel not good ease) use it again
till the disease be gone. Also the decoction of Oak helps the swelling of the
Milt.

CHAP. X. Of the Gonorrhaea or running of the reins, and the cure.
THis disease is a corruption caused of the superfluous use of women, that are
infected therewith: for such men as have knowledge of them, they receive the
said corruption, which afterward comes forth of the yard with great pain and
difficulty in making water: and moreover in the night, when that part is
erected, it causes great torment: which for fifteen or twenty days causes
extreme pain. This is the beginning of the French Pox, a fit sauce for that
sweet sin of Letchery. It brings most commonly pain in the interior parts,
or pain in the reins, arms, and legs: insomuch that in fine it comes to that
foul disease. For such as have this Gonorrhaea, never suspecting or fearing
the after-claps, suffer their disease to grow on further and further till their
cure will very hardly or never be accomplished. Therefore I wish every man to
seek help in time, least by letting it pass, in the end it turn to his
destruction. The cure is as follows.

First you shall give them our Aromatico once in white Wine; Then morning and
evening for seven or eight days use this potion following: anointing also the
reins and those parts with our Aqua faetida being cold, and in short time they
shall be healed.

. The whites of four or five new laid Eggs, of fine Sugar,. ii. of Rose Water,.
iii. mix them well, and drink it morning and evening. This is a rare secret,
and often proved, the drink must be drunk cold.

CHAP. XI. Of the Emeroids, and their cure.
THe Emeroides are an alteration in the Emeroidall veins, caused of a corrupt
and putrified humor, whereof nature being willing to discharge her self,
sends forth by those veins unto the extreme or outward parts, where it
cannot pass through, and causes the alteration and inflammtion that is caled
the Emeroides. This corruption and putrefaction is caused of the evil quality
of the Liver, which corrupts the blood, and is the cause of all this
inconvenience. Commonly the original and beginning thereof is caused of the
Pox, a thing that must be considered of in the cure. Now for the cure, it were
necessary to help the Liver, to purify the blood, to alter the Emeroides, and
to discharge nature of that impediment. First, therefore give them our
Electuario Angelica, the next day they shall take our Sirrupo solutivo, whereof
they shall take five or six doses. Then let them anoint the Emeroids with our
Caustic, once or twice, and they shall soon after be cured.

Of the diverse sorts and diverse effects of the Emeroides, and their cure.
BY reason of this disease that comes always at the end of Intestino, or
Longanon, some have marvelous pain about the fundament, some burn wonderfully,
and others do scald: which comes because of the good or bad qualities in
some, more then in other some, as experience shows. For (as I said) some have
such a burning, that they can take no rest, some have such pain as they cannot
sit, some have it so scalding hot that it is intolerable. Though this
infirmity is more hurtful in one complexion then in another, and the cure
hard, yet you shall cure them in this manner.

First, give them Aromatico, then purge the body five or six times with our
Sirrupo solutivo. Then give him our fume at the lower parts, three or four
times, and then anoint the parts with our Balsamo Artisiciato, for that will
dry and take away the pain altogether, and the Patient shall be surely healed.

There are diverse kinds of Emeroides, but two in principal. The one sort is in
the fundament, and causes great pain when they go to the stool. The other
sort comes forth of the fundament and are not so painful as the first. To
cure those within the fundament, you shall give the Patient eight or ten days
together our Sirrupo magistrale warm, then let them take our Aromatico once,
and use Glisters, wherein is put half an ounce of Aqua reale Phioravante at a
time, and so thou shall help them. The best way for those that are come forth,
is to make incision, or to make a little hole in them, that the blood which is
putrified may come forth, and so by evacuation thou shall help them. Also you
shall understand that vomiting is very necessary in the cure of both sorts,
because it opens the veins. Also Oleum ovorum does ease the pain of the
Emeroides very greatly; so does the oil of Figs if you anoint them therewith.
The tooth of an horse-fish being worn in a ring on the finger, after the body
is purged, takes them away by a secret and hidden quality, a thing proved more
then an hundred times.

CHAP. XII. Of the cure of such as were troubled with suffocation of the Matrix.
A Certain woman affected therewith, having much pain and grief in her
stomach, was cured by taking a dose of our Electuario Angelica. Then she used
our sirrup against pains of the Mother eight or ten days, and annoted her
stomach with Magno liquore every night.

A certain young woman afflicted in manner aforesaid, wanted also her natural
sickness; and began to loose her natural heat, so that nature could not
digest, the superfluous matter in her body was thus helped. First, she took our
Electuario angelica, and every night anointed her stomach, nostrils, and
pulses with Magno liquore, and every morning drunk of our Quintessence, and so
was cured.

CHAP. XIII. To cure a rupture in the beginning.
IN every ten days, once, give them our Aromatico, and every morning fasting
give them one ounce of white Tartar in water or wine, and two hours before
Supper you shall take the like: Let your bread be Rye, also you must wear a
trusse fit for that purpose, and use this remedy following. Take of the
spirit of wine,. xii. Frankincense, Olibanum, Mastick, Sarcocolla, ana. ss:
infuse them in the said Aqua vitae, and therewith wash the rupture twice a day,
then presently cast thereon the powder of Bislingisa, and the herb Balsaminae,
and lay thereon a cloth, wet in the said water, and bind on the trusse so hard
as he may possible abide it, and hereby shall thou heal any great rupture in an
hundred days, but see that you keep a diet accordingly.

Another for the same.
TAke very stiff and thick paper well gummed, chew it in thy mouth till it be
soft: then lay it upon the rupture, and wear thereon a trusse fit for the
purpose.

Some use to steep the paper in lie, and wring the same out till it be dry, and
apply it to the rupture, changing it once in twenty four hours.

CHAP. XIIII. Of retention of Urine, and the cure thereof.
THe retention of Urine arises of many causes; one is gravel that stops
the Conduits where it should pass; another is the want or weakness of the
virtue expulsive, so that nature cannot expel; another is a carnosity, which
is an alteration caused of corrupt and putrified humors; which do so restrain
the pores and Urine, that it cannot pass; there is another, and that is
viscosity of the reins, so gross, that it hinders the Urine from passing:
another cause, which is too too common, is the Gonorrhaea, when it changes
into Stranguria, that it is a stopping or choking of the Conduits that carry
the Urine to the Bladder. All these aforesaid causes proceed of one original,
even of the distemperature of nature, whereof if you ask the reason, you shall
understand, that it arises of that filthy beginning the French Pox. That which
moves me to believe it, is the observation thereof diverse and sundry times,
for I have cured many that were infected with the Pox, which were troubled,
some with Carnosity (before spoken of) some with gravel, some with debility of
the virtue expulsive, some with Gonorrhaea: all which when I had cured of the
Pox, the other distemperatures were therewith also cured. For that disease is
the cause of twenty mischiefs, and the reason why many Physicians make a long
cure of the former distemperatures is, for that they know not the maine and
principal cause of them. But now I will show thee a true and excellent manner
of curing the retention of Urine, which way soever it comes.

First give them a dose of Aromatico, then give unto them our Sirrupo solutivo
eight or ten days, but in any wise keep no straight diet, but a good
government, as you do most commonly use, and eat such meat as pleases the
stomach best: cause them also to sweat, and in short time thou shall thoroughly
cure them,

CHAP. XV. A most excellent remedy to cure the difficulty of Urine.
THe difficulty or retention of Urine, caused diverse ways, as of gravel,
viscositie, exulceration, etc. is in this sort very well and safely cured. When
the cause of this difficulty of Urine is in the reins or kidneys, so that it
be not a stone in the kidneys, or some great store of gravel, see that thou
work thus.

. Rognoni of a male Hare, boil it in good Wine, when it is well boiled, stamp
it small, and pass it through a strainer with the said liquor wherein it was
boiled. Remember that when you boil it, there must not remain much liquor in
the vessel. Then take the said matter that you strained, and put thereto as
much purified honey, and boil it on a soft fire until it come to the form of
an Electuary. When it is boiled, put thereto for every pound of that Electuary
these things following made into fine powder; of Lignum Alo^s, of Cinnamon,
ana.. i. Cloves, Saffron, ana.. i. Musk, four grains, Aqua Rosar^m, i. our
Quintessence,. i. ss. Incorporate these well together while it is warm, and
keep it in a glass close stopped: And when you will use it, you must first take
a dose of our Electuario Angelico, and while you use the Electuary remember to
anoint the reins with our Aqua faetida when you go to bed. Of the Electuary
you must take. i. in the morning, and fast thereon four hours, and use some
exercise, and in short time thou shall see a mavelous good work performed.
For the Reins will be strengthened, the viscosity will be resolved, the pores
will be opened, and the Urine will be expelled, and cleansed, all which are
effects necessary for him to regard, that will with honesty and credit, help
the former mallady.

Another often proved.
If thou will presently help one that cannot make water, by reason of wind,
viscosity, or other grievous cause, vexing the party, anoint their reins, and
all the privy parts with our Balsamo Artificiato, and keep them very warm, and
forthwith they shall make water, to their great satisfaction.

Retention of the Urine, with stitch in the side.
ONe was in very short time cured of these infirmities, after he had taken our
Aromatico, and anointed him in manner above specified, with our Balsamo
Artificiato.

CHAP. XVI. The swelling of the leg and foot, cured in manner following,
F^rst, the Patient took one dose of Aromatico, then he used our Quintessence
solutive three or four mornings together in a little broth; that done, he drunk
every morning a little of our Quintessence vegetable, fasting, and every night
he anointed his leg with Oleum Philosophorum nostrum: also now and then he
took a dose of Pillulae Angelicae to keep the body soluble, he kept a
reasonable good diet, he used not much walking, so that very shortly after he
was well cured.

CHAP. XVII. Of Chilblaines and their cures.
YOu shall understand, that Chilblaines (as we term them) are caused of no
other thing, then of humors dried and restrained in our bodies: For in the
winter, when it is cold, the pores do shut so close together, that the humor
cannot pass or come forth, neither by sweat, nor other exhalation or
expiration: For that cause, the humors in a young man (who is h^t of
complexion) may not be kept in, for then nature (which would ease her self)
sends that exhalation unto the extreme parts of the body, that is, unto the
hands and feet; where remaining, there is caused that alteration, and in
process of time, the skin does open, and the humor goes forth, but cannot
heal till the Spring, when warm weather comes in. Howbeit I have found out a
Secret to cure them quickly, and with great ease. First, let them blood, then
give them a dose of our Electuario Angelico: After that let them take our
Sirrupo solutivo six or seven days together, not keeping any straight diet or
rule. After this, anoint them with Oleum Philosophorum de Cera and
Terebinthina, at night when they go to bed: and do thus one week at the least,
and then no doubt thou shall cure them as I have often proved. Also the oil
and water of Frankincense will do the like.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Corns on the Feet, and the manner to take them away.
THe Corns that come on the feet, are a kind of hard Tumor, or thick
excrescence, caused of corrupt and putrified humors, whereof Nature being
willing to discharge her self, sends them to the lower part of the feet, from
whence, because they cannot pass, there do they make a residence: ingendering
that kind of tough excrescence, which is grievous and painful. Many times the
cause hereof arises of that noisome disease, Morbus Gallicus, as some write,
and then must it be remedied with Medicaments appropriate thereunto. But if
they come otherwise, then to take them away, follow this order. When they are
in their greatest state, and cause most pain, cut them until they bleed, then
anoint them with our Balsamo artificiato, applying it so hot as you may suffer
it; thereupon go to bed. Then touch them once or twice with Oleum sulphuris,
and anoint them with Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina and Cera, until they
be whole.

Some take the juice of Sempervivum, and anoint the corns therewith. Then
they take wormwood, and lay it upon a hot tile stone, and sprinkle it with
strong Vinegar, and being hot, bind it upon the corns, and in three or four
times so doing (as I have been credibly certified) the corns will be taken
away.

CHAP. XIX. Of an Infirmity that comes on the fingers ends, and in the feet,
under the nails, and the cure^ of it.
MAny men are greatly troubled herewith, and in such manner, as thereby they
are made altogether unfit to go. It comes on the great toe, under the nail,
or the side of the nail for the most part; and a man would think that the nail
grew in the flesh, but it is not so, for the flesh grows upon the nail;
though this infirmity appear not to be a thing of great Importance (whereof
the ancient writers have made little mention) yet is it a thing greatly to be
regarded. For many great personages that live easily, and are tormented with
the gout, have also this grief in those parts, but the order to cure them is
this. First, you shall cut the nail on that part where it most grieveth them;
then take it away, which you may do easily without any great pain to the
Patient: for the nail is already separated from the grieved place. Thus when
the nail is taken away, touch it with our Causticke, whereof mention is made
in our Treatise of the plague. Let it so remain three days together, then
dress it every day with Magno liquore until it be whole, which will be in a
very short time.

CHAP. XX. Of Erisipela, and the cure thereof.
THis disease (as experience shows) is caused of an hot and fiery moisture,
arising in the face, arms and legs, for where it is, the powers and pores are
stopped that the said moisture cannot have expiration, whereupon comes tumor,
as also a shutting and closing up of those pores, by means of the ordinary
anointing them with fats, oils, etc. or other cold things, a common course
used of common Chirurgians. Against this there cannot be found a more present
remedy then the spirit of wine, or Aqua ardens, or bathing it with hot water,
and if you wash the parts affected with our Quintessence, the Pores will be
opened, and it penetrateth and assubtiliateth that humiditie, causing it to
come forth.

Also you shall find that by drinking our Quintessence and anointing the
stomach with Oleum cerae, diverse are cured of a certain heat retained in the
stomach.

CHAP. XXI. The cure of Warts.
THere is an Herb called in the Italian tongue Herba di vento: in the juice
whereof if you wet a cloth, and bind it upon the warts, they will wear away in
short time after.

The End of the first Part of the Appendix.
The Second Part of the Appendix or Addition unto this Collection, containing
the Use and Virtues, of sundry Vegetables, Animals, etc. gathered out of the
Physics of Sir Leonardo Phioravante.
CHAP. I. Of the Use, and virtues of Ebulus or Danewort.
TAke the buds of this Vegetable, when they are young and green, perboil them
in water, and make thereof a Sallad, and give it unto those that have costive
bodies, and it will provoke them to the stool. It is an herb very profitable
for the sinews, it comfort the weak parts, and preserves such, as are weak
in the joints from many accidents: it purges phlegm, which) for the most part)
causes debilitie of the Nerves. Whosoever uses to drink of a Sirrup made of
the Berries thereof, shall not be troubled with the gout, nor any disease in
the articular parts. The seed dried is profitable against all infirmities
caused of humidity.

CHAP II. Of Eleborus niger, and the use thereof.
THe root of black Hellebore being dried and kept two years, may be safely used
without other preparation, and may be ministered against any infirmity that
has his original of a melancholy cause. Therefore it is most appropriate
against the Fever quartane, and lunatic persons vexed with melancholy.

CHAP. III. Of the Use and Virtues of the Herb called Gratia Dei, a kind of
Geranium, in English, Blew Storks Bill.
TAke of Gratia Dei, dried in the shadow, and beaten into fine powder,. i.
Cinnamon i. cloves, i. wheat flower, lb i. Oranges condite, i. make thereof a
past with honey, and bake it in the oven with bread, but take great heed that
it burn not. Of this you shall give i. to purge against many Infirmities; but
above the rest against Scrophulae, against scabs and the white scall. For it
evacuateth only the superfluous humiditie of the body, it dries, and is
appropriate for such kind of infirmities. Howbeit you must note, that all
soluble Medicines are not fit for one disease or complexion, for chiefly and
properly, Rhubarb purges choler, black Hellebore avoideth melancholy,
Danewort dispossesseth the body of phlegm, and this herb cleanses the blood,
Therefore every one has his peculiar property, though sometime either of them
may work upon more causes then one, yet not so properly or simply, but by
accident, and in regard of circumstances.

Two drachms of the powder of this herb drunk in wine or broth, provokes
vomit and seege, and is very good for such as are lunatike. It helps, or at
the least, delayeth the extremity of the Fever. It is good against griefs of
the stomach, and wind in the belly.

A decoction thereof made with lie helps putrified Ulcers, if they be washed
therewith; for as it purges the stomach, so it cleanses the sore, and heals
it quickly; if you wet a cloth in the said lie, and apply it thereunto.

CHAP. IIII. Of Rubarb, and his virtues.
THe herb called in the Italian tongue Lappacia maggiore, or Rombice
domestice, is a kind of Rubarb, which among the learned Herbalistes is termed
by the name of Rha recentiorum, whereof. i. when it is new, will lose the body,
evacuate choler, as the Rhabarbarum does. It is very good against oppilations,
it purges the blood, and takes away scabs.

You shall have a most precious Medicine thereof, if you mix the green root
with Honey, Cinnamon, Saffron, Ginger, and the powder of Roses.

If you roast the root in the embers, and mix it with condited Sugar, it
breaks the Scrophulae, and mundifieth them, and heals them in short time.
Some do mix it with the gum, called Ammoniacum, and so do bring it into the
form of an Unguent, and apply it unto the parts affected with Scrophulae.

CHAP. V. Of Tithymale, and his virtues.
GAther the herrb Tithymale (called Spurge) in the month of May; take forth
the juice, and mix it with Sugar rosate, or Sugar violet in fine powder; then
make of them both a moist past, and keep it in a glass close stopped.

When you purpose to use it, minister two scruples thereof in broth, or any
other convenient Sirrup: It purges without pain, helps all Fevers that come
of heat, working not only by the stool, but provoking sweat also.

It resolves all continual and quotidian Fevers, when the parties affected
therewith be hot, and their sweat cold, yea, though they be brought very low,
it will by Gods help deliver them of their troublesome adversary.

Laureola does also move the body by vomit and seege, but it may not be used in
any continual Fever or quotidian, because it will inflame too much.

CHAP. VI. Of Soldanella, and his virtues.
THis herb grows in sandy and salt ground, and is hot and dry; it purges
by vomit and seege, and is excellent against the Dropsy, all windiness and
unwholesome moisture in the body. Being taken in Lozanges with Aromatico, the
quantity of. i. it sends forth all the noisome waterinesse out of the body,
drying and heating those parts in an excellent manner.

CHAP. VII. Of Cyperus, and his virtues.
THe herb Cyperus, called in English Gallingal, being put into new Wine gives
it an excellent good taste and smell, prevailing against inward passions caused
of wind: It is good for such as are bursten, for it resolves the wind: if you
take the powder thereof being stamped very small, and make a plaster thereof,
with other things appropriate thereunto, applying the same to the rupture, and
changing it once every day: Also if the Patient do once in a day eat of the
root, he shall in short space be helped of that disease.

CHAP. VIII. Of Elder, and his virtues.
TAke the roots of Elder, wash them clean, and scrape them till you come to the
wood, stamp that substance, and take the juice and strain it, boil it, and scum
it well, and for every. of the juice, take. i. of Mel rosarum, and drink it,
for it will cool the stomach, help hot Fevers quickly, and purge the blood.

CHAP. IX. Of the virtues and use of Tobacco.
TAke of the green herb and root lb. iii. ss. stamp it in a a mortar with a
little salt, then put it in a glass with. vi. of the spirit of wine, and set
it thirty days to putrify in horse dung; then distill it in Balneo, till all
the substance be come forth; and put therein as much Oleum Sulphuris as will
make it tart: then keep it close, and give thereof every morning a spoonful to
any one affected with the Fever, and it will help him in short time.

If any man be affected, or greatly troubled with Ulcers or Scabs, let him
drink thereof every day one spoonful, and wash the sores therewith, and in
short time it will most wonderfully cure them.

CHAP. X. Of sweet Majoram, and his Virtues.
TAke sweet Majoram and stamp it, and take of the juice,. i. Oil of bitter
Almonds. i. and of Mastick,. i. and snuff it up at the nose three or four
mornings together: and anoint the head with oil of Eggs. This purges the
head of all pains, dissolveth tumors, quickneth the sight, and provokes sleep.

CHAP. XI. Of Persicaria, alias Arsesmart, his use and virtues.
YOu shall understand that this herb does work (in a manner) against all
infirmities, most strangely to behold. For if you take the powder thereof, and
put it upon Copper molten, it will in the projection become like gold, and will
draw it to a small quantity, and make it malleable and soft like gold, except
the color.

Also if you make a strong lie of the ashes of Persicaria, and therein boil
yellow brimstone, it will draw out of it quick silver, which is the
Philosophers Mercury. This herb does also most notably preserve a man from
many infirmities, if one part thereof be taken whilst it is dry, and one other
part of Specie venetiane, being both of them well incorporated together, and
used in your meats.

CHAP. XII. Of Man, and the Medicines that are made of him.
MAn is a rational or reasonable creature, whereof we have written at large in
our book called Phisica del Phioravante. But here we will only write of
certain Medicines, that may be made or derived from him, which are for the
ease, help, and remedy of diverse infirmities, which are in men and women: The
reason whereof is very good, for every like rejoices with, and helps his
like, and therefore man serves for man. The fat of a man is (as every man
knows) hot, and penetrative, and mollifying, if you anoint the parts
therewith, where the sinews be hard, and drawn together, or contracted,
therefore it will quickly resolve them. I have made the Quintessence of man's
blood, rectified and circulated, with the which I have done most wonderful
cures, for if you give thereof. i. it will restore those that lie at the point
of death.

It is most profitable against those infirmities that are in the blood, for it
corrects the malignity of the blood, and preserves it, as well as the spirit
of Wine. If you put a little of it into a hogshead of Wine, it will purify it,
and preserve it a long time, more then any other thing whatsoever: So that this
Quintessence works more effects, for the cure of great and dangerous
infirmities, then any other-

Also from the liver of a man will be drawn by distillation, a water and an
oil. If the water be drunk every morning together, by the space of a month,
the quantity of. i. with. ii. of Liverwort water, it will recover such as are
half rotten through diseases of the liver, and has diverse other properties,
whereof I will not speak at this time.

From the flesh of man distilled, there will come forth a stinking water, and
an oil, which is most excellent to anoint wounds withal when they are badly
healed, and that there remain any hurt about those parts, that they are not so
sensible and pliant (as they were wont to be before) this resolves them: and
it mollifieth and softeneth all hardness of any tumor, of what origin all
soever it shall come.

From the forepart of a man's scull there is drawn by distillation, a water and
oil, and a salt, which is most profitably used, against the Falling sickness.

Finally from each other part of man, there are Medicines to be made, for the
cure of sundry diseases in man, and woman, as you may also read more at large,
in the Spagyrick preparations of Josephus Quercetanus published in English by
J. H. Practitioner in the Spagyricall Art.

CHAP. XIII. Of a Hen, and the Physical use thereof.
SOme write, that the flesh of an hen will dissolve gold, and that the bones
will calcine it easily.

Another told me, that the ashes of hens feathers, being calcined white, does
mundifie, incarnate, and siccatrize Ulcers.

Also there is made an excellent Restorative of an Hen, after this manner.

Take a good fat hen, and pull her quick, and take forth the guts only, and
stamp her in a mortar. Then boil it in xiii. lb. of fair water, with i. of
salt, till eight pound be consumed. That done, pass it through a strainer, and
distill it in Balneo, till all the substance be come forth. Hereof you may give
unto the sick at all times, with a little of a plain and simple Julep. When you
find any evil accident in the belly, you must add thereunto a little oil of
sweet Almonds newly made (while it is warm) for then it is one of the best
Restoratives, that can be found out, or devised in the world.

CHAP. XIV. Of Eeels, and the medicinal use of them.
MAny have used the fat of an Eeel against deafness, but to small purpose. But
if you distill the Eeles with Aqua vitae, you shall have a most subtle oil,
which does most excellently prevail against that infirmity.

Also if you boil the skins of Eels in strong Lie until they be dissolved,
then strein it and boil it to a thickness, and it will be a most strong glue
for wood or other works.

Also if you anoint a corroding Ulcer therewith, it will greatly repress the
rage thereof, and comfort it.

CHAP. XV. Of the Barbill, and to what use she serves in Medicine.
IN the month of May the Barbill has eggs which are of a soluble quality, and
of some those eggs being eaten, they shall be provoked to vomit.

They have a quality contrary to other purgers, they must be dried in the sun,
mixed with a little Sena, and then ministered in wine or water that is sodden.
When it has well wrought, the Patients must eat good meat to nourish them, and
may drink wine, and (when they are disposed thereto) suffer them to sleep.

CHAP. XVI. Of Bees, and their Medicinal Use.
BEes are of nature hot and moist, having a generative property. For if they
be given to any barren creature, they shall conceive in short time after.

Also if you lay dead Bees in a dry place to putrify, wetting them sometime
with wine, they will revive again, though not as they were before, but they
will be much bigger, and of another form.

These Bees, if you bring into powder with as much Cantharides, and boil them
with a little oil of Cammomil, and anoint any part where the hair is fallen
away, it shall quickly come again, and in a short space, a most strange thing
to behold.

CHAP. XVII. Of Frogs, and their use.
THe skins of Frogs being boiled, and made into the form of a plaster with wax
and frankincense, is very profitable for such as have any malign or troublesome
accident about their legs through heat.

The fat of Frogs is a wonderful Medicine against Fucce sacro, or S. Anthonies
fire, a disease happening unto children and others through the great heat that
is in their blood.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Centum-pedes, called in English Sowes.
IF you minister the powder of these creatures in wine, it has many excellent
properties, but chiefly it has been experienced greatly to prevail against the
stitch in the side, for it will help that grief presently.

If you burn the little crieking creature, called a Cricket, and minister the
powder thereof, in some Dieuretick liquor, it provokes Urine.

Mallows, Alkakengi, Centum-nodi, Gentum-grana, and the roots of Rapes are of
like property, being handled and used according to Art.

There are oftentimes found in standing pools, and putrified waters, certain
small creatures, which are round like a cherry, having a tail and two feet,
which are in Lombardie called Comazzi, Take these, and distill thereof a water
or liquor, wherewith you may very soon consume or break iron a very great
Secret observed in nature.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Rosin or Gum called Tacca Mahacca, and the use thereof.
TAke thereof as much as you will, distill it in a retort of glass, and from
it there will come both oil and water, of which I have seen diverse Medicines
made against sundry diseases. Anoint the belly with this oil cold, when you
go to bed, and it helps against the cruditie of the Matrix.

If the genitall part of the man be anointed therewith before the act of
generation, the woman shall be the more fit for conception, for by this means
some kind of sterilitie is taken away.

It helps and eases pain in the head, proceeding of a cold stomach.

It helps digestion, and resolves pain throughout the body in what part
soever they shall come, specially when they have their beginning of cold.

The water hereof, dissolveth wind in the stomach, helps digestion, provokes
urine, mittigateth all fevers that come of cold.

CHAP. XX. Of the Gum Caranna, and the Medicinal properties of it.
TAke it, and distill it in a retort with the yolks and whites of eggs, and
there will come forth oil and water, the oil whereof will be black, and the
water red.

The water of Caranna helps Chilblains, and all chops or clefts in the lips
arising of cold in the winter.

It is a great ease, for the sore breasts of women that give suck.

The oil works wonderful effects in wounds of the head, arm or legs.

Anoint a simple wound therewith once or twice, and it will very speedily be
healed.

Take a quantity of this Gum, and mix it with as much of the seed of
watercresses, and the white of an egg, and make thereof a Cerot to apply unto
a Rupture, wherewith it will in short time be healed, all other circumstances
being also observed.

CHAP. XXI. Of liquid Amber, and the Medicinal virtues thereof.
TAke liquid Amber, and distill it in a Retort, and from thence there will come
a red oil.

This oil is used against all indispositions of cold, and moisture, or wind.

The same heals scabs, and is good for wounds.

If you anoint the stomach therewith, it will exceedingly comfort the same,
for it is a thing uncorruptible, and like unto Balsamum.

LONDON, Printed by G. D. MDCLII.

An Apologeticall Preface of Mr. Barnard G. Londrada A Portu Aquitanus, unto
the Book of Experiments of Paracelsus, wherein it is proved, that sick bodies,
stuffed and filled with the seeds of diseases, can hardly be cured without
metalline Medicines; contrary to the Writings of some, which deny, that Metals
(after what sort or manner soever they be prepared) may profit or help the
nature of man.
IN sacred Scripture (gentle Reader) among others, we find this law, full of
Christian love and Charity, Thou shall restore again the wandering or straying
Ox, or Ass of thy Neighbors unto him; Deuteronomy. 22.8. By which saw the eternal
God would, as by an evident argument, confirm and establish amongst us mutual
love and amity: For if in this sort Gods laws do command us to take care of
the straying Cattle of our enemies, how much more then, do they will us to
help the miserable case, and great dangers, of the bodies of our friends, and
to restore their health? Wherefore, when as I (together with Theophrastus
Paracelsus and other excellent men) understood the errors of many Physicians
of our time, I began to devise with my self, by what means I might attain to
the knowledge of true Physic, which is derived out of the light of nature, not
out of the dark writings of the Heathen. And I judged it to be necessary to
travel, and to go unto far places to seek out learning and knowledge, and
not to hope or look for it, sitting at home idly. I prepared my self
therefore to my journey, and with long travel and labor have searched out, and
learned those things, which for Christian love sake I can no longer keep
silent, that I might call back the wandering children into the path of true
doctrine; and having declared my journey and labors, they also being excused
and defended, which are laid open unto all manner of slanders, by those which
so greatly commend the Heathenish Physic, whose deceits in some part I will
endeavor to disclose; I will afterward declare what those, that are desirous
of true and natural Physic, are to look for at my hands, and what Books of
true Physic I have gathered together in sundry places, being moved with
compassion toward those that go astray, I will communicate and set forth for
their public profit and commodity. But first, the matter so requires, that to
avoid the hatred of the common sort, as well from my self, as from all other
favorers of the Art of Separation, I should duly answer unto the adversaries,
whose frowardness and malice is such, that they will with proud words
annihilate, reject, and condemn others inventions, which they themselves see
and perceive they may use with great success and profit: and yet they in the
mean season arrogate unto themselves the commendations due unto the Authors,
and with a lying kind of stealth, rob the inventers of Arts of their due
honor, which is a subtle kind of craft, springing out of the deceits of the
old Serpent. For when as reports are spread of the strange cures of sundry
grievous diseases, which are wrought by the benefit of tinctures, and vegetall,
and mineral spirits, by the cunning and labor of those whom the common sort
at this day call Chemists, or Alchymists; by and by on the contrary part they
cry out, that those colliar Physicians can do no good, but kill all men that
put themselves into their hands with their venomous Medicines, so that they
ought to be driven out of the Commonwealth, and that they are deceivers, and
that their extractions, and preparations, their subtle and thin spirits will
profit nothing, and that the spirit of Vitrioll is poison, the essence of
Antimony and Mercury is nothing, the extraction of Sulphur is nothing worth,
neither the liquor of Gold, and to be brief, that all things are contrary to
the nature of man, and more to be avoided, then the eyes of a Basilisk: and yet
they, in the mean time, like cunning and crafty Theeve^, privily, and with fair
promises, pick out from the poor Chemists the secrets of Physic, and secretly
learn those things that they forbid the common people as poisons, afterward
challenging them for their own practices; and by this wicked injury they derive
unto themselves the favor, freindship, praise, gifts, and rewards of men,
which by good right are altogether due unto those, that by their labor, sweat,
watching, and diligent search in natural things, by Vulcans art have found out
such things, and published them for the common commodity of man: and yet not
contented therewith, they also publish great volumes filled with toys, lies,
and sophistications; going about, as much as in them is, to suppress,
overthrow, and utterly to extinguish the light with darkness, and the truth
with lies, and practice (the most plain and manifest workmistresse established
even by truth it self) with a vain, feigned theorick, devised by their own
subtle brain. I say to thee (thou notable Doctor, that so back-bitest
Paracelsus) how can thou by any means with thy trifling words deface the work
it self, or with thy theorick refell the practice? Art thou so great a Doctor
and know not, that thou have profited so much, as by thy work thou can
bring ought to effect? Paracelsus teaches, that the falling sickness is to be
cured with the spirit of Vitrioll, and performed it, and the work it self
declares it daily, prove thou the contrary, and cure the same disease with thy
Pills, Sirrups, and Electuaries, then shall thou have the victory. It is not
sufficient for thee, by bringing thy reasons, to prove, that metalline
Medicines are not agreeing for man's nature, neither that metals may be so
prepared that they may heal. Why? Thou deniest that which indeed is performed,
and openly seen with eyes. It is a foul thing to be ignorant in that that every
man knows, for out of all doubt you have all heard, that most dangerous
diseases have been cured with metalline tinctures, yea, with such as have not
been rightly prepared by counterfeit Paracelsians, as with Vitrum Antimonii,
which does pluck up suddenly at once by the roots the impurities of the Fever,
although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it heals; and yet we
allow not of such perilous cures: and so likewise of others. Now if the
Minerals work this, not being rightly prepared, what think you will they do
being rightly prepared, and purged from their venom and poison?

And how can you with a safe conscience reject those things whereof you have no
knowledge? It is not sufficient to affirm any thing, except it be confirmed by
probable and grounded reasons: Every man will play the Ce^sor of Paracelsus,
whom it is more easy to reprehend, then to follow: and whilst every man
desires to seem, or to be thought more learned then other, no man will learn
of another. I say, every Paracelsian, which does but only carry coals unto the
work, can show you by eye three principles of Theophrastus Physic. Have you
tasted the most sharp Salt, or the most sweet Oil, or the Balm, that most
delicate liquour? All those being hidden in every thing that is created, you
have not once perceived. The metalline spirits, in whom Physic does consist,
by no means can be found out, neither what force they have, or fellowship with
man's nature, but only by fire, for as fire did first show, that the smoke of
Mercury was poison to man's nature without any subtle speculation, but thou
did never handle coals, neither can draw any so small a Balm out of the
Vegetals; therefore being ignorant in metalline Physic, thou can not so much
as once guess what it is, and therefore do judge of things unknown, as the
blind man does of colors: Is it not a great folly to write against a thing,
and not to understand it well before? Such as are addicted to Paracelsus
doctrine, when they perceive you have no stronger weapons, then those you have
hitherto gathered, they will conclude, that you rather confirm and establish
Paracelsus Physic, then confute it: It is not enough to say a thing is false,
except there be more probable and better showed: Hereby it appears, that ye
nourish a secret ignorance of natural things in your selves.

What, are you those great Physicians and excellent Philosophers? How comes it
then to pass, that the force of drugs are hidden and unknown unto you? Do you
not in this point come near unto the Empericks, whom you with great pride and
brag of knowledge reject, when as you say, the Chemist, be he never so
excellent, is no Physician, but he that with judgment and reason has learned
to make and use all remedies for diseases; for in those points consists the
chiefest glory and commendation of a Physician, and the only safety of the
sick: How vain is this reasonable Physician, which prepares his Medicines with
reason and not with the hand? He is the very Physician that with his own hand
purges his Medicines from their venom, and being so prepared, with sharp
judgment does apply them to their proper diseases, that the seed of the
disease may be pulled up by the roots, and so must the speculation and
practice, reason and the work concur and join together, because judgment
without practice is barren. Tell me, how comes it to pass that Mercury
heals the French Pox, and the filthy scab? Why do you command the miserable
sick persons to anoint themselves with Quicksilver, as Shepherds grease
their Sheep? How happens it (I say) that Mercury is the special best remedy
against these diseases? Do you deny that metals do any thing, yea, and the
greatest part of these cures? Why do you command such as are infected with
Leprosy to swallow Gold? Why do you boil it in broths with Capons? Why do
you mingle leaf Gold in your Pills and Electuaries? You know that the force of
the Leprosy is often delayed, that it breaks not out into the upper part of
the skin, by taking of crude Gold into the stomach: Then if Gold that is
compact and not resolved do work this effect, what will not the spirit of Gold
work being loosed from his gross substance.

If you will not believe Paracelsus, that the cure of most dangerous diseases
lies hidden in metals, at the least, credit those that lived long before him;
amongst whom Arnoldus de villa nova is chief, who in his book of the
preservation of youth says thus; Pearls dissolved into liquor comfort the
natural heat, help the trembling of the heart, and those that are fearful,
and properly they clarify the blood of the heart, and many diseases are cured
by them: For it is a Salt of the Mine, which the wise call their Animal stone,
and some the Mineral Chifir, and all the mastery in the preparation of it is,
that it may be resolved into a most pure and notable water, with such things as
do not destroy his nature. This says Arnoldus, who speaks not of stamping,
but of solution: but to what purpose do I allege this? Verily, that you may
see how with your own swords you cut your own throats, you use Pearls, Corals,
and precious Stones in your Electuaries and broaths, and those you beat into
powder. You smell as it were a certain Medicinal virtue in precious Stones,
but you deal as naughty Cooks and rude Country women do, that when Partridges
or Hares come to their hands, they thrust them into the pottage pot, or else
sees them in water: even so you stamp and break your Pearls, which should
rather be dissolved. Albeit you should make powder as subtle as the air, you
should nothing profit; for as you put it into the stomach, so shall you see it
pass away again; and hereupon of very necessity were the rules of Chymick
preparations brought into Physic, which you do hate worse then a Serpent or a
Dog, with the practisers of them.

What shall need many words? If you will not yet grant, that the special cure
of diseases consists in Minerals, hearken what Andreas Matheolus says in the
fourth book of his Epistles; the bodies of the sick being full of seeds of
diseases, will hardly be healed without metalline Medicines: and in his
Treatise of Antimony, he says, Antimony does no less purge the diseases of
the bodies, then Metals, from superfluities. This did that learned man
understand, when as yet he knew not the true preparation of Antimony: Likewise
he greatly esteems the potable Gold, the preparation whereof, as the same
Matheolus used it, I will declare unto you, because you shall not be ignorant.
Take Gold twice or thrice purged with Antimony, make it into thin plates, and
in a fit vessel hang the plates that they touch not one another, and let it be
burned and calcined in a Furnace duly prepared by the space of half a year with
a very strong fire, until at the length the plates being taken out and laid
open in the air, they do dissolve, and there flow from it a certain oily
humor, red of color, and of taste sweetish. He drew out two ounces of Oil of
Gold, but out of that which was not so well burnt, the liquor did not so
readily run out: Sometimes he used to pour on the spirit of Wine rectified,
and that so long, and so much, until the whole red color was drawn out. You
shall rectify those spirits, or essence of Wine, very subtly, if you put it
into a glass cucurbite under a limbeck with a Receiver, and set it in most cold
or snowie water, and cover the head round about with a linen cloth steeped in
warm water, for then the subtiller parts will rise up, leaving the watery
substance in the bottom. Gold calcined and often infused with the spirit of
Wine with many imbibitions, and again distilled by a Limbeck, leaves in the
bottom behind a reddish liquour. That Physician used first to purge the body,
and then to shave and heat the crown of the head, and then to pour on a dram
of that Oil, and to give so much also to be drunk in Malmsey. The like is to be
wrought with fine Silver for the diseases of the head, and so likewise of other
Metals, for being duly prepared they do dissolve, because they are Salts.

This man has many other mineral Medicines, which were never known, either to
Galen, or to Hyppocrates, but brought to light by our Theophrastus Paracelsus,
of whom you great Philosophers and Physicians only in name do undiscreetly
write. Do you think all things utterly impossible unto other men-which you
your self know not, or cannot do, or that you cannot compass with your divine
knowledge? What will you say to this? I know a man, that within three, or at
the most six days, can heal the French Pox with his Turpetum minerale, not
with that which is made with Oil of Vitrioll, but with another far more
excellent, which shall not come to your hands or knowledge, except you lay
aside your frowardness, and cease to bring the Paracelsians in suspicion with
the common people and noble men, and to defraud them of the fruit of their just
labors. You say, What have you brought to pass? what have you found out
whereby you should look for praise or profit? Then do we demand of you, What
have you found out whereby Physic is the better furnished? We have brought
into Physic, Essences, Oiles, Balms, and Salts, all which the Alchymists
schools have found out. And how great light is come unto Physic only by true
distillation, it is known unto all men, and daily experience teaches, how
great commodity has redounded thereby unto the sick. In the mean time, if you
so much detest the labor, yet at the least spare our good name. But it is no
marvel, does it not so always happen, that the best labor is worst accepted
and recompensed? Every good man, inclined to virtue, wisdom, and fidelity, can
witness the same, what reward they have often received for their fidelity and
opening of the truth. So some men, when they can say no more, they object unto
the searchers of nature their poverty, filling the ears of the common people
with glorious lies, always chanting upon those things which follow upon the
abuse and dangerous cures of the counterfeit Paracelsians, judging all things
by their contempt, poverty, vile estate, and baseness, but they will quickly
avoid that despised poverty, which willingly they sustain, that the nature of
things might daily more and more be known unto men, whereby the unaccustomed
cures of most grievous diseases might at length be found out, with the which
such as are diseased might through your sluggishnesse all die, if God, having
compassion upon them now at the end of the world, had not provided wholesome
Medicines, even by most contemned men. The Lepers, and Gouty, the infected with
the Ptisick, Falling Sickness, and French Pox, devoured with the Canker,
Fistula, and greedy Woolf, with the Dropsy, and Palsy, and that with the
Plague, and other diseases, are thrust into their graves: these (I say) and
many other more, whom you through ignorance, with your naughty and corrupt
Potions and Purgatious, like Butchers have buried alive, will rise up against
you: these (I say) will call you to answer, and accuse you, even the poor whom
you have robbed of their goods, will require your blood for the loss of their
bodies, and consuming of their money. Then what a madness and cruel
foolishness is this, that in the time of any great Plague, such as are
infected you shut up in houses, set marks upon them, keep them in prison,
strangle them with cares and solitariness, and kill them for hunger: Is the
Plague so to be cured? Or whether, do you not think that all men may be
infected from whence the first man was infected? why do you not preserve the
whole with your Antidotes or Defensives, being so famous Physicians as you are?
but you have tried almost all your Medicines to be of no force in this disease.
Do you in this sort love your Neighbor as your self? or thus spend your life
for your fellow, when as at no time (if help be required) there is greater need
of fellowship, company, comfort, and help, then in the time of Plague? O what
great punishment have you deserved, that refuse those that are forsaken of
their friends, far from their kindred, and as it were thrust into exile,
whose solitariness has been more violent unto them then the disease, and
grief of mind has killed rather then the sickness? What I pray you is true
and Christian freindship? Does not this complaint of the sick stir you up unto
pity? When I was in health, thou were my friend, thou did visit me, and
help me, but now that I am sick, thou do abhor me, and lie from me; when
fortune laughed upon me, thou did also laugh, but now that with grief and
tears I crave comfort, thou do deny it. What do you call visiting and
helping? You will not only not help your selves, but will persuade Princes o^
stop the passages, that no Travelers shall pass unto those places, when as
you ought with courage to relieve them of their grief, and willingly to go
thither to try your cunning. But when any plague begins, you are the first
that tremble, are afraid, and despair. The sick are committed unto you, as
children and infants which lack diligent cure, you ought to help them, as the
father does his children, and not to rob them of their money; then would the
sick man smile upon you, if you would refresh his languishing life with some
gentle Balm, then would he rejoice in the sight of you, and call you his
father. Every natural Physician of necessity ought to make his Medicines with
his own hands, and not to commit them unto an unskilful Cook, not to fill
great volumes with receipts, with the which I see those that are studious in
Physic are in a manner overwhelmed, that they be ready almost to fall down and
die under so heavy a burden of receipts, Physic is not so learned but with the
labor of the hands, practice being workmistresse, where Vulcan day by day does
show new and pleasant remedies which nature teaches the good steward her
workman, daily to purge better and better from their superfluities. Do you
look for a rich harvest and do not first plow nor sow? Look for knowledge of
the secret natural powers, and do not first seek it out by labor with the
fire? for the most part of you all are dainty and slothful, and he that is
slack in his works, goes like a blind man unto his practice. If you did not so
much abhor the Chymicall Art, you would learn to separate the pure from the
impure (which is the cause of the corruption of things) by long digestions,
distillations, and imbibitions, whereby you should make your Medicines pure and
clean before you minister it to the sick; so upon the sudden receiving, the
sick nature should be refreshed, whereas the weak stomach cannot concoct,
digest, and separate gross matters. But these great Doctors will not be
Scholars, or young Soldiers, no more then an old Dog will be brought to
hunting with whips, he will gnaw his line, and show his grinning teeth to him
that leads him, rather then he will be ruled; even so you will rather openly
gainsay the truth, and like Dogs bark and bite at it, then you will confess
your errors. What, ought this to be a reproach unto the Chemists, that for the
true preparations of Medicines, whereof you are ignorant, and for their great
labor and pain which you do eschew, they should be accounted beggars, poor,
and ragged? Do you not think that the common people will at length find out
your deceits? You have been sufficiently warned of many Doctors of Physic, who
truly have not allowed your childish cures: Amongst whom, Conrade Gesner is
one, and many other more, which if they were living, most certainly would deny
your fained Art. Likewise John Woz of Cullen, which flourished 1510. does
sharply reprove the Physicians of his time, who in his writings upon the
Plague, and labyrinth of Physicians, most plainly and excellently treats of
metalline Medicines, and Quintessences, and shows their use. What will you
answer to those things which that Doctor Gorreus has written, in the fifth
book of the extraction of the Quintessence out of Herbs, where in his Comments
he so excellently extolleth metalline Medicines, and did use them, little
esteeming your Medicines; for he says, the distillations of waters out of
Herbs, and other such like things, wherein the Apothecaries do boast, are
almost of no force, for it is nothing else but the phlegm of the thing, whose
principal liquor consists in the oil of Salt.

But that I may stir up in you an earnest desire to know the mavelous
property of things, I will repeat unto you the judgment of Fernelius Ambianus
in his second Book and eighteenth Chapter De Abditis rerum causis: When first
(says he) I gave my self unto the study of that sensible and metalline
Philosophy, called Chymia, through long travel (as many other had) I getting a
most perfect Master or Teacher, did draw out of every Plant, and other living
things, very diverse and sundry substances; first water, and that very
plentiful, if the Plant were green, more scarce if it were dry; then Oil, but
not that fat and filthy substance which by press is drawn of our men, but the
workmanship of a more excellent Art, which neither easily corrupts nor
soureth by age, and that of two sorts, one thin and white, another drier and
red, etc. Then it follows, I will tell you by your leave, not uttering this
whole secret, but teaching you upon what true grounds it does consist: But
least the strange obscurity of the name might offend you, which the fathers
have covered under a shadow or dark kind of speech, I will most plainly and
openly show it in his place: And yet you cannot away with them that give you
good counsel, as also you will not suffer learned and excellent men, neither
Gerard Dorne Doctor of Physic, whom no doubt God has raised up unto us: This
most excellent man is worthy of eternal memory, because that he by no
injuries, neither perils, could be terrified, but that by his last Writings he
has made Paracelsus more famous, who does excel with a most ancient gravity
and authority, that at the least he might help the children of learning, for
whose defense, as a valiant Soldier, he contendeth by word and deed even to
the death: the fellow and companion of that learned Physician Josephus
Quirsitanus, famous in Physic, who has excellently deserved for Physic, and
in his books has uttered many excellent philosophical Secrets unto the
posterity, and opened many hidden spagiricall Medicines, and would have brought
to light greater things, if the ingratitude of some had not stopped his willing
mind, and especially of a Perfumer, which goes about to reprove many things,
and to allow but few in his writing, and yet not able to show better; whereby
it comes to pass, that through one man's ingratitude all feel loss and lack.
Proceed therefore with courage, drive away those drones and sluggish beasts
from the rack, so shall your head be crowned with perpetual praise. In the
mean time, whatsoever we have gotten by many travels, and found out and learned
with labor, we will here annex, praying our adversaries, that if they need
them not, they will not condemn or slander them, or terrify others, which with
willing mind would embrace these our labors, or else to teach them some better
things; considering yet, that something in the mean time ought to be given and
granted unto him, which for Physics sake has put himself in so many dangers.

After the great murder and fury of our Countrymen the French men, when I went
with D. Charles of Chambray, D. of Pansay into Italy, traveling through
Istria, Ragusium, Sclavonia, Macedonia, and Bizantium, I incessantly applied my
whole study to understand and know some certainty touching the Philosophers
stone, or Chymicall matters; but I could find no true Philosophers, only false
Physicians and Chemists every where, which had either altogether none, or else
very little knowledge of natural Arts and preparations; at the length (by Gods
good will) I happened upon a very learned man, Daniel Bishop of Dalmatia: Unto
this most excellent man I directed my letters, the which, together with his
answer, a little after sent to me, I will hereafter publish, wherein you shall
see many philosophical points, delectable to be read and understood.

At the length, when I had sufficiently searched over the East Countries, and
could gather no certain point in natural Science, I determined to take my
journey toward Germany, with the most courteous Prince Cabaneus Vydam of
Chartres, still employing my mind to the earnest study of Chymycall Physic;
and there I understood, that Kings and Princes were deceived by unskilful
Practisers, which did utter and sell their sophisticate Chymicall Arts, which
they had begged and scratched together out of all corners, with a pompous show,
deceiving the Princes of their money; whereby it comes to pass, that daily a
great number of Sophisters, and sophisticators do daily rise and spring up,
through which, not only the most commendable Art of Alchymy receives great
detriment, is oppressed and adulterate, and the Chemists themselves made
hateful unto all men, consuming their life, time, and goods, upon vain works
and practices, but also there redoundeth most great hurt and damage unto the
Commonwealth; for there are many deceivers so crafty, that with a dissembled
experience in the Chymicall Art, and with fained freindship, and great
promises, they do craftily learn of others their cunning, which they challenge
for their own, esteem of great value, and carry them about to be sold. As upon
a time, certain knaves by craft got from me certain written books, and sold
them for a great sum of money. Commonwealths and the Chymicall Art should be
very well provided for, if that such knaves might be punished and restrained by
the Magistrate, so should the studious of the Art be less deceived, and in
short space the true and pure Art would appear from those shadows and
sophistications. Wherefore, to the end that such as be desirous of the Art may
have some pledge from me, wherewith they may make this Science more plain, I
will shortly (God willing) set forth three books of the Philosophers stone,
written by diverse Authors, whereof the first was drawn out of certain
characters by a noble Britain, wherein all the dark ^peeches of the
Philosophers are most plainly expounded, whereunto I will annex two hundred
certain, infallible, and true philosophical rules, whereby those that do err
and doubt, touching the matter of the stone, shall be confirmed. The second
book is, Johannes de Rovillasco Pedomontanus, which treats of the
Philosophers Mercury, and how it is drawn, together with an Epistle of John
Pontanus of the same argument. But there is a more certain excellent Treatise
of an uncertain Author, which does explain many doubts in that sacred Physic.

And because that all nations, especially the Germans, have written books in
their own language, I will also write two books in the French tongue, for the
help of such as are studious of Philosophy, wherein I will treat of many
preparations and special Medicines tried by me and others, also of diverse
Elixars of the Philosophers, extractions of Mercuries and Mercuriall waters, of
many and diverse dissolutions, I will also add the interpretations of sundry
Characters, wherewith the books both of the old and new Writers are written to
cover and hide the Art; also the exposition of a certain Alphabet, without the
which the work can hardly be understood: and two Treatises, the one of the
virtues of the vegetall and mineral Oils, the other of the salts and
properties of many vegetals and minerals; whereunto I will also join two
Treatises of philosophical Mines, and of making of Vinegers, the which my
labor and study, if I see it acceptable unto those that are studious of that
Art, I will shortly set forth greater things, which many with their whole
hearts do wish and desire; in the mean time, take in good part this little
work. That which we have hitherto spoken, is spoken only unto those that do
so deadly hate the Chymicall Physic, which think nothing can be well or
profitably taught in Physic that the old Harp sounds not; as though that
nature were not more then Galen, or that all the learning of Physic were to be
drawn from the Heathen, or that they alone had published the Art, and
established it with such sound arguments. Why do you not out of those Authors
confute those excellent men which are followers of Paracelsus, amongst whom,
that great Doctor Petrus Severinus a Dane is chief, who in his Idea has opened
the invin^ible foundation of Paracelsus Physic? Why do you not answer to the
monarchy of the Trinity, of that learned Doctor and Physician Gerard Dorne? Why
do you not confute the volumes of that famous Physician Turnesser, being
confirmed with the truth of practice? But for your sakes, which daily call
Galens doctrine unto examination, and with exact judgment do consider of it,
giving place unto Paracelsus, acknowledging and exercising his preparations and
practice, I do rejoice, and shortly more shall come out against the
adversaries, which shall bite them better; in the mean time, with your word,
deed, and writing, defend the truth from injury.

Farewell. B. G.

B. G. Londrada a Portu Aquitanus, unto the gentle Reader health.
THis Treatise of Paracelsus (friendly Reader) came unto my hands by the gift
of a certain noble Prince of Germany, and because it is sufficiently evident
to be Paracelsus work, I thought it not good to reserve it to my self, but to
publish it abroad, seeing there comes no commodity or profit of hidden
Treasure: This therefore, such as it is (loving Reader) embrace. But this one
thing I would have you understand, that when you do minister those exalted
Essences of Paracelsus, and his precious Oils, think not that they are to be
ministered by themselves, but with some other mixture to carry or lead them; and
they must be used, the stomach first being purged with some special Medicine
of Paracelsus? as for example, if you will minister Oil of Vitrioll, mingle
five or six drops with an ounce of conserve of Roses, so shall you safely give
it, the like you must judge of other things; use these happily.

Farewell.

One hundred and fourteen Experiments and Cures, of Phillip Theophrastus
Paracelsus, a great Philosopher, and a most excellent Doctor of the one and the
other Physic, written with his own hand in the Germane tongue, which Conrade
Steinberge his Servant found among other loose papers, and scrolles of
Paracelsus.
A Certain Baron being diseased with a wonted grief, by drinking our Quinta
essentia Mercurialis, cast out a stone downward, and became whole.

2. A certain woman was long sick of the Passion of the heart, which she called
Cardiaca, who was cured by taking twice our Mercuriall vomit, which caused her
to cast out a worm, commonly called Theniam, that was four cubits long.

3. One Bartholomew had for two years space a pain in his side, whom I cured
by giving him the Oil of Vitrioll in a drink comforting the stomach.

4. A man that had his Navell standing out like to a man's Yeard, was healed
with a thread dipped in the Oil of Vitrioll, by tying the thread hard about it
every day. After the same sort I healed a great swelling, or over-growing of
the flesh, called Parotis, which grew out of a woman's thigh, weighing five
pound.

5. A Soldier was shot through in the breast to the left shoulder with a two
forked Arrow, so that the head stuck fast in the bone, the which I drew forth
with my two fingers, and poured Kissed into the wound, and so he was healed.

6. A Physician being astonished with a clap of Thunder and Lightning, so that he
seemed to be sick of the (Apoplexia) or of the disease which they call
Syderacio, and of us, blastings or taking, was restored to his former health
with Oleum auri in aqua Melissae.

7. A young man which for three years had on his chin a great outward swelling
or imposthume, with the often chewing of the herb called Persicarie, was cured.

8. I cured hard imposthumes, swellings, and crustie ulcers, and stinkings in
the nostrills, with our Medicamentum mundificativum, and with our Emplastrum
Stipticum.

9. A woman who was in manner consumed with the French Pox, was cured with a
drink or potion of Essentia Melissae, and she lived eight years after.

10. One had his stomach swollen and standing out bigger then a Pomegranate, and
that without any pain, whom I cured with a drink or potion of oil of Vitriol.

11. A boy of fifteen years old, falling down a stone stairs, had his arm

B. G. LP. Penotus Londrada
a portu sanctae Mariae Aquitanus, greeting.
I Thought good (gentle Reader) to publish and make thee partaker of these four
particular things, which if at the first sight they shall not seem to agree
with thy work and Practice, thou must remember to impute that unto thine Error
and Ignorance, for a light Error does mar a whole Work, which thou must amend
by reading of Philosophers Books. For which cause the sayings of Philosophers
are much and long to be searched, examined, and thought upon, before thou can
get out the hidden meanings of them. If thou in reading Philosophers Books play
the Sluggard, then thou can never be perfect in preparing thy matters, and
therefore I might not by the Authority of the laws of Philosophy, interpret
all things openly, word for word to thee. Some things are to be left for
Industrious wits, wherein to exercise themselves by studying and searching.
Notwithstanding, if thou be not unthankful, all these things shall be opened
and declared unto thee in my Galliae portu, where very many workings hitherto
known of few, shall faithfully be set forth. In the mean season, know thou,
that I am not the deviser of these particular things, for some of them I had of
gift, and some other for money and reward came to my hands. To thee I give them
freely, which use well.

Farewell.
A Treatise of certain Particulars, whereof the first treats of the
preparation of the Markasite of Lead, as well for the transmutation of Metals,
as for the alteration of Man's body, etc.
THe Philosophers Saturn, is properly the Markasite of lead, and indeed does
excel Sol and Luna, insomuch that Raymond says, that in this inferior world,
there is no greater secret then that which consists in the Markasite of Lead,
insomuch that they which have thoroughly sought out the force and nature of it,
have bound themselves together by oath never to utter those secrets of nature
unto the end of their lives. For so much as his operation is of such kind, as
truly it has many and sundry uses, which being duly prepared, does not only
alter and change the filthy and corrupt humors of our bodies, but also can
change and transmute by sundry experiments, Luna into Sol.

Take of the Mineral Markasite of Lead, xii. pound, and grind it into fine
powder upon a Marble stone, as they grind colors with Vinegar: being well
ground and tempered, put it into a strong glass, and put thereon a good
quantity of distilled Vinegar, and stir it well with a stick, and so let it
stand in Balneo Mariae: then set thereon a blind head, and there let it stand
eight days together, stirring and moving it every day six or seven times, then
let it cool, and the Vinegar will be of a yellowish color, the which ye shall
pour forth into another glass, taking heed that ye stir not the feces: then
put thereon more Vinegar, and stir it well with a stick, and set on the blind
head, and set it in Balneo Mariae other eight days, as ye did before, then
pour forth the Vinegar being colored into the other glass. And this order ye
shall use so long, until you see the Vinegar no more colored, for at the last
the feces will remain in a white mass, like white earth.

Distillation of the colored Vinegar.
THen take all that Vinegar being colored, and distill it in Balneo until it
will drop no more, and there let thy cucurbit stand three days with the feces,
that it may dry well, then take it forth, and thou shall find in the bottom
of the glass a white matter, the which take out, for in that whiteness the
redness of the Markasite is hidden, which being prepared, avails much to
make Aquam Philosophorum, that they call ardentem.

The preparation of the Feces.
Take the white Feces or matter, and put it into a distilling vessel with a
great recipient very well luted, that the spirits go not forth, and set it in
the hot ashes, and give it a gentle fire, and then increase it according to art
a day or two, and there will come forth, first a white water, and then a red or
golden yellow oil, the which is to be kept close with great care.

The Feces to be taken again.
Then take those Feces, and set them in a calcining furnace eight days: then
take them forth and grind them finely, and put them in a glass with a good
quantity of distilled Vinegar, and stir them well together; that being done,
set it again in Balneo eight days together, and stir it every day seven or
eight times, the more the better, then let it wax cold and settle, and pour
away the clear part from the Feces, but take heed that ye stir not the dreggs
or bottom. Then pour on fresh Vinegar, and set it in Balneo again, and do as
ye did before, and then pour away the Vinegar again, and cast away the Feces,
for they are nothing worth.

The distillation of the Vinegar.
Then take the Vinegar which you reserved, and distill it with a gentle fire,
and in the bottom thou shall find a salt, in the which remains all the force
and strength. Then calcine the said salt again in a reverberatory, four and
twenty hours with a great fire, then take it forth, and put it in the the
glass wherein it was before, and put thereon fresh Vinegar, and set it in
Balneo. And this thou shall do so often until the salt leave no feces in the
bottom: that being done, distill thy Vinegar as at the first, and thou shall
find it prepared, liquid, and clear as Crystal.

Conjunctio spiritus corporis, scilicet olei and salis.
Take the aforesaid salt, and grind it upon a stone, dropping thereon his red
oil by little and little: that being done, put it into a cucurbit luted with
Hermes seal, and so set it upon a trevet, in an Athanor twenty days, and it
will be fixed into a red stone, so that ye have the true government of the
fire. Then take it forth, and grind it upon a stone, and according to the
weight put thereunto as many Letones of the Calex of fine Gold, and upon all
these put on as much of the white water which ye distilled before the red oil,
as all the whole does weigh, and close it up with Hermes seal, and set it in
ashes in an Athanor with a soft fire until it be fixed, but after it be fixed,
there will appear many colors, the which will turn into perfect oil and true
Elixar. Rejoice in this, but before ye begin the work, consider of it and pray.

The second particular that is called Torpetum, sive Diaphoreticum minerale,
purging without loathsomenesse or difficulty, helping the Plurisie, the Plague,
and especially the French Pox.
Take Leones a Dracone repurgatissimi one part, aquilae mineralis
repurgatissimae twelve parts, mix them together according to Art, then put them
into a cucurbit of glass, and put thereon twice so much of the liquor of red
Colcathor without phlegm as the matter weighs, and then nourish it in warm
sand with a gentle fire three days, taking heed, that the matter ascend not
into the head. That being done, distill it, that the feces may remain dry, then
increase thy fire, that the sand and glass may be red hot the space of three
hours: then let it wax cold, and take out the matter, and beat it finely, and
wash it with fair distilled water, until it have lost his sharpness, and that
thou shall do diverse times till it be well purged: then dry it, and put it into
a glass, and put thereunto the spirit of wine that it may be covered three
fingers high, and set it on a fire, and thus thou shall do three times, and
then have thou without any doubt a greater secret to heal his proper disease,
so that within six days he shall be quite whole: the dose is about five
grains in conserve of Roses, drunk with wine or Saccaro Rosato, as well in the
morning, as at night when he goes to bed, and let the patient sweat thereon
two hours at each time. It is a most sovereign medicine against all
contractions, and you use it, as before, according to the nature of the disease.
But the Patient must use it six days. If there appear any pustulaes, ye shall
cure them by touching them with oil of Sulphur. Moreover those that have the
dropsy, or such like moist diseases in the body are cured by giving them six
grains, in water of Carduus Benedictus, letting them sweat thereon as is
aforesaid, and keeping the order as is before set down. Against the Plurisie, ye
shall give four grains in the said water. And against the Plague in
Rose-vinegar. Against the Falling Sickness with water of black Cherries or
Pionie. Furthermore, if any have had the same disease by nature, ye shall give
them every day a little pill in Aqua Pionia, putting thereon six drops of the
spirit of Vitrioll. If I would show or express all the virtues, I should write
a book thereof, but that which remains I will show more at large in my book
called Portus Gasconicus, with the order to draw the spirit of wine.

The third particular called Laudanum Anodinum, the which is most excellent of
all other secrets in asswaging griefs and pains in diverse diseases.
TAke Liquoris aquae inexpertis and inspissati. ii. and put thereto the spirit
of wine, and set it in Balneo to digest, until it have drawn away the
Tincture: then pour it forth into a clean vessel, and put on more, and so set
it to digest again, so long as it will give any Tincture or color. Then take
the gum of Henbane dried in the sun. i. and draw away his tincture with the
spirit of wine, as thou did out of the liquor aforesaid, then take
Di^mber,. ii. and likewise draw away his Tincture with the spirit of wine, and
keep it very close until such time as I shall show thee: then take Momia,. ss.
and draw away his tincture with the spirit of wine, and when thou have done,
mix it with the other, then take Crocus Orientalis, three drachms, and draw
forth his tincture, and mix it with the rest, and every day stir it, and keep
it in a warm place close stopped fifteen days; that being done, distill it in
Balneo, and there will remain a little matter in the bottom, then put thereto
a little of the Tincture of Diambrae, the which ye reserved before, and so let
it stand in digestion until it be thick, stirring it three or four times a
day, until the smell of the liquor be in a manner consumed, the which will be
in six weeks. Then take these that follow, the liquor of Corrall, clear Amber,
or Succinum, of each. i. Vnicornes-horn, six grains, Magisterium Perlarum, one
scruple, Ossis de cord Cervi, half a scruple, Aurum Potabile, or his Tincture,
half a dram. All these being finely beaten and mixed in a stone or glass
mortar, with the spirit of Diamber, put in with the residue being thick, and so
stirring it sundry days afterward, distill all the spirit of wine away, then
put thereon the residue of the spirit of Diambrae, and when it is almost dry,
put thereto Olei Succini, Olei Maci and Cinamoni, of each about one scruple.
Then take one part, and reserve it for women without musk, for it hurts them.
But to the other part, for men, put in half a scruple of the extraction of
Musk, made with the spirit of wine, and set it in a warm place that it may dry,
and so keep it to thy use. Ye may give it in form of Pills, or dissolve it in
some convenient liquor, the Dose, three grains, or six grains for those that
are of strong nature. It comfort much against the Colic, the Frenzy, hot
Fevers, Arthritide, Podagra, the weakness of the stomach, the Yex, and
comfort against vomiting, provokes sleep. Against the falling sickness, ye
shall give three grains with the spirit of Vitrioll and Essentia Camphora that
is drawn with oil of sweet Almonds, the which is made in this order.

The order to draw the Essence of Camphor.
Take Camphor, one dram, oil of sweet Almonds, half an ounce, macerate them
in the Sun, or in Balneo, or in a dry warm furnace four and twenty hours, then
draw forth his Tincture or essence with the spirit of wine, and put thereto one
dram of Laudanum, and two drachms of the spirit of Vitrioll, and six ounces
of the water of pionie flours, and stir them together, and give thereof one
spoonful at the time of the fit. It is a most excellent remedy against all
uncurable diseases.

The fourth specificum called Panchimagogon, the which does purge in small dose
all noisome spirits that are mingled with the humors.
Take Specierum Diarrhodon abbatis,. ii. and draw forth the Tincture with the
spirit of wine, and keep it by it self, afterward take the Pulpe of
Colocinthides,. vii. Turbit,. v. Agarici,. i. ss. Helebori nigri, vii.
Diagridii,. vi. Foliorum seen,. iiii. Rhabarbari,. ii. Elateri,. ss. Beat them,
and mix them together, and put thereon Cinamon-water, the which is made in this
order. Cinnamon l. i. stamp it grossly, then infuse it in white wine four and
twenty hours close stopped, then distill it with a gentle fire being close
luted, for with this Cinamon-water, or spirit of wine, thou may draw forth
the Tincture of all the aforesaid druggs. Always provided, that ye keep them a
month in a warm place to macerate, stirring them three or four times in a day,
and at the end of the month pour forth the liquor, and put the feces into a
Retort, and distill forth the oil and water, the oil ye shall rectify and
reserve. The Feces that remain ye shall calcine, and make thereof a salt, the
which ye shall put to the oil that ye rectified. Then take that liquor which
ye reserved first, and distill it in Balneo, and in the bottom there will
remain a matter thick like honey. Then take the tincture of Diachodon Abbatis,
and pour it upon that thick matter, and stop well thy glass, and set it in a
warm place eight days, stirring it every day. That being done, draw away the
spirit in Balneo, until it remain thick like honey, unto the which ye shall put
his oil that ye distilled, mix them, and let them digest, until it be so
thick that ye may make thereof Pills, the which ye may do so soon as it
feels the cold, for in the cold it will wax hard, and in heat it will wax
liquid; the Dose is from one scruple to two scruples, where there shall be need
of purging, put in the ponder of Licorice, for so it works without pain.

Four principal Diseases whereunto almost all other Diseases may be referred.
THe Leprosy is the first, whose badges all manner of Ulcers do bear, as
Itch, scabs, Alopecia, scurffs, chops in the skin, foulness, the dead evil,
and such like diseases.

To the Gout does belong the colic, pain in the reins, Orexes, pain in the
teeth, running gouts, painful flixes, pain of the head, Cephalea, and
Hemicranea.

To the dropsy are referred all manner of Fevers, Imposthumes, the Jaundies,
and evil digestion.

To the Falling Sickness belongs Catharrs, beating of the heart, cramps,
giddiness of the head, Apoplexies, and Suffocation of the Matrix.

If any of the princpall of these Diseases be healed, all the other inferior
be also cured.

For the cure of the Gout three things are required, that is, resolving,
mitigating, and strengthening.

Wherefore, if thou be of any quick judgment, the four particulars before set
down are sufficient for thee.

The chiefest point of health consists in this, not to fill thy self with
meat, nor to be slow in labor.

Bernardus G. Penotus Landrada a Portu S. Mariae Aquitanus unto the singular
learned man John Aquila, the hammer of the Ethnicks, wishes much health.
NOt only in these our days (friend John) but also in the old time amongst
the learned, this Proverb has taken place, That Ignorance is the mother of
marvelling: Who in these days would not marvel to see men utterly void of all
manner of learning, to be preferred before learned men, and such as are most
skillfull in the Latin and Greek tongues, and those are to be embraced of
Kings and Princes, and rewarded with most liberal gifts, and most famous and
learned men expert in all the tongues to be rejected and contemned? You, which
excel in judgment and learning will answer, That every perfect gift comes
down from the Father of light. Therefore God does in these latter days stir up
these Idiots and Empericks to stir up every Physician, that he should rightly
prepare his own Medicines with his own hands, and being so prepared, with sharp
judgment apply them to their proper diseases, that the seed of the disease may
be pulled up by the Roots, and not to commit it to an unskillfull cook. And
therefore of necessity from hence must both the Theorick and the Practice, the
reason and the work concur and join together, because judgment without
practice is barren. The greatest number of them will answer, we know not your
works and preparations which require so great and hard lalabour, we are now old
and Doctors, we will not be made yonglings, and Scholars again. If this
answer might take place, the Jew, the Pope and the Turk would not change their
superstitions, which notwithstanding we know to be most contrary to the sacred
Scripture. But we sufficiently and daily prove by calcining, subliming,
dissolving, purifying, distilling, congealing and fixing, by this most laudable
Art of Alchymie, how the pure may be separated from the impure, and the
corruptible from the incorruptible, and that which is venomous and deadly, be
changed and made wholesome some and good; and as Paracelsus says concerning
this Art, we shall first consider that all things are created of God, for he
created of nothing something, and that something is the seed of all things, and
that seed works that effect hereunto ordained and appointed. All things
notwithstanding are so created, that they shall come unto our hands, and begin
to be in our power, but so as things not perfect, but to be made perfect, as
things not finished, but to be finished. The matter in them truly is perfect,
but the middle and last matters remain to de made perfect. As for example, God
created Iron, Earth, and Clay, but not such as they should be, for the clay
grows, yet not like a Pot or other earthen Vessel: So he created Iron lying
in a rude Mass, and has given it so rude unto us, therefore we with our
labor must make thereof shoos for horses, sythes, and spears. Even so is it in
Physic, for that is also created of God, but not so that it should be utterly
perfect, but as yet hidden under the earth, not purged from his unclean matter,
but that which remains to be made perfect in it, is committed to the Chemist,
that is, to the Physician to be purged and cleansed. For herbs, trees, stones,
and iron, and whatsoever is seen with the eyes is no true Medicine, but is rude
and impure, wherein as yet the pure part lies hid. And therefore Alchymy
teaches to purge the Medicine, to dissolve it, and to separate things of
contrary kind from things of the same kind, otherwise rotten things would be
mingled with rotten, and the corrupt with the corrupt, and so conspire to one
effect; so that of one disease many other should spring or arise. Briefly,
every man loves not that whereof he has no understanding or knowledge, but
flies from it, contemns it, and thinks it not meet to be learned. The body
only, cares for that which is outward, but the mind worshippeth his God. By
how much more the knowledge or understanding of any thing does increase or
grow, so much the more is the love of the same augmented. For all things
consist in the true nkowledge of them, and out of that springs all the good
fruits that redound to knowledge. Knowledge also brings faith, for he that
knows God, begins straightway to put his trust in him. For such as every
man's faith is, such is also his knowledge.

And contrariwise, he that does otherwise work about nature, works like a
Painter that painteth an Image, in the which is neither life nor strength,
wherefore those which you call Empericks shall rise even before your faces, and
take in hand and help grievous diseases, the cures whereof are unpossible unto
you, and you together with your consultations and reasonings shall be made
laughing stocks. As lately B. in Germany it happened of a certain noble and
famous woman which was vexed with the pain of the Matrix. Some Physicians said
it was the gravel and the stone, but an Emperick passing by, affirmed that it
was neither the gravel nor the Stone, wherefore he commanded a Remedy to be
prepared for the Matrix, the which being done, she was straightwayes healed. Oh
what a rumor was raised by and by of him, stirring up others also to rumors
and tales, saying, that her husband does contemn us, that will rather use the
advice and counsel of an Emperick then ours. Yea, and others that seemed wiser
did finally regard him that would every hour use the help of an Emperick man
most unlearned. Mark, I pray you (my friend Aquilla) how the enemies inflamed
with envy go about to oppress the truth: But at the last, will they, nill
they, they shall be enforced to confess that that cannot be denied. But you
may object unto me, He that speaks all, excludes nothing. For there be many
worthy learned men, Masters and Professors of Physic, that do not deny or
refuse this Art. In the which number are those most excellent and singular
Masters, and Doctors, Petrus Severinus Danus which has written mavelous
things of this Chymicall Art, that worthy and godly man Michael Neander,
Professor of humanity, Theodorus Zuingerus of Basil, a man practiced in this
Art, and also Theodorus Brickmannus a Physician of Cullen, which both by word
and deed daily excels with most deep judgment in these matters, whom I will
never overpasse with silence.

Hereafter follows three Particular Treatises, the first of the Sulphur of
Gold, and other Metals, then of Stones, and the Extraction of Coral.
REcipe, Purged and fine Gold made in plates, i. the powder of Pumice stone,
iiii. lay them Stratum Superstratum, and reverberate it with dry wood five
days and nights together, then take the powder and keep it in a glass. Then
melt the Gold again, and make it in plates, and lay it Stratum superstratum as
ye did before, and that ye must do until the Gold have lost his yellow
color, after take all thy pouders together, and put it in a glass with
distilled Vinegar, and there let it remain until the Vinegar be colored
yellow, then pour it forth, and put in more, and that thou shall do so often,
until the Vinegar be no more colored, then vapor away the Vinegar, and thou
shall find an inpalpable powder in the bottom. If thou be wise, look where
thou made an end, there begin, the like is of other metals. But they are not
to be reverberated so long, you shall have of silver a bluish color, of iron
a reddish color, of copper a darkish color: There is drawn out of Coral a
red tincture. All which things are to be corrected with the spirit of wine,
being often poured thereon, there cannot be a shorter or profitabler way found
out for this. Iron plates for one time are of force, but after the first
Cimentation they serve no more. His tincture being rightly prepared is used in
stead of gold. If it be drawn out of the best steel, it will fix the Mercury
of Saturn.

The Second Particular is of the mavelous preparation of the Markasite of
Lead, tincting water, or other liquor into his red color.
REcipe, Salt common prepared Vitrioll Roman, ana lb vi set them in a fire of
calcination ten hours, then take it forth, and beat it to powder, then put it
into a stone pot unglased, and give it fire 15 hours according to Art, then
will distill forth both the oil and the spirit together, the which ye shall
rectify in a Pelican, then being rectified, put thereunto the markasite of
lead in powder, being in a strong cucurbit well luted, and then set it in ashes
in a furnace, under the which ye shall set a burning lamp for the space of a
month, and then the Markasite will dissolve into a red matter: afterward take
common fountaine-water and pour thereon, then set it to dissolve in a moist
place or Cellar, and the flower of the Markasite will turn like to a red
Crystal: the which take to thy work. It purges the Leprosy, blood in
Plurisies, the Plague, Contractures, the lungs and liver, the quantity of one
piece in greatness, does serve to dissolve the same.

The third particular, and the sum of the whole work.
R. Album, Albius, Albo, as much as ye will, Aqua Solvens six times as much,
and set them in Balneo three days, then take it forth, filter it and dry it:
then again dissolve it, and that do three times, being dry dissolve it by it
self, of the which solution, take three parts olei permanentis and
incombustibilis one part, Aeris four parts, shut thy vessel, and in that heat
nourish it, and in few days thou shall have an universal medicine to expel
all diseases. Rejoice, and give praise unto Jesus Christ.

A Fragment out of the Theoricks of John Isacacus Hollandus.
AMongst all things that were created of God, water was the first, whereunto
God joined his proper earth, and of earth, whatsoever has essence or life,
has his original. Therefore there are two manifest elements, that is, Water,
and Earth; in which the two other lie hid, the Fire in the Earth, and the Air
in the Water: and they are so knit together, that they cannot be separated. Two
of them are fixed, as the Earth and Fire, two are flying, as Water and Air.
Therefore every element does participate within other elements. Moreover, over,
in every element are two other elements, one decaying, Putrefying and
combustible, the other eternal and incorruptible, as the heaven: besides, in
these natures lies hid another nature which is called by the name of stinking
Pheces, which hinder and take away the strength of the rest, so as they have
very little force or none, and thereby make the other elements stinking and
subject to putrefaction. There is also two kinds of Waters, the one elementall,
the other of rain and riverwaters; as there is also two kinds of Earths, one
elementall, clear, shining, and white, the other black, stinking, and
combustible. Like as also there be two Fires, one elementall and natural, the
other stinking and combustible; the like is also to be said of the air. The
base things are so mingled with the rest, that by and by they corrupt all
things, so that nothing can continue long, for they bring death, and weaken all
nature be it never so noble. This is to be understood of all things both
vegetall, animal, and mineral. Therefore it is necessary by Art to separate
the elementall nature from the corruptible, that the matter may be brought to a
medicinal quality. There be three most subtle spirits in all things, that is,
color, taste, and smell, these fly away invisibly, the Philosophers call them
wild spirits, because they are not fixible, yet the industry of the Artificer
may fix them. They always grow in the bodily substance until they come to
perfection and end. The herb therefore is to be taken when it is fully grown,
and take heed that you loose none of those three spirits, as the ignorant use
to do with their putrifactions and separations of elements. For none of those
spirits consists of the three elementall elements: but God has adorned
elements with those three spirits, and of them the Fire is animal, the Water,
air elementall, and no man, but God can separate them asunder. But the water
of the clouds may be separated from them. Also all the feces may be separated
from them which are mingled with them, which are the stinking and corurptible
elements, and the four elementall elements may be brought to a christaline
shining: but these three elements, Fire, Air, and Earth, are unseparable. My
son, know this, that Mercury is the first of all things, for before time there
was water, And the spirit of the Lord rested upon the water, but what was that
water; the water of the Clouds, or a moisture which might be poured out? No,
but it was a dry dustie water, and God has joined his earth unto it which is
his sulphur, and so the earth congealeth the water, and thereof sprung the four
elements included in these two, by the will of God. Therefore Mercury
congealeth sulphur, and sulphur Mercury; neither can one of these be without
the other, as also they cannot be without their salt, which is the chiefest
means, by whose help nature ingendereth and brings forth all vegetals,
minerals, and animals. Wherefore these three, Mercury, Salt, and Sulphur,
cannot be one without another, for where the one is found, there the other are
found also, neither is there any thing in nature wherein these three are not
found: and of these three, whatsoever is in nature has his original, and are
so mingled with the four elements, that they make one body, and the salt is
drowned in the bottom of the elements, for it is necessary that the salt
should keep them united by his sharpness and dryness, notwithstanding it is a
flying spirit, but because it sticks in the bottom of the mixture, and is
overcome of the fatness and combustible oil, in which it is found: as the
yolk within the white of the egg, and the combustible oil lives of earth with
the salt and feces, and the salt is buried in the bottom of the feces of the
combustible oil and earth, but by great force of fire. These three spirits
whereof we have spoken, are said first to be separated from the mixture of the
elements, which is the soul of all things, or their Quintessence, which
houldeth together the whole mixture of the elements; for when the spirits are
gone out, then the mixture is dissolved by it self and divided, neither is
there need of fire to expel the salt from the earth; when the elements are
separated from the feces, then is the salt also separated with it. This salt is
unknown to the ignorant. Therefore salt is the means between the gross
earthly parts, and the three flying spirits resting in the natural heat, that
is, the taste, moist smell, and color: which three are the life, soul, and
quintessence of every thing, neither can these three spirits be one without the
other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one, yet three persons,
and one is not without the other. The ignorant laugh, neither understand they
these three spirits, when as they are tied to the gross, earthly fixed parts,
and are made subtle, and their salt is joined and mingled with them, it must
transform them altogether, and fix them into a Cristaline body, Diaphanes, and
red of color, whereof we will speak hereafter; he that knows not this salt,
shall never bring any to pass in Art. The Philosophers call this salt a dry
water, and a lively salt, but the ignorant thought they meant Mercury, but the
Philosophers called the three spirits Mercury, and the earth Sulphur, which
the ignorant understand not. Either of them cannot be without the other,
neither is there any thing in nature, in which these three are not, and they
are so mixed with the four elements, that they make one body and mixture.
Whatsoever God has created is in these three stones, wherefore all may be
reduced into a Cristalline clearness by Art, given by God unto the
Philosophers, for in the latter days God will separate all the unclean feces
and corruption that is in the elements, and bring them to a Cristaline
clearness, and redness of a Carbuncle. Afterward there shall be no more
corruption, but they shall endure for ever. Do you think that all things, which
God has created in these lower parts, should utterly perish in the latter day?
No, not the least hair of those things which God has created, no more then
the incorruptible Heaven, but God by his Will will change all things, and make
them Cristalline, and the four elements shall be perfect, simple, and fixed in
themselves, and they shall be all a quintessence. Demonstration of these things
may be made here upon earth by Art, for whatsoever God has created may be
brought to a Cristalline clearness, and the elements gathered together into a
simple fixed substance, which being done, no man can alter them, neither the
fire it self burn or change them, but they shall continue perpetually as those
things which have attained eternity.

The Order to draw forth the Quintessence of Sugar, collected out of the
Vegetable and Animal Works of Isaac Hollander.
HEre will I show thee a great Secret, how thou shall draw forth the
Quintessence of Sugar, the which truly excels all Vegitable works, by means
of his temperature like unto the incorruptible heaven, the which is neither
hot, cold, nor dry, but most temperate, nevertheless compounded of the four
Elements, but they strive not one with another, for they are so joined
together, that they can never be separated one from another, but for ever
remain simple and fixed in unity. But this heaven does distribute and give unto
the earth whatsoever is necessary for it, although that it self be neither hot
nor cold, moist nor dry, the which like Effects has the Quintessence of Sugar,
the which in it self has the four Elements, as gold has: as gold is pure, so
Sugar is impure, gold outwardly is hot and moist, inwardly cold and dry, and
white: sugar is the contrary, for it is outwardly cold and dry, and inwardly
hot and moist and red, and fixed both outward and inward. Neither is there any
thing wanting, but that the inward quality may be brought, that his redness
may appear outwardly, and that his Feces be separated, then is it prepared, and
shall not need to be fixed, for it is fixed already, and does retain within it
self all outward and inward spirits, and whatsoever is Volatile it does retain.

Now what his kind is I will tell thee, and from whence he has his Original,
that is, even out of the red, but if thou will be further satisfied, read the
three and thirty chapter of the generation of those things that grow in the
Seas, and other waters, where we write largely of the nature thereof. Here it
shall be sufficient for us to show the order how to prepare it, and in what
order it should be used in Medicine, and also to other things where it may be
applied. His nature is to retain or hold all flying spirits, and to fix them
into a stone, as shall be showed hereafter.

First ye shall understand that ye cannot separate the Feces, except ye bring
the inward parts outward, that is to say, that his inward dark golden color do
appear, the which when it is so distilled, his redness is seen, and this
fire, passing the yellowness of his air, or his incombustible oil, then
may thou first separate the Fesses from the Quintesscence. Take therefore
hard and white Sugar, for it is not needful that ye travel much in dissolving
and congealing of it, although there be much impuritie therein, that hinders
not, but that the inward part may be brought forth, for it must be purged when
as the redness does show it self outward. Take therefore ten or twenty pounds
of Sugar more or less as you shall think good, that being beaten, put it into
a cucurbite of hard stone, and put thereon Aquavitae, that it may stand covered
eight fingers, then distill it in Balneo with a strong fire, until it will
distill no more, then let it wax cold, and pour on the said Aqua vitae again,
and distill it again, and this shall thou do six or seven times; At the last
open the head and take forth the Sugar, which thou shall put in a strong
glass, and set it in fine sifted ashes, and put thereon the Aqua vitae, and
distill it until the half be come forth, then pour on again the Aqua vitae
which thou distilledst away, first being made warm lest the glass should
break; Ye shall note, that the head would have a hole in the top, by the which
you may pour in the Aqua vitae with a Funnell, this thou shall repeat often
with a strong fire, that the wine and the Sugar may boil in, and because the
half part of the wine will come away quickly, ye shall presently put on the
other part, for if ye should distill forth all the wine, the Sugar would burn
through too much heat, because it must continually be boiling in the glass,
and it would smell of the burning, for it has always his combustible Sulphur,
wherefore ye must always have half the wine in the Vessel, and when thou
see the half is distilled forth, make the same warm, and put it in again with
a Funnell, and that thou shall so often repeat, until the Sugar remain as red
as blood, the which thou shall perceive through the glass. Thou may bring
that to pass in eight or ten days according as thou rulest thy fire.

Note, that when thou perceivest the matter to be red, let it cool, and take
away the vessel with ashes, and set the vessel in Balneo, and with a strong
fire distill away the Aqua vitae until the Sugar remain dry, and when it will
distill no more, yet thou shall let it stand four or five days very hot in the
said Balneo, that the Sugar may be perfectly congealed, then let it cool, and
take out the matter or stone, the which will be like black Pitch, that is to be
understood when it is congealed, then take the said stone, and put it into a
great quantity of common water twice distilled, and set it in Balneo five or
six days with a great heat slightly covered, stirring it every day five or six
times with a wooden ladle, then let it cool, and take it forth, and let it
settle three or four days, then pour of that which is clear into another
vessel, and keep it close, then pour on those Feces the sublimed water as
before, and set it in Balneo to digest three days, stirring it with a ladle as
ye did before, then let it cool and settle, and pour of the clearest part, as
ye did before, and put it to the rest, then pour on more water upon the Fesses,
and digest it in Balneo as before, and this you must so often repeat until the
water be no more colored, then thou may cast away the Fesses, for they are
nothing worth, for the Element of the earth is with the Element of fire and
water, neither can they be separated any more, but are fixed together. Make
thereof a trial, for there will remain nothing but light ashes; It will burn
like oil or fat, neither does there any thing remain more then of oil or fat.
Take the glass wherein is all the red of the Solution, and distill it in
Balneo, or let it vapor away, if ye have store of distilled water, until it
be dry, then let it cool, and take off the head, and pour thereon more sublimed
water, and set it in Balneo again, and stir it about with a wooden ladle as
ye did before, then let it settle as before, and pour out of the clearest part,
and that thou shall do so long, till there be no more Feces, then put it in a
glass that may abide the fire, and boil or vapor it away so long, till there
appear a certain scum on it, then take it forth, and set it in a cold and dry,
or hot and dry place, and it will grow into a great red mass or lump, and
transparent like a Rubie, or other Philosophers stone, which if thou will bring
to powder, set it in a warm dunghill in a large wide glass open, and let it
vapor away, until it be come into a yellow powder like unto gold, and so thou
shall have the Quintessence of Sugar fixed, the which will retain all flying
spirits. Neither is it sweet, but a heavenly taste, the which, if ye put it in
your mouth, it will melt without any feeling. If it be winter or cold, thou
shall seem to feel a certain natural heat throughout the whole body, and shall
seem so temperate and light, as though thou could fly. If thou be over-hot,
swallow a little, and presently thou shall cool easily, as though thou wentest
into a cold bath, and thus it works in heat, moist, cold, and dry, by an
incredible Miracle: When ye will use it, drink it with rectified Aqua vitae,
or Rose Water, Endive or Scabios, or by it self if ye will, and thou shall see
marvels: If any be diseased outwardly with Scabs or Ulcers, let him drink of
this, and wash the sores with Wine, wherein this Quintessence is dissolved, and
he shall presently wax whole most mraculously. If any be wounded or thrust in
with any weapon, so that it be not deadly, let him drink i. of this Essence
with warmed Wine, and wash the Wound with Wine, wherein the Quintessence is
dissolved, he shall be presently cured, so that those which shall hear or see
it shall be amazed thereat. It helps also the falling sickness, pestilence,
and all such diseases as may happen unto man; if ye have Aurum potabile, ye
shall mix lb ii. with lb i. of this Quintessence in a glass, and set it on a
Trivet, or in a dry Balneo 30 days in an Athanor, and they will be fixed
together, and then it will work miracles in man's body; ye may also when you
have drawn the Quintessence of any herb, coagulate and fix it with the same,
as I said before with Aurum Potabile, and thou shall see thereof Miracles.
Furthermore if ye will have it to pass the helm, ye must put thereon as much
Vinegar or Aqua vitae, and distill it, and again pour on fresh Vinegar or Aqua
vitae, and draw it away again until the Quintessence does ascend in a red
golden color, as we have showed in many places, how to distill those matters
that are fixed by Vinegar, or Aqua vitae, for when it is distilled by the
Limbeck, his virtues are augmented a thousand times, and will work strange
cures: keep this as a secret, for it is a great mystery in nature.

Here begins a manual or handy work, how the Quintessence may be drawn out
of Honey.
NOw will I open unto you a great Secret in the Vegetall work of honey, to wit,
a mavelous nature, for it is drawn out of the most noble and pure part of the
flowers. The nature of Bees is such, that they draw out the best of every
thing, as in the Animal work is more at large described, wherein there is
taught how to extract the nature of all beasts, and speciallly in the 84.
Chapter. Wherefore (my son) know this, that all that God has created good in
the upper part of the world, are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven: but
whatsoever in these lower parts, whether it be in beasts, fishes, and all
manner of sensible creatures, herbs or plants, it is endued with a double
nature, that is to say, perfect, and unperfect; the perfect nature is called
the Quintessence, the unperfect the Pieces or dreggs, on the venomous or
combustible oil. Therefore you shall separate the dregs and combustible oil,
and then that which remains is perfect, and is called the Quintessence, which
will endure continually, even as the heaven, neither can it be dissolved with
fire or any other thing. For when God had created all things, and looked upon
them, they were all perfect good, there was nothing lacking to any; and
therefore for loves sake I say unto thee, that God has put a secret nature or
influence in every creature, and that to every nature of one sort or kind he
has given one common influence, and to every one of several kinds their
several influence and virtue, whether it be on Physic, or other secret
works, which partly are found out by natural workmanship. And yet more things
are unknown then are apparent to our senses: What! do you not think that an
herb that is appointed for one disease, which it will cure, does not contain
in it many more virtues then are known unto us? Yes truly many more. This also
I add, that if the Feces and combustible oil be taken away from this thing or
herb, which in all things is the poison that should be taken away, that brings
death unto us, and the Elements should be purified, and so burned together by
Art, that they shall pass together by a Limbeck, and be joined together, as it
were coupled in marriage, that it may root out all manner of disease from every
thing, be it herb or living thing, or be drawn from his venom, as in the 14.
Chapter of the Prologue of this Book is declared, and also in the Prologue of
the Animal work, whereas the manner of drawing the Quintessence out of all
venomous beasts, birds, worms, and flies, is plainly declared, that it may help
all the griefs of man, but that specially is drawn out of the blood of man, and
there is likewise declared, that there is no need of things without man or
beast to help such as are infected. For every creature contains in himself the
remedy of his disease, which remedy may be drawn without the hurt of man or
beast, that the disease may be miraculously cured, as is there most excellently
taught in the Theorick and in the Practick. Therefore I would write this, that
thou soon might understand what mavelous force is in Honey, which is taken
out of all flowers, and gathered into one Mass, which truly is endued with
sundry Virtues. For if God has given unto other things the gift of healing,
what then is there not in Honey, which is gathered out of so many flowers, and
every herb endued with his own proper Virtue? Truly if it be brought to his
height and excellency, it will work marvellously. Now consider what lies
hidden in this Quintessence, and esteem it not lightly, but keep it secret as
the most excellent thing of all the Animal work, the which being obtained, you
shall need no other Medicines to put away all the accidents of the body.

CHAP. II.
NOw I will set in hand with the practice. Take twelve quarts of the best
Virgin Honey, and put it in a great earthen Vessel with a Limbeck well luted,
and set it in Balneo, and lute a Recipient to the neck of it, and distill that
which will distill of it in your Balneo boiling. My son, know this, that there
is no common water in Honey, but only Philosophical and Elementall, for the
element of Air does first pass with the element of fire, in the which the
air is contained, and the air when it rises, resembles the savor of Aqua
vitae distilled, and at the first can not be known from Aqua vitae, neither by
sight, neither by savor: distill it until there will no more arise, then
leave the vessel in Balneo five days with a Limbeck and receiver, let it boil
night and day, that the matter may be dried, then let it cool, and take it out,
and take away the receiver and Limbeck, and that which is in the receiver pour
into the vessel again upon the dry matter, and set it in Balneo, and cover the
mouth of the vessel with a clean dish well luted, and let your Balneum be only
luke warm. My son, understand that it may thus be done, for it is good that the
fire be drawn with his proper air, so as a man would stay so long, for it
would be of the greater force. The ancient Philosophers wrought in this sort,
but the danger is, when the vessels shall be opened least the water fly away,
for it is as subtle as wine. For every time the air is to be drawn away, and
again to be poured on, making putrefaction in a warm Balneo, but first it must
be well luted, and a Limbeck being set on with a receiver, you must reiterate
the work, until the fire rise like unto red blood. There is another method or
rule of working found out in these our days, which is in this sort.

CHAP. III.
THey are thus drawn out, and the matter dried, as is aforesaid, then take
common water, twice distilled in Balneo, and pour on as much as is sufficient,
and set it in Balneo, cover the mouth of the vessel: but let not the Balneum
boil, and so let it stand three days and three nights, moving it day and
night with a spattle of wood: let it cool, and be poured out and strained.
Then take a clean vessel and pour out that which is clear, and pour upon the
feces fresh distilled water, as you did before, and set the vessel in Balneo,
and do as you did before: let it be cleared and put aside with the first water,
and put on again fresh water distilled, and set it in Balneo as aforesaid, and
do this so often until the water be no more colored, for then have you the
fire separated from the earth, but reserve the earth or feces until I tell you
further what you shall do with it, for there is yet a combustible oil in it.

CHAP. IIII.
TAke the vessel wherein is the colored water, and set it in Balneo with a
Limbeck, and receiver well luted, and distill all the water with a boiling
Balneo, and let the matter be well dried and cool, then take away the
Alimbeck, and let the vessel remain in Balneo, and pour on the water again
upon the matter, and make a fire, and set a dish upon the mouth of the vessel,
and let it stand so in Balneo three days, every day moving it with a spattle
of wood three or four times, then let it cool, and be taken out and be
strained. Then take a clean vessel, and softly pour out that which is clear
into it, and upon the feces straightwaies pour on fresh distilled water,
stirring it about with a wooden ladle, and let it stand to clear one day, and
the feces which remain put unto the first feces. Then take a vessel, and set
it in a boiling Balmeo until it be dry, and reiterate this work until there
remain no feces in the bottom of the vessel, so shall you have the pure
element of Fire: and the element of the Air also must be so often distilled,
until there remain nothing in the bottom: and in this sort you shall have the
pure Element. Separate then the water from the fire, and let it dry, so shall
you have a clear shining matter like to Camphore: keep the fire well in a
glass, and the air with the water in another glass well closed, until you
have your earth prepared.

CHAP. V.
TAke all the earth with the feces, and draw out the combustible oil by a
discensorie, that is, with two vessels joined together and luted, until the
combustible oil do pass, which is profitable for all cold diseases, and other
passions, which were too long to rehearse: if you desire not the combustible
oil, suffer it to fly away. Then take your earth, and calcine it in a furnace
of reverberation gently, until it be all white as snow, then take a great
earthen or stone vessel, and put your white calcined earth into it, and pour
out a good quantity of common water distilled, and stir it with a wooden ladle,
and set it three days in a boiling bath, and cover it with a dish, and stir it
every day ten or twelve times. Let it cool, and the vessel take out, and let
it clear one whole day: then take another clean vessel, and softly pour out
that which is clear, and upon the feces pour again fresh distilled water, and
set it in Balneo, and do as you did before. Take it out again, and let it
clear one day and night, and that which is uppermost clear, pour out to the
first water: Then put to fresh distilled water the third time unto the Feces,
and set it in Balneo, and do as you did before, and pour out the clear the
third time unto the first water, then cast away the Feces of the third water,
for they are of no value. Then take the vessel into which the water was put,
and set it in Balneo, with a Limbeck and a receiver: and with a boiling Balneo,
draw out the water until the matter be made dry. Let it cool, take away the
Limbick, and pour in the water again upon the Earth, or salt, and set it one
day in boiling Balneo. Let it dissolve, and clear, and take out that which is
clear; and put in a little distilled water upon the Feces, and let it stand two
or three hours in a warm bath: take it out, let it clear by the space of one
hour or two, and pour out the upper part to the first water, and cast away the
Feces, for there is nothing in them. Let the vessel be set again in Balneo
with the earth or salt, and distill away the water until all be dry, and do as
before, reiterating the work, until that no Feces remain in the bottom, then
drein away the the water from the earth, and you shall find a fair earth like
Cristal: and so you shall have pure elements.

CHAP. VI.
TAke a great glass that will bear the fire, and put into it your earth and
your fire, and pour your air upon it, and set it to distill in a furnace, in
pot or with sand or ashes, with a Limbeck well luted, having a hole in the
uppermost knottie part, that a Funnell may be put in when there shall be need
of Infusion: when as the humiditie that it has received be half consumed, then
fortify your fire by little and little increasing it, until you see the water
boil, and keep the fire in that state still, until it be consumed even to a
pint. Take away the fire, let it cool, take away your Receiver, and open the
hole of the Limbeck, and put in your glass Funnell, and pour in all the
distilled water in the Recipient upon the Earth, and stop the hole of the
Limbeck, and set the Receiver unto the neck thereof well luted, and distill
again, and observe the manner aforesaid of drawing and making infusion, and do
thus ten times. The tenth Distillation finished, let all pass together; for
then the earth is made flying. So the air, the water, the fire, and the earth
will ascend together by the Limbeck, and be brought into one substance which
were in four. One together in nature, and now simple as the incorruptible
heaven, yet are they not fixed: but notwithstanding they are so coupled
together between themselves, that by no means they can be separated, but will
continue one simple body for ever; even as the Christalline and uncorruptible
heaven, which notwithstanding is compounded of the four Elements. What think
you of this my Son? Cannot this Quintessence help every disease that does
infect man through his most excellent temperature, whether it be in heat, cold,
moist, or dry, for all are in it that he may distribute unto every one that
which is necessary, even as the heaven, when need requires, gives unto the
earth all things, as coldness, heat, or moisture: And yet it is neither hot,
cold, moist, nor dry, but of one simple essence, and that endued with such a
nature, that it gives unto every thing that which is necessary: In like manner
does this Quintessence. Therefore my Son rejoice, and give the Almighty God
thanks which has opened these things unto the Philosophers.

CHAP. VII.
NOw my Son, if thou will bring this Quintessence yet to a greater perfection:
Take a great Circulatory, or Pelican, that is, a glass that has a great head
like to a Limbeck, and in the top of the head a hole, by the which the matter
may be poured in by a Funnell; let the hole be stopped; out of the head comes
forth two arms bending round unto the belly, by the which that which does
ascend up may fall down again by those arms of glass into the belly of the
Pelican: This is the form of the Vessels that distill one into another, or
Pelican. 1. Take then your Quintessence, and put it in a Pelican in ashes,
but better in salt prepared and dried, and make your fire like unto the extreme
heat in Summer, and the Quintessence will rise like unto a red Oil, and fall
down again by the arms of the Pelican; and by often ascension, the
Quintessence will wax thick, that it will tarry in the bottom and rise no more;
then fortify the fire that it may ascend and descend again; then keep the fire
in that heat until it ascend no more, but rest in the bottom; then make your
fire stronger, that it may ascend and descend again, and keep the heat in the
same degree until it rise no more. 2. Observe this manner in augmenting your
fire until the water be fixed, and the glass be red hot four and twenty
hours together; if the Quintessence do not then ascend, it is fixed, and
brought unto his highest virtue; and take it out of the glass, being yet hot,
for if it be cold, it will wax hard, so that you must break the glass; for at
the fire it does wax liquid, and being set open in the air, it does congeal,
and peirceth every hard thing, as Oil does any dry leather, and in color is
like unto a Rubie, and through shining like a Crystal, it gives light in the
dark, sufficient to read by. What do thou think of this my Son? are there
not many strange bodies created of God? Truly he has endued the Philosophers
with no less gifts; for they that can look into the secrets of nature, shall
see it to be of an incredible operation, for this is gathered by the Bees of
the subtilest part of all Plants, Trees, Flowers, and Fruits, and at that time,
when Flowers break out and Trees bud. It is worthily called the Philosophers
stone, for it is fixed and liquable as Wax, and as the mineral stone
transmuteth the impure metal, so does this alter diseases. Hereby it does
appear, that this does bear the bell amongst all vegetals; whereas it being yet
in his grosenesse and impute, it is but of small value for any use in Physic,
by what means so ever it be boiled or scummed, but does always retain his
nature; for it consists of all the fruits of the earth, plants, and trees:
Whereof one herb is hot, another cold, another dry, another moist, one
astringent, another laxative, some corrosive, others venomous; and so diverse
herbs have their diverse qualities. 3. It comes to pass, if it help one
disease, by and by it hinders another; for every thing works according to
his property, when as there is separation made in the body; and of this
separation it ingendereth blood and other humors: And they are likened unto
Gunpowder, which so long as it lies still there comes no hurt of it, but if
it be brought unto the fire, it strait utters his secret nature, and is
kindled with a venomous fire, which cannot be quenched with water; for the cold
and dry, hot and moist, do strive amongst themselves, a wind is stirred up,
that breaks all things that is near unto it. The like happens unto Honey,
that when it comes to the region of the Liver, that it should be there
separated, then it shows his nature to pass up, and swell with wind, that it
is no marvel, if that through contention the veins of the Liver be broken, as
oftentimes it happens, whereupon Imposthumes are caused in diverse places, and
brings forth such inflammations, that the veins are easily broken; although
many do greatly commend Honey, but they are not the children of Philosophy,
neither do they understand the nature of it: But when it is brought to a
simple, fixed as Wine, then is it the chiefest Medicine amongst all the
vegetables, neither is the like unto this found in all the world. Give God
thanks, and be liberal unto the poor. The dose of this is one grain, and it
must be taken every morning with an empty stomach, likewise in the evening,
until the end of the disease. For every disease will be cured in short time,
even after the same manner, as the Mineral stone makes his projection upon
metals: Praise God, and labor diligently.

The manner and order how to draw the Quintessence out of the Herb, called
Rose solis.
NOw my Son, I will teach thee the greatest mystery or secret amongst all
vegetable things, whose force and strength has been kept secret amongst all
the ancient workmen, and they have bound themselves one to another by Oath,
that they should not utter, in their books or writings, the strength of this
Herb, which is called Rose solis, and in the Germane tongue Sindawe. Whosoever
therefore has not the whole vegetable work, he cannot attain to the strength
of this Herb; for in that work is comprehended all the force of medicinal
things: And this work of vegetables is not come to the hands, but only of the
ancient sworn Artificers, which were skillful in the liberal Arts. But now my
Son, I will open it unto thee with adjuration, that thou shall keep this hidden
knowledge secret. First, my Son, you must understand, that this Herb is the
Herb of the Sun, upon the which the Sun spreads his beams and influences, as
he does upon Gold in the veins of the Mines; and he pours out his influences
more upon this Herb, then upon any other which is created of God, as it is
evidently known of the ancient Philosophers, and this Herb does so far
surmount all other Herbs which spring out of the earth, as the Sun does all
other Planets in the Heaven, and has greater force and power of influence then
any other thing created of God in the Firmament. So this herb does excel all
others in virtue, and therefore this herb is decked with another color, other
leaves, and stranger shape then all other herbs. And his nature is such, that
the hotter and drier the country is in the time of the year, and the heat of
the Sun, and the more that the Sun does heat and burn him, this herb is the
more moist and filled with dew, insomuch, that upon one branch will hang above
a thousand drops. Make a trial, and strike this herb with a slender twig,
that the drops which fall from it may fall into a large glass vessel, and you
shall see the vessel filled with a mavelous dew, and if the Sun be vehement
hot, those branches in short space, that is, within the space of half an hour
will be more full of dew then before, and if you strike the dew twenty times
with a rod, yet it will again be laden with drops; it were enough if we did
see no other miracle then from whence this dewie humor should rise, which in
so short space does so abundantly flow from it, and how much the more the
burning sun does scorch up the other herbs, so much the more is this moist,
and filled with drops, even as though it had been sprinkled over with water,
hereupon may we gather his mavelous qualities, and judge that there is some
secret operation hidden in it; if thou do keep this water thus gathered in a
glass, therewith thou shall cure all the diseases of the eyes, whether they
come of Rheums, or of Inflammation: It helps moreover all the pains and
diseases of the heart, it cools the Liver, and stomach that is inflamed, and
does mitigate all the pain of the head that comes of heat, and drives away
all dreams and Fantasies: It is good also to kill the Canker and the Wolf,
against the biting of Venomous beasts, against Poison drunk, if it be taken by
the mouth, it helps also the Pestilence, it is good for many other diseases
which were too long here to rehearse.

This herb has the color of the sun, for his color is red dark, divided
with yellow lines, and his shape is like a Star, and his proportion like a
heavenly Planet, and consists of seven branches, in the outward part broad,
near the ground narrow, and it is as though it were heavy, of a tender
substance, outwardly hot and moist, inwardly cold and dry. The left side of it
is cold and moist, the right side hot and dry, and it is most temperate as
gold. Wherefore his Elements cannot be separated one from another as in other
herbs, but it may be purged from his Feces, for his fixing lets that the
Elements cannot be separated, for the fire will ascend with the air by the
Balneum, as we will hereafter teach. The earth may be separated from his Feces,
and the Feces likewise from the fire and air, although it has not many dregs.
Some Latin Writers call it Lingua avis, or Birds-tongue; some call it Solaria
of the Sun, of Lunaria it is called the Moon; the Fleming calls it Sindow. But
the old Philosophers have kept secret the qualities as yet for the mavelous
effect it works. And it is marvel, says Arnoldus de Villa nova that a man
should die that eats every day some of it in his gross substance, what will
it then work when it is brought unto his finenesse, and cleansed from his
Feces? It has this great virtue in it, that if it be put into a glass,
wherein there is poison mingled with wine, or any other cup that is poisoned,
straightwayes the glass will fly in Pieces, but if it be a stone pot of
Alabaster, or such like, the Wine will so boil, as though there were a violent
fire under it, and all the wine will run out until there be nothing left in
the vessel: Also if any man carry this herb about him, and happen on his
enemies, they shall have no power to hurt, but contrariwise to show him all
kind of duty. Also if any man be bewitched either in body, or in his art,
that is in Cookerie, Brewing, or Baking, or by any other means, this herb
carried about him makes him free from the witchcraft. If it be also tied upon
the belly of a woman with child, she shall straightwayes be delivered, although
the child were dead and rotten within, as it has been oftentimes proved by
experience. This herb carried about one, or a little thereof every day eaten
as long as it is used, preserves a man from the Falling Sickness. Moreover,
if a man be taken with the Apoplexy, that his mouth be drawn aside, and his
speech and senses taken from him, they shall be all restored again, if the sick
drink the juice of this herb streined, as has been oftentimes proved.
Moreover if it be hanged about the neck of one that is possessed of a spirit,
so long as he carries that about him, he shall be quiet as a Lamb, and the
power of the spirit shall be taken away. Make a proof, and you shall find it
true. The bleeding at the nose is by and by stayed, if you hold that herb in
your mouth. They that are wearied with travel, if they drink the juice thereof
in wine, they are by and by so refreshed, as if they had not labored or gone
no journey, it does comfort the Sinews, Muscles, Tendons, and all the whole
nature. Wounds are also cured therewith, if it be drunk ten days together in
Wine or Ale, if the wound be washed with the same drink, and bound up with a
cloth wet in the same. The pain of the teeth, is by and by appeased, if that
herb be laid unto it. All these things have been often proved and found true.
If it will do such things whilst it is yet hindered with his gross matter,
what will it work when it is brought to his perfection? My Son, know this for a
truth that there is no herb that grows upon the earth to be compared unto this
in strength and goodness, therefore take heed that you do not neglect it, but
diligently remember and keep the secret close from them that are not of the
nature of our children, and from the ignorant. For if this herb did not grow
so plentifully, and the properties thereof were known, it would be more
esteemed then gold or precious stones, for the Effects of the Quintessence are
mavelous, as hereafter shall appear.

Now there remains that we must teach how to bring this herb to his highest
degree, and to his Quintessence. First, it is to be gathered, the same having
his course in his own house, that is in the Lion, and the Moon behold him with
a sinister quadrate Aspect. It is to be gathered whole, with roots, leaves and
flowers, so that there be neither earth, dirt, nor other herbs mingled
withal. Neither must it by amy means touch any water or be made moist.
Therefore you must take heed that you gather it not in rainie weather, or moist
weather: but rather when the Sun does shine hottest upon it, gather great store
of it, and stamp it well in a mortar of Marble, and put it in a Cucurbite of
stone with a head and receiver luted, and set it in Balneo, and distill away all
the water, until it be so dry like powder, and there will rise together with
the water of the color of most fine gold, which only happens in this herb,
and in none other, and when there remains no more liquor, yet leave the
cucurbite for three or four days in Balneo, and boil it night and day that all
the moisture may be perfectly separated and drawn away, then let it cool, and
take away the receiver, and stop it diligently, then take off the head, and
take out the matter and beat it in a Marble mortar into most fine powder that
it may pass through a thick sieve, put this powder again into an earthen
cucurbite, and pour on your water and air, and stir it with a wooden ladle,
and cover the mouth of the cucurbite close with a tile, and set it in a warm
bath by the space of nine days to putrify, every day stirring it with a
wodden ladle four or five times, and cover the cucurbite again with a tile,
setting a weight of lead upon it, at the nine days end take your vessel out of
the Balneo, and that which is in it, strein it into an earthen vessel glased,
and strein it hard until the matter dry. Then take this dry powder, and put
it into his cucurbite, and cover it with a tile, and keep it in a warm place
until I teach you what you shall do with it.

1. The moist liquor which is drawn from it will be red, for the Element of
fire is there present with the air and the water, put that liquor into a
cucurbite of stone, and put on a head, and lute it well, and set it in Balneo
with a Receiver well luted, and distill away all the water, with the air
severally from the fire in a boiling bath, until there will no more distill, and
the fire will pass away in the bottom, then take away the vessel out of the
bath and stop it well until I teach thee what is further to be done.

2. Then take again the stone cucurbite wherein your powder is contained, which
I bad you before to keep, and pour on the fire and the air, and stir it well
with a wooden ladle, and set it in a warm bath nine days more, and cover it
with a tile, and stir it four or five times every day with a ladle as you did
before. And when the nine days are past, strein out that which is in the
Vessel, and pour the liquor into a glased vessel, the residue of the powder put
into another vessel, as you did before, and keep it so long until I teach thee
how to draw out the combustible oil.

3. Then take again the Vessel wherein your fire is, and mingle your liquor
with it which you keep in your glased vessel, where your fire and air is, and
set a head upon the vessel where your matter is, and lute it, and set it in
Balneo, and set a receiver to the bill of the head, then distill out the water
and air with a boiling bath until no more will distill, and you shall have in
the receiver water and air, take them away, and take the Vessel out of Balneo,
and you shall find remaining in the bottom like thick Turpentine, and that is
the Element of fire mingled with many Feces. Now the fire is to be separated
from the Feces in this manner, pour on your water and air upon that from
whence you draw it, and stir it with a spoon, and cover it with a tile, and let
it settle four days, and the Feces will fall into the bottom, and pour out
softly that that is clear into a clean cucurbite, that no Feces pass; withal
stop the Vessel wherein the Feces are, and set it by. But that Vessel that
contains the water fire, and air, set it in Balneo with a head and receiver
fitted and well luted, and distill the water and air in that same degree. And
when it will distill no more, take away the receiver: Let the vessel cool, and
you shall find in the bottom your fire, which keep in his vessel well stopped,
and pour in your water and air again upon the Feces, from whence you did draw
them, and stir them with a spoon, and let it settle four days, then pour it
out softly from his Feces into the vessel that holds your fire, so that no
Feces be mingled withal, cover your vessel wherein your Feces remain, and set
it up. But your Vessel, wherein your water, air, and fire, is set again in
Balneo as I showed you, and distill away the water and air, for they two do
always pass away together, and the fire remains in the bottom. Pour on the
water and air again upon the Feces, and stir it with a spoon, then let it
settle four days, (this is now the third repetition, whereby you have
separated the water and air from the Feces,) and that which is clear pour out
into the Vessel that holds your fire. Then put your Feces unto the first
which I bad you keep, in the which your combustible oil is. For now you have
drawn your fire out of your Feces: therefore distill your water with the air,
and when it will distill no more, take away your Vessel, and you shall find
in the bottom the Element of fire not yet pure, but foul and full of dregs,
pour on therefore the water and air again, and stir it well with a spoon or
ladle, cover it, and let it stand, and settle four days, then pour out that
which is clear into another clean vessel, and set aside the Vessel wherein your
Feces are. But the Vessel wherein your fire, water, and oil are, set it in
Balneo to distill as long as it will distill, then take it out, and pour the
liquor distilled into the vessel where your feces are, and do as I taught you
to work with the feces, until you have your element of fire without any
feculent or gross substance.

When you have distilled away the water and air from the fire, and suffered it
to settle four days, and that all be clear without any feces, then shall you
have your pure fire. Therefore put all your feces together unto your first
feces, where your combustbile oil is. Afterward take a great Cucurbite of
glass, and put all your three Elements into it, and set it in ashes with a
Limbeck and a Receiver fitted and luted, and kindle a gentle fire, first in
your furnace, and increase it more and more, until the fire and air be passed,
and that your Limbeck begin to wax red within. Then make the heat of your fire
moderate, until all your element of fire be passed, and the head red like
blood, and the water and air shall swim upon it like oil: by this means these
three Elements shall be brought to their highest essence, and be perfectly
rectified. Take away the Receiver, and stop it diligently, until your earth be
prepared, and know, that in the dust and feces there remains yet a
combustible oil, which you may extract by a discensory, if you will. It is
good against the cold Gout, for Members benommed, and Sinews too much
mollified. If thou be weary of this labor, put this powder or feces into a
reverberatory, that they may be mingled with a gentle fire, until it be as
white as snow; which being done, put it into a large cucurbite of stone, and
pour on a great quantity of water twice distilled, it is not material how much
water you pour on, and stir it well with a wooden ladle or spoon five or six
times, always cover it diligently with a tile, and after four days suffer it
to cool, and let it stand four days and settle, then pour out the clear from
the feces warily into another clean vessel, and pour on fresh distilled water
as before, stir it with your spoon, and keep it two days in Balneo as before,
then suffer it to cool and settle, and pour out the clear from the feces, and
put it to the first water; do this the third time, and then cast away the
feces, for they are good for nothing: All your waters that you have drawn,
distill by Balneo, or, for the more speed, by ashes, that all the water may
rise, and that there remain in the bottom a dusty matter, pour on distilled
water again, stir it, and keep it in Balneo by the space of four and twenty
hours, then let it cool and settle, and pour out that which is clear gently
from the feces: Pour on again more common water upon them, and stir it, set it
in Balneo ten or twelve hours, take it out, let it settle, and pour the clear
unto the first water, and cast away the feces, they are nothing worth. Repeat
this work so often, until there remain no feces after it has settled. Then
shall you have your earth rectified from all his feces, which you shall congeal
and dry, that it may be like powder or dust: Then join that with your other
elements in the glass, and it will straight resolve into his element, for the
element of water is there present: set them all together in a furnace upon
ashes, put on a Head with a Receiver well luted; the head must have a hole in
the top, that with a funnell the liquour may be poured in, and always stopped
safely. Make your fire in your furnace first gentle, afterward greater, until
that, that is fermented, do pass; but all is not to be drawn out, but about
half a sextary of the liquour with the water, that the matter may remain moist;
for if you should drive out all, it would congeale into an hard mass, and
break the glass in the furnace. Then open the hole which is in the top of the
Head, and with a funnell pour in that which is in the Receiver; but first it
must be made warm, least by pouring in the cold liquour the glass do break,
but if you suffer the glass to cool, you may pour it in without any danger.
Repeat this inbibition ten or twelve times, afterward distill out whatsoever
will be distilled, so long as any thing will pass by the neck of the Limbeck:
For after this tenth distillation, the earth will be no more congealed, but
will rest in the bottom like a red golden Oil. Inbibe it again, pouring on the
liquour, and distilling it until all the elements pass together by the
Limbeck, and that nothing at all do remain in the bottom of the vessel. Then
give thanks to God for his mavelous gifts, which he has distributed unto his
Philosophers, and has given them so great knowledge of things as they uttered
in this work, which is altogether heavenly, and rather divine then humane: For
it is a great marvel in this life, that man's understanding can bring these
inferior things to so great perfection that they have attained, even to the
highest degree of virtue. Truly it is the work of the Holy Ghost, which has
put it into the minds of men. For I do affirm, that whosoever has this herb
so prepared, that he may help all the infirmities of man's body, whether they be
curable or uncurable, except natural death, which is ordained before unto
every man of God. Yea, this I dare be bold to say, that if a man do use daily
the weight of one scruple of this Quintessence, or the Quintessence of Sugar,
and potable Gold, wherein Pearls are dissolved, or the Quintessence of
Selandine, that man by Gods help shall not die before the day of the great
judgment; for the humors in man's body can by no means predominate one over
another, as in the thirty six Chapter of Vegetals is taught, where is treated
of the Quintessence of all Medicinal things, and there it is showed, that by
Gods help the life of man may be prolonged even until that day, void and free
from all diseases and sickness. And further, that man may be preserved in the
state he was in at thirty years of age, and in the same strength and force of
wit; and upon that do all the Philosophers agree, that a man may continue in
the same state as long as in an earthly Paradise. This is so plainly and at
large showed in that Chapter, that will you, nill you, you shall be enforced to
conceive it in your mind to believe it, and to confess it to be true:
Therefore it is not needful to reason much of the force and qualities of this
Quintessence, but whatsoever disease a man be infected withal, give him to
drink with Wine so much of this Quintessence as a nutshell will hold, and in
short space he shall be healed, as it were miraculously, according as the
disease is, violent or gentle. But if you give this Quintessence to drink,
mixed with the Quintessence of Sugar, with potable Gold, wherein Pearls are
dissolved, and with the Quintessence of Selandine, within one day you shall
cure all the diseases whatsoever they be; hereby it does appear, that it is
rather a divine work then humane. Therefore give God the praise, and take heed
that you do not utter this secret, for Tyrants would by that means prolong
their lives, that they might bring to pass their wicked purposes, whereof both
you and I should be the occasion. Therefore keep it secret, for it is one of
the greatest secrets amongst all the vegetals, whereunto no treasure may be
compared. Work therefore, and distribute liberally unto the poor, and God shall
give thee eternal felicity.

Virtue increases by exercise.
The Spagyrick Antidotary of the preparation and making of Medicines against
gunshot, taken out of the Surgery of Josephus Quirsitanus.
IT is an old and true saying of the Poet, that there is nothing more imperious
than an ignorant man, which thinks nothing well done, but that he does
himself, which thing, as it may be seen in many other Arts, ye^ most especially
in this, which is called the Spagyrick Art. For we see every where certain men,
I know not what they be, puffed up with a certain barbarous and foolish pride,
which with great scorn inveigh against those Medicines which are drawn out of
the metalline Mines: which notwithstanding it is apparent were in use, and had
in great estimation with the chief ancient Physicians, as we have declared in
that book, which we have set forth of the Spagyrick preparation of Medicines.
And what, I pray you, is the cause of this anger, or rather madness, but that
(as they themselves confess) they know not the preparation of them? O happy
Arts, if only Artificers might judge of them, as Fabius is reported sometimes
to have said: Then are they unhappy, of whom the ignorant and unlearned fear
not so rashly to give judgment, which never yet understood from whence, or
why, this is called the Spagyrick Art, which learned men of two greek words
have so named; because by that Art a certain subtle and spiritual nature is
drawn, gathered, and pressed out, wherein the force and effect of the Medicine
does chiefly consist; the great and incomparable commodity whereof, as it
appears in many other diseases, so shall it chiefly be known in curing wounds
by gunshot: As I trust (God willing) it shall much more happily be tried and
found out, by the preparations of Medicines animal, vegetable, and mineral,
and by other Essences drawn out of Mercury, Sulphur, Vitriol, Arsenick, Iron,
Copper, Lead, and Litarge, and also out of Antimony, and such other minerals,
as also out of the gross and fat bodies of simple metals, of whom it is far
off, that the force should be so great (although the ancient Physicians have
used them to cure Wounds and Ulcers, as their Writings do testify) as the
force of their spirits, which may be called, as it were, their souls. But
peradventure some of those backbiters will say, why are not we content with
those Medicines and Remedies, which the learned Antiquity has delivered unto
us, and that Hyppocrates and Gallen, the ancient Pillars of our Art, and
others, have set forth in their Monuments? why seek we new ways never heard of
before, especially unknown to the Apothecaries? But some of us will answer,
that the only remedy of Mercury precipitate, is the only remedy (to pass
over other) which very lately they have begun to use in curing of Wounds by
gunshot, and other malign Ulcers, were sufficient to answer this their
question, yea, and to reprove their folly joined with intolerable pride. But
if authority be asked for, I think Gesner, Guinter, Andernack, Severine, (to
pass over a great many other) will be for us of great authority with the
learned, as these slanderers; especially, because the learning of these famous
men is confirmed by their learned Writings and Monuments, that those tongues
might count it a great honor unto them, to confess themselves their
Scholars. It were easy for me to bring forth many other arguments, if I did
not see the folly of these back-biters to be so great, whereof truly I am
ashamed, especially when I behold some of their books lately set forth,
wherein, contrary to the purpose of the Treatise, strange things are enforced,
that (as the old Proverb says) the ointment seems to consist in nothing, as
though they pertain to the purposed treating of curing the Gout, certain
invective digressions I know not what of the beginning of things, of the
original of metals and Philosophers stone (which of them is called
Morosophocus) or did in any point seem to agree with it. Therefore again and
again I am enforced to cry out, O happy Arts, if only Artificers might judge
of them. How far unlike was the purpose of many old men, the which if they
were ignorant of any thing, which they understood was known of others, even in
far distant Countries, they spared no labor to go see them. Plato inflamed
with desire to learn those things which he knew not, went into Egypt, and
after to Tarentum, to Architas, and over all Italy, to hear the other
Pythagorical Philosophers: Apollonius Tyanius traveled through the kingdom of
Persia, and passed over the Mountain Caucasus, and visited the Albanes,
Scythians, Massagets, and all the rich kingdoms of India; afterward was
carried unto the Brachmanes, and heard Jarehas in his chair of gold disputing
of the hidden causes of things, and of the hidden mysteries of nature; from
thence by the Elamites, Babylonians, Chaldees, Medes, Assirians, Arabians, and
Palestines, he returned to Alexandria, and from thence went into Ethiopia to
hear the Gymnosophists, and to learn their secret and hidden Arts. This virtue
is truly to be followed, and not the sluggishnesse of those slouthful
followers, which having scarce once moved their foot from their country fires,
yet will disallow this Spagerick Art, and think no further labor to be taken
in searching of the truth, when notwithstanding, that Art does make open unto
us the mavelous and hidden secrets of nature; neither in my judgment are
they unworthily contemned of those, which with their manifold perils and
travels have sought out those secrets of nature. But, I pray you, what
foolishness is this, to forbid us to use any other Medicines, then those which
were known in old time? As though Rhabarbe, then which no Medicine is more in
use this day, then were known to the old Physicians: Further, to what purpose
is it, that they object unto us the Sulphury metalline venomous stinks (as they
call them) by whose smell and drawn breath (for these are their contumelious
words) they be almost strangled that come into the dens of those Cyclops? But
is it unknown unto those slanderers and Sycophants, that the old Physicians
made very many Medicines of most filthy things, as of the filth of the ears,
sweat of the body, of women's menstrues (and that which is horrible to be
spoken) of the dung of man and other beasts, Spittle, Urine, Flies, Mice, the
ashes of an Owls head, the hoves of Goats and Asses, the Worms of a rotten
tree, and the scurfe of Mules, as may be gathered out of the Writings of Galen,
Aetius, Aegineta, Dioscor. Marcel. Plin. Serap. to pass the metallines, which
it is evident they did also use. Truly, when I consider with my self the pride
of these fools, which disdain this metalline part of Physic, which after
their manner contumeliously they call Chymericam, and therefore can neither
help their own, nor many other diseases. I call to mind a Story, peradventure
known unto them of Herachto Ephesio, which being sick of a dropsy, despising
the help of Physicians, anointing himself over with cow dung, set himself in
the Sun to dry, and falling asleep was torn in pieces of dogs: but these are
more then sufficiently answered unto these fools and slanderers.

Now I will declare what is my purpose and scope in the Treatise; verily to
prescribe plainly hereafter, not those things which are already common, or (as
it is commonly said) known to blind men and Barbers, lest I might seem to
imitate those that use to write Rhapsodias, and heaps, but the method and way
of preparing Medicines by Spagerick art, that pertain unto Gunshot, which I
know are yet unknown unto many Physicians and Chirurgians. And this I can truly
confess, that I am induced for two causes to do it: First, to provoke those
that are better learned, if they have any better Medicines to utter them, as
also that I might specially help my country and mankind: unto the which (the
more is the grief) there is too much need of those kind of Medicines in these
most lamentable and cruel times, wherein it has so long been bloudded with
domestical and civil wars; but to encounter with their slanders which cry out,
that these kind of Medicines do not only require long and difficile
preparation, but also that they are so dear that every one cannot easily use
them. I have thought good therefore first to set down common Medicines, and
then to come to those which I do far more esteem, as indeed they are far more
excellent then the other, as by their preparation you may know. Albeit also I
have determined to have consideration of the poor and common Soldier, and to
set down them apart that shall help the rich.

Therefore the Chirurgians are to be admonished, that when they go into the
wars, that they take with them these things ready prepared, which are to be
had at most Apothecaries.

There be made other Remedies for the aforesaid intents, the making whereof we
have described in their proper places, which I commit to the judgment of the
skillfull Chirurgians to use wisely, as the disease and party affected does
require. Now there remains to speak of drinks for wounds, before we teach the
preparations of Medicines.

De potionibus vulnerariis.
These potions for Wounds, although they drive not out the humors downwards,
yet prevail they very much to cleanse Wounds, because they cleanse superfluous
humors, and the blood from all filth, and by a certain mavelous quality
wherewith they excel, they knit the broken bones, and help the sinews that are
hurt by Wounds, and helping nature, they at the last fill the Wound with flesh,
and close them up without using any other remedy: when as I saw in Germany, the
mavelous and almost incredible effect which came by the use of these potions,
even in curing desperate Ulcers, I thought it not meet to pass over the
mention of them, and that so much the rather, because I knew the ^se of them in
time past was allowed, but now, through the negligence of Physicians: to be
almost grown out of use. Also I have experienced those potions to be taken, not
only as Medicines, but also as nourishments, and to help all the passions and
incommodities whereunto Wounds are subject. The Simples whereof the Medicines
are made, are these:

Cyclaminus, Consolida major, Consolida media, quam Sophiam nonnulli vocant,
Sabina, Galanga, Vinca pervinca, Centaurum, Ophioglosson, Betonica,
Aristolochia, Veronica, Agrimonia, Verbena, Serpentaria, Persicaria,
Arthemisia, Lilium convallium, Zedoaria, Pyrola, Sperma ceti, Cancri
fluviatiles, Nux vomica, Astaci, Mumia, Macis, Bolus Armena.

You shall much better draw out the strength of those simples then the common
sort, if you put them into a tun of white Must, and digest them there two
months, or if you cut the green herbs very small, and wring out the juice of
them into a Pelican or blind Limbeck, or circulate them three or four days in
Balneo Mariae. This last way is most convenient for them that are forbidden the
use of Wine, especially if they be wounded in the head. The distilled waters of
them be also good, if they be taken dryly by themselves morning and evening,
with dose and manner convenient: Or if white Wine be delayed with them (if it
be granted to the wounded.) Here follows the composition of the vulnerary
potions.

A vulnerary Potion to be given the first seven days.
Take of both Conferies Veronica, Sow-bread, ana, M. i. Astacos purged number.
iiii. white Wine two measures, circulate them in Balneo three days, strain it,
and give every morning one spoonful.

Or take of the eyes of Crabs in powder. ss. Mumia. ii. Bole Armenae. i. ss.
the Herbs of Agrimoni, Ophioglosson, Veronica, and Sowbread, ana, M. i. Sperma
Ceti. i. infuse them in white Wine a whole night in Balneo, take of this two
spoonfuls morning and evening if need be, it puts away the inflammation very
much, and helps the burning.

Potions to be given at other times of the grief.
Take of Macis, the eyes of Crabs, Zedoaria, ana,. iii. Mumia, Gallingal the
less, ana,, ii. Nu^is vomicae. i. ss. beat them grosely, and put them in a
glass vessel, pouring thereto of white Wine one measure and a half, macerate
them in a soft heat two days, the dose is one spoonful in the morning, and as
much at night; the force of this potion is so great, that it cannot be
sufficiently commended.

A Potion apt for poisoned Wounds by gunshot.

Potions might be made of the aforesaid simples, which I have left to the
judgment of the expert Physician; notwithstanding this one thing I will add,
that the use of them has many opportunities to cure Wounds by gunshot, as
also the Canker, and all malign, desperate, and eating Ulcers, of all which
the Physician shall take very great profit, if he prepare the Potions with the
Essence of the vulnerary simples spagyrically extract, as we have taught in
another place.

A brief declaration of Spagyricall Medicines.
FOr as much as now remains to declare the Spagyrick preparation of those
simples, which pertain to the cure of Wounds by gunshot, we will use the same
method we have before used, whereby this our Treatise may be the plainer.

The Spagyricall Preparation of Medicines before rehearsed.
THe dregs of Wine or crude Tartar brought into powder, put into a Retort of
glass or earth with his Recipient, make fire by degrees as is done to the
making of strong water, there will rise great plenty of white spirits, which
will turn into water, and thick stinking oil, separate the oil by a Funnel,
and keep it to your use.

But the Salt of Tartar you shall draw out of the Feces (which they call the
dead head) which are left in the Retort. Those you shall dissolve in warm
water, and after filter that which is dissolved twice or thrice, coagulate it
at the fire by vapouring away the water, and the salt will remain in the
bottom of the vessel, which if you again dissolve and coagulate diverse times,
you shall purge it clear like Crystal.

This Christaline salt if you put it into a glass, and set it in a Wine cellar
or other moist place, within few days it will resolve into a clear oil, very
excellent to cleanse the spots and ulcers of the face.

Take crude Tartar lb ii. Saltpeter, Salt of Soot, of the Feces of Vinegar,
ana four ounces, Calcis Vivae, six ounces, all broken very small put into a
vessel not glased, but well stopped. Calcine it twelve hours, dissolve that
that is calcined in warm water, and distill it by filter, after coagulate it,
and cleanse it again, repeating three times your calcinations, dissolutions,
and coagulations; then put all into a Limbeck, and put on distilled vinegar
that it be covered four fingers. Distill the Vinegar in Balneo M. and there
will come forth a sweet liquor, then pour on the Vinegar again to distill, this
do so long until it be no more sweet but sour, as when you poured it on first,
and so rise in the Limbeck. Then distill all in a strong fire by a Retort, and
there will come forth a hot oil, the commodities whereof can scarcely be
declared.

After the same manner if you will, you may distill all the salt of Tartar by a
Limbeck, whereof you shall make a most excellent and wholesome oil.

Vinegar being distilled by a Limbeck, the Feces remain in the bottom of the
Vessel, which first dried, afterward with a violent fire, if they be driven
out by a Retort, there comes forth a very red and sharp oil. Then if you do
again dissolve the dead head or Feces in warm water, filter, and coagulate it,
the salt of Vinegar will rest, in the bottom, the which is very profitable for
all eating Ulcers.

Soot brought into fine powder, dissolve it in distilled Vinegar in Balneo, and
separating all the mensture, that which remains in the bottom dissolve and
coagulate again, so long till it come to white Salt, which in a moist place
will dissolve into oil, very apt to cure the Gangraena and all malign ulcers.

Bole Armoniack made into fine powder, dissolve it in the sour phlegm of Alum,
then separate the phlegm by Balneum and pour on other. Do this three times, and
then the Bole will be turned into a very fat oil, which with a very soft fire
is dried, and brought into powder most apt to stanch blood, wheresoever it
break out.

Take of Cloves beaten in powder one pound, simple water, or Aqua vitae, which
is better, six pound, infuse them to digest in Balneo or dung four days, then
put them in a Limbeck with his Refrigatorie, distill it according to art, and
separate the oil from the water by a funnell, and keep it for your use. After
the same manner shall you draw the oils of Sage, Juniper, Amber, Turpentine,
Myrrh, Frankincense, Sarcocolla, Mastick and Euphorbium. We have written
another better way to draw oils out of the foresaid things in the Spagyrick
preparation of Medicines.

Wheat being put into a Retort with the spirit of wine, digest it eight days,
then distill it with a violent fire, that which is distilled pour again upon
the dead head, digest it again, and distill it again, if you reiterate this
three times, there will come forth a most excellent oil for Gangrena and
Carcinomata.

Take of the flowers of Hypericon small cut two pound, oil of Turpentine i.
pound, yolks of Eggs, 20. Aqua vitae half a pound, mingle them all together,
and let it putrify in hot dung one whole month, then wring it out, and set in
the Sun two months.

After the same manner is the Balm of Visci pemorum made, or with oil Olive,
first purified in Balneo.

Take of the flowers of Hypericon, one pound, of the Mucilage of the root of
the great Cumferie, four ounces, flowers of Camomil, Verbascum, ana, p. ii.
Oil of Eggs and Turpentine, ana lb ss. Aqua Vitae one pound, Myrrh,
Frankincense, Mastick, Mumia, ana two ounces, Red Sugar vi. ounces, putrify
all in dung one month in a vessel diligently stopped, then wring it out, and
circulate it in Balneo three days, afterward with a soft fire boil it to the
substance of a Balm.

Take of the leaves of the Misselto of the Appletree cut small two pound, put
them into a Vessel of glass, putting thereto Buds of the Poplar tree half a
pound, oil of the grease of a Badger, and of Butter, ana four ounces,
Turpentine vi. ounces, oil of Worms two pound and a half, good white wine two
pound, digest all well stopped in very hot dung two months, then press it and
circulate it, and with a soft fire boil it until the liquors be consumed,
there cannot be found a more excellent Medicine to assuage aches and pains.

The juice of the leaves and roots of herbs you shall purify until it be
clear, pouring to it so much Aqua vitae, and digest it in Balneo in a glass
15. days, then separate that water by distillation, and there remains in the
bottom the slime or muslage of the herbs.

Steep the leaves and roots of herbs in common water filtred, or that which is
better, in white wine eight days, then let them boil three days with a soft
fire under them. Then wring them out and purify it, then boil them with a
soft fire, until they come to the thickness of honey, which we call the slime
of Mucilage. By this rule you shall draw out of both Comferies, Cynoglosso,
Centaurie, Vinca pervinca, Aristolochie, the root of Henbane, and the middle
Bark of Tilia their Mucilage very profitable for the foresaid Medicines.

Out of the flowers of red Poppie or their juice you shall draw a water by a
Limbeck very profitable to cool.

The salt of man's Urine has an excellent quality to cleanse; It is made thus,
First, the Urine is to be filtered, then coagulated, after with distilled
Vinegar dissolved, and again coagulated, these must be reiterated three or four
times.

Melt Wax at the fire, and boil it with Wine till it be consumed, do it so
long until it crack no more; take lb. i. of Wax thus prepared, Alum calcined
lb. ss. Sage leaves M. i. put all into a Limbeck with his Receiver, and distill
it with a mean fire: First there will come forth a gross oil, thick, hard,
and white, which must be distilled again as before, and three times reiterated,
and so you shall make an excellent oil of Wax for all greifs of the sinews: In
like manner is the oil of Rosin and pitch made.

Out of Honey you shall first draw an excellent water by Balneu^, afterward you
shall put unto the dead head, or feces that are left, sand or flint stones
calcined, that the matter boil not up, which you shall drive out by a Retort
of glass, giving fire by degrees, and so you shall distill a yellowish clear
oil, together with a gross impure oil; let all digest again four or five
days, after distill it again by a Limbeck in sand, and there will come out a
pure red oil swimming upon the water; this water is sour, almost like Vinegar
distilled, and is very good against the Gangrena; but the oil which burns
like Aqua vitae has mavelous qualities, especially if it be circulated
certain days with the spirit of Wine; for the spirit being after separated,
there remains a sweet oil of pleasant savor, good for Wounds by gunshot,
and eating Ulcers.

Out of the feces which remains is drawn a Salt, first being calcined with a
fire of reverberation, dissolving it with his proper menstrua, or common water
distilled, filtering and coagulating it three times: It is good for all rotten
Ulcers. This Salt you shall mingle with his proper burning Oil according to
art, and you shall reap greater commodity thereof then is lawful to be spoken.

Take of Honey not separated from his Wax lb. ii. Tartar made into powder lb.
i. let them putrify together in dung fifteen days, and distill it by a
Retort, and there will first come a clear water, then a yellowish; put these
again upon the dead head, and putrify it again other fifteen days, after
distill it again, and this do three times, and you shall have an excellent
oil of Honey.

Take Butter first molten in white Wine, and then distill it with a mean fire,
and there will distill out an oil greatly swaging pains and supplying: So
shall you make oil of Larde and all greases.

Take a hundred yolks of Eggs first sodden hard, put them into a Cucurbite, and
make fire by degrees, first there will come out a water, after a yellowish oil
swimming upon the water, last a thick oil: The water is good for all spots in
the face, the oil to appease all griefs and aches.

Boil Creveses in water of Orpine in a double vessel well stopped one whole
day; after distill it, pouring the water three times upon the feces, then let
it be kept, it is very good for inflammations, burnings, and the Carcynomata.

The sperme or seed of Frogs is gathered in the month of March, and is
distilled by a glass Limbek, and thereof is drawn a water very commodious for
inflammations and burnings.

Eggshels, or the shells of Snailes, are reverberated in a sharp fire three
days, until they be brought into a very white Calce; but if they be sprinkled
with Vinegar whilst they are calcined, the Calce will be the lighter, and
apter to work his force.

Mercury first washed and prepared, according to Gebers prescription, dissolve
with the double weight of common Strong-water, then distill it four times, and
pour it so often again upon the feces, and so it is brought into a very red
powder, out of the which, being reverberate at the fire, and drawn away, the
spirits of the Strong-water, which otherwise would move great pain; but it were
better, if it were washed with the phlegm of Alum and Vinegar distilled, and
the water of Eggs, for by that means the sharpness is taken away.

But it is better to prepare Mercury with often sublimations, and to fix it
being quickened again, and purged from his filthy earth and superfluous
humidity, with the water which we have described in the book, by me published,
of the Spagyrick preparation: But if all men do not understand that
description for the dark words of Art, it shall not be incommodious to fix the
Mercury with common Strong Water, three times poured on and drawn away, and to
bring it into a red powder, and that with a sufficient violent fire, that all
the sharpness and venom of the menstrew may be drawn away, which shall much
the better be done, if this water following be mingled with it, and by often
distillation separated.

Take of distilled Vinegar lb. ii. ss. the phlegm of Alum lb. i. ss. calx of
Eggshels. vi. distill all till it be dry: Take of this water lb. iii. of
Mercury precipitate as before lb. i. mingle all well according to art, distill
it by a Limbeck, pouring the water again unto the feces three times, last of
all, drive all out until it be dry, and there will remain a powder in the
bottom, which grind upon a Marble, and put it into a Limbeck, pouring on the
water aforesaid, which you shall three times distill from the feces as before:
Lastly, the Mercury precipitate must be circulated with an alcool of Wine 24.
hours: then distill away the spirit of Wine that the matter may dry, then pour
on new again, and circulate and distill it as before, and that do four or five
times, and then you have attained the perfect preparation of Mercury, whose
qualities cannot be sufficiently commended in curing of sundry diseases,
especially of the Pox, whether it be taken by the mouth, or applied to the
place greived.

Make Amalgama with. iiii. of Mercury crude, and. i. of the best Tin; spread
this upon a plate of Iron, and set it in a moist place, and all will dissolve
into oil, it is also made with Mercury alone, and a plate of Tin.

Mercury, as the manner is, three times sublimed with Salt of Vitriol, at the
last is mingled with the like portion of salt Armoniack, and again sublimed
three or four times, all that sublimate is dissolved into oil, out of which
the spirit of the salt Armoniack is to be drawn away; circulate all with the
Essence of Wine, and distill it so long, until the oil have lost his heat and
sharpness, and the Armoniack be separated.

It is also reduced by it self into an oil, with a very soft heat of an
Athanor, by long distance of time.

Sublime Mercury so often, with the simple Calx of Eggs well prepared, until
it be utterly extinct; to this mixture pour Vinegar distilled, alcool sated,
that it may cover it four fingers; distill the liquor from the feces four or
five times, until the Mercury be come into a very red powder, which you shall
circulate with an alcool of Wine in a Pelican eight days, separate the alcool
by a Limbeck, and there will remain in the bottom, the most precious and sweet
Balm of Mercury: It heals all desperate Ulcers, and also carbunculam in
vesica, and greatly helps these Wounds by gunshot. All other preparations of
Mercury, and the manner of using it, you shall gather out of the book which we
lately set forth.

Upon the filings of Iron often washed with salt water, pour sharp Vinegar,
that it may cover it four fingers, set it upon warm ashes eight days, every
day moving the matter, and separating the Vinegar which will be colored, and
pouring on again new, and that so long, till the Vinegar be no more colored,
which being vapoured away, take the powder that remains in the bottom, and
sublime it with a like portion of Armoniack; the same sublimate you shall
return again so often upon his feces, and sublime again until there appear the
color of a Rubie; then cast all into scalding water, that the salt may
dissolve them, by and by put to cold water, and the Balm of Mars will rest in
the bottom like the calx of Gold; pour away the water, and put to fresh again,
that the Balm may be made sweet.

Of this with the spirit of Wine alcolizat by circulations, you shall make a
red oil, most excellent for all inward Hemeroides, or Issues of blood, and to
strengthen the bowels, if one drop be mixed with conserve of Roses, or Confery,
or given with Wine.

The filings of Iron first well washed, you shall calcine with the flower of
Sulphur, or dissolve with Strong Water, then pour on very sharp Vinegar, and
set it in a warm place certain days, then reverberate it with an open fire, as
Art commands, one whole day, gathering always the flowers which remain
above, until all be converted into a very red and light powder.

After the same manner you shall make the Balm, Oil, and Crocus of Copper,
out of the which, with the four flame of Vitriol, circulating all artificially,
you shall draw a bluish Vitriol, whose qualities we have described in another
place.

Out of Saturn calcined is drawn a sweetish salt in Balneo with distilled
Vinegar, pouring it so often upon the Feces until it draw no more: The
menstrew evaporated, the salt remains in the bottom, which by often
dissolutions, and coagulations, is made Christaline, and afterward easily
dissolved into oil, being set in a moist place. But if you circulate this
Christaline salt in a Pelican, with the alcool of Wine fifteen days, and
after take away the menstrew by distillation, and put to new Wine and circulate
it, putting to a fit dose of christaline salt of Tartar, you shall make a Balm
sweeter then Sugar, which will marvellously prevail against all malign Ulcers
and diseases of the eyes.

Decoct Antimony made in powder, with a capital Lie preprepared of Tartar
calcined, and Soap ashes, and quick Lime, the space of one hour, then let it
cool, pouring upon it a little Vinegar, and there will appear a certain
redness swimming upon it, which you shall gather; then again let it boil for
one hour or two, again let it cool, and gather that which swimmeth up; do this
so often, until there appear no more redness; for it is the Sulphur of
Antimony, which dried at a soft fire, you shall keep it to good uses.

Mingle Antimony with Sugar and Alum, and put all into a Retort of glass,
make a soft fire for four or five hours, afterward increase it, and there will
come out an Oil red like blood: It is also done with Mercury sublimate, but
great heed is to be taken, lest any error be committed in the degree of fire.

Boil Sulphur prepared with oil of Linseed, with a very soft fire, and it will
be like blood congealed: Let the matter cool, put it into a Retort, and give it
fire, and there will distill out a very red oil of Sulphur: It is also done, if
you mingle Bran with your Sulphur and distill it.

Take of Sulphur Vivum P. i. with which mingle, with a soft fire, so much pure
Vitriol molten, that it may be one body; distill this by a Discentory, and there
will descend a red oil into the Receiver.

If lb. i. of the flower of Sulphur be mixed with ii. or iii. lb. of oil of
Turpentine in a dry heat, the flowers will dissolve into a red oil; then the
menstrew rightly and artificially separate, circulate the rubin of Sulphur with
the Alcool of Wine eight days, and you shall have oil of Sulphur that has
the qualities of the natural Balm.

The sour oil of Sulphur is made by Sulphur, by setting it on a fire, and
hanging over it a bell, or a large glass head, to keep the vapors which are
converted into that sour oil.

Put Vitriol beaten into powder into a Cucurbite, giving it a fire of the
second degree, and there will issue a sour water, which is called the phlegm of
Vitriol.

Take the Feces which remains in the bottom of the vessel, which is called
Colcothar, stamp that, and if you mingle flints withal, with a violent fire,
there will come out a red oil.

It is also made with the simple Colcothar, driven out with a violent fire
three days space, and there will come forth a very hot oil, which is made
sweet by circulation, with spirit of Wine tartarizated.

But if the Colcothar be dissolved in warm water, and the redness in it
separated, and the water evapourated, the Colcothar will remain sweetish; that
which remains, the redness being taken away, is called Creta Vitrioli.

But if Vitriol be drawn by the ninth, a Limbeck pouring on always the liquor
upon the dead head, and after circulating all by the space of eight days, you
shall have the spirit of Vitriol, very profitable for many things.

The phlegm of Alum is made like the phlegm of Vitriol.

But Alum is prepared, if the phlegm be five times poured upon the Feces, out
of which it was drawn and distilled, last of all dry out all the phlegm until it
be dry.

Make Brine of Salt, into which cast hot burnings stones that they may be
imbibed, those stones so imbibed, put into a Retort, giving fire by degrees,
there will comeforth a very hot oil of Salt.

I said before, that there was great force in Butyro Arsenici fixo to cure all
venomous and Malign Ulcers, it is made in this manner: Mingle christaline
Arsenick first sublimed, with only Colcothar (which does keep back his poison)
with like weight of Salt of Tartar and Saltpeter, put all into two glasses,
and fix it, giving fire the space of four and twenty hours, first very gentle,
then of the highest degree: You shall find the matter very white fixed,
resembling the color of Pearls, which dissolve in warm water, that you may
draw the Alcaly from it; and the powder which remains imbibe with oil of
Tartar, or of Talcum, which is better, and dry it at the fire, and do this
thrice: again dissolve the matter in warm water, that you may take away his
salt, and there will remain a very white powder and fixed, which will dissolve
in a moist place into a fat oil, which is anodinum like Butter.

Out of Talcum rightly and artificially calcined is drawn the spirit with
distilled Vinegar. This is dissolved into a precious oil, being set in a moist
place.

Take of the juice of Aristolochia Rotunda, and Savin, ana, iii. ounces,
Serpentaria, two ounces, spirit of Wine one pound, circulate them first the
space of 24. hours, then distill them, of this water take lb i. of Elect
Magnes made into powder four ounces, circulate them together, and distill away
the water from the Feces, reiterate this three times, and by this means you
shall obtain the preparation of Magnes.

But because (as we have said) the noblest parts are to be strengthened, and
the heart, the principal organ of life, must always be defended, these
preparations following are to be used.

Take of Theriaca of Alexandria, two ounces and a half, the best Myrrh, one
ounce and half, Saffron ii. the spirit of wine six ounces, mingle all these,
and in ashes with a very soft fire distill it, circulate that which is
distilled in Balneo eight days, and then distill it again. This water has a
most excellent quality against the Plague, and all venomous things, and does
marvellously strengthen the heart.

We have showed the extraction of the tincture of Gold, Corals, natural Balm,
and the essence of Pearl in the Book which I wrote of Preparation; it now
rests for us to speak of the Gold of Life, which all shall know to be the
most excellent and extreme Medicine in curing all diseases, which do but
consider the singular excellency of Gold in the cure of the Leprosy.

Aurum vitae is made many ways, for being calcined after the Spagyrick manner,
it is made light and spungeous, which cannot be reduced again, from which with
distilled Vinegar is drawn a salt in Balneo, whose qualities by circulations
with the spirit of Wine are so increased, that they seem to be incredible for
the curing of innumerable diseases.

Calcine gold made into thin plates so often with Salt preparate (by a
Philosophical calcination) until it be made unpalpable, the salt by
dissolutions being separate from the Alcool of gold, then calcine it again with
very white sugared salt, and to this mixture pour of the spirit of alcoolyzat,
which is proper salt, according to the precepts of Art, that it may cover it
over oely four fingers, then set on fire, that the Alcool may burn, and this
you shall do oftentimes, then pour on new Alcool of Wine, and circulate all
rightly and decently the space of four days. Then separate the menstrew with
competent distillation, and pour on new again, circulating and distilling as
you did before, so often, until all the substance of Gold be carried out by
the Limbeck: The Menstrew being separated as it ought, the Gold of Life, will
remain in the bottom the most excellent, and best of all Secrets.

Freindly Reader.
COnsidering the many sad inconveniences which happen unto Childbearing women,
in their several months of bearing, and knowing my self to have come by that
passage into this world, I thought it the duty of a Christian, to discover the
helps and remedies that might be afforded them, both to secure their issue from
abortment, and to enable them to go thorough their whole time, and to
facilitate their birth, without danger of themselves or their issue; as also to
set down their government or their Nurses after delivery, hoping I should do
an acceptable service, to engage posterity, in this task; as also to set down
Preservatives against the Plague and small Pox, with certain experimented
Remedies fit for that purpose: and having, just as my last sheets of these two
books were passing the Press, certain other Collections communicated to me,
concerning some other approved Secrets, as namely, the Experiments of a great
Navigator of this Nation, presented to our late Queen Elizabeth's own hands;
with other chief selected Collections by a late Doctor of Physic of this
Nation; I was unwilling to suffer two such pieces of very good concernment, to
perish in obscurity under my hands; hoping, as they were carefully collected,
and faithfully presented, they shall receive grateful acceptance, from your
friend

Courteous Reader,
Just as the Child-bearers Cabinet, and the other Book of the cure of the
Plague and Pox, were the last sheet on the Press, a friend of mine, knowing of
the impression, communicated to me two other physical pieces, one of them
collected by a great Navigatour, of his own Experiments, and presented, with
his own hands, to our late Queen Elizabeth; the other being a Physicians
Collections, drawn with his own hands from an ancient Manuscript found in an
Abbey at their dissolution, with some of his own Observations and Experiments
annexed thereto; and being persuaded by him that gave them me, that it would be
great pity, papers of such use and consequence should perish in the times
present, which had been so carefully formerly preserved unto posterity: I
thought good, for the public benefit of my Country, to publish them with the
two former Treatises, who were delivered me with good approbation from an able
hand, hoping what was lovinglie presented by me shall be as kindly accepted by
you, from your friend

A SHORT COMMENTARY, Concerning the Care ought to be had of Women which are
with child, such as are ready to bring forth, such as are brought to bed, and
also of Infants.
SInce many sad and incommodious things are wont to happen to women with child,
and in bringing them into the world by ignorance and carelessnesse: I thought I
should undertake a thing not unbeseeming a Christian Physician, if I should
reduce, as it were, into a brief Comment, what things were fit to observe, as
well in their time of bearing, as also in the birth, from which, being somewhat
more instructed, they might better enjoy their health, preserve their
offspring, and after birth better defend their bodies.

CHAP. I. What things are to be taken heed of in the two first Months.
SO soon as the woman shall begin to be with child, which she shall easily
know, by stopping of her monthly flux, without disease, or ancientnesse of
years; she shall abstain from all vehement motions and exercise, whether she
walk on foot, or ride on horseback, or in a Coach, or be carried in a
Horse-litter; For where the body is too much stirred, the internal membrane of
the Womb is either accustomed to be broken, or to be loosly resolved, and
thereupon abortment presently follows.

To these things the woman with child must diligently beware, that she lift not
her arms up too high, nor carry great burdens, nor repose her self on hard
and uneasy seats: But instead of exercise, which may always in some precede
before meat, she may walk on foot gently, or suffer her body and arms gently
to be rubbed and stroked, or may stretch them forth with spinning or carding.

Let her moderately use meat of good juice and easy concoction, and Wine not
too strong and too sharp, but a little mingled with water, or if she be
abstemious, she may use water wherein Cinnamon is boiled: But she may not feed
on sweet meats, sharp, and windy; she must also avoid fasting, thirst,
watching, mourning, sadness, anger, and all other perturbations of the mind.

Her familiar friends must present no unwholesome thing to her, nor so much as
name it, least she should desire it, and not be able to get it, and so minister
her an occasion of abortment, or the Child carry with it some foul
impressions. But if she desire chalk, clay, or coals, let beans boiled with
sugar be given unto her: or if she cannot get her longing, let her presently
drink a large draught of pure cold water.

CHAP. II. Order for the third Month.
BEfore the fourth month be ended, she must neither be let blood, nor have her
body evacuated with any purgative medicine.

But if too much blood abound, or some incident disease happen, which may
require evacuation, you shall use cupping-glasses with scarification, and a
little may be drawn from the shoulders and arm, especially if she have been
formerly accustomed to them.

CHAP. III. From the fourth Month.
When now the fourth month is past, bloodletting and physic is permitted,
especially if it be gentle, and mild, such as best may agree with women with
child, and tender or delicate persons: And by Hyppocrates precept may be
conceded even until the seventh month.

CHAP. IIII. From the fifth,, sixth, and seventh Month,
FRom that time forward none of the before mentioned remedies is wont, or ought
from thence to be used, because the Babe being now become greater, stands in
need of greater nourishment and blood, and also can bear no commotion of
physic.

Although sometimes I have met with women, which have so much abounded with
blood, that unless they had been let blood in the second month, they would
have aborted in the third; others again, unless they should attempt the same
in the seventh or eight month, they could not carry their great belly so long,
or else would be delivered of a dead issue.

But since these things happen but to few, they may not be granted to all, but
we must provide for every one according to their nature and constitution.

And this is to be prohibited to all which are with child, that they give not
way to take any blood from the ancle bone of the foot, during the whole time of
the woman's going, but in stead thereof, if the disease so require, an ounce of
Manna in the broth of a Cock, or so much Cassia fistula, or of Sirrups made of
Damask-roses infused in May dew, about the quantity of an ounce, with a little
water of Cinnamon, may safely be taken a little before meat.

But if the belly be bound only without any apparent disease, the broth of a
Chicken, or of Veal sodden, with Oil, or with the decoction of Mallows, or
marsh-Mallowes, Mercury, and Linseed, put up in a glister by the lower parts
will not be amiss, yet in a lesser measure then is wont to be given in other
Children, to wit, of the decoction five ounces, of common Oil three ounces, of
Sugar two ounces, of Cassia fistula one ounce. But sharper Purgations, as also
Suppositories made of Honey and Salt, are altogether hurtful to great bellyed
women, or such as lie in childbed. But of fat Pork, which they call Lard, or
the yolks of Eggs without salt, Purgations and Glysters are commended. But if
she will not take a Glyster, either for modesty or otherwise, because she was
not accustomed to take it, one or two yolks of new laid Eggs, or a few Pease
pottage warm, with a little salt and sugar, supped up a little before meat,
will be very convenient.

But if the belly shall be sometimes distended and stretched out with wind, a
little Fennelseed and Anniseeds reduced into powder, and mingled with Honey or
with Sugar, made after the manner of an Electuary will do very well.

But if the thighs and feet swell, let them be anointed with Oxphrodinum
(which is a liquid Medicine made with Vinegar and Rose Water) mingled with a
little Salt.

CHAP. V. The eighth Month
IN the eighth month, which is usually perilous, the better diets, rather
than plentiest, will be most commodious. But as they must abate their diet, so
their bodily exercise must increase. And because then women with child, by
reason of the sharp humors alter the belly, are accustomed to weaken both
their spirits and strength; they may well take before meat an Electuary of
Diarrhodon, or Aromaticum Rosatum, or Diamargariton, in the morning before
meat, and sometimes they may ^ick a little Honey; even as they which loath and
nauseate their meat, may take green Ginger condited with Sugar, or the rindes
of Citrons and Oranges condited; as also it is usual sometimes to take
specificall Sirrups. Moreover, let the woman with child often use Honey for the
strengthening of the Infant. When she is not far from her labor, or bringing
forth, she shall eat daily seven tosted Figs before meat, least the seconds may
be bound up; but if they shall be restrained and stay firm, they may be
resolved: But the woman with child may not eat salt and powdered meats, least
the child be born without nails.

CHAP. VI. In the ninth Month.
IN the ninth month, being near their time, they must not be idle, neither sit
much, nor stoop much, nor lie on their sides, so that the child may not well
turn it self, but ought to lie with her face upward, neither shall she bend her
self much, lest the child be infolded and wrapped up in the umbilical ligaments
and bonds, by which means it oftentimes perishes; but she must walk, and
stir often, and exercise her self, rather by going upward than downward: Let
her use light and easy meats of digestion, as damask-Prunes with Sugar, or
Figs and Raisins, before meat, and also the yolks of Eggs, flesh and broth of
Chicken, Birds, Patridges and Pheasants, and Fish living in stony places, with
good broth.

And such meats shall not only be convenient for this month, but also for the
two succeeding months, that the natural parts by them may be dilated.

Also astringent meats, and roasted meats, and also Rise, hard Eggs, Millet,
and others of that kind will be very profitable. Baths of sweet water, with
emollient herbs, used with intermission is meet: But the hot house, which they
call a stow, is hurtful. After the bath, let the belly be anointed with oil
of Roses and Violets; but the natural parts with the fat of Hens, Geese, Ducks,
with oil of Lillies, and the decoction of Linseed and Faenugreek, boiled with
oil of Linseed, Marshmallows, grains of Quinces, or with this which follows.

A Liniment.
Take of Mallows, Of marsh-Mallowes, both of them cut and sliced of each one
ounce.

Of Linseed also one ounce. Let them be boiled from twenty ounces of water to
ten; let them take three ounces of the boiled broth, of oil of Flour-deluce,
and of Almonds, of each one ounce, three ounces of Deer suet; Bath this from
the rest, and anoint her with it warm.

Also they may use, for fourteen days before the birth morning and evening, to
bath and moisten the belly with Muscadine and Lavender-water, that the child
may be the more strengthened thereby.

She may every day eat toasted bread, that nothing may grow to the child.

The natural parts may also be gently stroaked down with this Fomentation.

The Fomentation.
Take three ounces of Linseed.

Of Mallows, and of marsh-Mallowes sliced, of each M. i.

Let them be put in a bag and boiled moderately: Let the woman with child,
every morning and evening, take the vapor of this decoction in a hollow
stool, taking great heed, that no wind or air come to her in any part; and
then let her wipe the parts so anointed with a linen cloth, that she may
anoint the belly and groins, as at the first.

Being near her time to bring forth, so that she be within ten days thereof,
if the woman with child shall begin to feel difficulty and pain, let her daily
use this Bath.

The Bath.
Take of Mallows, Marsh-Mallowes, ana M. i. Cammomil, Mercury herb,
Maidenhair, ana M. ss. Of Linseed four ounces.
Let these be boiled in a sufficient quantity of water, as may suffice to make
a Bath therewith.

But let not the woman sit too hot on the seat, nor higher than a little above
her Navill, nor let her sit longer on it than about half an hour, least her
strength languish and decay; for it is better to use it often, than to stay too
long at once in it.

But if she cannot endure to sit over the water, let her cherish her natural
parts, with a sponge or with clothes wet in it.

A Laconick and sweating Bath is not convenient at that time but hurtful,
though we think women may use it.

After the Bath she shall always anoint her natural parts of her loins, her
flanks, navil, sides, and other parts adjoining thereto, with the ointment or
fat made of the fore-prescribed thing, or cherish them with the fat marrow.

And also sats melted sometimes, and rightly put up into the natural parts,
with a sponge or glister-pipe, if the womb be hot and dry, and the party with
child be of a lean and slender body.

Fumes also used, applied to the womb, conduce to facilitate delivery.

S^ffumigations of the genitals, to facilitate delivery.
Musk, Ambergreace, Gallia Moscata, Aloes-wood, put upon hot coals, and also
sweet Herbs, Mint, Penniroyal, Calamint, Origanum, Majoram, are of a pleasant
and grateful smell, and open women's passages, and draw down conception.

But we must beware, that such sweet smells of this kind be not used to the
nostrils, but rather Balls of Galbanum, Assa soetida, Mirrh, or Rue.

What Meat is most useful.
Then Pottage of Hens, Capons, and such like are most in use; and I should
advise them then to drink thin generous Wine allayed with water.

What manner of Chamber, the woman with child should lie in.
It does not a little avail to the happy delivery, that the Chamber, wherein
the Childbearing woman lies, be temperate, and be neither too cold nor too
hot, for that shuts up the mouth of the womb, and this disperseth and
digesteth the strength. In Summer time therefore if heat scorcheth, the Chamber
may be strowed with Willow leaves, and Vine leaves, and Rose Water, with a
little Vinegar. In Winter, a high or upper Chamber, moderately kept warm, shall
be convenient, which shall be kept warm with a continued fire, as is accustomed
to be done in Italy, France, and other hot Countries.

But this is expedient every where, that the natural parts, and those nearest
unto them, be moderately rubbed with hot clothes.

CHAP. VII. What is to be done at the birth.
THe birth being at hand, and pains oppressing them, it shall be fit, if the
belly do fall down of its own accord, but if it be bound, it must be provoked
with a gentle Glyster; for the excrements being cast out, the womb and the
passages, thorough which the Child issues, are less pressed, and so the birth
follows more easy

These things being well prepared, the childbed woman must be put into bed, if
tender, weak, gross, and fleshly; but it ought to be made ready after this
manner.

How, and wherewith, the childbed woman's bed ought to be furnished.
A large boulster made of linen cloth, must be stuffed with straw, and be
spread on the ground, that her upper part may lie higher than her lower; on
this the woman may lie, so that she may seem to lean and bow, rather than to
lie drawing up her feet unto her, that she may receive no hurt.

CHAP. VIII. To whom the seat may agree and be fit.
LEt the strong and lusty women be placed in a chair, which also must have the
lower part not upright, but stooping a little, that the childbearing woman may
sit, as it were, bending backward, clothes, or close compassing garments, being
cast about their backs.

In this the belly, together with the whole burden, may sooner go down than
in a bed; but it often comes to pass, that the whole Babe lies at the mouth
of the womb, before that it shall get forth, more loosly and openly with the
adjoining places, and by that means is compelled to stick longer there, from
whence arises no small danger of life,

CHAP. IX. What the Midwife shall do in the very moment of the birth.
When now the pangs of childbearing women increase more and more, let the
Midwife inwardly anoint the secret or natural parts with oil of Cammomil, and
white Lillies, nor let her set the woman in the seat, before she perceives the
womb to be loosed and resolved, and the humors to flow over more plentifully.

Moreover, she may not bring her to labor and struggling, before the birth show
it self to her view; for they do but labor in vain, and do violently distort
and wrest away the strength of the laboring woman, that afterward, when she
shall have need, it will not be able to work it forth.

But she shall sit fitly over against the woman in labor, and shall diligently
observe on what part the birth moves it self; for if it come the right way,
she shall anoint and cherish the secret parts with odoriferous Oils; and if it
declineth to the sides, she shall with both hands govern and dispose the belly,
that it may fall to the mouth of the womb.

And if the hand or feet show it self first, the Midwife, with a soft and
gentle hand, moistened with broth of Fenugreek and Linseed, shall gently reduce
it into the place.

Certain women have the mouth of their womb so straightened, that without great
help, scarce or never they can part with the child. And that comes to pass by
reason of diverse causes; for either some strong heat coming from the natural
parts, does two much streighten the inward parts, or the Creature is to big, or
the childbearing woman is to gross and fat, or the child is dead, who cannot
by motion be furthering and helping to nature, or else cold for the most part
in the winter, especially in young ones, who have a narrow passage of the womb,
does more astringe and bind it up; or sometimes heat in some is so dissolved,
that their strength fails them in the birth.

Therefore when there appears difficulty in bringing forth the Child, Jesus
Christ, the only preserver and saver in danger, is heartily to be called upon,
that with his gracious favor he would be pleased to be Assistant to the
wretched party in travel.

CHAP. X. When the Infant is come into the world.
When now the Child, or Issue, comes into the world either with the head or
feet, the Mother must be encouraged, that as much as in her lies, she keep in
her breath and restrain it, that by that endeavor she may put forth the Child.
And the Midwife, in the mean time, must with he^ hand gently compresse and keep
down the region of the womb, which is above the navill, and urge the Infant to
the lower parts: And although the astriction of the womb causes the bringing
forth to be more difficult, the parturient woman is to be set in a Bath, in
which Mallows, Faenugreek, Linseed, and Barley are sodden, and the sides, hips,
and flank, must be anointed, with oil of Roses and Violets: let the thighs be
well rubbed, with Oxysacchar. and half a dram of Mint, and as much of
Wormwood, be exhibited in drink to her: The woman bringing forth may gently be
led to her bed; and they which assist her at her labor, must not look or gaze
in her face, as such who are ashamed in their bringing forth, that after it, as
it falls out, she strive not to bring forth her young one with sharper pain.

CHAP. XI If the Secondines break not readily.
BUt if the Skin containing the young one, called the Secondine, because it is
brought forth after the birth, be less easily broken, but stiffly resists,
the Midwife must either break it with her nails, and laying hold on it with her
fingers, cut it with a pair of Sizzers, taking care that the Child may be
preserved safely in doing it: On the contrary, when the skins are broken or cut
in pieces, if all the humors presently shall overflow before the child come
forth, and the natural places shall be dried up, let Goose grease, with oil
of white Lillies melted, be poured in warm, or the white of an Egg with the
yolk be put up.

What is to be done after the child is born, if yet the Secondine, or
afterbirth, be retained.
If the Child being born, the Secondines be as yet pertinaciously retained,
sneezing must be provoked, if it come not voluntarily, putting Ginger or some
other sharp thing up into the nostrils; or a scruple of Unicorns horn beaten
into powder ought to be drunk hot in white Wine (in want of Unicorns horn use
good Hearts horn, or Bezar four grains) or the juice of Borrage exhibited in
drink brings them down, because it easily moves vomit, and they thereby are
brought forth.

Another approved Remedy for drawing them forth.
Take of Sesely, Cinnamon, Of Mirrh, and of sweet Cassia, of each equal parts.
Let these be exhibited with Mugwort-water.
Another Receipt.
Take powder of the Jet stone exhibited in Mugwort-water, or else about a
dram of the powder of Mallows seeds exhibited in hot water, or the
suffumigations of Horse hoofes.

CHAP. XII. To draw forth a dead Child.
IF the child be dead, an equal quantity of Rue, of Mugwort, Wormwood, and
black Pepper, being each of them reduced into fine powder, and boiled in Wine,
must be exhibited, or Vervain boiled in Wine, or Water, or Vinegar; or Savory
bruised and tied upon the belly brings forth the Child, whether it be yet
alive or dead; or Butter with Honey boiled in Wine; or decoction of Hysop well
dried exhibited in hot water: but if it yeildeth not, nor comes away with
these, let Rue, Mugwort, Oppoponax, and Wormwood dried, with a little Oil and
Sugar, be laid to the groin, or the navill; and moreover, the skin of a female
Snake put about the woman in the manner of a girdle. Also the stone Aetites,
tied unto the thigh, after the Child is brought forth, ought presently to be
taken away, least the womb, after the Child be brought forth, come forth also.

Moreover, sneezing alone accellerateth delivery, but it ought to be used with
the mouth and nostrils close stopped, and Ginger, or some such thing, put up
into them; for from hence a great force of the spirits is thrust thence unto
the inward part.

CHAP. XIII. How the bellies of childbearing women, being costive or bound may
be loosned.
IF the belly do not evacuate the excrements, the first days of her being
brought to bed, bring a Fig, cut in the middle, into the form of a sharp tent
fashioned like a man's Yeard, and put it up into the Fundament instead of a
Suppository; or else put a grain of Coriander, confected with Sugar, up into
that place; or put a piece of Swines flesh powdered, or Lard, brought into the
same form, up into the same place, or frame a Suppository of white Soap, and
apply it thereto.

About four or five days after the birth, you may use a gentle Glister of half
a pound of Sallade oil, with a quartern of Barley boiled in broth, with two
ounces of Sugar, with the yolke of an Egg, beaten together.

But if at the eighth day the belly answer not their expectation in looseness,
let three drachms of Cassia newly extracted, well confected with Sugar, be
taken morning and at evening before supper in the manner of a bole, and
presently let her eat thereupon.

CHAP. XIV What things are to be applied to the natural or secret parts.
SO soon as the Child is born, let this astringent Fomentation be applied unto
the natural parts.

The Fomentation.
Take of red Roses two pugils; a pugill is the quantity you may take up at once
between your first three forefingers.

Let them be boiled to a third part, in high red Wine inclining to a blackish
color, with a fourth part of water put thereunto, then put into the decoction
a whole Egg, and let it be mingled together, and applied to the place, with
flanen rowlers, and kept on for the space of two days.

Another.
Take of oil of Hypericon four ounces.

Of Rose Water two ounces.

Of the juice of Solomon's Seal one ounce.

Mingle these well together, and let the rowlers dipped in them be applied to
the secret parts.

An Ointment.
Let the belly be forthwith anointed with this Ointment, least it become
wrinkled or deformed, and that it may be thereby better strengthened, and may
return to the old form.

Take two ounces of Rose Water.

An ounce of Mirtles.

Half an ounce of Cats fat.

These things ought to be melted, and mingled with the before recited Oils.

A Girdle for the belly.
After the Unction, put on a Girdle of Dog-skin, well prepared by a
Leather-dresser, and anointed with two ounces of oil of Mirtles, and one
ounce of oil of Mastick, and half an ounce of oil of Hypericon mingled
together.

But it must be so large, as it may comprehend or compass the whole belly a
little above the navill, even unto the natural parts, and must straightly bind
up the same, but without pain. And this will be fitly done, if it be sowed
together with thread on the left side, and be put hot enough to the belly, and
be compassed with four or five double linen clothes, binding them with fit
strings together, that the belly may be kept warm.

But let linen clothes, anointed with an equal proportion of oil of
Mirtles, and oil of Hypericon, be applied unto the natural parts, from the
second day until the seventh.

CHAP. XV. The order from the seventh day after the woman is brought to bed.
SIx days being finished or past, on the seventh day let the natural parts be
fomented and cherished with this Decoction.

Take of red Roses, Of Agrimony, Mellilot, And Cammomil, of each one handful.
Of the leaves of Hypericon, Of the leaves of Quinces, And of Myrtle, of each
two pugils.
Let them be boiled in red Wine thick and astringent, with a little water to a
third part, and let the natural parts be fomented therewith morning and at
evening before sleep.

On the eighth day.
It is convenient to put to the belly, a plaster made with the white of an
Egg, and a little Pepper, and taken with flaxen rowlers, or boulsters.

On the ninth day.
If this plaster please not, besmear a Dogs skin again with oil of Mirtles
and Mastick, and apply it unto the belly, and it will avail and profit much, to
keep it tied with swaddling clothes unto the end of her childbed.

A Liniment to scatter and disperse the Milk.
That the Milk flowing back to the breasts, may without offense be dissipated,
you must use this ointment.

Take of pure Wax two ounces. Of Linseed oil half a pound.
When the Wax is melted, let a Liniment be made wherein linen clothes must be
dipped, and according unto their largeness, be laid upon the breasts; but when
it shall be discussed, and paineth no more, let other linen clothes, dipped in
distilled water of Acorns, be put upon them. But this I only advise them which
cannot nurse their own children: And if swelling in them which give suck do
arise from abundance of milk in their breasts, seem to threaten an
inflammation, use the former Ointment, but abstain from using the distilled
water of Acorns.

When, and what Bath they must use.
From the twentieth day, if it be a male Child, if it be a female, from the
five and twentieth day, this Bath may be used.

Take of Majoram, Of Penniroyall, Mellilot, Hypericon, or Saint John's wort, Of
Millefoile, And of Pimpernel, of each M iii. Of Bay leaves two pugils. Three
ounces of Pomegranades rindes. Of old Bean meal five pounds. Of Barley meal two
pounds. Of Cummin bruised and beaten into powder, lb. iii.
Put the herbs, small chopped, into a bag, but the beans, and Barley, and Cummin,
one upon another severally: Let them be sod altogether in a great Cauldron,
which may contain two parts of Water, and one of Wine, let them be boiled the
day before she would use the Bath, and be poured forth into a tub, which must
be well covered: The next day heat the water of the Bath; but they must take
heed they sit not on the Bath too hot; but two hours will be sufficient to sit
before meat in the morning, and at evening.

But let the childbed woman sit on the bag, wherein the bran or meal is put,
but not lower than the region of the mouth of the Ventricle.

Another.
Let a barrel, wherein the dregs of white Wine are yet sticking, be filled
with river water, and let it be stirred to and fro, that all may be well
mingled together, then let the dregs settle, and boil in this water,

Of Bay leaves, Of red Roses, With both the Comferies, Of Hypericon,
Penniroyall, And Pimpernel, of each p. ii. Of old Bean meal lb. v. Of Barley
meal lb. ii.
Let the childbed woman sit on the bag, in which the meals are, or on
another, which may contain the brans of wheat.

CHAP. XVI. Against the gripings of the belly in childbearing women.
THe gripings and gnawings of the belly, especially those which are contracted
from the great striving and labor of the belly in bringing forth, and
sometimes from a chollerick matter contained therein, and sometimes of wind
retained.

Outward Remedies.
Exceedingly therefore are useful Musk, and Civet outwardly laid to the
navill; moreover, oil of Dill, chafed on the belly as hot as well may be
endured.

Inward helps in their meats.
In stead of meat, the broth of an old Cock or Capon is best, being well sodden
with a little Dill, and so taken.

A Drink.
For the drink, a water made up with Cinnamon and Sugar, which they call
Hippocras, which is made after this manner.

Put unto water boiled, and hot, and drawn, unto. xx.

Of Cinnamon half an ounce, Of Sugar three or two ounces. Three grains of black
Pepper.
Mingle them well, and infuse them for six hours, and then strain them in a
bag, which the Apothecaries call Hippocrates sleeve. Let the childbearing
woman use this potion warm, but very sparingly; but if she loath this, let her
use thin, small, and clear wine, unless a Fever shall hinder her.

A Potion also is made of Honey and white Wine, of each two ounces, to
mittigate pain by reason of flatuous humors retained.

Some exhibit the jaws of the Pickerell, with Amber, and Ginger, ana. finely
powdered to drink in white Wine.

CHAP. XVII. The government of the Nurse.
LEt there be given unto the Infant new born Honey to lick, after let it be
nourished with the Mothers Milk, which of all things best agrees with it. But
if by reason of some necessity it cannot enjoy it, a sound healthy Nurse is to
be chosen, neither younger than four and twenty years, nor elder than five and
thirty, of a white and ruddy complexion, which is not infected with other
vices, nor yet has too lately been brought to bed, nor has not long given
suck; let her not have sore Dugs or Breasts, nor to big, but a large Breast,
and moderately fat. Let her use choice meats of easy and light concoction,
engendring good blood or juice; let her abstain from hot aromaticall Spices, as
Pepper, Ginger, Cardamome, and such like; also from Leeks, Onions, Garlic,
Salt, austere and tart things: Let her avoid strong Wines, as also cold water:
Let her eschew immoderate eating and drinking, for that corrupts the Milk,
and begets in children lepry, or scurfe, and other contagious diseases: Let
her abstain from cares and vexations, and let her take heed, least she provoke
her menstruous disease.

She must not sleep much, or be given to sleep, for that makes the Milk
phlegmatic; she likewise ought not to watch more than is meet, for from hence
the Milk comes to be more hot, sharp, and distasteful to the Infant; she ought
moderately to excrcise her self, especially her arms, to wit, either in
sowing, spinning, or knitting, for by this means evil humors are consumed,
as by ease and sloth they are augmented.

Also copulation of the Nurse exceedingly offends, and hurts the Child, as
that which chiefly retracteth and diminishes the Milk, and makes it of an
unsavory taste, tasting hot, and rank, or goatish, which brings no small
inconvenience, and hurt to the Child. For which cause, in times past, Husbands
were driven away from their Wives, and restrained from their companies.

But if the Milk decrease, Pultesses of Bean meal, and Rise, are meet to be
used; also like paps made of Bread, with Milk, and Sugar, to which may be added
a little Fennelseed.

And if the Milk be thick, it must be made thin, with slender diet, and
subtle Wine, and Sirrup of Vinegar, as also with exercises: But if it be too
thin, and waterish, gross, and strong meats, and longer sleeps will be
convenient and meet. For the corruption of the Milk, a litile Mug vort grossly
bruised, and put into a linen cloth, and so into broth, with a little Honey
added thereto, will do very much good.

The care of the Infant.
And if the Childs belly be loose, the food ought to be more gross and
strong, and her sleeps longer: But children may suck so long, as till they have
brought forth sharp and great teeth: But if you suffer them to drink Wine, or
strong drink, or other Potions, before they have toothed them, they will be
corrupted; but when they have gotten these teeth, their arms, and back bones
are gently to be rubbed after their sleep.

CHAP. XVIII. A Bath of sweet water, very profitable for children, as by whose
means they may grow up and increase.
THey are, fasting, to be bathed in water before meat, for the space of a
quarter of an hour, yet so, that the belly may first go down or be emptied,
and then they are to be anointed with oil of Olives made hot.

And it is not of little concernment, in what swaddling clothes children are
wrapped; for when they are not tied up at all, or the clouts are too loose,
they are subject to Fluxes, Imposthumes, apt to be crooked backed, and other
discommodities; but especially when their knees are too strictly tied and bound
up, and their thighs left at liberty, they are lamed.

When they cry, or feel pain, or will sleep, they are to be pacified, either by
showing the breast, or by singing, or by rocking, either in Cradles, or hanging
Beds, or by carrying up and down. But we must observe, that children may lie
strait whenever they lie down, and ought not to be covered too much, or hot
with coverings, nor yet with too few, least they may catch cold. Moreover, let
the linen cloth, wherein they are wrapped, be neat and clean, for children are
offended, and infected by foul and filthy excrements.

From three years of age till the seventh, they are to be educated gently and
kindly, not to be severely reprehended, chidden, or beaten, for by that means
they be made throughout their whole life after too timorous, or too much
terrified, astonished, and sotted.

Being yet in their first years, they are not to be compelled to going, for
seeing all their bones are soft as Wax, and the body fall the heavier, they
either become lame, or universally resolved in their feet.

Food must be daily given them thrice a day, till they are three years old; for
if they be much filled, they are subject and accustomed to be troubled with
Convulsions, and other diseases.

In the sixth or seventh year of their age, they are to be sent to school, and
committed to the breeding and instruction of courteous and temperate
Schoolmasters, who may not terrify them.

Before these years they are not to be compelled or forced to harder labors;
otherwise they will not thrive well, but stand at a stay, and keep little, or
become Dwarfes.

CHAP. XIX. The Diseases of Infants.
When as the Infant begins to grow sick, as for example, from a cold
disease, the Nurse is to be nourished with hot and dry meat and drink, so that
thereby forthwith it may grow well again; so also if it be taken with other
diseases, as with an Ague, the Nurse shall use plantain water, and such like
things, Paps made for children of crumbs or morsels of bread broken or sliced,
are more wholesome, than made of meal or flour.

Till two years old give them Honey often, for that keeps them from
Convulsions, and costivenesse of the belly, and that the milk they eat hurt
them not.

When Infants cast up their milk, a Corrall should be hung about their neck
down to their middle; for it is useful for them in teething, and Ivory also is
good for the same purpose.

Diseases and Symptoms, proceeding from the birth, in women with child.
Gripings and pangs come often upon women from their birth, for the womb, as a
wild beast, by reason of her sudden evacuation and emptiness, by wandering up
and down hither and thither, disposes it self.

Therefore the belly must be covered all over with Barley meal, and the white of
an Egg, mixed together, wirh juice of Elder; also drinking of hot Wine wherein
Cummin has been boiled, is very convenient and useful

Also Suffumigations of Styrax calamita, Frankincense, and Smallage seed, of
each one dram, will very much avail.

CHAP. XX. Against the Rupture of the Cods and perinaeum, and the part between
the rising of the Yeard and the Fundament, which proceeds from difficulty of
bringing forth.
TO help the Rupture of the natural parts, which arises from hardness in
bringing forth, the powder of the great Comfery root dried, with Cummin and
Cinnamon, are very good, put up into the womb.

In some the wrinkled skin of the Cods is broken from the birth, so that there
is but one hole between the womb and the fundament, and the same course,
whereby oftentimes the womb goes forth and is hardened; therefore the diseased
parts must be cherished with hot Wine, in which Butter has been resolved,
until the Matrix be softened, and then it must be gently put up: after the Cod
skin is broken in three or four places, it must be sowed up with a silken
thread; presently let a linen cloth be put upon the belly, according to the
largeness of it; lastly, let it be anointed with Tar, for the womb, by reason
of the evil scent, is drawn in again. At last we heal the Rupture with powder
of both Comferies, and Cummin, sprinkled upon them. But a childbed woman is to
be put to bed, so that she may have her feet lie the higher; let her lie there
eight or nine days continually, and let her take her meat, ease her self, and
make water there.

She must abstain from bathing so long as possibly she may, also from all those
things which may provoke coughing, and from meats which cannot easily be
digested: And for preventing this danger in bringing forth, let a long ball of
linen cloth be made, and put up into her Fundament, and as often as the
childbearing woman striveth to bring forth the Infant, let her strongly
compresse and keep in her belly, that no disruption or rupture be made in these
parts.

CHAP. XXI. For windiness or Colic of the belly.
IF the secret or natural parts receive wind in, which being kept in brings
forth pain, a Fomentation made with the decoction of Mustard or Onions, is vety
good.

Also sometimes in others so great plenty and abundance of wind oppresses
them, that they seem broken, or as those troubled with the Isiack passion, for
whose ease, a Bath made of Mallows, Pellitory of the wall, and the like, must
be used, and the belly often kept soluble.

But she ought to stay the longer in the Bath, and when she comes out of it, a
plaster of the juice of Mullein, or Turnup, and Barley meal, must be laid on
hot, and then let her use her Bath again,

CHAP. XXII. For the Itch.
IF those parts itch, so that women by scratching take away the skin, whereupon
blysters arise, which greatly molest and trouble them, they ought to be
anointed with the Ointment prescribed for burnings.

Take an Apple, Bol^ armoniack, Mastick, Frankincense, Oil, hot Wine, Wax, and
Tallow, and thus you may prepare it. Purge the Apple from the outward rind, and
the core, and put it in a pot to the fire, with the Oil, Wax, and Tallow, and
when it shall be hot, the Mastick and Frankincense, being reduced into powder,
must be put in, and then being mingled strained through a cloth.

CHAP. XXIII. For the Flux of blood.
FOr those unto whom an immoderate Flux of blood happens, it shall be
convenient to give the juice of Mugwort, Sage, Pennyroyall, and of other herbs
of that kind, made up into the form of a Sirrup.

Also Baths made for the same disease of the said herbs, are good; or by a
plaster made up with Clay and Vinegar, which must be applied to the right side.

If the Flux of blood come from the nostrils, it must be applied to the
forehead and temples, having a respect to the contrary side: For blood uses
not to flow out of the nostrils, unless a male Child be begotten.

CHAP. XXIV. For the falling down of the Matrix from the birth.
A Bath made of Mugwort, Flea-bane, Juniper, Camphire, and Wormwood, boiled in
water; let the childbed woman sit in this up to the breast, afterward let her
be gently put into her bed, and let her lie with her feet drawn backward, that
the Matrix may return into its place.

The Womb being put into its place again, put powder of Penniroyall, of
Galingale, Spikenard, Nutmegs, Avence, with oil of Nutmegs, and Penniroyall
into a fine thin cloth, and in manner of a Ball or Pessary bind it up, and
put it into the Womb, and shut up the orifice of the Matrix, that it fall not
down again: But have a care, that it may pierce backward toward the reins, and
there it is to be bound up, but before that be performed, a plaster of Bay
berries, of Mustard, Frankincense, and of Cinnamon, of each as much as shall be
sufficient, being brought into powder, and being heated at the fire, mingled
with Honey, and let it be laid to the back being yet hot, and bound up with a
swath, wherewith the Pessary, put up into the Matrix, is tied.

But let the woman brought to bed lie in her bed upward for the space of nine
days or more, if need require, so that she may not move her self up and down,
unless great necessity urges her; and such meat shall be given her, which may
not easily pass through her belly, or may not often provoke her to make water:
But now going abroad after her delivery, we must put on an entire garment that
may keep it in, least it go out again, unless it be when she makes water.
The third day we must make ready a Bath, and then, least they should swell,
powder of Ginger, Pellitory of the wall, and Cinnamon, of every one by equal
parts mixed must be blown up.

CHAP. XXV. For the Piles after the birth.
We use to cure the Piles, arising from the fault of the bringing forth, with
a Bath of Wormwood, Southernwood; Cinnamon rind, and the bark of Cassia
fistula, boiled well in Wine; when the woman delivered goes forth of the Bath,
put Bombace, or Cotton, with powder of Alloes mixed with oil of Penniroyall
unto her lower parts.

CHAP. XXVI. Against pain of the Breasts, contracted by too much Milk.
CLay kneaded with Vinegar, after the manner of a plaster, is available to
astringe and keep back the Milk, but the place is first to be suppled with hot
water.

CHAP. XXVII. For the Imposthume of the Breasts.
A Plaster of marsh-Mallowes, Mallows, Wormwood, Mugwort, and Swines grease,
made up according to art is very profitable; when the swelling is come unto the
height, lay Nut kernels bruised to pieces unto it: And if the Imposthume break
not, let it be launced with a Launcet or Penknife, and squeeze it a little,
least by the sudden evacuation a worse mischeevious Imposthume may come upon
it; and when it is broken, put in a linen cloth, twice or thrice a day,
smeared with the yolk of an Egg and Turpentine, which strengthens
exceedingly: And if the Imposthume chance to pass into a Fistula, put into it
a root of black Hellebor dipped in Oil or Honey; or sprinkle powder of the
colt-Bur upon it, for with these is every Fistula purged and destroyed, so as
it be not between the bones; wherefore these Medicines are so long to be
administered, until it dye, and be dried up, and afterward the Ulcer be cured.

Some few additionall Observations, concerning the passages in ths former
Treatise.
CHAP. XXVIII. What is to be administered unto the Child, after it is born, for
the first thing it takes.
ARnoldus de villa nova, a most learned Physician, writes, that if you give
unto a Child half a scruple of Corrall finely powdered, with woman's milk,
first, before it takes any other thing, after it is born, that it shall never
be troubled with the falling Sickness.

Also,
I know persons of good quality in this our Country of England (I presume,
instructed by some able Physicians) who give unto all their own children (and
advise all other women, where they are desired to be assistant at the birth) to
exhibit unto the children new born, the first thing they take, a little Salt
well mingled in a spoonful of Saxifrage, or Hysop water, to prevent the
trouble of frets, and other diseases in children following their birth.

Conceiving also, as they suppose, they have some ground for their action, from
the fourth verse of the sixteenth Chapter of Ezekiel, where the Lord, reckoning
up the Midwives duties about children, at that time of their nativity, thus
speaks.

And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born, thy navill was not cut,
neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee, thou wast not salted at all,
nor swadled at all.

CHAP. XXIX. For Infants troubled with wind and phlegm.
MAny Midwives advise the Nurses, to give them a little pure Sugar-candie
finely bruised in Saxifrage water, or Scabious water in a spoon, well mingled
together.

CHAP. XXX. A most excellent Medicine to cause children to teeth easily.
TAke of pure Capons grease, very well clarified, the quantity of a Nutmeg, and
twice as much of pure Honey, mingle and incorporate them well together, and
three or four times in a day anoint the Child's gummes when they are teething,
and they will break flesh easily, and prevent torments, and Agues, and other
greifs, which usually accompany their coming forth.

CHAP. XXXI. For Agues in Children.
TAke a spoonful of good oil of Populeon, and put thereunto two spoonfuls of
good oil of Roses, mingle and incorporate them well together, and then warm it
before the fire, anoint the Child's bowing places, his arms, legs soles of his
feet, and also his forehead, and temples twice a day, chafing the ointment well
in.

CHAP. XXXII. For Worms in Children.
TAke of Mirrh, and Aloes, very finely powdered, of each a pennyworth, and
with a few drops of Chymicall oil of Wormwood, or Savine, with a little
Turpentine, make these up into a pluster, and ^ay it to the Childs Navill.

CHAP. XXXIII. For Heart-Wormes.
HEberstreit, Skonkius, Hollerius, and other Physicians affirm, they have seen
them in persons dissected: One in a Prince, another in a Citizen of Florence;
and our London Physicians of late years have seen two in London (as appears
in Doctor Mayes book of Mr Pennant of Saint Giles in the Feilds) who dyed
having a Worm like a Serpent in his heart.

The Cure.
Skonkius out of Stocherus affirms by certain experiment, that the juice of
Raddish, Garlic, and Mustard, kills these Worms, which breeding in the
chest of the heart, cause swoundings, Epilepsies, and many times death.

CHAP. XXXIV. To cause a young Child to go to stool.
CHafe the Child's navill with May Butter before the fire, then take some black
Wool, that grows between a Sheeps legs, and dip it in the May Butter, and
then dry it, and lay it unto the navill, and it will procure a stool: This is
also good for one in years, who can take no inward Medicine.

Another certain Experiment.
Take a good big green Mallow strig, and strip off the outward skin, and
anoint the strig well with fresh Butter, and put it up into the Childs
Fundament, and let it stay a while there, and in very short space it will
procure a stool.

Courteous Reader,
I pray accept kindly of these few Additions.

THis Treatise might have been enlarged farther out, by addition of other
Experiments, but my Friend; being of the same opinion concerning Medicines,
that Seneca the Philosopher was of Books: Non refert quanta, sed quam bona
medicamina; has confined them to their own limits, only with a few necessary
Observations inserted.

M. A.

FINIS.

old written book.

To know good Azure and pure.
Lay some of it upon a hot burning Iron, and if then it will not be burned, nor
any little stone is found therein, then it is pure and perfect, and not
sophisticate and adulterate: Mizaldus.

For an Ague.
When Jesus saw the Cross whereon he should be crucified, the Jews said unto
Jesus, Art thou afraid, or have thou an Ague? Jesus said, I am neither afraid,
nor have an Ague: Whosoever shall wear these words, shall neither be afraid,
nor have an Ague, Amen, sweet Jesus, Amen.

weight of two pence, as much of gross Pepper, of Licorice eight penny weight
cut very small, of Anniseeds eighteen penny weight, put these altogether after
the Hysop is taken out, and let it boil a walm or two on the fire, stirring it
a little; then take it off, and put it into a glass or pot, and put thereto

but once a day, and this will cool it without any scarre.

2.. The reddest Onyon you can get, and take off the rind, and beat the Onyon
with Bay Salt in a wooden dish, till it be made very small: then put it very
thick upon the burned place, and renew it three or four times, and this will
take out the fire, and then you may apply any healing Medicine to it to skin it.

C
For a Cough of the Lungs.
REcipe. Of clear running water three pound, of good Sugar half a pound, with
nine Figs sliced, half a spoonful of Anniseeds bruised, a spoonful of
Licorice bruised, of great Raisins, having their stones taken out, one
handful, of Maidenhair one penniworth, boil these together till one half be

bruised two ounces, French Barley which, has been cleansed in one water, boil
these till half the water be consumed, then strain it, and put to it three

Wine, of Mace two flakes, of Nut-Neg two or three slices, Saffron six or eight
blades, burn the Wine, and after sweeten it with brown Sugar Candy, and drink a
good draught warm, mane and vesperi, and two or three spoonfuls in the
afternoon.

For Canker in the mouth.
Mingle the juice of Agrimony with raw Honey, and anoint the lips with it, and
it will heal it: Probatum.

Richard Jones cured a young man which had the Canker both in his tongue and
lips, only with good Roman Vitrioll dissolved in spring water, and making it
as milk warm from the Cow, with a stick and a linen cloth fastened to the end
of it, he washed his tongue, mouth, and lips herewith every morning and
evening, and cured him in short time.

But if it be in an old man let run too long, that it eat still, and Vitrioll,
Salves, nor other waters will cure it, there is no other way to save this man,
but to wash carefully his lips, or mouth, with a very little oil of Vitrioll,
to cauterize the veins, and stop the malignant humors that comes from the
brain and feeds it. But this course must not be taken unless the Patient be in
intolerable pain, and in a desperate case, for do it herewith never so little,
yet this oil of Vitrioll will gnaw, and bite, and put the Patient to great
pain, that was oppressed with great pain before, unless you mitigate the pain by
often and continual dipping of a linen cloth kept wet in spring water; after a
very little time that you have anointed the cankered veins and places, with
very little oil of Vitrioll upon a feather as may be, and so let him endure
the pain as long as he well can, that this may cauterize and sear up the veins
the better, that so he may be cured, which otherwise will corrode and eat
continually, although he may purge and vomit also, and so this at last will
kill him.

For a Consumption, and Cough of the Lungs.
. Coltsfoot, Betony, Burnet, and red Rose leaves, ana. M. i. of Comfry roots
scraped and sliced; M. ii boil all these in a gallon of Spring water till it
be consumed to a pottle, then strain it, and set it over the fire again, then
take a pound of double refined Sugar, and put it into it, and let it boil over
a soft fire about a quarter of an hour, then take it off, and put it up, and
drink of it six spoonfuls, morning, and evening, and at four in the afternoon.

2.. Of Saccharum Saturni one scruple in a quarter of a pint of Goats milk, and
give the Patient mane and vesperi two or three weeks together, and this will
help them, but first give the Patient some gentle diet-drink to purge them,
before you give the Saccharum and Milk: Probatum.

For Colic, and pains in the back.
. The tender tops of a Bucks horn which is Velvet headed, and cut it in pieces,
and put it into a new pot well covered, and set it in an Oven where it may be
dried and made into powder, of which give to the Patient with a little Pepper
in good Wine a pretty draught, and this will presently release the pain and
give ease: Probatum.

2.. The decoction of Hollyhockes, mix it with Honey and Butter, and drink
thereof blood warm: Probatum.

For the Cramp.
. The leaves or little sprigs of Rosemary, and put them between every toe, and

The Printer to the Reader.
THis Treatise has passed the view and approbation, both of juditious
Physicians and Chirurgians, and has been judged worthy to have a new vesture
put upon him, and to be vindicated from the obscurity and darkness it has
lain involved and eclipsed in this many years; being collected out of the
Authorities of the most excellent, both former and later Writers, and
confirmed, strengthened, and approved, by the late experiences of many well
practitioned Chirurgians; being formerly commended to public view, by the
approbation of a late famous Servant, and Chirurgian to King James deceased;
who seriously considering the facilenesse of providing the Medicines, with
their approvednesse in a necessitous time, and in places remote, both from able
Physicians and Chirurgians, the danger of the present Infection requiring
speedy help, to such as might have occasion to make use of these Medicines; not
doubting, but the charitable intentions of the careful Author, publishing it
on purpose for the public good, shall find the acceptance of so necessitous a

A defensative against the Plague. The first Treatise
CHAP. I. What the Plague is.
THe ancient Physicians in times past have greatly doubted, what the essential
cause of this disease, which we commonly call the Plague or Pestilence, should
be; yet all do agree, that it is a pernicious and contagious Fever, and
reckoned to be one of the number of those which are called Epidemia, chiefly
proceeding of adusted and melancholy blood, which may be easily perceived, by
the extreme heat and inflammation, which inwardly they do feel, that are
infected therewith; first assaulting the heart, and astonishing the vital
spirits, as also by the exterior Carbunkles and botches which it produces;
whose malignity is such, both in young and old, rich and poor, noble and
ignoble, that using all the means, which by Art can, or may be devised, yet in
some it will in no sort give place, until it has by death conquered the party
infected therewith.

CHAP. II. Cause of the Plague.
THere are diverse causes whereof this disease may proceed, as sundry Writers
do allege, as by over great and unnatural heat and drought, by great rain
and inundations of waters, or by great store of rotten and stinking bodies,
both of men and beasts, lying upon the face of the earth unburied, as in the
time of wars has been seen, which does so corrupt the air, as that thereby
our Corn, Fruits, Herbs, and Waters, which we daily use for our food and
sustenance, are infected: also it may come by some stinking dunghils, filthy
and standing pooles of water, and unsavory smells, which are near the places
where we dwell, or by thrusting a great company of people into a close, narrow,
or straight room, as most commonly we see in Ships, common Gaoles, and in
narrow and close lanes and streets, where many people do dwell together, and
the places not orderly kept clean and sweet. But most commonly, in this our
time, it is dispersed amongst us, by accompanying our selves with such as
either have, or lately have had the disease themselves, or at least have been
conversant with such as have been infected therewith: But for the most part it
does come by receiving into our custody some clothes, or such like things, that
have been used about some infected body, wherein the infection may lie hidden a
long time, as has been too too often experimented, with repentance too late in
many places, It may also come by Dogs, Cats, Pigs, and Weasels, which are prone
and apt to receive and carry the infection from place to place. But howsoever
it does come, let us assure our selves, that it is a just punishment of God,
laid upon us for our manifold sins and transgressions against his divine
Majesty: for as Seneca says, Quicquid patimur ab alto venit, What crosses or
afflictions soever we suffer, it comes from the Lord, either for a trial of
our faith, or a punishment for our sins. Wherefore to distinguish any farther
thereof I think it needless, for my intent is in brief sort, so exactly as I
can, to show the means how to prevent the same, as also how to cure it when we
are infected. But before I enter to treat thereof, I think it not amiss, to
show what forewarnings and tokens are given us before hand of the coming
thereof, thereby the better to prevent the same by prayer and repentance.

CHAP. III. Warnings of the Plague to come.
A Vicen, a noble Physician says, that when we see the natural course of the
air, and seasons of the year to be altered, as when the spring time is cold,
clowdy, and dry, the harvest time stormy, and tempestuous, the mornings and
evenings to be very cold, and at noon extreme hot, these do foreshew the Plague
to come. Also when we see fiery impressions in the firmament, especially in the
end of summer, as comets and such like, and that in the beginning of harvest we
see great store of little frogs, red toades, and myse on the earth abounding
extraordinarily: or when in summer we see great store of toades creeping on the
earth having long tails, of an ashy color on their backs, and their bellies
spotted and of diverse colors, and when we see great store of gnats swiming on
the waters, or flying in great companies together, or when our trees and herbs
do abound with Caterpillars, Spiders, Moaths etc. which devour the leaves on
the trees and herbs on the earth, it shows the air to be corrupt, and the
Plague shortly after to follow. Also by the beasts of the field we may perceive
it (especially sheep) which will go mourning with their heads hanging down
toward the ground, and diverse of them dying without any manifest cause known
unto us. Also when we see young Children flock themselves together in
companies, and then will feign some one of their company to be dead amongs
them, and so will solemnize the burial in a mournful sort, this is a token
which has been well observed in our age to foreshew great mortality at hand.
Also when we see rivers of water to overflow without any manifest cause, or
suddenly vanish away and become dry: And when clear well-springs do suddenly
become foul and troubled. Also when the Smallpox does generally abound both
in young and old people, all these do foreshew the Plague to come.

CHAP. IIII. Shows how to prevent the Plague.
THere are three principal means how to prevent this contagious disease: The
first and chiefest is to acknowledge our manifold sins and wickedness unto
almighty God our heavenly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our
former sins committed against his divine majesty.

The second means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as Rondoletius
says, not over hastily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap:
which saying is confirmed by Valetius in these words, Non enim morietur in
bello, qui non est in illo: and the farther from it, the safer shall we be, yet
were it a very uncharitable course that all which are of abillity should do so,
for then how should the poor be relieved, and good orders observed: but for
Children it were best to send them far off from the place, because their bodies
are most apt to receive the infection, as also for that they cannot so
continually use antidots and preservatives, which by their great heat may
endanger them almost so much as the disease it self.

The third means consists chiefly in three points, which are these: Order,
Diet, and Physical helps. For the first you shall have a care that your houses
be kept clean and sweet, not suffering any foul and filthy clothes or stinking
things to remain in or about the same: and in summer season to deck your
windows, and strew your floors with sweet and wholesome herbs, flowers, and
leaves, of Mints, Balm, Penniroyall, Lavender, Time, Majoram, red-Roses,
Carnations, Gelliflowers and such like for your windows, your floors to be
strowed with green Rushes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and
such like: your windows which stand toward the North and East, do you always
keep open in the day time, if the air be clear, and that no infected and
unsavory smell be near the same, as Fogs, dunghils, etc. and every morning
before you open either your doors, or windows, as also in the evening when you
go to bed, cause a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn some
odoriferous or sweet perfumes in the midst thereof, as hereafter I will show
you, or in stead thereof some Juniper, Frankincense, Bay leaves, Rosemary,
Lavender, Majoram, or such like, which you must always have dried in a
readiness, and so in the fume or smoke thereof to breath and perfume the
clothes which you are to wear.

A good perfume in summer season.
. Rose water and Vinegar, of either six spoonfulls: Rinds of sower Citrons and
Lemons, Bay Leaves, of either the weight of two pence which is. i. Camphire,
the weight of three pence, which is. ss.

The herbs and rinds must be dried and put altogether in a perfuming pan, or
instead thereof a peuter dish, set on a chafer of coals, will serve the turn.

Another good perfume in winter.
. Red-Roses Majoram and Myrtles, of either a little handful: Callamint,
Juniper berries, Laudanum, Benjamin, Frankincense, of either. i. which is the
weight of seven pence.

The herbs, berries, and Roses being dried, must be made in gross powder, as
also the gumms, and so mixed together, and when ye list, cast some part
thereof on a chafer of coals, and receive the fume thereof.

CHAP. V.
NOw having received the fume as aforesaid, before you go forth of your
chamber, eat some Cordial electuary or preservative, as hereafter you shall
find choice, which I have alwais used with good and happy success, after taking
of the Cordial wash your face and hands with clean water, wherein you must put
a little Vinegar, and then if you list, you may break your fast wirh some good
bread and butter, and in winter season a potch'd Egg is good eaten with some
Vinegar, and for plethorick and melanchole bodies, it were good to drink a
draught of wormwood wine, in the morning fasting, because it resists
putrefaction in the plethorick, and purges bilous matter in the melancholy.

An excellent good preservative which I have always used with good success.
. Conserve of Roses and Borrage flowers, of either two ounces: Minardus
Mithridate, Andromachus triacle, of either half an ounce: Dioscordium, two
drachms, Dialkermes one drachme, Powder of the seed of Citrons pilled, one
drachme, Sirrup of Lemons and sower Citrons, of either half an ounce.

Compound all these together in the form of an opiat, you may eat hereof every
morning the quantity of three beans, and drink a draught of Rennish wine,
Beer, or Ale after it: but for Children and such as are of tender years, so
much as a bean thereof is sufficient, and give them only Beer or Ale after it:
the taking hereof every second or third day will suffice, if you go not into
any suspected company.

Another excellent good preservative.
. Kernils of Wallnuts and Figs, of either four ounces: Leaves of Rue, one ounce
and half, Tormentill roots, four drachms, Rind of sour Citrons, one drachme,
right Bolarmoniak, six drachms, fine Myrrh, two scruples, Saffron, one scruple,
Salt, half a dram: Sirrup of Citrons and Lemons, four ounces.

The herbs, roots, and rinds must be dried, the nuts must be blanched, and the
bolarmoniack must be made in fine powder, and then washed in the water of
Scabios, and dried again, you must pound the figgs and wallnuts in a stone
mortar severally by themselves very small, all the rest must be made in fine
powder, and so mix them altogether in the mortar, and then add thereto sirrup
by little and little, and so incorporate them altogether: you may give this in
the same quantity, and in like sort as the other before.

Another very good.
. Of the confection aforesaid made with Nutts. iiii. Minardus mithridate, four
drachms, Andromachus Triacle, ii. fine terra Sigillata, four scruples, Sirrup
of Limons,. i.

Compound all these together in the mortar, as the other before, you may give
hereof the weight of a groat or six pence, every second or third day, and drink
a draught of Rennish or white wine after it in Winter season, but in the heat
of the year, Sorrel water is best, and in the Spring Scabios or Cardeus
Benedictus water.

Also, so much Triacle of Andromachus description eaten every morning as a
bean, with a little conserve of Roses, is a very excellent good preservative.

Valetius does greatly commend the taking of three or four grains of the Bezar
stone every morning, in a spoonful of Scabios water.

I cannot here sufficiently commend the Electuarie called Dioscordium, which is
not only good to resist the infection, but does also expel the venomous
matter of those which are infected, being taken every morning and evening the
quantity of a bean, and drink a draught of Rennish or White wine after it in
winter season, but in Summer a draught of Beer or Ale is best.

In strong and rusticall bodies, and such as are daily laborers, Garlic only
eaten in the morning with some Butter and Salt at breakfast, drinking a cup of
beer or ale after it, has been found to be very good, which is greatly
commended by Galen, who calls it the poor man's Triacle, but in the sanguine,
dainty, and idle bodies it may not be used, because it over-heateth the blood,
causes headache, and universally inflameth the whole body.

CHAP. VI.
NOw when you have taken any of the foresaid Preservatives, it were good and
necessary to wear upon the Region of the heart, some sweet Bag or quilt that
has power to resist venom, and also to carry in your hand some sweet
Pomander, Nodule, or Nosegay, that will comfort the heart, resist venom, and
recreate the vital spirits, as here following is specified and set down.

An excellent quilt or Bag.
. Arsenike cristaline,. i. Diamargaritum frigidum, ii. Diambrae, i.

You must grind the Arsenike in small powder, and then with some of the
infusion of Gum Dragagant in Rose water, you must make a paste, then spread it
on a cloth which must be six inches long, and five inches broad, and spread it
thick: then cover it with another cloth, and so quilt it together, which being
done, fasten it in another bag of crimson taffetie or Sarsenet, and so wear it
against the heart all the day time, but at night leave it off: and here you
must take heed, that when you sweat, you do take it away, for otherwise it
will cause the skin to amper a little. There are some writers which do utterly
forbid the wearing of Arsenike, but thus much I can say, that I have given this
bag unto diverse to wear, with most happy and good success, for never did I
yet know any one that has worn this bag, and used any of the Electuaries
aforesaid, that has been infected with the plague, but for any inconvenience
or accident that has happened thereby, I never found any hitherto, other then
the ampring of the skin as aforesaid.

Another Bag.
. Ireos, ss. Calamus aromat. Ciperus, ana.. i. ss. Storax Calam. root of
Angelica, ana.. iii. Cloves, Mace, ana. i. Red roses dried,. iii.
Pellemountain, Penniroyall, Calamint, Elder flowers, ana.. i ss. Nutmegs,
Cinnamon, Yellow Sanders, ana. i. Nardi Italicae;. i. Amber greece and Musk,
ana. six grains.

You must pound all these in powder, and then quilt them in a bag of Crimson
Taffatie as aforesaid.

A Pomander good in the Summer time.
. The rind of Citrons, Red Roses, Nenuphare Roses, Yellow sanders, ana. ss.
Storax liquid, Benjamin, ana.. i. Myrrh,. ii. Ladanum,. i. ss. Musk and Amber,
ana. six grains.

Powder all that is to be powdered, and then work them together in a hot mortar
with a hot pestell, adding unto it in the working some of the Musselage of
dragagant dissolved in sweet Rose water, or rose vinegar, and so make your
Pomander.

Another good one for the winter time.
. Storax liquid, Benjamin, Storax calamint, Ladanum, and Myrrh, ana, half a
dram, Cloves one scruple, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, of each half a scruple. Red
Roses, Yellow Sanders, Lignum aloes, and Ireos, of each half a dram. Calamus
aromaticus, rind of a Citron, ana. four grains, Amber greece, Musk and Civet,
of each six grains.

You may make up this as the other before with some Musselage of the infusion
of Gum dragagant, infused in Rose Water.

A good Nodule for the Summer season.
. Flowers of Violets, red Roses, and Nenuphare, of each one dram, Red, White,
and Yellow sanders, of each half a dram. Camphire, xii grains.

Cause all these to be beaten in gross powder, then knit them all together in
a piece of Taffetie, and when you will use it, then wet it in Rose water and a
little Vinegar, and so smell to it.

Another Nodule for the Winter season.
. The dried leaves of Mints, Majoram, Time, Penniroyall, Lavender,
Pellemountain and Balm, of each a little handful. Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon,
Angelica roots, Lignum aloes, of each one dram. Saffron, two scruples.

Cause all these to be infused in Rose Water and Vinegar one whole night, then
wet a sponge in the liquor thereof, and knit it in a piece of Taffaty, or your
handkerchief, whereunto you must smell oftentimes.

A Nosegay for the same purpose.
. Herb grace, three branches: Rosemary, Majoram, Mints, and Thime, of either
one branch: Red-Rose buds and Carnations, of either three or four.

Make your nosegay herewith, then sprinkle him over with Rose Water, and some
rose-Vinegar, and smell often unto it. Also when you suspect to go into any
dangerous or infected company, do you always carry in your mouth a piece of
the root of Angelica, the rind of a Citron dried, or a great Clove, which must
be first infused or steeped one whole night in rose water and Vinegar.

CHAP. VII.
FOr that there is not a greater enemy to the health of our bodies then
costiveness, both in the time of the Plague and otherwise, I have here set down
how and by what means you may keep your self soluble, which you must use once
four and twenty hours, if otherwise you have not the benefit of nature by
custom.

A Suppository.
Take two spoonfulls of Honey, and one spoonful of Bay Salt small pounded,
boil them together until it grow thick, always stirring it in the boiling,
then take it from the fire, and if you list you may add one dram of Ihera
picra simplex unto it, and so stir them well together, and when it is almost
cold, make up your suppositories of what length and bigness you list: and when
you minister any, you must first anoint it with Butter or Sallet oil: you may
keep these a whole year if you put them in Barrowes mort or grease, and so
cover them up close therein.

A good Glister.
. Mallows, Mercury, Beets, Violets, Red-Fennell, of either one handful: Seeds
of Fennel, Annis, Coriander, of either one dram.

Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of Water, until half the water be
consumed, then strain it, and keep it in a glass close stopped until you need,
for it will keep a whole week. Take of the same decoction, a pint.

. Mel Rosarum, or common Honey, one spoonful: Oil of Violets or oil of
Olives, three ounces, Salt, one dram, The yolk of an Egg or two.

Mix all these together in a mortar and so give it warm in the morning, or two
hours before supper: and if you add unto this one ounce of Diacatholicon it
will be the better.

Raisins laxative how to make them.
. White Wind, three pints and a half, Senuae, half a pound, Fine white sugar,
one pound, Currants, two pound. You must infuse the Senuae in the wine in a pot
close stopped, and let it stand in a warm place four and twenty hours, then
strein it and add to the straining the Currants, being clean picked and washed,
and lastly the Sugar, boil all together on an easy fire, until the wine be
consumed, having care that you do always stir it about in the boiling for
fear of burning, then take them from the fire, and put them up into a clean
galley pot, you may eat one spoonful or two of them a little before dinner, at
any time.

A good Ointment to keep one Sollible.
The gaul of an Ox, Oil of Violets, of either one ounce: Sheeps tallow, six
drachms.

Boil them together on a soft fire until they be incorporated, then take it
from the fire and add thereto Alloes cicatrine, one ounce. Bay Salt half an
ounce.

The Alloes and Salt must be both made into fine powder before you put them
into the oil, then stir them together until it be cold, and when you are
disposed to have a stool, then anoint your fundament therewith, both within
side and without, and if you anoint your navell therewith, it will work the
better.

Good pills to keep one soluble, and they do also resist the Pestilence.
. Alloes Cicatrine, one ounce, Chosen Myrrh, three drachms, Saffron, one dram
and half, Amber Greece, six grains: Sirrup of Lemons or Citrons, so much as
shall be sufficient to make the mass.

You must grind the Aloes, Myrrh, and Saffron into small powder severally by
themselves, then incorporate them together with the sirrup: you may give half a
drachme or two scruples thereof in the evening half an hour before supper twice
or thrice in a week: Rases would have you to take half a drachme or two
scruples of these Pills every day, without using any other preservative at all,
and he has great reason so to esteem of them, for Galen, Avicen, and all
ancient Writers in Physic do hold opinion, that Aloes does not only comfort,
but purge the stomach from all raw and chollerick humors, and does also purge
and open the veins called Miserayick, and resists putrefact on: Myrrh does
altogether resist, neither will it suffer putrefaction in the stomach: Saffron
does comfort the heart, and has also a propriety in it to carry any medicine
that is given therewith unto the heart, but to conclude, these Pills will purge
all superfluous humors in the stomach, and principal members, and preserves
the blood from corruption.

CHAP. VIII.
I Must here give you to understand that the infection does oftentimes lie
hidden within us, without any manifest sign or knowledge thereof at the first,
and therefore were it good for sanguine bodies, and such as do abound with
blood, in the summer season to draw six or eight ounces of blood out of the
Basilica vein in the right arm, which is a good means to prevent a further
danger, (as Avicen witnesses) but for full and plethorick bodies, it were best
to purge themselves once in seven or eight days with some easy and gentle
purgation, as hereafter I will show you: but for lean and spare bodies, once
in fourteen days will be enough at most: for wisely says Rondoletius, that it
is not only the venomous and contagious air which we receive that does kill
us, but it is the present communicating of that contagion with some superfluous
humors in our bodies, as in his treatise De Peste appears: therefore now will
I show you how to purge the body.

Pills good to purge.
. Alloes Cicatrine, ten drachms, Agarick of the whitest,. iiii. Myrrh, Mastick,
of either two drachms: Saffron two scruples.

Make these into fine powder, then compound them together in a mortar, with so
much Oximell simplex, Sirrup of Lemons, or of Staecados, as shall be
sufficient, you may give one dram, or a dram and half of these Pills, half
an hour before supper: but for a choleric body, you must leave out two drachms
of the Agarick in making of the receipt, and in place thereof add two drachms
of Rubarb, and for the melancholy, two drachms of Epithimum, and give the same
quantity in weight.

A good purging potion.
Raisins, the stones being picked out and washed, of either one ounce: Polipode
of the Oak, Elecampane root dried, roots of wild small Sorrel, Succory roots
cleansed, of either half an ounce: Leaves of Burrage, Bugloss, Burnet, Scabios,
Morsus diaboli, of either a little handful: Flowers of Burrage, Bugloss,
Rosemary, Violets, Broom, of either a little handful: Seeds of Fennel, sour
Citrons, of either two scruples: Shaving of Hearts horn, half a dram.

Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of fair water until half be
consumed, then strain it. Take of the decoction aforesaid, three ounces.

Rubarb, two drachms and half, Cinnamon, half a dram.

Slice them both, and put them with the liquor in a close cup, and so let it
stand to infuse in a warm place twelve hours, then strain it out strongly, and
add thereto one ounce of the Sirrup of Maiden-haire, and so drink it warm in
the morning about six of the clock, and refrain from meat, drink, or sleep two
hours after it, this is good in lean and spare bodies: you may for the
phlegmatic body, add in the infusion, one dram of Aggarick Trosciscated.

A purging powder for such as cannot take Pills.
. Alloes Ciccatrine, one ounce, Myrrh, Cinnamon, of either two drachms,
Saffron, one scruple.

Make them all in fine powder, and give one dram in a draught of White Wind.

Flowers stopped, how to provok them.
For that women which have not their natural course o^ them, are most prone to
receive and take the infection, I have here set down good Pills, which I have
always found excellent not only for that purpose, but will also resist the
danger of infection.

. Alloes Ciccatirne, one ounce, Roots of Gentian, Aristolochia rotunda,
Dittander, Saffron, of either half a dram: Roots of garden Madder,
Methridate, of either one dram.

Cause them all to be ground in small powder, then mix it with the Methridate
and some sirrup of Artemesia, or Mugwort, give one dram of these Pills every
morning twelve days togerher, or until her terms break.

Issues commended against the Plague.
IN plethorick and full bodies, I have found nothing more safer in the time of
the Plague, then to make them an artificial Issue, either in the leg or arm,
for never hitherto have I known any one which has had an Issue, or Ulcer
running on him that has been infected with the plague. Palmarius and Forestus,
do both affirm it to be true and certain, but here some ignorant people do
hold opinion that having once an Issue, he must be constrained to keep it
always, which is most erroneous, for then those which have had Ulcers running
upon them, some six, ten, yea sixteen years, may not be cured without some
Issue to be made in some other place, but therein they deceive themselves, for
my self by good proof have often found the contrary in diverse people which I
have cured, some six, some ten, yea sixteen years past, and yet to this day do
remain in perfect good health without any Issues.

CHAP. IX. What Diet we ought to keep.
FOr our diet as Hippocrates teaches us, we must have a care not to exceed in
eating and drinking but to keep a mean therein, and in any case to beware of
surfeting and drunkenness, which are enemies both to the body and soul, but as
we may not exceed in eating and drinking, so to endure great hunger and thirst
is most dangerous, our meat ought to be of a facile and easy digestion, partly
tending to a drying quality; as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Pullets, Partridge,
Pheasants, Quails, Pigeons, Rabbets, Kid, Veal, Mutton, Birds of the
Mountains, and such like; but Beef, Pork, Venison, Hare and Goats flesh is to
be refused, and so are all water fowls, as Duck, Swan, Goose, Widgen, Teal, and
such like, because they are hard to digest, and do increase ill blood, and
naughty juice in the body: Lambs flesh, because of his exceeding moisture is
also to be refused, Eggs in the Summer not good, but in Winter tolerable: All
Fishes which are of a hard flesh, whether they be of the Sea, or fresh Rivers
are to be allowed. In fresh Rivers the Perch, Barble, Gudgeon, Loch, Cool,
Trout, and Pike are good; and for Sea fish, the Gilthed, Turbet, Sole, Rochet,
Gurnard, Lobster, Crab, Praunes, Shrimps, Whiting, and such like eaten with
vinegar. There are some Authors which hold opinion, that Fish is better to be
eaten then flesh in the great fervent heat of the year, because they do make a
more cold blood in the body then flesh; another reason is, because they do
live under the water, they are not infected with any contagion of the air, as
Beasts and birds may be, and therefore more wholesome, but in my judgment flesh
is more wholesome, because it doth-breed a more pure, and fine Juice in the body
then any Fish whatsoever; your bread ought to be made of pure wheat, not too
new, nor too old, but of one days baking, or two at most is best: Rye bread is
to be eschewed, because of his great moisture: your drink is best beer or ale,
not too strong or new, but the staler and clearer it is the better, at your
meals a draught or two of Claret wine is tolerable, but in hot weather it were
good to allay it with a little water, for wine does warm the stomach, help
digestion, and comfort the heart.

For your Pottage you may take in the Summer.
Parsley, Lettice, Sorrel, Endive, Succorie, Sperage, Hop-buds, Burnet,
Burrage, Buglosse, Thime, Mints, Hysop, but in Winter, Balm, Bittanie, Thime,
Marigold, Hysop, Majoram, Mints and Rue are good. For your Sallets take
Pimpernell, Purslane, Mints, Sorrel, Hore-hound, Young cole, Hop-buds, Sperage,
Thime, Tops of Fennel, Tarregon, Lettice, and Watercresses are good.

Capers are greatly commended being preserved in Vinegar, and eaten with a
little oil and vinegar, and so are Olives very good also.

For your sauce, the juice of a Limon, Citron, or Orange is best, the juice of
Sorrel and Vinegar is also good.

All raw fruits are to be refused, except those which tend to sour taste, as
Pomgranates, damask Prunes, Pippins, red and sour Cherries, and Wallnuts,
Quinces, and Pears preserved are very good eaten after meals.

All kind of Pulse is to be refused, as Beans, Pease, and such like, because
they increase wind, and make raw humors and ill juice in the body.

Refrain from Garlic, Onyons, Leeks, Pepper, Mustard, and Rocket, because they
do over-heat the body, make adustion of the blood, and cause fumes to ascend
into the head.

Cheese is not good, because it does engender gross and thick humors. Milk is
also to be refused, because it does quickly corrupt in the stomach.

CHAP. X. Shows what Exercise and Order is to be kept.
YOu must beware of all vehement and immoderate exercise, which does provoke
sweat, as is Tennis, dancing, leaping, running, football, hurling, and such
like, because they do overmuch heat the body, and open the Pores of
respiration, whereby the infected air has the more scope to enter our bodies,
but moderate exercise is very convenient, the use of hot houses at this time I
think very dangerous, because it does too much open the pores.

Walk not into the open air in the morning before the Sun has had some power
to cleanse and clear the same, and in any case go not abroad when great fogs
and mists are upon the earth, for it is dangerous: but if urgent occasions move
you, then before you go forth of your doors be sure to eat some preservative
first, and then take some good and odoriferous Pomander, Nodule, or Nosegay in
your hand, as before is showed you. The extreme heat of the day is likewise to
be refused to walk in, because it chafeth the blood; as also in the evening
after the Sun is set, for then unsavory and unwholesome Fogs arise out of the
earth, and in any case if you can avoid it come not near any any place
infected, but use to walk in the open air and dry ground.

Use Venus combats moderately, but none at all were better, the best time to
use them is three or four hours after supper, before you sleep, and then rest
upon them.

Beware of anger, fear, and pensiveness of the mind, for by their means the
body is made more apt to receive the infection.

Use pleasant and merry recreations, either with music, pleasant company to
talk withal, or reading some good books.

Bewar of sleeping at noon, but specially in the Winter season, but in Summer
to take after dinner a nap of half an hour or an hour is tolerable in elderly
bodies.

Watch not long in the evenings but two or three hours after supper is a good
time to take your rest.

CHAP. XI. Teaches what orders Magistrates, and Rulers of Cities and Towns,
should cause to be observed,
FIrst, To command that no stinking dunghills be suffered near the City.

Secondly, Every evening and morning in hot weather to cause cold water to be
cast in the streets, especially where the infection is, and every day to cause
the streets to be kept clean and sweet, and cleansed from all filthy things
which lie in the same.

Thirdly, And whereas the infection is entered, there to cause fires to be made
in the streets every morning and evening, and if some Frankincense, Pitch, or
some other sweet thing be burnt therein, it will be much the better.

Fourthly, Suffer not any Dogs, Catts, or Pigs to run about the streets, for
they are very dangerous, and apt to carry the infection from place to place.

Fifthly, Command that the excrements and filthy things which are voided from
the infected places be not cast into the streets or rivers which are daily in
use to make drink, or dress meat.

Sixthly, That no Chirurgians, or Barbars which use to let blood, do cast the
same into the streets or rivers.

Seventhly, That no Vauts or Privies be then emptied, for it is a most
dangerous thing.

Eighthly, That all Inholders do every day make clean their stables, and cause
the dung and fi^th therein to be carried away out of the City: for by suffering
it in their houses, as some do use to do, a whole week or a fortnight, it does
so putrify that when it is removed, there is such a stinking and unwholesome
smell, as is able to infect the whole street where it is.

Ninthly, To command that no Hemp or Flax be kept in water near the City or
Town, for that will cause a very dangerous and infectious savor.

Tenthly to have a special care, that good and wholesome Victuals and Corn be
sold in the markets, and so to provide, that no want thereof be in the City,
and for such as have not wherewithal to buy necessary food, that there to
extend their charitable and godly devotion: for there is nothing that will more
increase the Plague, then want and scarsity of necessary food.

Eleventhly, To command that all those which do visit and attend the sick, as
also all those which have the sickness on them, and do walk abroad, that they
do carry something in their hands, thereby to be known from other people. And
here I must advertise you of one thing more which I had almost forgotten (which
is) that when the infection is but in few places, there to keep the people in
their houses, not suffering any one of them to go abroad, and so to provide,
that all such necessaries as they shall need may be brought unto them during
the time of their visitation: and when it is stayed, then to cause all the
clothes, bedding, and other such things as were used about the sick, to be all
burnt, although at the charge of the rest of the Inhabitants you buy them all
new, for fear least the danger which may ensue thereby, do put you to a far
greater charge and grief: all these aforesaid things are most dangerous, and
may cause a general infection, to the destroying of a whole City, and
therefore I do wish that great care be had thereof.

CHAP. XII. Does show what you must do when you go to visit the sick.
FIrst before you enter into the house, command that a great fire be made in
the chamber where the sick lies, and that some odoriferous perfume be burnt in
the midest of the chamber, and before you go to him, eat some cordial
preservative, and smother your clothes with some sweet perfume, then wet your
temples, ears, nose, and mouth, with Rose Water and Vinegar mixed together,
then take in your mouth a piece of the root of Angelica, the rind of a sower
Citron, or a Clove prepared as before is showed, and have some Nosegay, Nodule,
or Pomander, appropriate in your hand, which you must always smell unto, so
may you the more bouldlier perform your intent: but herewithall you must have a
special care, that during the time you are with the sick, you stand not
betwixt the sick body and the fire, for that is dangerous; because that the
fire of his nature draws all vapors unto it self; but keep you always on the
contrary side, so that the sick may be betwixt you and the fire: and for such
as are to let any sick infected body to bleed, it were good they did cause the
keeper of the sick body to lay open that arm or leg which is to be let blood
before he approach near: the reason is, for that most commonly all that are
sick in this contagious disease, are for the most part in a sweat, and
therefore suddenly to receive the breath thereof, would be very dangerous.

Now when you have been with any one so infected, before you go into the
company of any whole and sound people, it were necessary you do stand by a good
fire, having all the clothes about you which you did wear when you were with
the sick, and then turn and air your self well thereby, so shall you be sure
the less to endanger others by your company. Thus have I as breefly as I can
devise set down all the ordinary means which my self have used, and by others
known to be used for preserving you from this contagious and dangerous disease,
which in the most part of people will suffice, but for such as dwell whereas
they may have the counsel of a learned Physician, I do wish them to take his
advice, especially for purging and letting blood, because none can so exactly
set down in writing the perfect course thereof (which may be understood rightly
of the common sort) so well as he which has the sight of the body: for that
many bodies are oftentimes troubled with some one humor abounding more then
another, which here to treat of would be too tedious, neither can it profit the
common people, for whose sakes I have taken this pains: and now will I show
the signs to know when one is infected therewith, as also which are the
laudable signs, and which are the contrary, and lastly the means (by God his
assistance) how for to cure the same.

CHAP. XIII. Shows the signs of infection.
THe signs and tokens hereof are diverse, as first, it is perceived by the
sudden weakness, loosing and overthrowing of our natural strength, without
any manifest cause thereof going before, and sometimes it does begin with a
gnawing and biting in the mouth of the stomach, the pulse will grow weak,
feeble, and unequal, with a great straightness and heaviness about the
heart, as if some heavy burden or weight were laid thereon, with shortness of
breathing, vomiting, or at least a great desire to vomit, great pain in the
head: insatiable thirst proceeding of their great interior heat: sluggishnes,
and universal faintness of all the body, with a great desire to sleep, and an
astonishment of the mind and vital spirits: and for the most part they
complain of a great pain which is felt in some one place or places of their
bodies, where the botch or blain is by nature intended to be thrust forth, yet
some at the first have them appearing: and for the most part, they are taken at
the first with a sharp and rigorous fever.

Good signs.
When the botch or Carbunkle comes out in the beginning of the sickness with
a red color, and yellowish round about it, and that it does quickly come to
maturation, the fever to cease, and the party finds himself eased of his
grief, and quickened in his spirits, these are good and laudable signs of
recovery.

Evil signs.
When the botch at the first comes out blackish, or black in color, also
when the botch is opened, the flesh within does look blew, and that then there
appear not any matter or quitture in the wound, but as it were a spume or froth
issuing out thereof, are ill and deadly signs,

When the botch waxes so hard that by no means it will come to suppuration,
but resists whatsoever is done unto it for the furthering thereof, and so
returns in again into the inward parts suddenly, is a token of sudden death
at hand, and so it is if either before or after it is broken it look of a
bluish color, or of diverse colors, like the Rainbow, round about it.

When the Carbunckle or Blain does suddenly dry up, as if it were scorcht with
the fire, and that the place round about it does show to be of a wannish blew
color, is a deadly sign: if in the skin appear green or black spots, the
excrements of diverse colors with worms in it either dead or living, having a
vile stinking savor, and spitteth stinking and bloody matter, does betoken
death.

When the sick complains of great and extreme heat in the inward parts, and
yet cold outwardly, the eyes staring or weeping the face terrible, the said
excrements or urin passing away, and the party not knowing thereof, are evil
signs.

When in the fourth or seventh day they are taken with a frenzy, or do fall
into an extreme bleeding at nose, or have a great flux with a continual
vomiting, or a desire to vomit and do it not, extreme pain at the heart,
watchfullness, and the strength clean gone, are deadly signs. When the party
being very sick, yet says he feels himself well, his eyes sunk deep in his
head, and full of tears, when he thinks all things do stink, his nails looking
blew, the nose sharp, and as it were crooked, the breath thick and short with a
cold sweat in the breast and face, and turning and playing with the clothes, the
pulse creeping or scarcely to be felt, and grievous unto him to speak, these
are infallible signs of death at hand. Some, before any of these signs are
perceived, do die, and some likewise which have diverse of them appearing, and
yet do escape, such is the uncertainty of this disease: there are many other
symptoms which do happen in this contagious disease, which would be too tedious
to declare, but these as the chiefest may suffice.

The end of the first Treatise.
The Second Treatise, showing the means how to cure the Plague.
CHAP. I.
When we perceive any to be infected with this contagious disease, we must
with all possible speed seek all the means we can how to prevent the malignity
thereof, whose property is at the first to assault the principal part, which
is the heart, and therefore requires present help; for unless something be
done within eight or four and twenty hours, little will it then prevail to
attempt it, for by that time nature is either subdued, and clean overthrown, or
else has thrust the same to the exterior parts, or otherwise digested it: yet
may we not neglect at any time, to use all the means we can, in helping and
furthering of nature to the uttermost of our endeavor, because we do
oftentimes see nature so wearied, and weakened in expelling of this venomous
matter, that unless some help be added to assist and comfort her, the party,
for lack thereof, dies, which otherwise might be saved: For I have oftentimes
seen by diligent helping of nature, that to be effected and brought to good
pass, which I have judged most desperate. There are four intentions required
for the curing thereof; that is, by bloodletting, Cordials, sweat and purging:
but the manner how to execute the same, has bred great contention both amongst
the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto
the learned it were needless, and for the commonalty little would it avail
them, therefore in brief will I show you what I have observed touching the cure.

First, if it be in a Plethorick, sanguine, and strong body, and has pain in
the head, great heat at the heart, thirstnesse, the pulse strong, and
laboring, or beating strongly, and has great and large veins appearing;
these ought presently to be let blood in that side where ye perceive the grief
does proffer it self to come forth, and not visibly appearing, tending to
maturation: For then we may not draw blood, but use all other means we can
devise, in helping nature to expel it, neither may you draw blood, if the
party have a flix or lask (which is an evil sign) in the beginning of the
disease, for by that means you shall hinder nature greatly, but only give the
party Cordials; neither may you stop the flix in the beginning, but if it be
extreme, and that it stay not the second day, then must you give some
purgation, which may leave an astringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure
of the flix shall be showed. For as Hyppocrates, in his first book and one and
twentieth Aphorism, does admonish us, we must consider and mark, how nature
does incline her self, for that will teach us what we are to do.

Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear underneath the chin about
the throat, then presently draw blood in both veins under the tongue, and
immediately after that apply a cupping glass; with scarification in one side
of the neck next unto the fore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear
least suddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to
the botch, the feathers being first plucked away from the rump, and a grain of
Salt put into the tewell, and so hold the bare place to the grief until the
Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and so
continue in changing them so long as they do die, and lastly apply a
mollificative Cataplasme or plaster to the same place, as in the fifth Chapter
following is showed, which is made with Vnguentum basillicon, and to the botch
apply the Epithemation and Cataplasme in the seventh Chapter following. But if
it be in the neck, he does complain, then let him blood in the Cephallica vein
in the arm, of the same side where he complains.

If in the groin or flank he does complain, then let him blood in the foot on
the same side, and open the vein called Maleola, or Saphena, the quantity must
be according as the age and strength of the party requires, but at most draw
not above six or eight ounces: For Avicen wills us, to preserve blood as the
treasure of nature.

But in a weak, spare, and cachochimious body (as Galen teaches us) we may not
draw blood at all, for thereby should you greatly endanger the Patient, but
help such by Cordials and sweat.

And here you shall understand, that unless Phlebotomy be done at the first,
that is, within six or eight hours at most, it will be too late to attempt it,
neither may you do it if the sore do appear up in height tending to
suppuration, for then should you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman,
has discharged and thrust forth that venomous matter, which otherwise would
have killed us.

And here touching Phlebotomy or bloodletting, you must have this special
care, that you draw not blood on the opposite side, as if it be on the left
side the sore appear, then draw not blood on the right side; if it appear in
the flank, then draw not blood in the arm, but in the foot, for otherwise you
shall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and so
kill the body.

And although the party complain not more in the one side then the other, yet
by the pulse shall you perceive on which side the venom lies hidden, for on
that side where nature is oppressed, there shall you find the pulse more weak,
feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other side.

And here you shall understand, that in some it has been seen, that nature of
it self at the first, has thrust out that venomous matter in some place of the
body, with a botch appearing high, and tending to suppuration, or a carbunckle,
or spots called purples. Now here if you draw blood, you do then greatly
endanger the body; but in this case you must only give Cordials, and use all
the means you can to bring it outward, either by maturation, or evaporation,
as hereafter shall be showed you.

And here you shall further understand, that where the age, constitution, nor
strength of the party will permit that Phlebotomy be done, yet for the better
help of nature you must apply Ventoses, with reasonable deep scarification,
unto the next place adjoining, where the party complains, thereby the more
speedily to draw the venomous matter unto the superficial parts, and there to
apply the rumps of Chickens, as before is taught you, and so apply to the place
some strong maturative, and atrractive plaster, or Cataplasme, as hereafter
shall be showed you. If the grief be in the head or throat, then apply Ventoses
to the neck: If it be in the emunctuaries of the heart, then apply them to the
shoulders: If in the emunctuaries of the liver, then apply them to the buttocks
or thighs, now when this is done, either by Phlebetomy, or Ventoses, then
within an hour or two at the most after it, you must give the sick some good
Cordial Medicine, which has power to comfort the heart, resist the venomous
matter, and also procure sweat, whereof out of the following you may make
choice as you list.

An excellent good Powder to expel the Plague, which also provokes sweat.
. Roots of Gentian, Bittanie, Petasitis, ana,. i. Roots of Tormentill,
Dittander, ana, iii. Red Sanders. ss. Fine Pearl of both sorts, ana,. i. Fine
Bolarmoniack prepared, fine Terra sigillata, ana,. vi. Rindes of Citrons, red
Corrall, Roots of Zedoiar, shaving of Ebony, bone of a Stags heart, ana,
sixteen grains: Fragments of the five precious stones, ana,. ss. Shaving of a
Unicorns horn, Succini, ana,. ss. Leaves of Gold and Silver, ana, one and half
in number,

Make all these in fine powder, every one several by himself, and then mix
them all together, and give thereof. i. or. iiii. more or less as occasion
requires, either in Sorrel, Scabios, or Carduus benedictus water two or three
ounces, whereunto you must add a little Sirrup of Lemons, or sour Citrons, and
give it warm, the Bolarmoniack must be pounded small, then washed in Scabios
water, and so dried.

Another good Powder.
. Leaves of Dittander, called Dictami cretici, Roots of Tormentil, Bittanie,
Pimpernell, Gentian, Zedoiar, ana,. i. Terra lemnia, Alloes Cicatrina, fine
Myrrh, Rinds of sour Citrons, ana. i. Mastick, Saffron, ana, half a dram.
Bolarmoniack prepared as beforesaid, ii.

All these must be made in fine powder, and so mixed together, you may give two
scruples, or one dram thereof with any of the aforesaid waters.

A good Opiat to expel venom, and provoke sweat.
Conserve of the flowers of Burrage, Bugloss, Violets, Bittanie, ana,. ii.
Venus Triacle. ii. Red Terra sigillata, Terra lemnia, Mithridate, ana. i.
Shaving of Ebonie, And Hartshorn, Orient Pearls, Roots of Tormentill, ana i.
Shaving of Unicorns horn, Root of Angelica, ana half a dram. Sirrup of the
Juice of small Sorrel and Bugloss, ana, so much as shall suffice.

Mix all these together in the form of an Opiat, then take of the same Opiat,
one dram and half. Scabios water, Balm water, ana ii.

Dissolve the Opiat in the waters, and drink it warm, then walk a little upon
it, and then go to bed and sweat.

Another excellent good means to expel the venom, and procure sweat.
Take a great white Onyon, and pick out the coar or middle of him, then fill
the hole with good Venus Triacle, or Andromachus Triacle, and Aqua vitae, then
stop or cover the hole of the Onyon again, and roast him in the hot ashes until
he be soft, then strein it strongly through a cloth, and give it the sick to
drink, and the rest that remains, pound it small, and apply it to the sore,
and sweat upon it.

Now when he has taken any of the aforesaid Cordials, if he chance to vomit it
up again, then wash his mouth with Rosewater and Vinegar, and then give him
more of the same again, which must be proportioned according to the quantity
vomited, for if all were vomited, then give so much more: (if less) then
according to the quantity vomited, and if he vomit that also, then give him
more, and so continue it to the third or fourth time, if cause so require, but
if at no time he do retain it, then is there small hope of recovery; I have
known diverse, which have vomited their Cordials three or four times, and at
last, giving the juice of the Onyon as aforesaid, has kept that, and sweat
upon it, and so recover their health.

Also Minardus Triacle, or Andromachus Triacle being taken two Scruples with
one Scruple of Dioscordium, and dissolved in two or three ounces of this water
following, or Carduus benedictus, Sorrel, and Scabios water, has been found
excellent good and available, both to procure sweat, and expel the venomous
matter.

An excellent good water against the Plague, and diverse other diseases, which
is to be made in May or June.
Take Angelica, Dragons, Scabios, ana three handfuls. Wormwood, Sage,
Salendine, Mugwort, Rue, Rosemary, Varvein, Endive, Mints, ana one handful.
Tormentill, Pimpernell, Agrimonie, Bittanie, ana two handfulls. St. John's wort,
Fetherfew, and Pionie, ana a little handful.

You must mix all these herbs together, then bruise them in a stone mortar
grossly, then put them into a clean vessel of glass or earth, and add thereto
a pottle of White wine, or three quarts, a pint of Rose Water, and a pint of
Vinegar: then mix them well together, and press down the Herbs close
together with your hands, then stop the pot close, and so let it stand to
infuse two days and two nights, then distill it in a stillatorie, this water
has been found excellent good, both to preserve one from the Plague, being
drunk three or four spoonfuls of it in the morning fasting, as also to expel
the disease, being drunk with any of the Cordials aforesaid.

CHAP. II. Shows what is to be done after taking of the Cordial.
NOw so soon as the party has taken his Cordial, (if he be able) cause him
to walk upon it in his chamber a pretty while, then lay him into his naked
bed, being first warmed if it be in cold weather, and so procure him to sweat,
but in any case have a special care to keep him from sleep all that day,
because thereby the blood and vital spirits are drawn to the inward parts, and
there does hold in the venomous matter about the heart; but if the sore appear,
or be perceived to present it self in any place near the heart, then to defend
the malignity thereof before he sweat, it were good to anoint the place
betwixt the region of the heart and the sore with Triacle, or with this Unguent
following.

A good defensative Unguent.
Take Triacle,. ss. Terra i lemnia, Red sanders, ana. i. Mix them together with
a little Rose Water and Vinegar in a mortar, to the form of an Unguent, and so
use it as aforesaid.

And unto the sore place apyly chickens rumps, as before has been told you,
and then anoint the place grieved with Oil of Lillies; and then Epithemate
the heart with any one of these Epithemations following.

Epithemation.
Take the Powder of Diamargaritum frigidum, i. Triasandalum,. vi. Ebeni, ii.
Saffron,. ss. Lettice seed, i. Waters of Roses, Bugloss, and Sorrel, ana vi.
Vinegar. ii. boil them altogether a little.

Another.
Take the waters of Roses, Balm, Bugloss, Carduus benedictus and white wine,
ana iiii. Vinegar of Roses ii. Powder of red Roses, Cinnamon, Triasandalam,
Diamargaritum, Frigidum, ana ss. Mithridatum, i. Triacle, ss. Boil them
together a little, and being blood warm, Epithemate the heart therewith, which
being done, then procure him to sweat, and after sweat, and the body dried,
then apply this quickly to the heart.

A Quilt for the Heart.
Take the flowers of Nenuphare, Burrage, Bugloss, ana, a little handful:
Flowers of Balm, Rosemary, ana iii. Red sanders, Red coral, Lignum aloes,
Rind of a citron, ana, i. Seeds of Basil, Citrons, ana i. Leaves of Dittander,
Berries of Juniper, ana i. Bone of a Stags heart, half a scruple Saffron, four
grains.

Mix all these in gross powder, and put them in a bag of crimson Taffetie, or
Lincloth, and lay it to the heart, and there let it remain. All these things
being done, then procure him to sweat, having a good fire in the chamber, and
windows close shut, and so let him sweat three or four hours more or less,
or according as the strength of the sick body can endure, and then dry the body
well with warm clothes, taking great care that the sick catch not cold in the
doing thereof, and then give him some of this Julep following, and apply the
aforesaid quilt or bag to the heart.

A cordial Julep.
Take Waters of Endive, Purslane, and Roses, ana,. ii, Sorrel water, half a
pint, Juice of Pomgranats, and for lack thereof Vinegar, iiii. Camphire iii,
Sugar, one pound. Boil all these together in the form of a Julep, and give
three or four spoonfuls thereof at a time.

Another Julep.
Take Sirrup of Ribes, Sorrel, Nenuphare, ana. i. Juice of Limons, i. Sorrel
water, viii. Mix all these together, and take two or three spoonfulls thereof
oftentimes, which will both comfort the heart, and quench thirst.

And if in the time of his sweat he be very thirsty, then may you give him to
drink a Tysane made with water, clean Barley, and Licorice scrapt clean and
bruised, boil them together, then strein it, and unto a quart of the liquor add
three ounces of Sirrup of Limons, and give thereof at any time; small beer or
ale is also tolerable, or you may give a spoonful of this Julep following at
any time.

A Julep to quench thirst.
. Sorrell-water, four ounces, Burrage-water, Scabios water, of either one
ounce, Sirrup of Lemons and sour Citrons, of either one ounce.

Mix all these together and so use it as occasion requires at any time: and
give oftentimes a cake of Manus Christi, made with Perls for him to eat. But if
in the time of his sweat you see the sick to faint or swoun, then apply to his
temples, and the region of the heart, this mixture following.

. Conserve of Roses, Burrage, Bugloss, Broom flowers, of either one ounce:
Mithridate, four ounces, Triacle, one ounce, Flowers of Violets,
Pellamountaine, Red Roses, of either one drachme, Roots of Ireos, one dram,
Musk, Sivet, of either eight grains.

Mix all these together with a quantity of Rose-Vinegar in the form of an
Opiat, this must be spread on Plasters, and applied to the heart and temples,
and to the soales of the feet apply this plaster following.

Take of the aforesaid Opiat, ii. unto the which you must put so much more of
an Onyon, which must have the middle part thereof taken out, and the hole
filled with Mithridate, and Aquavitae, and so roasted in the ashes, and then mix
it with the Opiat, and apply it to both soales of the feet.

Now when all this is done, and that one hour is past after his sweat and body
dried as aforesaid: it were good you did give the sick some good comfortable
broth, although he vomit it up again, then let him rest two hours and then
offer him more, which you must do oftentimes, and but little at a time.

And if after all this done he continue still weak and faint without any
amendment, then give him another Cordial, as ye did at the first, and so cause
him to sweat again so long as his strength can well endure it, and after sweat
give more of the Julep aforesaid, for by this means you shall oftentimes see
the sore, which did offer it self to come forth, will be clean discussed and
consumed away: but if it do not by this means go away, then use all the means
you can to bring it to suppuration, and then open it with some caustic or
incision, as hereafter shall be showed you at large.

The next day after his sweat, you may tolerate him to sleep one hour or two
in the forenoon, whereby to prevent pain or lightness of the head, which may
chance through want thereof: and if after his sleep the party be sick and
faint, then immediately give him some good Cordial, according as the state of
his body requires, either in temperate or extreme heat, as before is showed:
and in one hour after that give him some comfortable broth made with Veale,
Mutton, Chicken, or such like, wherein some Burrage, Bugloss, Pimpernell, and a
little Hysop, with some Parsley roots, the inner pith being taken out, must be
boiled, whereof he must take a little at a time, three or four times a day, and
betwixt times in taking of his broth, give him three or four spoonfulls of this
Julep following, which does resist venenosity from the heart, and also quench
thirst.

A Julep to quench thirst and resist Venenosity.
. Water of Scabios, Burrage, Sorrel, ana. ii. Sirrup of Lemons, sour Citrons,
and the juice of Sorrel, of either one ounce.

Mix all these together, and give thereof as cause requires.

Then at night he may sleep three or four hours more, and the next day, being
the third or fourth day of his accubet, you may purge him with one of the
purgations here following, but in any case you must take heed that you do not
purge with any strong or Scammoniate medicine, because it may cause an extreme
flux, which will be most dangerous, because it will overmuch weaken the body,
and hinder concoction, for most commonly in this disease the body of it self is
subject to fluxes.

Now when you see the purgation has done working, then give the sick some
Cordial thing, as hereafter follows, which he must also take the next
morning following.

humors, it were good that you purge him again the next day.

CHAP. III. Shows what symptoms often chance, and how to help them.
FOr that in this contagious disease there are diverse dangerous symptoms which
do oftentimes chance, I will here show you good means how to help the same.

For lightness of the head through want of sleep.
. Hordei mundi. P. i. Amigd. dull. depilatum. i. ss. Sem. iiii. Frigid. ma.
mund. ana. i. Aqua font. q. 5. fiat decoctio. Decoct. col. l. i. Sir. de

with this ointment.

Ointment to provoke sleep.
. Unguent popillionis,. iiii. Unguent. Alabastrini, Ol. Nenuphariae misce, ana.
ii.

This ointment is not only good to provoke sleep but will also ease the pain
of the head, if the place grieved be anointed therewith.

For raveing and raging.
If the party rave, then give him one scruple of the powder of Hartshorn
burnt, with half an ounce of the sirrup of Violets and Lemons, and apply this
sacculus following to the head.

A good Sacculus for raving and raging.
. Florum Nenupharis, P. i. Cort. Pap.. ii. Santali albi, Rub. Citri, ana.. i.
Florum ros. rub, P. i. Florum Viol. P. ss. Florum camomil. Betonicae, ana. i.

Shread them all small, then pound them grossly, and quilt them in a bagg, and
apply it to the head, and it will help you.

Aphtham, to help it.
In this contagious disease, there does chance an ulceration of the mouth,
which is called Aphtham, it comes by means of the great interior heat which
the sick is oppressed with in the time of his sickness, which if it be not
well looked unto in time, it will greatly endanger the body, for Remedy whereof
use this Gargarism.

A good Gargarism for the mouth.
. Clean barley, one handful, wild Daysie leaves, Plantaine leaves, Strawberry
leaves, Violet leaves, of either one handful: Purslane seed, one scruple,
Quinse seed, one scruple and half. Licorice bruised, four drachms.

Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of water until the water be half
consumed, then strain it, and take one pint and half thereof, and add thereto
Sirrup of Roses by infusion, and sirrup of dried roses of either four drachms:
Diamoron two ounces.

Mix these together, and gargarize and wash the mouth therewith oftentimes
being warm, and it helps.

Vomiting extremely, how to help it.
If it come in the beginning of the disease, as most commonly it does, there is
no better means to stay it, then by giving of Cordials and by sweating, by
which means that venomous matter which is the cause thereof is expelled, and
breathed out, but if after Cordials given, and sweat, it does not stay, it is a
very ill and dangerous sign: yet what means I have used to stay the same, I
will here show you.

A good bag for the stomach.
. Dried leaves of Mints, Elder, Origanie, Wormwood, Calamint, Mugwort, Thime,
Balm, Pellemountaine, tops of Dill, of either a little handful: Seeds of
Carduus Benedictus, Fennel, Annis, of either four drachms: Roots of Ciperus,
Calamus aromaticus, of either four drachms: Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, of either
half a dram.

Make all these in gross powder, then put it into a linen bag, which must be
made so broad and long, as will cover the stomach: then take Rose Water and
strong Vinegar, of either ten spoonfulls, wherein do you dissolve one ounce of
Mithridate, then must you first wet the said bag in two parts of clean water
and a third part of White or Claret Wine, and let him soak therein a little
while, the liquor being first warmed on a Chafer and coals, and then wet him
in the Rose Water and and Vinegar being warm, and so apply it to the stomach,
and when he waxes cold, warm him therein again, and let him remain half an
hour in all, and then take him away, and dry the stomach with a warm cloth, and
then anoint it with this ointment following.

. Chymicall oils of Rosemary, Sage, of either one dram: Vinegar, Mithridate,
of either one dram.

Mix all these together, and so use it, and if the party be costive, then were
it good to give him a glister, wherein dissolve two drachms of Mithridate, it
is also good to apply Ventoses unto the buttocks and thighs.

Yoxe, or yexing, to stay it.
. Dill seed, two scruples and half: White Poppy seed, Purslane seed, of either
one scruple and a half.

Bruise them a little, then knit them in a fine linen cloth, and let it soak
in the drink which he uses, and when you give him drink, wring out the bag
therein, and let him drink it, and that will stay it, also the order aforesaid
to help vomiting, is good to stay the yoxe, or yexing, but if neither of them
prevail, then will the sick hardly escape death.

Flix, how to stop it.
You must first give the patient this purpation following, which does not only
purge away those slim^e humors which is the cause thereof, but does also leave
an astringencie behind it.

. Rhab. elect.. iii. Cinamoni,. ii. Aquarum Endiviae, Borraginis, ana. ii.

Infuse them together twelve hours, then strain it out strongly, and add
thereto one ounce of Sirrup of roses laxative, and so drink it warm, refraining
from meat, and drink, and sleep three hours after it: and at night when it
has done working, give this confection following.

. Conservae ros.. iiii. Dioscordii,. i. ss. Pull. Diatragag. frigid.. i,
Dialkermes, G. x. Sir. de Lemon.. ii. misce.

When you have given this confection, then do you Epithemate the region of the
heart with this Epithemative following,

Epithemation for the heart.
. Aquarum Buglossae, Burrag, Rosarum, Oxialidis, ana. iiii. Throchiscorum de
camphera,. i. Pull. diamargarit. frigid.. i. Aceti alb.. i. Offa de cord
cervi,. ss. Santal. Rub. Coral. Rub. misce. ana. i.

With this you must Epithemate the Region of the heart warm a quarter of an
hour, and if by this means it stay not, then the next day give some of this
confection following, which I have found excellent good for the stopping of any
flix whatsoever.

. Conservae ros. siccae.. i. Pull. Rhab. troschiscat. i. Terrae lemniae. ss.
Lap. Hemattitis, Sang. Draco. Bolarmoni. ana. ii. Mithridatii, misce,. i.

You must every morning and evening give two dram hereof, and drink some
Plantaine water after it.

Now here you must understand, that if the flix come in the beginning of the
sickness, and that no botch, Carbunkle, nor spots appear in the body, then in
any case you may not go about to stop it, but suffer nature to discharge it
self, and only help nature with Cordials, and Epithemations applied to the
heart, but if by the continuance thereof, the Patient grow very weak and faint
therewith, then is it to be repressed, as before is showed, but it must be the
third day before you attempt to do it.

But if this flix come when the botch or Carbunkle does appear, and tending to
maturation, then is it very dangerous, for by that means the venomous matter
is drawn back again into the principal parts, and so kills the Patient.

CHAP. IIII. Shows the general cure of a botch when he appears outwardly.
FIrst, give Cordials, and use the defensive before taught you in the second
Chapter, thereby to keep it from the heart, and then bring it to maturation as
follows.

A good Maturative.
Take a great Onyon and roast him in the ashes, then pound him with some powder
of white Mustard Seed, and for lack thereof some Triacle, and pound them
together, and so apply it to the grief warm, and renew it twice a day, which
within three or four days at most will bring it to suppuration.

Another.
Take white Lilly roots, Enulacompane roots, Scabios, and Onyons, of either two
ounces.

Roast all these together in a Cole leaf, or a wet paper, then pound them with
some sweet Butter, and a little Venice Triacle, whereunto do you add some
Galbanum, and Ammoniacum dissolved in Vinegar, and strained from the fesses and
dregs, and so mix them altogether, and apply it, renewing it twice a day.

Another, where no inflammation is.
Take Vnguentum basilicon. iiii. sour Leaven. ii. Oil of Lilies, sweet Butter,
ana.. iiii. Triacle. i. ss. yolks of two Eggs.

Mix them together, and so apply it, and when it is come to suppuration, then
open it in the lowest part, either with a potentiall Caustic, or by inscition,
but the Caustic is best, and when you have opened it, if no matter flow out,
then apply the rumps of Chickens to the sore, as before has been showed: after
that put into the wound a digestive as follows.

A Digestive,
Take the yolk of an Egg, clear Turpentine. iiii. clarified Honey. ii.
Mithridate, or Triacle. ss.

Mix all these together, and use it in the wound until it be well digested,
which you may perceive by the great quantity of white and thick matter that
will flow out of it, and upon the sore lay this Cataplasme until it be digested

A digestive Cataplasme.
. Fat Figs, and Raisins the stones picked out, ana.. ii. Sal nitrum. iv. sour
Leaven. iii. Honey. i. oil of Cammomill. i. ss.

You must shread and pound the Figs and Raisins very small, then commix it with
the rest in a mortar, in form of a pultis, and use it.

And when it is digested, then you must mundifie it with a mundificative, to
which purpose Vnguentum virid. or else Apostolorum mixed with Vnguentum
basilicon will serve, and when it is clean mundified, then to incarnate and
heal it up, do you only anoint or strike it over with a feather wet in
Arceus linament, which must be molten in a saucer, and over all lay a plaster
of Diaculum, or a plaster of Kellebackeron, which is excellent good in all
Imposthumes and tumors, and in this order do you proceed, until the grief be
whole.

CHAP. V. Shows how to bring the botch out, that lies deep within the body
or flesh.
FIrst you must consider, that oftentimes the botch, or carbunkle does offer it
self to come forth in some place of the body, and yet no apparent sign
thereof, but lies deep hidden within, because nature is not of sufficient
strength to thrust it forth; which is easily perceived by the great and almost
intolerable pain, that by some is felt in the place where nature intends to
expel it, which in the most part of people, by bloodletting, Cordials, and
sweat, is clean taken away and evacuated; but if after all this is done it go
not away, then unto these you must use all the means you can to bring it to
the outward parts. First, by giving to the sick oftentimes some Cordial
Electuary to keep it from the heart, then (if no great pain be in the outward
part) you must apply a cupping-glasse with scarification, directly against the
place where the grief is felt, and let it remain thereon a quarter or half an
hour, then take it away, and presently apply the rumps of Chickens, Hens, or
Pigeons to the place (as before has been showed) that being done, then lay
some attractive and maturative plaster or Cataplasme to the place, which here
following is showed, and every sixth hour you must apply the cupping-glass, as
also the rest, until such time as you have brought the venomous matter to the
outward parts, there to be visibly seen, or at least, by feeling to be
perceived, which commonly is effected at the second time, then use no more
cupping, but only apply a maturative to the place.

A good Maturative Cataplasme.
. Rad. simphyti, ma. Liliorum, Ceparum, Allium, ana,. i. Fol. Oxialidis M. i.

You must pound all these together a little, then wrap them in a cole leaf,
and so roast them in the hot embers, then pound them in a mortar, whereunto
add Ol. liliorum, Auxungiaepore. ana.. i. Fermenti acris. vi. Mithridatii. i.

Mix them altogether in form of a Pultus, and so apply it warm, and renew it
twice a day.

Another
. Galbani, Apopanacis, Ammoniaci, ana.. iiii.

Dissolve these in Vinegar if the botch be hot and inflamed (but if it be not)
then dissolve them in Aqua vitae, and being dissolved, then strain it from the
dregs, and add thereto Unguent, basillici, Mithridat. Fomenti acris, ana,.
iiii.

Mix all these together, and apply it.

Another which is sooner made.
Take a great Onyon, make a hole in the middle of him, then fill the place with
Mithridate or Triacle, and some leaves of Ru^, then roast him in the hot
embers, and when it is soft, then pound it with some Barrowes grease, and apply
it to the sore, and that will ripen it in short time, then open and cure it as
in the Chapter before,

But if the pain and inflammation in the place be so great, that the party
cannot endure cupping glasses to be used, then must you apply a Vesicatory to
the place, in the lowest part of the grief.

A Vesicatory.
Take Cantharides bruised in gross powder. ss. sour Leaven. ii. mix them
together in a mortar with a little Vinegar, and apply it, which within twelve
hours will raise a blister, which you must open, and then lay an Ivy or Cole
leaf to the place, and upon all apply any of the Cataplasmes aforesaid, and
dress it twice a day, and once a day at least, give the Patient some Cordial,
and when it is come to a softness, and that you perceive it is imposthumated,
then open it, and so proceed to the cure, as before is showed.

When the botch will not come to Maturation, but continues always hard.
Sometime it is seen that the botch, although it appear outwardly, yet will it
not come to maturation, which commonly is accomplished within three or four
days, but will resist whatsoever you apply to it, and remain and continue
always hard; now here you must presently open it, either with a Caustic or by
inscition, for fear least it strike in again, or at least grow to gangrena, but
before you open it, you must Epithemate the grief with this Epithemation
following, and every morning and evening give the sick some Cordial, and
betwixt the sore and the heart anoint it with the defensive before in the
second Chapter.

An Epithemation.
Take leaves of Mallows, Violets, Cammomill, ana, M. i. Flowers of Dill,
Mellilot, ana.. i. Hollehock roots. iiii. Linseed. ii.

Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of water until half the water be
consumed, and then wet some Wool or Flax therein, being first well beaten and
picked clean, and lay it upon the sore warm, and as it cools, do you take it
away, and lay on another warm stewse, and so continue it half an hour together,
and then open it as beforesaid, and immediately apply to the wound Chickens or
Hens, as before in the first Chapter has been showed you: and if you cannot
get Chickens nor Hens, then a Whelpe or a Pigeon cloven asunder by the back,
and so applied warm will suffice, which must be renewed so oftentimes as cause
requires, and when that is done, then apply unto the wound a digestive, made
as follows.

A Digestive.
Take Turpentine. ss. Honey. ii. Mithridate, or Triacle. ss. the yolk of a new
laid Egg.

Mix all these together and use it in the wound, and upon all lay the digestive
Cataplasme beforesaid, which is made of Figs, or a plaster of Kellebackeron,
or of Diaculum magnum, and dress it twice a day, and every dressing Epithemate
the grief as beforesaid, when it is digested, then mandifie, incarnate, and
sigillate it, as in the Chapter before is showed you.

CHAP. VI. Shows what is to be done when the botch strikes in again.
SOmetimes you shall see the sore will appear outwardly, and suddenly vanish
away again, which is a very dangerous and deadly sign; now when this does
chance, then presently give some good Cordial that has power to expel the
venom, as in the first Chapter of this Treatise you may find choice of, and
immediately apply this Pultus to both the soales of his feet, which must be
made with Culver-dung, and Vinegar mixed together, and spread on a Cole leaf,
and so applied; you must give the Cordial every third hour, and immediately
after the first giving of the Cordial, you must Epithemate the heart with the
Epithemation before expressed, in the second Chapter of this Treatise; and when
that is done, then cause the sick to sweat, if you may, and after his sweat,
and the body well dried, then give him an easy Glister, the next day purge him
with some gentle purgation, as before is showed you. And if by these means you
prevail not, then small hope of life is to be expected; yet Petrus Forestus
wills you, first to give a Glister, and then within two hours after it, to
draw some blood in the same side where the grief is, and to anoint the place
greived with Vnguentum resumptivum, mixed with some Oil of Cammomill, and then
two hours after it to give a Cordial, and procure sweat upon it, and so
following the rest of the orders aforesaid, did recover diverse.

CHAP. VII. Shows how to draw a botch from one place to another, and so to
discuss him without breaking.
FIrst you must apply a cupping glass next adjoining to the lower part of the
sore, on that side where you would have him to be brought, and next unto that
glass apply another, so near the first as you can, and if that be not so far
as you would have the sore to be brought, then apply the third glass, and let
them all remain a quarter of an hour, then take away the last glass, but
suffer the first to remain, then presently apply him again, and let it remain a
quarter of an hour more, and do so three or four times together, but always
suffer the first glass next the sore for to remain; now when you have thus
done, then take all the glasses away, and presently apply a Vesicatory to the
place where the last and uttermost glass did stand, suffering it to remain
there twelve hours, then open the blister, and lay an Ivy or Cole leaf to the
place, and upon all lay a plaster of Kellebackeron, or Diaculum magnum, and
dress it twice a day, the longer you keep it running, the better it will be,
and at length heal it up as other Ulcers are cured.

Now so soon as you have applied the Vesicatory, you must presently epithemate
the botch with this Epithemation.

Epithemation.
Take Mallows, Violets, Cammomill, Dill, and Mellilot, ana, M. i. Hollehock
roots three ounces, Lin-seed one ounce and a half.

Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of water until half the water be
consumed, in this decoction you must wet some unwashed Wool or Flax made clean
and well beaten, then being wrung out a little, apply it warm to the place, and
renew it every hour, during the time that the Vesicatory is in working, and
when you have opened the blister that is made thereby, then only apply this
Cataplasme to the botch it self.

Take Mallows, Violets and Cammomill flowers, of either one handful.

Boil them in water until they be tender, then cut them very small with a
shreading knife, and add thereto Oil of Cammomill and Lillies, of either two
ounces: Barrowes mort two ounces, Wax one ounce.

Melt the Wax in the Oiles, and then put it to the Herbs, and boil them
together a little, then take it from the fire, and add thereto Barley and Bean
flower, a handful of either of them, and so mix them altogether, and apply it
to the grief, renewing it twice a day, which within three or four days will
resolve and discuss the botch; but if it do it not by that time, then use all
the means you can to bring it to supparation, as before is sufficiently showed
you.

CHAP. VIII. Shows how to know a Carbunkle or blain, as also the cure of the
same.
THe Carbunkle or blain does first begin with a little Pustula or wheal, and
sometime with diverse Pustulaes or wheales together, with a great burning and
pricking pain in the place, which Pustulaes are like a scalding bladder,
seeming to be full of water or matter, yet when you open it, little or nothing
will come out of it, and when they are broken, will grow to a hard crust or
scarre, as if it had been burnt with a hot Iron or Caustic, with a great
ponderosity or heaviness in the place. In some it comes in the beginning,
without any Pustula at all to be perceived, but with a hard black crust or a
scarre; sometimes it lies hidden in the inward parts without any outward
appearance at all, as if it be in the lungs, then there is a difficulty of
breathing, with a Cough and soul spitting.

If it be in the Liver or Spleen, then the party feels a great pain and
pricking in the same side; if in the Kidneyes or Bladder it does chance, then
is there suppression or stopping of the Urine, or great pain in the making of
water; if it be in the Brain, then a delirium follows, but howsoever it
chance to come, the party infected therewith has a Fever, with other
accidents, as before in the 13. Chapter of the first Treatise is declared; if
it begin with a green, black, or blew color, or of diverse colors like the
Rainbow, then is it a deadly sign, and so is it, if once it appear and then
suddenly vanish away; but if it be red or yellowish, so it be not in any of the
principal parts, or emunctuaries of the body, as the heart, stomach, armpit,
flank, jaws, or throat, then it is laudable, otherwise in any of these places
very desperate and dangerous to be cured, but wheresoever it does chance,
unless it may be brought to suppuration, it is deadly.

The cure of the Carbunkle.
First, the Universal means must not be neglected, as bloodletting, cordials,
epithemations, sweet and gentle evacuation by purging, as the time and cause
requires, which before in the beginning of this Treatise has been showed at
large, and the same order which is used for the cure of a Botch, is also to be
kept in the cure of a Carbunkle, and to rectify the air of the house by
strewing it with vine and willow leaves, red Roses and such like, as also to
sprinkle the floor with Rose water and Vinegar, and cause the sick oftentimes
to smell unto a cloth wet in Rosewater and Vinegar is very good: these things
being done, then use all the means you can to bring it to Suppuration, for
which purpose this Cataplasm following is very good

A Maturative Cataplasm.
Take Fat Figs iiii. Mustard seed, i. ss. Pound the seed small by it self, the
Figs must first be cut very small, and then pounded likewise, and then add
thereto so much Oil of Lillies as will suffice to make it in the form of a
stiff Pultis, and apply it warm, renewing it twice a day, this must be
continued until the scar begin to grow loose and moveable, and then apply this
following to remove the scar.

Take unsalted butter, the yolk of an Egg, and wheat flour, mix them together,
and apply it until the s^ar do fall away, then do you mundifie it with this
mundificative.

Mundificative annodine.
Take clear Turpentine, iiii. Sirrup of red Roses, i. Honey of Roses, iiii.
Boil them altogether a little, then take it from the fire, and add thereto
Barlie and wheat flour of each. vi. the yolk, of a new laid Egg, and mix them
altogether, and apply it three days, and then use this following.

Another Mundificative.
Take clear Turpentine, iii. Honey of Roses, ii. Juice of Smallege, ii. Barlie
flower, i. ss. Boil them altogether saving the Barlie, until the Juice be
consumed, then take it from the fire, and when it is almost cold, add the
Barlie thereto, and mix them together, and use thereof to the grief until it
be clean mundified, and then incarnate it with Vnguentum Basilicon, and lastly
sigillate it with Vnguentum de cerusa decocted.

Sometime you shall find a little pustule to appear, without any elevation of
the parts adjoining, or outward hardness. Now here to bring it outwardly you
must apply this Cataplasm.

Take Lilly roots, Onyons, and four Leaven, of either one ounce. Boil them in
water until the water be consumed, then bruise them in a mortar, and add
thereto Mustard seed, Culver-dung, White Soap, ana. i. ss. Snails without
shells, vi. in number. Mithridate, Triacle, ana, half a dram, Yolks of four
Eggs.

Mix all these together, and apply it warm to the grief, renewing it thrice a
day, this order must be continued until you see the place elevated tending to
suppuration, then apply a Maturative, and so proceed as next before this is
showed you, and during the whole time of the cure, I hold it better to use
rather Poultises then plasters, because they do not so much stop the Pores,
but give more scope for the venomous matter to breath out.

When the Carbuncle does come with great pain and inflammation, how to help it.
You must first bath and soke the place well with this bag following, and then
presently apply the Cataplasm ensuing, for by this means you shall not only
ease the pain and abate the Inflammation and Fever, but also prevent the danger
of Gangrena which may chance thereby.

The Bag.
Take Mallows, Violets, Plantain, Liblong, ana one handful. Fat Figs, i.
Hollihock roots, Lilly roots, ana. i. Lin-seed, i.

You must shred the herbs grossly, and cut the Figgs and roots small, then
bruise them in a mortar, and mingle them altogether, then put them into two
little bags of linen cloth, and boil them in a sufficient quantity of clean
water, until the water be half consumed, then take out one of the baggs, and
wring out the water a little, and apply it to the grief warm, and when it is
cold, take it away, and lay on the other, and do so half an hour together
every dressing, which must be twice a day at least.

The Cataplasm.
Take Mallows, Violets, Sorrel, Liblong, ana two handfuls, Henbane, a little
handful..

Wrap them all in a ball together, and roast them in the ashes, then bruise
them in a mortar, and add thereto, Mel rosarum, iiii. Triacle, i. ss. Saffron
in powder, half a dram, Yolks of five Eggs.

Mix them together with the rest, adding some Barley flower thereto to thicken
it, and apply it warm, renewing it always before it grow dry and stiff, and
every dressing you must Epithemate the grief first with the baggs aforesaid,
and this order must be continued until the pain and Inflammation be gone, then
to bring it unto Suppuration, if you add to the foresaid Cataplasm some oil
of Lillies, and sweet Butter unsalted, it will be very good, or you may make
this Cataplasm following.

Take Soot of the chimney,. iii. Baysalt,. i. ss. Yolks of two or three Eggs.

Mix all these together in a mortar, and apply it to the grief warm, which must
be always renewed and changed before it grow dry and stiff, this order must
be continued until the sore come to suppuration, then to remove the scar, and
finish the cure, do you follow the order prescribed in the beginning of this
Chapter.

There are other dangerous accidents which do sometimes chance in the botch or
Carbuncle, which here to treat of would little avail the unexpert people,
because they know not the means how to execute the same, but if any such thing
chance, then do I wish you to seek the help of some learned Physician, or
expert Surgeon, whose counsel I do wish you to follow.

The End of the Second Treatise.
A Short Treatise of the Small Pox, showing the Means how for to govern and
cure those which are infected therewith.
CHAP. I. Shows what the Small Pox and Measels are, and whereof it proceeds.
FOr that oftentimes those that are infected with the Plague, are in the end of
the disease sometime troubled with the small Pox or Measels, as also by good
observation it has been seen, that they are forerunners or warnings of the
plague to come, as Salius and diverse other writers do testify: I have thought
it good and as a matter pertinent to my former Treatise, to show the aids and
helps which are required for the same.

I need not greatly to stand upon the description of this disease, because it
is a thing well known unto most people, proceeding of adusted blood mixed with
phlegm, as Avicen witnesses, which according to both ancient and latter Writers
does always begin with a Fever, then shortly after there arises small
Pustulaes upon the skin throughout all the body, which do not suddenly come
forth, but by intermission, in some more or less, according to the state and
quality of the body infected therewith: for in some there arises many little
Pustulaes with elevation of the skin, which in one day do increase and grow
bigger, and after have a thick matter growing in them, which the Greeks call
Exanthemata or Exthymata: and after the Latins Variola, in our English tongue
the small Pox, and here some Writers do make a difference betwixt variola and
exanthemata; for say they, that is called variola when many of those Pustules
do suddenly run into a clear bladder, as if it had been scalled, but the other
does not so, yet they are both one in the cure, they do most commonly appear
the fourth day, or before the eight day, as Avicen witnesses.

What the Measels or Males are.
Avicen says, That the Measels or Males is that which first comes with a
great swelling in the flesh, with many little Pimples which are not to be seen,
but only by feeling with the hand are to be perceived, they have little
elevation of the skin, neither do they grow to maturation, or end with
ulceration as the Pox does, neither do they assault the eyes, or leave any
deformity behind them as the Pox does, neither are they so swift in coming
forth, but do grow more slowly, they require the same cure which the Pox have,
they proceed of choleric and melancholy blood.

The cause of the Pox and Measels.
The primitive cause as Valetius says, is by alteration of the air, in
drawing some putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which does cause an
ebullition of our blood.

The cause antecedent is repletion of meats, which do easily corrupt in the
stomach, as when we eat milk and fish together at one time, or by neglecting to
draw blood, in such as have accustomed to do it every year, whereby the blood
does abound.

The conjunct cause is the menstruall blood, which from the beginning in our
mothers wombs we received, the which mixing it self with the rest of our
blood, does cause an Ebullition of the whole.

The efficient cause is, nature or natural heat, which by that menstruall
matter mixing it self with the rest of our bloods does cause a continual
vexing and disquieting thereof, whereby an unnatural heat is increased in all
the body, causing an Ebullition of blood, by the which this filthy menstrual
matter is separated from our natural blood, and the nature being offended and
overwhelmed therewith, does thrust it to the outward pores of the skin as the
excrements of blood, which matter if it be hot and slimie, then it produces
the Pox, but if dry and subtle, then the Measels or Males. But Mercurialis an
excellent writer in Physic, in his first Book, de morbis puerorum, cap. 2.
agreeing with Fernelius in his Book De abdit is rerum causis, c. 12. does hold
opinion, that the immediate cause of this disease does not proceed of menstrual
blood, but of some secret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the
air, causing an Ebullition of blood, which is also verified by Valetius, and
now does reckon it to be one of the hereditable diseases, because few or none
do escape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are
infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty reasons are
oppugned on both sides, therefore I will leave the judgment thereof unto the
better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceeds of the
Excrements of all the four humors in our bodies, which striving with the
purest, does cause a supernatural heat and ebullition of our blood, always
beginning with a Fever in the most part, and may well be reckoned in the number
of those diseases which are called Epidemia: as Fracastorius in his first Book,
De morbis contag. cap. 13. witnesses this disease is very contagious and
infectious, as experience teaches us: There are two special causes why this
disease is infectious: The first is, be cause it proceeds by ebullition of
blood, whose vapor being entered into another body, does soon defile and
infect the same, the second reason is, because it is a disease hereditable; for
we see when one is infected therewith, that so many as come near him,
(especially those which are allied in the same blood) do assuredly for the
most part, receive the infection also.

CHAP. II. Shows to know the signs when one is infected, as also the good and
ill signs in the disease.
THe signs when one is infected are these, first he is taken with a hot Fever,
and sometime with a Delirium, great pain in the back, furring and stopping of
the nose, beating of the heart, hoarsnesse, redness of the eyes, and full of
tears with heaviness and pain in the head, great beating in the forehead and
temples, heaviness and pricking in all the body, dryness in the mouth, the face
very red, pain in the throat and breast, difficulty in breathing, and shaking
of the hands and feet with spitting thick matter.

When they do soon or in short time appear, and that in their coming out they
do look red, and that after they are come forth they do look white, and
speedily grow to maturation, that he draws his breath easily, and does find
himself eased of his pain, and that his Fever does leave him, these are good
and laudable signs of recovery.

When the Pox lie hidden within and not appearing outwardly, or if after they
are come forth they do suddenly strike in again and vanish away, or that they
do look of a black, bluish, and green color, with a difficulty and
straitness of drawing breath, and that he do often swoun, if the sick have a
flix or lask, when the Pox were found double, that is, one growing within
another, or when they run together in blisters like scalding bladders, and then
on the sudden do sink down and grow dry with a hard black scar or crust, as if
it had been burnt with a hot iron, all these are ill signs.

Avicen says, there are two special causes which produce death unto those
that have this disease: either for that they are choked with great
Inflammation and swelling in the throat called Angina, or having a flix or lask
which does so weaken and overthrow the vital spirits, that thereby the disease
is increased, and so death follows.

How to know of what humors this disease comes.
If it come of blood, then they appear red, with general pain, and great heat
in all the body.

If they come of choler, then will they appear of a yellowish red and clear
color, with a pricking pain in all the body.

If they come of phlegm, then will they appear of a whitish color and scaly, or
with scales.

If they come of melancholy, then will they appear blackish with a pricking
pain.

CHAP. III. Shows the means to cure the Pox or Measels.
THere are two special means required for curing this disease, the first is
to help nature to expel the same from the interior and principal parts unto
the exterior: the second is to preserve both the interior and exterior parts,
that they may not be hurt thereby.

For the first intention, if the age and strength of the sick will permit, and
that the Pox or Measels appear not, it were then good in the first, second, or
third day to draw blood out of the Basilica vein in the right arm, if he be
not under the age of fourteen years, but the quantity must be at the discretion
of him that draws it, either more or less as occasion is offered: but for
children and such as are of tender years, and weak bodies, it were not good to
draw blood out of the arm, but out of the inferior parts, as the thighs, hams
buttocks, and the Emeroidall veins, especially if the party be melancholy, or
else to apply ventose; to the loins, buttocks, or hams, which may boldly be
used both before and after they do appear, either with scarification, or
without, as cause requires, which is a special good means to draw that
Ichorous matter from the interior to the exterior parts; but for sucking
Children, it were best to apply bloud-suckers unto any of the foresaid places,
which is a thing that may be used with more ease then ventoses, neither do I
wish either of them to be used unless necessity require it, which is, when the
matter lies lurking in the interior parts, not offering it self to appear
outwardly: otherwise I hold it better to leave the whole work unto nature,
specially in sucking children: for when we see that nature is ready, or does
endeavor to expel the malignity which is in the interior parts to the
exterior, which may be perceived by reviving of the Spirits, and mitigating of
the Fever: here we ought not to use any means at all, but leave the whole
operation to nature, which we must only help by keeping the sick body in a
reasonable heat, being wrapped in a scarlet, stammell, or red cloth, which may
not touch the skin, but to have a soft linen cloth betwixt them both, and then
cover him with clothes in reasonable sort, and keep him from the open air and
the light, except a little, and also from anger, using all the means you can
to keep the sick in quietness, and if the body be very costive, then to give
an easy Glister.

A Glister.
. Barley, two handfuls, Violet leaves one handful: Boil these in three pints
of water until half be consumed, and strein it: then take of the same
decoction twelve ounces.

Oil of Violets three ounces, red Sugar and Butter, of either one ounce,

Mix them together and give it to the sick warm; you may increase or diminish
the decoction or ingredients according as the age of the party requires: but
if the sick have great heat, then may you add one ounce or four drachms of
Cassia newly drawn unto it, and when he has expelled the Glister, then rub the
arms, hands, legs, and feet, softly with a warm cloth, which is also a very
good means to draw that chorous matter from the interior to the exterior
parts, when all this is done, then if the body be inclined to sweat, you must
further the same by covering him with warm clothes, having a care that you lay
not more on him then he can well endure, for otherwise you may cause faintness
and swouning, which are ill in this case, yet must you always keep the sick
warm, and suffer him not to sleep, or permit very little until the Pox or
Measels do appear: and here you must have a special care to preserve the eyes,
ears, nostrels, throat and lungs, that they be not hurt or offended therewith,
as hereafter shall be showed you, which you must use before he sweat and also
in the sweat if need be.

Eyes, how to preserve them.
. Rose Water, Plantaine-water, of either two ounces, Sumack, two drachms.

Let them boil together a little, or stand infused a night, then mix
therewith half a spoonful of the oil made of the white of an Egg, then wet
two clothes five or six double therein, then lay them upon either eye, cold,
which must be always kept upon the eyes until the Pox be all come forth, and
as they grow dry, wet them in the same liquor again, and apply them, but if
there be great pain and burning within the eye, then must you also put a drop
of this musselage following into the eye: take quinse-seed, half a dram,
bruise it a little, then let it stand infused in three ounces of Rose Water a
whole night, then strein it, and put one drop thereof into the eye three or
four times a day at least, or take of this water.

. Rose Water,. ii. Woman's milk,. i. Myrrh finely powdered six grains.

Mix them together, and use it in the eye as before is showed: this does ease
the pain, resists putrefication, and preserves the sight.

For the cares, you must put a drop of oil of Roses warm into them before he
sweat.

For the nostrels, cause him oftentimes to smell to the vapor of Rose-vinegar,
or else Vinegar, red-roses and Sanders boiled together.

For the throat, let him always hold a piece of white sugar candy in the
mouth, and as it melts swallow it down.

For the Lunges give the sick oftenimes some sirrup of quinses, or conserve of
Roses, a little at a time.

And for his drink, the decocted water of barley, boiled with a little licorice
is best, being mixed with the juice of a Lemon, Citron, Pomegranate, or Rybes:
which the sick best likes, for either of them is very good.

And for his diet, he must refrain from all salt, fat, thick and sharp meats:
and from all sweet things either in meat or drink, his meat must be of a facile
and easy digestion, and that has a cooling property in it, as broth wherein
burrage, buglofs, sorrel, and such like are boiled, and for ordinary drink,
small beer or ale is best.

CHAP IIII. Teaches what is to be done when the Pox or Measels are flow in
coming forth.
NOw when you perceive the Pox or Measels are slow and slack in coming forth,
then must you help nature, with cordials, and by sweat to thrust it out from
the interior and principal parts, unto which purpose I have always found this
drink to be excellent good here following.

. Hordei mund. M. i. Lentium. excort. P. i. Ficuum. No. x. Fol. capil. v.
Lactucae. ana M. ss. Fol. acetosae. M. i. Florum cord. P. i. Semen fenic.. ii.
Semen. 4. frigid. ma. ana. ss. Aqua font. lb. iiii.

Boil all these together until a third part of the water be consumed, and
then strein it.

. Decoct. col. lb. i. Succus granatorum vel ribes,. iiii.

Mix all these together, and give the sick four or six ounces thereof to drink
every morning and evening, which will provoke sweat, and expel the disease,
and if you cannot get the juice of Pomegranats, nor Rybes, then you may take so
much of the sirrup of either of them.

Another good drink to expel the Pox or Measels.
Take a quart of posset-ale, a handful of Fennel seed, boil them together
till a third part be consumed, then strein it, and add thereto one dram of
Triacle, and one scruple of Saffron in powder: mix them together, and give two,
three, or four ounces thereof to drink every morning and evening as cause
requires.

But if it be for a strong and elderly body, you may give any of the expelling
electuaries which are used to expel the Plague, as in the first Chapter for
the curing of the Plague does appear.

But if the sick be so weak that he cannot expel the disease in convenient
time, then it is good to epithemate the heart with this epithemation following.

Epithemation for the heart.
. Aquarum ros. Melissae, Card. b. Buglos. Morsus diaboli, vini alb. ana. iiii.
Aceti Ros.. ii. ss. Pull. Ros. rub. Trium santal. Cinamoni, Elect. diamarg.
frigid. ana. ss. Mithridati,. i. Theriacae,. iiii.

Mix all these together, and let them boil a little, and so warm Epithemate
the heart: and when you have done it, then give some expulsive drink or
electuary as cause requires, and then cause him to sweat upon it, for by this
means you shall obtain your desire by Gods permission.

Thirst, how to quench it.
Now if in the expelling of the pox, the sick be very thirsty and dry, then
give this Julep to drink morning and evening, which I have found very good.

. Sirrup of Jujubes, Nenuphare, and Burrage, of either four drachms: Water of
Burrage, Cichore, and Bugloss, of either two ounces.

Mix them together and give the sick one half thereof in the morning, and the
rest at night, and cause him oftentimes to lick of this mixture following.

Take the conserves of Nenuphare, Violets, and Burrage, of either six drachms:
Manus Christi made with Perles, four drachms: Sirrup of Nenuphare and Ribes, of
either one ounce and half.

Mix them together: and with a Licorice stick clean scraped, and a little
bruised in the end, let the sick lick thereof.

CHAP. V. Shows what is to be done when the Pox are all come out in the
skin.
FOr that oftentimes the face and hands, which is the beauty and delight of our
bodies, are oftentimes disfigured thereby, I will show you what means I have
used with good and happy success for preventing thereof: which is, you may not
do any thing unto them until they grow white, and that they are come to
maturation, which when you perceive, then with a golden pin, or needle, or
for lack thereof a copper pin will serve, do you open every pustulae in the
top, and so thrust out the matter therein very softly and gently with a soft
linen cloth, and if you perceive the places do fill again, then open them
again as you did first, for if you do suffer the matter which is in them to
remain over long, then will it fret and corrode the flesh, which is the cause
of those pitts which remain after the Pox are gone, as Avicen witnesses: now
when you have thus done, then anoint the places with this ointment following.

Take Elder leaves, one handful, Marigolds, two handfulls, French Mallows,
one handful, Barrowes morte or grease, six ounces.

First bruise the herb in a mortar, and then boil them with the grease in a
pewter dish on a chafer and coals, until the juice of the herbs be consumed,
then strein it, and keep it to your use, the best time to make it is in the
middle or the latter end of May.

You must with a feather anoint the places grieved, and as it dries in,
anoint it again, and so continue it oftentimes, for this will soon dry them
up, and keep the place from pitts and holes, which remain after the Pox are
gone.

Also if you anoint the Pox with the oil of sweet Almonds newly drawn three
or four times a day, which you must begin to do so soon as the Pox are grown
white and come to maturation, it will cure them without pitts or spotts, and
eases the pain and burning, and helps excoriation.

Some do only oftentimes wet the places with the juice of Marigolds in the
summer season, and in winter the juice of the roots will serve: and by that
only have done well.

Mercuriales does greatly commend this decoction following to be used after the
Pustulaes are opened.

Take Barley, one little handful, red Roses, a handful, red Sanders, white
Sanders, of either one ounce: Saffron, two scruples, Salt, four drachms, Clean
water, three pound.

Boil all together until a third part be consumed, you must oftentimes touch
the sores therewith, with a fine cloth wet therein, and as it dries in, wet it
again, this in a short time will dry them up.

I have heard of some, which having not used any thing at all, but suffering
them to dry up and fall off themselves without any picking or scratching, have
done very well, and not an^ pitts remained after it.

When the Pox, after they come out, do not grow to maturation, how you shall
help it.
Sometimes you shall find that it will be a long time before those pustulaes
will come to maturation, or grow white: now here you must help nature to bring
it to pass, which you may well do with this decoction.

Take Mallows, one handful, Figgs, twelve in number, Water, a quart.

Cut the Figgs small, and boil altogether, until half and more be consumed,
and then wet a fine soft linen cloth therein, and touch the place therewith
oftentimes, which will soon bring them to maturation, and also ease the pain,
if any be.

Vlceration, to help it.
If in the declining of the Pox they chance to grow unto Ulcerations, which is
oftentimes seen: then for the curing thereof use this order here following.

Take Tamarinds, leaves of ^entils, Mirtils, budds of oaken leaves, red Roses
dried, of either all the handful.

Boil all these in a pottle of clean water until half be consumed, then
strein it, and with a fine cloth wet therein do you wash and soak the place
well, then wipe it dry with a soft and fine linen cloth, and then cast into
the place some of this powder following.

Take Frankincense, Mastick, Sarcocoll, and red Roses, of either two drachms.

Make all these into fine powder severally by themselves, then mix them
together, and so reserve it to thy use.

A very good unguent for the same purpose
Take oil of Roses, vi. ounces, white Wax, one ounce, Ceruse washed in Rose and
Plantaine-water, one ounce and half, clear Turpentine, iii. drachms, Camphire,
half a dram.

You must first melt the wax in the oil, then put in the Ceruse by little and
little, always stirring it with an iron spalter, and let it boil on a gentle
fire of charcoles until it grow black, but stir it continually in the
boiling, for fear least i^ burn: then take it from the fire, and add thereto
the camphire, and lastly the Turpentine: this unguent is good both to mundifie,
incarnate, and sigillate.

For extreme heat and burning in the souls of the feet, and palms of the hands.
Petrus Forestus wills to hold the hands and feet in warm water, and that
will ease the pain and burning, and may boldly be used without any danger.

For to help the soreness and ulceration of the mouth
Sometime it chances in this disease, that there is a great u^ceration or
excoriation in the mouth and jaws, called Ap^ham which if it be not well
looked unto in time, will grow to be Cankers,: now to cure and prevent the
same, this gargarisme is excellent good.

Take Barley-water, a quart, red Roses dried, a little handful, Sumach, and
Rybes, of either two ounces, juice of Po^granates,. iii.

Boil them altogether, saving the juice of Pomegranate^, until a third part
be consumed, then strein it, and add thereto the juice of Pomegranates, with
this you must often wash and gargarise, as also hold some thereof in the mouth
a pretty while.

Also to prevent the same, the kernel of a (...) held in the mouth is very
good, and so it is excellent good to lick oftentimes some Diamoron, or juice of
a Pomegranate.

For inflammation and pain in the tonsils and throat.
Take Plantaine-water, a pint, Sirrup of Pomegranates, two ounces.

Mix them together, and gargarise therewith oftentimes being warm.

Another.
Taste Nightshade-water, a pint, Seeds of Quinces, four scruples.

Boil them together a little, then strein it, and add thereto two ounces of
the sirrup of Pomegranates, and gargarise therewith oftentimes.

How to open the eyelids that are fastened together with the Pox.
Sometimes the eyelids are so fastened together that you cannot open them
without great pain and danger: then to open them you must foment or bath them
well with a decoction made of Quince seed, Mallows and water boiled together,
wherein wet some fine linen clothes five or six double, and apply them warm,
and continue it until you may easily open them, and then if you perceive any
web or filme to be grown over the sight, then thrice a day do you put some
powder of white sugar candy into the eye, or if you list, you may dissolve the
sugar in Rose Water, and so use it in the eye, which will fret it away, and
preserve the sight.

A good Collery for a Web or Vngula in the eye.
Take the juice of Rue, Fennel, Salendine, Mallows, of either two ounces.

Boil them together in a vessel of glass, or peuter, over a chafer with
coals, and scumme away the froth that does rise thereof, then add thereto the
gaul of an Eel, one dram, and let them boil together a little, then put
thereto four scruples of white copperas, and one scruple of verdigreace in fine
powder, boil all together a little, then let it run through a fine linen
cloth, and keep it in a glass, you must every morning and evening put one drop
thereof into the eye, provided that first due evacuation be made so well by
phlebotomie as purging.

CHAP VI. Teaches how to help diverse accidents which chance after the Pox are
cured and gone. For redness of the face and hands after the Pox are gone, how
to help it.
TAke Barley, Beans, Lupins, of either one handful: bruise them all in a
mortar grosely, and boil them in three pints of water until it grow thick
like a jelly, then strain it, and anoint the face and hands therewith three
or four times a day, for three or four days together, and then you must wet
the face and hands so oftentimes a day with this water following.

Take Vine leaves, two handfuls: Beane-flower, Dragons, wilde-tansey, of either
one handful: Camphire three drachms, two Calves feet, the pulpe of three
Lemons, a pint of raw cream.

You must shred the herbs small, as also the Lemons, and break and cut the
Calves-feet small, then mix them together, and distill it in a glass still,
also the water of May-dew is excellent good for any high color, or redness of
the face.

For spots in the face remaining when the Pox are gone.
Take the juice of Lemons and mix it with a little bay salt, and touch the
spots therewith oftentimes in the day; for it is excellent good.

A good ointment for the same purpose.
Take oil of sweet Almonds; oil of white Lillies, of either one ounce:
Capons-grease, Goats-tallow, of either four drachms: Sarcocoll, half a dram:
Flower of Rice, and of Lupins, of either one dram: Litharge of gold, one
dram and half: Roots of Brionie, and of Ireos, of either one scruple:
Sugar Candy white, one dram.

Make powder of all those that may be brought into powder, and searce them
through a searce, then put them all in a mortar together, and labor them with
a pestle, and in the working do you put the water of Roses, Beane-flower, and
of white Lillies ana a great spoonful, which must be put in by little and
little in the working of it, and so labor them altogether until it come to an
unguent.

You must every evening anoint the face therewith, or hands, and in the
morning wash it away in the water wherein Barley, Wheaten-bran, and the seed of
Mallows has been boiled.

For holes remaining when the small Pox are gone.
For helping of this accident I have showed many things, yet never could find
any thing that did perfectly content me, but the best means that I have tried,
is one day to wash the place with the distilled water of strong Vinegar, and
the next day with the water wherein Bran and Mallows have been boiled, and
continue this order twenty days, for a month together.

Running of the ears, how to help it.
Sometimes the ears do run very much in this disease, which in any wise you
may not go about to stop in the beginning, but suffer it so to run, and the
ears to remain open: but if there be great pain in them, then wet a sponge in
warm water and oil of Roses mixed together, and lay it upon the ears.

For stopping of the nostrills, to help it.
Sometimes the nostrills are greatly pestered by stopping them with the Pox
growing in them, which does oftentimes cause ulceration in them, therefore to
prevent the same, take red-Rose, and Plantaine, of either one handful: Mirrh
in powder half an ounce.

Boil all these in a quart of water until half be consumed, and so being
warm, cause the sick to draw the fume thereof into his nostrills oftentimes.

Also if the sick does oftentimes smell unto Vinegar, it is good.

For hoarsenesse remaining when the Pox are gone.
Take Licorice, Sebesten, Jujubes, of either two ounces* Fat-Figgs, four
ounces, clean water, four pints.

Boil all these together until half be consumed, then strain it, and give one
spoonful thereof to the sick oftentimes, and it helps.

For filthy and moist scabs after the Pox are gone.
Take Lapis calaminaris, Litharge of gold, and of silver of either two drachms:
Quick br^mstone and Ceruse, ana ii.

Bring all these into fine powder, and then labor them in a mortar with so
much Barrowes-mort or grease as shall be sufficient to make up an unguent, and
anoint the place therewith every morning and evening.

FINIS.
Some other few additionall observations concerning the passages in this latter
Treatise.
PAge the eighth of this precedent Book, a Quilt or Bag is commended to be very
excellent; it is reported to be Pope Adrians Bag, which he used against
infection, and in the great last Sickness in London, it was commended to many
great Persons of worth by some Apothecaries, who kept it as a great secret, and
affirmed, it would prevent infection, and preserve them safe in that dangerous
time; and thereupon sold it unto them at a very great rate: But that you may
not be deluded in the prescription, I have set down the true receipt thereof, as
it was delivered unto me from the hands of a very noble friend.

A Preservative against the infection of the air, and the Plague, often
approved by Pope Adrian, and many others of great rank and credit.
Take Arsenick two ounces, Auripigmentum one ounce, make little tablets thereof
with the whites of Eggs, and Gum Dr^^gacanth, and hang them about the neck
against the heart.

I have also set down a red Cordial water, very good against infection, which
I had also from that noble friend.
Take a quart of good spirit of Wine, or very good Aqua vitae, infuse it in one
ounce of good Mithridate, with as much good Venice Triacle: let it be close
stopped some few days in the infusion before you use it, then pour the spirit
clear off, and reserve it for your use.

But to discover what opinions other Physicians have held of that and the like,
I have annexed hereunto their several judgments hereafter, that amongst so
many choice Medicines, they may select out the best and safest for their own
preservations, when need shall require.

And to give them the better satisfaction, I have annexed, out of some choice
Manuscripts, some approved Experiments, of some of our London ablest Doctors,
as also out of some other Authors.

Several opinions against wearing of Arsenick Amulets, as Preservatives
against the Plague.
THe poisonous vapors of Arsenick being sucked or drawn into the body, when
they find no contrary poison with whom to wrestle with, as with an enemy, (for
in an infected body there cannot be health; but we suppose him to be well, whom
we desire to preserve so) those vapors must needs imprint a malignant and
venomous quality on the spirit and heart, most adverse and pernicious to nature.

And by Galens own doctrine, all Alexiteries do in a manner, if they be used
too liberally, greatly offend and weaken our bodies; how can we then think,
that rank Poisons and Dilaetories, (such us Arsenick is) being applied, as to
penetrate into the noblest region of all other, will no whit violate and wast
our natural, vital, and radical heat? Galen libr. de ^mp. cap. 18.

Nor did Galen, or any of the ancient Fathers and Professors of Physic, use to
preserve from the Plague, or any other poison, by administering some other
poison inwardly, or prescribing outwardly Applications, but proceeded by
Antidotes, and Alexiteries, as will appear in libr. de Theriaca ad Pis. cap,
16. Wherefore, unless we will utterly disclaim or relinguish the method and
prescripts of these worthy Ancients, and prosecute new ways and inventions, to
oppose this man-yelling Monster, we must attempt it not with Poisons but
Antidotes. And Galen defines those to be Poisons, which agree not with nature,
either well or ill affected at any time; for though there are some Poisons,
which if they meet in the body with a contrary venom, so fight with it, and
oppose it, that both do perish in the conflict betwixt them; so that the
party, by their colluctation and struggling together, escapes with his life: yet
all of them agree in uniform opinion together, that where they meet with no
opposition, they ruin the party: And therefore conclude, that Arsenick, worn
by a healthy man, finding not only no contrary Poison to make conflict with,
but no Poison at all, must necessarily thwart, and oppose, and make an onset on
nature her self.

And to confirm their opinions, I have purposely introduced the judgments of
other learned Physicians concurring with them.

Gerardus Columbus, a learned Physician, reports, that it has been observed,
that the wearers of these Amulets, upon unusual heating their bodies, have
fallen into sudden Lipothimies, and Swounings, with other fearful accidents,
which continued upon them till the Amulets or Placents were removed from them;
and that others, though not instantly, yet after some time, have by late and
woeful experience discovered their malignity, by falling into malignant and
pestilent Fevers, some of them ending with death.

Franc. Alphanus, a Physician of Salerne, relates of one, who wearing
Arsenick, and heating himself with playing earnestly at Tennise, fell down
suddenly dead.

Mattheus Hessus also thus writes, As Cordial Bags or Amulets ought not to be
disavowed, so empoysoned Amulets can be no way commended; nor do I remember,
that ever any received good from them, who abstained from other Antidotes: But
this I certainly know, that diverse persons, who carry about them Quicksilver
in a Nutshell, by the vain persuasions of some Imposters, have died of the
Plague, and the counselors and advisers of such like Amulets, have been the
first have betaken themselves to their heels, confiding more in their running
than cunning: and yet these Quacks persuaded the ignorant people, with glorious
promises and protestations, that whosoever carried Quicksilver or Arsenick
about his neck, should be as safe, as if he had purchased a protection from the
King of Heaven

Historians also report, that Caracalla, though he were a wicked Emperor,
prohibited by public Edict or Proclamation, that no man should wear about him
superstitious Amulets.

And Theophrastus the great (not without cause) esteemed Pericles to have a
crazed brain, because he saw him wear an Amulet about his neck.

And hereunto Doctor Francis Herring, an able Physician, as a Corollary to what
has before been written, adds the experience of some London Physicians, who
report, they have seen foul holes made in the breasts of those that have worn
those Amulets, and have observed diverse to die, who have religiously worn them
about their necks, as well as others.

And whereas the venters and setters out of these deceitful wares, make them
as a scout, to discover the infection when it begins to seize on a man, by
clapping close to the heart, to guard that principal part, as the chief Tower:
It is a mere deceit and collusion: for whenever the body is heated, this
event follows necessarily, though no other infection be near, but the
poisonous and venomous Arsenick it self, whose salutation is rather Joabs
embracing, or Juda's kissing, than friendly preservatives.

Causes of the Plague.
There are two special causes of the Plague.

First, An infected, corrupted, and putrified air,

Secondly, Evil and corrupt humors ingendered in the body.

The air is infected, when the temperatenesse of the air is changed from his
natural state, to excessive heat and moisture, which is the worst temperament
of the air, the vapors drawn up by the heat of the Sun being unconsumed, rot,
putrify, and corrupt, and so with the venom infect the air: Also dead
Carkases lying unburied, as it often chances in Wars, evaporations of
Pooles, Fens, Marshes, stinking and noisome sents and Kennels, and Astronomers
say, Aspects, Conjunctions and Oppositions of ill Planets, and Eclipses of the
Sun and Moon.

Also disordering ones self, either in diet or exercises brings one into the
Pestilence; therefore in time of contagion, outrages and surfets are to be
avoided, as also all excess of eating, drinking, sweating, bathing, lechery,
and all other things that open the pores of the body, and enter thereby ill
aires, which invenome the lively spirits.

Signs of the Plague.
The signs which declare one infected already are many; but the secret token
of all to know the infected of the Plague is, if there arise botches behind the
ears, or under the armeholes, or about the share; or if Carbunkles suddenly
arise in any member, for when they appear, they betoken strength of nature,
which being strong, labors to drive the poison out of the body; but if
botches do not appear, it is more dangerous, for it shows, that nature is
weak and feeble, and not able to expel and thrust forth the venomous humors,
and then you must have respect to the signs before rehearsed.

The infection of the Plague enters into a man after this sort.
In a man are three principal parts (that is) the Heart, Liver, and Brains,
and each of these has his cleansing place: If they appear in the neck, they
show the Brains to be chiefly vexed, if under the arme-holes the Heart, but if
they appear in the share, the Liver is most infected,

For when a man has taken infection, it presently mingleth with the blood, and
runs to the heart, which is the chief part of man, and the heart puts the
venom to his cleansing place, which is the arme-holes; and that being stopped,
puts it to the next principal part, which is the liver, and it passes it
to his cleansing place, which is the share, and they being stopped, pass it to
the next principal place, that is, the brains, and to their cleansing places,
which are under the ears, or under the throat, and they being stopped, suffer
it not to pass out, and then it is moved twelve hours before it rest in any
place, and if it be not let out within the space of four and twenty hours by
bleeding, it brings a man into a pestilentiall Ague, and causes a botch in one
of those three places, or near unto them

The Cure of the Plague.
When thou feel thy self infected, bleed in the first hour, or within six
hours after, drink not, and tarry not above twelve hours from bleeding, for
then when the blood is flitting too and fro, the venom is then moving, and not
yet settled, and after it will be too late; those that are fat may be let blood,
or else not.

If the matter be gathered under the arme-holes, it comes from the heart by the
Cardiacall vein, then bleed on the same side by the Basilica vein, the
innermost vein of the arm,

If the botch appear behind the ears, above the chin, or in any other part of
the face or neck, bleed out of the Cephalica vein on the same side; you may
bleed with cupping Glasses, and Scarification, or Horseleeches.

If the botch appear in the share, bleed in the ankle on the same side, in any
case not in the arm, for it will draw up the matter again.

But if no botch appear outwardly, draw blood out of that side where you feel
greatest pain and heaviness, and out of that vein, the grief of the members
affected shall point thee out.

If you perceive the Plague invade you at meat, or on a full stomach, vomit
speedily, and when your Stomach is empty, take some Medicine that may resist
Poison, as Mithridate, or Triacle, or some of these following, which, as choice
Medicines, I have inserted, as being Doctor Edwards Experiments.

For the Plague.
Infuse two pieces of fine pure Gold in the juice of Lemons four and twenty
hours, and drink that juice with a little Wine, with powder of the Angelica
root: It is admirable, and has helped diverse past all hope of cure.

Another.
Take two drachms of Juniper berries, of Terra lemnia i. make both into fine
powder, and mix it with Honey, and take of it as much as a hasell Nut in three
drachms of honeyed water made up thus: Take a pint of Honey, and of water eight
pints, sees and scum it at an easy fire, till the fourth part be wasted: It
is an excellent Antidote against Poison and Plague; if the Poison be taken
before, it will expel it by vomit, if not, the Medicine will stay in the
stomach.

Another.
Take Zedoary roots the best you can get, great Raisins, and Licorice, champ it
with thy teeth and swallow it, if you be infected it preserves without danger.

Another for botches, boyls, and tokens.
Take of ripe Ivy berries dried in the shade, as much of the powder as will lie
upon a groat or more, and put it into three or four ounces of white Wine, and
lie in bed and sweat well; after your sweat is over, change shirt, and sheets,
and all the bed clothes if he may, if not, yet change his shirt and sheets.

Some have taken this powder over night, and found themselves well in the
morning, and walked about the house fully cured.

One having a Plague sore under the thigh, another under the left arme-pit,
taking this powder in the morning, and again that night, the sores brake of
themselves, by this excellent Medicine sent by Almighty God: It is good for
Botches, Boyles, Plague-sores, Tokens, Shingles, Erisipella, and such like, etc.

Thus far Doctor Edwards Doctor in Physic and Surgery.
Experiments tried by my self.
For the Plague.
TAke of Pillulae pestilentiales, called Ruffi, or of Panohy Magogon (or for
want of it) of extraction Rudii, of each half a dram, mingle these, into six
pills for two doses, whereof take three at a time in the morning fasting, for
two days together.

Another excellent approved Remedy.
Take eight or nine grains of Aurum vitae, either in Tri^^e water, or made up
in Diascordium, fasting.

Another excellent sweating powder for the Plague.
Take of the powder e Chelis Cancrerum, of Aromaticum rosatum, and of Cerusa
Antimonii, of each half a scruple, mingle these up together in a diaphoretick
powder, and take it in four spoonfuls of Triacle water well mingled together.

The Cure of Diseases in Remote Regions.
The Calenture,
Happens to our Nation in intemperate Climates, by Inflammation of blood, and
proceeds often of immoderate drinking of wine, and eating of pleasant fruits,
which are such nourishers thereof, as they prevent the means used in curing
the same.

To know the Calenture.
At the first apprehension it afflicts the Patient with great pain in the head,
and heat in the body, which is continual or increasing, and does not diminish
and angment, as other Fevers do; and is often an Introduction to the Taberdilla
or Pestilence, but then the body will seem very yellow.

To cure the Calenture.
So soon as you perceive the Patient possessed of the Calenture, (except the
Surgeon, for danger of the sign defer it) I have seen the time of the day
not respected, open the Median vein of the right arm, and take such quantity of
blood, as agrees with the ability of the body; but if it assuage not the heat
by the next day, open the same vein in the left arm, and take so much more
like quantity of blood at his discretion; and if the body be costive, (as
commonly they are) give him some meet purgation, and suffer him to drink no
other then water cold, wherein Barley and Annise-seeds have been boiled with
bruised Liquorice. And if within 4. days the party amend not, or being
recovered, take it again, open the vein Cephalic in one or both hands, bathing
them in warm water, until there come so much more blood as cause requires.
Suffer not the Patient to drink seven days after he is perfectly recovered,
any other drink, then such water, as is before herein directed.

The Taberdilla,
IS a disease so called by the Spaniards, by the Mexicans, Cocalista, and by
other Indians is named Taberdet, and is so exceeding pestilent and infectious,
that whole Kingdoms in both the India's have been depopulated by it, for want
of knowledge to redress themselves of it.

To know the Taberdilla.
It first assaults the Patient vehemently with pain in the head and back: and
the body seeming yellow, is some sign thereof, and within 24 hours it is so
torturous, that the possessed thereof cannot rest or sleep, turning himself on
either side, back or belly, burning in his back most extremely. And when it
grows to perfection, there will appear red and blue spots upon the Patients
breast and wrists. And such persons as have not presently requisite means
applied to them to prevent it, will be, by the vehement torment thereof,
deprived of their wits, and many to cease their pain by loss of their lives
have despairingly slain, and drowned themselves.

The Cure of the Taberdilla.
When you perceive it afflict the Patient, permit him not to lie very warm, nor
upon feathers (for of what quality soever he be in Spain, having this sickness
he is laid upon wheat-straw:) Then immediately open the Median Vein, first in
one arm, and the next day in the other, taking a good quantity of blood: Let
him have water cold, wherein Barlie and Annise-seeds have been sodden without
Liquorice (for the Spanish Physicians hold Liquorice to be hurtful unto them)
so much as he will desire, which will be every moment; but no other drink, nor
any raw fruits: As Soon as the spots appear, give him some Cordial potion: and
laying him upon his belly, set six Ventoses together on his back, between and
beneath the shoulders; and scarifying them, draw out (if it be a body of strong
constitution) 18 ounces of blood. After which, and that he has slept, he will
find ease within twenty four hours, and such alteration in himself, as he will
think he is delivered of a most strange torment. Then give him moderately
nourishing meats, (for he will desire to eat much) the fourth day, give him
some convenient Purgations. And if in the mean while he is costive, provoke him
every day by Clisters; and warn him to forbear 15 days all other drink then
what is ordained: And be very careful of his diet, for if this Taberdilla,
which we call here in England Gods Tokens, come again unto the Patient, he can
hardly escape it. And it is no less Infectious, then the usual English Plague.

The Espinlas
IS a strange sickness, usual in those parts to such as take cold in their
Breasts, after great heat or travel. It comes most times to those that lie
with their breasts upon the ground (especially) in the night.

To know the Espinlas.
The Party having it, will be giddie in the head, and have pain and pricking at
his breast, as with many thorns; from whence I think it is called, for Espina
in Spanish signifies a thorn; and there will be upon the Focell, being the
upper bone of his arm, a hand breadth above the wrist, a little kernel by the
which it is certainly known: He that has this disease, will have appetite
neither to meat, nor drink, nor can digest meat, though he be invited and
moved to take it.

To cure the Espinlas.
The Espinlas appearing by the former signs, take presently oil Olives, and
therewith chase the kernel upon the Patients arm, using so to do twice every
day, until it be dissolved; and laying oil likewise upon his breast, stroke
it upward somewhat hard with the hand; then spread fine flax upon it and the
kernel, making it fast with a rowler, and within two or three days the
diseased will be recovered thereof, whereas else it is very dangerous to
deprive them of life.

Camera de Sangre.
LAxativeness, or Bloody Flux, proceed in those parts of diverse causes: As by
eating Grapes, Oranges, Limons, Melons, Plantains, and especially a great fruit
growing in the West Indies called Pina, like a Pineapple, but bigger then four
of the greatest which I have seen, which the Spaniars hold for the most
delicate fruit that is there, and many other fruits. Also by sudden cold, or
sitting (being very hot) upon a cold stone, or being hot by drinking water
abundantly. And also eating of Butter, Oil, and Fish is so hurtful to the
parties that have it, that they must refrain to eat thereof, and whatsoever
else, that may engender any slimie substance in the Intrals.

The Cure of the Bloody Flux.
There is more possibility of cure, by how much more expedition the medicine is
ministered: and detracting it, the Patients often die suddenly, without feeling
much grief. For speedy and assured remedy, the Patients body must be cleansed
of the sliminess, engendered in the passages of the nutriments, before any
sustenance can remain in his body. To that purpose purge him in the morning,
with half a pint of white wine cold, wherein half an ounce of Rubard being
small cut has been sodden, putting some Sugar Candy to it, to sweeten it, and
immediately after he has so purged, keep at his navell Rosemary sod in strong
Vinegar, applied in the morning and evening very hot, until it be stayed;
giving him often Quinces bruised, and rouled in Marmalade like Pills, which he
should swallow whole, and none of the fruits or meats before recited, nor any
more white wine, but red wine of any sort: And if it be one the land use the
Livers of Goats, (especially) Sheeps, or Bullocks roasted; not willingly
permitting the Patient to eat any other meat: And if at Sea, Rice only sodden
in water, rather then any thing else usual there, until the infirmity be
perfectly assuaged.

The Erisipela,
Reigns much in those Countries, proceeding from the unwholesome aires and
vapors those hot Countries do yield, whereof many perish; and if it be not
prevented by Medicines presently ministered to the Sick Patients, it proves
incurable.

To know the Erisipela.
He will be swollen in the face, or some part of him, and it will be of yellow
color mixed with red. And when it is pressed with the finger, there will
remain a sign or dint of the same, and then by degrees it will fill again to
the former proportion. It speedily infecteth the inward parts, because such
swellings come sooner unto perfection in hot places, then in temperat
Countries, and therefore the diseased thereof, must immediately be provided of
remedy.

To Cure the Erisipela.
The Savage people first found out perfectly how to cure this disease, (though
it is the Spanish name of the Malady) by bruising so much Tobacco as will
yield four spoonfuls of juice, and to drink it presently after they are
infected therewith, and to lance the places swollen, thereunto putting Casade
wet, and made into paste, continuing in cold and shadie places near Rivers: and
not to travel and labor till they be recovered: The Spaniards in India do
recover themselves by taking the same juice of Tobacco, and setting so many
Ventoses upon the swollen places as they can contain, scarifying them, and
drawing out the corrupted humor so congealed, using the like in two or three
other parts of the body, where the disease does not appear.

The juice of Tobacco is very excellent to expel poison, and is the ordinary
remedy used by the Indians, and other Savages when they are poisoned, and
bitten with Scorpions, or other venomous creatures: But they make presently
some incision where they are bitten or stung, and wash it with the juice of
Tobacco, then applying the same bruised thereunto two or three days, they heal
it up with dried Tobacco.

The Tinoso or Scurvie.
IS an infecting disease sufficiently known unto Sea-fayring men, who by
putrified meats, and corrupted drinks, eating Biscuit flourie, or foul crusted,
and wearing wet apparel (especially sleeping in it) and slothful demeanor,
or by gross a humors contained in their bodies get the same,

To know the Scurvie.
Many have perished when they returned out of hot Regions into cold Climates,
where they have had the parts of their bodies, which with heat, were nimble and
tractable to every motion of the Spirits, dulled and benumbed with cold, which
is a token that this disease is ingendring in their joints; and soonest appears
by swelling of their ankles, and knees, and blackness of their gums, or
looseness of their teeth, which will sometimes come forth, when there is no
remedy used in season.

Preservatives against the Scurvy.
You must have a care to preserve those things before rehearsed well
conditioned, the badnesse whereof, in part breed this disease; they must use
exercise of body, and such as are exempted from doing of labor, must hang or
swing by the arms twice or thrice every day; they must not have scarcity of
drink in hot climates, and coming into the cold, must be daily releeved with
Aqua vitae or Wine: It is also an assured Medicine against this disease, to
have such quantity of Beer brewed with grains and long Pepper, as in the
morning, twice every week, there may be given a good draught to a man,
proportioning three quarters of a pound of grains, and three quarters of a
pound of long Pepper, to a Hogshead of Beer: Also white Wine, or Syder, boiled
and brewed with grains and long Pepper in like quantity, is very singular
good: And it is not fit to suffer the gummes to abound with flesh, and
therefore sometimes let them bleed, and clear them with strong Vinegar.

To cure the Scurvy.
If the Scurvy be settled in his mouth, the corrupted and black flesh must be
taken away, and his mouth washed with strong Vinegar, wherein grains and long
Pepper have been infused and brewed, and give him daily the drink that is
before prescribed; and as well such as have it in their mouths, as those that
are swollen in their limbs, must have some meet Purgation presently; but those so
swollen or stiff (for so some will be without swelling) to scarifie the parts
infected, and to apply thereto a Poultis or Cataplasme of Barley meal, more hot
than the Patient will willingly suffer it; so doing every morning, permit him
not to rest two hours after, although being nummed or faint, he be supported
to walk, and suffer him not to eat any salt meats, if other meats may be had.

My self having eighty men, eight hundred leagues out of England, sick of the
Scurvy, I used scarifiing, and to the places scarified (being destitute of the
helps mentioned) I applied Poultisses of Biscuit beaten in a mortar, and sod in
water, which, with the comfort of some fresh meats obtained, recovered them all
except one person, and they arrived in England, perfectly sound.

Other Observations concerning the Scurvy taken out of other Books.
1. THose that are troubled with the Scurvy, their thighs are stained with a
violet color, that one would think, that something of that color were spread

party drink every third day for a sevennight in the morning in his bed half a
pint of new Milk, of a red or black Cow.

For the Gout, My Lord Denni's Medicine.
Take Burdocks leaves and stalks, cut them small, and stamp them very small,
then strain them, and cleanse them, and when you have so done put them into
glasses, and put pure oil of Olives a top of them, and stop it close from the
air, and when you would use it for the Gout, pour it into a porrenger and warm
it, and wet linen clothes in it, and apply it warm to the greived place,
warming your clothes one after another, as they grow cold that are on.

Another, very good for the Gout.
Take the Yest of Ale, and spread it upon brown paper, and apply it upon the
greived place pretty warm, the space of twelve hours: some first warm the
pickle of Olives, and then bath the greived place therewith, putting their feet
into it, and after use the former Medicine.

My Lord Denni's Medicine must not be taken till three days after the change
of the Moon, then after it must be taken six days together, then six days
before the full it must be taken twice a day.

To stay the Courses when they come down too violently.
Take half a dram or a dram of Diascordium, dissolve it in a dram of
posset Ale, wherein formerly has been boiled half a handful of Shepherds
purse, and as much knotgrasse, and of the greater Comfrey, and drink thereof a
good draught at a time morning and evening.

For the Whites.
Take a quarter of a handful of white Archangell, Plantain, Sheaphards purse,
and of the greater Comfrey, of each half a handful, of the herbs Horse-taile,
and Cats-taile, of each half a handful, boil all these in two quarts of Milk
till half be consumed away, then strain it, and sweeten it with good white
Sugar Candy finely beaten, and drink of it twice a day for ten or fifteen days
together.

To keep the body soluble, and to purify the blood.
Take Maydenhair, wild Germander, wood-Sorrell, and Balm, of each a pugill, of
wild Mercury half a handful, of damask Roses two handfuls, of clarified Whey
six pints, let it stand scalding hot for an hour stirring it sometimes, after
an hour is past strain it, and drink it twice or thrice a day a good draught of
it; and if you wash your hands in Beef broth after your taking it, it will take
away all roughness and hairs of the hands, it may be taken safe of a woman
with child

For the green Sickness, or yellow Jaundies.
For cure hereof first purge universally with this or the like purgation.. of
Hiera picra four scruples, of Rubarb, and Trochisces of Agarick, of each half a
dram, of rasped Ivory, and Hartshorn, of each half a scruple, of Cinnamon six
grains, of Saffron four grains, of Diacatholicon half an ounce; infuse these
things in the Whey of Cows Milk, or in the distilled water of Alkakengie, or in
Dodder water, or Endive water, you may add Oxymell thereto.

An Electuary for the green Sickness.

Diacurcuma, and confection of Alkermes, of each half an ounce, of Diamargariton
frigidum, and Calidum, of each two drachms, of rasped Ivory, and Hartshorn, of
each one dram, of all these make an Electuary, and give it evening and
morning by it self, or with Dodder or Endive water, the dose is one dram, pro
tempore uno.

An excellent Powder for the green Sickness.
. four scruple of Gentian made into fine powder, of rasped Ivory, and
Hartshorn, of each two scruples; make these into a fine powder, and give a
spoonful thereof with white Wine, or the like, at once.

Another Medicine.
. Three or four spoonfuls of flemish Madder, boil it in two quarts of white
Wine, with a piece of Sugar, to the consumption of half of it, strain it, and
let the Maiden drink thereof morning and evening a good draught warm, and walk,
or use some exercise to heat the body, but take no cold; use this for eleven or
twelve days together.

A singular purging Potion against the green Sickness, and all opilations of
the Liver, and causes young Maids to look fresh, and fair, and cherry-cheek'd,
and will bring down their Courses, the stopping whereof causes this grief, and
it is good against all manner of itch, scabs, breaking out, and manganesse of
the body, purifying the blood from all corruption.
. Of the roots of Monks Rubarb, that is red Dock, and of red Madder, ana. half
a pound, of Sena four ounces, of Anniseseed, and Licorice, of each two ounces,
of Scabious, and Agrimony, of each one handful; slice the roots of Rubarb, and
bruise the Anniseseed and Licorice, break the herbs small, and put them all
into a pot with four gallons of strong Ale, and infuse them all the space of
three days, then drink of this drink, for your ordinary drink, for three weeks
at the least, the longer the better, and make new as need requires; it cures
the Dropsy, and yellow Jaundies also, if you put in of Cammomill one handful.

For the green Sickness, or Jaundies.
. Of white Briony root sliced half an ounce, boil it in a pint of Ale gently a
quarter of an hour, and drink a good draught thereof, and sweat, and in your
sweat drink it all, or as much as you can, the next day make new and drink
again, but without sweating, and use some exercise to keep the body warm; use
this last order twelve days together, use good Cordials and Restoratives, with
sirrup and conserve of Fumitory.

For the green Sickness, and Jaundies.
Boil of Rue, and Sage, of each a bundle, in a quart or three pints of Ale,
with one scruple of Saffron.

To cure this disease, the Electuary of Steel is excellent, if the body be
first purged, for it does open all obstructions: but the Patient must use some
exercise after the taking it, to stir up natural heat the better; the dose
is half an ounce at a time to take of it.

The Steel for the Electuary is thus prepared.
. Of the filings of the best Iron, or Steel, as much as you please, grind it
subtly and finely, upon a Porphiry, or red Marble stone, with Vinegar, then
dry it at the Sun, or at the fire, and grind it again with Vinegar as at the
first, and do thus seven times one after another, and thus you have the Steel
prepared fit for you.

The Electuary of Steel is made up thus.
. Of the filings of Steel so prepared half an ounce, Cinnamon, Nutmegs
condited, of each three drachms, of chosen Rubarb two drachms, of the species
of Aromaticum rosatum half a dram, of chosen Honey, and of fine white Sugar,
of each one pound and one ounce; mingle these all together over a soft fire,
and make it up into an Electuary. After the taking of this Electuary, let the
Patient in all cases use some bodily exercises, being first universally purged,
for this Electuary is most excellent against all obstructions of the Liver,
Spleen, or other disease, and for the green Sickness.

For the green Sickness, or green Jaundies.
The green Sickness, or Jaundies comes of yellow choler, mixed with corrupt
or putrified phlegm, and corruption of blood, deb^lity of nature, and faintness
of heart; it happens also when the Liver is weakened that it cannot convert
the nourishment into blood, but the digestion is raw and crude, so that the
whole body is filled with water and phlegm instead of good blood; it is chiefly
found in young Maidens, who desire to abate their flesh colors, and, as they
conceive, to be fine, and fair, and foolishly feed upon trash (which alters
the color and state of their bodies) as of unripe Apples, Pears, Plums,
Cherries, and raw Fruits, and Herbs, or Meal, Wheat, Barley, raw Milk, Chalk,
Lime, and the like, and they that have this disease are very pale and greenish;
if they chance to cut their finger, no blood, but water, will follow; they
feel great pain in their head, with continual beating, are faint,
short-breathed, and their natural Flowers are stopped and stayed, to the
prevention and cure whereof, the body must first be well and orderly purged, as
by the Medicines before prescribed.
