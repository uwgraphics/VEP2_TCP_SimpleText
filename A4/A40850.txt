The Famous Flower of SERVING-MEN; OR, The Lady turned Serving-man,
Her Lover being slain her Father dead,
Her bower robbed, her Servants fled,
She dressed her self in Man's attire,
She trimmed her locks, she cut her hair,
And thereupon she changed her name,
From fair Elise to sweet William.
To a dainty Tu^e, or Flora Farewell, Summer time, or, Loves tide.


YOU beauteous Ladies great and small,
I write unto you one and all,
Whereby that ^ou may understand,
What I have suffered in this land,
I was by birth a Lady fair
My fathers chief and only heir,
But when my good old father died,
Then was I made a young Knights bride.
And then my love built me a bower,
Bedec^t with many a fragrant flower;
A braver bower you never did see,
Then my true love did build for me,
But there came thieves late in the night,
They robbed my bower, and slew my Knight,
And after that my knight was slain,
I could no longer there remain,
My Servants all from me did fly,
In the midst of my extremity:
And left me by my self alone,
With a heart more cold then any stone,
Yet though my heart was full of care,
Heaven would not suffer me to despair,
Wherefore in have I changed my name,
From fair Elise to sweet William,
And there withal I cut my hair,
And dressed my self in man's attire,
My Doublet, Hose, and Bever-hat,
And a golden band about my neck,
With a silver Rapier by my side,
So like a galiant I did ride,
The thing that I delighted on,
Was for to be a Serving-man,
The Second Part,
to the same Tune
Thus in my sumptuous man's array,
I bravely rode along the way:
And at the last it chanced so,
That I unto the Kings Court did go.
Then to the King I bowed full low,
My love and duty for to show:
And so much favor I did crave,
That I a Servingmans place might have.
Stand up brave youth, the King replied,
Thy service shall not be denied:
But tell me first what thou can do,
Thou shall be fitted thereunto.
Will thou be Usher of my Hall,
To wait upon my Nobles all:
Or will thou be taster of my Wine,
To wait on me when I shall dine?
Or will thou be my Chamberlain,
To make my bed both soft and fine?
Or will thou be one of my guard,
And I will give thee thy reward.
Sweet William with a smiling face,
Said to the King, if ^t please your grace,
To show such favor unto me,
Your Chamberlain I fain would be.
The king then did the Nobles call,
To ask the counsel of them all,
Who gave consent sweet William he,
The kings own Chamberlain should be.
Now mark what strange things came to pass,
As the King one day a hunting was
With all his Lords and noble train,
Sweet William did at home remain,
Sweet William had no company then
With him at home bar an old man:
And when he saw the Coast was clear,
He took a Lute which he had there.
Upon the Lute sweet William played,
And to the same he sung and said:
With a pleasant and most noble voice,
Which made the old man to re^oyce.
Sweet William's Song.
MY father was as brave a Lord,
As ever Europe did afford,
My Mother was a Lady bright,
My Husband was a valiant Knight.
And I my self a Lady gay,
Bedeckt with gorgeous rich array,
The bravest Lady in the Land,
Had not more pleasures to command.
I had my music every day,
Harmonious Lessons for to play,
I had my Virgins fair and free,
Continually to wait on me.
But now alas my Husbands dead,
And all my friends are from me fled,
My former joys are past and gone,
For now I am a Serving-man.
The end of sweet Williams Song.
At last the King from hunting came,
And presently upon the same.
He called for the good old man,
And thus to speak the King began.
What news, what news old man, quoth. he^
What news have thou to tell to me,
Brave news the old man he did say,
Sweet William is a Lady gay.
If this be true thou tellest me,
I Will make thee a Lord of high degree,
But if thy words do prove a Lie,
Thou shall be hanged up pr^sently.
But when the King the truth had found,
His joys did more and more abound,
According as the old man did say,
Sweet William was a Lady gay.
Therefore the King without delay,
Put on her glorious rich array:
And upon her head a crown of gold,
Which was most famous to behold.
And then for fear of further strife,
He took sweet William for his wife,
The like before was never seen,
A Serving-man to be a Q^^en.
