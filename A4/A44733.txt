TO THE GROWING GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN, The hopes of our Crown, and the crown
of our Hopes Prince Charles, At his Court in Caesaria, by vulgar contraction
called IERSEY.
SIR,
I Present your Highness with the Life of your Royal Oncle of France, A
successful and triumphant King both at home and abroad throughout the whole
course of his Reign, and that, in so constant a degree, as if Fortune herself
had bin his Companion, and Victory, his Handmayd: They attended Him over the
Alps; They ushered Him over the Pyreneys; They were his Harbingers over the
Rhine, and they brought his horses to drink of the Danube; They were his Pilots
at Sea, and they filled his sails upon the Ocean, where he was incomparably
more powerful then all his Progenitors.

Nor would I adventure to expose thus to the present world, and transmit to
future Ages the Reign of a For* rein King, had not I bin Spectator of diverse of
his exploits (and had occasion also to make my address to his Cardinal;) for
the rest, I have labored to gather as faithful instructions and authentic
notes as I could, and those not upon loose trust or from light persons; The
Relations, which are the ingredients of this Story, were not taken at the
Porters lodge, but above stairs, and most of them from the Counsel Table, and
Courts of Parliament.

This Victorious King began to bear Arms and wear buff, about the same years
that your Highness did, for before he was thirteen, He suppressed in person two
Insurrections in Poitou, and Britany* He quelled diverse more, which at last
turned to his advantage, as we find great trees growing toward their full
consistence, corroborat and take firmer rooting being shaken with tempests, by
the resistance they make: So by debelling so many civil commotions he came to
find his own strength the more, and to be feared as well as beloved of his
Subjects, and a mixture of these two passions make an excellent government; For
though the strongest Citadel of a King be his Peoples love, and their hearts
his best Exchequer, yet it is observed, that Love without Fear commonly turns
to Scorn, and Fear without Love turns into Hatred. In the perusal of this
Royal Story, if Your Highness please to observe the circumstances and grounds of
some intestin broils, You shall find that diverse of them have a near analogy
with these of England, for many grew from discontents, that the great
Convention of the three Estates was discontinued, and that France adhaer'd to
Spanish Counsels, with other resemblances besides; Of these and other kind of
commotions there happened above ten in this Kings Reign: Nor is it any news to
hear that France, has such fits of distemper, or indeed any Country else,
that labors with superfluous humors, I mean that swells with exces of people
and plenty; for as the Natural body when it is too repleat must have some
vent, just so, the Political, must have some Evacuations at home or abroad when
it is too full, and it will thrive the better upon it afterward. If we cast our
eyes upon the great world we shall find restless motions, reluctations and
combatings between the Elements; yet we cannot call this any incongruitie or
disorder in the frame of things, but it tends to the conservation of the whole,
and may be said to keep Nature herself in action and health; That the Earth
trembles, the Sea tumbleth, that the Air is always in agitation, that it is
rent with thunder, coruscations, and other Meteorological impressions; that all
the Elements are in an incessant feud, it is for the Universal good, and to
keep things vigorous, and fresh; So in Man who is the microcosm, the little
world, and made up of elements, there be passions and humors which are in
perpetual reluctance within him, and so break out into tumults, preliations,
and war; And where this war is well grounded, it is wholesome, and the victories
that are acquired thereby, are Decreta Caeli, the Decrees of Heaven, but in an
ill grounded war they are no other then Faelicia Scelera, fortunat villainies:
Moreover, to transcend the Elements, if we mark the course of the heavenly
bodies themselfs, there are cross motions amongst them, they are in perpetual
revolutions and circumgyrations, nay, there are branlings and trepidations
amongst them, (which yet the wisest of Philosophers held to be no other then an
harmonious sound, and sweet regular symphony,) And as the gran Universe runs
thus always round, and carries all bodies after it; So Man, who is part or
rather the Epitome thereof, specially in reference to his actions, may be said
to dance in a circle; For there is not any thing now acted, but may be
paralleled, and exemplified by some Age or other. Therefore among other
excellent fruits of Story this is none of the least, to put one off, from
wondering at any thing, because he meets with precedents and patterns of all
sorts in former times; He that will observe how some of the great Roman Emperors
were content to live in Capreae (a petty Island) how the Princes of Italy fled
to the Lakes of Venice for safety, how some of our Kings to the Isle of Man,
how Charles the seventh had no other town to keep his Court in but Bourges in
Berry, one of the smallest Provinces in all France, which made him called a
good while King of Berry; with a world of such examples, will nothing wonder
that your Highness keeps his Court now at Iersey. Nor is this present Story a
plain downright confused narration of things, for to compile such a work, is
as easy as to make fagots, or to trusse up a bundle of straw; but (besides
other observations and excursions) that which the Author chiefly aims at, is
to make the method of providence in dispensing judgments, and to make a
research of the causes of them de longue main, for they seldom come immediately
one upon another, but many years, and sometimes a whole age intervenes between
the judgment and the cause.

Furthermore, I have bin careful in this Story to vindicat England touching
the circumstance of some traverses of State and War, twixt Her and France,
during this Kings Reign, which are misreported by the French Chroniclers: there
will be other censures found here besides, but this I have done as he that
killed the Serpent upon the child's head without touching his body.

It remains, that I implore your Highne's pardon not for the subject of this
work, because it is rich and royal, but for the form thereof, if it be not
found adaequat to the height of the matter, according to the desires and
endeavors of

Your Highne's most obedient most loyal and most humble servant* From the
prison of the Fleet this Midsommer day 1646. HOVVELL.

Historiae Sacrum.
IMmortal Queen, great Arbitresse of Time,
Bright torch, and Herald of all-conquering Truth,
Which things, years thousands passed kepst in their prime,
And so bear up the world in constant youth,
Making that Morn, Man first was made of clay,
Appear to us as fresh as yesterday:
Rich Magazin of Patterns, that may serve
As spurs to Virtue, or as curbs to Vice,
Which do brave men embalm, and them conserve
Longer then can Arabian gumms or spice,
And of their memory do Mummy make,
More firm then that hot Lybia's sands do cake;
Rare Garden, and rich Orchard, wherein grow
Fame's golden apples, Honor's choicest flowers,
Which twistest ghirlands for the learned brow,
And with thy branches make triumphant bowers,
Inoculat this bud on thy great Tree,
That it may burgeon to Eternity.
I. H.

OF THE LATE FRENCH King and his CARDINAL. The Proem.
I Attempt the life of a potent King, with the sway of a prodigious Favorite,
for there are prodigies in Fortune as well as in Nature; If the exploits of the
one, and the policies of the other were cast into counterballance, I know not
which of the scales would outpoise: Both of them have got high seats in the
Temple of Immortality, and registered their names (though in deep sanguine
characters I confess) in the great book of Fame.

Concerning the first, As I disdain to be a Parasite to my own Prince in any
sordid way of flattery, much more to a forreiner (though living;) so I shall
be very careful not to detract any thing from the honor of this great Prince,
who had inhaerencies enough, and realities of his own, without need of any
forced encomiums, or flourishes of art to render him glorious: And had the
strength of natural parts, and gift of expression been answerable to the
success and bravery of his outward actions; had his (theoricall) knowledge of
virtue been equal to his ignorance of vice, he had been a miracle among
Monarks.

For the second (his plenipotentiary minister) had he been as active for the
universal good and incolumitie of Christendom, as he was for the interests
and safety of his own Country: Or had he been of another coat, and in lieu of
being a Priest, Bishop and Cardinal; had he been Knight, Baron and Marshall, it
had put a far clearer luster (though with less noise) upon his abilities,
which were not common; And he had the opportunity and advantage to show them
upon so high and open a theater, that he made the whole Europaean world his
Spectator: Indeed a sword hangs not handsomely by a Churchmans side, and a
morrion upon a mitre shows illfavouredly: But me thinks I hear this martial
Prelate pass it over, as Pope Julius the second did upon like occasion, who
having had a long feud with the Emperor Frederick (against whom he had fought
twelve battles) and being one day gently admonished by the Archbishop of Ostia
who had consecrated him (and whose peculiar jurisdiction it is to consecrate
all Popes) how S. Peter his first predecessor was commanded to put up his
sword, It Is true said Julius, Our Savior gave the prime Apostle such a
command, but it was after he had given the blow, and cut off Malchus ear.

So this adventrous Cardinal got out his Masters sword to cut off the
excrescencies, and to loppe the luxuriant boughs of that broad-spreading
Austrian Tree, fearing they would extend and shoot out into France; As also to
clip the wings of the Imperial Eagle, who was in a fair way to recover some
of his old feathers, I mean those Hansiatick and other free Towns in
Germany, who had emancipated themselves time out of mind for money, and by
other means from the Empire: But having not finished the work, Both of them
have left the weapon still unsheathed, and dropping pitifully with Christian
blood, and Heaven only knows, when it will be put up again.

Now to proceed more regularly in my intended story, I will begin with the
Monarch, and then fall upon the Minister, it being consentaneous to reason, and
congruous to good manners, that the Master should have prioritie of the
Servant, though I am not ignorant how some mercenary Chroniclers would hoise
the Cap above the Crown; They seem to attribute the success and glory of
things more to the Minister, praising him with greater industry and heat; They
would cut his name in marble, and his Masters but in freestone: By a new
Astronomy they make such a Constellation of him as should give a greater luster
in the French firmament, then the Sun from whence he had derived all his
light: Others go further, and seem to idolatrize him, by calling him the good
Genius and tutelar Angel of his Country, and that he was as necessary for the
government of France, as God Almighty was for the universe: Nay some soar
higher, and by monstrous parasiticall reaches of prophanenes would make the
world believe that the Almighty had imparted unto him some of his own peculiar
attributes, as to make him omniscious, cardiognostick, and to work without the
concurrence of second causes; which made one futilous pamphleter fall into an
egregious bull, while scruing up his wit to hoise him aloft, he called Him the
fourth
person in the Trinity.

Such Scriblers as these are a more sordide sort of Flatterers, then those we
read of, who licked up Dionysius his spittle, and in my judgment are a
scandal to the noble French nation; besides, they rather eclipse then
illustrate his worth; for his very enemies confess, that his merit had matter
enough for modesty her self to work upon without such ridiculous hyperbolies,
and forced transcendencies; For Virtue (whereof there shined in him many
eminent pieces) is of her self so amiable and powerful, that she attracts
all eyes upon her, and extorts praise and admiration from foe as well as
friend. The truth is, that all those years this great minister sat at the
helm, may be termed a time of miracles, by that prodigious course of constant
success matters had abroad and at home, as if he had struck a nail in Fortunes
wheel, that she should not turn all the while.

Yet let me tell you, there wanted not those that writ as satyrically of him,
as others did sycophantically, as will appear in his life; for though his
habit was in grain, yet there were many foul spots cast upon it, insomuch that
the Spaniard, with other nations, thought it would never be fit to make
relics of, because it was so deeply drencht in blood; Nay some of his own
Countrymen, specially the poor face-grounded Peasan, do much doubt whether
he that was so much deified upon earth, will ever be a Saint in Heaven.

But now to the maine design the life of Lewis the thirteenth, and to take him
in all his proportions we will go first to his cradle, and begin with his
nativitie and Dauphinage; Then we will on to his minority or bassage; and
thence to his majoritie and reign, and so our story shall grow up with him in
dimensions and years.

Of his Nativitie and Dauphinage.
LEwis the thirteenth (second French King of the Bourbon line) had for his
father Henry the great, and the great Duke of Toscanies daughter for his
mother; The first we know was sent out of the world by Ravaillac, the second by
Richelieu, as some out of excess of passion do suggest: For this great Queen
having conceived a deep displeasure, and animositie against him, and not liking
his counsels, and course of policy to put quarrels, and kindle a war betwixt
her children, in a high coffeehouse she abandoned France, and so drew a
banishment upon her self, which exposed her to diverse encumbrances, removes
and residences abroad, and this some think accelerated her end: For great
spirits have this of fastness and constancy in them, that where their
indignation is once fixed, for having their counsels crossed, their authority
lessened, and the motions of their souls resisted, they come ofttimes to
break, rather then bow: As we see the huge Cedars, who, scorning to comply,
with the winds and storms, fall more frequently, then the Willow and poor
plying Osier, who yield and crouch to every puff. But to our chief task.

When the sixteenth Christian centurie went out, Lewis the their teenth came
into the world, and he began the seventeenth, being borne in the year sixteen
hundred and one, about the Antumnall Equinoctial, which was held to be a good
presage, that he would prove a good Iusticer: The Queen had a hard delivery,
her body having been distempered by eating of fruit too freely, so that when
the Midwife brought him forth to the King, and to the Princes of the blood in
the next room, who, according to the custom of France, use to be present for
preventing of foul play for an Heir apparent of the Crown, his tender body
was become black and blue with roughness of handling, and the Midwife thinking
to have spouted some wine out of her mouth into his, the King took the bottle
himself, and put it to the Dauphins lips, which revived his spirits. His
public Baptism was not celebrated till five years after at Fontainebleau
because the plague was in Paris, and the solemnity was greater in preparation
and expectance, then it was in performance. The King would have had him named
Charles, but the Mother overrul'd, and gave the law in that point, and would
have him called Lewis. Paul the fifth was his godfather notwithstanding that
the Spanish faction did predominate in the Conclave at his election, which
happened about the time the Dauphin was borne: And the French Ambassador then
at Rome meeting with the Spanish, at Saint Angelo, and telling him Ilmio Re ha
fatto un maschio, my King has made a son: The Spanish Ambassador answered,
and il mio Re ha fatto un Papa, and my King has made a Pope.

It seems that Mercury the father of eloquution, and who has the powerfullest
influence ore the tongue, was oppressed by a disadvantagious conjunction with a
more praedominate planet at his Birth, which appeared by that natural
slownesse he had in his speech, as Lewis the sixth his predecessor (and last
Emperor of the six French Kings) had. But a rare thing it was, and not to be
paralleld in any age, that two of the greatest Kings of Europe, I mean the
Dauphin we now write of, and His Majesty of England now regnant, should come
both into the world within less then ten months compass, the one in
November, the other in September next following; I say a most rare thing it was
that it should so fall out, that as they were contemporaries in years and
reign, the same kind of utterance should be coincident and connaturall to
them both, though the haesitation be less in Him of November: Besides, it
seems he is richly requited with the advantage of an incomparable imperious
pen, wherein nature joining hand with Art, has made him so rich a
compensation, that he may well claim the palm of all his progenitors.

But now again to our Infant Dauphin, which the English with other call
Dolphin commonly, but very corruptly; for it is not from a fish, but a fair
Province that he derives this appellation the very instant he comes into the
world; the ground whereof was this. Humbert last Dauphin of Viennois having
lost his eldest son in that famous battle of Crecy against the English, and
his the other son having died of a fall from betwixt the Fathers arms as he was
dallying with him; The said Humbert being oppressed by the Duke of Savoy and
others, transmitted and bequeathed as free gift the brave Province of Dauphine
unto Philip of Valois then King of France, with this proviso that his eldest
son (and so of all successive Kings) should bear the title of Dauphin to
perpetuity during their fathers life's, holding it, as he did and his
progenitors had done, in fee of the Empire.

This was the sixteenth Dauphin since the first, who was Charles the wise in
the year 1349. whereby I observe that the precedent title of the presomptif
Heir of the Crown of France, is not so ancient by half a hundred of years,
as the title of Prince of Wales to the Heir apparent of England, which begun
in Edward the firsts time, who conferred that honor upon his son Edward of
Caernarvon 1301. But this title of Dauphin seems to have a greater analogy
with the Dukedom of Cornwall, which title was conferred first upon the black
Prince, because this as that of Dauphin needs no creation, for ipsissimo
instante, the very moment that any of the King of Englands sons come to be
Heir apparent of the Crown, he is to have liverie and seisin given him of the
Duchy of Cornwall, with all the honors and lands annexed for his present
support.

Touching those public passages of State that happened during the Dauphinage
of Lewis the thirteenth, while Henry the fourth lived, we will nor meddle with
them, because we would not confound the actions of the father with those of the
son; He was educated with that special care and circumspection wherewith the
Dauphins of France are wont to be bred, as also with that freedom from
overmuch awe, and apprehensions of fear, which is observed in the French
breeding generally, because the spirits may not be suppressed and cowd while
they are ductible and young, and apt to take any impression: He was not much
taken with his book, nor any sedentary exercise, but with pastimes abroad, as
shooting at flies and small hedge birds, to which end his Father put to him
Luynes who had many complacentious devices to fit his humor that way, for
which petty volatill sports he soard at last to the highest pitch of honor
that a French subject could fly unto, for of a gentleman in decimo sexto, he
was made Duke, Peer, and Lord high Constable of all France; But he had the
advantage to have the managing of his masters affection while it was green and
pllable, and he did it with such dexterity, that those stamps which he made
upon it then, continued firm and fresh to the last, as will appear hereafter.

And now must we pass from his Dauphinage to his minority, his Father being
now defunct; And it is a sad tale to relate the manner how his Father was forcd
out of the world, but told it must be, because it is a necessary appendix to
our story.

There was gentle calm through all Christendom, and France had not the least
share of it, having continued twenty years together in a constant repose
without the least tintamar or motion of arms (a rare thing amongst so
spritefull and quicksilverd people to whom peace becomes a surfeit any longer
then they have picked up their crumbs for a new war) I say there was a
catholic peace throughout Europe, when Henry the fourth of France would needs
get a horseback upon a great martial design, which was a mystery for the
time, for all men stood at a maze what he meant, the business was carried so
closely; whereupon he raises a potent Army of horse and foot.

But behold the greatest example of the lubricity and instablenes of mundane
affairs, and of the sandy foundation whereon the highest pomp and purposes of
men are grounded, that any age can parallel; For this great King, as I told a
little before, having a most potent and irresistible army composed of 40000.
combatants, all choice men, led by veteran Commanders, and the most expert
Europe could afford, in a perfect equipage; Having also a mount of gold as
high as a lance estimated at sixteen millions to maintain this army; Having
assured his Confederates abroad, settled all things at home, causd his Queen
to be crowned in the highest magnificence that could be, and appointed her
Regent in his absence, behold this mighty King amongst these triumphs of his
Queens, being to go next day to his army, when his spirits were at the highest
elevation, and his heart swelling with assurances rather then hopes of success
and glory, going one afternoon to his Arsenal, he was stopd in a small street,
by so contemptible a thing as a colliers cart, and there from amongst the arms
of his own Nobles, he was thrust out of the world by one of the meanest of his
own vassals, who with a prodigious hardiness putting his foot upon the coach
wheels, reachd him over the shoulders of one of his greatest Lords, and stabd
him to the very heart, and with a monstrous undauntednesse of resolution making
good his first stab with a second, dispatchd him suddenly from off the earth,
as if a mouse had strangled an elephant.

-- Sic parvis pereunt ingentia rebus. The French stories speak of diverse
auguries and predictions of his death; But I will insert here a passage or two
that are not found in any printed Author, therefore not vulgar, and our intent
is to refrain from stuffing this piece with any thing that has bin too much
blown upon; The first is a prophecy in an Italian manuscript from a good hand,
written above an hundred years since, which runs thus. Un gran Re di Francia
havendo le spalle al Papa voltate, s'inchinera poi a Roma, and al piu alto
della sua' gloria

Li tagliera la vita,
Un coltel feroce,
Che n'andara la voce
Per tutto'l mundo.
Thus rendered into English.

A great French King, having his face
Turned from the Pope, shall then embrace
The Roman Faith, but after, He
At highest pitch of Majesty
Shall by a fatal knife be rent,
To all the worlds astonishment.
To this may be added the speech of Francisco Corvini a Toscan Astrologer, who
the night before Henry the fourth was slain leaning upon a Balcon in Florence,
which is near upon 600. miles from Paris, and prying into the motions of the
stars, he suddenly broke out of his speculation into these words; Tomorrow
one of the greatest Monarchs of Christendom will be slain; And the very next
day the mortal stab was given by Ravaillac, who had been seen often a little
before at Brussels, and was observd to have frequent access, and much privacie
with Marquis Spinola, which many wondered at being so plain a man; A melancholy
odd Humorist he was, one who had at times some flashes of illuminations, as
his friends gave out: Now, such is the strength of imagination, and force of
fancy, that having let in false ideas into the brain, and being fomented by
some fatuous zeal, it hurles a man headlong oftentimes upon desperate
attempts, and undertakings of inevitable danger, making him misprize his own
life, so that he may be master of another, especially when the enterprise is
heated with hope of fame, revenge, or merit.

Thus fell one of the compleatest Kings under which the flower de luces ever
flourishd, a sprightfull and well tempred Prince, excellently versd in the
study of men, always well disposd, pleasant and witty, close in his
counsels, and constant in his purposes, parsimonious, yet open handed to Cadets
whom he lovd to see about him rather then elder brothers whom nature had
already advanced. And lastly (though this be but a quarter character of him) a
great discerner and rewarder of worth and virtue, a brave quality and one of
the prime requisits in a King; for subjects are industrious, or dissolute, they
aspire to virtue and good parts according as their Prince has judgment to
distinguish and value their worth, and so to employ and advance them. The
memory of this King is yet as fresh in France, as if he had been taken away but
yesterday, and his death was resented abroad as well as at home, being
universally honored by all nations, for the worst that his very enemies
reported of him was, that he was a great Courtier of Ladies, whereupon this
petulant Anagram was made of him.

Henricus Borbonius. Hircus in orb bonus. But take the aspiration away (and
with it let the aspersion go) this befits him better.

Cyrus in orb bonus. Having spoken this little of the Fathers death, it is time
now to return and pursue the life of the Son, and bring him to his
minority; yet though a Minor, he is absolute King, He is already regnant,
though his mother be Regent: And in regard method is a mighty advantage to
memory, and that the Logician gives us a good Rule, Qui been dividit, been
docet, A good Divider makes a good Disciple: we will make a quinquenniall
partition of his reign, we will divide it to so many lustres of years, and in
the first his minority shall be included.

The first luster (or five years) of Lewis the thirteenths reign, and of his
Minority.
THough the Sun was thus set in a dark ruddy cloud in the French Anno 1610.
firmament, yet no night ensued, for another suddenly rises up, and shoots his
rays through every corner of that part of the hemisphere, King Lewis the
thirteenth. The season that he began thus to display his early beams, being
the month of May, corresponded with the verdant time of his age, being not yet
full nine years old, so he was cradled first in the Fall, and came to the
crown in the Spring.

The report of the monstrous parricide committed on the person of Henry the
fourth did penetrate all hearts, and made a strange kind of consternation to
seize upon the minds of men, though it was no new thing in France to have their
King torn away from them so, for it was fresh in the memory of many thousands
how two and twenty years before Henry the third was dispatchd in that manner,
though the Assassin found his tomb in the very place where he did perpetrate
the fact. The Court of Parliament suddenly met that afternoon and declared Dame
Mary de Medici Queen Regent, which was the next day confirmed by the young
King himself sitting on the bed of Justice; This was done without any
opposition or scruple at all, for Anno 1610.
King Henry had designd her for Regent before, during his absence in the
wars, and the reverence that all had to the judgment of so wise and
welbelovd a King advantagd the work, with a favorable conjuncture of some
other circumstances, for both the Princes of the blood were then absent, the
Count of Soissons was far up in the Country where he had retird not without
some discontentments; The Prince of Conde was in Italy, to whom an express was
suddenly sent, but the Count of Fuentes then Governor of Milan had given him
the news before of King Henry's death, and as some say, labourd to infuse into
him some aspiring thoughts for the Protectorship, and so to embroyle France,
which took no effect; There were also two great armies afoote, one under
L'esdigueres in Dauphine, the other under the command of the Duke de Nevers in
Champany, ready to suppress any insurrection.

The Queen mother being thus establishd in her Regency, she put three things
in present consultation:

1. The security of the Kingdom. 2. A satisfaction to Justice for the
Assassinat. 3. The obsequies of the dead King.
For the first, it was thought fitting to re-publish the Edict of Nants in
favor of them of the Religion.

And now the Author craves leave to give this advertisement by the way, that
though his intent be to draw (as well as he can) the Acts of this King to the
life, yet the Reader must not expect to have them here in their full length,
and in all their dimensions; He must not think to find Edicts, Declarations,
Articles of Treaties, Letters and such like in their entire bodies here, He
leaves that to the French Chroniclers, such public exemplarie precedents being
more proper and useful to the people who live under that government, yet, care
will be had to insert here the substance of all such acts, and not to pretermit
any thing that is material, and conducing to the exactness of the story.

The first act of State, as I said before, was the reviving of the Edict of
Nants to content them of the Religion, who after the King are the powerfullest
body in France, having so many strong presidiarie towns for their security,
insomuch that they may be said to be a kind of Republike in a Realm; yet
France receives this advantage of them, that they are a means to keep the
King more narrowly within his bounds, and make him more cautious in his
actions; They may be said to be like goats among sheep whose smell keeps them
from the shakings and other diseases, so they keep the regal power from
excesses. In the Declaration wherein the foresaid Edict was incorporated, there
was also some clauses of compliance that reflected upon the City of Paris,
which was also to be pleased: Then the Princes of the blood were invited, and
expresses sent for them to come to the Court, Governors of provinces were
permitted to remain still in their commands, and diverse other acts of
compliances and policy Anno 1610.
passed, for prevention of discontentments, and insurrection.

Concerning the second which was a satisfaction to Justice, and how Ravaillac
should be offered up as a victim to her, much pains were taken; At his first
examination they would have persuaded him that the King was not dead but like
to recover, whereat he smiled saying, that he knew well enough the work was
done, for it was not he, but the hand of heaven that had don't; Then being asked
how he durst embrue his hands in the blood of Gods anointed, the most Christian
King, and his Soverain natural Prince; at the word most Christian he smild
again in a sleighting manner: Being searched there was found about him a pair
of beads, and a heart made of cotton with a piece of wood in it, which he was
made to believe was a part of that very cross whereon Christ suffered. All
means imaginable were essayed to make him discover if he had had any
instigators or accomplices in this infandous plot; but he still answered
positively, and constantly he had none at all, saying, he durst never speak of
it to his Confessor for fear of discovery, for so he might have bin punished
for the will, without the deed; yet a Jesuit and a Cordelier who were his
ghostly fathers were strictly examined, but nothing could be had out of them;
Hereupon there rose a nice question amongst the Divines, whether the Priest be
bound to reveal the confession of his penitent, but 'twas only propounded and
so left problematicall and indecided for that time.

Every one did whet his invention to devise some exquisite lasting torment for
Ravaillac; The Butchers of Paris, who are habituated in blood, proposed a way
to flay him, and the torture of excoriation should continue three days; Others
gave the draught of an instrument in form of an Obelisk where he might be
pressed, and the torment should last a long time; Others found out a way to
have his body cut quite off, from his hips downward, and his bowels to be
clapped presently upon a hot iron plank, which should preserve the other half
of the body in pangs of agony a long while: But the court of Justice thought
it not fit to invent, or inflict any other punishment upon him but what the
laws allowed; therefore he was condemned to be carried in a tombrell naked in
his shirt with a flaming torch of two pound weight in his hand to the common
place of execution, where holding the knife wherewith he had perpetrated that
most abominable parricide, his hand should be first pierced with the said
knife, and so to be burned with fire of sulphur upon the stage: That he should
have buskins filled with boiling oil applied to him, That he should be
pincer'd in the paps, thighs and braun of the legs, and that boiling lead
should be powered into the one, burning rozin into the other, and wax melted
with sulphur into the third; That his body should be torn afterward by horses,
all his members burned, reduced to cinders, and thrown into the air; That the
House where he was borne in Angoulesme should be razed to the ground, and that
none presume to build upon that piece of earth; That within fifteen days
after the publication of this sentence, his father and mother should quit the
kingdom, Anno 1610.
and never return; that his brothers, sisters, uncles and others should never
afterward bear the name of Ravaillac under pain of being hanged and
strangled.

This dismal sentence was executed to the very height of torture, and extended
to the utmost length of time, affection of sense, and possibility of nature,
for there were ways invented to keep him from syncops and fits of swounding:
Before, at the beginning, and in the midst of all his torments there could be
no other confession extorted out of him, though he was sifted with all the
sagacitie that could be, but that the motives which impelled him to such a
desperate attempt, were certain revelations, that he said he had had, which
he afterward called tentations, And that he thought he should do a work
acceptable to God, to take away a King that was a Favourer of Heretics, who
went about by the army he had then afoote to perturbe the peace of the
Catholic church, and make war against the Pope. The people in general did
love the deceased King so passionately, that nothing but imprecations and
curses could be heard ecchoing from them, so that none did pray with him when
he was upon the scaffold for the salvation of his soul, and for his body, when
it was torn by the horses, happy was he that could get any piece of it, so
that he was burnt in more then twenty places up and down the City in several
fires; so Nemesis had her glut.

Ravaillac being thus extinguished, and as it were annihilated, the next care
of the Queen was to give rites of burial adaequate to so glorious a King. His
heart the Jesuits had, for he had promised them to be depositaries and
guardiens of it in his life time, notwithstanding that one of their Society
had once attempted to murder him; so in extraordinary pomp his heart was
carried to la Flecle, and his body to Saint Denis; And Henry the third who had
layn all the while at Compeigne, was sent for to bear him company; so that as
they had the like destiny in their death, so they came to take their last
lodgings the same time in Saint Denis, whither, they say no French King went
with his good will.

The latter of the two, whom we will call hereafter Henry the great (that title
being entayl'd upon him by the universal suffrage of all) was condol'd with
far more regret then the former, and diverse to this hour wear a constant
anniversarie mourning for him that day he was killed; Amongst others her
Majesty of great Britain continues it, who was then a cradle-infant, and
Barberino at that time Nuncio in France (and after created Pope by the name of
Urban the eighth) coming to congratulate her birth, and finding that the Queen
mother had bin better pleased if she had borne a male; He told her, Madame, I
hope to see this, though your youngest daughter a great Queen before I die,
the Queen answered, And I hope to see you Pope; both which prophetic
complements proved true, and within a short time one of another.

A little after Ravaillac, was burned also the great Spanish Jesuit Mariana,
Anno 1610.
I mean his Book de Rege and Regis institutione, wherein he holds that a Tyrant
or Heretical Prince may be made away by violent means; Moreover by the same
arrest of Parliament, the College of Sorbon was commanded to publish their
ancient Decree passed by one hundred forty one Doctors of the sacred Faculty
of Theology in the year 1413. which was confirmed two years after by the famous
Counsel of Constance, viz: That it is not lawful to any, for what cause
whatsoever, to attempt any thing upon the sacred persons of Kings, and Soverain
Princes. Which doctrine and solemn Decree was then published to quell and
confound that execrable position which was than dogmatiz'd, and broached up and
down, viz: That a Tyrant whosoever he be, may and ought to be lawfully, and
meritoriously killed by his own vassal or subject whosoever he be, and by that
any means whatsoever, principally by secret ambushes, treasons, flatteries, or
other such ways, notwithstanding any faith or oath whereby the subject is
obliged to such a Tyrant, etc. Which tenet being then pronounced pernicious and
heretical, impious and diabolical by the said College and Counsel, was now
also by 150 choice Theoloques of the said Family adjudg'd to be an error
against the holy Catholic faith, and the fundamentalls of morality, opening a
gap to rebellion, and atheism, to a violation of all bonds of humane
obedience, and government, and tended to bring confusion, and a Hell upon Earth.

The Jesuits were murmured at, as Fautors of the foresaid opinion of Mariana,
whereupon Cotton (then Preacher to the King) published a declaratory letter to
vindicat their Society, and show their conformity of Doctrine to the foresaid
Decree of the Counsel of Constance, in which letter he protested in the name
of the rest, that, that opinion of Mariana was a particular fancy of his own,
and so to be restrained to his person only; That it is so disapproved and
exploded by their Society, that some of them have compiled, and exposed to the
open world sundry Treatises in confutation of it, and condemned it in two
Provincial Congregations held in Paris and Lion in the year 1606. where their
Reverend General Claudius Aquariva was present, and there the Soverain
puissance, and authority of Kings was acknowledged, and in temporal matters to
hold soly of God himself; The substance of Father Cottons declatory Letter
tended all to this effect, though it gave not so full a satisfaction to all
men. This was that Cotton who was so much favored by Henry the Great, which
gave him occasion to Answer certain Deputies of Rochel upon a petition they
once presented unto him, That he could not hear them then, for his ears were
stopped with Cotton, whereupon was made this Epigram of Him.

Quand le Roy fait ses pas,
Pere Cotton l'accompagne;
Mais le bon Prince ne scait pas,
Que le fin Cotton vient d'Espagne.
Thus Englished,

When the King abroad does walk, Anno 1610.

Father Cotton finds him talk,
But the good Prince does not attain,
That the fine Cotton com's from Spain.
The formidable Army which Henry the great had raised, was now disbanded by
command, and only 12000. kept still a foot in Champagny which were reserved to
assist the German Princes, who were then in motion of arms upon this occasion.
William Duke of Iuillers and Cleves being dead without Heir male, the right of
succession was debated by other Princes his allies; but the Emperor alleging
that the Duchy of Iuillers was a fief moving of the Empire, invested Leopold
his Cousin german in the possession of it, who by armed hand seizd upon the
town and castle of Iuillers. The opposite Princes having besieged him there,
sent to France for help: Hereupon Marshall de la Chastre marched with those
12000. Auxiliaries, and his conjunction with the other Princes was so fortunat
that Iuillers was rendered up upon composition to the Duke of Newburg, and
Marquis of Brandenburgh, but with this proviso that the Roman Religion should
still have free exercise there.

This relief of Iuillers was the first foreign act that happened in the reign of
Lewis the thirtteenth, and the expedition was intended before by his father.

Although in successif hereditary Kingdoms (as France and England, where the
law says the King never dies) the act of Coronation be not so absolutely
necessary, as to appertain to the essence of the thing, yet has it bin used as
a ceremony not superfluous for the satisfaction of the people. Hereupon there
were great preparations made for the crowning, and the anointing of the young
King with the holy oil, which is kept always in the town of Rheims in a
little vial; and the French faith is, That it is part of the same oil
wherewith Clovis (who was the first Christian King of France converted by his
wife above 1000. years since) was anointed, and that a Dove brought down in her
beak the said vial into the Church, and so vanished, which oil they say
continues fresh and sweet, and without diminution to this day; The said vial
was once carried away by the English, but it was recovered by the inhabitants of
Povilleux, for which they enjoy diverse privileges to this day. This ceremony
of Coronation in France is a very solemn thing and continues above eight hours
long, without intermission. The twelve Peers are the chiefest Actors in it,
whereof there are six Spiritual, and six Temporal; the last six have now no
being in France but only in name: For they ought to be the Dukes of Burgundy,
Normandy, and Aquitain, the Earls of Toulouse, Flanders, and Champagny, all
which are represented by Deputies in this act: One of the first circumstances
in this ceremony is, that two Bishops come and knock in the morning at the
Kings Bedchamber door, the Great Chamberlain asks them what they would have,
they answer, Lewis the thirteenth son to Henry the Great; The Lord Chamberlain
replies, He Anno 1610.
sleeps. The Bishops a while after knock gently again, and demand Lewis the
thirteenth whom God had given them for their King; So the door opens, and he is
carried in solemn procession to the great Church. At the communion he takes the
bread and the wine, to show that his dignity is Presbyterial, as well as
Regal; The Parisians are bound to provide certain birds, which are let loose
that day up and down the Church, whereof one was observed to sit and sing a
great while upon the canopy that was carried over the Kings head, which was held
to be an auspicious augury: Grace before and after diner, is sung before him,
and the sword is held naked all the while; with a multitude of other
ceremonies: The King seeming to be tired having bin so many hours in the
Church, and born the crown on his head, with diverse other heavy vests upon his
body, was asked what he would take to take the like pains again? he answered,
for another Crown I would take double the pains.

The King and Queen Regent being returned to Paris, the scene where the last
act of this pomp should be performed, before the triumph was ended there was a
dash of water thrown into their wine, by news that was brought of an
insurrection that was in Berry by Florrimond de Pay Lord of Vatan, who
undertook to protect certain Salt Merchants by arms, which he had leavied, but
he was quickly suppressed, and his head chopped off, diverse of his accomplices
hanged and strangled: This was the first flash of domestic fire that happened
in the reign of Lewis the thirteenth, which was the more dangerous, because the
said Lord of Vatan was of the Religion, and 'twas feared the whole body of them
would have abetted him.

There arise a little after two ill-favored contentions twixt Churchmen which
kept a great noise for the present; One was of the Jesuits, who presented a
remonstrance to the Court of Parliament, that by virtue of an Edict of Henry the
Great, 1611. they might be permitted to open their College of Clermont for the
instruction of youth, and to erect Classes for the public Lecture of the
Sciences in a scholary way: The Rector of the Universitie seconded by the
Sindic of Sorbon with the whole body of Academiks opposed it mainly; The first
thing the Court ordered was, that the Jesuits should subscribe to a submission
and conformity to the Doctrine of the Sorbon School in these four points.

1. That the Pope has no power over the temporalls of Kings, and that he
cannot excommunicat them, or deprive them of their Kingdoms. 2. That the
Counsel is above the Pope. 3. That the Ecclesrastiques are subject to the
Secular and Politic Magistrate. 4. That auricular Confessions ought to be
revealed which concern the State, and life's of Kings and Soverain Princes.
All which Propositions tended to the maintenance of royal authority, the
conservation of the sacred persons of Kings, and the liberties of the Gallie
Church. The Jesuit shrunk in their shoulders at this motion, Anno 1611.
so one in the name of the rest answered, that amongst their Statuts there was
one which obliged them to follow the rules and laws of those places where they
were; therefore they could not promise their General would subscribe to the
foresaid propositions, but their Provincial in France should do it with the
whole College of Clermont, which was done accordingly; yet the Parliament could
never be induced to pass a Decree whereby they might be authorized to open
their College in Paris for the education of youth; though afterward the King
and Queen Regent by sole advise of the Counsel of State, notwithstanding the
opposition of Parliament, and Universitie passed an Edict in their favor: And
this was done out of pure reason of State, for the world knows what dangerous
instruments Jesuits are, if offended.

The other scuffle amongst Churchmen was of a greater consequence Anno 1611.
which was thus. The Iacobins (who are the chiefest order of preaching Friars)
have a general Chapter every three years in Paris; This convention happened
this year, and diverse Tenets were propounded there; One amongst the rest was,
That in no case the Counsel is above the Pope. There sat in this Assembly
many eminent persons as the Cardinal of Perron, the Popes Nuncio, with diverse
other great Prelates; There were also some Presidents of Courts there, and
Counselors, and the Provost of Paris: Amongst others Hacquevill President in
the great Chamber of Parliament at the debatement of the said thesis, stood up
and averred that it was heretical; whereat the Nuncio was offended, and after
some heat of argument pro and con, Cardinal Perron took the word, and said,
that this controversy being not of Faith, it might be lawful for them the other
side the Alps to hold it affirmative, and for those of this side, negative, but
to condemn one another positively thereupon, was to bring a schism into the
Church. Great was the confusion and clashings that grew out of this: Till
Morelles a Spaniard who sat in the chair stood up, and protested that this
position was propounded only as problematicall, without dessein to determine any
thing thereupon. Another enlarged himself further, saying, that they the other
side the Hills have their reasons for the affirmative part, and others for the
negative. The French acknowledge sufficiently the hierarchy of the Church, and
in consequence of that they receive the Decrees and Ordinances of the Vicar of
Christ in every thing that concerns spiritual matters, points of Faith, and
policy Ecclesiastic: They make their addresses to him for dispensations to hold
incompatible benefices, to be promoted to Prelacy or other dignities being not
of age, for degrees of kindred and affinity in marriages; They hold with all
Antiquity that it belongs to the Pope to indict ecumenical and universal
Counsels, to approve, ratify, and authorize their Decrees; and in this sense
the Pope may be said to be above the Counsel: But if the Pope should under
pretext of spiritual jurisdiction attempt to enervat, and lessen the temporal
power of Kings, which they hold immediately and folly from the great God, it is
then lawful for them to appeal to a general Counsel; And in this Anno 1612.
sense the Counsel may be said to be above the Pope.

Richer the Syndic of Sorbon was hottest of any that assisted in this dispute
for the negative part, and writ a book entitled de Ecclesiastica et Politica
Potestate, which was condemned by the solemn censure of Cardinal Perron, and
sundry other great Prelates who held a Congregation purposely about it, but with
this modification, provided, that the rights of the King and Crown of France
with the immunities and enfranchisements of the Gallican Church be not
prejudiced: But they condemned the Syndiks Book, because he went about to turn
the Hierarchy of the Church, which is a Monarchy, into an Aristocracy.

Richer was thrust out of his Sindicship for the said book, though directly
against the Statuts of the College of Sorbon, whereof one is, that no Syndic be
dispossessed of that place but with his own free will: And thinking to plead
this, the Counsel of State overrul'd the case, and a Mandamus came in the
Kings name to proceed in the Election of a New Syndic. There issued also out a
Declaration, wherein the King sharply reprehends the congregating of the said
Bishops without his royal Commission, and for passing a general, extravagant
and uncertain censure of the said Book; wherein they seemed to rebuke, and
approve; confirm and condemn the tenets thereof, whereof most were Orthodoxal;
which tended to puzzle the brains of men, and form scrupulous imaginations in
their intellectuals, whence might ensue dangerous consequences.

Thus those high contentions were hushed which were like to have ushered a
shrewd schism into the Gallic Church, had not Moderation guided the helm;
Moderation that sage sober Matron, the inseparable attendant of true Sapience,
and Policy, and happy are those Counsels, those Soverain Courts and Parliaments
where she sits in the chair.

This year 1612. was remarkable for the interchangeable Alliance Anno 1612.
that was made twixt France and Spain, the French King being affianced to the
Infanta Anne of Austria; and the Prince of Spain (now Philip the fourth) to the
Eldest daughter of France Madame Elizabeth of Bourbon; The great Duke of Mayn,
great in constitution as in quality, being one of the goodliest personages of
Europe, was employed Ambassador to Spain. He made his entrance to Madrid with
245. sumpter Mules, 50. household Officers came after, two by two, and 52. Pages
with a querry before them, and their Governor behind. Then followed the Duke
himself accompanied with the Prince of Tingry, 7. Earls, 4. Marquises, 17.
Lords, and above 200. Gentlemen. He was brought in by 500. Spanish Ginetts; At
his lodging he had ten Coches every day attending besides his own three. The
business it seems, was wrought to his hand before his coming, for he met with no
difficulties at all: The contract of the marriage was in Spanish and French, but
the French was first signed: though the other first read. The dotal portion was
but 600000. crowns on either side, which was paid and no purse opened, being a
cross marriage, the sum of the dowry was so moderat, because there might
peradventure Anno 1612.
happen an occasion of restitution. But the wonder was not so much at the
smalnes of the dowry as of the jointure of both Princesses, which was but
20000. crowns yearly rent. Much praecaution was used by the Spaniard, that, to
correspond with their Salic law in France, the Infanta should renounce all
right of succession to the Crown and dominions of Spain known or unknown. The
Duke of Mayn was much honored for the time, and once the King took him out of
purpose to ride by his side through the town; under pain of indispensable
death, none was to draw sword against any Frenchman while he was there; The
Duke was presented with a chain and Hatband valued at 15000. crowns with four
Ginetts. And hoping it might prove a good omen for the prosperity of the
match, the Feast of Saint Lewis was commanded to be celebrated with as much
solemnity, and held as holy as any other Saints day in the whole Calender. The
Duke of Pastrana came that summer to Paris in another such splendid Equippage,
and concluded the counterpart of the match. Sundry sorts of triumphs passed in
Paris upon these reciprocal Contracts; but the two Princes of the blood would
take no share in those public solemnities, but retired from Court in disgust;
Causing some Confidents of theirs to blaze abroad the grounds of their
grievances, which were, That the Queen Regent did not communicate unto them the
most important affairs of State; That she had concluded the foresaid marriages
without their advice; That they were untimely and praecipitat, considering the
age of the Princes: That the Queen steered the great vessel of the State by a
foreign compass: That the mass of treasure left by the last King was
exhausted, with such like. But a way was found to comply with them for that
time, so they both returned to Court, where Soissons died a little after.

But there was a more dangerous consequence then this like to ensue; for the
said match, and so much intimacy with Spain bred ill blood amongst them of the
Religion, and filled them with ombrages of fear, it might turn to their
prejudice and danger one day, in so much that a disposition of rising was
discovered in them generally; which was aggravated by an ill-favored accident
that happened in the Town of Nismes in Languedoc, where one of their prime
Preachers Ferrir being turned Roman Catholic, the rabble of the town sacked his
house, burnt his books, grub'd up his vineyards, and plundered all he had; The
King being offended hereat removed the Presidial Court and Seneshalship thence
to Beaucaire.

One Morgard an Astrologer published some Praedictions of his in Print grounded
upon the cross conjunction of some malignant planets, wherein he positively
foretold very great commotions that were ready to arise in France; and the fall
of some great men. But by Decree of Parliament he was condemned to the galleys,
where in lieu of handling his Astrolab, he was put to tug at an oar; This, the
poor Star-gazer could not foresee, though his other praedictions proved all
true. Now, touching Sydereal observations, and praedictions of Astrology Anno
1612.
though they be at best, but conjecturall, yet are they not altogether to be
contemned, albeit that scarce one in a hundred hit; there is a multitude of no
mean examples that may be produced, one was pointed at in the Proem of this
piece. And diverse know how the years of the late Erl of Pembrook were precisely
limited by a Genethliacall calcule. We read that Otho the Emperor commanded
all Astrologers to quit his dominions by such a day; The Astrologers sent him
word, that since he had assigned them a day to go out of the Empire, they would
assign him another to go out of the world, for by such a day he should be no
more among mortals; which proved true. This was contrary to a passage of Edward
the Confessor King of England, who, when an Astrologer came, and told him, that
he had taken great pains to pry into the horoscope of his nativitie, and found
that his Majesty should die in such a month; The King answered, I can go nearer
to work then so, for I can foretell thee the very hour of thy death, which will
be to morrow at two a clock in the afternoon precisely, so that thou can not
avoid it: So he commanded him to be tried and executed accordingly. But
although it be presumption in man to determine any thing peremptorily out of
their observance of the motions of Celestial bodies, yet it must be granted
that the said bodies by their perpetual influxes having dominion over every
thing that is natural in man, as the body, the mass of blood, the organs and
sensual appetit, they may dispose his humors and inclinations to peace or war,
to obedience or insurrection, to love or hatred accordingly. For if Comets, as
we find by woeful experience, which are of a far baser and more gross
extraction, being mere meteorologicall stuff, are thought to have a virtual
power to make impressions upon the air, and to leave infectious qualities
behind them in the regions thereof, which use to work upon human bodies in
contagions, and upon their humors to suscitat the minds of men to tumults, and
war, much more may the Stars claym such a power: Nevertheles although Astra
regunt homines, although it be allowed that the Stars praedominat over every
thing that is corporeal in man, it follows not, that this dominion extends to
his intellectuals and to those actions which depend upon the absolut Empire of
the will, and other faculties of the soul which are purely spiritual; but
though this should be partly granted, yet if we consider the union that is
twixt the soul and the senses (being inmates of one house) which is such, that
she cannot produce any act if they do not contribut, and present the object
which is the intelligible species, it may well be inferred that the faculties
of the soul operat by the ministry of the senses, and sensual appetit; and the
sensual appetit by influxes from heavenly bodies, which may be said to have
power to incite though not to force the will and affections of men to
commotions and war; and according to their various conjunctions and
oppositions, their anglings and culminations to cause good or bad effects,
which may prove inauspicious or successful; as some Astrologers observed when
his Majesty of great Britain (then Prince of Wales) went to Spain to fetch a
wife, there was then a conjunction twixt Jupiter and Saturn which is always
held malevolent, so that journey had no success; but whither am I thus
transported by this speculation from my intended road?

But without consulting the stars* it was easy for any one of Anno 1612.
a mean foresight to be a prophet of some sudden commotions to arise,
considering how matters then stood in France; for the Marshal of Ancre (an
Italian) had then the vogue, having engrossed to himself by the favor of the
Queen Regent the managing and transaction of all the greatest affairs of State;
A man not so despicable as the French Annalists make him, for his grandfather
was Secretary of State to Cosmo de Medici, and by birth, breeding and courage
was a gentleman; besides his wife had sucked of the same milk as the Queen
Regent did, for her mother had bin her Nurse. But it seems D'Ancre had scrued
up the strings of authority too high, and so they came not only to jar, but to
crack at last.

There were printed this year two Latin Books which kept a great clatter all
Christendom over; one was writ by Schoppius, called Ecclesiasticus; The other
by Becanus, called Controversia Angliae de potestate Regis et Papae. They both
trenchd highly upon Regal power. The first had base touches of scandal upon
Henry the Great, and his late Majesty of England; In so much that by a solemn
sentence of Parliament it was burnt in Paris: so France was revengd on the
Book, and England had some revenge on the body of the Author. For he being in
Madrid, and Sir John Digby (now Earl of Bristol) being Ambassador there,
Master George Digby his kinsman (a generous hardy young Gentleman) encountting
the said Schoppius he gave him a fair large cut athwart the face, and so
stigmatized him to the view of the world, which visible mark he wore to his
grave.

Touching the other Book of Becanus: The Syndic of Sorbon petitiond the Queen
Regent that it might receive the same doom, and that the Sacred Faculty of
Theology might be permitted to put forth some public instrument to condemn the
Doctrine thereof; The Queen advised them not to determine any thing thereon as
yet, nor to make such noise, or take so much notice thereof. But they pressed
further, alleging it would be a shrew brand to the Sacred Faculty to pass over
so slightly such a scandalous Book, that derogated so much from the authority
of Kings, and particularly of the most Christian, with silence. For posterity
will interpret this silence to be a consent to the tenets thereof. But they
were still put off, and in the interim there came news from Rome that a Decree
was published by the Pope wherein the said Book was condemned and adjudg'd to
contain many false, rash, scandalous and seditious things respectively, and
therefore to be no more printed or publishd, but to be put in the second
Classes of Indexes, until it be corrected, and the correction approved
according to the rules of the Index. In the said Decree the word respectively
some imagined to be inserted of purpose, as an evasion, to show that the
Jesuits do not absolutely condemn the doctrine of Becanus, but only as it
invades the Prerogatives of the French Crown.

They of the Religion, as I told you before, suspected some ill consequences of
the cross Match with Spain, and feared it would prove cross to them in time;
Moreover the Princes of the blood, and others Anno 1613.
repined at the power of D' Ancre, whereupon the Duke of Bovillon prime
Marshall of France, (and prime Machinator of this tumult) came to visit the
Prince of Conde, and made a solemn studied speech unto him as follows.

My Lord, it would be impudence in me to represent unto you the deplorable
estate of France, whereof you have more knowledge then I: or to touch the
arrogance of Conchiny, which you must needs daily resent; or to make his power
suspected, which is the next door to tyranny; or to exhort you to oppose his
pernicious desseins: The consideration of your own safety with that of France,
is enough to rouse up your generous thoughts, and to administer Counsel to you
who are the most judicious Prince of Europe: Moreover in such a manifest and
urgent affair as this, there is no need of Remonstrance, consultation or
exhortation, but to apply some sudden, and actual remedy: Therefore I address
my self now to your Excellence, not only to offer you my means, but my person;
as also 100000. men, who would esteem themselves happy to serve you, and will
hold it a glory to employ their blood to the last drop under your conduct, for
the good of the State, and your just defense against this Faquin Florentin,
this Florentine porter, who plots the ruin of all those Princes, and Peers of
the Kingdom, who would oreshadow his advancement, and hinder to establish his
tyranny: The difference of Religion which we profess, ought not to empeach a
strong and solid union between us, in the conjuncture of so common a danger;
considering that while we endeavor our own safety, we secure the State
general, and incolumity of our Country; which are conditions inseparable from
the Kings service, whose Sacred Person is not safe enough under the irregular
ambition of a stranger; which his Majesty himself begins now to perceive, and
seeing his liberty engaged, fears the ambition of this tyrant, and will find
himself obliged to those that can rid him of him.

My Lord, you are well assured that the greatest part of the Princes finding
themselfs involved in the same interest with you, are touched with the same
resentments, and disposed to join with your Excellence in a project as
glorious, as necessary; For doubtless the Gentry of France in whom consist the
sinews of our armies, being naturally averse to the commandments of a
stranger, will run unto you from all parts to assist you with their arms;
Touching the Towns, you need not doubt, but a good part of them which are under
the Government of the Princes will declare themselfs for you. And I give you
certain assurance, that They of the Religion (which are the strongest, and best
provided with soldiers, artillery, ammunition, and victuals of any other) will
declare themselfs for your party, as soon as you shall publish your laudable
intentions by some Manifesto.

It concerns your Excellence therefore my Lord, to take hold of Time by the
foretop, for the restoration, and safety of the State in general, and your
own in particular, and of all the Princes, and Gentry of the Kingdom: But if
you let Occasion escape you, know that she is bald behind, and you shall never
be able to catch her again: Besides the Armies which you might justly raise
now, during the Kings minority, and by reason the government is usurped by an
Alien (who has not so much as the quality of a Gentleman) would Anno 1613.
be hereafter felony and treason under the majority and liberty of our lawful
Monark.

The Prince was a subject fit to be wrought upon, and ready to receive any
print, for he could not brook the exorbitant power of D' Ancre, therefore
having assurance that the Dukes of Nevers, Main, Longueville, Luxemburg, and
the said Bovillon would follow him, he retires to Mezieres upon the frontire of
Champany; he made choice of that place because it was his Patrimony, and that
he might have a sure Rendevous of Sedan if need required: The Duke of Vendosme
thinking to retire to Britany was arrested in the Louure, but he got loose by a
trick; and the Chevalier his brother was sent to Malta.

The foresaid male-contented Princes recruted daily in Champany, But had the
young King got a horsback and pursued them presently though with a petty Army,
the Country would have riss with him, and so he had prevented their increase,
and driven them in all probability to Sedan, where he might have kept them in
exile, with a small Army on the frontires; And his Counsel was much taxed for
not advising him so: But in lieu of arms he sent Ambassadors and Epistles after
them to persuade their return, or, if they refused, to amuse them till he might
raise forces sufficient to encounter them; to which end he sent to Swisserland
for 6000. men; but Bovillon by his artifice hindered that design from taking
its full effect.

Thus a fearful storm was like to fall on France, for the malcontents
dispersed themselfs to diverse strong holds; Longuevill went to Picardy, Main to
Soissons, Bovillon to Sedan, and Vendosme was as busy as any other to raise
the Country in Britain, Conde continued still at Mezieres, nor could any
Letter from King or Queen Regent sent by the Duke. of Ventadour reduce him; He
writ to the Queen That the ill government, which he imputed not to Her, but to
ill Counselors, were the cause of his retirement, who because they might have
the sole direction of things, hindered the convocation of the States general
which were used to assemble always in the Kings minority: he complained that
the marriages with Spain were precipitated: that the authority of the Parliament
was diminished, the Churchmen trampled upon, the Nobles undervalued, the
people laden with gabells and tallies, divisions sowed in Sorbon, and the
University; with diverse other soloecismes in the present Government. In his
conclusion he insists much upon the convocation of the States general of the
Kingdom sure and free, a suspension of the marriage with Spain, and so concluds
with much complement. These were specious pretenses, but they were as so many
imaginary lines drawing to one real Center which was the Marq: of Ancre who
indeed was the sole grievance, and not He neither, but his power and privacy
with the Queen Regent, which they thought to demolish by Arms.

The Queen Regent in her answer to Conde reprocheth him, that he had not
imparted these things privately to her to whom he had perpetual acces; that
notwithstanding he seems to cast the fault upon certain Counselors, yet all
bounds upon her by reflection: she declares that long before the reception of
Anno 1613.
his Letter, she had resolved, and to that end there were public dispatches
abroad to summon the Convocation of the States General; she takes exception
that he should call them Estats seurs and libres, States sure and free, which
made her conceive a violent jealousy of some artifice on his side, to sow
seeds of difficulties in the said great Assembly: she alleges that from the
beginning she imparted both to him and the Co: of Soissons the marriage with
Spain, that they approved of them and subscribed the Articles; That the late
King declared his inclination unto it when Don Pedro de Toledo passed through
France. And so she concluds with exhortation that he would appear in the
Assembly of the three Estates, and bring with him all his Confederats, to
contribut the great zeal they profess to the common good of the Kingdom: The
Queens Letter was large, and in it there was a curious mixture of meekness and
Majesty. The Duke of Vendosme sent her also two Letters, but he could get no
answer to either.

Thus a fearful black clowd hung over poor France, which the Queen Mother
essayed by all means possible to dissipat before it should break out into a
tempest of intestine War, therefore, the King and she descended to send again
the Duc of Vantadour accompanied with the Presidents of Thou and Ieanin with
others to draw Conde to a treaty of accord; which at last was agreed upon, and
the prime Capitulations were these.

1. That the States General should assemble in the Town of Sens within such a
time, wherein the Deputies of the three Orders may safely and freely make such
Remonstrances and Propositions that they shall hold in their consciences to be
profitable for the common good, for the redress of disorders, and conservation
of public tranquillity. 2. His Majesty being willing to gratify the Prince of
Conde, has upon his prayer and instance, and upon assurance of his future
affection and fidelity, accorded to put into his hands the Castle of Amboise as
a gage till the States General dissolve, and 100. men for garrison in the said
Castle. 3. That 100. men shall be entertained in Mezieres, 200. in Soissons
whereof the Duc of Main is Governor, till the States General have risen. 4.
That Letters shall be sent from his Majesty verified by the Court of
Parliament, wherein his Majesty shall declare unto the world that there was no
ill intention against his service, by the said Prince and his Associats;
therefore that they should be never prejudiced for the future in their estates or
persons. 5. That in consideration of the expenses the said Prince might be at
in this business, his Majesty accords to give him 450000. Franks to dispose of
as he shall think fit. 6. That the eldest son of the Duke of Nevers shall
succeed his father in the Government of Champany.
These with diverse other Articles of this kind, the King was induced (I will
not say enforced) to condescend unto for preventing of greater evils; and it
was called the Treaty of Saint-Menehou; And one would have thought that a
gentle calm should have followed, and that the meeting of the States General
would have perpetuated it; But behold two ill-favor'd accidents, like two
impetuous puffs, put things Anno 1613.
again in disorder: The one was that the Duke of Vendosin would not put Blavet
into the hands of the Marquis of Caeuures according to the Kings command, but
stood still upon his guard in Britany. The second was an affront which Conde
alleged to have received from the Bishop of Poitiers, who would not suffer him
to enter the Town (as he passed to his government of Dauphine and secured the
Castle of Amboise) being sought unto by the Governor the Duc of Roanez to
establish his authority there. The Bishop armed first, and the town after his
example. Conde writes a Letter to the Queen Regent which did not please her
well, for he subscribes himself only her thrice-humble servant and neveu,
whereas he was used to write your thrice humble, and thrice obedient servant,
and subject. The Marquis of Bonnivet a creature of Condes had not yet dismissd
all his troops, therefore under his authority he harasseth and plunders all
the Country about Poitiers, sacks the Bishops House and commits many
sacrilegious and execrable outrages; The young King hearing this, gets
presently a Horsback, and sends the Duke of Main before to stop the ravages of
Bonnivet, so he follows after, and passing by Orleans, Blois, Tours, and
Chastel le heraud a cautionary town of them of the Religion (who
notwithstanding presented the Keys to his Majesty as he passed) he came to
Poitiers; where he reconciled the Prince of Conde and the Bishop; caused
Bonnivet to disband his forces composed of Picaroons and vagabonds, Thence he
went to Nants, where also he ranged the Duke of Vandosme to obedience,
dismantled the Fort at Blavet and so having in a short compass of time
composed and quashed all things he returns triumphantly to Paris, where an
Ambassador was attending him from Zuric, who desired to enter into an alliance
with him, as the rest of the Cantons had.

This was the first exploit that Lewis the thirteenth did in his own person,
which like the rising Sun dispelled those frog vapors that hovered in Poictou
and Britany: and it was held a good augury for the future. The presence of a
King is oft-times very advantageous; for Rebellion durst never stare long in
the face of Majesty, which uses to lance out such penetrating refulgent rays,
that dazzle the eyes of Traitors, and put them at last quite out of
countenance. With this achievment we will conclude his Minority, and his
Mothers Regency; And as this first expedition of his proved lucky, so was his
whole life attended with a series of good successes, as if Fortune her self had
rid with him all the while upon the same horse. And now must we put a period to
the first luster of Lewis the thirteenths reign, and with it to his minority
or bassage; We proceed to his second luster wherewith his majoritie begins
being arrived to the year fourteen.

The second Luster of the Life of Lewis the 13th. Anno 1614.
reign, and of his Majoritie.
ANd now our Story must mount up to his Majority, and follow him to his full
age, wherein he entered at fourteen years, and the broken number of the Lords
year was coincident, being sixteen hundred and fourteen; But I have read an old
Author who writes, that without any consideration had of years, the French
Kings arrive to maturitie, and are capable to sway the Scepter, when they come
to be as high as a sword, let their age be what it will.

In the former Chapter we told you that by virtue of the Treaty of St. Menehou
the Queen Regent had promised, and was obliged to the Princes by capitulation
to summon the States General, and suspecting there might be some desseins
against her authority, she endevour'd to prevent it diverse ways. First, in
the Mandats sent to the Governors of Provinces, and Towns for the elections of
Deputies, there were special cautions inserted, to choose no factious persons;
The second means was to defer the convocation of the States General, till the
Kings majority was declared, that so his authority might be the more complete
and absolut, whereby he might have a greater power to take into his hands her
interests, and oppose such resolutions that might prejudice them.

Lastly, whereas the said convocation was appointed first to be at Rheims, then
at Sens, she sent summons abroad that it should be held at Paris, where the
King was strongest by the residence of his servants, the affections of all
orders of people, and the assistance of the ordinary Court of Parliament which
is still there sitting, though it was used to be ambulatory with the Kings
Court.

Now, the difference which is in France between an Assembly of the three
Estates, and their Parliaments is, that the former has an analogy both in
point of institution, power, and summons with our Soverain high Court of
Parliament in England, composed of Lords and Commons, wherein the King sits as
head, and it is He alone who opens and shuts it with his breath; This being the
greatest of all Assemblies, treats of matters touching the universal good of
the State, and the making, correcting or repealing of laws, and it is the
highest Sphere which gives motion to all the rest.

The Parliaments of France, whereof there are eight, have not the same latitude
of power, yet are they Supreme Courts, or Sessions of Justice, where men's
causes and differences are publikly determined in last ressort without any
further appeal; and any Peer of France by right of inheritance has a
capacity to sit there.

The day being assigned for publishing the Kings Majority, the Queen Regent and
He with his now sole brother the Duke of Anjou, (for his brother the Duke of
Orleans was lately dead) went in a stately solemn manner to the Court of
Parliament, accompagnied with the prime Prelates, and Peers of the Kingdom, and
amongst them there were Anno 1614.
four Cardinals; A contestation happened 'twixt the Cardinals and Peers for
precedence; because the twelve Peers of France, before an Ordinance made by
Henry the third, preceded any Prince of the blood at the Coronation and Sacring
of the King, and the declaration of his Majority was an Act reflecting on that.
Yet the King inordred the priority for that time to the Cardinals, because
they were Princes of the Church universal, which made the Peers retire from the
Court lest it might serve for a precedent to future Ages.

The Court being sat, and all silenced the Queen Regent riss up, and said, That
she praised and thanked God to have afforded her grace to bring up her son to
the years of his Majority, and to maintain his Kingdom in peace the best she
could: That now he being come to age, she transmitted the Government to him,
exhorting the company there present, and all other his subjects to render him
that service, obedience and fidelity which is due unto him as to their King.
The Chancellor hereupon pronounced the Arrest of the Court, importing a
verification of the declaration of his Majesty's Majority; which was done in a
solemn studied Oration. This great solemnity did not end so, but it was
accompagnied with four wholesome Edicts, as the first fruits or hansels of his
reign.

1. The first aimed at a general concord 'twixt his subjects, by strict
injunction of observing the Edict of Nantes concerning them of the Religion. 2.
The second aimed at a general obedience, prohibiting all ligues, confederacy
and intelligence with any strange Prince or State under pain of lifs. 3. The
third against Duells. 4. The fourth against Blasphemy and Swearing.
Thus ended the Regency of Maria de Medici in form, though not in effect, for
she swayed a good while after as Queen Mother in all Counsels, the King
reposing still his chief confidence in her; during her Regency she did many
public things which discovered a pious and Princely soul; Amongst others she
provided diverse Hospitalls in the suburbs of Saint German for the relief of the
poor, the aged, and sick, and to set young people at work; which will continue
there as long as the walls of Paris for monuments of her honor and charity.

The King having notice that the Deputies of the three States were com, he sent
the B p. of Paris to warn them in his name to fit themselfs for receiving the
grace of God, that so a blessing might fall upon their consultations; to which
purpose three days fast was enjoined them, to prepare them the better for the
holy Communion, which was also inordred them. So according to ancient custom a
general Procession was made, wherein diverse ranks of Friars and Hopitalers
went before, then followed the Deputies of the third Estate, who took place
according to the rank of the 12. Governments of France, and made in number 192.
The Nobles followed them; in number 132. They of the Clergy went last, who
made 140. so that in all they came to 464. which number I observe is inferior
to that of the English Anno 1614.
Parliament, where the Members of the House of Commons alone which corresponds
the Third Estate in France, come to near upon 500. After these the King himself
followed on foot, accompagnied with the Queen and the Princes and Peers. The
next day after, all met in Bourbon House hall where the young King told them,
That having not long since declared his Majority, he thought fitting to
convoque the States General of his Kingdom, to begin his reign by their good
advice and Counsel, to receive their complaints, and provide for redres
accordingly, as it should be more amply told them by his Chancellor, who took
the word thereupon.

This general overture and Ceremony being ended, the States General spent
some days to visit one another, and to choosing of their three Praesidents or
Prolocutors which they presented to the King with protestation of all fidelity
and obedience. The next day they took the Communion all in one Church, going
six at a time ( viz. two of every Order) to the holy Table. The Monday
following they reassembled intending to fall close to work, but their
proceedings were retarded by some differences which intervened touching the
rank of the 12. Provinces or Governments, and this clash kept a great noise;
till the King interposed therein his Authority, and by the advice of his Privy
Counsel, which they submitted unto, made this decision marshalling the 12.
Governments thus: 1. the Isle of France, (whereon Paris stands) 2. Burgundy, 3.
Normandy, 4. Guyen, 5. Britany, 6. Champany, 7. Languedoc, 8. Picardy, 9.
Dauphine, 10. Provence, 11. Lionnois, 12. Orleans. This being regulated by the
King, they fell to the main work, and three Propositions were made; the first
by the Clergy wherewith the Nobles joined.

1. That the Counsel of Trent should be published through France. 2. That the
venality and selling of Offices should be suppressed. 3. That the King should
acknowledge in this Assembly to have no other superior power on earth in his
Temporalls, and that he held the Crown immediately of God alone. This last
Proposition was put on by the third Estate, against the intention and without
the concurrence of Clergy and Nobles, of purpose to hinder the concession of
the other two, because diverse of the third Estate were favorers of them of the
Religion and Financiers.
The first Proposition was couched in these terms.

That the Ecumenical Counsel of Trent be received and published in your
Realms, and the Constitutions thereof kept and observed; but without prejudice
to your Majesty's rights, the liberties of the Gallic Church, the privileges
and exepmtions of Chapters, Monasteries and Cominalties which his Holiness
shall be prayed, may be reserved, and to remain in their entire strength, so
that the publication of the said Counsel may not prejudice them any way.

The Third Estate protested against this, alleging these reasons; That in the
said Counsel there were diverse Decrees, whereby the Spiritual, invaded the
Temporal rights. That it would be a thing not only prejudicial but
dishonorable for France to approve of a Counsel, wherein the Anno 1614.
most Christian King had received a palpable injury in the persons of his
Ambassadors, who were postpos'd to them of Spain, which caused them to retire,
and quit the said Counsel in sense of that indignity offered to them who
personated the first son of the Church in so public a Convention. They excepted
also against that clause that the Pope should be prayed, the liberties of the
Gallic Church might be preserved, for that was to submit them to a foreign
power, to the Papal authority; whereas the said liberties are independent,
and originally inhaerent in the Gallican Church, and contemporary with
Christianity it self; The difference 'twixt Liberties and Privileges being
this, that the latter presuppose the concession and grant of some superior
Power, but liberties are original, and immemorial possessions, and equal to
inheritances.

Touching the second Proposition of the Clergy and Nobles against the venality
and merchandising of Offices, it was waved, because diverse of the Third Estate
were either Financiers, or Officers of Justice, which places they had bought,
and so had power to sell them again for money.

Touching the third Proposition that concerned the independency of the French
Crown which was presented by the Commons in opposition to the first Proposition
made by the Clergy and Nobles for the publication of the Counsel of Trent; the
one being made out of a zeal to the State Civil, the other to the State
Spiritual, there were hot bandings on both sides; The third Estate or Commons
would have it declared for a fundamental law, that the King being supreme and
absolute in his own Dominions, there is no power on earth, either Spiritual or
Temporal, that has any right to deprive him of his Crown, or to dispense and
absolve his subjects from their allegiance unto him: This was done to
extinguish that dangerous Doctrine broached by some, how it was lawful to kill
Tyrants, and if the Roman Bishop had power to declare Kings Tyrants, their
life's would be exposed to the passion of every Pope, and so to perpetual
apprehensions of danger.

The Clergy and Nobles finding how pertinacious and resolute the Commons were
in this point for securing the life's of their Kings, and fearing it might breed
a schism 'twixt the Apostolical See, and the Monarchy of France, Cardinal
Perron a man of high merit and moderation, was sent to make a Remonstrance unto
them, which he reduced to three heads.

1. That it is not permitted upon any cause whatsoever to kill a King. 2. That
the Kings of France are Soverains in all degrees of Temporal soverainty within
their Realm. 3. That there is no case, whereby subjects may be absolved from
their oath of fidelity to their Prince.
Concerning the first two he pronounced them as absolut and categoricall; but
touching the last the Cardinal said, that in regard it might usher in a
Schism, he left it as problematicall, not positif.

The President or Speaker of the Commons answered, that the third Anno 1615.
Proposition being political, he conceived it concerned not the Doctrine of
Faith, and consequently could not introduce any schism; much bussling there
was about this point, the Commons being very eager in it, having the Parliament
of Paris siding with them, who passed an Arrest in favor of them accordingly:
but the King evok'd the difference to himself commanding that nothing should be
determined thereon; in regard that he being assured of his own right and
possession, it appertained not either to the States, or to the Court of
Parliament, or any other arbiter whatsoever to take cognizance thereof; and
remarkable it was, that the King did not evoke and call that matter to Himself
and to his Counsel, according to the ordinary form, but absolutely to himself
and his own Person.

But although the King commanded the said Decree of the Court of Parliament to
be suspended, the Attorney General made such diligences, because he was a
friend to the business, that diverse Copies were sent abroad.

The great Assembly drawing now toward a closure, they brought their Cayers,
or papers of grievances to the King at Bourbon House hall; The Bishop of Luson
(after Cardinal of Richelieu) was Prolocutor for the Clergy; the King
presently delivered the said Cayers to his Chancellor, promising them an answer
with all convenient expedition.

Thereupon a little after he sent for them to the Louure his royal Palace, and
told them that in regard of sundry affairs of great importance he could not
answer their Cayers so soon as he desired, but he would give speedy order to do
it, in the interim they might carry along with them to the Country an
assurance of the satisfaction they expected touching the chiefest Articles; for
he was resolved to suppres the selling of offices, to ease his people of
tallies and subsidies, to cause a research to be made into the misdemeanures of
his Receivers and Financiers; and lastly, to retrench the multiplicitie of
Offices and Pensions, which were increased from about two millions of franks,
(which was the stint in the former Kings reign) to four millions, which make
four hundred thousand pounds sterling. Observed it was that the Marshall of
Ancre, while this business of retrenching Officers and Pensions was in hottest
agitation amongst the States, got three new Tresurers of Pensions to be
created, from whom he drew near upon one hundred thousand pound sterling, as
you will find hereafter when it will be thrown into his dish.

This was the first and last Assembly of the three Estates, or Parliament
general, that was held in the reign of Lewis the thirteenth, which it seems
found his grave then, for there has bin none ever since, and there is litte
hopes of its resurrection, while the Clergy and Nobles continue so potent, who
finding that the third Estate began to tamper with the Popes jurisdiction, and
Church matters, have wrought means to hinder their meeting any time these 30.
years and upwards.

This year died Queen Margaret the last Branch of the Valois, being Anno 1615.
come of the loins of thirteen successif Monarks of that line, a Lady of a rare
attracting exterior bewty, she had a high harmonious soul, much addicted to
music, and the sweets of love, and oftentimes in a Platonic way; She would have
this Motto often in her mouth; Voulez vous cesser d'aymer? possedez la chose
aymee. Will you cease to love? possess the thing you love. She had lodged
Henry Duke of Guyse who was killed at Blois so far in her heart, that being
afterward married against her will to Henry the fourth, and divorced by
mutual consent, she professed she could never affect him; she had strains of
humors and transcendencies beyond the vulgar, and delighted to be called Venus
Urania. She would have Philosophers and Divines in her House, and took pleasure
to hear them dispute, and clash one with the other; she entertained forty
Priests, English, Scots, and Irish; she would often visit hospitals, and did
diverse acts of charity to satisfy for the lubricities of her youth.

There was an accident happened this year in Paris that made a mighty noise for
the time; Two of the Kings gards having fought, and the one being killed, the
other fled into Sanctuary to the Abbey of St. Germain; The Duke of Espernon
fetched him thence by force: Complaint being made to the King, he put him over
to the Court of Parliament to receive his doom for infringing the Privileges
of the Church, and commanded him to deliver the Prisoner again to the
Sanctuary, or he would fetch him away himself; The old Duke did so, and coming
to the Palace to appear before the Parliament, a ruffling company of Soldiers
and Cadets followed him who did some acts of insolency against the Lawyers by
kicking them with their spurs in the Hall where none should come spurred; this
aggravated the business, but the Duke made a long submissive speech to the
Parliament, wherein he acknowledged his error, concluding with an apology, that
they would excuse him if his discourse did not content their learned ears, for
having bin all his life time a Captain of foot, he had learnt to do better then
speak.

The prime President then rise up, and said; That since the King in imitation
of his Progenitors intends to be more inclined to sweetness and clemency, then
rigor: The Court by his express command, and in consideration of your long
services, believing the good rather then the bad, does graciously interpret the
actions of an ancient Officer of the Crown and Peer of France, and so receives
your excuses: hoping that this will occasion you, and your children to render
the King and the State such services as you are obliged to do, and for the
futur that you will contain your self within the bounds of that respect and
honor which you owe to this Court.

There was mention made a little before how the Assembly of the States General
was dissolved, and that having delivered their Cayers of complaints to the
King, they were dismissed but with large parol promises only; We related also
how the Arrest made in the Parliament of Paris in Confirmation of the opinion
of the Third Estate touching the independency of the Crown of France, was
commanded by the King Anno 1615.
to be suspended, and that nothing should be determined therein. This gathered
ill blood, which bred ill humors, and so brake out into diverse distempers
afterward, as will appear: For as in the natural body, if upon taking of
Physic, the superstuities be only stirred, and not purged, it does more hurt
then good, and makes the drug to remain in the stomach undigested; So in civil
Corporations, if abuses be only moved, and not remedied, it makes the body
Politic worse then it was.

The Parliament of Paris was sensible how the Arrest wherein they concurred
with the Third Estate was slighted, and countermanded, therefore they published
an Order, that, under the good pleasure of the King, all Princes, Dukes, Peers,
and Officers of the Crown which are capable of sitting and have deliberative
votes in that Court, should repair thither by such a time, to consult of
matters tending to his Majesty's service, etc. When this Order passed the
Prince of Conde was promised to be there, but he was counter-commanded by the
King, nor did any of the rest appear: yet the Parliament went on and framed a
Remonstrance of abuses in Government which by their Deputies they sent to the
King, and being come to the Louure they danced attendance there a good while,
and afterward they were brought up by a back odd way to the Kings presence,
where the Queen Mother was also present and diverse Princes; The prime President
made an oily complemental speech full of protestations of loyalty to his
Majesty, and afterward delivered the Cayer of Remonstrances, which was read
aloud by one of the Secretaries of State, wherein the Parliament instanced in
diverse grievances, and that they resented nothing more, but that in the face of
the whole State, the royal power was rendered and left problematical, and
doubtful.

The young King was not well pleased with this Remonstrance, and the Queen
Mother much less; Who told them that the King had just cause to be offended
with the Parliament, because against his command they had meddled with matters
of State, and that she was not so short sighted, but that she could perceive
how these things reflected upon her Regency, which they had formerly highly
approved of, and the Assembly of States General had also thanked her for. Then
the Chancellor took the word, telling them that they had bin misinformed in many
things which they took upon trust, and that they were much out of their
account, in that they alleged that the expenses were greater, and the receipts
less under this King, then his Father, who reserved but eight thousand livers,
every year, not two millions, as they pretended. So the prime President, and
the rest of the Parliaments delegats were dismissed with little or no
countenance at all; The Counsel of State spoak high language, averring that
the passing of the foresaid public Order to invite the Princes, and Peers to
meet in Parliament upon extraordinary occasions, without his Majesty's leave,
was an open, and insupportable attempt upon his authority now that he is
declared Major, as also upon the authority of that Counsel; therefore an
Arrest issued out, That the Parliaments Remonstrances were false, calumnious,
and full of malice and disobedience, and that therefore they Anno 1615.
should be drawn off the Register of the said Parliament, and suppressed for
ever, with an inhibition that the said Court should not meddle with matters of
State but by the Kings command. Before this Arrest was published, the
Parliament mainly endevour'd to give some contentment to their Majesty's;
therefore they employed again the prime President with others, To declare the
great displeasure the Court had, that their Remonstrance was not agreeable to
their Majesty's wills, protesting that it was never the intention of the Court
to touch upon their actions, or the Queens Regency, whom they acknowledged to
have obliged all France by her wise conduct and care she had both of the Kings
Person, and the State, that as they could not, so they would never attempt any
thing upon royal authority, what they had don was to testify the zeal which
they owe, and will show eternally to their Majesty's Persons; That they most
humbly desired them to remember that the very next day after the death of Henry
the Great, their Majesty's were pleased to honor that Court with their
presence, desiring them to contribut their good Counsels for the conduct of the
public affairs, which obliged them to present the foresaid Remonstrances, etc.
So they concluded with all possible submission, and a desire that the said
Arrest of his Counsel of State should not be published.

This took away something of the inflammation for the time, but it cured not the
wound, which began to fester more and more, and so gangrend that the whole body
politic was like to perish. For what the Court of Parliament sought by
supplication, the Prince of Conde not long after sought by the sword, who
having diverse of the greatest Princes, and them of the Religion ligu'd with
him, brought their Petition upon the Pikes point; Conde flew to that height,
that he proceeded not by way of Remonstrance, but, as if he had bin a Prince
absolut, by way of Manifesto.

He was then in Picardy whither the King had sent diverse Letters by persons of
good quality, to invite him to come to Court, and to accompany him in his
voyage to Guyen to fetch the Infanta, but all would not do; for old Bovillon
had infused other Counsels into his head, and so he published a Manifesto that
the cause of his retirement from the Court, was the insolent deportment of the
Marshall of Ancre, the dissipation of Henry the Greats treasure, the
introduction of strangers, of Jews, Sorcerers and Magicians, by the said
Marshall; and so he concluded King-like, ( parlant en sire) Wherefore we pray
and warn all the the Princes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown, and all such as
call themselfs French to succor and assist us in so good an occasion: And we
require and adjure all foreign Princes and strangers, all the Allies and
Confederats of this State to give us aid and assistance, etc.

These were the specious pretenses that caused this Manifesto, which diverse
foreign Princes took in foul scorn, that he should require them, being but a
vassal himself; The truth is, there was but one general grievance, and that
was the Marshall of Ancre a Confident of the Queen Mothers, whom she had
brought with her from Italy, his wife having bin her foster sister; He had the
greatest vogue at Court, Anno 1615.
which being a stranger made him repined at. The King and the Queen Mother were
then resolved upon a journey to Bordeaux to receive the Infanta, and to deliver
the Daughter of France for the King of Spain: Conde disswades the King from the
voyage by Letters, which were not well taken. So while the one prepares for his
journey, the other arms for a war, and gets on his party Longueville, Bulloin
and Mayn, who had concluded the match with Spain, yet refused to attend in the
jour ney; Thus a fearful clowd hung over France, yet nothing could deter the
King from going to fetch his wife, and the Queen Mother said, That all the
power of earth should not hinder him: Besides he was straightened for money for so
long and costly a voyage, nor would the Chamber of Accounts verify in Letters
to take any out of the Bastile; whereupon the King went himself in Person
accompagnied by the Queen his Mother, his Chancellor, Secretaries of State, and
others, in whose presence the Coffers were opened and two millions and a half
of Livers, which make 250000. pounds sterling were taken out, and delivered to
the Treasurer of the Privy Purse.

The King being to begin his journey, the first thing he did was to secure
Paris, so he left Mounsier de Liencour Governor thereof, and to authorize him
the more, he admitted him to the Court of Parliament by Letters Patents which
the said Court did verify, notwithstanding the harsh answer they had had to
their late Remonstrance at the Louure: The Marshal of Ancre was sent to Amiens
with a considerable Army: And another Army was left under the command of the
Marshal de Bois Daufin consisting of 16000. foot, 1500. horse, and 2000.
Carrabins, to make head against the Mutiners. So the King and his Mother
accompagnied with the Dukes of Guyse, Elbaeuf, and Espernon, with a good number
of Gentlemen, with 1200. light horse, his Guard of Suisses and others, making
in all 400. foot, parted from Paris toward Bourdeaux, and being come to
Poictiers Madame his sister which was to be sent to Spain fell sick of the
small Pox, which detaind the Court there five weeks, and so much retarded the
journey.

In the intrim the Princes forces increase and prosper exceedingly, having had
the best in three rencounters: Old Bovillon had got 600. Reiters from the
Marquis of Brandenburg, who joined with them, they got over the Loire maugre
the Royal Army under Bois Dauphin. The Duke of Vandom was then with the King,
and he gave him Commission extraordinary to make levies of horse and foot, and
having by virtu thereof raised an Army of 10000. Combatants, he declared
himself afterward for the Princes, and employed them against the King. He who
did thrive best amongst the Royalists was the Marshal of Ancre who in the
interim had taken Corbes, and Clermont.

The King caused a Declaration to be published, wherein Conde and all his
Adhaerents were Proclaimed Traitors, and sent it to Paris to be verified by the
Parliament, which was never more puzzled in any Anno 1615.
business; those that were averse to the Match with Spain, and favored the
Mutineers endevour'd to elude the Registring of the royal Declaration,
alleging that the Princes of the blood being the prime Peers, could not be
censured there without their Peers, and that the presence of the King himself
was requisite, without which his blood could not be judged. After tough
altercations the voices of the Court were reduced to two Opinions, one was of
73. voices, who ordered that the Declaration should be registered, but the
Person of the Prince excepted for a month, during which time he should be
warned to submit himself to his Majesty and all others should lay down their
arms.

The other Opinion was carried by 78. voices, which was, that the Court ordered,
that the reasons for which they could not and ought not to proceed, to verify
the said Declaration, should be sent to the King; Conde to make his quarrel
more colorable, and being heightened by the said Arrest of the Parliament of
Paris, added diverse Articles more to his Manifesto, viz. 1. That further
research be made for the assassinat of Henry the Great. 2. That a reformation
be made of the Kings Counsel. 3. That the grievances of the three Estates be
answered, with diverse other.

They of the Religion were yet Neutrals, and thinking to fish in these troubled
waters proposed these high demands.

1. That the independence of the French Crown be declared. 2. That the Counsel
of Trent be never published in this Kingdom. 3. That his Majesty shall be
desired to declare that upon his Coronation oath for extirpation of heresies,
he understood not or comprehended his subjects of the Religion. 4. That in all
public Acts it shall be inserted no more the pretended reformed Religion, but
only, Religion. 5. That their Ministers shall be paid by the King, etc.
These with diverse other Propositions were first made at Grenoble where the
King permitted them to Assemble, but Lesdigueres could not endure them there,
therefore they removed to Nismes, and thence to Rochell, notwithstanding that
the King commanded the contrary. The Prince of Conde had an Agent in the
Assembly, who much pressed them to enter into the ligue with him, which they
did at last, and writ a Letter to the King of the cause of their conjunction
with Conde.

And as the King was importuned by them of the Religion one way, so was he
solicited by the Roman Catholics of Bearn on the other side, that his
Majesty would please to restablish them in the possession of their goods,
whereof they were deprived by Jane d'Albret his paternal granmother. Amongst
these counter-distractions, there came news unto the King that the 6000.
Suisses which he had from the Protestant Cantons, had quitted his pay and party
and returned to their own Country by the persuasion and practices of them of
the Religion.

Madame the Kings sister being recovered, He went to Bourdeaux Anno 1615.
where the Spanish Ambassador came to demand her for the Prince of Castile;
The Duke of Guise had a Procuration to marry her the next day, which he did the
Cardinal of Sourdis officiating, and the piety of the King much appeared in
the ceremony, because he commanded the Cardinals Chair should be put on a
higher ground then his. The same day the Duke of Lerma married the Infanta of
Spain in Burgos for the King of France. These nuptial ceremonies being
performed, Madame, now Princess of Castile, departed from Bourdeaux conducted
by the Duke of Guyse, and in regard a rumor ran that they of the Religion, as
also the Count of Grammont with others who were said to have ligu'd with Conde,
had waylaid the young Bride, the King commanded all the Regiment of his guard
to attend her; putting himself in the interim in the hands of them of
Bourdeaux. The exchange of the two Princesses was made upon a river called
Bidasso hard by St. John de Luz which separats those two mighty Kingdoms,
there were two stately Barges to waft them, the Spaniards on their side had a
huge vast globe representing the world, raised upon a pavilion very high which
made an ostentous show; The Duke of Guise took exception at it, and protested
he would never bring over the Princess till it was taken down, which was done
accordingly. The next day the young Queen came to Bayon, where Luynes, then
favorit to the King, attended her with a Letter all written by the King himself
in these words.

Madame, since I cannot, according to my desire, find my self near you, at your
entrance into my Kingdom, to put you in possession of the power I have, as also
of my entire affection to love and serve you; I send toward you Luynes one of
my confident'st servants to salute you in my name, and tell you, that you are
expected by Me with much impatience to offer unto you my Self. I pray therefore
receive him favorably, and to believe what he shall tell you, Madame, from your
most deer friend and servant

Lewis.


Luynes delivered her also from the King two rich Standards of Diamonds which
she received and kissed; and from her table at Supper She sent a dish of meat
unto him; In the morning She returned this Answer to the King.

Sir, I much rejoiced at the good news Luynes brought Me of your Majesty's
health, I come therewith, being most desirous to arrive where I may serve my
Mother, and so I am making have to that purpose, and to kiss your Majesty's
hand, whom God preserve as I desire:

Anne.


Being come afterward to Bourdeaux, they both received the nuptial benediction
in magnificence, according to the quality of the act and the persons, and
medals were made and thrown up and down with this Motto -- aeternae foedera
Pacis, pledges of eternal peace: but the Poet that made that piece of verse for
a Motto was no good Prophet; Anno 1615.
for the eternal peace he spoake of, lasted not many years between the two
nations, who notwithstanding that nature has conjoined them near enough in
point of local distance, there being but a small river, whereon the two
Princesses were exchanged, that severs them, yet there is no two people on
earth are further asunder, and more differing in disposition, affections and
interests, being herein right Antipodes one to the other. By this alliance is
verified the saying of the Italian, that Kings may wed, but kingdoms never. It
appears also hereby, what a hard destiny, and sorry condition attends the
daughters of Soverain Princes, who are commonly made sacrifices of State, and
oblations for Political respects, being also to be married to aliens, and
oft-times to husbands of a different Religion, they are wood by Proxy, they
must choose by picture, fancy upon trust, and tied in a knot indissoluble to
one they never saw but in effigy perchance, and afterward they must be
contented to be unpatriated, disterr'd, and as it were banished for ever from
their own sweet native soil, and the air they first breathed: yet as the
Civilian says, although they are the end of the House whence they come, they
are the beginning of that wherein they enter.

While the King was celebrating his nuptials in his town of Bourdeaux by diverse
inventions and exercises of pastime and pleasure, as masks, tilting, plays,
bals, and dances, Conde with his Confederats, leads another kind of dance up
and down France, but while he danced and revell'd thus, the poor Country sung
lachrymae, being pitifully oppressed, torn and harassed in most parts, there
being six or seven armies in motion on both sides: he increased mightily by
concourse of partisans, by conjunction of them of the Religion, and by diverse
successful rencounters; The King on the other side was at a very low ebb,
having exhausted that two millions and a half of livers he had taken himself in
person out of the Bastile, and being put to hard shifts to get money to defray
his ordinary expenses, the town of Bourdeaux to her eternal glory, showed
herself careful of his honor and supplied him. Add hereunto that two whole
armies fell from him, that of the Suisse consisting of 6000. and that under the
Duke of Vendosm being the greater of the two, the one only left him, the other
turned against him, and the whole body of them of the Religion declared it self
against him, and actually helped the other side: Moreover, his Parliament at
Paris would not verify his Edicts. Yet in the midst of all these straits, He
marches resolutly from Bourdeaux with his new Queen to join his army with Bois
Dauphin, with a purpose either to present battle to the adverse party, or to
draw them to a treaty; Espernon met him in the way with 4000. foot, and 500.
horse. The Duke of Nevers did very much labor and made journeys to and fro for
an accommodation, and his endevors took so good effect, that a Conference was
agreed on at Lodun; where Commissioners were appointed, and did meet on both
sides: in the interim the Duke of Guyse performed a notable exploit, with 2000.
of the Kings prime horses, wherewith he set upon three Regiments of Condes at
Nantueil, which he Anno 1616.
slew, took, and put to flight, carrying all their colors to the King for a
present. Hereupon a suspension of arms was accorded through all the Kingdom,
except in Anjou, Perch, and the frontiers of Britany where Vendosm continued
all acts of hostility, notwithstanding that he had his Deputy at the Conference.

The King was then advanced to Chastel le Heraud, where Villeroy delivered him
the Articles of the Truce signed by the Princes, and where a Legate came from
the Pope to deliver him the Imperial Sword, and to the Queen the Rosetree of
flowers, and leaves of gold.

Thence the King went to Blois where after a long debate, an Edict of
Pacification was published upon the Treaty of Lodun, which consisted of 54.
Articles, wherein all the Princes, with their adhaerents, as also They of the
Religion found satisfaction, and diverse persons of base condition were
nominated therein, which the world cried shame upon. By this Edict the King
approved of all actions passed, as having bin done for his Service, and by
consequence tacitly disadvow'd what He and his Counsel had ordained to the
contrary. The former Arrests of the Court of Parliament of Paris which the King
had suspended were reestablish'd, and they of the Counsel of State annulled,
and many high demands were accorded to them of the Religion; The Chancellor
Sillery, and diverse others who were the Kings Favorits before, were outed of
their offices.

Besides the said Edict there were also secret Articles condescended unto,
containing rewards and honors to some particular men in lieu of punishment and
they were presented in a private close way to the Parliament to be verified with
the gran Edict; The Court waved them a while, but afterward by express
commandment of the Kings, and by a Declaration he made that those secret
Articles contained no more then what was granted in the secret Articles of the
Edict of Nants already verified by the same Court, the business passed, though
with much reluctance, for if those of Nants were verified, what need these
being the same, have a second verification? This, as it were enforced
Verification, was accompagnied with Letters Patents from the King in special
favor to the Prince of Conde; and others Letters in favor of them of the
Religion, by which his Majesty declared, not to have understood his subjects of
the Reformed pretended Religion in the Oath and Protestation he had made at his
Coronation, to employ his sword and power for the extirpation of heresies;
which put the world in an astonishment, because it made the meaning of the
Taker of that Oath, and of the Prelat who administered it, to differ. This
turned afterward rather to the disadvantage then the benefit of the Demanders,
for those hard and high terms which reflected so much upon the conscience of a
young King, stuck deep in his breast, nor could he ever digest them, as will
appear in the ensuing Story: Nor was his honor thought much to suffer hereby,
being newly come out of his nonage, little versed in the art of Government, and
having not attained that courage and years which use to strike awe into
Subjects. Anno 1616.


This shrewd tempest being passed, the weather broak up and cleared; And the
King brought his new Queen to Paris, having surmounted such a world of
difficulties, and waded through a sea of troubles; he had bin absent thence
near upon a twelvemoneth, therefore you may well imagine with what joy, and
triumph the Parisians received him; Observable it is that in this voyage the
King notwithstanding that he had condescended to hard capitulations, yet he
attained his main ends, which was to perfect the Alliance with Spain, and to
fetch home his wife in safety, which he did maugre the great Martial
oppositions that were made by most of the Princes of France who malign'd the
match.

In this year there happened some ill-favor'd jarrs in Italy twixt the Dukes of
Savoy, and Mantova, about Monferrat; The King employed thither the Marquis of
Coeuures to compose the difference, but he returned without doing any good,
notwithstanding that the Ambassador of his Majesty of Great Britain joined with
him; He sent afterward the Marquis of Rambovillet, who carried himself with
more address, for he tampered with the affections of the French and Suisses,
which made the better part of the Duke of Savoys army, with such dexterity,
that the Duke entering into a diffidence of them, hearkened to a Treaty. Don
Pedro de Toledo then Governor of Milan was armed for the Mantovan, and by this
Treaty both Parties were to disband; in the interim if the Spaniard attempted
any thing upon Monferrat, France should assist his Highness of Savoy. But the
Spaniard though he attempted nothing, yet he reinforced his Troops, which
struck an apprehension of fear into the Venetians (who of all Nations are most
eagle-ey'd to foresee dangers) because there was a small difference twixt them,
and the Archduke of Grats about the Uscochi, which made them confederat, and
co-arme with the Savoyard: there were great Forces on both sides, and Don Pedro
took Verselli, and Damian, but his Majesty of France employed thither Mons. de
Bethune, who procured a Treaty in Pavia to that end, which took effect; but the
Spaniard afterward delaying to give up Vercelli, Modene Luynes kinsman was
sent thither who did the work; The difference also twixt the Republic and the
Archduke of Grats was accommoded by French intercession, so that in less then
a twelve months, four Ambassadors went from France to Italy.

About this time the Lord Hayes, afterward Earl of Carlisle, came in a very
splendid equippage to Paris, to congratulate, in his Majesty of Great
Britain's name, 1. The alliance with Spain: 2. The arrival of the new Queen:
3. The Kings return to Paris: 4. The end of the late wars. The French
Chroniclers relate that his chiefest arrand was to propound a Match between the
Prince of Wales, (now King of England) and the Lady Christina, second daughter
to Henry the Great; but they are much mistaken; for the said Ambassador might
happily have instructions to look upon and view the said Lady, but for any
overture of marriage, much less any proposition there was none, the Anno 1616.
intents of England aiming then more southward, and there was matter enough for
an Ambassador extraordinary besides at that time.

The King, the two Queens, and the whole Court being now settled at Paris, the
discontented Princes repaired also thither, but Conde being newly recovered of
a dangerous sickness, (which some took as a judgment upon him) lagg'd behind,
and excused his coming till all the Articles of the late Treaty were performed,
whereunto the King may be said to be no less then compelled, being, among
other ties forced to revoke part of the solemn Oath he took at his Coronation,
that thereby they of the Religion might rest contented: At last Conde came, and
was entered into a perfect redintegration of grace and favor at Court with the
rest of his Confederats.

So after such turbid times there was an intervall of fair weather, but the
Air was suddenly ore' cast again with clouds, and the chief Meteor whence they
sprung was the power and privacy of the Marshall of Ancre at Court. The Queen
Mother had advice of certain clandestine meetings, and secret consultations
held to alter the Government, and to demolish Ancre; hereupon Themines (who
received the Truncheon to be Marshall the same day) apprehended the Prince of
Conde in the Louure, and carried him thence to prison; the report hereof
startled diverse others, and old Bovillon being then at a Sermon in Charenton,
durst not come back to look upon the Bastile; so he with the Dukes of Mayn,
Nevers, Guyse and diverse other retired and armed under pretense of reforming of
abuses in the State, and for the public good. Poor France, how often has
private interest of some aspiring spirits bin termed in thee by the specious
name of Public good? How often have thy discontented Grandees ground the faces
of thy innocent peasants? How often have thou turned the sword into thine own
bowels, and swomm in the blood of thine own children? How often have thy Towns
bin turned to Hospitals, thy fields to deserts under the gilded pretext of
Reformation?

The arrest of Conde alarmed all France, and a politic rumor was spread in
Paris that the Marshall of Ancre had murdered him in the Louure, though he was
then at Amiens 100. miles off. This made the Beast with many heads run
furiously to his House in the suburbs of Saint German, which they sacked and
plundered most pitifully, they unplank'd his rooms, grub'd up his trees, and
committed diverse barbarismes besides. The King caused a Declaration to be
published full of vigorous expressions tending to this purpose.

Lewis by the grace of God King of France and Navarr, to all who shall see
these present Letters, greeting. It is with incredible regret which pierces
Our very heart, that We must so often employ Our Authority to repress the
mischievous desseins of them, who seek the raising of their fortunes, in the
ruins of Our Estates, and in the prodigious cruelty of civil wars, take an
unbridled liberty to do what law and reason forbids: And We are the more
sensible hereof, because the remedies We must use, for the safety of our
Person, and the welfare of this Kingdom, must diffame our own blood, and render
it culpable of impiety both against Us, who are in place of a Father Anno 1616.
to our subjects, as also against their own Country which is reverenced as a
Mother by all people though never so barbarous.

So he goes on to relate the Treaty at Lodun, and the last Pacification which
had cost him twenty millions of Livers; and what grace he had done to Conde and
his Accomplices.

Yet the exces of Our grace and favor has not bin able to repress the
disordinat wills of them, who find no rest but in trouble, and ground their
hopes upon Our destruction: for before and after the return of Our Cousin the
Prince of Conde to Paris, there have bin Nocturnall Assemblies held in Saint
Martin and other places with consultations to debauch and abuse the people, and
undermine those who have Martial Offices under us, and to excite them to
commotion; Curats and Preachers have bin tampered withal to vent scandalous
Doctrine, and means were consulted on to seize upon Our Royal Person, and our
most honored Mother, and to Cantonize France under the specious veil of
reforming the State: All which has bin told us by some of the best of Our
subjects who were present at some of their consultations, and close meetings;
And We were also advised by foreign Ambassadors to have a care of our self, etc.

This was the substance of the Kings Declaration, but all would not do, to
contain the Princes within the bounds of obedience, many of them had retired to
Picardy, and seized upon diverse places which they fortified apace. A little
after the Prince of Conde was clapped up, the Duke of Vendosm was seized on, but
he escaped by a wile; The Chancellor and Secretaries of State with other Officers
were changed; And in this hurly burly the young Bishop of Lucon afterward
Cardinal of Richelieu, having bin designed for Ambassador to Spain, was made
principal Secretary of State.

The Marshal of Ancre, notwithstanding that he had understood how he was hated
in Paris, and that his House was so plundered in a popular fury, yet was he
nothing daunted, but comes boldly to Court, and presently three Armies were
raised and appointed to repress the Mutiners; One under the Duke of Guyse who
was charmed to come in by the Queen Mother: The second under Marshall Montigny;
and the third under the Count of Auvergne, (who was freed from his 11. years
close imprisonment in the Bastile for that purpose) and had already besieged
the Duke of Main at Soissons, and much straightened him.

While this huge storm was dropping pitifully upon poor France, there were
secret consultations held by some in the Louure how to hurl Him into the Sea
who was the cause of the tempest, which was cried up to be the foresaid Ancre.

He knew too well how he was malign'd in Court and Country, and the young
Kings affection toward him began now to brandle, and all this was by the
suggestions of Luynes, who was one of the greatest Confidentst the King had,
having bin his servant from his childhood, and was versed in his genius more
then any: Ancre had practiced to remove him from the Kings Person, with some
others whom Anno 1616.
he suspected to do him ill offices.

Besides this fewd 'twixt the King and Princes, there was another petty war
then a foot betwixt the Duke of Espernon, and the Rochellers, the ground
whereof was that they would not acknowledge him Governor of the Country of
Aunis, and of their Town, which he pretended to derive by Patent from the reign
of Henry the third. He had also a grudge unto them that they had debauched the
conscience of the Count of Candalle his son by inducing him to abjure his
Religion, and to profess theirs; Espernon was commanded to wave that quarrel,
and to come to assist against the Princes: diverse others were wrought upon to
abandon their party; amongst the rest the Duke of Nevers was much sought, and
he refusing, he was accused to have said, That he was descended of a better
House then the Queen Mother; which he utterly disavowed, and offered to combat
the raiser of that report in Duel.

The obloquy and hatred of Ancre increased daily, and the executing of Colonel
Stuard and Hurtevant, with erecting of new gibets in diverse places about Paris,
and one upon the new Bridge hard by the Louure in terrorem, -- all which was
imputed to the Marshall of Ancre, exasperated the humors of the Parisians
against him more and more, in so much that it was an easy thing to be a
Prophet what would become of him. Luynes with others at Court infusd daily new
thoughts of diffidence of him into the young King, who had taken exception at
some personal comportment of his, by putting on his Hat when he played with
him at Biliards: so in a close Cabinet consultation twixt the King, Luynes, and
Vitry who was Captain of his Guard, the King gave him command to seize upon the
said Marshall of Ancre, and in case of resistance to kill him; The business
was carried wonderful close, and two days after the Marshall entering the
Louure, Vitry was prepared with his guard about him, and while the Marshall was
reading of a Letter, Vitry comes and grapples him by the shoulder, and told him
he was commanded by the King to arrest him; Me? said Ancre, yes you by the
death of God, (mort Dieu) replied Vitry: hereupon Ancre laying his hand upon
his sword to deliver it, as most thought, Vitry with a loud voice cried out,
Kill him, thereupon he received three Pistols shots into his body, and was
presently dispatched; Vitry with naked sword in his hand cried out, that none
should stir; For he had executed but the Kings commands. Hereupon those hundred
gentlemen which had attended the Marshall that morning to the Queens Court
where he was used to go the back way slunk away: and not one drawn sword
appeared amongst them.

The King being above in a gallery and hearing a noise below, asked what the
matter was? one answered, that the Marshall of Ancre was killed, and being told
the manner, he said, I will make good what Vitry has done, and giving a caper,
he said, I am now King of France, I have no competitor. Vitry presently after
broke into Leonora's chamber Ancres wife seized upon her person, upon all her
Trunks and Cabinets, Anno 1616.
where in gold, and jewels there was the value of above an hundred thousand
pounds sterling. Her Chamber was next the Queen Mothers, who sending in for
Vitry, asked him without any show of dismay whether he had killed the Marshall;
Yes Madame, said he: and why? because the King had commanded me.

Ancres body was buried in a little Church hard by the Louure, and stones laid
and flatted upon the grave, but the next morning, the laquays of the Court, and
rabble of the City, came and dug up his coffin, toare his winding sheet, and
dragged his body through the gutters, and hanged it upon the new gibet which he
had commanded to be set up upon the new bridge, where they cut off his nose,
ears, and genitories, which they sent for a Present to the Duke of Main at
Soissons, and nayl'd his ears to the gates of Paris, the rest of his body was
burned, and part of the ashes hurled into the river, and part into the air.
His wife was then imprisoned, searched and razed for a Witch, though little or
no proofs (God wot) were produced against her, only that she employed some
Jews; as also that she had bewitched a Spanish Ginet the Duke of Mayn had at
Soissons which he should have mounted one morning, but Mounsier Maurice his son
who was Keeper of one of the chiefest Academies of Paris riding him before, and
the Horse having pranc'd and curvetted a good while under him, he suddenly
fell, gave a groan and so breathed his last, and the Rider was taken up for
dead, and continued in a sleepy trance 48. hours together. So she was also
executed afterward, and the difference twixt her husband and her was this,
that she had the favor to dye after Sentence was given, and he before, for his
indictment was made after his death, and then his sentence passed when he was
in the other world.

Thus Conchino Conchini (a Florentin born) Marquis of Ancre, and Marshall of
France was demolished, or rather extinguished, in a most disastrous manner, and
his wife Leonora Galligay beheaded, who showed a notable Roman resolution at
the block; their estate, which was not above four thousand pound sterling per
an. was given to Luynes most part of it; They left one only male child who
being young was sent to Italy, where he lives to this day in a Noble equippage
by the title of Earl of Pena: though pronounced ignoble in France by an arrest
of the Court of Parliament: A stout man this Marquis of Ancre was, a good
Soldier, and a complete Courtier, he was endowed with diverse good parts, only
he wanted moderation, and therein he did degenerat from an Italian.

There were diverse censures abroad of this act of the young Kings, and indeed
it was the worst thing he did in all his life, being an act fitter for the
Seraglio, then his Castle of the Louure: for the wisest sort of men wondered
that he should stain the walls of his Court, with a Christians blood in that
manner, without any legal proceeding against the party. He sent Letters to the
several Princes that were in arms, to content them, as also to satisfy the
world; and all of them of this tenor following.

My Cousin, I doubt not but in the course of affairs which have passed since
Anno 1617.
the death of the late King my Lord and Father (whom God absolve) you have
observed how the Marshall of Ancre and his wife abusing my minority, and the
power which they acquired upon the spirit of the Queen my Mother, have
projected to usurp all authority, to dispose absolutely of all matters of State,
and to deprive me of the means to take cognizance of mine own affairs; a
dessein which they have pushed on so far, that hitherto there has remained
unto me but the sole name of a King, and that it was a kind of capital crime
for my Officers and subjects to have acces unto me, and to entertain me with
any serious discourse; which it pleasing God to make me perceive, and to point
out the danger which my Person and State were like to incur by such an
exorbitant ambition, being compelled by some considerations, and inspired by
Counsel from above, I resolved to secure the person of the said Marshall, and
therefore I commanded the Captain of my Guard to arrest him within my Castle
the Louure; which he attempting to do, the said Marshall being well
accompagnied offered to oppose my said command, and certain blows being given
the said Marquis fell down dead, etc. So he tells him that he intends for the
future to take the reins of Government into his own hands. Wherefore he exhorts
him to return near his Person, and take his due rank in Court and Counsel.
And concludes that if he renders proofs answerable to the esteem he makes of
his affection toward him, he will be ready to acknowledge it.

Many Letters went abroad from the King of this tenor, and they took such
effect that all arms were thrown down every where, and the Princes repaired to
Court: Now and not before it may be said that the King began to reign: by this
change, France changed her countenance, old Officers were restored to their
places; Sillery was made Chancellor again, Du Vair, and Villeroy were restored
with diverse others; and the Bishop of Lucon left the Secretariship of State,
and retired, though he was offered to be still of the Privy Counsel if he
would stay. The Queen Mother showed her self a true Queen of her passions
herein, for though her favourit, and foster sister were torn away from her
thus, yet such was her temper, that she discovered no extraordinary resentment,
that which she said, she took ill was, that the King did not impart unto her
his intentions, for she would willingly have concurred to do all things to his
contentment; The King appointed her the Castle of Blois to reside in, and
coming to take his leave of her, he thanked her for the pains she had taken in
Government, but he resolved to sit now at the helm himself, and if she would
be a good Mother to him, she should find him a good Son.

The Marchiones of Ancre was not executed till the Queen was gone from Paris,
at her arraignment she showed an Amazonian courage, and the subtilty of her
spirit put all men in admiration; she denied, with much disdain, all kind of
witchcraft and sorcery, (and indeed the proofs were little or none at all
against her) She confessed that she had conveyed some moneys out of the
Kingdom, but it was either for the Kings service, or for her own utility; for
the first, it deserved rather a reward, for the second there was no law against
any stranger to do the like; she Anno 1617.
acknowledged to have received diverse favors of the Queen her Mistress in
whose service she had employed her whole life, and to receive favors from great
Princes was never held a crime till now; she often dehorted her husband from
some violent courses he took, which made her make a separation of her estate
from his, fearing that some funestous accident might befall him; but it being
granted that she had concealed the defauts of her husband, there was never any
law that could punish, much less condemn a wife for that; In conclusion, she
defended herself with that caution and courage, that many of the Judges were of
opinion that banishment was enough for her; but the quality of the times, and
state of things transported the Judges to extraordinary rigor.

Upon the Scaffold she carried herself with such a scorn of death, and with
that exemplary piety and patience, that she mollified the hearts of all the
spectators, and sent hundreds away with wet eyes, amongst whom were diverse of
those who had embrued their hands so barbarously in her husbands blood.

Vitry had the Truncheon to be Marshall of France hereupon, and out of the
ruins of Ancre Luynes raised his fortunes, which may be said to be three
stories higher, for he suddenly hois'd not only himself but his two brethren,
Cadenet and Brand, to an incredible height, which made one fix upon the Louure
gate this pasquil Aux trois Rois, at the the three Kings; some cried out that
the tyranny was not changed but only the tyrant; That the same Tavern stood
still, only it had a new bush.

Luynes had given him the Marquisat of Ancre, and all the Stable possessions of
the Marshal: but Du Vair a good while would not let it pass the Great Seal, in
regard that by an Arrest of the Court of Parliament all their Stable goods were
confiscated and reunited to the Crown, and he stood stiff in this until the
King had given him the Bishopric of Lysieux, and having then fixed the Seal,
the French Pasquin began to tell him, Et Homo factus sum; a little after the
King married his Favorit Luynes to the Duke of Montbazons daughter, He gave the
Duke twenty thousand pound sterling, and made him Governor of the Isle of
France, the Duke of Main being translated to Guyen.

The King desiring to be in good intelligence with all his Subjects, fell upon
a new reach of Policy by the advice of his Counsel, which was, that in regard
he had found that the Assembly of the States General brought with it more
trouble then utility, in regard of the discrepant humors and interests which
such a number of men of various conditions, Professions and Religions carried
with them, instead of the States General, he convokes an Assembly of notables
as he termed it, composed of some selected Persons out of every Order,
whereunto should be added some Counselor out of every Court of Parliament.
Which being fewer in number would not breed such a confusion; And this Assembly
should be equipollent to that of the States General, and their acts so
obligatory. To this end the Kings Writs were issued out, the day and place
appointed which was the City of Roven; All Anno 1617.
solemnly met there in the Archbishops Hall, where after the King, the
Chancellor made a grave Oration, that his Majesty's pious intentions to call
them thither, was to regulat and police the State, and to ease the Subject. The
first four days were spent in settling the ranks of the Deputies; and a great
clash fell twixt the Nobles, and the Deputies of Parliaments, whom the Nobles
said they had reason to precede, in regard they took them to be but Members of
the third Estate, but they disadvow'd that quality, and stood to their
Soverain Jurisdiction which extended over the Nobles as well as other persons;
nor could they be called the third Estate, because they never used to meet in
the Assembly of the States General; The Nobles alleged the luster of their
birth, the excellence of the Profession of Arms above the gown, strengthening
their cause with diverse other arguments: but the difference being left
undecided, the King resolved that the Nobles should be placed about the Person
of the King; but with this proviso, that it should not prejudice the second
rank they have by Fundamental right In the convention of the States General,
which is next the Clergy; and for delivering of Opinions, the King inordred,
that in matters concerning the Church the Clergy should vote first, in matters
of War the Nobles, in matters of Law the Officers of Justice, in matters of the
Revenue of the Crown, the Exchequer men, and Financiers.

In this Assembly were agitated and concluded many wholesome things; First,

1. That the Secret affairs of State be communicated to few, and those of known
probity, and prudence, for fear of discovery. 2. That the expense of the Kings
House, and the salary of Military men be regulated. 3. That Pensions be
retrenched. 4. That a course be taken to regulat gifts and rewards which are to
be made in silver. 5. That it be illegal to sell any Offices in the Kings
House, in War, or Government. 6. That reversion of Offices, and Benefices be
restrained, because it gives occasion to attempt upon the life's of the living
Incumbents, and takes away the Kings Liberty, to advance persons of merit,
taking also from the persons themselfs, the encouragement of doing better by
hope of advancement. 7. That the Annuel right be suppressed. 8. That the
venality of Offices be prohibited. 9. That small wrangling Courts, and the
number of Pettifoggers be retrenched, and that all causes be brought to the
Soverain Courts.
These in gross were the Results of this Assembly which proceeded with a great
deal of harmony, the King himself was present most of the time, and in his
absence Monsieur presided; There passed also a Law to permit the Jesuits to
open their College of Clermont in Paris, and to endoctrinat young youth in the
Sciences; But the Universitie of Paris to make this Edict illusory, made two
Decrees, by the first, it was ordered that none should be admitted to the course
of Theology, Anno 1618.
unless he have studied three years under the public Professors of the Faculty
of Theology in Sorbon; and that he be put to his oath not to have studied in
any other College. The second was, A prohibition to all Principals of
Colleges, for admitting any, but those that go to the Lectures of the
Professors of the said Universitie, and that none shall enjoy the Privileges
of Scholarity if he studieth not under those Professors. An indifferent moderat
man said that there was no way to end this quarrel, but that the Jesuits might
be united to the body of the Universitie, and so submit themselfs entirely to
their Laws and Ordinances.

We will conclude this luster with a horrible fire that happened in the City of
Paris in the chief Palace of Justice, it raged most in the great Hall where the
Lawyers and Counselors use to meet, where also the Statues of the Kings of
France are set up, and are ranked according to the times of their reign in
excellent Sculpture, all which were utterly reduced to cendres, with the Table
of Marble about which the Judges were used to sit; The cause of this fire is to
this day unknown; but it might be very well interpreted to be a visible
judgment from heaven upon that place and Palace for the hard measure of
Justice, the Marshall of Ancre and his Lady had received a little before; Which
makes me call to mind a Latin verse, I have read upon a Stat-House in Delph in
Holland, which had bin burnt in like manner and reedified, not one other house
about it receiving any hurt.

Cive, quid, invito, proh sola, redarguit usta
Haec Domus, illaesis aliis? --

An end of the second Luster.
The third Luster of the Reign of Lewis the thirteenth.
WE ended the last Luster with the end of the old Palace of Justice Anno 1619.
in Paris by an unknown furious fire, which made the disaster more horrid. We
will begin this with bone-fires of joy, for the Marriage of the Lady Christina,
second daughter of Henry the Great, to the Prince of Piedmont, who came in
Person to Paris to do his own business: he comported himself with that address,
that politenes, that bravery of spirit accompagnied with such gentleness, that
he gained much upon the French Nation; The business was not long a finishing,
for Henry the Great was well pleased with an ouverture that had bin made
formerly by the said Prince for the Eldest daughter, who was married to Spain:
She had for her Dower 1200. thousand French livers, which comes to one hundred
and twenty thousand pound sterling; besides the rich jewels she carried with
her. Anno 1619.


The Queen Mother was all this while at Blois; and some ombrages of distrust
hung 'twixt the King and her; for the Bishop of Lucon being by command removed
from her, Mounsieur Roissy was sent expressly by the King to attend her, whom
the Queen took to be no other then a kind of Spy, to watch over her actions;
nor was she invited to the marriage of her daughter, which was solemnized at
Paris; and with this marriage it seems the King did consummat his own by bedding
with the Queen his wife, which he had not done since he had married her at
Bordeaux almost four years before, where he lay with her only two hours; and
though this was done for fear it should hinder his growth, and enervat his
strength, yet there were some whispers that it was done with an intent to be
divorced from her, and Luynes was blamed for it; Hereupon he finding the King
one night inclinable, took him out of his bed in his arms, and casting his
nightgown over him he carried him to the Queens bed; The Nuncio, and Spanish
Ambassador were so joy'd at this, that they presently dispatched expresses to
carry the news, and bonefiers were made thereupon both in Rome, and Madrid, for
there were some surmises abroad that so long a separation from bed, would turn
in time to an aversion, which might draw after it a repudiation, and so a
divorce.

While the King was thus confirming his own, and celebrating his sisters
Nuptials in Paris, there were tidings brought that his Mother got out of Blois
Castle, and was conveyed away secretly in the night through a window which was
toward the moate, where she glided down a good height upon a counter scarp,
and so made an escape. The King had sent Father Arnoul the director of his
conscience a little before under color of complement to visit her, but the
design was to draw from her a solemn oath, that she would not come to the Kings
Court without his preadvertisement, and approbation, which oath she took upon
the Evangelists: He sent her also word, that he and the Prince of Piemont now
her son in law would come to visit her; but she knew well enough how matters
were carried at Court, and so she gave little credit to those endearments,
fearing there was too strong a drug under the pill.

Her escape was traced by Espernon the little Gascon Duke who had bin from the
beginning a great servant of Ladies, there had bin diverse clashings and
counterbuffs 'twixt him and the gown-men of the law; amongst others Du Vair the
then Lord Keeper and he could not agree; Du Vair did him ill offices to Luynes,
who began to malign him more and more. So the little Duke had two mighty
enemies at once, the one full of cunning, the other of credit with the King,
therefore being at the Town of Metz, the King sent him order not to stir
thence, because there were like to be wars in Germany; Espernon sent answer
that he being in the next place to Germany had received certain advice that
there are no commotions like to be there, that his Majesty's service, and his
own affairs were all in a disarray in Guyen, and that he knew not in what to
serve him there, unless it Anno 1619.
were to convey his packets to and fro; Therefore he humbly desired his
Majesty's permission to go for Guyen whither some pressing occasions called
him, and that La Vallette his son shall render him a good account of that place.

The Queen Mother and he had much private intelligence, and she sent him an
express to complain unto him of her hard condition, and withal she sent the
Original of a late Letter unto her from the King, wherein he permits her to go
to any Town or place throughout his Dominions (his own Court excepted), so in
conclusion she prays and conjures him as he was a Cavalier to help her out,
and conduct her to Angoulesme. The old Duke was glad of this advantageous
conjuncture of things, therefore without any further attendance of the Kings
pleasure, he suddenly leaves Metz commanding the Gates to be close shut for two
days after his departure, and so went toward the Queen Mother with a
resolution to intermingle his interests and dangers with hers; So he employed
le Plessis a confident of his, who received the Queen first of all out of the
Castle window* and conveyed her over the river in the dead of night, where she
met the Archbishop of Toulouse after Cardinal de la Valette with 15. horse, and
a little further the Duke himself with 60. great horse, for he would have no
more, for making too great a noise, so he attended her to Angoulesme.

The King resented to the quick this presumption and hardiness of the Duke,
who being asked how he durst venture upon so dangerous an enterprise, he
answered, Because I would have two cables to my Ship in a storm that was like
to fall upon me. The King hereupon frames an army to chastise the insolence of
Espernon; the Duke of Guyse was commanded to come from Province, and the Duke
of Mayn from Guien, to meet him about Angoulesme with forces. Some held it to
be a derogatory and unbefitting thing in the King to keep such a stir for to
have a revenge upon his own Mother, and upon a Vassal, and an old Officer of
the Crown, and so advised his Majesty to go thither with his ordinary Guards:
Others counseled him to separat the interests of the Queen Mother from the
Dukes, and to send a person of quality to her to dispose of her to a conformity
to his pleasure, and to leave the Duke to stand upon his own legs. To which
purpose diverse were sent unto her from the King, but in vain, for she could
never be brought to abandon the interests of Espernon who had exposed himself
to such dangers for her. Hereupon the Bishop of Lucon (afterward Cardinal of
Richelieu) who was retired to Avignon, and had been in great esteem with her
formerly, was sent for by the Kings command to atetnd the Queen, and being a
man of eloquence, and of powerful reasons, he molded the Queens mind as he
pleased, and fitted it for a reconciliation; being thus prepared, the King sent
Marossan unto her to assure her of the obedience and love of a Son; and withal
to demand of her a dimission of the government of Normandy for other places
which she should have in exchange. She as'kd Marossan whether Anno 1619.
he brought any letters from the King about that, he said no, because the King
at the first enterview would speak with her by word of mouth about it, but he
was resolved not to write to her: and why so? replied the Queen. Madame, said
he, I have not in charge to tell you the reason, but if you command me I will;
You will do me a pleasure, said she; It is, Madame, because the King having
written unto you a letter full of affection at Blois wherein he was willing you
might go into any other place within his Kingdom, you gave the letter to the
Duke of Espernon, thereby to afford him means to color his conveying you away
from Blois and conduct you hither; for fear therefore that you would do the
like again, he is resolved to write no more unto you of any matter of moment.

The Queen enlarged her self upon that subject, saying, That any body would do
as she did being in captivity, there being nothing that the brute animals
desire more then freedom, and therefore this inclination was not to be wondered
at in rational creatures; so she came to the point and conformed her self to
the Kings desires in every thing.

Matters being brought to this pass, the King suffered the Prince of Piemont
to go visit her, which he had long desired with much impatience; being come
with his brother Prince Thomaso near Angoulesme, Espernon with a hundred great
horse went to meet them, in a handsome equippage; The Prince stayed there some
days to wait upon his new Mother in law, and at his departure she gave him a
Diamond of high price which was the Emperor Ferdinands her Grandfather, and so
he returned to the King.

A while afterthere was an enterview appointed 'twixt the King and his Mother
at Cousieres a House of the Duke of Monbazons in Touraine; The Duke of Espernon
attended her to the farthest limits of his government, and at parting she gave
him a rich Diamond, conjuring him never to part with it, but that it might be
preserved from father to son as an eternal gage of her gratitude, and in
memory of the gallant and most signal service which he had rendered her to the
hazard of his life and fortune: The Duke used to wear the said Diamond
afterward upon his finger in a ring upon festival days which he said cost
him two hundred thousand Crowns.

The Queen being come to the place of meeting, Luynes who was now made Duke and
Peer of France, and Governor of Normandy, was sent from the King beforehand;
after his first audience the Queen brought him to her Cabinet where she melted
into passion, and complained of the hard usage she had received, which she
would quite forget; yet she could not refrain from falling still upon the
mention of her hard usage, which did her no good afterward, for Luynes thereby
feared that matters passed had taken such lasting impressions in her, that they
could never be defaced; and considering the vindicatif spirits of the Nation
whence she came, he still mistrusted if she returned to Court, she would
project some way of revenge, etc. The King came the next day in Coach with the
young Queen, his two Sisters, and the two Princes of Savoy, to the House where
the Queen was, and Anno 1619.
there was a complete glorious Court, the mutual demonstrations and postures of
tenderness which Mother and Son showed at their first enterview, melted the
hearts of all the Spectators. A few days after all parted, the King and his
Queen toward Paris, the Queen Mother to Angers, and the Princes of Piemont put
themselfs in their journey to cross the Alps.

A little after the Prince of Conde was enlarged, and the King sent him this
Letter by his Favorit. My Cosen, I will not tell you how much I love you, you
see it. I send my Cosen the Duke of Luynes unto you, who knows all the secrets
of my heart, and will open them unto you: Come away as soon as you can, for I
expect you with impatience, in the interim I will pray God to preserve you in
his holy grace.

Lovis.


Luynes having taken his oath as Duke and Peer of France in the Anno 1620.
Court of Parliament, he moved the King to perfect the number of the Cavaliers
of his Order, the Order of the Holy Ghost, who being an hundred by the
primitive institution were now diminished to twenty eight, so there were diverse
more created to the number of fifty nine, whereof Luynes two brothers Cadenet
and Brande were two: Luynes plot was to ingratiat himself hereby into the
Nobility, but it proved otherwise, for the Competitors that were excluded, grew
to be more bitterly his foes, then they who were instal'd Knights became his
friends. Much murmuring also was at his two brothers, this Order being the next
degree to bring one to be Duke and Peer of France. As the Ceremonies of these
new Knights were a performing, the two Princes of the blood, Conde and Soissons
being at Court, as the King was ready to sit down at diner, the Steward of the
Household delivered the towell to Soissons to give the King; Conde perceiving
it, would have had it from him, but he would not part with it, so they fell to
high words, one saying it was his right as he was prime Prince of the blood,
the other as he was gran Master of France; as they were debating the point in
hot terms, the King sent for his brother, to whom the Count of Soissons
delivered it; so with much ado the King made them both friends upon the place,
and the next day many hundreds of Gentlemen appearing on horseback, and offering
their service on both sides, there came out a strict Order from the King, there
should be no more stirring in the business.

It fortuned about this time that the young Queen fell sick, and there were
extraordinary Offices of devotion performed for her recovery, and a general
Procession Ordered, where the whole Court of Parliament assisted in their red
robes: The Queen being recovered she employed the fifteen thousand Crowns which
the King had given her for a ball to works of Piety and Charity.

The Kings Exchequer was at a very low ebb at this time, whereupon there came
out an Edict called the Bursall Edict which tended to raise money, and the King
mistrusting the verification of it by the Anno 1620.
Court of Parliament, went thither himself in great state, where the Lord
Keeper made a speech a bout it: The Prime President answered him boldly, That
the Court received violence to verify such Edicts without any precedent
deliberation, that being well assured of the goodness and justice of his Majesty
the Court imputed this disorder to ill counsel, and therefore desired the
names of them who gave him this damnable counsel should be given up and
registered in Parliament to be proceeded against accordingly; Servin the Kings
Advocat was more hardy, saying, That his Majesty did wrong himself to come to
Parliament to authorize by his presence, that which could not be done with
reason and justice.

Yet the Edict passed, and that afternoon, the Court of Parliament was
commanded to wait at the Louure, where his Majesty told them, That he was ill
edified by their Remonstrances, which he found very insolent; The Lord Keeper
told them, That to some ill purpose they thought to separat the King from his
Counsel, by blaming the one, and exempting the other, for being inseparable,
the offense must bring the blow upon both together, a thing not to be endured
by a Soverain Prince, who is to exspect punctual obedience from his subjects;
so the prime President making a large apology, at last they were dismissed,
with recovery of the Kings grace.

The prodigious and violent promotions of Luynes in dignity, power, wealth and
command, made him the object of envy to some, of hatred to others, of amazement
to all; nor was he contented to hoise himself so, but he must pully up his two
brothers along with him; so there was a kind of general coffeehouse
fomented in the hearts of the people, which was aggravated by the late shift
the King had made to get money, and the clash he had with the Parliament of
Paris; so men's minds were susceptible and ready to receive any impressions of
mislike against the present Government. The Duke of Mayn had a particular
coffeehouse, that Cadenet, afterward Duke of Chaune which was erected into
a Pairrie a Peership of France, had married the Heiresse of Peguigny, whom he
had sought for wife; so he with diverse other Princes started out and put
themselfs in arms; the Count of Soissons, Vendosm, and the Gran Prior of
France his brother (both natural sons to the last King) went to the Queen
Mother at Angers, who quickly entered into the league; They of the Religion
offered her conjunctive forces, which she waved, but the Duke of Mayn presently
accepted of them, which made his army swell to 12000. and upwards.

Hereupon the King sent the Duke of Montbazon to invite the Queen Mother to
Court, and to assist in Counsel, but she excused herself by indisposition of
body (though it was only of mind:) He sent again the Archbishop of Sens unto
Her with a second invitation to Court and he would meet her in the way as far
as Orleans, but she continued still distrustful, and jealous of some plot upon
her, thinking that

Fistula dulce canit, volucrem dum decipit Auceps. Anno 1620.
She inveighs bitterly against the present Favorits how they exhausted the
Kings Tresure, offended most of the Princes, and disposed of all offices and
honors, making men of mean extraction lately Knights of the Holy Spirit, and
excluding ancient Gentlemen of merit; these complaints she couched and enlarged
in two Letters, one to the King himself, the other to the Parliament of Paris,
which the Court would not open but sent them to the King.

The discontented Princes grew daily more and more powerful, so it was high
time for the King to get a Horsback, which he did, and marched first to
Normandy, where the Duke of Longueville had armed, having bin at the Parliament
of Roven, to tell them that the ground of his grievance, as of the rest of the
Princes, was the indirect and violent means that Luynes used to establish his
own authority, and advance his monstrous fortune, etc. Longueville
understanding the King was advancing to Roven retired to Diep with three
hundred Gentlemen, who thought to make the Town of Roven to side with them, but
the Kings presence scared them all away; There the King sat himself in
Parliament, and suspended Longueville of the Government of that great Province,
and put also diverse of his Accomplices out of Office; And so having secured
Roven, he went to Caen where the Gran Prior had put a strong garrison in the
Castle to stand for the Princes, Crequy had laid a siege to the Castle before
the King came, and held it hot play, for the Castle was extremly well fortified
both with bones and stones; The King immediately upon his arrival sent Prudent,
whom the Gran Prior had placed in the said Castle, a summon to render it,
Prudent refused, hereupon there was a Proclamation published, That whosoever
would bring Prudent living or dead unto the King, he should have a reward of
ten thousand crowns; This made Prudent tremble, and to apprehend some danger
within, as well as from without, for the sound of ten thousand crowns made a
mighty noise, and might work upon the garrison it self. So he sent to Crequy to
know truly of him, whether the King was there in person or no, For if he were,
he had rather die twenty deaths then hinder the triumph of his first arms, so
he gave up the Castle without capitulation, and the King pardoned all: some
gave advise to raze the Castle, but being built at first to stay and repel the
Forces of the English, and being fair, large and strong, it was suffered to
stand, for it might be serviceable again against that Nation.

The report of taking Caen Castle added much to the Kings honor, and struck a
terror in the Mutineers. He marched thence to Man's and thence toward Angers to
his Mother, in the way there were six or seven Castles that discharged their
garrisons, and ranged themselfs to the Kings obedience. Being at Man's there
came some Gentlemen to tell him from the Queen Mother that she was ready to
conform her self to his Majesty's pleasure, and therefore desired a Treaty with
this proviso, that all the rest who were now in Arms for her assistance might
be included in the Articles; The King sent her word, that as he distinguished
her Person from theirs who were now in rebellion against Anno 1620.
him, so he would separat her interests from theirs; for he well considered
that she was his mother, they but his subjects; qualities so distant, that it
was not fitting to confound them, and involve her in the same Treaty. Yet
nevertheles he was willing to be gracious to all for what was passed, provided
they would incontinently disarm, and implore mercy. Luynes also sent her a
Complement by the same messenger, That there was no desire so ardent in him, as
to see her again with the King, as well for her own contentment, as for the
repose of the Realm; But notwithstanding this gracious proffer, they stood
still in arms in Angers where there were eight thousand foot, and one thousand
two hundred horse well appointed, and a great confluence of Nobles. Angers
being a huge vast Town, and the royal Army being but sixteen thousand foot, and
one thousand five hundred horse, the Counsel of War determ'd, that it was more
advantageous to attaque Pont de Ce not far of, then lie down before Angers; So
Crequy was sent with fifteen Bataillons to that purpose, there was a furious
fight twixt the Sons Forces and the Mothers; at last the Son prevailed, and
entirely routed the enemy with slaughter of five hundred men; the next day the
Castle of Pont de Ce rendered it self; the garrison was used very favorably, and
all the Domestic Officers of the Queen Mother who had born Arms there, were
sent unto her for a present.

There was then a resolution to set upon Angers, but the King would not hearken
unto it while his Mother was in the Town; Hereupon She sent the Cardinal of
Sourdis, and the Bishop of Lucon to the King to tell him, That She threw
herself between his arms, to submit her will and all her inclinations to his
Commands, beseeching his Majesty that his grace might extend to all those that
had assisted her. The King condescended to every thing, passed an Act of
Abolition of all former faults, and the Articles of the Treaty were sent to
Paris to be verified by the Court of Parliament; So the Son and the Mother had
another enterview at Brissac, where their actions, port, gesture, words and
tears, wrought much upon the affections of all the beholders.

The King having in less then 40. days, quelled this dangerous rebellion
which like a Hydra consisted of many heads, his thoughts then reflected upon
the Ecclesiastic's of Bearn, who pretended, and had consequently petitioned
often unto him how much they suffered by them of the Religion; so he sent the
Queen to Paris, and he took the road of Bearn a frontier place toward Spain,
fastening Navar to the foot of the Pyrenean Hills; He took Saint John d' Angeli
in his way, where the Town complained of a Cittadell which the Duke of Rohan
would have built to keep them in captivity; He left a new Governor there
behind him, and sent to Espernon to have a care of the place; thence he went to
Blay (the key of Bourdeaux) where he deposed the Marquis of Aubeterre the
Governor, and giving him the Truncheon of Marshall, and 100000. crowns for
recompense, he put in his place Brentes third brother to Luynes after Duke of
Luxenburg: At Bourdeaux he made an Edict for the reestablishment of the Roman
Catholics Anno 1620.
of Bearn in their Primitive possessions, and sending it to Pau where the chief
Council of Bearn resides to be verified, they refused to do it
notwithstanding two jussions of the King to that effect.

Jane d' Albret, Henry the Greats Mother, first planted the Reformed Religion
in Bearn, taking the revenues of the Roman Clergy to maintain the Ministers,
she reigned diverse years, and her son Henry the Fourth succeeded, who after he
was King of France reestablish'd a few Bishops there, who gave some
satisfaction for the time: The present King his son, out of a greater zeal to
Rome, would put all things in statu quo prius, and would have the Church lands
entirely restored, and for the maintenance of the Reformed Ministers he was
willing to part with eighty thousand Franks yearly out of his own revenue: Yet
the Counsel of Pau would not ratify his Edict, which Counsel was divided to
three opinions.

1. The first opinion was utterly to reject the Kings Edict, and to detain
still the possessions of the Church. 2. Others thought it was fit to give the
King some contentment, but in appearance only, and to verify the Edict,
assuring themselfs that it could never be put in execution, it would meet with
so many difficulties. 3. Others thought it best to delay the verification to
another time.
The King understanding that they were thus chopping of Logic, and that the
Synod also which was there then sitting, did mainly resist the verification of
his Edict; He resolves to go thither himself, though many dissuaded him from
the journey by reason of the uncouth ways, the sorry lodgings, the waters in
some places poisoned by Sorcerers, and the scarcity of provision, in the Lands
of Bourdeaux. But none of these reasons could deter the King, therefore he
prepares for his voyage, and in the interim he sent a person of quality to the
Rochellers to acquaint them with the Elusory answers which the Bearnois made to
his commands, and therefore he advised and required them to have nothing to do
in this business; They of Rochell little regarding what the King said, but
undertook the protection of the Bearnois.

The King being advanced in his journey near Pau, the Inhabitants sent to know
how he would be received, the King asked if there were ever a Church in the
Town, if there were, he would enter as their Soverain, if not, he would receive
no honor in a place where God Almighty had no House to be honored in, so he
entered without any Ceremony; They of the Religion making three parts of the
people forbore to send Commodities to Pau Market during the Kings sojourn
there, to constrain him to go away the sooner; so that his train made hard
shift to subsist all the while.

He goes thence to Navarrenz seven leagues nearer the hills, a strong tenable
place having 45. pieces of Ordnance, and 40. Culverins, the old Governor
Bertrand de Sales sent the keys of the Town to the King, where he peaceably
entered contrary to all expectation; he put in a new Garrison of French there,
and placed another Governor, giving Anno 1620.
for recompense to the old 60000. Franks: He also caused Mass to be sung there
which had not bin done fifty years before; so having settled all things at
Navarrenx he returned to Pau, where the great Church which they of the Religion
had turned to a Temple was restored to the Priests, and two thousand crowns
given for satisfaction; In fine having cast the Church into its old mould, and
the Military with the Civil Government into a new, and leaving a competent
strength with La Force to preserve both, he took post, and came safely and
triumphantly to Paris in a few days.

The Bearnois made their addresses to the French Churches, and exhibited their
complaints unto them, and for their justification they alleged two reasons.
One was a possession of fifty years continued without interruption of those
revenues the King had ravished them of. The second was, an Ordinance of the
States General of Bearn confirmed by a Declaration of Henry the Great to that
effect.

The Roman Catholics answered, That for the possession they speak of, it was
violent* and accompagnied with rebellion and felony; Touching the Assembly of
the States General which they urged, it was altogether illegal, because the
first and most noble part which was the Clergy was excluded by a cruel
persecution, and for Henry the Great, he was then himself a persecutor of the
Catholics.

The French Reformed Churches which are near upon eight hundred, did much
resent the usage of the Bearnois, thereupon there was a great Assembly held at
Loudun without the Kings permission, wherein they resolved to assist their
brethren of Bearn.

They drew up Cayers or papers to present unto the King containing sundry
demands. 1. The first, that his Majesty would please to revoke his arrest given
in favor of the Ecclesiastiks of Bearn. 2. A continuation of their Cautionary
Towns four years longer, the time being now expired. 3. They demanded leave to
change two Governors which were turned Catholics.

When these Papers were presented to the King, he sent their Deputies word by
Conde and Luynes that his will was, that first of all they should separat the
Assembly, and six months after their separation they should be favorably
answered. They prayed this promise might be digested in writing to an Act; they
were answered, That it was an indecent and derogatory thing for a Monark to
treat in that manner with his subjects, as if his word were not sufficient: The
Deputies received little satisfaction in this, so they returned to Loudun where
the Assembly continued still notwithstanding two Declarations published by the
King, wherein they were commanded to separat upon pain of being proclaimed
Traitors.

They little valued the Kings Declarations, but dissolving their Assembly at
Loudun, they sent summons up and down to meet at Rochell, where in a greater
eagernes, and zeal to the Cause then before, they solemnly convened,
notwithstanding another new Prohibition of the Kings verified by the Court of
Parliament in Paris; Hereupon the business was put into deep deliberation at the
Counsel of State, whether Anno 1620.
the King should declare war against the whole body of the Religion, or
particularly against those that had met at Rochell: and the latter opinion took
place, for these reasons.

1. First, it could not stand with justice to force consciences to quit that
belief which had bin so long tolerated. 2. Secondly, that declaring a war
against the whole body of them of the Religion might bring in foreign aid. 3.
Thirdly, that if a war were pronounced in general, many of the Kings best
servants would be involved therein, and provoked, as the Duks of Trimoville,
Bovillon, Lesdigueres, Suilly, Chastillon, Brassai, Montgomery, Blamville, with
diverse other of his best sort of subjects.
The King in regard his Treasury was much drained was loath to Anno 1621.
plunge himself in a serious war again the Rochelers, therefore to comply with
them, he accorded a continuation of their cautionary Towns for five years
longer, notwithstanding that they demanded but four. He also gave them leave
to change the Governor of Lectour Castle, and to choose a new Counselor in the
Parliament of Paris, two things they insisted much upon, but they prevailed
little with them unless the late Edict of Bearn were revoked: Hereupon the
Gran Assembly at Rochell reinforced it self, and went on more roundly then
ever, there were also up and down the Country diverse other meetings, as
Synods, Colloquies, Circles, and demy-circles which convened, and consulted.

They of Rochell went higher and higher, they had a new public sealemade, they
established a new Court of Admiralty, and stamped new Coins: They made 47.
Ordinances, which were printed, and commanded to be strictly observed through
all the Reformed Churches: They nominated Governors of Provinces, and imposed
taxes at pleasure.

The King was much incensed at these traverses, yet nothing could move him to
declare war against the whole body of them, notwithstanding that he was offered
six hundred thousand crowns yearly by the Ecclesiastics, viz. two hundred
thousand by the Pope; two hundred thousand by the College of Cardinals, and
two hundred thousand by the French Clergy.

La Force whom the King had left Governor of Bearn, did not put the Kings
commands in execution as he expected, therefore the Duke of Espernon was sent
thither with an Army, and settled all things according to the Kings pleasure,
and made La Force quit the Country, who was proclaym'd Traitor, and the
Marshall of Themines put in his place; though afterward La Force recovered his
repute with the King, and received the Truncheon to be Marshall of France, and
grew to be a great Confident.

The King having now taken a resolution of war against the Rechellers, intended
to make a Lord High Constable of France, thereupon it was offered the old Duke
Le'sdigueres provided he would go to Mass, which he waving, Luynes undertook
it; which drew much more envy upon him then formerly.

The King put out a Declaration that it was not against Religion, but Anno 1621.
against Rebellion that he proceeded, therefore he offered to take into his
protection all those Reformed Churches that would contain themselfs within the
bounds of their obedience to him, and not adhaere to the Assembly at Rochell;
which Declaration was verified in Parliament with much solemnity: so he marched
toward the Loire, and being near Saumur a Town of the greatest consequence
that the Reformed Churches had, he sent to Monsieur du Plessis Mournay that he
desired to lodge in the Castle that night with his Queen; The old Governor
being above eighty years of age was so surpised with this Message that it put
him to his wits end, for he made full account the King would have lodged in the
Town, as other Kings had; and as he was consulting what to do with much
perplexity, the Guard of Swisses were at the Castle gate; so he peaceably let
them in, the King followed presently after, who charming the old man with
complement, made him discharge his Garrison; so the Castle and City was secured
for the King. Yet the Governor which he left in the Castle was a Reformist, who
was the Count of Sault, Monsieur Crequy's son.

The reductiono and assurance of Saumur was a mighty advantage to the King for
the advance of his present dessein, in regard that Saumur for her situation was
one of the importantst Towns that they of the Reformed Religion had, in regard
it tied Normandy, Britany, Anjou, and Mayn, with Poitou, Tourain and other
Countries circumjacent, where they were strongest, besides it lay upon the
Loire, and it was the probablest place to stop the Kings passage, which they
endeavored to do afterward at Saint John d' Angely.

From Saumur the King marched to Touars a Town of the Duke of Trimovillies
where he was received with all honor and obedience by the Duchess in the Dukes
absence; from thence he passed through diverse Towns of the Reformed Religion,
where in some places he changed the Governors, so he came to Moart where
Paraberre the old Governor afterward turning Roman, entertaind him with all
kind of compliance.

So he found little or no opposition at all till he came to Saint John d'
Angely where Soubize had cast himself in with 1500. men; a formal siege was
planted before the Town. The King had 15000. foot, and 2000. horse, the flower
of the Cavalry of France, and Espernon came with 4000. foot more of Gascons and
Bearnois; A Herald of Arms was sent to summon Soubize, who being let a little
in at one of the gates in his rich coat he pronounced alowd these words: To
thee Benjamin of Rohan, Lord of Soubize, I come and command thee in the Kings
name my Soverain Lord and thine, to open unto him the gates of this Town, to
deliver it unto him as his own, and to go out presently with all those that
assist thee, otherwise I declare thee a Rebel and a Traitor against Divine and
Humane Majesty in the highest degree, thy Houses and Castles to be razed, thy
goods confiscated to the King, and I declare thee and all thy posterity Yeomen.

Soubize answered, That he was a most humble servant and subject of the Anno
1621.
Kings, but being there in quality of a Soldier, the execution of the Kings
commandment depended on the Assembly of Rochel, who had committed unto him the
Government of the place; this he spoak with his hat on, thereupon the Herald
replied, Know that neither as Captain, or Soldier, thou oughtst to answer me
with thy head covered, when I speak to thee in the name of the King thy
Soverain Lord and mine. Then Haute Fontaine took the word, saying, That the
Lord Soubize having never seen such summons, was excusable. This Answer and
carriage of Soubize that he should prefer an Ordinance of the Assembly, before
his royal Declaration, nettled the King extremley, so the siege was poursued
very eagerly, a mine or two sprung, and a general Storm appointed, but in the
interim there were Deputies sent to Constable Luynes to Treat, he sent them
back with this Answer, that the King did not use to Treat with his Subjects:
Hereupon they returned with Commission to implore grace, so the King published
a short Proclamation to this effect. That his Majesty being contented to admit
of a Treaty, at the most humble supplication many times reiterated by them
which are in the Town of St. John d'Angely (or Angerry) he was pleased to
vouchsafe a general pardon to all, provided they ask it, and swear, never to
bear arms again against his service, etc. So they came out and Soubize kneeled
unto the King and promised to observe the conditions his Majesty required.

Thus Saint John d' Angely was yielded upon Saint John Baptists day the Patron
of the place after forty days siege, which was furious and very hot for the
time, diverse Lords and Gentlemen of quality lost their lives there, the Prince
of Ienvill was hurt, so was the Duke of Elbeuf, the Marquis de la Valette, de
Saint Claumont, Crequy, with diverse others; The Cardinal of Guyse fell down at
the puff of a Canon bullet which put him in such a burning feavor that he died
before the Town, as also the Marshall of Brissac: The King commanded a Convent
of Capuchins to be built forthwith, the walls to be razed, and commanded it
should be called no more a town, but a village; and to be named Lewis-Bourg.

The rendition of this town, was seconded with good news from the Prince of
Conde and the Count of Saint Paul who had taken Gergeau, and Sancerre, which
with Saumur, were all they had upon the Loire.

While the King was before Saint John d' Angely, a remarkable passage happened
twixt Sir Edward Herbert now Baron of Cherberry (then Ambassador for his
Majesty of great Britain in France) and the great Favorit and Constable Luynes:
which was thus. Sir Edward Herbert had received private instructions from
England to mediat a Peace for them of the Religion, and in case of refusal to
use certain menaces; hereupon he coming to the Army, and finding the approches
to the said Town were almost finished, he hastened his addresses to the King for
an audience: The King referring him to Luynes, and desiring that what he had to
say might be first imparted unto him, he went accordingly to Luynes lodgings,
and delivered his Message so, Anno 1621.
that he reserved still the latter part, which was menace, until he heard how
the business was relished; Luynes had hid behind the hangings a Gentleman of the
Religion, who was upon point of turning Roman, that being an earwitnes of what
had passed between the English Ambassador and Luynes, he might relate unto them
of the Religion what little hopes they were to expect from the intercession of
the King of England: The Ambassador and Luynes having mingled some Speeches,
the language of Luynes was very haughty, saying, What has your Master to do
with our Actions? Why does he meddle with our affairs? Sir Edward Herbert
replied. It is not to you to whom the King my Master owes an account of his
Actions, and for Me it is enough to obey Him. In the mean time, I must maintain
that the King my Master has more reason to do what he pleases to do, then you
have to ask why he does it; Nevertheles, if you desire me in a gentle fashion,
I shall acquaint you further. Whereupon Luynes bowing a little said, very well;
The Ambassador answered. That it was not on this occasion only, that the King
of Great Britain had desired the Peace and prosperity of France, but upon all
other occasions whenever any troubles were raised, in that Country. And this
he said was his first Reason. The second was, That when a Peace was settled
there, His Majesty of France might be better disposed to assist the Palatin in
the affairs of Germany. Luynes said, We will none of your advices. The
Ambassador replied, That he took that for an Answer, and was sorry only, that
the affection and good will of the King his Master was not sufficiently
understood, and that since 'twas rejected in that manner, he could do no less
then say, that the King his Master knew well enough what he had to do. Luynes
said, We are not afraid of you; The Ambassador (smiling a little) replied, If
you had said you had not loved Us, I should have believed you, and made you
another Answer; In the mean while, all I will tell you more is, That We know
very well what we have to do. Luynes hereupon rising a little from his chair
with a fashion and a countenance much discomposed, said, By God if you were not
Monsieur l' Ambassadeur, I know very well how I would use you; The Ambassador
herewithall rising also from his chair said, That as he was his Majesty's of
Great Britains Ambassador, so he was also a Gentleman, and that his sword,
whereon he laid his hand, should do him reason if he took any offense: After
which Luynes replying nothing, the Ambassador went on his way toward the
door, to which when Luynes seemed to accompagny him, the Ambassador told him,
that after such language, there was no occasion to use ceremony, and so
departed, expecting to hear further from him. But no message being brought him
from Luynes, he did in poursuance of his instructions demand audience of the
King at Cognac, St. Iean d' Angely being now rendered, who granting it, where he
did in the same terms, and upon the same motives Mediat a Peace for them of
the Religion, and received a far more gentle Answer from the King. The Marshall
de Saint Geran coming to Sir Edward Herbert told him in a friendly manner, you
have offended the Constable, and you are not in a place of surety here,
whereunto he answered, That he held himself to be in a place of surety,
wheresoever Anno 1621.
he had his sword by him.

Luynes little resenting the affront he received from Sir Ed. Herbert, got
Cadenet his brother Duke of Chaune with a ruffling train of Cavaliers, near
upon a hundred, (whereof there was not one, as Cadenet told King James, but had
killed his man in duel) Ambassador extraordinary to England a little after, who
misreporting the clash 'twixt Sir Ed. Herbert and Luynes, prevaild so far, that
Sir Ed. Herbert was presently revoked, to answer the charge that should be laid
against him. In the mean time the Earl of Carlisle that dexterous Courtier was
employed extraordinary Ambassador to France for accommodating le mal entendu
which might arise 'twixt the two Crowns; Carlisle was commanded to inform
himself of the truth of the business before mentioned, and he could meet with
no relation but what Luynes had made himself: wherein more affronting and
haughty expressions were laid to Sir Ed. Herberts charge then had truly passed,
for though the first provocation came from Luynes, yet the Ambassador kept
himself within the bounds both of his instructions and honor; but as my Lord of
Carlisle was ready to send this misinformation to England, the Gentleman
formerly spoken of who stood behind the hangings, came to the Earl of Carlisle
and said, that he owed so much unto truth and honor that he could do no less
then vindicat Cavalier Herbert from all indiscretion and unworthines, and
thereupon related the true circumstances of the business. The Earl of Carlisle
being thus rectified in the knowledge of the truth, gave account to King James
accordingly, who cleared Sir Ed. Herbert, and resolved to renvoy him Ambassador
to France, whereof he having notice, kneeled to the King before the Duke of
Buckingham, and humbly desired that since the business was public in both
Kingdoms he might in a public way demand reparation of M. Luynes: for which
purpose he beseech'd his Majesty that a Trumpeter if not a Herald might be sent
on his part to M. de Luynes to tell him That he had made a false relation of
the passages before mentioned, and that Sir Ed. Herbert would demand reasons of
him with sword in hand on that point; the King answering that he would take it
into consideration. Luynes a little after died, and Sir Edward was again sent
Ambassador to France.

But to return to our former road, besides those places formerly mentioned, the
Towns Suilly, Merac and Caumont were also taken for the King, but the latter
two by the Duke of Mayn Governor of Guyen: All Poitou being reduced to Royal
obedience, and settled, the King resolved to go for Guyen to suppress the Duke
of Rohan and la Force who were in arms, and had a considerable Army: He left
behind the Duke of Espernon with 4000. foot, and 600. horse to beleager
Rochell, and stop the advenues in the interim. So he advances to Guyen, and
diverse places in the way opened their gates unto him, till he came to Clairac,
where he found a tough resistance; He lost before the Town the great Lord of
Thermes, and sundry persons of quality besides; in so much that he would give
no general pardon but reserved five for Anno 1621.
death, and there were most pitifully drowned and killed in the Town above
800. whereof there were above 200. Gentlemen.

The King having reduced Clayrac, though it cost him dear, his thoughts then
reflected upon Montauban which after Rochell was the prime propugnacle, and
principallest Town of security They of the Religion had in the whole Kingdom.
There was a Royal summons sent before, and it was accompanied with a large
persuasive Letter from the Duke of Suilly (who was one of the chiefest Grandes
they had of the Reformed Religion) to induce them to conformity and obedience;
some interpreted the Letter to a good sense, but the populasse, by the
instigation of the Ministers, would not hearken to it; This was that Duke of
Suilly that had bin a Favorit to Henry the Fourth, whom he had reduced from a
Roman to be a Reformist when he was King of Navar only, and persuading him to
become Roman again, the Duke bluntly answered; Sir, You have given me one turn
already, you have good luck if you give me any more: Thereupon the siege began,
and the great Duke of Mayn who had newly come with additionall forces to the
King began the first battery and spent 500. Cannon bullets upon them, a breach
was made, but with loss of diverse men of note amongst the Royallists; the
Marquis of Themines breathed there his last: And not long after the brave Duke
of Mayn himself peeping out of a gabion within his trenches, was shot by a
common soldier from the Town; The Parisians were much incensed for the loss of
the Duke of Mayn, therefore as some of the reformed Religion were coming from
Charenton-Sermon they assaulted them in the way, hurt diverse, killed some, and
going on to Charenton, they burnt the Temple there; but a few nights after two
great bridges ore the Seinn were burnt quite down to the water in the City of
Paris, and a great store of wealth consumed, and it was interpreted to be a
just judgment from Heaven for burning of Charenton Temple.

The Duke of Angoulesm was sent to counter-car the forces of the Duke of Rohan
who was then in motion in Guyen, and Angoulesm was so succesfull that he gave
him a considerable defeat, by taking the strong Fort of Fauch, in defense
whereof 400. of the Reformists were slain.

The contagion raged furiously in the Kings Army before Montauban, and diverse
persons of quality died of it, amongst others the Archbishop of Sens brother to
Cardinal Perron, and the Bishops of Valentia, Carcassona, and Marseillis, and
Pierre Matthieu the Historiographer added to the number of the dead. This, with
the approach of Winter caused the King to raise his siege from before the Town,
having lost above five hundred Noblemen and Gentlemen of quality, besides
thousands of common soldiers.

During this pertinacious siege before Montauban there was a remarquable thing
passed, which was this. There was a cunning report raised in the Kings Army
that Rochell, which was then also beleaguered by the Count of Soissons, and the
Duke of Guyse, the first by Land, the Anno 1621.
other by Sea, was rendered upon composition; this report was made to fly into
Montauban, which must needs strike a shrewd apprehension of fear into her; they
of Rochell hearing of it, articled with Master Hicks an English Gentleman (now
Sir Ellis Hicks) who spoke the Language perfectly well, that if he would
undertake to carry a Letter into Montauban, he should receive a noble reward;
Master Hicks undertook it, and passing through the Army that was before Rochell
came to Toulouse, where my Lord of Carlisle was then Ambassador extraordinary*
Master Hicks meeting with Master Fairfax a young Gentileman (brother to the now
Lord Fairfax) he did associat much with him; They both went to see the siege
before Montauban, and being Gentlemen and thought to be of the English
Ambassadors train, there was little heed taken of them; They got one day
between the Kings Trenches and the Town, and Hicks being very well mounted told
Fairfax, If you love your life follow me, so he put spurs to his horse and
having showers of shots powered after him he came safe to the gates of
Montauban, and so he delivered the entrusted Letter, which brought news in what
a good posture Rochell was; this so animated the besieged, that the next day
they made a sally upon the Kings Forces; and did a notable execution upon them,
and a little after the Siege was raised; so Master Hicks besides the honor of
the act had a guerdon equal to the importance of the service, and danger of
the attempt; but Master Fairfax (who was inscious of the dessein) staying
behind and being apprehended, was put to the torture, and a Diaper napkin dipped
in boiling water was squeaz'd down his throat, whereof he died: a hard destiny
of a most hopeful young Gentleman.

Within the compass of this year there died Paul the Fifth, Philip the Third of
Spain, the Archduke Albertus in Flanders, Cosmo de Medicis Gran Duke of
Toscany, and Cardinal Bellarmin* To whom may be added also the Duke of Luynes
Lord high Constable of France, who died in Longuetille, a small Town in
Languedoc, of the purple feavor; He was one of the greatest Favorites, for so
short a time, that ever were in France, since the Maires of the Palace from
whom Emperors afterward issued; His Country was Provence, and he was a
Gentleman by descent though of a petty extraction; In the last Kings time he
was preferred to be one of his Pages, who finding him a good waytor, allowed him
three hundred crowns per an. which he husbanded so frugally, that he maintained
himself and his two brothers in passable good fashion. The King observing that,
doubled his pension, and taking notice that he was a serviceable instrument,
and apt to please, he thought him fit to be about his son (the Dauphin) in
whose service he had continued above 15. years, and by a singular dexterity he
had in Faulconry he gained so far upon the young Kings affection, that he soard
to that high pitch of Honor. He was a man of a passable understanding, of a
mild comportment, humble and debonnair to all suitors, but he was too open in
his counsels and desseins; he had about him good solid heads who prescribed
unto him rules of policy, Anno 1621.
by whose compass he steered his course; He came at last to that transcendent
altitude, that he seemed to have surmounted all reaches of envy, and made all
hopes of supplanting him frustrat, both by the constant strength of the Kings
favor, and the powerful alliances he had got for himself, and his two
brothers: He married the Duke of Montbazons daughter; his second brother
Cadenet the Heiresse of Pequigny with whom he had 9000. pound lands a year: His
third brother married the Heiresse of Luxemburg, of which House there have bin
five Emperors; so that the three Brothers with their alliances were able to
counterbalance any one Faction in France: He left two living Monuments of his
greatness behind him, which were his two brothers, one whereof was Marshall, but
both of them Dukes and Peers of France.

The repulse before Montauban, and the death of Luynes gave some matter of
resentment to the King for the present, but he quickly passed it over: And
having settled matters to his best advantage in Guyen, he returned to
Bourdeaux, and so came to keep his Christmas at Paris.

The Spring following he gets a horseback again, and it was high time for him,
in regard there was a general insurrection of them of the Religion both in
Dauphine, Languedoc, Guyen and Poitou. In the last Soubize had got a
considerable army of 7000. foot, and 600. horse, and 9. Pieces of Ordnance.

The King parts from Paris upon Palm Sunday which was cried up to be a good
augury that he would return with the Palm the Emblem of victory; so marching to
Poitou, he found out Soubize entrenched in certain little Islands called Rye
and Perier: upon the Kings approach Soubize abandons the place, and with a few
Horse got along the sands to Rochell; the whole Army being thus left headless,
in a fearful consternation all began to fly, and some thought to save
themselfs through the Marasse, where many hundreds miserably perished, those
that stayed behind the King were pardoned, only 13. were hanged for example,
and they were some of those that had taken an oath at Saint John d' Angely
never to bear arms against the King; there were killed and drowned in all above
two thousand Reformists in this rencounter.

After this Royan was rendered after a pertinacious siege; and a great slaughter
on both sides; The King thence marches to Guyen, where the Duke of Elbaeuf had
done diverse exploits; Insomuch that in a short time all the towns of Guyen were
reduced to the King except Montauban; amongst others there were three towns
called Tonnenx knotted one in another, which were utterly extinguished, with
prohibition for any ever to build there again. Being in Carcassona upon his
March to Montpellier, there were two signal things done, Soubize was
proclaimed Traitor for flying to England to solicit for foreign aid; And old
Lesdeguiers, was made Constable of France; Chastillon also a little after came
to be Marshall for giving up Aiguemortes; the first had that high Office,
provided he would go to Masso, which he did; but Anno 1622.
the last persisted still in his Religion.

The King appeared now in Person before Montpellier, and a great deal of earth
was thrown up by his Pioners before he came, the trenches being almost
finished, there were diverse furious Sallies from within* and Assaults from
without happened in this Siege, and many gallant Gentlemen lost, amongst others
the young Duke of Fronsack unic son to the Count of Saint Paul, was condol'd
with much regret. And the King was like to have had the same fortune there,
which he had before Montauban, had not the Duke of Vendosme come with a timely
supply of five thousand fresh combatants.

The Duke of Rohan, and Constable Lesdiguieres, old in years and new in Office,
had private meetings; the former going into the Town, carried the business with
that power, and wrought so far upon the affections of the Inhabitants of
Montpellier, that he made them inclinable to let in the King, provided that
their fortifications might continue entire, and that they might be exempt from
Citadel, Governor or Garrison, upon such terms, they with the whole body of
the Religion would conform themselfs to a general Peace, which was a little
after proclaimed before Montpellier in form of an Edict, to this effect.

That the Edict of Nants, with the secret Articles thereunto annexed should be
inviolably kept, as under the reign of Henry the Great; That the exercise of
the Catholic Roman Religion should be reestablish'd where it has bin
interrupted, and the Ecclesiastics restored to all their goods; That likewise
they of the Reformed Religion should exercise it freely in all those places,
where it was practiced before these commotions* That all new fortifications
should be demolished, specially in the Islands of Re and Oleron, and the old
walls only stand; That all Assemblies particular and general be prohibited to
them of the p: Reformed Religion for the futur, unless it be upon affairs
purely Ecclesiastic, under pain of the crime of Treason; That an abolition be
granted of every thing passed except of those execrable cases reserved by the
Article 86. of the Edict of Nants; That Catholics as well as Reformists be
chosen promiscuously in civil Offices, etc.

This being done, the Deputies of the Reformed Churches coming to attend the
King, they were made to stoop at the entrance of the Kings lodging, and
afterward having first desired pardon, they presented the Keys of the Town unto
him; So the next day he entered the Town, and having settled all things
thereabouts, the King went to Provence, and so to Avignon the Popes Town, where
the old Duke of Savoy came to visit him; Thence he returns to Lion, where he
found the two Queens; The Prince and Princess of Savoy came also thither to
attend him. Geneva likewise sent thither her Deputies, who made an Oration to
the King upon their knees all the while. From Lion He came triumphantly to
Paris to begin the new year, 1623. in Peace, after such a long Martial progres.

While the King was himself in person up and down Poitou and Guyen to repress
them of the Religion; the Duke of Guyse by Sea, Anno 1623.
(who had an Auxiliary Fleet of eight of the King of Englands Ships joined with
him for which the Duke of Buckingham was afterward questioned in Parliament)
and the Count of Soissons by Land did pinch the Rochellers; Soissons raised up
a strong tenable bulwark, which he called Lewis-fort, that commanded the
Channel Sea-ward, and gave the law by Land.

The general Pacification published at Montpellier was but a piece slightly
plastered over, it was far from searching the bottom, from cleansing and
curing the wound, for many discontents reigned still amongst them of the
Religion, they complained that Lewis-fort before Rochell was not demolished
being a new fortification, and they spoak of other grievances; the King on the
other side complained, they had not reestablish'd the Ecclesiastics in their
Primitive possessions, nor chosen Catholics in Civil Offices.

This being profoundly debated in the Counsel of State, some, as the
Churchmen, and Nobles, gave their opinion, that, rather then to be in such
continual trances and alarms, his Majesty should with his main entire strength
apply himself to extinguish both the Rebellion and the Heresy (as they termed
it) totally together, as the effect with the cause; because his Majesty was not
in case to do any thing abroad, while they were left so strong at home, for as
one of the Counselors said, He that has thieves to his neighbors dares not
go far from home.

Others were of a contrary opinion, that it was very requisite there should be a
general peace now 'twixt the French people, because of the business of the
Valtolin, where the Spaniard had a purpose to block out France in all places
toward Italy, which was very necessary to be prevented, so that it was not fit
to enfeeble France at this time by attempting to extinguish them of the
Religion, and to plunge the whole Country in an intestine war, for it was as
if one would cut off his left hand with the right. This last counsel took more
with the King, and so he left no way unessayed to reunite all his subjects:
Hereupon to content the Reformists, he caused their Temples to be reedified, he
appointed 60000. Franks for the payment of their Ministers, and permitted them
to call a Synod at Charenton, with diverse other acts of compliance; provided,
that on their part they should entertain no strangers for preachers, nor admit
Ministers into politic Assemblies.

In these difficulties and anxious traverses of things, the King made Anno 1624.
the Cardinal of Richelieu his principal Minister of State, chief of his
Counsel, and Director general under his authority in the government of the
State. He made this election by the advice of the Queen Mother principally, nor
was it an improper choice, for the party had a concurrence of high abilities in
him, answerable to that transcendent trust: and he proved, as will appear by
the sequel of things, a succesfull Instrument; though many doubt whether his
Counsel was as succesfull to France, as it was fatal to the rest of
Christendom, which he has plunged in an eternal war: touching this we leave
the Ingenious Anno 1624.
Reader a freedom of censure, according as his judgment shall be guided by an
unpartiall, and unbiased relation of matters, as they ly connected in the
ensuing part of this story.

Thus our third Luster concludes, with the commencement of Richelieus greatness.
The fourth Luster of the Life of Lewis the thirteenth.
WE began the last luster with the espousals of the Lady Christina, Anno 1625.
second daughter of France, with the Prince of Piemont, this begins with the
marriage of the Lady Henriette Marie de Bourbon, the youngest Royal branch of
Henry the Great; and this was the first great act that the Cardinal of
Richelieu performed, after he was come to the superintendency of affairs of
State.

France had two causes of perpetual apprehensions of fear, one external,
the other internal; The still growing greatness of Spain without, and They of
the Religion within doors, which were made frequent use of by any discontented
Princes upon all occasions; and were cried up by the Jesuits to be as Matches
to set France on fire at any time; Therefore the first gran dessein that he
projected with himself was to clip their wings, and diminish their strength, by
dismantling their Cautionary Towns, and making them dismiss their Garrisons:
The Cardinal knew the King his Master did not affect them since the Treaty at
Lodun, wherein they forced him to put another interpretation upon his
Coronation Oath, then his conscience did dictat unto him, or the Prelat, who
administered it unto him, meant; which appeared in a churlish answer that he
gave them not long after when he was solicited to prolong the term of holding
their Cautionary Towns as Henry the Third, and Henry the Great his father had
done. Which answer was, That what grace the first did show you, was out of
fear, what my father did, was out of love; but I would have you know, that I
neither fear you nor love you.

To compass that great work of taking from them their Garrison Towns, it was
thought very expedient to secure foreign Princes from assisting them, specially
England, and the united Provinces; Touching the latter, they were charmed with
money; for in a fresh Treaty, the King accorded them a million of Franks, and
six hundred thousand Franks every one of the two years next ensuing; which they
were to re-inburse the next two years that they should conclude a peace or
truce with Spain. The Holland-Ambassadors who were employed in this Treaty did
promise the King that there should be liberty of conscience given the
Catholics at his Majesty's request; That Anno 1625.
the States should associat the French with them in the commerce of the Indies,
give them some choice ports for traffic, and repair some depraedations they
had made by sea; but the money being once got, there was little care taken to
perform these promises; which were no more then parol engagements or rather
complements; whereupon an Ambassador was expressly sent to complain hereof,
but he effected little.

To secure England from succouring Them of the Religion, the first overture
that the Erl of Holland made for an alliance was yielded unto; to whom the Erl
of Carlisle was sent in joint commission to conclude it; The King told them,
that he took it for an honor, that they sought his sister for the sole son
of so illustrious a King his neighbor and Allie; only he desired that he
might send to Rome to have the Popes consent for better satisfaction of his
conscience, and in the mean time the English Ambassadors might send for a more
plenary power to England; so in less then the revolution of nine moons this
great business was proposed, poursued and perfected, whereas the Sun ran his
carreer through the Zodiac ten times before that Spain could come to any point
of perfection; This may serve to show the difference twixt the two Nations, the
leaden heel'd pace of the one, and the quicksilver'd motions of the other; it
shows also how the French is more round and frank in his proceedings, not so
full of scruples, reservations and jealousies as the Spaniard: And one reason
that the Statists of the time alleged why Spain amused the English, and
protracted the Treaty of the Match so long, was, that all the daughters of
France might be first married to prevent an alliance 'twixt England and her.

There was a concurrence of many things that favored the effecting and
expediting of this alliance: some previous Offices and Letters of invitation
from France, wherein there were strains of extraordinary endearments, wherewith
the King of Great Britain corresponded also in an unusual style, as appears by
this Letter following.

Most high, most excellent, and most puissant Prince, Our most deer, and most
beloved good Brother, Cosen and ancient Ally: Although the deceased King of
happy memory was justly called Henry the Great, for having re-conquer'd by arms
his Kingdom of France, though it appertained unto him as his proper
inheritance; Yet you have made now a greater conquest; for the Kingdom of
France though it was regained by the victorious arms of your dead father, it
was his de jure, and so he got but his own: But you have lately carried away a
greater victory, having by your two last Letters so full of cordial
courtesies, overcome your good Brother, and ancient Ally, and all the Kingdoms
appertaining unto him; for We acknowledge Our self so conquered by your more
then brotherly affection, that We cannot return you the like: only we can
promise and assure you upon the faith of an honest man, that you shall have
always power not only to dispose of Our forces and kingdoms, but of Our heart
and person, and also of the person of Our son if you have need, which God
prevent: praying you to rest assured that We shall not only be far from
cherishing, or giving the least countenance to any of Anno 1625.
your subjects, of what profession soever of Religion, who shall forget their
natural allegiance unto you, but if We have the least inkling thereof, We
shall send you very faithful advertisement: And you may promise your self that
upon such occasion, or upon any other which may tend to the honor of your
Crown, you shall always have power to dispose freely of Our assistance, as if
the cause were Our own; so upon assurance that Our interests shall be always
common, We pray God, most high, most excellent and most puissant Prince, Our
most deer, and most beloved Brother, Cosen and Ally, to have you always in
his most holy protection. Newmarket 9. of February, 1624. Your most affectionat
Brother, Cosen, and ancient Ally,

James K.


The Critiques of the time did much censure this Letter in regard King James
seems to dis-invest himself utterly of all Title to France thereby, because he
confesses Henry the Fourth to have not only reconquer'd it, but to have a
natural right unto it in the said Letter.

The former Treaty for the Infanta of Spain did facilitat also the hastening of
this business, and made it less knotty, in regard that the matrimonial
capitulations which in effect were the very same with those of the Infanta's,
had bin beaten and molded a long time before upon the Spanish Anvill, and so
made smooth and passable: They were in substance these that follow.

1. That the French King should make it his business to procure a dispensation
from Rome within three months. 2. That for the celebration of the act of
affiancing, the King of Great Britain should depute whom he pleased, and that
it be done according to the Roman rites. 3. That the marriage be solemnized in
the same form as that of Queen Margaret, and the Duchess of Bar was. 4. That
she be attended to the Sea side upon the charge of France. 5. That the contract
of marriage be publicly ratified in England without intervention of any
Ecclesiastic ceremony. 6. That free exercise of Religion be granted unto Madam
her self and all her train, and to the children that her servants shall have.
And to that end they shall have a Chapel in every one of the Kings Royal
Houses, or any where else where she shall keep her Court. 7. That preaching, and
the administration of the Sacraments of the Mass, with all other Divine
Offices be permitted Her, as also the gaining of all Indulgences and Jubils
from Rome; and that a Churchyard be appointed walled about to bury Catholics
according to the Rites of the Roman Church, all which shall be done modestly.
8. That she shall have a Bishop for her Almoner who may have power to proceed
against any Ecclesiastic under his charge according to the Canonical
constitutions: And in case the Secular Court shall seize upon any Churchmen
under his jurisdiction, for any crime which concerned not the State, he shall
be sent back to the said Bishop, Anno 1625.
who taking cognizance of the delict, shall degrade him, and so return him to
the Secular power; and other faults, all Churchmen under him, shall be sent to
him to be proceeded against accordingly, or in his absence to his Vicar
general. 9. She shall have 28. Priests of her House, and if any be a Regular
he shall be allowed to wear his habit. 10 The King of Great Britain and his
son shall oblige themselfs by Oath not to attempt any thing upon the conscience
of Madam to induce her to renounce her Religion. 11. All her domestiques shall
be Catholics and French which she shall bring with her, and in their rooms
when they die, she shall be allowed to choose other French Catholics but with
the consent of the King of Great Britain. 12. Her dowry shall be eight hundred
thousand crowns, whereof the one moity shall be pai'd the yeeve after Contract,
the other a year after, and in case she survive her Husband the said dowry
shall be entirely returned her whether she desire to live in England or France.
13. But if there remain any children of this marriage, then she is to have back
but two thirds of the said dowry. 14. And in case Madam die before the Prince
without children, the moity of the said dowry shall be only returned, and in
case she leave children all shall go amongst them. 15. Madam shall be endowed
with a jointure of eighteen thousand pound sterling per an. which comes to
sixty thousand crowns: and his Majesty of Great Britain shall give her besides
the value of fifty thousand crowns in Jewels, whereof she shall have the
property, as of those she has already, and of what shall be given her
hereafter: He shall be also obliged to maintain her and her House, and in case
she come to be a widow, she shall enjoy her dower, and jointure which shall be
assignd her in Lands, Castles and Houses, whereof one shall be furnished and
fit for habitation, and that the said jointure be paid her wheresoever she
shall desire to reside: she shall have also the free disposing of the Benefices
and Offices belonging to the said Lands, whereof one shall have the title of
Duchy or County. 16. That she shall be permitted whether she have children or
not, to return to France, and bring with her her movables, rings and jewels, as
also her dowry, and the King shall be bound to have her conducted to Calice
upon his charge. 17. The contract of the marriage shall be registered in the
Court of Parliament of Paris, and ratified in that of England. 18. All her
servants shall take this following Oath, I swear and promise fidelity to the
most gracious King of Great Britain, to the most gracious Prince Charles, and
to Madame Henriette Marie daughter of France, which I shall most faithfully and
inviolably keep; And if I know of any attempt against the said King, Prince,
and Lady, or their estates, or against the public good of the Kingdoms of the
said King, I shall forthwith denounce the same to the said King, Prince, and
Lady, or others who shall have it in Anno 1625.
charge. This was the substance of all the Matrimonial capitulations which
were digested to 28. Articles, with a penalty of four hundred thousand crowns
upon either of the two Kings which should infringe any of them. Besides these,
there were some private Articles accorded in favor of the Roman Catholics in
England and Ireland, but far from the latitude of a public Toleration.
Upon the ending of this great Treaty with France James the First of England,
and Sixth of Scotland ended his life in his Palace at Theobalds; A little
before, he broak out into a very passionate Speech to his Lords of the Counsel
of the King of France; saying, My Lords, the King of France has writ unto me
that he is so far my friend, that if ever I have need of him, he will render me
Offices in Person whenever I shall desire him; Truly, he has gained upon me
more then any of his Predecessors, and he may believe me, that in any thing
that shall concern him I will employ not only my peoples life's, but mine own;
and whosoever of his subjects shall rise against him either Catholics or
others, shall find me a party for him: It Is true, if he be provoked to infringe
his Edicts, I shall impart as much as in me lies, by counsel and advice to
prevent the inconveniences.

Then falling upon the perfections of Madame Henriette Marie, he said
pleasantly, When she is come over I will denounce war against her, because she
would not read my Letter, nor my sons, as I understand, before she had first
received command from the Queen her Mother; yet I have cause to thank her,
because that after she had perused them, she put mine in her cushionet, and the
other in her bosom, intimating thereby that she would rely upon me (for
counsel) and lodge my son in her heart.

King Iame's death retarded a while the proceedings of the Match, for things
were at a stand till his Exequies were passed, which were performed with a
Magnificence suitable to so great a King.

This Ceremony being ended a procuration was sent the Duke of Cheureuse from
his Majesty of Great Britain to be contracted unto the Lady Henriette and then
to marry her in his name, which was done with extraordinary celebrity, the one
in the Louure, the last in the great Church of Paris by the ministry of the
Cardinal Rochefaucaud; a little before there was a clash twixt him and the
Bishop of Paris, who urged, it was his right to officiat in his own Church, but
the Cardinal being a Prince of the Church Universal, being also gran Almoner
which makes him chief Clark of the Court, and Cardinal Richelieu, who had now
the greatest stroke in the State, favoring his own habit and the Hat more then
the Mitre, the Cardinal carried the day: This solemnity was performed to the
very height of greatness and splendour; and such was the bravery of the English
Ambassadors the Earls of Carlisle and Holland, that they seemed to outshine the
French that day in their own Sphere; One half of the dowry had bin delivered
before upon the Contract, which was in all, as was said before, eight hundred
thousand crowns, and it was more then the eldest Sister had by two hundred
thousand crowns, and double as much as the second Anno 1625.
had, the one having but six hundred thousand, the other but four hundred
thousand crowns to their portions.

The Contract and Marriage being thus finished, the Duke of Buckingham came a
fortnight after with admired gallantry, to demand the Queen of Great Britain
for the King his Master, and to attend, and conduct her over to England. The
Queen Mother accompagnied her as far as Amiens, Monsieur her Brother to Bullen,
whence a Fleet of twenty Galeons Royal transported her to Dover.

This was the eighth Nuptial conjunction of the Rose and Flowerdeluce that
has happend 'twixt England and France.

The first was in the year 900. 'twixt Charles the First of France, and the
Lady Ogine daughter to Edward the old King of England, 120. years before the
Norman conquest.

The second twixt Henry the Third of England, and Margaret daughter to Lewis
the Seventh of France.

The third was between Edward the First of England, and the Lady Margaret
daughter to Philip the Hardy of France.

The fourth 'twixt Edward the Second of England, and Isabel daughter to Philip
the Fair.

The fifth was 'twixt Richard the Second of England, and Elizabeth daughter to
Charles the Sixth.

The sixth 'twixt Henry the Fifth of England, and Catherin daughter also to
Charles the Sixth of France.

The seventh was 'twixt Lewis the twelfth of France, and Mary daughter to Henry
the Seventh of England.

The eighth was this 'twixt Charles Stuard Prince of Wales, and Henriette Marie
of Bourbon youngest daughter to Henry the Great: so in these eight Matches
England has had six daughters of France, and France two of Englands.

As soon as this great Nuptial pomp was passed, there came tidings that
Soubize upon a new discontent of them of the Religion, had a great Fleet of
ships at Sea, and surpised the Port of Blauet in Britany, which is a fair and
large Haven deposited to the Spaniard in time of the Ligue, and restored to
Henry the Great at the peace at Vervins; Soubize enterd the Haven with eleven
Sail of men of War, and took and carried away six great ships whereof some
belonged to the Duke of Nevers. This rendered them of the Religion powerful at
Sea, and because their Ships might have choice of harbors, they seized upon the
Islands of Re, and Oleron where they began to fortify. Soubize sails up the
Garond toward Bourdeaux with a Fleet of seventy sails of all sort which made
him Master of the Sea, and landing a considerable number of land forces at the
land of Medoc, they of Bourdeaux joining with Toiras sent him a shipboard again
with loss, and so he returned to Rochell.

A little after he sets out to Sea again, and takes diverse prises, extremely
interrupting all traffic on those Coasts; Hereupon the King sent to the
Hollander to hyre twenty Sail of men of War, according Anno 1625.
to the late Treaty; which were accordingly sent him under Admiral Hauthain;
These joining with another Fleet of the Duke of Monmorency made a considerable
naval power; Monmorency was very eagar to set upon Soubize and the Rochell
Fleet, but he found the Hollanders bacward and cold, being charmed by Letters
and a Remonstance annexed unto it sent to Hauthain by two French Ministers, and
two Dutch Merchants from Rochell, wherein they made piteous complaint that the
King had performed little or nothing at all of the Treaty before Montpellier,
and that the utter ruin of the whole body of the Religion (which was the same
with that of Holland) was intended, therefore they did efflagitat, and conjure
the said Admiral Hauthain to lay his hand on his heart and conscience, and not
to contribute to so damnable a dessein.

This Remonstrance wrought much upon Hauthain and Dorp his Vice Admiral, in so
much that he publicly declared unto the Duke of Monmorency that he had
Commission in express terms from his Masters the States, to reduce Monsieur
Soubize to his duty, either by reason or force; that he understood how he was
ready to conform himself to the first, and to that effect he and his Brother
the Duke of Rohan with other Towns of their party, had Deputies employed to the
King to desire Peace which was in a good forwardnes; therefore it was needless
to force them to their duty, which were willing to do it of their own motion.

So the Hollanders refused to fight, yet the Rochell fleet not fully knowing
their intention fell unwares upon them and burnt their Vice Admiral, but
attempting to board some French, they were repulsed with the loss of three
hundred men, and four Barks full of hurt men: this nettled Hans, and afterward
seriously he joined with the French Royal Fleet, which had received an
addition of seven English Ships under the command of Chevalier de Ris, and
twenty two more under the Marquis of Royan; so that the whole number coming to
sixty six sails, they divided themselfs to three Squadrons: In the first was
Monmorency and Hauthain; Dorp commanded the second, and the third was under
Manty Monmorency's Vice Admiral: Soubize had got into the Isle of Re where he
had entrenched himself, but a considerable Army of the Kings landing there,
there were diverse furious and bloody skirmishes, wherein there fell on Soubizes
side above eight hundred; and so many more drowned in flight: The Royallists
also lost there a great number, but they made themselfs Masters of the Island;
Soubize got away in a Shallop, and (as the enemy gave out) left his hat and
sword behind him, so he went to England.

There was also a great Sea fight near la fosse de loy'e where the Royallists
took nine ships, burnt one, and attempting to board their Admiral, called the
Virgin, and being grappled with her, all that were upon the upper deck being
killed, they who had got under hatches desperately put fire in the Gunpowder,
and blew her up with three hundred souls in her, whose members floted
afterward up and Anno 1625.
down the waves, a piteous and horrid spectacle to see: three of the Kings
ships being grappled with her were also burnt. The Duke of Monmorency, the Isle
of Re being already reduced, went then to Oleron which he took and secured for
the King.

While these fearful traverses of war happened before Rochell, the Duke of
Rohan was very busy in Languedoc; and entertained a Treaty with the Spaniard,
but Camredon his Agent was surpised, and had his head chopped off at Tholous.
Constable Lesdigueres was upon point of passing the Alps with an Army at this
time to Italy; but the commotions of Languedoc were such that he was diverted,
and commanded to march thither against the Duke of Rohan; The King endeavoring
to win Rohan by acts of grace offered him a prime command in the Army that was
to go for Italy against the Spaniard, and his brother Soubize the command of
ten Galeons, but the motion was not hearkened unto. Espernon and Themines did
diverse exploits up and down Languedoc this year, specially before Montauban,
where they of the Town lost eight hundred men in two sallys they had made.

They of the Religion being now much quail'd by diverse ill successes they had
received by Sea and Land, had recourse to the King with a submissive querulous
Remonstrance of their miseries. He that brought it seemed to reproach the
Rebellion in general, but he excused the Rochellers, declaring ore tenus to the
King, How they were bereft of their Privileges, how their Walls were battered,
their Vines plucked up, how their Tillage ceased, and their Traffic was ruined;
And while others of his Majesty's subjects have slept in their beds under the
public faith of peace, they have watched upon his walls to repel the injuries
of a particular war; In fine this usage being capable to make wild the gentlest
spirits has made them apprehend the blow of their utter ruin. It is true,
that they had bin forced to put the law of necessity in practice, which they
do not allege to justify themselfs, they have rather words of execration
against those subjects which dare raise arms in Prejudice of their Princes
under what pretext whatsoever; but only to make his Majesty see that they have
held it necessary to do well, in doing ill, and that they are more worthy of
pity then pain: Thus they accused themselfs, and were come hither to crave
pardon of his Majesty: whom they adjur'd and beseech'd by his Royal natural
goodness, and by the glory their ramparts have gained to have conserved his
Majesty in the reigns of Henry the Great, to restore them to liberty, and to
forget their faults, etc.

Upon this Petition the King intended to show them some Grace, but with this
Proviso, to separate the Rochellers from the conditions he vouchsafed to the
whole body of the Religion that they might be the more humbled, and so to take
from them the presumption they used to attribut to themselfs to have a kind of
authority over the rest, and from the other Churches the confidence and repute
they had of them; so by reiteration of diverse supplications they obtained at
last these conditions. 1. That the Counsel and Government of Rochell be put in
the hands of the body of the Town as it was 1610. Anno 1625.
2. That they receive an Overseer of Justice, to hinder dissensions and
factions. 3. That all new Bastions and Fortifications be demolished, and that
she be reduced to her ancient circuit, 1560. 4. That his Majesty shall be
received into the Town with all due respect and reverence whenever he please.
5. That they of the Town shall not keep any Vessels of War in their Haven, and
those that go abroad in course and to traffic shall ask leave of the Lord
Admiral. 6. That the goods appertaining to Ecclesiastics, be restored, etc.

These being sent to Rochell, Montauban, Castres and other places were
accepted, and a public Act passed; That the foresaid conditions were taken as a
most special testimony of his Majesty's clemence.

There followed a great calm in France after this, and all forces were
withdrawn from before Rochell, except the Garrison in Lewis Fort. So the King
had now opportunity to look abroad, and the first place he cast his eye upon
was the Valtolin, and the Grisons, which border upon Milan: The King of Spain
and the Archduke Leopold his Cousin german, were called in there to preserve
the Catholics from the oppression of the Protestants who were powerful, so
coming to the said assistance they took diverse old forts and erected new which
they secured with Garrison: The Spaniard hereby had an extraordinary advantage
to convey any forces from Italy to Germany upon all occasions.

The Protestant Grisons had recourse to the King of France, and he undertook
their protection (according to an old league in Lewis the twelfth his time) not
as much out of any great good will he bore them, but to deprive the Spaniard of
that advantage, therefore he sent the Marquis of Caeuures Ambassador to the
Cantons of Suisse that were Allies to France to exhort them to defend the
Valtolins. Caeuures from Ambassador was made General of an Army a while
after, and the Venetians with the Duke of Savoy ligu'd with him; He performed
diverse exploits there, so that the Truncheon of Marshall was sent him; The Pope
interposed also in this business, and had Forces there, and there were sundry
skirmishes fought; The Spaniard told the Pope lowdly, That he came thither to
conquer Heretics, and the places which he had taken from them were by
consequence justly acquired, and so might be justly kept, howsoever it was
reason he should hold them until his charges were reimbours'd: Hereupon
Cardinal Barberin was sent to France to accommode things, but little could be
done for that time.

This War of the Valtolins begot another twixt the Duke of Savoy and Genoa, the
principal motive whereof was to divert the Spaniard from the Conquest of the
Valtoline. Yet the Savoyard alleged that the Genois usurped diverse places from
him, that they had offered him some indignities, in defacing and vilifying his
picture; whereby they imitated the Leopard who by the natural hatred he bears
to man uses to tear his image with his ongles and teeth, when he cannot
exercise his fury upon his body. The old Constable Lesdiguieres notwithstanding
that he had one foot in the grave, yet it seems he had Anno 1625.
an ambition to die in the field, therefore he made earnest instances to the
King, that he would be pleased to employ him against the Genois; Hereupon he
clammer'd over the Alps to Piemont, where he with the Duke of Savoy made an
Army of twenty five thousand foot, and four thousand horse, which they powered
into the territories of Genoa; The Constable with Crequy his son in law had the
Vantgard; The Duke with the Prince of Piemont seconded, and they marched
several roads; The French took Capriata which was taken by Storm; and all were
put to the sword and plunder: the inhumanitie whcih the Soldiers exercised
upon the women, and maids raised an ill odor of the French in Italy; He took
diverse other places; And the Duke of Savoy on the other side rendered himself
Master of sundry strong holds; In the interim there were three Spanish vessels
which sailing from Barcelona to Genoa, were by distress of weather forced upon
the Coasts of Marseilles, and being out of any Port of commerce they were
seized upon by the Duke of Guyse, hereupon the Genois made a loud complaint in
Madrid, and the King of Spain resented it so much, that a Proclamation issued
out to Arrest all French vessels that were in any haven of Spain, and also to
seize upon all the Merchants goods; and it was thought there were near upon two
hundred thousand French then dwelling or trading in Spain, and eighteen
thousand in Madrid it self of all sorts of Merchants and Pedlers. In
correspondence to this; The French King published a Declaration wherein he
interdicted all commerce to Spain.

The violent progress of the French and Savoy Army against Genoa awaked all
the Princes of Italy; thereupon the King of Spain arms mainly, in Milan and
Naples. The Emperor also sent a considerable number of horse and foot, and all
conjoined under the Duke of Feria, who was made General by Land, and the
Marquis of Santacruz came with twenty two galleys, and five galeons by Sea
with four thousand combatants from Sicilie to secure the sea of Genoa, who had
eighteen galleys besides in course, and ten thousand men by Land; upon the
appearance of this great Army, most of those places which had rendered themselfs
to France and Savoy, opened their gates to the Spanish army at first approach;
They ravaged the country of Monferrat up and down, and came thence before Ast
a considerable frontire town of Piemont. Yet though there were five or six
armies in motion that Summer in Italy, there was no battle fought, but only
sieges, and leagers, sallies and skirmishes; The approach of Winter brought a
suspension of arms; afterward a Treaty was appointed at Monson, and twenty
Articles interchangeably accorded unto: so the War ended, and a Peace was
renewed twixt all Parties.

The Duke of Savoy was neither himself, nor by his Ambassador or Anno 1626.
Deputy present at this Treaty, which made him complain highly of the King of
France, taxing him with infraction of Faith, and of the late Confederation
between them: thereupon the King sent Monsieur Bullion to him in quality of
Ambassador to make an Apology, Anno 1626.
that his Highness should not impute this to ill faith, or any disrespect of
him, or to any particular advantage his Majesty hoped to receive thereby for
himself; therefore his Highness should not except at the light omission of
complements which had more of exterior appearance, then sincerity. Bullion
having notice that the Duke would give him a solemn open audience in the
presence of most of his Lords and Counsel, prepared himself accordingly; and
being come into the room, the little Duke began to speak very high language,
thereupon Bullion told him in his ear, That he perceav'd his Highness to be
moved, therefore he prayed him (not as an Ambassador, but as a private man and
his servant) to speak of so puissant and illustrious a Monark with that
moderation, respect and reservednes, that his Majesty might not be offended,
and if his Highness thought to satisfy himself by words of advantage, nothing
would remain unto him but repentance so to suffer himself to be transported by
a disordred passion: For the main business, the King having obtained by the
Treaty at Monson all that he and his Allies could hope for if they had gained a
battle, as also the liberty of the Grisons and the Valtolines, his
Confederates ought not to take offense if he as the Eldest, had treated himself
alone for his Cadets, a title which they had reason to esteem for honorable:
Yet if notwithstanding these considerations his Highness desired to have
satisfaction in a stricter way he would undertake his Majesty should make him
amends. In the interim he wished his Highness to think upon any thing wherein
his most Christian Majesty might be advantageous unto him.

The Duke being calmed by these words, answered, that he thought upon Royalty,
and if his Majesty would approve of his design (being already well assured of
the Popes good will) he cared not much for other Potentats, and he would be
contented to be treated by the King, in the same manner as the Kings of France
were used to treat the Kings of Scotland and Navarr: By Royalty he meant the
Kingdom of Cypres, which title the Ambassador told him could not be had
without distasting the Republique of Venice, (whose adoptif son he was) and
whereas he pretended some places in Toscany, that could not be done without
displeasing the Queen Mother.

The King having disposed already of his 3. Sisters, began to think on a Match
for Monsieur his Brother; now it is the style of France to call the Kings sole
Brother Monsieur without any further addition, to distinguish him from others;
Marie of Bourbon daughter to the Duke of Monpensier was thought to be a fit
wife for him; hereupon the King moved it unto him, but he desired time to
consider of it, because it was a business of the greatest consequence that
possibly could import him, for a wife is the best or worst fortune that can
befall a man in the whole course of his life: There were some that whispered him
in the ear to dissuade him from the said Match, amongst others the Marshall of
Ornano his Governor, who told him, That if he married in France, all his Means,
Credit and Fortune would be bounded there, whereas if he married some foreign
Princess, he might have some support, and a place to retire unto abroad upon
hard usage at home, which would Anno 1626.
make him better esteemed.

This being brought to the Kings ear, Ornano with diverse other were taken out
of their beds in the dead of night, and clapped in the Bastile; hereupon
Monsieur went to the Chancellor d' Haligre, and reproached him to have
counseled the King to have his Governor plucked away from him so; the
Chancellor excused himself, and denied that he had given such counsel; The King
having notice of this poor answer of his Chancellor, sent the next day for the
Seals, willing him to retire to his Country house; The Duke of Vendosm and
his brother the gran Prior were thought also to do ill Offices in this business
which made them fall into some dislike, and so they were committed prisoners to
the Castle of Ambois; amongst other things wherewith Vendosm was charged, one
was, that he should say he would never see the King again but in picture; so
he was put out of the government of Britany, which was conferred upon Marshall
Themines. Cardinal Richelieu having drawn a great deal of hatred upon himself
about this match, he had a guard allowed him, which was afterward recented
according as the measure of envy and danger accrued. The King being at Nants
in Britany to settle that Government, told his brother that he much desired he
were married to Mademoiselle Monpensier for the good of his state, assuring him
that he should find his own advantages in it: Monsieur answered, That if his
Majesty judged that it would be for the good of his state he entirely conformed
himself to his pleasure; thereupon he sent a long complement to Mademoiselle
Monpensier, concluding that he would prove a better Husband to her, then he was
a servant: So the Articles of Marriage were drawn, and Monsieur was to have for
his appannage the Duchy of Orleans with other places to the sum of one hundred
thousand franks annual rent, all charges defrayed, so much more in pension,
and by special warrant five hundred and sixty thousand franks yearly upon the
receipts of Orleans; which comes in all to about seventy thousand pounds
sterlin per annum: so the Cardinal of Richelieu betrothed and married them the
next day at Nants with as much solemnity as the place could afford.

At this time there were whispers up and down France of diverse plots that were
to be put in execution; some gave out the King intended to repudiat the Queen;
Others, that there was a design to clap up the King in a monastery, and that
Monsieur should reign; of this plot there was a whisper the mother was, because
she always seemed to love the younger better then the elder. But I believe
this was a groundless surmise.

There were diverse in prison that would have persuaded Monsieur to a foreign
match, and endeavored to cross this; Amongst others the Count of Chalais was
one, who was beheaded at Nants, and there being no headsman in the town, a
prisoner that was in for a capital crime, undertook the office provided he
might have his pardon, but he managed the instrument so ill that he gave the
Count thirty four strokes before he could separat the head from the body.
Anno 1626.


Sanctarellus the Jesuit obtruded to the world dangerous tenets about this
time, viz. That the Pope has power to depose the Emperor, to admonish, and
punish with temporal pains other Princes, and absolve their subjects from
their Oath of fidelity in case of heresy. The book was burnt in Paris; Father
Cotton Provincial of the French Jesuits, brought a public instrument from the
chief of the College of Clermont wherein their Society did disadvow, and
detest the said opinion of Sanctarellus, which instrument was commanded to be
put upon Record.

It was an ancient custom in France before the erection of Sedentary
Parliaments whereof there are eight, to assemble once or twice every year the
States General, which Assembly was first called Parliament, wherein they treated
of the highest Affairs of State, of making levies of money for the Kings
extraordinary occasions; for punishing corrupt Magistrates, and questioning any
Officers whatsoever upon the relations which were made by the Deputies or
Members of the said Assembly, which were called in old times Missi Dominici,
viz. Those who were sent by the Lord or King; This, as I said before in the
second Luster, is equivalent to the High Court of Parliament in England, though
in number it be inferior to it, in regard that this General Assembly of France
consists but of four hundred and odd members, that in England of near upon
seven hundred. Since the settling of the said Sedentary Parlements, this Great
Parliament has bin seldom convok'd in France unless during the minority of the
King: for which the Country has suffered much; in regard this universal
convention was used to keep good correspondence 'twixt the Prince and his
people, and the pecuniary levies which passed by their Suffrages were given
with more cheerfulness, and besides there was no need of so many Collectors
and Receivors as are employed in the Kings ordinary Revenu, which are so
numerous that the fourth part is drunk up among Officers in fees and wages; so
that there hardly comes into the Kings Coffers clear a Quardecu in every
Crown. This Assembly of the three Estates in France grew to be very rare, and
in a manner obsolete, since the Kings had power given them to impose public
assessments, the ground whereof was this; When the English had taken such firm
footing in France that they had advanced as far as the Loire, and besieged
Orleans, the Assembly of the three States in these pressures being not able to
meet after the ordinary manner by reason of the interposition of the enemy up
and down, that power which was formerly inhaerent in the three States of making
Laws and assessing the subject with subsidiary taxes, was transmitted to the
King himself during the war, which continuing long, that entrusted power grew
in tract of time so habitual, that it could never be re-assum'd or the Kings
disvested of it: And that which made the business more feasible for the Kings
was, that the burden fell most upon the Comminalty, the Nobility and Clergy not
feeling the weight near so much: And it happened in so favorable conjuncture
of time that the Clergy and Nobles were contented to have the Peasans pulled
down a little, Anno 1626.
because not many years before in that notable rebellion called la Iaquerie de
Beauvoisin which was suppressed by Charles the Wise, they boldly put themselfs
in arms against the Nobility and Gentry to lessen their greatness: Add hereunto
as an advantage to the work, that this power being first transferred to Charles
the Seventh, there succeeded him, a notable cunning King, Lewis the Eleventh,
who knew well how to play his game; for amongst all the rest he was said to be
the first who put the French Kings horce de Page, out of their minority or from
being Pages any more, though thereby he brought the Peasans to be worse then
Laquais.

Out of some distaste the King took at the last Convention of the three Estates
which was upon his entrance to his Majority, he resolved to summon them no
more, yet because he might be in good intelligence with his people, a way was
projected to call an Assembly of Notables which should be equivalent to the
States General though fewer far in number, and some out of every one of the
Provincial Sedentary Courts of Parliament were chosen to join with them: such
an Assembly as this was held in Roven (as we mentioned before) which did little
good, therefore the King was advised to convoque such another at Paris this
year which was done accordingly. They met in the great Hall of the Twilleries
where the King spoak to them thus:

We protest before the living God, that We have no other aim or intention but
his honor, and the good and ease of Our subjects: therefore in his Name We
conjure and pray you whom we have here convoqued, and, by that lawful power
which is given Us over you, We command and expressly enjoin you that without any
other respect, or consideration whatsoever, without regard of pleasing or
displeasing any person, you would afford Us with all freedom and sincerity
those counsels which you shall judge in your consciences to be most wholesome
and convenient to the advancement of the public good. The Cardinal de
Richelieu also made a long rhetorical Oration (which you shall find in the
legend of his life hereunto annexed) but there was no great advantage accrued
to the public by this Assembly of Notables though it lasted from the second of
December, to the twenty fourth of February following.

This year a passage happend in the Court of England whence ensued ill-favord
consequences, and no less then a war afterward 'twixt the two Nations; which
was this, The train of French servants which the Queen of Great Britain had
brought with her at her first arrival was suddenly dismissed to the number of
one hundred and twenty; In regard of no good offices they did twixt the King
and Queen, and for some petulant bold misdemeanurs of theirs, by imposing also
certain odd superstitious penances upon the Queen in prejudice of her health:
Besides, his Majesty of Great Britain having settled a Royal jointure upon her
of near upon one hundred thousand crowns a year out of the choicest Demeans,
Royalties and Houses he had in England, the Bishop of Mende sought to be
Surintendent, and steward Anno 1626.
of her lands, and others of her French servants expected to have Offices in
that kind, which the King would not hearken unto in regard the said French were
unfit for those extern employments having not the Language, or knowledge of the
Laws and Customs of the Country, therefore he desired them to rest contented
with the domestic Offices they had about the Person of the Queen; they made a
show to be satisfied herewith, though palpable discontentments appeared in
their countenances and carriage afterward more and more. So they were suddenly
discharged, and summoned to quit the Kingdom, and there should be order taken
for all conveniences for their journey by Land and Sea, and the arrears of
their wages and pensions were punctually paid them.

The Queen for the present took much to heart the renvoy of her servants, and
the King her brother resented it also when notice was sent him, though it was
nothing to be wondered at, for he himself had discharged the Spanish servants
his Queen had brought with her not long after she came, in the same manner.

The King of England dispatched a Messenger of honor to the Court of France to
give a true information of matters, which affoorded but little satisfaction;
Thereupon Marshall Bassompierre was sent Ambassador extraordinary to England
expressly about this business, but matters were thrust so far off the hinges that
they could not be set right again so soon. The French began the first act of
hostility, and that before any public Declaration was published, by seizing a
great number of English and Scottish ships at Blay, as they were returning from
the vintage with cargazons of wines from Bourdeaux, but the Scots were
released, the English still stayed. A little after an Edict issued out in the
Kings name to interdict all commerce and traffic with England, that no kind of
grain, wines, or pulse should be transported thither, nor from thence to France
any cloth, serges, woolls, lead, tinn, stuffs, silk stockings, with an
enumeration of diverse other commodities: by this one may observe, the advantage
that England has of France, in variety and substance of Marchandizes.

The French Chroniclers obtrude to the world diverse wrong informations of this
travers twixt England and France. 1. They relate that the French were casheer'd
of the Queens service with little or nothing at all of their wages, which is
false, for they were paid to a penny, and many of them parted with gifts and
much wealth. 2. They report that the Queen out of her necessities had borrowed
much money of them, which was also a calumny, for there was never Princess
lived in greater plenty. 3. They make the world believe that the first
depraedations at Sea, and acts of Piracy were committed by the English, which
is another falsehood, for besides the seizure of the Merchants at Blay, where
they came to reimbarque their Ordnance, diverse other praedatory acts were done
by the French. 4. They publish also another imposture, that while the Earls of
Carlisle and Holland were in the heat of the Treaty of a Match with England, the
same time they did machinat the ruin of France; Anno 1627.
the first time that England was ever taxed of double dealing. 5. That his
Majesty of Great Britain had no hand in the Pacifications which were made twixt
the King, and them of the Religion, whereas his Ambassadors and Agents did
always follow the Kings Army to their excessive expenses, and did perpetually
negotiat in their behalf; and became caution to them for performances on the
Kings side.

Thus a black cloud hung between England and France; which broak out into a
shrewd, though short, tempest of war. The King of Great Britain riggs up his
galeons, and in a very short time puts to Sea a huge royal fleet in perfect
equippage of 150. Sails, with an Army of 10000. combatants: which by the advice and directions of Monsieur Subize, and Blancart, who had fled to England
some months before, were to sail toward Rochell, and seize upon the Islands
of Re and Oleron. In Oleron the English, when they were in possession of Guyen,
made those famous Maritim laws, which are observed by all the Western world to
this day: The Duke of Buckingham was chosen Admiral by Sea, and General by Land
of this great expedition; who published this following Manifesto to the world.

What part the Kings of Great Britain have always taken in the affairs of the
Reformed Churches of this Kingdom, and with what care and zeal they have
labored for the good of them, is manifest to all, and the examples thereof are
as ordinary, as the occasions have been: The now King, my most honored Lord and
Master comes nothing short of his Predecessors therein, if his good and
laudable designs for their good had not bin perverted to their ruin, by those
who had most interest for their due accomplishment: What advantages has he
refused? what Parties has he not sought unto? that by his alliance with France
he might restore more profitably and powerfully the restitution of those
Churches to their ancient liberty and splendour? And what could be less hoped
for by so strict an alliance, and from so many reiterated promises by the mouth
of a great Prince but effects truly royal, and sorting with his greatness? But
failings have bin such, that his Majesty, by so many promises, and so straight
an obligation of friendship, has not only bin disappointed of means to obtain
Liberty and Surety for the said Churches, and to restore Peace to France by the
reconciliation of those, whose breath utters nothing else but all manner of
obedience to their King under the liberty of their Edicts: that contrariwise
they have prevayl'd, by the interest which he had in those of the Religion to
deceive them, and by this means not only to untie him from them, but also to
make him, if not odious unto them, at least suspected in perverting the means,
which he had ordained for their good, to a quite contrary end: Witness the
English Ships not designed for the extirpation of them of the Religion, but to
the contrary, express promise was made that they should not be used against
them in the last Sea Fight. What then may be expected from so puissant a Prince
as the King my Master so openly eluded, but a thorough feeling equal and
proportioned to the injuries received? but his patience has gone beyond
patience, and as long as he had hopes that he could benefit the Churches by any
other means, he had no recours by way of Arms: so far that having bin made an
instrument Anno 1627.
and worker of the last Peace upon conditions disadvantagious enough, and which
would not have bin accepted without his Majesty's intervention, who interposed
his credit and interest to the Churches to receive them, even with threatenings
to the end to shelter the honor of the most Christian King, under assurances of
his Part, not only for the accomplishment, but also, for the bettering of the
said Conditions, for which he stands caution to the Churches.

But what has bin the issue of all this but only an abuse of his goodness?
and that which his Majesty thought a soverain remedy for all their sores, has
it not brought almost the last blow to the ruin of the Churches? It wanted but
a little by continuing the Fort before Rochell, the demolishment whereof was
promised, by the violences of the soldiers and Garrisons of the said Fort and
Isles, as well upon the Inhabitants of the said Town as upon strangers, in lieu
whereas they should have retired, they have bin daily augmented, and other
forts built; as also by the stay of the Commissioners in the said Town beyond
the time agreed on, to the end to make broils, and by means of the division
which they made to slide among the Inhabitants to open the gates to the
neighboring Troops, and by other withstandings and infractions of peace, I
say it little faild, that the said Town and in it all the Churches had not
drawn their last breath: And in the mean time while his Majesty has yet
continued, and not opposed so many injuries, so many faith-breakings, but by
complaint and Treaty, until he had received certain advice confirmed by
intercepted Letters of the great preparation the most Christian King made to
power upon Rochell. And then what could his Majesty of Great Britain do, but to
vindicat his honor by a quick arming against those who had made him a complice
of their deceits: And to give testimony of his integrity and zeal which he
has always had for the reestablishing of the Churches, an establishment which
shall be dear and precious to him above any other thing?

This is the sole end of his arming at this time, and not any particular
interest: Yet whosoever would doubt hereof, let him consider the circumstance
of times, and disposition of affairs as they stand now with the King my Master.
For who will believe that he can have any dessein upon France, or to have
projected conquests here in a time so disadvantageous, having now for his enemy
one of the puissantst King of the world; and if he had such a design, surely he
would have sent greater forces then I have now under command, whereof if the
number were known they would be judged but Auxiliaries only, and that their
aim is no other but for the good of the Churches, which for so many important
reasons and considerations he finds himself obliged before God and men to
protect and succor. But if it be alleged that the King my Master has been
moved to take up arms for other respects, as the detention and seizure of all
the ships and goods of his subjects at Bourdeaux, and other places of this
Kingdom, to the breach and manifest contravention of the peace 'twixt the two
Crowns, which in this point tend expressly to the irrepairable prejudice, yea to
the total ruin of commerce, in the rupture whereof the poor people of this
Realm being not able to vent their Merchandises, groans not only under the
burden of so many taxes and Anno 1627.
impositions, but for the very necessities of life it self. That the
apprehensions the King my Master has of the powerful increase of the most
Christian King by Sea has moved him to arm for preventing the growth thereof;
and lastly that being hopeless of any accommodation of things, he has bin
constrained to put himself in arms. The answer to all this is, that whosoever
will search the Arrests, prises and seasures which have bin made on both sides,
he shall find the King my Master and his subjects have hitherto profited by
this breach, and that it has turned to their advantage.

In the second place, he is so far off from being jealous of the pretended
power by Sea, and that he should have reason to hinder it, that there needs no
more then for him to grant, when he thinks it fit, Letters of Mart to his
subjects, and so these vain and feeble forces at Sea might be dissipated
without the employment of any Fleet Royal. Finally, that there has bin a
necessity to arm thus, because there is no hope of accommodation otherwise,
the contrary will be most manifest to him who will consider the researches
which have bin made at several times as well by their own Ministers, as by the
Ministers of other Princes to the King my Master, to treat of accommodating
things at their instigation. It appears by all this that the King my Master
has not bin forced to arm for any particular interest, but only for the
defense of the Churches, for the security and freedom whereof he stood
responsible: Yet there are some who dare amuse the world that his Majesty has
a particular dessein in it, and that he uses Religion for a pretext to gain a
party, by means whereof, and by which conjunction he hopes to push on his
purposes to the end at which they aim. No, no, our Religion teaches us
otherwise, and the King my Master's piety (wherein he gives place to no man
living) will never permit him. His desscin is the establishment of the
Churches, his interest is their good, and his aim their contentment; That
being done, these Drums beating, these Ensigns displayed shall be folded up
again. And all this noise of War shall be buried in night and silence, which
would never have bin but for their cause. Given aboard of our Admiral this
Wensday the 21. of July, 1627.

Buckingham.


A good while before this Fleet was under sail, the French Cardinal by some
pensionary Spies he had in the English Court, had advertisement of the dessein,
therefore there was a Remonstrance sent from the King to his Town of Rochell to
this effect. That they were French, and that the English were proud and
insupportable, that having vain pretentions upon this Kingdom, if they took any
place it was to reduce it to slavery: That their Ancestors being acquainted
with the nature of the English chose rather to lose half their goods, then to
be under their domination upon the accord made for the delivery of King John
when he was prisoner in England: That his Majesty had given proofs of the
effects of his clemency so often, and with so much favor, that his grace seemed
to be above their crimes; for their Religion, if they thought to cast it upon
the account, he left them the free exercise of it; touching Lewis Fort, which
seemed to give some ombrage to their Town, he assured them, that continuing
within Anno 1627.
the bounds of their obedience, there should be a course taken for their
contentment, but if it should come into the hands of the English, doubtless
they would turn it to a Cittadell, to settle therein their tyranny; That the
present occasion was of that high importance, that it might entirely and
eternally gain them the affections of their King by their fidelity, or that
they might thereby offend him so sensibly, that they might render themselfs
incapable of grace ever after, if they departed from their loyalty whereunto
they were obliged as subjects toward their natural Prince, and as Frenchmen
against a strange Nation, and an ancient enemy of France.

By the Duke of Buckinghams Manifesto it appears the King of Great Britain had
diverse grounds of War against France; first, that his Merchants were so abused,
their ships seized on, and their goods taken away; secondly, that the French
King grew so strong in ships, which in former times was used to be a sufficient
motif for War of it self; and lastly, that Articles were not performed of the
peace which was made with them of the Religion wherein England was engaged; His
Majesty of Great Britain waves the first two, and lays hold of the last,
whereby the French Reformists had just cause to abet him in the quarrel it
being more theirs then his; Though there were reports blazed abroad, of other
odd motifs; Howsoever the Policy of England was taxed (though her courage
admired) abroad to engolf her self into a War with France, when she had another
great neighbor King already on her back in actual hostility.

This Fleet gave a mighty alarm to France, which made the King to send the
Duke of Angoulesme before Rochell with three thousand foot, and five hundred
horse; The King following a few days after fell sick upon the way, and
Monsieur was in mourning for his wife who died in Childbed of a daughter. The
Duke of Angoulesms Quarter Masters when they came to take lodgings for the
billeting of the Army in the small villages about Rochell, took so much room
as would have served an Army thrice as great; and this was done of purpose, for
the report thereof being blown to Rochell and so to the English Fleet, the
Duke, upon Soubize's advice, cast anchor at the Isle of Re, whereas his first
intention was for Lewis fort upon the Continent which dessein was diverted upon
the (false) report of the greatness of Angoulesms Army; There were hardly 1200.
English landed upon the Island of Re, but 1000. French foot, and 200. choice
horse who had layn invisible in a bottom all the while, appeared, and charged
them furiously, the French horse did wonderful bravely, and the English foot no
less, who having scarce stepped ashore were set upon and diverse driven into the
Sea and drowned; but by the brave example of their Commanders they resumed
courage, and killed above one hundred and fifty of the enemies Cavalry, put
their foot to flight and remaind Masters of the field; there was good pillage
found among the French horsemen that fell, diverse of them being persons of
quality, and young spirits, which being stripped, many had their Mistesses
favors tied about their genitories. At this first act of invasion Anno 1627.
the English loss'd some hundreds of men, amongst others Blaneart Monsieur
Soubize companion who had bin one of the chief tracers of this voyage in the
English Court, was slain upon the sands, and Sir John Heyden was killed too,
who had afterward honorable burial. The next day the English horse landed,
and so they began to entrench: The chiefest Fort in the Island was Saint Martin
where Monsieur Toiras a choice man, had bin many days before; he sent the next
day in a bravado a Page and a Trumpet to tell the Duke he meant to give him a
breakfast, the Page had twenty pieces, and the Trumpet five given him: If the
Duke had gone presently in pursuance of his victory for that breakfast toward
Saint Martin he might in all probability have taken the Fort, but he stayed
diverse days near the Sea side, and in the interim Toiras had time to fortify:
and the cause he stayed his march further, was that Soubize, and Sir Will:
Beecher had gone to Rochell for more aid which the Duke expected; but the
Rocheller gave them little countenance letting them in at the Postern gate:
Toiras after the first, sent a second Trumpet to the Duke for burying the dead,
offering a thousand pounds for his brothers body and others who were killed,
but he had them gratis. Soubize afterward came with five hundred from Rochell,
and so the English Army marched toward Saint Martin, in the way there was the
little Fort called Lapree, wherein as there was advice had afterward, there was
but one old woman; Soubize counseled the Duke to march another way through the
Vineyards, and to leave the Fort; this proved fatal, and indeed the greatest
cause of the ruin of the English, for had they taken that little Fort it might
have served for a handsome retreat: Being come before Saint Martins Fort Sir
Io: Burrowes viewed it, and said positively it was impregnable but by starving,
and so advised the Duke to take what booty could be had in that Isle, and go to
Oleron; but this counsel took not. While the English Army lay before Saint
Martin there was an Engineer came out of the Castle, who desired conference
with the Duke, but being suspected by his looks, he was searched and a poisoned
dagger was found about him, wherewith, being put to the torment, he confessed
to have bin sent to kill the Duke, so he had no quarter; All the time the Duke
was there, though it was concluded by the Counsel of War, 'twas impossible to
take the Fort but by famine, yet no intrenchments were made all the while to
block them up, but a way was taken to raise batteries before the Army had made
its approaches, which proved chargeable and fruitless, for with the infinite
company of shot made against the Hill, there was nothing done by way of breach,
but more powder and shot spent then the spoils of the Isle was worth, and
still the passage was open for the Town round about to carry in any thing; At
last the English began to entrench, yet they could not hinder provision to come
by Sea from the main; at last a sickness happned in the Army whereby many
dropped away; Sir John Burrowes was killed, and diverse other ilfavor'd
accidents fell Anno 1627.
out, and discontents began to be fomented, for there came diverse messages from
the Cittadell to the Duke which he made shy to impart to the Counsel of war,
whereat there was some distaste taken.

The King of France was now recovered, and he and his Cardinal were come before
Rochell; there were all means under heaven used to preserve Toiras, and the
Citadel of Re, whereupon the King writ his Letter encouragement unto him.
Monsieur Toiras, understanding the rare vertis and courage wherewith you and
the rest that are in that Citadel do defend your selfs against the English, I
was willing to express unto you by this Letter the singular satisfaction that I
receive thereby; Therefore you ought to believe that I will acknowledge such
signal service to every one who shall have a share therein, in such a manner
that they shall bear all the days of their life's some mark of honor according
to their merits: Therefore I desire you would send Me the names of all those
that are shut in with you in that Cittadell, that neither Gentleman, Officer or
Soldier remain without his reward.

This Letter being safely arrived to Toiras it raised every ones spirit to a
great height of resolution; as also the Kings Person being come so near them.
There were diverse complements passed 'twixt the Duke and Toiras during the
siege, and Master Io. Ashburnham being sent to the Citadel upon a Message,
(and afterward to the King of France himself) Toiras was complaining of want
of Melons, the Duke sent him a basketfull the next day; He returned the Duke
some bottles of Orange flower water, for which the Duke gave the Messenger
twenty Iacobuses, whereas Troiras gave but five for the Melons.

When the English had planted a serious siege before the Town, Buckingham sent
Toiras this Letter.

Monsieur; The desire I have to witness upon all occasions how much I esteem
and prize persons of quality and merit, shall make me always proceed toward
them with all courtesy; I think I have comported my self toward you in that
manner hitherto, as far as the law of arms would permit me. In poursuance
whereof before the quality of my affairs obligeme to take other counsels, and
to alter my procedure, I thought good to exhort you to the consideration of
your necessities, which you have already endured with much patience, and your
courage happily might transport you to continue under vain hopes of succor, to
the prejudice of your safety: For these reasons, and for the regret I should
have to see greater displeasure befall you, we judge it convenient to invite
you to render your self into our hands, with those that are of your company,
and under your command, and withal the place possessed by you, upon such
terms of honor that you may not expect hereafter, if you oblige me to poursue
the means I have in hand to accomplish my dessein, and that you let matters go
on to extremity: So expecting your answer accordingly I rest, Sir, your most
humble and most obedient servant

Buckingham.


Toiras returned this Answer.

Monsieur; Your courtesies are known to all the world, and being done with that
judgment they use to carry with them, they ought to be chiefly expected by
them who do good actions: Now, I do not find there can be a better then for one
to employ his life for the service of his King; I am here to that Anno 1627.
purpose, with a number of brave men, amongst whom he that is the least resolut
would not believe to have satisfied himself, if he did not surmount all
difficulties to help to conserve this place; In so much that neither despair of
succor, nor fear of being ill used in point of extremity are able to make me
quit so generous a dessein: Besides I should judge my self unworthy of any of
your favors, if I should omit the least point of my duty in this action, the
issue whereof must needs be honorable; And the more you shall contribut to this
glory, the more I shall be obliged to be, Monsieur, Your most humble, and most
obedient servant

Toiras.


The English assayed all means imaginable to render themselfs Masters of the
Cittadell by their Ships and inventions at Sea, and by assaults and storming a
shore, nor did they fail in any thing that human strength and courage could
contribut; They took diverse bottoms as they were transporting provisions from
the Continent, but at last the Marshall of Schomberg had the hap upon a high
flood, and in a dark night, to bring safely into the Cittadell a mighty supply
of all things that might conduce not only to releeve, but to raise the spirits
of the soldier; so the approach of Winter, and sickness with other
inconveniences forced the English to be gone; which the Duke, though often
advised and importuned by the Counsel of War was loath to do, having provision
for two months longer, and that he must be forced to leave a number of sick
men behind, to the mercy of the enemy: But after a conference with Soubize he
marched away at last; There was a great debate in the Cittadell, whether the
English should be poursued in the Retreat, or whether a bridge of silver should
be made them to pass quietly away; The first opinion prevayl'd: so they had
not marched a Musket shot from the Town, but two hundred horse, and two
thousand foot were at their heels; The English made a stand, to see whether
the French would fight but they would not, so they continued their march till
they came to la Nova a little village where they made another stand, thinking
the French would charge; which they forboare still. Thence they marched to
Lewisbridg where they were to imbark, but before two Regiments were passed over
the Bridge which was very narrow, the French fell upon the English horse in the
rear, and routed them so that the foot could not charge, then they began to
fly, and the enemy had the execution of five Regiments which he put most to the
sword except twenty Officers, and one hundred common soldiers, diverse also were
drowned in the salt pits, and dikes; so there perished in all near upon two
thousand besides the sick which were left before the Cittadell, all whose
throats were cut, and sent in a Bark thrust from the shore to the English
Ships. My Lord Monjoy, now Earl of Newport, was there taken prisoner, old
Colonel Gray was fallen into a salt-pit, and being upon point of being drowned
he cried out cent mill escus pour marancon, a hundred thousand crowns for my
ransom, so the noise of the money saved his life: There were Anno 1627.
diverse prisoners besides taken, but they were sent as a present to the Queen
of England to whom the King writ this following Letter by le Chevalier de la
Rame, called du Meau.

Madame my sister, It having pleased God to bless my arms in such sort that my
Lord Monjoy, Colonel Gray, diverse Captains, Officers and Gentlemen remaind my
prisoners in the journey which passed at Re the eighth of this month; I was
willing to testify unto all Christendom, the special esteem which I make of
your Person, by sending unto you the said prisoners which I have let go upon
their words for your sake. Nothing having invited me thereunto but the
friendship which I bear you, and the knowledge I also have that I cannot do an
act more acceptable to the Queen my Mother, then to do for your sake what I
would not do for any other. Du Meau will assure you of my health, I pray you
have a care of your own which is most deer unto me, and I assure you that the
world has not a brother which makes more account of a sister then I do of you;
so I rest, my Lady and Sister, your most affectionat Brother Lewis. From the
Camp before Rochell the last of November. 1627.


There were also forty four Colors taken which the King sent to the two
Queens at Paris, and they hang to this day in the great Church there.

This was the dismall'st day that the English ever had in France, who in times
passed performed such stupendous exploits in that Country; yet the Invasion
was made with much gallantry, for they might be said to have swom through water
and blood to take footing on the Island, which discovered much of the ancient
courage of the Nation; Besides, they did before the Citadel as much as men
could do, and upon their marching away they made two stands to draw Schomberg
to fight notwithstanding that they had not in number a quarter of the horse
that he had newly transported from the Continent. They took likewise diverse
prisoners of note who were released also without ransom by his Majesty of
Great Britain. Diverse omissions there were that proved fatal to this
expedition: 1. The not speedy marching of the English Army in poursuance of
their first victory to the Cittadell where Toiras had time in the interim to
fortify. 2. The not taking of the little Fort la Pree in the way, which might
have served for a retreat. 3. That the Duke did not follow the advice of
Burrowes to go to Oleron a greater Island, and afterward of the knowingst
Colonels so often pressed upon him, to march away before Schomberg came over,
for so he might have made an honorable retreat then which there is nothing more
difficult in the fait of arms, not is it any disgrace to go away in the night
for preventing of being beaten in the day.

Monsieur Soubizes counsel was the cause of these omissions, who was the main
contriver of this unfortunate voyage (with Blancart who fell at first landing)
And it seems a hard destiny hanted the Anno 1627.
said Soubize (though a worthy man of himself) in all attempts from the
beginning; He was taken prisoner at Saint John d'Angely, he was forced to fly
at Royan, and twice (with this time) at Re; He had but ill succes at Medoc, and
diverse ill-favor'd encounters at Sea, though he lost less honor there then a
shore.

Some outlandish Chroniclers would have it that there were three Furies which
impelled the English to this Expedition. 1. The ambition of Buckingham. 2. The
felony of Soubize. 3. The rebellion of the Rochellers: but these men write more
out of passion then knowledge, for as I instanced in the beginning of this
relation, there were diverse causes to move England to arms as matters stood
then.

The King having had such rare success against the English, he resolves Anno
1628.
upon the planting of a serious siege before Rochell, thereupon order was given
for an exact circumvallation by Land, and Pompco Targon an Italian Engineer was
employed for Sea works: the said Targon, being assisted with the Cardinals
headpeece, fell on a plot to raise a huge dike in the channel which the
Rochellers geer'd at first, but they found it the bane of their Town at last.

The Rochellers had recourse to the King of Great Britain for protection, who
resenting their sad condition employed two Royal Fleets for their succor
which made but sorry returns; The Duke of Buckingham was to be General of the
last, but he was tragically slain the day before he was to embark; Thereupon
the Earl of Linzey went in his place, but before he appeared before the Town,
Targon had finished the gran Dike, whereof the Cardinal was daily overseer, the
King being then in Paris; there were certain kind of palissadoes and other
strange fabriques raised in the channel to the wonderment of the world, for
Marquis Spinola, at his revokment from Flanders to Spain, and passing by the
Kings Army, said, he had never seen the like, being as trenches and barricadoes
erected in the Sea; and they were done with that advantage that no navall power
could do any good upon them; In so much that the English Fleet being arrived,
the Cardinal sent to the General, that he should have safe pasport to come a
shore with six of his knowingst Commanders, with permission to view the works,
and if they thought in their judgments that the Town was succourable, he would
raise the siege without fighting a stroke: The General of this Fleet was the
Lord Rob: Willoughby Earl of Linzey, whom the French Chroniclers call Willaby
Inghay, and the General of the former Fleet they call Count d'Emby, in lieu of
Denbigh, so they call Burrowes Burrache, Ashpernham Hasburnim. And as in this
relation, so every where else they seldom or never truly render the surname of
any English or German, which (under favor) is a great error, and a kind of
stupidity and carelesnes in an Historian.

The King being returned with the flower of all the Nobility of France to the
siege before Rochell which had now lasted a long time, the Town was reduced to
an extreme exigent and want of provision (having for greediness of money sold
upon high prises to the English Anno 1628.
being at Re much corn and other things) therefore they came at last to a
submission, their Deputies making this speech to the King.

Sir, they who have bin a long time shut up in obscure prisons, when they come
abroad cannot behold the Sun without dazzling their eyes; so we whom a long
captivity has kept reclus'd within our walls, coming now to appeer before your
Majesty's face, we are not able to endure the brightness of it without
dazzlement, and some horror of our faults passed which adds to our confusion:
yet the goodness of your Majesty, whereof we have tasted the effects so often,
and do now find, gives us the boldness to prostrat our selfs at your feet to
implore pardon, which our frequent relapses into our crimes do not permit us to
hope for, etc. So they go on with a protest and deep asseveration of their
loyalty for the future, wherein they will endeavor to surpass all the rest of
his subjects.

The King answered. God grant that you have spoken to me from the bottom of
your hearts, and that necessity rather then an acknowledgement of your faults
has put these words in your mouths, you have made use of all means and
inventions to withdraw your selfs from the duty of good and faithful subjects,
yet I cannot forbear to let you feel the effects of my goodness and mercy; Be
wiser hereafter, and assure your selfs I will not break my promise.

At the beginning of the siege there were in the Town about eighteen thousand
souls, but at the reddition there were not five thousand; and scarce one
hundred who had strength to bear a Musket; an ounce of bread was worth half a
crown, a pound of biscuit seven crowns, an egg six shillings, a pound of
horseflesh ten shillings, a cabbage leaf three pence; many dragged themselfs
to the Churchyards and made their own graves: A little before their reddition
they married all the young maids in the Town that were espousable who had any
portions. The King caused all kind of fortifications new and old except those
toward the haven to be razed, all bastions and the walls to be demolished, and
the moats filled up; so of a City she became to be an open village, without
Maire, Sheriffs, or any other Magistrate, the Inhabitants to be contributory to
all kind of taxes; those ramparts that were built out of the ruins of Churches
and Monasteries were employed for reedification of the former Churches; a great
Cross was erected in the Marketplace, and a Decree passed that there should
be a solemn Procession every year upon All Saints day about that Cross in
remembrance that the Town was taken that day; all their Parishes were reduced
to three; In so much that as the quality of the place, so the whole government
thereof was entirely altered, as if they had bin put to begin the world again.

In the mean time while the King had triumphed thus over Rochell, the Duke of
Rohan was very active in Languedoc, having considerable forces, which made the
Parliament of Tholouze thunder out a furious Arrest against him, That for his so
many Conspiracies, Rebellions, Disloyalties, and for bringing the English into
France, and other most odious Treasons he was deprived of the title of Duke,
made incapable of the benefit of Anno 1628.
the general Act of oblivion, that he should be drawn by wild horses, his body
dismembered and burnt, his ashes thrown into the wind, his posterity declared
Peasants, his Duchy reunited to the Crown, and whosoever could apprehend his
person and bring him living or dead, he should have one hundred and fifty
thousand Franks for a guerdon.

The Duke so little valued this sentence that he cau'd Masvyer the chief
President of Tholouze to be hanged the next day in Effigy in the Town where he
was.

There was at this time in Italy a former difference revived 'twixt the Duke of
Savoy, and the Duke of Mantova about Monferrat, which had bin some years before
accommoded by the intervention of France; The Emperor and Spaniard were for
the Savoyard: hereupon Don Gonzalez de Cordova besieged Casal: The King of
France thought it concernd his honor and safety to assist the Mantovan who had
been once his vassal when only Duke of Nevers; therefore having settled all
things at Rochell, he marches with his Army toward the Alps, but demanding
passage of the Duke of Savoy, the Duke a great while did complement with him;
Hereupon he forces his passage through snow and ice in the month of February
and got over to Susa in person, which was rendered unto him; so the Duke and He
were upon good terms, and free passage accorded for his Army to pass to
Piemont to raise the siege of Casal, but Gonzales by the advice of the Duke of
Savoy, quitted the siege himself in the interim, and so retired to Milan, and
the King returned to France.

While he was the other side the Alps at Susa, by the interposition of the
republic of Venice, there was an overture made of a reconciliation 'twixt
England and France, which quickly took effect.

The King in his return ore the Alps with his Cardinal, caused a Pillar to be
erected in the common road upon one of the highest Mountains with this
ostentous Inscription; To the eternal memory of Lewis the thirteenth, King of
France and Navarr, most gracious, most victorious, most happy, most just; A
Conqueror, who having overcome all Nations of Europe, he has triumphed also
over the elements of heaven and earth, having twice passed ore these Hills in
the month of March with his victorious Army, to restore the Princes of Italy
to their estates, and to protect and defend his Allies.

Being returned to France, he heard the Duke of Rohan roved still up Anno 1629.
and down with forces in Languedoc, and that he was upon point of entering into
a confederation with the Spaniard, to which purpose He employed one Clausel to
Madrid, who proposed That if his Catholic Majesty would be pleased to furnish
him with 600000. crowns annually, the Duke of Rohan would undertake to raise
and maintain an Army of twelve thousand foot, and twelve hundred horse to make
what diversion his Majesty would appoint, and to continue a war in France.
There were diverse other Propositions tending to the kind usage of the
Catholics, and withal a request That the Dukes pension from fourteen
thousand crowns, might be augmented to eighteen thousand, and that his Catholic
Majesty would please Anno 1629.
to add to his brother Soubize's pension of eight thousand crowns a year, two
thousand more. For performance of these propositions the said Clausel could
give no other caution but the word of an Honorable and most Religious Prince,
meaning the Duke.

These offers were accepted by the Spaniard, but the sum was reduced to three
hundred thousand crowns payable in two payments every year.

The Articles being sent by Clausel to France by a Zeland Gentleman, he was
suspected and taken in a Pond up to the neck, so he was hanged at Toulouse.

The King at his return to Provence took Privas from them of the Religion after
many bloody sallies and assaults on both sides; a place of mighty consequence;
In the Camp before Privas the Peace was proclaym'd 'twixt France and England
to dishearten them in the Town the more, for they thought that the King of
Great Britain was still involved in their Cause. This Peace was negotiated by
Georgi and Contarini Ambassadors to the Maiden Republic, who yet may be called
the Mother of Policy and able to read Lectures on that Thesis to the rest of
Europe; nor did there small glory redound to her by her succesfull intervention
herein, and by making her Saint Mark Mediator 'twixt two such mighty Monarks.

The words of the Proclamation before Privas pronounced alowd by a king of Arms
were these. Let the world know there is peace, amity, and good intelligence
between his Majesty and his good Brother, and Brother in law the King of Great
Britain, acessation of all acts of hostility betwixt them and their subjects,
with an entire confirmation of the ancient Alliances, and of the Articles and
Contract of Marriage with the Queen of Great Britain, and an overture of a free
and safe commerce between the subjects of the two Crowns: Therefore all persons
are prohibited to attempt any think in prejudice of the said Peace under pain
of being punished as Disturbers of the public repose, etc.

The general Articles also were signed there interchangeably in the ordinary
form, where of there were some extraordinary, as that In regard it would be
difficult to make restitution on either side of diverse prises which have been
taken in this war, the two Crowns are accorded, that there shall be no
reprisall made by sea or in any other manner for that which is passed 'twixt the
two Kings and their subjects during the said war.

And because there are diverse vessels at Sea, with Letters of Mart, which give
Commission to combat the enemies which cannot presently have notice of this
Peace, or receive Order to abstain from acts of hostility, It is accorded that
whatsoever shall pass the space of the two next months after this accord,
shall not derogate from, or empeach this Peace, or the good will of the two
Crowns.

The King having dismantled Privas, and secured other petty places, he marched
to Alets a very considerable Garrison Town of them of the Religion, which being
also surrendered, he marched to Languedoc, took Castres and Nismes once the
darling of Rome when she had her Legions in those parts, though now no Town
throughout France be Anno 1629.
a greater enemy unto her: These monstrous successes of the Kings made the Duke
of Rohan hearken unto a Treaty, therefore being at Anduza he convokes a kind of
Assembly of the chiefest of them of the Religion to whom he made this notable
speech.

Sirs: You know well enough that the King doing me the honor as to acknowledge
me his kinsman, has had particular consideration of me in all general
Treaties made with your party, and that he has made me to be perpetually
solicited to separat my self from you, with assurances that he would raise my
condition to such a point, that might draw upon it the envy of the Princes, and
the greatest of his Kingdom: Neither are you ignorant that the general
interests of the party being deerer unto me then mine own, I have bin so far
from lending an ear unto those charming propositions, that to the contrary I
have broak with his Majesty whenever he has refused or delayed the execution
of the Edicts passed in favor of us, and exposing my self to his indignation I
have run the hazard of my fortun, my honor, and life: Gentlemen I pray do not
think, that since our Cause is conjoined with that of God, but that I continu
as strong a zeal and inclination as ever toward it: But in regard our affairs
are in another condition perchance then you do imagine, I have called you hither
to instruct you, and then to take such order that your wisdoms shall afford me
to put in punctual execution with as much fidelity as courage.

You must then consider that any time these eight years that the King has
warred with us, heaven has bin so favorable unto him, that it seems he rather
went to the routing of our troops then to combat, and by assaulting our
strongest Towns he prepared rather for triumphant entries, then sieges: so that
now the number of our combatants, and the strength of our strongest places does
not serve as much to maintain our party, as to augment his glory: so many Towns
in Poitou, Saintonge, Guyen, and Languedoc which have not bin able toresist him
as many days as we count months, are most sensible proofs hereof: Rochell,
alas! (with that he fetched a profound sigh accompagnied with tears) Rochell
which we thought inexpugnable, that proud Town one of the miracles of Europe
being now reduced to an open village on all sides, does carry, and shall
eternally bear the marks of the valor and good fortune of this glorious
Monark.

Having demolished this strong rampart of the Gospel, by which the whole party
subsisted, he has penetrated the Kingdom from one Diameter to the other, and
traversed in five or six days the Alps in the most rigorous season of the
year, which Julius Caesar accounted amongst his heroiquest actions, and
Hannibal could not do it in fifteen days without inestimable loss; He has
forced the pass of Susa marching ore the belly of an Army entrenched and
fortified in a straight. He has delivered the Duke of Mantova from the
oppression of the King of Spain, and the Savoyard, and obliged the latter who
was Author of the War to receive such conditions of peace that he pleased to
prescribe him: Repassing the Alps with like celeritie, he has deprived us of
Privas, and taken multitudes of places more by the terror only of his
victorious Arms.

He is continually assisted by the Cardinal of Richelieu, who for the fertility
Anno 1629.
of his Invention, for the solidity of his Counsels, for the secrecy of his
desseins, for his hardines in execution, and for his address in all affairs of
consequence, I would acknowledge him the greatest man of Europe were he not
born for the ruin of our party, and the abolition of the Reformed Religion.

This young, generous, warlike King, though too much zealoused to Popery,
following in every thing the counsels of this Priest as Oracles, can we doubt
but our defense, though lawful, as being for Religion, and liberty of
conscience, be not an occasion to him to advance our destruction, under pretext
of rebellion and felony?

After all that Gentlemen, you must consider that the taking of Rochell has
extinguished all Factions throughout the Kingdom which commonly served to the
increase of our party; In so much that of three hundred places good and bad,
which we had formerly in our hands, we have not 30. remaining, without rents,
without soldiers, or means to put into them all together as many men as would
serve to preserve one alone: For although our Parsons cry out daily in their
Chaires that we ought not to despair of heavenly succor, yet receiving every
day proofs of the wrath of the Eternal, there is more appearance to expect
punishment for our sins, then miracles for the reestablishment of our affairs.

Peradventure you will promise your selfs some great assistance from strangers,
and specially from Protestants, whom the conformity of Religion which ties them
to our interests, may oblige to assist us in so urgent necessity. But I pray
consider that the Germans have enough to defend themselfs from the oppression
of the Emperor, consider the elusions of the Hollander, the impuissance of the
Savoyard who has bled at the nose; the lightness of the English who have
concluded a peace with France without comprehending us who were the sole object
of the war: And if you stay for the offers of Spain which loves not our Nation,
and our Religion less, know that he studies how to engage us so far against
the King, that we may become incapable of his grace, and that the succors
wherewith he will supply us which is but a little money, will not serve but to
prolong our ruin, by enfeebling France by our Civil Wars, and intestine
broils.

For my self, I am now as much solicited as ever to abandon you, and to take
advantageous conditions of his Majesty, but I shall never hearken to any thing
but wherein you may find your satisfaction in a general Treaty for the whole
Cause, as also particularly for your Towns; If your wisdoms find it to purpose
that it be more expedient to seek our conservation with the exercise of our
Religion, and liberty of our consciences within the obedience which we owe to
our lawful Prince, then in resistance, which, though just of it self, is held
by the Enemies of our Faith no other then a Rebellion and high Treason, whereby
under a more specious pretext, to exterminat and destroy us; Or if contrary to
all appearance of human reason, you take a resolution to stiffen your selfs
against so victorious and invincible a power, I resolve also to incur all
hazards with you, though I am sorry that neither the advancement of the Faith
can be found in my resolution, nor your security in my danger, nor your safety
in my loss.

This studied speech, with the sense of the late ill success, and of Anno 1629.
the Kings power, wrought so far upon the Assembly, that it extorted a
willingness to submit unto a Treaty which was propounded accordingly: so a
little after there was a general peace concluded with the Reformists, and the
King being in Languedoc where the Plague after this scourge of War, was very
rife, he went therefore himself to Paris, and left the Cardinal behind to
consummat all things; who amongst other places, entered Montauban where Espernon
met him and reentred into a perfect friendship with him: Montauban following
the example of all the rest of the Towns dismantled herself of all new
fortifications, and restored the Church lands, etc.

The Cardinal being returned to Paris the Peace with his Majesty of Great
Britain was solemnly renewed and sworn unto; but they of the Religion took it
ill that there was no mention at all made of them in the Treaty, they having
bin declared to be the object of Englands last war with France. All the Princes
were commanded to be at this Ceremony, and because a difference did arise for
precedence 'twixt foreign Princes of souverain Houses, and the natural sons of
Kings, a provisional Order was made by the Privy Counsel, That every one should
take place according to his seniority of age.

Thus our fourth Luster of the life of Lewis the thirteenth, ends with an Olive
branch of a double Peace, one with a foreign Prince, the King of Great Britain,
which was solemnly sworn unto by both Kings, Sir Thomas Edmunds being
Ambassador for the one, and the Marquis of New Castle ( de Chasteau neuf) for
the other.

The second Peace was concluded with his own subjects the whole Body of the
Religion, whom he had now reduced to an exact rule of obedience, having seized
upon, dismantled and secured all their praesidiary Towns which were near upon
fifty, whereof Montauban was the last that left her Mantle. So that they must
hereafter depend no more upon Garrisons but Royal Grace. A mighty work, then
which nothing could conduce more to make him so absolut a Monark.

Thus ends the fourth Luster.
The fifth Luster of the Life of Lewis the thirteenth.
THe King having with such a strong hand put a period to the Civil Wars in his
own Kingdoms, by debelling his subjects of the Religion, and utterly disabling
them from banding against him for the future, in dismantling all the tenable
Towns they had for their security, and disguarding other places they held to
the number of three hundred, of all Military strength, whereby he brought them
to Anno 1629.
depend totally upon his favor for their liberty, and the performance of the
Edicts granted in their behalf, he now thinks upon another march ore the Alps
for the support of the Duke of Mantova once his vassal (and still partly so)
being a Frenchman by birth though not by extraction. And this he might now do
with less fear then formerly, having quieted and secured all things in France;
according to the saying, Frustra foris agit bellum, qui domi timet incendium:
He vainly combats abroad, who fears combustions at home.

The Duke of Nevers being now settled in Mantova the French grew powerful in
Italy, which the Spaniard could not well digest; Thereupon a Ligue was struck
'twixt the Emperor and him, whereinto the Duke of Savoy entered afterward. The
Emperor questions the Duke of Nevers about Mantova, though not for the Title,
yet for the investiture, which he was to receive from him. Hereupon he sends an
Army to Italy under the command of Colalto a great Captain, and Marquis
Spinola, a greater, was General for the King of Spain, nor was the little Duke
Emanuel of Savoy inferior to either, who after Henry the Great's death, assumed
to himself the title of the prime soldier of Europe.

Now Spinola being tired with the lingering Low Country Wars, and having
recovered the honor he had lost before Berghen op some, by that notable exploit
of taking Breda, he procured his revokement from that service; Being come to
Spain there was some clashing 'twixt him and Olivares about accounts; yet was
he sent to be Governor of Milan, and so was made General of this War; He
struck like thunder into Monferrat, and took Nizza de la paglia, and six places
more notwithstanding the opposition of Toiras (who had such success against
the English in the Isle of Re) and was now Governor for the King the other side
the Hills, and had shut himself in Casal.

Colalto with the Imperial Army enters the same time the Territories of
Montava, and takes Viadana, Caneto, Gazole, Governo, and presents himself
before Mantova herself: where the Venetians had sent 1000. men for the security
of the Town.

As the King of France was preparing for Italy, there were two illfavord
accidents happened, one was that Monsieur being mightily taken in love with the
Princess Mary the Duke of Mantova's daughter for a second wife, neither the
King nor his Mother would give their consent unto it; which in coffeehouse
made him leave France, and fly to Lorain; this sudden sally was like to breed
ill blood, for he published a Manifesto wherein he cast many aspersions upon
the present Government, and the boundless Authority of Richelieu; but the
business was taken up by the ministry of good heads, and Monsieur was charmed
to France again by an addition of the Duchy of Valois, which was valued at one
hundred thousand Franks, yearly to his former apannage.

The other was an insurrection in Dijon the chief Parliament Town of Anno 1630.
Burgundy, where the King had erected a new Court for the improvement of his
revenues; The Officers of this new Court grew odious, as all Innovations are,
which made the Populasse to mutiny, specially the Vineyard-men, who in confused
troops came into Dijon, and did many insolences. The tumult came to that
height, and was of that consequence that the King himself went thither in
Person to appease it; which he did, by the assistance and sage conduct of the
Duke de Bellegarde; he passd' an Act of abolition, provided that a tax should
be laid upon the Comminalty for repairing the losses of some of his Officers
who had their houses burned, and were otherwise damnified in this popular fury.

In the interim the Cardinal with an Army of twenty thousand foot, and two
thousand horse (effectif men) were ready to traverse the Alps toward Italy,
for it was not thought fit the King should venture his own Person in the second
Expedition, because his Physicians had discovered some symptoms of an
approaching sickness in him; The Cardinal was accompagnied with three Marshals,
Crequy, La Force, and Schomberg, who were all Generals of diverse Squadrons; but
the Cardinal was chiefest Director of the War; Nor did he wave the title of
Generalissimo. Nor do there want presidents in France how Cardinals have bin
Generals of Armies which shall be produced in the life of Richelieu hereunto
annexed.

The Duke of Savoy was somewat shy to let this Army pass through the body of
his Country, or that there should be staples of corn erected in some Towns for
the supply of it; which made the Cardinal speak high language, demanding
passage by virtue of the Articles of the late Peace at Susa: So the Duke was
willing the Army should pass by the river Dovaire Susine, but not by Avigliana
and through the Plain of Piemont.

By this appears in what a disadvantagious posture Nature has placed some
Princes, whose Territories are situate 'twixt greater Potentates then
themselfs, which ofttimes puts them to wear double faces, and play with a
staff with two ends. Such is the condition of the Duke of Savoy, who besides
the abruptnes, and stupendous craggednes of most part of his Country, is
placed between two mighty Monarks, the Kings of France and Spain, and is
oftentimes put to his wits end how to comply with both, how to put off his hat
to the one, and how to make a leg to the other.

The Prince of Piemont came twice to confer with the Cardinal, though much ado
happened for the place of meeting: The Prince offered in his fathers name to
enter into an eternal Ligue with his most Christian Majesty against the
Spaniard, upon condition they should never disarme till they had made an entire
conquest of Milan and Genoa; the Cardinal held this proposition extravagant,
and illusory, and made of purpose to render the King odious to Italy by
apprehensions of an endless war; thereupon having received a positif
Commission from the King to make his passage by the sword, in case of further
delay, he marched before Pignerol, besieged it, and took it; whereby there Anno
1630.
was a double advantage gained, a free passage for provision from Dauphine; as
also that the said Pignerol enchaining, as it were, France to Italy, commanded
all the valley of Piemont.

The taking of Pignerol extremely troubled the Duke of Savoy, therefore he had
recourse to the Popes Nuncio to stir in the business for an accommodation of
things, Signieur Mazarini a moderate and well weighed Gentleman was joined with
him, and the Cardinal being returned to Lions where the King and two Queens
were, to give an account how matters stood; after much consultation and
canvasing of the business to and fro, they propounded certain capitulations
which they thought reasonable to both parties. The Imperial and Spanish party
though they did not disapprove, yet they delayed to give up their resolution
upon the said Articles to gain time, and see what success Colalto should get
before Mantova, and Spinola before Casal the chief Town of Monferrat; Colalto a
little after made himself Master of Mantova; The French were moved at this, and
that Casal was in so dangerous condition, as also that the Duke of Savoy was
now arming apace; thereupon the King with his Cardinal repasse the Alps with an
Army of 23000. foot, whereof there were 6000. Suisse, and 4000. Liegeois, and
2000. horse, besides volonteers; So he marched to Chamberry who presently
yielded, where Conqueror like he dismissed the Dukes Senate, and established a
Counsel of his own; he marched thence to Constans; In the interim Crequy
impatroniz'd himself of diverse other places in Savoy; In the heat of these
actions the King had a desire to visit the Queen at Lion, whither he came, but
falling sick, and disabled to return himself, he sent the Duke of Monmorency,
and the Marquis de' Fiat, who had bin Ambassador in England, with a French Army
to join with Marshall de la Force the other side the Hills: The Duke of Savoy to
prevent this conjunction, advanced as far as Avigliana with 20000. foot, and
4000. horse made up of Spaniards and Germans; The Armies met, and there were
some thousands killed on both sides; Prince Doria was taken prisoner by the
French, and diverse other persons of quality, with seventeen Colors which were
sent to be hanged up as Trophies in the great Church of Paris: The French
afterward took Saluces, and so seized upon all Savoy by degrees: The loss of
his Town Saluces sunk so deep into the Dukes breast, that he sickned thereupon,
and died four days after; whereby was verified the praediction of Octavio
Lassani in an Ephemerides he had published a few years before, that Duke
Emanuel should die suddenly after the taking of Saluces, which Prophecy he much
spoke of in his sickness. A little after there was a furious fight near
Carignan, wherein a great number of Commanders and common soldiers were slain
on both sides. Signieur Mazarini the Popes Agent stretched all the sinews of
his body, and strength of mind, to bring about a suspension of Arms, and so to
pave a way for Peace; which he did with much dexterity: so there were Articles
drawn, and command sent to Spinola from Spain, to condescend unto Anno 1630.
them; the apprehension hereof wrought so powerfully upon the Marquis that he
should yield to a cessation before he had perfected his business before Casal,
which he gave out to have as sure as a bird in a cage, that he sickned
thereupon, and died speedily after; and being visited by Monsieur Toiras, who
had bin Governor of Casal during the siege, he told him that They had taken
away his honor: whereupon among other Panagyriks that were written of him, this
Epitaph was made, which because it is somewhat extraordinary both for matter
and wit, and being on so gallant a man I will here insert.

Spinola gist icy, Passant, ce'st assez dit,
Car son nom dor' navant doit servir a l' histoire,
L'Europe en mil endroits est tesmoin de sa glory,
Sa valeur l'esleva, la virtue se trahit.
Pour avoir trop servi, l' Espagnol le rendit,
Le Teatre, and l' object de sa malice noire,
L' Honneur qu'on luy ravit illustre la memoire
Il le dit en mourant, and le ciel l'entendit.
Ne t'en estonne pas, les plus dignes services
Souvent en leur chemin trouvent des precipices,
Et de trop Meriter on devient odieux.
Si verra l'en pourtant au succes de la guerre,
Que s'il eut pris plustost place dedans les cieux
L'Espagnol auroit pris moins de places en terre.
Thus rendered into English.

Here Spinola lie's hid, enough is said,
His name hereafter will fill up a story,
Europe in thousand places tell's his glory,
His valeur raised, his virtue him betrayed.
For having served too well, the Dons of Spain
Made him the object of their lured hate,
His ravished honor, give a longer date
This fame, whereof he dying did complain:
But marvel not, the highest services
Meet oft-times with ill-favor'd precipices;
Exces of merit makes men odious:
Yet 'twill appear by the succes of War,
Had Spinola took place in Heaven sooner
Spain had on earth to ane fewer places far.
The King this year had a very hazardous fit of sickness, in so much Anno 1631.
that he was not only prayed for generally throughout all the Churches of
France, but the extreme Onction was once ready to be applied unto him.

About the same time the Q. Mother began to be averse to the Cardinal, which
aversenes came by degrees, to a strong animositie and violent indignation
against him, in so much that notwithstanding the interposition of the Popes
Nuncio, and diverse others, it was found incapable of reconcilement. The ground
of it, as some thought, was, that he had not only advised but incited the King
to war with her two sons in law the Duke of Savoy, and the King of Spain: but
more of this in the Cardinals life apart.

The three Armies which the King had in Italy were mouldred away above the
third part, by the sword, and sicknesses which reigned amongst them; Besides
the King was so drained for money, that he had scarce one thousand pounds
remaining; and the soldiers being ready to disband beyond the Hills for want of
pay, the Cardinal sent of his own moneys two hundred thousand Franks, this kept
the French together in Italy till the Peace was concluded; which was done at
last by the strenuous negotiation and new endeavors of Signieur Mazarini the
Popes Agent extraordinary, and Pancirolle the Nuncio by a Treaty which was
appointed to be held at Querasque: Hereupon there were Commissioners
interchangeably sent from the Emperor and the King of France who managed the
whole business, because the Spaniard would not be seen in it, for he came in
only as an Auxiliary: the two main Articles of this Treaty were in the behalf
of the Dukes of Savoy and Mantova; viz. That the first, should have fifteen
thousand crowns yearly revenu for all rights and pretentions to Montferrat:
That the other should be put in present possession of the Duchyes of Mantova
and Montferrat, and have to that purpose a complete Investiture from the
Emperor. Hereupon there were cautionary Hostages put in the Popes hands till
performance of Articles on both sides; but by a secret capitulation, Susa and
Avigliana which were part of the Hostage, at the violent instance of the French
Commissioners were to be put into the hands of some of the Swiss-Cantons which
were allied to France, in whom, (though Protestants) it seems, the French King
confided more in then in his Holiness; this making of the Grisons Depositaries
gave some coffeehouse to the Spaniard which was accommoded afterward.

These so often traverses ore the Alps, proved costly expeditions to France,
both for men and money; for there was an account made of thirty Millions of
Franks which were expended in these wars, and above one hundred thousand French
perished by the sword, sickness, and famine: there were multitudes also fell on
the other side, and all this hurliburly was chiefly for a mere Ceremony, viz.
an Investiture: and poor Europe has often parted with abundance of her most
precious blood for such Ceremonies, such any shadows, and formalities.

The capitulations of the Treaty at Querasque were put in execution Anno 1631.
by all parties, and the places that were depositated for Hostages in the Popes
and Grisons hands were delivered accordingly on both sides at the time
appointed: But the French after the expense of so much blood and bullion were
loath to part with Italy so, therefore a private Treaty was set a foot 'twixt the
King and the Duke of Savoy about Pignerol; It was propounded, That in regard
his Highness had all his Country entirely restored unto him, though orerun by
the French Arms, and that he had acquired part of Monferrat by the last wars
which conduced more to his advantage then to any others. And that whereas his
most Christian Majesty understood that the Spaniard remained still armed in
Milan, and had some desseins a foot which did menace no small danger both to
the Duke of Mantova, and the confederat Cantons of France; and that he had
intelligence from good hands how there was a Civil War fomenting in France, by
some mistrusts and divisions which were put between his Majesty, his Mother,
and Monsieur: therefore, lest his Highness might be tampered withal to favor
the projects of the Spaniard, to rid him of all scruples in this point, he
desired that Susa and Avigliana, or Pignerol and Perousa might be put into his
hands, to put French Garrisons in them, till these dangers were passed.
Servient the French Ambassador joined with Toiras managed this business so
dexterously that the Duke accorded what was demanded for six months. Hereupon
the Town and Castle of Pignerol with Perousa was put into the hands of the
Suiss which the French had put formerly in Susa: And by the same Treaty his
Majesty obliged himself to defend the person and states of his Highness, if need
required with an Army of twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse; provided
his Highness should proportionably have in readiness ten thousand foot, and
fifteen hundred horse.

The Duke of Feria fell into a fury when he heard of this accord, and called
heaven and earth to witness that it was an evident infraction of the Treaty at
Querasque, by which the French were not to hold any place or passage into Italy
within the states of the Duke of Savoy: So the Duke being lowdly reproached
thereof by the Spaniard, the answer he gave was, That he might dispose of his
own as he pleased, etc.

The six months being expired of holding Pignerol, a motion was Anno 1632.
made to the Duke, that, for his own safety, the security of Mantova, and the
French-Confederat Grisons, as also for freeing his Majesty of all surmises, and
the better enabling him to occur all desseins and dangers, his Highness would
make an absolut sale and transport unto him of the Town and Castle of Pignerol
and Perousa, for a valuable pecuniary consideration* Toiras and Servient
carried themselfs with such dextrous addresses that they induced the Duke to
hearken to this Proposition, and afterward they drew from him an absolut
consent; so a Legal Instrument was made, whereby an irrevocable transport and
vent was made of the propriety, possession, and sovereignty of the Town and
Castle of Pignerol, Riva, Bodenasco, the higher Biacasco, Castagrande, and that
which was within the confines of the said Pignerol, the Village and Abbey of
Valdelemia, as also the Village and Anno 1632.
Fort of Perousa, Pinnacle, Villars, Les port, the great and small Diblon and
their confines, and other lands which are within the valley of Perousa,
(excepting those which depend on the same valley on the left hand going from
Pignerol to Pragelas, beyond the River Chuson) all other places shall be
perpetually united to the Crown of France upon the payment of four hundred
ninety four thousand crowns in good money.

This pourchase of Pignerol brought with it another strong engagement 'twixt
the King and the Duke, viz. a Ligue defensive and offensive, by virtue whereof
the one was to furnish twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse as
formerly; but the Duke was scrued up to a greater number then before, being to
furnish twelve thousand foot, and two thousand horse, upon necessity of
conjunction.

Our story has sojourned a good while in Italy, we must now cross again the
Hills to France, where we find the Queen Mother and the Cardinal
irreconcilable notwithstanding that the King himself labored much in the
business; her passion went so high that she resolved never to sit in Counsel
while the Cardinal was there. This aversnes to the Cardinal was also infused
into Monsieur, who abetted his Mother, and espoused her quarrel; So without
the Kings conge, he retires to Orleans, and thence to Lorain, the Duke of
Bellegarde then Governor of Champany attended him all the way through that
Province, notwithstanding that he had an intimation to the contrary from the
King himself who followed Monsieur as far as Dijon, but he was too swift for
him, and so could not be overtaken. Hereupon a Declaration issued out wherein
the Count of Moret Monsieurs base brother, the Dukes of Elbeuf, of Bellegarde,
and of Roanez, Puylaurens, President Coigneux, and Monsigot, and father
Chanteloube were proclaym'd Traitors, for infusing ill counsels into Monsieur,
and for accompagnying him out of the Kingdom without his Majesty's consent;
this Declaration was sent to be verified by the Court of Parliament at Paris,
the Court paused upon it and excepting against the style and form of it delayed
the verification putting the business in deliberation, yet they all blamed and
unanimously condemned the ill counsels, and proceedings of Monsieur; The King
taking an indignation at this delay, sent for the whole body of the Parliament
to attend him at the Louure, where, by the mouth of the Lord Keeper, they
received a severe rebuke, and the Clerk of the Court bringing with him the
Register of the Act of deliberation upon the former Declaration, was commanded
to draw it off the file, and in the place thereof to put the Arrest of the
Privy Counsel, whereby the said Act was annulled* with express inhibition to
the said Court of Parliament, to put in deliberation for the future any
Declarations of that nature concerning affairs of State, but to proceed
instantly to the verification, and registring of them.

The Queen Mother was now retired to Campeigne, where the Marshall of Estree
had a Garrison which she interpreted to be no other Anno 1631.
then a guard upon her, thereupon the King dismissed the said Garrison: So she
privately got away thence in Madame Frenoys Coach, accompagnied only with the
said Lady, and one of her Chamberwomen to Avenes, which lies within the
Territories of the King of Spain in the 17. Provinces: and thence to Bruxels,
the Archduchesse having come to meet her on the way as far as Mons in Henault.

Monsieur from Lorain, and the Queen Mother from Bruxells writ to the King, and
complained bitterly against the Cardinal how he would have removed her to
Moulins and Angers where the contagion raignd, and so have thrust her into the
jaws of death; she conjured him to think on the relation of Mother and Son,
and that she was the person most interessed in his preservation, yet the
Cardinal had pernicious intentions to make her die between four walls; this
was the cause she left France, and to journey thirty leagues without eating or
drinking; she goes on in declaring how conformable she was to his will in all
things, and how she respected his Authority in the hands of her enemies; and so
concluds that not being suffered to live in France in the calm of her own
innocence, the most sensible misery that could befall her was to be bereft of
his presence, etc. Besides this Letter she sent another to the Parliament at
Paris, with a Remonstrance against the present Government.

The King returns her a harsh Answer, and cleers his Cardinal in all things;
and published a Declaration wherein he disadvowes that she was ever prisoner,
but that she had liberty to choose any place throughout the whole Kingdom to
live in, except Champany, and for more respect she should have the Government
of the place and Province; he declares further that her departure with his
Brothers, was plotted by those that are not only envious but enemies of the
felicity of France; therefore he prohibits and utterly forbids all his subjects
of what quality or condition soever, to have intelligence or correspondence
with his said Mother and Brother, or with any of their domestic servants, or
with those that are partakers of their Counsels under what pretense whatsoever.

Gustavus King of Sweden having by the intercession of the Ambassadors of his
Majesty of Great Britain and France, made his peace with the Pole, strikes into
Germany, and like an impetuous torrent carries all before him for a time. He
enters into an Alliance with France, and in few days the Treaty was concluded,
whereof the Articles were these that follow.

1. The present Alliance which is made betwixt their Majesty's is principally
for the defense of all their oppressed friends, and for the safety of commerce
by Sea; to reestablish all the Princes and Estates of the Empire in the same
condition they were before the beginning of the German war, and to cause all
Forts and intrenchments upon the Baltic Sea to be demolished. 2. To this effect
his Majesty of Sweden does promise to entertain, and conduct upon his own
charge an Army of thirty thousand foot, and ten thousand horse into Germany;
and the King of France promises to contribut every year for the maintenance of
the said Army Anno 1631.
one million of Franks (two shillings sterling a piece) one moity in May, the
other in November next following in Paris or Amsterdam, and that this Alliance
shall last to the first of March in the year 1636. 3. That if it please God to
favor the arms of the King of Sweden he shall not alter or change the
Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion in those places that he shall conquer, but he
shall permit the Inhabitants to have free exercise of their Religion, according
to the Treaty at Passaw, and the constitutions of the Empire. 4. That he shall
keep himself in good friendship and neighborhood with the Elector (so he
called him) of Bavaria, and with the Catholic ligue, or at least in a
neutrality, provided they do the like. 5. That no Peace or Treaty be accorded
by one without the consent of the other. 6. That in regard this Treaty was
begun the last year, and in the interim his Majesty of Sweden has bin at great
expense, in consideration hereof his Majesty of France shall deliver the sum
of three hundred thousand Franks in good Letters of exchange, which ought not
to be deducted out of those sums that were specified before for five years to
come.
These Articles being agreed upon, the King of France sent them to the Bavarian
to approve of, and subscribe them, but the old Duke suspended his resolution
many months, and then the Swed having gained the great Battle of Leipsic
against the Imperialists and the Catholic Ligue, the affairs of Germany
changed face: Charnasse the French Ambassador came from the Swedish Army not
without some complaints to Paris; yet he was sent back with the Marquis of
Breze Ambassador extraordinary to the King of Sweden to solicit still for a
neutrality 'twixt his Army, and that of the Catholic Ligue; which was agreed
upon, provided that the chief of the said Ligue would separat their Forces, and
retire into their own Territories; This declaration of neutrality being brought
to the Bavarian he was willing to sign it, provided that the Swed would restore
what he had taken from the said Catholic Ligue since the Battle of Leipsic;
for after that Battle he had made a monstrous progres and penetrated the heart
of Germany, having now crossed the Rhine (which he had promised not to do
without the French Kings consent) and seized upon the City of Metz where he now
kept a Court Emperour-like; The French Ambassadors proposing unto him a
restitution of what he had taken from the Catholic Ligue, he refused it,
whereupon there were high words passed twixt him, and the Ambassadors, so the
neutrality ceased, and turned to hostility afterward, and the Swed commanded
all Roman Catholics to void the Town of Mentz for fear they had intelligence
with some Spanish Troops that were at Spire; but that order was revoked by the
mediation of the French Ambassadors; so the alliance lasted still twixt the two
Kings.

The King of France a little after this being marched as far as Metz with an
Army for the defense of his Allies, was visited there by Anno 1632.
some German Princes, and the Duke of Lorain came thither in Person, of purpose
to see him, and to scatter some clouds of diffidence and jealousies that were
'twixt the King and him: so a new Treaty was agreed on wherein there were some
Articles very disadvantagious to the Lorrener: As first, That the said Duke
should depart from that time forward from all Intelligences, Ligues,
Associations or Practices, which he had or might have with any Prince or State
whatsoever to the prejudice of his Majesty, his Estates, and Countries under
his obedience and protection; as also in prejudice of the Alliance and
Confederation 'twixt him and the King of Sweden, and 'twixt him and the Duke of
Bavaria for the conservation of the liberty of Germany, and the Catholic Ligue,
and defense of the Princes that are allied and friends to France. Secondly,
That the said Duke shall not treat, or make any Alliance with any Prince or
State whatsoever, without the knowledge and consent of the said King. Thirdly,
That he cause to retire out of his Country all such that are enemies to the
King, and that he shall give neither pass nor safe conduct to any of his
subjects that have gone out of France against his pleasure. Fourthly, That no
Military leavies be made in his Country against his Majesty's service, nor
that any of his subjects serve or assist his enemies. Fifthly, That he shall
give liberty and power to them who shall be sent from the King to seiz upon and
arrest any rebellious subjects being accused and convinced of Treason; These
with other Articles were agreed upon in this Treaty which the King would not
co^mence unles he had first delivered up Marsal a strong tenable place.

In such a posture, as we told you before that Nature had placed the Duke of
Savoy, in the self same posture ( the quality of the soyles excepted) may the
Duke of Lorain be said to be, being situated 'twixt mightier Potentats then
himself, who, as once the Lion did increpat the innocent Lamb for troubling the
waters, may make him the subject of their displeasure and advantage at any time
to devour him: But the Lorrener of the two, is in a worse condition then the
Savoyard, being homageable to the Emperor and the King of France, holding
Lorain in fee of the one, and the Duchy of Bar of the other.

While the Treaty at Vic 'twixt the King and the Duke of Lorain was in
agitation, the Marshall de la Force and Schomberg took Moyenvic, whence they
marchd before the Town of Tryers, the protection of whose Archbishop the King
had undertaken, he being amongst the seven Electors Lord High Chancellor of
France, as he of Collen is of Italy, and he of Mentz of Germany; Tryers in a
short time fell to parley, and so rendered herself upon honorable terms.

In this year there came an Ambassador from the Emperor of Morocco to the
Court of France, who afterward went to his Majesty of Great Britain, taking
France first in his way, as she stood; he brought a Letter in Arabic to this
effect.

God is Our confidence.
These Letters of the most mighty Emperor who being assisted by Divine grace
and favor is always happy, swelling with victory; whose most illustrious Anno
1632.
Court is full of grandeurs and prosperity, are sent to the most Noble, the
most High, and most excellent, Dignity whose Realm within the bounds of
Christendom has the most illustrious name and rank: To the Dignity, I say, of
the most eminent, the most noble, the most happy, and the most renowned
Emperor the King of France and Navar, the Emperor Lewis, son to mighty,
magnificent, famous and magnanimous Emperors: Having wished glory to God the
soverain Master of all Glory and Majesty, whose Empire has no need of any
Counselor, or the assistance of any Prince, whose praises cannot be expressed
by any tongue though never so eloquent; Having rendered the honors which are
due to our Lord Mahomet, most eminent in dignity, most rich in treasure,
preserver of men in the tempestuous day of judgment; we desire of God that the
people made famous by this Prophet be acceptable unto him, that he please to
maintain them ever in his particular protection, and that all they who love him
persist to the end in the exercise of good and laudable actions: And we make
particular prayers for the prosperity of his most high, imperial, prophetic
and most eminent throne, assisted always by God, and wherein by the means of
his invincible force the elect people, and all his subjects are exalted, his
memory and steps remaining to eternity.

This Letter of our high Majesty has bin written from the throne of our Empire
of Maroc, which God by his grace and goodness, and by the benediction of his
Apostle conserve, who does not subsist but by the continual assistance of God,
whose providence never ceasing to assist him serves incomparably more to his
defense then any other of all the Armies of the world, for which we render
infinite thanks to his Divine Majesty, to whom is the sole power, strength and
might, etc.


The Superscription was

To the most renowned and magnificent dwelling, within all the bounds of
Christendom, the most eminent Palace.

The Palace of the most Honorable, the most Noble, the most Mighty Emperor,
the King of France and Navar, the Emperor Lewis.

This Mahumetan Ambassador came from Muley King of Morocco in Barbary for the
redemption of certain slaves that were in Marseilles Galleys, which he
obtained; and in exchange all the French that were Captifs in Saly and other
places belonging to Morocco were released; besides it was agreed that the King
of France might nominat Consuls in those Towns of commerce which were under his
Dominion who should have power to determine any controversy that might
intervene between the subjects of France there traffiquing.

Such a bombardicall Letter he brought also (accompagnied with presents) to the
King of Great Britain, who sent an English Fleet in his favor against the
Pirates, and Rebel- Saint of Saly, who did him much service for reducing the
Town to his obedience.

Don Gonzales de Cordova passing through France to Flanders, came Anno 1632.
to kiss the Kings hands; who sent him a rich sword valued at four thousand
crowns inlay'd with Diamonds, which he refused; and Monsieur Guron conducted
him to Cambray, he refused also the present that Gonzales would have given him,
saying, That he disdained any present from him who refused the bounty of his
King.

The Duke of Lorain receives Monsieur again into his Country, notwithstanding
the former Treaty, and leavies forces for him to enter France; the King being
extremely incensed thereat, marches suddenly toward Lorain, and employes the
forces that was designed for Germany that way, with whom he joined in person
and took diverse places in Lorain; The Duke finding himself unable to resist,
and being in despair of any forces from Flanders, the Spaniard being then busy
at Mastric, he had recourse to a Treaty, which the King yielded unto; The
Treaty was to be held at Liverdun, where the Cardinal met the Deputies of the
Duke; Most of the Articles of the Treaty at Vic were confirmed; and the Duke
was obliged besides to deliver unto him Iamets and Stenay for hostage, and to
make an absolut sale unto him of the County of Clermont for a pecuniary sum:
thus the business was quickly concluded, and the Cardinal of Lorain was to
remain for pledge till the Capitulations were performed.

The Duke of Lorain being thus surpised, was made unable to assist Monsieur as
he expected; nor could he have any supplies from Flanders because of the siege
at Maestrict, yet he enters France with eighteen hundred horse, most of them
strangers, as Liegeois and Crabats; He published a Manifesto to justify his
taking of Arms, Charging Richelieu with the usurpation, and dissipation of
France, and that he had no other intent but to let his Majesty know how much he
was deceived, and so exhorted all good Frenchmen to assist him in his laudable
desseins.

The King caused a counter-Manifesto to be proclaimed, declaring them Traitors
in the highest degree that should adhere to Monsieur, yet if he would lay down
his Arms, and submit himself within the compass of forty days after the
publication of the said Manifesto, he would forget all faults passed, and
Monsieur should find such welcome that he should have cause to extol the Kings
goodness, and detest the pernicious counsels that had bin given him: The King
doubting that words would little prevail without the sword, dispatched Marshall
de la Force with ten thousand foot, and twelve hundred horse to Languedoc,
because he understood that Monsieur would draw in Monmorency to join him, which
he did, with four Bishops more: the Duke of Monmorency then Governor of
Languedoc summons the States together, wherein he declared himself for
Monsieur, and never to separat from his interests till the Government was
reformed.

The King hearing of Monmorencies revolt was extremely incensed, and the more
because he had sent him extraordinary Commission, and money besides to raise
Troops for his service, wherewith he was now ready to bandy against him,
thereupon he commanded his House in Paris to be seized on, and all his goods
inventoriz'd, amongst Anno 1632.
which there were 550000. Franks found in money: He caused a Declaration also
to be published wherein he and all his Adherents were proclaym'd Rebels.

Monsieur and Monmorency were grown so strong that the King in Person with an
Army of twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse went to suppress them:
Some of the Kings Army was about Castle nau-d' Arry, under the command of
Schomberg, where Monmorency in a martial heat, but more in a desperate then
valiant resolution, accompagnied with the Earls of Rieux, and Fevillade, and
only eight horse more faced and set upon the Royalists, broak the ranks of some
of them, killed diverse, and hurt many; but after he was hurt himself in the
face, and in sundry places about his body so that he fell off his horse, and
cried out for a Confessor; so one of his men taking him upon his back, he was
taken prisoner and carried upon a ladder to Castle nau d' Arry: In the said
conflict was killed one of Henry the Great's base sons the Count of Moret, with
the forementioned Earls of Rieux and Fevillade, and the whole Army was routed.

Notwithstanding all these provocations the King sent a gracious Message to
Monsieur inviting him to come unto him, and the same day Monsieur had sent to
the King Chaudebonne with these Propositions: 1. That the Duke of Monmorency
should be released, and reestablish'd in his estate and government, together
with the Dukes of Elbaeuf and Bellegarde: 2. That his Majesty would render to
the Duke of Lorain all the places he detained from him: 3. That an Act of
abolition should pass: 4. That a million of Franks which he had borrowed
should be paid. Whereunto the King made this Answer.

My Brother, the Propositions which Chaudebonne has made me in your behalf,
are so little sortable to my dignity, to the public and your own proper good,
that I cannot return any other answer then what I sent you formerly by Monsieur
Aiguebonne to testify my affection unto you; I pray dispose of your self to
receive the effects of them, assuring you that in so doing I shall forget
what is passed, and shall make it appear unto you more and more that I am your
most affectionat Brother

Lewis.


This Letter was seconded a little after with Articles to this effect. 1. That
Monsieur should acknowledge his fault by writing, and desire the King to forget
and pardon. 2. That he give the best assurance he can not to fall into a
relaps. 3. To have no intelligence with Spain, Lorain or any other strange
Prince, nor with the Queen his Mother as long as she continues in the case she
stands, and to sojourn in what place the King shall appoint him. 4. That he
mingle not his interests with those that were his Accomplices and ill counselors
which must be proceeded against according to law, yet, amongst them his
domestics shall be exempted. 5. That Puy Laurens who suggested these ill
Counsels into him sincerely confess what further practices were intended
against the State, and that he acknowledge himself Anno 1633.
culpable, before he receive grace.

To all these Monsieur subscribed in this form. We Gaston son of France, unic
Brother to the King, Duc of Orleans, Chartres and Valois, Earl of Blois do
consent to what is propounded by his Majesty, and upon the word and faith of a
Prince we promise a religious performance of all the Articles: We promise
besides to conspire with all our power to all the good desseins of the King for
the grandeur and safety of his Kingdoms, and to love them that love his
Majesty, and specially our Cosen the Cardinal of Richelieu, whom we hold to be
necessary to the Person and States of the King for his fidelity.

After this a Declaration was published for all strangers that came in with
Monsieur to quit the Kingdom within 8. days; some of the chiefest instruments
of this sollevation were cut off by the sword of Justice, and amongst other the
four Bishops spoken of before, were legally proceeded against, by a special
Brief from Rome wherein there were four Archbishops nominated as Deligats to
judge them, whereof the Archbishop and Prince of Arles was chief; though the
ancient form of proceeding against Prelates for crimes was used to be by a Synod
of the Gallic Bishops: Not one of the foresaid Delinquent Bishops was condemned
to die, only the Bishop of Albi was deprived of his Bishopric, and confined to
a Monastery to eat the bread of sorrow.

There fell this year upon the Kings return from Narbon through Languedoc in a
sudden shower of rain such huge cataracts of water from the Airie Region, that
two hundred persons were drowned upon the highwayes, four Coches of the Queens,
and fifty Carts were swallowed up in the deluge.

The Duke of Monmorency being taken prisoner was carried to Toulouse where he
was to receive his trial not by his Peers but by the ordinary way of Justice,
he was legally convicted and condemned; there were all means possible used for
his pardon, but the King was inflexible, so with exemplary patience and piety
he pai'd Nature her last tribut; he put off his doublet himself, and cut off
his hair and mustachos before he came to the Block.

Thus fell Henry of Monmorency Duke, Peer, and Marshall, and of the ancientest
extractions of France, in so much that Henry the Great was used to say, that he
was a better Gentleman then himself; the Motto in his Scutcheon was Dieu aid

The Cardinal of Richelieu had at this time a dangerous fit of sickness, so that
a great while the infirmities of his body would not give him leave to exercise
the functions of his soul; A little after his convalescence, there was a
chapter of the Anno 1633.
Knights of the Royal Order, the Holy Spirit, kept, wherein there were forty
nine more created, and the honor was conferred chiefly upon them that had
served against them of the Religion.

The Duke of Lorain appearing more for the House of Austria then the Sweds in
the German war, the King to quarrel with him, demanded homage for the Duchy of
Bar, the Duke waved the performance of this ceremony, alleging that those
homages which were pretended to be done by his Progenitors were but visits and
complements, not any real duties, there being no act upon record for them.

There happend another occasion of displeasure against the Duke in that the
Princess Margaret was married to Monsieur not only without the Kings consent,
but expressly against his command; It being observed that Matches with that
Family have bin fatal, and that Lorain milk have engendered but ill blood in
France. So he arms mainly against the Duke, and being advanced as far as Nancy
the Duke and the Cardinal had conference, but in the interim his sister the
Princess went in Pages apparel out of the Town, and got to Brussels to
Monsieur her husband where the marriage, which was before but clandestin, was
publicly consummated; The Duke did much complement with the King, sending him
word, That if the gates of Nancy were not wide enough to let him in, he would
pull down the walls, to make him entrance: The Duke had a safe conduct to come
to the Kings Army to treat with the Cardinal, who proved too hard for him, in
so much that he was forced to yield that the King should enter Nancy, or remain
prisoner; This made him afterward tax both King and Cardinal with a
contravention of their promises and faith. So Nancy was rendered for a time, and
a French Garrison was placed there, in lieu of the old which consisted of 2300.
foot, and 230. horse. After this the King reestablish'd the Archbishop of
Tryers in his estates, and so returned triumphantly to Paris.

began to think of his return to France; besides the Spaniards began to have
some sinister surmises of him, in regard he did not command a Bonfire to be
made before his house in joy of the Battle at Norlingben; so making semblance
one morning to go a hauking he posted privately to France (leaving his wife and
mother behind) without bidding any farewell, or giving thanks for his
entertainment all the while, which was so costly to Spain; so the King and he
were peec'd again now the fourth time.

and Philipsburg were put into his hands: And because it was expenceful unto
him to keep so many Garrisons in Lorain, he demolished diverse Castles up and
down the Country, whereby the Logic rule was made subservient to Policy,
Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.

France was in an extreme high and triumphant condition at this time; And being
in a perfect tranquillity within doors, she fell upon the establishment of
wholesome laws, therefore diverse Edicts were published; one for the reformation
of Abbeys, another for suppressing the lux and superfluities in apparel, with
an inhibition to wear gold and silver lace, and other gaudy trimmings: a third
for regulating of Military Discipline, and the biliting of Soldiers: a fourth,
that they of the Religion should entertain no strange Ministers. There was also
a Royal Botomicall Garden made in Paris, for the culture of medicinal Plants,
and other curiosities; Moreover there was a company of Merchants erected for
new France in the Indies for the advancement of traffic. And Paris had her
skirts enlarged, the Twilleries, and part of Saint German being brought within
her enclosure.

We will finish this fifth Luster with a remarkable passage that happened in
Italy. Gasper Galilei Galileo a man exactly versed in the Mathematiques, of
profound speculations and high reaches, having more then ordinary inspections
into the motions of heavenly Bodies, (witness that rare Prospectif of his)
published a Book entitled, A Dialogue of the two Systems of the World, of
Ptolomey and Copernicus; Wherein (with the latter) he upholds that the Sun is
the Center of the world standing always still, and that the Earth as the rest
of her fellow Elements together with the Planets and fixed Stars, are in
perpetual motion: In the Convent of Minerva, Galileo recanted this opinion of
the Suns repose, and the Earths motion, because it was opposed to holy
Scripture, and so by consequence a heresy; yet because he had taught it his
Disciples, his punishment was to be in prison during pleasure, his penance was,
that for three years he should repeat the seven penitential Psalms once every
week: a milder sentence far then Vigilius the Bishop had about the times of the
Primitive Church for maintaining there were Antipodes, for which he was
condemned to die, that opinion being held then to be a monstrous Paradox,
though our modern Navigators have long since evinced the truth of it: It has
bin always the method of providence to impart knowledge to mankind by certain
degrees, as we find it true commonly in our Mundan negotiations, that posterior
dies, est prioris Magister; I could enlarge my self further upon this Theme
were it pertinent to my main historical subject, but being not, I put a period
to it, and to this fifth Luster.

The sixth Luster of the Life of Lewis Anno 1635.
the thirteenth.
THis Luster begins with sound of Drum and Trumpet more lowdly then any of the
former, it begins with an open rupture of the peace 'twixt the two mighty
Monarques of France and Spain: It Is true, there had bin formerly, ever since
the beginning of the German wars, and those of Italy and the Grisons some
clashings and counterbuffs between them, but it was in an Auxiliary collateral
way, each of them (according to his several interest) reaching his hand to his
friend, and assisting his Confederat, and those which put themselfs under their
protection; but this year you shall find there will be public professed enmity
by cry of Herald proclaimed between the two Kings though brothers, each of them
having one another sister in their beds for twenty years together.

The House of Austria had had an extraordinary good year of the last, for after
the Battle of Norlinghen, which was the greatest victory he obtained (except
that of Prague against the Prince Palatine) since the beginning of the German
wars, he pushed on his good fortune and invaded the Territories of the Duke of
Wittemberg and Marquis of Baden or Durlas; besides he sets upon the City of
Triers and seizes upon Her, with her Archbishop the Elector, whom he carried
away prisoner notwithstanding that he had put himself under the shadow of the
Flower-de-luce: Add hereunto that by the advantage of ice he took the strong
Tower of Philipsburg, where the French were put to the sword, and the Germans
spared; The reduction of this place was of such consequence, that it helped to
secure Heidelberg, Manheim, Worms, Spire, Frankfort, Mentz, Crusnack,
Frankindal and Treves, all which places were mastered by the Imperialists.

Though all these were properly the Emperors acts, yet France and Holland
fathered them upon the Spaniard who contributed, that which is the greatest
sinew of War, viz. Money to assist his Uncle. And being sensible of these
mighty progresses and growth of the House of Austria, they thought it high time
to look about them, so there came Commissioners extraordinary from Holland to
Paris, and a Ligue defensive and offensive was struck between them to make a
social conjunctive war in the Netherlands against the King of Spain* the most
material Articles of which Ligue, for we are loath to stuff this History with
formalities, were these.

1. The King of France shall have an Army of 25000* foot, and 5000. horse upon
the frontiers of France toward the Netherlands in the convenientest place; And
the States of the united Provinces shall have 20000. foot, and 8000. horse. 2.
Of these two Armies one shall send the other 10000. foot, and 2000. horse as
Auxiliaries in case the enemy shall succor any place which either of them
shall besiege, and if occasion require both Armies Anno 1635.
shall join in one body. 3. It is accorded that a Declaration be sent to all
the Towns under the King of Spain in the Netherlands, to assure them that there
shall be no Innovation introducd which may prejudice their privileges, and
that the exercise of Religion be left free. 4. That all other Princes and
States who shall desire the protection of France and the united Provinces may
enter into this Ligue, provided they take up arms against the Spaniard. 5.
That if any Towns yield themselfs of their own accord, it shall be lawful for
them to mould themselfs into the body of a particular State. 6. That there may
be no difference in parting what shall be taken, it is agreed that France shall
have all Flanders from the frontiers of France as far as Blanquemberg near the
Sluice: And the States shall have all the Maritim places beyond toward France as
far as the River of Swyn: That Artois and Henault as far as Navar inclusively
shall be the Kings of France: And the States shall have Hulst, Malines, and
Brabant, as far as Brussells. 7. That no places which shall be taken be
troubled for matter of Religion, but that it be continued in the same state
it is found. 8. That no Treaty for Truce or Peace be set a foot with the
Spaniard, without the reciprocal consent of both parties. 9. That for a more
regular way in proceeding, this Order shall be followed, to attempt first, two
places allotted for the share of France, and then two of the shares of the
States, which order shall be successively observed. 10. That if the King invade
Flanders, the States with a diverting Army shall enter Brabant; and if the
States are engaged in Brabant the King shall have a diverting Army in Artois or
Hanault. 11. That the King of Great Britain may enter into this Confederacy, to
which effect there shall be Ambassadors employed unto him from both parties to
know of him whether he will continue upon terms of Neutrality. 12. It is
accorded further that both parties shall have fifteen men of War at Sea a piece
of so many Tonns; and if any English ships desire to join with the said Fleet
they shall have the precedence of them of the States. 13. If any Treaty be
agreed unto for Peace or Treaty it shall be kept in the Hague, and no where
else. 14. In regard of this Treaty the obligation shall cease to furnish the
States yearly with two millions of Franks which was used to be sent them from
France, etc.
These Articles being interchangeably signed and ratified in Paris; there
issued a large public Declaration from the King to denounce war with Spain to
this effect.

Lewis by the grace of God King of France and Navar, to all who shall see these
present Letters, health. The great and sensible offenses this Monarchy Anno
1635.
has received diverse times from that of Spain are so well known to all the
world, that it is needles to renew their memory: We have a long time dissembled
the hatred and natural jealousy the Spaniards have against France, whereby
they have always stopped the course of Our prosperity by secret practices,
oppressed the Princes allied to this Crown, and sought to dismember the
Kingdom; Therefore with those forces which God has given Us We have resolved
to prevent their further desseins upon Us, and rather to carry Our Arms within
their Country, then expect theirs in Ours, etc. Then He goes on to enumerat
the obligations that Spain had to France for making the last truce with the
Hollander, which Spain had so much need of at that time; the good Offices he
had done the Emperor upon the beginning of the troubles in Germany; so he
taxes him that the first recompense which France received was the occupation of
the Valtolin from the Grisons the ancient Allies of France; he complains
further that the Treaty at Mouson was not executed as it was intended; He
speaks of sundry enterprises upon the Duke of Savoy while he was Confederat of
France, of the violent oppression which the Duke of Mantova suffered; How the
Duke of Lorain armed five times against France by the suscitation of the King
of Spain; How the said King Treated with the chief of them of the Religion to
form a perpetual body of Rebellion in the bowels of France at that time when
he promised assistance against them; How his Ambassadors continually practiced
to sow division between them of the Royal Family; How he assisted with men and
money those that made rents and factions in France; How to bring about his far
fetched designs for the Western Monarchy, he made Flanders his Arcenal for
Arms, not only to subdue them whom he had acknowledged free and soverain, but
to keep France in perpetual jealousy of surprisals by a veteran Army;
therefore he thought it more honorable to attain unto a sound secure Peace by
the generous strength of an open war then let his subjects drop away by small
numbers, and languish under a doubtful and uncertain Peace which must be
conserved with 150000. men. Then he comes to speak of the outrage that was done
to the Archbishop of Triers, and the jeering illusory answer which was returned
about his liberty; Then he speaks of his most deer great friends, Allies, and
Confederats the States of the united Provinces with whom he had made a Ligue
defensive and offensive, but with this Proviso, that what Towns or places
whatsoever were taken, the Catholic Religion should not be damnified, but
conserved still in the same condition; Then he makes his address to the
Flemins that if within two months they cause the Spaniards to retire from
their Towns and Provinces, they shall be joined and united into a body of one
free and independent State, with all rights of sovereignty: So he concluds with
an Injunction to all his subjects to make war by sea and land, night and day
against the King of Spain a declared Enemy to his Person and state; protesting
before God and men that as he was reduced to the utmost extremity to take up
arms for his own defense, and for his Allies and Anno 1635.
friends, so his main end, and only aim was to procure an universal and well
grounded peace throughout Christendom.

Before this Declaration was divulged a Herald of Arms was sent to Brussells
where he publicly pronounced war against the King of Spain in the Market place,
and so in every Town at his return to France, and he passed to and fro without
any outrage at all.

The King had five Royal Armies in motion this Summer; the first in Lorain
under the Duke of Angoulesme, and de la Force; the second under the Cardinal de
la Valette in Germany, wherewith Bernard Weymer joined: The third was under the
Duke of Crequy in Italy, wherewith the Savoyard and Parmasan joined: The fourth
was under the Duke of Rohan, wherewith the Venetians and Grisons joined to
conserve the Valtolin: The fifth was under the Marshall Chastillon in Picardy.

The first did some exploits, against the Duke of Lorain, where Ihon deWert,
Coloredo, and the Baron of Clinchant took Saint Mihel and other places.

The second under de la Valette who had Coronell Hebron and diverse Scots of his
Army, and having taken Binghen* and other places, he had a shrewd conflict with
Galas near Boulac, where a great many of French Nobles and Gentlemen were
slain, so that this Army made not so good returns as the first.

The third under Rohan thrive well, he fortified many places in the Valtolin,
and had a shrewd fight near Bormio, defeated Sarbellon, and 3000. were slain
upon the place.

The fourth under Crequy performed much in Italy, diverse places were taken in
the Country of Alexandrin, but laying a siege before Valentia he was forced to
raise it.

The fifth under Chastillon had the best fortune of any, for being to join with
the Prince of Orange at Maestricht, he met in the way with Prince Tomaso at
Avein near Namur, where after a tough serious fight above 3000. of the enemies
fell, 1500. men taken prisoners, 95. Colors, and 16. pieces of Ordnance. After
this exploit the French Army marchd toward Maestricht through the Country of
Liege where Chastillon met with the Prince of Orange and Bovillon, there were
high acclamations of joy at the conjunction of both Armies who came to the
number specified in the Treaty, all effectif men: Add hereunto that there was a
third Army of the Duke of Bovillons; In so much that there was never since the
beginning of the Belgique war a greater and more numerous body of Military
strength at one time, an Army able to gain an Empire, for it was composed of
near upon 70000. combatants whereof there were above 10000. horse; but their
achievements and succes was not answerable to their power, for they took but
two mean Towns Tillemont and Die and the Castle of Dormaet; the first was
pitifully pillaged, nor could the French soldiers be kept within any limits of
awe but they did violat and plunder both Churches and Convents, and committed
many other strange Anno 1635.
outrages; The Armies then marched as far as Brussells, and took prisoners out
of the very suburbs, but it was held neither safe to sit down before the place,
nor a thing feasible to take it, the Cardinal Infant being entrenched not far
off in a very advantageous post; therefore the Armies came before Lovain, where
they presently began their batteries, the Marquis of Varennes with diverse
French fell there and diverse more; They of the Town made a furious sally upon
the English quarters, wherein Sir Charles Morgan was hurt, and eighty more
slain, but in a short space they were repelled to the Town with a considerable
loss; They made two brave sallies more upon Chastillons quarters a little
after; but the tenth day the siege was raised, and the Town quite cleared of so
vast an Army; the reasons of the raising of this siege were, first, a great
necessity of provision; the second the strength of the enemy, for Piccolomini
was come to Namur with a fresh Army; lastly, the ignorance they had of the
quality of the place in point of strength, and her neernes to the greatest
Towns in Brabant, as Antwerp, Brussells, Malines, with other.

These huge Armies being retreated from before Lovain, the nimble Crabats did
notably plague their reeres; and carried away good booties; Die was also
repris'd, and the French Army being before Venlo news came that the famous
Sconce of Schenk was taken by the Spanish Garrison of Gueldres; as also that
the Duke of Saxe the potentest Prince of Germany, and the Dictator of the
Protestants had made his peace with the Emperor; besides that Iean de Were had
invaded, and extremely ravaged Lorain up and down, which made Chastillon trusse
up his baggage, and leave Venlo and think upon homewards: Thus this formidable
French Army melted away to a small number, nor could they who were left, know
which way to return to France; so most of them were sent by Sea from Flushing
and other places; nevertheless had their retreat bin answerable to their first
entrance into the Netherlands when Chastillon gained such a notable victory of
Prince Tomaso, they had made a gallant Expedition of it; but it was observed
that after their sacriledges at Tillemont the Wind blew always in their faces,
and nothing prosper'd with them.

Besides sundry good successes by Land, the Spaniard this year had some
prosperous gales at Sea; for the Duke Fernandin, and the Marquis de sancte Cruz
took from the French, with 22. Galleys and 5. Galeons, two Islands in the
Mediterranean, called Sancta Margarita, and Saint Honorat; which much
prejudiced the Trade of Provence, and all maritime commerce to Italy.

Young Oxenstern the Chancellor of Swedens son came in a gay equippage
Ambassador to France this year; he was treated with no common esteem, and at
his departure the King took off his finger a rich Ring which he wore that day
of purpose to give him; The said Oxenstern passing over to England upon the
like employment, though his reception was altogether as good, and his present
as valuable, yet he refused the latter.

The maritim might, and navall power of France never appeared Anno 1636.
more then this year; for the King being very sensible of the loss of his
Islands near Provence assembleth all the great ships which could be found in
the Ports of Normandy, Britainy, Poitou, and Guyen to the number of 59.
vessels, wherein there were embarked near upon 6000. men, and they carry 400.
pieces of Ordnance; the first rendevous was at Rochell, the Count of Harcour
was appointed General, and Sourdis the Archbishop of Bourdeaux Admiral, they
lanc'd out into the main, and coasting Spain without any rencounter they entered
the Mediterranean; the Fleet of Province was then also in a readiness which
consisted of 12. Galleys, of which squadron the Bishop of Nants was Director in
chief, who, with him of Bourdeaux, left his spiritual See, to try his fortunes
on the salt Sea; he was embarked in the gran Galeon of the Duke of Guyses, of
1200. Tonns; there was another squadron also of the galleys of France, whereof
the Count Pont Courlay was General, there was a short fight twixt them, and
the Spanish Fleet near the foresaid Islands, but no great hurt done, nor any
thing performed to any purpose.

During these traverses at Sea, there was notable doings by Land, for
Piccolomini and John de Were, entered and overwhelmed Picardy like two
impetuous torrents, and carried all before them, they ravaged and plundered most
lamentably the poor Pesans and Villages all along, they took la Capelle, nor
could the strength the Count of Soissons had in that Province withstand them;
the Prince of Conde was then beating the walls of Dole, but having long layn
before the Town, and having spent much powder, and a considerable number of men
before her, he was forced to raise the siege, to make head against those
fearful incursions the Imperialists made up and down Picardy; their Army
consisted of diverse squadrons of Germans, Polanders, and Crabats; Soissons met
with the Pole, and caused him to retire to Luxemburg; where he took breath, and
afterward came on more furiously then before, he took Moniauban, and three
places more which he fired, and carried away men, women and children: Prince
Tomaso was chief of these flying Armies which in all consisted of above 15000.
horse, and so many foot; They took afterward Catelet, and pushed on their
march as far as the River of Sum where they seized on Bray, and crossed the
River, took Roye with diverse other places: being thus got into the very bowels
of Picardy the Crabats had a brave time of it who subsist chiefly by pillage,
they rob Churches, cloisters, Convents, Monasteries, and the Altars themselfs,
nor can the opinion of holiness exempt any thing from rapine; a little after
Corby rendered her self, and then a general summons was published in the King
of Spaines name for all the Towns of Picardy to render themselfs, and they
should have good quarter.

This sudden inundation of so many foreign people, and such monstrous
incursions, struck an earthquake into the hearts of all men, and Paris her self
trembled more then any place; many thousands of people had fled thither from
Champany, Brie, Picardy, high Normandy, Anno 1637.
as also from the Isle of France it self for refuge, Nunns, Friars, and Priests
left their Monasteries, Cells and Cloisters, panting with apprehensions of
fears, and imminent dangers; Nay, the Parisians themselfs thinking their Town
not secure enough fled away in multitudes toward the Loire.

This gave a general alarm to the whole Kingdom, and Paris quaked more then
any place, in so much that she began to fortify apace, the Burgesses by the
Provosts command, and the Scholars by the Rectors, put themselfs in arms:
there were extraordinary contributions made, and 15000. men suddenly raised to
go toward Picardy: Monsieur was appointed General, who in his march increased
daily more and more in great numbers, to make head against this formidable
Invasion, or rather Irruption.

The common people being thus startled and scared, one might hear up and down
both in Town and Country whole volleys of curses discharged upon Richelieu,
who was cried up to be the source of all these evils, because they conceived
'twas by his counsel the King had denounced open war against the Spaniard the
year before; but the strong reflex of Royal favor, and the former good
successes he had, took away much of the gaul against him.

The Royal Army under Monsieur, who was accompagnied with the flower of all
the Nobility of France, and was now near upon forty thousand Combatants, being
advanced far into Picardy, the first exploit he performed was the reprisall of
Roye by siege, then he took Bretevil; but a little before John de Were had
given a smart blow to the Count of Esfeld who had a Brigade of Germans, and a
good number of French horse commanded by Gassion for the Kings service. The
Royal Army came before Corbie at last, where a Leager was planted seven
Leagues compass, and the Town held them good play for diverse months, whence
the Spaniards made sundry notable sallies.

The Imperial Army under Galas was now got into Burgundy, where he took
Mirebeau, and sundry other places which he pillaged and burnt; in the interim
the Duke of Lorain who commanded one of the flying Armies had laid siege
before Saint John de Lone, and Galas recruted him with men, and ammunition, but
the place being relieved, and it being now near the dead of Winter, Galas gave
out he had order to return to Germany which he did, and so the Duke of Lorain
raised his siege, and sent diverse complaints to the Emperor against Galas his
General, but they came to nothing.

Thus that huge deluge ceased in France, which did such a world of mischief
that the Goths, Vandalls, or Saracens never did the like for the time, nor was
this the sole disaster that befell France this year, for the Viceroy of
Pampelona took Saint John de Luz the other side the Kingdom; besides Mentz,
Coblens, and Hanaw were rendered to the Imperialists, in all which much of the
Garrisons were French: I will conclude this year with the public baptism of
Mademoiselle, Monsieurs daughter, being nine years and three months old, which
ceremony Anno 1637.
was solemnized in the Louure, the Queen of France, and her Cardinal were her
godmother and godfather, and she was named Anne Marie.

This year a more propitious Planet cast an influence upon France, then fell
upon her in the former, as will appear by the succes of things; We will begin
with the reprisall of the Isles of Lerins, called Saint Margaret and Saint
Honorat: some of the Provensall Gentlemen showed much Passion for the honor of
their Country to which those Islands belonged, by diverse proofs of valeur, and
their names were enroul'd in a public instrument which stands upon record to
posterity in the Court of Parliament; there were mighty preparatives made for
the said Expedition, and sundry persons of quality parted with their blood, and
some with their life's in the quarrel; but whether the benefit did countervail
the vast charge of recovering two or three small rocks it was much questioned,
yet the work was done, and it left behind it an astonishment of the navall
power of France.

The King had three Land Armies this Spring toward the Frontiers of the
Netherlands; the first toward Cambray commanded by the Duke de la Valette; the
second toward Artois whereof Milleray was chief; the third under Chastillon
upon the Frontiers of Champany and Luxemburg: The first took two or three
Castles by surprise, and then sat before Landrecy, which after a stubborn
siege was yielded at last to De la Valette, the exploit was reputed the
greater, because in times passed Charles the Emperor had lain before Landrecy
with thirty thousand foot, and fifteen thousand horse six months together, and
then was forced to steal away in the night from before the place; After this
the Duke of Candale took Beaumont; la Capelle was also rendered after the brunt
of a short siege. But a hotter siege and soil calls me now to the Pyreney
Hills, where the Spaniards had entrenched themselfs strongly before Leucate a
Frontier town twixt Languedoc and Cataloma with a resolution to carry it: The
Duke of Halluin was employed upon this service, assisted by the Archbishop of
Bourdeaux; Of the Spaniards the Count of Serbellon an Italian and a great
Captain was Commander in chief; there happened many bloody, and exceeding hot
skirmiges betwixt the two Nations, but at last the Spaniard was forced to quit
his trenches and leave thirty two great Guns of all sorts behind him, with the
loss of three thousand men; Amongst the dead bodies some women were found
habited like men, which being showed the Spaniards that were taken prisoners,
and asked what women they were, they answered, Those poltrons that fled away
were women, not these; with this agrees a Rodomontado a Captain left upon a
wall, O Frenchmen, if you had comported your selfs in this encounter as you
have used to do; and if we had showed our selfs such men as the world cries us
up to be, your actions had bin ours, and ours yours. The Spaniards which were
taken prisoners would salute the French Gentlemen by the title of Seno^res
Lutheranos, thinking that to be a complement would please them: Serbellon made
three Anno 1637.
assaults upon the Town, the two first with iron Bullets, the last with gold
Pistols, viz. the proffer of fifty thousand crowns to the Governor for a
rendition, but it took not.

The King was so well pleased with this service that he conferred honors upon
diverse of the Commanders, and especially upon the General, to whom he writ
this following Letter to be Marshall of France.

To my Cosen the Duke of Halluin, Marshall of Schomberg.
My Cosen, you have known how to serve me so well with your sword, that I send
you a Truncheon; as well for a mark of the contentment which I have received,
as also that hereafter you may make choice of your arms, if my enemies present
themselfs in any place where you may make them again know your valor; I never
bestowed grace with a better heart, then I do this, to perpetuat in your person
the name of Marshall of Schomberg, which having bin acceptable to me in the
person of the father, will be no less in that of the son: So I pray God, my
Cosen, that he hold you in his blessed guard.

Lewis.


Questionles this was a piece of service of high merit, and of mighty
consequence to France, for had the Spaniard nestled in Leucato a strong tenable
place, they had had a key to enter presently into Languedoc at pleasure: the
said young Duke of Halluin stirred himself notably, and going in the front of
his Troops always with his naked sword had received diverse hurts; nor did the
Spaniards who had above twelve thousand foot, and two thousand horse, show
themselfs cowards, for notwithstanding the Town pelted them on the one side,
and the Royal Army on the other which was greater in number then they, yet
they sallied out of their Trenches, and encountered them five several times.

This siege of Leucato was contemporary with that of Breda by the Hollanders
this year, before which the Prince of Orange lay so close and secure, that as
the Cardinal Infant could not hinder his first intrenchment, so he could not
afterward oblige him to fight; but having twenty thousand foot, and six
thousand horse, he struck into Gueldres and took Venlo and Ruremond: So Breda
was given for lost, and after three months siege she yielded upon the same
terms that Spinola had given twelve years before; though he lay five times
longer before the Town: The Prince of Orange made his entrance the ninth of
September at the same gate which Marquis Spinola had erected with this
memorable Inscription in huge golden Characters.

This year Fortune began to frown first upon the Spaniard, and where she once
fixes her frowns she does not suddenly remove them, but wrinckles her forhead
more and more, as will appear in the subsequent passages.

We will conclude this year with the conversion of Francis Cupif a Doctor of
Sorbon to the Reformed Religion; whereupon the Faculty of Theology pronounced
this rigid Decree against him.

It is very properly, and with great reason that the Apostle ranks Heresies
amongst crimes, and carnal sins, because we often perceive, that by a secret
judgment of God, those use to fall, and tomble into them, who swelling with
the vanity and confidence of their own sense, or walking according to the
flesh, suffer not themselfs to be led by the Spirit of God, nor believe that
they are tied to any rule, but they taste nothing but what pleases man as he is
a sensitive Animal: Whereof Francis Cupif of Angers whom the Sacred Faculty had
nourished before in her bosom, and at last unhappily received into the number
of her Doctors, to the great scandal of all good men, and the applause of the
enemies of the Cross of Christ, has lately given a horrid, and most
deplorable example. For according to the honor that was conferred upon him in
our School, not minding the law he had received from so good a mother, which
might have drawn down upon his head all graces from God and men, and having
quite forgot the oath which he had made so often, and whereunto according to
ancient institution all new graduats, and all such who are promoted to the
degree of Doctorships are solemnly obliged; He is miserably fallen from the
holy Catholic Church, whereby he has drawn upon himself the loss of his soul
before God, shame and infamy before men, and malediction from all parts; This
imprudent son is become the grief and sadness of his Mother, then, when by a
perfidious prevarication abjuring the true Doctrine, he has most impudently
turned Heretic, giving up his name to impiety and falsehood. But whence can it
proceed, that he should so easily fall into so fearful a precipice, but from
the natural presumption of his own judgment, and from the ardor of unbridled
pleasure, wherewith they that nearly knew him perceived that he incessantly
burnt? Whence it comes to pass that being blinded, and walking continually
according to his own covetousness, having shaken off the sweet and light yoke
of Jesus Christ, he is become a voluntary slave to Heresy, which is the height
of all sins. It being therefore true, that, as the Christian Emperors said,
Whatsoever is attempted against Divine Religion becomes injurious to all, with
greater reason the Sacred Faculty of Theology has believed that the wrong
which is done Jesus Christ, and to the Catholic faith by this degenerat child,
did concern her so far as to pronounce a grave censure according to the
atrocity of the crime, against such a notorious infamy, and to separat him
totally from Anno 1637.
Her, and her noursery, though it be nothing at all to be feared that such
Bastard Plants will take any deep roots. Cursed be thou degenerat Child, which
go on after thine own counsel, not according to mine, which warpest a web,
but not by my direction, which do add sin to sin, which go down to Egypt,
and to the Synagogue of Satan, and consultest not with me, nor remembrest my
precepts; Thou have rejected my discipline, hoping for succor in the help of
Calvin and his followers, and have confidence in the shadow of Egypt, that is
to say, in the conventicle of Heretics; but this imaginary strength shall
become thy confusion, and the confidence of this shadow, which thou followest
in despising the body of the Orthodoxal Church, shall turn to thy shame. So an
Anathema was pronounced, and publicly fixed up against him.

Duke Bernard Weymar descended of the eldest House of Saxony Anno 1638.
whose Ancester was outed of that great Duchy, for deserting Rome by Charles
the Emperor, had besides his Germans a considerable Army of French upon the
Kings pay, who did notable feats up and down; he was now laid down before
Rhinfield one of the Forest Towns (having taken two of them before) belonging
to the House of Austria, he had after two stormings made a breach in the walls,
when John de Were, the Duke of Savelli, and other choice men appeared
inexpectedly with nine Regiments of horse, and four thousand foot to raise the
siege; General Sperheucher was also there, and two companies of Crabats: There
happened two furious fights betwixt them, in the first de Were had the better
by taking four Canons, and three Cornets of horse, the Duke of Rohan was in the
field as a Volontier being newly come from his employment in the Valtolin, his
horse was killed under him, and he himself wounded in two or three places; the
siege of Rhinfield was raised for the time, but Bernard Weymar sought out de
Were the next day, and having rallied all his forces and put himself in
battalia, there was a gallant though bloody fight, and victory fluttered a
great while with doubtful wings, but at last John de Were himself, Duke
Savelli, Sperheucher, Major General Enkenfort, with all the chief Commanders
were taken prisoners; amongst whom John de Were, and Enkenfort were carried
prisoners to France, and committed to Bois de Vincennes. So Duke Bernard Weymar
took Rhinfield by a second siege presently after.

The Duke of Rohan being carried with his wounds about him to Swisserland, died
of them within a little time, and his body was carried in great pomp to Geneva
where he was buried: a Duke of high descent being prime Prince of the blood of
the Kingdom of Navar, whereupon it was said of him, Rohan ie suis, Roy ie ne
puis, Prince, ie dedagne. Rhoan I am, King I cannot be, Prince, I disdain it.
He was excellently versed both in the Theory, and Prastic part of War, and
other political knowledge, as appears by his works, and by his exploits in the
Valtolin and else where; Some there are who brand him to have bin a Pensioner to
Spain receiving fourteen thousand crowns and his Brother Soubize eight thousand
from that King for diverse Anno 1637.
years, to puzzle France with intestin broils: He died without male issue, and
so that bloud-royal Duchy of Navar extinguished.

There were hot doings now in Italy, one of the grounds of the quarrel was
'twixt the King of Spain, and the Duke of Parma; The Spaniard alleged that by
capitulations with the former Dukes, he was upon occasion of war to have the
Town of Placentia for his use to put men and ammunition in during the war; The
Duke disadvowed any such obligation, and was abetted by France and Savoy in the
quarrel: Victor Amadee Duke of Savoy who had married the second daughter of
France being dead the year before, and the Count of Veriie his General, the
Duke of Crequy came to be Commander in chief, and going to releeve Breme which
the Marquis of Leganez Governor of Milan had closely begirt, Crequy as he was
surveying the enemies trench, and vaunting that he would convey succor to the
Town over the Spaniards mustachos, he was cut in the middle by a Cannon bullet,
and so shatterred to pieces, and the cross he wore upon his breast was shot
into his flesh, so Breme rendered her self. This Marshall Crequy was a brave man
both for command and personal valor, having fairly killed in duel one of the
bastard sons of Savoy in sight of two Armies some years before; there was a
Latin Epitaph written upon him, which in respect of the pertinent apposit
words, and the gallantry of the style I think worthy to have room in this
story, for I have not met with a better.

D. Caroli de Crequy Elogium funebre.
AD sonum ruinae, cujus fragor adhuc
Europam occupat,
Tormento bellico Crequius occubuit,
Minori telo non poterat;
Eminus Mors peremit, saepe frustra
E propinquo tentaverat;
Priori displosione pulveris nubem excitavit,
Ut secundas insidias tegeret;
Alterum globum impegit in terram
Vel attingere verita,
Vel antequam attingeret venerata;
Abrumptum est corpus in membra, jacere
Eodem in loco tanta ruina non poterat;
Quod colligi potuit, hic jacet, magnitudo
Cladis ubique est:
Nec incautum mors oppressit, ea die
AEternitati studuerat,
Ante hor am animum sacramentis praepararat,
Ut praestaret aeternum, dum facit divinum;
Horam reliquam non substraxit aeternitati, Anno 1638.

Dum impendit Regi:
Appensam e collo crucem fatalis globus
Impressit cordi,
Ut moreretur in vulneribus propriis,
Et cum vulneribus Christi.
Sensit cor admotum Deum, amavit and vixit:
Emendavit amores humanos hic amor ultimus:
Continuatus est aeternitati, ne eum tempus corrumperet,
Reperiri ultra in terris cor coelo dignum non potuit,
Duae res sursum extulerant, Crux quam attigit, Amor quo arsit.
Postquam attigerat Deum tegi humo non debuit,
Neque hospes aeternitatem ingressus est, ad
quam tot eleemosynas praemiserat,
Ut festive beneficus esset, praemittere se aiebat
ad coelum divitias, ne illic pauper esset;
Nullibi securius latere Opes, quam ubi Deus,
Et faelicitas latet.
Abi Viator, nec ruinam defle qua Crequius
in aeternitatem cecidit;
Ea hora extinctus est, quae illi ad
immortalitatem optanda fuit.
Redi Viator, and disce qualem vitam AEternitas
inchoavit, diem clausit,
Vix unquam tot lauros fulmen messuerat, si
laurus fulmen timeret,
Centum Heroum nepos elogia omnium sua fecit,
Magnanimus, Audax, sapiens, dignus
gentilitiis meritis et suis,
Servabat ei virtus haec cognomina, nisi
Majores praeripuissent,
praelusit tamen Nepoti, dum ea Avis imponeret;
Iis titulis Ducem, Parem et Marescallum addidit,
additurus Conestabilem,
Nisi haec aetas tot Conestabiles haberet,
quot Marescallos habet.
Conestabili de Lediguieres in Generum datus est,
Ut Heroum filius, Gallici Martis alumnus esset;
Sub eo Magistromature vincere coepit, ut diu vinceret,
Ea aetate militiae Magister, qua vix alii sunt Tyrones:
Nulla est Galliae Provincia ubi non vicerit hosts Regios,
Nulla occasio in qua non vicerit suos,
Renovavit gentilitii vexilli praerogativam,
dum renovavit victoriam
Iterum hoc clamore Gallico dignus
A Crequy, Crequy le gran Baron null ne s*y frotte.
Tot ultra Alps victorias retulit, ut Galliam Anno 1637.

Cisalpinam restaurare potuerit,
Nisi Gallia Italiam sociam babere mallet,
quam subditam;
Subaudiam, and Subalpinos sic expugnavit hostis,
ut Verruca una non steterit,
Si defendit Amicus, ut Verruca una non perierit,
Nec dubium quin servasset Bremam qui Verrucam servaverat,
Nisi hostis absentem peremisset, ne praesentem fugeret:
Nec tenacior fuit Regiae fidei, quam Divinae,
Utramque obsignavit suo sanguine, ut testatam
faceret, dum facit purpuream,
Inflictam ab Haeresi plagam medio in vultu
ostentabat ut gemmam,
Nec insignior Gallicae fidei clientaris Legatus
ire Romam potuit,
Quam qui insignia Fidei in oculis gerebat,
Tacente lingua loqui haec plaga potuit,
Qualis esset fides Gallica,
Cujus Rex Apostolus, Marescalli Martyrs essent.
Nec siluit lingua Crequii, cujus urbanitas
Urbano sic placuit,
Ut in eo amaverit Palladem, et agnoverit Martem,
Romanum patrocinium sic optavit Galliae,
ut Gallicum obtulerit Romae:
Nec silebit unquam haec lingua cui Fama pro voce erit,
Continuabit lauds lituo, quas Mors intonare coepit tubo bellico,
Erravit Mors in Crequio, laudavit dum peremit,
Inchoavit Elogium quod Fama absolvet, et AEternitas canet.
Nec unquam exarescet Arbor Crequia, cujus
tot rami in poster is virent,
Videbit finem Galliae, quae initium vidit,
Immortalis futura si tales semper nascantur surculi*
Abi viator, and ut mortem fallas,
Incipe immortalis esse, dum moreris.
General Crequy being thus cracked by a Cannon, the Spaniard took Breme,
besieges Verselli, which notwithstanding it was once succored by the French
was rendered him upon the same terms that Don Pedro de Toledo had given the
very same month when she was taken in the year 1625.

France had better fortune this year by repelling the invading forces of Spain,
then by entering her confines another way for revenge: We made mention a little
before how bravely Leucato was preserved, and to cry quittance with the
Spaniard, the Prince of Conde had a vast high Commission to be the Kings
Lieutenant General in the Provinces of Guyen, Languedoc, Navar, Bern, and Foix,
with plenary power to command all the Gentry, and make whom he would to Anno
1638.
mount a horseback for the war, as also the Cominalty, to form the body of an
Army to invade the territories of Spain; so he pitched upon Fontarabia; he took
Iroon, and Ouyarson, Berha, with other small places of advenues in the way, and
so he sat before the Town where the Pioner put presently spade in earth for a
circumvallation.

The Archbishop of Bourdeaux came with a mighty Fleet by Sea to second this
enterprise, and the siege having lasted above threescore days, he offered with
his rondaches, and by an assault Seaward to carry the Town; Hereupon a Counsel
of War was called where the Duke de la Valette, who was Lieutenant General to
the Prince of Conde, spoak very gallantly that he and the Marshall de la Force
had bin the chiefest Actors in that achievment thitherto, that he had made a
breach in the walls, after the springing of two mines, and done other things
toward the straightning of the place, and it was not consonant to reason, or
agreeable to the law of War and honor, that another, now that the work was
almost brought to perfection, should have the glory of their dangers,
sufferings, and labors; This clash 'twixt the Archbishop, and the Duke de la
Valette, to whom Conde adhaer'd proved to be the ruin of this great
Expedition; for while they were debating the business after the breach was
made for a general assault, the Spaniards came tumbling down the Hills and
appeard to be more numerous far then they really were, so after a great
slaughter on both sides, but more of the French whereof diverse were thrust into
the Sea, the siege was raised; and one may say, The Town was lost, for not
offering to take it; if they had presently poursued the breach. Amongst diverse
errors which were committed in this action, besides the weakness of their
entrenchments, two were the quitting of Passage, without which the enemies
would not have bin able to draw provision for their subsistence from Saint
Sebastian; then the not erecting of a work upon the mountain of Gadaloupe which
was near the Town, and whence the Spaniard descended first; The French Army
retyring to the frontiers staid some days at Iroon, expecting the enemy should
poursue them, which he did not; whereby they inferred that he was not so strong
as they took him to be, and so he was willing to make them a bridge of sylver;
thus this Invasion came to nothing, which made the Spaniard geer them
afterward, saying, They had in this attempt discovered the true nature of the
French, viz. to enter like thunder, and vanish like smoke. De la Valette being
come to Bourdeaux to the old Duke his Father, after he had received relation
how matters had gone, and what traverses there passed 'twixt him, and Conde and
the Archbishop, advised him to get away as soon as he could to England, which
he did; and 'twas time for him, for afterward his Process was framed in Paris,
and he was executed in Effigy; so by this act of Justice the public
dishonor which seemed to reflect upon France in general, was restrained to
his person; Nor is it a new thing to sacrifice Commanders to such uses: Besides
the Duke of Espernon being now an hundred years of age and odd months, and
Anno 1637.
having continued above forty years Governor of Gascony was outed of his
Office, and commanded to retire to Plassac; where he died some months after,
but before his death he had these several disasters befell him within the
revolution of one year; his eldest son the Duke of Candale fell in Italy, the
Cardinal his brother died in Savoy, his third son was in banishment in
England, and he himself dismissed of all command, and deprived of this life.

The judgments of men were very discrepant touching the carriage of the
business of Fontarabia, the major part imputed the fault to the Prince of Conde
and the Archbishop who was a creature of the Cardinals; For the first, he was
content his son the Duke of Anguien should marry the Cardinals Niece a little
after, which was done, as some gave out, of purpose for preventing of being
questioned, and so clapped in the Bastile; For the second, there was always ill
blood 'twixt him and the Duke of Espernon; A Gentleman related unto me one
facetious passage that happened 'twixt them: The Archbishop was to go upon an
Expedition to Sea, and the Duke giving him a visit at Bourdeaux, the Archbishop
sent two Gentlemen to attend him, and to desire him to entertain himself a
little, for he was dispatching some Commanders and Officers that were to go
instantly to Sea; The Duke (for a little pot is soon heated) took this in
disdain (as he had reason being Governor in chief of the Country) and went
suddenly away to his House Cadillac five leagues above Bourdeaux; The next
morning the Archbishop went to pay him his visit, and the Duke being told he
was there, he sent two of his Gentlemen to desire his Reverence to have
patience a while, in regard he was newly entered into a Chapter of Saint
Augustines De Civitate Dei, and he would wait upon him as soon as he had done.

The King besides this under Conde, had diverse other Armies abroad about this
time. One in Picardy under Chastillon, who passed the Some and entering Arthois,
took all the Advenues toward Saint Omer, (old Hesdin having bin pillaged and
burnt before) and at last sat before the place; two thousand soldiers, and
nine hundred peasans were perpetually at work for a circumvallation; Marshall
de la Force came with a considerable Army to join with Chastillon; but a little
before Prince Tomaso had defeated two French Regiments, and Piccolomini came
afterward to second him; so there were very hot services performed on both
sides, at last the Spaniards having relieved the Town by taking the Fort of
Bac, by which advantage they might cast in what strength they would, the French
forsook their works, and so raised a costly siege; and marched toward Renti
which they took not without sweat and blood, and after that Carelet, the one
was quite demolished, the other better fortified.

The Duke of Longueville was now for the King in the Franche Conte, where there
happened diverse encounters 'twixt the Duke of Lorain and him, and many places
taken and succored by both parties.

To these land Exploits we will add a sea combat which was fought Anno 1638.
before Gattary this year 'twixt the Spanish Galeons, and the French Fleet
commanded by the Archbishop of Bourdeaux, where diverse of the Spanish Galeons
were taken, as also another fight 'twixt the Galleys of Marseilles, and those
of Spain near Genoa, in both which Neptun threw his trident in favor of France.

Prince Casimir the King of Polands brother passing to Spain to be Viceroy of
Portugal, was stopped about Marseilles, and made prisoner; because he went
disguised, as also because he had raised troops of Crabats for the service of
the king of Spain. There came also to Paris, Zaga Christos the youngest son of
Jacob Emperor of Aethiopia or the Hahissins, whose hard fate after a long
civil War was to be killed in the Plains of Guera, by one Susneos a Rebel,
who rendered himself afterward Emperor. Jacobs three sons were forced to fly,
and this being the youngest after many hazardous wanderings, and accidents
arrived at last in Italy, and thence he came to Paris where he was entertained
in the quality of a Prince.

France was at a high cumble of felicity at this time, and to augment it the
more, the Queen was brought to bed of a Prince who made the seventeenth Dauphin
of France since the first, she had a speedy delivery at Saint Germain de lay
the fifth of September, the same month his father was born, whither diverse
relics had been brought her, amongst others our Ladies girdle of Puy, which
she wore during her throngs. The King was at dinner when news was brought him,
and so he went suddenly to the Queens chamber where amongst the Ladies he found
Monsieur his brother, and he had good reason to be there to see what was
brought into the world.

This was one of the rarest passages, of this kind, that ever happened in
France, or any other part of the world, it being little less then a miracle,
that a young King and Queen should bed so long together and not have any issue
till the twenty third year of their cohabitation and concumbence, for so long
was this Dauphin a getting.

One may easily imagine what triumphings and public acclamations of joy were
up and down France for this so long expected Royal Offspring; nor was this
gladness bounded there but it dispersed it self up and down all places of
Christendom (that were friends to France) and struck a kind of wonderment into
the world. In Rome there were diverse inventions, and curiosities found out to
express a congratulation. -- Before the French Ambassadors Palace (who was
then the Marshall De Estree) there was a triumphant Obelisck with the arms of
France and this ostentous Inscription underneath.

For public arguments of joy Prisoners, and Gallislaves were released, two
were ennobled in every Generalty throughout the Kingdom, besides, four Masters
were created in every Trade throughout France, with diverse other privileges
afforded them of Paris.

This year 1638. was fruitful for Royal Princess els-where, for, besides the
French Dauphin, the King of Spain had a daughter, and the Emperor had a son
borne within the compass of it: The siege before Brisac, whereof we spoke
before, grew more and more stubburn, in so much that the Town began now to
think of making her last Will and Testament, and so bequeathed her self into
the hands of Bernard Weymar, who besides Dutch, English, Sweds, and Scotch had
an Army of 10000. French under his command; The said Weymar pretended a
propriety to the place, otherwise after so obstinat an opposition, and
slaughter of his men he had given no quarter; There were 135. Pieces taken in
the Town and Castle, with very much Treasure; After she was taken there happend
an ilfavor'd travers twixt the Duke and the King, who would have put a French
Governor into the Town; it went so far that the French Army made toward the
Duke and his Germans with others who discharged upon them, and diverse were
killed on both sides; but the French fury was appeased, and matters were
suddenly atoned; so a mixed Garrison was put into the Town, and Duke Bernard
placed the Governor; This was one of the straightest sieges that happened since
the German war, for people were reduced to that extremity that they began to
feed upon nefandous meats; Duke Bernard Weymar made it his best retreat, and
chiefest Randevow afterward, but he enjoyed it not long, for a few months
after he fell sick of the Purples (some say the Plague) and so left the society
of mortals; so that now the French have the Anno 1639.
chief sway, a mighty advantage, for the situation of this Town is such that
France may say she has now a key to enter Germany that way at pleasure, as she
has Pignerol for Italy. Duke Weymar being dead the Imperialists made this
Epitaph upon him.

Here lies He who preferred French before Germans, War before Peace, a King
before an Emperor, and Strangers before his own Countrymen. This year France
had also diverse irons in the fire which she did so beat that the sparkles flew
a great way abroad and did much mischief: Hesdin was closely besieged, so that
when the Infant Cardinal came to relieve her she was passed cure; The King
himself advanced as far as Abbeville in Person, and thence to his Army before
Hesdin, which struck a greater terror into the Town, and made her come sooner
to a Composition, which she obtaind upon Honorable terms; the King himself
entered, and having secured all things he returned to Paris in triumph. Yet he
had some water thrown into his wine before Theonville in Luxemburg, from before
which, his Army was beaten by Piccolomini and Bec, with a great slaughter.

The glass of the Ligue with the Swed being now almost run out, it was thought
fit to turn it and make it last four years longer 'twixt France and Him with
other German Confederats, which was negotiated at Colmar, where the French
Ambassador thrust in a new Epithet into the Treaty to aggrandize his Master,
viz. Praepotens. Whereupon Bernard Weymer being dead the Duke of Longueville
was made General of all the French forces in Germany.

There was a loud tumult happend in Low Normandy this year amongst the
Populasse, for new impositions that were daily thrust upon them; the
Insurrection crept up to High Normandy, and to Roven her self, nor did the
Parliament which is there always sedentary much labor to suppress it; but
diverse Gentlemen and persons of the best rank did seem to countenance it; In
so much that Colonel Gassion was forced to come from Picardy with a
considerable Army of horse and foot for the suppression thereof; so he enterd
the Province, where his soldiers did much mischief upon the people, and coming
to Roven the gates flew open to him without resistance; so the King sent
thither his Chancellor, who caused all the Citizens to be disarmed, the
chiefest instruments of the Mutiny to be imprisoned, their Process formed,
whereby many of them were executed, amongst others, the ringleader of the
populas who was a man of mean condition who alleged himself to be mad, but
that subterfuge would not serve his turn; besides, he annulled the Parliament
and amerc'd the Town in one hundred thousand Franks, which was paid
accordingly; and the Gentry that had a hand in this popular Insurrection paid
fifty thousand Franks more: but a little after, the Court of Parliament was
reestablish'd upon the extraordinary humble submissions of the Town, Anno 1639.
the like punishment was inflicted upon Caen, so this dangerous follevation was
quashed by a high hand of Royal power, which this City had felt some 3. years
before; for the King having thought to borrow 400000. crowns of her, she
excused her self, thereupon the King sent a band of soldiers which for eight
days together, kept there upon the Towns charge, and so the money was made up.
And so I put a period to the sixth Luster.

which is five years; nay, it has scarce fifty Moons, which some held (though
erroneously) to be enough, whereof to compose a Luster: the reason is, that
that great Monark whose reign we thus divide, was cut off from amongst mortals,
which will enforce us accordingly to cut off the thread of our story.

In Brisac and other parts of Alsatia there were some incongruities, and clouds
of diffidence hung between the Germans and the French; The young Prince
Palatine was going thither through France disguised, hoping to have better
fortune that way, then he had in Westphalia not long before where Prince Robert
his brother was taken prisoner and carried to Vienna, with the Lord Craven; He
was furnished from England with credit for considerable sums of money at
Basile, but being advanced a good way beyond Paris in his journey, he was
discovered, restrained a while at Moulins, and then sent for to Paris, whence
he was committed to Bois de Viniennes. The French feared that he might puzzle
their proceedings in Brisac, and that being a German Prince and supported by
his Majesty of Great Britain the Town would choose him for Governor: upon these
apprehensions he was a while kept prisoner; but afterward, by the intercession
of the Queen of England chiefly (as his brother was released by good offices
the Empress did who to this day does much respect the English Nation) he was
freed and received very Princely entertainment afterward; At his departure the
King gave him a very obliging farewell, by telling him, That whereas it pleased
God and Nature to place him to be Umpire of this part of the World, he would
not suffer him to be oppressed by any, but he would endeavor, to reinvest him
at last in his own Territories, assuring him that no peace should be concluded
'twixt him and the House of Austria, unless he were included.

Fortune had frowned now a good while upon Spain, but this year, she bended her
brows, and wrinkled her forhead more ruggedly then Anno 1640.
ever; A fearful combustion happened 'twixt the Pyreney Hills in the Kingdom
of Catalonia (of old but a County), this combustion was a kind of a bonefire to
France, who presently ran to warm her hands and sport about it, and she has
ministered fuel to keep it in ever since; It grew so furious that the Viceroy
with his wife, and some of his family were murtherd, and his house burnt to the
ground by the violence of a popular fury. The ground of this fearful
Insurrection was the billeting of the Castillian soldiers, and their
insolences, as they marched through the Country; besides some extraordinary
contributions which were demanded of that Province for the support of the King
now in his extreme necessities having so many professed mighty enemies both by
sea and land: this Tumult by degrees turned to an absolut revolt and defection
from their Soverain natural King; In so much that they flew to France and
cried out for the Duke of Anjou; the French quickly hearkens unto them, so
there was a Treaty at Narbona, whither they sent twelve persons of quality for
hostages, and an Order issued out that he should be branded with a hot iron who
spoke of any accommodation with Castile; It was agreed upon, that upon putting
themselfs under the Royal protection of the most Christian King, he should
furnish them with an Army of six thousand foot, and two thousand horse, to be
maintained by the Catalans: Whereupon three Commissioners were sent to Paris,
one for the Clergy, another for the Nobility, and a third for the Gentry and
Cominalty. They who were most busy herein, and indeed the chiefest bellows
that blew this terrible fire were the Preaching Friars and Monks, who in lieu
of obedience and conformity to Government, and compliance with the necessities
of the King having so many irons in the fire, did teach and obtrude to the
people nothing more then common privilege, and resumption of liberty, whereby
the affection of the vassal was embittered, and at last quite poisoned against
his Prince; whence this Aphorism may be collected, That the best Instruments
misapplied do greatest mischief, and prove most dangerous to any State; And as
of the sweetest wines is made the sharpest Vinegar, so Churchmen, who by their
holy function and white robes of innocence should be the sweetest of all
professions, who should breath nothing, but peace, unity, allegiance and love,
if they misapply their talent, and abandon themselfs to the spirit of faction,
they become the bitterest enemies, the most corroding cankers, and worst vipers
in any Commonwealth, and most pernicious to the Prince; In regard that they
having the sway ore the conscience which is the Rudder that steers the actions,
words and thoughts of the rational creature, they transport and snatch it away
whither they will; making the Beast with many heads conceive according to the
color of those rods they use to cast before them.

The French having thus undertaken the protection of the revolted Catalan, and
cut the Spaniard work enough that way, he did miracles against him about this
time in the Netherlands, for he made the Rat to eat the Cat, and a Cow to spin
out a bundle of Flax, by rendering himself Master of Arras, the chiefest Town of
the Province of Artois after a strong stubborn siege; which place the Flemins
held to be inpregnable and as impossible to take, as it was for the Rat and the
Cow to do what was above said.

His General also in Italy the Count of Harcour, did do strange exploits, who
having entered Piemont was besieged by the Spaniard in Chieri, but he got
through, routs the enemy, and succors Casal: This he did with 1500. horse, and
a few foot, who were nothing equal in number to the Spaniards who were thrice
as many: This ventrous achievement, which some interpreted rashness rather then
true valor, got him a mighty reputation; Then he marches to Turin, and
besieges it, but the gates were opened to him within a short time, so he made
a glorious entrance into the Town, and returns triumphantly ore the Hills to
France, having settled the King his Master in the protection of the Infant Duke
of Savoy his Nephew, which protection or tutele, the Emperor, seconded by the
Spaniard, alleged did belong to him by Imperial right during his minority.

There came a Messenger of State to Paris who brought notice of the Great Turks
death, in the flower of his youth though of a robust huge constitution; He died
by excess of drinking some sorts of wine, wherewith he was used to be often
distempered, notwithstanding the strict law of Mahomet, who used to preach this
Doctrine, That there was a Devil in every berry of the grape, and therefore
absolutely interdicted the use of wine in his Alchoran: But such is the power of
sensual appetit in man, that the spirit oftentimes is too weak to resist the
motion of sense, though the conscience should dictat, that Hell it self stands
gaping for him in the very fruition of the pleasure.

The genius of this great Potentat is very remarkable for when he came first to
sit upon the throne of that mighty Empire, he was of a mild, gentle, and
peaceful nature, but the Janissaries (who may in time prove the bane of that
Tyranicall Monarchy) having violently cut off many of his great Officers, and
committed other acts of high insolences whereat he had connived, and looked on
as a sufferer a great while; at last patience so often abused, and stretched as
it were upon the Tenter, turned to fury in him, and that in so high a degree
that it came to alter and quite change his disposition, and the very instinct
of nature in him, for of a soft, easy and candid humor, he became afterward,
having bin so often provoked by such bloody spectacles, as cruel and
sanguinary, as any that ever swayed the Ottoman Empire: And he ordered matters
so, that he found an opportunity to be revenged of all those that had affronted
him before, and bereft him of his Favorites and Officers; He commonly carried
with him (a Ghelad) an Executioner, who at his sudden beck, and in his sight
took off many heads to offer up as Victimes for the life's of his slain
servants; He grew to be so fleshed in blood, that he was scarce capable of any
compassion, or appre hension of fear, notwithstanding that his predecessor had
been hacked to pieces not long before by one of his Anno 1641.
meanest soldiers, for attempting to remove his Court from Constantinople
the other side the Hellespont to Damasco, to be revenged of his cowardly
Janissaries, who would not fight the year before against the Pole; as also of
the Constantinopolitans for refusing to furnish him with moneys for that war;
Hence may be drawn this Caution; That Princes natures are ticklish things to be
tampered withal, that it is dangerous to trench too far upon the softness of
their dispositions, as appears in this Monark, who by often irritations fell
from one extreme to another.

The horrid flames (we spoke of before) which were kindled amongst those fiery
Mountains (the Pyreneys) in Catalonia, (the chiefest part of Hispania
Tarraconensis, according to the old division) did rage with such fury, that the
sparkles of them by a strong East Wind were carried into Portugal, of old (
Hispania Lusitanica:) And as one torch lights another, or any other thing whose
matter is combustible and apt to take, so this other Revolt was kindled by the
first; and Portugal was very well prepared to receive it, as well for the
aversnes, and strong disaffection her Inhabitants have to the Castillan; (for I
have heard them complain often that the greatest misery which could befall
them, was, to lose their King Don Sebastian, and to fall under the yoke of the
Castillan) as also for diverse other causes; First, she complained that the King
neglected to protect her against the Hollander in Brasil where he had taken
Fernanbuck her chief staple of Sugars; she urged also enhancement of toll, new
exactions, and other pressures; lastly, she complained of strangers to be her
Viceroys, as Casimir the King of Polands brother was intended for her, had he
not bin intercepted in France; In so much that it was easy for Spain to have
bin a Prophetess of this defection; therefore her wonted policy and foresight
was much questioned, that she did not put out of the way, and engage in some
foreign employment the Duke of Bragansa who was used to be perpetually almost at
Madrid. When the King of Spain told Olivares of this revolt, and that there was
a new King proclaimed, the Favorit slighted it, saying, Es Rey de havas, Sir,
he is but a bean or twelfnight King; but we find now he was far out of his
account. Never was there a general Revolt perfected in so short a compass of
time, for within less then a month Don John of Bragansa was so settled in the
Kingdoms of Portugal, and the Algarves, without any opposition at all or
mark of strangenes, as if he had bin King thereof twenty years together before.

The King of Spain writ a Letter to Bragansa (now King) to this effect.

Duke my Cosen; some odd news are brought me which I esteem folly, considering
the proof I have had of the fidelity of your House; Give me advertisement
accordingly, because I ought to expect it from you; Do not draw a trouble upon
your self, and hazard not the esteem I make of your life to the fury of a
mutinous rabble: but let your wisdom comport you so, that your person may
escape the danger; My counsel will advise you further: So God Anno 1640.
keep you.

Your Cosen and King.


To which Letter this answer was returned.

My Cosen, my Kingdom desiring its natural King, and my subjects being
oppressed with gabells, and new impositions, have executed without
contradiction that which they had often times attempted, by giving me the
possession of a Kingdom which appertains unto me: Wherefore if any will go
about to take it from me, I will seek justice in my arms, defense being
permitted. God preserve your Majesty.

Don John the Fourth, King of Portugal.


This put the King of Spain at such a stand, having on both sides of him two
sorts of subjects not only risen up, but quite cut off from him, that, as the
Proverb runs in that Country, he could not tell what wood to make his shafts
of, nor could Olivares (which was held such a Santon) know what Bead to pray
upon, or what Saint to address himself unto. And certainly these were two
mighty shocks to the Spanish Monarchy, nor could they happen in a time more
disadvantagious, she having so many engagements abroad, and having met with
such ilfavor'd rancounters by Land and Sea of late years. It is also
considerable that this check at home befell her after wellneer an Age of a
profound unshaken peace, and desuetude of arms in Spain her self where civil
war has bin so great a stranger, notwithstanding that she still bred soldiers
abroad, and found means to embroyle the world always in some place or other:
Which makes some interpret this intestine war to be a visible judgment fallen
upon her from heaven for disturbing the peace of her neighbors. But I have
observed it to be the genius of a true Spaniard (and I honor him for it) not
to bow and hang down his head like a bulrush at every puff of adverse Fortune,
nor to yield to the fury of the tempest, but to rouse up his spirits more
stiffly to resist -- Et contra audentior ire.

In this double trance the King was advised to apply his strength first to
suppress the Catalan (the sturdy Montaneer) and till that work were finished,
to stand only upon the defensive part against Portugal who is not esteemed so
much a man.

Besides these disasters that befell the K. of Spain thus at his own doors, he
had another happened unto him in the Netherlands, for his Brother Don Fernando
the Cardinal Infant died in the beginning of his manhood at Brussells, being
of about the same age as his second Brother Don Carlos was of, (about 30.) who
died some years before: the world did take occasion to wonder that these two
Princes in the flower, and prime vigor of their age should thus fall. Don
Carlos the year before he died, desired of his brother to be Viceroy of
Portugal, which was denied him; Moreover it was observed he drew more
affection from the Spaniards in general by the color of his complexion,
because Anno 1641.
he was black; for one shall hear the people of Castillia sigh up and down and
pray, that God would please to send them a King once again of their own color:
Moreover, besides this popular affection he was extremely well beloved of the
soldiers, for whom he was always ready to do good offices, and they addressed
themselves more to him then to any. These circumstances made odd impressions in
the minds of many which gave occasion of censuring and scattering of libells up
and down touching his death, whereof I thought it not impertinent to insert one
here, but not to impose a belief upon the Reader thereby; It was dropped down in
the Court at Brussels.

Fernando, Carlos murio,
Y dizen fue su Homicida,
Quien a vos os desterro;
Lo que os aconsejo yo
Es, que a Bethlem no bolvais
Hasta que muera Herodes,
Que la muerte os espera
En la sombra que pisais.
Thus unspanioliz'd and rendered into English.

Charles died, Fernando, and they say,
He, who Thee banished, did him slay;
If to my Counsel thou give ear,
Again to Bethlem go not near
Till Herod's gone; for death does watch
In thine own shadow Thee to catch.
This Revolt of Portugal was no great news to the French Cardinal, who had his
spirits walking there, as well as in Barcelona, and every where else; He had
this Spring wrought the Duke of Lorain to come to Paris, where he arrived in
indifferent good equippage considering how many bitter showers had fallen, and
weatherbeaten him before; for he had armed five times upon several desseins,
and Fortune always frowned upon him; Which some hold to be a visible judgment
fallen upon him, as also that he is a kind of exile from his own ancient
Princely inheritance, for abandoning his first wife, (by whose right he came to
the full and unquestionable possession of Lorain) and cohabiting with another:
The King entertaines him with a magnificence suitable to his quality, and the
Cardinal is as busy as a Be to give him all outward content; The one sends
him fifty thousand Pistols, the other twenty thousand in a great basin. When he
came before the King he complemented for matters passed, and kneeling twice the
King takes him up telling him, That he had forgotten all matters passed, and
for the future he would espouse his quarrels and interests and make them his
own: And so it seems he has done, for he has so Anno 1642.
wedded himself to the best Towns of Lorain, and Barri, that it is thought he
will hardly be ever divorced from any of them, unless he be forced.

The City of Paris was now full of Catalans, and Portugals, who strowted up
and down the streets, their new King having sent two Ambassadors thither in
joint Commission; In the interim the Spanish Ambassadors at Rome negotiat
strongly that the Duke of Bragansa be excommunicated for an Usurper; if this
had taken effect, it had made the King of France incapable to assist him being
an excommunicated person: but France had such a powerful faction in the
Consistory, and the Pope himself was such a friend to her that the Catholic
King could do little good in this point.

There had some former counterbuffs passed betwixt the Cardinal and the Count
of Soissons, who had slighted one of his Neeces for marriage; but now there was
a new clash happened between them in the Armies, in Picardy, where the Cardinal
would have advanced his colors before the Count of Soissons; The King abetted
his Cardinal, hereupon the Count retires in coffeehouse to Sedan, and got
the Duke of Bovillon to ligue with him; They raised a considerable Army, and
encountered the Kings forces which they routed, but the Count being too eager,
and poursuing a broken Troop of horse which was flying, it was his hard fate
to be killed by one of the Cardinals servants who then bore Arms; The fall of
this Prince of the Blood in the prime vigor of his virility, causd much
lamentation in France mixed with some murmurings against the Cardinal; And it
was a good turn for him, in regard now that Soissons was taken away there was
no Prince throughout all France able to uphold a faction against him.

France was blessed with another masculine Royal offspring the Duke of Anjou,
which did not raise so much wonder as the Dauphin, for he, as I told you
before, was two and twenty years a getting, this but a twelvemoneth and a few
days.

Marie de Medici Queen Mother and Dowager of France expired this year, who may
be said to be one of the greatest Queens that ever were, being grandchild, and
gran niece to two glorious Emperors, Ferdinand, and Charles the Fifth, wife of
Henry the Great, Mother to the three mighty Kings of France, Great Britain, and
Spain, and to the ancientest Prince of Christendom, the Duke of Savoy; She had
bin Regent of France many years, during which time she discovered extraordinary
abilities transcending her sex; shewas afterward twice in Arms against her
son, and she came at last to conceive such a Iunonian indignation against the
Cardinal de Richelieu who had bin chief of her Counsels, and her creature
afterward in point of greatness, for she first preferred him to the King,
that the breach could never be made up between them; that one might say,

Nec quenquam jam far potest Regina priorem, Anno 1642.
Richeliusve parem. She was used to say, That the worst thing she ever did was
the advancement of Richelieu; In the sense of this high indignation she forsook
France, and drew a voluntary exile upon her self, whereby she was so tossed up
and down to several Countries that she became a Tenisball to the blind
inconstant Goddess; she first retired to Flanders where she found good respect
and contentment, during the life of the Archduchesse; but then being distasted
with the Spanish Ministers, she removed to Holland, thence to England, where
she found most Royal allowance and Hospitality, and her last retirement was to
Colen where she lived reclus'd, exercising her self in strict exercises of
devotion (in her way,) and so breathed her last. Such was her fate, I will not
say her faut, that Bellona followed her wheresoever she went, (as also her
three daughters) yet in her own nature she detested war, specially that with
Spain, and that with Savoy: And this was thought to be the ground of her
animosity against the Cardinal.

The King of France having thoroughly undertaken the protection of the
Catalans, sent a royal army, composed most of Gascons, and of them of the
Religion, which rushed into the County of Roussillon the Key of Spain toward
that part of the Pyreneys; This County was once an appendix of France, but
being hypothequ'd and morgag'd to the King of Aragon for a sum of money it
was never redeemed since. France had better fortune in this second Invasion of
Spain, then she in the first at Fontarabia; Perpignan the strongest Fort of
Christendom, for the bigness, was besieged, and the King himself made his
approach thither in person, so after a tough stubborn siege, by famine rather
then force, the Town and Castle yielded, wherein there were above 120. great
Canons.

The Spaniard had some requital though nothing adaequat to the loss of
Perpignan in the Netherlands about this time, for he regained the Town of Air
from the French: and the French took Bipalma toward Cambray from the Spaniard.

The Cardinal of Richelieu was sick that time the Queen Mother died at Colen,
yet he strained himself to creep to the Altar, and officiated many Church
duties for her soul; From that time he was never perfectly recovered, so about
the latter end of this year he died himself in his Cardinal Palace at Paris. He
was so attenuated and dried up with exces of care, and encombrances of the
brain, that his body might be said to be but a sackfull of bones, and a mere
Scheleton.

This gran Minister being thus gone, Cardinal Mazarin, a Gentleman of an
ancient Roman extraction, was put to sit at the helm; A man of the same habit,
and ability; as if the soul of Richelieu had transmigrated into him; He was a
bosom friend, and a great intrinsic Confident of Richelieu before, who had
imparted his desseins, and infused all his maxims into him, and opened unto
him all the Arcana Anno 1643.
Imperii: He had bin an active political instrument employed by the Pope
before, in sundry Treaties, and difficult traverses of State, wherein he had
good success, and in all his negotiations he was discovered to be a person of
excellent address, and rare endowments.

The King did not long survive his Cardinal of Richelieu, for he fell mortally
ill five months after, at which time this great Monarch paid nature her last
debt; and what earthly Potentate is there, though never so independent and
absolute, that is exempt from this tribute?

He expired the 14th. of May in the afternoon, the same month, the same day of
the month, and about the same hour of the day that his father died 33. years
before, but with this mark of difference, that the one went, and the other was
sent out of the world about the same time. His bowels were presently carried to
be interred at Saint Denis, the last rendevous of all the French Kings, whither
his Body followed after in the height of all Solemnity and Magnificence that
his Queen could possibly devise, whom he left Regent; a Lady of rare temper and
prudence, who to the wonder of all the world, had the comfort of two sons after
two and twenty years expectation; And to that benediction has another now
added, to have not only the sole government of them, but the supreme sway of
that huge Monarchy, which She is like to continue about nine years longer: A
just recompense from heaven for her so long patience, as also for her wise
comportment and moderation in refraining utterly to intermeddle with any the
least matters of State, while She remained under covert Baron.

Touching other circumstances of this Kings death, with his constitution of
body and disposition of mind, you shall find it in the ensuing Corollary or
Character.

Thus ends the Life and Reign of Lewis the thirteenth.
A COROLLARY ADDED TO THE LIFE of LEWIS the Thirteenth.
ANd thus have we attended this Great King from the Womb to the Tomb, from the
Funt to his Funeral, from Fountainbleau to Saint Denis; Our story has waited
on him in his childhood, in his nonage, and so ascended from his majority to
his Meridian, not leaving him, tills he had closed his eyes at Saint Germans,
which was a good while too soon, considering the ordinary longitude of time
that is allowed man to live amongst the Elements; for he reached not unto forty
three years complete which in some constitutions is accounted but the noontyde
of virility; In so much that when I consider the frame of his body and the
actions of his life, I find that he had more obligations to Fortune then to
Nature; yet was he of a comely middlesiz'd proportion, of a spare but clear
making, and though not strenuous or robust, yet active enough, and patient of
toil; for he would be most commonly in the head of some of his Armies himself,
and take very much pains to drill and discipline his Troops in his own Person,
and sit twelve hours together on horseback; He was of a soft complexion though
black hair'd, which turned gray before he came to thirty years, which put him
to his die, and the reason that Nature did thus outrun Time in him, was, that
she had not given him a competence of radical moisture, for seldom came any
humidities from him from mouth or nostrill, nor was he subject to sweat, though
he would agitat his body often in tough exercises, as hunting the wild Bore,
and other sports wherein he would be earnest. Diverse eminent virtues did
cohabit in him, as piety, (in his way) chastity, temperance, and constancy;
Touching the first two they shined in him with such a strength and luster, that
his example might have had power enough to give law to all mankind, and cast
the world into a new mould, had it bin capable of reformation; He was pious in
an intense degree, for though he was not known to be subject to any Vice, yet
would he be on his knees to his ghostly father every week, rather to refresh
(as one said) then to cleanse his conscience by confession; nor in his prayers
had he as much cause to ask for pardon as for perseverance; defects he had, but
scarce any faults; those rays which enlightened his brain from above, descended
to his breast and became fire, so fervent he used to be in his way of devotion;
when but a youth he went to the Country of Bearn, at his entrance to Pau, the
Inhabitants bringing a Canopy to carry over his head, he asked whether there
was ever a Church in Town, and being answered no, he said, He would receive no
honor in that place where God Almighty had no House to be honored in. And into
all other Towns where he entered as Conqueror, he would give express command
that none should cry out Vive le Roy during the time of Procession.

When the Queen (now Regent) found her self quick he caused a solemn
Declaration to be published, wherein he made the blessed Virgin Protectresse
under the Holy Trinity of all his estates, all which he consecrated to Her, and
for an immortal mark of this consecration, he commanded the great Altar in the
Cathedral Church of Paris to be built anew, with the Image of the Virgin which
should hold in her arms that of our Savior, and the King to ly prostrat
before the Son and Mother offering them his Crown and Scepter. The Archbishop of
Paris was enjoined to commemorat this Declaration once every year, upon
Assumption day at the high Altar in the Morning, and that in the Evening a
general Procession should be made wherein the Provost of Paris, and all the
soverain companies should be assistant with the Court of Parliament; this
command extended to all other Archbishops and Bishops throughout France, that
they should in every Cathedral Church erect one special Altar for the Virgin
Mary for this end, and in commemoration of this act to perpetuity.

Many other instances could be produced what a great Zelot he was in the
Religion and Ceremonies of Rome, but the adding of one more shall suffice,
which was, that when the old Marshall de la Force was admitted to see him a
little before he expired, he told him from his deathbed, That he thought God
Almighty suffered him (meaning the Marshall) to live so long upon earth
expecting his conversion, as he had done that of Lesdiguieres.

He put out sundry Proclamations against Swearers, against Pride in apparel,
for he himself went usually very plain; as also against Duells, and the last
was so strict that both the appellant and defendant whosoever did survive,
should suffer death without mercy, and be deprived of Christian burial, but
both rot upon the gallows with their heels upwards.

As he was thus pious (in a general way) so was he toward his parents in
particular; For when he had passed nonage, he said, I am now a major to all
the world except my mother, to whom I shall be still a minor. When he had given
Vitry order to feiz upon the Marshall of Ancre, yet he gave him a private
instruction not to touch him in his mothers lodgings. She was twice in actual
arms against him, yet, though he routed and broak her partisans, and might
have crushed them all to pieces, he pardoned them all at her request; his
brother started out often against him, yet such was his indulgence, that he
always forgave him, and received him again into his bosom; But when the
Cardinal came to sit at the stern, he had such strong influxes upon him, that
he postpos'd both fraternall love, and maternall duty, to his affection toward
him, or rather toward his kingdom as he termed it; Insomuch that amongst other
short memorandums he sent her word, that it concernd him more to conserve
France, then to content Her (viz. his mother.)

Touching his continence and chastity he was a great example, for he was not
subject no not as much as in thought, much less in action to the contraries of
these, according to the relation of some of his nearest servants; nor did this
proceed from impotence, as some would make the world believe, but out of virtue
and conscience, for he was said to hate the very names of such vices more then
others do the vices themselfs. Whereupon it was said, while his Southern
brother in law sported in the pavilions of Venus, he was busie*in the tents of
Mars, and took Cities faster, then the other did Maydenheads.

He was also temperat in a high degree, nor would he ever wrong nature with the
least exces, or debauchments. Moreover he was wonderfully constant in his
affection, where it was once settled; which is rare in Soverain Princes,
(especially in them of that Clime) who have such a variety of choice, and who
have no other ground of fastness for their affection, but their own fancy: Not
all the world could alienat his favor from Luynes, though the greatest Princes
of France did actually attempt to pluck him away from him by Arms; nor after
him from the Cardinal, toward whom his love was in grain, and would never lose
color. Nor was he constant only in his affection, but to his own ends when
once settled, and resolved upon; to attain which he was so actif and hot, that
when he went about it, he not only applied, but gave up himself entirely to
the thing. Furthermore he was marvellously modest in an opinion of himself, and
so conscious of his own judgment, that he resigned his very faculty of reason,
and transmitted all his intellectualls to others; a high point of prudence, for
that Prince who steers his course by the Compass of Counsel, though he be
himself but of indifferent abilities, is a far wiser man, then he who, albeit
never so politic and able of himself, does guide his affairs by his own fancy,
sole opinion being the worst kind of rule in Government. And he was as fortunat
as judicious in the choice of his Counselors, and chiefest ministers both of
State and War; He would not send an Ajax, where he should employ an Ulysses;
nor a Saintre, where Bouciqualt was fitter for the turn; The two last were the
most famous men that France ever bred, one for the Gown, the other for the
Sword, according to the verse I have read in an old Manuscript.

Beaucoup plus vaut pour un assault,
Saintre, que ne fait Bouciquault;
Beaucoup mieux vaut en un Traicte
Bouciquault, que ne fait Saintre.
Thus unfrench'd, and made English.

Were I to choose for an assault
I Would have Saintre, not Bouciquault,
Were I to treat, then should for me
Stand Bouciquault, and not Saintre.
So many high signal virtues which were naturally inhaerent in him were
unquestionably the cause that he prosper'd so much; So that it is a question
whom Fortune loved better, the Father or the Son; It Is true his Father fought
four great Battails wherein he proved victorious, and so may be said to have
come to the Crown of France by Conquest, as much as by Succession, yet all
these and other exploits of Henry the Great's were within the bounds of France,
and naught else but domestic achievments; But France was too narrow a compass, to
comprehend and confine the exploits of the Thirteenth Lewis, for besides
thirteen several Civil Wars* in France her self and Navar which he suppressed,
and most of them in Person; so many Battles were fought in Spain, Italy,
Savoy, amongst the Grisons, in Lorain, and in high and low Germany; He had at
one time in the years sixteen hundred thirty five, and thirty six, no less
then 130000. foot by Land and Sea, and 8000. effectif horse, in six several
Armies; whereas Henry the Great never had above 40000. horse and foot at once
in all; never any made France know her own strength so much, and to find the
length of her weapon, as this King did; He went a horseback betimes, for at
thirteen years of age he suppressed in Person two Rebellions, one in Poitou,
and another in Britany* so that he began to triumph in those years that others
begin to handle their arms, and learn how to sit a horse in an Academy.

Afterward he was forced to get his Queen by the sword, and to bring her into
his arms by Arms, there being three several Armies to stop her passage.

He then repells the English who had so boldly invaded France, whereby he
gained a greater addition of credit and fame, then he did by worsting Spaniard,
Italian, or German, in regard of the admirable Victories that the English
carried home from France in times passed, by taking one of their warlik'st
Kings prisoner, and oftentimes by discomfiting whole Troops with a handful of
men.

After this he beleaguers, takes and batters the chiefest rampart of the
Religion, the impregnable Town of Rochell after a stupendous siege by Land and
Sea, where a prodigious Dike was cast up which served as a bit in Neptunes
jaws, and whereby he may be said to have curbed all the Elements.

No sooner had he shaken off the dust of Rochell, but behold him covered with
snow on the horrid Alpian Hills almost in the dead of Winter, where he broke
open his way with the point of the sword to relieve the Duke of Mantova, he got
Forts accessibly only by birds amongst those clowd-topping Hills, and so
returns triumphant having done the work, and overcome the rocks in this
expedition, as he did the Sea at Rochell.

He then goes on to perfect that mighty work of reducing his subjects of the
Religion to an exact condition of obedience, by dismantling their Towns,
whereof they had near upon three hundred in France and Navar, by casheering
their Garrisons, and bringing them to rely for the future upon royal favor; a
work which his five immediate Predecessors attempted to do, but could not effect
in seventy years, whereas he did it in far less then so many months.

Then behold him Lord of all Lorain, and of the greatest part of Alsatia, by
being Master of Brisach, Rhinfeld and other places: Then trace him to the
Netherlands, and you shall find him in the ancient Town of Arras, and diverse
other places his predecessor Francis the First had given for his ransom.

Lastly look after him toward the Pyrenean Mountains, and you shall see him
boldly invade Spain, entering the County of Roussillon like lightning, and
battering the vvalls of Perpignan, which after a tough siege, notwithstanding
she had above 120. great Cannons, and ten strong Bulvvarks, he reduced to his
will, whereby he has redeemed with lead (I mean good bullets) that Country
which one of his predecessors morgag'd for gold in times passed: Thus has he got
three such keys that none of his progenitors (not Emperors) ever had:
Perpignan, Pignerol, and Brisach, one to enter Spain, the other Italy, and the
third to rush into Germany at pleasure.

Look upon him in his City, Town, University, and Court at Paris, and you
shall find him enlarging her skirts and lacing them about with new vvalls,
according to the custom of Rome (once the great Mistress of the world) who
upon the increase of her Empire extended also her vvalls upon any new acquest.

Nor must you behold him only on Land, but cast your eyes upon him at Sea, and
you shall find him incomparably more potent then all his progenitors, the
French formerly waded like sheep, but now they may be said to swim like
Elephants; Before, France could hardly without borrowing, put twenty Sails of
men of War to Sea, but now she can rig a hundred well appointed fighting great
Vessels in Galleons and Galleys in both her Seas at a short warning.

But having done with the pro, let us see what may be said to the contra,
touching this Great King; It must be granted that Fortune did not always sit
at the helm of his proceedings.

At the Treaty of Lodun he was il-favor'dly baffled by his own subjects, who
gave him law, and set the dice upon him: but than you will say he was young, and
let it suffice for an excuse: Before Montaban he lost five hundred Gentlemen,
and five times as many soldiers, and then was forced to trusse up his baggage
and be gone, and to suffer this Motto upon the gate, Roysansfoy, ville sans
peur. In Italy he lost first and last an hundred thousand subjects. Before and
about Saint Omer ten thousand. At Fontarabia he had a foul repulse: At
Theonville he lost seven thousand French; before Hesain, there fell little
less; and the succouring of Scales proved a tart piece of service; The first
Army he sent to join with the States which came to thirty thousand horse and
foot got little credit at Tillemont, and less before Lovain, and diverse
thousands of them died without an enemy, and came home by weeping cross.

Touching his Appellation or Epithet of Just, there are diverse Critiques, and
some of his own subjects give out, that it does not so well quadrat with him;
They instance in the manner of Marshall D'Ancres death in the dawnings of his
reign: Moreover when he passed by Saumur, he sent for the keys of the Town and
Castle to Du Plessis promising upon the word of a King he would deliver them
him again, which was not done; only a Gentleman of the Religion was left
Governor of the Castle for the time: The Rochellers complained that he often
promised to raze Lewis Fort; The Duke of Savoy spoak high language, and charged
him with breach of Article that he was not sent for, and admitted to the Treaty
at Monson; The Duke of Lorain, more then any, charge him (nor has he reason
to be angry with him therefore, for losers must have leave to speak) that his
safe conducts before Nancy, and at other times turned to enforcements, his
Treaties to traps; The Emperor knows not how he fell out with him; And the
Spaniard swears by his mustachos, that he first infringed the Sacred bonds and
Capitulations of Peace so solemnly sworn betwixt them, and corroborated by a
double Nuptial knot: Nor says he, will the proceedings against the Archbishop
of Mentz serve to justify him, for he was a Rebel to the Emperor, before
France had undertaken his protection.

The Duke of Lorain charge him further that he would have dissolved and
nullified the marriage 'twixt Monsieur and his Sister, she being a better woman
then his first wife, who was daughter to a vassal of the Crown of France; and
being also of as good extraction as himself, having lineally descended from
Charlemayne, and in one respect of a better condition then his Brother was,
when he married her, she being a Virgin and he a Widower. Nay he taxes him of
impiety that he should offer to make the Eternal Law of God touching marriage
to be balked by a humane and temporary politic Constitution of France
alterable at men's pleasures, which is, that the Heir Apparent of the Crown
should not marry without Royal consent; and being married according to the
Rites of the Church, to make this latter law to be of more force then the
former.

Poor Germany complains that he has plunged her in an eternal war by
bringing in the Swed, and by fomenting him ever since within her bowels: The
Jesuits have also a saying to him, that his prime Confidents and Confederats
were opposite to the Roman Catholic Church, as the Hollander, the Hessian, the
Grison, the Swed, which cannot choose but be derogatory to the most Christian
King; The Spaniard says further that he upheld not only old but new Rebels
against him, as the Catalan and the Portugal, and that he need not glory much
of his doings against his Monarchy, for France of her self had bin able to have
done him little hurt, had she not ligu'd with, and employed his own revolted
Vassals, as the Hollander, and the other two mentioned a little before, against
him; And therefore what mischief and exploits France has performed against
him, was by conjunction with these his subjects, otherwise she had never bin
able to have trodden as much as upon his toe.

Lastly, the poor Pesans of France pitifully cry out that they are transformed
to mere Asses, that his wars were not only maintained with their persons, but
nourished with their blood, with their very vital spirits and livelihoods;
that for many years he made them to soften and steep their bread in tears,
which flowed in such plenty, that there were enough to quench all the Bonefiers
of triumph that have bin made since the beginning of his Reign; the smoakes
whereof were so thick that they hindered him to see their pitiful, meager
looks, and grinded faces; and the clashing of his arms so great, that he could
not hear their cries. They complain that they are now so habituated to new
impositio^s and inventions tending to slavery, that like Milo's beast, their
burden is grown up from a calf to an ox since these wars; Yea they cry out
that they are grown worse then Asses, they are become mere Dromedaries who not
only receive the burden, but kneel down to take it up.

To all these accusations something may be said in answer; For his faylings with
his subjects of the Religion, there are some that would clear him by
recrimination of them, for he never promised any thing categorically, but upon
condition that they should also perform diverse things, and the obligation of
the one depended upon the performance of the other, so there were faylings on
both sides.

Touching D'Ancre he had so involved and mingled his own particular interests
with those of the State, that an ordinary way could not separat them; He had
likewise so distasted all the Princes, that he was like to be pernicious and
destructive to his Kingdom, yet it was not his mind to have him suddenly
assassinated in that manner; though on the other side, Wallestein was made away
so by Imperial warrant, and the act justified.

Concerning the Duke of Lorain he alleged neglect of homage, (which was
unquestionably due unto him) and conjunction with his enemies, as also breach
of promise that Monsieur should not mary his sister, and the giving of shelter
to all Fugitives.

For the Duke of Savoy touching the Treaty of Monson, though the Duke was not
there in Person, yet his business was dispatched with as much advantage to
him, as if he had bin there present, by the French Ambassadors; nor had he as
much cause of grievance, as he had of many high obligations of gratitude, to
have his Country and Towns restored unto him which had bin so often overrun by
the French arms.

Concerning his colleguing with Protestants, Spain may be upbraided as well;
for Charles the Fifth employed Lutherans, whom he called his black bands,
against France and Rome her self, and that by the advice of his Theologues:
This present King Philip had private intelligence with the Duke of Rohan, who
paid him (and his brother) a yearly Pension, to keep France in action by
Civil Wars, and had entered into a Treaty with him accordingly consisting of
diverse capitulations; Moreover the Catholic Kings have had, and have to this
day friendship and confederacy with diverse Pagan Princes, and amongst others
with the King of Calecut (who adores the Devil) for a little Pepper or such
like Commodities: Nor are there wanting examples how in the time of the Moors,
the King of Aragon made use of Moriscos against another Christian King. Another
makes an odd Apology for this King why he confederated with Protestants, and
employed them so much in his wars, which is, that he made use of them against
the greatness of the House of Austria only, whom they suspect and perfectly
hate: And touching his subjects of the Religion in France, it was never out of
any affection unto them, or out of any conceit of fidelity he had of them, that
from time to time he gave them Honor and offices in his Armies, but out of a
politic end to diminish, and destroy them by degrees, for a greater number of
them, then of Papists perished in his wars.

For breaking with his Brother in law the King of Spain and the House of
Austria; he did it merely out of political interests, and pure reason of State,
which is now grown to the highest point of subtilty, and swayes the world more
then ever; It is well known that France (as all Europe besides) has bin for
many years emulous of Spain, and suspectfull of her greatness, for she has bin
still growing and gathering more strength any time these hundred years; In so
much that considering her huge large limbs she was become a Giant in comparison
of all her neighbors; France was fearful of this unproportionable hugenes of
hers more then any, and therefore being somewhat distrustful of his own
strength to cope with her single, he enters into confederation with others, as
the Hollander, and Swed; So that this war of France with Spain is merely
preventive; Nor is preventive war a new thing, but we have warrant for it from
Antiquity; I am sure it is as old as that of Peleponnesus, the ground whereof,
was to keep the power of Athens within its wonted channel, which went daily
swelling ore the old banks; this gave the first alarm to the Lacedemonian to
stand upon his Guard, and to put himself in Arms; whence afterward issued
that long lived war which History renders so famous to posterity. Alphonso K.
of Castile made war against the Moors, and the rest of the Spanish Kings (for
there were diverse then in Spain) finding him increase in power collegu'd
against him; and the reason the Historian gives is, Nunquam satis fida
principum potentia finitimis est, occasionem proferendi Imperii avide
arripiente natura mortalium. The Decree of the College of Sorbon is, That the
exorbitant greatness of a neighboring Prince may be a just ground for a war.
It Is well known how watchful those three Geryons of their times, Charles the
Fifth, Henry the Eight of England, and Francis the First of France, were to
keep their power in aequilibrio; they had always an eye upon the Scale to see
which way it panch'd and outpois'd: And it has bin used to be the old policy
and power of England (though now cross winds have long blown upon her) to
question any of her neighbors touching their increase of strength in shipping.
There be examples without number how it has bin always the practice of the
sagest Princes, as being a rule that is warrantable in the school of prudence
and honor, to prevent that their adjoining neighbors oregrow them not by
access of new power, either by weakening their Allies, by Monopolizing of
Trade, increase of Territory, by mastering of passages, or by too near
approaches. The last makes me think that it is high time for the Hollander to
look about him considering the late acquests of the French in the Netherlands,
and to be warnd by the old Proverb, Aye le Francois pour ton Amy, non pas pour
ton voisin. Have the French for thy friend, not for thy neighbor.

The Austrian Eagle had displayed his wings wider then formerly, by addition of
the Palatinat, Triers, and other places in Germany: France took Arms to make
him mew these new feathers, and she had those three things, which one said were
requisite to make her eternal, favorable unto her, viz. Rome, the Sea, and
Counsel: Pope Urban the Eight had his breeding there twenty years together and
so was a friend to her; she had a competent number of Ships, and for Counsel
she had Richelieu for her Pilot: He was not like your Country Wasters that
Demosthenes writes of, who were used to grow skilful in defending those parts
of the body where they had bin hurt, but he could foresee and fence away the
blow before it was given: And for others, he carried matters so that some of
them found their hands sezi'd upon when they were ready to strike. This caused
him to make his King the first aggressor of the war against Spain; wherein he
had wonderful success, and done such feats (as has appeared already in the
body of the story) that as they have struck an amazement in the present age, so
they will breed an incredulity in the future.

Touching the last complaint against him that he peeled and poll'd the Peasan,
it is true he did so; but he who is versed in the humor of that people, what
boiling brains, and perpetual inclinations they have to noveltie, and to break
out into motion, if they be pampered with peace and riches, will conclude, that
there is a necessity to keep them short in point of wealth, whose ordinary
effects are pride and insurrections: Yet I believe there may be other more
laudable vvayes of policy used for prevention of this then poverty; It being a
true maxim in the Academy of Honor, that it is more glorious for a Prince, to
be King of an opulent free people, then of a slavish and beggarly: And the
greatest reproach that Forreners cast upon the French Government, is, that the
wealth of the Country should be so unequally dispensed, the King, Clergy,
Nobles, and Officers svvallovving up all, while the common people have scarce
that competency which beasts use to have to satisfy the necessities of Nature:
for there is not upon earth a more plentiful Country, and a poorer people
generally, then the Pesantry of France. There was another reach of State why
the common people were kept so poor and indigent, which was, that he might
be supplied with soldiers to furnish his Infantry for the wars, whereunto
necessity will drive any one; At the sound of his Drum they came alvvaies in
multitudes to serve him because he had alvvayes store of treasure to pay them;
He had at one time above 120000. of them in several Armies, nor were there
ever such services performed by French foot, who formerly had but small repute
in the world; with these and his cavalry he performed such exploits that as I
said before, posterity must have a strong faith to believe them; such exploits
that Mars himself (the ascendent of France) might have bin invited to partake
of his triumphs;

-- vel et ipse vocari Jupiter ad praedam posset. With these he drew the
overwhelmings of Spain into a narrower channel, and put her to cast her policy
into a new mould, for whereas before she was for many years upon the conquering
and offensive part, she is now content to stand upon her guard, and put her
self upon the conserving and defensive part.

By these performances of France against the Monarchy of Spain it visibly
appears, what advantage a little body that has his joints well knit and
compacted, and has also his radical moisture and radical heat (the two gran
columns of life) dispersed in equal proportion throughout all parts to actuate
the whole and make it vigorous, (for such is France) may have over a huge
unweldy bulk whose members by vast uneven distances are so loosly kept together
as the Spanish Monarchy is known to be; which, were she as closely knit as
France, or the Ottoman Empire either which extends two and thirty hundred miles
and but the ( Hellespont between) in one continued piece from Buda in Hungary
to Bagdad or Babylon in Asia, I say, if the modern Monarchy of Spain were so
closely united, she might compare with the greatest that has bin yet upon
Earth.

And now will we put an absolut period to the history of the life of Lewis the
Thirteenth. Which we have illustrated in the best manner we could, as also to
this Corollary and short transcurrence of his reign, which lasted thirty three
years, and his whole life hardly reached to forty three, a time which as was
said before, in a well disposed body is accounted but the Meridian of manhood;
whether nature posted away, and hastened thus her course in him and made him old
before his time by her own weakness, or by accident, (as some mutter) we will
not determine, but rather give faith to the first cause, and to diverse dangerous
sicknesses whereof he had passed the brunt formerly, as also to exces of care
and intentivenes of mind, and personal pains in the war: He had a long time to
study the art of dying, his disease being a Consumption, which afforded him
space enough to set his House in order; He spoak often times of the troubles of
Great Britain in his sickness, and once he was overheard to say that it was a
just judgment, because his Brother of England would have assisted his subjects
once against him.

So this great King died in the highest glory of his actions, for his sails
swelled with prosperous winds till he came to his last port. He had settled all
things so exactly, that when he came to die, he had nothing else to do, but to
die, which he did so gently, that it was rather a soft dissolution then death;
By his high exemplary virtues, and strangenes to vice he was a Saint amongst
Kings on earth, and now may be a King among Saints in heaven, whither he went
on Ascension day: For his acts of prowess he deserves to have the Alps for his
tomb, and the Pyrenean Mountains for his monument, for he made them both to
stoop unto him: He left his Queen (a year and some months younger then
himself) Regent, as it was her due by Saint Lewis law, which she might have
clam'd by merit, as well as by right, for she had bin marvailously complying,
careful and indulgent of him; A Lady of admirable sweetness, moderation, and
prudence, for she never tampered with the Government in his time, nor would she
meddle with the Election of any Officer or Minister of State, nor interpose in
any thing, but in matters of mercy and pardon, and then she would be sure to
have an inkling how the King was inclined (which made her receive few denials)
so that being much importuned for Monmorency's pardon (whose first crime, was
the last action of his life) she would by no means attempt it. The young King
was four years and eight months old when his father died, so that the Queen
is to rule in chief till he be fourteen, whereby France, in statu quo nunc, may
be said to have fallen under the government of Strangers, the Queen Regent
being a Spaniard, and Mazarini the Prime Minister of State an Italian.

THE LIFE OF ARMAND JOHN DE PLESSIS Cardinal of RICHELIEU.
HAving done with the Master, we will now descend to his Minister, the Cardinal
of Richelieu, a man so cried up, that every corner of Christendom rang of his
report for twenty years together, nay the walls of the Seraglio ecchoed with
his fame, and fear of the mighty doings of France, which made the Turks to
think oftener upon that famous Prophecy they have amongst them, that the
Ottomans should at last get Kenzal almai the Red Apple, which they interpret to
be Rome, but not long after, their Empire should be destroyed by a Flower, by
which they think are meant the Freinks. He was a Gentleman of very ancient
descent, for in the Tree of his genealogy I find, that by the House of Dreux
his Ancestors were allied to Lewis the gros, one of the Kings of France; and by
a direct uninterrupted line he came for thirteen degrees from Father to Son,
from William of Plessis who was a Gentleman of high account in Philip Augustus
time, 1179. When his father Francis De Plessis died he was but five years old,
and so remained under the tutele of his Mother Susanna de Porta, who gave him
all the advantageous breeding that could be in Paris (where he was born) both
in an Academy for riding, and handling of arms, and in the University for
learning; he made choice of the College of Sorbon to finish the course of his
studies, where he took the profession of a Theologue, and so became a Sorbonist
Doctor. He had two brothers, Francis, the eldest, was killed by the Marquis of
Themines in duel; Alphonso, the second, being elected Bishop of Lusson forsook
the pomp of the world, and betook himself to the austere life of a Carthusian
(whose rule is never to eat flesh) and so resigned the Bishopric to his
youngest brother Armand, whose life we write: But afterward, by his means,
the Carthusian Friar was brought to accept of the Archbishopric of Aix in
Provence, then of Lions, and so ascended to be Cardinal. He had also two
sisters, Frances, married to the Baron of Pont de Curlay, who had of her the
Duchess of Esguillon: And Nicola, his second sister was married to the Marquis
of Breze Marshall of France, and first French-Viceroy of Catalonia in Spain,
upon the late revolt; who has a son and a daughter by her, John Armand the son
was General of the French Army in the West, and employed Ambassador
extraordinary to congratulat the new King of Portugal; Clara Clemente the
daughter was married lately to the Duke of Anguiern eldest son to the Prince of
Conde.

When his brother Alphonso had transmitted unto him the Bishopric of Lusson,
he went to Rome for a Consecration, and Paul the Fifth dispensed with his
incapacity of age, for he was but 21 years old; Some report that the Pope
observing the height* and activity of his spirit, was overheard to say, That
that young Prelat would overturn the world; being returned to France from Rome,
and brought to kiss Henry the Fourths hands, he was somewhat taken with him,
telling him that he was come from that place, whence one day should descend
upon him the greatest honor that Rome could afford a Frenchman* and afterward
he was used to call him his Bishop. For diverse years he applied himself
altogether to the function of his Ministry, and used to preach often in the
Kings Chapel: In the Assembly of the three States he was chosen Orator for
the Ecclesiastiques, where his pregnancy of wit first appeer'd publicly in
matters of State: Where upon he got footing afterward at Court, and was made
great Almoner: Then his abilities discovering themselfs more and more, he was
nominated Ambassador extraordinary for Spain to accommode the differences then
a foot 'twixt the Dukes of Savoy and Mantova; when the Princes started out in
discontent, and put themselfs in arms to demolish the Marshall of Ancre, some
Privy Counselors were outed of their Offices at Court, amongst others Monsieur
Villeray had his Writ of ease for being any more Secretary of State, and the
Bishop of Lusson was thought the fittest man to succeed him, and to receive the
Seals, which he did, and this diverted him from his foreign employment to Spain.

When the Marquis of Ancre was Pistol'd, and his wife beheaded, there was a new
face of things at Court, another generation of Officers grew out of the
corruption of the old, among others, Villeroy steps in to be Secretary of State
again in the room of the Bishop of Lusson, yet was the King willing he should
sit still at the Counsel Table; and Monsieur de Vignobles brought him an
intimation of the Kings pleasure to that purpose: But the Queen Mother retyring
from Paris to Blois, he chose rather to go with his old Mistress, then stay
with a young Master as the pulse of the Court did beat then; By some ill
offices that were done 'twixt the King and his Mother, by factious spirits,
many jealousies were daily fomented between them; Hereupon the Bishop of
Lusson, had order to withdraw himself from her Court; so he retired to his
Priory of Caussay, but that distance being thought not sufficient, he betook
himself to his Bishopric at Lusson, and that place also being suspected to be
too near, he was sent to Avignon the Popes Town, which might be called a
banishment, for it was out of the Dominion of France. Discontents growing
higher twixt the King and his Mother, till at last they broak out into a War,
and there being Armies on both sides in motion, Luynes writ a Letter to the
Bishop to repair to Angoulesme, to which Letter there was a Postscript annexed
all of the Kings own hand to the same effect. The Queen Mother was fled thither
from the Castle of Blois, and by means of the Duke of Espernon with others had
considerable forces a foot: Here was a brave opportunity offered for the Bishop
to show his head-peece in atoning matters 'twixt the Mother and the Son, for
which end he was inordred to repair thither: He negotiated the business so
succesfully by his dextrous addresses, and flexaminous strains of eloquence
that he took away the inflammation of the wound, and so made it easily curable:
A Treaty was agreed upon, and the Capitulations being drawn he brought them to
the King, who received him with much show of grace; and so all matters were
accommoded: But this accommodation did not heal quite and consolidat the
wound, for it had not searched it to the bottom, therefore it began to fester,
and more putrified matter broak out of it then formerly: The Mother and the Son
take up arms again, and the Bishop of Lusson was one of the prime Instruments
to re-compose the business, which was done at last very effectually. The merit
of these high services got him a Red Hat, and the dignity of Cardinal, though
some difficulties, and many delays intervened before the final dispatch came
from Rome: Then was he chosen Provisor of the ancient College of Sorbon; where
he procured of the King that a new Chair of Controversy should be erected. He
also repaired and much beautified that College; Then, upon the instance, and
by the advice of the Queen Mother, he was elected Prime Minister of State, and
Director in chief under the King of all matters concerning the public
Government of the Kingdom, so he came to be called the Argos of France.

The first great action that was performed by his guidance, when he was clim'd
to this Plenipotentiary power was the Marriage with England; the Marquis of Vieu
ville had been employed in this great business, but the Cardinal got some of the
Capitulations bettered and more to the advantage of France, alleging that it
was not fit his Master being the Eldest Son of the Church should have
conditions inferior to those of Spain.

With this Match with England, there was an alliance also made about the same
time with Holland for a sum of Money. These were the two first Coups d'
estat, strokes of State that he made, and it was done with this forecast, that
France might be the better enabled to suppres them of the Religion, which the
Cardinal found to be the greatest weakness of that Kingdom: Some of them being
Pensioners to other Princes to embroyle France upon all occasions.

He found then that the House of Austria had got some advantage, and increase
of power, by certain holds it had seized upon in the Valtolin; He advises his
King to ligue with the Venetian and the Savoyard, which he did and so spoiled
the design of the Spaniard that way.

The King being told that upon the beheading of the Count of Chalais, and the
imprisonment of the Marquis of Ornano about Monsieurs Marriage, his Cardinal had
thereby got diverse enemies, he appointed him a band of Soldiers for his guard;
After this he was made Super-Intendent General of the Marine, a new Office,
and such, that there was never any of the like latitud of power erected in
France, for thereby he had authority to supervise not only all the Sea Ports
and shipping of in both the Seas, but to do any thing that might co^duce to the
regulating and advance of Trade: so he fell presently to work, and fortified
Haure de grace, Brouage, the Isle of Re, Oleron, Verdun, with diverse other.
Afterward happened the Siege of Rochell where in the Kings absence he was made
General a while, and that famous Sea Dike was ascribed to his invention in
chief, after fifteen months siege the town was reduced, having bin driven to
the utmost extremities of want, as to eat nefandous meats, the leather of
Coches which served before for Instuments of pride, did now preserve them from
starving; at last they petitioned the Cardinal to be their Intercessor to his
Majesty for them, who got them more favorable conditions then was expected.

The King went thence to Italy with the same Army for the most part, and having
crossed the Alps, he took the pass of Susa, and raised the siege of Casal only
with the fame of his Person and Arms, and so relieved the Duke of Mantova,
having had besides some dispute with the Duke of Savoy about his passage, he
left the Cardinal behind to see all things settled: Who returning afterward to
France found the King in Languedock having debell'd almost the whole body of
them of the Religion, but the Plague being hot in that Province, he went to
Paris, and left his Cardinal to perfect the work, which he did at Mountauban,
which was the last Town that was surrendered, and so may be said to have bin the
key of the whole work.

Being returned to Paris there came news that the Duke of Savoy abetted by
Imperial and Catholic arms poursued still his interests against the Duke of
Mantova; In prejudice as was pretended, of the late Articles 'twixt him and
France; The Cardinal was appointed Generalissimo of two Armies, wherewith he
traversed the Alps again, took the Town and Castle of Pignerol; and returning
to Lion, to give account of his service he found the King sick, and powerful
enemies at Court, but especially he found the Queen Mother averse to him; He
perceived the faction so strong against him, that he fell on his knees before
the King desiring that he would please to dispense with his attendance any more
at Court, and that he might be permitted to retire to his devotions and the
functions of his Ministry; the King being now indifferently well recovered,
went to visit him the next day, and absolutely denied him leave to depart the
Court, saying, There was no reason he should forsake them who loved him, to
humor the caprichios of those that did not love him.

The Kings Army which he had left in Italy under Schomberg was at this time at
an extreme low ebb, and upon point of mutining if not disbanding for want of
pay, and there was scarce one thousand pound then in the Kings Coffers; yet,
notwithstanding the branling hazardous stand he was at, by reason of the Kings
sickness, and the potent combination which was a foot, and banded so eagerly
against him, he, of his own store, sent two hundred thousand Franks to keep
life in the Army, and this was before the Kings recovery, or assurance of the
continuation of his favor.

He was afterward made General of the Order of the Abbots of Premonstre, and
he had also the attribut of Eminence given him, which was solemnly confirmed by
Rome, to distinguish and peculiarize him from other Cardinals, and Princes of
the Church: nor would he receive any Letters, or speak with any Ambassadors
unless they would give him that Title: The Queen Mother utterly misliking his
aims of policy, which tended to put the Princes, her children, together by the
ears, forsook France, and Monsieur followed her. He returned with a
considerable strength of horse, and Monmorency, the popular'st man of France,
joined with him, to reform the State, and to ruin the Cardinal, who was used
to call the said Monmorency his son, but they missed of their aim; Afterward
the Count of Soissons, joined with the Duke of Bovillon attempted the like, and
had Soissons lived it was probable they might have done something, for they had
utterly routed the Kings Army, but Soissons being killed, it quail'd the whole
plot. The last attempt to destroy him was by Monsieur le Grand, who had
intelligence with the Spaniard, but it was detected, and so crushed in the
shell, and he with Monsieur de Thou beheaded. There were also diverse private
attempts upon him, Alfeston would have pistoll'd him, Chavagnac and Barnard
would have poisoned him, Gargan and Bouchard, who were reputed Magitians, would
have bewitched him, but they had all ropes for their rewards: so nature ran out
her course in him without violence, for he died in his bed, and at his house in
Paris about the dead of Winter in the beginning of December, a little after the
King had visited him, and bad him his last adieu, having not reached 58. years;
His right arm began to mortify many months before, and his whole body was
grown so lanke and thin as it looked like an Anatomy.

He principally recommended to the King Cardinal Iulio Mazarini, to whom he had
opened all the boxes of his breast, together with Monsieur Chauvigny and Noyer,
advising his Majesty to steer his course by their Counsel, and he should still
prosper and triumph: He bequeathed his body to the College of Sorbon; And
touching his estate, which was valued at near upon sixty millions of Franks, he
divided it to sundry Legacies* he gave the Marquis of Pont de Courlay the Duchy
of Richelieu together with the government of Brouage: To the Marquis of Breze
the Duchy of Fronsac estimated at an hundred thousand Franks yearly rent,
together with the government of Haure de grace: He bequeathed to the Duchess
of Eguillon his House at Ruel with fifty thousand Franks rent. He gave Monsieur
du Plessis Chinee twenty thousand crowns a year. His Cardinal Palace in Paris
where he expired he bequeathed to the King, with all the Plate and
Housholdstuffe thereunto belonging, and a Jewel valued at two hundred thousand
crowns: To the young Dauphin he gave his Library rated at fifty thousand
crowns: To every one of his Praetorian soldiers he bequeathed two hundred
crowns apeece, and preferred them all for a guard to the Dauphin; By this vast
estate it appears that though he was so active in his Masters business, yet he
did not neglect his own, so that the Kings service was not the sole Center of
his endeavors as he was usd to say often.

Such was the emigration out of this world of Armand John du Plessis Cardinal
of Richelieu, Duke, and Peer of France, Knight of the holy Spirit, and
Super-Intendent General of the navigation and commerce of France, Principal
Minister, and Director in chief of all affairs both of State and War, etc.
having bin thrice General, and once Generalissimo of three Royal Armies.

Questionless he was a man had a rare talent, and rich intellectualls, of a
notable vivacity of spirit, and constancy of resolution, of a prompt, yet
profound imagination, of a subtle discourse, yet solid judgment, (things which
seldom meet in one subject under that Clime) of pressing and powerful reason,
and a tenacious memory, in so much that all the faculties of his soul being
summond to consult seriously upon any business, they were enough to make a
complete Senate of themselfs. Add hereunto that he had an admirable gift of
elocution attended with state and gravity, and very swaying as it went along:
Many examples could be produced hereof, but we will instance in three only; In
a Complement, in a Letter, and in an Oration of his, which may serve to make a
judgment of the rest: For the first, when he had received the Cardinals Hat
from Rome, he attended the Queen Mother and told her, as if he had been
surpised with a kind of amazement,

Madam, I want words to express the thankfulness of my heart to your Majesty,
all that I can say, is, that I will spend my best blood, and all my spirits in
your service, and this Scarlet, which I wear by your goodness, shall make me
always remember this vow.

For the second, when the Queen mother was retired to the Netherlands out of a
high displeasure against him, he writ to her this ensuing Letter.

Madame, I know my enemies, or rather the enemies of this State, not contented
to have discredited me unto your Majesty, do endeavor also to make my
attendance near the King, to be suspected; as if my neernes to his Person
tended to remove him from you, and to separat what God and nature has so
closely conjoined: I hope by the goodness of God that their malice will be
discoverd, that my carriage will be shortly justified, and that my innocence
shall triumph over calumny.

Nevertheless Madame, I shall account my self still infortunat, in that I am
made to cease from pleasing your Majesty, and life it self is irksome unto me
in the state I am in, finding my self deprived of the honor of your favor, and
of that esteem which I valued more then all the greatness of the earth, and as
those which I possess proceed from your liberal hand, so I cast and prostrat
them all at your Royal feet. Excuse Madame your own work and creature,
whatsoever shall proceed from your Majesty's pleasure, shall be received by me
without murmuring, and accepted with a thousand thanks. But Madame, out of that
piety which is inhaerent in you, be pleased to spare the purple of the Church
wherewith you have adorned me, which will lose its esteem and luster, if your
Majesty cast upon it such black spots: How can it, be that the most obliged of
men, should prove the most ungrateful? And that my conscience, my first
inclination, and interest binding me to your service, I should now separat my
self from it, and thereby draw upon my self the name of Traitor to the best and
greatest Queen upon Earth?

This, Madame, well considered should absolve me from all crime, and free me
from all suspicion before your Majesty's tribunal, where I am almost condemned
without being heard: I appeal not from it, in regard of the perfect obedience I
bear to your will, I only blame my misfortune, but will not dispute with my
Soverain Mistress, nor ask reason of her for what is passed, nor do I intend
to make use of the Kings favor, or any ministers of his, or of the remembrance
of my former services, against the bent of your indignation: the very thoughts
hereof would be a crime, and opposite to my hopes, which are to find glory in
fidelity, and safety in innocence: I desire less to dragg my fortune in
France, or to carry it to Rome, to see more lamentable ruins then mine own:
Wheresoever your Majesty shall be, if I be not permitted access, it will be
death unto me; and wheresoever I go, it shall be to go out of the world; yet I
desire for my reputes sake, and for the rank I hold in the House of God, that
it might be after the vindication of my innocence, and, if it be not too great
a boldness, after the recovery of your Majesty's favor: If fortune afford me
this, I shall little resent my going out of the Court, nor out of the world,
because I die a thousand times a day, since your Majesty gives out, that I am
not the same, I was, which is

Madame, Your Majesty's most humble, most faithful, and most obedient servant
Armand. Card. of Richelieu.


Concerning the third which discovers more then any thing the abilities of a
Minister, this Oration shall serve which he pronounced in the great Convention
of Notables, a new Court generated of the discontinuance of the old Assembly of
the three Estates, the King himself sitting there in Majesty.

Sir; It Is needles in my judgemetnt to represent unto this Illustrious
Assembly, the great Actions your Majesty has performed within this year, as
well in regard the Lord Keeper has acquitted himself very worthily of that
task, as also because they speak clearly enough of themselfs; And there is no
man but sees that God has been pleased to make use of that piety, prudence and
courage which he has infused into your Majesty, to work those advantages to
France in so small a time, which some held impossible to be done in an age: Nor
is there any need to let them know the vast expense these high actions have
carried with them, because every one knows, that in matters of State, great
achievements cannot be done with little charge, and the numerous troops of
Combatants which your Majesty has bin enforced to entertain at one time in
sundry places, as well within, as without your Kingdom, afford understanding
men occasion to magnify your power, as well as to admire your vast expense.

There is not any amongst you my Lords, who knows not with what pureness this
treasure has bin issued, and what necessity there was of it; the probity of
those who managed the finances justifies the first point: and the oppression
of the Allies of this Crown, and the rebellion of them, who are Traitors to God
in this Kingdom do sufficiently assert the truth of the second: the desseins of
some having bin no sooner projected, then formed, to interrupt his Majesty in
reducing France to her first splendour: In so much that this State considering
the utility she receives thereby together with her Allies, have more cause to
approve, then complain of these charges.

Matters, thanks be to God, are now at a good point, but one cannot promise,
that they will continue so always, and it were to want judgment to think that
they must not be pushed on further; Of necessity this Kingdom must be left
exposed to the attempts of those who daily meditat the abasing, if not the
ruin thereof, or there must be means found to secure it. The Kings intentions
are to rule it so, that his government may equal, if not surpass any time
passed, and serve for an example for the future. The marvailous assistance
which it has pleased God to afford him hitherto, when his affairs were in the
most deplored case, gives us hope that he will still persevere: Being seconded
with the sage counsels of the Queen his Mother, with the concurrence of
Monsieur his Brother, who I may truly say is so fastened to his Majesty's will,
and the interest of the State, that nothing can separat him: I see no reason at
all to doubt of it, since none but God Almighty can produce things of nothing,
therefore to come to so good ends, of pure necessity, either the ordinary
expenses of the Court must be diminished, or the public receipts augmented, or
perchance both must be done.

It is not fitting you will say, to meddle with the necessary expenses, for the
conservation of the State, the very thought thereof were a crime: yet his
Majesty preferring the public before the private, is willing out of his own
motion to retrench his House in things that touch his own Person, leaving you
to judge how the rest will be employed.

One might think that such retrenchments were not seasonable at this time,
because they use to alienat sometimes the affections of hearts: But as the
business will be carried, great and small shall find their account and therein
their satisfaction; the most austere rules seem sweet unto the most tumultuous
spirits, when they have, not in appearance only but in real effect, the public
good and incolumity of the State for their sole aim.

Sir, the Queen your Mother, prays that you would think it good to let her do
that, which your piety toward her would not permit you as much as to think of
your self, which is that she be reduced to a lower revenue then she had in the
late Kings time; it being true that she had not bettered her condition then,
when during your Majesty's minority she raised the fortunes of others for the
advantage of your Majesty's service. Different times require different and
sometimes contrary courses, that which is proper at one time may be impertinent
at another.

In great tempests one must share his goods with the Sea, to lighten the
Vessel, and avoid shipwreck; prudence requires it, that the whole perish not,
for casting away part: the interest of particulars obliges no less then that
of the public; there being nothing more true then what an ancient Prelat of
this Kingdom said, That it is impossible the riches of private persons can
subsist when the State it self is poor and necessitous: By such husbandry the
ordinary expenses may be lessened by three millions.

It rests then to augment the receipts, not by such impositions that the people
are not able to bear, but by innocent means which gives place to the King to
continue what he has practiced this year in easing his subjects by diminution
of tallies. To this effect we must come to the redemption of lands, to
Notaries, and Registers, and other morgag'd rights which amount to twenty
millions, a thing not only profitable but just and necessary.

If this dessein take effect, the people who contribut more of their blood,
then of their sweat to the expenses of the State, shall be eased.

If there be need to resist a foreign Invasion, or some intestine Insurrection,
(if God for our sins permit any more) or to execute a dessein that is profitable
and glorious for the State, want of money will be no loss of time; there will
be no need to have recours to extraordinary ways, to Court partisans, and put
hands in their purses who have them often times full of the Kings moneys: One
shall not see the Soverain Courts busied to verify new Edicts: Kings shall
appear no more upon their beds of justice, unless it be to undo what they had
done some other time: In fine, all things shall be at such a pass, that has
bin long since desired by all good men, and may continue so whole Ages.

One will say, and perchance I may think so my self, that it is easy to propose
good desseins, and as pleasing a thing to speak of them, but the execution is
difficult: Yet nevertheless, I dare speak it in the presence of the King,
having well thought of it, there may be expedients found whereby within the
compass of six years one may see the end and perfection of this work: The King,
my Lords and Gentlemen, has Assembled you expressly, to search and find them
out, to examine things, and concur with him in resolution, his Majesty assuring
you, that he will readily and religiously execute what shall be determined for
the restoration of this State.

The sick sometimes die, by too many remedies, as well, as none at all; I am
bound to tell you this by the by, that to restablish this State in its first
splendour, there is no need of many Ordinances, but real executions; by this means
this Assembly may close more speedily, though she may be perpetual for the
fruit she shall produce: few words and many deeds will testify both the good
intentions, and judgments of them whereof she is composed.

The King doubts not but you will do what concerns your duty in this
occurrence: You shall know by the event that his Majesty will surpass himself
to procure the good of his Kingdom, the glory of reviving it, is reserved to
the virtue of so great a Prince: you are much bound to his goodness, that he has
vonchsaf'd to make you partakers thereof, and for my particular I should be
much bound to God, if he presently took me out of the world upon the
accomplishment of so high, so glorious, and holy a work.

As thus in things premeditated, so in ordinary extemporall discourse, he had a
pressing way of eloquence, and exaggeration of speech, which came from him in
such a grave serious accent that it moved all along, In so much that by his
garb he seemed to be rather an Italian then French; seldom or never would
reason thrust be out of her throne by any impetuous irregular motions; seldom
would his passions make any furious sallies; the greatest fit of distemper that
ever was discovered in him was, at the news of Wallesteyns death, with whom he
had held intelligence for betraying the Imperial Army, and so to pave a way for
France to ascend the Empire: He would easily break out into tears, and
tenderness of spirit. The prime perfection in him was his forecast, he was
quick-sighted and Eagle-ey'd in every corner of christendom; He had Echoes in
every Court which sounded unto him all the affairs of State, in so much that he
knew as well what was done in the Junta's of Spain, in the Consistory at Rome,
in the Cabinet Counsels of England and Germany, as if he had bin President of
all their Counsels; He had his beagles abroad every where, which were excellent
to find the sent of things, and amongst others one de Lope a Jew was his
chiefest Spy: A little before the revolt of Catalonia and Portugal, he was
overheard to say, That shortly he would give the Spaniard such a bone to gnaw,
that should shake all the teeth in his head: And touching the troubles of
Scotland and England he was used to say, 'twas easy for one with half an eye
to have foreseen them.

He had an excellent invention to devise ways to get money, in so much that
when the Cow slack'd, he had a way to press her nipples, so that all the time
of his sway the King never wanted Treasure: he used France like Prospero
Colunnas Goose, pluck the old feathers and the new ones will grow the faster.

He gave her likewise all sorts of Physic, sometimes he would give her a
purge, sometimes a vomit, then would he often Phlebotomize her, and by sweating
and fluxing do away the peccant humors: He held that Principle a vain thing,
which calls the peoples hearts, the Kings best Exchequer: He verified the
saying, that

La France est un beau pre,
qu'on ton-doit trois fois l'annee:
France is a meadow, which if you do mow
thrice every year, the grass will better grow.
Or,

France's like your beard, which the more often you shave,
still the more thick and plusher hair you will have.
He thought often upon that Maxim that populus aut humiliter servit, aut
superbe dominatur The common people serve slavishly, or rule proudly; they are
like fire and water, Good servants, but ill Masters; therefore he kept them
under, by impositions and poverty: It was long, before the King took him into
his bosom, though he had always a great conceit of his abilities: A good while
when he saw him come to Court, he was used to say sometimes, Voycy venir le
Fourbe, Here coms the cunning Companion; but afterward he so fastened upon his
affections, that whereas to others, Kings favors are but as Tenacies at will,
the Kings favor to him might be called a stable possession, 'twas not as
brittle glass, but as firm as Diamond: Thus for twenty years together he
sailed securely upon the Ocean of Royal favor, which uses to be full of
rocks, shelfs, and Quicksands, but he knew the use of the Compass so well,
that he avoided them all.

He was marvailously constant to his ends, assiduous and sagacious, whereby he
took off from the Frenchman that reproachful saying, which defines him to be an
animal sine praeterito et futuro. He fitted his projects so aptly to the means,
and the means to the ends, that he seldom fayl'd of his expectation: He stird
all the Caecodaemons of hell against the House of Austria, and a little before
he died he threatened to pull the King of Spain out of his Escuriall; such was
his foreign Intelligence, that he did the Enemy more mischief by discovering of
his Counsels, then by discomfiting his Arms. He had such a nimble
apprehension, that he often times would find out truth at first search, the prime
motions of his thoughts being so conclusive, that what discourse he formed upon
them afterward, was but an approbation of the first Idaea, which needed no
addition.

He was no great zelot in his own Religion, but as he made her subservient to
his political ends; nor would he ever employ Jesuit: he had a moderate opinion
of the Reformists, which made him to be called the Huguenot Cardinal. And he
would have often in his mouth this saying, Maneat moralis benevolentia, inter
discordes sententia. Yet he writ a book against them, which is extant. He did
them more mischief by complementing with them, then by combating; He was
overheard to say that he had taken Rochell in despite of three Kings, meaning
his own for one, for it was a great while before the King could be induced to
that expedition: Saint Martin was beholding to him for his cloak, else the
English had taken it away from him at the Isle of Re: with which cloak 'twas
said, Saint Martin covered him afterward in many Battles.

He was a great cherisher and promoter of virtuous men, and would find them out
wheresoever they were, in so much that he gave every year in pensions little
less then an hundred thousand Franks. He erected two Universities, one in
Paris called L'Academie de beaux Esprits, where the prime wits of the Kingdom
met every Monday; and another at Richelieu where the Mathematiques and other
Sciences were read in the French Language: the difficulty of the Latin
deterring many from the study of them in other places. He did so oblige all the
wits of the Kingdom, that they strove who should magnify him most; and there
were never such hyperbolicall expressions of any man and not without some
mixture of profanenes, which shows that there is no Inquisition in France. Some
said, That God Almighty might put the government of the world into his hands:
That France in God, and the Cardinals hands were too strong: that, What the
soul was to the body, the same he was to France.

Si foret hic nullus, Gallia nulla foret. Some appropriat, the reduction of the
Rochellers soly to him, therefore to sooth him, one French Chronicler writes
that in the taking of that Town Neither the King nor God Almighty himself had a
share in the action, but the Cardinal himself. Thereupon another made this
Distich.

Richelii adventu portae patuere Rupellae,
Christo infernales ut patuere fores.
The gates of Rochell opened to Richelieu,
As those of Hell to Christ asunder flew.
Then another.

Cedite Richelio mortales, cedite Divi,
Ille homines vincit, vincit et ille Deos.
Veil mortals, veil ye gods to Richelieu,
He mortals can, He can the gods subdue.
Another thus.

O Princeps delicte Deo, cui militat aequor,
Et tempestates omnia laeta ferunt,
Magne pater patriae, quae saecla ingrata recusent
Indigites inter te numerare Deos?
And in the French Language there are a world of such Hyperboles, we will
instance only in two.

Et si nous faisons des ghirlandes,
C'est pour en couronner un Dieu,
Qui soubs le nom de Richelieu
Recoit nos Vaeux and nos offrandes.
Another.

Heroes a qui la France erige des Autels,
Qui prevois, and qui fais le bonheur des Mortels,
Qui scais mieux l'advenir, que les chooses passees,
Penetre dans mon Ame, etc.
Another.

Si quelq'un dans ces verse parle de Richelieu
Qui sous l'habit d'un homme il nous descrive un Dieu;
Vous n'estes point suiet a l'humaine impuissance, etc.
He that is cried up for the Cicero of France, speaking of his book against them
of Charenton, says, that, that book might be the death of all other books,
except the Bible.

Another, though a Royal Chronologer, attributs more to him then to his Master,
the King himself. He calls him the gran Director, and most puissant Genius of
France, the perfectest of men, which does penetrat things to come, and is
ignorant of nothing, great and incomparable Cardinal, the most eminent among
mortals; to whom the crabbedst and most mysterious affairs of State are but
pastimes: Visible God, and tutelar Angel of the Univers, a spirit that moves
the Heavens, and the stars, the bliss of the world, the supreme intelligence,
the Phoenix of the earth, who never had, nor ever shall have his parallel.

These strange evaporations and high strains of profanenes show plainly, as I
said before, that the Office of the Inquisition, has no stroke in France, as
in Italy, Spain, and elsewhere it has, to curb the extravagancies of men's
brains.

As there were a number of such Sycophants amongst the Wits of France, that
Idolized him in that manner, so there wanted not others that threw dirt in his
face; by Pasquils and Libells; one dropped this Satyr in Rome, which flew
thence to the streets of Paris.

Papa noster in- Urbanus,
Rexque parum Christianus,
Cardinalis Infernalis,
Capucinus coaequalis,
Replent mundum tot is malis.
Urban our Pope not much urbane,
The King not too much Christian,
With the Infernal Cardinal,
And Capuchin his Coaequall,
The world do fill,
With thousand ills.
Another comes little short of this, by calling the Capuchin, the Cardinal, and
the Devil, the three degrees of comparison.

In the year 1640. there were extraordinary Revellings and Triumphs in Paris,
and there were diverse Masks and Balls in the Carninals Palace: And one
morning there was found nayl'd upon the gate this libell.

Tandis qu'en dance au Palais Cardinal,
La mere de trois Rois va a l' hospital.
While people dance 'ith Palace Cardinal,
The mother of three Kings goes to the Hospital.
Amongst other pieces of Invention which were published of him, there was one
called the Chymerical Ambassador, which in regard it is a new way of fancy
composed by a Person of quality, and very facetious, I will insert here; The
Author makes him to employ Ambassadors extraordinary not only to Christian
Princes, but other Pagan Potentates to enter into a Confederacy with them as
follows.

Master John Sirmond shall take the quality of the Duke of Sabin, and of the
Marquis of Cleonville; he shall clap a sword at his side, and take for his
train five or six of the Gazetic Academy, which we have made hardy liars: Above
all things they shall be instructed in the praises of my Lord the Cardinal
Duke, and to that effect they shall cun by heart all the Poems, Epigrams,
Acrostiques, Anagrams, Sonnets, and other pieces made by the Latin and French
Poets of the Times, which they shall disperse up and down gratis as they pass,
but for fear that this Merchandise be not forestalled, and this false money
cried down, we command the said Ambassador to depart as soon as possibly he
can, because our affairs do press us, and we may chance take our measures
short in regard Duke Charles, terming himself Duke of Lorain, is nimble because
of the nourture he has had in France; and the Germans, being now tired with
the troubles we have brought in amongst them may end the war; the Spaniard also
resents our injuries more then ever, and those Devils the Crabats advance
toward our Frontiers.

The Ambassador shall speak neither good nor ill of the King, because his
Majesty knowing nothing of this Ambassy may chance disadvow it: He shall
accommode himself to the belief of all Princes, Republiques, and people, and
shall make semblance to be of the Religion or Sect of them with whom he is to
treat; He shall extol the praises of the most eminent among mortals, he shall
call him a visible God, the tutelar Angel of the Univers, the Spirit that moves
the heavens and stars, the happiness of the world, the supreme intelligence, the
Phoenix of the earth who never had, nor is like to have his equal, etc. If he
find that it be taken ill that we have injured all the Princes of Christendom,
he shall study some reasons to make them digest all: If he find perhaps that
any books have been printed in Flanders against my Lord the Cardinal, he shall
avouch that they are abominable, and to be burnt by the hangman, if he speak
with any that detest Magic, he shall assure them that these books are full of
such stuff; If he find that Champagnie trembles, and that there is a dessein to
shake off the yoke in Lorain and Alsatia, he shall swear and all his followers
besides, that my Lord the Cardinal has raised 150000. foot, 20000. horse,
10000. pioners, and so many carriage horses, 300. Canons, with a proportionable
number of bullets, 100. millions in gold to give the law to all Europe: That
besides landforces he has 500. Galeons of war at Sea laden with 50000. men
more, and that there is biscuit, beverage and fresh water which cannot corrupt
to nourish them for ten years: That there are engines which will reduce
instantly to ashes any Town that resists; that there be Vessels that can sail
between two waters, and that can go under other ships to blow them up into the
Air, or sink them: That he has found out Archimedes his griping irons, whose
virtue is to grapple a ship a thousand paces off: In fine, my Lord, the
Ambassador shall omit nothing that may give security to Champagnie, and strike
a terror into Lorain, and he shall carry the business so, that the same arguments
may serve to raise fear and hopes.

He shall pass as speedily as he can by Strasburg, Frankfort, Nuremberg and
other Imperial Towns, which have not so much knowledge of the artifice of my
Lord the Cardinal Duke, and if he thinks fitting he shall conceal his quality,
and disadvow his Country, he may say he is an Englishman, to which effect he
shall make use of his Latin, and counterfeit as well as he can the English
accent.

If he is bound to enter into the states of the Duke of Saxe, and of the
Marquis of Brandenburg, he shall pass as speedily as possibly he can, because
those wretches have half spoild our mystery, in making their own peace, then,
when we thought to have made them perish with us; and since they would not do
so, they have rendered themselfs unworthy of the good grace of the most eminent
amongst mortals, and let them be assured that the Spirit which moves the stars
will cast ill influences upon them.

Then shall he pass to Poland to find the King, whom he shall salute in the
name of the most eminent among mortals, he shall assure him of his friendship,
and swear unto him that he will hold good correspondence with him, provided
that he enter in person with his forces into Hungary and Germany to make war
against his Uncle: It is here that my Lord Ambassador shall display all his
eloquence to show that to gain further security and further increase of power
there is no kindred, and that amongst Soverains the Soverain law ought to be that
which force of arms gives the weaker. The expedients required to ruin the
House of Austria, shall be proposed in this manner: That the most eminent among
mortals does promise ten millions of gold to the King of Poland, assuring him
of the Imperial Crown: If he says that we have no Electors on our side since
the Archbishop of Triers was so unluckily taken away: my Lord Ambassador shall
assure him, that we are so strong the the other side of the Rhine, that we shall
constrain the three Ecclesiastic Electors, and the Duke of Bavaria to do
whatsoever we please. There is no question for that, but to afford us means by
a notable diversion to settle our Kingdom of Austrasia, according to the Cart
that Bertius made to the most eminent among mortals, and which is always at the
ruel of his bed. It is an Empire that is designed for his Eminence, who scorns
to be called Cardinal Duke, and would be King at any rate. This Kingdom of
Austrasia contains all the Country 'twixt the Mose and the Rhin, to begin at
the French County, and to end at the source of both the Rivers. We have already
Lorain, Alsatia, Monbeliard, some part of the lower Palatinat, Mentz, and
something of Triers; we have when we will the French Conte, Luxemberg, Liege,
Colen, Iuliers, Cleves, and Gueldres; we shall agree well enough with the
Hollander for what they hold, and so we shall make a Kingdom for the most
eminent among mortals of 160. Leagues long, rich and well peopled, which shall
be given in marriage to the most accomplished Lady on earth the Niece of that
spirit which moves the heavens, who calls her self Madame de Combalet. My Lord
Ambassador may show her picture to the King of Poland, and if he likes her, he
may promise him for a dowry the Kingdom of Austrasia, the Duchy of Richelieu,
thirty places more in France, and ten millions of good gold without the false
money of the same allay which we gave the Swed.

If the King of Poland say, that the most eminent among mortals cosend the last
King his father, and that in the year 1630. Charnasse came in the behalf of
his Eminence to treat of a Truce 'twixt the Kings of Poland and Swethland, to
give thereby opportunity to the latter to enter into Pomerland, and thence to
Germany, as it appears by the Letter and Instructions of his Eminence in the
month of July of the same year: If it be alleged that the same time that
Charnasse treated of these things in Poland and Swethland, Cormolin was in
Moscovie for his Eminence, to invite the Russe against the Pole which he
effected; If these people, which are so simple as to give credit to any thing,
do accuse us of perfidiousnes, he must then disclaim the actions of Cormolin,
and swear that he had his head chopped off for making the Muscovit arm against
Poland.

If my Lord Ambassador advance nothing in Poland, where it is likely we are too
well known, he shall go to Russia, and let him take heed that the Barbarians
treat him not ill among those woods: He shall go straight habited like an
Englishman or a Hollander to Mosco to find out the Emperor, to tell him the
reasons which hindered him to send in the year 1633. the supply of men and money
which his Eminence had promised him, and that the Turk was not made to enter
into Poland as the Basha of Buda made his Eminence believe: He shall propound
that if he please to break the treaty of Peace with Poland, that Prince shall
be engaged far in Germany: Besides my Lord Ambassador notwithstanding any
denial shall swear that the party is made and tied already, and so the
Moscovit shall have a brave time of it in Poland. If these savages cry out,
that the most eminent among mortals is the cunning'st among mortals, and that
he caused the Moscovit to lose his repute before Smolensko where they were
beaten like so many dogs which made them part with two Provinces, and make a
dishonorable Peace; If they add that the Turk will attempt nothing on Poland
because of the knowledge the Gran Signor has of the generosity of that
invincible King, then my Lord Ambassador shall withdraw, for fear he receive
some affront.

We do not judge it necessary that my Lord Ambassador go back to Buda to treat
with the Basha, to make him surprise some places in Hungary, his Predecessor
having had his head chopped off for having enterpriz'd some things against the
intentions of the great Turk, and for receiving the moneys we sent him; It may
be feared that he who commands at present may command two of his Janissaries to
put my Lord Ambassador on his back and to give him an hundred strokes with a
Bulls pizzle upon his belly, as Monsieur de Saney was used in Constantinople
for a piece of roguery he did. Besides we hope the great Turk will break the
peace with Poland, and the truce with the Emperor, to which purpose we have
employed Monsieur de Thou to Constantinople, whither he has carried provision
to make that great Army the Turk has at Sea to descend into Sicily and
Naples, or to Malta; he has also in charge to interpose for a peace 'twixt the
Turk and the Persian, and to unite them if he can that they may destroy
Christendom.

We leave it to the discretion of my Lord Ambassador whether he see the Vayvod
of Transylvania, but if he resolve to go thither, he shall represent unto him
that the whole earth wonders that he attempts nothing against the Emperor, he
shall exhort him to imitat his predecessor the valiant Bethlem Gabor, and tell
him that all the good Houses of France have his pourtrait in their Galleries,
with that of the King of Swed, and that his Highness should do well to send also
his in doing some act of courage; If he say that he has an alliance with the
Emperor, and friendship with Hungary, and that for a Picture he will not
hazard the Original, in this case the Lord Ambassador is to withdraw himself
hansomly.

Then shall he enter Tartary where it is probable we shall manage our business
better, because that people know us not so well, withal they are fitter for
our turn, in regard they place all right, in Arms as we have hitherto done:
That they stay not long in one place, like the most Eminent of mortals, my Lord
Ambassador shall go visit Chamocublay the great Cham, wheresoever he be. He
shall not wonder at that fair Palace of Marble, Porphiry, and Jasper which
has half a league in every corner; He shall esteem it, but not in such a manner
but that his Eminence has Houses which approach in some kind those of Cambalu:
Above all things the Duke of Sabin shall take heed that he pull off his hat
very low before the great Cham; he must remember that Dracula caused three
Turbans to be nailed to the Turks Ambassadors heads, which drive their
Embassy out of their brains. He shall tell the gran Cham that the most
eminent among mortals is desirous to keep good quarter and correspondence with
him, and so shall present unto him his Credentiall Letters; and that it is
fitting his great Tartarian greatness should do some gallant thing, the Field
being now open for him in regard of the Cowardice of the Transylvanian, and the
affairs of Poland with the Swed, and of the troubles 'twixt the Emperor and
some of his Vassals, in so much that it is easy to invade the estates of these
three Princes, as also to restrain the Turk whom we have a long time engaged in
arms against the Christians. If the gran Cham, who is a Christian though of
the Greek Church, does imagine that by this last article we are enemies to Jesus
Christ, the Duke of Sabin must endeavor to persuade him, that Religion is but
the Republiques servant, and 'twill be expedient to translate for him a book
entitled the Catholic of State composed by Monsieur Ferrier, if he believe it
not, then the Ambassador shall labor to gain by promise of vast sums the
Governors of the twelve Provinces who are the principal Counselors, and
represent unto them that they are within a Country too subject to thunder,
snows, and sudden changes, in so much that often times one shall feel the four
seasons of the year in one only day, whereas in Hungary and Austria there is
for the most part a pleasant temperature, and that excellent Wines grow there.

In regard that the most eminent among mortals has a curious spirit, and that
he desires all the rarities of the world to embellish his House, Gardens and
courts, the Ambassador shall procure from some Garden in Tartary the Plant
Boraneth, which is like a sheep, and eats round about him all the herbs and
grass, so that there may be no need of a Gardner to make clean the circle of
his Courts; And that would serve for an excellent Emblem, to show what his
Eminence has done to all his neighbors in Richelieu, Paris and other places:
He is also desirous to find out all the strange Birds and animals that can be
had, being resolved to make a fair lower court in the Horse Market, which he
has closed within Paris, together with the Suburbs of Saint Honor, which has
cost the public at least a million of gold: The Ambassador shall also cause a
good number of those Tartarian Hens to be bought, which in lieu of feathers are
covered with black skins, and lay certain eggs which are purgatif, whereof his
Eminence has much need to mitigate his heat, and cleanse the ordures of his
blood.

When the Lord Ambassador shall have taken order for all these rarities, he
shall embarque himself for Cambalu, to go for China, he shall stay a while to
observe the stupendous wall that is twixt Her and Tartary; he shall take all
the dimensions of the wall very exactly, and send a survey thereof to his
Eminence; that, if need be, he may raise such another in his Kingdom of
Austrasia; and that, having already in his hands all the Ports and Havens of
France, he may also erect such a wall from Calais to Bayon, and because he may
want no workmen, he has a purpose to employ all those that shall be found to
speak ill of him to finish the work.

Then the Lord Ambassador shall embark himself upon the great Chanel that goes
to Peguin, the chief City of China, and so shall send notice of his arrival to
the Emperor: In his audience he shall entitle him, Son to Apollo, a Lion
crowned in the throne of the world, and King of thirty two Realms: He shall
say that of that people whom they call Caffres, or Spaniards, attempting to
ravish him of these fair Titles, and having the Lion in his Scutcheon, the
most eminent among mortals not enduring that this wrong should be done his
Majesty, sends to offer him his power, and to propose him a way how to be
revenged upon the Caffres in the East and West Indies, specially to take from
them their Mines of gold and sylver.

Having visited all the Kings of the East, my Lord Ambassador shall return by
the road which Alexander the Great took to enter into the Indies: And in regard
the most eminent among mortals is very curious in movables and other exquisit
things for the adornment of his Houses, my Lord Ambassador shall procure what
may be possibly had for that service; He must try whether in the ancient Town
of Tazila, there be left any old pieces of Porus made by Zeuxis, Apelles,
Polignot, or Euphranor: He shall endeavor also to bring some of those savage
Asses that are near the River Hyphasis, which have a horn in the forehead, that
his Eminence may make his entry upon one of them into his Kingdom of Austrasia,
and then put her to breed in his stables at Mirebalais; He shall also endeavor
to enchant by Scarlet color, and letters of gold certain Dragons, which are in
that Country, and to that effect he shall carry that robe of red Satin
embroder'd with gold, which the Cardinal of Lion wore, then, when he believed
himself to be God the Father. If we had a dozen of those Dragons we might draw
a great advantage for the security of his Eminencies Person, because they say
that in their heads there be certain stones found like that which made Gyges
invisible. The Lord Ambassador shall inform himself also at Paruca, if the
Inhabitants do yet understand the Language of Beasts, which would be
advantageous to his Eminence because he daily hears multitudes whom he has
transformed to simple animals.

My Lord Ambassador shall be careful to inform himself of the Indian
Brachmans, and know whether they are such great Magicians as they are reported
to be; If they are so, he shall confer with them, and learn of them, which way
to turn those strong places his Eminence holds into enchanted Castles, if he be
constrained to retire to any of them; To this purpose he shall learn what were
the enchantments of those Philosophers who overcame the Egipeans when they
assaulted them, and made them leave behind them up and down the Rocks the
pourtrait of their ill-favored faces, ugly beards, and double nails.

If the Lord Ambassador finds that he cannot do our business with these kind of
Philosophers because they are too austere and peaceful, he shall find out
another Sect called the Oxidraques, who are Philosophers which use to
discompose the humors of men, and make them rush out every where into war,
such are most fit for our purpose; If my Lord Ambassador cannot dive into
their mysteries, he must deboush one of them, and promise to make him compagnon
of the Reverend Father Joseph, who is already versed in some of the Maxims of
this goodly Society, and uses to sow war every month, that he may gather
something all the year long.

He must also make an exact research for the curious books of Metagenes,
wherein he teaches how to compound a beuverage whereby to make a judiciary
Astrologer, and take the Circle of the seven Planets, which knowledge would be
very useful for the most eminent among mortals to foresee what will become of
him, and to be able the better to prevent his enemies; for the Europaean
Astrologers have cousen'd him in diverse praedictions, specially in that of the
ruin of the House of Austria, and in the translation of the Empire; They had
also assured him that in such a year he should be Pope, and in such a year King
of Austrasia.

The Lord Ambassador shall try to get the Beast Marticora which is of a red
color, and has the head of a man lancing out sharp prickles from behind: The
spirit which moves the stars shall take this for his Crest.

The Lord Ambassador shall not fail to enquire if it be possible to recover
the pourtrait of the Great Talamoque, or that huge Galeasse, which the
Egiptiens sent two thousand years since to the Indian Seas, because the most
eminent among mortals would build the like, having already cut down a good part
of the Forests of Britany, to make such an Engine that may be able to crush the
English Ships, by being higher decked then the tops of their Masts; It shall be
called the Great Armand, which shall be able to swallow all the Bottomes on the
Ocean: whereon the Picture of the most eminent among mortals shall be put, who
cannot live but amongst waves, amongst troubles and tossings and tumblings,
besides he fears nothing more then the earth.

Then shall the Lord Ambassador pass by the Persian Gulf, and then to the
red Sea, and so through the Deserts of Lybia, he shall enter into Egypt, and so
advance to Ethiopia to see Prester John; He shall endeavor to persuade him that
he being of the Race of the Q. of Sheba, he ought to have a curiosity to come
to hear the wisdom of the most eminent among mortals, who knows more then
Solomon.

If my Lord Ambassador pass by Fez and Morocco, he shall endeavor to incite
them also against the Spaniard.

When his Excellence the Duke of Sabin, Ambassador extraordinary for the most
eminent among mortals to all the Great Monarques of the World, shall be
returned to Christendom, he shall advertise all Princes as he passes along,
that his Eminence is resolved there shall be no Peace in Europe, specially
'twixt France and the House of Austria (howsoever that there may be a way given
for Treaties to amuse the world) until both parties become equal in power,
therefore as he shall pass through Italy, the foresaid Lord Ambassador shall
procure one of those Scales wherein Cosmo de Medici balanced all the Princes of
the Western World, for the most eminent among mortals intends to do the like
most exactly, and weigh every State to the least grain, etc.

This was the substance of the rambling Instructions that were given the
Chymericall Ambassador, which kept more noise in Christendom then any thing
that ever was written of him; Another compares him to Hercules, and the Q.
Mother to Juno, whose animosity put Hercules to quell Monsters, and perform his
twelve labors, which were held impossibilities in others; At Sea Hercules
himself did not so many feats as he, for being High Admiral, his Galeon the
great Armand broak often through his pillars; He raised every day new tempests,
wherein Dolphin-like he loved to tumble and sport, and by this restles humor
of motion, he drive his Master into a vast Ocean of trouble and danger, his
sails having no other wind to fill them but ambition, and ayrie hopes of
honor; And while he labored thus to have his great Masters name and his own,
to fill future story, some doubt, whether they were not expunged out of the
Book of life; in regard they passed to their last Port through a Red Sea, the
one a young man upon the matter (being but 42.) the other not old, (being but
57.) and the reason may be drawn out of the Sacred Text, That the bloodthirsty
man shall not see half his days.

This Sanguinary humor in him, was suitable to the color of his habit; which
more incited, and praecipitated the French and others his Confederats to Arms;
as we read it to be the custom of the Indians, to present Scarlet colors, and
other bloody red objects before their Elephants, to make them more furious when
they are employed in the wars: This made him turn the very dust to soldiers as
he passed, and make swarms follow him, as well for the color of his coat, as
also for that holiness which some held to be inhaerent in it. I will conclude
all kind of Satyrs of him with these Latin ones, which may be instar omnium,
for they give a shrewd Character both of his nature, his actions, and of his
whole life; and it is in form of an Epitaph, and penned by one of the prime wits
under that Clime.

Primum quod a te postulo, Viator, est, ut Deum opt: max: lauds, quod haec in
Gallia securus leges: Deinde miraberis tantillo spacio claudi mortuum, quem
Terra non capiebat vivum: Illam ubi commovit, coelum movere voluit is, qui hoc
symbolum sibi arrogavit Men's sydera volvit: Ut intelligas qualis haec
Intelligentia fuerit, industria fuit sagaci, sed inquieta, pacis publicae, and
propriae tranquillitatis hostis: In magno, quod plurimi suspexerint, Ingenio,
magnam pauci familiares deprehenderunt mixturam dementiae: Animum ejus
laedebant omnia, sanabat nihil: Potentissimi Regis, non tam benevolentia, quam
authoritate diu stetit, Rerum exitu, non consiliorum prudentia foelix: Dei
solius infelix indignatione, cum turpibus morbis perpetuo conflictatus, locum
ignoravit felicitatis, quam sua and aliorum infelicitate quaerebat: nunquam
sibi visus beatus, ut nec iis probus qui beatum nuncupabant: Utrique bili,
vitae carnificibus, obnoxious, flavos ignes, at atras fuligines continuo passus
est, sic venenum quod in aliorum perniciem effudit, non sine sua continuit:
Supra omnes Mortales ambitione laboravit, supra plurimos avaritia; Regiae
pecuniae prodigus, alienae parcus: Crudelis offensus, ubi offenderat crudelior
extitit. Regiae Matris beneficiis ditatus, curis promotus, and potestate
potentior factus, illam gratia regis, liberate, bonis, Gallia, ac demum
extorrem Coloniae vita privavit: ne mortuae parceret, supremas ejus voluntates
rescindi, et insepultum cadaver per quinque menses, post quos et Ipse extinctus
est, in cubiculo relinqui voluit: Fratris Regis dignitatem violavit, and
personam opprimere studuit: Non solum a Matre filium, a fratre fratrem, sed ab
uxore virum aliquando avertit; Marillacum cum summa injuria, Montmorentium
summo jure, Saint Marcum jure cum injuria, Thuanum vel jure vel injuria capite
plecti voluit: Magnates aliquot carcere perpetuo, plures exilio damnavit,
multos ab Aula removit, innumeros proscripsit ne ipsius consiliis obessent; nec
unquam mitis Gallia tam frequentia supplicia vidit: Magni Regis, quem magno
studio decepit, nixus potentia, and foecundi Regni opibus adjutus, infinitas
sagittas perdidit, ut scopum praecipnum, a quo aberravit, attingeret: Aliquos
exitus secundos insanis conatibus pepererunt mentis actio vel agitatio
continua, projecta est omnia tentans mentis audacia, and rigida severitas;
Brevi evertendus si inter hosts externos aliquos cautiores, and inter aversos
Gallos fere omnes, vel adversarium unum invenisset: Multum illi favit, quod eum
vix quis noverit, vel iis, qui noverant, crediderit: Adeo fortunatus, ut qui
illi infensi erant nobiles, and milites, pro illius gloria suum and alienum
funderent sanguinem, dum ille regio jungeret suum: In quo consilio Sejanus
periit, and ipse perierat, nisi Soissonensem Regium principem sustulisset: Tam
noxiae potestatis vestigia, integro saeculo, Germania, Hispania, Italia,
Belgium, sed maxim Gallia vix delebunt: Et Civium et vicinorum miseriis
voluptatem captans; ut istis capillos velleret, illorum viscera laniaret: Nec
Regis sui sacrae valetudini aliquid indulsit, illam agitavit, dum suam exhausit
curis and vario animi pathemate: Illi primo divinae nemesis brachium corrupit,
quod contra coelum tetenderat, mox abstulit usum Dextrae, quae bellis ultro
illatis subscripserat; illud octo ante obitum mensibus computruit, unde haec
exaruit: Quod dolendum, qui Deum ita Vindicem sensit, non agnovit: Id ex eo
conjice, quod furorem in hosts privatos ardentius exercuit: Quod imminente
morte, politica magis prudentia, quam Christiana pietate, plus suos Regi, quam
se Deo Comendavit: Quod paucis diebus ante vitae tragicae catastrophen,
excogitatam a se fabulam, quam Europam triumphantem vocabat, exhiberi regia
magnificentia voluit, non tamen spectare potuit: Quod Ecclesiam afflixit
Cardinalis, sanguinem effudit Sacerdos, nullas injurias condonavit Christianus,
nec Homo meminerit se esse mortalem, etiam cum ebullientes e multis ulceribus
vermes admonerent, quam fragili, and faetidae corruptioni obnoxious esset: Ubi
omnibus viis etiam impiis per 18. annos, ad privatum, dispendio publici,
cucurrit finem, ad comnunem hominum, placida in speciem morte, sed multis quos
praemisit, tardiore, tandem pervenit: Fato functus est Lutetiae ante 57. cum
tribus mensibus: Galliam and Domum deserens, utramque incendere velle visus
est, illam extorta in Regis fratrem declaratione, istam ad placitum foeminae
condito testamento: Caeterum nec unquum dives Gallia tantum homini contulit,
nec alium Natura satis impatiens tam diu pertulit, nec pacis amans, mortuum
ullum tam hilariter extulit; Haec palam assero, quae tu clam suspicatus es
sapiens Viator: si quem adhuc dubitantem invenis, roga, ne deceptis vel
corruptis adulatoribus credat, sed mihi, vera ex intimis sincerisque promenti.
Omnes vero Mortales, ut sibi persuadeant, velim, plus apud Deum valere
justitiam vel minimam, quam potestatem maximam, nec aestimandam tam late
diffusam, famam, sed bonam: Multa turbare non esse multum agere, turbata
componere plus esse, ne turbentur impedire plurimum esse: Vulgus felicia
scelera pro virtutibus ducit, tu contra, nihil infelicius felici scelere
cogita: Fraudum egregius Artifex Richelius, plurimos ad momentum decepit, forte
seipsum in perpetuum: Heu, Universa, quae miscuit, non rediget in ordinem, qui
pacem quae cum illius ingenio turbulento non conveniebat, etiam fortunae suae
non convenire credebat. Inde tot mala quae Christianum Orbem a 15. annis
afflixerunt: Ora ne sit Deus vindex aeternus in authorem, qui magna
misericordia multisque miserationibus in magnis, multisque criminibus
indigebat: Tu Hospes Christian serio perpende quam nihil sit quicquid momento
praeterit; Nemo ex istis quos purpuratos vides ex hoc ipso felix est, non magis
quam ex illis quibus sceptru^ and chlamydem in scena fabulae assignant, cum
praesenti populo elati incesserunt, et cothurnati simul exierunt, excalceantur,
and ad staturam suam redeant: Add parvus cinis modo est, qui magnus Ignis
fuit, teter fumus nunc est, qui nuper coruscans splendour omnium oculos
perstringebat: Utinam non et fax illi in alio sit orb, qui in hoc Europae
fuit; Haec jam pacem, extincto bellorum fomite, sperat; Hortarer te Viator, ut
tanto pacis etiam suae dum viveret, hosti pacem precareris, nisi vererer, ne
illi molestus esses rem quam oderat illi apprecando; precare tamen quia juberis
inimicos deligere: si ad illum non pervenerit pax, ad te revertetur: sic
imperat Christus, in quo vive pacificus, ut in Illo placide conquiescas.
Interim vale.

This Epitaphicall Invective being a kind of Character of the whole man and a
Legend of his life, I thought worthy of rendering into English, for the
concisenes and weight of the style.

First, O Passenger, I desire thee to praise Almighty God that thou may read
this securely in France: Then admire, that he is cooped up in so narrow a
compass, now dead, whom living, the whole Earth could scarce contain: when he
moved Her, he also shook the Heavens, arrogating to himself this Motto, Men's
sydera volvit: That thou may know what an Intelligence this was; He was in
point of industry sagacious, but turbulent; being an Enemy both to the public
peace and his own: In that great wit, which nevertheless some suspected, some
of his Familiars observed a great mixture of madness: All things puzzled his
mind, nothing settled it: He stood so long, not so much by the love of his
great Master, but by authority, being more fortunat for the success of things,
then solidity of counsel: unhappy only in the wrath of God, being perpetually
attended with foul diseases; He was subject to both Cholers the tormenters of
man's life, black and yellow; so the poison which he disgorg'd for others ruin,
was felt by himself: He was ambitious above all men, covetous above most,
prodigal of the Kings money, and sparing of his own: when crossed, he was
cruel, and more, when he intended to cross: Being enriched by the Queen
Mothers benefits, promoted by her care, and made potent by her power, he
deprived Her both of the Kings grace, of her liberty, goods, and of France it
self, and at last of life at Colen where she died an exile: He spared her not
after death, but rescinded her last will, and kept her body five months after
above ground in her chamber: He violated the Kings brothers honor, and sought
to oppress his Person; He separated not only Mother from Son, brother from
brother, but wife from husband: He caused Marillac to be chopped off by extreme
wrong, Monmorency by extreme right, Saint Marc by right and wrong, and de Thou
by right or wrong: Some Nobles he condemned to perpetual imprisonment, he
banished more, he drive most of them from Court, he proscribed numbers lest
they might cross his Counsels, mild France never saw so frequent punishments:
the restless activity or agitation of his mind, his projecting and all-daring
boldness, and his severe rigidity produced some prosperous successes by such
furious endeavors: How easily had he fallen, if amongst his foreign foes he had
met with some more cunning, or but with one amongst his own Country men: It
much advantaged him, that any scarce knew him, or that he gave credit to any
that did know him; He was so fortunat, that those Nobles, and Commanders who
mislik'd him, spent their own and others blood, while he joined his with the
Kings: In the same Counsel Sejanus fell, had he also fallen, had he not taken
away the Royal Prince Soissons: The prints of so destructive a power, Germany,
Spain, the Netherlands, but France principally will scarce deface in a whole
Age: He took pleasure in his own Country men's and his Neighbors miseries,
that he might pluck the hairs of the one, and tear the entrails of the other:
Neither was he tender of the Sacred health of his King, which he shook while he
exhausted his own by cares, and various anxieties of mind: The Divine vengeance
first corrupted his arm which he had lifted up against heaven, then he lost the
use of his right hand, which had subscribed so many bloody warrants, the one
putrified in eight months, the other dried away: And, which is a fearful
thing, he who thus felt the revengefull hand of God, did scarce acknowledge
him, which may be inferred out of this, because he exercised his fury more
eagerly upon his private enemies: And that upon the point of death by Political
prudence rather then Christian piety he recommended his own to the King, more
then himself to God: besides a few days before the catastrophe of his tragic
life, he would have a Play acted of his, called Europa Triumphans in Royal
magnificence though he himself could not be at it: Moreover he afflicted the
Church being a Cardinal, he shed blood being a Priest, he never forgot injuries
being a Christian, he scarce thought himself mortal being a man, although
those foul worms which issued out of his ulcers might have warned him to what
a frail and faetid corruption he was subject unto: Having by all, even impious
means run to his own private ends for eighteen years, at last he came to the
common end of mankind by a gentle death in show, and slower far then was
wished: He expired at Paris, where he was born, being 57. years and odd months
old: Now leaving France, and his own House, he seemed to have a will to set
both on fire, the one by extorting a Declaration against the Kings brother, the
other, by making his last Will at the will of a woman: Never did plentiful
France bestow upon any one so much, nor, being somewhat impatient by nature,
did she endure any one longer; neither, being a lover of peace, did she ever
carry any one to his grave more joyfully: Discreet Passenger this I openly
avouch, which thou happily do privately suspect. If thou meetst with any yet
doubting, entreat him, that he give no credit to flatterers either corrupted or
deceived, but to me deriving truth from its true source: But I would have all
mortals believe, that with God the least dram of Justice prevails more then an
Ocean of Greatness, nor is true Fame esteemed by the extent but by the
goodness. That to embroyle many things, is not to do much; it is more, to
compose troubles, and more then that, to prevent they may not happen: The
Vulgar give the names of virtues, to lucky villainies, but be thou of another
mind, and think nothing more unhappy, then fortunat mischiefs: Richelieu the
egregious Artist of fraud, deceived many for a time, but himself happily for
ever: Alas, what he has shattered, can never be put again in order, who
thought that Peace which was contrary to his nature, was not convenient for his
fortunes, hence issued all those mischiefs which have afflicted the Christian
world so many years: pray, that God avenge not himself on the author, who
wanted mercy in so many great crimes: O Christian stranger do thou seriously
consider, what a nothing it is, what passes away in a moment; none of those
whom thou beholdest purpled all over, are happy in that, no more then those
that a stage assigns a Scepter or stately Robes unto, with the spectators they
likewise go out, are unbuskin'd, and return to their old stature: Seneca.
Behold what a few ashes he makes, who was so huge a fire, he is become now a
black smoke, who lately like a coruscant lamp dazzled all eyes: God grant he be
not a firebrand to himself in the other world, who was such a one to poor
Europe, which has hopes of Peace, now, that the tinder is spent: I could with
thee, O passenger, wish peace to so great an enemy of peace, even to his own,
while he lived, if I feared not that thou would do him an ill office, to
wish him that which he most detested: yet pray, because thou art commanded to
love thine enemies, if peace go not to him, it will return to thee: So Christ
commands, in whom live peacefully, that thou may rest in him eternally: In
the interim farewell.

There is another which draws nearer to the nature of an Epitaph of as pressing
and ponderous a style as this, but not falling so heavily upon him.

Adsta Viator, quo proper as?
Quod nusquam videbis aut audies heic legitur,
Armandus Johannes de Plessis Cardinalis de Richelieu,
Clarus origin, magnus ingenio, fortuna Eminentissimus,
Quodque mirere,
Sacerdos in Castris, Theologus in Aula, Episcopus sine plebe,
Cardinalis sine titulo, Rex sine nomine, ^lnus tamen omnia:
Naturam habuit in numerato, fortin^m in Consilio,
AErarium in peculio, securitatem in bello, victoriam sub signis,
Socios in praecinctu, Cives in servitute,
Amicos in obsequio, inimicos in carcere,
Hoc tamen uno miser, quod omnes miseros fecit,
Tam saeculi sui tormentum, quam ornamentum,
Galliam subegit, Italtam terruit, Germaniam quassavit,
Afflixit Hispania^, coronavit Bragantia^, cepit Lotharingiam,
Accepit Catalontam, fovit Suecram, truncavit Flandriam,
Turbavit Angliam, lusit Europam.
Poeta purpuratus,
Cui scena Mundus, gloria stiparium, Regia gaza Choragium fuit,
Tragicus maxim quam fabulam male solvit.
Post Regnum Testamento suis distribatum, paupertatem populo imperatam,
Dissipatos Principes, Nobilitatem suppliciis exhaustam,
Senatum authoritate spoliatum, exter as gentes bello and incendiis vastatos,
Pacem terra marique profligatam,
Cum fatiscente corpore, animum gravioribus consiliis aegre vegetaret
Et nullius non interesset ipsum aut vivere aut mori,
Iamque bona sui part mortuus, aliorum tantum morte viveret,
Derepente spirare desiit et timeri.
O fluxa Mortalitatis!
Quam tenue momentum est inter Omnia et nihil?
Mortui corpus rheda extulit,
Sccuti Equites, peditesque magno numero.
Faces praetulerunt Ephebi, crucem nemo, quia currus publicam ferebat:
Denique hunc tumulum implet non totum,
Quem tota Europa non implebat.
Inter Theologos situs ingens disputandi argumentum,
Quo migravit sacramemtum est.
Haec te, Lector, volui, heic te metire, Et abi.
Stay Passenger, where hastne'st thou?
Here may Thou read what thou shall see, nor hear any where else:
Armand John du Plessis Cardinal of Richelieu,
Noble by descent, great in wit, most eminent in fortune,
And, what thou may admire,
A Priest in the field, a Divine at Court,
A Bishop without Cure, a Cardinal without Title, a King without name,
Yet, One, who was all these:
He had Nature in all her numbers, Fortune in his Counsels,
The Royal treasure in possession, Security in war, Victory under his banner;
He kept his Confoederats in compass, his Country men in servitude,
His Friends at a distance, his Enemies in prison,
In this only wretched, that he made all men so,
Being as well the torment, as the ornament of his times.
He subdued France, he scared Italy, he shook the Empire,
He afflicted Spain, he crowned Bragantia, he took Lorain,
He accepted of Catalonia, he fomented Swethland, he maimed Flanders,
He troubled England, he cousen'd all Europe:
A purpled Poet,
Whose stage was the world, glory his curtain, the Exchequer his tyring-house:
His subject for the most part tragical, to which he put an il Catastrophe:
Having turned the Kingdom to Legacies, bequeathed poverty to the people,
Dissipated the Princes, exhausted the Nobility with punishments,
Bereft the Parliament of power, destroyed other Nations with fire and sword,
driven away Peace by Sea, and Land;
His body now fainting, his mind not recreable for restles thoughts,
when it concerned every one that he should live or die,
Being already mortified a good part, and living only in others death,
He suddenly ceased to breath, and to be feared:
O the frayl things of mortality!
What a small moment is there, 'twixt something and nothing?
The corpse was carried in a Chariot, horse and foot followed in great numbers,
Pages carried Torches, none the Cross, for the Chariot carried the public
Cross:
In fine he hardly filled up his grave,
Whom all Europe could not fill:
He lies among the Sorbonists,
Of dispute a mighty argument;
And where he is gone, it is a Sacrament:
Reader, this is all, I would have with thee,
Hereby measure thy self, and be gone.
Thus was this great man the subject of every man's censure, a thing incident
and inevitable to all Favorits, and Minions of Princes, who like wooden
popagayes fastened upon high poles, are marks for every one to shoot at; they
are exposed to unsavory, as well as to sweet breaths, to rough blasts, as to
gentle brizes: But our Cardinal had taken such deep rooting in his Masters
heart, that for many years no cross winds, though never so impetuous and
violent, were able to shake him: Add hereunto that he strongly fortified
himself by alliances, and had in his hands the tenablest places of France, by
Sea and Land; So that he seemed to be like a tree planted upon the Mount
Olympus, transcending all meteorologicall impressions, and those frog-vapors,
and malignant airs which use to hover in the lower Regions, and if there hung
any, his Masters countenance, like the Orient Sun, would presently dispell them.

Considering, as the world knows, a directing minister of State was requisite in
France, certainly the King could not light upon a more idoneous instrument, for
he was cut out for a Statesman, his brain was always at work, and his
thoughts still grinding something; his counsels were oracles, and his desseins
mysteries, till put in execution, and then they turned to exploits most
commonly: He was not only wise but politic; Now, wisdom and policy (as it is
taken in these times) though they both agree in their ends, yet they differ in
the means conducing to attain their ends; the first goes the plain direct high
road, the other uses now and then some odd bypath: Never any brought the
principles of policy, which are general and confused, to a greater certainty;
they are easily prescribed, but practiced with more difficulty then those of
any other Art; The Navigator directed by his Compass is sure to come at such a
height, and arrive to such a Port: the Mathematician can exemplify, and really
demonstrate the truth of any of his principles; The Architect by his Model and
instruments can exactly (having materials accordingly) raise such an edifice;
The Musician scruing up his strings to such a height, is sure to hit upon such
a tune; The Physician knowing the virtue and operation of his drugs, is sure
they will restringe or purge, open or obstruct; It is not so with the
Politician, who though he adapt and apply his principles never so dexterously,
yet he cannot assure himself of the effects: which must be imputed to the
world of contingencies, obstacles, and inexpected accidents which use to attend
the negotiations of men, specially matters of State, and War: yet this great
Minister brought them to as much certitude as could be; In so much, that before
the breach with Spain, he was used to say, that the Almighty and irresistible
hand of heaven was only able to ranverse his desseins, not any humane power;
And it proved true, for the Austrian tree (which was the aim of all his
policies) was never so shaken: nor France never so secured; so that take the
Theoric, and Practic part of policy together, Olivares and Oxenstern his
contemporaries, yea Machiavil himself (taking him in the best sense) had he bin
living, might have bin his apprentices. And it was the more easy for him to
bring such things to pass, in regard that he had the power of disposing all
things entire and so concentred in himself, that he met with no opposition,
with no cross counsels or contestation; for the King had resigned not only his
power, but his judgment, and all the faculties of his soul unto him alone, nor
would he listen to any advised him otherwise; which was no small advantage to
the carriage of things, for, though in the multitude of Counselors there be
safety, yet, in the conduct of State affairs (specially Martial) wherein
secrecy and speed are so essentially requisite, that they may be said to be the
two poles whereon they move, I say, in the tracing and managery of such
actions, where oft-times the ball must be taken before the bound, too great a
number (of Counselors) is an encomber, and makes the dessein subject to
discovery, or delay, to be retarded or revealed, and so to miscarry, and miss
of the end: yet this solenesse and singleness of counsel may be thus
qualified; Quod fieri debeat, cum multis tracta; quod facturus es, cum
paucissimis. But whereas many cast in his dish, that being a Cardinal, and a
Bishop Cardinal too, he was unfit to be a Captain general, it may be answered
that it is no new thing in the Roman Church, no not in France it self, where
diverse examples may be produced: Arnaud de Pelegrue, Clement the fifts kinsman,
being Cardinal, was General of an Army in the year 1330. Andoin de la Roche
Abbot of Cluny and Cardinal was the like 1360. The Cardinal of Alby, otherwise
called the Cardinal of Arras commanded in Chief the Army of Lewis the xj. Nor
can Spain reproach him of this for Cardinal Albornost, Kimenes, and Carvaial,
all three, were Generals for the Kings of Spain, and Charles the fifth employed
Cardinal Pompeo Colonna often in that nature. And the other day Cardinal
Ferdinando this King of Spains brother, was his Generalissimo in the
Netherlands, having fought Norlinghen battle in his way. Nay, not only
Cardinals, but we read of Popes themselves that personally commanded their
armies in chief, among others John the tenth, Leo the ninth, Paschall the
second, Urban the second, Victor the third, Lucius the second, Innocent the
second, and Julius the second.

But of all Cardinals I have read of, our present Cardinal may be most properly
compared in disposition to Ximenes of Spain, and Wolsey of England; to the
first, for his inclination to war, for Cardinal Ximenes was used to say, that
Gunpowder gave as sweet an odor in the field, as incense at the altar. To the
second, for his magnitude of mind: Wolsey had for his Motto

-- non haec sine numine Divum Eveniunt. Richelieu had -- men's sydera volvit.
But in magnificence Wolsey surpassed him, it is true this late Cardinal had a
band of soldiers perpetually attending him, but nothing comparable to the
other for domestic attendance; when Wolsey was mounting his Mule at White Hall
gate to go sit at the Chancery, the first of his train all along would be by
that time at Westminster Hall: He went to France with 1000. horse Ambassador,
and was Arbiter of most of the Debates twixt the Emperor and Francis the
first. Richelicu gave his King, his Cardinal-Palace for a gift; Wolsey, Hampton
Court all furnished worth four of the to'ther, a gift as one said, too great
for a Subject to give, and a King to receive. Richelieu repaired the College
of Sorbon, erected a few Schools for reading the Sciences in the vulgar
language: built the Cardinal-Palace in Paris, and the Palace of Richelieu in
the Country: Wolsey built Whitehall, Hampton Court, the huge College at
Ipswich, and Christ-church in Oxford, the greatest Monuments of that kind in
the world; besides a tomb he had intended and three quarterd finished for
Henry the eight his Master at Winsor, which, had it been perfected Europe, had
not had the like, nor would his son or any of his two daughters be at the
charge of finishing it. And as in magnitude of mind, so in a constancy and
fastness to himself he sympathiz'd with English Wolsey, (who amongst other
properties was specially observed for that;) For when his affections fixed upon
any thing, he would employ the whole man to compass it; his mind was like a
stone hurled into the water which never rest's till it comes to the bottom: So
when he desired any thing he would leave no stone unstirr'd, (as they say) no
ways untried, but he would attain it: A Gentleman of quality told me a
passage of him, that a Merchant of Paris brought him a jewel of high price to
show and sell, he was so taken with it, that he offered 50000. crowns for it,
the Merchant demanded 15000. more and would not go a penny less: A few days
after the Merchant carrying the jewel to a great Lady to see, was suddenly in
some place of advantage surpised, muffled and so unjewell'd: A little after
the Merchant going to the Cardinals Secretary upon some other business, the
Cardinal hearing of his being there, sent for him, and making grievous moan
for his jewel, the Cardinal fetched out of his Cabinet a box, and drew thence
a jewel, and asked whether that was his; the Merchant in a kind of amazement
answered, I dare not say it is mine, because it is in your Eminencies hands, but
were in it any other hand I would swear it were mine: Go, says he, and keep a
better conscience in your dealings hereafter, for I know what this jewel is
worth as well as you, and out of that I have offered you already, you may draw
very fair gains; so he gave order his 50000. crowns should be paid him, and
the business was hushed up. We draw now to an end, and to bring our Cardinal
with a sweet odor to his grave, and take away something of the ill favor of
those Epitaphs that went before, we will add this upon him in Sorbon.

Lege.
Primum illi beneficium nasci, proximum agnosci,
Majoribus ornatus, Majorum ornamentum,
Episcopatum dignitate major omnino implevit:
Edoctum in coelo, ad coelum opera demonstrarunt,
Ad Status Secretariatum erectus est, qui Statum recturus erat,
Regenti Matri adstitit, Regni Pater futurus,
Volente Rege, cogentibus meritis sic Roma purpuram concessit,
Ut dubitare liceat,
An plus Eminentiae contulerit purpurae, quam ab ea retulerit;
Eminentissimum fecerat prior virtus, quam Roma:
Ad fulgorem purpurae fremuit Aquila, rugiit Leo,
Rosa palluit:
Nec potuit purpuram fugere,
Qui, si martyrum insignia non tulisset,
Hostium sanguine tincta far potuit, qui tot abstulit:
A Regina matre recessit cum Regina voluit esse,
Non Matter:
Publicae quietis amator, non fortunae;
Odio fuit, quia satis non potuit amari:
Nec in Aula, nec in Oceani fluctibus fluctuavit:
Immotus mansit, cujus ad obsequium commotae sunt Rupes, Rochel.

Et sub eo, conspiratione Rebellium cedente,
Respiravit undique Religio,
Quae sine eo passim expiratura videbatur.
Privatos hosts, cum voluit, vicit, Regios semper:
Sic sibi vacans, ut aliis non videretur intentus,
Sic aliis, ut non sibi:
Mirabilia fecit totius Orbis Miraculum,
Felix quod Justo Regi placuerit;
Felicior, quod ita Regi Regnoque servierit,
Ut utrumque servaret:
Tandem, profligato Germano, caeso Hispano,
Pacato Regno,
Seque ipso, omnibus majore, victo,
Spretis umbratilibus terrae triumphis
Immarcescibilem a Deo Coronam recepturus excessit,
Incertum relinquens,
An vixerit et rexerit felicius, an obierit sanctius:
Ab Invidia planctum extorsit,
Et, quo praesentem exercuerat, absentem luxit;
Nec poterat ultra progredi, summum attigerat.
Exuvias mortis Sorbonae dedit, quo vivo
Sorbona fuerat animata.
In Sorbona quam dilexit, tumulum elegit,
Et in sinu ejus jacere voluit,
Quam jacentem invenit et erexit,
Etiam Sorbonae Genium, si jacuisset, solus erecturus:
Debilitatis undique Hostibus,
Soli Morti cessit Mortis Victor, suique superstes,
Dum in omnium ore, animoque vivit:
Ora et Vale.

The Monument of the most eminent Cardinal Duke of Richelieu.
Stay Passenger, Armand John du Plessis Cardinal Duke of Richelieu has
deposited here, whatsoever he had of mortality: Stay, if thou art French, at
his ashes, by whose Counsels France stood; Stay, if thou art a Confederat, at
the Cardinals tomb, on whom as upon a hinge all Europe moved: Stay, if thou
art an Enemy, at the trophey of the Duke of Richelieu, at whose beck the Ocean
stood: Read on, His first good was to have a being, his next to have a
well-being; As he was adorned with Ancestors, so he was an ornament unto them;
for his knowledge and actions, the one came from heaven, the other tended
toward heaven: He was promoted to be Secretary of State, who was afterward to
rule the State; He was assistant to the Queen Mother, who was to be the
Kingdoms Father: The King being willing, and his worth enforcing, Rome so
granted him the purple, that it might be doubted, whether he gave or received
more Eminence unto it: His virtue made him most eminent, before Rome; At the
brightness of his purple the Eagle quaked, the Lion roared, the Rose grew
pale; nor could He avoid the purple, which had he not worn as ensigns of
Martyrs, yet, he might carry them died in the blood of enemies: He withdrew
himself from the Queen mother, when she would be more Queen then Mother; A
lover of public Peace, not of fortune. Hated he was, because he could not be
loved enough: He fluctuated neither at Court, nor in the Ocean floods: He stood
immovable, at whose nod the Rocks stirred, and under him the conspiration of
Rebels being quashed, Religion began to respire every where, which without him
was ready to expire: he overcame his own foes when he listed, the Kings
always: He was so vacant to himself, as if he intended nothing else; so intent
to others, as he seemed to neglect himself: being the wonder of his age he did
miracles; happy he was that he pleased a just King, and happier, that he so
served the King and Kingdom that he preserved both: At last, the German routed,
the Spaniard slain, the Kingdom quieted, and having overcome himself the
greatest of all, contemning the shadowy triumphs of the earth, being to receive
an immarcescible crown of God, he expired; leaving it uncertain whether he
lived and ruled more happily, or died more piously: He wrung tears from Envy
herself, who poursuing him living, condol'd him dead; He could go no further,
he had attained the highest: The spoils of death he gave to Sorbon, who living
animated Sorbon: In Sorbon whom he loved, he desired to lie, and to rest in her
bosom whom finding tottering, he took up, nay he only could have revived the
Genius of Sorbon, had it been like to faint: The foe enfeebled every where, he
only yielded to death, being deaths Conqueror, and Survivour of himself, while
he lives in the mouths, and minds of all men. Pray, and farewell.

He died 4th. of December 1642. the 57. year, and 3th. month of his Age.

This Epitaph gives a full compensation for the tartnes of the two former,
which were inserted expressly thereby to enfranchise the judgment of the
Reader, to discover the impartiality of the story, and make truth more
perspicuous, for it is a good rule in Logic, that Contraria juxta se posita
magis elucescunt, the confrontation of contraries makes things appear more
clearly; I know there is a saying in French, that vent coulis, a cranny wind is
more hurtful then an open; such are reproaches 'twixt praises; But let not the
Author of this story be mistaken that he intended to derogat (but only for the
ends above mentioned) from the merit of so brave a man whom his very enemies
admired for his fagacity, and cloquence, for his admirable forecast and
penetrating judgment, for the vivacity of his spirit, and quicknes of
apprehension, for his affiduity and indefatigable vigilance, for his excellent
address, and sinewy expressions, and dextrous way of dispatch, for his rare
policy and prudentiall parts, and lastly for the stupendous succes of his
counsels; These atributes, as it is no flattery to give him, so it were injury
to deny him; By these he made France formidable to the world, he made his
Master Arbiter of his own interests, an Avenger of all affronts, and supporter
of his Confederats; by these he got him three keys of invaluable advantage,
Brisack, Pignerol, and Perpignan, the first to enter Germany, the second Italy,
the third Spain at pleasure; By these he made him the most absolute and
independent Monark that ever reigned in that Kingdom, and freed him from all
fears to receive the law from his subjects ever hereafter.

But by ascribing so much to the Minister, let us not derogat from the Master,
who was as active in his way, and concurred to achieve all these things; We
have an axiom in Philosophy, that Sol et Homo generant Hominem; The Sun and man
beget man; the one by his Universal influx, being the fountain of heat, the
other by Natural organs; So we may say the King and Cardinal produced all
these actions, the one by the influence of his high power and Regal
authority, the other by his isntrumental activity.

The Cardinal de Richelieu's Arms were three Chevrons in a field argent, 2
plain and simple coat, therefore the more ancient; which Arms, with his Purple
Hat (which supported that great Crown, and made the Lillies flourish and swell
so many years) we will lay upon his Tomb, with this Distic for a final
farewell.

Aurea purpureo turgebant sceptra galero,
Crescebant triplici Lilia fulta Trabe.
And now it is high time for us to put a period to the whole work, both to the
History of this mighty Monark, as also to that of his great Minister; And
though their memory be not like the Rose, and other fading flowers, which smell
sweeter after they are plucked; yet the report of them shall ring in France, as
long as the rays of the Sun shall reverberat upon that fair Continent, and
albeit Ghirlands of Olive be improper for them, yet they deserve to have
Laurels upon their heads, and Palms of victory in their hands to all posterity.
