TO THE PARLIAMENT. The most humble Remonstrance of Sr. Balthazar Gerbier Knight.
Shows,

WHereas your humble Remonstrant after his long and incessant attendance on the
leisure of a Committee (once appointed by the Council of State) to receive such
of his tenders as do concern this Commonwealths service; and that he cannot
be persuaded that some of his said tenders may any longer remain with him
unreflectedon: He does therefore enbolden himself (in all due reverenee) to
present in this humble Remonstrance, a Summary abstract of the several Papers,
which by the foresaid Committees order he was enjoined to prepare for their
serious inspection, and by them to be reported unto the Council of State; that
so they might seasonably be offered unto the Parliament. And whereas, the
Council of States last Order, dated the 19 of October 1650. appointed that the
former Committee, should consider of your Remonstrants proposals; and make a
special report unto them of the state of the Flanders Debt: Your humble
Remonstrant, does therefore conceive that particular to be the most properest
for him to begin withal: And therefore humbly says thus much thereon, viz.

First, That as the Inhabitants of certain Cautionary The state of the Flanders
Debt consisting of seven millions of pounds.
Towns of Brabant and Flanders (as well as the several Heirs of such as were
in those times) the States of those parts, are obliged to make payment unto the
the English Nation of such moneys (together with its Use) as were lent unto
them by Queen Elizabeth: So in like manner, that the said Debt must of
necessity be claimed, at every change of Government as long as it is unpaid;
for that orherwaies the said Cautionary Towns, and the Debtors heirs will plead
a prescription, and consequently a Non-vallity.

Therefore Queen Elizabeth, King James, and the late King observed the same
necessary course; and caused their Agents to lay a public claim to the Debt.
And whereas the said Debtors apprehending the said Debt exorbitant increase by
reason of its being so long unpaid (when as they had cleared such like debts
which at the same time they had made with other Princes) they having been
legally summoned by late Mr. Trumball, the English Agent in those parts; And
finally by your humble Remonstrant, during his being Resident at Bruxels: Those
which aimed at the best husbanding of that Debt, did make a proposition by
secret friends of theirs, to come to a composition with the late King thereon;
and they were some of those who treated in secret with your humble Remonstrant,
about the putting off those Provinces into the protection of the English
Nation: And as it seems, the said propounders had some particular Interest
therein; for that they proffered unto your humble Remonstrant, no less then a
gratuity of 30000 pounds in case he could move Thirty thousand pounds gratuity
offered for a composition on the Flanders debt.
the late King to have condescended unto a favorable composition, on the
total; for that by reason of the many years, wherein the said moneys were lent
unto them, the non payment thereof (and the increase of the double Use) has
raised it to such an exorbitant Sum, that those Cautionary Towns, nor the
said States Heirs might perchance not be able to make it good; although the
said Towns, and the said States Heirs stand obliged to all perpetuity, to make
payment thereof: When as they neither can, nor will be born out of the non
payment of the same by their King, nor by any of his Governors in those parts;
for that they did formerly pass the said Debt in their accounts, to their said
King, who allowed thereof; and whereby the said Cautionary Towns, and the Heirs
of those States made it their own. In which regard, it happened that the late
Arch-Dutchesse The late Arch Duchesses declaration touching the Flanders Debt.
Isabel, (taking notice of the justice of the late kings claim) declared unto
the said Debtors, That they were bound to give a present satisfaction thereon
to the English Nation; for that she neither could nor would excuse them in the
contrary.

Now the exorbitant Sum whereunto the said Debt does at present amount (by
reason as aforesaid of the long forbearance, and of the Use upon Use) is Seven
Millions of pound; as it does appear by an exact Arethmetical calculation
thereon.

And whereas the renewing of the said claim is but a matter of for mality, of
no considerable charges, nor disadvantagious consequences to this State; For
that when as the said claim shall have been renewed, the same may as then, at
its own leisure press the Debtors to make payment thereof, or defer the same
as long as they shall think fitting.

Your humble Remonstrant has therefore so incessantly attended to give this
due account thereon; to the end, that the Parliament being truly informed
thereof, might as then do therein, as unto their great wisdom it should seem
best.

So likewise did your humble Remonstrant insert his humble proffer on this
particular, in the account which he was to give them, viz. That if so be the
Parliament (who in all its proceedings has manifested a matchless care, in
the heeding of all the rights which are due to the English Nation) would be
pleased to permit, that their Act (not inferior to the decrees of the Parthes
and Medes) allowing a certain proportion to such as shall disclose and recover
any concealed Debt, may stand in force, and extend it self as well to your
humble Remonstrant as to others; The Remonstrants request on the Flanders Debt.
who by their fidelity and zeal, have rendered themselves capable of the
Parliaments Justice and Favor; He might as then, to wit (after the claim of
the said Debt shall have been renewed) undertake (at his own cost and peril)
to procure a due satisfaction unto this State for the said Debt.

But in case the Parliament should not conceive the said Debt to come within
the Verge of concealed Debts (although your humble Remonstrant disclosed the
same; and that by his care and diligence the Original Bonds were brought unto
the Lord President of the Council of State: Your humble Remonstrant does
thereon submit himself to the sense of his The original Bonds secured by the
Remonstrants means.
betters; and cannot choose but again represent (as he formerly did) his
readiness to manifest unto any person in whom this State can best confide, the
necessary The Remonstrants offer concerning the Flanders Debt.
particulars for the said Debts recovery. And if such a one shall be thought
fit to accompany your humble Remonstrant unto Machlen in Brabant, he may be
both an Eye and Ear witness of your humble Remonstrants proceeding, in the
renewing of the said Debts claim in the high Court of Justice there and be
brought acquainted with those secret Persons, who once before proffered the
thirty thousand, pounds gratuity for a Composition; to the end that by their
means (in case they are as wise and wary now as they were then) the said
Debtors might be wrought into a fair composition for the capital with this
Commonwealth; since as above said, the State is in possession of the Original
Bonds.

And in this manner, all such advantages as the Debtors might make use of, to
prevent this Nation in its right to the said Debt, will be renewed; as also
their pleading that this Commonwealths silence therein has rendered the same
invalid; so likewise will it preserve this Commonwealths Title, and procure
against any one whosoever, that shall be found to be in possession of the said
Town.

Secondly, Whereas your humble Remonstrant did A French secret design agitated
in a Cabinet Council against the English by the means of the Port of Dunkirk.
during his late being in France, observe how that there was a secret design
much insisted upon, in the Cabinet Council concerning the Town and Port of
Dunkirk, in case their affairs, (which have been much imbroiled ever since)
should permit a breach with this Commonwealth, to wit; how that Harbor might
be made use of, especially the Channel, which in Dutch, is called the
Scheurken, to contain Squadrons of Men of War, as well as of fire and massonned
mine Ships, thence for to set upon the English Shiping at Sea; or, on the
Coasts, as well as into Ports and Havens of this Land: Nay, to make up as high
as London bridge (as Canutus the Dane once did) notwithstanding the
Block-houses, and several men of War which guarded the River: But also to make
use of the Massoned Mines in Ships, for to blow up that part of the Town, which
is adjacent to the River; in the same manner, as the Duke of Parma did at the
siege of Antwerp.

Whereon your humble Remonstrant had in those A former design to destroy the
Port of Dunkirk.
Papers (which were by him prepared for the Committees inspection) mentioned an
expedient which he was to have put in practice, during the last breach between
England* and Spain; whereby that Port of Dunkirk (as also the Channel, called
the Scheurken) might have been rendered incapable to receive any Vessels,
especially, such as might have proved destructive to their Christian neighbors;

The which he thinks fit now again to reiterate, together The Remonstrants
proffers concerning the Port of Dunktrk.
with his zealous proffers to endeavor the same at all time; when as this
Commonwealths service shall require it: The aforesaid expedients having in
former times been approved of by the then Cabinet Council, unto which the Lord
Belface was called: And they had at the same time been put in execution by your
humble Remonstrants direction, had not the Wars between England and Spain been
terminated whilst they were a preparing. So likewise the Massoned Mine Ships
were by your humble Remonstrant prepared, and would have taken the expected
effects on the Dyke of Rochel, had they been conducted thither by men who
minded actions more then discourse.

Thirdly, as your humble Remonstrant has observed The French and Hollanders
undermining of the English Cloth trade.
both in France and in Holland; That the French by their erecting of a Cloth
Manufacture at Zedan, and the practicing of the same in many parts of Holland;
the Hollanders especially have begotten such an esteem of their Clothes among
many Nations, as that in the very City of Paris, there are yearly vented more
then eight thousand packs of clothes: When by the transportation of
Fullers-earth (contrary to the Parliaments prohibiting the same) the English
cloath-trade is likely to be much impaired: A Spanish overture whereby the
Cloth trade may be made more worth to the English then the gold Mines are to
the Spanish.


Your humble Remonstrant hereon called to mind a secret overture, which had
been made by one Don Hennin (a Flemming by birth) one of the Secretaries for
the foreign Languages in Spain, during the late Kings being at Madrid; and
whereby the Cloathtrade might be made more worth to the English Nation then the
Golden, Mines ever were or can be to the Spaniards: Besides, that by the said
expedient, the Spanish Interest would be so considerably, and indisolvably fixed
to that of the English Nation, as that the said Spaniards should never engage,
or side with any other, on what consideration soever.

Now this being so great a concernment (and that the profit thereof would prove
matchless) when as The Remonstrants proffer on the Cloth trade.
it would prevent all other Nations in any of their designs against the
English Cloth Staple: Your humble Remonstrant, by the aforesaid Committees
appointment, did pen the state of that case, and proffers to render acceptable
service on that particular to the English Nation.

And proffered also to leave with this State certain The Remonstrants proffers
touching secret concernments.
secrets which had been by your humble Remonstrant concealed, in the same
manner, as they had been revealed, by the above mentioned, Don Hennin unto the
late Duke of Buckingham, by the which secrets, this Commonwealth might (at its
own opportunity) extend the power, and increase the wealth of the English
Nation beyond that of any People; and even make good a prediction which is
current in remote parts (among such men, who alas! have not yet the knowledge
of the true living God) Of the coming amongst them of a People with white
complexions, and flaxen hair, who shall possess their country; at which time,
its also related, that the very Leaves of the Trees shall be as pure Gold. All
which in case the said Don Hennin, might happily have conceived to be likely to
have been made good by the English Nation: Its no wonder that he pitched upon
the said Duke, to make the said discovery unto him. However, sure it was, that
the said Don Hennin was poisoned by a black Spanyard, for his having communed
with the said Duke thereon; and for his having manifested unto him such
particulars, whereby any Gentleman as shall set forth with an easy equipage,
shall not need to look after one Kingdom, nor any experimented Merchant with
the buying of Negros, nor Myne-masters with the heeding or preserving the lives
of such as work therein, but to aim at that which Kelly in Queen Elizabeth's
days, kept so close in his breast, as that the Qucen could not get ought out
of him thereon, save an imperfect relation: Nor shall any such undertakers need
to bend their course toward a sponken of river, and get up as far therein as a
third-fal off a torrent from the top of mountains* at the backside of which,
other Nations gather gold; wherewithal these shall no sooner have filled their
Bags, but that at the same time several Nations (whereof those of the West
Indian Company in Holland, are like to be of the number) will endeavor to make
toward them* and to dispossess them of their Rivolets, unless the
undertakers can carry a long with them so many Forts in their Ships, as may be
at once, and the self same time planted (as it were) to guard that River.

Don Hennins discoveries are in the first place so far beyond the known
platform of descriptions and discoveries gathered out of Books, and taken upon
common fame; as also of that which the famous Sr. Walter Raleigh, and
unfortunate Captain Cavendish intended, as (though both of them have been very
much traduced for that they were not upon Chim^ras, as the factious, which
thirsted at that worthy persons life,) well knew; and who have ever since
fortified several of their landing Ports, in their golden world.

The said secrets so discovered by Don Hennin, remained ever since with your
Remonstrant, who penned them even as Don Hennin declared them to the said Duke,
who would have proceeded to the said undertaking, had he not been slain at
Portsmouth.

Moreover* whereas the aforesaid undertaking, requires not a fleet, nor such
vast charges as may be conceived; so a private Gentleman with an ordinary
association (that could make up a stock of some thousands of pounds) may go
through therewith, without any venture of considerable loss; For as Merchants
are not to seek, in the providing against casualties, even by their custom to
ensure their Voyages, so likewise may such undertaking be secured.

Finally, Let it be granted, that men cannot be cautious nor wary enough in
making of objections, and Ifs? as the sickning of men and other casualties,
whereby Ships are enforced to return: Why as then Merchants full well know,
that the bare lading of some commodities, to serve as Ballast, might supply to
satisfy those Ifs, and to make up a Voyage.

And as your humble Remonstrant had just cause to conceal the said Don Hennins
overtures, ever since he was entrusted with them; yet was it not for want of an
Association within the circuit of Europe, who would gladly embrace such an
opportunity, to make to the attaining of that which most men desire; but that
in the first place, most men are as Saw-dust and Sand, which makes no good
mortar; that few can be trusted, and few do aim at Gods glory: And that in the
second, Your humble Remonstrant was moved merely by a true zeal to the English
Nation, amidst which, he has spent above thirty three years of his life: with
which your humble Remonstrant proffers to leave the secret of that undertaking,
on such easy and reasonable terms (for as much as concerns only himself and
his family) as may seem just to this Commonwealth: So likewise does he humbly
conceive, that on this States silence (which he shall take as a refusal
thereon) he has done his part; and that he still remains, as he ever was, a
free man born, and in their regard a second Colomba.

Fourthly, Your humble Remonstrant says, that The Remonstrants tenders as have
reference unto Credentals and Instructions concerning a party abroad.
having been required (from a great party abroad) to manifest unto this
Commonwealth, most certain secret concernments, the which are made apparent by
the contents of Credentials, and other Papers, which have a reference
thereunto; and the which have been entrusted unto your humble Remonstrant,
conditionally that he should give a speedy* and true return thereon, unto the
Party, from whom they originally proceed: He therefore has the more
incessantly attended, to quit himself on that particular; for that (as in the
first place) he could in no wise omit the same, in regard of the said parties
reflecting on this Commonwealth, and the consequence of that reflection; so
likewise in respect of the satisfaction which this Commonwealth might receive
therein, when as the truth and secret grounds of that parties ends should be
made so apparent, as that it must prove an impossibility for any man (on what
color or pretense soever) to hinder this Commonwealth from taking assured
Levels, on that said parties designs; either for the present, or future, on
such occasions as Providence should happen to lay before this State: So
likewise, in the third place, did your humble Remonstrant so urgently insist
thereon, to the end that whereas the said particulars may be manifested, in one
quarter of an hours time, it might not seem to be the more preposterous to
such a considerable party, that no account could be given in two years time* on
a business which was entrusted unto your humble Remonstrant, with the greatest
precaution that could be, as also on the greatest ties of secrecy, and on the
greatest score of confidence and credit: when as spies, counterfeits (and men
of small trust) have had acccesse. All which (as he humbly conceives) will plead
in his behalf, a sufficient harmless excuse, for his said incessant instances;
and his present reiteration thereof: when as he is also very well assured that
this Commonwealth has not had an account of the contents of those Credentals
by any other way; neither could certain advertisements, whereon the
preservation of the lives of eminent persons (which stand at the Helm of this
Commonwealth were concerned) come from a more considerable hand then that
which had signed the aforesaid credentials.

True it is, that there was a time taken to order one of your humble
Remonstrants Sons (who is now with the Lord) to uncyfer the said advertisement,
and thereon a Messenger was sent unto those whom it did concern; but there was
not so much time taken as to express such a well liking of the parties
affection, as might have served to prevent his reflecting on the Italian
saying, viz. Passato il periculo gabato il sancto; nor could one quarter of an
hours time (which was requisite to have perused the contents of the aforesaid
credentials) be set apart for the same; when as the said party has not ceased
to call for an account even until this present day? etc.

Your humble Remonstrant has also attended to tender, and to leave with the
Commonwealth several other public concernments, whereby other Nations
Several advantages to a State.
have strengthened and enriched themselves, as some of those whereby the
General States of the United Provinces did attract unto themselves, the
concourse of several Nations, as well as the stocks of very wealthy persons of
them, after they had expressed their mildness on the point of the Liberty of
Conscience; that they had manifested their readiness to grant Immunities, and
Privileges to Foreigners; the settling of a Free-trade, and the Imposing of
easy customs, which does ever attract Negotiants, and rectifieth diverse of
such as are somewhat more then ordinary inclined to defraud the Customers, and
their fellow Negotiants, by the falsification of Wares: And that as then those
States proceeded to settle those establishments, and to promote those means
whereby to make moneys to flow into the public Coffers, and in the Casshes of
all Negotiants. The which was so carefully minded by the said States, during
the time of William the old Prince of Orange, of Maurice, and of Frederick
Henry his brother* as that it was no wonder, if that Nation (notwithstanding
their long and bloody wars against the potent King of Spain, in whose coffers
gold and silver does daily and yearly spring and flow) became so mighty rich
during the time of their wars:

For that they at the first dash pitch^ on a main resolve, In what marner the
Dutch reduced their monyes.
whereby to reduce monyes unto so low a rate, as that they attained unto more
monyes at three and four per Cent. Use, then they well knew how to bestow:
Where as they having no great store of* Land (and the extent of their
jurisdictions consisting in a great part of Water) they could not pitch upon
any better course, then to employ their whole Stocks upon Merchandise, and by
the abundance of ready moneys, which they thus had at small Use, they became
the more capable of buying and selling at better rates then any other Nation
whatsoever: when as by their thirftinesse of feeding their Mariners, and by
the Manning of their Ships, with a less number of men (then any other Nation)
they have attained unto the best profit of the Commerce.

One of the maine expedients whereby they furthered the reducing of monyes (as
all experienced men know) was first, by the exterpating of all Lombards, and
forbidding of the excessive Usury of Brokers, such as those at present here
are, who make no conscience to take 30, 40, nay, more per Cent. Use; besides,
the horride customs of forfeitures: For as the Lombards (and such Brokers as
take 30, 40, and more per Cent. Use,) must needs also give excessive rates for
the Use of such stoks of monyes, whereby they furnish the necessities of men on
their pawns of Plate and Jewels; It was a very hard task for any negotiant to
raise monyes but at unreasonable rates.

A second expedient, whereby the reducing of monyes A second expedient whereby
moneys were reduced.
was furthered, was the practical establishment of a banck of payment; whereby
the credit of a negotiant (who had monyes in Banco) became so great, as that
all persons (as well Widows as Orphants) would trust him with their moneys;
whereby they were enabled to drive the greater trade, and to leave the more
considerable stock in the banck: And what a particular secret Revenue the
Magistrates procured unto the State from such a Banck, is not so easy an
Arcana Republicae, as to be discovered.

The third expedient for the reducing of monyes, A third expedient to reduce
moneys.
was effected by the practical establishment of Bancks of Loan, and of
Sale-offices in the chief Cities and Towns; whereby the traffic was
strengthened and increased; all needy persons were supplied and relieved, and
it drew unto such Towns (especially to the Markets ones) the confluence of all
Negotiants, for whose secret relief the said Bancks of Loan do also serve, and
prevent many Merchants from breaking; Besides that by them ready monyes are
provided for all those who make speedy returns of their Wares, and so redouble
their gains. In a word, by the means of such like Bancks, men may become rich
on warrantable principles.

As for that blessed thing called the Public Security Concerning public
security.
or Faith (that which secures all men in the making good their propriety) It
was by the aforesaid States endeavored by the practical settlement of a
general Record-office, by the which any proprietant whatsoever was secured in
his Inheritance, Purchasses, and Bargains; all cheats of several sails, double
transactions, and several morgages were prevented; and the which gave such a
firm assurance unto all men, as that each one strove to be owners in chief and
not tenants: And this expedient did likewise reduce monyes to a reasonable
rate; for that beside the general benefit which those States and Magistrates
obtained thereby, they also procured to themselves the applause and general
love of the People. And its observable, how that it is a custom amongst those
People to call the best of them by the name of Father: Nay, so will the meanest
man amongst them call their General, were he a Prince of an Imperial descent.

Moreover by the practical establishment of that general Record-office, those
States did in the space of How a vast stock of money and a constant yearly
revenue may be raised.
one six weeks get a vast stock of ready money into their Coffers, and a yearly
revenue of 40000. pounds, with such an applause of the people and its love, as
may be justly argued: For whereas they would otherwise have been constrained
to pay as great rates perchance as the English Lawyers, Scriveners, and
Ingrossers do exact of men for their Grecian-likegreat breast plate writing;
they were as then only to pay a very inconsiderate duty unto the said
Recordoffice.

And this the Commonwealth of England can do with the same applause of the
people, with the same advantages to themselves, and thereby attain unto
Millions of ready monyes, as well as unto a constant yearly Revenue of one
hundred and fifty thousand pounds, in lue of other duties.

Hereon your humble Remonstrant has written at large, and took a special
inspection into the same, that so he might be able to give a full and clear
account thereof; the which he was long since commanded to do, both by King
James and by the late King, viz. To study the truest and most advantageoust way
to further the same; so likewise, all the other aforementioned establishments,
whereby the Cities (where they may be so settled) would infallibly produce a
very considerable Revenue to the State.

Besides all which, your humble Remonstrant has also set down in writing, the
means whereby all Silken The advnatages concerning Silken manufactures.
Manufactures may be established here in England, which would prove to be a
gain of fifteen per Cent. in the hundred: So likewise the monyes which are
remitted by Bills of exchange into other parts would be kept in the Land; as
also many laborious people would thereby be put in a way of subsistence.

Moreover, as the refining of Salt can be performed The advantages of refining
Salt without fuel.
without the expense of Fuel, as one Swanenbuorgh does practice the same on
the coast of Grooninghen; the said expedient may be very beneficial unto this
State; especially, in a time of breach with the French, when as their Bay-salts
from the Isles of Olon, and Brouage should not be had, but at a second hand,
and not at eight shillings the Bushel, as it is had now; and that the French
policy of State, suffers the exportation thereof at such a rate, purposely to
attract Foreigners to their Ports; when as they cause their own Inhabitants to
pay four pounds sterling in the Bushel.

Now the said expedient of refining Salt might be set on foot in case the State
may deem it fitting to grant the like privileges unto the undertakers of it,
as the above mentioned Swanenbourgh has granted him by the States General.

Finally, although your humble Remonstrant has hereby no other particular
ends, save such as may be consistant with this Commonwealths Interest; and
that he also does not presume to trouble any particular member of Parliament,
or of the Council of State, with the addressing or promoting of this his last
Tender and summary account.

Yet he humbly conceives, that as they all (and evry one in particular) mind
the public good, that after his zeal shall be hereby manifested unto so many
of the Parliament, and of the Council of State, as this Remonstrance may be
humbly presented unto, it may rather by some of them in particular (or by all
of them in general) seem fitting to be reflected on by the whole body of the
Parliament; and that their sense and pleasure may be evidenced concerning the
same.

At least, your humble Remonstrant may justly promise himself, that this his
last diligence and endeavor, will argue a discharge in him, to have done as
much as possibly can be expected from him. And this is the Summary of your
humble Remonstrants Tenders, and his personal proffers, viz.

First, To endeavor by a present claim, to preserve the force and vallidity of
the Flanders Debt in its former Esse; as also to put any person, whom the
Parliament may confide in, into such a course as may recover the same, on such
a reasonable consideration to your humble Remonstrant, as the Parliament may in
Justice and Honor deem fit.

Secondly, To render any Seaport or Haven whatsoever incapable of prejudicing
this Nation, in case the same be thought fitting.

Thirdly, To make use of his best endeavors, at any time, wherein this State
shall find it expedient toward the advancing of that grand profit, which the
English Nation may make by the Cloth commodity.

Fourthly, To give a clear account of the contents, of such Credentials and
instructions as concern a great party abroad.

Fifthly, To prefer the Commonwealth of England before any Dominion whatsoever,
for to declare and leave with the same those particular secrets, which were
revealed by Don Hennin the Spanish Secretary; if so be the Parliament be
pleased to consider of them, and of your humble Remonstrant, in a just and
reasonable way.

Finally, to make good his willingness to contribute his best experience and
endeavors toward the promoting of any of those profitable and beneficial
establishments, which are mentioned in this his said Summary Remonstrance.

FINIS.
