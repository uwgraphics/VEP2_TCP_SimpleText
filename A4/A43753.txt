To all the Inhabitants of the Earth, this is sent as a Warning from the Lord,
who has been long grieved with a sinful and an adulterous generation; but
against the fullness of transgression has prepared vialls full of wrath to cast
upon the head of wicked and ungodly men.
Here is also the vain traditional Worship of both priest and people (in short)
plainly made manifest to all those that are not willing to remain in ignorance,
which for many years has overspread the whole world; but now is the son of
righteousness arising, which discovers all deceivers and deceivableness, and
causes the lowly meek and innocent to understand wisdom.
Written by a servant of the Lord, who is known to you by the name of John
Higgins.
I Whom the Lord has called out amongst you, and redeemed me from the
abominations that is committed amongst you, and has set me as a sign and a
wonder, and my name is become a reproach in the mouths of fools and children,
and am looked upon as one unto whom some strange thing had happened, and am
despised and rejected by those that were my companions in wickedness and
mischief, in the days wherein I walked according to the course of this world:
But before the strength of sin was perfected in me, the Lord in the riches of
his love called me, and plucked me as a brand out of the fire, yea the goodness
of God was so, that oftentimes (though young in years when I was in the ways
of sin and evil) the witness of God in my own conscience accused, and let me
see the evil of my ways, and then my own heart condemned me in secret, which
caused me many times to mourn and walk sadly in the sensible feeling of the
Lords just judgment in my heart and conscience against the evil of my ways,
though not so wicked and common in all gross sins as many of my familiers
were, yet was I not free from fear and torment in my own heart: And in this
estate I went often to the place called the Church, thinking thereby to get
peace in my own heart, and by the knowledge of God I thought there to find; but
from thence I came mourning and troubled in spirit, because in that which is
called good duties I found no peace, nor satisfaction to the oppressed in me,
and here I witnessed truly that sin was to me a burden; so that many times I
went apart into the fields to pray and mourn in secret, desiring nothing more
then the knowledge of the only true God which saves from sin, for the want of
which was my sorrow: so after a time in this condition, the Lord heard the true
desires, and raised a swift witness in me, that the ways of man were evil
continually, and that self must be denied, and a cross to it must be borne, and
so the life of Christ Jesus was manifest unto me, which being known and
received, redemption from sin and salvation from condemnation was witnessed
according to the measure of Faith in Christ the Light, by which sin is made
manifest; so the knowledge of the pure God was revealed, (even contrary to the
imaginations of man in the sensual wisdom) and he being known and his
judgments received, the hard heart is broken and the darkness expelled, and
his fear which is a shield against sin is witnessed, whereby the heart is kept
pure and clean in his sight, and here to stand a witness for God, against all
that talk of his name and fear, but know not the life and strength thereof.

And now has the Lord opened my mouth, to declare in faithfullness and truth
the things which I have seen, and am a witness against; even the great
abominations that is committed amongst you Inhabitants of England, the sound of
which rings into other Countries, and your lewdness does exceed many other
places, and your sins are more in number then the sins of Sodom, or many other
places which the Lord has overthrown for their wickedness, because they
repented not, but refused to know the Lord: Therefore harken and consider, for
assuredly the Lord has a controversy against you, because there is no
knowledge of God amongst you, but altogether walking in vanity and in
uncleanness, for your young men are wild and wanton, whose minds runs after
women and strong drink, and the aged men and women are living and delighting
themselves in vanity and lewdness, even the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye and the pride of life; so that the knowledge of God is even rejected, and
oppression, covetousness, and deceitful dealing is received and exalted
amongst you, and much of the Creatures of the Lord is destroyed amongst you,
through the lust and excess, and that abominable sin of drunkenness you are
highly guilty of, and lyeing, and swearing, and pride, and grievous exaction in
your buying and selling is found amongst you, especially in a time of quick
tradeing, and through the abundance of this unrighteous gain and ease in the
flesh, you are grown gross and fat, that you are even as the Beasts that is
fitted for the slaughter. And this is not the number of thy transgressions, but
you are set against the Lord, and being heart-blind you know it not, neither
desire the knowledge of his ways, but despitefully use them that are sent
amongst you, for several times has the Lord brought me amongst you to bear
witness against you sin, and idolatrous worship, and once was I hailed out of
your Synagogue, and once beaten in your streets, and often stoned and mocked,
with my friends and brethren with me; yea all this is done, and few there be
that lay it to heart; and because judgment is not executed upon you spedilie,
therefore your hearts are bent to do wickedlie, but assuredly the day of the
Lord is at hand, wherein all these things will be brought to your remembrance,
and your own hearts and consciences shall condemn you in that day, when he
brings his judgment near unto you, for he has long born your sins, and given
you rest and fruitful seasons, and his goodness has not been restrained from
you, but in all this you have not known him, but his grace and mercy herein
has been turned into wantonness, and to the lust and liberty of the flesh.

Woe, Woe, to all drunkards, for the day will come, wherein the Wine and the
strong drink shall be restrained, then shall they weep and houle for thirst and
not be satisfied, and woe unto all you whose delight and life is in any
creature, for the Lord has determined to make the earth empty and desolate,
and all the glory of man to deface; for verily I have heard from the Lord a
voice of terrible judgment, which will make all the Inhabitants of the earth
to fear and tremble, for the Lord in his judgment will be known, because in
his mercy man knows him not; therefore repent, repent whilst his mercy is,
before the day of desolation, and misery come.

Then woe unto you who have been the teachers of this people, who for filthy
lucre have deceived their souls, teaching for doctrine the traditions of men,
daubing the people with fair words, because they put into your mouths, but he
that does not you even prepare war against him, and peace you say to the rich,
and judgment to the poor in spirit, and so the word is not divided aright, but
truth is turned backward for the ways of unrighteousness, and you through your
learning and arts, have been idolized many days, but now your flattery is
seen, and your learning is come to naught, and your unrighteousness will be
made manifest to the eyes of al people that have been deceived therevvith, and
all your righteousness and unrighteousness is sin in the sight of God, and your
revvard shall be accordingly.

Therefore all, both priest and people, consider of your ways, and amend your
lives, for verily the Lord will not be mocked although for a time he may be
silent, for all your assemblies and pretended worship is abominable in the
sight of God, whilst you continue in the abominations of the heathen, and all
your performances is but the tradition of men, perfomed in a customary way, in
ignorance of the knowledge of the living God, whom you say you serve, but the
wild scornful nature knows not the Lord of glory, and how can you serve him
whom you know not, yet are you nourishing your hearts in that which the blind
guides teaches you to observe, thinking thereby to find acceptance with the
Lord, but it is all polluted.

And now as concerning that which you call the ordinances of God, and the
order in your Church; now see from whom you have your exampel, for it is
altogether contrary to the practice of the Servants of the Lord in all
generations the Scripture of truth bearing testimony to what I say, and
thereby let your doctrines be tried: and first, what command or example do you
think you have for sprinkling little childern, calling that baptism, or an
entrance into the christian Church etc. And if you would go to the vvritings
of the Apostles for proof for this practice, it is not there to be found,
neither was it ever their practice, but it is that which by the Pope and the
Popish affected Priests was ordained, and by such it is upheld to this day,
through the ignorance that is yet remaining in the earth; but this is known and
confessed, that water baptism was once the administration of John, who bare
witness to the true Christ, and said, that is the true Christ which enlightneth
every man that comes into the world, who by his death and resurrection put an
end to all that stood in the outward Covenant, he being the substance of all
types and shadows, who said henceforth is the Father worshipped in spirit and in
truth; but you are so far from the power and life of that administration, that
you are not in the true form and manner of it, though you falsely say the
Scripture is your rule, and the Apostles practice your example, but sprinking
of children was never the practice of the Apostles, but the inventions of the
erroneous spirit.

And as concerning your practice singing in of David's Psalms, prayers and
Prophesies in rhyme and meeter, saying let us sing to the praise and glory of
God such a Psalm, then does all the multitude sing after the Priest, when
paradventure there is many drunkards, and swearers, and adulterers, and
fighters, and proud persons, singing all with a voice they are not puffed in
mind, but as harmless as a weaned child, and such like words is uttered in the
blasphemous spirit without an understanding, in the Antichristian ignorance;
so that this is abomination to the Lord, and not to his praise; but David being
as a weaned child, even harmless and innocent, he could sing to the praise of
the Lord, with an understanding according as the spirit gave him utterance, and
that is owned by the children of the Lord, and approved of in the light of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

And now what example is there for Priests to require, or people to give them
so much a year, even the tenth part (or near) of the increase of the fields,
and of the labor of themselves, and the labor of their cattle, for preaching
the traditions of men, upon the first day of the week; through which
unrighteous gain, they are at ease in the lust and liberty of the flesh, being
thereby mantained, with their wives and children, in all superfluity and
gorgeous apparel, without laboring in the creation, bearing rule by their
m^^ns, as it was in the days of Jeremah, Chap. 5. and the two last verses; so
that this practice is also contrary to the Apostles, it being that which the
Prophets of the Lord always cried against, as you may read Isa. the 56.11.
Micah 3.11. so that for this example there is the practice of the false
Prophets, and not the practice of the true Prophets and Apostle; but by them
such was ever cried out against^

And now I exhort all in the fear of the Lord God, to mind the light of Christ
Jesus in your consciences, making manifect all unrighteousness, and condemning
you in your own hearts for all the evil that you are exercised in, and turn
aside from following of blind guides, even such as go in the error of Balam for
gifts and rewards, and in the steps of the false Prophets of Israel, who
studied and divined for money, seeking their gain from their quarter, etc. And
although they may tell you there is salvation in Christ that dyed at Jerusalem,
with many other fair words, spoken from an ayry spirit, but this I say that
their words and your belief so long as sin regius, will be little worth in the
day of judgment, for he that is not led by the same spirit as he was, is none
of his, and all drunkards and swearers, and proud and lustful ones are
excluded, and for ever condemned by him, and the manifestation of his spirit in
the heart and conscience will accuse eternally; therefore silence all vain
talkers, and hirelings, and deceivers, who feed your selves and not the flock,
against whom the Lord has a great controversy, and he will plead with you in
Judgment.

Then shall all the earth know that the Lord sends not his message by the
learned, wise and prudent men of this generation, who would ^^clude all others
from the ministry; and these be they that follow the error of Balaam, who
erred in going after gifts and rewards; and this is the error of the Priests
and false Prophets in these days, who for love of the reward speaks peace,
where the judgment of the Lord is to rest; so that this is not the Gospel of
Christ which they declare, for that is the same now as ever it was, not of man,
nor by the will of man, but by the will of God; even so are the ministers
thereof called and chosen according to his will, and not the will of man, and
we do know that the Lord has chosen the weak and despised of this world to
confound the strong and mighty in their own wisdom; and herein is the power of
the Lord manifested, praises be to his name for ever: And in all their learning
they are corrupted, and the knowledge of the languages, of Hebrew Gerek and
Latin, (which they call the original) is nothing worth as par^^^ing to the
knowledge of God; but the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ is now made manifest,
which is the original of all truth and righteousness, and by it the mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven is revealed, and all unrighteous prctises of men are
by it discovered, and it searches and knows all things, and without it none
knows the Lord as he is.

Therefore all people come down to the manifestation of that spirit in your own
hearts and consciences, which will give you the knowledge of sin, and every
evil way, and it will discover the very thoughts and intents of the heart, yea
all the evil lustful desires in the heart of man, are by it made manifest and
condemned; and as faithful obedience unto it is yielded, and that denied which
by it is manifest to be evil, sin comes to be destroyed, and the knowledge of
God comes to be revealed in and by Christ Jesus, who has enlightened every man
that comes into the world, giving unto all men a manifestation of his spirit,
that in the day of judgment all might be left without excuse; so that all they
that believe in the light and follow it, shall not abide in darkness nor come
under condemnation, but all that turn from that light of Christ in the
conscience abides in darkness, and in sin, and under condemnation, whatever
their profession is, and none shall ever be justified before God, who are
condemned in their own hearts and consciences by the light of Christ Jesus; who
is one with the Father, and answers to him in judgment, and in mercy as he is
followed; and whosoever will fellow the light of Christ in the conscience, must
deny themselves, and bear a cross to their own wills, and all men's will in
whatsoever is thereby made manifest to be contrary to God; for man being in the
transgression, this has the Lord appointed and ordained to guide and direct
man out of sin and transgression, if ever he be restored into the Image of God
again; so that man in denying the light of Christ, remains in sin, and by the
light is eternally condemned in sin, being under the chain of darkness, with
the damned spirits that rules the children of disobedience; he that reads let
him understand.

Now in the fear of the Lord, I warn you all that keep Beer, or Ale, or Wine
to, sell that you let no man have drink till he be drunk (as hitherto you have
done) for in so doing the Lord will not hold you guiltless, and all your gain
and profit thereby is even cursed of the Lord; and beside this I know, and you
are also sensible of it, that when the creature is overcome with drink, then he
is fit and ready with a little temptation to act uncleanness with women, and
to swear and lie, and quarrel, and fight to the abuse of himself, and the
bodies of others, and more such like evil practices is thereby committed
amongst you; therefore fear, fear the dreadful God, who takes an accont of all
these abominations.

And all you that are called Ranters, assuredly the Lord will enter into
judgment with you, for all your whoredom, pride, and drunkenness, and all
uncleanness, though in the presumption of your spirits, you say you know no
evil that you do in these or the like practices, yet the living God will make
you know by his judgments that you are the most filthyest that lives amongst
men, and the manifestation of Gods spirit in your own consciences will for ever
condemn you, and will be unto you as an everlasting burning, except you repent.

And all you young men, amonst whom I had my conversation in the days past,
consider for what end the Lord created you, and how you live in wantonness,
and in pleasure, and lust, and drunkenness, and all the fruits of the flesh,
for which you were not created, but he that created you and gave you life, it
was to serve him, the Lord of glory, and not your own lusts and pleasures; and
all know assuredly that you are under the power of the Lord, who will cast
forth his fury as a flood, which will make all ungodly ones to languish and be
afraid, when he thunders forth his judgments upon all the world of ungodly.

And herein have I cleared my conscience toward you in plainness and truth,
making known unto you, that which the Lord by his spirit has made known unto
me concerning you. Written at Dover in Kent, in the first Month of the year
of the worlds account, 1658. I. H.
