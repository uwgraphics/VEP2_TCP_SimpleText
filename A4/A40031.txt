LONDON, (...) for Nicholas T(...)

To the READER.
Courteous Reader,
AMongst other Treatises of this deceased Author, of which, in their due time,
we intend to make thee partaker, we have, in the first place, made choice of
this, as well in some measure to keep our word with thee, as also to stay thy
expectation till other things can be made ready. We intend not to spend time
either in the commendation of It or the Author, being w^ll assured that our
words will not, where the matter it self is (...) capable to, satisfy therein
the judicious Reader. Only let (...) say thus much, that though the general
Subject of this Book (...) Dialling, yet it is handled in a way which no man
whosoever, that we know of, has hitherto fully traced. For by it thou will
see, that the representing the true Hour by the shadow made by the Axis of the
World is but one of those infinite ways which may be invented, and that it is
as possible to do the same thing by the shadow of the Axis of one of the
vertical Circles, and by the projection of one Ellipsis upon a plain, supply
the place of all the Parallels comprehended within the Tropicks. It Is true,
that Mr. Va^lezard, a learned Mathematician, we think yet living in France,
has some years since published a short Treatise in that Language, in which he
shew^th by the projection of an Ellipsis upon the plain of the Horizon, and by
the help of an upright moveable style to find the He^re and Azimuth, with some
other uses of the same. But this Treatise of our Author is very different from
that, and most of the things here handled, such as are not appliable to his,
and in themselves wholly new.

In the next place, if it shall seem strange to any that amongst other things,
as well of this, as of different natures, which we intend shortly to Publish;
we begin first with this of Dialling (a Subject upon which something too has
already been published by our Author, and from whence some might perhaps take
occasion to carp at him, as either unable for other things, or too much busied
in this) we desire them first to con^^der how difficult this Subject has been
thought by the (...), and withal what large Volumes have been writ by some of
the best rank of later Mathematicians, (such were Clavius, Maigran, and others)
and then compare their ways with what they shall here and hereafter (God
willing) find in our Author, and we doubt not, but they will be forced to
yield him it this honor, to have made that Art, in all the Cases of it, and
all Circumstances thereunto belonging, more easy and expedite both in the
Understanding and Practice, and with much more brevity than any that have gone
before him either of our own or other Nations.

Lastly, we advertize thee ( Reader) that our Author, in regard of his great
and long infirmities, could not fit either this, or any other of his Treatises
for the Press, as he desired and intended; and therefore they must needs want
much of that accomplishment which otherwise they would have had. But we hope,
notwithstanding, thou will find so much of worth in them as they now are,
whereby thou will judge them (as we do) fitter to be made public, then wholly
suppressed.

ELLIPTICAL OR AZIMVTHAL Horologiography. Of the Elliptical Dial, whose Index
stands perpendicular to the plain: How to draw and divide the Ellipsis upon an
Horizontal plain, or any other plain that declineth not.
1.LEt the two right lines B C and A D, cut each other at right angles in A.
Then making A C or A B as a Radius, let A D be the Right Sine of the Poles
elevation above the plain; and make up the Rectangled Parallelogram B E F C,
and continue it further to G and H.

2. Divide the Radius A C into the Sines of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 gr. at a b c d
e, which stand for the six equal hours: ^o that A a may be the Sine of one
hour, A b of two hours, A c of three hours, A d, A e of four and five
hours. And in the same sort divide the other lines which are equal to A C,
namely D F, A B, D E, into the same parts, at a b c d e, and at l m n o p: and
draw the parallel lines a a, b b, etc. l l, m m, etc.

Then taking A D, or C F, or B E, for a Radius, set on again the Sines of the
six equal hours from B and C, at f g h i k, and as many as shall be needful
on the other side, at q r s: and draw the parallel lines f f, g g, etc. and q
q, r r, etc.

These lines thus crossing one another will make small Parallelograms, which
will show both where the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and where to be divided. For,

3. First, If a curved line be begun at D or 12, and carried both ways
diagonally through the succeeding Parallelograms, the same line shall be the
Ellipsis required. Thus you see it carried from D to 11, from 11 to 10, from 10
to 9, and so through the successive opposite angles of the following
Parallelograms, at 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. And on the other side in the same manner,
from D, diagonally through 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This line thus regularly
described without angles, and extravagant inordinate flexures, is the Ellipsis
here intended.

Secondly, If from the center A, through each of the angular points in the
small Parallelograms, certain short lines be drawn, (as in the figure you see
done at 11, 10, 9, etc. and at 1, 2, 3, etc.) the same lines shall be the
requisite horary divisions of the Elliptical line.

4. If these divisions into single hours shall not be enough, but that more
exactness is required, into halves and quarters; then must you (besides the
Sines of whole hours at a, b, etc. l, m, etc.) put in the right Sines of the
intermediate halves and quarters of the equal hours; which will be easy to
do by the former directions.

SECT. I. Of the Elliptical Dial, where the Index stands perpendicular to the
Plain: How to draw it for an Horizontal Plain, or any other Plain that
declineth not.
BEcause here is no declination supposed, therefore the draught will be the
more easy.

1. Make B C for the longer Diameter of your Ellipsis, and count one half of
it, that is A B or A C as the Radius, and through the point A, draw an infinite
line (as D E) at right angles to B C. Then for the shorter Diameter, you must
consider the elevation of the Pole above your plain. Look therefore to make A
D or A E equal to the Sine of the Poles elevation, which Sine must be
estimated to the Radius A B. Thus you have the two extreme diameters.

2. Through the four points D B E C you may describe the Ellipsis, either by
Elliptical Compasses, or by finding many points through which it is to pass:
for effecting which there are multitudes of ways prescribed.

One may be this. Describe two Circles upon the two extreme Diameters B C and D
E. Divide them both into any like parts, as B f h n p q C, and V i k E o t X;
and from each couple of those like divisions (as f and i) draw f g i g, (the
first parallel to A n, the second parallel to A B) cutting each other at right
angles in g, so the point g shall be one of the points through which the
Ellipsis is to be described. In the same manner, from h and k must be drawn two
lines concurring at right angles in m, which will therefore be another point
through which the Ellipsis must pass. So again from p and o, t and q, lines
are to be drawn, concurring at right angles in s and r, which are two other
points of passage for the Ellipsis. After this manner may the other half B D C
be described.



How to divide the Ellipsis into its requisite parts.
1. If the parts B f h n p q C were all equal, and 12 of them in number, then
would the points g m, etc. be the hour points. And accordingly, if those
hours were subdivided into equal halves and quarters, etc. there would be
found points for the halves and quarters, etc. of the hours. And if the
Ellipsis be first drawn, then the exterior Circle it self by lines issuing
out of f h p q, drawn parallel to A n) will divide the Ellipsis: or, where
these lines cut it more obliquely (as at g and r, etc.) there the lesser
Circles equal parts (at i and t, etc.) will cut the same Ellipsis at more
right angles, so that one of them may help the other in this division.

2. Or, If the quadrants B n C, or V E X (or of any other Circle described upon
the center A) were divided into Horizontall Spaces, such as are proper for this
Dial (as you see them done upon the quadrants B y C) and a Ruler laid from the
center A did transfer those divisions into the Ellipsis (as is done upon that
half of it which is noted with B D C) this division would be the same with the
former.

The proportion whereby to make the Table of Horizontall Spaces for this
Ellipsis, is inverse to that which is for common Horizontall Dials: thus,

As the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain, Is to the Radius;

So is the Tangent of 15 gr. 30, 45, etc.

To the Tangent of the spaces of every hour from 12, upon the plain whereon
the Ellipsis is described.

And according to these spaces must every hour be set on from n or y toward B
or C.

How to make the Zodiac, or days of the year, whereby the Ellipsis and Index
are to be set in a right position, that they may daily stand true to show the
hour.
Whether the 12 Signs or the 12 Months be fittest for use, is left to every
man's choice. Bu^ in both these it is required that the declinations due to the
Signs or Days be known, because these are to be inscribed by them. So that
now it only remains to be showed what kind of Scale that must be, out of which
the foresaid Declinations are to be taken.

In general, the Scale must be a Scale of Natural Tangents.

In particular, there are these two Rules, one of which will with due
convenience serve for all kinds of Latitudes, or elevations. You may use which
is most suitable to your purpose.



The first for great Latitudes. Make the lesser semidiameter A D or A E, to be
a Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain; and that Scale is the Scale
of Tangents out of which the Declinations (before mentioned) must be taken.

The second for lesser Latitudes. To the Radius B A, find the Cosine of the
plains latitude or elevation; and make that Cosine a Radius, or Tangent of 45
gr. and this will be the same Scale with the former*

By these ways the Declinations of these two Tables (one for the Signs, the
other for the Days of the Months) may be inserted from the Equinoctial line,
or middle of the Scale, by the graduations of such a Tangent line as is before
mentioned.

Or if it be required rather to set them on by a Decimal Scale equally divided,
then must the Tangents of these Declinations (here specified) be used; and the
Decimal Scale must be equal to the Cosine of the plains Latitude, which
Cosine must be limited to B A, the greater Radius of the Ellipsis. And for
this purpose here are two Tables more which do express the said Tangents.

Another way to describe and divide the same Zodiac, or Scale of Months.
The former descriptions do suppose that the yearly course of the Sun is to be
set in a straight Scale, in which the parts nearest to the two Tropicks will be
exceeding close together; and those at the Aequinoctiall or middle part of the
Scale will be wide. But if it shall better be liked that the parts should stand
distinctly one from the other; it will then be most expedient, First, to limit
out the whole length of the Scale: then upon that length (as a diameter) to
describe a Circle, and to divide it as is here under showed.

How to divide the Annual Circle into its requisite parts.
You are first to divide the Circle (it self, or one equal to it) into 360
equal degrees, and by them to divide the said Circle into such unequal parts
as the numbers of degrees and minutes expressed in the Tables will require. The
two Tables are the Right Ascensions of such parts of the Ecliptic as are due to
the Suns place or Declination, in any of the Signs, or of any days of the 12
months. The Tables are here placed. The manner of dividing the Circle is the
same with other like things of this kind.

The beginning of the equal parts or degrees, must be upon that middle
Diameter of the Circle, which lies parallel to the two six a clock lines, or
perpendicular to the twelve a clock line.

The best manner of dividing the Circle is as in the preceding figure,
especially if the fiduciall Circle be cut through with small divisions, that so
the intersections may be the more discernable, and the Circle more
distinguishable from the rest; and more clear from mistakes.

Concerning the Index.
The Index must stand perpendicular to the plain, and must, according to the
time of the year, be nearer or further from the Ellipsis.

Now, Whether the Index should move upon the plate lying still, or the
elliptical plate move toward the Index fixed upon another plate, must be left
to every man's judgment and best liking. But the mover with its peculiar Index
(called here the Zodiacall Index) must move according to the length of the
plains Meridian line, either in it, or parallel to it, always so that the
fiduciall edge of the Dials Index may ever stand in the Meridian line.

But if to this Ellipticall Dial it be thought fit to join an ordinary
Horizontal Dial (fitted to the Elevation of the Pole above the plain) that so
it may set it self true North and South, which by this double kind of Dial
it will do; for the hours in both Dials will never agree to be the same till
it stand right, and the best time for setting it, is when the Sun is in the
East or West Azimuth, the worst time is at Noon: then the common Horizontal
Dial may be the standing plate, the Index of the Ellipsis being fixed to it,
the elliptical plate may move too and fro upon the horizontal fixed plate,
according to the graduations of the Zodiac.

Of the place for the Suns Annual course or Zodiac.
Whichsoever of the two (the Ellipsis or Index) is moveable or fixed, it
matters not. In both ways it is necessary to set the Zodiac right, which must
thus be done.

Let the fiduciall edge of the Index be placed exactly in the center of the
Ellipsis. And being there set, let the place of the line or thread (or whatever
it be that serves for the Zodiacall Index) be marked upon the standing plate.
Then through that mark or point draw a straight line parallel to the line of
the two sixes, or perpendicular to the line of twelve. The same line is to be
esteemed for the Aequinoctiall: and from thence are all the parts of the Scale
(or Circle) to be insctibed by help of the former Tables.

The Uses of the Elliptical Dial.
The Index and Ellipsis being used alone, and set to their true distance, by
the help of the Zodiac, the Ellipsis it self with its upright Index, will show
the true hour of the day.

But it is supposed hitherto, that the plain be either direct, looking full
North or South, or else Horizontal: and in every such plain, there must be
drawn the Meridian line of the place or plain, which in direct flats are one
and the same. And according to the Coast of this Meridian line must the moving
or sliding be, as also the line of 12 upon the Ellipsis must lie in or parallel
to it.

This way therefore requires, first, a Meridian line to be drawn, whereby to
place the Ellipsis. And in all direct plains the Meridian line is the same with
the Vertical line of the plain.

But if to this Elliptical Dial, be adjoined a common Horizontal Dial with an
Axis, then there needs no finding of a Meridian line before hand, because they
two betwixt them will find one, and consequently will place themselves in a
true position. Only with this proviso, that if the plain be not Horizontal, it
must yet be such as looks directly North or South. This was intimated before.

There may other uses be made of it, if it have other Scales adjoined to the
Zodiac.
1. If a Tangent line of 23 gr. be inscribed according to the length of the
Zodiac, then when the situation of the Ellipsis to the Index is fitted, the
Zodiacal Index will show (upon this Tangent Scale) the Suns Declination.

2. In the 11 page there are two Rules given whereby to find that Scale of
Tangents out of which the Zodiacal Scale is to be divided. If then out of that
Scale of Tangents so found and limited, you take the Co-tangent of your
Latitude, and divide that length as a Radius or whole line of Sines into hours
and parts of hours, and put in so many of them as will reach the Suns greatest
Declination, or the length of the Zodiac both ways from the Equinoctial; then
the former rectification of the Zodiacal Index to the day of the month or Suns
place, will perfectly show (in this Scale, and for that Latitude to which all
the work is made) the Ascensional difference, with what depends thereon:
namely, the length of the Day and Night, and the time of Sun Rising and Setting.

3. The Dial being fixed in a true position, the Place or Coast of the Sun
rising and setting upon the plain, may be discerned in the heavens. For when
the Ellipsis is rectified, and the time of the Sun rising or setting is known
(as before) then with your eye project the fiduciall edge of the upright Index
upon that time of Sun rising or setting counted in the Ellipsis, and the same
edge will show in the heavens whereabout the Sun will ascend or descend upon
the plain. That is, it shows the Amplitude of Sun rising upon the plain.

1. Note, That if the plain be Horizontall, then the two last Uses serve for
the place where a man lives. But if the plain be not Horizontal, then it serves
not for the place, but is proper to the plain it self, or to that Horizon or
Latitude which the plain represents, according as they are set down in the
former Rules: because things are done to the plains Latitude, and not to the
places. 2. Note again, that if upon plain^ that are not Horizontal, you would
yet have them (to show the second of these last preceding conclusions, namely,)
to show the time of Sun rising or setting for the place in which you are, and
not for the plains, then must you take (not the Co-tangent of the plains
Latitude, but) the Co-tangent of the Latitude of the place, just as you did in
the Horizontall plain, and then the Zodiacal Index being rectified will effect
the thing required for the place, and not for the plain. 3. Note, that both in
the Horizontal and the other plains, there may be a peculiar Scale put, either
for the Amplitude proper to those plains, or else for the Amplitude proper to
the place, if a Table of Amplitudes be computed for either of them, by this
proportion.
As the Radius, to the Sine of 1, 2, 3, etc. or 5, 10, 15, etc. degr. of
Amplitude;

So the Cosine of the poles elevation, To the Sine of the competent
declination:

And then by the said competent declination (taken in the Scale of Tangents of
23 equal to the half Zodiac) the forenamed Amplitudes be inscribed. Or having
the Declinations, you may look out their Tangents in the Canon, by which
Tangents the said Amplitudes may be inferred with help of the Decimall Scale
made to the Cosine of the plains Latitude, as was before mentioned.

The Amplitudes proper to the plain are of no great use, unless the plain do
justly represent the Horizon of some known place, whose Amplitude you desire to
be acquainted withal. I have therefore here added a particular Table belonging
to the Latitude of London 51 gr. 30 min. that by it the said Amplitudes may be
inserted into such direct Recliners and Incliners as shall any way stand in the
said Latitude.

So far of this Elliptical Dial, as it is to be described upon any direct plain
which lies under the same Meridian with the Meridian of the place, and which
declineth not from it.

SECT. II. How to frame the Elliptical Dial to other Plains which are not
direct but declining: To an Index that stands perpendicular to the plain.
IT is not here to be enquired whether the plain declining, be erect or
leaning; for one rule serves both these kinds. But then it must first be
supposed, that the plains situation is in all respects known, how much and
which way it declines and reclines or inclines.

Secondly, These three things must further be found (either by calculation or
otherwise) namely, 1. The Poles elevation above the plain. 2. The plains
difference of Longitude. 3. The departure of the substylar (which is the plains
proper Meridian) from the Vertical line of the plain.


These are pre-requisites to that which comes after, in which you must proceed
by the following directions.

How to limit and draw the Ellipsis.
Having the substylar or proper Meridian drawn upon the plain, in its true
position, and also knowing the elevation of the Pole above the plain, you may,
upon the substylar line, set out your shorter diameter, and on a line drawn
perpendicular thereto, you may set off the longer diameter, in this proportion:
Let the longer Diameter be as the Radius, the shorter as the Sine of the plains
Latitude taken to the same Radius. Or, the longer semidiameter may be the
Radius, and the shorter semidiameter must then be the Sine of the elevation of
the Pole above the plain.

Upon these two extreme diameters thus limited, may the Ellipsis be described
with Elliptical Compasses. Or otherwise it may be done by two Circles, the one
circumscribed, the other inscribed, both divided into like parts, and so points
found through which the Ellipsis is to pass, as in the former direct plains
was prescribed, and through those points the Ellipsis may, with a steadfast hand
be described. In right Horizons or Polar plains there will be no Ellipsis at
all, but it vanishes into a straight line only.

How to divide the Ellipsis into such requisite parts as the plain shall
require.
If you should put in the hours proper to the plain there will be no
difficulty, for then the substilar being taken for the line of 12, the hours
must be drawn as before was showed in direct plains. For in this case the Dial
is Horizontal, showing the hour of the day to all places that lie under that
Meridian under which the plain it self lies* But

If you would put in the hours of the place (as most frequently is desired)
then you are to work (for the division of the Ellipsis) either by calculation
or by protraction. If you calculate for the Ellipsis, you must first form all
the angles at the Pole as the manner is in these kinds of Dials: Then you are
to invert the terms of proportion from the common way of calculating ordinary
Dials, and say thus:

As the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain, Is to the Radius;

So is the Tangent of each angle at the Pole, To the Tangent of the angular
distances of all the hours from the substylar line of the plain.



Supposing therefore that you had your Ellipsis before described, and the
substilar line set off from the plains Vertical line in its true position, you
may from that substylar line (and by the horary spaces found by calculation)
set in every hour point into the Ellipsis, by help of any Circle described
upon the center A. As you see here are two Circles, the circumscribed and the
inscribed, either of which, or any other circle else, will serve to prick on
the hours by. The hour points are here set upon the circumscribed Circle, and
transferred into the Ellipsis by a Ruler laid to A, the common center of the
Ellipsis and of the Circle. This is one way, and is best done by calculation:
here you may also put in the halves, and quarters, and half quarters of
hours, or what other parts you shall best like of.

How to limit the Ellipsis, and divide it, without Calculation.
But if you are desirous to do it rather by protraction, then must you work
somewhat as formerly was done, the manner I will in brief show, wherein you may
see the way both how to describe the Ellipsis, and also how to divide it, all
under one.

1. Having prepared all necessary requisites before hand, you must first set
off the substilar line in its true position from the Vertical line, which to
do, I here suppose already known. So in the following figure you see A C B
drawn for the substilar line, or the proper meridian of the plain.

2. Upon this plain, and upon some point of the Substylar line, as at A, as
upon a center, describe the Circle B M E, and quarter it, and let the
Semidiameter of that Circle be counted as the Radius

3. Upon one of the quarters, set off the Poles elevation as from E to F, and
draw A F, and from E to A F take the least distance, as E G, and with that
distance, upon the former center A, describe another lesser Circle as C H.

4. From B (where the greater Circle cuts the substylar) set B M equal to the
plains difference of Longitude: and from M divide that exterior Circle into 24
equal parts, which signify the 24 hours; and by a Ruler laid to the common
center A, transfer them into the lesser Circle, as M H, 10 I, 6 K, etc.



5. From every point in the great Circle, draw lines parallel to the substylar,
and from every point of the lesser Circle draw lines perpendicular to the
substylar, or parallel to the longest diameter P A R, and so each couple of
these lines shall cut each other at right angles.

6. Note where every line thus drawn from any point of the greatest Circle,
meets with the other line which is drawn from the like point in the lesser
Circle. For the concourses of these answerable lines are the points here
required. That is, Those are the points which show both where the Ellipsis is
to be drawn, and also where it is to be divided into its requisite parts.

Thus in the precedent figure: M O and H O meet in the point O, 10 L and I L
meet in the point L, 6 N and K N meet in the point N, and so the rest will meet
in their due places. These points show the way where through the Ellipsis is to
be drawn, and the same points show where the hours are to be marked out. The
like may be done for quarters and half quarters of hours, or any other
division that shall be best liked of.

There are many other ways to do the same things, but I suppose this to be
most expedient.

Note: that
1. The Index in these Elliptical Dials must stand perpendicularly upright upon
the plain, making right angles with it every way, as it was ordered to do upon
the former sort of direct plains.

2. The annual course of the Sun must be limited as formerly in the other
plains, that is, making the greater semidiameter as a Badius, you must find
the Cosine of the Poles elevation above the plain. This Cosine is to be made
either as a Tangent of 45 gr. whereof you are only to use 23: Or else it is to
be made a Decimal Scale. By both these you have Tables and Rules how to
complete the Suns annual course, either in degrees of the Signs in the Zodiac,
or by the days of the 12 months.

3. Either the Index must move and the Ellipsis lie still, or contrarily. Every
man in this must do as his invention shall best suggest. And that motion must
be made either upon the substylar line, or else parallel to it, which way
soever it be, it must be precisely and punctually ordered.

4. All other things concerning the time of Sun rising and setting, the Suns
Amplitudes and Declinations, may here (in the same manner as before) be
inserted either proper to the plain, or proper to the place, as shall be
desired.

5. In right Horizons or Polar plains, the Ellipsis closes quite up into a
straight line: and so the division of it is only by the exterior Circles parts
projected upon it by those lines that are drawn parallel to the substylar.

Thus far of the Elliptical Dial, as it is to be described upon declining
plains whose Indexes stand perpendicular to the plains, and which do not lie
under the Meridian of the place but swerve from it.

FOr this purpose here are two Tables joined together, both of them made for
the Latitude of London, 51 gr. 30 min. the like to which every man may
calculate for his own place.

The first of them is a Table of such angles as are made by the hour lines
(coming through the center of the Ellipsis) with the Meridian line or line of
12. And it was made by that rule which was given (in this case) at the
beginning of this Treatise. Namely,

As the Sine of your Poles elevation (which is here 51 gr. 30 m.) is to the
Radius;

So is the Tangent of each hour and their quarters (counted from 12 a clock,)

To the Tangent of the angle required.

The second Table is of the Altitudes of each hour and quarter, in the
Equinoctial Circle, above the Horizon; and it is calculated by this Rule.

As the Radius,

To the Cosine of your Latitude (which is here the Sine of 38 gr. 30 min.)

So is the Sine of each hour and their quarters, (counted from 6 a clock,)

To the Sine of the altitude which is here sought.

Then having computed these two Tables, you may (by help of them) both draw and
divide the Ellipsis into its true hours and quarters by these following
directions.

First, draw the two lines 6 6 and D E, crossing each other at right angles in
A, and let A D be the Meridian, and 6 A 6 the two six a clock lines.

Then upon A as a center describe the Circle 6 D 6 of any convenient bigness;
and upon the same Circle from D (on both sides of it) set on the hours and
their quarters, as 11 and 1, 10 and 2, etc. by help of the degrees and minutes
of the angles set to every hour in the former Table. And through every of
these points inscribed into the Circle, draw lines from the center A, as A 11,
A 10, A 1, A 2, with the rest of the hours and their quarters if you will.

Thirdly, supposing A 6 to be the Radius, you may divide it into 90 Sines; the
beginning or largest parts whereof must be at A, but the numeration must be the
contrary way, beginning at 6 and ending at A in 90. Or you may take the
complements of the former Altitudes in the Table, and take them out of a line
of Sines numbered the right way, which will be best for the Sector, or such
Instruments which will best perform this work without any great trouble.

Fourthly, look in the second Table for the altitudes of the Equinoctial at
every hour. Then count those Altitudes in the line of Sines, and take with
your Compasses the several distances of them from A, and transfer the said
distances from the center A to every hour respectively, so shall those
intersections give you the points through which the Ellipsis must be drawn.

Thus the altitude of 7 and 5 a clock (which is 9 gr. 17 m.) being taken upon
the line of Sines from A toward S, is inserted into 4 hours at the note m.
And the altitude at 8 and 4 (which in the Table is 18 gr. 8 min.) being taken
and transferred to the four hours at n, do give four points more. The rest of
the altitudes give (each of them) two hours only, as at o, i, and r, is done.
And the last of all at 12, gives one only point at t. The like may be done for
the quarters. And so through these points thus found the Ellipsis may easily be
drawn, and the lines formerly drawn give the divisions that are due unto it.

Note.
1. This is propounded only for Horizontal plains, but it may without
difficulty be applied to any other direct plain. The trouble that is, comes by
reason that the foresaid plains have a different elevation of the Pole, from
that elevation that belongs to the Horizon or place where they are to stand:
and consequently there will be required two new Tables for that elevation which
is proper to the plain; the calculation of which will easily be done by the two
former proportions set down for that end. Note further that by these two Tables
you may prick down an Ellipsis upon any leaning (not upright) plain whatsoever.
But the Index must then lie in the Zenith line of the place, (not of the plain)
and the Ellipsis (or Index) must move in the Meridian of the place (not of the
plain) and the Zodiac must be like or proportional to the Zodiac of the
Horizon, but augmented, for the most part, in this proportion.

As the Radius, To the Secant of that angle that the Meridian line (upon the
plain) makes with the Horizon; (which angle must be gott^n by a Clinatorie;)

So the Radius of the Horizontal Zodiac, (which is the Cosine of the
Latitude,) To the Radius of the Zodiac proper to the plain: which Zodiac must
be set according to the line of 12 upon the plain.

2. This way of delineation may likewise be applied to all other plains which
decline, and are not direct. But in these will be found more difficulty then in
the former plains which declined not, unless it be required to put in the
hours that are proper to the plain; for in that case the work is the same
which was in them. But if the hours of the place are to be inscribed, as most
usually they are, then there will be some trouble, by reason that the
difference of the plains Longitude seldom falls upon any just hour. I purpose
not here to show the way, it being such as will prove un-pleasant to the
unskilful, and such as have knowledge will find it out quickly. Perhaps the
pleasure of the thing done, will recompense their labor.

SECT. IV. Here follow some Uses and Varieties of this Ellipticall Dial.
USES.
FIrst, If the Index stand still, and the Ellipsis be made moveable; you may
upon that plate which is immovable, and on which the Index stands, describe
a Circle, whose center must be the foot of the Index. And drawing a Meridian
line upon the said immovable plate (just under the Meridian of the Ellipsis,
and) from the foot of the Index you may divide that Circle (beginning from the
Meridian line) into 360 gr. or so many of them as shall be needful. By these
degrees you shall find the Suns Azimuth by the shadow of the upright Index,
and by the divisions of the Ellipsis you may know the hour of the day. So both
Azimuth and Hour are showed upon the two plates by one upright Index.

This kind of Dial must be set in its true position (for it will not set it
self) and must there be fixed. If it be upon an Horizontall, or any direct
plain, you may draw a Meridian line thereon, and either draw the Azimuths true
upon it, and so make the Ellipsis to move to and fro according to that
Meridian: Or else, if both your plates be to be fixed upon any Base prepared
for them, you may, first, upon that Base draw a true Meridian line, and to that
line make the Meridian of the Dial to agree.

The like must be done in all declining flats, only you must be careful to
make the shortest Di^meter of the Ellipsis (which is the proper Meridian of the
plain) to agree with the same proper Meridian, as it shall first be drawn upon
the Base in its true position.

2. A second excellent use may be for the setting of moveable Dials, such as
are made to stand out of the weather, and are only to be set in the Sun at
pleasure, when the hour shall be required. Of this kind are Polyhedrall
Bodies made of some light matter, and Concaves, etc. But it is supposed that
some of the superficies of such Bodies, (etc.) have the hours of the p^ace
described upon them the ordinary way, by the Axis of the Equinoctial, and that
this Ellipsis is fitted to some one plain (which principally is the Horizontal
plain (because that alone will show all the hours of the day) or in some
Horizontal position to the concave, or any such Dial) in its just position and
always with an upright Index, (that is, an Index perpendicular to the plain
whereon it stands) which is not always upright in respect of us, but only in
respect of the plain) and with the hours also of the place. These things being
so fitted, you may place your Body or Concave in the Sun, and turn it about
till you discern that both kinds of Dials do agree to show one hour, which
when they do, then all stand right in their true situation, which will never
else happen but only when the hours do in both agree. -- To this place is
referred the Double Horizontal Dial, the one of them giving the hour by the
Axis, the other by the upright Index. -- And here it must be noted, that the
worst time of the day for this setting the Dials in a true position, is at the
nearest to noon, and the best time is about the Suns b^ing in the East and West
Azimuth.

3. This kind of Dial may be placed (in a moveable posture) before a casement
in any window that has a flat board upon which it may move. And the Index to
it may be an upright thread (precisely upright it must be) that is fixed at the
top and bottom of the window, to and from which the Ellipsis must move in a
Meridian line that is drawn upon the board of the window, and from or justly
even upon the thread. -- And where I say the window must be flat, it is to be
understood that there is no extraordinary exactness required in that. For if
it should rise or incline 5 gr. to the Horizon, it would not err one minute of
time about our Latitude; provided that the Meridian be truly drawn, and the
Index perfectly upright, in which all possible exactness is required.

4. If any choice plain reclining, or however situated plain that shall
represent the Horizon of some notable place, be fixed as a Base whereon to
place such a Dial thus fitted, and drawn to the proper hours of that same
place: this double Dial being placed upon that Base, and turned about thereon,
will show the true hour at that place when both of them do agree, and the
Meridian of it will show how the proper Meridian of that place is to be placed,
and which way drawn.

5. If such a Recliner (or Incliner, or Erect) shall be furnished with such a
double Dial to some intended Declination, though they stand and be framed
properly to the plain in respect (chiefly) of the upright Index, and shall
(notwithstanding) have the proper hours of the place upon both Dials: and if
further such a Recliner as was mentioned, have an horizontal base, upon which
it may be turned round: I say, though this Body be horizontally moveable, and
may be turned any way, yet the two Dials will never agree to show the same
hour, until the Base stand to the true Declination to which the double Dial
was drawn.

SECT. V. Some varieties of the structure of it do here follow.
FIrst, Instead of the Ellipsis drawn to the proper Meridian and Latitude of
the plain, there may be used a true Circle equally divided: but then let these
things be observed.

First, That the Index must be perpendicular every way to the plain on which
the Circle is elevated, standing upright upon it. Secondly, That the motion
(either of Index or Circle) must be according to the proper Meridian of the
plain. Thirdly, That the Zodiac must also be proper to the plain, and must lie
upon the plain or Base it self, and must be the same with that which should
serve for the Ellipsis. But then, Fourthly, this equally divided Circle must be
elevated over the proper Meridian of the plain (that is, the Base of it must
rest upon the proper East and West line of the plain) so much it must be
elevated as the elevation of the Equinoctial above that plain comes unto. And
the elevation of it may be either way; that is, either upon the South Coast,
and then it will be answerable to the Equinoctial in the heavens; or else it
may be toward the North, but still so much as the Equinoctials (not the Poles)
elevation comes unto, and in some cases it must be done both ways that the Sun
may come at it, and it must then have two Indexes. Both ways it is alike true.
It must be divided into equal hours and parts, and so much of it must stand
above the Base or plain on which it moves, as the longest day comes unto. The
beginning of the division must be from the line of 12, and if the plain be not
direct, then must the difference of Longitude be counted in the circular
degrees, from the highest point, or from the Vertical line of this
Equinoctial Circle.

2. This Dial is not so tied to a plain, but that it may also be brought to an
un-even Superficies, yet so, that the motion of it, or the Zodiacal Scale must
be upon some plain. But to show the manner how this should be performed, is
more proper for those Projecting ways which I have in another place had some
assayes of. Only remember that the Horizontal Dial must be projected, not by
the Axis, but by the Zenith.

3. A double Dial depending upon this kind, may be made to set it self, and
to show the hour in a Craticular form, which is also more properly to be
handled in my other ways.

There remains yet one structure more, by which it is fitted for some uses that
follow after, and is made a portable Instrument, not at all to be used in
observation.
1. MAke a right angled Parallelogram, as A B C D, whose length may be about
three times the breadth: and let the limb (upon which the graduations stand)
be higher then the Plain or Area of it.



2. Describe a Semiellipsis to your own Latitude, whose longest Radius let be M
O, a little longer than A B, that when the center M is left out and cut off, so
much as M N comes to (which may be about half a quarter of an hour from 12 in
the Ellipsis) the remaining breadth N O, or E F, or G H, may be just fit to A B
the breadth of the hollow Area, in which this lesser rectangled Parallelogram E
F G H may be moved to and fro as there shall be occasion. And let the
thickness or depth of this moving plate be the same with the thickness of the
limb of the lower plate. The division of the Ellipsis may be made according to
the rules before given.

3. In the midst of this lesser plate, let a hole be pierced quite through it;
and in that hole let a thread be extended, as I K, which is to serve for an
Index, by which the said Semiellipsis is to be rectified. And therefore it is
best that the thread I K be laid just in the longer diameter, which is the 6 a
clock line.

4. Take the lesser Parallelogram and put it into its place, as close to the
end A B as it will go, and when it is there laid, observe where the thread lies
upon the lower Area, and draw the line upon which it lies, which must be the
line 90, 90; upon which the Scales (that are inscribed) must take their
beginning. And likewise you are to take the longer Radius O M, and as the plate
there lies, set one foot of that Radius upon O, and let the other reach as far
as it will, which must be upon the rising limb beyond the inner edge of it, so
much as M N comes to: in that point you are to make one center: so again,
turning your lesser plate about, you must lay it in the contrary way, close to
A B, as you did before, and from the point O you may find the second center:
both these centers (in each of which must a thread be fastened) will happen to
fall in the former line 90, and 90, near the points T and V.

Being thus far prepared, you may take away the lesser plate, and divide the
Scales upon the greater plate, in this manner.
5. First, For the two limbs of it, they are nothing else but the degrees of a
Circle projected thereon from the two centers: which may therefore without
difficulty be done either from the degrees of a Circle, or else by Tangent
lines, as any man will easily perceive.

6. Secondly, For the other Scales you must make them parallel to the edge of
the limbs. There are three of them in number: The longest is a Scale of
Tangents: The middlemost is a Scale of hours, made in the form of a line of
Sines: The third is a Zodiac, or Scale of the year.

The Tangents are made thus. Taking M O as Radius, find the Cosine of your
Latitude agreeable thereto: and making that Cosine as a Radius, or Tangent of
45 degrees, all the other Tangents are to be fitted accordingly. Then to know
how far of this line will be useful, put the lesser plate again into its
place, as close to the end C D as it will go, so shall the thread I K show the
furthest point of it that will be useful.

The middle Scale of Sines is made thus. Count the complement of your Latitude
upon the new made Tangent line, and from the beginning of the Scale to that
point, make a line of Sines for six hours and their quarters, so shall this
Scale be fitted.

The Zodiac or Annual Scale is equal in length to the Tangent of 23 gr. 30
min. and the manner of inscription with Tables whereby to do it, are set down
before, and need not be here repeated.

The reason why this Instrument is thus contrived.
The intent of the contrivance is, that it should show both Azimuth and hour,
and that therefore there should be a Ci^^^ and an Ellipsis sliding over it,
both of them made to one center, so that the center should be in the midst, and
the Circle should be a whole entire Circle, and the Ellipsis also whole. But
because the Ellipsis sliding upon the nether plain, does sometimes of necessity
cover the center, so as that there can be no thread fixed for use, I was
therefore compelled to order it in this manner that is before expressed, that the
motion of the upper plate and the centers might stand clear without hin^^ing
each other.

Then further it must be noted, that the Instrument is (not general to all,
but) particular to one La^^tude.

The uses of it do here follow, which by reason of the Semiellipsis will not be
so easy, because many changes are required. In general note thus much.
1. In using this Instrument you must always suppose that you look upon the
North. 2. If the Declination of the Sun or Star be North, hold A B toward you.
If South, then hold C D toward you. 3. If the Sun or Star be Eastward of the
Meridian, let the morning hours be toward you. If they be Westward, let the
evening hours be toward you. 4. Always use that thread which is on the same
side with the center of the Ellipsis. And that side lin^ of the larger plate is
ever to be taken for the Meridian, and consequently the other side must be
esteemed for one of the two Coasts of East or West. 5. Because North is
furthest from you, therefo^^ the furthest quarter of the limb must be either
North-east or North-west: the nearest South-east or South-west.
These cautions being observed, the conclusions that are to be wrought will be
easy.

1. By having the Azimuth to find the Hour.
First, Order your Instrument by the former cautions, according to the present
case of your observation. And rectify the upper ^late (by help of the thread
Index) either to the Declination of the Star, counted in the Tangent line, or
to the Suns place in the Zodiac. Then count the Azimuth given upon the right
quarter of the limb, and apply the thread thereto: So shall the thread show
(upon the Ellipsis) the hour in which the Sun or Star is.

If the work be for the Sun, then the hour thus showed is the Suns hour, or
hour of the day.

If the work be for a Star, it then shows the Stars hour only; which must
afterward be reduced into the Suns hour, that it may be the true hour of the
night. This change may most easily be done by a common Nocturnall.

2. By having the Hour in which the Sun or any Star is, the Azimuth thereof
may be found.
The Instrument being rectified; lay the thread upon the hour (counted in the
Ellipsis) the same thread will show the Azimuth in the graduations upon the
limb.

3. To find the Ascensionall difference, the Semidiurnall and Seminocturnall
arkes, with the time of their risings and settings.
In general note this: If the Sun or Star decline Northward, then the
Semidiurnall arc is greater than six hours; if Southward, then less.

The upper plate therefore being rectified, either to the Suns place, or to the
Stars Declination, the thread will show upon the middle Scale, the Ascensionall
difference, if you count the hours how many they are from 6. It shows the
Seminocturnall arks, by the hours of setting and rising being rightly taken
according to the condition of North or South declination. It shows the time of
Sun rising and setting, according to the hours upon which it lies. But for the
Stars, it shows only upon what houre-circles they rise and set; but the true
hour or time thereof must be found by turning the Stars hour into the Suns
hour, which (as I said before) will be done with most ease by an ordinary
Nocturnall, in which the Stars (that you deal with) are placed.

4. To find the Amplitude of their Risings and Settings.
When your upper plate lies so rectified, lay the thre^^ upon the Ellipsis, to
the Ascensionall difference, or S^midiurnall arc before found. The thread so
laid, will show the Amplitude in the limb of the Instrument.

Note here.
In the first of these Propositions I suppose the Azimuth, in the second I
suppose the Hour to be given by observation. For the observing of these two,
you may make in any convenient window, both an Horizontall Dial, with a thread
Axis lying in the Axis of the world, and an Azimuth Circle with a thread Axis,
standing upright in the Zenith line. The divisions suitable to both these, may
be inscribed upon the board of the window; and for the Sun, the shadow of the
thread will give the hour of it upon the Horizontall Dial; or the Azimuth
upon the Azimuthall Circle. But for the Stars that cast no shadows, you may
make sliding sights, that may move upon the edge of the window board, or may be
upon the bo^rd it self, (which must in these respects be level, or at least
near to it.) And those moving sights must be furnished with short wires or pins
which may best stand upon the edge of the sight, and go down to the window
board, and to the divisions that are drawn upon it, which may be both for
sights by which to look at the standing Index and Star both together, and must
serve as Indexes to show the hour or Azimuth on which a Star is at any time.
Only this general caution must be given, that th^se pins be set parallel to
the thread Axis that is set in the window (that is) for the Azimuths they must
stand upright, but for the hour they must lie aslope, parallel to the Axis of
the world. This I have sometimes done, and this any man may at his pleasure do,
whereby either the Hour or A^^muth may be observed, and when any one of them
is known; this Instrument (now described) will find the other.

In such like cases this Instrument will be delightful and of good use.

5. To find the Declination of the Sun.
Set the thread of the upper pla^e upon the Suns place in the Zodiac, or upon
the day of the month in the Annual Scale, the same th^eed will give the
Declination thereto belonging, upon the Tangent Scale.

6. How to make an Horizontall Dial by this Instrument.
The meaning is to know how many degrees are intercepted between the Meridian
line, and any other hour line. There are two ways to do it. The first is the
converse of the making of the Instrument. For if the thread Index be laid to
the line where the Scales of the lower plate begin, so that the line of six do
lie evenly between the two ^^nters where the threeds are fastened, t^en the
center thread applied to the hours severally will show how much they are
gradually distant from the line of 12. But you must here remember to take 6 for
12, and 7 or 5 for 11 or 1, and so the rest of the hours in that order. And
the graduall space^ or distances from the Meridian or line of 12, must be
counted from 90 contrary to the numeration of the limb. Bu^ this is not so
artificial as this that now follows.

Set the moving plate to any hour upon the middle Scale, and apply the center
thread to the like hour in the Ellipsis taken on that side of it that is
furthest from ^he beginning of the three Scales, and it will s^ew you (upon the
limb) the angle or Horizontall space that is du^ to that hour. The like is to
be done in every other of the hours.

SECT. VI. AN ADVERTISEMENT Concerning some other uses of the Instrument that
was last described.
SInce the writing of that which is gone before, other things there are which
came into my thoughts concerning the further use of this Instrument.

It were more expedient therefore that the Ellipsis were divided into hours
and degrees, rather then into quarters and half quarters of hours. Which
division (as also the description of it) may by protraction be performed by
those rules that are given before. But if it be thought better to do it by
Tables; then by the former rules of calculation given for this work, you may
frame two Tables, the one of Angles, the other of Altitudes to your own
Latitude, such as in the following Table are computed to ^he Latitude of
London. B^ these Tables you may put in every hour and third degree, the
intermediate degrees may be equally divided. The numeration will be either by
15, 30, 45, etc. according as the signing of it by hours will requir^; Or ^lse
besides the hours you may set on 10, 20, 30, etc. in small figures, which will
stand without hindering the numbers (or numerall letters) that are set for the
hours.

This Ellipsis thus divided, may represent either the Horizon, or else any of
the ( Almicantars or) parallel circles to the Horizon; and the divisions of it
must then signify the Azimuths. And if it be too big (especially when it comes
to represent any of the higher Almicantars) you may add another sliding plate
of the same breadth that the former was, na^^ly M O here equal to M O in the
former, and M N must in both be justly equal, that it may both slip in the
former cavity, so as just to fill it, and that the same limbs, centers, and
threeds, may in both agree.

But then a lesser Ellipsi^ must be here described and so the length G E or F H
will be diminished.

A lesser Ellipsis (I say) must be described, which though it be less, yet it
must be like and proportional to the former.

Therefore assuming any length as M P, for the longer Radius, you must (to that
Radius) make M R and M S equall^ to the Sine of your Latitude, and so describe
and divide it as formerly was ordered.

Then again, to this new Ellipsis there must a new Scale of Tangents be made,
whose length must be limited as the former was, in this manner. To M P as
Radius, find the Cosine of your Latitude, and make that Cosine a Radius or
Tangent of 45 gr. and according thereunto, continue the Scale of Tangents as
far as it will go. It must begin upon the same line that the other Scale of
Tangents began, and must go the same way with it. And in this new way of
ordering the Scales and the Ellipses, it must be considered what the other
parts of the Instrument do signify

The end of the lower plate, upon which the Scales begin, must be accounted for
the North, the other end C D is to be taken for South. The side lines are the
Meridian. The degrees of the limbs are to be used as the degrees of the
Equinoctial. The thread applied to those degrees are the Meridians coming
from the Centers, which are the North Pole. The Tangents are the degrees of
Altitude. The Ellipsis notes out that Almicantar which the thread Index stands
unto upon the Tangent Scale.

And further. It is to be here noted, that if the Meridians (or threeds coming
from the center) were rightly divided, those divisions or parts of it should
signify the degrees of Declination from the Equinoctial. But the
inconvenience of it is, that because one Ellipsis is to represent every
Almicantar, therefore the Radius cannot possibly be at all times the same in
length, but must vary according to the removing or several positions of the
said Ellipsis. That is, when the Ellipsis signifies the Horizon (or stands at
the beginning of the Scales, without any altitude at all) then the Radius M O
in the first moving plate, or M P in the second moving plate, is the Scale of
Declinations, but at other times, when the Ellipsis signifies any Almicantar,
then must the Secant of that Almicantar (of Altitude) be taken as the Radius
for that particular work. But always the Radius (of what length soever it be)
must be divided as a whole line of Sines, the greatest parts beginning toward
the center, the least parts ending at the remotest end from the center, and yet
then again, the numeration of the parts or declinations of it must begin at the
remotest end, and must end in the center at the Pole.

It might be applied to use in the motions of the Stars, but that would be
troublesome; therefore it shall suffice to make it useful only for the Sun.

The best way that (for the present) I know whereby to divide this Radius (thus
of several lengths) is this. Divide the length from the center T to C into 90
Sines (the greatest parts beginning at the center, but numbered the contrary
way.) This line may be drawn from the center T into some part of the limb,
where it may have room to receive divisions. Then with your Compasses take the
Radius T V, equal to M O, and from the end of the former Scale, open the
thread to the least distance, and where the thread stays, there make a mark
upon the limb V D, for there is a new Scale to begin, for the Secants that
were mentioned before.

Then lay the thread from T to 80 in the opposite limb, and move the Ellipsis
till the point O fall just under the thread, and take T O in your Compasses,
and put in that distance as before, so shall you put in 10 gr. into this new
Scale. In like manner lay the thread to 70, 60, etc. and bring the Ellipsis
till the point O lies under it, so shall T O (in these several positions) give
the lengths to be inscribed in this new Scale, for 20 gr. and 30 gr. etc. all
the rest must be done in like manner, till you have put in as many as will come
within the reach of the limb, which will be upon 60 gr. or thereabout.

The like should also be done for the lesser Ellipsis, working in the same
manner by the thread and the point P. These are called the new inscribed Scales.

The former line of Sines serves to them both indifferently.

Now when things are thus fitted, the uses of them will be such as in
particular Astrolabes is vulgarly known.

Some of the Uses are here mentioned.

1. Having the Suns Declination and Altitude to find the Hour and Azimuth.
First, For North Declinations. Set the Ellipsis to the Altitude counted in the
Tangent Scale. Then count the same Altitude in the new inscribed Scale of
Secants, and thereto lay the thread. Afterward, take the least distance from
the Suns declination, (counted in the forementioned inscribed Scale of Sines)
to the thread. Set one foot of that distance in the center, and extend the
other till it cross the Ellipsis, and where it crosses, thither apply the
thread, which (in the limb) will show the Hour and scruple (in degrees)
required. The same point of the Compasses does also immediately show (upon the
Ellipsis) the Azimuth sought for. If the Compasses do cross the Ellipsis twice
(as sometimes it will) take that crossing that is furthest from the Meridian.

Secondly, for South declinations. The work is in a manner the same: only you
must note that the thread will cross the Ellipsis twice, and you are in this
case to take that crossing which is nearest to the Meridian.

By supposing the Altitude to be 00, that is, by laying the Ellipsis upon the
line T V, and using the Declination as before, you may find both the Amplitude
and Ascensionall difference as before, and what else does thereon depend.

But because these things being done near the Horizon, will not prove good,
especially when the Declination is little from the Equinoctial: and because
the work at the best is but troublesome, I shall here break off, supposing that
I have already written too much.

A DEMONSTRATION of the Ellipticall Dial upon an Horizontall Plain: showing
the reason why the same Dial, by an upright Index should show the true Hour.
THE reason is principally deduced from the Sphere it self: and secondly, from
the Orthographicall Projection of the Sphere upon the plain of the Horizon;
which as it does represent the Sphere it self, so it does perform the same
conclusions with the like certainty that the Sphere does; and that upon this
general ground, that look what Circles, and in what parts they cut each other
upon the former, the same Circles and the same parts of those Circles do upon
this latter cut each other in the same manner. I shall here take for granted,
that the Projecture is (for truth) in all respects answerable to the Sphere it
self, which is abundantly made good by those that have treated upon this
subject. Then from th^s Projection I shall show how the Ellipticall Dial upon
the Horizon must be of the same truth with it. And therefore these things
following must be considered, as so many Lemmaes to prove what is here required.



Note, that in no form of Projection besides the Orthographicall, this kind of
Dial can be true; that is, that no figure but an Ellipsis will do it, nor yet
all Ellipses, or Ellipses divided into all (...), as in some Projections the^
are, when one half or 180 gr. on one side, are greater than the other half or
180 gr. on the other side: these will not do here, but only such as whose
extreme Diameters are the sixes and twelves, that is, such as are produced by
infinite Orthographicall Projection.

First, The Equinoctial Circle, and all the Parallels of Declination, are
projected upon the plain of the Horizon into like Ellipses. And that they are
all of them divided (by the Meridians) alike or proportionally one to the other.

The reason of this may be conceived upon this ground. Since the Equinoctial
and all the Parallels are Circles of a just parallel situation one to the other
(as their name imports:) therefore on what point soever of the horizontall Axis
the eye is placed, the said Circles must be Ellipses (excepting only if the eye
be placed upon the superficies of the Sphere, for then, and only then, they
will be all perfect Circles,) as all that write upon this subject do
sufficiently make good: and consequently, when the eye is placed upon the same
Axis, in an infinite distance, as this Projection supposes. But the second
thing is more to our purpose, and that is, that all their degrees and quarters,
and other like parts, art like and proportional one to the other (not all the
parts of one and the same Ellipsis are like, that is equal, one to the other,
as in the Circles themselves upon the Sphere they are, but each one of these
Ellipses is justly like any other of them, both in the whole, and likewise when
any of the like parts of one be compared with the like parts of the other, as
one quarter, etc. with another.) And the reason briefly is, because the eye is
supposed (in this Orthographical Projection) to stand in an infinite distance
from the plain on which the projection is made; and because it doeh stand in an
infinite distance, therefore all these Circles are alike situated to the eye,
and consequently must make a like or proportional Projection of every of those
parallels with their like situated parts. But if the eye should stand at a
finite distance, then these parallels would not have a like situation to the
eye, neither in respect of distance, nor in respect of position, and so the
like parts of the parallels could not be like one to the other in the
Projection, because of their different position. But in the Orthographicall
Projection at an infinite distance all things will be alike, being alike
projected from a like position. I say in this it will be so, and in none
besides this.

COROLLARY.
Whence will follow: That the Equinoctial Circle, or Ellipsis rather, may
represent both it self, and likewise any other of the Parallels, if it be so
contrived to stand from the Zenith point, as that it may have a proportional
situation from it, suiting with the position of any other Parallel which it is
to represent. And this is the main ground upon which this Dial will be proved
to be true.

LEMMA II.
Secondly, Any two like plain Figures may be alike situated. to any point
assigned; so as that from that point any two right lines being drawn
infinitely, shall cut proportional parts from those two like figures.

This is general to all like figures, whether they be two or more; plain or
solid: but for our purpose it will be enough to show it to be true in like
Ellipses. One way for the making of one Ellipsis like to another, is by
assuming of any point, as a in the greater Ellipsis, and from thence drawing as
many lines as you will, as a b, a c, you must divide them into proportional
parts at d and e, that as a b to a d; so a c to a e: and then through those
points the lesser Ellipsis may be drawn, which must be like to the greater* and
alike situated to the point a, because all those lines are proportional, and
the subtenses b c, d e, will likewise be parallel and proportional. And if the
lines a b, a c, had been augmented proportionally (as here they were
diminished) there would have been a greater Ellipsis described, like to the
other.



COROLLARY.
Hence will follow* That if the centers of two like Ellipses be laid upon one
line, as upon one of their common Diameters, and from any point assigned (unto
which they are to be alike situated) there be an infinite line drawn to any
point of one of the Ellipses, and the like point of the other Ellipsis be
brought to that ^^finite line (the center of it still keeping upon the common
Diameter,) those Ellipses in that situation shall stand alike posited to the
assigned point.

Because there are two lines (the common diameter and the infinite line) that
from the point assigned do cut like parts of both Ellipses. The common diameter
makes them alike situate in respect of one dimension (suppose the length) of
the locus planus whereon they lie, and the infinite line limits them in respect
of the other dimension (suppose the breadth) of the same locus planus. So that
they are quite limited in respect of their like situation to the point, and can
(in this respect) lie in no other place for this individual position.

LEMMA III.
Thirdly, All the Azimuths of the Horizon are (in this Orthographicall
Projection) cast into straight lines meeting all in the Zenith point.

The reason is, because all these Circles do cross each other upon the Axis of
the Horizon (or upon the Zenith line,) upon which line the eye is imagined to
be placed at an infinite distance. Therefore they all (that is, the plains of
them infinitely continued) do cross through the eye, and consequently must all
be projected into straight lines. And their concourse being upon the Zenith
line, and the same Zenith line coming into the eye, the said whole line, and
their whole concourse will be cast or resolved into one single point, answering
to the Zenith point of the Sphere.

The application of these things to the purpose intended.
First, In the Projection it self we are to consider these things.

If it be furnished with parallels and hours, as the manner is, and laid
horizontally with the Meridian line of it just North and South: and if further,
there be an upright Index set in the Zenith point at Z, then shall the shadow
of that erect Index represent the Azimuth in which the Sun is, and if you note
where it cuts the Parallel wherein the Sun (for that day) is, the same shadow
will show (among the hours of that parallel) the time of the day.

This conclusion is true upon any Horizontal Projection (the Stereographicall
as well as the Orthographicall) for the straight lines or Azimuths whether
shadow or Index coming from the Zenith, and cutting through any hour in any
parallel, does show the Azimuth in which the Sun must be at that hour for the
day of that parallel.

And further, because all the Projection is made upon the plain of the Horizon
(which therefore must be the fundamental Circle of the Projection, and) which
for that cause is, and must be (as all fundamental Circles of any Projection
are) equally divided; Therefore an upright Index standing in Z the center of
it, and so answering to the Zenith line of the Sphere, and the degrees of the
Horizontall Circle answering to the degrees of the Horizon in the Sphere. I say
the shadow of that Index does really show the true Azimuths of the Sun, or the
true angles of position that the Sun at any time makes with the Meridian line.
And further, the same shadow or Azimuth where it crosses the Parallel of the
day (which Parallel is divided into its proper parts, like to the parts of the
Equinoctial, by the Meridian Circles issuing out of the Poles) it notes out
also the hour of the day.

So that the Projection made in this manner with an upright Index and divided
Parallels, will (by the shadow of that Index) show the true hour of the day
upon that parallel that is proper for the day, if the Meridian of the
Projection lie in the true Meridian of the Horizon.

The next thing to be showed, is how the Ellipticall Equinoctial may supply
the use of all the Parallels.
That is to say, How the Equinoctial, being made movaable, and the Index
standing always still, may be fitted to represent any of the Suns parallels.
And because (as was said before) it is every way like to each of the Parallels,
it will therefore be only required to give some rule how the said Equinoctial
may be at any time placed in a like position to the Zenith point at Z, that any
parallel has to the same point, so as that any right line (or Azimuth) being
drawn from thence may cut a like part or point in the Equinoctial that it does
in the Parallel.

Let the Parallel be H E, I would remove the Equinoctial Ae A so, as that it
might have a like position to the point Z, that the Parallel H E has.

By the Corollary of the first Lemma, it may represent it. By the Corollary of
the second Lemma, the way of it will be easy. For first, the two Ellipses H E
and Ae A, have their centers upon the Meridian line Ae H Z P, as upon one of
their common Diameters. Secondly, the Parallel H E cuts the six a clock Circle,
or Meridian P E A, in the point E, making E A equal in radiall degrees to H Ae
(for the Parallel is every where equidistant to the Equator, and the Meridional
Arks, therefore, intercepted between them, such as are E A and H Ae, must be
equal.) So that E A is the Declination of that Parallel from the Equinoctial.
If therefore the line (or Azimuth) Z E be drawn infinitely through the point of
6 in the Parallel, or through the Declination (of that Parallel) counted in the
Circle of six; and then the Equinoctial (still keeping its center upon the
common Diameter Ae P) be slipped up till the point A thereof do concur with the
infinite line (drawn before) at G; in thus doing, I say that the Equinoctial
is in a like situation to the point Z, that the Parallel H E is in, to the same
point. And consequently, that any right line (or Azimuth) from Z, will cut the
same (rather like) parts in one that it does in the other. As by the Corollary
of the second Lemma will appear.

The next thing to be enquired is, what the line A G is, or how it must be
found and estimated.
For this purpose, consider, that Z P E and Z C O are two Triangles rectangled
at P and C, and having a common angle at Z; therefore, As Z P Cosine of the
Latitude, to Z C the Radius; So P E, the Co-tangent of the Declination, to the
Tangent of C O. Or, As the Radius Z C, to the Cosine of the Latitude Z P; so
is the Tangent of E A, the Parallels Declination, to the Tangent of A O, that
is, to the line A G, which is the Tangent of A O, because the arc A O is
expressed in its full quantity* without any enlarging or fore-shortning, and
the right line A G stands to it as a Tangent thereof, standing at the end of
the Radius Z A. Now consider, that if Z C be considered as Radius, then must
the Tangent of E A be the Tangent of the Parellels declination, estimated to
the same Radius. And because Z P is in the self same proportion to A C,
therefore: If Z P (the Cosine of the Latitude) be estimated for a Radius, then
must A G be esteemed as the Tangent (of this Parallels declination) to the said
Radius Z P. And hence it will follow that

If Z P the Cosine of the Latitude [being taken (as that Cosine) to the
Radius Z C or Z A, which is the longer Radius of the Ellipticall Equinoctiall]
be counted as a Radius or Tangent of 45 gr. and so be divided and continued as
occasion shall be, It is to be noted I say, That this Scale thus limited will
be a right Scale for the requisite motion of the Ellipticall Equinoctial to
such a position in respect of the Zenith point, as that it may represent any
parallel, whose Declination is known, if it be removed to the same Declination
counted upon that Scale. And being set in that like posture, any Azimuth or
shadow of the upright Index that would pass through any hour point of the
Parallel, will also pass through the same point of the Equinoctial, and so
this one may serve for them all.

This gives the reason of making the Zodiac or Annual Scale, mentioned in the
former Treatise, I say it gives the reason of the second way mentioned for
lesser Latitudes. For if either the Signs of the Zodiac, or the months of the
year be put in according to their declinations taken in this Scale, it will be
all one to set your Ellipsis to the Sign or Month, that it is to set it to
the Declination, since they are made one to answer to the other.

Then for the first way for greater Latitudes: because,

As the Cosine of the Latitude, Is to the Sine of the Latitude;

So the Radius, (or Tangent of 45 gr.) To the Tangent of the Latitude.

You see that if you divide the Cosine of your Latitude into 45 Tangents; or
the Sine of your Latitude into the Tangent of your Latitude, the Scale will be
all one according to the former proportion.

What is before spoken of North Parallels of Declination, is the same in South
also, and one Scale (for the kind of it) serves both; only in North
Declinations the Equinoctial goes nearer to the Zenith point, in South it goes
further of.

All other Scales annexed to the Ellipsis have their dependence wholly upon
this Scale of Declinations, and will not need any further explication in this
place.

Then again, it matters not where the little Scale or Zodiac stands, so that it
give the just quantity of removal for the Equinoctial Ellipsis.

And so also, it is no matter whether the Index move, and the Equinoctial
stand, or contrarily: It is only required that their situation be such as may
make the foot of the Index stand in a proportional position to the station of
the Parallel, as was formerly showed.

Further. For the circular year or Zodiac, the ground of it is thus. The Circle
is supposed to be divided into equal parts or degrees: and so every Sine (as
is D F) is a proper Sine to any arc (as D C) to which it is annexed. Again, A
B in another consideration is to be esteemed (as formerly for the Semidiameter
of the Circle, so now again) for the Tangent of 23 degrees, whence this
proportion will stand:

As the Radius A B, Is to the Sine F D; So the same A B, tangent of 23* To the
Tangent A E. Which is the Tange^t belonging to the Right Ascension C D.



[Because in the Sphere, As the Radius,

To the Sine of any Right Ascension, So the Tangent of 23

To the Tangent of the Declination answering to that Right Ascension.]

If therefore you have the Right Ascension belonging to any day, and put it
into the Circle of equal degrees, as C D here is, the Sine of that Right
Ascension, viz. F D, will be equal to A E the Tangent belonging to that Right
Ascension, if B A be taken for the Tangent of 23 gr. So that this way of
putting in Months and Signs is the same in effect with the former Zodiac or
Annual course of the Sun.

Thus far for demonstration of what was hard in the first Section, Page 8, etc.
concerning Horizontall plains.

What is added more in the first Section of framing it to other plains that are
direct, is the same with this. For there is no difference but only in the
latitude of the plain, which is no re^ll discrepance from the former, they both
going upon one ground, and therefore no more to be said here of such plains.

Sect. 2. Page 22, etc. Of framing it to Declining Pl^ins.
DEclining plains, if they had their proper hours upon them, would al^o (in
this Ellipticall respect) be the same with the former direct, or Horizontall
plains. The distinction is, because they are made to another Meridian than is
their own, that is, to the Meridian of the place, and all the account of hours
is deduced from it. The difference therefore of these from the former, is only
this, that the hours in the Ellipsis are not evenly fitted to the quarters or
diameters of the Ellipsis, but fall to stand as casually they may. Now if in
the former case of Horizonta^l plains, you do but suppose the Equinoctial and
Parallels to be divided from any casual Meridian as P M (not P Ae) into hours
and parts, then will follow still the same things in substance that was before.
Namely, That if the Equinoctial Circle be removed according to A G (which must
be supposed to be suited to the Latitude of the place as well as to the Suns
parallel of declination) with those divisions now spoken of, then still, when
the Equinoctial by that motion has got a like situation to the Parallel, the
parts of one will be answerable to the parts of the other, in respect of the
shadows or Azimuths that are cast from the Zenith point and upright Index
standing in it at Z. So that even in these plains also, the same hour will be
showed by the Equinoctial that would be by the Parallel. And so the ground is
(in these) like (rather the same) in substance with the former direct plains.
So much of these.

Sect. 3. Page 29, etc.
THat pricking down of the Horizontall Dial mentioned in this Section, is the
pricking down of the Equinoctial with its hours or parts, just as the
Orthographicall Projection it self has them. The first Table shows what
Angles or upon what Azimuths from the Meridian every hour point lies. The
second gives the Altitudes, or rather the distances of the same hour points
from the Zenith, And therefore no more will be required of this.

The fourth Section requires no explication nor Demonstration.

Sect. 5. Page 37, etc.
FOr the varieties it must be known, that the substance is the same with that
which went before, which being well understood will give light enough to this.

But in this Section there is mention made of a Circle (instead of the
Horizontall Ellipsis) elevated to the height of the Equinoctial. The reason of
that will best be seen out of the Sphere it self, For there we know, that the
Equinoctial and all the Parallels to it are both equally divided, and equally
elevated, and so being all alike, the Equinoctial may supply the room of each
and all of them. Only it must be required (whether the Index move toward the
Circle; or the Circle toward it) that this motion (if the Zodiac be upon the
Horizontall plain) be limited by an Horizontall Zodiac, such as was used for
the Ellipsis upon any plain, (which plain, what ever it be, I now count as an
Horizontall plain.) But if the Index be made to move upon the Equinoctial
(which though it do, yet it must still lie in the Zenith line, not
perpendicular to the circular plain, but making an angle with it equal to the
Latitude of the place, and not the Latitude of the plain.) If, I say, the Index
be made to move upon the Equinoctial plain, then must a new Scale be made like
to that upon the Horizontal plain, but somewhat larger; that is, it must be
augmented so as that the parts and whole of the Horizontall Scale, to the parts
and whole of this Equinoctial Scale; must be as the Radius, to the Co-secant
of the Latitude. Or thus. Because, As the Radius, to the Co-secant of the
Latitude; so the Sine of the Latitude to the Radius: and so again, the Cosine
of the Latitude, to the Co-tangent of the Latitude. Therefore, whereas on the
Horizontall plain (for the Ellipsis thereon described) you look the Cosine of
your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Tangent of 45 gr. you must in this take
the Co-tangent of your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Decimall Scale; and by
it you may put on the Zodiac or months as was prescribed before. This Co*sine
mentioned before was taken to the greater Radius, of the Ellipsis, and so this
Co-tangent here mentioned must be taken to the (same greater Radius of the
Ellipsis, if the Ellipsis were here used, or to the) Radius of the Equinoctial
Circle, whose Radius must be conceived to be the same with the greater Radius
of the Ellipsis. For from this Circle projected Orthographically (that is, by
perpendiculars let fall from the Periphery to the subjacent plain) is the
Ellipsis deduced, and from that Ellipsis (again) is this Circle raised or
restored. And so the reason of this Circular Dial with an upright Index will
be understood well enough.

Then whereas it is said that it makes no matter which way this Circle be
raised, that is, whether toward North or South, there is no difficulty in this,
for which way soever it is turned, if the plain and center of it lie in a just
distance from the Index or Zenith line, the same Index must show the same point
or hour, because in both ways they are situated from it upon the same Coast.

Sect. 6. Page 47, etc.
THat which is here done will not be difficult, if it be considered that what
is aimed at, has relation to Stofflerius Astrolabe: and that here one Ellipsis
must serve to represent every Almicantar. I purpose not to repeat any thing
that is before said: and the rather because this Structure will not be so
expedient and ready in some uses as could be wished. They that desire the
reason of it, may fetch it out of this that has been already said: which may
be done without any great labor.

SECT. VII. 1. How to draw and divide the Ellipsis upon any Plain, to an Index
that stands upright (not to the Plain, but) to the Zenith line of the place, or
perpendicular to the plain of the Horizon.
THis may be done artificially by calculation, or by a lineary way, but not
without too much trouble and incumberance, which would deter any man quite from
putting it in practice. I shall therefore let that way alone, and fall upon
another more feasible and delightful.

The way that I intend, is partly by projection of such lines as are useful,
and partly by inscription of such points as the Ellipticall line is to pass
through, as shall be seen hereafter. And therefere we shall not need to look
after any position of the plain in respect of declination or leaning.

But first in general note thus much; that the Ellipticall Dial cannot
possibly be drawn upon any plain that lies parallel to the Index. And
consequently to these upright Indexes there can no such Dial be made upon any
upright plain. And therefore again to such an Index, it is requisite that the
plain make some kind of angle in respect of Reclination or Inclination from
the Zenith line toward the Horizon, which position (notwithstanding) we shall
have nothing to do withal in this way of working.

2. The manner of the work.
1. LEt the plain be A B C, and the upright Index A D. First then, assume any
point in the Index as at E, and from thence (by the projecting Quadrant, or
some Level) cast an Horizontall level line as F G upon the plain; or if it
cannot be cast upon the plain it self, set any board (for a time) that may
receive it; lying in the same Level with the assigned point at E. And further,
the same Horizontall line must be continued and returned about the point E, by
help of threeds stretched out from some points or other of the Horizontall line
before drawn, as from F or G, unto two supporters set up (for a while) for this
purpose (either upon the plain or otherwise near to it) as is to be seen at H
and I: so that now the points H F G I are all in one and the same Horizontall
level to one another, and likewise to the first point of the Index assumed at
E.

2. At some convenient time of the day, when the Azimuth may be found
distinctly, observe where the shadow of the Index cutteth the Horizontall line,
suppose at K, and there make a mark, and immediately take the Suns Altitude.

3. By the Suns Altitude observed, compute what Azimuth the Sun was then in,
which will tell you what Azimuth the observed point K (in the Horizontall line)
does represent.

4. Take a Pastboard as E L, and fit it to the Horizontall line of the plain F
G, and to the assumed centerat ^: and applying it to its proper place (as in
the figure is represented) draw a line from the point K to the center E, quite
over the pastboard. And then knowing what Azim^^h it is, you may (from it) set
off the Meridian in the true Co^st of it, such as will be answerable to the
heavens, which Meridian line suppose to be P E upon the Pastboard.

5. You are next of all, from this Meridian line P E, to set of all the other
hours of an Horizontall Dial (not the common Horizontall Dial, but)
according to such numbers or arks as are expressed in the Table of Angles, Page
29.) And when this is done upon the Pastboard, as you see done at o P q k s t
u: Then,

6. Apply the Pastboard to its former position upon the plain, and from the
center E project the hours from the Pastboard to the Horizontall line and
threeds. And then taking away your Pastboard, you may draw lines from A to such
points as are in the Horizontall line i^ self, as A o, A p, A q, A k, A s, A
t, A u. And for the others that stand not upon the Horizontall line of the
plain, but upon the threeds which are separate from the plain (such as are e r
p) you may project them by the Index A D, reposing the same upon the said
points (e r p) of the thread; and marking where the shadow or appearance of the
thread traceth the plain, there draw the lines A m, A n, A u. And so all the
lines (that the plain is capable of) may be drawn. And it is to be noted, that
these lines so drawn are not such hour lines as usually are upon other Dials,
but they are those Azimuth lines in which the Sun is at every hour of the
Equinoctial Circle. So the hours and quarters may be put in by the Table,
Page 29, and the Column of Angles in the same Table.



7. Look again into the Table Page 29, for the Column of Altitudes; for by
that must the Ellipsis it self be desc^ibed, for the former Azimuthall-ho^re
l^^es will give it the true divisions into its requisite parts. The manner of
the division is this. Make a Scale of 90 right Sines, but number them versedly,
as is here expressed. And let the Scale be of a fit ^ignes^e for your plain,
which your own judgment must direct you to do. Out of this Scale (setting
always one foot of your Compasses in the point of 90) take such Altitudes as
are (in the Table) appropriated to every hour, and put them into those
several hours in this wise. Suppose the altitude for 12 a clock were to be
put in, which altitude is 38 gr. 30 min. with my Compasses I take (in this
Scale of Sines) from 90 to 38 gr. 30 min. and one foot of that length I put
into the line of 12, namely P A upon the plain, and (always keeping it upon
some part of that line) I remove it thereon, nearer to, or further from the
center A, till the other foot of the Compasses being turned about will justly
touch the edge (or fiduciall line) of the Index. Then I diligently observe
where, or in what point of the line P A the first foot of my Compasses stays,
for that is the point through which the Ellipsis must pass upon the houre-line
of 12. So for any other hour (and the intermediate quarters) taking their
altitudes, (set down in the Table) out of the same Scale of Sines, and
inserting them in the same manner as was showed before, you shall find all the
points (for every hour and quarter) through which the Ellipsis is to be drawn.
Through these points therefore you must draw it carefully, as one continued
line, without any breaches or angles in it.

3. Concerning the motion that is to be made either by the Index, or by the
Ellipsis it self.
THe motion must be made according to the 12 a clock line, which is always the
proper Meridian to the Index or Zenith line. That is, the removal or sliding
must be either in the Meridian it self, or else parallel to it.

Now if the Dial it self be made to slide upon the plain, that is, if the
Ellipsis be to be described upon another plate that s^all slip over the former
plain, then must this plate be first of all laid fast upon the plain, and the
hours and Ellipticall line must be described thereon in the same manner that
was showed before. And this plate must move in the Meridian line, that is, the
12 a clock line of the plate (being imagined to be continued forth right) must
move through the fiduciall edge of the Index.

And so again, If the Dial be drawn upon the plain it self, and the Index be
made to move (the Dial it self standing still) then must care be had that the
fiduciall edge of the Index do precisely move in the Meridian or 12 a clock
line, and that the same Index move always precisely upright in the Zenith line.

4. Concerning the Place of the Suns Annual course or Zodiac.
THe place of it may be best upon the plain. It must stand (if it be inscribed
into a straight line) parallel to the line of 12, and needs not to be in or
upon the said line. The mover (whether plate or Index) must have another
peculiar Index in it, called he^e the Zodiacall Index, by which it is to be
rectified according to the time of the year, If the Zodiac be put into a Circle
(as is mentioned Page 15.) then that Diame^er (of the Annual Circle) which
passes from Tropic to Tropic, must be either in or parallel to the line of
12.

5. Of what limitation or length the Zodiac must be, and how to be described,
and where to be set.
IT must be regulated by the former Scale of Sines mentioned Page 73. For you
may take from 90 (in that Scale) to the number of the Latitude of your place
(not complement as that Scale is numbered) and count that length as a new
Radius. Unto th^s new Radius find the Secant of the Meridians inclination
(which what it is shall be presently showed in the 6 Proposition following) and
then make this Secant to be a Tangent of 45 gr. and out of that Scale of
Tangents take 23 gr. for that length being set both ways from the
Equinoctial, will give the length of the Zodiac (in a straight line, or the
Diameter of the Zodiac put into a Circle:) this work is to be understood for
the describing of the Zodiacall Scale upon the plain it self. But first, you
are to pitch the Equinoctials place, which is that place only upon which the
Zodiacall Index lies, when the mover (whether plate or Index) is placed in the
same position that it had when the Ellipticall line was described. Now when
this Tangent of 45 gr. is thus found, you may take the Declinations (in the
Tables of the 4 and 5 Pages:) out of it, and so prick on the Suns yearly
course. Or else make the forementioned Secant a Decimall Scale, and out of it
take the Tangents noted in the Tables Page 6, 7. So shall you make the same
Annual course of the Sun that was produced the former way.

Note, that if the Index be made to move, it is not necessary that it should
move upon or parallel to the superficies of the plain, but may be made to move
either horizontall, or at any other inclination: only the fiduciall edge must
necessarily be made to move in the very Meridian line, and must also be (in all
motions) always upright, or in the Zenith line of the place; and therefore
must slide just under the Meridian line.

Note also, That the Zodiac though it be not necessarily confined to be set
upon the superficies of the plain, yet it will be most conveniently limited
thereunto.

6. What the Meridians inclination means, and how to find the quantity of it.
BY the Meridians inclination is meant what angle the same line makes with the
plain of the Horizon, and in the former figure Page 70 it is expressed by the
complement of the angle D A P, or the excess of it. To find it, you may
either apply the edge of an Inclinatorie square to the said Meridian line, and
then the thread (being drawn perpendicularly down by the plummet) will show the
said elevation (or inclination) of the Meridian line above the Horizon, in the
degrees of the limb, if the same degrees be taken to the thread from that side
of the Square that stands perpendicularly upon the Meridian line. Or else
another way may be by protracting or measuring the angle D A P, which is the
complement of the former required inclination. It may be done thus. Set one
foot of your Compasses at A, and let the other foot be extended to any point of
the Index, suppose to 8, then measure the same length A 8 upon the Meridian
line, which let be A 7, and to this length fit your line of Chords (upon the
Sector, or some like opening Scale of Chords.) Then take the length from 7 to
8, and measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, so shall you find the
quantity of the angle D A P, whose complement (or excess) is the inclination,
or elevation, or depression of the Meridian, which is here required.

7. Other things to be noted concerning the Zodiacall Scale.
1. IF the Dial be described upon an irregular superficies, such as is not
flat but writhen (as by this course it may very well be) then it is most
convenient that the former Scale be set in some other place, and not upon the
superficies whereon the Ellipsis is described. It may be contrived two ways.

First, If the Dial superficies (how irregular soever it be on that face
whereon the hours are inserted) be flat at the bottom, and be made to move
(the Index standing still) upon some other plain below it) then the best way
will be to make the Zodiacall Index upon the moving bottom of it, and to
describe the Zodiac upon the other plain upon which the motion is made. And to
do this aright, you must project the Meridian line upon that nether plain, and
find out the inclination of it, and so find the Scale by the Secant of that
inclination, just as you were before directed. And so this work will be
complete. The motion of dials unequal Superficies must be in or parallel to
this last projected Meridian line, always so as that the Meridian of the Dial
must pass through the fiduc^all edge of the Index.

Secondly, If the Index be made to move (the Dial standing still) and that the
Dial be upon some unequal super^icies, such as is unfit to receive the
Zodiac, then the foot of the Index may have it inscribed upon it. Now in this
case of unequal Superficies, it is supposed that this foot of the Index cannot
move parallel to that uneven Superficies, but must move straight forward in
some right line, just along with the Meridian line. In this case you must find
the inclination of the foot of the Index to the Horizon, that is, what
inclination a line drawn upon the foot of the Index, either in or parallel to
the Meridian line, has to the Horizon, which must be done by some Inclinatorie
Instrument, or some such way as is used in taking the Reclination or
Inclination of Plains. And when this is done, you are to finish the Zodiac
Scale by the ^ecant of that inclination, in the same manner as was before
showed. So much for this.

2. For the other Scales of the Suns Declination, Amplitude, Ascensionall
difference, and graduall motion in the 12 Signs, they are to be done in the
self same manner, and by the same Tables as before (without any difference)
after that you have found your Tangent Scale or Decimall Scale out of which to
describe them.

8. Another Observation.
ACcording to that general observation Page 36. Note here; That if to an Index
standing in the Zenith line, a Plain be set in the Equinoctial, the same plain
shall have a Circular Dial upon it, equally divided. Then whether the said
Equinoctial plain or the Index move, if they be made to move upon the
Horizontall plain, the Zodiac for the Horizontall plain must serve. But if the
upright (or Zenith line) Index be made to move upon the Equinoctial plain, the
former Horizontall Zodiac must be set upon the Equinoctial plain, and must
there be enlarged above the Horizontall Zodiac, that is, every part of the
Horizontall Zodiac must be made greater upon the Equinoctial plain in
proportion as the Radius to the Co-secant of the Latitude. That is, the Scales
that made the Horizontall, being taken as Radius, must now here be enlarged to
be as Co-secant of your Latitude; and from them (so enlarged) must the parts of
the Zodiac be inscribed upon the Equinoctial plain.

Note further. That for this Equinoctial plain which is to descend downwards
from South toward North, you may instead of it set another plain quite
contrarily, that is, descending from North toward South; which will be the
most convenient of the two, because the upper face of this will give the hour
all the Seasons of the year, whereas the other will be only for Summer upon the
upper face of it, and will require an under face for Winter.

SECT. VIII. Hitherto of Ellipticall Dials to all Superficies whether plain or
curved, whose Indexes stand upright in the Zenith line of the place: There now
follows some other directions how the same thing may be done to any
Superficies, and to an Index set casually in any position whatsoever. But first
are premised some useful Propositions tending to the same purpose.
1. An Index or straight line being set casually, how to find the Re /
In-clination and declination thereof.
IF it stand upright, it is free from both those accidents, and falls to be the
same case with the upright Index before treated of.

But if it lie leaning, then is it to be dealt withal in this place.

And first for the re / in-clination, it is best to be taken by some
inclinatory (square or other) Instrument. The manner of the work is the very
same that is performed in finding the re / in-clination of a plain: because the
fiduciall edge of the Index is (here) like the Vertical line of a re /
in-clining plain, and the application of the Square must here be the same to
this edge that was there to the vertical line of the plain, and the degrees of
re / in-clination are to be numbered in both these cases alike. So that it will
not be needful here to make repetition of that which is so often elsewhere
declared. You are here also to observe whether the re / in-clination be toward
the North or toward the South.

Then for the declination do thus. Suppose the Index to be A B. From the end of
it that is furthest from the plain, as B, let fall or raise the perpendicular B
C, and let B C be some material object unto which the side of a Quadrant may
be applied. Or if they should be threeds (and so too weak for such a purpose)
you may extend another thread, as is D E, which may touch the two former
threeds A B and C D, and so lie in the same plain with them, and then to this
thread D E apply some upright plain or material object which may serve the
intended work.

To this new plain therefore, or to the two lines A B, C D, apply one of the
straight edges of a Quadrant, the limb of it being turned always toward the
Sun, and observe the Horizontall distance of the Sun, as is usually done in
finding the declinations of plains. Only here take this caution, that you count
not this Horizontall distance from that side of the Quadrant which is
perpendicular to the plain, but from that side which lies in the line E D, or
upon the two lines A B, B C. And further, you are always to account this
Horizontall distance from that end of the Quadrants side which looks the same
way that the point B (of the Index, which is furthest remote from the plain A
C) does look: as in the second figure is expressed, where the Horizontall
distance is more than a Quadrant, it being there to be accounted from F to H.
Or for more easy conceit, you may always suppose your Quadrant in that
posture to be continued to a Semicircle, as is done in the second figure: and
then count your Horizontall distance from that term of the Semicircles Diameter
which respects the same coast of the heavens with that point of the Index
which is most remote from the plain, which is B; that is, you must count it
from F, and so the Horizontall distance will be F G H, more than a Quadrant, in
this particular case.

The Horizontall distance being thus accounted and observed, you are
immediately to take the Suns Altitude and to find the Azimuth. Then for the
declination of the Index, that is to know into what coast of the world, that is
into what Azimuth of the Heavens (it being continued from the plain at A
infinitely forwards toward B) it would point into: I say to find this, you
have only the same work to do which is usually done in finding the declinations
of plains, the same work without any difference at all. And therefore I shall
not here give any further directions in this particular, because I have done it
often enough in other places, to which the Reader may have recourse.

And so I suppose the position of the Index in respect of re / in-clination and
declination to be fully found out, both for coast and quantity; by which two
things known, we are further to enquire what Longitude from our Meridian, and
what Latitude the said Index points unto, which will be the next Proposition.

Note, that though I call A C a plain, yet it may be any curved Superficies as
well as a plain, for the Dial will be described upon one as well as the other
indifferently.

2. By having the Re / In-clination and Declination of any right line, to find
the Longitude and Latitude thereof.
THis shall not here be much spoken of: for we may suppose the Index A B in the
first Figure, to point up to O in this Projectio^ (wherein the Horizon is N E W
S, the Zenith Z, the North Pole P) and that the reclination Z O, with the
Declination O Z S, or O Z P be known, together with Z P the complement of the
Latitude of your place, so it shall be easy thereby to find the side O P,
whose Complement is the North Latitude, or whose excess is the South Latitude
required: and the angle at P will be found also, which is the difference of
Longitude sought for.

Now in the second case before given where the Index points downwards, or under
the Horizon, where the plain is inclining, and so looking downward, we may
shape the Projection a little otherwise, and the work then will be as easy as
the former. Let n E S W be the Horizon, n the North, S the South, P the South
Pole N the Nadir point opposite to the Zenith, O the point or place to which
the Index respects. In the Triangle N P O, are given, N P the complement of
the Latitude of the place, N O the inclination of the Index; and P N O the
declination of the same Index, by which we may find P O, whose complement is
the South Latitude, or whose excess is the North Latitude required: and the
angle at P will be found, which is the difference of Longitude here sought
after.



The work is easy to them that understand the like work in re / in-clining
plains, and may be performed either by calculation, or else Instrumentally, as
every one shall like best of. And this is all that needs to be said of this
particular.

3. How to find a Meridian line, and to erect a true Axis of the World from
the foot of the Index.
THe foot of the Index I call that point where the Index enters into the Dial
^^perficies, whatsoever that superficies be, whether plain or curved. As in the
two former figures may be understo^^ by the point A.

From the foot or po^^^at A, set some upright thread which may represent the
^^^enith-line of the place, as is to be seen in that Figure Page ^^. and is
there represented by the line A D. Then one way will be to make use of some
other Meridian line, observing when the Sun comes to it, and at the same moment
to note out the shadow cast by the line A D, for that is the Meridian line. But
this is for such superficies upon which the Sun comes at noon: and it ties a
man to the Meridian moment. But without this we may (according to the four
first Precepts) set off the Meridian line P E upon the Pastboard, and by the
Zenith-line A D you may project it upon all objects that shall stand or be set
in the way. For which purpose you must place some object upon that Coast of A D
upon which any one of the Poles of the World may be projected, and also
elevated above your Dial superficies. And upon this object project the
Meridian near that place whereabout you conjecture the Axis of the World will
pass through. Then with your Semicircle (or projecting Quadrant rather)
project the Axis of the World, as is usually done in my ways of Dialling, and
by that means you shall find a point in the formerly projected Meridian, which
shall represent the Pole of the World. And then further, if from the foot of
the Index at A, to this Pole, you fasten a thread, the same thread will
represent the true Axis of the world coming from the foot of the Index.

4. Having an Axis raised from the foot of the Index, how to find in what
Longitude and Latitude the Index it self lies, by a way easier and differing
from the former, without looking after any re / in-clination or declination of
the said Index.
THis way will not prove (perhaps) so good as I expected, especially in the
Longitude, and therefore the former may be used.

The former way that I used was troublesome enough for effecting of what was by
it intended, which is the cause that I shall here endeavor to give another
more easy.

Let the Dial superficies be supposed to have upon it an Index, an Axis truly
placed, issuing from the foot of the Index, with a Meridian line projected also
to, or directly under the same Axis, according as was done in the work of the
preceding Proposition.

First then, for the Latitude of the Index, it is but enquiring what angle is
contained between the Axis and the Index, and the thing is resolved. Now to do
this, for the manner of it, we may suppose A B to be the Index, and A X to be
the Axis. Opening therefore your Compasses to any extent, set one foot of it at
A, and suppose the other to reach up to m upon the Axis, at which point m
fasten some knot of thread, which may first be put on, and then slipped to the
point of the Compasses at m. So again, set on the same extent from A to n upon
the Index. and at n fasten another knot of thread. Then also to the same extent
open the Radius of a line of Chords. When this is done, take the distance
between the two knots m and n, and measuring it upon the same line of Chords,
you shall find what angle is contained between X A and A B. If A X therefore
point from A toward the North Pole, and that X A B be less than a Quadrant,
then does the complement of that angle X A B give the North Latitude whereinto
the Index points: but if X A B be more than a Quadrant, then does the excess
give that South Latitude whereinto the Index points. And so contrarily, if A
X had pointed from A toward the South Pole, then the angle X A B being less
than a Quadrant would give the quantity of South Latitude: but if X A B had
been greater than a Quadrant, then the excess would give the North Latitude
into which the Index tends.

All the difficulty in this work is, that there is no stable place whereon to
fix the Compasses for measuring of the distance between the two knots m and n:
but you may hold something underneath close to one of the points (without
disturbing the threeds place) on which setting one foot of your Compasses, you
may measure the distance of the other point. Or else, because it is supposed
that the thread Axis A X is fixed upon some solid thing at X, you may open your
Compasses to the Radius A X (to which also you are to have a Radius of Chords
equal) and set the same extent from A to R upon the Index (prolonging the
Index if need be by a thread till it come to be of a competent length) and
there fasten a slipping knot. Then because X is a stable point, you may take
the extent from X (setting one foot of your Compasses in that point) to R, and
measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, where it will give the former angle
X A R, which is to be used as is showed before.

There will be found other ways to do this last work. So much therefore for
the Latitude.

Secondly, For the Longitude of the Index, it will not be so easily had as the
other was. The way that best likes me (amongst many others) for the present, is
this. By the Precepts, Page 70. you must make some observation of the Sun's
Azimuth (and so must you also do by the last precedent Proposition) and you
find what Azimuth that is too. You may also (further) project it upon your
Dial superficies, and then you have two Azimuths upon the said superficies,
namely, the Meridian, and the observed Azimuth. You are to know yet further,
what Altitudes the Equinoctial has upon these two Azimuths. And for the
Meridian it is certain enough that the Altitude there, is equal to the
complement of your Latitude. For the other Azimuth say thus.

As the Radius, Is to the Co-tangent of your Latitude;

So is the Cosine of your Azimuth, To the Tangent of the Equinoctials altitude
upon that Azimuth Circle.

After this you must make some mark or knot upon your Axis A X, which suppose
to be at m, and then with your projecting Quadrant (upon your Meridian and
Azimuth) from the point m, set on the respective Equinoctial Altitudes, as the
manner of projecting by that Instrument uses to be.

Next, you must project this Equinoctial Circle all over the Diall-superficies
(and upon some other objects where need shall be,) suppose it here to be the
line S V.

And furthermore, you are to project the Axis A X, and the Index A B, one upon
the other, and to observe the line that they both (in that position) do make
upon the Diall-superficies, and other objects if need be. I say you must,
first, principally observe this line, for it is the proper Meridian line to the
Index or Zenith line A B, because it passes ( quoad superficiem) through both
the Axis of the world and the Zenith line. Suppose it in the former plain to be
A. And secondly you must note the intersection that this line makes with the
Equinoctial line which was now projected, which we may imagine to be at V,
upon some object laid in the way of purpose. And so also you must (thirdly)
take notice of the intersection of the Equinoctial line with the Meridian
line, which suppose at S. For these two Equinoctial intersections and the
point m, all three together, must do what we now intend.

The thing here now intended is, to know what angle is contained between the
two superficies X A B, and X A T, which are two Meridian circles, or (which is
the same) the angle V m S in the plain of the Equinoctial, which angle
measures the said inclination of the two forenamed Meridians, as it does of all
Meridians.

Now to measure this angle V m S, the best way will be first to extend two
threeds, one from V to m, and the other from S to m, crossing each other at m,
and they may be continued further till they meet with some object (in the way
standing, or else set for that purpose) where they may be both fixed as at F
and G. Then measure from S to m, and from V to m, which is the shortest,
suppose S m to be the shortest, and V m the longest. First, take V m, and lay
it down in a line, as there is done. Then take S m, and measure it on the same
line from M to S or D. Thirdly, take the distance from V to D out of this line,
and set it from V to D, upon the line V m, so shall m S and m D be equal one
to the other. To this distance therefore m S or m D as a Radius, open some line
of Chords, then take the Chord or subtense from S to D (S is a stable point
upon which you may firmly set your Compasses) and measure the same length upon
your line of Chords, where you shall see how many degrees the angle S m D or S
m V contains.

Now all this business is to find how great an angle is contained between the
South part of the Meridian of the place, and the Meridian belonging properly to
the Zenith line. But here (if it be observed well) the angle now measured is
made between the proper Meridian and the North part of the Meridian of the
place, so that this angle must be the supplement (to a Semicircle) of what is
required. The supplement therefore of the angle now found, is (in this case)
the Longitude or Meridian into which the Zenith line A B points. I say the
supplement of that angle is the proper Meridian of the Zenith line; or the
difference of Longitude proper to that line, from the Meridian of the place.
But forasmuch as the angle V m S does measure the inclination or angle of this
proper Meridian from the North part of the Meridian of the place, and that the
shadow of the Index A B does first come to the proper Meridian A O before it
comes to A T the Meridian of the place: we may therefore in such case say, that
the angle V m S gives the difference of Longitude; and that the said difference
of Longitude lies Eastward from the South part of the Meridian of the place, as
there in the Figure it appears to lie Westward from the North part. Suppose
that the difference of Longitude were 39 gr. 25 min. and the proper Latitude 40
gr. And so much for this also.

If this way be thought not feasible enough, the former in the second
Proposition may be used; yet variety in all kinds is delightful, and not to
be rejected in this. It is done, you see, without having respect to any
declination or re / in-clination, which the former was founded upon.

5. How to form the Angles at the Pole.

Latitude differing from the Latitude of your place. After that the difference
of Longitude is known, you are first to frame a Table of angles at the Pole,
which will not be hard to perform, and the manner of it will be seen best in an
Example, being altogether like the computation of the said angles at the Pole
for the hours of any place to the same declining plain.

I have here first of all in a general Table set down the graduall distances
of hours and quarters from 12 at noon or midday, which will be some help in
performing the work. The hours that are on the left side of the degrees are
the East or forenoon hours, and those on the right hand are the West or
afternoon hours. Suppose (as before Prop. 4.) a difference of Longitude were
given 39 gr. 25 min. toward the East, and it were required to know what angles
our hours (namely those 12 that stand nearest to it, six upon one side, and six
upon the other) with their intermediate quarters do make with this Longitude or
Proper Meridian, for so I intend to call it.

I first take the given Longitude or Proper Meridian, 39 gr. 25 min and enter
it among the East hours of the general Table, and I since it to fall in at A;
that is, between a quarter and half an hour past 9 before noon, and I find
also the circumstant numbers to be 37.30 the lesser, and 41.15 the greater. The
differences between these two numbers and the Longitude given, are 1 gr. 55
min. and 1 gr. 50 min. as you see them set down in the said general Table
right against the letter A.

These two differences are to be first placed in this second Table of Angles at
the Pole, as you see in the Example, where, first of all is written Proper
Meridian 00.00 separated from the rest as signifying only the place where it is
to stand, and above it is placed (the difference between 37.30 and the proper
Meridian 39.25, namely) 1 gr. 55 min. So again, below it is placed 1 gr. 50
min. (which is the difference of 39 gr. 25 min. the proper Meridian from the
next greater number 41 gr. 15 min.) Now to these two radical numbers, I add
and one whole hour, namely a, b, c, and thereby produce e, f, g, on both sides
the proper Meridian. Then to r, e, f, g, I add 15 gr. d, namely, the number of
one hour, and thereby do further produce h, i, k, l, on both sides the Proper
Meridian, as before. And afterward for more ease, to the numbers r, e, f, g,
h, i, k, l, I add 30 gr. or two hours, and do thereby produce on both sides
the eight numbers noted with the letter m. And so still adding 30 gr. to the
last eight numbers noted with m, or else adding 60 gr. to the first eight
numbers noted with r, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, I shall make the eight remaining
numbers noted with the letter n, both above and below, on both sides the Proper
Meridian. And so this Table of Angles at the Pole is completed, for if it
should (in the same manner) be further continued, the next numbers (above)
would be 91 gr. 55 min. and (below) 91 gr. 50 min. both greater than 90 gr.
beyond which there will be neither need nor expedience to go.

This way of forming the angles I thought best to take, because it is more
plain and easy than any other, which else might have been in this work used.

You are afterward to place the hours (in this last Table) about the Proper
Meridian, just as you see their order to be about the letter A in the general
Table, and as you see they are in this particular Table of Angles at the Pole.

The like work serves for West Longitudes.

Thus you have the angles for 12 hours and their quarters, the same angles
serve for the other 12 hours: and whatsoever is hereafter computed for any of
these 12 hours, must be understood to serve also for the 12 opposites, and so
the work will be done for the whole Circle, or 24 hours of the natural day.

6. By knowing the angles at the Pole, and the Latitude of the place or
Horizon, how to find the Horizontall Spaces thereto belonging.
WE must suppose that this Longitude or Meridian which we have before
mentioned, is proper to some Horizon or other, above which also the elevation
of the Pole must be imagined known, which we may suppose to be 40 gr. as
before, Prop. 4. In respect of this plain or Horizon it is, that the Spaces now
mentioned are called Horizontall Spaces.

The way to find them for this Ellipticall work is converse to that which is
usual in declining plains. Namely thus,

As the Sine of the Poles elevation above this Horizon or Plain, Is to the
Radius;

So is the Tangent of each of these angles at the Pole, To the Tangent of the
Horizontall space belonging to each of those foresaid angles.

So having found all these Horizontall spaces severally by this form of
calculation, you may set them into a Table, as here you see it done in the
first of the two main Columns. They signify the distances of every of the
hours and quarters from the proper Meridian, and are to be accounted as
numbered in the degrees of the said plain or Horizon.

7. By knowing the angles at the Pole, and the Latitude of the plain or
Horizon, how to find the Equinoctial Altitudes or depressions (above or under
the same Horizon) due to the said Angles at the Pole or points of the
Equinoctial.
THe proportion by which this is to be effected is this.

As the Radius, Is to the Cosine of the Poles elevation above the plain or
Horizon;

So is the Cosine of any of the Angles specified in the former Table of Angles
at the Pole; To the Sine of the Altitude required, and due to that angle, or
hour (rather) in the Equinoctial Circle.

So in the former example. The Latitude or elevation of the Pole above the
Horizon was 40 gr. the complement of that is 50 gr. which is the Meridian
altitude and depression of the Equinoctial Circle above and under the said
Horizon or plain, and is therefore to be set for the altitude of the proper
Meridian. Now,

As the Radius, Is to the altitude of 50 gr.

So is the Cosine of every angle at the Pole, or arc of the Equinoctial in
the former Table, To the Altitude due thereunto.

And note that r e f g h, etc. below the propet Meridian in the Table of
Angles, are complements to n n n n n, etc. at the top of the Table of Angles:
and again, those r e f g h, etc. above the proper Meridian, are complements to
the lowest n n n n n, etc. successively rising in order one after the other. So
that, As the Radius, Is to the Sine of 50 gr. So is the Sine of p q r, etc. To
the Sines of the Altitudes belonging to s t v, etc. And so again, the Sines of
w x y, etc. to the Sines of the Altitudes belonging to z u st, etc. And
accordingly this Table of Altitudes and depressions is calculated.

If the Pole be elevated upon the plain or Horizon, above 50 gr. it will be
sufficient to compute these two Tables to half hours only, and so to save
half your labor. But in lesser elevations it is best to do it to quarters, as
here is done n this Example.

8. How to find the proper Meridian line duly belonging to any Zenith line
casually placed, and to draw it upon the plain.
THough the 4. Proposition be not made use of for finding the Longitude and
Latitude (which of due pertains to any Zenith line) but instead of it the
second precedent be thought most fit to be used; yet so much of the fourth will
be best to be used, as shall concern the finding out of the proper Meridian
line. That is, you must raise an Axis from the foot of the Index, as is A X,
and then projecting this Axis A X and the Index A B one upon the other, as if
they were both one, you shall thereby also project (by them both together) the
Proper Meridian belonging to the Zenith line A B, such as (in the figure of the
fourth) is A O, which must be drawn upon the plain accordingly. The manner, of
all the particular workings that do hereunto tend, is set down in the fourth
precedent Proposition, and therefore will not here again need to be repeated.

9. How to draw and divide the Elli^sis into hours and quarters, to an Index
casually set, whose Latitude and difference of Longitude is discovered by the
former works.
WHen you know the position of your Index in respect of Longitude and Latitude,
you may then compute two Tables to the same Meridian or difference of
Longitude, and to the Latitude of your Index, as is done before in the 7
Proposition, one of which Tables is of Horizontall Spaces, the other of
Equinoctial Altitudes or Depressions above and under that Horizon which is
proper to the Index or Zenith line casually placed.

By these two Tables the work will be done in such manner as was showed before,
Prop. 2. The manner of the work is this.

1. You are to assume some point in your Index A B, let the point be C, where
you may fasten some knot of thread that it may not be lost again.

2. From this point you must draw an Horizontall line, not in the level of
your own Horizon, but in that Horizon which is proper to that Index or Zenith
line A B: that is, it must lie perpendicular to A B, making right angles (in
every part of it) to that line, and must have respect (in this
perpendicularity) to the point C. The meaning is, you must imagine a plain to
pass through the point C, and the same plain to be perpendicular to the line A
B; or that the line A B is a perpendicular surgent line to the said plain
passing through the point at C.

Now this work will be somewhat hard to perform if A B be a thread only, and
not of some more sturdy substance. Yet the best of it is, that there is no very
great preciseness here required, for the work to be done will be good though
this Horizontall plain be not placed so exactly perpendicular.

[And so it may be noted, that if other Dials be described by the Equinoctial
Circle and not by the Horizontall, the work of drawing the Equinoctial
perpendicular to the Axis will be difficult, but though no great accuratenesse
be used, yet the work will be perfect enough, and no way defective for the
loss of a degree or two in the perpendicularity required, which I thought good
here also to note, because I have omitted it in all my other Precepts of
Projecting Dials.]

Wherefore you may do it by some Pastboard, applying one edge of it to any line
projected from A B the Index, as to A D, and keeping the edge there, you may
turn the flat of it to the Index A B, and draw a line by it, or make two pricks
through it into the pastboard, whereby a line may be drawn, but above all note
the point C upon it. Then to this line of the Index thus drawn, and from the
noted point of it at C, erect a perpendicular: So applying your Pastboard to
its former place again (the edge of it lying upon A D, and the flat of it
applied to the Index A B, and the point in it, noted for C, being again fitted
to C in the Index, I say thus doing) you may note where the last drawn
perpendicular does cut the line A D (which must be extended by help of some
thread if need be) suppose at E: at the point E (then) you must say that one
point of the proper Horizontall line is to be taken. Then in like manner you
must seek another Horizontall point: first by projecting a line from the Index
(any where) such as is A F, and by applying one edge of a pastboard to that
line, and the plain of that pastboard to the Index A B, and so noting the point
C, and drawing or marking the line A B upon it, etc. as was done before. So you
shall find another point of the same Horizontal line or plain (rather) which
suppose to fall at F.

Now having three points of the Horizontall plain at C, E, and F, (which I
suppose not to lie in one and the same right line, for that must with
carfulness be avoided here) you may project some part of that line upon the
plain, as E F, the rest of it (so much as shall be found useful) may be made
up with returns of thread, and regulated or kept in the same plain by
projection, as the manner of working that way uses to be, and as here you see
expressed, by the line H E F G, lying in the same plain with the point C, and
that whole plain lying perpendicular to the Index A B.



3. The next thing to be done is the drawing of the hour lines upon the plain.
And the first thing h^re presupposed to be done, is the drawing of the proper
Meridian, performed by the 8 Prop. That (I say) is supposed as already done
before any of this work is begun. Let the proper Meridian be A V. Having then
made Tables (by the 7 Prop.) for the Horizontall Spaces of your hours from this
proper Meridian A B; you must first apply a pastboard to the Horizontall line E
F, and fit the center of it to C: and upon the Pastboard, project the proper
Meridian from C to A V, or from C to P. And then by the Table of Horizontall
Spaces in the 7 Prop. (for we now here suppose that this is the Dial for which
those Tables were computed) you may (upon that pastboard) set off all the
hours and quarters from the proper Meridian upon this pastboard: and applying
the pastboard into its proper place, namely to the Horizontall line E P F, and
to the point C, you may project the hours and parts of hours from the
Pastboard to the horizontall line H E P F G, as the manner in this way of
Dialling is well known.

4. Having transferred the houre-points into the Horizontall line, you may (by
help of your Index A B) project and draw the hour lines upon the plain, which
we will suppose done, because the manner of doing it is the same with that
which was done before for upright Indexes.

5. To know where the Ellipticall line must come, or to find the points in
those hour lines, through which it must pass, we must work in the same manner
as before (in the 7 of Page 7^.) is expressed, namely thus. We must make a Scale
of right Sines of a fit length, and number them Versedly, and out of that Scale
we must take such Altitudes or Profundities (which you will, one or both) as
the Table Page 97. gives, which Table we here suppose to be computed for this
Example whereabout we now are. And taking these Altitudes from that Scale (that
is, from the end at 90, to the altitude numbered upon the parts of the Scale)
we must insert them into their respective hours to which they belong. They
must be inserted in this manner. Having taken any altitude out of the Scale,
and found the hour upon which it must be placed, you must set one foot of that
extent upon the hour line (keeping it always thereon, but) removing it until
the other foot being turned about, may only touch the fiduciall edge of the
Index: and when the feet of the Compasses are thus fitted, you must note upon
what point of the hour line the foot that is thereon does stand, for through
that point of that hour must the Ellipticall line pass.

The same manner of work you must perform upon every hour, until you have
gone through 12 of them, which do make up half the hours of the whole Dial.
And if you strike the lines through the center, you shall have all the 24. And
look what is done upon any one hour line, the same is to be done upon the
opposite. That is, look what distance (upon a plain) the Ellipsis has from
the center upon any one line, the self same distance from the center must the
opposite line have. But if the description be made upon an uneven superficies,
then this rule may not, perhaps, hold: yet this will; namely, Look what
distance from the Index (the least or perpendicular Index I mean) any point of
the Ellipsis has, the same perpendicular distance is to be given for the
Ellipsis upon the opposite hour line. And by this means you may put in as many
hours and Ellipticall points as you please. And through these points you are
to draw the Ellipticall line.

10. Concerning the motion that is to be made, either by the Index, or by the
Ellipsis it self.
THe motion must be either in, or else parallel to, the proper Meridian, and
not elsewhere. Now if the Dial Superficies be made to slide, and the Index
stand still; then (though the Dial be upon an unequal superficies, yet) the
motion or sliding must be upon a plain. And it must be upon the proper
Meridian, projected by the Index from the Dial plate, unto or upon that said
plain, and the motion must be in or parallel to it. And it must be noted, that
this proper Meridian thus projected never falls directly under any Index that
is (not direct but) declining, but it falls aside from it, according as the
Index stands aside from the proper Meridian upon the Dial superficies, and as
it shall be laid by projecting it.

But if the Index move (the Dial standing still) then the fiduciall edge of it
must be made to move always according to, and in the very proper Meridian line
it self, and not any where else, which may be contrived sundry ways, as every
man shall invent to his own liking. Great care must be had that the fiduciall
edge of the Index (in the motion of it) keep always one justly parallel
situation.

11. Of the place of the Suns Annual course or Zodiac.
THe best place for it is to be considered of according to that which moves.

If the Dial Superficies move, it must (though it be rough (as I said before)
yet it must) move upon a plain, this plain therefore in this case is fittest to
receive the Zodiac. And then there may a peculiar point or thread Index
(serving only for the Zodiac) be set upon the Diall-moving-plate, whereby it
may be rectified according to the time of the year.

If the Index be made to move, then either the Zodiac may be set upon the foot
of the Index which guides the motion of it, and the peculiar or Zodiacall Index
may be set somewhere where it may stand to point at the Zodiac. Or else the
Zodiac it self may have its place upon some part of the standing plate or
body, and the Zodiacall Index may be placed upon the foot of the Dial Index;
from whence it may be made to show the Zodiacall parts, as occasion shall be.

12. How the Zodiac is to be limited in regard of length, and how to be
described and set in its true place.
THe limitation of it must be according to the Scale of Sines by which the
Ellipsis is described, which Scale is mentioned Page 102 5. and Page 73 7*

The Index or Dial plate (that is the mover) must move according to the proper
Meridian of the Dial Superficies, and precisely so, as that fiducial edge of
the Index must move (not elsewhere, but) in the very proper Meridian it self.
This is, if the Index move. But if the Dial Superficies move, then the proper
Meridian thereof (or the Superficies of the proper Meridian, namely the
Superficies made by the proper Meridian cutting through the Dial plate, which
is of any thickness) must move directly upon, or through, the fiduciall edge
of the Index. These things are intimated before. And that the Zodiac is to be
described upon a plain, though the Dial it self be not so. And further, that
if the Dial plate move, (though it be not a plain it self, yet) it must move
upon a plain, and that the proper Meridian is to be described upon the same
plain, and the motion to be directed according thereunto. These things are
often inculcated, because they are hard to be conceived, and had need of the
better consideration for that reason. Now further.

1. If the Dial plate be supposed thus to move upon a plain, and on it the
proper Meridian be drawn, then first of all, The angle is to be inquired that
is made between the Index and that part of the proper Meridian which is
projected upon the plain whereon the motion is made, which how to measure will
be a hard matter to give rules for, because the variety of cases and positions
of one to the other will be so various. It is first to be supposed, that it
makes a just right angle with it, and consequently that the Zodiac is described
upon the proper horizon of the Index. And if upon this supposition the Zodiac
be to be limited, then the rule will be the same with the former given in the
like case, namely thus. Upon your Scale of Sines (by which you described your
Ellipticall line) take from 90, to the Latitude of the Index, and count that
length for a new Radius, and keep it. Then when you have found the forenamed
angle (of finding which more is said Prop. 13. following) to this new Radius
find the Secant of the complement or excess of that angle: this length or
Secant will be the Tangent of 45 gr. or the Decimall Scale by which you are to
describe the Zodiac on both sides from the Equinoctial point or line,
according to the numbers in the general Tables made for this purpose, Page 4,
5, 6, and 7.

[For placing the Equinoctial point in the Zodiac (upon which all the other
parts of that Scale do depend) you must set all in the same posture that they
had when the Dial was described: and when you have made fit place for the
Zodiac, and set on some peculiar Zodiacall Index, you must note the place upon
which the said Zodiacall Index points, for that place is the peculiar place
for the Equinoctial, from whence all the other parts of the Suns annual
course must be set on.]

2. If the Index be made to move in any depth under the Dial superficies, then
a slit must be made in the same Superficies that the proper Meridian would cut,
and the Index continued therein, down into one straight line till it meet with
the foot whereon the Index is fixed, and which being moved, carries the Index
along with it. And the Zodiac must be described either upon this foot (the
Zodiacall Index being made to stand still while that said foot with its
divisions moves) and that also parallel to (or in) the proper Meridian
projected upon it: or else the foot must carry the Zodiacall Index, and the
Zodiac must be described upon some other convenient place, as the sides (etc.)
of that forementioned flat. And here, for limitation of the Zodiacs length, you
must find the Inclination of this moving foot to the Index or Zenith line
(which angle of inclination is mentioned before, and spoken of afterward in
the 13 Prop. following) and work directly as you did before by finding the new
Radius, and the Secant of the complement (or excess) of the angle. By which
you shall find the Tangent of 45 gr. or the length of your Decimall Scale, out
of which the Zodiac may be described by the Tables* Page 4, 5, etc. as is
mentioned before in this proposition. Thus (in these cases) is the Zodiac to be
set in its true place, thus it is to be limited and d^scribed.

For Occurrences of other sorts of Cases than are here mentioned (whereof there
will not be many) he that can understand to do these things aright, will be
able to grapple with them; and for such as do not understand what is here said,
their best course is to let these difficulties alone.

13. How to find what angle is made between the Index and that part of the
proper Meridian which is projected upon the plain whereon the motion is made,
or which drawn upon the foot of the Index which makes the same motion.
THe way that for the present I think of is this. Apply a straight edge of
pastboard to the projected line, and the plain of the same pastboard to the
fiduciall edge of the Index, and make two points upon the pastboard, by or
through which the same fiduciall edge passes. Then taking away the Pastboard,
draw a straight line through those two points or marks, and so measure the
angle made between the forenamed edge of the pastboard and this right line. If
it be so that the line crosses not the edge of the Pastboar^, then draw such a
parallel line to the edge as may cross the former line, and then with a Scale
of Chords you may measure the angle.

14. Further observations concerning the motion and daily fitting of the Dial
and Index, for setting them true.
THe best way is to make the Dial plate move, and the Index to stand still (in
these obliquely situated Indexes) for the Zodiac will (in such cases) be most
easily described and made useful. And in this case the Index may be also set
fast first, and quite finished before the Dial be drawn at all. Then also the
Dial will be drawn more easily, and the motion of the Dial plate may sooner
(this way) be contrived, then can the motion of the Index be contrived when the
said Index is to move and the Dial stand still. The motion (as has been often
said) must be according (that is parallel) to the proper Meridian: and the slit
(for the fiduciall edge of the Index) may be so contrived that the fiduciall
edge it self (which is best to be a fine thread) may be also the proper Index,
and the Zodiac may be described upon the Diall-moving-plate, closely contrived
to the thread. Or thus at least, The lenght of the whole Zodiac may be so
limited as is before mentioned, and then if you desire to have it drawn upon
some other place of the plain upon which the Dial superficies moves, and the
same Dial plate to carry the peculiar Index for the Zodiac; then (I say) by
these two terms prefixed to the length of the Zodiac (by the fiduciall edge of
the Index) having reference to the Diall-moving-plate (as before) you may
determine the length of the same Zodiac upon the standing plate whereon the
Dial plate moves, for the new Zodiacall Index set fast into the moving plate,
will (upon the standing plate) show the terms of the same Zodiac suting with
the terms upon the moving plate fitted to the standing Index. This will be
direction enough because one way may serve as well as many. Yet I doubt not to
set down many more which would be without end, if they were all put together,
for inventions in this kind would be too too many.

2. If the Index be thought best to move, then must a pattern of it (that is
some thread) be first set up. And to this vice-Index must the Dial be
described upon the plain (or whatever curved Superficies it be.) And the Zodiac
is best to be fitted either upon the plain whereon the foot of the Index is to
move (for a plain it must move upon, whatever be the Superficies whereon the
Dial is described) and that same foot to carry the Zodiacall Index upon it; or
else upon the foot of the Index, and the Zodiacall or peculiar Index to stand
fixed upon the plain (or Dial superficies) And then when all this is done, the
vice-Index must be taken away and a true substantial Index put in the place of
it. And for that purpose, you were best, before you take it away, to find at
what elevation it stood from the plain, and likewise to draw the perpendicular
just under it. For by these two helps you may set up a true substantial Index,
regulating it thereby into the same position; which to do, must be left to the
judgment of every man to contrive as he shall see requisite.

But in both these ways care must be had what inclination the Zodiacall Scale
has to the Index, according to what is said in the 13 Prop.

3. It must here again be taken for a Rule, thot a plain, if it lie parallel to
the index is not possibly capable of these kinds of Ellipticall hours, but
the Index must have some inclination to the plain, and make some angle with the
same.

4. All these Precepts do serve to make such Dials as are upon fixed walls or
Superficies that cannot be removed. But if it be to be done for moveable
Bodies, if they be regularly cut, then the declinations of every of the plains
are known by their regularity; so that such plains of them as are capable of
any Dial before mentioned (for the Index and the plain must not be parallel in
any case, they may be perpendicular) may have such Dials upon them as they are
capable of, either to Indexes perpendicular to their plains, or to Indexes
lying in the Zenith line of the place. But for these casual Indexes upon them,
you will be put to it, to know what declinations they have from the Meridian
upon the regular body (for I suppose that there is a Meridian drawn upon some
one of the plains or other.) The way that for the present I think upon is this.
Set the Body upon the foot true in respect of horizontall or upright position,
that is, let the foot of it stand upon some just horizontall plain, though in
respect of declination it stand at all adventures. Then from the fiduciall edge
of your casual Index, let fall a perpendicular (I mean perpendicular to the
Horizon of the place, not to the plain) and to that perpendicular point, from
the point of the Indexes concourse with the plain, draw a right line; this line
shall represent the Azimuth wherein the said Index lies. Then again, with your
eye repose a perpendicular hanging thread upon the two points (namely, the
center or concourse of the Index with the plain, and the late found
perpendicular point) both together, and project the umbrage of the thread so
hanging upon the Horizontall plain. So also you must repose the shadow of some
one of the Cocks or Axes with your eye, upon the Meridian or line of 12, and
then also the perpendicular thread must be projected upon them both joined
before into one, so that Thread, Style, and Meridian must now be all as one
line; and the thread so hanging project the shadow of it upon the same
Horizontall plain. Now these two lines thus projected either do concur and make
an angle, or else (by drawing a parallel to one of them through the other) they
must be made to concur, and look what angle they make at their concurrence,
the same being counted the right way is the angle of the casual Indexes
declination from the Meridian line. Thus the Declination is found.

Then the Reclination may be found as before is declared, and by help of them
the Longitude and Latitude of the Index may be had, and so the Dial made by
the precedent Precepts.

A brief DEMONSTRATION of the 7th. and 8th. Sections.
IN the 7 all are made to the Zenith line of the place. If therefore you
imagine an Horizontall Ellipsis to be described to that Zenith line, and upon
that Ellipsis a kind of compressed Cylinder to rise upright, parallel to the
said Zenith line, with hour lines raised from the several points of the
Horizontall Ellipsis, then will the Zenith line show the hour upon those
surgent lines: and the same Index (or Zenith line) must show the hour among
those upright lines in the compressed Cylinder, by the same reason that it does
upon the Ellipsis it self, upon which the said Cylinder is raised, And if so,
then it matters not what part of these lines is taken in for this use, since
any one point of them will serve to do the work. The way therefore that is used
for the projecting of these hours (by help of the Table in 29 Page.) as it will
serve to find the Ellipticall points upon the Horizontall plain it self, so
must it serve to find some one point of these surgent hour lines upon any
other Superficies, because they keep the same distances always from the
Zenith line (from whence the projection of them is made, and whereon they
depend altogether) and therefore it finds (upon any Superficies) the points of
those lines which pass through, or do intersect the Dial Superficies.
Therefore it is that these Ellipticall points (upon all Superficies) are points
of those surgent lines rising from the Horizontall plain, and that the Zenith
line must have the same relation and situation to them, that it had to the
points upon the Horizontall plain it self, And consequently, that this way
must be of the same truth upon any Superficies that it is upon the Horizontall.
So much for any upright Index, set upon all sorts of Superficies, with the
hours thereon depending.

In the 8. are handled casual Indexes; which if well considered will fall to
be the same with them in the 7. For the Table of Angles and Altitudes by which
they are made, are calculated to that Horizon which is proper to the Index,
considered as a Zenith line. And so from that Horizon we may imagine the like
surgent lines to rise all parallel to the Index or Zenith line, and the very
same reason to hold in these, that held in the former.

To the Reader that shall have the view of this first draught of Precepts.
THese Rules here given may seem to be stuffed with many impertinencies, and
some need less difficulties, which the Author acknowledges wil^ingly, and
excuses, by reason that they were his first med^tat^ons in th^s kind; and so
much the more undigested by how much the less pra^^^se has been by him used
therein. The truth is, he never described any thing suitable to the Cases of
these two last Sections. And if the Reader be any way able to discern what it
is to write upon a Mathematical Subject wherein has preceded no real
^epresentation, he will not only excused difficulties and impert^nencies in the
trad^tion, but will wonder if there be not some miscarriages in point of truth:
of which (notwithstanding) the Author is confident this Treatise is clear.

15. Having placed a Dial plate to move (let the Coast of the motion be
casual^) how to fit a steadfast Index to it, and to describe an Ellipticall
Dial upon the said moving plain.
THis Case was forgotten before, but now here supplied. You must observe the
line (upon the immovable plate) which the midst of the moving plate does
describe, and suppose that line to be the proper Meridian. Then from some
convenient point of that proper Meridian, raise a true Axis. Project the Axis
upon the proper Meridian, and from any point of the said Meridian raise a
thread (or Index) any where, only so as that both this Thread, the Axis, and
the Proper Meridian may all three appear in one line. There six the thread, and
then find the Longitude and Latitude of it, and afterward describe the Dial
to it, according to the rules given before.

16. If an Index should be set up and made moveable upon a standing plain,
there can no Dial be described thereto,
Unless the Index be made of wire or some such bending substance, but to such
there may. For if you observe what straight line the foot makes in its motion,
you must count that as the proper Meridian, and so setting up an Axis to some
point of it, you may put in an Index into that foot, so as the Axis, and
fiduciall edge of the Index, and the Proper Meridian, may all three appear in
one line. And then finish your work as is before directed.

CIRCULAR Horologiography.

SHOWING, How to make an Horizontall Dial in a Circle equally divided, to show
the Hour of the day, and Azimuth of the Sun.

Invented and written by Mr. SAMVEL FOSTER, Late professor of Astronomy in
Gresham-Colledge.



London, Printed for Nicholas Bourn. 1654.

CIRCULAR Horologiography.
How to make an Horizontall Dial in a Circle equally divided, to show the
Hour of the day, and Azimuth of the Sun.
HEre before we have had ELLIPTICAL HOROLOGIOGRAPHY, now shall follow CIRCULAR
HOROLOGIOGRAPHY, which shows how to make a Dial in a perfect Circle equally
divided into hours, (whereby to find the hour) upon any plain whatsoever.

Divide a Circle into 24 equal parts, and take so many of them as your Horizon
has hours in the longest day, or rather so many as the degrees of your
greatest Amplitude (East and West) from the South do arise unto; which here at
London will be near 18 of them. Then divide each of these parts into 15, which
for the Azimuth will signify degrees, for the hour will stand for four
minutes of time apiece.

The altitude of the Horary Index may thus be found.
Add your Latitude to 90 gr. half that sum is the elevation of the Horary
Index above the Horizon. Thus at London, ^ 45 min. which is the altitude or
elevation required. Or, add half the complement of your Latitude (which is
19) to your Latitude (51) the sum (70) is the elevation of the Index.

The standing and looking of it.
It must stand right over the line of 12, elevated above the said line 70 gr.
and must look toward (but not into) the North Pole.

The motion of the Horary Index.
It must move to and fro, directly over the line of 12. Or else the hours must
move to and from it, according to the line of 12, so as that the same line may
always lie under the foot of the said Index. The motion of the one or the
other is necessary, because else the Circle of equal parts can never show the
true hour all the year long.

How the Zodiac is to be limited, and laid, and charactred.
The motion of the Index must be regulated by the Zodiac. The Zodiac therefore
must lie either in, or else parallel to the Meridian line. The length of it is
thus to be limited. Count the Semidiameter of your Circle ( viz. A B) for the
Radius: to that Radius, Either

1. Make the Sine of 70 (taken to the Radius of your Circle) a Tangent of 70;
and to the Radius of that Tangent find the Secant of 19 (the complement of 70)
that length shall be the Radius of the degrees, or the Decimall of the Tangents
of the Zodiac, to be inserted by the Tables Page 4, 5, 6, and 7.

2. Or else, Make the Sine of 19 (estimated to the Semidiameter of the Circle A
B as Radius) a Radius, and to that Radius find the Secant of 191, this last
length or Secant shall be the quantity of the Tangent of 45 gr. or of the
Decimall Scale by which the numbers Page 4, 5, etc. are to be inserted. And in
these Northern Horizons and must be placed so that 12 may be nearest to the
Index in Summer, and furthest off in Winter.

The manner how to fashion the Cock which holds the Index.
The fashion may be seen by the figure A C D. At A is the place of the
fiduciall point of the foot of the Index to be assigned: and in that point a
hole must be pierced, and a thread fixed. Then the Cock must have two holes
more pierced, one at C, the other at D, both to stand perpendicularly over the
line of 12. That at C must be so placed, that the angle C A B may be 70 gr.
That at D must be placed so, that D A B may be an angle of 90 gr.



How to place this Dial for use.
YOu must either fix your Dial plate in the Meridian line, and truly
Horizontall* or else upon an Horizontall or level flat you must draw a Meridan
line, whereby to place it upon any occasion. Then,

To find the Hour.
Make use of the Index A C, and rectify the foot of the Index to the requisite
place in the Zodiac, (either to the day of the month, or the degree of the
Sign.) When it is thus rectified and set, the shadow of the thread A C will
show the hour of the day.

To find the Azimuth.
Put the thread from A to D, and let A D be your Index. Then (always) place
the foot of the thread in the center of the Circle at A, So shall the thread A
D give the Azimuth.

Note, That the Scales of Declination, Amplitude, Ascensionall difference, may
be placed by the Zodiac, and used as is before showed in the Ellipticall Dials.

Another way to make the same Horizontall Dial equally divided, to find the
Hour and Azimuth.
THe former way makes the Index to point up near to the elevated Pole. This
other will require the Index to point toward the contrary Coast, namely, that
of Noon or Mid day, or toward (but not into) that Coast of the heavens where is
the depressed Pole under the Horizon, but still the Index is to be above the
Horizon.

The altitude of the horary Index above the Horizon, must be half the
complement of the Latitude, or half the height of the Equinoctial. Here at
London 19 gr. which is the complement of the former ways elevation 70

The standing and looking of it, must be right over the line of 12, drawn out
at competent length, and must justly point into the Coast of 12 mid day: Or
toward (but not into) the South (or depressed) Pole.

It must move as the former did.

The Zodiac is to be laid as before, and to be limited and charactered thus.
The Semidiameter of your Circle being taken for Radius, you must use the two
former rules in this manner.

1. Either make the Sine of 19 a Tangent of 19, and to the Radius of that
Tangent find the Secant of (the complement of 19, namely) 70, that length
shall be the Radius of the degrees, or else the Decimall Scale of the Tangents
of the Zodiac, and they must be inserted by the Tables Page 4, 5, etc.

2. Or else, make the Sine of 70 (estimated to the Semidiameter of the Circle A
B as to a Radius) to be a Radius; and to that Radius find the Secant of 70,
this last length or Secant, shall be the length of the Tangent of 45 gr. or of
the Decimall Scale, by which the numbers in the Tables Page 4, 5, etc. are to
be inserted.

By this instance for the Horizon of London, where the numbers 19 and 70 are
proper, may the like work be performed in other places of different Latitudes
from London, only by altering the numbers, according as the proper Latitudes of
such places shall require. And in all Northern Horizons (or the longest days)
must be so placed that the point of 12 in the Circle may then be nearest to the
Index, and in (or the shortest days) it may be furthest of. But in Southern
Latitudes, the places of and are quite contrary, because there the Sun being in
makes the longest day, and in the shortest.

The manner of fashioning the Index, of placing the Dial, and using it, is the
same as was showed before.

How to make the like Hours and Azimuths by an equally divided Circle, upon
all Plains whatsoever.
YOU are first to find these three things. 1. How much, and which Pole is
elevated above your plain, which is equal to the Latitude of your plain. 2.
The position of the (usual substylar or) proper Meridian of the plain. 3. The
difference of the Plains Longitude from your own, or the angle at the Pole made
between yours and the plains Meridian. And when these things are had, the work
will be like that which was before. For the way will be twofold* as there it
also was.

The first way.
Take half the complement of the plains Latitude, and add it to the plains
Latitude it self, the sum will give the elevation of the Index above the
plain. This Index is to point toward (but not into) that Pole which is
elevated above the plain.

The other circumstantiall things about the Index are as those before, if
instead of the line of 12 there mentioned, we here take the proper Meridian (or
Substilar drawn in its right position) of the plain.

The limitation of the Zodiac must be somewhat as before. That is, you must
count the Semidiameter of your Dial Circle to be as the Radius. And to that
Radius, 1. Either find the Sine of the elevation of the Index, and make that
Sine a Tangent of the same elevation of the Index; then to the Radius of this
Tangent find the Co-secant of the former elevation, the same Co-secant shall
be the Radius or Decimall Scale whereby to insert those days or Ellipticall
degrees set down in the Tables Page 4, 5, etc.

2. Or else to that same Radius of the Circle, find the Cosine of the
elevation of the Index, and to this being made a Radius, find the Co-secant of
the Indexes elevation, and so shall this Co-secant be the Radius or Decimall
Scale as before.

The second way.
The altitude of the Index above the plain is the half complement of the
plains Latitude. The Index must (in this way) point toward (but not into) that
Pole which is depressed under the plain (I mean toward that Coast of the world,
but must still remain above the plain.)

The standing and motion of the Index, with the charactering of the Zodiac, and
other circumstantiall matters, as of the Cock for one Index, and the usage for
the hour, must be agreeable to the former rules given before.

The limitation of the Zodiac must be done by the two former rules given (in
general terms) in this Page.

How to divide the Circle of hours.
It must be divided into 24 equal parts, and those of the 24 taken into use as
will be serviceable, the rest left out. Every of these 24 parts may be divided
into 15 gr. or into quarters and half quarters (for here in such plains there
will be no Azimuth showed for the place, nor well for the plain it self, and
therefore it is best to omit it in these altogether.) All the doubt will be
where you must begin your division.

From the intersection of the proper Meridian (of the plain) with the Circle,
set off (upon the same Circle, and to the true Coast) an arc equal to the
plains difference of Longitude. And from that point so inserted, (which you
must suppose to be the point of 12) you are to begin the division of your
Circle. The numbering of the hours on both sides 12 will not be hard to find,
in respect of their course, for the course of the shadow of the Index will give
that.

NOTE
1. In all Polar plains (such as our upright East and West, etc.) the Index in
both these cases or ways (here before given) will be elevated 45 gr. and the
Radius of the Dial Circle will be the Radius or Decimall Scale by which the
Zodiac Scale is to be inserted out of the Tables, Page 4, 5, etc.

2. If at any time the Zodiac prove longer than the Diameter of the
Horologicall Circle, and so the Index do go without the Circle; at such time as
it is without, the shadow of the Index will go one way till it touch the
Circle, and then back again the same way it formerly came.

A brief DEMONSTRATION of these Circular ways of making DIALS.
THe Circular ways have dependence, and are deduced out of the precedent
Ellipticall ways; and the Cases are but two, wherein the same may be done upon
any Horizon or plain, as may be perceived by the former Precepts, wherein the
altitudes of the Indexes above the plain are ever made to be either half the
complement of the Plains Latitude, or else (the sum of the Latitude and that
half complement, which sum is equal to) the complement of that forenamed
half complement.

According to these two cases here are two Schemes fitted. The projections are
made upon the plain of the Meridian Circle P Z H X. P is the Pole, Z the Zenith
of the place, H A the Horizon of the place, Ae A the Equinoctial Circle, D A
and R A are drawn in the middle of Z P and Ae H or Ae O. D B C X represents one
Azimuth or Vertical Circle proper to the plain R A, and by that one all the
rest of them may be understood. D A represents the Index in both the former
Cases, and R A the Horizontall plain (not of the place but that Horizontall
plai^ which is) properly belonging to the Index or Zenith line D A. The first
Scheme shows the first of the two former Cases, the second shows the second of
them. Their Demonstrations will be both one. For the question in them both is,
How to these inclinations of the Index, the Dial, or horary line, that falls
upon the Horizontall plain of the place, comes to be a perfect Circle.



First, therefore consider, that in all the Ellipticall Dials, the horary line
has relation to the Equinoctial Circle, and to the Index or line that is to
give the shadow (whatsoever the Superficies be upon which the projecture is
made, whether plain or otherwise it matters not, as appears before, but here we
deal only with plains, because Ellipses and Circles are plain Figures.



Secondly, consider, that through the several hour points of the Equinoctial
Circle, right lines are to be supposed to pass infinitely extended, till they
meet with the plain whereon the projecture is to be designed. Which issuing out
of these infinite lines (if they be regularly clothed about with an inflected
Superficies must comprehend a Cylindricall concave, either round or compressed
according as the forenamed infinite lines are either perpendicular to the plain
of the Equinoctial, or not perpendicular to it.

Thirdly, These parallel lines so drawn through the hour points of the
Equinoctial, parallel to the Index, must all fall perpendicular to the
Horizontall plain which is properly belonging to the Index as a Zenith line.
And the same lines upon that proper Horizon do always make an Ellipsis, except
only these two Cases. First, If the Horizon be the same with the Equinoctial
Circle, and the Zenith line or Index the same with the Axis of the world, for
then those lines do there make a perfect Circle. Secondly, If the Horizon be a
Polar or Meridian Horizon, and the Index or Zenith line fall into the
Equinoctial (having no Latitude from it) for then those lines do all fall into
(or coincide with) the plain of the Equinoctial, and consequently do make
(upon their proper Horizon) a direct right line: ^ea more, because the said
lines do lie all upon the plain of the Equinoctial, and are all drawn out of
the equal divisions of the Equinoctial Circle, and besides are all parallel
one to the other; therefore they make (in this case) a double line of Sines, as
is said before in the fifth note Page 37. Now to come to my intended purpose,
which is, to prove (...) Indexes so laid (as is mentioned before in the two
precedent Cases) will require (upon the Horizontall plain of the place) a true
Circle and not an Ellipsis.

Suppose therefore D A to be the Index (according to one of the two precedent
conditions) then must R A be the proper Horizon to that Index. And according to
the former Doctrine, if Ae, and B, and A, be taken for three of the hour
points in the Equinoctial, and Azimuths drawn through them from D the
Vertical point of the Index, then I say (in these two cases and not otherwise)
look how the Equinoctial is divided by those Circles, in the same manner is H
O the Horizon of the place divided. But because the Equinoctial is ever
equally divided in respect of hours, therefore the Circles from D to X (from
the Zenith of the proper Horizon R A to the Nadir, which are Azimuthall
Circles) shall cut the Horizon of the place (H O) into equal parts. This, I
say, is true, Because D Ae B and X H C are equal Sphericall Triangles in three
of their quantities [For D Ae is equal to X H, and the angles at D and X are
equal, as also the right angles at Ae and H] and therefore equal in all the
rest, if like be compared to like: that is, H C is equal to Ae B; and
consequently A C equal to A B: so also C X equal to B D. And if so, then the
Chord B C must be parallel to the Index or Zenith line D X, and so Ae H is
parallel to D X, and so contrarily (in these two Cases) right lines drawn from
the hour points in the Equinoctial Circle, parallel to the Index, must cut
(upon the Horizon of the place) equal parts, equal to one another, and equal
to the hours upon the Equinoctial Circle. That is to say, they cut the
horizontall Circle it self into 24 equal parts or hours. And consequently (in
these two Cases) those forementioned right lines must design (the horizontall
Circle it self, that is) a Circle upon the horizontall plain of the place,
though upon the proper Horizon it self (R A) they must design an Ellipsis
(falling perpendicularly thereon) according to the third observation in the 128
Page And from that Ellipsis these lines B C, H Ae, may be conceived as surgent
lines (such as are mentioned before Page 113) containing a compressed Cylinder,
which Cylinder being cut two ways, (that is subcontrarily) will again reveile
the original Circle (at least in one of the two Sections) from whence it self
and the surgent lines took their form and places.

NOTE.
1. The same reason holds in all plains, that in them also there may be found
such a Circular Horologiography. For they are Horizons to some place of the
World or other, and are therefore capable of the same accidents that the
forementioned Horizon of a particular place is.

2. That these Cases are the same (in a manner) with those. 5. For here a new
Zenith line (as D A) is found to H O the Horizon of the place, such a Zenith
line (or Index) as may lie equidistant from the Horizon of the place H O, and
from the Aequinoctiall Circle Ae A: And there there is a plain set up which may
stand so, as that the Zenith line of the place may stand equally distant from
the Aequinoctiall Circle and this plain. In both, the Index shands equally
distant from the Equinoctial, and from the plain whereon the hour points are
to be inserted.

For the limitation of the Zodiac.
The first work in the limitation of it is for the Ellipsis that should be
described upon the proper Horizon, and the ground of that is the same with what
was before delivered Page 75. The reason of both will be plain enough out of
the foregoing Diagrams. For the Zenith line D A, if it were to move upon the
proper Horizon R A, it must move in the proper horizontall Zodiac, as formerly
it did, Page 17, 18. Which Zodiac is to be made as before, and here in the
first work is showed: the reason of the division of it is given in Page 61, 62.
Here is only to be showed the reason of the enlargement. If the Index were set
upon the proper Horizon R A, then it must move thereon (perpendicularly) from A
to S suppose. But it moves not upon that but upon H O the horizontall plain of
the place, and yet to keep the same distances in motion from the first
position of it in D A X, that is, it must move parallel always to D A, but not
upon A S but upon A H, which to do, it must not have the parts of the Zodiac in
A S (to guide upon H O) but proportional ones to them, that is, instead of A S
must be taken A m; which is all one as to say, As A S the Radius, to A m the
Cosecant of S m A, or D A O, the Indexes elevation (above the Horizon H O;) So
are the parts of A S the prime or fundamental Zodiac, to the parts of A m, the
secondary or enlarged Zodiac.

Thus much of Circular Dialling.

APPENDIX.
SEE the Figure in page 120. To that Zodiacs length you may find such a Radius
as shall be thereto justly competent so as to make the Ellipticall Horizontall
Dial R T S; and having made that Dial, the upright Index D A will give the
hour upon it, as the slope Index A C will give the hour upon the Circle. And
these two being several Indexes and Dialls must set themselves as the other
do, and will not stand right till they agree. Only this cannot be so punctual,
because the two Indexes A C and A D are no^ so far distan^^s in the other
horizontall Di^ll. But the Azimuth will here be still showed, as was mentioned
before.

Having the Zodiac limited, how to find the two extreme Diameters of the
Ellipsis.
The length of half the Zodiac is always to be esteemed the Tangent of 23 gr.
Now because we here suppose this Zodiac already made, and to be intended for an
horizontall Dial; therefore, Either thus,

1 As the Tangent of 23, is to the Tangent of your Latitude; So the length of
the Semizodiac upon your Dial, to the Sine of your latitude, which is the
shorter Semidiameter A T.

Or else thus,

2 As the Tangent of 23, is to the Radius or Tangent of 45 gr. So is your known
and limited Zodiac, to the Cosine of your Latitude. The Radius, to which Cosine
is the larger Semidiameter A W.

Thus having fitted your Ellipsis (to the Zodiac) you may describe and divide
it in such manner, as was formerly showed, page 1.

FINIS.
RECTILINEAL OR DIAMETRAL Horologiography.
SHOWING The manner how to describe the Hours upon a finite right line, or the
Diameter of a Circle, and to fit a moveable Index unto the Dial so described.

Invented and written by Mr. SAMVEL FOSTER, Late professor of Astronomy in
Gresham-Colledge.



RECTILINEAL OR DIAMETRAL Horologiography.
Concerning Dials made upon a finite straight line, with a moveable Index.
THis may seem no difficult nor new thing, since the most vulgar known way of
pro^racting Dials is either by one contingent line (which is a right line;) or
else by two Tangent lines, as by the Sector is usually done. But it must be
considered, that the contingent line is infinite, and this line (here
mentioned) is finite. Again, that other way by the Sector, is not by one finite
line, but by two at the least; whereas this is by one finite line* Some
difference there is. And besides; that other by Tangents may be as well done
upon a single crooked line, this cannot.

This straight line is mentioned before, that in right Horizons or Polar plains
the Ellipsis shutreth up into a straight line. And it is true, that this falls
out to be so, only in right Horizons (if the Index stand perpendicular to the
plain, as is before intended) which cases happen but seldom, and to some
plains only. But here my purpose is to show how it may be done to all plains
whatsoever: observing only this one condition; always to set the Index so, as
to point up into the Equinoctial Circle: for so it must do, and will not be
done any other way, according to this form of casting the hours.

There are two Cases which will offer themselves.

The first is, when the Index points up both into the Equinoctial Circle,
and likewise into the plains proper Meridian Circle.

The second is, when it points up into the Equinoctial Circle of the heavens
(for so it must ever do) and into some other Meridian Circle, such as is not
proper to the plain.

1. How to make a Dial upon a finite straight line, drawn upon any plain, the
Index being so ordered that it point up into the Equinoctial Circle, and into
the plains proper Meridian.
IN this Case, the Index is to lie just over the proper Meridian of the plain,
and is to be elevated so much above that line as the height of the Equinoctial
above that plain comes unto, and must point up into the Equinoctial Circle it
self.

It must therefore here be supposed that the situation of the plain, with such
things as are thereon depending, are known. Such are these that follow. 1 The
plains reclination or inclination and declination. 2 The position of the
Substylar, or plains proper meridian 3. The elevation of the Pole above the
plain. 4. The plains difference of Longitude from your Meridian.




These things are to be found by the common ways of making of Dials upon
plains, which need not here be repeated, but shall be supposed to be already
known, and placed in their true positions upon the plain. Let A B be the proper
Meridian of the plain truly placed, and A D the Index standing over it, and
pointing up into the Equinoctial. Let the degrees of the difference of the
plains longitude be C L, and let the point L stand from C upon the right Coast
according to the exigence of the plain. Then for drawing and dividing the line
that is to give the hours, do thus.

1. Supposing A to be the point of the Equinoctial (in the Zodiacall motion of
the Index) through that point draw R A S perpendicular to B A C the proper
Meridian; and upon A as the center, and to any convenient extent, describe the
Circle R C S, in which, C L is to be set according to the difference of
Longitude, as was before mentioned. So that L is the point from whence you must
begin to divide your Circle, for from L is the point of the hour 12 deduced.
Therefore,

2. Divide your Circle from L into 24 hours at a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. l, m, n,
o, etc. and from each of these points let perpendiculars fall upon the diameter
R S, as L m, an, bp, etc. the same Perpendiculars shall divide the Diameter
into the hours required: m shall be the point of 12, because it falls from L,
the point of the difference of Longitude: n and o shall be the next hours to
12 on both sides: p and q shall be the second hour points on both sides 12,
and so the rest in their orders.

But then in these Dials, when the difference of Longitude falls not just upon
an hour (as very seldom (and then but casually) it does) the line R S will be
cross divided as you see it in this example, for e R u is one hour, and
unequally broken and set upon the Diameter R S: so t S o is the space of 5
hours; and the points t and o stand cross or distant one from the other, and
are not coincident; which I say must always happen when the difference of
Longitude is not equal to one or more just full hours.

3. In these cross hours (for so I may call them) you may divide each side of
the line severally, as thus:



Or else you may make a double line in this manner, supposing the fiduciall
line to be the white that lies entire and undivided betwixt them.



This kind of Dial will be somewhat difficult in the use, because of this
cross division of the hours. Yet I thought best not to omit it, because it is
the ground of the next Case which will be more useful.

Concerning the Zodiac and the Index.
FOr the limitation of the Zodiac, let A R or A S be as Radius. To that Radius
let A F be the Tangent of 23. This Tangent is to be augmented according to the
proportion that the Radius bears to the Secant of the complement of the angle D
A B, which is the elevation of the Equinoctial above the plain: That is,

As the Radius, To the Secant of the Poles elevation above the plain (which is
the same with the said complement;) So is the Tangent of A F, to the line A B
suppose. Therefore now A B is the length of half vour Zodiac, and must be
taken as a Tangent of 23 gr. (or as a Scale of 4348/10000 equal parts) by
which you may insert the Months or Signs as is before showed, Page 4, 5, etc.
These must be set on and charactered as the nature of the plain shall require
them to be ordered.

The Index though it move, yet must always lie just over the proper Meridian A
B, and must also keep the angle D A B unchanged, and must be moved from B to
A, and so to B, as the time of the year shall require. Or the Index may stand
and the Dial move upon the line B B, as the manner of these kinds of Dials
may be, and which have been too often mentioned. The second case follows.

2. How to make a Dial upon a finite straight line, drawn upon any plain, the
Index being so ordered, that it point up into the Equinoctial Circle, and into
a just hour point in the same Circle.
AS before, so here, it must be supposed that the situation of the plain with
the other things (beforementioned) which depend thereupon are known and placed
upon the plain. And the matter must be so ordered, that the Index must both
look into the Equinoctial Circle, and also it must point to some just hour
therein, that so one division of the Dial line may very well serve for
accounting the hours both ways, the whole hours and parts upon one side
justly corresponding to the just hours and parts upon the other side. This
will be for more expedite use than the former way could be, and no such trouble
nor confusion in the numeration of hours and parts of hours, as will appear
in the next Example.

In this Case that we are now going upon, we must consider these things.

1. How the Index is to be ordered, so as that it may look up into some just
hour point of the Equinoctial? 2. How the line of the Dial or hours (the
horologicall line) is to be placed, and limited and divided? 3. How the Zodiac
is to be placed and limited?
First, for the Index: The best way will be to find what Declination and
Reclination (in respect of the Meridian and Zenith of the plain) the hour
point (into which the Index must point) has. And that is done by these two
Rules.

1. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Equinoctials altitude above the plain:

So is the Cosine of the distance of that hour point from the Meridian of the
plain, to the Cosine of the Reclination; or to the Sine of the elevation of
the Index above the plain.

2. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain:

So is the Co-tangent of the former distance (of the intended hour point from
the Meridian of the plain,) to the Cotangent of the declination of the Index
from the Meridian of the plain. Or thus, 2.

As the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain, to the Radius, So is the
Tangent of the former distance, to the Tangent of the declination of the Index
from the plains Meridian.

Thus,] suppose A B were the proper Meridian of the plain, make the angle B A C
on the right Coast, and equal to the declination of the Index (now found) and
elevate A D just perpendicularly over A C, to the angle D A C equal to the
elevation of the Index above the plain, and so you shall place the Index in a
just position, that it shall look up into a just hour point of the
Equinoctial. That is the first thing.



Secondly. The Horologicall line is to be set for position as it was before in
the precedent Case, namely, perpendicular to the proper Meridian, as in the
former and this Scheme you see R A S.



Then again, this line which in the former figure was equal to R S the
Diameter of the Circle (or two assumed Radiusses) must now in this case be
enlarged, according as you have ordered your Index to wrye from the proper
Meridian of the plain to any other just hour; as in this figure it is made to
be distant from that proper Meridian unto the hour of 12: that is, it is
supposed to be turned so, as to look into our 12 a clock point in the
Equinoctial: which point of 12 in the former figure was noted at L, and so in
this figure let it be supposed again. I say, let it be supposed that (because
the former Horologicall line was crossely divided, and therefore untoward for
use) this way that is now spoken of shall be to take away that inconvenience in
use which was in the former. And therefore suppose the. Style or Index to be
wryed from the proper Meridian of the plain to the Meridian of the place, or to
the point of 12. It may as well be put to any other just hour, as to 12, but
be it so in this Example, and let the point be L selected from all the rest.

From the selected point L, draw the diameter L A M, and from the selected
point L divide the Circle into 24 equal parts or hours. Then from each two
hour points correspondently distant on both sides the Diameter L M draw right
lines, as G h and n O, and G O, which will be all parallel to the Diameter L M.
Draw these lines (I say) and continue them until they meet with the
horologicall line R A S, sufficiently prolonged both ways. By this draught
thus made, the horologicall line R A S shall be both prolonged to h O, and also
divided just as a line of Sines, so the parts of it are in the same proportion
that the parts of the Diameter G A G are, which are Right Sines both ways from
the center, or Versed Sines from G through A to G.

Note that here (as formerly) you may assume the Circle of what extent you
list, and shall find most fitting your purpose.

It is plain then by this Example, First, that the Radius of the Circle A R, is
to be enlarged, according to the secant of the Equinoctial distance between
the proper Meridian of the plain, and that just hour (wha^ever it be) inro
which the Index is made to point. As you see that arc to be here L C, or G R,
or G S, whose secant is A h, or A o, in respect of the assumed Radius A R. And
secondly, that h o thus enlarged is divided like a double line of Sines, as it
ought to be.

And for numbering the hours, if A be 12, and the Index look toward the South,
then must o be 2, and the other o must be 6; and the first o, 10 at night. And
h must be 9 in the morning; the other h, 6 in the morning; and the first h 3 in
the morning.

But if the Index had not pointed up into 12 at L, but into some other hour as
P, then must a Diameter have been drawn at first from P to the center A quite
through, and all the hours parallel to P A, and then the horologicall line
would have been thus numbered with 7 at the two extremes, and 1 in the midst at
A.



And here is one special thing to be noted (as formerly Page 125) but this
here is always so, and in all Oblique Horizons. That in our Climates where the
days are in Summer longer than 12 hours, the shadow of the Index does really
go forward and backward. As to make it plain. If the Dial were described upon
an Horizontall plain (for instance) and it were our longest day, then the
shadow of the Index would begin at 4 a clock (figured below the line) and would
go thence toward the left hand to 5, 6, and 7. At 7 it would return back
toward the right hand through 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, until 7,
and then being arrived at 7, the utmost point on the right hand, it will come
back again toward 8 and 9 to the left hand. This for the placing, limiting,
and dividing of the horologicall line.



Thirdly, Concerning the Zodiac how it must be placed and limited, consider of
these things. The Zodiac (in this case of wrying the Index from the plains
proper Meridian) must be augmented in length, and changed in situation from
what it was in the former case where the Index looked up into the plains proper
Meridian. Yet I will here first begin with that way so far as it goes, and then
proceed to what is further needful. Let the Figure Page 137 be here repeated.
To the Radius A R, the Tangent of 23 and a half is A F, and the same is there
augmented thus.

As the Radius, To the Secant of the Poles elevation above the plain;

So let AF be supposed to be, To AB.

So that if the Index were pointing directly to the Meridian point (in the
Equinoctial) which is proper to the plain, then the business was at an end;
for A B must be the length of the Zodiac, and standing square to R A S. But now
we here suppose the Index to be wryed from that point, as much as the arc C L
comes to; which turning aside will both lengthen the Zodiac again, and turn it
out of its perpendicular standing to R A S. Which thing is thus to be effected.
To A F as a Radius, find the Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain;
suppose that Tangent were G H. Then say, As the Radius, to the Tangent of C L
the quantity of wrying, so G H to X Z. Make B K equal to X Z, and parallel to
A R, and draw A K, so shall A K be the length, and shall also give (in this
position) the situation of the Zodiac. The manner how to divide it need not be
repeated, because it has been often set down heretofore, You must only
remember to place this line upon that Coast of A B which is contrary to the
Coast of the Indexes deviation or wrying from the proper Meridian point of the
plain: this work may either be protracted, or calculated, or wrought
Instrumentally, as shall best be liked of.



Another way I will here add to do the same work, which may perhaps be not
inferior to the former. Let all things preparatorie in the former Figure, be
here again repeated, R A the Radius, and A F the Tangent of 23 degrees and a
half to that Radius: then to A F as Radius, find the Sine and Cosine of the
Poles elevation above the plain: let F P be the Sine, and A P the Cosine. Make
A m equal to A P; and from m draw the line m n, making the angle n m C equal
to the angle B A C Page 142, and standing on the contrary Coast, which is the
angle of the declination of the Index from A C in this Figure, the proper
Meridian of the plain.

Then say, As the Radius, is to the Tangent of the Reclination of the Index
(which is the Complement of D A C ( Page 142) the elevation of the Index above
the plain,) So is the Sine F P to a fourth quantity, suppose the same to be D
G: make m n equal to D G, and draw the straight line A ^, so shall A n in this
Figure be equal to A K in the precedent, and the angle n A C be (here) equal
to the angle K A B in the former. So that A n must be the length of the half
Zodiac, and will lie in its true position by this work. This may be done either
by calculation, protraction, or Instrument, as all other works may also be.
Care must always be had to place these Zodiacs on the right Coast from F A C,
and that the Zodiac be rightly divided and charactred according to the Seasons
of the year, as they shall have respect to the nature of the plain.

Or thirdly, it may be done thus. First,

1. As the Radius, To the bine of the Poles elevation above the plain;

So the Tangent of the Equinoctial discession or wrying, To the Tangent of the
Declination of the Zodiac; which is the angle n A C in this Figure, o^ B A K in
the former.

2. As the Cosine of the discession, or Equinoctial wrying,

Is to the Radius; So is the Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain,

To the Tangent of another Arc.

3. And, As the Radius,

Is to the Secant of that arc (or as the Cosine of that arc to the Radius;)

So is the Tangent of 23 gr. To a number.

If now you make the Radius of the Circle first assumed, namely R A or A S to
be a Decimall scale, and out of that Decimall scale do take this number, the
same shall give the length of the Zodiac A n in this figure, or A K in the
former. The division of this Zodiac now it is thus placed and limited, must be
done by the Tables and directions in the 4 and 5 Pages. For A n must be taken
as a Tangent of 23 gr. or as the number 4348 of a Decimall scale of 10000 parts.

Thus much for this kind of Dial upon a straight line, both crossely and
evenly divided.

A DEMONSTRATION of the former way.
IN Page 28, Note 5, there is mention made of Polar plains or right Horizons,
that in them, the Ellipsis closes up into a right line. That right line is
here the line that we have to do withal. For we here suppose always that the
Index points up into the Equinoctial Circle; and the Index we always
suppose to be a Zenith line, and therefore the Horizon proper to that Index as
a Zenith line, must needs make right angles with the Equinoctial Circle, and
must therefore be a right Horizon or Polar plain.

When the Index is pitched in a true posture, all the hour points of the
Equinoctial Circle must be supposed to have lines issuing from them all
parallel to the Index. This is a general truth in the whole course of the
Ellipticall Dialling, Wherefore,

First of all, These lines will (in this case) fall all upon the plain of the
Equinoctial; and because the common section of any two plains must be a right
line, therefore it is that all these lines so issuing, will fall upon one and
the same straight line, namely, whenever the Equinoctial meets with or cuts
any other plain. Hence comes it to be Rectilineal Horologiography, being
performed upon a plain.

Secondly, Because they are all parallel to the Index, therefore they must all
be parallel to one another; and because they come originally from a Circle, and
are parallel, they will all also keep distance one from another as the Sines in
a Circle do.

Thirdly, Because the Index moves always in a parallel position to it self,
and would show the hour upon the circular divisions of the Equinoctial Circle
(at all times of the year, that is, when this Equinoctial is made to represent
all other parallels of Declination) it must follow that the Index when (the
shadow of) it falls upon any one such point, it must also fall upon the whole
line that issues through that point. The reason is, because the line is
always parallel to the Index, therefore is it touch one point it must shadow
the whole.

Fourthly, Hence will follow, that any line drawn upon the plain of the
Equinoctial, crossing those forementioned parallel lines, shall be a line of
Sines (or a double line of Sines, if you will rather express it properly) and
if it pass through the center o^ the Equinoctial Circle (where the Index also
does always pass) then is such a line one of the Dials that we here are to
deal with. Because every plain is taken for a great Circle cutting the
Equinoctial in the center. And the divisions of this line (the Sinicall
divisions) must be the hour points, as is said before.

Now all that we have here to say is the making good of the former rules of
limiting out and placing the hour line, the Zodiacall line, and the Index. If
we therefore (in all cases) suppose the Index to be a Zenith line, and then an
Horizontal plain to be placed perpendicular to it, this plain must be the
proper Horizon to that Index (or Zenith line) and must (in these Cases here
handled) go through the Axis of the world (a part of which I must call the
primary Zodiac) and will cut the Equinoctial plain in a right line placed
perpendicularly to the Index, which I call the primary horizontall line.

And again, all that is done in other plains (not perpendicular to the Index)
must be imagined primarily (or originally) to be deduced from this proper
Horizontall plain.

First therefore, for the hour line. If the Index lie in the proper Me^idian
of the plain (as is supposed in the first of the former Cases) then the
Diameter of the Circle that is at first assumed, serves for the horologicall
line without any alteration, because the proper Horizon, and the plain upon
which you work, do (both of them) cut the Equinoctial in one and the same
line, which is to be the horologicall line. And therefore in plain reason, so
much of the Equinoctial as the Index is wryed from this proper Meridian of the
plain, so much of the same Equinoctial must the proper Horizon be wryed with
it, and consequently, so much will be between the proper horizontall line and
the horologicall line of the plain, but still both these lines will continue
upon the same plain of the Equinoctial, and consequently they must in both
cases be one and the same line, namely that which is made by the projection of
the Equinoctial Circle upon the plain, on^y it must b^ augmented according to
the proper horizontall lines departure from the section of the plain with the
Equinoctial, that is, according to the wrying of the Index, as is plain enough
by what is said in the 142 Page* And so for the division of that line in the
same Page. For G G and h o, do both lie in one and the same plain of the
Equinoctial: and all the projecture must be made parallel to the Index, whence
h A is the secant (to G A Radius) of R G or C L, the wrying of the Index.

Then for the Zodiac, you are to deduce it from the Axis which is perpendicular
to the Zenith line or Index: and from so much of it as contains the Tangent
of 23 gr. to the Radius G A. Now though the Index do keep the proper Meridian
of the plain, yet the Axis is elevated above the plain. And because the
projecture of that Tangent or part of the Axis must be parallel to the Index,
therefore look what elevation the Axis or Pole of the World has, to such a
Secant of the Radius equal to the Tangent of 23 before mentioned must the
Zodiac be extended. By which means the Index keeps the same situation and
distance from the Equinoctial plain that it would do if it moved according to
the proper and primary Tangents upon the Axis, and no otherwise. And so does
the former enlarging of the horologicall line produce the like effect, namely,
that the Index does upon that enlarged line show the same hours that it would
do upon the proper horizontall line.

Then for the Zodiac to a wryed Index, it is both displaced and enlarged too,
according as right lines drawn through the divisions of the Axis, and parallel
to the Index, would make a projection of it. According to which, there are
three ways given.

The first makes A F equal to the Tangent of 23 to the Radius R A, to be
Radius, and to that Radius finds F H, and to that again as Radius, find H Z
the Tangent of wrying. And so A Z is the Semizodiac placed and enlarged.



The second makes A F as a Radius, and to it finds F P the Sine, and A P the
Cosine of the Axis his elevation above the plain. And then this line F P being
perpendicular to the plain, it stands as the proper Zenith line of the plain.
And because we are to cast all according to the lying of the Index, therefore
what reclination from the plains proper Zenith, and declination from the plains
proper Meridian the Index has, the same must the projection (or projecture) of
the line F P have. That is, we may suppose the Index, or a line paral^el to the
Index (in his true posture) to pass through the point F, and then we are to
inquire where it will strike through the plain. That is to say, it must look
into the same Coast that the Index does, and so the angle Z P Q being made
equal to the declination of the Index from A Q the proper Meridian line, and
the line P Z drawn, it is certain enough that the projecture of the point F
must be upon the line P Z. And to know where, because F P Z is a right angle,
and the side F P is known, with the angle I F M (equal to the reclination of
the Index from the plains Zenith line F M) or P F Z; Therefore,

As F P Radius, To P Z the Tangent of the angle P F Z;

So is F P in the former known length (found to A F Tangent of 23 gr.) To P Z.

Therefore Z is the point terminating the extremity of the projected Zodiac,
and so A Z must be the Semizodiac, according to what was delivered in the
second way Page 147.

The third way resolves a Sphericall rectangled Triangle, made between the
proper Meridian of the plain P A, the plain it self A B, and the Meridian in
which the Index lies, or into which it points, P B. In which three
quantities are known. P A the altitude of the Pole above the plain. The angle
at A a right angle. And the angle at P equal to the arc of the Equinoctial
or wrying of the Index from the proper Meridian of the plain. And there is
first required A B.



As the Radius P n, To the Tangent of ( n m =) P;

So the Sine of P A, To the Tangent of A B, = n A C, Page 147,

Then secondly, the arc P B is required, and that (...) wrought by the second
work, Page 148, which in the second Figure Page 153, may be understood to be
the angle F A Z, Then because A F Z is a plain Triangle rectangled at F, and
the angle F A Z is now known, and the side A F (equal to the Tangent of 23) it
will be required to find A Z in the same parts. Therefore in the third work (
Page 148) it is said,

As A F, Radius, To A Z, Secant of F A Z;

So is A F in parts, (as a Tangent of 23) To A Z in the same parts.

And so the Zodiac is both placed and limited.

APPENDIX.
IT has been forwerly showed (in the VIII. Section) how to make the
Ellipticall Dial to any Index however placed, and to any Superficies flat or
curved. That Doctrine will show how to project this kind of Rectilineall Dial
(and the former Circular Dial too) only I shall add a word or two to show
that that way will produce a single line in this case, and such a line as must
answer to a double line of Sines.

1. See the 6 and 7 Propositions Page 95, 96. The first of them is to find the
Horizontall spaces. And in this case (because the Index looks always up into
the Equinoctial Circle) the Latitude of the Horizon proper to this Index line,
is nothing. So that,

As the Sine of the Poles elevation, which is nothing, Is to the Radius;

So is the Tangent of each hour from the proper Meridian of the Index,

To the Tangent of an infinite length: [For so it must be because the first
term is 00.]

Which infinite Tangent is belonging to 90 gr. therefore it will follow that
all the hours and each of them are 90 gr. from the proper Meridian of the
Index: that is, that they are all coincident into one line, which is
perpendicular to the proper Meridian of the Index. This shows that this Dial
will be a single line, and that by the former general Doctrine, Section VIII.

2. Then for the second thing, that it will be a line of Sines, or (though a
curved line, yet) to be thence deduced or divided, it will appear by the
seventh Proposition Page 96. Because,

As the Radius, To the Cosine of the Poles elevation; which here is the Radius;

So the Cosine, etc. To the same term again.

For if the two first terms be the same, then the two latter must be equal
too. And since the third terms are a line of Sines, the fourth terms (which are
to divide the Dial line) being the same with the third, will be also such as
will make a line of Sines. So this is made good likewise.

And there may other ways be found to effect this same thing upon a curved
Superficies. As first to project the Equinoctial line or section with the
uneven supersicies, upon the said Superficies: and when that is done, to lay
the edge of some boa^d or ruler, in the Superficies of the Equinoctial, with
the Index lying in the plain of the Equinoctial, will (by the former
Equinoctial line drawn) direct you in, and afterward to proceed answerably to
the nature of the Dial, etc. But what need I to mention any such thing thus
obscurely. They that understand the former ways will be able to invent many
more, and so I ce^se from further tro^bling my self or the Reader. One
Proposition more must here be added, which conduces to this Rectilineal
Horologiography, namely:

How to lay a line that shall point up to any assigned place or point in the
heavens.
THis is useful for the laying of an Index to any condition that shall be
required: namely, so as to cut through any just hour, either in the
Equinoctial Circle, or any other Circle in the heavens.

The first work must be to find what Reclination and Declination the said
point shall have in respect of our own Zenith and Meridian. This is an easy
Sphericall work, and therefore I shall omit it. Only note, that the Reclination
here mentioned is the distance of it from our Zenith; and the declination is,
what Azimuth from the Meridian the said point falls into.

The next work is, how to lay or stretch a line to any given Declination and
Reclination. The way that for the present I think on shall be this.

First, Assign any point from which you will have that your line shall rise,
as at A, then by a perpendicular thread c^st a shadow through A, as C A, and
draw therethrough an obscure line: and having before drawn an horizontall line
through A, as is B A; apply some plain board or past-board to that line B A,
and upon it project with your eye the Vertical C A by your perpendicular
thread (you need not be over curious i^ holding your pastboard level.)

Afterward, knowing what Azimuth this is (which you may find by taking the
Suns altitude just when the shadow C A was drawn) you may upon your pastboard
set off (from it) your Azimuth of the lines declination, suppose it to be A E.
Then again applying your pastboard to his former true position, with your
perpendicular thread, you may transfer (or project) A E from the pastboard to
the plain: suppose one point of that transferred Azimuth were at F, then draw
the line A F, which is the section of that Azimuth (with the plain) in which
Azimuth the Index or straight line must lie, (...) 10 at C, divide your Circle
into 24 equal parts, at 11, 12 1, 2, 3, etc, so shall the hours of 4 and 4
fall upon the just perpendicular Diameter D E.

For the hour points.
You are here left to your choice to take which (of three ways) you like best.
Either, 1. These points in the Circle may serve for the hour points without
any more draughts, and then this will be another Circular Dial, differing from
those that were handled before in Circular Dialling. 2. The perpendicular
Diameter D E may have the hours inserted by drawing lines from each pare of
hours equally distant from D and E hour points of the Circle, parallel to the
Index C A, and so you shall have the Diameter D E divided like a double line of
Sines (unequally) at 12, 11, 1, 2, 3, and 10, 9, 8, etc. 3. You may likewise
(if you allow not the two other ways) draw any line as F G, and by lines drawn
through the hour points of the Circle, all parallel to the Index C A, the same
line F G shall be divided as a double line of Sines, at 12, 1, 2, etc. and 11,
10, 9, etc. and will show the hour as the other do, and the two extreme
parallels 4 F, and 4 G, shall limit the length of the line F G.


Upon this Circular way Note thus much.
That though the Index A C should not lie upon a just hour, but otherwise
accidentally, yet because the hour points are upon a Circle, the hours will
be distant from each other, and not breed that distraction in computing that
was before noted necessarily to fall upon the straight horologicall line. And
so you are left at liberty to set your Index how you will, only so as ever to
look into one and the same Meridian Circle. But you must then be careful to
place some one hour line true, so as to answer to some just hour circle in
the heavens, which upon this Equinoctial plain (when the Axis is once truly
placed) will be easy. For if the Axis give a shadow, and you at the same
instant time (noting the shadow) do observe the hour, that shadow will
represent the same hour. If therefore upon that shadow line (as a Diameter)
you describe a Circle, you may (from the intersections of the said line, with
the Circle) set off any one full and just hour, and then from that just hour
you may divide the Circle into the 24 hours. This equal setting of the Index
is allowable upon the Circle, but not upon the right lines D E or F G, for in
them there will be confusion of parts, which in the Circle are distant.

Note further, that you need not make the Center of the horologicall Circle
just in the point A, where the extremity of the Index which came down upon the
plain, but you may make it in any point where the Index A C will touch the
plain, as at H, or in other like places.

Concerning the Zodiac.
You must account the Semidiameter D A of the horologicall Circle to be as
Radius. And to that length (and none other) you must make the length of the
Semizodiac A B upon the Axis to be the Tangent of 23 and a half, and by that
Scale of Tangents you must put in the Sines or months as has been often
showed before. And whereas I have hitherto said that the Index must move upon
the Axis, and agree to a Zodiac thereon inscribed, it must be understood that
in some sense this is necessary, but in some sense not so. As thus, The Index D
A or D E, must always move perpendicular A X the Axis. A C the Zodiac. A D the
Index, A B another supporter differing from the Axis.

to the Axis A X. But it is not tied to move upon the Axis it self. It may
move according to any line that lies in the same plain with the Index D E and
the Axis A X, that is, it may move according to the line A B, which we here
suppose to be in the same plain or Meridian with A D and A X. This condition is
always requisite, and it must ever keep one and the same angle with the ^ight
line A B, and such an angle that may keep it always perpendicular to the true
Axis, that is, parallel to the Equinoctial plain. And this being observed, you
may insert the Zodiac upon the line A B, but it must be proportioned from the
Axis A X, thus; As A C Radius, to A E the Secant of the angle C A E, so is A C
the Tangent of 23 and a half (in respect of the Radius of the horologicall
Circle,) to a fourth quantity; the length whereof gives A E. And now this line
A E must be esteemed as a Tangent of 23 degrees and a half, and by it must the
Semizodiac or half year be put in, as has been showed formerly. So this is
done also, For the Index will move upon A E, according to the parts upon A C,
as it is bound to do. Only note that these Dials upon the Equinoctial plains
can serve but half a year upon one side* and therefore for the other half year
you must do the like work upon the under side of the Equinoctial plain. The
work I say is like without any real difference, and therefore there will need
no more words concerning it.

For DEMONSTRATION of these things.
THere needs nothing to be added more than what has formerly been done for
Rectilineal Dials. For what is done there in the proper Horizon (proper to the
Index I mean) by a line of Sines, is here expressed by the line of Sines D A E,
Page 162: only there, all the lines issuing from the Equinoctial hour points
did meet with the proper Horizontal plain, and did thereon create a single line
of ^80 Sines, and so the Equinoctial Circle standing toward the eye (being
infinitely removed from it) edgewise is projected upon his own diameter, and
appears nothing else but as a Diameter (or straight line) to the eye. But here
the same forementioned parallel lines issuing from the hour points of the
Equinoctial Circle, and flowing out upon the plain of that Circle, do so
appear in full view to the eye, because the eye stands so as fully to view the
said plain and not looking edgewise upon it. When the plain stood edgewise to
the eye, the eye did project it into the Diameter, but now we conceive the eye
to stand only to look what was effected upon the plain by the former
Projection.

And further. Look what projection was formerly made (in this case of the
Indexes pointing into the Equinoctial Circle) upon the Indexes proper Horizon,
and was there received by a straight line, the same is here done by drawing the
Diameter D A E, Page 162, which line must be supposed to be the common section
of the Indexes proper Horizon with the Equinoctial plain. And so in effect
both these Cases are nothing different.

Then for the line F G, the parts of it, and the points of the Circle, and the
points of D E must necessarily all fall into one hour line, and all show the
true hour (whichsoever of them you take for your Horologicall line) because as
the lines issuing from the hour points of the Equinoctial are all parallel
one to the other, and all again to the Index, therefore if any part of the
shadow of the Index do fall upon any part of one of those lines, the whole
shadow must fall upon the whole line, and consequently the correspondent points
upon D E and F G and the Circle, will all jointly, or each of them severally,
give the hour of the day. Other things are plain enough.

Of the parallelisme of the Index and Plain.
It must further be noted, that an Index may be made to point up into the
Equinoctial Circle, and yet also be parallel to any plain whatsoever. For
every plain cuts the Equinoctial Circle somwhere: Now if an Index be made to
lie in that common section of these two Circles or plains, then will it lie
parallel both to the Equinoctial plain and to the other plain, and it may be
made to move always parallel to them both, if it be moved at right angles to
any line that shall stand perpendicular to the said common Section.

But for all this, there can no such Dial (as we have now spoken of) be made
upon any other plain besides the Equinoctial. I say there can no parallelisme
of the Index to the plain be (in this kind of Dialling) allowed, more than
what is said may be done upon the Equinoctial plain.

For though the Index may be parallel to the Equinoctial and plain both, yet
the Equinoctial it self must make angles with all such plains. And because
the Index is parallel to the common Section, therefore all the hour points
projected by parallel lines to the Index, must be upon the Equinoctial plain
it self, and must run parallel to the line of common section: that is, they
will all run so, as never to meet so much as with the line of common section
(which line is upon the Equinoctial plain) much less ever to meet with any
part of the plain it self, which is every where distant more or less from the
Equinoctial, except only in the line of common section. So that there is no
more to be said of this subject.

FINIS.
ELLIPTICAL Horologiography.

SHOWING How upon any plain to draw an Elliptical Dial, to an Index set any
way, by Sphericall (and not Projective) work.

Invented and written by Mr. SAMVEL FOSTER, Late professor of Astronomy in
Gresham-Colledge.



London, Printed for Nicholas Bourn. 1654.

ELLIPTICAL Horologiography.
HItherto we have had the whole business of Elliptical Horologiography, so far
as that more cannot seem to be thought of, or required. Yet, Because to any
Index set eith^r on purpose or casually, the hours have been (formerly) found
out by Projection, I thought fit here to add another way (but for plains only)
that shall not need that projective manner of working.

And so the Problem will be this:

How upon any plain to draw an Ellipticall Dial, to an Index set any (...), by
Sphericall (and not Projective) work.
The substance of what I shall here say is most of it delivered before, only I
must now show what Propositions a^e to be referred hither, and how they must be
used.

Things that are pre-requisite to this work.
1. You must know the situation of your plain, that is, what Declination and
Reclination it has in respect of your own Horizon. This is to be done the
ordinary way, as in all plains is usual.

2. You must know the Declination and Reclination of your Index. That is, if
the Index be set casually you must then find out the Declination and
Reclination thereof, which is showed, Page 80. how it must be done, namely, by
observation from the Sun, and cannot be otherwise performed. Or if you choose a
Longitude and Latitude wherein to lay your Index, then must you (by that
Longitude and Latitude given) find what Declination and Reclination is due
thereunto, in respect of your own Horizon: and according to this Declination
and Reclination you are to lay your Index. See the Schemes Page 83, 84, for by
those or the like you are to conceive of your Sphericall work in this kind.

3. Having thus found the situation both of plain and Index, in respect of your
own Horizon, you must then find what situation the Index has in respect of
the plain; that is, what Declination it has from the proper Meridian of the
plain, and what Reclination it has from the Plains Zenith. This Proposition
has not been handled before, but must be put here in this place.

Let your own Horizon be N W S E, the Zenith Z, the Pole P, and let A V E be a
declining reclining plain, whose Declination and Reclination we now suppose to
be known by former rules; that is the angle S Z D (equal to the Declination)
is known, and Z V or D T (equal to the Reclination) is known. So that in the
Triangle P Z T, there is P Z (equal to the complement of P N, the Poles
altitude,) Z T (equal to the complement of Z V the Reclination,) and P Z T
(equal to the complement of S Z T, the plains Declination from the South:)
therefore you may now find the three unknown quantities; namely, P T the
complement of the Poles elevation above the plain: and Z P T, the distance of
the plains Meridian from yours, which is the plains difference of Longitude:
and lastly, Z T P the distance of P T the plains proper Meridian from V Z T the
Vertical line of the plain. Or which three soever you have, you may find the
other three. As having the difference of the plains Longitude, the angle P,
with the plains Latitude the complement of P T: and P Z the complement of your
own Latitude. You may find all the rest. And by that means you may set a plain
to any Latitude and difference of Longitude, that is answering to the Horizon
of any known place in the world.

The next work is to find what situation an Index (set up upon the plain)
shall have to the plain, and the fundamental lines thereon described, viz. the
Vertical line, and proper Meridian.

I suppose first, that the Declination and Reclination of the Index (in respect
of your own Horizon) is known by the former things already spoken of, and from
thence you may gather what is here required. Thus

Let the Index point up to X: and let Z X (the reclination from your Zenith) be
known, and S Z X (the declination from your Meridian) be also known. Now
therefore in the triangle T Z X, there are three things known.

1 T Z the Complement of the Plains reclination in respect of your Horizon.

2 Z X the complement of the Indexes reclination in respect of your Horizon.

3 Thirdly, the angle T Z X, which is the difference of the two declinations,
namely of the plain and of the Index. By these all the rest will be found; as
namely,

1 T X, the reclination of the Index X from T the pole of the plain, which is
called the proper reclination of the Index.

2 Z T X, or V Y, or rather V M, which shows how much the Subindicall line I
call that line upon the plain which lies perpendicularly under the Index, as
the substilar does under the Style. I mean perpendicularly in respect of the
plain, not of the Horizon.
Subindicall line lies from the Vertical line of the plain (in degrees of a
Circle described upon the plain) and consequently, because P T Z was known
before, therefore P T X is now also become known, which shows the declination
of the * Subindicall line from the plains proper Meridian, which may therefore
be called the proper declination of the Index.

3 The angle Z X T (if it be of any use here) shows how much (in Azimuthal
position) your Zenith Z lies from T, the Zenith of the plain upon that Hotizon
whose Zenith line is the same with the Index, which is therefore the proper
Horizon to the Index.

Or if you would set an Index so as to fit it to any assigned difference of
Longitude, and to any assigned Latitude also, you must work thus.
LEt X P S be the assigned difference of Longitude, and P X the complement of
the Latitude, into both which the Index shall point up in X. Because the plains
difference of Longitude Z P T. is known before, therefore the angle T P X is
known. And P T the complement of the plains Latitude is also before known.
Therefore in the triangle T P X these three things are known, viz. P X, P T,
and the interjacent angles T P X. By which three you may find all the other
quantities: namely, P T X, or B Y, the departure of the Subindicall line from
the plains proper Meridian: T X the proper reclination of the Index X from T
the pole of the plain, or the complement of it (X Y) which is the elevation of
the Index above the plain just over (perpendicularly over in respect of the
plain) the Subindicall line: with the angle P X T (if there were any use of it)
which shows how much the pole of the plain declines from the proper Meridian
of the Index. I say, it shows this declination upon that Horizon (whatever it
should be) which shall be properly belonging or perpendicularly placed to the
said Index as the proper Zenith-line.

Thus the situation of the Index (whether casually, or by election set) is
found to the true coasts of the plain it self.

What remains to be done.
THe rest of the work for making the Elliptical Dial it self to the Index
assigned, and for limiting and dividing the Zodiacall Scale depends upon this
one Rule. Namely,

To project the hour points of the Equinoctial, and the Zodiacall Scale upon
the Axis (which Zodiacall Scale upon the Axis it self is made by the Tangents
of 23 gr. and an half, to the Radius of that Sphere wherein you shall imagine
your Circles to be) I say. To project (all such points) upon the plain, by
lines passing through each one of them, and all and each of the same lines to
be drawn parallel to the Index given. This is the sum of what is here now to
be done, and of what has been done formerly quite through this Book. For all
that is before effected upon any plain or curved Superficies, is nothing more
then what I have now said; namely, a determining of the true places of every
such (hour and Zodiacall) point, as they shall be projected upon the Dialls
Superficies, by lines going through them, and going parallel also to the Index
that is to give the hour. For so, the Equinoctial Circle will very well
supply every parallel of the Sun, the Index and horologicall line being
rectified by the Zodiac in a true site one to the other, as has been often
mentioned before; And then the Index, casting its shadow upon the hour point,
either in the Equinoctial or in the parallel Circle, must also cast it upon
the whole projecting line, which passes through the hour point, (because that
line is made always parallel to the Index) and consequently upon that point of
the hour, which (by the said line) is carried to the Diall-Superficies. And so
for the points of the Zodiac, they are also projected in such manner, as that
the Index moving in them (however they may seem to stand awry and out of order)
shall always cut the Axis of the World (if it were there placed) and cut it
according to the Tangents of declination thereon expr^ssed. And this will serve
for a brief demonstration of that work which is ^ow to come afterward.

In which we are first to bring down the hour points and Zodiac to the plain
considered as an Horizon, and the projection of those points to be made into an
Ellipsis, by lines all perpendicular to the said plain, that is, parallel to
the plains proper Zenith line. Secondly, we are to project or transpose these
first (both Hour and Zodiacall) points from the primary Ellipsis into a
secondary Ellipsis, such as the position of the true intended Index will
require: And so also the points of the Zodiac must be dealt withal.

How to make an Ellipticall Dial upon any Plain, to an Index perpendicular to
the Plain.
THe first work is done before, partly by Calculation, and partly by
protraction, Page 25, 26, but more fully and better, Proposition 5, 6, 7, Page
92, 95, 96, by which you make two Tables, one of Horizontal spaces, the other
of Altitudes. So that I shall not need to say any more of it. By that work (I
say) you may make two Tables which may serve to prick down the hour points,
which points you shall see to wind about the center in form of an Ellipsis.

1. It is first requisite that the pr^per Meridian of the plain be rightly
situated upon the plain (as is there also expressly required. And it is again
requisite that the proper line of the two sixes (proper I mean to the plain,
considered as an Horizon by it self) be also drawn: which line (as in all
Horizontal Dials is usual) must be perpendicular (upon the plain) to the
proper Meridian. And the points also of the two sixes must be carefully set on,
whose distance from the center is the longer Radius of the Ellipsis. The reason
why these points of the proper Sines must be had, is, because the ^ew Ellipsis
(which we now look for) must pass through them both. So also the just point of
the proper 12 (or the section of the Ellipsis with the plains proper Meridian)
must be with the same care designed upon the plain. And the Subindicall line
must be drawn in its true position upon the plain, according to the proper
declination of the Index.

2. After this is done, you must call to mind what the Declination and
Reclination of your Index is (I speak now of the proper Declination and
Reclination before mentioned) as Page 172 is mentioned.

3. Then from every hour point lately made upon the plain, you are to draw
right lines, parallel to the subindicall line, and draw them both ways or on
both sides of each hour point, because you know not which of them (as yet) you
are to make use of for the pricking down of your New or Distorted Ellipsis.

4. Take the larger Radius of your primary Ellipsis (that is the length from
the center of it, to the point of the proper six a clock) and (upon the Sector,
for that Instrument is most fit for this use or practice) entering it upon the
Tangent of 45 degrees, open your Sector to tha^ length: then take over from the
reclination of the Index (the proper reclination I now speak of) counted on the
same Scale of Tangents, to the other leg, and reserve this length. That is, As
the Radius, to the Tangent of the proper reclination of the Index; So is the
larger Semidiameter of the primary Ellipsis, to a fourth quantity, which is
equal to the ^^rmer reserved length, and to that large Semidiameter or Radius,
is the Tangent of the Indexes proper Reclination.

5. This reserved length must again be entered from 90 in the line of Sines,
and the Sector set according to it, and being so set it is fit for the rest of
the work that is to ensue. Because this proportion we are to go upon: As the
Radius, to the Tangent of the Indexes proper reclination (which two terms are
they that now do set the Sector,) so is the Sine of every altitude of the
horary points in the Equinoctial, (which altitudes your Table of altitudes
computed by the forementioned Proposition, Page 96, 97, will help you unto,) so
is the Sine of every (horary-equinoctiall-points) altitude, to the Tangent of
the reclination of every one of those several hour points of the Equinoctial
Circle. Note that the reclinations here mentioned are, in respect, and from the
proper Zenith line of the plain. And note also that these Tangents thus found,
are to be estimated to the larger semidiameter of the primary Ellipsis as to
their proper Radius.

6. By these Tangents so found, you are to set on the new hour points, by
which both the new Ellipsis is to be described and also divided. I say the new
hour points are to be set on upon the lines drawn through each of the old
houre-points parallel to the Subindicall line, and they are to be s^t on from
each of the said old hour points in those lines. But which way, or on which
side of them, will be still doubted* as was before mentioned 3. And to take
away this doubt, it will be best to consider the point of the proper 12 upon
the primary Ellipsis, when the Sun is (any day) in that proper 12 point of the
heavens, then must the upright (or proper Index of the plain) cast its shadow
into the proper 12 point of the primary Ellipsis. Then further, supposing the
Sun to stand still there, imagine how your slope Index is to lie from the
proper Index, and by that you shall easily discern which way the inclination of
that Index will wry the proper point of 12 from the primary Ellipsis, and
consequently you shall be able (thereby) to judge upon which part of that line
which is drawn through the point of proper 12 (parallel to the subindicall
line) the hour (of proper 12) shall be cast into the secondary Ellipsis from
the primary. This point being set right, you may place all the hour points
from that proper 12 to the two proper sixes, the same way with this first
point: but all the other points on the remoter side of the proper 12, must go
the contrary way, as you will easily ^erceive, the very figure of the Ellipsis
will require it should so be.

As here. R S is the Subindical line, over which the Index leans.

O the point of proper 12 upon P O Q the primary Ellipsis.

O A, 9 B, ^ C, etc. parallel lines through the hour points in the primary
Ellipsis, parallel I say to the Subindicall line R S.

P Q the two proper fixes, through which always the distorted Ellipsis must
pass.

Then because the Index leans from the upright Index (or Zenith line of the
plain) toward S, therefore the proper 12 at O must go toward S, viz. to A:
and therefore also 9 B, 8 C, etc. 11 G, etc. must go the same way till you come
to the two proper sixes at P and Q, and then the hour points D E F must be set
from 3 2 1, the contrary way to that wherein the first hours were placed; as
you may plainly see the form of the new Ellipsis will require. For it cannot
possibly be made to turn again from P toward M, if it must make up an
Ellipsis, as in this case it is necessary it should do.

Now all the Tangents before found ( 5) are the lines 10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G,
etc. each set off from his proper hour point at O, A, B, C, and taken to its
true Radius, namely, the Radius P R or R Q. But if you work by the Sector (as
is taught in the 5) the very lengths there found shall be the quantities here
to be set off, namely, 10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G, 12 N, etc. without any more
relation to the Radius P R, without any more relation (I say) than what was
formerly done upon the work of the Sector 5. The like may be done for halves
and quarters of hours. And so these directions will be enough for pricking
down the hour points this way.

Another way follows.

A second way to make the Ellipsis and hours to a slope Index upon a plain:
and without trouble of making that Table before men^ioned.
THis way will be more expedite than the former. I shall here suppose these
particulars to be again done by the former precepts.

1. That the plains proper Meridian R O, is rightly placed.

2. That P R Q is drawn perpendicular thereunto.

3. That the Subindicall line R S is also rightly placed from R O the proper
Meridian.

4. That R P or R Q being determined for the Radius, R O and R K are each of
them the Sines of the plains propet Latitude.

5. From the points O and K (which are the two proper points of 12 to an Index
standing perpendicularly to the plain) let O A and K L be drawn parallel to R S
the Subindicall line.

6. Then to the Radius R P, find the Sine of the plains difference of
Longitude from your Meridian [because I purpose here to show how to work all
from your 12 a clock line, though there is no obligation to that hour, but all
may be done just in the same manner from any other hour point, if you account
the plains difference of Longitude from some one of them, which is easy to do:
as if in this Example the difference of Longitude from 12 be 36 gr. then from
11 it must be 21 gr. from 10 it must be 6 gr. from 1 a clock it must be 51 gr.
etc. to all or any of the other houres] which here for example sake we will say
to be 36 gr. With that Sine set off R T, and draw T I parallel to R O the
proper Meridian. Then again to the Radius R O, find out the Cosine of the
difference of Longitude, and set it upon the line T I, from T to I. All this
work is only to find the point of 12 in the primary Ellipsis, as you see it
expressed in the former Figure at 12. The like work you must do to find the
point of one of the hours of six in the primary Ellipsis, because six is 90
gr. from 12. [If you had chosen the point of 11 to work by, you must have looked
for the point of 5 a clock, because that point is the 90th gr. from 11, if 10,
then 4, etc.] That is, to the Radius R O find the Sine of the difference of
Longitude, and set it from R to V, and then draw V X parallel to P R the line
of the plains proper six. Then to the Radius R P find the Cosine of the said
difference of Longitude. and set it upon V X from V to X: So shall X be the
point of your own six a clock upon the proper Ellipsis; as you may see in the
Figure is expressed.

Now through these two points I and X draw right lines parallel to the
Subindical line R S. If this way of finding the two points I and X, seem not
so expedite, you must remember that all the work here is done without the two
forementioned calculated Tables.


Then knowing the Altitudes of your 12 and 6 hours (by this Lemma) find the
Sines of them to the Radius P R. Afterward say, As the Radius, to the Tangent
of the LEMMA. How to find the altitudes of your 12 and 6 hour points (in the
Equinoctial) above your Dial plain. As the Radius is to the Sine of the
Equinoctial altitude above the plain; so is the cosine of the difference of
longitude, to the sine of the altitude of 12. And so is the sine of the
difference of longitude: to the altitude of six above the plain. If you use
other hours then 12 and 6, yet you must work in the same manner still, with
the complement of the difference of longitude, and the difference of Longitude
it self, and so find two conjugate Diameters in the self same manner.
reclination of the Index; so these two Sines now found, to two other lengths.
These lengths set upon the parallel lines lately drawn, each to his proper
hour, namely from 1 to 12, and from X to 6: so have you found the two points
of 12 and 6 in your new distorted Ellipsis that is to be described. And drawing
R 12, and R 6, you shall have two conjugate Diameters, 12 R 12, and 6 R 6; and
then the rest of the work will be easy.

For if you divide R 12 (both ways) as a line of Sines (R e and R f being
Sines of 15 gr. R d and R g Sines of 30 gr. etc. R 12 and R 12 Sines of 90 gr.)
at a, b, c, d, e, R, f, g, h, i, k; you must then draw right lines through each
of those points (each one parallel to the conjugate diameter 6 R 6.) And when
that is done, make R 6 a Radius, and to that Radius make e 7, e 5, f 5, f 7, to
be the Sine of 75 gr. or one hour under 90. Make d 8, d 4, g 4, g 8, the Sine
of 60 gr. or two hours less than 90. So c 9, c 3, is the Sine of three hours
under 90: b 10, b 2, of four hours under 90: a 11, a 1, is the Sine of five
hours under 90, or of one hour. The like you may do for halves and quarters,
or what other parts you desire.

Thus much likewise for this second way.

Always you must remember to put all things upon their right Coasts.

Concerning the Zodiac, how it is to be limited and placed.
TO omit other ways, I shall here pitch upon that which is most suitable to
this manner of working upon which we now are. To the Radius P R (which is the
larger Semidiameter of the primary Ellipsis) first, find the Tangent of 23
degrees and a half; which suppose to be R x: and then to this line, being
taken as a new Radius, find the Cosine of the plains Latitude, or the Sine of
the Equinoctials altitude, which suppose to be the length R W, which is also to
be set from the center R upon the proper Meridian of the plain, as here it is
from R to W. Then through the point W, draw a line, as W Z, parallel to the
subindical line R S. When this is done you are to find the Sine of the Poles
elevation above the plain, to the same Radius R x, which Sine you may suppose
to be the length of the line ph ps. Then say again; As the Radius, to the
Tangent of the Indexes reclination; so ph ps (the Sine of the Poles elevation
above the plain) to a fourth line; which line let be represented by l o. Take
this line l o therefore, and set it upon W Z, the line formerly drawn, from W
to Z. And lastly, draw the line R Z, and make R y equal to it, so shall Z y be
the Zodiac in its true length and position: and R Z or R y shall give the half
of it, which half is to be estimated as a Tangent of 23 degrees and a half,
and so the Zodiac to be set on as has formerly been often showed.

You are here to take care that all things be set in their right position. In
this example, Z turns from W toward the left hand, because it is here supposed
that the North Pole is elevated upon the plain, and so the Axis rises out of R
above the plain: and therefore that 23 tangent degree upon that Axis a^e above
the plain. From which extreme point of 23 above the plain, you may suppose a
line to issue out parallel to the Index, which inclines from R toward S, and
therefore that line inclining so too, must project that extreme point from W
toward Z. All the reason of the work depends upon that which has been
formerly said: Namely, that both hour points of the Equinoctial, and
declination points in the Axis, are all projected from their true positions in
the Sphere (upon or unto a plain) by right lines passing through each of them,
parallel to the assigned Index. I shall need to say no more, because I think
enough (if not too much) has been said already.

This shall serve for the Effection and Demonstration also of this Proposition
or Problem.

CORONIDIS LOCO: I shall here further add; How upon an Horizontal Plain, to
describe an Ellipticall Dial to an Index lying aslope, and pointing into some
assigned Longitude and Latitude.
THis I shall add as a Corollary to that which has last of all been delivered
in general for all Plains and Indexes. Out of which Doctrine this (as a
particular branch) is deduced. It contains not any new thing, but because it
may be more frequently made use of (in practice) than other Cases, therefore I
add it, that it may also be the more plain and easy in operation. It is (for
more ease) intended that the Index should point up into some just hour Circle,
and to have some just degrees of Reclination from the Zenith of the Horizon.

I purpose not to give variety of ways, for they are showed in the last
precepts now given which are general, and may easily be brought and applied to
this particular Case, as a branch of that general before.

Suppose in our Horizon 51 gr. 30 min. in Latitude, and to two Indexes set upon
an Horizontall plain, the one pointing South-east into the morning Circle of 7
a clock, the other pointing South-west into the evening Circle of 5 a clock,
and each of them reclining 45 gr. it were required to make two Ellipticall
Dials: How must they be done?

It must be noted that the making of one will make the other, because they are
to be set upon one plain, and their differences of the Indexes Longitudes, is
in each 5 hours, and the reclination of the Index in each 45 degrees. Only the
Coasts in respect of situation must be changed, because the positions of the
Indexes are not parallel, but contrary one to the other, and so will the
Ellipses be, as you may see in the next page. The first thing to be done, is,

By having the difference of the Indexes Longitude (75 gr.) and the reclination
of the Index (45 gr.) to find what declination the Index must have: Or to
find the declination of the subindicall line from our Meridi^n.

For solution you must resolve the Sphericall Triangle P Z T, wherein P Z is 38
gr. 30 min. Z T is 45 gr. Z P T is 75 gr. all these are given: by these you may
find the declination now required, (for we suppose the Index to point up into
T) which is P Z T, Northeast, or North-west. And NORTH
If these two Ellipses in this position should be inconvenient, in regard the
two Indexes may possibly interfeer, you may change their places, and then the
two Indexes will look one from the other. And then also the Horizontall Dial
will best stand on this side of them; for they will lie most open on this side,
thus: Instead of this Horizontal Dial you may place the Circular Dial, page
120.

in this case P Z T will be 60 gr. 5 min. P T will be 39 gr. 23 min. So that
the Latitude of the Index will be 50 gr. 37 min.

When this work is done;

Draw A R B for the Meridian line of North and South, and 6 R 6 for the line of
East and West, crossing each other at R, which must be the center of the Dial,
and draw the Subindicall line R S 60 gr. 5 min. from A R upon the right Coast,
that is, North-east in the first plain, and North-west in the other plain.

Then making 6 R for Radius, find thereto the Sine of the Latitude of the
place 51 gr. 30 min. which let be the line R C, and set it upon the North part
of the Meridian line A B (I call it the Meridian line because it is the said
line upon the Horizontal plain whereupon these descriptions are now made) from
the center R to C. Then from the point C, draw C D parallel, and the same way
with R S the Subindicall line. So shall C be the point of 12 upon the primary
Ellipsis which should be drawn, if an Ellipticall Dial were to be made upon
the Horizontall plain to the upright Index, which is the proper Zenith line of
the Horizontall plain.

After this, to the same Radius R 6, find the Cosine of your Latitude, or the
Sine of the Equinoctials height, or rather (in this particular work) the depth
of it under the Horizon, which Sine let be the line E F. Then say,

As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 45 gr. the Indexes reclination; so is the
Sine E F, to a fourth; which fourth will be (in this Example) the same line
with E F, because the Tangent of 45 (the Reclination) is the same length with
the Radius, yet I will call it the fourth quantity.

Take this fourth quantity and set it off upon the line C D, from C to D, so
shall D give the point of 12 upon the distorted Ellipsis, which is the 12 that
fitteth with the reclining Index with which we have now to deal. Then draw
(from R to D) the line R D, both ways, as D R G is done.

By these means we have now got two conjugate Diameters. And now the rest of
the work will be easy. For you are only to

Divide the Semidiameters R D and R G (from R toward the extremities) each of
them as a line of Sines. That is, R m, R o, make the Sine of 1 hour or 15 gr.
So R l, R p, the Sine of 30, or 2 hours: R k, R q, the Sine of 45 gr. or 3
hours: R i the Sine of 60 gr. or 4 hours: R h the Sine of 5 hours: R D or R
12, the whole Sine or Sine of 90 gr.

Then through each of these points at h, i, k, l, m, R, o, p, q, draw a line
parallel to the other conjugate Diameter, namely, to 6 R 6.

This done, make R 6 a Radius, and to that Radius make m7, m5, 07, 05 (each of
them) a Sine of 5 hours or 75 degrees. Make l 8, l 4, p 4, p 8, a Sine of 4
hours or 60 gr. Make k9, k3; q3; q 9, (each of them) a Sine of 3 hours or 45
gr.: So i 10, i ^, must be the Sine of 2 hours: and h 11, h 1, the Sine of 1
hour or 15 gr. By this work you shall (upon the former parallel lines drawn
through h, i, k, l, m, o, p, q,) find the hour points of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; In which you are to sign out the hour
points, and through which you are to draw the Ellipsis, as you see the figure
for a pattern.

You might also have divided each of the Radiusses, noted with R 6 into parts
correspondent to a line of Sines, as you see partly done at the letters s t u,
in the last of the two former Scheams) as at s t u is expressed, and through
those points you must draw paralle^s to the other Diameter D R G. Then to the
Radius D R make s 7, s 5, the Sine of 15 gr. or 1 hour: t 8, t 4, the Sine of
30 gr. or ^wo hours: u 9, u 3, the Sine of 45 gr. or 3 hours; and so forward:
by which work you shall find the same hour points (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.)
that you did before, and so you may find out and draw the Ellipsis by them.

The same manner of work is to be performed for halves and quarters of the
several hours.

How the Zodiac is to be placed and limited.
IT is the same work with that which went before, Page 185. yet I will here
insert it again.

First, work thus. As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 23 gr. So let E F (which
was formerly found to be the Sine of the Equinoctials altitude above the
Horizon 38 gr. 30 mn. in respect of the Radius R 6, and must now again be here
used) be to a fourth quantity, which suppose to be F W. Take therefore that
length F W, and set it from R to X on the North side (in this example:) and
through X draw X g parallel to the Subindicall line R S.

Then say again. As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 23 gr. and an half; So let
R C (which was before found to be the Sine of the Latitude of the place 51 gr.
and an half in respect of the Radius R 6, and comes now to be here used again)
be to a fourth quantity, which suppose to be F z. Take therefore F z, and set
it upon the line formerly drawn through X, from X, contrary to the going of the
Subindical line, namely Southward (in this example) I say from X to g Then from
g through R, draw g R p, and make R p equal to R g, So shall g p be the Zodiac
both placed rightly and justly limited.

For division of it, you must conceive that R g or R p is a Tangent of 23 and
an half gr. the Suns greatest declination, and consequently you may by it set
on either 12 months, or 12 signs, as you will; the manner whereof has been
often showed in this Book, and especially Page 10, 11. and Page 14, 15, etc. so
that now all this work is come to an end. The Index must slide to and fro upon
the line g p (or the Index standing, the Ellipsis must move after the same
rate) g p is the proper Meridian of the Index. And if your work (when you make
this Dial, according to this case here before put) be exactly true, you shall
find the Zodiacall line p g to fall just into the hour lines of 5 and 7, as
they ought to do, because the difference of the Indexes Longitude was assumed
to be 75 gr. from the South Meridian of the place, which is the same with those
hours.

The sign must be placed at g, and at p in this Dial.

The Index must lie (when it is in the Center R) just over the line R S, and
must always move in a parallel position to it self. And it must in this
example recline 45 gr. or rise above the Horizon (or above R S making an angle
above that line 45 gr. also. But though it lie thus, yet it must move in the
line g p, and it must be so set on, that when you project the fiduciall edge of
it into a point (as workmen use to do, when with their eye they tr^e the
straightness of a line) all that edge may at once justly appear to run into
the line g p, wherever the Index be set in the Zodiac. This is to be done
carefully.

I have here set two of them, whose proper Meridians, (I mean proper to the
Index, which are the lines of their Zodiacs, viz. g p) do not lie in one and
the same right line, or parallelism (which is the samenesse of po^ition) but
make angles one to the other. This is done, because they should not lie in one
Meridian: for by that means they will always set one another, which the
Horizontal Dial with the single Ellipsis to an upright Index will not do at
all times. These two, I say, will set themselves: and if you add a common
Horizontall Dial more, to stand between them, as you see done there* they will
be the more specious and useful for setting each other.

I have set that whose Index looks North-east upon the left hand, you may set
it on the right hand if you will, and the other on the left. For this makes no
material change.

The Index is best to be a thread. Other circumstances I remember none but what
the Workman will be well able to go through.

Another way for the description of an Ellipticall Dial upon the Horizontall
plain of 51 gr. 30 min. Latitude, whose Zodiac, and the motion of the Index is
performed upon the ^oures of 7 in the morning, and of 5 in the afternoon, as
the same hours are drawn upon the common Horizontall Dial.
THis way was formerly written, and though it need not to have been here
placed, in respect the way last given is the best, yet because it does somewhat
differ from what was set down before, I thought best not to omit it: because it
is delightful to see differ^^t way ^^ meet both in one effect.

1. First, you are to get (this way) the altitudes of each hour point in the
Equino^tiall, above the Horizon, by this R^le.

As the Radius, to the Sine of 38 gr. 30 min.

So ^he Sines of 75, 60, 45, 30, 15 gr. to so many 4th Sines. The Co-sines of
these will limit out the points (upon the hours of the Horizontall Dial
formerly drawn) through which the Ellipsis upon the Horizontall plain (made for
an upright Index) is to pass: as is showed before in the 28, 29, 30, and 31,
Pages, which points in the figure of the next Page may be represented by 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, etc.

2. As the Radius, to the Tangent of the reclination of the Index;

So are the 4th Sines before found, to so many 7th terms.

3. Describe the regular Horizontall Ellipsis, as you see P O Q which you must
know to be for the Latitude of 51 gr. 30 min. and that P Q are the points of
the two sixes, and O K the points of the two twelves, viz. at Noon and
Midnight: and also that all the hours are regularly set down to O P Q K, etc.

Suppose here an Index to gr. m. Recline Northwards 45 00 Differ in Longit. S E
/ W 75 00 Consequently it must Decline North East / West 60 05 Have North
Latitude 50 37

4. From each point there set down, draw lines parallel to the Subindicall line
R S, as O A, 8 C, 9 B, etc. the angle O R S must be 60 gr. 5 min.

5. Upon these lines, and from the foresaid Ellipticall points (Northward from
the sixes toward the North, Southward from the hours on the South side of the
two sixes) set on the respective 7th terms: the first upon the line drawn from
the point of 12, from O to A: the second (proceeding from 75 in the former
work) set from 11 and 1, to D and E: the third of those 7th terms (proceeding
from 60 in the former work) set from 10 and 2, to F and G, And so all the rest
in their orders. Those from the two sixes toward 12 at Noon, must be set
Northward from the points 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. And those from the two sixes
toward 12 at night (which in the Dial stands toward the South) must be set
Southwards, in this example where the reclination of the Index is toward the
North: But if the reclination had been toward the South, it should then be
quite contrary.

6. Through these new points B F D A E G, etc. you are to draw a new Ellipsis,
which will be distorted from the former Ellipsis first drawn.

Thus the Dial it self for the hour points is limited, you may add halves
and quarters.

For the Zodiac.
IN this Example remember, that the Index declineth North East / West 60 gr. 5
min. Reclineth 45 gr. Differs in Longitude South East / West 75 gr. Has
Latitude 50 gr.37 min.

1. Because the difference of Longitude is 75 gr. from the South, therefore our
two hours of 7 in the morning, and 5 at evening, are the proper Meridians upon
which the Indexes must slide.

2. For that cause you must consider how much of those two Meridians is
intercepted between the Equinoctial and our Horizon. You may find it by this
Rule.

As the Radius, is to the Sine of 15 gr. (the Conpl. of 75,)

So is the Tangent of 38 gr. 30 min. to the Tangent of 11 gr. 38 min. which is
the arc required.

3. Because the Latitude of the Index is 50 gr. 37 min. North, the complement
of it must be 39 gr. 23 min. and so much under the Equinoctial points of 7 and
5 (and upon the hour circles of 7 and 5, which are the proper Meridians to the
two Indexes) does the proper Horizon of each of those Indexes cut the said
hours of 7 and 5 upon the South-east and South-west; and so much do they cut
the same Meridians above the Equinoctial upon the South-west and South-east.
So that upon the Southerly Coast, that portion of these Meridians which is
comprehended between the Equinoctial and our Horizon, namely 11 gr. 38 min.
must be taken from 39 gr. 23 min. and the remainder will be 27 gr. 45 min.
which is the arc comprehended between the proper Horizon of the Index and our
own Horizon, which upon the South part (in this particular Example) is below
our Horizon, on the North part above.

4. First, therefore the limitation of the Semi-Zodiacs length must be to that
Latitude of the Index or proper Horizon 50 gr. 37 min. And then secondly, the
said Zodiac first found and limited must be augmented (in this Example) in
proportion of the Radius to the Secant of 27 gr. 45 min. In this manner, by the
second rule given at the beginning of this Book Page 11. To the Radius P R
find the Cofine of the Latitude of the Index, namely the Sine of 39 gr. 23
min. which suppose to be N T.

To this length N T as a Radius, find out the Secant of the forementioned arc
27 gr. 45 min. which suppose to be N V.

This length N V shall give the Radius or Tangent of 45 gr. which is the
Tangent or Decimall Scale, out of which (either of them) you are to make your
Zodiac by the numbers of those Tables in the 6 and 7 Pages.

To this Radius or Decimall Scale, or Tangent of 45 gr. N W is the Tangent of
23 gr. and a half, wherefore the Semizodiac, R L or R M is to be made equal
in length to N W. Thus the Zodiacs length is limited.

For the position of the Zodiac, it was before said, that it must lie in the
line of 7 in the morning, or 5 in the afternoon. So in this last figure you see
it points to Z, which is 7 in the morning, (and consequently also to X, which
is 7 in the evening) in the distorted Ellipsis: because this is that Dial
whose Index looks North-east: you see it do so likewise in the first figure
Page 189, as in the second figure there it lies to 5 in the evening, and
consequently also to 5 in the morning.

Observe in the last figure (which is as true and just in the two other Page
189.) that the angle P R Z, and so Q R X, is equal to the angle made (upon our
common Horizontall Dial) between 6 and 7 a clock, namely, 18 gr. 54 min. and
consequently that 1 R 1 (a line drawn from 1 to 1 in the primary Ellipsis) is
perpendicular to the Zodiac L M: but P R C is not equal to the angle thereon
between 6 and 8 a clock; nor is it so in any other of the hours.

Observe again, that if a line be drawn parallel to O K. through A the point of
12 in the distorted Ellipsis, till it meet with the Zodiac (extended) at y;
observed (I say) that if R M be taken as a Tangent of 23 gr. (as it is taken in
this work) then will R y be the Tangent of (the complement of your Latitude,
namely) 38 gr. 30 min. And this must be so, because if the Sun should decline
38 gr.30 min. Southward, then the Sun must only peep up upon the Horizon at 12,
and consequently the shadow of the Index (namely the point of it that
intersects with your Horizon, for the Sun has no altitude at that place and
time) must run full from South to North to show the point of 12 at A.

Other observations might be made, but I go no further.

The reason of the precedent work will be demonstrated out of the former things
delivered in this Book: especially out of this last Treatise, which begins Page
171, and ends Page 186. And therefore I wholly omit to add any thing more to
this particular subject.

They that understand the things before, will not be to seek in the necessary
Demonstrations of these particulars.

A Note concerning the framing of Dials to find the Azimuth.
AS the Axis of the world is to the Equinoctial Circle, so is the Zenith line
to the Horizon of any place.

Whence it will follow: That whatsoever is in this Book declared concerning the
projection of the hour points of the Equinoctial Circle upon any plain, etc.
the same may be applied to the projection of Azimuths or points of the Horizon
upon any plain, etc. Only mutatis mutandis, ( i.e.) instead of the
Equinoctial and Poles of the World, you are to use the Horizon and the Poles
of it, ( i.e.) Zenith and Nadir.

Then for the Zodiac (which depends upon the Scale or Tangents of Declination,
which exceed not 23 and a half gr. you are to use (in the Azimuthal work) a
Scale of Tangents (rightly limited) going up from oo to so much altitude as you
mean to use (if it be for the Suns course, to 62 gr. here at London.)

As there you rectify the Index to the Declination of the Sun: So here you
must (answerably) rectify it to the Suns altitude taken by observation, and
then the Index being set to the altitude gives the Azimuth for that moment and
no more.

COROLLARY.
Therefore, to find the Azimuth by this way, you must take the Suns Altitude,
and so find the Azimuth for one moment only.

Quest. But why is there so little said here of this?

Answ. Because it is a thing of no use, but of a great deal of trouble: for the
altitude is to be observed, and the Index set thereto every moment,

Quest. Is it not so too in the Dials before described?

Answ. No; for there the Index set once, may serve in that place one whole day
very well, because the Suns declination does not alter much in one day.

Quest. Why then is this Azimuthal business mentioned at all?

Answ. Because the Reader might see, that the Author of this Treatise was not
ignorant of it: yet it is mentioned also that if any delight in such a
curiosity he may to his liking effect it.

And for a full conclusion note, that, All the former Dials may be made in a
Craticular way.
