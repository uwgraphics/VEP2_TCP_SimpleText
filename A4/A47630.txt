Consisting of six BOOKS. The two first treating of RELIGION and LEARNING. The
four last of RELIGIOUS or LEARNED MEN In an Alphabetical Order. A Work
seasonable for these times, wherein RELIGION and LEARNING have so many Enemies.

Dunstans-Church in Fleetstreet, M.DC.LVI.

TO THE Right Reverend JAMES USHER Archbishop of Armagh.
HONORED SIR,
BOth the Subject I handle, and my own special Obligation are a just Apology
for my Dedication of this Treatise unto you. I treat of Religion and Learning,
a noble Argument, and (were it answerably handled) well-worthy of so noble a
Patronage. Learning is the great Ornament of a man, and true Religion (which is
an honoring of God suitably to his Excellency) is the great Ornament of a
Christian. Where there is a happy conjunction of a learned Head, and a sincere
and truly religious Heart, there is a Person every way accomplished. Bishop
Juell is frequently for this reason styled, The Jewel of Bishops; and of Dr
Raynolds it is said, Incertum est fuerit doctior an melior.

D r Rivet and Peter du Moulin, two French Divines are famous for their eminent
Piety, learned Writings, and fifty years preaching. Your Name is also precious
in all the Reformed Churches, witness the Dedication of diverse learned De Dieu
in Acta Apost. Span^em. Dub. Evang. part 2 da. Bootii Animadver. Sac. Mori
Calvinus. Cartw in Exodus
Treatises to you, and the honorable mention which many learned men frequently

make of you One thing I shall desire to specify, which I look upon as one of
your great Accomplishments, your humble and affable Disposition, both in a free
admission of the very meanest; and also in a ready communicating of your self
unto them, which noble quality being in you when you were at the highest (as I
have heard) is therefore the more commendable. Your sending to Samaria for
several Copies of the Samaritane Pentateuch, bringing them first into Europe,
and dispersing them many ways, and also your purchasing at a dear rate the
Syriack-Bible, and many other Syriack-Books from Syria, and your free imparting
them to such Scholars as were skillful in that Language, is deservedly
celebrated by M r Seldom in his Preface ad Marmora Arundeliana, De Dieu in his
Epistle Dedicatory to the Acts, and D r Boot in his index Autorum before his
Animadversiones Sacrae. Praesulum decus the Iacobus Armachanus Gatak. Cinnus.
c. 5.
Your Liberality to such as are in a necessitous condition, is also well known.
It is a usual Maxim or Proverb, That the greatest Scholars are not the best
Preachers; and Queen Elizabeth was wont to say, That she had made a Bishop, and
marred a Preacher. You have really confuted both these, by your plain and
powerful Preaching, and by your constant laboring (for above fifty years) in
that sacred Function, even after the time, that through a natural decay you
were unable to read your Text. Therein well fullfilling your Motto, both in
your Episcopal and Archiepiscopall Seal, Vae mihi si non Evangeliza vero.

Could your leisure have permitted you to have heard me read this whole Work
to you, as you did vouchsafe me the favor, to hear part of it, it might have
been more exact in it self, and so more worthy your Countenance You were
pleased to commend to me some of the Authou^s I made use of, and to supply me
also with some choice Books out of your well-furnisht Library; some of the
Observations also I was beholding to you for, to you (I say) who are (...), a
breathing Library, Eunapius de Longino in Porphyr. p. 12.
and walking Study. This, with what I before alleged, may justify this
honoring of my Book with your Name, the Dedication of it to you being as
proper, as that of Tullies Book De senectute ad senem; or that of Hermannus
Hugo De origin scribendi ad Scribanium. The Argument also is seasonable for
these tim^s, wherein Learning has other enemies besides the ignorant, if a
Governor of a College in the University, may not go for an Ignaro also; and
wherein the vitals of Religion are in so much danger, partly by Scepticisme of
the one side, and questioning almost all the great Articles of Christian Faith,
and by Libertinisme on the other side, as if the Primitive Christians, Martyrs,
and old Puritans, had been more precise then wise. It is your honor therefore
in such a declining Age, when others dispute away Truths and Duties, to stand
for Orthodox Truths, and practice holy Duties. Psalm. 119.126, 127. Old Age
(says Solomon) is a Crown when it is found in the way of Righteousness. As God
has enriched you with large Abilities, so lay them out still for the good of
the Church, that so you may prove a happy instrument whilst you live of Gods
Glory, which is the desire of

SIR Your most Affectionate Friend and Servant EDWARD LEIGH.

To the Judicious and Candid READER.
READER,
WHen I first pitched my thoughts upon this Subject, I intended only to give
some brief Character of some Humanists, and some of the chief reformed Writers,
but in the prosecution of my Design, meeting with diverse Elogies and apt
descriptions of some of the chief Popish Writers, I thought it not amiss to
make the Work more general. A learned Divine inquired of me, when my Body of
Divinity was coming forth, Whether I treated there of Religion, seeming to
wonder, that many who published Systemes of Divinity, said nothing of so
useful a Subject, whereabout also many Questions might be raised and
discussed. I thereupon bethinking with my self, that I might conveniently treat
of it in this Book, accordingly made Religion and Learning the Argument of the
two first Books, and those that were eminently Religious or Learned, are
mentioned according to the order of the Alphabet in the four following Books.
But I take liberty therein by reason of the Alphabetical order, and because I
could not so properly refer them to the second Book, to speak of several
Bibles, Councels, Confessions, Proverbs, and the Talmud, in the letter of the
Alphabet, whereto they belong, the knowledge thereof being helpful to
Scholars. Besides, where I speak of Charles the Great and the fifth, I also
mention Charles the ninth, both because I met with an excellent Character of
him in Thuanus, and also because he was a special instance of Gods retaliating
Justice, for shedding the blood of Protestants in the Parisian Massacre. I may
perhaps also mention an Heretic that was not famous either for Learning or
Piety. I thought good to advertise the Reader hereof, lest he should wonder
else when he meets with these particulars. The first Book is concerning
Religion, that it is, what it is, its Antiquity, the true and false Religions,
the Reformed Religion, and some Questions about Religion are also discussed.
The second Book is concerning Learning, its Excellentcy, Usefulness, of the
Liberal Arts, the Languages, Universities. In the four last Books, my intention
was to speak of such as were Zealous for the true Religion, or eminent for
Learning, either as general Scholars, or peculiarly learned in any kind. As
the Argument is double, Religion and Learning, and the persons double,
Religious and Learned, so I should be glad, if it might conduce any way to the
advancing of the esteem at least of the true Religion and Learning, to the
settling of men in the true Religion, and encouraging of them in all good
Literature. You have here a Catalogue of the famous Witnesses of Christ against
Antichrist, of the Champions for Truth, the glorious Reformers and blessed
Martyrs, to win you to the liking of, and constancy in the true Religion. You
have also here a roll of the famous Linguists and Artists, the learned Lawyers,
Physicians, Divines, ancient and modern, Protestants and Papists, the learned
Poets, Philosophers, Historiographers, Orators, learned men and women, to
allure you to a good opinion at least of Learning, as that which is so many
ways useful both to Civil and Christian societies.

I might here expatiate in the just praises of England, for the purity of its
Doctrine in Religion, and also for the many learned Authors See Burtons

here bred and fostered. But because I speak somewhat of it in the Book, I
shall be the briefer here.

As the Separation made by our first Reformers was most just for the Idolatry
and Cruelty of the Romish Church, Revel. 17.5, 6. notwithstanding the great
(...) of Schism against us by the Romanists, so the English have since the
first Reformation here happily begun in the Reign of that pious Prince Edward
the sixth, and sealed with the blood of many holy Martyrs in the days of Queen
Mary, maintained and countenanced that pure Religion which may fitly be called
their Palladium. England is celebrated abroad by the name of the ringing
Island, and it may justly ascribe the great fertility and plenty of outward
blessings it enjoyes, to the free entertainment it has given to the Gospel,
and the true Professors of it. But let us take heed of imitating Holland too
much in an Universal Toleration of all Religions, shall, I say, or opinions,
least what Baudius applies to them, agree too fitly to us, Sed vivimus hic non
solum in regno libertatis verum etiam licentiae. Baud. Epist. cent. 2. Epist.
58.

They were wont by way of scorn to call all Transalpines that were not Italians.
For learned men, if there were Athenae Anglicae, as there are Athenae Batavae
and Belgicae, and as Leland, Balaeus, Godwin of old, so some judicious pen
would reckon up the Viri Illustres of later times here in England, I doubt not
but there would be a great number of English Heroes.

Frenchmen. Archbishop Spotswood in his History of Scotland, mentions many
learned Scotchmen, l. 1. p. 22, 23.

I shall endeavor to marshall up some of our English Scholars.

For the multitude of Divines and Preachers of this Nation, I shall need to say
little, it being generally acknowledged, that we herein surpass the rest of
the Reformed Churches. The ancient great lights of our Church were Juell,

Some may perhaps think it may savor of flattery for me to mention the living
amongst the other learned men deceased, Nam vivorum ut magna admiratio, ita
censura difficilis est, Paterc. Hist. l. 2.

To that I answer, Some of those Latin Authors, which write of illustrious
men, speak of diverse that were then living.

2. Those that are well acquainted with my temper, will not, I suppose, much
charge me with adulation, and the ordinary way of honorably mentioning Authors
in quotations little differs from this.

I hope what I say in that kind will encourage and not puff up any.

As I may through mistake insert some here, who perhaps were neither eminent
for Religion nor Learning, so I hope no man will imagine that I take upon me to
give so complete an enumeration, as to omit none, that were too difficult a
Province for me to undertake, if the most here be such as will agree with the
running Title, I hope none will interpret it exclusively, as if these alone
were such. I have cause to bless God that this Subject is profitable, as those
others I have formerly labored in, and hope, that as they have been generally
well-esteemed of (for who can expect to please all?) so this likewise will be
favorably entertained by those that are candid and judicious, which is the
desire of

Thy Affectionate Friend EDWARD LEIGH.

A TREATISE OF RELIGION AND Learning. BOOK 1. OF RELIGION.
CHAP. I. Of Religion in general.
RELIGION is the chief thing which distinguishes a man from a beast; the
Elephant and some bruits have a shadow of reason, but Religion is peculiar to
men, or reasonable creatures at least; therefore Gesner (as I remember) says,
the Pigmies are a kind of Apes, and not men, because they have no Religion.

I shall in the entrance to this Work show 1. That Religion is. 2. What
Religion is.


1. That it is.

Some of the Arguments which prove that there is a God, prove also that there
is Religion, for Religion gives God that honor and homage that is due unto him.

The working of Conscience proves that there is a God, and it also proves a
Religion. The knowledge and sense of sin is in all men's hearts; the Heathens
had their turpia and honesta; a great part of Religion lies in a kindly fear of
sin, and the fear of punishment after sin proves it also, that there is
some Religion.

2. The flying to refuge in troubles, and the praying also in straights, Jon.
3.6. is a proof that there is a God, and also that there is a Religion.

3. It has been the practice of all people ever since the world was, to use
some religious Rites. Abel sacrificed, See Genesis 4. ult. The most ancient
Heathen Histories mention their Religion. Plutarch says, the first care their
Lawgivers had; was about their Gods and their Worship. So all Nations
acknowledge that there is a God and therefore to be worshipped. Religion is the
glory and excellency of Angels, in that they adore him that is better then
themselves: it was the excellency of Adam in Paradise, being the effect of the
Image of God upon the soul. The Jews were once the only Nation whom God
honored, by intrusting them with his Oracles, Romans 9.4. compared with c. 3. v.
2. The embracing, maintaining and practicing of the true Religion, is the only
way to make a Nation or Person strong and peaceable, 2 Chronicles. 11.16, 17.
prosperous and plentiful in all outward blessings, 2 Chronicles. 11.5, 12. 2 Samuel
6.12. For those that honor God he will honor, and those that despise him,
shall be ligh^ly esteemed, 1 Samuel 1.30.

2. What Religion is.

Of the word.

Religio Hebraeis vocatur (...) Exodus 22.26. venit autem ^ verbo (...) quod est
servire and colere. (...) Graeci vocant, ut Act. 26.35. Haec vex a verbo
derevatur, quod servire significat and colere. Aug. Tom. 1. lib. de vera
religione, religionem a religando deducit, quod cultu Dei animas nostras
religemus Deo a quo defecerimus. Ac Tom. 5. de Civit Dei, l. 10. c. 4. a
recligendo derivat, quod bac Deum, quem amiseramus, negligentes, denno
religimus, sen recligimus. Zanch. Tom. 4. l. 1. de Religione. c. 13. Qui omnia,
quae ad cultum Deorum pertinerent, diligenter pertractarent, and tanquam
religerent, sunt dicti religiosi, ait M. ^ullius. Atque hanc sententiam
sequutus est Arnobius l. 4. adversus Gentes. Meliwsaam^^ ejust dis^epulus
I^^ctantius* rel^gionem, a religando appellatam existimavit. Herald.
Animadvers. ad Arnob. l. 4. Religiose d^ci vi^entur, ^uoniam, quae ad^cultum
divinum pertinent diligenter pertractent and quasi relegant. Isid. l. 10 Etymol
c. ^7. A^ii p^ant Religios^m dic^um esse ^ relinquendo, eo quod propter
sanctitatem aliquam sepositum sit, and a nostris (...) remotum id quod est
religiose consecratum. Azor. Institut. moral. l. 9. c. 10.
The Hebrew word comes from a verb which signifies to serve or worship, see
James 1. ult: for Religion, the Syriack interpreter has a word which signifies
service, worship. Austin and Lactantius derive the Latin word a religando: it
is the great bond to tie us to God and to man. Others a reeligendo, or a
relegendo, because by the often reading and choice of holy books Religion is
learned.

Religion is either true or false.

The true Religion is that whereby we serve the true God and with true worship.

Romani.
False religion is either that, whereby either we serve the false god, as the
Romans in times past, or whereby we serve the true God with false worship, as
the present Romans. Romanenses. Superstitio est, ubi aut falsi dii, aut falso
and inani cultu colitur Deus: contra religio, ubi verus Deus veroque cultu
colitur. Impictas vero est, ubi nulia prorsus est religio, and tales homines
proprie impii vocantur, qualis fuit Diagoras, qui (...) dictus est. Zanch. Tom.
4. l. 1. De Religione, c. 13. Idem sunt rcipsa verus Dei cultus, and vera
religio, sicut contra falsus and impius cultus idem est atque superstitio,
falsaque religio, Zanch. Tom 4. l. 1. De Religione, c. 13. 1. Religio accipitur
pro ratione seu modo colendi Deum, vel pro orma culius exterm and publiti qui
Deo exhibetur, sive recte, sive perperam. 2. Pro virtute qua Deum recte
agnoscimus, and sancte a. pure oblimus juxta normam in verbo Dei praescriptam
seu pro interna and sincera animi pietate a qua dicimur religiosi. Ra^a. esa.


Religion may be thus defined.

It is an officious action, debt, duty, worship or service, inward and outward,
which God requires and man is bound to perform according to his will, by
virtue of that bond whereby he is tied to God.

True Religion is the true service of the true God. Morn. de verit. Christ.
relig. cap. 24.

One says, True Religion is the right performance of those duties which we owe
to the one only true God.

The Antiquity of Religion.

Genesis 4.26. Vide Polyd. Verg de Rerum Invent. l. 1. c. 5. and l. 4 c 1. (...)
su^t auni form, mibus, vel plus aliqui^. Ex quo orpimus esse Christians, and

Flor. Hist. p. 61. Omnis autem religio ex duabut po^issi uum rebus aestimati

Ecclesia Romana. p. 106.
It was in the beginning of the world. We read of Sacrifices offered by Cain
and Abel; and likewise the distinction of clean and unclean beasts.

The Christian Religion is now of some standing.

There are resemblances of all the gifts of man in the Beasts, but none of
Religion, this is the chiefest perfection of man.

Azorius says, Religion is a Moral and not a Theological virtue, for God is
not the object of it, but the honor and worship of God, which Religion gives
to the divine Majesty.

Rules to know the true Religion,

False Religions love obscurity, but the true Religion sets forth her
doctrine to view; The Mahumetans, Turks, Religio e^t quae Deo debitum cultum
aff^rt. Aquin. 2^^ 2dae. qu. 81. Artic. c. 5. Conclus. Religio vera fidem
quidem requirit, sed perficitur duabus max me rebus, beneficentia and vitae
puritate. Grot. in Jac 1.27. Religionem Christianam solam ex omnibus, quae
hactenus in mundo public receptae sunt, esse veram inde demonstratur, quod
illa sola ^erae, ac pro^nte and divinae R^ligionis not as habeat. Notae autem
infalliviles Religionis ver^ co^scientia hominum id ipsis dicta^te haesunt:
Primo. quod in illa verus Deus Creator, and Guberna^o omnium rerum, solus
agnoscatur, and colatu^, sicutin sola Religione Christiana sit. Nam Ethnica,
quae post Christianam est vetustissima, creaturas, imo and malos Gemor pro Dijs
colit; Tur^ica vero, and Judaica bodierna, etsi de vero Deo glorietur,
praeterquam quod ipsarum origo in mundo est recens, very Dei atque operum ejus
notitiam ineptiss^ais fabulis and commentis conspureat. Secunda verae
Religionis nota est: Quod in ea ^ola vera ratio explicetur, per quam homo
peccator cum Deo reconciliari possir, quam in Christiana sola etiam reperire
est, quia in illa sola sacrificium peccatis expiandis idoneum, and irae
Deiplacandae sufficiens invenitur. Tertia Religionis verae nota est: Quod in ea
vera and perfecta officia erga Deum and proximum p^ae^cribantur; quod in nulla
quoque quam Christiana religione fit. Walaei Desputat 1a. De S. Script. necess
and Author. Vide ejus Loc. commun. de S. Scriptura comparat. Relig. Christian
cum Gentel. Turcic. Judaie.
and Persians have their service in the Arabic tongue, which the people
understand not. The Jews read in their Synagogues, the Law and the Prophets in
the Hebrew tongue, whereas the most part of their people have but little or no
understanding thereof. The Papists have the Scriptures and their Liturgy in
Latin.

2. False Religion is loose, but the true Religion requires strict and holy
walking, James 1.26, 27. Eae Religio praeferenda quae favet puritati and
sanctitati vitae. Lessius. Fornication was scarce a sin among the Heathens;
Mahomet was dissolute himself, and allowed his Disciples to be sensual; The
Jews practice Usurie; Abominable uncleanness is permitted and practiced at
Rome.

3. The Scripture is the only rule to judge of true and false Religions, Deuteronomy
13.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 These. 5.21. 1 John 4.1, 2.

The marks of the true Religion laid down by Walaeus are; Animadventendum est
primum Decalogi praeceptum unum cole Deum ad Religionem pertinere, cujus est
justum ac debitum Deo cultum defer.
1. The true knowledge of the true God. 2. A true way of reconciling man with
God. 3. True worship of God.

Zanchy lays down these Theses.

1. True Religion (which is the same with piety) consists in the true worship
of God, both external and internal, but especially in the internal.

2. True Religion knows and worships only one God, Exodus 20.3. God will have
no companion in his majesty and worship. The wisest Philosophers and best Poets
among the Gentiles, thought the same; as both Justin Martyr and Clemens
Alexandrinus, and other Fathers have abundantly demonstrated. Azor. Institut.
Moral. l. 9 c. 10. Lactantius one of the most eloquent of the Latin Fathers
has written gravely both of the true and false Religion.


3. The true Religion worships God with no other worship then that which he
has prescribed, viz. with true piety of mind.

External Rites, Ceremonies, Sacrifices (which also are (...) worship) in the
Scripture, are only exercises of inward piety, and therefore are so far
acceptable to God as they proceed from inward piety.

Christian Religion was planted by the power of God: As it appears,

1. By its speedy propagation, Romans 1.8. Col. 1.6. 1 John 5.4.

2. All these things were foretold long since by the Sybils and Prophets.

3. From the nature of the Doctrine of Christ, the efficacy of his Doctrine,
The Divine authority of the Christian Doctrine confirmed.
and the authority of the Teacher: What Doctrine did Christ and his Apostles
use to persuade their hearers? Give to the poor, Give your cheeks to the
smiter, Do good to your enemies, Deny your selves, Take up your Cross, You
must look for many afflictions and persecutions if you follow us. O suasionem
dissuasionis omnis undique plenam, says Facinus. Yet Christ persuaded suddenly
many and great men; and the reason is given Mark. 1.22. Christ taught with
authority, not as the Scribes and Pharisees.

4. From the sublimitie and symphonie Habent scriptores illi nescio, quid pium
and Augustum, atque id quod mirabile est, inter se quidem commune a caeteris
omnibus penitu^ alienum, quod significat omnibus illis Deum prae catrris
sparassc. M. Fic. de Rel Christ. c. 8.
and certainty of the books of the old and new Testament. Other Authors doubt
and waver. 1 John 1.2, 3. and 5.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 1 John 4.13, 14, 15, 16.

5. The purity of this Doctrine and the amplitude of the Promises.

These reasons and more are alleged by Marsilius Ficinus in his 8th and 35
Cha^ters of his excellent book De religione Christianae.

The glory of a Religion lies in three things, 1. The excellency of Rewards. 2.
The purity of the Precepts. 3. The sureness of the principles of trust.


Let us examine the Christian Religion by these things, and see if it can be
matched elsewhere.

Neque terrena praemia, ut leges aliae, sed caelestia pollicetur. Ficin. de
Relig. Christ. cap 8.
1. The reward is the eternal enjoyment of God in Christ, Psalm. 6.11. 2 Cor.
4.16. Heb. 11.6.

2. The purity of precepts: Our holy Religion does not only forbid sins, but
lusts, Psalm. 19.9. 1 Pet. 2.21. The Law of God reaches not only to the act,
but to the aim and intention in duties.

The glory of Religion has been to have holy Martyrs and in^amous Persecutors.
Justinus Philosophus and Martyr, de conversione sua, transituque ab Ethnicismo
verba faciens, ingenue fatetur, se Platonicae sectae addictum, cum Christianos
velut de plaustro omni conviciorum genere proscindi, and tamen impavidos omnium
aetatum dignitatumque homines ad mortem accedere animadverteret, cogitare
caepisse, fieri non posse, ut ejusmodi homines improbi voluptatibus dediti
vitae hujus amantes jure habeantur, qui etiam cum dignitate vivendi condition
sibi oblata, mori malunt, quum Christum abnegare. Nullum enim tale praefidium e
Platonis Philosophia morti opponi posse, vir prudens and ingeniosus facile
colligebat. Jac. Gryn. Epist. l. 1. Epist. 41. Vide plura ibid.
3. The sureness of the principles of trust, Psalm. 19.7. Psalm. 93.5. they are
called The sure mercies of David. Heb. 12.28.

No other Religion but the Christian shows the way to salvation, nor gives
assurance of salvation; nor no people but Christians have assurance.

Means to keep us constant in the Truth of Religion.

1. We should ground our selves well in the knowledge of it, 2 Timothy 3.14. Col.
1.23. For which end, 1. Acquaint thy self well with the main principles of
Religion, this is the foundation, Heb. 6.1. 2. Receive nothing in Religion upon
the credit of any man, Acts 17.11. 1 Thessalonians. 5.21.


2. Love and practice that thou know, Psalm. 86.11. and 119.3. Luke 8.15.

3. Take heed of declining from, or forsaking the least truth, Psalm. 119.127,
128.

4. Be constant in a conscionable use of all Gods holy Ordinances, 1. The
Ministry of the Word, Ephesians. 4.14. Heb. 10.23, 25. 2. The Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, it is the Sacrament of our nourishing and strengthening in the
State of Grace, and Christ therein is received as bread, the use whereof is to
strengthen man's heart, Psalm. 104.15. 3. Prayer, Psalm. 86.16. and 119.117.

Aut igitur cuncti nihil laeti habere debuerunt, si malorum causa nos sumus:
(nationibus enim sumus in cunctis) aut cum mixta videatis cum incommodis laeta,

The Gentiles accused Christians of impiety, because leaving the ancient
Religion (said they) they passed to a new superstition, and forsook the worship
of the Gods; whence also they collected, that all the evils which infested men
were sent by the angry Gods, and therefore they ascribed to them the calamities
of the world: To whom Tertullian well answered, That many of those calamities
upon Cities and Islands happened before Christ's coming.

Whether men may be saved in any Religion?

The Socinians say a man of any persuasion may be saved, if he does not walk
contrary to his light.

The Scripture speaks but of one faith, Ephesians. 4.5. and that also the Nations
should be brought to God by this Gospel, Matthew. 24.14. None can be saved
without Christ, 1 Cor. 3.11. There is no other foundation of hope and comfort,
no other name under heaven, Act. 4.12. I am the way, Joh. 14.6.

CHAP. II. Of the chief False Religions.
THere are many false Religions, but the principal are these four. Paganism.
Infideles omnes populi appellantur in libris veteris testamenti Goiim, and inde
in ^postolicis libris, and Evangelistarum monumentis (...) nempe; quia praeter
populum Deo peculiarem Iudeae terminis inclusum, and postea praeter paucos
fideles, gentes omnes aliae and nationes vero Deo ignorato Idolis serviebant.
Cum Christiani autem imperatores terrarum orbi praefiderent, and Ecclesiae
Christo ubique conderentur; contra Idolorum templa clauderentur and
everterentur, simul cum appellationis causa appellatio quoque ipsa mutata est,
and pro nationibus, Gentibus, Ethnicis, Pagani appellari caeperunt, qui prope
non amplius terrarum orbem occupantes sed in augustum coarctati, and quasi
pagis tantum quibusdam conclusi. Nec dubito quin hac vera appellationis ratio
fucrit, non quod eruditi homines excogitarint, videntur ea omnia (quod
eruditissimorum hominum pace dixerim) a rei veritate paulo longius abesse.

First, Paganism.

The Heathen are of Christians called Pagani, because the people who lived in
Country Villages (which are properly called Pagani, a Pago, and that of (...),
as Pomp. Festus says, Quia eadem aqua uterentur) remained for the most part
Heathenish, after the Cities generally were converted to Christianity. B. Down.
Defense of his Sermon, l. 2. chapter 7.

The Apostles first preached in great Cities, where Religion by Gods blessing
upon their labors did first take place, which was a cause why the name of
Pagans (which properly signifies Country People) came to be used in common
speech for the same that Infidels and unbelievers were.

There is Infidelitas negativa, or purae negationis, as in Pagans and Turks, to
whom God never yet vouchsafed the means of grace. 2. Pravae dispositionis, by
which one refuses to believe, Isa. 7.9. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10.

The condition of the Pagans or Heathens is excellently described, Ephesians. 2.12.
At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the Commonwealth of
Israel, and strangers from the Covenants of promise, having no hope, and
without God in the world.

The Scripture still brands the Heathens, Jer. 10.25. Matthew. 6.32. 1 Pet. 4.3.
the Heathens and Publicans are joined together.

They knew that there was a God, Romans 1.18, 19. and 2.14. and the wisest of
them worshipped the true God, Act. 17.23. but 1. Non est quaestio de gentilibus
ad Ecclesiam Israeliticam congregratis, an illi salutis participes facti
fuerint, sed de gentilibus extra Ecclesiam. 2. Non est quaestio de notitia
naturali, qualis fuit in primo homine ante lapsum, sed de notitia naturali,
qualis est in hominibus post lapsum, extra verbi revelationem, an per illam
gentiles luce verbi and cognitione Christi destituti salutem consequi
potuerunt. Gerh. Confess. Cathol. lib. 2. Special. ^rtic. 2. c. 4. Vide plura
ibid.
Their knowledge was imperfect and confused. 2. Languishing and fainting, mixed
with many doubts, Aristotle and Plato the wisest of them doubted about God, and
the immortality of the soul. 3. They had no knowledge of Christ and the Trinity
of persons. No man can come to the Father but by me, he is called the Way, Joh.
5.23. and 17.3. 1 John 2, 23. and 5.11, 12. Act. 4.12.

Secondly, For their life and conversation, they had no true piety in them.

1. Because they had not faith, which only purifieth the heart, Romans 10.17.

2. They were not renewed or converted, every one must be regenerated, a new
creature.

3. They had not a right end in what they did.

4. All their morality was defiled with idolatry, Romans 1.23, 25. They became
vain in their imaginations, v. 21.

The Stoics were the strictest Sect of all the Philosophers, yet there was a
great difference between their discipline and the discipline of Christians;
they commanded to give to the needy, but forbad to be moved with pity, because
pity is a passion which a wise man should be free from: but that is a strange
wisdom which takes away all humanity, that is Philanthropy, b^ which name the
Grecians call pity.

Therefore their state before the Gospel comes to them, must needs be woeful
and damnable.

Lucretius Carus the Philosopher and Poet, inveighing sore against the
superstitious Religion of the Gentiles, and recounting the wicked fact of King
Agamemnon in sacrificing his only daughter Iphigenia, being a young damsel of
excellent beauty, to the intent to please the wrathful gods, hinderers of his
navigation, after he had said all, closed it up in this one verse, spoken in
Epiphonema.

Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum. They shall be judged by the Law of
nature, they having never heard of Christ nor his word, shall not be punished
for not believing such things.

The Heathens were Polytheists, worshippers of many Gods.

The Pantheon at Rome was built by Domitian the Emperor Anno gratiae 85. that
is, Matthew. Westminster. Flor. Hist p. 55. Id. ibid. p. 109.
a Temple for the honor of all the Gods; or rather devils, Eo quod in eodem
quondam omnium non Deorum, sed daemonum cultus agebatur. The Scripture
frequently calls such Idol-worship the worship of devils.

They generally worshipped the Sun, as Macrobius and others show.

It is a question, An ex meliore usu legis naturae pendeat revelatio Evangelii,
whether the revelation of the Gospel depend on the better use of the Law of
Nature?

Walaeus in his answer to Corvinus, c. 5. alleges Romans 3.11. and Psalm. 14.3.
and says, that experience gives testimony to this assertion of the Scripture,
for there was never any found amongst those Nations, to whom the Gospel was not
preached, who drew the knowledge of Christ from the light of nature, or to whom
God miraculously revealed Christ for his improving the Law of Nature. Cornelius
lived at Caesarea, with the Jews. Job was of the posterity of Abraham, he
instructed his posterity* Genesis 18.19. nay God often passed by those who most
improved the light of nature, and revealed Christ by the Gospel to those who
were more wicked and perverse then they, Deuteronomy. 32.28. Ezekiel. 3.16. and 5.6.
Matthew. 11.21. not to Socrates, Plato, Aristides, Cato, Jaudatissima inter
Gentiles nomina, but to more wicked.

Sed patibulo affixus interrit. Quid istud ad causam? Neque cuim qualitas and
deformnas mortis dicta ejus immutat aut facta, aut eo minor videbitur

But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the
Greeks foolishness, 1 Cor. 1.23.

The Jews mock us, because we had such a Messiah which cried out, My God, my
God, why have thou forsaken me? If he was God (say they) why did he so cry out?
did not all troubles come to him by his own will?

Wisdom is justified of her children.

We have those famous Apologies of Justin Martyr, who dedicated his first to
the Roman Senate, Anno Aerae ^hristi 303. Persecutionis flammae ol^um

and his second to Antoninus Pius Augustus; and that of Tertullian, who in the
time of Severus the Emperor, seeing Christians persecuted only for the Name,
as a sufficient crime, wrote his Learned, large and accurate Apology,
dedicating it to the Emperor and his Son. He is styled by Pierius
Valeriaenus, Acerrimus Christiani nominis propugnator.

The wiser Heathens did call the Christians Idiots, and reproached them as
illiterate.

But the Atheist cannot name any age wherein the Heathen had an Oliver to
oppugn our Christian profession, but we had a Rowland to defend it. If they
had a Porphyrie or Celsus to oppose Philosophy against it, we had an Arnobius,
an Origin to maintain and follow Christianity. If they had a Symmachus, we had
an Ambrose and Prudentius: If they had a Julian, we had a Gregory Nazianzen.

Those Atlassia of Christian Religion equalled the most renowned. Heathens in
all Learning (as well as they exceeded them in true Religion:) Such among
others were Justin a Philosopher and Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Cyprian,
Origin, (Learned to a miracle) Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius, Epiphanius, the
three Learned Gregory's, Nazianzene, Nyssene, Thaumaturgus, both the Basils,
Athanasius, Cyrill, Minutius Faelix, Arnobius, Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrose,
Lactantius, Austin, Prosper, Hilary, Prudentius, and others, of most eminent
Learning, piety and courage, who defended the Christian Religion against proud
Heathens and pestilent Heretics of those days. Dr Gaudens Defense of the
Ministry, page 407.

England suffered the most hard and shameful servitude, especially in the

Some say, England was the first Kingdom in all the world, which received the
Gospel with the countenance of Supreme Authority, it was prima provinciarum
quae amplexa est fidem Christi, so Sabellicus and others.

By whom the Christian Religion was first brought hither, is disputed, some say
by James the brother of John, some Simon Zelotes, some Peter and Paul, others
Joseph of Arimathea, some Gregory the Pope.

with other Martyrs that were bound with coards to execution, and he for his
dignity was not bound, he cried, Cur non and me quoque torque donas, and

IN the Year of our Lord 666, the detestable Sect of Mahumet began to take
strength and place.

Moamed or Machumed an Ishmaelite being a poor man till he married a widow
wealthy and of high countenance: having the falling sickness, whereby the widow
was sorry that she matched with him, persuaded her by himself and others, that
his fits were but a trance, wherein he talked with the Angel Gabriel. The woman
made women believe that her husband was a Prophet: afterward men by help of
certain Heretics set the false Prophet forward. From Judaism Arius,
Nestorius, and his own brain he frames a Doctrine. He prevails so by force
of his wild company and guile deceiving the simple, that before his death he
wins Arabia, and the Countries about Euphrates. The sons of Ishmael
ashamed of Agars name, borrow from Sara the term of Saracens. Brought. Concent.

He gave sundry Laws to his followers, patched of many Sects and Religions
together: He taught them to pray ever to the South, and as we keep the Sunday,
so they keep the Friday, which they call the day of Venus. He permitted them to
have as many Wives as they were able to maintain; to have as many Concubines as
they list; Mahomet was born in the Country of Arabia. His Father was a Persian,
his mother an Ishmaelite, which Ishmaelites being a people of Arabia, were
called then Agarens, which term Mahumet afterward turned to the name of
Saracens. Vide Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 7. c. 8.
to abstain from the use of wine, except on certain solemn days in the year;
to have and worship only one God omnipotent, saying that Moses and the Prophets
were great men, but Christ was greater, and greatest of all the Prophets, as
being born of the Virgin Mary by the power of God, without man's seed, and at
last was taken up to heaven, but was not slain, but another in his likeness for
him. Fox's Act. and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 161. See 963, 964.

The Persians believe in Mahomet, yet the Turks and they differ in opinion
about him, the one pursuing the other with most deadly hatred, insomuch that
there is almost continual War between them.

In Alcorano Libro Legis little habetur, Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum de Maria
Virgin fuisse conceptum and natum, quem sine peccato vixisse inter homines,
Prophetamque and plus quam Prophetam esse profitentur. Caecos enim illuminasse,
laeprosos mundasse, and mortuos prorsus suscitasse astruunt. Verum quoque
asserunt cum ad caelum ascendisse. Lex illorum, quam Diabolo dictante,

Saracenis dedit and docuit, a gladto caepit, per gladium tenetur, and in gladio
termenatur. Iste Mahometus illiteratus fuit, sicut ipse in Alchorano suo
testatur: qui quae praenominatus baereticus dictavit, ipse praedicavit. Et quia
potens erat, and Arabum Princeps, per comminationes suas legem statuit
observari. Luxuriosus autem fuit and bellicosus, and ideo de immunditia and
vanitate legem dedit, quam carnaliter viventes in partem voluptatis observant:
and sicut legem Christi veritas and munditia muniunt, ita errorem ipsorum timor

The Alcoran is given out for the Word of God; it is written in Arabic verse,
in form of a Dialogue between the Angel Gabriel and their Prophet, it is
prohibited to be translated, which both preserves the Arabic tongue and
conceals the Religion. Mr. Henry Blunt's Voyage into the Levant, p. 146.

The Alcoran is stuffed with obsceanness, lies, miracles, visions, moral and
natural Philosophy; such trash as may wonderfully provoke the silliest Student
to a height of laughter. It is in Volume twice so big as the Psalms of David,
divided into a hundred and fourteen Chapters. He denies Christ to be the Son of
God, and says, that the Virgin conceived by smelling to a Rose presented her
by Gabriel, and that he was born out of her breasts. Also that he was not
crucified, but Judas or some other wicked thief; Christ being separated from
them by a cloud that covered him, and came from heaven, Herb. Trav. l. 2. p.
273, and 254.

Brerewood in his Enquiries, Amongst other qualities whereby Mahometism
possesses the minds of men, one, is its pleasing doctrine. The Angel tells
their Prophet concerning Venery, and some such other delicacies of life, that
God did not give men such appetites to have them frustrate, but enjoyed. Mr
Henry Blunts Voyage into the Levant. p. 149. Quam long lateque se diffuderit
pestiferum illud virus haereseos Mohamedicae, historiae passim docent, and qui
Regiones Orientis peragrarunt testari facile possunt. Ubicunque vero Religio

legislator manifestis verbis sub paena capitis sancivit. Tantum autem Mohamedis

Christianis reliqua sit. Imo abultimis extremi occidentis oris, hoc est, ab
insulis Fortunatis ad Maluccarum usque insulas in extremo Orientis,

Mesopotamia, Chaldaea, Perfide, India, and insulis adjacentibus, Paelaestina,

Arab. Vide Laurent. Ludov Leobernensis Orat. 10, and 11. de Mahom. Increm.
cap. 11. gives four reasons of the spreading of Mahumetanism, whereof two are,

1. Their peremptory restraint (even on the pain of death) of all disputations
touching their Religion, and calling any point of it into question.

2. The sensual liberty allowed by it, viz. to have many wives, and the like
promise of sensual pleasures to succeed after this life (to the Religious
observers of it) in Paradise.

God was pleased to suffer a base Epileptick person, a villain and vicious, to
set up a Religion which has filled almost all Asia and Africa, and some parts
of Europe. Dr Tailors Rule of a Holy Dying, chapter 1. sect. 4.

The Janissaries (many of which were at first Christians) are the greatest
strength of the Turkish Empire, being first instituted by Amurath the first,
Janizari vel Jenizari praecipuum sunt Imperatoris Turcici robur: atque ex iis
etiam eliguntur Imperatoris ejusce custodes: ac quia aula Soltani porta
Osmonica nuncupatur eo ajanuae vocabulo Janizari putantur vocitari. Vossius de
vitiis Sermonis, l. 2. c. 10.
they are often dreadful unto the great Turk himself; after whose death they
have sometimes preferred to the Empire such of the Emperors sons as they
best liked, without respect of prerogative of age, contrary to the will of the
great Sultan himself. Some suppose they are not unlike in time to be the chief
cause of the ruin of that large Empire.

The Christians themselves in Turkey are Sed and regnum Turcicum Christianis
adeo soecundum esse constans sama est, ut si hominum numero certandum sit,
facile uni Muselmanno, quo nomine gaudent Turcae, sen Alcoranitae, tres opponi
posse Christianos; crudele autem barbarorum jugum ob certaminum, quae sovent,
varietatem, and contraria, in qua scinduntur, studia, mutnasque, quibus
laborant dissentiones excutere non posse. Joach. Vageti Period. Reg. Turc.
numerous.

When any of the Janissaries have committed ought worthy of death, the custom is
to send the same party in the night time over by Boat from Constantinople to
Pera; where by the way he is thrown into the water with a great stone about his
neck, and then there is a piece of Ordinance shot off, which is a token of some
such execution. The Turk is forced to take this course, lest the rest of his
Janissaries should mutiny when any of their fellows is put to death.

That complicate error of the Socinians sprung from Mahometism. Turpissimam
Socinistarum gentem e fimetis Muhammedanorum prosiltisse, hinc certum est, quod
non modo blasphemo ore conspirant cum Turcis in abneganda Jesu Christi divina

The abstinence and sobriety of many Turks will condemn intemperate Christians,
and their frequent prayers, the prophanness of diverse Christians. Scilicet

Before the Turks come to prayer, they prepare themselves thereunto by outward
washing of themselves in token of reverence, and suffer no women to come to
their Churches, left the sight of them should withdraw their minds from prayer.

CHAP. IV. The third false Religion is Judaism.
Purch. Pilgrim. l. 2. c. 11.
THey were after the Babylonian Captivity called Jews of the chief and royal
Tribe, and their Country Judea.

Before Christ's death the Gospel was revealed only to the Jews, a few Gentiles
were brought in, as Rahab, Joh, the people of Nineveh; after his resurrection
it was revealed to all Nations, Mark 16.16. The first Church that ever was
gathered, was of the Jews, Matthew. 15.24. Luke 24.47. Because 1. They were the
firstborn, and their Fathers were in Covenant with God, Genesis 17.7.2. Christ
came of them after the flesh, Romans 9.4, 5.

The Jews look for a Messiah to come in outward pomp, yet some of their
Rabbines say, In Regno Messiae nihil mundanum.

They detested the Publicanes of old as most vile sinners, but now they are the
only Publicans who serve under the Turk; no man will trust them now they are so
perfidious. See Deuteronomy. 32.26.

They are of more vile account in the sight of Turks then Christians; insomuch
that if a Jew would turn Turk, he must first turn Christian before they will
admit him to be a Turk, Biddulphs Travels.

They deride Christ with that reproachful and despitefull name Talui, which is
as much as hanged or crucified.

After their prayers, they utter an execrable curse against all Christians and
Baptized Jews. Judaei in suis Synagogis singulis diebus ter Christo maledicunt,
Hieron. in Esai l. 22. c. 49. Tom. 5. and l. 14. c. 42. diebus and noctibus
blasphemant Salvatorem, and sub nomine Nazaraeorum ter in die in Christianos
congerunt maledicta.


They are given much to Fables, Titus 1.14.

Nunquam tam been intellexi quae de Judaicis fabulis vitandis monet Paulus,
atque quum Talmud. gustavi. Wall. Epist. Walaeo Gomarus.

This is a sign that they are given up by God to a reprobate mind, as the Lord
threatens, Deuteronomy. 28.28.

They have been cast off 1600 Years, the curse they wished on themselves is
upon them till this day.

Polyd. Vergill. de Invent. Rerum, l. 8. c. 4. says, the people of the Jews,
though it embraced the same Law, was divided into diverse Sects, Nazarenes,
Pharisees, Essenes, Saducees, Samaritans, Herodians.

There are three principal Sects among the Jews, Pharisees, Sadducees, and
Essenes.

1. Pharisees.

They were the strictest Sect among the Jews, Act. 26. those that pretended
most of all to walk according to the rules of the Jewish Religion. Paul the
Apostle was a Pharisee.

See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evan. part tertia, Dub. 28. and Cameron on Matthew.
20. v. 3.

2. The Sadducees.

Antigonus Master to Sadoc the Father of the Sadducees, exhorted his Scholars
to embrace the Law, not looking for a reward, that is, for love of it self. De
eo quod dicuntur negasse spiritus, non disputo. Sane ut multi putant, sic
sequeretur eos negasse legem Mosaicam, quae variis in locis Angelorum mentionem
facit. Praeterea certum est eos non negasse librorum Propheticorum autoritatem,
ut ex Talmude liquet. Menasseh Ben Israel de Resurrectione, cap. 6. Vide Camer.
praelect. Tom. 3. in Matthew. 20. v. 3. p. 45.
Sadoc and the Sadducees after him taught that there was no reward after this
life, and therefore no resurrection. Dr Lightfoots 3d part of his Harmony,
Sect. 6.

It is noted of them, that of all other Sects, they were the most cruel in
their judicial censures, as Eusebius. Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 14. out of Josephus.
They denied the resurrection and last judgment; so as they were Atheists. This
made them dare to practice all cruelty and injustice: For Maxima peccandi
illecebra impunitatis spes.

See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evang. part tertia Dub. 29.

3. The Essenes.

From whom some fetch the original of Christian Monks.

There were also Scribes, Learned men, which professed the reading and
interpretation of the Law, either of the Sect of the Pharisees or Sadducees.

The Jews had so high an opinion of the Scribes and Pharisees, that they
thought if but two went to heaven, one must be a Scribe and the other a
Pharisee.

For Justification, They found no need of the righteousness of Christ, How
often does Christ thunder against the Scribes and Pharisees, Matthew. 15.6, 9,
12. Matthew. 23. several verses.
therefore Christ says he came not to call such righteous persons (in their
own conceit) but sinners. See Romans 10.3.

For Sanctification: All their righteousness came from self, that which may be
found in a natural man; they knew not what Regeneration or a new nature meant,
John 3.4.10. 2. Not the Law, but their interpretation of it was their rule,
Matthew. 5.27. 3. They pleaded their obedience before God, All these have I kept
from my youth.

The Rabbis have much from old Writers agreeable to the Apostles Doctrine, but
stained with dogged blasphemies, notwithstanding their readiness in the Text
and Records in pieces of ancient Truth must be regarded. As touching their
sayings, fighting for us against themselves, I think them profitable when they
are cited with skill, what they do mean or ought to mean, otherwise they will
trouble much men little acquainted with them. H. Broughton of Melchis.

Two things are most firmly to be held against the Jews. 1. That the promised
Messiah is come. 2. That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah.


The first is most certain from these Arguments.

1. Because the Messiah ought to come when the Scepter was taken from Judah,
Genesis 49. If the words of our Father Jacob be true, and there is no Scepter nor
Lawgiver now in the house of Judah, then must it needs be this man Jesus, whom
we confess and believe, is that Shilo which was to come. The Confession of
Faith made by Nathanael the Jew, Baptized by Mr. Fox.
10.

2. Because he was to come before the destroying of the second Temple, Hag.
2.8, 10. Mal. 3.1.

3. Because the place of the Nativity of the Messiah has been destroyed for
1500 years and more: That is, Bethlehem, Mic. 5.2.

4. Because the Oracles and Heathenish Idolatries, and also the Leviticall
Ceremonies have ceased, Zach. 13.2, 4. Dan. 9.26, 27.

The second also is most certain, That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah,
because all the Prophesies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah, agree
to him.

1. He was born when the Scepter departed from Judah, according to the
Prophecy of Jacob, Genesis 49. Locus hic est insignis, and vehementer urit
Judaeos. Quare vix alius est, quem tot and tam variis tamque inter se
discrepantibus glossis contaminaverint. Helv. System. Controv. Theol. quae
Christian. cum Judaeis intercedunt.
10.

2. He came while the second Temple stood, Hag. 2.8. Mal. 3.1.

3. He was born in Bethlehem, Mic. 5.2. Matthew. 2. Luke 2.

4. When he came the Oracles ceased, according to that Zach. 13.24. as it is
manifest from Plutarch, about the ceasing of Oracles, Juvenals 6th Satyr and
Ecclesiastical History.

5. He abrogated the Leviticall Ceremonies and Sacrifices, Dan. 9.26, 27. Jer.
3.16.

Aben-Ezra upon Isa. 52.13. confesses that the Jewish Rabbis affirm, that
those things are spoken of the Messiah. So also does Abrabaneel upon the place:
and the Chaldee Paraphrast there for (...) My servant, has (...) My servant
Messiah.

The Conversion of the Jews is called by Paul a mystery, it is uncertain when
it shall be.

Marsilius Ficinus in his book de Relig. Christian. c. 37. gives these reasons
why the Jews do not yet embrace the Christian faith, Propheticorum
Christianorumque mysteriorum divina profunditos; and quia divina, ideo humana
intelligentia non penetrabilis Rursus ingenium mercenariorum miserabiliumque
Judaeorum incultum prorsus and pertinax. Avaritia tum ejus, quod suum est
servandi, tum faciendi saenoris inexplebilis. Naturalis suorum amor inuatum
odium Christianorum.
There are diverse hindrances of their Conversion. 1. The great differences
among Christians. 2. Their slighting and undervaluing of Gospel Ministry and
Ordinances, the multitude of Heresies and Blasphemies. 3. Their loose lives,
swearing, cursing, Sabbath-breaking. 4. The great Idolatry of the Church of
Rome, artolatria and iconolatria: The Jews hate Image Worship. 5. The severe
carriage of Christians in civil commerce with them.


Helps to their Conversion. 1. Unity. 2. Holiness of life and conversation. 3.
The love of the Gospel, and propagation of it to dark places. 4. Knowledge and
skill in the Old Testament, and Rabbis. 5. Earnest prayer. When we were out of
Covenant they prayed for us, Cant. 8.8. Nihil (mihi credit) ad Judaeorum
impudentiam confutandam reperitur adeo validam, nihilque ad little convincendam
nequitiam tam efficax invenitur, ut est Hebraicae linguae and traeditionum
suarum cognitio. Wakesieldi. Orat. de laud and utilitate trium Linguarum,
Arab. Chald. and Hebr.



By those arguments, Joh. 5.30. Act. 17.2. and 18.28. Romans 16.26. many Jews
have been overcome. Johannes Isaac a Jew was converted by reading Isa. 53. And
conferring with five Rabbis at Frankefort, out of that Chapter he brought them
to such straits, that they could not answer. Isaac contra Lindanum l. 2.
defens. Heb. verit.

Lyra, Immanuell Tremellius, Paulus Ricius, Lud. Carretus, were converted Jews.

Mr Fox preached a Sermon at the Baptism of a Jew.

We protest and proclaim that we have very little hope of their salvation, who
either out of negligence of seeking the truth, or unwillingness to find it,
live and die in the impieties of that Church. Chillingworth chapter 3. Sect. 63.

Sr Edwin Sands in his Europae speculum, or Relation of Religion of the Western
parts of the World, discovers fully the superstitions and gross corruptions of
the Church of Rome.

He shows how their State is strangely compacted of infinite contrarieties.

What pomp, what riot to that of their Cardinals? What severity of life
comparable to their Hermites and Capuchins? Who wealthier then their Prelates?
Who poorer by vow and profession then their Mendicants? On the one side of the
street a Cloister of Virgins: On the other a Sty of Courtezans, with public
toleration: This day all in masks with all looseness and foolery; to morrow all
in Processions, whipping themselves till the blood follow. On one door an
Excommunication, throwing to hell all transgressors; on another, a Jubilee or
full discharge from all transgressions. He says this is a Proverb recorded in
their own books, That the worst Christians of Italy are the Romans, of the
Romans the Priests are wickedest, the lewdest Priests are preferred to be
Cardinals, and the baddest man among the Cardinals is chosen to be Pope.

There is a twofold separation.

One condemned, Jude v. 19. when men separate from a Church where salvation is
to be had: Christ did not separate from the communion of the Jewish Church,
John 4.21, 22. but from the corruptions of it. He frees the Law from the false
glosses of the Pharisees, the 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters of Matthew, he would
not join with them in their superstitious purifications. They kept the
Passover a day after its time, he kept it a day before they kept it, Matthew.
26.27.

2. Another commended and Palam est nostram a nobis Ecclesiam reformatam esse

approved, Rev. 16.3. and 18.4. Salvation was no longer to be had in Rome,
their worship was grossly corrupt, in such cases not only a mental but
external separation was requisite. See Camer. Popish Prejud. Examined and

wrote an excellent Tract De Reformatione Ecclesia, and offered it to the
Council of ^onstance. The first consideration is, how to reform the body of
the Church, for that, let often General Councels be celebrated and other
directions he gives. 2. To reform the Head, that is, the State of the Pope, and
the Court of Rome and shows means for that. 3. To reform the principal parts
of the Church, viz. the Prelates, and gives directi^ns for that. 4. To reform
about Religion and religious persons, and he prescribes rules for that. 5. To
reform the other Ecclesiastical persons. 6. To reform the Christian
Lay People. Vide Wolfii Lect. Memorab. Centen. 15.
Gerhard. in his Confess. Cathol. l. 1. General. part. 1. c. 4. shows, that
many before Luthers time confessed that the Doctrine of the Church of Rome was
corrupt and needed Reformation, and some that were his contemporaries, and also
after him, did the like.

One says the Papists Liturgies are full of Idolatry and blasphemies, their
Legends full of lies, their Ceremonies of superstition.

Cardinal Mattheo Langi, Archbishop of Salzburg, told every one, that the
reformation of the Mass was honest, the liberty of meats convenient, and the
demand just to be disburthened of so many Commandments of men, but that a poor
Monk should reform all, was not to be endured. And Cornelius Scoperus the
Emperors Secretary, said, that if the Protestant Preachers had money, they
would easily buy of the Italians what Religion pleased them best, but without
gold it was impossible to make theirs shine in the world. Hist. of the Counc.
of Trent, l. 1. page 55.

The Pope in the beginning of the Council of Trent, being desired to make a
Reformation to please the Lutherans, No says he, it is in vain, a whole
Reformation will undo the Church, and a halt Reformation will not gratify the
Lutherans, therefore it is better to imbitter both the parties.

In the vacancies of the Sea of Rome the Cardinals use to compose certain
capitulations to reform the Papal Government, which all swear to perform, if
they shall be assumed to the Popedom, though it appear by all precedent
examples, that every one swears with a mind not to keep them in case he
shall be Pope. For so soon as he is elected, he says he could not bind
himself, and that he is at liberty by gaining the Papacy. History of the
Council of Trent, l. 1. p. 71.

the third, to consider of the State of the Church, made report that there were
many corruptions in it, (31 abuses) especially in the manners of Bishops and
Clergymen. That the Bishops were idle; did not instruct the people, nor feed
the Flock, nor look to the Lords Vineyard: that they lived in Princes Courts,
and kept not home. That the Cardinals had sometimes three, sometimes four
Bishops in Commendam, not without great prejudice to the Church, for that those
Offices are not compatible, or to be held together. That the Covents ought to
be clean banished out of the Church. B. Jewels Epistle concerning the Council
of Trent.

In the midst of Popery God had his people, Semper fuerunt in Germania qui
(...) Papatus and agnoverunt and taxarunt. Multi primatum Pontificis,
clerifastum, avaritiam ac libidines detestati sunt: multi idolum missae
oppugnarunt. Multi and recte and pie de gratuita hominis peccatoris coram Deo

docuerunt: multi reformationem unice in votis habuerunt. Melchior. Adam. in
Vita Gobelini.
which holding the foundation rejected their errors, and out of Babylonish
darkness he brought many to the sight of the truth, as Waldo, Wickliff, Luther,
Zuinglius.

God stirred up in several ages some public and constant Confessors of the
Faith, which publicly set themselves against Popery, some of which resisting
it even unto blood, had the Crown of Martyrdom. Those Confessors may be
distributed into three Classes or ranks. The first comprehends the whole
Churches, the Waldenses and the Greek Church. The other comprehends the
Emperors and Kings which opposed themselves to the Papal Tyranny. The third
the Doctors and Martyrs, which taxed the errors and abuses brought into the
Church.

Bellarmine, Bozius, Cocceius, Costerus and others, have written many things of
the Marks or Signs of a Church: Costerus reckons three, Cocceius five,
Bellarmine fifteen, Bozius a hundred: Some assign more, some fewer Marks, but
all greatly glory of the holiness of the Roman Church, as a special and
infallible note: If the question be of the Roman Church, they answer, It is
One, Holy, Catholicall, Apostolical: If of the Papal Sea, The Holy,
Apostolical Sea: If of the Pope of Rome, The most Holy Father: If they speak
to him, Your Holiness: Oh quam sancta omnia?

But whether we understand of holiness of Doctrine, or holiness of Life, how
little holiness is to be found amongst them?

What holiness of Doctrine is there in that Tenet, to hold that Priests may not
marry. See Heb. 13.4.

What holiness of life there is amongst them, their Stews, and their dissolute
courses show.

The nine choice persons elected by Paul the third, to reform their Church,
complain of the Stews In hac etiam urbe meretrices ut matronae incedunt per

How dissolute and prodigiously wicked many of the Popes have been, They teach,

the Popish Writers themselves mention.

How unclean and Sodomiticall many of their Cardinals were, we have evident
Testimony. See the Scarlet Gown, or the History of all the present Cardinals at
Rome.

How desperate the life and death of many Jesuits has been, John Casa
Archbishop of Beneventum, the Popes Legate at Venice, wrote in the commendation
of a most abominable filthiness, and set forth with wicked eloquence that sin
which ought not to be named scarce among Christians. Tantae sunt puritatis and
castitatis, ut in templo etiam publico Jesuita non aufit, fibi suaeve carni

and their Relics also. To worship the supposed Relic of a supposed Saint.

Calvin an eyewitness, testifies, that when Genevah received the Doctrine of
the Gospel, the Relics were visited by the authority of the Magistrate, and
it was found that what they had adored till then, as if it had been the brain
of Peter, was a Pumice stone; and what they had believed to be St Anthony's
arm, was the sinew of a Heart or Stag.

The parts and parcels of wood kept in Europe, which they say are parts of the
Cross whereon Christ died, are so many, that if they were all gathered

the Papists weaken the Divine Majesty and authority of the Scriptures twelve
ways, besides the several reproaches cast upon it by diverse of them, which he
there also mentions.

Petrus Fragius Doctor of Divinity made an Oration to the Fathers of the
Council of Trent to assert the authority of the Pope of Rome: He told them God
had prayed for Peter, who being after converted, confirmed his brethren in the
faith. Si igitur (said he) Dominus pro Petro precatus est, cur jam pro Julio
non precabitur. What is Christ more weak or cruel now then he was? and is
Julius inferior in dignity and office to Peter himself? Minime vero vel ipsis

faith by Julius? But do not thou see a remedy prepared, viz. an Oecumenicall

How the Papists transgress against both Law and Gospel, breaking every
Commandment, and violating every article of the Creed, and both the Sacraments.

The Papists have used both violent and fraudulent means to propagate their
Religion.

1. Violent, as the Spanish Inquisition, the Irish Immanity, the Gunpowder plot
in England show. They teach that heretics are to be extirpated with fire and
sword.

Thuanus Hist. tom. 5. part secunda p. 135. fully relates the Gunpowder
Treason, and begins thus, Nunc horrendam and ab omnibus aeque damnatam
conjurationem contra magnae Britanniae Regem vitam continua narratione
exequemur.

They use fraudulent means, they make use of spurious writings, defend
equivocation, they shelter themselves with false Miracles, Legends, Relics.
They have many fabulous books.


That Massacre of Paris was very cruel, but ushered in with pretenses of great
love and friendship, The conformities of St Francis, the Legends of Saints, the
Popes Decretals.


There are three maxims (says Peter du Moulin) which are the pillars of Popery.

The first of which is, That the Church of Rome cannot err.

The second, That the Pope and the Church of Rome are not subject to the holy
Scripture, but have more Authority then it. Anatomy De La mess Par Pierre Du
Moulin. l. 1. c. 9.


The third, That the Pope and Church of Rome have power to change the
Commandments of God, and to make new Articles of Faith.

Dr Preston (as I remember) reduces all to these two heads: 1. That the true
Church cannot err. 2. That the Church of Rome is that true Church.


Peter du Moulin in his Anatomy De La mess l. 4. Chap. 5. shows when England
received the Orders of Rome, Chap. 7. when Popery was brought into France, and
Chap. 8. when it was brought into Spain.

What opinion was there heretofore of Monkery?

What esteem have the Papists of it still? Ita enim tune hominibus persuasum
erat: Monachatum aequipollere Baptismo: esse statum perfectionis: statuta and
regulas Monasticas verbo Dei multis parasangis ante ire: habitum Monasticum
sanctitate praestare aliis vestibus: Et qui in cucullo sepeliatur, cum
remissionem tertiae partis peccatorum suorum consequi: ac hujusmodi sexcenta
alia. Melch. Adam. in vita Fridmyconii.
This is one of the Prerogatives of the Order of St Francis and St Dominick,
that the habit of St Francis or St Dominick is worthy a second Baptism, and
that by this habit all the former sins are blotted out. Whence it came, that
many Princes and Persons of quality in mortal diseases, have put on the habit
of St Francis, that they might blot out all their sins.

Learned Rudolphus Agricola dying at Heidelberg was buried in a Franciscans
habit by the Minorites, as he commanded.

Campians brag in his third reason, Ad Patres si quando licebit accedere;
confectum est praelium, tam sunt nostri, quam Gregorius ipse Decimus tertius,
filiorum Ecclesiae Pater amantissimus, is succinctly and pithily answered by
our learned Whitaker, Quem nos filiorum Ecclesiae hostem capitalem and furiosum
esse novimus, eum tu Patrem vocas amantissimum, and quam hoc verum est, tam
illud esse verum concludis. Fateor ambo, quam illud, utrumque enim falsissimum.

Gerhard in his Catholic Confession, lib. 1. General. part. 1. cap. 4. says,
That Luther in his work of Reformation, Non fuisse novi alicujus dogmatis
inventorem, sedantiquae fidei assertorem; nec fuisse novae Ecclesiae autorem,
sed pristinae repurgatorem. Junius noster dicere solebat, Papistas ita in
fundamentis errare, ut a fundamentis non aberrarent, cui ego plane assentio.
Walaei Epistolae Antonio Walaeo Hugo Grotio.

Gerhard in his first General Book of his Catholic Confession, chap. 6. speaks
of Luther the instrument of Reformation, and chap. 7. of the occasion of
Reformation, the immoderate extolling of the Popes indulgences, and the
excessive gain of those that vented them.

The Prophet Zachary says, The man whose name is the Branch, he shall build
the Temple of the Lord: Because, 1. The Temple is Christ's house, Matthew. 16.18.
Heb. 3.6. 2. Christ has undertaken this work.

Id eo magis commemorabile est, quod Zuinglius, and Lutherus, and Calvinus qui
sucru^t in Reformatione principes, confilia inter se non communcearunt.
Zuinglius enim viam ad Reformationem in Helvetia affectaverat anno integro ante
qua^ Lutherus in Germania appareret. At conatus illius fama ad Lutherum non
manaverat, and quum primum adversus Indulgentias praedicare incoepit, quid
rerum istarum Tiguri gereretur penitas ignorabat. Calvinus utroque paulo
junior, and exortus cum utriusque fama jam in Europa percrebuerat, non potuit
quin de alterutro, vel de utroque aliquid inaudisset, antequam Pontificis

and dic Domine miserere mei. Wolf. Lect memorab. Tom. 10. Cent. 115.
This appears in the work of Reformation, because they which were the chief
Reformers did not communicate their counsels to one another; and likewise if we
consider the instruments, by Luther a Monk, and other mean men in Germany, and
by Edward the 6th a child in England, and by a woman Q. Elizabeth, that such a
glorious work should be effected.

Also if we observe how our cause from the beginning against the will of
Emperors, and m^^y Kings, maugre the malice of Popes, has taken increase, and
by little and little ^pread into all Countries.

The Church of Rome was so unsound in Doctrine, and corrupt in worship, that it
was no schism but a duty then to separate from it.

The means taken by the first Reformers for promoting the work of Reformation
of Religion.

1. They searched diligently into the Word of God, They are fitly therefore
called Evangelici, from their great respect to the Gospel, and the whole
Scripture.
and so discovered the errors of Popery. Their care was after to translate the
Bible into vulgar languages, and to interpret it to the people, and illustrate
it with ample Comments.

2. They were careful to educate children in the Principles of Christian
Religion and Piety. It is a piece of Luthers counsel, if ever you would have a
good Reformation look to the Reformation of children.

3. They were ready to dispute with their Adversaries in all places, and
speedily to reply to their writings.

Respons.

Chamier has answered the Papists generally in his learned Panstratia
Catholica.

Bellarmine is well answered by Junius, Ames, Whitaker.

The Rhemist Testament and the Notes are well confuted by Cartwright and Fulk.

Casaubone has written learned Exercitations against Baronius.

Bishop Morton, Doctor Fulk and Whitaker have answered the Treatises of several
Papists.

Rivet and Blondel and Moulin have answered Cardinal Peroon.

Bishop Usher, Bishop Andrews, Bishop Ab^^^ Doctor Prideaux, and others of our
Divines, have stou^ly opposed other Papists.

The Reformed Religion is well defended by the English and French Divines. Some
much commend three Epistles, that Epistle or Preface of Calvin's to his
Institutions: That of Casaubons to his Exercitations against Baronsus; and that
of Thuanus or Guicchardine before his History. That of Calvin's is a succinct
and pithy Apology for the Protestant Religion.

Juels Apology was generally liked by the Reformed Churches.

Daille, Croyus, Blondel, Jacobus Capellus, Amyrot, and Gentilettus, have
written in French or Latin in Defense of the Reformed Religion.

4. They diligently compiled the Histories of those times and actions, and
especially Martyrologies of such as rendered by their deaths a testimony to that
truth which was persecuted in them. Quod vero veterum doctrinam ita extollis,
ut nostri temporis homines, neque pietate, neque eruditione cum ipsorum minimo
conferendos esse censeas, id minime ferendum est. Nam quamvis nostra tenuitatis
conscii, id de nobis merito possimus ac debcamus fateri, de multis tamen id,
sine magna in Deum ingratitudine, and in homines injustitia dici non potest.
Quamvis enim Patres antiqui sua habuerint ad eruditionem subsidia, duobus tamen
maxim necessariis ad solidiorem sacrarum literarum notitiam comparandam
adjumentis, librorum copia and liuguarum doctoribus, caruerunt. Nam primum quum
Cyprianus, Hieronymus, Augustinus ad scribendum accederent, pauca de Christiana
Religione quibus uterentur, extabant, and ^b descriptionis difficultatem rara
and cara erant exemplaria: Nostrum vero seculum eo felicius est, quod plurima
etiam ab illis Patribus caeterisque paulatim sint conscripta, and typographiae
(olim ignotae) beneficio, magna copia and tolerabili pretio comparentur: Adco
ut quae longo tempore and maximo labor a veteribus indagata sunt, ea cito ac
facile ex scriptis eorum possint addisci. Deinde vero quam pauci ex Latinis
Patribus ullam Graecas lingua notitiam habuerunt, quam rari ex omnibus Patribus
Hebraeae Linguae fuerunt pariti? quam pauca (ob librorum and fidelium
praeceptorum inopiam) ad eam rem habuerunt auxilia, ex variis S. Hieronymis
testimoniis apparet. Atque hinc factum est, ut a genuina Spiritus sancti
sententia longius, praesertim in Veteri Testamento, laepius aberrarint. Nostris
vero temporibus, Hebraei Graecique codices sunt in numeri and linguarum periti
professores non pauci quorum beneficio ita sacrae literae illustratae sunt, ut
quam plurima, quae Patrum memoria erant obscura, luce clarius videantur.

As we ought highly to reverence the Fathers for their Antiquity, so in our
times we owe much respect to many famous Writers, because by their most learned
Labors they have given great light to the right understanding of the holy
Scripture. We have the same instruments which they had, viz. the holy
Scriptures, and far greater help.

Zuinglius, Luther, Calvin, all those learned men are to be loved and highly
honored, as those that have well deserved of the Church; their Books are also
to be diligently read, and to be preferred before the Volumes of many of the
Fathers, as those which have more truly interpreted the mind of the holy Ghost
then the Fathers, which have illustrated the Christian Doctrine brought out of
darkness with wonderful perspicuity, have comprised it with wonderful
brevity, and explained it in an excellent method. Zanch. Prolegom. in Esaiam.

Upon the view of the Doctrine of the Church of England, compiled by them in

and sent abroad into the whole Christian world, it was said abroad, Puritas

For the first ten years of Queen Elizabeth, most of the Papists of England came
to our Churches, prayed our prayers, heard our Sermons, and received our
Sacraments, until by the instigation of the Jesuits, Pope Pius Quintus
excommunicated Queen Elizabeth, and enjoined all the Papists not to resort to
our Churches. So they did in Ireland till 88, some Spanish Priests then landing
there, told them, it was condemned in the Council of Trent.

This is that Religion which (since the first Reformation of it, Anno 1. Edw.
6.) above one and twenty several Sessions of Parliament, as learned, as wise,
as religious as ever were in this Kingdom, The General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland approves the Assemblies Confession of faith for orthodox.
have allowed and approved.

Mr Baxter in his Confession of Faith, Sect 41. says thus of the late Assembly
of Divines at Westminster; I so highly reverence that Assembly, that I think
this Nation since the Apostles days, had never any that excelled it for Piety
and Ability: and Sect. 3. he much magnifies both the Confession of Faith, and
the Shorter Catechism put out by the Assembly. I truly profess (says he,
Sect. 5.) I take the Labors of the Assembly, especially these three Pieces
(the Confession of Faith, the larger and lesser Catechism) for the best Books,
next my Bible, in my study.

What Kingdom in Europe is there which has not yielded eminent Scholars, and
famous Martyrs of the Reformed Religion.

France had Calvin, Farel, Viret, Sadeel, Daneus, Marlorate, Beza, Mornee,
Chamier, Rivet, Peter du Moulin, Daille, and many others.

Italy brought forth and cast out (because it was unworthy of them) Peter
Martyr, Vide Pezel. Mellef. Histor. par. 3. page 438, 439, 440. de progressu

Zanchy, also Immanuel Tremelius, and Deodate.

Spain had John Diaz, Austen Cacalla, and also other Martyrs.

Germany had Luther, Melancthon, Joachim Camerarius and Chemnitius, Zuinglius,
Oecolampadius, Martin Bucer, Wolfangus Capito, Caspar Hedio, Musculus,
Hyperius, Foster, Avenarius, Mollerus, Pezelius.

Helvetia had Bullinger, Gualter, Pellicane, Leo Judae, Aretius, Wolfius,
Simler, Bibliander, Stuckius.

England was fruitful of Martyrs and great Scholars, Barns, Rogers, Cranmer,
Latimer, Ridlie, Hooper, Philpot, Haux, Bradford, Juel, Rainolds, Whitaker,
Fulk, Perkins, Morton, Davenant, Twisse, Prideaux, and diverse others.

Denmark brought forth Palladius, Hemmingius, and many others.

eum Polonia brevi illuminabitur: quod and paulo post per lucem Evangelii factum
fuit. Miesco enim coecus mortuo patre baptizatus, and Christianus factus, ad
veram Dei agnitionem pervenit, and idola omnia e Templis ejecit. Hic Rex pius

Polonia brought forth Johannes a Lasco. Servavit te huc usque Deus, ut sicut
Lutherus suae Germanias, Zuinglius suae Helvetiae, Calvinus suae Galliae, ita
tu tuae Poloniae sis Apostolus. Zanch. Epist. l. 2. ad illum.

Scotland was made famous by the Martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton, and by the
Doctrine of John Knox, and Robert Rollock, Andrew Melvin, Cameron, Baronius,
Forbes.

This may suffice to answer that calumny of the Jesuits, as if the Protestants
had no Scholars amongst them.

The Papists call us Heretics: This was ever an old and cunning trick of
Papists, and their forefathers, if any did complain of their errors and
faults, and desired to have true Religion restored, to condemn such for
Heretics, as men newfangled and factious. Bellarmin. lib. 4. de notis Eccl.
cap. 4.


They reproachfully nickname us Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calvinists, whereas we
maintain not any private or proper Doctrine of theirs. They called us in
England heretofore Lollards, either because they cried Lord, Lord unto their
God, Nos inter haereticos reponit, and dicit nos vocari Martinistas,
Lutheranos, Zuinglianos, Calvinianos. Nos autem, inquit, ab aliquo certo homine
nemo unquam vocavit. Notoriam injuriam nobis facit. Scit Lutherum quosvis

as Mr Fox says in his Acts and Monuments, or rather from Lolium, which
signifies Cockle, and such like weeds, whereas indeed they endeavored to
extirpate all pernicious weed: And them in France Huguenots, of which term, see
Thuanus his History, Tom. 4. lib. 24. and Pasquiers Recherches de la France. l.
8. c. 55.

I will not rehearse the several opinions about the original of that word,
because Heraldus a learned Frenchman says, Vnde Huguenoti appellati fuerint,
nec nos adhuc satis liquido scimus. Animad ad Arnob. adversus Gentes, l. 1. As
the Jews were in times past called by the Gentiles Sabbatarians in contempt;
the Christians Galileans by Julian the Apostata, so now they which embrace
truth of Doctrine, began to be called Huguenots.

They term us those of the pretended Reformed Religion, whereas it is truly
Reformed according to the word of God.

They acknowledge themselves to be Papists, and from the Pope, and glory in the
title.

Luther says, Primum oro ut nomen meum taceatur, and nemo Lutheranus sed
Christianus appelletur.

They suffer Turks and Jews which deny and persecute Christ, but put to death
those of the Reformed Religion who believe in Christ.

They say, that the Heathens (which had no knowledge of Christ) by their
morality may be saved, and yet deny that Protestants, who have a knowledge of
Christ, and exceed them in their morality, may be saved.

Marcus Antonius de Dominis Archbishop of Spalato said in the hearing of some
of our Bishops, Before God, and Christ Jesus my Redeemer, I will acknowledge
from my heart, and profess openly, That the Church of England is a true and
orthodoxal Church of Christ. His shiftings in Religion.

The Papists urge two things much against the Reformed Religion:

1. Our divisions and differences amongst our selves, as Fitz Simons in his
Britannomachia ministrorum, in plerisque Fidei fundamentis, and Articulis
dissidentium.

Secondly, The Novelty of our Religion, as if it were no ancienter then Luther.

To the first, I might answer with Zanchy Epist. lib. 1. ad Dudith. Ausim
equidem affirmare nullam essetantam inter Evangelicos in Doctrina de gratia and
pradestinatione dissensionem quam esscimer Jesuitas and Prado. terminantes,
quorum nunc Jansenius Antesignanas esse videtur.

Amyrald. de Successione ab Eccles. Romans page 41. Mo^ dissidium aliud inter

enim Tiguri substantialem corporis Christi in coena Domini praesentiam negavit;
quam Brentius cum Luthero and aliis adservit. Duravit id certamen magno cum
scandalo doctrinae annis aliquot: Ac nescio, an ulla res alia, magis causae
obfuerit, cursumque doctrinae calestis impedierit, quam odiosum hoc a Satana
excitatum bellum Sacramentarium: quod omnes pii doluerunt plurimum, and tollere
atque componere studuerunt. Melch. Adam. in vita Brentii.


, That this is rather an Argument that we are the true Churches of Christ. For
there are (says he) three kinds of Churches,

1. Where God only reigns without contradiction: This is the Triumphant Church
in Heaven.

2. Where Satan only reigns: This is the Church of the wicked and Idolaters,
such are the Turkish, Jewish, Popish Churches.

3. Where God truly reigns, but not without the snares and assaults of Satan.
This is the true Church of Christ, which is called Militant. This always
fights with the flesh, the world, Heretics, and the Devil.

The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been
long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countries, States and
Kingdoms, where these Churches are, are now of late very profitably published,
to the conviction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably
distracted and rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith. Travers
answer to a Popish Treatise written to the LL. of the Council.

Amyraldus de Secessione ab Ecclesia Romana, page 67. says, The chief
controversies inter Evangelicos, may be reduced to four heads, 1. Concerning
the Nature of the Sacraments. Lavater has written an History, De ortu and
progressu controversiae Sacramentariae. See also his 3d Decad of Ep. epist. 6.
he says in that Epistle, There is not one point in all Divinity (except those
wherein we accord with them) wherein they all speak the same.
2. About the Person of Christ, and the Properies of both Natures in it. 3. How
the Doctrine of Predestination is to be explained. 4. What is to be held
concerning the Providence of God, especially as it is conversant about the ill
actions of the reasonable creature, and shows there also how far yet they agree
in all these.


Dr Hall in his Peace of Rome, shows, That Bellarmine acknowledges and numbers
up above three hundred differences of opinions maintained in the Popish Church,
and that Navarre confesses near threescore differences amongst their own
Doctors in one only point of their Religion.

There are many Sects risen since the Gospel was first published, but none are
so guilty of division as the Papists, though they extol their own Church for
Unity. They unchurch all the Churches of Christ through the world besides
themselves, the Greek Church and diverse others. What a State were all former
ages in before the Popes Supremacy was acknowledged? The pure and primitive
times. The reading of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is condemned amongst
them as a capital crime in Spain and Italy, but allowed in England and France.

Albertus Pighius dissents from Cajetane, Thomas from Lombard, Scotus from
Thomas, Occam from Scotus, Alliacensis from Occam. Their nominals disagree from
their reals.

original sin in the blessed Virgin. Cardinalis Cameracensis, Gerson, Almain,

What difference among the Jesuits and other Papists, concerning Councels
being above the Pope. The Jesuits hold, that the Pope is above a Council.
Bellarmine confesses lib. 2. de Council. cap. 17. parag. 1. that Proposition,
That the Pope is absolutely above a Council, is not simply de fide, and those
are not Heretics properly who hold the contrary.

The Pope in two Councels (those of Constance and Basil) was declared to be
inferior to a Council.

Ubi suerit Ecclesia ante Lutherum? in qua orbis regione vel angulo latuerit.
2. For the other Objection, of the Novelty of our Religion, as if it were no
ancienter then Luther.

I answer, there are books Lennards Luthers Forerunners. Birbecks Protestants
Evidence.

Moulin in his Anatomy De la mess. l. 1. chapter 22. and 23. speaks sufficiently to
this Objection.


written to refute this calumny.

The Waldenses for diverse hundred years before Luther successively opposed
Popery, professed the truth of the Gospel, and sealed it with their blood.

Campian in his third reason calls them Majores nostros. Vide Gerhard. Epist.
Ded. ad Confess. Cathol.

Illyricus in his Catalogus Testium veritatis, and Wolfius in his Lectiones
Memorabiles, and Reconditae. And Gerhard in his Confessio Catholica
sufficiently refute this Objection.

Errors often lie hid under the venerable Cloak of ancient custom, Matthew.
5.21, 27, 31, 33, 38, 43. But on the contrary sound and orthodox Doctrine is
undeservedly taxed with the crime of novelty, Mark 1.27. Act. 17.19. therefore
judgment is to be made of both by Scripture, Act 17.11.

Secondly, We may retort this Question on them, Where was your Religion before
the Council of Trent?

Cardinal Contarenus holding the same with us for substance in point of
Justification, and many of those learned and modest men which are reckoned for
Papists, groaning under the corruptions of their Church, and desiring a
Reformation of many abuses as well as we.

Bishop Jewels challenge of the Papists is commonly known, Nous sommes prests
de sabir toute sort de punitions, si en cinq cens ans apres Jesus Christ, and
(pourrious descendre plusbas) il se trouve un seul homme qui ait en une
Religion tant soit peu approchante de la Religion Roman tell qu' elle est
auiourhui. Anatomy de la Mess par Pierre du Moulin. l. 1. chapter 22.
with which Peter du Moulin also accords.

There is rather a conspiracy amongst the Papists then true union: as on the
contrary, the difference amongst us is rather a diversity then a division, in
circumstances or things of less moment, and among persons rather then
generally.

We are reproached beyond Sea for our unsettlement in matters of Religion, and
for the diversity of opinions and sects now in the Land.

Some amongst our selves also will be ready to object, That there are so many
religions and opinions, that they know not which course to take.

1. Such should therefore take the Scripture only for the rule of their faith
and life.

2. They should study faithfully to know the plain meaning of the Scripture,
they should read it diligently, seek Gods direction, come to it not with
forestalled conceits, but with love of the truth.

3. They should resolve to obey what they shall find upon such diligent
inquiry to be the plain mind of God beyond dispute. They should practice what
all Christian Sects agree in, they all confess that God is above the creature,
and to be preferred before it, that the pleasures and profits of this world are
far short of the glory to come.

CHAP. VII. Of the Syncretisme of Religion, or of a friendly Reconciliation of
the different parties amongst themselves. I met with this Question in the
Archbishop of Canterburies Manuscript. Catalogue.

An hoc tempore gliscentis vel potius grassantis tyrannidis Pontificiae
Syncretismus and coitio fieri inter Ecclesias Evangelicas de Coena Domini
dissidentes adversus communem hostem debeat. Disputatio 4to. Vidae Hottonis De
Christiana Tolerantia, Tract. Sect. 3. cap. 3.



THey are Christians which profess Christian Religion, therefore those which
either know not Christ, as the Pagans, or deny him to be the Savior of the
world, as the Mahometans, or that contemn and blaspheme him, as the Jews, are
excluded.

There are several opinions about this matter:

The first is, of those who hold, That whosoever they be who differ about
Religion so they be Christians, they may and ought to be reconciled and agree
together in an Ecclesiastical Syncretism, so the Socinians, Libertines,
Politicians, Machivillians.

The second opinion is of those which denies that Christians differing in
Religion can or ought to be so reconciled. So the Papists, especially the
Jesuits, think and teach, requiring a full consent with the Church of Rome, as
that which cannot err, and out of which there is no salvation, and cannot, nor
will not bear these which differ. Hence it is a common speech amongst them,
there is no other way to agreement, then by the receiving and approving of the
Council of Trent.

Many of those which profess to follow Luther, are of that opinion also,
refusing to join with those which they reproachfully call Calvinists, unless
they will receive the Augustane Confession, as it is wont to be explained by
them, and the book of Concord.

Calvin in his Epistles speaks of his crossing the Seas willingly, to reconcile
the differences between the Reformed Churches: And King James sent to Peter du
Moulin to come over hither into England to confer with him about the method
that it was fit to take for the reunion of all the Reformed Churches in
Christendom, so often solicited by Mounsieur du Plessis, See La Vie du M. du
Plessis, lib. 3. page 403, 404. and his Memoires. Others also have labored
this way. Quid? Nonne vident dissidia nostra esse amicorum dispendia, hostium
compenaia (ut cum Hieronymo dicam) and publica irae divinae incendia. Junii
praefat. ad Irenicum.
The third opinion is of them who go the middle way between these extremes, and
affirm, That there may be an agreement among those that differ in some
Controversies, but not in others, These are the Orthodox Teachers of the
Reformed Churches.

A universal conjunction is impossible, the rule of consent about Religion is
only the word of God.

The enemies of Christian Religion are twofold, Open or Close:

Those openly oppose the Doctrine of Christ, and persecute his Church, viz. the
Heathens, Mahometans and Jews; these treacherously and under the name of
Christ, as Heretics, but especially Arminians, Pelagians, and Papists.

Altingius and others hold an agreement with both these unlawful.

1 King. 13.21.
To endeavor to soder different Religions and persons holding to their
principles will make up but a medly and patcht Religion.

As some in the Apostles time mingled Circumcision with Baptism, and the
Sacrifices with the death of Christ. This was the way which the great Emperor
Charles the fifth took to reunite the two Religions in Germany, by the Tract
called the Interim, which was composed by an Apostate Minister named Islebius.
But it was opposed by the faithful Ministers, and although out of fear it was
admitted by some Princes and Commonwealths, yet it was soon abolisht. Circa
idem tempus, monstrosus partus and toti Germaniae pestilens in lucem infelici
sidere prodiit, quem Interim seu inter Religionem Augustanam, nominarunt, cum
edicto Caesaris: quo promulgata est certa quaedam Religionis formula, interim

Castam Christi Sponsam decet casta concordia (said Doctor Sibbes in a Clerum)
in Doctrine as well as Worship. Malefida semper fuit Religionum ferruminatio
and publicis calamitatibus praevia, said the same Reverend Divine in that
Latin Sermon.

The Samaritans (with their patcht Religion) retarded Christ's work.

Some distinguish between Consent, and Concord, others make a difference
between Consent, Differunt Consensio and Concordia: Haec enim Charitate, Pace,
and sacrorum Communione constat: illa opinionum Consonantia. Perfecta
Theologorum aut Ecclesiarum in omnibus Consensio optanda potius quam speranda
in hac vita Attamen etiam cum imperfecta judiciorum Consenfione potest esse
vera, and pro hujus vitae modulo plena ac per ecta Concordia Romans 14. Phil.
3.15, 16. Forbes. Instruct. Historico-Theol. lib. 14. cap. 7.
Concord and Peace. Consent we call Unity in judgment; Concord, Unity of will
and desire, peace, quiet and calm conversation, a life void of janglings, and
free from tumults. There may be Consent without Concord; Concord without
Consent, and Peace without both. Men may agree in their opinion, and yet differ
in their desires; they may differ in opinion and desires, yet live in peace.

That there should be a mutual amity and forbearance amongst those, who differ
in matters of Church Government, or the like, but agree in the Fundamentals is
most reasonable.

It is a Question, An Ecclesia Protestantium conciliari possit cum Pontificiis?
Whether the Church of the Protestants may be reconciled with the Papists? Non
aliter sincera and cum essectu aliquo hono peragenda poterit praecedere
Conciliatio. Ante omniae Papa removeatur, aut in ordinem Episcoporum redigatur,
ut supra eos nihil amplius habeat potestatem praeter primatum ordinis, sed
omnes inter se pares sint, ut ab initio introducti in Ecclesiam Episcopatus

potest statim, and uno saltu omnium Reformatio perfici, and reducatur regimen
Presbyterale, quale ab Apostolis ex Christi praecepto institutum fuerit, ne

Episcopatu cepit, and in eo radices habet. Reducantur Sacramenta ad antiquum

Roma irreconciliabilis was Dr Hall's tenet.

Franciscus de Sancta Clara, Cassander, the Archbishop of Spalato, and
Millitier, and other Conciliators there have been, but all in vain.

Gentilettus in his Preface to his Apologia pro Christianis Gallis Religionis
Reformatae, says well, Imprimis hoc verissimum esse statuo, inter Catholicos
Romanos and Evangelicos Religionis Reformatae, in multi dogmatum Articulis, and
quidem praecipuis magnam esse contrarietatem. Nihilominus tamen in hoc omnes
convenient, ut agnoscant and profiteantur veritatem personae Jesus Christi in
duabus naturis non confusis, nec non sanctam Trinitatem Patris, Filii and
Spiritus sancti: amplectanturque omnes sanctam Scripturam Veteris and Novi
Testamenti.

Though the Papists and we agree in these things, that we both acknowledge the
Unity of the Person of Christ in two Natures not confounded, and the Trinity of
the Father, Son and holy Ghost, and all the holy Scripture of the Old and New
Testament, yet in many Articles of Religion we much differ, and chiefly in the
Doctrine of Justification. Vide Whitak. de notis Eccles.

Some make the great difference between the Papists and us to be about the
corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and the Infallibility of the Pope.

It is a Question, An cura Religionis ad Magistratum Civilem pertineat? Christ's
institutions are of his own appointment, yet the Magistrate has a Ministerium,
though not an Imperium here. He cannot make a Law, that this or that shall be a
religious service, but he may reform and purge, and also preserve Religion. An

Confess. Cathol. contra Pontis. l. 2. Special. partem 2dam. Artic. 8. De
Officio Magistratus in negotio Religionis.
Whether any thing of Religion come under the Magistrates Cognizance, or belong
to his care?

That it does, appears

First, From the Nature of Christianity, it goes through his whole
conversation, 1 Pet. 1.15. and reaches to all his relations. A Heathen
Magistrate or Parent is as truly a Magistrate and Parent, as a Christian
Magistrate or Parent. Christianity gives no farther power but a higher Law. The
name of Christianity lies in exercising it in all our relations.

Secondly, The Gospel is given for Nations, and is their great privilege that
receive it Magistrates ought to take care of all National privileges, Rev.
11.15.

Thirdly, That which God has promised to his people as a mercy, Magistrates
should labor to be, and fulfill in duty, Isa. 49.22. Psalm. 2.11.

It is a great Question, An Magistratus plures Religiones in una republica
tolerare debeat? Tolerantia diversarum Religionum quam perniciosa reipublicae,
so Mr Fox in his printed Commonplaces. Jactabimusne libertatem Conscientiis
permittendam esse minime, and hac quidem libertas intelligitur, id est, ut quo
quisque modo volet Deum colat. Est enim hoc mere Diabolicum dogma; sinendum
esse unumquemque ut si volet pereat. Et illa est Diabolica libertas quae
Poloniam and Transylvaniam body tot postibus implevit, qua^ nullae alioqui sub
sole regiones tolerarent. Bezae Epist. 1.
Whether it be lawful for a Magistrate to tolerate many Religions in one
Commonwealth?

Some give this distinction in the Doctrine of Toleration.

They put a difference inter Toleration and approbationem, a Magistrate must
discountenance all corrupt Doctrines, and before hand, Dissensum suum public
declarare debet. Religio non potest cogi, Religion cannot be constrained, and
yet blasphephemies must be restrained. See Revel. 2.20. Heretics should sure
not be advanced to high places.

Toleration (intolerable Tolerationem) is the great Diana much cried up in
these times.

Some think there is no love among men, unless they allow an universal
Toleration of all blasphemies and heresies; We must distinguish between loving
of men's persons and their errors, Ephesians. 4.15. 2 John v. 1, and 3. We should
join grace and truth, and charity together.

Some give these Cautions:

First, If they be such Religions as do not overthrow the foundation.

Secondly, Nor such as disturb the Government established in the State or
Kingdom.

Thirdly, If the Professors thereof be not factious, ambitious, or
pertinacious, but honest, simple, tractable, obedient to their Superiors.

Some say, Take heed of two destroying extremes:

First, That of the Libertines, that all should be tolerated without limitation.

Secondly, Others, who would have liberty for none but themselves, and men of
their own opinion.

For the Papists; They are not tolerated in Holland; The Jews are not only
tolerated, Les Catholics seut les seuls exclus de la grace universelle, don't
tous les autres jouissent, and n' ont aucun exercice libre du tout, quoy que
leur nombre ne soit pas petit, and que ceux qui suivent cette Religion, soyent
pour la plus part urais Hollandois and d' ancienne extraction, Les Delices De
La Hollande Premiere, party Chapitre xxiv.
but have the public exercise of their Religion, and their Synagogues, viz. at
Amsterdam.

I shall not need (I hope) to say much against their Toleration, the thing is
so grossly evil, and of that dangerous consequence to a Protestant State.

Dr Downam Bishop of Derry preaching before the Lord Deputy and the State at
Christ Church in Dublin in Ireland, November. 26. 1626. produced the judgment of
four and twenty Bishops (whereof only now the most reverend Primate of Armagh
is living) against it. Whose reasons I shall here insert.

First, It is to make our selves accessory not only to the Papists
Superstitions, Idolatry, Heresies, and in a word, to all their abominations of
Popery, but also (which is a consequence of the former) to the perdition of the
seduced people, which perish in the deluge of the Catholic Apostasy.

Secondly, To grant them a Toleration in respect of money to be given, or
contribution to be made by them, is to set Religion to sale, and withal the
souls of the people, whom Christ our Savior has redeemed with his most
precious blood: And as it is a great sin, so it is matter of most dangerous
consequence; and beseeching God to make all in Authority zealous of Gods glory,
and the Advancement of the true Religion, resolute and courageous against all
Popery, Superstition and Idolatry, he said, Let all the people say, Amen, which
they did with a loud acclamation.

It is a Question propounded by Helvicus System Controvers. Theolog. Quae
Christianis cum Judaeis intercedunt. Elench. Jud. 8. and ult. Profecto excusari
Magistratus Christianus non potest, si impune eorum blasphemias horrendas in
Christum, and S S. Trinitatem, totamque Religionem Christianam, diutius oculo
connivente toleret. Id. ibid. Amongst Gregory's Epistles, there is one De
Judaeis non persequendis.
, An Judaei a Magistratu Christiano tolerandi, and quomodo tractandi? Whether
the Jews be to be tolerated by the Christian Magistrate, and how they are to be
handled?

He says it is a perplex Question by reason of the different judgments.

He propounds first diverse Arguments of those which hold they are altogether to
be cast out of a Christian Commonwealth by reason of those horrible
blasphemies, which daily both in their ordinary prayers, and in their speeches
they belch out against Christ, the Virgin Mary, our faith, and all Christians
in general, and for other reasons which he there alleges.

Secondly, He urges other Arguments, to prove, that the Jews are not to be
cast out, but tolerated under the Christian Magistrate, because by that means
many of them may be converted by continual converse with the Christians, and
the Scripture seems evidently to confirm that, Hosea 3.4. Zephany 3.7. Luke
21.24. Romans 11.25, 26. And because they may be serviceable to them against
the Pagans, and for other reasons.

He himself goes the middle way, and lays down his opinion in certain
Propositions:

First, It is better for Jews to live amongst Christians, then under Turks or
Infidels.

Secondly, The blasphemies of Jews are not to be tolerated, but to be
prohibited and most severely punished by Christians.

Thirdly, The Jews are to be esteemed among Christians as the servants of
servants, that is so to be handled, that they are exiles and cast off by God
himself. They are not to have any public office. They are not to practice that
unjust Usury, for which they are so infamous amongst Christians. They are to
have also (said he) some outward mark in their garments, by which they may be
distinguished from others, and to be forced to hear Sermons. Many other
Cautions does he give in the receiving of them.

As for the Toleration of the Jews, whosoever they be that suffer the exercise
of their Religion, with the blasphemies they commonly use against Christ, make
themselves guilty of all their wickedness, which the Lord keep this Land from,
as well as from the abomination of the Mass. The Pope can tolerate the
blasphemy of the Jews, and the filthiness of all the Curtisans and Stews, and
take a yearly rent of them for it, and for no respect will allow the exercise
of our most holy Religion, either in his own Dominions, or wheresoever he may
prevail against us. Travers Answ. to a Popish Treatise written to the Lords of
the Council.

THE SECOND BOOK OF Learning.
CHAP. I. I. Of the Dignity and Excellency of Learning.
THere are three kinds of things to be desired, One, That which draws us to it
self by its own force, Non emolumento captans alique, sed trahens sua
dignitate; as Virtue, Knowledge and Truth. 2. Another, which is desired for
fruit and profit, as money. A third, which draws us both by its own force and
dignity, and by profit, the more to desire it, as friendship, and a good Name.
Eccles. 2.13. Quemadmodum ratione homines a reliquis animantibus, ita and
literis homines ipsi ab hominibus differunt. Qui igitur scribendo in commune
bonum aliquid proferrepotest, is quidem praestar, quod paucorum est praestare,
propterea quod non omnium sit literas discere aut docere: tanto autem majore
laud dignior est, quanto rarior est literarum scientia, quam aliarum vulgarium
artium quibus humana vira continetur. Scalig. Proleg. in Canon Chronol Isag.

esse non poreit: sic sine doctrina animus. Cultura autem animi eruditio est,
quae praeparat animos ad satus accipiendos, eaque mandat iis, and (ur ita
dicam) serit, quae adulta fructus uberrimos ferant. Citra cultum eruditionis
non potest homo revera esse* quod audit. Coelii Sec. Cur. orat. De ingenuis
artibus.


Learning is the perfection of reason, it was so prized by the Heathens, that
they thought a learned man to differ as much from an unlearned, as a man from a
beast.

Humane Learning delivers the mind from wildenesse and barbarism. Scilicet
ingenuas didicisse fideliter Arts.
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.
Ovid. de Pont. Artibus ingennis, quarum tibi maxima cura est,
Pectora mollescunt, asperitas que fugit.
Ovid. ad Gracinum. Nemo adeo ferus est qui non mitescere possit;
Si modo culturae patientem accommodet aurem.
Horat.

But the accent had need be put upon fideliter (as Sir Francis Bacon well
observes) for a superficial knowledge does rather work a contrary effect. Ego
been literatos viros eo benigniores candidioresque semper expertus sim, quo
magis and ingenio and eruditione polleront. Pier. Valor. Hieroglyph. lib. 23.
cap. 4. He instanceth there in Pontanus, Antonius Sabellicus, Pomponius Latus,
and shows how candid and courteous they were to all, and concludes, Jacobi
Sadoleti nomen aetate nostra in modestiae abiit appellationem. How much more
effectual is divine learning? Esa. 11.9.

Secondly, It mitigates the fear of death and adversity. If a man's mind be
seasoned with the contemplation of mortality, and the corruptible nature of
things, he will be ready to concur with Epictetus, who going forth one day,
saw a woman weeping for her pitcher of earth; and going forth the next day, he
saw another weeping for her son, said, Heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodie vidi
mortalem mori.

Thirdly, The pleasure and delight of Knowledge and Learning far surpasses all
other pleasure and delight; Therefore the Egyptians, Caldeans, Grecians,
Romans, have so highly prized humane wisdom, that they were willing to undergo
any labor or cost for the purchasing of it.

Fourthly, It does perpetuate and immortalize ones memory.

Excellent to this purpose is that of Seneca, Nomen Attici perire Ciceronis

progener, and Drusus Caesar pronepos; inter tam magna nomina taceretur, nisi
Cicero illum apernisset. Seneca Epist. 21.

Homers verses continued five and twenty Centuries of years and above, without
the loss of a syllable or letter.

Vox audita perit, litera scripta manet. The use of a good Book reaches far
and lasts long. Many more are instructed by Books then can be by speech, and
every good thing is better by how much it more communicates it self. By Books
we have conference with learned men deceased, and by these they instruct us as
much as they did those with whom they lived together.

Fifthly, As the ignorance of the people, and the Authority of the Roman Sea
increased together, Melch. Adam. in vit. Germ. Theol. and Gentilet. Exam.
Council. Trid. l. 1. Hoc nostro saeculo, ab anno M. D. ut literarum lumen majus

bona pars Galliae, Helvetiae, Poloniae, jam ejus Imperii jugum excusserunt,

Exam. Conc. Trid. l. 1.
so by the restoring of Arts and Learning, both ignorance, and the Authority of
the Pope of Rome decreased. What did Reuchline, Erasmus, Pagnine, Arias
Montanus, and others (though in other things Popish) suffer, for no other
reason, but because they did labor to propagate the knowledge of the Tongues.
So sad was the face of those times, Vt in authoribus latinis Graece nosse

Who does not loath the memory of the Goths and Vandals for the barbarism they
brought along with them? See Antoine Du Verdiers Preface to his Bibliotheque.
Et certe ex historiarum lectione constat, paulo post B. Augustini tempora bonas
liceras linguarum peritiam (necessaria Theologiae instrumenta) paulatim

Therefore the names of such are precious who were means of restoring learning
and knowledge, as in Italy, Hermolaus Barbarus, Picus Mirandula, Politian,
Baptista Mantanus; in Germany, Renchline, Erasmus, Beatus Rhenanus, Ludovicus
Vives; in France, Budaeus; in England, Linacer; in Spain, Antonius Nebriffensis.

The ancient Greek and Roman Princes were learned, and by it their Noblemen
were advanced to great honor.

Alexander the Great acknowledged himself as much beholding to his Master
Aristotle, as to his Father Philip, for the one gave him his being, the other
his wellbeing.

IT is useful for Physicians, Lawyers, but especially for Divines. Ita hodie

Languages, Arts and Sciences are great helps to the attaining of knowledge in
Divinity.

1. A competent knowledge of the Languages, at least of the three learned ones,
Hebrew, Greek and Latin, is very convenient, if not necessary, for one that
would be a complete Divine; Such see with their own eyes.

The knowledge and interpretation of Tongues is a very great gift of God,
promised by him in times past, Esa. 19.18. bestowed by Christ, attributed to
the holy Ghost, Acts 2. Paul commends the study of Languages to the Church and
all its members, 1 Cor. 14.

He which shall profess to be an absolute learned Divine without the knowledge
of three tongues at the least, may think well of himself, but hardly he shall
get and retain the credit he seeks among learned men in this learned age.

Jerome, Reuchline, Oecolampadius were famous for their skill in Hebrew, Greek
and Latin.

young Ministers by their skill in the original language, Seguimini laudabilem
Gallicarum Ecclesiarum consuetudinem, ubi Theologiae Candidato, in utriusque
Testamenti originali textu illud quod Praesidi Codicem aperienti se primo
exhibet caput, legendum and interpretandum proponitur. An minor in Anglia,
Germania, Dania, Belgio, Helvetia caeterisque Provinciis, linguas illas

See Erasmus his Ecclesiastes.

How do the Schoolmen (out of ignorance of the Tongues) err in the exposition
of the Old and New Testament, written in Hebrew and Greek, and what barbarisms
do they use in the Latin Tongue.

Octava nullitas Concilii Tridentini in eo vertitur, quod plerique omnes
Episcopi caeterique Concilii Praesules, quibus definiendi potestas erat,
perexigua admodum eruditione praediti essent. Nec enim in sacris literis,
priscorumque Patrum Canonibus ac Decretis, literisque Hebraicis, Graecis and
Latinis apprime versati erant, quas vix eorum quisquam a limine salutarat. Haec
est Baldi Doctoris doctissimi vulgo probata doctrina, in subtilioribus and
perplexis juris quaestionibus hebetiores rudesque literarum judices recusari
posse, ut qui ejusmodi nodos solvere nequeant. Gentilet. Exam. Conc. Trid. l. 5.
This is the eighth of the eleventh famous nullities which Gentilletus in his
Examen charge the Council of Trent with, viz. the illiteratenesse of many of
their Bishops, and other Presidents of their Council, in whom was the power of
deciding Controversies, which the Papists cannot justly object against the
members of the famous Synod of Dort.

The ignorance of the Monks is grown to a Proverb, Monacho indoctior. Belluae
immanis vox est, quod Licinius Imperator and nominis Christiani persecutor,
literas dixit virus and publicam pestem. Bibliand. de ratione communi omnium
linguarum, cap. 6.

The Grounds of the Greek and Hebrew tongue too are well taught in some Grammar
Schools.

Fundamenta linguae Graecae in trivialibus docentur, quarum novi aliquot sic
constitutas, ut quotquot ex iis prodeant, Novum Testamentum Graecum Grammatice
possint resolvere, novi Scholas, ubi fundamenta linguae Ebraeae, magno
Ecclesiae and juventutis bono jaciuntur. Sixth. Am. Paraen. de excitandis SS.
Linguarum studiis.

But says Mr Webster in his Academiarum Examen Page 6.
, It is not yet infallibly concluded which are the true original Copies
(especially concerning the Hebrew and the oriental Languages) the Jewish tongue
having been often altered and corrupted by their several intermixtures with,
and transmigrations into other Nations, or that they have been purely and
sincerely preserved unto our hands. For Languages change and alter as fashions
and garments; Neither have we any thing to assure us in this point, but bare
tradition and history, which are various, perplex, dubious, contradictory and
deficient.

To this I answer, Who (but the ignorant) deny that the Hebrew Copies are the
Original of the Old Testament. Were not the Scriptures of the Old Testament
committed to the Jews? And was not the Hebrew the Jewish language? Indeed the
Jews by their Captivity in Babylon learned the Chaldee tongue, and so some of
the Old Testament, as Ezra and Daniel were written in that language.

Secondly, What if the Jewish tongue has been often altered and corrupted, and
generally languages change and alter like fashions and garments? Is that any
reason why we should doubt of the sincerity of the Hebrew Copies? By this
reason we must question the works of Demonsthenes, Cicero, and generally all
others, because the languages wherein they wrote was since altered.

Thirdly, Is there nothing but bare tradition and History to inform us of the
originals, when as the originals themselves are extant before our eyes? And we
may know them to be sincere, because generally all Copies throughout the world,
though written at several times in several places do accord.

He objects further, Page 7. Knowledge of Tongues can but teach the Grammatical
Construction, signification and interpretation of words, propriety of phrases,
deduction of Etymologies, and such like; all which tend to no farther then the
instamping of a bare literal understanding, and all this may be, the mystery of
the Gospel being unknown, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

To this I answer with Melancthon, Scriptura non potest intelligi Theologice
nisi prius intelligatur Grammatice. Melancth.
If we understand not the signification of the words, how can we know the
things signified by them? Whereas he opposes tongues, and the Spirit,
Subordinata non pugnant, If he will so rely on the Spirit, as utterly to
exclude tongues, Why does he make use at least of his mother tongue for the
understanding of the Scriptures? He says there, He that understands the
original tongues, in which the Text was written, conceives no more of the mind
of God thereby, than he that only can read or hear read the Translation in the
mother tongue. Yes, because the mind of God is primarily in the Original, and
but secondarily in the Translation, in that the Translation is out of the
Original, and does no further contain in it the Word of God, then it does agree
with the Original.

He adds yet further, What difference is there between him that relies upon
his Teachers skill, and he that relies upon the skill of a Translator, are they
not both alike, since they are but both Testimonia humana, full of errors,
mistakes and fallacies?

It is much that he cannot perceive a difference between these two: He that
relies upon the skill of a Translator, relies upon it for that particular
Translation which he does make use of: but he that relies upon the skill of his
Teacher only, relies upon it for his general knowledge of the language which
is taught him besides, no man has need so wholly to rely on his Teachers
skill, having many other means to know whether his Teacher rightly instruct him
or no, as some have to rely on the skill of a Translator, p. 7. But he proceeds.

The errors and mistakes that still remain, and are daily discovered in all
Translations, do sufficiently witness men's negligence and ignorance, that in
the space of sixteen hundred years, have not arrived at so much perfection, as
to complete one Translation.

This very reason which he alleges against the knowledge of Tongues, Et
sancta Hebraea est lingua, and cuivis Theologiae studioso necessaria. Etsi enim
monumenta Apostorum and Evangelistarum Graeca sunt: tamen phrasis est Hebraica.
Itaque recte dixerunt veteres: Hebraeos bibere ex fontibus: Graecos ex rivulis:
Latinos ex lacunis. Melch. Adam. in vita Graseri. Paulus linguarum genera
tenere donum purat Spiritus Sancti, nos adeo ridemus, ut vix homine putemus
dignum? Paulus divinationis muneri, vel anteponit, nos Sophisticis etiam nugis
postponimus? Paulus gratias agit Deo, cujus beneficio tantum sibi bonum
contigerit, nos eos, qui nobis tantum bonum etiam domi desidentibus e longinquo
adferunt, circulatores vocitamus, and indignis modis tractamus? Pet. Mosell.
Orat. de var. Ling. Cognit. Vide Crines. De Confus. Ling. cap. xi and xii.
does show the necessity of it. For if errors and mistakes do still remain,
and are daily discovered in all Translations, Is there not the more need of
skill in the Originals, that so we may not be carried away with those errors
and mistakes? And how should those errors in Translations be discovered but by
skill in the Originals. But suppose that no man's skill in the Originals is so
great, as to free him from errors and mistakes in translating, is therefore
all his skill to no purpose? By the same reason all Mr Websters preaching
should be in vain, because he is not infallible, but sometimes may mistake the
meaning of the Scripture which he cites.

I suppose it therefore very profitable for a Divine (which I think was
Reverend Mr Wheatleys usual practice) to read daily a Chapter in the Old
Testament in Hebrew, and in the New Testament in Greek.

Illud enim volo, Theologiae studioso and verbi Dei ministro tantum semper
debere esse a rebus aliis otii, ut quotidie caput aliquod in utriusque Testam.
Originali Textu legate, and quidem cum brevi succinctoque Commentario, vel
Junii, vel Bezae, vel Piscat. vel Vatabli. Sixth. Amam. Consilium de studio
Ebraico feliciter instituendo.

Secondly, The Knowledge of the Arts is also very requisite for a Divine.

Therefore Licinius and Julian envying such a good to the Church of Christ used
their endeavors to deprive the Christians of the studies of them, most vain
sports being set up in their room.

Christ at first (to show the glory of his greatness) took and employed
Fishermen, such as had no bringing up in Schools. But it was not long after,
but learned men came in apace. Learned men of all sorts, Zenas in Law, Tit.
3.13. Luke in Physic, 1 Timothy 4.11. Apollo with his Eloquence, Act. 18.24.
Dionyse with his Philosophy, Urbs Tarsus clara Schola and Academia a Strabone
celebrata lib. 14. Divi Pauli patria. Neand. Geog. part. 2.
Act. 17.34. Paul with his much learning, Act. 26.24. which he had at Tharsus,
as famous an University for Asia, as Athens was for Greece. See 1 Cor. 14.18.

Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, Act. 7.22. which Nation
was one of the most ancient Schools of the world. Solomon passed all the
children of the East in their own learning, 1 King. 4.30. Daniel was brought
up, and well seen in the cunning of the Chaldeans, Dan. 1.4.

First, All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in the Scripture, of
natural and moral Philosophy, Numerorum imperitia multa facit non intelligi,
translate ac mystice posita in Scripturis. Ac numerum and musicam plerisque in
locis ac sanctis Scripturis posita, honorabiliter invenimus. August. lib. 2. de
doct. Christ. cap. 16. and 38. Melancthon linguarum and artium studia
comparavit Cophinis, in quibus fragmenta panum colligi and reponi jubebantur,
Matthew. 14 v. 20. Cum sint adminicula, per quae doctrina coelestis commode
tradi, ad posteros propagari and contra adversarios propugnari possit. Gerh.
Meth. Stud. I heol.
of the Politics, of Poetry, of History, of Mathematics, Metaphysics, and
many of them in that one Book of Job.

How shall a Minister be able without some skill in Logic to analyze his Text?
The whole Scripture abounds with Arguments, the strength of which one cannot
perceive but from Logic, and how shall he be able to discover or confute the
sophistry and false reasoning of Heretics without it. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib.
2. cap. 18.

Of the use of Logic in Divinity, See Mr Gataker against Saltmarsh, Shadows
without Substance, p. 20.

He may draw likewise excellent sentences, famous examples, profitable precepts
from History and Philosophy.

The Scripture is full of Metaphors and figurative speeches which have profit
as well as ornament. A great part of the whole 6th of John is framed of such
speeches, how shall one understand the meaning of such places without some
skill in Rhetoric?

Secondly, The knowledge of the Arts is requisite for a Divine to refute errors.

Chronologia and Geographia principem sibi locum vendicant in Theologia quia in
sacris literis continetur praeter fidei morumque praecepta, etiam Ecclesiae
historia. Est autem olim dictum, Historiae oculos esse Chronologiam and
Geographiam. Haec terrarum ambitum describens, locos judicat quibus singula
gesta, adeoque quasi in rem praesentem deducit. Illa vero annorum saeculorumque
seriem explicat. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib. 2. c. 18.
The Socinians begin in Philosophical principles, and the Papists begin in
Logic about accidents, when they would establish their Transubstantiation.

Zanch. de Tribus Elohim part altera, cap. 1. reckons up this as one cause of
heresy, viz. the ignorance of true and solid Philosophy and Logic, and the
Liberal Arts.

How many Chronological difficulties are there in the Scripture, which will not
be resolved without some skill in Chronology. Compare 1 King. 6.1. with Acts
13.20. 2 Kings 24.10. with 2 Chronicles. 36.9. 2 Chronicles. 22.2. with 21.20.

Some say the holy Ghost did obscure some things in Chronology to sharpen men's
wits.

Object. Colos. 2.8. Beware least any man spoil you through Philosophy and vain
deceit, (...), i.e. through the vain deceit of Philosophy, for either it did
promise eternal life, or did not show the true and certain way which led
thither. So Grotius.

Some think he bids them beware of Plato's Philosophy, not of Philosophy in
general, Neque Apostolus ad Colossenses veram and naturalem Philosophiam, sed
inanem duntaxat and deceptricem damnavit. Zanch. ad Arianum Respons.

The learning of the Magi (who were skilled in the Stars and Bodies Celestial)
hindered them not in their coming to Christ. The gold and spoils of Egypt, did
the Tabernacle no hurt, which was hung all over with them.

Humane Learning may be lawfully used in a divine exercise, Some think it is a
childish thing for a Minister to use exotic language in a popular Auditory
from 1 Cor. 14, 20.
four conditions being observed.

The first concerns the end, the confirmation of faith, not vainglory.

Secondly, If the profaneness or Ethnicisme in them be castrated, as Deuteronomy. 21.

Thirdly, That we always so use humane learning as we give the Scripture the
upper-hand.

Fourthly, That these citations of humane Writers, be used not as meat, Vide
Sculteti Orationem De Conjungenda Philologiam cum The^logia. We are debtors
(says Paul) to the learned and unlearned. Zanchius in his second Oration, De
conservando in Ecclesia puro puro Dei verbo, shows, That there are only three
necessary causes which happen but seldom, for a good Preacher; extra limits S.
literarum, per scripta Poetarum and Philosophorum, aut etiam Patrum evagari,
either by reason of the obstinacy of heretics, which being not satisfied with
the Scriptures, are to be convinced with other reasons and testimonies, or for
the calumnies of the malevolent, which it is necessary to refell with other
testimonies then those of the Scriptures; or lastly, by reason of the infirmity
of some weak brethren, which cannot be wholly divorced from their old
superstition, and be settled in the truth delivered, unless the same be also
confirmed by the testimonies of the ancient Fathers. The Apostle Paul thrice
indeed cites the sayings of profane Poets, because they were fit for the
matter which he handled, but he neither names the Poets, neither did he do it
often (says he) nor without good reason, but only mentions some short speeches
of theirs, seldom, soberly, and as it were obiter, being compelied thereto,
that the Gentiles by the sayings of Gentiles might be convinced. Therefore the
Fathers do not so use the sayings of Philosophers and Poets in their Homilies
to the Church, as in their disputations and books against the Heathens.
but as sauce, sparingly. Dr Chalon. Sermon. on Tit. 1.13. Philosophandum est sed
paucis.

Humane knowledge or learning is abused:

First, When we rest in it, lean not to thine own understanding, when we think
to look into divine mysteries with the spectacles of nature.

Secondly, When we boast of it as our chiefest excellency, Jer. 9.23. Religion
is the highest excellency, the truest wisdom is that whereby we know and enjoy
the chiefest good.

Thirdly, When we oppose learning to the wisdom of Scripture, and confine God
to the Laws of nature, 1 Cor. 1.23.

Fourthly, The naked Theory of divine knowledge, idle and unactive knowledge,
all knowledge is for practice, Prove. 14.8. Psalm. 111.10. Deuteronomy. 4.6. Prove. 8.30.

Some times are more favorable to learning then others.

About the time of our Saviors coming, curious Arts, and other civil
Disciplines did most flourish. The Grecians sought after wisdom, and secular
Philosophy, the Romans after Policy, State-knowledge and Discipline of wars.
All the world almost (above others, those parts wherein Christianity was first
placed) was then set upon curious Arts, yet the study and search of Scriptures
in a short time devoured all, and brought them to acknowledge allegiance unto
it. Dr Jacks. Comment on the Creed Vol. 1. l 1. c. 3.

Wolfius in his Lectiones Memorabiles mentions the learned men of every Century.

Superstition and ignorance both together at the latter end of the ninth
Century, as a thick mist dangerously invaded and possessed the Church, when the
forging of Legends and Relics, and such like trumpery was as common and highly
esteemed as the Scripture, and preaching was discountenanced, and utterly out
of use.

Some places also are more propitious to learning then others.

Athens in Greece, of which see afterward. Basilea omnibus temporibus produxis

Corduba in Spain is celebrated also this way. It was the Country of Avicenna,
and Averroes and Razis, and of Seneca Ner^os Master, and Lucan the Poet.

Holland, Hackwell, Prideaux, Justice Doddridge, William Noy.

Essex has been fruitful of good Divines, the younger Hooker, Dent, Fenner,
the two Dikes, many Rogers.

Naples in Italy.

Virgil the Prince of Poets lived in Naples, Livie, Horace, Claudian, Francis
Petrarch, who was very intimate with Robert King of Naples, Antonius
Beccadellus surnamed Panormitane, an excellent Orator, Laurentius Valla, the
Refiner of the Latin Tongue, Porcellus a most elegant Poet, Blondus a studious
searcher of all Antiquity, Bartholomaeus Facius, Nicolaus Saguntinus, all most
excellent men.

CHAP. III. Of the Liberal Arts and Sciences.
AN Art is a Collection of universal precepts prepared to know, act or work in
some certain latitude of end. Ars est rei cujusque scientia, usu, vel
traditione, vel ratione praecepta, tendens ad usum aliquem vitae necessarium
Bibliand. de rat. Comm. omnium ling. Ars est collectio universalium
praeceptorum parara ad cognoscendum, agendum, vel operandum, in certa aliqua
finis latitudine. Ludov. Viv. de tradend. Discip. lib. 1.


Nataram aemulatur aers, sed non plane assequitur, says Bibliander, as we may
see in painting and many other works.

All Arts are distinguished by the end not the matter.

Seneca Consolatione ad Marciam. cap. 18. Genesis 4.21, 22. The knowledge even of
mechanical Arts ought to be referred to God the Author, as the very Gentiles
by the light of Nature were forced to confess, and the Scripture witnesses in
the builders of the Tabernacle of Moses, and of Solomon's Temple.
distinguishes Arts into three kinds, some which instruct the life, others
which adorn it, others which rule it. The mechanical Arts instruct the life.
Liberal Arts are properly those which become free and ingenuous men, which
require understanding, not the operation of the hands.

They are called Liberal Arts, because they are worthy of a Freeman, Arts
ingenuae seu liberales idcirco appellatoe sunt, quod libero ac ingenuo sint
homine diguae: sive quod liberos suos sectatores efficiant, and in fastigio
rerum humanarum quasi reges collocent and reponant. Cael. Secund. Cur. Orat. de
ingenuis artibus. Latini arts vocant liberales tanquam libero homine dignas.
Voss de Philol. cap. 1. Sunt arts universae in duo genera distribu^ae: in
Logicas and Mathematicas. Logicas appellarunt quae in sermonis ratione
versantur: Mathematicas, in quantitate. Quantitatis autem duplex genus
fecerunt, aliud dejunctum, aliud conjunctum. Dejuncta ad numeros pertinent, ex
quibus ea disciplina manavit, quam Arithmaticen dixere. Quemadmodum ex
conjunctis Geometria, in qua lineamenta, formae, intervalla, magnitudines
versantur. Porro numeri ipsi ad harmoniam translati, Musicem pepererunt, ea
enim numeros, voces, and modos continet. Geometriae facultas ad res coelestes
accomodata, nobis dedit Astrologiam, in qua Coeli conversio, ortus, obitus,
motusque siderum considerantur. Rursum eadem ipsa Geometria ad vim cernendi
traducta, Opticen produxit, quae causas affert cur oculi interdum vivendo
decipiantur, cum aut majores, aut minores, quam sint res, esse videantur. Ex
hac vero and ipsa Geometria, pingendi ars orta videtur, quam veteres inter
liberales numerabant. Caelii Secun. Cur. Orat. de ingen. art.
and ingenuous, as if only ingenuous persons should learn and exercise them.

It is a received opinion, That there are seven Liberal Arts, three concerning
speech, Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, four concerning Quantity, Geometry,
Arithmetic, Music, Astronomy, which the Grecians call Mathematics.

Gram: loquitur, Dia: vera docet, The: verba colorat
Mus: canit, Ar: numerat, Geo: ponderat, Ast: docet astra.
(...), dicitur, quasi (...), that is, the circle of the Arts, which was wont
to be accounted by the number of the seven Liberal Arts.

Ric. Vitus Basingstock in his fifth Oration De studiorum finibus, says, All
Arts and Sciences are but ten, the seven Liberal Arts beforementioned, and
three more, Ethics, Physic, Metaphysics, into which all Philosophy is
divided.

Sir Francis Bacon Advancem. of Learning, l. 2. cap. 1.

says, That is the truest Partition of humane Learning, which has reference
to the three faculties of man's soul, which is the seat of Learning. History is
referred to Memory, Poesy to the Imagination, Philosophy to Reason. Theology
also or divine Learning (says he) consists either of sacred History, of
Parables, which are a kind of divine Poesy; or of Precepts and Doctrines, as
an eternal Philosophy.

There are three Organical Arts, and Arts concerning speech. Grammar,

which shows what should be spoken, and with what Reason; Rhetoric which is
for Ornament; and Logic which is for Argument and proof.

Some call these three general Arts, because they have their use in all things
and Arts.

I. Grammar. It has its name from letters.

This is as it were an usher to other Sciences, a place not very honorable,
yet necessary, it is an Antidote against that malediction of the confusion of
Tongues, Polyd. Verg. It is an Art of speaking well.

Others add, and of writing, but in vain, when writing happens to speaking.
Its end is to speak well, the means conducing to this end are the rules of
classical writers founded on use.

That which is commonly called Orthographia, is better called Orthocepia,
because speaking was before writing, which happens to speech.

The beginning of this Art and Rhetoric (says Suetonius l. de grammat.) was
thus, by the observation of those things which were either fit or unfit in
speaking, men noting those things either to imitate or shun them, made this
Art. Austin says, That there were Grammarians among the people of Israel in
the time of Moses.

That would be a most excellent kind of Grammar, if some man skillful in many
Languages, as well learned, as mother-tongues, should write a Treatise of the
diverse Proprieties of Languages; showing in what points every particular
Language does excel, and in what points it was deficient.

Despauterius was a famous Latin Grammarian, Clenard a Greek one, John Isaac
an Hebrew one. Our Linacer also was a special Grammarian, and his books de
Emendata Structura have much conduced to expel barbarism.

Gerardius Vossius has put out a most learned and elaborate book De Art
Grammatica, and another De vitiis Sermonis.

Nuncupantur autem triviales scholae quasi vulgares, and in triviis
constitutae: quomodo nomen id nulli Scholae, ad Latinas, Graecasque literas
discendas publicitus constitutae conveniat: quae raro in triviis erectae: quin
fere una duntaxat etiam in magnis est urbibus, vel potius inde trivialibus
Scholis nomen fecerunt majores, quod in his tres arts, Grammaticen,
Rhetoricen, Logicen, docerent. Nam eas trivium dixere: ut quadrivium, quatuor
arts Mathematicas; Arithmeticen, Geometriam, Astrologiam, and Muficen: quod ex
Cassiodoro cognoscimus. Voss De vitiis Sermonis l 1. c. 26. Quod Philosophi,
quod Medici, quod jure consulti, quod omni literarum genere plerique exculti
sunt, huic uni acceptum referunt omnes: Siquidem per unam Grammaticen, ad omne
disciplinarum genus gradum fieri necesse est. Nam ut in aedificiis videmus,
nisi solida firmaque constiterint fundamenta, labefactari omnia divuliaque
ruinam trahere: sic in disciplinarum profectu, nisi quis puri dilucidique
sermonis doctrinam solid substruxerit, frustra caeteris in sudabit? Cael Sec.
Cur. Orat in Nicol. Invitiat. nobil. Grammat.
Trivial and Grammar Schools are to be respected and encouraged, because they
are the Nurseries of Learning, there the foundation being well laid, young
plants thence removed to the public Universities, well furnished with that
kind of Learning, may prove eminent instruments in Church or State.

Grammar challenges the first place to it self, and boys are to learn both
the Greek and Latin Grammar. Non modo quod his duabus linguis omnia ferme sunt
prodita quae digna cognitu videantur, verum etiam quod utraque alteri sic
affinis est, ut ambae citius percipi queant conjunctim, quam altera sine

For the pure Greek writers, Erasmus commends chiefly Lucian, Demosthenes,
Herodotus; and of the Poets, Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides. For the Latin

II. Logic. It is the most universal of all Arts.

It is useful for all Sciences. It is ingeniorum lima and cos.

The proper formal object of it is Reason, its adequate end to dispute well.

The duties of a Logician, are either general, as that which is comprehended in
the definition of Logic, to reason well; or special, as those which be
contained in the distribution of Logic, to invent well, and to judge well.

Logice dirigit intellectum in cognitione very: praecipuaque ejus instrumenta
sunt argumentatio, definitio, divisio, methodus. Gerard. Joan. Vos. De
Studiorum ratione part priore.

Zeno the Stoic said, Rhetoric was like the palm, or the hand stretched out,
Logic to the fifth, he might have said more fitly (says Ludovicus Vives De
Cause. corrupt. Art. lib. 4.

Dialectica est ars been disserendi, id est, rations rerum been discernendi,
and inter se componendi. Ames. Demonstrat. Logicae verae. These 1. Opus
praecipium, Syllogismus, Demonstrativus. Savil. Lect. 12. in Euclyd.


) that the Logician collects an Argument for the subtle examination of the
learned, but the Rhetorician applies it to the popular sense, for the Orator
often more briefly collects then the Logician.

III. Rhetoric is a speech dressed with certain allurements proper to please
and persuade. Rhetorica scientia est ornate, distinct, apteque dicendi. Cel.
Sec. Cur. Orat. De Rhet. usu. Oratori propositum est quod est per suasibile,
Poerae admirabile, Historico verum. Stradae Prolas. Hist. 3. part. 2.


Tully says, The absolute praise of an Orator is threefold, Docere,
Delectare, Movere; Docere debitum est, Delectare honorarium, permovere
necessarium.

The great virtue of an Oration is perspicuity, Omnis oration tres habet
virtutes, ut emendata, ut dilucida Oration cujus summa virtus est per.
spicuitas, quam sit vitiosa, si egeat interpret. Quintil. Institut. Orat. lib.
1. cap. 6. Rhetorica a (...) vetere Graeciae verbo, quod est fluo, vel dico,
dicta esse videtur, quod sermonis ornatum and copiam quandam aurei fluminis
instar polliceatur. Oratoriam artem Cicero and Quintilianus, duo hujusce artis
lumina hanc dici posse docuerunt, candem tamen fere definientes, been dicendi
tum artem, tum facultatem, tum doctrinam, tum rationem vocitarunt. Nihil aliud
est eloquentia, nisi copiose loquens sapientia. Et been dicere, non est ornate
tantum, sed scienter and perite, simul and ornate dicere. Praeclare enim, ut
omnia, illud dixit Orator: Ex rerum cognitione efflorescat and redundet oporter
oration: quae, nisi subest res ab Oratore percepta and cognita, inanem quandam
habet elocutionem, and pene puerilem. Ut enim sine lumine corpora cernere non
possumus, ita sine eloquentia nemo sensa and cogitationes suas in lucem apt
proferre potest. Quod sol mundo hoc eloquentia caeteris doctrinis est, sine hac
non arts modo aliae, sed res omnes, quae quidem sint dictione explicandae, in
altissimo tenebrarum caligine versarentur. Cel. Sec. Cur. Orat. De ingenuis
artibus.
, ut ornata sit. Quintil. Instit. orat. l. 1. c. 5.

Nazianzene in one of his Orations says, He affected Rhetoric so much,
because he had some thing of value to esteem as nothing for Christ.

Nemo te, nisi tu, exprimere recte valet. None is able to set forth eloquence
but it self. This has immortalized Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Homer, Virgil,
Herodotus, Thucydides, Livie, Salust.

Cum Ciceronem dico, ipsam Romanam eloquentiam intelligere debetis. Cum vero
libros de oratore, opus in ea facultate putatote, quo opere nullum nec Graecia,
nec Italia melius aut perfectius unquam habuit. Cael. Sec. Cur. Orat. de
ingenuis artibus. Vide ejus orat. De Rhetoricae usu.

Quintilian makes it a chief end and fruit of long pains and exercises in the
Art of Rhetoric, to attain to such a faculty, Eloquentia maxim in liberis
civitatibus floruit, velut Athenis and Romae, quod is certissimus esset gradus
ad maximos honores ac potentiam. Ludov. Viv. de causis corrupt. art. lib 1.
Menilius vero incomparabilis tunc eloquentiae vir, and quod summae prudentiae
suit, iniquioris caussae nusquam defensor, tanto nativi sermonis candore, tanta
sententiarum ubertate Patrum animos demulcebat, ut eos in quam optaret partem
fere flecteret ac impelleret. Seaev. Samarth. Elog. Gallorum doctrina
illustrium. l. 2.
as to be able also upon any sudden occasion to speak pertinently without any
premeditation.

What an enchanting force has Rhetoric? One had need of the force of
Demosthenes, or rather, that divine eloquence of Tully, to set forth the due
praises of eloquence.

Pierius Valerianus observes in the 26 Book of his Hieroglyphics, that sweet
eloquence is signified by the Hieroglyphics of the Be. Bees settled on Plato's
lips when he was a child sleeping in the Cradle, a presage of his future
eloquence. The same is reported of Ambrose and Pindar.

The same Pierius in the 41 Chapter of his 20 Book of Hieroglyphics says,
Wise men did put Sirens for the Hieroglyphick of Eloquence, and the persuading
force of Rhetoric, whence that saying of Cato the Grammarian, Cato
Grammaticus, Latina Siren.

CHAP. IV. Of the Mathematics.
THe Mathematics are so named, because they are not learned without a teacher.
Mathesis a (...) di^co, quod hanc prae reliquis pueri olim discebant.
Explorandae ^orum indolis and ingenii ergo. Ames. Technomet.

Mathemata quod sine praece tore percipi nequeant, dicta sunt. Exinde scientiae
Mathematicae dicuntur, quia primitus solae discerentur, antequam animum
adpellerent ad Philosophiam naturalem, vel civilem. Vossius de Mathemat.
Mathematicas disciplinas omnium accuratissimas and utilissimas multis probat
Plato in Philaeo. Ideoque primas has arts apud Graecos, tanquam doctrinae
quaedam rudimenta discebant, quia scilicet ad reliquas scientias aditum
aperiunt; Nam and ingenia acuunt eorumque solertiam augent, ad rerum
contemplationem excitant, and celeritatem quandam percipiendi conciliant. Et
quoniam imitatione percipiuntur, aptae puerilibus animis qui ea potissimum
ducuntur. Joan. a Wovver. De Polymathia. Tractat. cap. 23. Non solum in
demonstrationum certitudine and scientiae pulchritudine: sed and veritate
multiplicique cognitionis copia reliqua artium genera long antecellunt hae
disciplinae, adeo ut non immerito ob id Mathematicae, quasi solae disciplinarum

de Discipl. Mathem. Vide Joannis Pellii Orat. inaugural.




When Alexander bad his Mathematick master make his lessons easier to him then
in his ordinary way to others, he answered him well, The Mathematics were
alike difficult to all.

The ancient Philosophers taught their Pupils Mathematics very soon, as
appears by Aristotle and others, they confirming their Propositions by
mathematical demonstrations, the knowledge whereof must be presupposed. See
Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mat.

The Mathematics are a most accurate and profitable study for the evidence and
certainty of their demonstrations.

Abraham was famous for teaching the Mathematics first among the Chaldeans,
and after he taught the same Arts, as Historians write.

The old Mathematicians drew their proportions in dust with a Compass, the
better to show what they would. De natura Deorum. Pers. ^at. 1.
Tally calls it learned dust.

Et secto in pulvere metas. Archimedes was doing this when Siracuse was taken.

Viri nobiles, ac principes, qui non sucrandi, sed Phi^os^phandi causa literis
dant operam, Mathematicis maxim studiis delectantur. Inter quos celeberrimi
extiterunt, ex antiquis quidem Archimedes Regum Siciliae consanguineus; Boethius
vir consularis; Alphonsus Rex Hispaniarum: nostra vero aetate Marchio
Guidobaldus, Princeps Ticho Brahe; Franciscus Candalla, and alii complures,
quorum monumenta in omne aevum permansura mundus mirabitur. Blancani Dissertat.
De Natura Mathematicarum, cap. 3.
Princes and great persons have studied the Mathematics, and those that study
them to purpose, had need to have some Princes or great persons to encourage
them therein by their bounty, in respect of the chargeablenesse of their
instruments, as Tycho Brahe somewhere says.

Mathematics are either Pure or Mixed:

Qui Mathematicus audire cupit, non Arithmeticam modo and Geometriam, quae
Mathesin proprie dictam and ab omni materia abstractam constituunt, verum and
Astronomiam Geographiam, Opticam, Mechanicam, and Staticam, Musicam, Geodaesiam
and Architecturam militarem, probe calleat oportet. Hortensii Dissertat. De
studio Mathematico recte instituendo.
To pure Mathematics those Sciences are referred, which handle Quantity
altogether abstracted from matter; and Physical axioms, they are two, Geometry
and Arithmetique, the one handling continued Quantity, the other dissevered
Quantity, or number.

To mixed Mathematics Astronomy and Music are usually referred, and the
Optics.

I. Arithmetique is an Art of numbering well. Arithmetica est doctrina been
numerandi. Rami. Arithm. l. 1.

Arithmetica and Musica separatim magnitudinem, id est, numeros considerat.
Geometria magnitudinem conjunctam, stabilem and immotam, Astronomia mobilem.
Arithmetica merito prima, quae reliquis omnibus usui: ab ea and musica
principia sumit. Nam ut Arithmetica proprietates numerorum absolute considerat:
ita musica easdem in sonorum differentiis and proportionibus contemplatur.
Ratio enim harmoniae quae est musicae, numeris and figuris constat. Harum
auxiliis Geometria and Astronomia uruntur. Nam sine Arithmetica, Geometria
subsistere non potest. Numerorum enim cognitio prior denotatione linearum. Et
ex numeris lineae inventae, ex lineis figurae productae. Astronomia a Geometria
lineas and figuras ad coelorum orbs, siderum conversiones considerandas,
corporum coelestium intervalla colligenda, eorumque magnitudinem describendam
adsumit. Joan. a Wovver. De Polymath. Tractat. c. 23. Arithmetica sub^ilior est
quam Geometria. Quod cunque enim vel accipit vel probat Geometria per numeros
dirigi potest ab iis enim pendet to^a magnitudinum consideratio Mathematicarum.
At infinita procedent in numeris, quorum multa non potuerunt in magnitudinum
natura comprehendi. Scalig. De Subtle. ad Cardan. Exercit. 321. Denique si quid
est, in quantitate subtilitatis, id omne ex numerorum ratione haustum est.
Pendet igitur Geometriae dispositio ab Arithmetici constitutione. Quae res apud
nominem controversa est. Subtilior igitur haec, quae illius statuit principia
ac ^undamenta. Id. ibid.




Pythagoras first brought it into an Art, thence the Pythagor^ans did swear per
numerum quaternarium, quo nihil apud eos videtur esse perfectius. For there are
four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth; four times of the year, Spring, Autumn,
Summer, Winter; four qualities of all things, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Dryness,
four Coasts of the Heaven, East, West, North, South.

It is the first of the Mathematics, and useful to all the rest.

One should get some skill in the vulgar Arithmetique before he learn Geometry,
and that either by a teacher, or by plain books, such as the Arithmetique of
Gemma Frisius, or Ramus with Snellius his Notes.

The principle of number is unity, as of magnitude punctum.

By this the Pythagoreans in times past covered the mysteries of all nature,
and even of God himself, as if all things were agreeable to numbers.

The Phenicians write as all the Eastern Nations, from the right hand to the
left: the reason why the outermost figure to the right hand in Arithmetique
stands in the first place, they also being the inventers of that Science.
George Sandys upon the 3d Book of Ovids Metam.

Some learned men speak much of the Algebra, Quam mirabile illud veluti
scientiarum monstrum, ac portentum, quod Algebram vocant? Nihil fortasse in
tota peritiae Encyclopedia subtilius, profundius nihil, non humano ingenio par
est, sed quid coelitus revelatum dixeris: numeros illos, quos surdos vocant,
and qui nullo modo exprimi postunt addit, subtrahit, multiplicat, dividit,
perinde ac si numeri communes essent. Ii qui hanc callent eruditionem nihil in
numerorum infinita ditione obscurum nihil arduum timeant. Biancani Dissertatio
De natura Mathematicarum, cap. 4.
as a famous invention in Arithmetique.

II. Geometry is an Art of measuring well.

The measures of things are taken from the parts of man, his finger, palm,
foot, Geometria est ars been metiendi, Rami Geomet. lib. 1. cap. 16. Geometria
pars est Mathematicae scientiae, imo basis ac fundamentum, atque ut Philo site
loquitur, Metropolis omnium artium Mathematicarum. Nam ex ea, tanquam matrice
civitate, derivatae sunt illae nobilissimae Coloniae, Optica, Astronomia,
caeterae; ipsaque adeo Arithmetica, cujus subjectum est simplicissimum, and
Geometrico simplicium, remotiusque a materia, utpore carens situ, Geometriae
adminiculo stat, eaque nititur, quod admirabile culpiam videatur, ad
conclusiones suas demonstrandas. Etsi ex altera part non negarim Geometriam
quoque in irrationalium praesertim doctrina, lucem and praesidium ab
Arithmetica mutuari. Savil. Lect. 2. in Euclyd. Habet magnas utilitates
Geometria, sed voluptat^s etiam partibus infinitis majores habet, quibusque
fimile nihil in alia ulla disciplina reperietu^: neque enim Grammaticus rhetor
logicus, alioqui ettam physicus, and Ethicus invenit in art sua novi laetitia
elatus, immolasse diis memoratur. Thales Milesius cum trianguli in circulo
inscriptionem invenisset bovem diis immolavit. Ram. Orat. De sua professione.
Vide plura ibid.
cubit.

A barley corn is the least measure; the finger is the breadth of four barley
corns; the palm four fingers; the foot four palms. A cubit from the elbow to
the end of the longest finger is a foot and an half.

From those measures arises the measure of a journey, a pace, a furlong; a
mile, a geometrical pace is five foot, a furlong 125 paces, a mile a thousand
paces, eight furlongs.

Quatuor ex granis digitus componitur unus,
Est quater in palmo digitus, quater in pade palmus,
Quinque pedes passum faciunt, passus quoque centum
Viginti quinque stadium daut, sed m^liare
Octo dabunt stadia, duplatum dat tibi Leuca.
The Romans used a foot for their measure, as the Jews did a cubit.

Plato wrote in the door of his study, (...), Let no man ignorant of Geometry
enter in here.

Sir Henry Savill in his ninth Lecture upon Euclyde, says, Ars est omnium sine
controversia certissima, it is without controversy the most certain Art of all.

Tyc. Brahe in his Oration, De Disciplinis Mathematicis, shows, That diverse
Arts flow from Geometry, Astronomy, Optics; that of dialing, Geography,
Architecture, and the Mechanics,

Geometriae olim in Aegypto and Graecia plurimi certatim incubuerunt Artifices:
quorum singuli ad artis constitutionem aliquid contulerunt. Euclides Megarensis
uno complexus volumine, artis elementa continuo ordine and magna solertia ita
tradidit, ut a quovis mediocris ingenii acumine praedito non difficulter
percipi possent. Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Math. Quaestio de quadratura
circuli multa praeclara exercuit ingenia. Number quaestionis subtilitatem an
ingenii humani imbecillitatem, in causa esse dicemus, quod seculis tot fuere
desudatum in nodo solvendo, qui adhuc sit involutus. Vossius de Scient. Mathem.
lib. 1. cap. 16.
All with one consent ascribe the invention of Geometry to the Egyptians. For
when the limits of their possessions were confounded by reason of the annual
overflowing of Nilus, to restore these, the reason and way of measuring fields
was invented, and so Geometry may seem to have drawn its first original from
the Husbandmens measuring their grounds. Thales first brought Geometry out of
Egypt into Greece; Pythagoras amplified it. To whom many succeeded; Euclide
has brought the Art to that perfection, that he has cut off hope from all his
posterity of enlarging it.

The great difficulty among Geometricians is about the quadrature of a circle,
which some say, is not faisible.

III. Music. This is either Vocal or Instrumental; Some prefer the Vocal.
Therpander Thebanus Musicus celeberrimus primus de musica scripsit. Blancani.
Chronol. Clarorum Mathematicorum.

Musicae principis primum Pythagoras ad artem reduxit. Geneb. Chron. l. 2.

Hic primus dicitur ex malleorum ictibus vocum diversarum numeros, modes,
inflexionesque perpendendo, Musicam artem divina quadam industria confecisse.
Cytharam tradunt invenisse Orpheum, Fistulam Pan Arcadius primus inflavit.

xii.) Josephus optime dicet, lib. 7. Antiq. cap. x. and e nostris Basilius,
Chrysostomus, Hieronymus. Vossius. De viti is Sermonis. l. 4 c. 14.




Mercer on the 4th of Genesis ver. 21. says, Jubal was the inventer of
Instrumental Music.

Pythagoras Musicae theoricam ex Fabri malleis adinvenit. Blancani Chronologia
Clarorum Mathemat. Pythagoras invented the Art of Music from the Smiths
hammers.

One seeing another playing excellently upon the Lu^e, said, He thought his
soul was in his fingers.

Leur esprit s'ensuit au bout des doigts, says Du Bartas. 1. Sept.

Phythagoras, Aristoxenus, Nicomachus, Philolaus, Alypius, Ptolomaus handled
Music professedly, Boethius, Martianus Capella, and venerable Bede, and
Mersennus have written also of Music.

Astronomia dicitur (...), quia docet, qua lege moveantur ac reguntur astra.
Vossius de Selent. Math. c. 28. Admiranda prorsus and divina Astronomia,
subjecti nobilitate cunctis prior, apta and necessaria omnibus in quibus ulla
temporis ratio. Joan. a Wovver. De Polym. Tract. c. 25. In Astronomicis a
doctrina Sphaerica initium faciat, legende Institutiones Astronomicas Peuceri,
Metii, Maestlini, Crugeri, and Commentaris Clavii in Sphaeram. Job. de
Sacrobos^o. H^rt^nsii Differtat. de studio Mathemat. recte instituendo.
IV. Astronomy.

The word signifies a Doctrine of the Laws or Rules of the measure and motion
of the Stars.

The Subject of this Science is the Heavens with the Stars. Diodorus, Pliny and
others say, that Atlas was therefore thought to sustain heaven with his
shoulders, because he made a Sphere in which the whole heaven was represented.

It exceeds not only Arithmetique and Geometry, but all other Arts in this
kind. Nam and antiquitate and nobilitate ac cognitionis sublimitate prae
reliquis omnibus maximam sibi vendicat laudem. Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip.
Mathem.

Peter Ramus in proaem. Mathem. complained, because we have not now Astronomy
free from Hypotheses, and therefore easy, as the Egyptians and Babylonians
had. But says Gassendus (Praefat. In Tychonis Brahaei vitam) though some
Hypotheses be more simple, and so more easy then others, yet Astronomy cannot
consist without some.

Quod autem celeberrimus ille nostri aevi Philosophus Petrus Ramus existimarit,
sine Hypothesibus per Logicas rations Astronomiam constitui posse, caret
fundamento, etc. Tycho Brahe Epist. Astronom. lib. 1. Christoph. Rothman. Vide
plura ibid.

Thales Milesius was the first who studied the Stars, Gassendus (in the Preface
before-quoted, and their lives) mentions Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Theon, Pappus,
Quantum vero ad nos in astrorum scientia pervenit, Hipparchus Rhodius, primus
ejus parens censetur. Is enim fixarum loca diligenter observavit. Solisque and
Lunae cursus per plurimos subsequentes annos designavit. Ac in caeterorum
Planetarum toriusque Coeli observationibus diligentissimus suit. Hujus inventis
and considerationibus Ptolomaeus Alexandrinus cum suis collatis, totam artem in
certas Hypotheses, unaque in numeros redegit, and immortalem apud omnem
posteritatem hinc merito sibi peperit memoriam. Nostra vero aetate Nicolaus
Copernicus, quem alterum Ptolomaeum non immerito dixeris, admiranda ingenii
solertia Hypothesibus aliter constitutis coelestium motum, scientiam ita
restauravit, ut nemo ante ipsum exactius de syderum motibus sit philosophatus.
Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mathem. Ex his duobus artificibus Ptolomaeo and
Copernico, omnia illa quae nostra aetate, in astrorum revolutionibus, perspecta
and cognita habemus, constituta ac tradita sunt. Id. ibid.
Alphraganus, Alphonsus King of Castile, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Peurbachius,
and Regio-Montanus for famous Astronomers, Blanchinus, and Ptolomy, to which
Gassendus himself (the Professor of Astronomy now at Paris) may deservedly be
added.

V. Optics. This is a Greek word. It is called Perspective in Latin, Optices
dignitatem cognoscimus ex nobilitate organi ejus, quod sunt oculi, praecipium
cognitionis instrumentum: his enim omnem Philosophiam debemus. Etiam Opticae
dignitatem ostendit objecti praestantia; Cum luce and coloribus nihil sit
melius vel jucandius. Vossius de scientiis Mat. c. 24 Unam Opticen video solam
esse artem, quae caeterarum communis splendour dici possit, quae solis instar,
reliquis lucem impertiat, rerum in naturae majestate abditarum nubem dispellat.
Pena de usu optices. Vide Volat. Comment-Urban. l. 35.
a barbarous but significant word, Optica est ars been videndi. The Optics is
an Art of seeing well.

Light and color are visible by themselves, so it is said; Light indeed is,
but colors will not be visible in the dark.

We should examine and weigh the writings of the chief Astronomers by this
Lesbian Rule.

Luceus was the first Inventer of the metal-Mines, and hence arose the common
fable, that he also saw those things which were under the earth.

Pisanus was the Author of the common Perspective.

Alhazeus and Vitellio, and Pena on Euclide, and Peckam Archbishop of
Canterbury have done best on the Optics.

Galen skillful in the Optics as well as Physics, gives this demonstration,
why one and the same appears one to two eyes, Eadem est basis pyramidum sub
radiis ab oculo missis comprehensarum.

There are perfect demonstrations in the Optics; as why a hollow glass burns,
because the Sunbeams reflected are there gathered together; why a staff
appears broken in the water, because it is seen by lines refracted, through a
double medium of air and water.

CHAP. V. Of the Civil and Canon Law.
THere are three main things in the Civil-Law, The Pandects, the Code, and the
Novellae Constitutiones. Jurisconsultorum Commentarios non passim sed parce

1. The Pandects or Digests, containing Responsa prudentum, or the sayings of
Lawyers, to which the Decree of Gratian in the Canon Law composed out of the
sentences of the Councels and Fathers answers.

2. Codex, the Code, consisting only of the Decrees of the Emperors, to which
the five Books of the Decretals answer in the Canon Law, consisting of the
Constitutions only of the Pope of Rome. Male actum est cum rebus humanis, cum
ad Decreta accesserunt alae.

3. Novellae Constitutiones, viz. Imperatoriae, put out after the Code, to
which in the Canon Law the sixth of the Decretals, the Clementines and
Extravagants answer. See D. Duck of the Authority of the Civil-Law, l. 1. c. 4.

First, One should diligently read the elements of the Civil-Law, comprehended
in the four Books of Justinians Institutions, Calvin's Lexicon of the Law should
be perused. Then we may go on to the Pandects and Code, on which there are many
Commentaries. Cuiacius is an excellent Author.

It is called the Canon Law by reason of the matter, because it contains
Ecclesiastical Constitutions which they call Rules or Canons; and by reason of
the end, because it was collected and confirmed to that end, that it may
prescribe a Rule of Ecclesiastical Government.

The Canon Law contains

The Decree of Gratian for the most part collected out of the sentences of
Fathers, and Decrees of Councels.

The Decretals of Gregory the ninth.

The sixth of the Decretals of Boniface the eighth.

The Clementines and Extravagants collected out of the Epistles and replies of
the Popes.

Corpus Canonum a Gratiano Monacho consarcinatum ab Eugenio 111. Pontifice Romans
comprobatum and authoritate firmatum fuisse constat: qui ut in Academiis
doceretur propeque Tribunali in Judiciis reciperetur (ut and postea factitatum
est) praecepit. Gentil. Apol. c. 1.

Lancelots Institutions are commended for the Canon Law, as Minsinger on
Justinians Institutions for the Civil-Law.

In the Body of the Canon Law the Canons are sometimes diametrially opposite
one to the other.

Archidaconus, Panormitan, Innocentius, Rebuffus, were famous Canonists.

Of Philosophy.

It is either Natural or Moral, called Ethics. Natural Philosophy De mundo,
aut de iis quae sunt in mundo, quaerit. Pier Valor. Hierog. l. 38. c. 10.

Tully calls Philosophy in his Offices, Studium sapientiae; in his Tusculanes,
virtutis indagatricem, expultricemque vitiorum.

Socrates, Plato. Aristoteles tres viri constituendae Philosophiae sine dubio
divinitus excitati. Casaub. Praefat. ad Theophrast. Charact.
How many several sorts of Philosophers are mentioned? who were severed by their
distinct Schools, of Academicks, Peripatetiques, Stoics, Epicures,
Pythagoreans, too numerous to be rehearsed. Of all which, see Desiderii Jacotii
De Philosophorum doctrina libellum ex Cicerone. Philosophiae probe locatis
fundamentis, sine quibus de Galeni sententia, nemo medicus bonus dici potest,
sedulam medicis operam dedit. Melch. Adam. in vita Opsopaei.


Aristotle was the Prince of the Peripateticks, Zeno the chief of the Stoics,
Epicurus of the Epicureans, and Pythagoras of the Pythagoreans. Philosophiam
optime docebit Plato and Aristoteles, atque hujus Discipulus Theophrastus, tum
utrinque mixtus Plotinus. Erasm. De Ratione Studii.

As the Grecians for the title of wise men, called themselves lovers of
wisdom, that is, Philosophos, so also the Doctors of the Jews often were not
called wise men, but Scholars of wise men, that is, studious of wisdom.

Vbi desinit Philosophus ibi incipit Medicus, ubi desinit Medicus ibi incipit
Theologus.

Ethics or Moral Philosophy.

It is so called because it is conversant about the manners of men. Nominatur
Ethica a Graeca voce (...), id est, mos seu co^suetudo, quia versatur circa
hominum mores, quapropter and latin scientia moralis appellatur. Definiri
potest, Scientia practica humanarum actionum quatenus in illis honestas locum
habere potest. Walaei compendium Ethicae Aristotel.


The adequate object of it are humane actions, not considered any way, but as
honesty has place in them, and as they are capable of virtue.

Dr Ames has a Theological Disputation against it, and shows, that all
Aristotle's practical virtues are to be found in the Scripture.

Physic. The subject of it is man's body, the end health.

It is lawful, it was before the promulgation of the Law, Genesis 50.2.

The Poets brought in Apollo, as the chief god of Medicine, to whom they have
assigned Aesculapius for his son. Christ was a Physician both of soul and
body.

Omnibus est aliis Medicus praestantior unus. Is Homers verse. Physical
Institutions are a mellificium compounded out of the choicest flowers.

A long series of times has brought forth many famous Grecians, Physicians,
some Latins, and some Arabians.

Among the Grecians, Hippocrates and Galen excelled.

Dioscordes also was a good Physician.

Amongst the Latin Physicians Cornelius Celsus was the first.

Of late Fernelius and Sennertus.

, Rhazes, Averrhoes, Avenzoar, Mesue, Serapio, and Alsaharavius were chief. In
Plants there is much difficulty. Vide Voss. De vitiis Sermonis l. 1. c. 28.
Rondeletius, Matthiolus, Bellonius, Camerarius, Bauhinus, Spigelius, have done
well about Herbs.

Alexandria of old, and Padua of late, Amianus l. 22. pro omni experimento

is famous for the Profession of Physic.

Metaphysics. This is called by some Theolo. gia naturalis. Si quid tamen
laudis Metaphysicae sit tribuendum, illud erit, quod inanes quosdam
portentosarum distinctionum fumos invexerit, ad obscurandam simplicem

It is the highest part of all Philosophy from the subject of it, because it
treats De causa altissima.

Dr Ames has a Theological Disputation against Metaphysics, and says, it is
but an imaginary science.

Mr Baxter in his Reply to Mr Kendall, says he has above thirty Tracts of
Metaphysics by him, and seems to value Suarez, Schibler and Burgersdicius
before all the rest.

History.

Magistra vitae, Cic. 2do de Oratore. See of the Etymology of History and the

The end of it is double, profit and pleasure.

Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. Ferdinand King of Sicily, and
Alphonsus King of Spain, recovered their health by reading of History, the
first by reading Livy, the second by reading Q. Curtius.

Some have observed, that the being versed in Books of History makes men wiser
then in those of Policy, for that those furnish us with instances as well as
rules, and as it were personate the rule, and draw it out more into the full
lineaments. Mr Herles Moral prudence chapter 19.

History is either 1. Ecclesiastical, which handles Church matters, and is
for its Antiquity and Dignity to have the precedence. Vide Sixth. Senens. in
Praefat. ad Lectorem in Bibliotheca Sancta.

Or 2. Political, which handles civil matters, in Kingdoms, States or
Commonweals.

Just or perfect History is of three kinds, according to the nature of the
object which it propounds to represent; for it either represents a portion of
time, or some memorable Person, or some famous Act. The first we call
Chronicles or Annals; the second Lives; the third Relations. Of these
Chronicles seem to excel, for celebrity and name: Lives for profit and
examples: Relations for sincerity and verity. Sr Francis Bac. Advancem. of
Learn. l. 2. c. 7.

The History of Times is either universal or particular: This comprehends the
affairs of some Kingdom, Semper laudata fuit historia: quae singularia facta
a^que res gestas nobis ostendens, cujuscunque temporis ac secu^i exempla
suppeditat: Nec unius regionis cancellis constringitur; sed quam late terrarum
termini extenduntur, expatiatur. Verum enimvero cum varia sint historiarum
genera nullum huic praeferendum videtur, quo quis ea pretexit, quae multis,
longeque ac late dissitis regionibus perlustratis, maxim notatu digna scripto
consignans, lectores ne latum quidem unguem progressos per longinquas regiones
deducit. Hujusmodi historiae itineraria audiunt: quae bona fide contexta hac
prae reliquis praerogativa gaudent, quod majorem fidem mereantur, adeoque
lectorem certiorem reddant, utpote quae ex (...) res gestas, casus ac eventa
enarrent. Constantini L' Empereur Epist. Dedicat. Ad Itinnerarium D. Benjaminis.
or State, or Nation: That the affairs of the world.

Amongst Histories Itineraries have the pre-eminence, when one shall faithfully
relate the most memorable things he has observed by traveling into many and
strange Countries: And amongst Itineraries, that of R. Benjamin a Jew has been
very much esteemed by many, (says Constantine L' Empereur) because he did not
only travel over Europe and Africa, but professes that he entered into the
most inward and extreme regions of Asia, where he witnesses that he saw rare
things and yet unknown to our world: and therefore his little book abundantly
affords examples of very many things, so that it cannot but be read with
delight.

The first Law given to an Historian (says Tully de Oratore) is Nequid falsi
dicere audeat: deinde nequid very non audeat; ne qua suspicio gratiae sit in
scribendo, ne qua simultatis.

The composing of a History consists in things and words: for things he must
have respect to the order of time and the description of places, the manners,
lives, counsels, sayings, deeds and events of men; for words, the kind of
speech must not be large, yet adorned with a pure and famous brevity.

T. Livius in the opinion of all Learned men is the Prince of Latin History,
there are only two books of Salusts. A Catalogue of some of the chiefest
Historians.

Vossius has written an excellent book, De Historicio Graecis and Latinis.
There are several Writers joined together in two Volumes who have written de
Historia. Bodius Methodus Historica. Patritii de Historia Dialogi. Pontani de

Caesar's Commentaries contain famous things but done in a few years. Trogus
Pompeius who composed the Greek Histories and those of the whole world in
Latin, and in forty four Volumes has written the affairs of all ages, Kings,
Nations and people, is wholly lost, but that we have in Justin a short little
body as it were of the flowers of it. Suetonius, Tacitus, Q. Curtius, are good
Historians, and many later then them, Orosius, Paulus Diaconus, Eutropius, and
others of later time, yet Blondus, Antoninus, Sabellicus, Collenutius,
Machiavell, Aretinus, Platina, Carius, Simoneta, Capreolus, Merula, and those
yet later, Paulus Jovius, Sleiden, Guicchardine, the last being the best
Historian.

The best Greek Historians (although some of them be imperfect) are Herodotus,
Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Dion, Eusebius, and
others.

Chronology and Topography are the two eyes of History.

In Chronology. Epoch est certum atque illustre principium temporis, a quo
reliqui anni numerantur. Epoch autem dicitur a Graeco verbo (...), i. e.
retinere, and inhibere: quia est temporis quaedam retentio and inhibitio, qua
tanquam certo sixoque signo Historiae continentur. Apellantur etiam Era quae
vox ab Hispania primum inventa and usurpata est, qui temporum computationes ab
anno 16 Augusti Caesaris ordiri solebant. Incerti Auctoris epitome
Praecognitorum Historicorum.


The Epochae are to be observed.

The Epochae are two fold.

1. Ecclesiastical, which are noted in the Scriptures and Ecclesiastical
Histories; of which eleven as more famous are mentioned, from the beginning of
the world, the Flood, the building of the Tower of Babel, Abraham's
peregrination, the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, the year of
Sabbath, the year of Jubilee, Solomon's Temple, the Babylonish Captivity,
Daniels Seventies, the birth of Christ. The Christian Era, that is, the way of
numbering times from Christ being born, although it be most laudable, yet began
lately, and has not been long used in designing public or private affairs.
Helvic. in System. Chron.

2. Political, which are observed in profane Histories, and are used in civil
affairs.

Of these some most famous are,

1. Of the Olympiads: which is of the Grecians. Olympias est spacium quinque
annorum a Latinis Lustrum dictum, in the beginning of the fifth year the
Olympian games were wont to be celebrated, with great concourse of all Greece,
so called from Olympia a City in Thessaly, in which those sports were exercised.

This is the noblest computation of time among the Heathens.

2. Epoch urbis conditae, id est, Romae.

3. Est C. Julii Caesaris, from whence the Roman Emperors are numbered.

Era, pro quo and Era, dicitur pro Epoch, sive supputationis initio. In
Gothicarum, ac Hispanicarum rerum scriptoribus, plurimisque conciliis, est
crebrum, atque ab eo tempore inchoat, quo Hispani, jussu Augusti recepore
formam anni Iuliani; quod factum XXXVIII. annis ante natum Iesum Christum ex

Bl^ncani Chronol. Mathem.
Vossius de vitiis Sermonis, l. 3. c. 1.

2. Topography, the description of some certain place.

Of Poetry.

Vide Fulleri Miscel. Sac. l. 1. c. 20. and Spec. Arab. Johan. Fabric. p. 170.
ad 178. Eras. Epist. l. 9. Epist. 120.
It is referred to the imagination, and is a kind of Learning in words
restrained; in matter loose.

It is an art of deceit, which measures expressions, not by the truth of the
subject, but by the strength of imagination working upon it.

It principally serves for venting extraordinary affections.

Poetry is the quintessence or rather the luxury of Learning.

The Original of this Art is very ancient, and (as Eusebius. l. 2. de praeparat.
Evang.) first flourished with the most ancient Hebrews, who were long before
the Poets of the Grecians. Moses made an exhameter Verse, wherein he gave
thanks to God for their deliverance at the red Sea. David composed many Hymns.
Quid Deutoronomii and Esaiae cantico palchrius? Quid Solomone gravius? Quid
perfectius Job? quae omnia hexametris and pentametris versibus apud suos
composita decurrunt, Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 8. Orpheus (says
Porphyrius) first illustrated this Art, then Homer and Hesiod.

It is taken in a double sense, as it respects words, and so it is a kind of
character of speech; for verse is a kind of style and form of elocution, and
pertains not to matter; for a true narration may be composed in verse; and a
feigned in Prose.

Or as it respects matter, so it is imitation of History at pleasure.

Sir Frau. Bac. Advanc. of Learn. l. 2. c. 13. Poetica ars multis mehercle de
causis, reliquas antecellit ^^seiplinas, vel quia homines nullam pene artem
assequi possunt, nisi in illam diu incubuerint, ut quod scientias fere, ut
^trabo in primo Geographiae adversus Eratosthenem pulchre demonstrat, in se
continet omnes: vel demum quod ex omnibus artibus, quae ab humani excellentia
proficiscuntur, sola poetica divino furore peroipitur. Na poetae furore afflari
res omni admiratione and stupore dignas canunt, tuncque very vates sunt, cum
insaniunt. Polyd. Verg. de Rer. Inv. l. 1. c. 8.
It is either Narrative, or Representative, or Allusive.

Narrative is a mere imitation of History, but that often it extols matters
above belief.

Dramaticall or Representative, is, as it were, a visible History, it sets out
the Image of things, as if they were present: History, as if they were past.

Parabolicall or Allusive is History with the Type, which brings down the
Images of the understanding to the objects of sense.

Poets were the first Priests, Prophets, Legislators and Politicians, the first
Philosophers, Astronomers, Historiographers, Orators and Musicians in the world.
Because neither our senses are moved with extraordinary effects of Gods power,
nor our minds bent to observe the ways of his wisdom, so as we might be
stricken with true admiration of them, we have fewer good sacred Poems, then of
any other kind. But as the Ancients chief learning did consist of Poetry, so
the excellency of their Poetry was chiefly seen in the proper and native
subject of this faculty, that is, in matters of sacred use or observation.
Whence the title of Vates did descend to secular or profane Poets, which
retained the number and manner of speech used by the former. The Book of
Psalms, Job, and the Songs of Moses, are the only pattern of true Poesy. Dr
Jacksons Comment upon the Apost. Creed, Vol. 1. c. 14.

Metri origo a Deo optimo maximo est; qui hunc terrar^m orbem, and omnia ab eo
contenta, certa ratione quasi metro disposuit: harmoniam enim, ut Pythagoras
docuit, in Caelestibus terrenisque rebus nemo hercle esse dubitat. Nam quo
pacto mundus consisterer, nisi certa ratione and numeris praesinitis ageretur?
Omnia quoque instrument^ quibus utimur, mensura quadam, id est, metro siunt.
Quod si hoc in caeteris rebus accidit, quanto magis in oratione, quae cunctas
complectitur? Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 1. c. 9. Mirus gentium
consensus in poescos rhythmicae, itan vocant, amore. Nam omnes fere populi
Europae, Asiae, Africae, ab aliquot retro seculis non alios praeter ittos
versus norunt. Casaub. ad Pers. Sat. 1.
The Greek and Latin Poesy was by verse numerous and metricall, running upon
pleasant feet, sometimes swift, sometime slow, (their words very aptly serving
for that purpose) but without any time or tunable concord in the end of their
verses, as we and all other Nations now use. But the Hebrews and Chaldees, who
were more ancient then the Greeks, did not only use a metricall Poesy, but
also with the same a manner of time, as has been of late observed by Learned
men. Our manner of vulgar Poesy is more ancient then the artificial of the
Greeks and Latins, ours coming by instinct of nature, which was before Art and
observation, and used by the wild and savage people, who were before all
Science or Civility.

In the time of Charlemaine and many years after him the Latin Poets wrote in
time.

The School of Salerne dedicated their book of Medicinal rules unto our King
of England, beginning thus, Anglorum Regi scribit schola tota Salerni
Si vis incolumem, si vis te reddere sanum
Curas toll graves, irasci creed prophanum
Nec retine ventrem, nec stringas fortiter anum.


All the rest go on in the same way, well to the purpose of their Art.

One wrote these verses against the whole rabble of Monks, O Monachi vestri
stomachi sunt amphora Bacchi,
Vos estis Deus est testis turpissima pestis.


Hugobald the Monk made a large Poem to the honor of Carolus Calvus, every
word beginning with C, which was the first letter of the Kings name thus,
Carmina Clarisonae Caluis Cantate Camenae.

There were 1. Heroic Poets, such as wrote long Histories of the noble acts of
Kings and great Princes, and the great matters of peace and war, Metrorum
plura sunt genera, quae auctore Servio, vel a rebus quae describuntur, nomina
accepere, ut heroicum, quod hexametrum: licet Moses primus usurpaverit, tamen
quia Homerus, and caeteri qui deinceps secuti sunt, heroum res gestas hoc
carmine scriptitarunt, heroicum nominatum est. Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum,
l. 1. c 9. Vide plura ibid.
whereof Homer was chief and most ancient among the Greeks, Virgil among the
Latins

2. Lyrique Poets; quod eorum fere carmina ad sonum Cithara recitarentur. They
delighted to write songs of pleasure, of which sort was Pindar, Anacreon and
Callimachus, with others among the Greeks: Horace and Catullus among the
Latins.

3. Elegiack, who wrote in a certain pitious verse called Elegy; such among the
Latins were Ovid, Tibullus, and Propertius.

4. There were Comicall Poets who wrote Enterludes to recreate the people with
matters of disport, of whom among the Greeks, Menander and Aristophanes were
most excellent; with the Latins, Terence and Plautus, and also Tragical, Vide
Polyd. Vergil. De Invent. Rerum l. 1. c. 10, and 11. In Tragaedia praecipue
spectandi affectus, and quidem fere acriores illi. In Comaedia cum primis
observandum est decorum, and vitae communis imitatio, assectus sint mitiores,
and jucundi magis quam acres. Eras. de Ratione Studii. In Epigrammatis arguta
brevitas laudatur. Id. ibid.
who set forth the doleful falls of unfortunate and afflicted Princes, such
were Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles with the Greeks; Seneca among the
Latins. Satyricall, who taxed the vices of the people in bitter speeches, such
were Lucilius, Juvenall and Persius among the Latins. Others were given wholly
to scoffing at undecent things, and in short Poems uttered pretty merry
conceits, and these were called Epigrammatists, as Martial.

Poets are drawn with a desire of glory, and are greedy of praise.

Nec petitur sacris nisi tantum fama Poetis. There are Deliciae Poetarum, where
the famous Italian, French, German and Scotch Poets are mentioned. There are
also Flores Poetarum, at the end of which is a defense of the Poets. Horace
has written de Art Poetica, and Vossius de Poetis Graecis and Latinis, and
Sir Philip Sidnie in English of Poetry.


Chytraeus has this Epigram, In tres Petros Poetas.
Carmine quid possint Itali, and cum Teutone Galli,
Scire cupis ternos aspice quaeso Petros
Italia Angelium, Ronsardum Gallia, suave
Lorichii ingenium Teutonis ora tulit.


Of Painting.

Painting is silent Poetry, and Poetry a speaking Picture.

Pictura muta poesis, poesis loquens pictut^ Aristot. Rhet. l. 3. Scripturam
picturam esse arguunt verba Graeca and Latina, quia (...) tam picturam
significat quam scripturam, and literae a lino, unde lineae. Bibliander de
Ratione communi omnium Linguarum, c. 6. Pictura adeo magno in honor apud
veteres homines suit, ut cum caeteros ferme omnes artifaces fabros nuncupatent,
solum pictorem huic nuncupationi eximerent, ut innuit Leo Baptista Albertus l.
11. de Pictura. Qui etiam addit omnium atrium florem illam esse, nec sane
immerito mea sententia, quippe quae venustatem colorum, and lucis ignem una
exprimat, affectus omnes representet, defunctorum memoriae consular, caeli
conversiones, teriae vices, diel and noctis parts, Arts acumina apicesque,
Divinitatem ipsam (quantum licet assequi cogitatione) subjiciat penicillo. Et
hinc factum est, ut Graeci politissimi hominum caverent edicto ne servi
pingerent, quod nobilissimam artem servili manu and ingenio pollui
pertimescerent. Neque defuerunt viri accurati and eloquences, qui Historiam
pictorum pertexerent, veluti Aristodemus Car, test Philostrato in Iconibus,
and Polemon apud Athenaeum lib. 11. Pignor. Symb. Epist. Ep. 42. Vide plura
ibid.
Of the first Inventer of it, See Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 2. c. 24.

Zeuxis, Appelles, Lysippus, Parrhasius, Praxiteles, Phidias, were famous
Painters.

Two Artificers contended for the mastery in their Art and faculty, the Zeuxis.
first drawing Grapes so lively that he couzened the birds, the Parrhasius.
other a Vail so exquisitely that he couzened the Artificer himself.

Of Navigation.

This Art is much perfected since Salomons time.

Prima dedit nautis usum magnetis Amalphis. John Tapp has written of the Art
of Navigation: and Sr Thomas Rives has written Historiam Navalem in two parts.

The virtue of the Loadstone is certainly wonderful, unknown to Aristotle and
Pliny, Usus magnetis and nauticae acus eo tactae, atque pixidis Magneti vim
inesse ut acum ipso ractam, ad polum Articum dirigat, ignorum omnino priscis
omnibus. Crak. log. l. 4. c. 9. Tanta est illius vis, ut non immerito a magnis
viribus nomen habeat magnetis, quare etiam Herculeus a multis appellatur, etsi
a Magnete quodam illius inventore sic appeliatum putet Plinim, a vero regione
nomen ejus deducat Lucretius. A ferro autem quod domat, and sibi obsequens
facit, sideritis merito vocatur. Id. ib.
and all the Ancients, which virtue thus now being known and understood,
Navigation through and about the whole world was made easy and happy.

Sir Francis Bacon in his first book of the Advancement of Learning, lib. 1.
cap. 4. says, The Sciences which hold more of the Fancy and of Belief, then of
Reason and Demonstration, are chiefly three, Astrology, natural Magic and
Alchimy.

I. For Astrology.

Nam veceres omnes, ut hoc obit^r moneam tyrones, Astronomia and Astrologia
uruntur ut Synonimis. Plato fere Astronomiae vocabolo utitur, Aristoteles
Astrologiae, per archaismum prisco and obsoleto more, ut vult Simplicius ad
libros de caelo. Savil. lect. 2d^ in Euclid.
Though the Ancients generally confounded Astronomy and Astrology, yet they are
to be distinguished, as the very Greek words show.

Mr Burgess his Treatise of Sin. Sermon. 14.
The Scripture, Psalm. 19. commending the Sun and the Starry Heavens for all
its proper uses and ends that we should make of them, says not the least word
of Judicial Astrology, or foretelling future events in the world by them:
whereas if that were true which is said, that God by the Heavens as by a Book,
has revealed what he would do, it would have commended the study of the
Heavens for this end to all; Insectatur hoc loco Propheta Iesaias ex ore Dei,
omnes Divinos, Ariolos, Aru^pices, Astrologos, angures, Genethli^cos,
Mathematicos, Planetarios, Pythones, denique omnes qui artem futura and abdita
divinandi profitentur, sicut Orientales solebant. Omnibus enim iis atque aliis
multis nominibus fuerunt hujusce divinatores, variis temporibus appellati: olim
Chaldaei and Orientales, and Genetbliaci: Augustini temporibus, Mathematici and
Planeturii: nunc passim Astrologi vocantur and Necromantici. Zanch. de
Divinatione in 6. v. c. 2. Jes. Vide Dilher. Disputat. Acad. Tom. 1. p. 152. in
Jer. 10.2. and Cl. Gatak. nostrum in eundem textum. and libellos ejus duos, in
defensione ejusdem textus, contra Lillum. and Fulleri Miscel. Sac. l. 1. and
Zanch. de Divinat. c. 16. Rogas quod de Astrologia judiciaria; sentiam, de qua
jampridem magna est inter doctos and pios homines controversia, quibusdam nihil
prorsus ei tribuentibus: quibusdam vero non secus illi tribuentibus omnis, quam
si syderibus esset omnis in universum mundum attributa potestas: aliis denique
mediam viam seqautis, ita viz. ut ei neque adimantur omnia, neque tribuantur:
quorum sententiam amplecti me profiteor, sed ita ut in ipsius rei explicatione
nonnihil a nonnullis dissentiam. Bez Epist. 29.
for if God have manifested his will by it, then certainly he would have
commanded us to search for it there, as he does command us to find out his
will in the Scripture. But the Scripture is so far from commending such a
study, that it expressly forbids it as a grievous sin, Deuteronomy. 18.10, 14. Isa.
2.6. and 41.23. and 44.25. and 47.12. Jer. 10.2. Eccles. 10.14. And that
Judicial Astrology is a vanity, appears by this reason; They undertake to
foretell contingencies for the most part, from the position of the seven
Planets: Now there being so vast a number of fixed Stars, which have influence
in earthly things in some proportion as well as the Planets, how is it possible
that they should foretell any certain truth?

One in Basil by his calculation noted a certain day which he mistrusted
should be fatal unto him, by some thing which should at that time befall him,
Whereupon he determined with himself all that day to keep him sure and safe
within his chamber, where he reaching up his hand to take down a Book, Foxes
Act. and Monum.
the Book falling down upon his head gave him his deaths wound, and shortly
after he died upon the same.

Tycho Brahe in his Oration de Disciplinis Mathematics, Praedictiones
Astrologicae non solum a vulgo, quod omnes Arts aequali odio prosequitur: sed
a quibusdam etiam eruditis hominibus in dubium vocantur: quamvis sola Artis
ignorantia eos excusare possit. Pergunt enim Arti contradicere, cujus principia
summis labris non degustarunt, and cum in aliqua cognitione excellunt, de
omnibus aliis rebut quamvis ab ea cognitione long dissitis, sibi judicium
arrogant. Solus Picus Mirandula Astrologiae gnarus eam ex propriis
Apotelesmatis convellere aggressus est. Sed hujus objectionibus Lucius
Bellonius erudito scripto jamdudum respondit. Et ipse Picas mortuus anno
aetatis 33, quem tres Astrologi illi fatalem ex directione ascendentia ad
corpus martis praedixerant, Astrorum efficaciam, quam infringere voluit, nimis
cerro eventu, proprio interitu comprobarit. Tych. Brah. Orat. de Discipl. Mathem
does plead somewhat for Astrology.

But Gassendus de Doctrina Epicuri, has a Diatribe against Judicial
Astrology, and calls it ridiculous.

Sixtus ab Hemminga wrote a Book against those which profess Astrology, which
he entitled, Astrologiae ratione and experientia refutatae liber. He shows
there, that all the promises which Astronomers make of future events are vain,
and that evidently in the genitures of thirty famous persons, which Suffridus
Petrus de Scriptoribus Frisiae reckons up.

Another kind of Divination is Physiognomy.

If I say a sanguineous man is prone to lust, that is a true judgment, Ipsa
nominis notatio significat Philosophis scientiam illam, qua vel ex totius
corporis, vel alterius partis corporis aspectu, de hominis natura and ingenio
judicamus. Zanch. de Divinat. per sorts.
this is properly Physiognomy, but if thou say, he is actually lustful,
that is a rash judgment, for by reason or the grace of God he may restrain
that, as the story of Socrates is known.

A certain kind of Physiognomy is called Chiromancy or Palmestry, which is a
divination by inspection of the lines in the hand, Chiromantia quid sit, ipsius
nominis notatio indicat: Divinatio est, quae fit ex manuum inspectione. In S.
literis, he verbum quidem ullum de Chiromantia habemus. Dico ex manuum
inspectione vere and certe cognosci posse cum corporis constitutionem, tu^t
multorum affectuum propensionem. Quoniam signa quae sunt in manu, ut illa
lineamenta, inter quae numeratur and linea vicalis ab Aristotele and medicis,
connexionem quandam certam and necessariam habent cum corporis constitutione,
and affectum propensione. Actuales vero mores, aut futuras contingentes
actiones as dignitates, vere ac cerro praesentir^ ^c praedici posse ex manuum
inspectione, inficior. Quoniam lineaments manus seu vitae, nullam certam aut
necessariam cum actualibus moribus, aut futuris actionibus connexionem habent.
Zanch. de Divinat.
-- Frontemque manemque praebebit vati.

Juv. Sat. 1.

Aristotle in his singular book of Physiognomy has made no mention of
Chiromancy, yet I believe the Egyptians, who were addicted to those abstruse
and mystical sciences had a knowledge therein, to which those vagabond and
counterfeit Egyptians did after pretend, and perhaps retained a few corrupted
principles, which sometimes might verify their prognostics. Dr Brown. Religio
Medici.

See of them Camerar. Histor. Meditat. l. 1. c. 17.

II. Of Natural Magic.

Magicarum artium usum inde coepisse inter homines existimo, quod Diabolus
secutus exemplum consuetudinis and colloquiorum Dei, cum sanctis Patribus,
eodem modo alias alia specie sese exhibuit hominibus, ut hujus imitationis and
colloquiorum occasion se facilius insinuaret, and a verbo Dei aversos animos,
ad petendas a se, and expectandas declarationes, admonitiones, patefactiones,
and alia hujus generis assuefaceret. Gasp. Peuc. De Divinat-generibus, p. 309.
Magi, vox, ut multis videtur Persica, quae licet jam infamis, primo tamen
honori fuit, and vel Philosophum, vel ut vult Appuleius sacerdotem
significabat. Ouzel. animadvers. ad Minut. Felic octav. Vide Dilher. Disp.
Acad. Tom. 2. p. 184.
Some distinguish between Natural, Artificial and Diabolical, though others
dislike them all.

Zoroaster is said first to invent this Art of Magic. Vide Aug. De Civ. Dei.
l. 21. c. 14. and Polyd. Verg. De Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 22.

Magic flourished especially among the Persians.

One says, Magia est ars impetrandi a Diabolo quicquid ipsi praescripseris.
Magic is an Art of obtaining of the Devil whatsoever thou shall command him.
As Christianity is an Art of obtaining from God what is profitable, so Magic
is an Art of obtaining from the Devil what thou shall command him. For the
Devil is the Author and worker of those things which the Magicians work; though
one says, The Art is but Naturalis Philosophiae absoluta consummatio, the
absolute perfection of natural Philosophy.

Pliny speaks of Moses his Miracles, though he do ill in calling him a
Magician, for, 1. what likeness is there between the illusions of a Magician,
which vanish away in the twinkling of an eye, and the leading of a mighty great
Nation through the Sea, Jannes and Jambres Magicians resisted Moses, 2 Timothy 3.8.
and which is more, the maintaining of them from hunger and thirst so long a
time. There is no Law in the world does so expressly forbid Magic as does the
Law of Moses, as if the Law would thereby purposely prevent this slander.

Benno the Cardinal in the life of Hildebrand relates, that five Popes
Sylvester the 3d, Diabolicis artibus Sylvester tertius Pontifex evasit. De quo
Stellu devitis Pont. in Sylv. III. Platina aliique. Romanus Pontifex, Diabolo
adjuvante, constitutus, bac tamen lege; ut post obitum, totus illius, and in
anima, and in corpore, esset. Gomarus Disp. 21. De Antichrist^.
Benedictus the 9th, John the 20. and 21, Gregory the 7th, did wholly give
themselves to the Devil that they might be Popes.

He has a notable story there of Hildebrand, about his carring a book of
Necromancy still with him.

Libels, or Libri famosi are to be forbidden, blasphemous books to be abolisht,
but Magical books are to be burnt, Act. 19.19.

yet this right is due to it, that it may truly be compared to the Husbandman,
whereof Aesop makes the Fable, That when he died, told his sons he had left
unto them a great mass of gold buried under ground in his vineyard, but did
not remember the particular place where it was hidden; Who when they had with
spades turned up all the vineyard, they found no gold; but by reason of their
stirring and digging the mold about the roots of their Vines, they had a great
vintage the year following: so the painful search and stir of Alchymists to
make gold, has brought to light a great number of good and fruitful
experiments, as well for the disclosing of nature, as the use of man's life.

The Alchymists or Chymicks too much extol their spirits.

Isaac Holland, and Theophrastus Paracelsus.

The Cabbalisticall Art is also vain, though magnified too much in these days.

The Jews hold, that Moses received a double Law from God in the Mount, one in
writing, or delivered in writing, the other by mouth, or delivered by mouth.
This last (say they) was successively delivered by Moses to posterity, first to
Joshua, by him to the Elders, and by them to the first Prophets, and then to
the last Prophets, amongst whom the last of all were Zachary, Haggai, Malachi,
these delivered it to the men of the great Synagogue, which were Ezra with his
company, who restored the Law to its ancient purity, from whom the wise men
following received it in succeeding generations, and this double Exposition
which the Jews glory in is yet found among their wise men, they name the Cabala.

Joannes Picus de Mirandula first amongst the Latins made mention of this
Cabal of the Hebrews.

Because there are six Alephs in the first verse of the first Chapter of
Genesis, and Aleph signifies a thousand, therefore they say the world shall
last six thousand years.

Some learned men (as Chamier, and others) likewise tax School Divinity.

Frobenius, he was Erasmus his faithful Printer.

Daniel Bombergus who deserves special praise for his care and diligence in
setting forth the Bible with the Chaldee Paraphrase, Rabins Commentaries, and
the Masora, besides many other Hebrew books. R. Gedaliah in his Shalsheleth
does speak honorably of him in this respect.

Some Printers are to be blamed, who for lucre sake are ready to print any book
though never so corrupt and pernicious.

I have heard that George Bishop the Printer in London would not sell any
Popish Books either to Papists or any that were like to be seduced by them.

CHAP. VI. Of the Languages.
COnstat Graecos and Latinos peregrinae linguae voces, dum suae lingua decero,
and compositioni student, prodigiose corrupisse. Leland. Comment. in Cigu. Cant.

Languages do often much change in process of time. The French, Spanish and
Italian, coming from the Latin are much fallen from the purity of the Latin
tongue. None of the French will now understand the Laws of England published by
William the Conqueror in the Norman without an Interpreter.

Languages differ much in common names, but not in proper; all Languages say
almost in the same manner, Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, Socrates, Plato,
Caesar, C. Caro, Carolus, and in the like.

The Confusion of Languages was brought in at the building of the Tower of
Babel, Peccati poena est tot esse linguas, Lud. Viv. de Trad. Discip. l. 3.
as Moses the Hebrew Prophet in the 11th Chapter of Genesis, and Josephus the
Hebrew Historian in the 4th Chapter of his first book of Jewish Antiq.
evidently demonstrate.

The punishment of strange Languages was a heavy punishment, next to our
casting out of Paradise, and the Flood. Mr Wheat. Protot. chapter 7.

The holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles in the shape of tongues. Quid autem
lingua dissecta aliud (says one) quam variarum linguarum cognitionem
portenderunt?

Bibliander says, There are seventy seven Languages commonly reckoned, De
ratione communi omnium Linguarum, c. 1.

The Hebrew Language was the first and most ancient, Varia linguarum genera and
permulta quidem, sive septuaginta duo, sive plura vel pauciora jam inde ab
aedificatione Turris extitisse pro comperto habetur. Imm^ ut alii volunt ex
illa aedificatione seu potius insania, tanta hominum sermonis varietas,
linguarumque confusio innata est, ut quot orbis regiones sunt tot hominum
linguae sint: prius enim universa terra, test Moyse, labii unius erat. Ang.
Roch. De Append. Bib. Vatic. de Dialect.
and the only Language before the building of the Tower of Babel.

Ansten says, It is better to be in the company of a known dog, then in a man's
society whose speech is unknown to us. Linguarum diversitas hominem alienat ab
homin^, nam si duo sibimet invicem siant obviam, neque praeterite, sed simul
esse aliqua necessitate cogantur, quorum neuter norit linguam alterius,
facilius sibi animalia muta etiam diversi generis, quam illi cum sint homines
ambo sociantur, and quando enim quae sentiunt inter se communicate non possunt,
propter solam linguarum diversitatem nihil prodest ad consociandos homines
tanta similitudo naturae: Ita ut libentius homo sit cum cane suo quam cum
homine alieno. August. l. 19. De civit. Dei, c. 7.


The Hebrew tongue kept its purity, and remained uncorrupted, though other
tongues were added to it, and derived from it.

It is reported of Mithridates, that he spoke two and twenty Languages.

Benedictus Arias Montanus in his Preface to the King of Spains Bible,
professes that he understood ten Languages.

Godesohalcus Praetorius, a man of great wit and vast memory, and famous in all
kind of Learning, once a singular ornament of the University of Francford in
Germany, understood fourteen Tongues, says Neander in the first part of his
Geography.

Postell shows, that he was skillful in fifteen Languages.

Schindler and De Dieu were Polyglottists.

Joseph Scaliger and our Bishop Andrews had also knowledge in several
Languages.

Theodorus Bibliander De Ratione Communi omnium Linguarum, cap. 1. says thus
of himself, Equidem ut de uberiori aliqua perfusione divini spiritus gloriari
non possum nec debeo, ita beneficia Christi servatoris minime vel modestum, vel
religiosum est dissimulare. Fateorque me non tam labor and diligentia and
ingenii quodam acumine singulari, quam ex merito and gratia, and dono principis
nostri opt. max. Jesu Christi consecutum esse facultatem aliquam scribendi and

The common use of all Languages is twofold: Vide Drus. ad difficil. loc.

One, That others may discover their mind to us.

Another, That we likewise may reveal our mind to them.

As the confusion of tongues at Babel had caused the casting off of the
Gentiles, by severing them from the participation of the true Religion (which
was only professed and known in the Hebrew tongue) so was the gift of tongues
to be a needful means to bring them into Religion again; when every one may
hear of the things of God in his own Language.

The Languages may be divided into Oriental and Occidental:

1. Oriental; Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriack, Arabic, Aethiopick,
Persian, Armenian, Coptick.

2. Occidental; Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, German, English, and
Sclavonick, which is spoken very generally.

The Oriental tongues are written and read from the right hand to the left,
except the Aethiopick and Armenian.

The Grecians at first did write forward and backward, whence that phrase,
Literas exarare and lineae, are called versus, and thence that was a most
profitable and grave Decree of the Council of Vienna, Vide Bocharti Geog. sac.
celebrated under Clement the 5th, That there should be in Universities public
professors of the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabic tongues, which should teach
them, and translate books out of them into Latin for the propagation of the
Faith, and more easy conversion of the Infidels.

Sigismundus Gelenius has written L^^ticum Symphonum.

Quo quatnor Linguarum Europae familiarium, Gracae scilicet, Latinae,
Germanica, ac Sclavinicae concordia judicatur.

Bibliander De ratione communi omnium linguarum, lays down an easy method of
learning a Language, Qui enim dictiunculas principales, and themata singulis
diebus discat, and aliquid tribuat regulis derivandi, flectendi, and
componendi, utque ordinem and constructionis leges cognoscat, centesimo die per
otium linguam perdidicit. He says there, That there are a thousand original
words of the Latin tongue, and themata bis mill linguae Hebraeae, two
thousand roots of the Hebrew tongue.

There are three principal or learned Languages, the Hebrew, Greek and Latin.

1. Of the Hebrew
Of Languages, the Hebrew as it is the first and most ancient of all, so it
alone seems to be pure and sincere, Nostri etiam seculi omnes propemodum docti,
primas linguae Hebraeae deferunt, excepto unico Goropio Becano, qui Belgicam
suam principem antiquitate asserere, sed frustra and admodum languide,
allaborat. Crinesio Discursus de confusione Linguarum, cap. 1, Vide plura ibid.
Ut Biblia^d. de Ratione Communi omnium linguarum, cap. 5. It is most certain
that the Hebrew langage from the beginning of the world to this present, never
received any alteration or corruption in its dialect or manner of speech. See
Jerome in his Preface to the Prophet Jeremiah, in his last Epistle to Paulus
Urbicus, and in his Exposition on the third Chapter of Zephany. Re^chlin in his
Book of the Jews Cabala. Augustinus Steuchus in his Annotations on the 37
Chapter of Genesis, and diverse others quoted by Duret, Histoire Des Langues De
cest univers.
all the rest almost are mixed: for there is none of them which has not certain
words derived and corrupted from the Hebrew. So the Latins have not only
borrowed many words of Art from the Grecians, but also of things which they
found in their books. So the Latin tongue was corrupted by the Goths in
Italy, France and Spain.

Some think that the English Language is most mixed and corrupt of all. Munster
in the second Book of his universal Cosmography, says, The English tongue is
compounded of many Languages. In times past (he says) it was pure Germane, as
one may know by Beda, who was born in England.

Hac Hebraica sive Judaica lingua quae and sacra dicitur, Vetus Testamentum
conscriptum fuit. Profecto Liber fere solus purus Hebraicus habetur, ut eruditi
affirmant: alii enim iisdem Characteribus Conscripti vel Chaldaici sunt, vel
alias dialectos and glossas habent admixtas. Ang. Roch. Append. Bib. Vat. de
dialectis.
The Mysteries of God, and our salvation were delivered by God, and received by
the holy Fathers and Prophets in the Hebrew tongue.

Textus biblieus unus Hebraismi puri and antiqui thesaurus nobis superest.
Pocock. Not. Miscel. in Por^am Mosis. c. 3.
The Hebrew tongue excels all others in dignity, pleasure, profit and necessity.
The antiquity of it demonstrates its dignity, the simplicity and grace of it
its pleasure. It is the fountain of all other Languages, of the Indian,
Persian, Babylonian, Armenian, Syriack, Arabic, the Egyptian, Aethiopick, and
therefore profitable. Beckman shows, that many Greek words are derived from it.
Nulla enim est lingua, quae non ab Hebraica derivata quaedam and corrupta

By it we are instructed in the knowledge of God and the Church, and our
selves, therefore it is very necessary.

The Punique tongue was the Canaanitish or old Hebrew See Brerewoods Enquiries,
chapter 7.
Language, that which was vulgarly spoken among the Jews before the Captivity.

Amongst Christians for more then a thousand years from Christ, none scarce did
adorn the Hebrew Language unless very few. The Jews were in such hatred, that
their very Language was vilified. Origin of Alexandria learned it of a Jew
called Hill, not without trouble, and the public upbraiding of Celsus. Jerome
also of Stridona a Monk and Presbyter, learned this Language at Bethlehem,
especially in the night time of a Jew, fearing his Countrymen, whose name was
Barhanina, whence Ruffinus becoming his enemy objected to him, that leaving
Christ he followed Barabbas, He neglecting that calumny went on stoutly, and
taught many religious Virgins this Language, that they might sing Hebrew
Psalms. After Jerome, who flourished in the year of Christ 385. followed John
Damascene, who lived in the year of Christ, 730. Nicholas Lyra was converted
from Judaism in the year of Christ, 320. Afterward Paulus Burgensis was
converted from Judaism. And this was the lot of that holy Language even unto
the year of Christ 1440. when Printing was invented, and the studies of
Languages and Learning began to flourish. Here among the Christian restorers of
the holy tongue Reuclin was the first. He learned the Greek tongue of Greek
exiles (amongst whom was Chalcondylas) and the Hebrew of the Jews, and he
illustrated both. The ice being broken by him, Hebrew Bibles were printed first
at Pisauna, after at Venice, and in Italy. Faelix Pratensis, Daniel Bombergus
his master in the holy tongue, the Author and Moderator of his famous printing
in the Hebrew, much adorned this Language, by publishing Hebrew Bibles, which
are called Veneta and Bombergiana.

Augustinus Justinianus Nebriensis Episcopus put forth Psalterium octaplum.

Petrus Galatinus flourished in Spain, also Franciscus Ximenes Archbishop of
Toledo, and Cardinal, who procured the Edition of Opus Complutense, and
Benedictus Arias Montanus Hispalensis, who being helped together with his
Colleagues by the munificence of Philip the second King of Spain, promoted that
kingly work, the Spanish and Plantine Bible.

In France Sanctes Pagninus Lucensis professed this tongue, The Author of the
Treasury of the Hebrew tongue, Franciscus Vatablus, which encouraged and
furthered Robert Stevens in printing so elegantly the Hebrew Bible at the
charge of Francis the first King of France. John Mercer who together with
Bonaventure Cornelius Bertram and Antonius Cevallerius enriched Pagnines
Treasury with Annotations.

To these may be added William Postell and Nicholas Clenard, who traveled far
out of their love to the Hebrew and Oriental tongues.

In Germany after Capnio or Reuchlin, Conrad^s Pelican, Sebastian Munster,
John Oecolampadius, Luther, Aurogallus, Forster, Zigler, John Albert
Widmanstadius, Andraeas Masius, Paulus Fagius, John Avenarius, John Drusius,
Waser, John Buxtorf the Father and Son, George Cruciger, and others bestowed
their pains to good purpose in this Language.

Of later time Edward Livelie in Cambridge.

Hugh Broughton and Nicholas Fuller did also excel in that Language.

See Arias Mon^anus his Preface to his book De Hebraicis Idiotismis, and his
book entitled Communes and familiares Hebraicae linguae idiotismi.
The Hebrew Language in a few words comprehends much matter, is very
significant, it has a gravity, sweetness, vivacity, and mavelous efficacy
in its words, periods.

During the seventy years Captivity of the Jews in Babylon, there was a mixture
of the Hebrew and Chaldee Language, as is evident by the writings of the
Prophet Daniel, composed of both, as Jerome has well observed in his Preface
upon that Prophet, as also by the writings of Ezra, and more evidently in the
Chaldee Paraphrases.

The Syriack and Chaldee are as it were but dialects of the Hebrew (differing
not much more then Northern and Western speech from plain English) and though
they be nearly allied to the Hebrew, yet they are nearer one to the other,
insomuch that some reckon them both one.

Those Christians are a terror to the Jews who are indifferently skilled in
the Thargum and the Rabbis, for they know that many pillars of Judaism are
most vehemently shaken, yea overthrown in them. The more the pity that these
most profitable studies are so neglected in those places where the Jews most
resort.

Many Christians in Syria use this Language in Grammaticis and sacris about the
mountain Libanus.

The Samaritan Language.
Totidem verbis quot Judaei, ne una quidem minus, au^ amplius, Pentateuchum
legunt. Et quod caput est, literis non adulterinis, ut Judaei, sed meris
Mosaicis characteribus, ut plane a Postello proditum est, and res ipsa
loquitur. Scalig. De emendat. Temp. lib. 7.
It has no other letters and characters proper to it, but the Hebrew letters
and characters, yet most ancient. Many Jews at this day dwelling in Syria, and
chiefly in the Town of Sichem, use this Samaritan Language, which are called
Samaritans.

The Syriack tongue, which is very like to the Hebrew, witnesses that the
Hebrews have two and twenty letters, for they also have two and twenty in sound
alike, but diverse characters. The Samaritans also write the Pentateuch of Moses
in so many letters; and it is certain that Ezra after the taking of Jerusalem,
and the restoration of the Temple under Zorobabel, found out other letters
which we now use, when to that time the characters of the Samaritans, and the
Hebrews were the same.

Of the Syriack Language.
It is called also Lingua Aramaea, Esa. 36.11. The new translation has, Hoc
sacrosanctum est idioma, quo uti dignatus est Dominus noster Jesus Christus
filius Dei, Deus verus, and verus homo: cum in terris visibiliter ageret.
Propterea vocant Christianam, quia Domino Christo familiaris fuit. Ea utuntur
Asiatici omnes Christiani, cum inter se, tum vero praecipue in suis sacris.

the Syrian Language, the old, The Aramites Language.

The Syriack tongue is certainly thought to have had beginning in the time of
the Captivity of the Jews in Babylon, while they were mingled among the
Chaldeans. In which long revolution of seventy years, the vulgar sort of the
Jews forgot their own language, and began to speak the Chaldee; but yet
pronouncing it amiss, and framing it somewhat to their own Country fashion,
in notation of points, affixes, conjugations, and some other properties of
their ancient speech, it became a mixed Language of Hebrew and Chaldee.
Brerewoods Enquiries touching the Diversity of Languages and Religions through
the chief parts of the world, chapter 9.

Guido Fabricius clearly demonstrates the vulgar tongue of Jury in the days of
our blessed Saviors pilgrimage here upon earth to be Syriack, which (says
Masius) grew out of the mixture of the ancient Chaldee and Hebrew, and was so
different from the latter, that the one could not be understood by the other.
The Preface to Brerewoods Enquiry.

Crinesius commends the Syriack Grammar of Mafius, Mercer, Tremellius and
especially Wasers. But De Dieu's is an excellent one.

Of the Arabic.
It is 1. a very ancient Language, Si ut hominibus, ita linguis etiam genus and
prosapia nobilitatem addat, nostra uni cedit Hebraeae, primae huic (nec longo
sane intervallo proxima) and divinae parentis germanissima filia. Greav. Orat.

as Jerome shows in his Commentaries upon the Prophet Esaias, and in his Preface
to Daniel and Job; and Erpenius in his first Orat. De ling. Arab.

2. It is of larger extent now then any other Language, almost the third part
of the habitable world acknowledges it.

Although I be far from their opinion, which write (too overlashingly) that
the Arabian tongue is in use in two third parts of the inhabited world, or in
more, yet I find that it extends very far, and specially where the
Religion of Mahumed is professed. Brerew. Enquir. chapter 8.

Ejus beneficio valebimus sine interpret conversari cum Mauro, Aegyptio, Syro,
Persa, Turcho, Tartaro, Indo, and ut semel dicam, fere in toto terrarum orb.
Postellus.

3. It is an elegant Language whether we consider the plenty of words, and the
force of signification, or the sweetness of the phraseology, or the facility
and gravity of the whole Language. All these particulars Erpenius proves in his
first Oration. De Ling. Arab. and Mr Greaves says, it exceeds both the Greek
and Latin in number of words.

Vide Pocock. Not. Miscel. in portam Mosis.
4. It is a profitable Language. He that has the knowledge of this Language,
may travel without an Interpreter almost all over Africa and Asia. There are
many words in the Hebrew Bible, and the most ancient and profitable Chaldee
Translation of it, and many manners of speaking whose signification and sense
cannot be had but out of this Language. Without the knowledge of this Language,
how shall the impious opinion of Mahomet be either fully known or refuted?

It gives great light to the Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian, and other Languages,
to the Mathematics, Nulla, mi Lector, lingua est (Graecam and Latinam excipio)
quae plura solidae eruditionis and encyclopaediae monumenta continet. In
Theologia multos ea and graves scriptores habet. In re medica, bone Deus,
quanta e scriptorum Caterva memorabo, Rhasin, Abin Sennam, Mesuem, Serapionem?
Quam bonos, quam serios scriptores: Mathemeticis omnium charissimi Arabes: quia
Mathematica illis. Hac enim arts hi prae caeteris nationibus invenerunt,
coluerunt, perfecerunt. Testes mihi Geber, Haly, Thebit, Alphraganus,
Albumasar, and alii multi graves and actri ingenii authors, quorum inventa in

Vide Erpenii Orat. 2. De Lingua Arabica. Ad medicinam and humani corporis

they having invented the Algebra, and having Mathematicians more acurate then
Ptolomy, to Physic, Avicenna, Mesua, Serapio, Rasis were famous Physicians.
Averroes, Avicenna and others much adorned Philosophy. They have very many
famous Poets, Historians. Ingentes Historiarum copias habent, obscurae and
sepultae jam antiquitati lucem vitamque allaturas. Poetarum illis seges
densissima est, ut nullibi terrarum major ingeniorum messis provenerit, says
Mr Greaves in his Oration.

He commends it also for its facility, for here are no dialects at all, no
turnings of flexions, no anomalies.

Mercer, Joseph Scaliger, Francis Rophelengius, Isaac Casanbone, Emanuel
Tremelius, and Francis Junius, Clenard, Golius, and our Pocock and Graves
highly prized this Language, and promoted the study of it.

The Arabians (says Bedwell) translated the Syriack Testament not the Greek,
as it will appear by many places to him that shall compare them, whence those
things which are very well rendered by the Syriack, are also rendered ad verba by
the Arabic, where the Syriack has erred, there also the Arabic has much
more missed the mark.

Of the Ethiopick or Indian Language.
Graeci Ae^hiopiam dicunt ab (...), uro, and (...) visus, facies, solis enim
vicinitate incolae ejus regionis ita torrentur, ut atro sint color, adeoque
immutabili. Jer. 13.20. Crines. De Consus. Ling. c. 8. Linguam Aethiopicam in
multis mirifice congruere cum Hebraea, Chaldaea and Assyria inductione been
longa comprobari possit. Verum qui linguas illas vel primoribus labris attigit,
ex unico orationis dominicae, quod ^uctor adtexuit, specimine, clarissime
potest videre. Waseri ad Mithridatem Gesneri Commentarius. Indica lingua, adeo
Hebraicae, Chaldaicae and Arabicae affinis est, licet Characteribus variet, ut
rara admodum sit in hac dictio, quin in aliarum aliqua repetiatur. Haec sola
Orientalium, quae ab Hebraea originem habent, legitur nostro modo, a sinistra
in dextram. Postellus.
It is so near (says Bibliander, De Ratione Communi omnium linguarum, cap. 2.)
to the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic, that there is scarce any diction which is
not found in some of them.

The Ethiopians are descended from Chus the son of Cham.

It proceeds almost wholly from the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack and Arabic. They
write from the left hand to the right. It has a great passage through all the
Kingdom of Ethiopia and Africa, which is of great extent. Some think the
Prophets were written in the Ethiopick tongue from the times of our Savior
Christ, and his Apostles, and that the Eunuch (who was Treasurer under the
Queen of Candace) read it, by which Eunuch also afterward all Ethiopia was
converted to the faith of the Gospel.

Of the Persian Language.
There are many footsteps of the Persian Language in the Scripture, especially
in Esther, as Ahashuerus, Esther, Hammedetha, Phur or Phurim, Gaza, Susa,
Zeres, Hac de Lingua nihil prorsus possideo, sed eandem jam excolere coepit vir
alias excellentissimus in Linguis Anatolicis, Dn. Wilhelmus Schikhardus
Tubingensium Professor Publicus, dominus and amicus noster venerandus, qui
nuperrime ex eadem Tarich, hoc est seriem Regum Persicorum typis evulgavit
publicis. Crines. Discursus de Confusione Linguarum, c. 7. Inter omnes linguas
Armenica prolatione difficillima. Bibliand. De ratione communi omnium
Linguarum, c. 2.
Mardochai, and others.

Persarum lingua omnium linguarum mundi facillima est. Bibliand. De Ratione
Communi omnium linguarum.

Mr Graves has written of it, Persica lingua in tota fere Asia hodie locum
habet, ut in occidente Latina, says Waserus in his Commentary on Gesners
Mithridates.

Of the Coptick Kircherus has written.

Of the chief Oriental Languages, Arabic, Armenian, Syriack and Ethiopick has
Petrus Victor, Cajetanus Palma written, and Ludovicus De Dieu a Grammar of them.

Of the Greek Language.
It is a most elegant, rich and copious Language, There are several Orations in
the commendation of the Greek Tongue by Heresbachius, Hoelzlin, D. Prideaux.
Heinsius. Graeca lingua est erudita admodum and locuples. Et quemadmodum Latina
lingua alias potest copia sua instruere ac juvare, sic Graeca tum Latinam
ipsam, tam alias quoque auget and adornat: Estque perfectioni Latinitatis
necessaria, non secus quam Latina Italicae aut Hispanicae. Nec ullus absolute
suit Latini sermonis peritus, nisi and Graeco imbutus. Ex sermon enim Graeco
Latinus, ex Latino Italus Hispanus and Gallus manarunt, quibus olim nationibus
Latina lingua erat vernacula. Bibliander. De ratione Communi omnium linguarum.
Ingenium Graiis dedit ore rotundo. Musae loqui. Illinc sunt tropi, illinc omnes
figurae sententiarum and verborum, quae unde prodeant, satis suis nominibus
produnt: illinc sunt Oratores Romani, qui eloquentiam Graecis acceptam
referunt. Barthol. Alex. Orat. Omitto Latinos Poetas a Graecis omnia mutuatos
esse: Terentium a Menandro, Virgilio a Theocrito, Hesiodo, Homero: Horatium a
Pindaro. Id. ibid.
and very useful for understanding of the Scripture and other Arts.

The Old Testament was translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and the New
Testament was wholly written by the Apostles in this Language. Many Greek
Fathers also have commented on the Scripture, or defended Religion by
Theological Treatises. Grammatica, Dialectica, Rhetorica, Arithmetica, Musica,
Geometria, and many Chronological words have come from the Greek.

Many terms in the Mathematics cannot be understood without it.

The Greeks in their Liturgy have no Latin speech, but the Latins have
diverse Greek speeches in theirs. An evident proof, that the Latins have
received of the Greeks the Christian Religion, and have been their Disciples.
As this appears by the History of the Acts of the Apostles, where we may see
the Christian Religion passed from Syria to the Greeks, and from the Greeks
into Italy, and to Rome. Anatomy De La Mess, l. 5. c. 14.
Thence it comes, that the most part of words used in Religion amongst the
western Christians are Greek, as those of Christ, Church, Apostle, Evangelist,
Baptism, Eucharist, Bishop, Deacon, Exorcist, Monk, Letany, Antiphonie, Chrisme.

Romans 1.14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and Barbarians, that is, Vide
Drusium ad Roman. 8.15.
to all Nations under heaven, bottoming his speech from the phrase of the
Grecians, Graeca Lingua diutius est syncera and pura conservata, quam nostra,
quod illa barbararum nationum incursus minus sensit, quam occidens. Ludov. Viv.
De Trad Disc. lib. 3.
which gave the style of Barbarous for distinction sake, unto all the Nations,
even the Romans, beside themselves.

The Greek Language is difficult by reason of the many Dialects, the Attick
common, In Graeca lingua magni sunt recessus, and vastissimi Labyrinthi, non
solum indialectis variis, sed in unaquaque illarum. Attica and Atticae proxima
communis maxim sunt necessariae, propterea quod and sunt facundissimae atque
excultissimae: and quicquid Graeci habent legi ac cognosci dignum, istis
dialectis est consignatum. Reliquis utuntur authors ca^minum, quos non tanti
est intelligi: praesertim quum non in dialectis modo, sed in apellandis rebus,
and color loquendi tantum sic inter orationem numeris solutam and adstrictam
discriminis, ut non videatur esse eadem lingua. Bibliander de Ratione Communi
omnium Linguarum and Literat. cap. 4. Graeca Lingua quinque distinguitur
dialectis, Aeolica scilicet, Attica, Ionica, Dorica and communi. Attica vero
inter caeteras elegantior and communi propior, Dorica crassissima indicatur,
and in hac Eclogae and Pastorum co^loquia a Theocrito conscripta fuisse aiont.
Aug. Roch. Append. Bib. Varic. de Dialectis. Vide Crines. de Confus. Ling. c.
9. Graeca Lingua adeo necessaria, ut vix quenquam dixerim eruditum, qui eam
ignoraverit. Ringelbergius de Ratione Studii.
Eolick, Ionick and Dorick. The Attick Dialect is the most elegant and useful;
the Dorick was the most gross, therefore the Eclogues and conferences of
Shepherds were written by Theocritus in that Language: Yet Petrus Mosellanus
Orat. de Var. Ling. Cognit. says, Adsit ingenium foelix, non desit discendi
propositum constans, contingat and praeceptor non dectus solum, sed and
prudens, vel meo ipsius periculo polliceri ausim, minori and tempore, and
negotio mediocrem utriusque linguae cognitionem posse percipi, quam hodie
linguae semel latinae miseranda discitur balbuties.

Cato being old learned Greek, as Origin did Hebrew.

Vide Aul. Gell. Noct. At. l. 11. c. 16. and Turneb. Animadv. l. 5. c. 19.
There is no Language so happy in composition, as the Greek, so fit in joining
and coupling one word with another as it, as Julius Pollux a Greek Author in
his Onomasticon evidently demonstrates.

All the Hebrew and Latin eloquence know not with their mystery, gravity,
copiousness and eloquence, to express and utter so properly and naturally many
Nowns and Verbs as are to be found frequently in the Books of Greek Authors.

Greek Books, (in very deed, if any after the sacred) are best able to make a
man Wise and Learned. Dr Casaub. of Enthus. c. 2.

At this day the Greek Tongue is very much decayed, not only as touching the
largeness of it, but also in the pureness and elegancy of the Language; though
it was preserved pure longer then the Latin. Thresor de L' Histoire Des
Langues. De Cet univers. Par Duret. page 674. De couplements de mots Grecs.
Brerewoods Enquiries touching the diversity of Languages, cap. 2

Picus Mirandulanus, Hermolaus Barbarus, Bembus, Politian, were famous
Italians, In Graecis authoribus Xene^hontis Cyrus, and Socratici Commentarii,
and Herodotus, and Thucydides, and Demosthenes, and Aristotelis libri de
moribus, and de Repub. and Homerus, atque Hesiodus. Et cum ab his intermissio

well skild in the Greek.

By the pains of Theodorus Gaza, Luscaris, Musorus, Cretensis, Chalcondiles,
Argyropylus, Trapezuntius, Chrysoloras, the Greek tongue was wonderfully spread.

Sthwartzerd was called from the Greek Melancthon, Newman, Neander, Churchyard,
Polyander, Freeman, Luther, ab (...), Reuelin, Capnio.

The Germane tongue has many words purely Greek, as Neander in the first part
of his Geography shows.

Doctissimus ille quondam praeceptor meus Johannes Camerarius Dalburgius,
Ecclesiae Vvormaciensis reverendissimus antistes, aliquot millia dictionum
Graecarum collegerat, quae in utraque lingua Graeca and Germanica idem
significant. Bibliand. de Ratione communi omnium Linguarum c. 2.

The French tongue has a great conformity with the Greek, as both Joach.
Perionius de Linguae Gall. cum Graeca cognat. and Henry Stevens in that Book
entitled Conformite de Language Francois avec le Grec. abundantly show.

So has the English also diverse words from them, as I have elsewhere declared.

All Learning and Wisdom is contained in the Greek Language. Quia vero in
Graeca lingua suavissima, dulcissima, elegantissima, and ornatissima omnis
erudita doctrina and sapientia fuit tradita, cum Deus in illa gente, quicquid
literarum, artium, doctrinae ac sapientiae literatae uspiam esset, deposuisset,
caepit illa lingua propagati, tum per Graecorum colonias, tum etiam aliis
rationibus per omnes fero gen^es omnium partium orbis terrae adeo ut non modo
Scythis, Indis, quod ex Philostrato patet, sed Germanis etiam quod Willichius
in Commentariis suis eruditis in Cornelium Tacitum annotavit. Graecae literae
fuerint familiares, and circa Caroli magni tempora anno 800. circiter post
Christum natum Graecis literis Germanica scriberent, adeo ut omnes suas
rations, omniaque sua acta Graece usque ad tempora Rudolphi Caesaris
Habspurgensis scriberent. Neand. Geog. part 1a.


Of the Latin Tongue.
It is one of the three Learned Tongues, Legendi scriptores Classici quales e
Latinis praecipue sunt Cicero, Caesar, Terentius, scriptor, ut ad nomen, ipsum
alludamus, terendus adolescentiae noctu, diuque Vossius de Philologia, cap. 6.
Cognosce^dus nobis est Cicero totus in lingua Latino, and Caesaris commentarii,
and alustius, and Virgilias. in quo studio cum quid superest horarum,
interponendum ex Plauto, and Terentio, and Varrone, and Lucretio caeterisque
aliquid, quod ad intelligendum facile, and ad cognoscendum sit jucundum.
Nobilitas literata Sturmii. Ad Ciceronem vero quod me revocas auctorem quidem
linguae Latinae summum: nec tamen solum, quaero quid aliis facias: quorum
testimonia vim sententiae semper apud eruditissimum quemque habuerunt. Quaero
item, quid un^ saltem Va^roni respondeas: qui quidem sicuti Ciceroni palmam
concedit orandi causas: ita Latin loquendi sibi retinet. Quaero etiam: an
quasi barbaros quosdam rejicias: Livium, Sallustium, Quintillianum, Senecam,
Plinium quoque utrumque, multos alios p^aeterea tot saeculorum suffragiis
comprobatos. Polit. Epist. l. 5. Epist. 1.
in comparison of which all others are said to be barbarous.

Some hold that the flourishing, pure and incorrupt age of the Latin Tongue
was from Terence, even to the times of Quintilian.

This age had Terence, Pacuvius the Poet, Lucretius and Archias Poets, Varro,
Cicero, Julius Caesar, Virgill, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, Ovid,
Salust, Columella, Livy* Quintus Curtius, Persius, Seneca, Silvius Italicus,
and Martial. Under Augustus Caesar the Latin tongue was most pure.

Vide Becmanni Manuduct. ad Ling. Lat. c. 6. concerning the pure Latin
Authors, and c. 7. what Authors are most to be read, and also some Elogies of
the Latin Tongue by diverse Learned men.

Paesquier Recherches de la France l. 9. c. 29. reckons up the Authors which
excelled in the Latin Tongue.

The Latin Tongue grew to perfection by certain degrees, and in Caesar and
Cicero's times (whereof the one for purity, the other for copiousness were the
best that ever writ) it came to the highest flourish together with the Empire.

Among the Poets, Plautus, Naevius, Accius, Pacuvius, Ennius and Virgill most
refined it, among the Orators and Historians M. Cato, Sisenna, Caesar and
Cicero.

The Spanish Writer of the Book which is called the Trial of Wits, chapter 4.
collects thence, that there is a special agreement of the Latin Tongue with
the reasonable soul, because mad men which never learned Latin, nevertheless
sometime speak it of their own accord.

The Latin Tongue is useful for all Arts Lingua Latina non uni vel arti, vel
genti servit: sed omnibus quaecunque sunt, ubicunque sunt, and artibus and
generibus. Quicquid olim latuit in scriniis sive Hebraicis, sive Graecis, sive
aliis, in Latinum idioma conversum est. Beckm. Manuduct. ad Ling. Lat. c. 2.
Haec cum nuspiam hodie vernacula aut materna sit, ideo ab ineunte statim aetate
pueris discenda datur. Hac, quodcunque sit, in Scholis and Academiis docetur
Hac, quasi vinculo, tam variae, tam dissitae copulantur nationes. Id. ibid.
and Nations.

Julius Scaliger and Joseph his son hold, that the Originals of the Latin
speech are many of them drawn from the Greek. Crinesius de Confusione Linguarum
cap. 10. proves by many instances, that the Latin Tongue proceeded from the
Hebrew.

It is very commendable to speak good Latin freely, and to write in a pure and
elegant style.

That is much which Fanchimus Fortius Ringelbergius Postremo animum adjunxi ad
cura^ Latin ac polite scribendi, cujus gloria inter humanos conatus omneis
summum tenere locum videtur. In hac finire vitam decrevi. Quae si dabitur

French, Italian and Spanish.

The Language of the Spaniards is said to be Manly, the Italian Courtly, and
the French Amorous.

Brerewood conceives these tongues are more ancient, and that they have not
sprung from the corruption of the Latin Tongue, by the inundation and mixture
of barbarous people in these provinces, but from the first unperfect impression
and receiving of it in those foreign Countries.

One of the Councels calls the French Tongue Linguam Romanum rusticam, whence
Romances, because they were written in that Tongue.

The genuine pronunciation and reading is the most difficult in the French
Tongue, for many letters which are written, are not pronounced, or otherwise
pronounced.

Crinesius in his Discourse of the Confusion of Languages, c. 10. gives seven
general rules of the French pronunciation, and many special ones.

There are many several Dialects of the French Tongue. Nam in Gallia certe
nostra, tot fere linguae sunt, aut certe tot ejusdem linguae dialecti, ac
diversi pronuntiandi modi, quot sunt Galliae, non dicam provinciae, sed urbes.

The Spanish Tongue is near to the Italian, and seems to come nearer to the
Latin Tongue then the French, but not so near as the Italian.

Brerewood in his 6th Chapter of Enquiries touching the diversity of Languages,
says he has seen an Epistle written by a Spaniard, whereof every word was
both good Latin and good Spanish, and an example of the like is to be seen in
Merula Cosmog. part. 2. l. 2. chapter 8.

Scaliger Epist. Casaub. says Quarta pars Hispanicae linguae mere Arabica.

Scaliger commends the French for a most elegant and sweet Language, and
prefers it before the Spanish and Italian. Lingua F^ancica est hodie omnium
linguarum Romanensium excultissima elegantissima and suavissima, and cum qua
neque Italica, neque Hispanica contendere possunt. Jos. Scalig. Diat. de

The people leave out many of their consonants in their pronunciation, which
makes it the sweeter.

In aulis omniumpropemodum principum, maxim occidentalium, viget illa lingua

The people speak the best French in Blois or Orleance, and the best Italian in

and the best Spanish in Castile.

Antoine Du Verdier in his excellent Preface to his Bibliotheque highly
commends the French Language, Quant a la phrase and elegante maniere de parler,
pour exprimer belles conceptions, He has much more there in the commendation
of his own Language.

CHAP. VII. Of Universities and public Schools.
ACademies which at this day are called Universities, were in times past called

They always built their Academies in some famous City, as at Jerusalem,
Athens, Rome, Constantinople.

The use of Academies is very necessary many ways, therefore those
Commonwealths most flourished which did most esteem them.

Nothing is more Princely then to defend and provide for Schools and
Universities, Ne quid detrimenti capiat literaria Respublica, Carolus Magnus

Nothing more conducible to the profit of Scholars, then to indow Colleges
with great Immunities and Privileges. So in times past did many Learned Heroes
cherish Learning and favor Learned men, in Greece, Alexander; in Asia,
Mithridates; in Egypt, Ptolomy; in Spain, Alphonsus; in Germany, Charles the
Great and the 4th; in Bohemia, the Founder of the University of Prague; in
Prusia, Albertus the Elder; in Italy, Julius, Augustus, Maecenas; in France,
Francis the first; in England, Edward the 3d, Henry the 7th, and Elizabeth his
wife, Henry the 8th, Edward the 6th, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, King James.

Zanchius reckons up four most weighty causes of public Divinity Schools.
Orat. 1. Plane si natura nostra in ea puritate and integritate in qua condita
fuit, permansisset, tum omnes homines natura perfecti Logici, Rhetores,
Theologi, Jurisconsulti, Medici, Ethici and Politici, imo omnium virtutum viva

Ecclesiam suas Scholas habuisse, testantur omnes historici Ecclesiastici. In
hisce pueri prima religionis elementa discebant, and deinde libros sacros

Antiquitat. Academ. Dissertat. Sex.


1. That the Prophetical and Apostolical Writings might be preserved in them,
from corruption or destruction, which is the cause why Libraries were always
wont to be added to these Schools, in which other Books being written out
faithfully in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were kept.

2. That there might be perpetual witnesses in Schools which might testify by
a continual succession, what Books were truly Canonical and what Apocryphal.

3. That these Schools might also testify what was the native and genuine
sense of such Writings, and what doctrine was truly Apostolical.

The last cause was, That from those Colleges those might be drawn out which
were indeed fit to teach others, and to govern Churches.

The whole Kingdom of Israel was filled with Theological Schools, according to
the commandment of God.

Samuel was the first builder of Colleges that we read of, he called his
College Najoh, that is, even beauty it self. In Ramah the Prophets dwelt with
the Students, which were called Sons of the Prophets. Amos says, I am not a
Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet, that is, I was never taught in the Schools
of the Prophets, and the Learned.

Vide Altiug. Hist. Academ. Hebr.
They had Schools amongst the people till the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jews
being dispersed among other Nations, always endeavored to keep their Schools,
which they called Synagogues, which were Colleges, as it were, in which the
Law of God was interpreted among the more Learned, and wherein they conferred
and disputed about the Scriptures, Act. 6.9.

In Ecclesiastical Histories we may see this care of the Apostles and their
Disciples in settling Schools every where where Churches were built, Certe
honesta professorum stipendia, non minus nervi sunt Scholarum, quam pecuniae
belli. Zanch. in 2da Orat.
and in setting over them such men as were endued with singular piety and
Learning. Hence those most famous Schools of Antioch, Alexandria and
Constantinople, and many others in the East, and also in the West, which were
endowed by Emperors and Kings with most ample rewards, privileges and all
kind of benefits, that the pure Doctrine might be continued in them.

The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Persians, Grecians, Romans, set up
Schools, Honos alit arts, omnesque incenduntur ad studia gloria.
and by great liberality and other ways promoted Learning, and encouraged
Scholars. Vide Lipsi Lovanium l. 3. c. 6, 7, 8.

Quintilian in the second Chapter of his first Book, Instit. Orat. handles
this Question, Vtiliusne sit domi atque intra privatos parietes studentem
continere, an frequentiae scholarum and velut publicis praeceptoribus tradere:
Whether children be more profitably taught at home, or in some public School.

Ante omnia, (says he) futurus orator, cui in maxima celebritate and in media
Reipublicae luce vivendum est, assuescat jam a tenero non reformidare homines,
neque illa solitaria and velut umbratili vita pallescere. Necesse est enim sibi
nimium tribuat, qui se nemini comparat.

Add quod domi ea sola discere potest quae ipsi praecipientur, in Schola,
etiam quae aliis. Audiet multa quotidie probari, multa corrigi, proderit
alicujus objurgata desidia: proderit laudata industria: excitabitur laud
aemulatio: turpe ducet cedere pari, pulchrum superasse majores. Accendunt omnia
haec animos: and licet ipsa vitium sit ambitio, frequenter tamen causa virtutum
est.

Matricularii vocabantur, quorum nomina Matriculae inscripta. Matricula vero
est nominum catalogus, vel regestum, pro quo vulgo registrum dicunt. In
Academiis Matriculam appellant codicem, in quem referuntur nomina omnium
Academica fruentium liberate. Cui cum inscribuntur, studiorum gratia, in
Academiam missi, dicuntur matriculari. Vossius de vitiis Sermonis. lib. 3. cap.
24.
Immediately after Scholars come to the University, they are matriculated, and
then they enjoy the privileges of the University.

They are called Undergraduates till they receive a degree, after Graduati, or
in better Latin, In gradu aliquo dignitatis constituti.

The first degree with us is that of Bachelor of Arts, which they cannot attain
usually before four years standing, or near it. Baccalaureus a baccis lauri
compositus pu^^tur, sed potius corruptum censeo ex batualius: ut sit a
batuendo, ex quo batailie. Batualij vero fuerint vocati, quia jam quasi
batuissent cum adversario, ac manus conseruissent: hoc est, public
disputasserent, atque ita peritiae suae specimen dedissent. Vossius De vitiis
Sermonis l. 1. c. 19.


Three years after they may (if they be sufficient Scholars) take the Degree
of Masters of Arts, which are Doctors, as it were of the Arts, and therefore a
Master of Art takes place of a Doctor of Music, because he is Doctor but of
one Art.

Seven years after they are Masters of Arts they may take the Degree of
Bachelors of Divinity, and five years after, they may Commence Doctors of
Divinity; so that they are almost of twenty years standing before they take
that highest Degree.

Of the Ceremonies used in creating of Doctors, Dr Prideaux speaks sufficiently
in his Lectures.

Alsted in his Encyclopaedia, l. 24. c. 13. and Junius in Academiis, handle the
Universities after the Alphabeticall order of the several Countries, and so
beginning with Anglia, they first mention Oxford and Cambridge, then they
mention Bohemia, and in it Prague; then Denmark, in it Hafua; then France, in
it Alsted mentions sixteen Universities; then Germany, where he rehearses
twenty five Universities; then Spain, there he reckons up twenty two
Universities; then Italy, there eleven; three in Polonia, and three in
Scotland. Junius speaks of Lusitania before Polonia, where he mentions
Conimbra. Leukenor (our Countryman) in his Discourse of Universities, first
begins with Germany high and low, and so goes on with Italy, France, Polonia,
Prussia and Lituania, Bohemia and Moravia, Spain, England and Scotland.

Middendorpius mentions them in this order, Italy, Sicily, Germany, Polonia,
Spain, England, Scotland.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Universities of Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.
I Shall follow Leukenors method, (who is much beholding to Middendorpius and
Neander) beginning with Germany, and ending with England, Scotland, and Ireland.

I might speak also of the famous University of Athens, the Greece of Greece,
as Thucidides calls it. It was the place where Rhetoric had its first birth,
Vide Neandri Geog. partem 1am. Una urbe Attica pluribus annis eloquentiae, quam
universa Graecia, operibusque floruit, adeo ut corpora gentis illius separata
sint in alias Civitates, ingenia vero solis Atheniensium muris clausa
existimes. Patero. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 18.
and was brought to an height greater then it ever had in any place.

In which one City in memory of one age, were more Learned men, and that in a
manner altogether, then all time does remember.

In Philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Euclide and Theophrast.

In Eloquence and Civil Law, Demosthenes, Aeschynes, Lycurgus, Dinachus,
Demades, Isocrates, Isaeus, Lysias, Antisthenes, Androcides.

In Histories, Thucydides, Xenophon.

In Poetry, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes.

It was the universal Study of all the world: one was not held Learned, (says
Munster in the 4th Book of his Universal Cosmography) who had not studied at
Athens.

The Mathematics excepted, which came rather from the Chaldeans and the
Egyptians, the whole flower of Arts and good Learning came from Greece.

1. The Universities of High Germany.

Colen.
The University was instituted by Pope Vrbane the sixth, at the instance of the
Senate and people of Colen, in the year of our Saviors Incarnation 1388, faith
Middendorpius. He not only gave them full power and authority to confer all
degrees of Scholasticall honor to the Students therein, but also confirmed
unto them by a public Charter, the Privileges of Paris.

There are three Colleges, Collegium Montanum, Laurentianum, and Novum
Coronarum.

There is also another most famous public Schola trilinguis, wherein the
Hebrew, Greek and Latin tongues, and the Arts are also taught.

Basil.
Armianus Marcellinus faith it is derived from (...), which signifies a
Kingdom, Helvetiorum urbs florentissima Basilea, sic dicta, ut volunt, quod
vere (...) fit, regina urbium ac regia urbs. Melth. Ad. in Vita Jacobi Zuingeri
Munst. Cosm. l. 2.
because it is a royal City seated in a Princely place.

The River Rheine passes through it, and by means of it many Merchants come
thither.

The University was founded by Pope Pius the 2d, Anno 1459. and he granted to
it all the Privileges, Rights and Liberties which Colen, Erford, Vienna and
Heidelberg enjoyed.

is no great City nor very rich, yet it has often Printed and Reprinted the
Fathers Works.

Erasmus of Roterdam was buried in the great Church here.

Here lives now the famous young John Buxtorfe.

Mentz.
Moguntina ejus urbis Archiepiscopus fuit Bonifacius Anglus Evangelista
Germaniae, qui Ecclesias Germaniae rexit, annos 40. In diaecesi Moguntinensi
vixit etiam Johannes Tritemius Abbas Spanheimensis, vir doctissimus and
acutissimus, cujus extant opera aliquot mira and ingeniosa: Cronica praeterea,
and Epistolarum libri duo, in quibus insunt multae Epistolae ad Monarchas and
principes varios, quibus doctrinae multiplicis ac ingenii summi ergo omnibus
fuit acceptissimus. Neand. Geog. part 1a.
Dietherus of Eisenburg the Archbishop of Mentz was the Founder of this
University in the year of our Lord 1482. wherein at the first beginning, all
Arts in general were professed, but now only Philosophy, and the knowledge of
the Tongues, and Divinity by the Jesuits.

This City has deserved no small praise and commendation of all Christendom,
for that ingenious and most necessary Art of Printing, there first invented and
put in practice by the famous and worthy Gentleman John Gutenberg, in the year
1459.

Imprimit ille die quantum vix scribitur anno,
O Germania muneris repertrix,
Quo nihil utilius dedit vetustas,
Libros scribere quae doces premendo.
Wirtsburg.
In the year of Salvation 1403. John the 2d of that name, and 55th Bishop of
Wirtsburg, instituted therein an University, privileged and authorized by Pope
Boniface the 9th, and called thither out of the most renowned Schools of
Christendom, diverse Learned Professors of Philosophy, Divinity, and other
inferior Studies.

Trier.
The University here is thought to be one of the oldest Academies in Europe,
the Citizens thereof have no Record when it was first erected, by reason of the
manifold and often changes it has endured.

It appears manifestly by an Epistle of Gratian the Emperor to Antonius
Regent of Gaul, that all Studies universally flourished in this City.

Heidelberge.
It is the Metropolis of the Palatinacy of Rheine, The taking of that famous
Library in respect of many choice Manuscripts, and removing it to Rome was a
great loss. Heidelbergam ubi nunc agimus, maritus meus ab illustrissimo
Principe Palatino Imperii Septemviro accitus est, ad medicinam public
docendam: est enim una inter Germaniae Academias non postrema. Olymp. Full.
Morat. Epist. l. 2. Victoriae Moratae.
wherein the Palsgraves or Countes Palatines continually hold their Courts and
residence.

Rupertus the 10th Palatine of Rheine erected in this City an University, Anno
Dom. 3346. which in succession of time grew to be reckoned among the most
worthy and famous Nurseries of the Arts. Pope Urban the 6th confirmed the same
with the Privileges and Prerogatives of Paris.

This Academy has fostered many Learned men, as Rudolphus Agricola, William
Xilander, Thomas Erastus, Zachary Vrsin, Conradus Pellicanus Munsters Master,
Pareus.

Also in this University did that industrious excellently learned Scholar
Sebastian Munster, Ego anno 1524. usque ad annum 1529. Primus Hebraismi

Erford.
An University was therein instituted by Dagobert the French King, in the year
1391. which with many Privileges was confirmed and authorized by Pope Boniface
the 9th, and Pius the 2d.

Leiptzige.

A University was here erected about the year 1408. and the year following
confirmed by Pope Pius the 2d and Alexander the 5th, and repaired by George
Duke of Saxony, in the year 1554.

They are much given to drunkenness here.

Aeneas Sylvius in the first book of Panormitane de gestis Alphonsi regis,
writes, that when one Leonardus a Noble Gentleman came to visit a certain
kinsman of his that was then Student in Leiptzige, enquiring among Students how
he did, and how he had profited in Learning, he was answered by one of the
young man's companions, that he carried himself very well, quia inter mill and
quingentos hic unus bibendi palmam obtinet, among fifteen hundred he has the
name of the best drinker.

Duke Frederick the son of Ernestus Elector, erected in this City an University,
about the year 1502. which since in this later age is grown famous, by reason
of the Controversies and Disputations of Religion there handled by Martin
Luther and his adherents.

Many worthy Writers received their education here, as Wesenbechius, Henningus
and Oldendorpius two Lawyers famous for their Works through all Germany, and in
our later age Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon there have flourished.

Frankford upon Oder.
There are in Germany two Frankfords, both Cities of great fame and worth; the
one lies in Franconia upon the River Meine, Francoforda ad moenum nundinalis

well known to all Merchants and travelers, by reason of two rich and famous
Marts or Fairs held therein every year, viz. at mid-lent before Easter, and in
the middle of September. The other is situated near to the Oder, a goodly
River, passing through the Dominion of the Marquess of Brandeburge, one of the
seven Electors.

Joachim Marquess of Branderburg, first founded in this later Frankford an
University in the year of Grace 1506. and bountifully provided for the
maintenance thereof, indowing the same with large Revenews and rich
Possessions: as it was afterward authorized by Pope Alexander the 6th, and by
Pope Julius the 2d, and Maximilian the first of that name Emperor,
enfranchised with many privileges.

In this City the three Tongues are with great and profound Learning professed:
also the Civil Law, Physic, and the Mathematiques are there publicly taught.

Reinerus Reineccius the great Historian lived here: Jacobus Ebertus who was
Professor of Ethics here, was a great Linguist.

Rostoche.
In the year of Christ's Nativity 1415. the Princes of Mekleburge and the
Citizens of Rostoche obtained license to erect in this City an University,
wherein the Arts in general have ever since been Learnedly professed.

Gripswalde.
About the year of our Lord 1456. lived herein a certain Learned Doctor of the
Laws, which being Proconsul or Burgomaster of the Town, obtained for the same
many goodly Privileges and license to erect an University, which being by him
only begun, was perfected and enlarged by the great care and diligence of
Philip Duke of Pomerland, in the year 1547.

Friburge.
In the year of our Savior 1460. or as some say 1450. Albert Duke of Austria
founded in this City an Academy, and liberally endued the same with large
revenews and possessions. In the year 1467. this University received many
Statutes and Ordinances from Vienna in (...): from whence also came many great
and Learned Clerks, here publicly to (...) Theology, the Laws Civil, Canon,
and the other Arts. And at length the Emperor Frederick, in the year 1472.
much augmented and increased the same: the chiefest College herein, is that
which is called Domus Sapientiae.

Vdalricus Zasius a Lawyer taught here many years with great praise, and left
diverse Commentaries upon the Civil Law.

Martpurge.
An University was instituted in this City about the year 1526. which was
afterward repaired and reinstituted by Philip the Landgrave of Hesse, in the
year 1536. It was authorized by Charles the 5th at Regensburge, who endued it
with privileges of Vienna.

Diling.
In the year 1564. Otto Truchses Cardinal of the Roman Church, Middendorp. De

Bishop of Ausburge, and Protector of Germany, for the great and singular love
wherewith he always embraced Learning, brought the Jesuits into this City,
and erected therein an University of his own charge and expense, wherein the
Arts have ever since been with great diligence and Learning professed.

Vienna.
It is the most renowned Metropolis and residence of the Archdukes of Austria,
a City for wealth most opulent, Viennae clari fuerunt Wolfgangus Lazius Medicus
and Historicus Ferdinandi Imperatoris, incredibili rerum cognitione ac
lectione, multa variaque praestantissimus, cujus multa egregia opera historica
erudita ab illo conscripta prodiere in publicum.
and for strength most invincible, the only Bullwark of the Christians against
their perpetual and barbarous enemy the Turk.

This City is famous for the Citizens valiant holding out against the Turks
siege in the year 1529. in which 8000 Turks were slain.

See Mr. Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 978.

In this City is a public and famous University of great name, first founded
and instituted after the rules of Rome and Paris, in the year 1239. by the
Emperor Frederick the 2d, to the end he might leave unto his son Conradus,
an Empire strongly guarded and defended with men Learned and skillful in the
Liberal Sciences, which afterward Rudolphus the 4th, Albertus the 3d, and
Leopoldus the 2d, three brothers, Archdukes of Austria, with sundry privileges
Enfranchised, and removed the same from the place wherein it first was
instituted, near to the Palace of the Archdukes.

These were famous men in Vienna, viz. Wolfgangus Lazius Medicus an Historian
to the Emperor Ferdinand: also Julius Alexandrinus, Julius Alexandrinus cujus
de medico and medicina extant libri quinque opus valde eruditum. Claret ibi
etiamnum Johannes Sambucus Medicus and Historicus, e cujus Bibliotheca

Mathias Farinator, also John Haselbach was Professor of Divinity in this
University Anno Christi 1402. who was so large in the explication of that which
he propounded to his audience, that he preached twenty years out of the Prophet
Isaiah, and yet he was not come to the end of the first Chapter.

Pantaleon tomo 2do virorum Germaniae illustrium.
Peurbachius and Regiomontanus, (those two famous Astronomers) were Professors
also of the Mathematics here.

In the year 1562. at the cost of Ferdinand Emperor, but by the study and
unwearied labor of John Albertus Widmanstade, Chancellor of Oriental
Austria, a Lawyer, and excelling in the knowledge of diverse learned Languages,
the New Testament was printed at Vienna in the Syriack Tongue, which Manuscript
in that Language Moses Meredinerus a Priest brought out of Mesopotamia of
greater Asia into Europe, sent for this purpose into those parts by Ignatius
Patriarch of Antioch, that he finding a Patron who would undergo the charge,
that written Copy might by Printing be dimulged among the Christians living in
Syria and under the Empire of the Turk, Persian and Tartarian, which are the
three most potent Empires of Asia.

II. The Universities of Low Germany or the Low Countries.

Belgium or Germania inferior, (in English the Low Countries and the
Netherlands) from their low situation, and their conformity with the other
Germans in Laws, Language, Customs and Manners.

Lovaine.
This is a pleasant City. John Duke of Brabant obtained of Pope Martin the 5th,
the approbation of an University in this City, Urbs Lovanium urbs pulcherrima
complexa intra muros areas late patentes, prata, vincas, hortos, per quam
mediam praeterea fluvius Delalabitur. Neand, Geograph. part 1a. Vide Lipsi
Lovanium.
Letters and good Discipline began there publicly to be taught about the year
1426. Afterward Pope Eugenius the 6th licensed therein the profession of
Theology.

No University of Italy, France or Germany, may with this be compared for
pleasant air and delectable walks.

In it are for the use of the Students twenty Colleges, Collegia nomina habent
ab insignibus suis, and sunt Lilium, Falca, Castrum, Porcus. Accedit alius
locus linguarum notitiae destinatus, quom a re vocant Collegium Trilingue; nam

Cornelius Gemma professed Physic here.

Bessarian the Cardinal being the Popes Legate into the Low Countries in the
year 1513. was entertained here in the College of Divines, he left there a
memory of himself, Biblia manuscripta. Lipsi Lovan.

Douay.
In this City not long since was erected a famous University by Philip late
King of Spain, and authorized with the privileges of Lovaine, where Theology,
Philosophy, and the inferior Arts are Learnedly professed.

Liege.
In this City flourished in times past a most famous and renowned Academy,
wherein were Students at one time the children of nine Kings, twenty four
Dukes, twenty nine Earls, besides the sons of many Barons and Gentlemen. It
is at this day decated and almost utterly extinguished; only some trivial
Schools for the institution of youth in the inferior Studies are there
remaining.

Leiden.
There is scarce a Country in the world, which in so little a space has so
many neat Towns as Holland.

Leiden is one of the six capital Towns of Holland, Tu Leyda ut vetustate tua
merito possis gloriari, ita illud in te potissimum, quod musarum decus and
praesidium merita sis appellari. De Academia tua loquor, quae amplissimis

and is beautified with many pleasant Medows, Gardens, Arbors and Walls round
about it. Here was born John Bucold (alias John of Leyden) a Tailor, who played
Rex in Munster.

In this City was erected an University in the year 1575. by William Prince of
Orange.

They being there miraculously delivered from the Spaniards great Army, to show
their thankfulness erected this University and endowed it with goodly
privileges, whereto were called from diverse parts, Professors in all
faculties, allowing them good stipends. Vide Boxhorn. Epist. Dedicat. ad Theat.
Holland.

It does flourish now, and sundry Professors of the liberal Sciences are there
maintained with liberal stipends.

The first Professor there was Polyander.

Justus Lipsius, Bonaventure Valcane, Francis Junius, Joseph Scaliger, Clusius
H^insius, Salmasius, and diverse others taught here.

These things are considerable in the University:

1. The Physick-Garden, Is long amaenissimus est, arboribus and stirpibus
rarissimis e longinquis regionibus huc advectis refertissimus.

2. The Anatomy-Theatre, where there is Mummie of Egypt, the Idols of the
Heathens, Birds which came from China, and other far Countries.

3. The Library, well stored with Books of Divinity, Law, Physic, Philology,
Philosophy and Mathematics, both printed and Manuscripts.

There is Catalogus Bibliothecae publicae Lugduno-Batavae. At the end of which
there is Catalogus Librorum Manusuriptorum, quos Josephus Scaliger Bibliothecae
Leydensi legavit, ^ Libri MSS. Arabici, quos ex Orient advexit I. Golius,
Heinsii pro Bibliothecarii munere Gratiarum Actio.
There are diverse choice Manuscripts of several Languages, given by Joseph
Scaliger and Bonaventure Vulcane, and diverse Arabic and Samaritane, and other
Books which Jacobus Golius brought in great number from the East.

Bredah.
It was taken five times, some yet living having been in every siege, or the
surprise of it.
It is the Prince of Orange his Patrimony. The Prince of Orange was the Founder
of that University.

There is a Book printed wherein are the several speeches made by the
Professors in the day of their Inauguration.

There are two Universities in Denmark.

I. Copenhagen.
Academia Hafniensis, seu Coppenhagensis aucta a Christiano tertio anno 1540.
Variisque privilegiis ab Imperatore and Pontifice donata.
In this City was erected an University by Christian Earl of Oldenburge, in the
year of Salvation 1478. after he had gained the Regal Diadem: For the which he
obtained at the hands of Pope Sixtus the 4th the privileges of B^nonia.

This Academy was afterward augmented and enlarged by King Christian the 3d, in
the year 1498. and after him by Frederick the 2d, in the year 1549.

When Tycho Brahe was past twelve years old, Gassend. l. 1. De Tychonis Brahei

his Uncle sent him to Hafnia the Metropolis of the Kingdom of Denmark, that he
might study Philosophy and Rhetoric in that famous University.

II. Sore, or Soroe. Academia Sorana pro equestri ac generosa juventure in

CHAP. IX. Of the Universities of Italy.
ITaly is the most noble Region of Europe, and is commonly called, Singulari

its beautiful Garden.

The Italians do maintain, cherish, and honor Scholars, and are good
Maecenasses to them. Hence there are so many Universities in Italy, as Rome,
Venice, Padua, Bononia, Ferrara, Millan, Pavia, Turim, Florence, Pisa, Sienna,
Medena, Naples, Salern.

Here flourished the famous Orators, Cicero, Hortensius and Antonius; the
renowned Historians Livie, Tacitus and Salust; the memorable Poets, Virgil,
Ovid, Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius; Plautus and Terence the Comedians; the
Satyrists, Horace, Juvenal and Persius, Aeneas Silvius afterward Pope Pius the
2d, Marsilius Patavinus, Petrarch, Angelus Politianus, Rodolphus Volaterranus,
Picus Mirandula, Guido Bonatus, Ariosto and Tasso, Sixtus Senensis, Bellarmine,
Baronius, were Italians.

Rome.
It was so named from Romulus who laid thereof the first foundation. De
Romanae urbis amplitudine consulito Geogium Fabritium in sua Roma and Onuphrium

Nauclerus writes, that Vrbane the 4th of that name, being Pope, was much
grieved to see the course of Studies in the Roman Academy intermitted, and all
good discipline neglected: wherefore immediately he caused to be sent for that
famous and most learned Clerk Thomas of Aquine, to direct and govern it, who
setting aside all care and respect of worldly promotion, applied his mind
wholly to reform, restore and adorn the fame: during which time, at the Popes
entreaty he did write many excellent Commentaries upon divine and humane
Philosophy. Pope Innocent the 4th ratified this University. Pope Clement the
5th in a Council held at Vienna, ordained, That at Rome, or wheresoever the
Pope in person should be resident, the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabic tongues
should publicly be taught. Pope Eugenius the 4th much adorned this Academy.

Aelian, Gregory the great, Aulus Gellius, Laurentius Valla, Aldus Manutius,
and his son, Antonius Sabellicus were Romans. There is a Book of Andrew
Schots De viris illustribus urbis Romae. Porphyrius apostata e Tyro huc venit
ad Plotinum infignem professorem. Severus Imperator bonorum studiorum gratia ex
Aphrica Romam quoque venit. Swertii Athenae Belgicae. Aurelius Augustinus
Carthagine professionis causa Romam venit, and Alypius ut jus Civil ibi
addisceret. Divus quoque Hieronmus hic docuit, and Damasi Pontificis jussu
Psalterium correxit. Id. ibid.
Pope Nicholas the 5th, being himself a learned Prelate, highly favoring all
learned men, did more labor in repairing and beautifying this glorious Academy
then any of his Predecessors.

Pope Leo the 10th exhibited liberal pensions to several learned men, which by
their pains and industry upheld the glory of this renowned Academy. He sent
into Turkey for John Lascaris, who robbing all the Heathen Universities of their
best and worthiest Authors, did therewith plentifully furnish and adorn the
Roman Libraries.

Sixtus the 4th builded in the Vaticane that famous and renowned Library,
called Palatina.

Venice.
Italy is the face of Europe, Venice the eye of Italy.

Many men excellently learned in Rhetoric, Philosophy and Theology, have there
flourished and professed.

Johannes Rovennas taught in Venice, from whom issued many excellent wits,
which restored Schools and Discipline.

After the Latin Tongue was again restored, Emmanuel Chrysoloras began to
teach the Greek.

Many other singular Scholars have taught and lived in this City, as Hermolaus
Hermolaus Barbarus non minus rerum publicarum usu, quam eruditione praeditu^.

Leander writes, that in Padua is a free and public Academy, wherein all
Studies and Sciences universally are professed: erected by Frederick the 2d in
contempt of the Bononian Students.

There is no City in Italy, which for beauty and stateliness of Edifices, may
with this place worthily be paragomed.

Patavinus a minorite Friar, who wrote so learnedly in behalf of the Emperor
against the Pope, and Francis Zaborella the Civilian, Maginus the Geographer,
and diverse others lived here.

Bononia.
It is the chief University of Italy, and the retiring place of the Popes.

This University was first founded (say some) when Theodosius swayed the
Scepter of the Roman Empire, though others doubt of it. Gymnasium totius

Pope Gregory the 9th, Pope Boniface the 8th, and Pope John the 23. writing
sundry learned Treatises, did dedicate them all to this University.

Pope Clement the 5th in a Council held at Vienna, decreed, That besides the
study of all the liberal Arts, the Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean Languages
should be there publicly taught.

The Civil Law is much studied here, insomuch that from hence proceeded the
famous Civilians.

Johannes Andreas professed in this Academy the Law with great fame and
estimation.

Az^ that bright shining lamp of Learning was here also a public Professor
of the Civil Law.

Jo. Antonius Maginus was public Professor of the Mathematics.

Here also taught Bartholus and Accursius.

Volateranus writes that Salicet was in the year of Christ's Nativity 1316.
sent for by Albertus Duke of Ferrara, to institute a common School in this
City, which was afterward confirmed and privileged by Pope Boniface the
eighth, and exceedingly augmented by the bounty and liberality of the
succeeding Princes of Este.

Sundry learned Writers have proceeded from this Academy, as Felinus Sammaeus,
the Interpreter of the Canon Law, Andraeas Alciatus, Theodorus Gaza, Alexander
Guarinus, Caelus Calcanimus, to whom Rhodiginus dedicated his book of four and
twenty ancient readings, Baptista Gnavinus, and Nocholaus Leonicenus, Peter
Bembus his master, Johannes Manardus, Lilius Gyraldus, Alexander Sardus,
Angelus Aretinus the famous Lawyer.

Millan.
This City is one of the greatest of Europe, it is seven miles in circuit.

It has by long and ancient custom enjoyed a free and public University.

It was very famous in Virgils time, who studied there, as some write.

Demetrius Cydonius born in Thessalonica, forsaking his native Country, came
to Millan, Virgilius Maro ibi litteris operam dedit. Hermolaus, Barbarus,

where he studied first the Latin Tongue, and afterward Divinity, during which
time he translated the books of Thomas of Aquine into Greek.

The great ornaments of Millan were Ambrose, Hermolaus Barbarus, Caelius

Physic, and Alciate.

Pavia, or Papia.
Paplensis sive Ticinensis Academia an. 1561.
It is so called from its great affection to the Popes, seated on the River
Ticinus. It was anciently called Ticinum.

The University there is thought to have been erected by Charles the Great, not
long after Paris: for this Emperor zealously affecting the propagation of
Christian Religion, sent unto this City one of those Priests, which came to him
into France out of England, from venerable Bede, crying out in all places, that
they carried about them wisdom to sell, at which time began first the
Institution of this Academy.

In this place did Baldus read his latest Lectures, for he died, and was
buried in the Covent of the Friars minorites.

Turin a City of P^^^ont.
A goodly University was here erected by the Dukes of Savoy, Taurinum.
which excelled all other Italian Academies, for their perfection in
Typography, or the Art of Printing. Erasmus Roterodamus did in this University
proceed Doctor of Divinity, where he after became a public Professor of the
same.

He caused to be sent for into Florence Argyrophilus a Grecian born, and at
that time in the studies of Rhetoric and Philosophy singularly learned, to the
end that the youth of Florence might by him be instructed in the Greek Tongue,
and the Liberal Sciences. He entertained also in his house Marcilius Ficinus a
Platonic Philosopher, him he entirely loved.

This Academy was afterward by Lawrance De Medices his sons son, finished and
brought to a full, absolute and flourishing perfection. This Laurence was a
great lover of good Letters, he held Marsilius Ficinus (whom his grandfather
had caused to come to Florence) in great esteem. He nourished in his house that
excellent Scholar Angelus Politianus, who in his youth did first make the
Grecian Poet Homer speak in the Latin Tongue.

He entertained with liberal pensions and exhibitions, Demetrius Chalcondylas,

Picus Mirandula, and sundry others, much renowned for their singular learning.
Pope Paulus the third, although he daily heard in the Roman Academy, Pomponius
Laetus, a man excellently learned, yet was he exceedingly desirous to study in
the Florentine University, because the Greek and Latin Tongues, together with
the other Arts, were there professed with greatest sincerity and profoundnesse.
This Prince much augmented, and with great cost adorned the Library which his
Grandfather Cosmus had erected near the Temple of St Mark: from whence of late
time have been brought to light many excellent books, which long have lain
obscured, and were to be found in no other place of Christendom, as Eusebius
Caesariensis, Hierocles, and the works of Clemens Alexandrinus, and others.

Another Library was in this City erected at St Laurence his Church, by Pope
Clement the seventh.

Pifa.
A University was erected here about the year 1339.

Not long after it began exceedingly to flourish, as appears by the many
grave and reverend Doctors, which therein received their instruction and
education, viz. Pope Eugenius the 3d. Also Raimerus and Bartholomeus, two deep
and profound Scholars of the Order of the Friars Predicants, whereof the one
did write that egregious work of Pantheology: the other set forth The Sum of
Cases of Conscience.

There have been learned Professors in this University, Felinus Sandaeus,
Franciscus Aretinus, who was held to be the most judicious Civil Lawyer of his
time.

Bartholus after be had proceeded in Bononia, did in the Pisan Academy (as
himself confesses) publicly profess the Civil-Law, Cosmo de Medices restored
again this Academy, which in (...) was exceedingly decayed.

After him Laurence his Nephew so much adorned and augmented the same, that
Volaterranus and Machiavel name him as the first Founder and Erector thereof.

There is a fair Church here of Marble, in which are the pictures of all the
Popes from Peter, and also of Pope Joan, till Baronius caused it to be pulled
down.

An University was here long since erected, as appears by the authentic
testimony of sundry learned Historiographers.

Petrus Ancoranus confesses, that himself being sent for by the Council of
Sienna, in the year 1357. did in this University three years publicly profess
the Civil-Law.

In the time of Pope John the second all manner of studies exceedingly
flourished there.

Panormitanus, Paulus Castrensis, Bartholomeus, Socinus, Philippus Decius, Hugo
Senensis, and many others of great learning, did adorn this renowned Academy.

In this City was born Aeneas Silvius, who afterward was Pope Pius the 2d, by
whose bounty and benevolence this Academy was adorned with many privileges.
Francis Picolominy, after Pope Pius the 3d, and Sixtus hence surnamed Senensis
the greatest Scholar of the three, if not of all the age he lived in.

There is a College in it called Domus Sapientiae.

Naples.
It is a magnificent and neat City. Philip King of Spain was born there, Virgil
the Prince of Poets lived there, Neapolitani fuerunt Alexander ab Alexandro,

Livie, Horace, Claudian, Francis Petrarch, Panormitane, Laurentius Valla,
Blondus, Bartholomaeus Facius, Nicolaus Saguntinus, all most excellent men,
many of them Divines and Philosophers. Here Lucilius the Poet, and Thomas
Aquinas flourished.

Salern.
This flourished heretofore in the studies of Physic, being consulted by
Richard the first King of England when he went to the Holy War, they wrote a
good book of preserving health, Anglorum Regiscribit Schola tota Salerni:
Si vis incolumem, si vis te reddere sanum,
Curas toll graves, irasci erede profanum
Parce mero, coenato parum, non sit tibi vanum,
Surgere post epulas somnum fuge meridianum.
Nec mictum retine, nec comprime fortiter annum.
Haec been si serves, tu longo tempore vives.


By degrees also other Arts were here taught, although now by the injury of
time, and by the splendor of other near Academies it be almost obscured.

It was called Lutetia from lutum, which signifies dirt, because it abounded
with dirt and mire, and the French have a Proverb, That a thing stains like the
dirt of Paris, Il gaste comme la fange de Paris.

The Emperor Charles the Great did institute this famous University at the
earnest suite and instigation of Alcninus, Lutetia duodecim millia domorum
continet intra muros, praeter eos vicos qui sunt in pomoeriis, quorum capacitas
long urbem ipsam dicitur superare. Domos autem illas no putaveris casas. Sunt

Pasquier de Recherches de la France. lib. 9. cap. 4. seems to deny that
Charles the Great was the founder of this University, and in the 5th and 6th
Chapters of that Book, he shows his own opinion about it.

He says there (lib. 3. cap. 29.) that Peter Lombard laid the first stone of
the University of Paris.

Lewis the 9th Philip the 6th. Charles the 6th.
The Kings of France have beautified it from time to time with many sumptuous
edifices, adorned it with many high and noble privileges, and endued it with
many rich and princely revenues.

Some speak of a hundred Colleges there built all of costly marble-stone, for
the use of Students.

Lutetiae 54. Collegia existunt, eaque omnia fere ab Ecclesiasticis condita vel
locupletata, quot and quanta in ulla alia orbis Academia vix quispiam

Others mention but fifty four or fifty two Colleges, whereof forty are of
little use, and in the rest the Students live at their own charges, there being
no indowment laid unto any of them, except those two, the Sorbonne, and the
College of Navarre.

1. That of the Sorbonists.

Le Theater Des Antiquites De Paris Par Jacques Du Breul.
The King St Lewis by the Counsel of Robert of Sorbonne (which took his surname,
as they say, from the place of his Nativity) his Almoner and Confessor,
resolved to erect a College of Divines, which retains the name of Sorbonne.
The most famous Doctors in Divinity have studied in this College. The Pope
Clement the 4th confirmed the foundation of this College.

Theologi Parisienses primum totius Europae locum eo genere sibi vendicant, duo

He that answers there continues from morning to night.

II. The College of Navarre was founded by Joan Queen of France and Navar in
the year of Grace 1304. She enriched likewise this College with an excellent
Library.

The greatest part of the young Princes, Lords and Gentlemen in France are
customarily nourished and instructed in this College rather then another, as
well for its pleasant situation and neatness, as because of its royal
foundation.

Petrus de Aliaco Chancellor of Paris has bestowed so much on this College,
that he is esteemed as a second Founder.

Poictiers, Pictavia.
Poictiers is the Metropolis of the Earldom of Poictou, for Antiquity, not
inferior to any Town of France, second to Paris, only in greatness, power
and majesty.

In this City has long flourished a most learned University, Andreas
Tiraquellus was Governor of it.
for the Civil-Law chiefly, of great fame and authority in degree and
pre-eminence next to Paris.

Scaliger in his Cities thus speaks of it, Si studium est animae: veniunt a
corpore vires;
Galliaque a meritis poscit nerumque sibi:
Haec studiis, aliae belli exercentur amore.
Pictavium est animus, caetera corpus erunt.


It was erected under Charles the 7th King of France, and confirmed by Pope
Eugenius the 4th.

We read in the Ecclesiastical Histories, that St Hilary called the Apostle of
Aquitaine, first revealed unto this people the light of the Gospel, and became
the first Bishop of Poictiers, his excellent writings sufficiently testify his
singular wisdom and learning.

Joannes Capnion and Christophorus Longolius were Professors here.

Lions.
The Arms of the City are a Lion, whence the name of the City in French Lion.
Lugdunum. Anno Dom. 830.


In this City flourished an Academy of great fame and celebrity, which has
sent forth into the world many excellent men, renowned for their great learning
and holiness of life, as Irenaeus and Eucherius both Archbishops of Lions.

Hic claruit Joannes Gerson, eam exernavit Petrus Toletus, Bartholomaeus

This City is famous for John Waldus learned in the Scriptures, who opposed the
Pope and his Doctrine, whence the Waldenses called by some Pauperes De Lugduno,
the poor men of Lions.

It was a Colony of the Romans. They erected a University here near the Church,
and consecrated it to Minerva, Eloquence was chiefly adorned, and the youth was
much exercised in learning it.

A public University was in this City erected by Lewis the second about that
time that Rupertus Phaltsgrave of Rheine founded Heidelberg in Germany, which
was about the year 1346. Others will have it to be founded in the year 1362. at
which time Casimire erected Cracon in Polonia.

It flourishes in the study of the Latin especially.

Henry Valoise Duke of Aniou, brother to King Charles the ninth, not long since
with much industrious care, labored to augment and restore the same: the which
good work that he might the better perform, he with great munificence invited
thither sundry excellently learned Scholars: amongst the which was Francis
Baldwin, who therein to his everlasting memory did establish the profession of
the Civil-Law.

Bodine came out of this University.

Avignion.
I is an ancient City of Prouuence, situated on the bank of Rhodanus, wherein
is an University of long continuance.

Pope John the 22. transferred the Apostolic seat from Rome unto this City,
after whom it remained there 74 years, or thereabout.

The City and Church of Avignion are at this day immediately subjected to the
Popes of Rome, who first became Lords thereof, by means of a certain
Neapolitane Queen, who being indebted to the Church of Rome, resigned this City
to the Bishops thereof, and his Successors for ever.

Andreas Alciatus coming into France was hired (as himself in an Oration he
made to the Scholars of Tycinum confesses) for six hundred Crowns to be a
public Reader in this University. He taught the Law here.

Orleance.
It is a rich and plentiful City placed on the bank of the River Loire.

Some ancient Historiographers write, Aurelia. Vinum quod ex circumiacente agro
colligitur generosissimis Galliae accensetur Sanitati tamen proficuum non
creditur. Sic ut etiam Pincerne regio hoc Principi suo propinare vetitum
prohibeatur. Jodoc. Sinc. Itinerar. Gal.
that the foundation of this City was laid by Aurelian the Emperor, in the
year 276. and from him was called Aurelia, which name unto this day it
retains. Others say, it was only enlarged by him.

In this City was erected an University by Philip le Beau King of France, in
the year from our Saviors Nativity 1312. wherein the Civil-Law is with such
learning and admiration professed, that this Academy has been often of grave
and learned Writers, entitled the nurse or mother thereof. It enjoys the
same privilege with Toulouse.

The Maidens here especially labor to adorn the French Tongue, They call it
Pindarizer.
and they strive so to excel in it with an emulation, that they boast that
they imitate Pindar.

Bourges.
It is a City in France of great fame, rich, spacious, and much frequented.

Some say, it was called Byturus quasi Bituris, from two ancient Towers, which
they affirm to have been in this City erected by two brethren, which there
together reigned.

T^^ribus a binis inde vocor Bituris.

In this City is a most glorious University, and so much admired of all learned
Authors, that whenever they have occasion to write thereof, they call it,

founded by a certain Duke of Burges, but after in continuance of time falling
to decay, and being almost utterly extinct, it was again restored by sundry
Kings of France. It was authorized and endued with many great privileges and
high prerogatives by Pope Paulus the 2d of that name.

Here Alciate, Rebuffus, Duarenus, Hotoman, Bonellus and Cuiacius (famous
Lawyers) lived and taught with great applause.

Cane.
An University was erected at Cane in Normandy, upon this occasion. Academia
Cadomensis.
Henry the 5th King of England, who subdued the Kingdom of France, and left the
title to his posterity after many great and glorious Conquests achieved
against the French King, he at last bereaved him of Normandy, in the year 1418.
In token and memory of which victory, as an eternal Trophy and Monument of his
glory, he caused to be laid in Cane the foundation of this University.

The Archbishop of Dublin was the first Reader of Divinity there.

Here now lives Bochart the learned French Divine.

Rhemes.
It is a goodly City, and the Metropolis of Champaigne, wherein not long since
was erected an University by the Prince Charles Guise, Cardinal of Lorain,
Archbishop and Duke of Rhemes, whose glory and renown daily more and more
increases, by reason of the Arts so learnedly there professed.

S. Remigius was Bishop of this City, a man of holy conversation, and
excellently learned, as it evidently appears by the Commentaries which he
wrote upon the Old and New Testament. He baptized Clodovaeus a mighty and
puissant King of France, together with Chotisdis his wife, daughter to the King
of Burgundy, he died in the year 498.

The French Kings are anointed at Rhemes with the oil wherewith St Remigius had
anointed Clodoveus the first Christian King of France.

orbis Academiae.
where the Arts are publicly taught and professed.

Here Ausonius that famous Poet was born and educated.

Toulouse.
Pope John the 22 was the first Institutor of the University therein, which as
it was erected not long after Paris, so does it enjoy the same privileges that
heretofore have been granted to Paris.

There was said in times past to have been in this City a Temple, wherein were
commonly reserved in secret vaults and dungeons under ground, as Possidonius
says, 15000 talents of gold, which if any man had taken, he shortly after came
to some unfortunate end: From whence proceeds the Proverb, applied commonly
to those whose attempts are ever unfortunate and without success, Aurum babet
Tolosanum.

Popes authority.

The University is not in the principal City, but in that part which lies on
the other side of the river, and is named from the first Founder thereof
Cazimira: Therein are two goodly Colleges, in the one is professed Philosophy
and Divinity, in the other Physic and the Civil Law; the other inferior

CHAP. XIII. Of the Universities of England.
Britain (which comprehends England and Scotland) is the greatest Isleland of
Europe; it was in times past called Albion, say some, ab albis montibus primum
ad eam navigantibus apparentibus. See Bish. Usher De Britan. Eccles. primord.

Some of the chief things for which England is famous, are comprehended in this
verse, Mons, and Fons, and Pons, Ecclesia, Faemina, Lana.

England is termed by some, the Paradise of women, the Purgatory of servants,
the Hell of horses.

England has been famous for Learned men, Ante hac gratulatus sum Angliae
tuae, quae tot habaret viros egregia probitate, parique doctrina praeditos:
nunc propemodum invidere incipio, quae sic efflorescat omni genere studiorum,
ut omnibus regionibus laudem praeripiat, ac pene tenebras offundat. Quanquam
ista laus haud ita nova est vestrae insulae, in qua constat and olim eximios

finds fault with our English men for speaking Latin.

Some think they pronounce the a too little, and the i too big and broad.

Caius in his Book De pronuntiatione Graecae and Latinae linguae, says, that
he learned by experience that variety of pronuncing did hinder mutual
commerce, men's society and understanding of things. He says, that a Greek
Patriarck being at London in the Reign of Edward the 6th, did not understand
Sir Thomas Cheek, nor Sir Thomas him, the Knight using the new kind of
pronouncing, the other the old: he adds, pleading for the old and barbarous
pronunciation, Quo omnes Graci ad huc utebantur cum ego essem Venetiis, tum e
Cathedra Graecas literas profitendo, tum in templis sacra celebrando. Audiebam
enim data opera saepius. At si ego tacerem norit Oxonionsis schola, quemadmodum
ipsa Graecia pronunciarit, ex Matthaeo Calphurnio Graeco, quem ex Graecia
Oxonium Graecarum literarum gratia produxerat Thomas Wolsaeus, de bonis literis
optime meritus Cardinalis, cum non alia ratione pronunciarit ille, quam qua nos
jam profitemur. Id si ita sit, nos Britanni docebimus ipsos Graecos in ipsa
Graecia oriundos sua verba sonare? suas voces atque literas pronuntiare? and
plus in aliena lingua sapiens quam ipsa gens atque natio, cui lingua Graeca
familiaris atque etiam vulgaris est, and successione temporum continuata,
tanquam per manus esse tradita? Nam privata haec pronunciatio paucorum hominum
in Britania est, and eorum juvenum, alibi minime recepta gentium.

Westminster having but 40 Scholars, sends as many yearly to both the
Universities, as Eaton and Winchester both, though they have each of them 70
Scholars. Hactenus de Collegiis and Aulis, quae eleganti structura opimis

There are in England many trivial Schools in Towns and Cities: Amongst which
the most famous are,

That of Eaton and Westminster, founded by Henry the 6th, Edward the 4th, and
Q. Elizabeth, and of Winchester, Schola certe Augusta, ante 200 amplius annos

There are also in London that of Paul's, and Merchant Tailors.

The two Universities of England may equal many beyond Sea.

Most of their Universities ( Paris excepted) being no better then our
Colleges of Westminster, Eaton or Winchester.

Oxford (without controversy) is the more healthful place, and better
situated, and the Town and streets (I suppose) larger.

Both Universities are governed by a Vicechancellour and Proctors.

The Heads of the Colleges in Oxford have several Titles, as President,
Master, Warden, Provost, Dean, Principal; but in Cambridge they are all styled
Masters, except in Kings College, the Head of that House is called the Provost.

The time of Doctors and Masters proceeding yearly or taking their complete
degree, is called Commencement A French word which signifies beginning, rather
because they Commence or begin in those degrees, then because it begins before
Oxford Act.
in Cambridge, Act in Oxford, for though they be designed before to their
degrees, yet they obtain them not actually and completely but in Comitiis.

Oxford Act concludes with a Latin Sermon, so does not Cambridge.

In our Universities Scholars live in their Colleges, not in the Town,

Oxford was reckoned not only among one of the four ancient Universities, but
had the second place, Paris, Oxford, Bononia, Salamanca, and, as some think, it
may justly challenge the first place, though Coringius in his first Dissertat.

Ingulphus (who was Secretary to William the Conqueror) says he lived in
Studio Oxoniensi. His words are these, Historia Ingulphi.

Those Schools of Learning which we call Academies or Universities, that Age
termed Studia; that is, Studies. St Hierom termed the Schools of Gaul, Studia
florentissima. The name of University was taken up about the time of King Henry
the 3d, for a public School.

There are but three Latin Writers (which I have met with) who ^^ve written
generally de Academiis, Junius, and Middendorpe, and another entitled,
Academiarum quae aliquando Fuere and Hodie sunt in Europa, Catalogus and
enumeratio brevis.

there is added a brief Catalogue of all the Universities in the Christian
world, in which their Country, Names, Original and situation are described out
of Ptolomy.

He begins with England, and therein with Oxford, and says of it, Academia
Oxoniensis vulgo Oxford, quam instituit Aluredus, Saxonum Rex, Anno Christi
872. Postea vero ex multorum Principum and Praesulum beneficentia, amplissimis
structuris, reditibus and privilegiis ornatur: hab^tque jam Collegia XVI, aulas
etiam VIII, singula aedificiorum splendore magnificentissima, ac bonarum
literarum artiumque omnium studia florentissima. Cantabrigiensis, vulgo
Cambridge, in qua primum Collegium instituit Batsomus, Eliensis Episcopus, Anno
1274. Habet jam Collegia XI, Aulas etiam IV, eaque omnia aedificiorum
celebritate praestantissima. Habuit etiam ante Scholam publicam perangustam (in
qua Philosophia, humanio oresque disciplinae tradebantur) a Sigeberto,
Estanglorum Rege constitutam, Anno 637.

Yet it is the opinion of some, that the University of Oxford was rather
restored then first Founded by King Alured, Anno 806. after it had been
overborn a while by Danish furies.

Middendorp in his 3d Book de Academiis, where he speaks of the Universities of
England, says, Inter harum duarum Academiarum professores gravis and acerba
nuper controversia exorta est, dum singuli suam Academiam and antiquiorem
prioremque tempore, and praestantiorem existere asseverant, and varias pro sua
quisque sententia rations, diversaque argumenta producit, ut difficile sit
homini externo, terra ab iis marique disjuncto, suum judicium interponere. But
after counsel given to them, to endeavor rather to excel each the other in
diligence, Quid profuerit si haec illa antiquior fuerit Academia, modo haec
illi virtute par sit. Puerorum est de locorum praestantia and dignitate
contendere, and inanium verborum contentione and dissidio animos vulnerare.

approve of, who in a speech at Cambridge- Commencement the last save two, had
this passage, Cantabrigia, Oxonium. Oxonium, Cantabrigia.
faithfulness and wisdom, and not to stand so much upon antiquity, and
multitude, or excellency of Colleges, which belong more to the glory of the
dead then the living, he concludes at the last thus,

Porro utramque hanc Academiam, veterem quidem atque florentem reperio,
Cantabrigiensis tamen, quantum hactenus deprehendere licuit, tempore prior and
antiquior est. Ideoque ab ea principium ducam.

But Learned Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus p. 217. says thus,

Haec ipsa Antiquitatis lis, publico jam nuper totius Regni conventu
Parliamentario, ex antiquissimorum Historicorum fide examinata est and
determinata, and praecedentia Oxoniensi Vniversitati communi applausu omniumque
suffragiis asserta.

There he also adds, p. 218.

Johannes Caius, vir fidei ut in rebus Religiosis, ita in Historicis nullius
plane.

He proceeds,

Imo qui inter ipses istius Scholae antiquitatem acerrime tuentur, non asserunt
tantum, sed and probant indubitatis argumentis Cantabrigiam, Generalem Artium
and scientiarum Academiam factam and stabilitam non fuisse, ante vicesimum
annum Edwardi tertii (hoc est nudiustertius fere, si Aluredi seculum spectemus)
quo Rege intercedente, apud Johannem Pontificem Romanum, Universitatis ibi
stabiliendae privilegium iis est concessum ut Petrus de Ickham Monachus
Ecclesiae Cantuar. scribit.

Caius M^ddendorpii testimonio rem probat: Caii testimonio eandem probat
Middendorpius: sic manus manum, and falsarius falsarium fricat. Quin potius
suam oportet agnoscere ignorantiam, qui de exterorum rebus scribit, quorum res
gestas nunquam legerit. Imo Middendorpi (tibi clam in aurem dico) agnosce
impudentiam tuam, qui ita confidenter scribis de Academiis, ac si in omnibus
aetatem totam vixisses, ita tamen frigide, futiliter, indocte, ac si in nulla
unquam vel diem unum posuisses. Wake ibid.

The third who writes of all the Academies of Europe says,

Ac libens optarim ne digladientur nimis and naenias mittant, qui hanc aut
illam Acad^mia^ contendunt esse antiquioram. Sint Arcades ambae, utraeque
florentes, lucem sole clariorem sibi invicem alternantes.

There is a Manuscript of Robert Burhils in Oxford Library, De Britanniae rebus
Scholasticis in verse, consisting of ten Books. The sixth book is termed
Elfreda, de urbe Oxonia quam Elfreda insedem Academiae deligendam suader. The
seventh book is styled Parallelismus de Antiquitate utriusque Academiae Oxon.
and Cantab. wherein he asserte the antiquity of Oxford, but says, Non est quod
Cantabrigiensis Academia hanc suam originem etsi seriorem erubesceret. Primo,
cum nec operae pretium sit contendere. Secundo, nec leves interim calamitates
dum nondum exorta esset Cantabrigia, Academiam Oxoniensem nostram exceperint.
Tertio, and antiquiora fere incultiora, Academiis vix tandem Monastica fece
expurgatis.
And after he has this passage of Cambridge: Haec est illa Academia antiqua,
and celebris, quae non modo Oxoniensi florentissimo Anglorum Gymnasio, sed and
aliis Europaei orbis Academiis antiquioribus facile posset adaequari.

He speaks also very honorably of Oxford, and I have cited something out of
him to that purpose.

Sir Thomas More says in an Epistle to the University of Oxford, Cantabrigiae,
cui vos praelucere semper consuevistis. Epistola Thomae Mori ad Acad. Oxon.


I know one, who is a very competent judge, because a most Learned Bishop, and
well versed in antiquities, and also of an University in another Kingdom, who
holds Oxford to be the ancienter.

Oxford also has been famous for Learned Scholars.

Mathematicians and Schoolmen, for the later there is no question, Trithemius,
Baleus, Lelandus Oxonienses ultra trecentos Cantabrigienses non plures uno
supra centum and viginti scriptores in suis Catalogis commemorant. Brianus
Twinus Antiq. Acad. Oxon.
and I shall mention diverse of them when I speak of Merton College.

For the first Roger Bacon, Bradwardine, Simon Bredon and Oddington were famous.

The first Professor Vide Gervas. Dorobernens.
in Civil Law in England, viz. Vacarius, was of Oxford.

Oxford lies in a Champion plain: It is a fair and goodly City, whether a man
respect the seemly beauty of private houses, or the stately magnificence of
public buildings, together with the wholesome sight or pleasant prospect
thereof.

It is formed in the figure of a Cross, two long streets thwarting one another,
each of them near a mile in length, containing in that compass thirteen Parish
Churches, and a See Episcopal founded here by King Henry the 8th, Anno 1541.

For the Stateliness of the Schools and public Library and There are many
Pictures throughout the great Gallery adjoining to the Library, of Learned men
in several Faculties. The Statutes of the University of Oxford at large are
much commended. The select Statutes out of the body of them are printed and to
be sold.
Gallery, the bravery and beauty of particular Colleges, all built of fair and
polished stone, the liberal endowment of those houses, and great
encouragements of Industry and Learning in the salary of the Professors in most
Arts and Sciences, it is (say some) not to be paralleled in the Christian world.

Dr James has set out two Catalogues of the public Library in Oxford:

One published in the year 1605. which mentions the Books Alphabetically
distinguished, according to the four Faculties. Clarissimus vir Thomas Bodleius
qui vetustate, and temporum an hominum injuria Collapsam Universitatis
Bibliothecam immensis sumptibus, conquisitis undine praeter omnes omnium
generum codices excusos, manuscriptis, quantum in hoc spicilegio licuit,
compluribus vetustis optimae notae, instauravit. Savil. Not. in Chrysostom. in
Genesis Tom. 8.


The other 1620. in which there is only a care had of the Alphabeticall order,
by this more exact Catalogue one may readily find any Author, and all the
Works of that Author uno intuitu.

If the Library be inferior to the Popes Vaticane in sumptuous building, yet
in Printed Books, if not in Manuscripts (there being many choice ones given by
Sir Thomas Bodlie, and of late by my Lord of Pembroke, and Archbishop Laud, in
almost all Languages) it may well contend with it for a Superiority.

Reckon the number of Volumes in the public Library, He mentions sixteen
thousand in his Preface to his last Catalogue.
whereof the greatest part are in Folio, which amount to 11 or 12 thousands of
diverse Authors, the plurality of Languages, the diversity of Sciences, wherein
these Books are written, the condition of the Books whether written or printed,
by Protestants or Papists, or any other, the use for six hours every day
throughout the whole year, (Sundaies and Holydaies excepted) and we shall find
that the like Library is no where to be found. Dr James of the Corrupt. of
Script. Counc. and Fath. part 5.

In Oxford there are 18 Colleges endowed with Lands, besides 7 Halls, where
Students live at their own charges in both of them.

Professors of the Arts and Sciences, as also of Divinity, Law, Physic, and
the learned Languages, with Liberal Salaries.

University College, Founded 872.
Alfred or Allured King of the West Saxons, being addicted to Religion and good
literature, for the increase and study of Divinity, Philosophy and other Arts,
in the 2d year of his reign founded this College, by the name of University
College.

George Abbat Archbishop of Canterbury was of this College.

Baliol College, Founded 1262.
John Baliol, born at Bernads Castle in the Bishopric of Durham, (a worthy
Warrior to King Henry the 3d in his civil Wars against his Barons) with his
wife Dervorgilla, Collegium Baliolense gloriatur potius quod Humfredum ducem
Glocestriae, Henrici quarti filium virtutum merito Bonum cognominatum Academiae
nostrae lucidum atque patriae Sydus, nomen que nunquam oblinescendum educarit

Platon.
a Lady of Honorable Parentage, Parents of John Baliol King of the Scots,
Founded this College, giving thereunto both Lands and Revenews, for the
maintenance of a Master, 10 Fellows, and 11 Scholars, which is Recorded to be
the first and most anciently endowed College in this University, as some late
Historians constantly affirm.

Europe were of this College.

What one College ever yielded at one time and from one Country, three such

Magdalen College, Founded 1459.
William Wainflet Bishop of Winchester founded first Magdalen-Hall, after that
this College dedicating the same to the honor of S. Mary Magdalen. Itaque

Thomas Wolsey Cardinal, Archbishop of York, and Lord high Chancellor of
England laid the foundation of a most ample and spacious College, but he
falling, his design failed with the Founder.

Henry the eight enriched the same with many goodly revenues, annexing
thereunto Canterbury College.

It has a spacious Court or quadrangle, nay diverse, and a Hall both spacious
and splendid, wherein is a most beautiful glass Lanthorn, there is also a
very fair Kitchen, which only, was finished by the Cardinal, and gave occasion
to that scoff of an outlandish man, Egregium opus (says he) Cardinalis
Collegium incepit, popinam absolvit. Sanna vix e coquina deprompta adeo sale
caret, says Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus.

Peter Martyr was once Prebend of this College, as his own Epistles show, He
writes thus, Amico cuidam in Anglia, Ego cum essem Oxonii vestibus illis albis
in Choro nunquam uti volui, quamvis essem Canonicus, mei facti ratio mihi
constabat.

Toby Matthew Archbishop of York was of this House, and Mr Burton who wrote of

paucioribus ignotus
Hic jacet Democritus Junior
Cui vitam pariter and mortem
Dedit Melancholia.

Pembrok College, Founded 1620.
It was first Broadgate-Hall, but was called Pembroke College from William
Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and Visitor of
that Hall.

There are also in this University seven Hals, in which there are many Students
living at their own charge, viz.

Glocester-Hall.
Which being first built for Monks, was after converted to a House for
Scholars, by Sir Thomas White Knight.

Edmund Hall.
It was builded by S. Edmund Archbishop of Canterbury.

Albon Hall.
It was builded by the Abbot of St Albons, for their Monks to study in.

Heart Hall.
It was built by Walter Stapleton Bishop of Excester.

Mr Seldom was of this House.

New Inn.
Heretofore it was called Turlocks Inn.

St Mary Hall.
It was founded by King Edward the second.

Sir Thomas More Chancellor of England was of this Hall. Cardinal Allen was
principal of it about the same time.

Magdalen Hall.
It was founded by William Wainfleet Bishop of Winchester, and Dr Budden who
writes his life and death, calls it Aulam Magdalene parentem Collegii, and a
little book which mentions the several Colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, makes
the Hall a eleven years elder then the College.

Cambridge.
THis is the other University and eye of England, a most famous Storehouse of
good Literature and Godliness; it stands upon the River Came, which divides
it into two parts, and has a Bridge over it, whence arose the name Cambridge.

There is not wanting any thing here, which a man may require in a most
flourishing University, were it not that the air is somewhat unhealthfull,
arising as it does out of a Fenny-ground hard by.

Imo qui inter ipsos istius Scholae antiquitatem acerrime tuentur, non asserunt
tantum, sed and probant indubitatis argumentis Cantabrigiam, Generalem Artium
and Scientiarum Academiam factam and stabilitam non fuisse, ante Vicesimum
annum Edwardi tertii, hoc est nudius-tertius fere, si Aluredi seculum
spectemus. Wake Rex. Platon. Vide plura ibid.
That Cantaber a Spaniard 3751. years before Christ's Nativity, first began and
founded this University, is affirmed by Cains, but Leland the great Antiquary,
and Camden also confute that conceit; and Mr Camden says, It was a seat of
learning about the time of King of Henry the first, and that under the reign of
Edward the first (some think it should be the second) Grantbridge of a School
was made an University (such as Oxford is) by the Court of Rome. Hugh Balsham
Bishop of Ely in the year 1284. built the first College, called Peter House,
and endowed it with lands: whose example the other Founders did imitate and
follow, says the same Camden.

That which some relate also, That a public Academy was erected at Cambridge
by King Sigebert, Anno Christi 630. Id vero dubia annalium fide nititur;
Cantabrigiensium quoque aemuli Oxonienses pernegant fortiter. Et ut quaedam
fuerit instituta, procul dubio rudis fuit, nec in longum tempus. Caeterum nono

Ingulphus.

That which some urge for the honor of Cambridge of Bedes reading there, is a
fable well confuted by Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus, in his Acts of the
fourth day, Bedam vero ipsum unquam Cantabrigiae fuisse quis nisi cerebri lasi
putat? Quum ipse dissertissimis scriptis suis assorat, se nunquam extra
monasterium suum operam literis dedisse, ac ne inde unquam fere egressum a
pueritia; Cantabrigiam vero, sua aetate adeo Academiam celebrem non fuisse, ut
fuisse, ut plane desolatam civitatulam asserat.

Caius the Physician styled himself Londinensem when he wrote De Antiq. Cantab.
Acad. though he was of Cambridge, and only a Londoner by birth, ne si
Cantabrigiensis videretur, affectum quoque suum in scribendo prodidisse
videretur^,

That passage of Caius's De Antiqu. Cantab. Acad. lib. 1. therefore might well
have been spared. Caeterum ad has discordias rumpendas atque finiendas
sanctamque pacem componendam, atque statuendam, cum neque Oxoniensis
Cantabrigiensem, nec Cantabrigiensis ferat Oxoniensem in controversia judicem,
quod pro sua cujusque affectione rem tractatam iri uterque indicet, ex libidine
magis quam ex vero celebratam aut obscuratam existimet, res suasit and
commiseratio jussit, ut ego homo Londinensis, medio loco inter utrumque
positus, and eodem animo in utrumque affectus, cui longa triginta annorum
absentia a gymnasiis (nisi subinde invisendi gratia charitatis studio) omnem
affectum juvenilem in Gymnasia sustulit, hanc controversiam ut inutilem, imo
vero rem damnosam alioqui tanquam communis amicus definirem ac componerem. Vide

My worthy friend Sir Simonds D' Ewers (in his Speech touching the Antiquity of
Cambridge) says, If I should lose time to reckon up the vain allegations
produced for the Antiquity of Oxford by Twyne, and of Cambridge by Caius, I
should but repeat deliria senum.

At the present Cambridge consists of sixteen Colleges and Hals (for there is
little difference there between them) erected and maintained with the Lands and
Revenues of their several Founders. The Halls there are endowed with Lands and
Fellowships as the Colleges are. No private Chapel in England beyond that of
Kings College in Cambridge. Collegium studiosorum prope dixerim Europae

Kings College Chapel being founded by Henry the sixth, is all of freestone,
a very curious structure, and from its form, called the University Cradle.

The University of Ireland.
THe Christian Faith was first preached among the Irish by St Patrick.

The Irish Scholars of Patrick profited so notably in Christianity, that in the
Age next following, Ireland was termed Sanctorum Patria, that is, the native
Country of Saints; and the Scottish Monks in Ireland and Britain highly
excelled for their holiness and learning.

Out of Ireland came Caelius Sedulius a Priest.

Richard Fitz-Ralf, commonly called Armachanus, is of famous memory, who turned
the edge of his style about the year 1355. against the mendicant Friars, as
detesting in Christians such voluntary begging.

Dublin, or Divelin.
Dublinium and Dublinia. The Irish call it Balacleigh, the Town upon Hurdles,
when it was built, the foundation was laid upon Hurdles, the place was so
feuish and moorish. This is the chief City of Ireland, it is situated in a
delightful and wholesome place.
There is a beautiful College consecrated unto the name of the holy and
indivisible Trinity, which for the exercising and polishing of wits with good
Literature, Queen Elizabeth endowed with the Privileges of an University; and
it is furnished with a good Library.

Bishop Usher was born there, and was the first Scholar of that College.

Thus much of Dublin (says Camden in his Britain) for the most part of which
I acknowledge my self beholden unto the diligence and learning of James Usher
Chancellor of St Patricks Church, whose variety of knowledge and judgment are
far above his years.

Had he lived in any other age save his own, we should not have needed now to
envy either Hippo for Augustine, or Strido for Jerome, nor any other of those
ancient noble Worthies of the Church.

Possevine in his Apparatus says, that at the age of 22 years he attained the
knowledge of almost all Arts and Sciences. For besides Philosophy and Divinity,
the Canon and Civil Laws, History and the Mathematics, he was well skilled in
Greek and Hebrew.

Some conceive they meant after he came to the use of reason and the state of a
man, others say, he wrote more sheets of paper then he lived days.

It is related by a very credible Author Fr. Ximenes, Archbishop of Toledo, and
Primate of all Spain, that reckoning the days that he lived, from his first
infancy until his dying day, you shall find three sheets of paper that he
wrote for every day.

He is styled Voluminous Abulensis, or the Voluminous Writer.

utrunque comperi. Fuisse vero Adrianus ab usque adolescentia Graecarum
literarum adeo studiosus traditur, ut vulgo Graeculus appellaretur, ut Aurelius
Victor and Spartianus prodidere. Mox rerum summam and imperium adeptus, in
Graecia est diutissime versatus, ut multis in locis ostendit Pausanias. Fuit in
pangendis versibus versatus, saepeque non modo cum Philosophis aliisque
scriptoribus certavit, sed and carminibus faciendis cum poe is. Ad lacessendum

was a very Learned Prince and Facetious, a great Grecian, he was called by
many Graeculus.

Pope Adrian the fourth, an Englishman, he was bred and born at St Albons. Often
times in familiar talk with John of Salisbury his Countryman he used these
sentences: To take the Papacy (says he) is to succeed Romulus in murder,
Nicolaus Breckspeare ad culmen Pontificium sub nomine Hadriani 4ti evectus, qui
in familiari cum Johanne Sarisburiensi Anglo, amico veteri, colloquio, amice

and not Peter in sheep-feeding. None is more wretched then the Romish Bishop,
neither is any man's condition more miserable then his. Johan. Salisb. de nugis
aulicorum, l. 8. His breath was stopped with a fly which entered into his throat.

Pope Adrian the sixth, a poor man's son of Vtrecht.

He was a Learned man and Schoolmaster to Charles the 5th, who sent him to Rome
to negotiate for him for the Popedom, thinking thereby to sway much if he could
get both the Swords; but they chose Adrian, who would not change his name (as
the custom is) when he was made Pope. Marcellus Cervinus being elected Pope
also retained his name, showing that his dignity had not changed him. See the
Hist. of the Counell of Trent, l. 5. p. 389, 390.

He says there, that the changing of the Popes names began, because Dutch men
were made Popes, to whose names Roman ears were not accustomed, all that
followed observed the same use, signifying thereby that they had changed their
private affections into public and divine cares. Platina says Sergius the 2d
was first called Os P^rci, Swines mouth, and because of that filthy name he
took the Name of Sergius when he was made Pope, and that that custom continued
after, that those which were made Popes changed their names, although this was
not observed by them all.

Adrians memorable speech was, Nihil sibi imperio infelicius in vita accidisse,
That nothing befell him more unhappy in his life, then his Dominion.

He was severe and purposed to reform corruptions, and said he would begin with
the Court, but was thereupon poisoned, as some think.

He beginning with the first Kings of France, has written a French History of
above a thousand years, yet with laconicall brevity. He is reported to have
spent thirty years about this famous work, and by it got himself a great Name.

Aeneas Sylvius an Italian, after called Pope Pius the 2d, he lived in the year
1464.

Being seven years old sporting with his playfellows of the same age, he was
saluted Pope by them, all of them kissing his feet, as the Papists do the Popes.

Historians report the like of Ambrose, how he was made a Bishop being a boy by
his companions.

He was very Learned, an excellent Orator, a great Poet, Philosopher and
Cosmographer, he could speak eloquently. Magna quidem in dicendo Pii laus fuit,

Joannes Aepinus, a Learned Divine.

His several Works are mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

Aeschines the Orator, he was an Athenian, there was a great contest between
him and Demosthenes, Lecte sunt Orationes Aeschinis: quarum tres numero sunt,
and Epistolae novem. Nam Deliaca non est Aeschinis. In orationibus suavis,

Albertus Magnus, for his Learning and exact knowledge of all good Disciplines
he was surnamed Great. He left many Scholars and two principal ones among the
rest, Thomas de Aquino, and Bonaventure.

He died when he was fourscore years old. He left many Books which are now
Printed, and do much elucidate Philosophy and Divinity. Although he was as it
were the chief of the Schoolmen, yet he has some things not agreeable to the
Doctrine of the Papists.

Mr Seldom and Mr Gillespie cite his observations on Tertullian, and speak of
him as a great Antiquary.

This was his Epitaph, Clauditur hoc tumulo spina cui nomen ab Alba

Arias Montanus made these verses of him, Eloquio jus Romanum lucebat and art,

Our age (says Learned Pasquier Recherch. de la France, l. 9. chapter 30) brought
forth four great persons in the same time, Erasmus a Dutchman, Budeus a
Frenchman, Alciate an Italian, Vives a Spaniard: and yet we have with us (says
he) Adrian Turnebus and Peter Ramus, which last has made many Books full of
learning and knowledge; and for Turnebus his Adversaria consisting in Humanity,
it is a work unimitable in variety of knowledge. In his 29. chapter of that Book he
speaks of the Lawyers in the year 1500 which joined the study of the Law with
humane learning, where he makes honorable mention of also Budeus, Alciate,
Cujacius, and diverse others.

Stephanus Paschasius likewise in his Icones, has these verses of Erasmus,
Budaus and Alciate.

He was bred and taught under Aristotle, who Dedicated diverse Books of
Philosophy unto him: He was attended with Calisthenes, and diverse other learned
persons that followed him in Camp, and were his perpetual Associates in all
his travailes and conquests. He expostulates with Aristotle for publishing the
mysteries of Philosophy, and gave him to understand, That himself esteemd it
more to excel others in Learning and Knowledge, then in Power and Empire.

if he were not let by Wars and other great business, eight hours he spent in
Study and Learning, other eight hours he spent in Prayer and Almsdeeds, and
other eight hours he spent in his natural rest, sustenance of his body; and
the affairs of his Kingdom.

He was not only very Learned himself, but also a worthy maintainer of the same
through all his Dominions.

Thomas Allen, he has put out Notes on Chrysostem, and Sir Henry Savill often
styles him Doctissimum: he was skilled both in Greek and Divinity.

He much favored the wits of his age, and therefore he honorably maintained
at his Court Bartholomaeus Facius, Georgius Trapezuntius a Grecian, Laurentius
Valla, Antonius Panormitanus, and other Learned men in great number. His
virtues are most amply celebrated by Blondus, Sabellicus, Bernardinus Corius,
Antonius Panormitanus, Simoneta, and other Learned Writers.

A most excellent Philosopher and Astronomer as any of his time, a great lover
and advancer of Learning.

He was wont to say, Se malle privatim vivere, quam eruditione carere, he had
rather live privately then want learning, and that an unlearned King was but a
Crowned Ass.

When he was sick of a great disease, and his Physicians applied many medicines
in vain, he began to read the history of Curtius concerning Alexander, and was
so much delighted with it, that being restored to health he is reported to have
said, Valiant Avicenna, Hippocrates, medici caeteri: Vivat Curtius sospitator

He and Conradus Vorstius were Piscators Scholars; Piscator was wont to call
Alting Theologum optimum, Vorstius Pessimum.

Spinola invading the Palatinate, and the place taken where he remained, a
bloody fellow used these words to him with a Poleax in his hand, I have killed

Ambrose Bishop of Milane.

He hindered Theodosius the Emperor from entering into the Church, for a murder
committed at Thessalonica. To whom when the Emperor said, That David the King
was also an adulterer and manslayer, Ambrose answered, Qui secutus es errantem,
sequere poenitentem, Thou that have followed him sinning, follow him repenting.
Hence the Emperor underwent a public penance imposed upon him by the Bishop.
He stoutly defending the Catholic Faith and Ecclesiastical Discipline,
converted many Arians, and other heretics to the truth of the Faith.

It is reported of him, that when he was an Infant, a swarm of Bees settled on
his face, as he lay in his Cradle, and flew away without hurting of him,
whereupon his Father said, If this child live, he will be some great man.

He flourished anno Christi 361. Helv. Chron.

Cardinal Baronius at the commandment of Pope Sixtus, wrote St Ambrose his life
with all diligence. Before he was Bishop, he was a secular Judge, and no
Divine: nay, no Christian at all; but his Christianity and Divinity began both
together, after he was chosen Bishop of Milane. For, he was fain to be
Christened, before he could be consecrated. Bish. Andrews Answ. to the 20th Chapter

He wrote against the Friars and their hypocrisy, but especially against the

In his days there was a most detestable and blasphemous book set forth by the
Friars, which they called Evangelium aeternum, or, Evangelium Spiritus Sancti,
The Everlasting Gospel, or, The Gospel of the holy Ghost; it said, The Gospel
of Christ was not to be compared with that Gospel, no more then darkness to
light. That the Gospel of Christ should be preached but fifty years, and then
this Everlasting Gospel should rule the Church. He mightily impugned this
pestiferous Book. Foxes Act. and Monum. Tom. 1. p. 410. to 416.

Anselme.

There were two Anselmes, ours, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other of Laon
in France, Anselmus Landanensis, the Author of the interlineary gloss, who
lived anno Christi 1110.

I shall speak of the first who was an Italian.

Gente Italus Cantuariensis Archiepiscopus ex Regis Gulielmi secundi consensu
electus. Anni Christi 1093. Calvis. Chron. Lanfranci fuit discipulus in
monasterio Beccensi, in quo Abbatis munus cir^a annum 1080. administravit juxta
Sigebertum. Quarto post Lanfranci obitum anno in Cantuariensi Ecclesia a Rege
accitus ipsi successit anno 1094. Illyr. Caral. Test. veritat l. 12.
This Anselme though he was learned and continent all his life time, yet being
obstinate in his opinion, he often swerved from the truth and doctrine of
Christ, and rather loved the glory and vain fame of Christian praise, then
truth it self.

He first in England forbad Priests marriage.

He flourished in the year of our Lord 1080.

For his witty inventions, forecastings, policies, disputations and other
laborious affairs about the overthrow of princely Authority, and uprearing of
Antichrists tyranny, Pope Vrbanus appointed both him and them that should
afterward succeed in the Patriarchal seat of Canterbury to fit at his right
foot in every general Council, Bales English Volar^es. p. ^4.
and that he also ratified by a special decree. Thus it was proclaimed when
that place was given him, in the open Synod, Includamus hunc in orbonost^o
tanquam alterius orbis Papam.

He was the greatest Philosopher of his time. When he was going to make war
upon the Germans. the Philosophers generally came with Questions to him to
answer, least he dying in that expedition, they should be unresolved.

For his clemency and modest behavior he had the name of Pius, and is for the
same i^ Histories commended.

Antoninus of Florence. Anno aerae Christianae 161.

He has written three Tomes of Chronicles, and four Parts of Sums in great
Volumes.

Apollinaris the Syrian, was excellently skilled in the Greek Language. Sozomen
says, He wrote in Heroic verse the Antiquity of the Hebrews after the
imitation of Homer, even to the times of King Saul after the number of the
letters in 24 Volumes.

He translated also the Psalms in Heroic verse, which are yet extant.

He also imitating Menander, is said to have written Comedies, and Euripides,
Tragedies, and Pindar, Lyricks. Lil. Gyrald. De Poet. Histor. Dial. 5.

This Apollinaris brought in a new Heresy, those which follow him are called
Apollinarists, he held that Christ took the body but not the soul of a man, but
when he was urged with reasons he somewhat changed his opinion, says Ruffinus.
He lived from Constantine to the time of the elder Theodosius. Lil. Gyrald. De

He is the great Dictator of the Schools.

For his profound Learning and great piety, he is commonly called in the Popish
School Divus Thomas, because he was canonized by Pope John the 22. Doctor
Angelicus ob acumen ingenii.

He was a great maintainer of the Authority of the Bishops of Rome.

Upon whose Scholastical Works by Popish Divines, are published as many
Commentaries, as upon the holy Scripture, and his Sums are more frequently
read in their Schools and Academies, then the Bible it self; yet he when he was
near his end, taking the Bible, is said to have uttered this speech, Credo
quicquid in hoc libro scriptum est, I believe whatsoever is written in this
book.

It is said, he got his knowledge rather by prayer then labor and industry,
therefore he would still pray before he did write, read or dispute.

He was so intent upon his studies, that supping at Court with Lewis the French
King, whilst others were discoursing of pleasant matters, he was so deep in his
Meditation, that forgetting himself, he struck the Table with his hand, saying,
Jam conclusum est contra Manichaeos, Now it is concluded against the Manichees.

Stephanus Paschasius in his Icones, has these verses of Thomas Aquinas.

Cedite Pythagorae qui dogmata vana putatis;

God would have some singular, Idea, as it were, to be in all Arts, which all
that are studious of that Art should propound to themselves to imitate, as
Demosthenes and Tully in eloquence, Hippocrates and Galen in Physic,
Archimedes in the Mathematics. He had an admirable Genius or wit for the
Mathematics, and by study he perfected it. He did so bend his thoughts that
way, that he almost neglected other necessaries. If he were at any time led to
the Bath by his servants, he would make figures in the ashes, and upon his
anointed body. Ram. Schol. Mathem. l. 1. Ob deprehensum in aurea regis corona,

He is said to have composed a Sphere of transparent glass, representing unto
the life the whole frame of the Heavens, wherein the Sun, Moon and Stars, with

Among those famous Clerks that lived in the family of Richard Angervill Bishop
of Durham in the days of Edward the third, Thomas Bradwardine, who was
afterward Bishop of Canterbury, Richard Fitzrause afterward Archbishop of
Armagh, and Robert Holcot the Dominican were of special note. Richard of Armagh
my Contrymen commonly call S. Richard of Dundalk, because he was there born
and buried. B. Vsh. Answ. to the Jes. Challenge, of Merits.

He wrote against the Mendicant Friars, and should have been canonized, but for
them.

A man for his life and learning so memorable, as the condition of those days
then served; that the same days then as they had but few good, so had they
none almost his better. He was first brought up in the University of Oxford in
the study of all liberal knowledge, wherein he did exceedingly profit under
John Bakenthorp his Tutor. There were thirty thousand Students in Oxford in his
time. Foxes Act. and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 532. to 543.

He wrote seven Books De paupertate Salvatoris, wherein he proves that Christ
was not a beggar.

and at length his wife. Plut. in Pericles.

Angelus Politianus in an Epistle to Cassandra that learned Venetian maid,

Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria.

He was worthy in honor to be immortal in the Church according to his name.
Anno Dom. 340.366 says Helvicus in Chron. Moritur an. 877. Cum Episcopatum

cast out of Alexandria, he said to his hearers bewailing his exile, Bono animo
estote filioli nubecula est, brevi evanescet, Be of good courage my children,
it is but a little Cloud, and will soon vanish away.

He lived (say some) six years in a Well without the light of the Sun, forsaken
of friends, and every where hunted by enemies.

The Great Athanasius; he was Great, for his learning, for his virtue, for his
labor, and for his sufferings, but above all Great for his Yet some Learned

He was famous for two of his Works especially, his b Retractations, which are
the Confessions of his errors, and his Confessions, which are the
Retractations of his life.

In Ludovicus Vivet his time, there was none that. had imitated him in such a

His brother Angelus Perusinus almost equalled him both in Learning and
Writings in the same Faculty.

He flourished in the year of our Lord 1346.

He wrote Commentaries upon the whole body of the Civil Law, and after that he
professing the Civil Law for 47 years got a great fame.

But he was no Grecian, and is not much to be trusted; for

1. He makes use sometimes of spurious authors, and gives them for faithful
witnesses.

2. He endeavors by all means to advance the Popes Supremacy.

He is the Papists great Champion for Ecclesiastical history, as Bellarmine is
for Controversies; they esteemed him the Father of Church-story.

he) some would blame du Bartas his style as too swelling, yet his work has
been very well liked, not only for the worthy subject which he praises, but
also for his learning, fine Discourses, pithy strains, and proper deductions
which accompany it.

He was brother to Gregory Nyssene, and a most familiar friend (says Sixtus
Senensis loco citato) to Gregory Nazianzene, and John Chrysostom.

But he was before Chrysostom. He was called Basil the great for his admirable
wit, as Gregory Nazianzene for his excellent knowledge in the Scriptures was
termed the Divine.

His Hexameron is very much esteemed, followed so much by Ambrose. He was
honored by the Ancients with this Elogium (...).

He was the light of the Greek Church, whom the Heretics could never shake;
yea at whose virtue the hand of the Arian Emperor did shake, when he would
have subscribed to his banishment, and that in such sort that he left off his
purpose utterly.

Beda Venerabilis ob vitae modestiam nuncupatus. Fuit in Gentilium libris tam
plene exercitatus, ut eo seculo vix parem habuerit. Si Augustini, Hieronymi aut
Chrysostomi temporibus claruistet, non dubito quin potuisset de puritate cum
ipsis contendere quod inter tot superstitionum praestigias tam castos ediderit
faetus. Balaeus descript. Brit. Cent. 2da. Vir moderato sermon suae gentis res
gestas conscribens cui sane ob id plurimum debet posteritas, quod plurima scitu

BEda was an English man, born not far from Dyrrham: He was the Learnedest
man of his time, skillfull in Divine and Secular Learning.

Of his rare learning and knowledge his Writings yet extant are a clear and
sufficient testimony. He was so great a follower of St Augustine (the worthiest
Pillar of the Church since the Apostles time, as some hold) that his
Commentaries upon the Scripture, both of Old and New Testament, are almost word
for word out of St Augustine.

He was a continual Preacher, as his Homilies do testify.

He was usually called Venerable Bede, but why, the Monks usque ad ineptias
certant, as Lilius Gyraldus says, De Poet. Hist. Dial. 5. Some of the reasons
given for that title are ridiculous. One says, Pietate and eruditione
venerabilis cognomen adeptus est. He was called Venerable for his Piety and
Learning. Others say he was called Venerable, because that was the title of
Presbyter, and his Homilies were read in his life time, and they calling him
then not Saint but Venerable, so called him after his death. Vide Trithem. de
Script. Eccles.

Sedulius is likewise styled Venerabilis.

Beda's Works were printed in three Tomes at Paris, An. 1545. and in eight
Tomes at Basil, Anno Domini 1563. in Folio, containing four great Volumes.

In omni disciplinarum genere, Graecae etiam atque Latinae linguae gnarus
excelluit: Poeta, licet mediocris, Rhetor, Historicus, Astronomus,
Arithmeticus, Cosmographus, Philosophus, Theologus, ita eo tempore mirabilis,

Coringius in his 3d Dissertat. de Antiq. Acad. says it is observable, Sexto

Hispaniam (uno verbo) in occidentalis Ecclesiae toto orb, nomen aliquod
scripto libro invenisse, qui non in Monasterio educatus sit atque institutus.
Qui inter Britannicos Monachos eminet Beda, idem omnium illius tempestatis per
occidentem universum fuit doctissimus. Nos ipsi Germani prima Christianae
doctrinae exordia illis caenobitis debemus. Imo debemus illis initia omnis

Rob. Bellarmine was born in Politian, Anno Dom. 1542. Natione Italus, scripsit
de Controversiis Christianae fidei adversus sui temporis Haereticos. Cardinalis
Perronius pluris asserit a se illud fieri, quam ullum opus aliud quod vel ab
annis mill sit editum pro Ecclesiae defensione. Cardinalis Baronius censet
esse propugnaculum and Turrim David, ex qua mill Clypei pendent, and omnis
armatura fortium. In Angliae Academiae Cantabrigiensi primum mox etiam in
Oxoniensi nova praelectio instituta est, ad Controversias Bellarmini, si
possent, refellendas Bibliotheca Scriptorum Socie^at. Jesu a Philippo Alegambe
edita Vir erat admirandae industriae, doctrinae, lectionis stupendae
Bellarminis: quo ut primus, ita solus immanem illam molem and immensum chaos
Controversiarum, stupenda ingenii dexteri faelicitate, artificio singulari
excoluit, inordinem redegit confusum prius: accurata diligentia and multorum
annorum studio eleganter expolivit: praeripuit ille palmam secuturis omnibus
and sibi desponsam vel destinatam cuicunque laudem abstulit. Nam ab illo qui
tractant hodie Controversias, ut ab Homero Poetae, sua fere omnia mutuantur.
Montac. praefat. ad Apparatum.


He and Tolet, and of late Lugo only were made Cardinals of the Jesuits.

Mutius Vitelliscus persuading Bellarmine to write his own life (as Fuligat
reports) at last prevailed with him: He has this passage there, De virtutibus
suis nihil dixit, quia nescit, an ullam vere habeat: De vitiis tacuit, quia non
sunt digna quae scribantur, and utinam de libro Dei deleta inveniantur in die
Judicii.

Possevine in his Biblioth. Select. tomo 1o l. 7. c. 4. says of his four Tomes
of Controversies, Opus absolutissimum, quod Controversiarum ferme omnium corpus
dici queat.

Gretser in his Preface to his Defense of Bellarmines Controversies also highly
magnifies him.

Cardinal D' Ossat in his fifth book of French Letters says thus of him, Est
celuy qui a faict ^et oeuure incomparable des Controverses pour la Religion
Catholic, contre toutes les heresies qui sont auiourd' huyr and qui ont este
au temps pass; and nostre saint Pere le faisant Cardinal a voulu honorer tant
la virtue, and doctrine, and labeur de ce personnage, que le College des
Cardinaux. It is he which has made this Incomparable work of Controversies for
the Catholic Religion, against all the heresies of this day and of times past;
and our holy Father in making him Cardinal, would herein honor, both the
Virtue, Learning, and Labor of this Person, and the College of Cardinals.

He has written a book of Epistles, and twelve books of the Venetian Histories,
a book de imitatione sermonis, and Poems.

Beza has this Epigram upon his history of Venice: Clara urbi Venetum debes

Vrbs eadem clara est munere, Bembe, tuo.
Tu patria foelix, foelix te patria Cive,
Bembe tamen debet patria plura tibi.
Nam mortale fuit patria quod nounus habebat:
At, quam das patriae, vita perennis erit.


He was a Venetian, and a Cardinal: his Life is written by Johannes Casa. His
style is disliked by Lipsius and others.

It is no marvel if Lipsius disliked his style, it being nothing like his own,
but he was a great Ciceronian, as also was Sadoletus the Cardinal his great
friend, and above them both, he who was familiar with them both, Longolius.

Peter Bembus is reported to have said (witness George Fabricius and Alexander
of Hales in his Commentary upon the 2d of Tim.) Semel legi Biblia. Quod si
iterum mihi essent legenda, perderem omnem Latinitatem.

they were thought to have some familiarity with those which differ from the
Roman Religion. The same has Boissard in his Bibliotheca or Icones.

R. Benjamin a famous Jewish Geographer. Benjamin Judaeus, Hebraeus, Hispanus,
itinerarium suum Hebraice descripsit, edi^um superioribus annis a Benedicto

emensus notatis itineribus, quas vel ipse vidit, vel a fide dignis suae aetatis
hominibus accepit, breviter atque dilucide, ac sic descripsit, ut appareat

and the first that was counted an heretic for denying of Transubstantiation,
and troubled for the same.

When he had professed the truth of the Sacrament, and had stood in the open
confession thereof, according to the ancient verity of the Church before, he
was so handled with certain malignant and superstitious Monks, that partly by
evil entreaty, and partly for fear of death (such is the weak frailty of man)
he began to shrink, and afterward did indeed recant the truth. Foxes Act. and

Bernard was Abbot of Claravon in the year 1108. of whom sprang the Bernardine
Monks. 1130. Utinam tales Papistas multos, imo vel unum talem hodie haberemus
in toto regno Pontificio, qualem Bernardum, fuisse constat. Ita sanc, ita
solid disputat ille de summis fidei Capitibus, de Scripturis, de Ecclesia, de
hominis miseria, de gratuita justificatione, de gratia, de nova obedientia, cum
Catholica Ecclesia contra Tridentinas fabulas, ut nihil solidius quaeri possit.
Number ergo Papista fuerat, qui contra Jesuitas, contra Tridentinos, in maximis
fidei articulis Ecclesiam Catholicam and Patrum consensum sequitur? Dicam
aperte quod res est. Bernardus Romani Pontificis jurisdictionem long supra
omnes superiores Patres extulit. Atque hinc est, quod Papista vocetur a
Bellarmino. Nam Cyprianus, Augustinus, Ambrosius, aliique superiores Romani
Pontificis jurisdictionem cohibuerunt. Bernardus autem incidit in fatalia illa
tempora, ultra annum millesimum, Satana jam soluto. Itaque quod cohibere non
potuit, tulit ut potuit. Nam post annum millesimum multi viri sancti Romani

who lived in the Monastery of Corbey, whereof Paschasius Rabertus was Abbot.

He joined with Rabanus in refuting the error of the carnal presence, at the
first bringing in thereof by Paschasius Rabertus. The book which he wrote de
Corpore and Sanguine Christi to Carolus Calvus the Emperor, was forbidden to
be read, by order from the Roman Inquisition, confirmed afterward by the
Council of Trent. The Divines of Doway perceiving that the forbidding of that
book did not keep men from reading it, but gave them rather occasion to seek
more earnestly after it, thought it better policy that Bertram should be
permitted to go abroad, but handled in such sort, as other ancient Writers that
made against them were wont to be. B. Vsh. Answ. to the Jes. Challenge, p. 18,
19.

He speaks of him also in his Goteschalcus, c. 11. p. 175, 176. and mentions
there another book of Bertrams, de Nativitate Christi, in which he defends the
same doctrine which he delivered in his book de Corpore and Sanguine Domini.

Theodore Beza, Anno mundi 5661.

His translation of the New Testament, and his accurate Notes upon it have made
him famous. Beza edidit Psalterium suum jucundum opus and utile. Venerandus
senex, Theodorus Beza, cum per longinquitatem aetaris factus sit obliviosus

His French Psaltery was so well liked, that it was well translated into the
Germane, Bohemian, English, Scottish, and many Languages, and all the Orthodox
Churches use it, and much esteem it.

He lived 86 years, and toward his later end began to forget what he had
spoken. He would (says Thuanus) repeat whole Psalms in Hebrew, and what ever
Chapter one could name out of Paul's Epistles, he would rehearse it all in
Greek, for the things he had formerly learned his judgment failed him not, but
he presently forgot what he had spoken.

His French Works are mentioned by Verdier in his Bibliotheque. His Latin are
known.

Biblia Hebraica, vulgo Complutensia in six Volumes, the Chaldee, Greek and
Latin Interpretations being added, by Cardinal Ximenes Archbishop of Toledo,
published in the year of Christ 1515, a little before Luther, an excellent
work, which made way for the Gospel, since both the original languages of the
Bible, before only in the hands of the Jews and Grecians, were now generally
made known.

with a threefold Latin Interpretation, the first of which is the vulgar, and
is annexed to the Hebrew Text, the second and third answer to the Greek Text
and Chaldee Paraphrase.

In the fifth Volume the New Testament is contained, in Greek and Syriack with
a double Latin Interpretation, Benedicti Ariae Montani studio opera and labor

one of which is the vulgar, the other expresses the propriety of the Syriack
Text, being written by Guido Fabricius Boderianus, one very skillful in the
Syriack.

In the sixth, seventh and eight Tomes is the Apparatus Sacer. In the sixth the
Old Testament in Hebrew with the Latin Interpretation of Pagnine and Arias
Montanus, and the New in Greek with the vulgar Latin Interpretation, and the
other of Arias Montanus.

In the seventh Tome the Grammatical precepts of the Languages, and the
Dictionaries of them, Hebrew, Syriack, Chaldee, and Greek are contained.

In the eight and last Tome, there are singular Books of Arias Montanus his,
and the Variae Lectiones gathered by the most learned with greatest study, with
two Indexes.

Since that, came out Jay the Advocates Bible in France, who has been at great
charge in printing the Bible in Hebrew, and in other oriental Languages,
wherein there are two Volumes supernumerary, which have the Samaritane
Pentateuch, and a Translation of it, a Syriack Translation of the Old
Testament, and an Arabic Translation of the whole Bible, with Latin
Translations to each of them, but it has not the Interlineary, nor any
Apparatus.

It is very corruptly printed.

Now there is here printing in England a Bible, which will exceed the French
Bible, because it sets forth all uno conspectu, whereas that is in several
Volumes, Versiones antiquae praesertim Orientales, tum ratione affinitatis quam
habent cum linguis originalibus, tum authoritatis and usus generalis in
primaeva Ecclesia optima sunt media ad verum loci sensum in obscuris

and has the best Editions of each, the vulgar Latin of Clement the 8th, and
the LXX of Sixtus Quintus their authentic Editions, and it has the variety of
readings of the Alexandrian Copy on the LXX in the Margent, the Chaldee
Paraphrase of Buxtorfs Edition.

It has also the Interlineary Translation of the Hebrew Bible, and the
Ethiopick Translation of the New Testament. Some emendations of the Latin
Translation, of the Samaritane Pentateuch, and in the Apparatus, the variety of
readings of all the Texts.

There are Biblia Hebraica with the Targum, and diverse Commentaries of the

Possevine dislikes his Methodus Historica, because he makes such honorable
mention of the Protest^^^s there.

Voetius in his Biblioth. l. 2. Sect. prior. c. 1. condemns Possevines
Bibliotheca, as maimed, because out of his envy and pretended hatred against
heresy, he passes by many excellent Authors.

Some commend his Theatrum Naturae for a choice piece, a Book full of natural
curiosities.

Tycho Brahe l. 1. De nova Stella. c. 10. charge him with gross errors in
matters of History.

His Parents were rather good then great. What liberal Education they bestowed
on him, he shows in his own Life written in English by himself, which is put
into Latin by Dr Hackwell, and is in Oxford Library. He living in the
troublesome times of Queen Mary, his Parents took him beyond Sea.

At Genevah he heard Beroaldus for Greek, Cevallerius for Hebrew, in Divinity
Calvin and Beza.

He was very skillful in the Oriental Tongues. Linguarum Orientalium
callentissimus vir Thomas Bodlaeus. Drus. Not. in Tetragram. He was the great
Founder of our famous Oxford Library, which is therefore called Bibliotheca
Bodleiana. He gave many Hebrew Books to the Library, and was employed in many
honorable Embassies to the Kings of France and Denmark, the Lantgrave of
Hesse, the Duke of Brunswick, Quae libuit ludere in poesi divina plane sunt,

He gave for his Arms three Crowns, with this Inscription, Quarta perennis erit.

Boethius Severinus. Anno Dom. 520.

Thevet Vies des hommes Illustres l. 6. mentions the several names given to
him, and the reasons of them. He was called Severinus, to show his Cato like
severity and integrity. He was very famous in his days, being Consul a long
time at Rome, and a man of rare gifts and abilities. Some say, in prose he gave
not place to Tully, and had none that exceeded him for Poetry; a great
Philosopher, Musician, Mathematician.

He was put to death by King Theodoricus King of the Goths.

He was a most excellent Peripatetick, after he was slain Peripatetick
Philosophy decayed, and almost all Learning in Italy. Barbarism wholly invaded
it, and expelled good Arts and Philosophy out of its borders, says Heereboord

He has published some Notes upon Chrysostom, which are in the eighth Volume
upon Chrysostom, put out by Sir Henry Savill, who calls him, Ingeniosissimum
and doctissimum Boisium, and styles his Notes, Doctissimas ejus Observationes.

He says thus to Sir Henry Savill in his Notes, upon Chrysostoms Homilies upon
Genesis, Emendationes enim omnes quas affero, meae sunt conjecturae, and
fortasse multis in locis parum probabiles nec satis site confictae. Sed ut non
omnes dignas existimo, quae eruditorum calculis approbentur: ita nonnullas,

death) in a Letter,

as by the resolution of the Queen, provoked against him, because the Lutherans
did divulge in many Writings and Libels spread abroad, that the King had been
wounded in the eye by the providence of God, for a punishment for his words
used against du Bourg, that he would see him burnt. But the death and constancy
of a man so conspicuous, did make many curious to know what Religion that was,
for which he had so courageously endured punishment, and made the number
increase. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent. l. 5. p. 418.

THomas de Vio Cajetanus, an Italian and a Cardinal.

A man very well read in Divinity, having studied it even from a child, who
for the happiness of his wit, and for his laborious diligence, became the prime
Divine of that and many more ages, unto whom there was no Prelate or person in
the Council who would not yield in Learning, or thought himself too good to
learn of him.

This Cardinal, going Legate to Germany in the year 1523. studying exactly how
those that erred might be reduced to the Church, and the Arch-heretiques
convinced, found out the true remedy, which was, the literal meaning of the
text of the Scripture in the Original Tongue in which it was written, and all
the residue of his life, which was 11 years, he gave himself to the study of
the Scripture, expounding not the Latin Translation, but the Hebrew Roots of
the Old, and the Greek of the New Testament. In which Tongues, having no
knowledge himself, he employed men of understanding, who made construction of
the Text unto him word by word, as his Works upon the holy Texts do show. That
good Cardinal was wont to say, that to understand the Latin text, was not to
understand the infallible Word of God, but the word of the Translator, subject
and obnoxious unto error. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, l. 2. p. 155.

Steven Pasquier a French Writer and a Papist does much extol his Piety, Wit

He was a good Writer both in Latin and French, and one to whom our French
Language is exceedingly obliged, for having enriched it with many good
Treatises; and I would they had been upon a better subject. He was marvellously
versed and skilled, in the books of the holy Scripture, and such a one that if
he had turned his spirit the good way, he might have been set for a Paragon of
the most famous Doctors of the Church. This and more he has there of him.

I willingly acknowledge him to have been an excellent instrument in the Church
of God, and a man of a deep judgment, specially in the Exposition of holy
Scripture (which I think none condemn more then those who have read him least)
yet withal I freely confess he had his errors. Dr Hackw. Apol. l. 5.

His Works have been so profitable to the Church of God that they have been in
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Transylvania, Polonia, England, Scotland. His
Institutions and Commentaries upon almost all the Scripture, are generally well

History of the Romans in Britain, and many other things most worthy to be
known, gathered summarily out of the incorrupt Monuments of ancient Antiquity.

His Annals also of the English and Irish affairs in the Reign of Q Elizabeth,
are excellent.

He was Schoolmaster of Westminster School, and his Monument is in Wesiminster

He lost a Scholars place in Oxford in Queen Mary's days, because of his

Carolus quintus, King of France.

He reigned about the year of our Lord 1360. He was called Charles the Wise,
for his great Wisdom and Piety, and especially because he caused the holy
Scriptures to be translated into the Vulgar Language, that the common people
might understand them. Illyr. Catal. Test Verit.

Princeps praeclara indole and magnis virtutibus praeditus, nisi quatenus eas

and in pensitandis cujusque meritis morositas; ut ab aulicis virtutes ad
inexhaustas capiditates suas metientibus minus ob id liberalis

His Life is written by Papyrius Massonius.

He was a Prince that had excellent natural gifts, but mingled with vices,
wherewith his Governors and Schoolmasters had corrupted his young mind, which
at the first was more virtuously inclined, delighting in Music and Poetry. But
as he was a great Hunter, that loved to shed the blood of wild beasts, so he
suffered also (during his reign) the Protestants blood to be shed, and in
revenge thereof of in his sickness before his death, great store of blood
issued out by vomiting, and by other passages of his body in the two last weeks
of his sickness, wherein he endured as much pain and torment, as the strength
of youth could suffer in the last pangs of death.

Andrew Melvin has these verses to Charles the 9th, dying with an unusual
flux of blood, Naribus, ore, oculis, atque auribus; undique, and ano,
Et pene erumpit qui tibi, Carle, cruor.
Non tuus iste cruor sanctorum at caede cruorem
Quem ferus hausisti, concoquere hand poteras.

great abilities.

Christopher Cartwright.

A Learned, Pious Divine of Peter-house in Cambridge, not only well skilled in
the three Learned Languag^s, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, but also well versed in
the Hebrew Rabbis, for which he is honorably mentioned by Voetius in the last
Edition of his Bibliotheca, and his Annotations on Genesis and Exodus are well
liked by the Learned generally. Mr Pocok styles him Virum eruditssimum, in not.

He has explained this question, Vtrum Reges vel Principes jure aliquo, and

John de Casa Archbishop of Benevent.

He wrote a Book in Italian rhyme, wherein he praises and exalts that
horrible sin of Sodomitry, and names it a Divine work, Joannes Casa
Archiepiscopus Beneventanus, Pontificis apud Venetos legatus, horrendo scelere,
plus quam detestanda impudentia, id celebrare est ausus; quod nefando quidem

and affirms he took great pleasure therein.

He has written the life of Bembus and Gasp. Contarenus.

Then the question was (says Thuanus) concerning Claudius Espencaeus a Divine
of Paris, and John Case the Popes Secretary, about making them Cardinals:
Nobleness of birth and learning, commended both of them, although different,
for one of them being brought up in the study of Divinity, grew old in his
profession, the other in eloquence and in the skill of writing elegant Latin,
was to be compared with the Ancients; but their manners were very different,
Espencaeus excelled in holiness of life and chastity of manners, but Casa in
licentiousness, and using the liberty of the place in which he lived, he led
his life wantonly, therefore both of them were accused to the Pope by their
Competitors; Espencaeus, that he had in a Sermon spoken disgracefully of the
golden Legend, as they commonly call it, and that he said it was rather to be
called an iron Legend, and afterward he was compelled publicly to recant, as
Sleyden relates, the other because he was reported in his youth in verse to
have praised that which is abominable, and so for several causes, both of them
lost that dignity.

Jo. Casus, a Learned Oxonian.

He has put out Ethics and Politics and other Works.

another, his Theophrastus his Charecters. It were no difficult task out of
Scaligers Epistles, to excerpe Elogies upon most of Casaubons Works.

He was a man of such note and eminency in his time, that two Emperors, viz.

as a man most meet to compose (if it might be) the difference betwixt
Protestants and them of the Church of Rome, as Dr Featly has observed.

writes a whole Epistle in her commendation.

He begins it thus,

O Decus Italiae virgo: quas dicere grates: quasve refer parem: quod etiam
honor me tuarum literarum non dedignaris: mira profecto fides: tales
proficisci a foemina: quid autem a foemina dico: immo vero a puella, and
virgin potuisse.

Again, At vero aetate nostra: qua pauci quoque virorum caput al^ius in literis
extulerunt: unicam te tamen existere puellam: quae pro lana librum: pro fuso
calamum: stylum pro acu tractes.

Afterward, Scribis Epistolas Cassandra subtiles: acutas: elegantes: latinas:
and quanquam puellari quadam gratia: virginali quadam simplicitate dulcissimas:
tamen etiam mire graves and Cordatas. Orationem quoque tuam legimus eruditam:
locupletem: sonoram: illustrem: plenamque laetae indolis. Sed nec extemporalem

Friar Dominicus Soto, who had a great part in the Synod of Trent, in framing
the Decrees of Original sin, and Justification, having noted all the
opinions and reasons used in those Discussions, thought to communicate them
unto the world, and to draw the words of the Decree to his own meaning, printed
a Book containing the whole together, and did entitle it De Natura and Gratia,
and did Dedicate it with an Epistle to the Council, to be (as he said in the
Dedication) a Commentary of the two foresaid Decrees. Coming to the Article of
the certainty of grace, he said in a long Discourse, that the Synod had
declared, that a man cannot know he has grace by so great Certainty, as is
that of Faith, excluding all doubt. Catarinus newly made Bishop of Minori,
having defended the contrary, and still persevering, did print a little book,
with an Epistle Dedicatory to the same Synod; the scope whereof was, to
maintain that the Councels meaning was not to condemn the opinion of him that
says A just man may know he has grace, as certainly as he knows the
Articles of Faith to be true: yea that the Council has decided that he is
bound to believe it, because in the 26 Canon it has condemned him that faith,
That the just man ought not to hope for and expect a reward, it being
necessary, that he that ought to hope as a just man, should know he is so. In
this contrariety of opinions, both writing affirmatively to the Council;
either of them did not only say that his opinion was the opinion of the Synod,
but afterward wrote also and Printed Apologies and Antipologies, making
complaints to the Synod the one of the other, of attributing that to it, which
it never said, bringing diverse testimonies of the Fathers to prove their own
opinion: who bare witness some for one, some for another. This seemed to put
all men out of hope to understand the meaning of the Council, seeing the
principal men that were present in it did not agree. History of the Con^c. of

and truly fearing God (says Melchior Adam in vita Wigandi) have with Sturmius
approved that Ecclesiastical History, and to this day approve it, because they
see an Idea as it were of the Church of Christ in its several Centuries
contained in it, according to its propagation, persecution, tranquillity,
doctrine, heresy, Ceremonies, Government, schisms, Synods, persons, miracles,
Martyrdoms, the Religion out of the Church and Politic State of the Empire.

He was killed at Mountaban with a Canon-bullet (which had a C. on it) on the

it was his day of repose or rest, and so it proved, though he meant it in
another sense.

Sir John Cheek. He was Schoolmaster to King Edward the 6th, and most skillful
in Greek and Latin.

He was Public Orator, and Greek Reader in Cambridge. In the discharge of
the later he went over Sophocles twice, all Hom^^, all Euripides, and part of
Herodotus.

Roger Ascham in the first Book of his Epistles, speaking of him and Sir Thomas
Smith, says, Qui si adscribendum se dedissent, nec in Sadoleto Italia, nec in
Longolio Gallia, justius, quam in istis duobus Anglia gloriata fuisset.

He was the first Regius Professor of the Greek Tongue in Cambridge, as Sir
Thomas Smith was of Law. They were both Fellows of the same College, both
Professors in the same University, both Officers of State in the same Court,
both wrote De pronunciatione linguae Graecae. They two especially by their
advice and example brought the study of Tongues, and other politer Learning
first into request in Cambridge.

Under God Sir John Cheek was a special instrument of the propagation of the
Gospel, Dr L. in the life of Sir John Cheek.
and that religion which we now profess in this Kingdom. For he not only sowed
the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince Edward, which afterward grew
up into a general Reformation, when he came to be King, but by his means the
same saving truth was gently instilled into the Lady Elizabeth, by those who by
his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of her younger stud^.

In Henry the eighths time his friends and familiars were most of those worthy
men which proved Reformers in King Edwards days, and either Martyrs or exiles
in Queen Mary's. His foreign acquaintance were Sleidan, Melancthon, Sturmius,
Bucer, Camerarius, Celius, Peter Martyr, and others, great Scholars, and good
Protestants.

He went into Low-Germany, Vt uxorem educeret, says Sleiden, to fetch his wife
from thence. These words were corrupted into Vxorem duceret by Thuanus and
others, for he was married before.

In his return from Bruxwels to Antwerp he was apprehended by a Provost-Martial
from King Philip, and so conveyed speedily away to the Tower of London. He
was there by threatenings, and other ways brought to a recantation, for which
he was after much troubled, and so died.

Sir John Cheeks Works were,

He was born in Arpinum.

He propounded to himself Demosthenes for a pattern to imitate, whence he was
called the Roman Demosthenes.

Some think that he exceeds Demosthenes, and Virgil Homer.

Oratores vero vel praecipue Latinam eloquentiam parem facere Graecae possunt.
Nam Ciceronem cuicunque eorum fortiter opposuerim. Ille se profecisse sciat,

He compares there Tully and Demosthenes, and concludes, Salibus certe and
commiseratione qui duo plurimum affectus valent vincimus. Quid quod and Cicero
dissimilimus Demosthenis: Nihil enim adjici alteri: Nihil alteri detrahi
potest: videlicet orationis ille succus alteri quidem pene deest: alteri vero
quasi superfluit. Polit. l. 5. Epist. Ep. 1.

concerning the Latin Tongue, the first of Etymology, the other of Analogy. See

Some therefore prefer his Philosophical Works.

His Offices was the first book that was printed, and an excellent piece.

Liber non suo pretio habitus ideo quod omnium manibus teritur. Grotii Ep. ad
Gallos.

His Epistles ad Atticum are an excellent History of those times. Anima

He set himself to imitate the Grecians, he expresses the form of Demosthenes,
the copiousnesse of Plato, the pleasantness of Isocrates, says Quintilian in
the place before-cited. Repetitio quaedam and geminatio verborum: idem
significantium, Ciceroni familiaris est ac prope perpetua: Hanc ubertatem and
copiam laudo: commutatis verbis; variatis figuris, quo magis res imprimatur in
animis, nonnunquam in eadem sententia commoratur orator: majoris hujus
impressionis commorationem probo: interdum alio loco dicta nulla nova ratione
denuo reponit: id neque laudo nequis probo. Rami Ciceronianus. Si quicquam in
Cicerone Ciceroniano maxim cavendum ^ugiendumque sit, ista sane jactantia est,
quia maxim animos audientium laedit: maximeque illud quicquid dicendo petitur,
amittit. Id. ibid. Vide Quintil. Instit. Orat. l. 10. c. 1.


His Repetitions without any Reason sometimes are disliked by Ramus, and his
vainglorious boasting.

O fortunatam natam me Consule Romam:
Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea linguae.
Yet Turnebus in his 7th book of his Adversaria, c. 19. both defends Tully, and
that former verse.

Versus ille Ciceronis, qui obtrectatorum ejus and invidorum virulentos morsus
excitavit in ipsum. O fortunatam natam me Consule Romam. hanc opinor sententiam
centinet, foelicem illo Reipublicae statu Romam fuisse, quam constituerat
confirmaratque in Consulatu, optimatum enim potestatem and Senatus auctoritatem
stabilierat, and cum principibus conjunxerat equites. Neque vero est cur vel a
Quintil. lib. 9. c. 4. vel Juven. Sat. 19. versus irrideatur ob iterationem
earundem syllabarum, hoc enim veteres in deliciis habebant, ut Maro 3. Aeneid.

-- tales casus Cassandra canebat. Many which strive to imitate Tully, differ
much from him, and among themselves.

Aspice nunc eos homines: qui sibi elegerunt Marcum Tullium imitandum: quantum

He lived about the year 200, viz. in the beginning of the third Age or
Century. Calvis. in his Chronology says, he flourished in the year of Christ
194.

He wrote a little after the death of Commodus. He abounded in all sacred and
exotic knowledge to a miracle, and those many excellent Monuments of his wit
which are published, he does imbellish with much learning and many testimonies
of Christians, Philosophers, and also Heretics.

as his fellow-worker, Phil. 4.3.

He was a good Linguist, most skillful in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin Tongues,
and taught them all with praise at Lovain, to which that he might add the
profession of the Arabic, he traveled almost ten years.

In his youth he served Charles Duke of Burgundy, and afterward Lewis the 11th
of that name King of France, who employed him in his weightiest and secretest
affairs. The French Tongue he spoke perfectly and eloquently, the Italian,
Dutch and Spanish reasonably well.

He has written the History of France under Lewis the 11th and Charles the 8th
his Son.

He was the Spectator and actor of his History.

Nothing more grieved him, then that in his youth he was not trained up in the
Latin Tongue, which his misfortune he often bewailed. The Emperor Charles the
fifth, and Francis the first King of France made so great account of this
History, that the Emperor carried it continually about with him, and the King
was much displeased with the publishing thereof.

COncilia Councels.

There were six Ecumenical Councels, orthodox, and almost received by all.

Bishop Andrews in his Sermon on Numb. 10. v. 1, 2. reckons up seven. See that
Sermon.

The first Nicene Council called by the Emperor Constantine the Great against
Arius, who denied the Deity of Christ. This was held in the year of our Lord
325. at Nice in Bithinia. It consisted of 318 Bishops. The Fathers of that
Council did publish a Creed against the Arians.

The greatest of all Councels next to the Apostles Council, the great Council
of Nice of 318 Bishops.

Urbs Nicaea clara a Synodo Nicaena, quo coacti a Magno Constantino primo
Christiano Imperatore convenerunt contra Arium Alexandrinum in Aegypto Diaconum

Geog. part 2da. Vide Aug. Roch. Biblioth. Vatic. p. 58. to 75. of all these
Councels.

The first Constantinopolitan Council called by the Emperor Theodosius the
elder against Macedonius, who denied the Deity of the holy Ghost, in the year
of the Lord 383, or 384.

The first Ephesine Council called by Theodosius the younger against Nestorius,
who held, That there were two persons in Christ, in the year 430, or 434.

4. The Chalcedonian Council called by the Emperor Martian against Eutyches,
which affirmed. That there was only one Nature in Christ after the
Incarnation, in the year of the Lord 451, or as some 452, and others 454.

To these two other Councels are added, the fifth, the second
Constantinopolitan, in the year 548, or as others reckon it 553. called by
Justinian against the Arians, Nestorians, Eutychians.

The sixth is the third Constantinopolitan Council against the Monethelites, in
the year 681, called by Constantinus Pognatus or Barbarus.

For the Council of Trent Extat refutatio Concilii Tridentini a Martino

The Tridentine Council was celebrated in the City of Trent in the year 1546.
under Pope Paul the third. Between the first and last Session of the Council of
Trent were eighteen years. All the Articles of the Popish Doctrine were
confirmed in it. Historia Concilii Tridentini Petri Suavis, l. 6. Cujus

a blasphemous Proverb was generally used, That, The Synod of Trent was guided
by the holy Ghost sent thither, from time to time in a Cl^^^-bag from Rome.

In this mock-Councel, the Pope which was the principal party accused of
Heresy, was the only Judge and disposer of all things passed therein against
all good Examples, Laws, Equity and Reason.

Though the Council of Trent has been sufficiently answered by the Protestant
Divines, yet that excellent History of the Council of Trent was never answered
by the Papists.

In the Council of Constance Communion under both kinds, and Wickliffs
opinions were condemned.

John Hus and Jerome of Prague were burned against faith given, and safe conduct
granted by the Emperor. Then that wicked maxim was established, Haereticis
fides non est seruanda, which is against Nature, Scripture, and the Law of
Nations.

There is Summa Conciliorum and Pontificum a Petro usque ad Concilium
Tridentinum per Bartholomaeum Caranzam Ord. praedicat. 1600. Lugduni.


The National Synod of Dort began in the year 1618. To which were sent from
England, France, Germany, and other Reformed Churches, many Learned and
Orthodox Divines, to discuss and unfold those unhappy Arminian Controversies
with which the Low Countries was then molested.

The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been
long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countries, States and Kingdoms
where these Churches are, are now of late very profitably published to the just
conviction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably
distracted and rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith.

Beza has put out the Harmony of Confessions with Notes upon it.

The most famous is the Augustane Confession.

The Elector of Saxony with the other Princes and Protestant Cities joined with
him, presented to the Emperor Charles the fifth, the Confession of their
Faith, written in Latin and Dutch, which afterward from this place, where it
was read was called Augustana. It contained two parts: in the first was
expounded one and twenty Articles of their Creed. In the second were expounded
the Doctrines which were different from the Church of Rome, and the abuses
which the Confessionists reproved. The Cities which followed the Doctrine of
Zuinglius, presented apart the Confession of their Faith, not differing from
the former, but only in the point of the Eucharist. History of the Council of
Trent, translated by Sir Nathan. Brent, l. 1. p. 54. See Sleid. Comment. lib.
7. and Melch. Ad. in vita Brentii.

Conformities. This holy Book of Conformities, and St. Francis life is in
English, so B. Down. of Antichrist, and Crashaw in his Jesuits Gospel, though
I cannot purchase it.

Crashaw also speaks largely of it in his Sermon preached at Paul's Cross 9th
wound.




There was printed at Bononia in Italy, Anno 1590. a book entitled, Liber
Conformitatum Beati ac Seraphici Patris Francisci, written by one Bartholomeus
Pisanus a Franciscan Friar, and published by one Hieronymus Buchius, of which
book it is affirmed in the Title page, that it is Liber Aureus, a golden book.

There he paints a tree; at the top whereof is Christ, and at the root St
Francis: the tree has twenty branches on the right, and twenty on the left
side, and every branch has four particular fruits; in all eighty: These are
equally divided between Christ and St Francis, forty to the one, and forty to
the other, and each couple or pair of these is one point of Conformity between
Christ and St Francis, consisting in all upon forty particulars, wherein they
begin at the birth, and the conception, nay at the very Prophecies and Promises
made of Christ, and so proceed to his life, his death, his resurrection and
ascension: and in all, and every of these, and every thing else whatsoever may
be said of Christ, the very same do they not shame to affirm of that man
Francis.

This was not the superfluity of idle and superstitious Monks brains, but the
public Act of their Church, and many Popes one after another allowed it, and
by their Charters have confirmed the truth of this Story.

Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, Martyr.

He died a Martyr anno 1556 Cranmer a furtherer of learning and godliness.
He was the first Archbishop of Canterbury that cast off Antichrist.

As Britain was most blessed under Edward the sixths Reign, so much by his
means.

That he might settle the Doctrine of the Gospel in both the Universities, he
sent for the most famous Divines out of foreign Naions, and drew them into
England, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Fagius, Lascus, Immanuel Tremellius, Bernardus
Ochinus, All which with their wives and children were liberally maintained by
him.

This way he spent his yearly revenew, so that nothing remained to himself.

He studied the Scriptures diligently and wrote against that gross opinion of
the Papists, affirming the carnal presence of Christ in the Sacrament, His
English Books are mentioned by Andrew Maunsel in his Catalogue of English books
a Book filled with so much learning and plenty of arguments, that that
controversy seems to be handled by none more accurately against the Papists.

Steven Gardener Bishop of Winchester being prisoner in the Tower by stealth,
and largely inveighed against this Book, in that Book which he named Marcus
Constantius.

This Peter Martyr learnedly refuted Cranmer being dead.

After the death of King Edward, when Cranmer was advised by his friends to
fly, If I were (says he) accused of theft, treason, parricide, Hoc in
Cranmero admirabile visum est, quod etsi mitissimus ac facillimus in omnibus
rebus judicaretur, tamen si divinam veritatem labefactari aut oppugnari a
quocunque sentiret, nemo unquam in bellis Imperator majorem animi magnitudinem
constantiamque declararet. Antiq. Eccles. Britan. p. 341.
or any other wickedness, I could be induced to fly much more easily then in
this cause. For when the Question is not concerning my faith toward men, but
toward God, and concerning my constancy in the truth of the holy Scripture
against Popish errors, I would rather in this case lose my life then leave the
Kingdom.

When King Henry purposed to imprison his Daughter Mary being stiff for the
Popish faction, only Cranmer interceded and mitigated the Kings anger, but the
ill will that Queen Mary bore him for having a hand in her Mothers Divorce,
that inveterate hatred (I say) toward him, blotted out all his friendly Offices
to her.

l. 9. c. 35. says there were these remarkable excellencies in him; he was a
great Poet, a great Divine, a great Lawyer.

He put out a Book entitled Speculum Juris, divided into three great Tomes. As
Lombard among Divines is not quoted by his own name, but by that of Master of
the Sentences, so among the Lawyers he is not quoted by the name of William
Durand, but he is styled Speculator.

He delivered this sentence about the Sacrament: Verbum audimus, modum
sentimus, modum nescimus, praesentiam credimus.

Durandus Inter Doctores Scholasticos non contemnendus vixit circa annum 1320.

Heurnius heard him diligently three whole years, so that he would not miss a
Lecture. And when Duretus saw him once coming in late, he let fall this passage
more then once, Mi adolescens, doleo jam quadam dicta quorum nones particeps, a
great token of his affection toward Heurnius.

KIng Edward the 6th, our English Josiah. Hayward has written his Life well. He
was admirable by reason of his rare towardness and hope both of Virtue and
Learning, which in him appeared above the capacity of his years. Favor and
love of Religion was in him from his childhood. Such an instrument given of God
to the Church of England he was, as England never had better.

Cardan says this of him: Being but fifteen years of age, he asked of me in
Latin, (in which tongue he uttered his mind no less readily and eloquently
then I could do my self) what my Books which I had Dedicated unto him De
varietate Rerum did contain? Cardan made answer, and the King wittily replied
several times, as Mr Fox in his 2d Book of Acts and Monum. p. 65. relates.

He restored holy Scriptures to the mother Tongue, he abolished Masses; such as
were in banishment for the danger of the truth, were again received to their
Country.

During the time of the six years of this King there was much tranquillity to
the whole Church of England.

Epistles. They are Amicorum Colloquia absentium, says Tully, 2. Phil.

The reading of Epistles (as also of Lives) is both pleasant and profitable.

No other kind of conveyance is better for knowledge or love.

Baronius in his Annals commends Historiam Epistolarem. Jerome is most eloquent
in his Epistles, especially in that to Heliodorus.

Isidore Pelusiota has excellently handled the greatest part of the mysteries
of our Faith, and the controversies agitated both against the Jews and
Heretics, and yet he entitleth his Book Epistles.

Saint Basil the Great, Gregory Nazianzene, Synesius Bishop of a City in
Cyrene, Cyril of Alexandria, St Cyprian, St Austin, Gregory the Pope, St
Bernard, and other Fathers of the Eastern and Western Churches, do not speak
more powerfully any where, then in their Epistles.

What treasure of moral knowledge are in Seneca's Letters to only one Lucilius?
How much of the Story of the time is in Cicero's Letters, especially those ad
Atticum?

Politian was a most polite Author. See the first Epistle of his first Book of
Epist.

Manutius his Epistles, Wowerus and Coelius Secundus Curios are good.

Erasmus and Lipsius his Epistles are elegant and useful. Bembus and Sadoletus
pure Latinists. Longolius is termed by Ludovicus Vives Homo Ciceronianissimus,
there is elegant Latin (though little matter) in Baudius Epistolas Baudii si

Some much commend Balzaks French Epistles for eloquence.
his Epistles, Scaliger says of him, Solus Baudius Latin loquitur. For the
Fathers, Jeroms excel for Latin, Austens for variety of Learning, Cyprians
for the state of those times in the first three hundred years. For modern
Writers, those of Calvin, Beza, Luther, Melancthon, Oecolampadius, Peter Martyr
and Zanchius, are very profitable, also Casaubones and Scaligers.

For English, our Hall is styled by some the English Seneca, and Mr Bain is
excellent for pious admonitions and instructions.

There are Epistolae clarorum virorum.

Epistolae obscurorum virorum, a facetious Book, thought to be done by Erasmus.

He was born at Roterdam in Holland, in a little house at the Churchyard, Anno
Christianae salutis 1467.

There is his Statue to be seen at Roterdam in brass on the Market place with
this Inscription, ERASMUS Natus ROTERODAMI October. XXVIII. Anno 1467. Obiit
Basileae XII. Julii. Anno 1536.

The House where he was born is yet to be seen, in the front of which are these
verses, Aedibus his ortus mundum decoravit Erasmus
Artibus ingenuis, Religione, Fide.
Boxhorn. Theat. Holland.

By his learned writings which he published he obtained such a fame of his
Learning and virtue, that he was drawn by Kings and Princes into Germany,
Italy, England, and other Regions of Europe, they giving him great rewards.

He was of indefatigable diligence, and a great Scholar. Being sent for into
Brabant by Mary Queen of Hungary in the year 1536. there he died, being seventy
years old.

As he himself acknowledges, that his Adagies cost him great pains, so there
is variety of Learning in them, they are a most ample field of Philology, Omnia

He used great pains and industry in collating the several copies of the
Fathers, and his fidelity was great in publishing them according to the
Manuscripts, his Prefaces and Praeloquia to them are excellent, and his Notes
upon them useful, but there were two special things wanting for the perfecting
of his learned Animadversions upon the Fathers Works, 1. That he did not set
down the diverse readings very exactly. 2. That he did not relate the number of
the Manuscripts, which he used, and where they were to be seen.

From the Collation of Greek and ancient Copies, he corrected also all the New
Testament.

He opened the way before Luther, many were provoked by his learned Works to
study the Greek and Latin tongues; who perceiving a more gentle and ready
order of teaching then before, began to have in contempt the Monks barbarous
and sophistical Doctrine, and especially such as were of a liberal and good
disposition.

He wrote to the Archbishop of Mentz a certain Epistle touching the cause of
Luther. In which he says, That many things were in the Books of Luther
condemned of Monks and Divines, for heretical, which in the Books of Bernard
and Augustine are read for sound and godly. Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 2d. page
61, 62.

He says thus in an Epistle to Biblibaldus, Ego, qui nunquam faverim Luthero,
nisi quomodo faver, qui hortatur ad meliora, utrique parti sum haereticus.

He wrote against the Excommunication of Church Officers, and is an-answered by
Beza.

He was excellently skilled in the Oriental Tongues, the Hebrew, Chaldee,
Arabic, Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian and Turkish. The King of Morocco did so
much esteem his Letters written in Arabic for their Elegancy, that he kept
them amongst his Cymelia. He is celebrated through the whole Christian world,
as the restorer of the Arabic Tongue. He was of incredible diligence and
industry, to which was added a rare facility of wit and sweetness of manners,
for which he was much respected by Philip Mornie, Joseph Scaliger, Isaac
Casaubone.

He died at Leyden in the flour of his Age Anno 1624.

There are many Questions concerning Religion discussed by him in Latin and
French with great subtilty.

His Commentaries upon Timothy and Titus are well liked.

He has published many other Works.

Eusebius, Anno Domini 330.

He was made Bishop of Caesarea in Palestina. He flourished under Constantine
and his Son.

Eusebius Pamphili, not Pamphilus, as he is commonly called.

He had that name from Pamphilus the Martyr whom he dearly loved.

He is taxed for an Arian, Gerhard in his Patrologia says he was so, and
alleges authority for it, yet he is justified by others, he is therefore to
be read with the greater caution, as to that partcular, for he much favored
that opinion, though he subscribed the Nicene Council.

It is the ancientest Ecclesiastical History now extant. See a commendation of
him in Crakanth. Defense of Constantine, c. 6. p. 107. and several Elogies of
him in Gerhards Patrologia.

He said as much as possibly could be said in the Defense of the Vulgar
Translation, altering the Hebrew Vowels for this purpose at his pleasure, yet
it seems the errors discovered by him in his Comment upon Esaias has hindered
the setting forth of his other Commentaries upon the Prophets, which he had
finished (as appears by the later part of his Epistles to the Trent Fathers) so
the Church would have approved them. Dr Jackson on the Creed, Vol. 1. l. 2. c.
31.

He that wrote the Spanish Bibliotheque in the second Tome says, He is said to
have written besides that on Esaias (which I have not seen) upon the other

the first King of France, Anno 1515.

The several courses he took for the restoring of Learning in France, Antoine
du Verdier mentions in his learned Preface to his Bibliotheque, and in his
Book, he says, He was deservedly called the father of Learning, because he
planted in his Kingdom both Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and gave great salaries
to the choice men of all Europe in all Learning, to read publicly in the
University of Paris. See more there.

To one that desired pardon for another that had used ill speeches of his
Majesty, this King said, Let him for whom thou art a Suitor, learn to speak
little, and I will learn to pardon much.

Thevet and Postellus traveled into the East to procure him rare Books for his
Library.

The death of King Francis chanced unfortunately for Students and learned men.
For he loved all Liberal Sciences, no man b^tter, nor showed more liberality to
advance the same. Through long use and custom, he had gotten much knowledge.
For dining and supping his talk was commonly of Learning, and that most
earnestly using many years for the same purpose James Coline a learned man, and
in the vulgar tongue most eloquent. And after him Peter Castellan. Of these two
had he learned, whatsoever was written in the books of Poets, Historiographers
and Cosmographers. Moreover he knew perfectly whatsoever Aristotle,
Theophrastus, Pliny, and such other like, have written of the nature of Plants,
Herbs, Beasts, Metals and precious Stones, and by daily use and hearing did
remember them.

He was wont also to confer much of the Mathematical Sciences, and to reason
often of the Scriptures. In his own Tongue he was always accounted right
eloquent and grave. Throughout Greece and Italy he had those that sought and
copied out for him the Works of old Writers, and he made a great Library. The
Keeper whereof was Castellane. Sleid. Comment. l. 19. p. 283. Evangelium in

Kings might soon be learned, who might learn the holy Word of both Testaments
in two months, and the Concent of Scripture in an hour: and might command that
every Sermon should either abridge the whole Bible, as St Paul does to the
revolting Hebrews: or tell the afflictions of our Lords Family, as Daniel does
seven times over: or weakness of Salomons Kings: or how Aarons twelve stones
tell the Tribes story: or the golden chain of Chronicle and Jubilees: or the
Mysteries of Moses Ceremonies: or Collations of Prophecies with event: or like
Revolutions to show Gods facility in teaching Christ: or some whole book in one
Sermon. Brought of the Revelat. in c. 12.

He coming to a shop and finding a Book under his name which he knew not of,
nor never saw before, he wrote a Book de libris propriis.

The like has Cardane and Caius of Cambridge done, that their genuine writings
might be known, they having published many Works.

Some say he lived sevenscore years.

in the East, Greece and Asia, had the Almagest of Geber, which is an excellent
Work in the Arabic Tongue, containing the Explanation of the state of the

A Divine of Paris right famous, he was present at the Council of Constance,
and in books written he commends highly the Decree whereby it is agreed that
the Bishop of Rome should be subject to the Counsel. And says the thing is
worthy to be written in all Churches and public places, for a perpetual
memory. For he says they are pestilent flatterers which bring this Tyranny
into the Church, as though the Bishop of Rome ought neither to obey the
Counsel, nor be judged by the same, as though the Counsel should take all its
force and authority from him, as though it could not be called but at his
pleasure, as though he were bound to the observation of no Laws, nor no account
might be taken of his doings. These monstrous sayings must be utterly rejected,
which are against all Laws equity and reason. For all the authority of the
Church depends on the general Counsel, and it is lawful to appeal from the
Pope unto it: and those which inquire whether the Bishop of Rome or the Church
be greater, make as wise a question as if they should ask whether the part be
more, or the whole, for it appertains to the Counsel, to constitute, to
judge, and to depose the Bishop of Rome, as lately it was declared at
Constance. Sleid. Comment. l. 1.

He has written a painful and an experimental Work, touching the Loadstone.
Bac. Advancem. of Learning, l. 2. c. 13.

That admirable searcher of the nature of the Loadstone, Dr Gilbert, by means
of whom, and of Dr Harvey, our Nation may claim, even in this later age, as
deserved a Crown for solid Philosophical Learning, as for many ages together it
has done formerly, for acute and subtle speculations in Divinity. Sir Ken.
Digb. Treat. of Bodies, c. 20.

Learned Peireskius was wont to lament, that when he was in England, he was not
acquainted with this William Gilbert the Author of the Book de Magnete, nor
Thomas Lydiat the famous Mathematician. Gassend. de Vita Peiresk. l. 2.

Gassendus l. 4. de vita Peiresk. makes honorable mention of his Book de
Magnete p. 378.

We had not any certain or satisfactory knowledge of Magneticall properties,
until such time as it pleased God to raise up one of our Countrymen, Dr
Gilbert, who to his evelasting praise has trodden out a new path to Philosophy,
and on the Loadstone erected a large Trophy to commend him to posterity.

Prayer, and other Learned Works show him to be; and he is often Honorably
mentioned by Voetius, Streso, and other outlandish Divines.

He was eminent for three graces, his Humility, Patience and Faith.

He would begin his prayer very audibly and distinctly, which was the more
commendable, because of his great Congregation at Blackefriers.

A Monk of Bononia, he compiled the book called The Popes Decrees, or The Canon
Law.

Also his brother Peter Lombard Bishop of Paris, which is called The Master of
the Sentences, compiled his 4 Books of the Sentences. These two brethren were
the greatest doers in finding out and establishing the blind opinion of the
Sacrament, that the only similitude of Bread and Wine remained, but not the
substance of them, and this they call the Spiritual understanding of the
Mystery.

One de Conservanda Valetudine Literatorum.

Gratius the Faliscian. Gratius poeta Augusti aevo floruit, deque venatione
scripsit. Voss. l. 1. de Analog. c. 34.


An ancient Latin Poet, contemporary with Virgill and Ovid, who bore an high
esteem in that pure age, when the greatest Wits flourished, and Poetry
underwent the severest Judges.

His style is every where concise, chaste, and florid.

His Book De Venatione is now Englished by Mr Wase.

Ovid speaks of him, Aptaque venanti Gratius arma daret.

Johannes Gravius, a Learned Oxonian.

Elementa Linguae Persicae.

Anonymus Persa de Siglis. Arabum and Persarum Astronomicis.

Epochae Arabum Celebriores, and his other Works show his Abilities.

The Lady Jane Gray.

She was both Learned and Religious.

Ascham in his Epist. and Schoolmaster, and diverse others commend her for her
Learning.

He says when he came to her once, whilst others were hunting and following
their pleasures, he found her reading Platos Phaedon, and that she understood
it so, Sic loquitur and scribit Graece, ut vera referenti vix sides adhiberi
possit. Asch. Ep. l. 1. Sturmio,
that he admired her.

No marvel if she were well skilled in the Greek.

He was an humble, devout, and holy Bishop, and had many pious Martyrs his
Predecessors as Popes or Fathers in that See of Rome: he deserved the title of
Gregory the Great for abhorring the name of Universal Bishop.

Bid calls him Apostolum nostrum our Apostle, and he gives this reason for it,
quod nostram, id est, Anglorum gentem de potestate Satanae ad fidem Christi sua
industria convertit, because he converted our Nation by his own industry from
the power of Satan to the faith of Christ. He sent Austen the Monk and other
Legates hither. See Pet. du Moulins Antibarbarian, chapter 13.

He first wrote Servus Servorum Dei, putting the Roman Bishops in remembrance
thereby, both of their humbleness, and also of their duty in the Church of
Christ.

Stephanus Paschasius in his Icones has these verses of Gregory the first, Leo
the first, and Nicholas the first.

Pontifices quot Roma tulit celeberrima sanctos;
Majores nullos Nicolao, Gregorioque;
Sive Leone habuit: re sunt ut nomine primi.

Gregory Thaumaturgus, Episcopus fuit Neocaesariensis.

He was called Thaumaturgus from the greatness of his miracles: Basil says,
he was called by the enemies of the truth another Moses. Jerome styles him Virum
Apostolicorum signorum and virtutum.

When he was Bishop of Neocesarea in Pontus, he blessed God that when he came
first to his charge, he found not above seventeen Christians, and when he
departed from them, he left not in all his Diocese so many unbaptized, or
unbelievers.

He was present at the Synod of Antioch, celebrated against Samosatenus, Anno
266.

He wrote a Metaphrase upon Ecclesiastes.

An Exposition of Faith.

Mr Gregory of Oxford.

His two Books show him to be a good Linguist.

Antiquissimus and fidelissimus Francorum scriptor. Chiflet. Anast. Child. Reg.

Gregorias Turonensis.

He has put out these Works,

He is unreasonably bitter against those which are both Learned and Modest.

The defender of Bellarmine, the most scurrile Writer that this or the former
age has seen. Dr Crakanth. in a Sermon. on 2 Chronicles. 9.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

He was chosen for the Papists Champion, in the famous Disputation holden at
Regensperg, 1600; whom Possevine the Jesuit calls the very hammer of the
Heretics.

Grindall, a Learned Divine.

Johannes Groperus of Collen was offered the Cardinalship by Paul the 4th,
Johannes Gropperus Germanus Dignitatem Cardinalis ultro oblatam, quam caeteri
morrales plerunque ardentissimis votis ambiunt, rara hoc aevo modestia and
animi magnitudine repudiavit. Thuan. Hist. Tom. 1. l. 16.
but he was then old, and thinking to honor his memory much more by refusing a
Dignity, desired even by great Princes, then by keeping it a few days, he sent
the Pope many thanks, together with his excuse, and refusing the Ornaments,
would neither have the Name nor Title. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, lib. 5. p.
396, 397.

This was after a sort commendable, but his forsaking the Gospel mentioned by
Sleidan in his 15 Book of Commentaries, was most wicked.

Hugo Grotius. He was born at Delph in the Low Countries, Non divinarum minus

in the year of our Lord 1583.

He has written upon all the Old and New Testament. His Books De Veritate
Religionis Christianae, and De Satisfactione Christi are well esteemed.

Piscator sent these verses to him when he published Martianus Capella.

Magnus es ingenio, doctrina magnus es idem,
Nomini, and magni. Magna cupido tibi est,
Non temere ergo tibi, sed cum ratione, locuta
Cognomen Groti Belgica lingua dedit.
He was a very Learned Lawyer, but fell off much from soundness and Orthodoxy
in the true Religion in his later days.

Voetius in his 2d part of Select. Theolog. Disputat. De Conversione Judaeorum
reckons him among the men dubiae aut variate Religionis.

Some Learned and Orthodox French Divines, as Rivet, Maresius, and others also
have written solidly against him.

Therefore his diligent Translatour might perhaps have been better employed,
then in turning into English his Vow for the Churches Peace, a book so empty
and Heterodox, and so well refuted by the Learned Rivet in his Apoligeticus pro
vera Pace Ecclesiae.

Grynaeus.

He has expounded several parts of Scripture, and published two Books of

He said Erasmus did more hurt the Pope of Rome, jocando, quam Lutherus

Rodolph. Gualterus the son has written Homilies upon the lesser Prophets,
and other Learned Works.

Stephanus Guichardus, Estienne Guichard a Learned French Linguist.

He has written a French book entitled L' Harmony Etymologique des Langues,

He seems to be inferior to none of the Ancients, for he excels in faith,
diligence, prudence, and other virtues, and in the relation of things done, in
discovering of Counsels, in noting the manners of men, in describing of
persons, and in recounting Orations, he has many things which are wanting in
others who have written the History of those times.

8th.

He set forth a book entitled, A necessary Doctrine and erudition for any
Christian man.

See a commendation of his Learning and Severity, Eras. Epist. l. 6. Epist. 1^.
^o him. Of his Learning also in Epistola Thomae Mori ad Academ. Oxon.

Amongst the most famous Contradictors, which the Doctrine of Luther found, was
Henry the 8th King of England, who not being born the Kings eldest son, had
been destinate by his Father to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and therefore in
his youth was made to study: But the eldest being dead, and after him the
father also, he succeeded in the Kingdom. Esteeming it a great honor to employ
himself in so famous a Controversy of Learning, he wrote a Book of the seven
Sacraments, defending also the Popedom, and oppugning the Doctrine of Luther: a
thing so grateful to the Pope, that having received the Kings book, he
honored him with the title of Defender of the Faith.

But Martin suffered not himself to be scared with that most illustrious
glittering name of a King, but answered his Majesty with as much acrimony,
vehemence, and as small respect, as he had answered the petty Doctors. The
Hist. of the Council of Trent, l. 1. p. 16.

Hermannus Contractus, a Germane, Anno 1032.1058 say some.

He was descended of a Noble Count of Swedland, and was crooked and lame from
his infancy, which gave him the surname of Contractus. He spoke Latin, Cum is
omnibus membris contractus esset, ut hinc inde tantum de portaretur (unde etiam
suum cognomen acquisivit) parents eum in monasterio S. Galli collocarunt. Erat
trium linguarum Graecae, Arabicae and Latinae peritissimus praeterea Theosogus,

He was the inventer of the Astrolabe.

Hermogenes. He was of Tarsus in Asia minor. Being scarce 18 years old he wrote
the Art of Rhetoric in six books, but when he was old he forgot Learning.
Thence they spoke of him jestingly, that he was old in his childhood, and a
child in his old age.

Heredian, an eloquent and faithful (yet free) Historian. Nam mihil vere
persuadeo, Graecum virum Herodianum: qu^m ipse nuper Civitate Romana donasti:

Herodotus. Herodotus Graecus, ne quid omisisse videretur, omnia sine delectu
congessit, quorumque pleraque non ab antiquis scriptis, sed a vulgi fabulis
accepit. Qui quanquam oratione concinnus sit atque elegans, eorum tamen qui
sane and incorrupte judicant avertit ab illa tam coacervata and referta
narrationum multitudine fidem. Et quanquam a quibusdam quod videtur affectasse
historiae pater dicatur, ab aliis tamen fabulatum pater merito dictus est.

Although he relates stories that may seem fabulous, yet the whole body of his
History is composed with singular fidelity and a diligent desire of truth, but
he often prefaceth concerning other narrations, that he rehearses them not
because he thinks them to be true, but as he has received them from others.

He matched any of his time in Learning in the Tongues, skill of humanity, and
knowledge in holy Scripture, yet was that time so plentiful of Learned men, as
almost no time since.

Linguarum, Historiarum, and locorum situs peritissimus vir. Full. Miscel. l. 2.
c. 8. Vide c. 11. and 15.

He was mainly taken with Origin, so that he called him by way of praising him,
Suum, his own.

His Epistles are approved of in Italy, France, Spain, all Germany and Africa:
he was honored and sought to far and near by Bishops, by Noble Matrons, by
great Rulers, many great personages came far, having seen his Works, to see
the Author. He had excellent skill in the Hebrew, which he got of a Jew
Barhanin ah, as Erasmus relates in his Life.

He died as a Martyr of Christ at Constance Anno 1415. His Works are mentioned

He and Jerome of Prague were condemned in the Council of Constance against the
public faith given them. Hus in the year 1415. but Jerome in the year
following, which Bodin (though a Papist) disliked De Repub. l. 5. c. 5.

The people which were present at the execution of Hus, so admired his
constancy and pious death, that they said, What that man taught or did before
we know not: certainly those things are great evidences of true piety, for he
prayed most fervently to God a little before his death.

justify Illyricus his definition of original sin, and chap. 13. labors to
show, that Calvin and Peter Martyr consent with him in the description of
original sin. Yet I have elsewhere refuted his opinion, of original sins
being the essence and substance of a man, and it is generally disliked by the
Orthodox.

They have put as much out of Cajetane as would make a pretty Book.

The purpose of these Indices is to corrupt the writings, and raze the records
of the world, to make all Authors to become the Popes Proctors, and such as
(having spoke for the truth) now (being dead) must plead for the Pope. Their
practice is so soon as an Author is purged, to burn all the old ones as far
as they can. Crashaws Preface to his Romish Forgeries and Falsificat.

Arias Montanus was sometime a chief Inquisitor in the Low Countries, and had
more then a finger in printing of the Antwerp Index, long since, and often
reprinted by Junius: yet now his own Works (as his learned Commentaries) upon
Isay, the lesser Prophets, the four Evangelists and Acts of the Apostles, upon
the Epistles and Apocalypse, and other writings of his, are purged and purged
again in the Roman Index. D. James his Mysteries of the Indices Expurgatory.

A learned man but a great persecutour of the Church.

When he had great store of money, he said to Thomas Aquinas, Do thou not see
Thomas, that the Church cannot now say as in times past when it first began,
Aurum and argentum non habeo, I have not gold and silver, Thomas presently
answered, Holy Father, this is true, but the Church cannot now say, as the
Primitive Church did by the same man, Arise, walk, be whole.

His Works are contained in two Tomes.

He is a diligent Historian, yet since he wrote the Antiquities of his own
Nation, with an intention to communicate them to others, he described them as
stately as he could, and when he thought the simplicity of the Scripture did
not suffice to the commendation of things done amongst the Hebrews, he invented
and added many things himself, therefore in those things he is to be prudently
read, left he deceive the unwary Reader. This fault Luther on Genesis 34. and
Rivet on Exodus 2. and Chamier and others tax him with. Vide Cornel. a Lap. in
Genesis 29. and in Numb. c. 11. v. 34.

There was a Jew in latter times who out of the true Josephus translated into
Latin by Ruffinus (he himself understanding no Greek) and Hegesyppus (or
rather Ambrose) his Latin History of the destruction of Jerusalem, set out an
H^brew History under the false name of Joseph Ben-Gorion, whom he thought to be
the same with Josephus the Historian, for whom he would be taken. The Epitome
of this Hebrew History is entitled, (...) Josiphon, whence the name of Josippus
was taken up.

Some commend him, and others much dislike him.

I have heard wise and learned men say, That his whole study and purpose is
spent on these points, to deface the Emperor, to flatter France, to spite
England, to help Germany, to praise the Turk, to keep up the Pope, to pull down
Christ and Christ's Religion, as much as lies in him. Aschams Discourse of the
State of Germany, p. 15.

most famous among the Fathers.

His nature well agreed with his name, for he ever loved peace, and sought to
set agreement when any controversy rose in the Church.

He was martyred with a great multitude of others more, for the Confession and
Doctrine of Christ, about the fourth or fifth year of Severus.

this thousand years. B. Down. Defense of his Sermon. l. 3. c. 4.

He has learnedly interpreted almost all the Old and New Testament. He has
written twenty Books of Etymologies, wherein he has not only showed himself a
Grammarian, but a complete Artist.

He was born in Devonshire. John comes from the grace of God. Juel is the same

Gemma Frisius.

The Jewel of Bishops, the worthiest Divine that Christendom has bred for some
hundreds of years, says incomparable Hooker. Doctor Hackwell. Apol. lib. 5.

Hardly is there any Controversy of importance handled at this day, of which
in his Works is not to be found some learned and probable resolution.

His Apology was esteemed not only by the Tigurin^s, but by all Protestants. It
was translated into the Germane, French, Italian, Spanish Tongue, and into the
English by the Lady Anne Bacon, wif^ to the Lord Chancellor Bacon.

The first part of it is an illustration of the true Doctrine, and a certain
paraphrastical Exposition of the twelve Articles of our Christian faith. The
second a succinct and solid Refutation of Objections.

He had at hand a great paper-book, as it were a rich treasury of Sciences, in
which he wrote his divine and humane collections out of Poets, Philosophers and
Divines. We call it a Commonplace book.

Doctor Rainolds in his Letter to his friend concerning his advice for the
study of Divinity, says thus,

To^ching ^^^ing, you k^ow, I do not like the common custom of Commonplace
Books. The best in my judgment is to note in the Margent, or in some
paper-book for that purpose the Sum and Method of that which you read.

In other little Books which he carried about with him (an Ephe^erides or
Diary) he diligently wrote all the Apophthegmes and witty speeches, or jests
which he heard from others, or observed any way, by which means he much
increased his knowledge yearly.

He was very affable and courteous, amiable in his whole life, in speech witty
and plea^ant, in his writings he is solid and yet f^cetious. He fled in Q.
Mary's days, and returned when Q. Elizabeth ruled.

He was given to Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia to be instructed, of whom also he
learned the Doctrine of the Church and was made a Reader in the Church of
Nicomedia. But he was a hearer secretly of Libanius the Rhetorician, and was
familiarly acquainted with the most famous Philosophers of that time. He was
drawn back by these by degrees to the Heathenish Religion.

He wrote Books against the Christians, and reproved their Doctrine, especially
the prohibitions of revenge delivered, which, though they properly belong to
private revenge, yet he wrested them for public revenge, and he said by these,
Magistrates, punishments, lawful wars were taken away, and all the sinews of
retaining humane Societies.

Ammianus Marcellinus commends his Temperance in meat and drink, and his
continual watching, and the partition of the night into private, public and
divine offices.

He took away the great Gifts and holy Vessels which Constantine the Great had
given to the Churches use, and Ministers maintena^^^, with this scoff, See in
what goodly vessels this Nazarite is served.

It was one of his scoffs when he robbed the Churches and the Christians, He
did it that the Galileans (so he contumeliously called the Christians) might go
more readily to heaven.

He not only killed the Christians, but scoffed at Christ himself and the
Scriptures.

He had scarce reigned two years, when warring against the Persians, he was
struck and mortally wounded with a Spear in that war, as Nazianzen^,
Theodo^^^, So^rai^s, Sozomen, and ot^ers ^n^ore d^cent, and filling his hand
with blood, c^sting it into the air, he cried out, Vicesti Galilaee, Ita simul
and victori^m confessus est, and blasphemiam evomit, says Theodoret.

A famous Philosopher, and a great Defender of Christian Religion, who first
exhibited unto the Emperor Antoninus Pius, and to the Senate, an Apology in
the Defense of the Christians, and afterward himself also died a Martyr.

He flourished in the Church after Christ about the year 150, so Zanchy. Others
say 163.

He is the ancientest of the Fathers (whose writings remain) except Clement.

He lived in the very next Age to the Apostles, and Tertullian lived the next
Age to him.

He was first allured to the Faith by the cruelty of Tyrants, and by the
constancy and patience of Gods Saints.

In the year of Christ 163. he suffered Martyrdom for the faith under Mareus
Aurelius Antoninus the Philosopher, and Lucius Verus Emperors.

His Works were printed in Greek and Latin by Commelinus Anno 1593.

He is commended by learned men for the best Satyrist. That Censor morum
liberrimus. He is a rare Poet, is testified by his Verse, flowing like a River,
when the wind breaths gently, smooth besides the banks, strong in the current.

He was a true Philosopher, who with inimitable sweetness of Language, and
majesty of Sentences, sets before our eyes the loveliness of virtue, and the
deformity of vice. So the learned Sir Robert Stapleton in his Preface to his
exact Translation of Juvenals Satyrs.

wit or reason, and of a brazen forehead, for his impudent boldness in
reporting things so fabulous and incredible.

Leo the tenth, Anno Dom. 450.

As one whose birth and education was noble, he adorned the Papacy with many
good parts which he brought into it, amongst which were his singular Learning
in humanity, goodness, and a mavelous sweet manner in treating of affairs,
together with a pleasing behavior, more then humane, joined with incomparable
liberality, and a great inclination to favor those that were Learned, and
endowed with any extraordinary quality; which virtues were not found in that
Sea of a long time before, neither equal nor near unto his. And he would have
been a Pope absolutely complete, if with these he had joined some knowledge in
things that concern Religion, and some more propension unto piety, of both
which he seemed careless. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, l. 1. parag. 12.

He was son unto Laurence Medices, and had to his great grandfather Cosmus,
that was the great honor of that House. Leo was made Cardinal when he was but
thirteen years old: his successor was Adrian the 6th a Hollander. Sleid.

Both his skill in Divinity was profound, and his tongue was eloquent to utter

Learned in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and famous for his Notes upon the whole
Scripture, according to the litterall sense.

He was a jew born, but after turned Christian, that he might more fitly attend
the reading of the Scriptures, which he endeavored to explain by Annotations,
he became a Franciscan Monk, as the opinion of those times swaied.

About the year 1322, he began to illustrate the Bible with Scholia, which work
within seven years after he finished and published. He distinguishes and
separates the Apocryphal books (viz. Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias,
the books of the Macchabees) from the Canonical. In that Work many things
occur, which do not agree with the Popish superstitions, and do demonstrate
that Lyra could have expressed many things more fitly, if he had been born in a
better age. Illyr. Catal. Test. Verit.

impressa Italice saepe clare ostendit, ex ambitione and crudelitate Pontificum,
pleraque mala ac bella Christianis provenisse. Illyr. Catal. Test. Verit. l. 19.
NIcolaus Machiavellus, a great Historian. He lived in the age of Philip
Strozius, and Clement the 8th Pope.

Although his Politics be full of poison, yet since his history has much
hidden wisdom in it, some think the judicious and wary may read it with profit.

Joh. Maccovius, a Learned Divine.

There is his Theologia Polemica, and another Work.

Macrobius. Some commend his Saturnals.

Macenatis. c. 1.
He was Counselor to Augustus the Emperor, and so great a favourer and
countenancer of Learned men, that he has conveyed his name to all the Patrons
of Learning.

He favored Poets above others, and advanced them. He exceedingly loved and
favored Virgill the Prince of Poets, and absque ipso fuisset, nos hodi^ and
hujus and plurium aliorum monumentis careremus.

He also favored Horace.

Otia dat nobis, sed qualia fecerat olim
Maecenac Flacco Virgiloque suo.
Mart. l. 1. Epigr. 108. ad Lucium Julium.
Propertius also was his friend, and other Poets mentioned by Meibomius, c. 18.
and there he adds this sentence, Ex tam propenso vero in literatos amore ac
favore id praemii inter caetera retulit Maecenas, ut celebriores doctissimorum
hominum lucubrationes ipsius virtuti consecrarentur.

Joannes Petrus Maffeius, a very eloquent Italian.

Hujus aevi Latinae linguae lumen, he in prose honored his Country at the same
time that Torquatus Tassus did it in verse, being his Countries Tully, as the
other was its Virgill.

There are Epistola Selectae published of his cum vita Ignatii Loiolae.

Raphael Vir fuit habitu corporis venusto, facundia elegante, and morum
gravitate vitaeque sanctimonia clarus, Boissardi Bibliotheca.
Maffeus, a most learned man, as his writings sufficiently testify. His Works
are mentioned by Boissard.

Magellanus.

He found out the straight of Magellane.

R. M. Maiemon, or Rabbi Ben Maimon, Anno a Nativitate Christi 1131.

One famous among Jews, Christians, and Mahometans. De hoc apud Hebraeos

He dwelt in Egypt, therefore Aegyptius dicitur.

He has written a Book styled More Nevochim, Doctor Perplexorum, which because
it seems too much to favor the Christians, the Jews generally conspired
together, and thought to burn it, but it was so much dispersed through the
whole world that they could not accomplish what they had intended. Drus. in

Mr Seldom in his 2d part de Syned. says he has five several Editions of
Maimonides, besides a Manuscript, and every edition has somewhat that the
other has not.

He has written upon Aristotle's Rhetoric, upon some of Tullies Works, and
Orations of his own. Eruditissima Commentaria in quatuor Evangelistas meliora

Maldonate, a Spaniard and a Jesuit.

Serar. cap. 11.

Others say that he read Lectures in Paris by way of preface (before his
Exposition of the Evangelists,) of the Scriptures, and said that there was more
Divinity in one Chapter of St Paul's Epistles, then in all Aquinas his Sums.
Many Protestants frequented his Lectures, and he was suspected to be too
favorable to them.

Baptista Faustus Mantuanus, a Monk born at Mantua, as Virgill also was.

Poeta fuit doctus and pius. Bellarm. de Script. Eccles. He was a Learned and
pious Poet.

Of that same that he was made equal by some to the more ancient Poets even
under Augustus: Amongst other verses of his wisely written also those are wont
often to be used and rehearsed, Ambitiosus honos, and opes, and foeda voluptas,
Haec tria pro trino numine mundus habet.


Stephanus Pasch^sius in his Icones has these verses of him, Mantua foeli^em
genuit foecunda Maronem;
Haec eadem faustis me tulit as spiciis.


His Works are mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

He often grievously accuses the Church of Rome.

Th^uet Vies d^s hommes Illustres. l. 6. confesses he was Satyricall and
discovered the abuses of Rome, and then says he was a bastard, and gives many
examples of famous men that were bastards.

He collected and published two famous Volumes, one which Henry Stevens lately
reprinted at Genevah. Another which in 2 Tomes gives 700 Epistles, 40 Volumes
of Greek Authors, rare and yet full of Learning, Wisdom and Eloquence.

He first also published a Volume of Greek Grammers.

Ammianus Marcellinas. In the year of our Lord 361.

He writes a military and rough style, as himself confesses.

He wrote 30 Books, beginning from the rule and dominion of Nerva, even to the
death of Valens, in whose Court he flourished, but 13 of these are lost.

our Ladies Psalter.

Bonaventure the author thereof, to show himself a devout servant to his Lady,
has taken every Psalm of David's Psalter (which he peculiarly made and referred
to Almighty God) and has in diverse of the said Psalms and verses put out the
Name of the Lord, and placed in the name of our Lady: This being done through
the whole Psalms, and every one of them, it is now called our Ladies Psalter,
used to be sung and said in the praise and service of our Lady.

Alsted in his Encyclopaed. l. 35. says this book is falsely ascribed to
Bonaventure, for he on Lombard says, Cavendum est, ne dum matris excellentia
ampliatur, filii gloria minuatur.

Augustine Marlorat, one of the Ministers of the Reformed Church at Roan in
France.

He was hang^d upon a gibic^ before our Ladies Church in Roan.
A man excellently Learned, and of an unblameable life, who had the testimony
even of the Papists themselves, that in his Sermons he never uttered ought that
tended to sedition or rebellion.

He ha^h written upon Genesis, Esaias, and the Psalms, and an Ecclesiastical
Exposition upon the New Testament, which last is generally well esteemed of,
and Dr Willet somewhere wishes, that the like had been done by some on all the
Old Testament. Enchiridio^ locorum Communium.

In the Vulgar tongue he surmounted far all Poets that either were before his
days, or that lived also in his time. He turned 50 of David's Psalms into
French Meeter, which are read with admiration of his excellent wit. He set them
forth at Genevah, for he might not safely longer abide in France for suspicion
of Lutheranism. See Pasquiers Recherches de la France, l. 7. c. 5.

of all Italy.

Of whom I cannot speak without great reverence, B. Jewels Def. of his Apol.

At Padua he first obtained a full knowledge of the Greek tongue, and of
Philosophy, afterward at Bononia he diligently studied the Hebrew tongue and
Divinity. He was at first a Monk, and was counted the chief of his order; but
when he more seriously punished their loose lives, he got thereby much envy.

He has written Common-places, a large Opus long accuratissimum, in quo

He has written Learnedly on Joshua, and assisted Arias Montanus in the edition
of the King of Spains Bible, and first of all illustrated the Syriack Idiome
with Grammatical Precepts and a Lexicon. There was a great familiarity between
him and Laevinus Torrentius and Augerius Busbequius, and at Rome he was
intimate with Antonius Augustinus, and other Learned men.

He says in his Preface to his Grammar of the Syriack tongue, that Moses
Mardenus was his Master, Ipsum Romae privatim interdum audiebam doctorem.

De Medicis.

The House de Medicis in Florence has been and still is a great favourer of
Learning and Learned men. Mediceorum nomen, etsi pluribus de causis fuit
celebre, hac tamen potissimum re celebrius evasit, quod Musas e Graecia
exulantes hospitio exceperint, and libris praesertim Graecis maximo sumptu tota
Graecia, and Asia conquisitis non solum Bibliothecam instituerunt and ornarunt,
sed bonarum ardium studia in Italia, non sine magnis impensis foverunt. Cosmus
enim senior insignem construxit Bibliothecam, quam Petrus ejus filius, nec non
Julianus, and Laurentius Cosmi Nepotes, and Petri filii auxerunt, viri sane
clarissimi, and bonarum artium, nominisque Platomei, ejusque doctrinae
cultores. Ang. Roccha Append. Biblioth. Vatic. De Biblioth. Medicorum domus

Cosmi de Medicis, was a lover and preferren of Learned men, for he brought
unto Florence Argyropylus a Grecian born, and in that time of singular
Learning, that the youth of Florence might be by him instructed in the Greek
tongue, and other good Learning. He entertained in his house Marsilius Ficinus,
a second Father of the Philosophy of Plato, and entirely loved him. Machiav.

Laurentius de Medicis his grandchilde was a lover of Learning. Papyrius
Massonies has written his life well. He greatly esteemed men that excelled in
any Art. He marvellously delighted in Music, Architecture and Poetry, as many
of his own verses and Commentaries yet extant do testify. He erected an
University in Pisae, whither he brought the most excellent men of all Italy.

He was excellently learned, not only in Divinity, but also in the Tongues and
Sciences, and generally in all good Learning. For what Art or Science was not
polished with his Learned hand? He fyled the Tongue with his Precepts of
Rhetoric. He made reason more reasonable by his skillful rules of Logic. He
lift up our heads to behold the stars, and taught us to look back into the
times that are past. Travers Answ. to a Popish Treatise.

There is a Book (they say, but I cannot meet with it) styled Crisis
Melanctoniana, or Judicium de legendis Authoribus, his judgment of Authors
collected out of his Works.

Melancthon thus wrote down before his death, the motives of his willingness
to leave this world,

A Sinistris.

A Dextris.
Venias in Lucem: Videbis Deum: Intuebiris filium Dei: Disces illa mira arcana

Fearfulness was a stain in all his excellencies.

Commotions.

He made these Verses of the Lady Arabella, Causa mihi tecum communis Carceris

and a wretched enemy against the truth of the Gospel, as by his Book may
appear, wherein he writes most slanderously and contumeliously against Luther,
Zuinglius, Tindal, Frith, Barns, Bayfield, Bainham. He stood wilfully in the
Popes quarrel against his own Prince, though the Papists reckon him and Fisher
among the number of their Martyrs. Foxes Act. and Monum. vol. 2. p. 353. And my

He was so given to jesting and scoffing, that he continued it unto his death.

One of the Officers at the Tower demanding his upper garment for his Fee,
meaning his Gown, he answered, that he should have it, and gave him his Cap,
saying, it was the uppermost garment he had.

Qui tum alia erudite scripsit, tum etiam ad imitationem Reipublicae Platonicae

Coming to the Tower-gate, a poor woman called unto him, and besought him to
declare, that he had certain evidences of hers, in the time that he was in
Office (which after he was apprehended he could not come by) and that he would
entreat that she might have them again, or else she was undone. He answered,
Good woman have patience a little while, for the King is so good to me, that
even within this half hour he will discharge me of all businesses, and help
thee himself.

Also when he went up the stair of the Scaffold* he desired one of the Sheriffs
Officers to give him his hand to help him up, he said, When I come down again,
let me shift for my self so well as I can. Also the hangman kneeled down to
him, asking him forgiveness of his death, as the manner is. To whom he
answered, I forgive thee; but I promise thee that thou shall never have honor
of the striking off my head, my neck is so short. Also, even when he should lay
down his neck on the block, he having a great gray-beard, stroaked out his
beard, and said to the hangman, I pray you let me lay my beard over the block,
least you should cut it; others relate it thus, that he said, it never
committed treason; thus with a mock he ended his life.

and Printer at Basil.

He was born Anno 1508.

A religious and sincere man, very liberal to all Scholars, and very respective
to his Father.

His Works are mentioned by Melch. Ad. in his Life.

Oppian a famous Greek Poet. Anno Dom. 210.

Exulans cum patre suo Agesilao viro opulento, in exilio clarissima poemata
scripsit: Et Severo Imperatore (qui patrem in exilium egerat) defuncto. Romam

He received for every verse a piece of gold of the Emperor Antoninus.

That learned Bishop of Milleuita.

There are his Works together, among which one is De Schismate Donatistarum.

His errors were so great and heinous, that thence the Sect of Origenists is
called.

If any man desire to see a Catalogue of Origens errors, he may have recourse
to the learned Epistle of St Jerome, Ad Avitum.

Vide August. de Haeres. p. 199, 200. and Bezae Praefat. ad Annot. in N. T.

He lived in the year of our Lord 230.193. says Helvicus. 203. Calvisius.

He was almost wholly of the third Age. Hic amore castitatis se castravit:
Nevum and vetus Testamentum memoriter novit: Jam senex Hebraicam didicit
linguam. Wolfii Lect. memor. Centen. 3.

He wrote exceeding much, yet there remains now little in comparison of that
he wrote, and that so corrupted, that it nothing answers the famous report of
Learning which he had in the Church in his time. All his Works now extant
revised by Erasmus, were printed at Basil by Frobenius, 1536.

He was in his Age a mirror of gravity, integrity, constancy, zeal, piety,
learning of all sorts, both divine and humane, of so happy a memory that he had
the Bible without book, of such admirable eloquence, that not words but honey
seemed to drop from his lips; of so indefatigable industry, that he was called
Adamantius, and was said by some to have written six thousand books. Dr.
Crakanth. Vigilius Dormitans.

Est certe hic scriptor adeo omnibus modis impurus, sive ita ipse scripsit,

his Annotat. on the New Testament.

detesturus. Calv. Epist. Melancthoni.
Andreas Osiander, Anno Christi 1498. the Epitomizer of the Centuriators,
skillful in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin.

Beza Epist. 59. calls him, Phanaticum and impurissimum Ecclesiarum turbatorem.

He held that the righteousness of Christ, by which we are justified, was his
essential righteousness, as God. But, 1. That is incommunicable to us. 2. If
that had been required to our Justification, Christ needed not to have been
incarnate. Paul says Romans 5.19. We are made righteous by the obedience of one
man.

Hier. Osorius.

An eloquent man, and too precise a follower of Tully. In his Book against
Luther and Doctor Haddon he dares not name the words of Justification or
Predestination. And I wonder (says Mr. Fox) that he dares insert the name of
Christ in his Books, since it is not found in Tully. Nec Justificationis aut
praedestinationis vocabula ipsa vel nominare audes. Ac miror equidem, quod
Christi nomen, quod apud Ciceronem nunquam legitur, non dubites libellis tuis
inspergere.

His Book De gloria is most esteemed.

He was Secretary for the Latin Tongue to King Henry the eighth. He was of
great ripeness of wit, learning and eloquence, also expert in foreign
Languages. He was sent in the Kings affairs Ambassador to Venice, which
function there he so discharged, that it is hard to say, whether he procured
more commendation or admiration among the Venetians, for his dexterity of wit,
and specially for the singular promptness in the Italian Tongue. For opinion
and fame of Learning, he was accepted, not only here in England with Linacre,
Grocinus, Mere, and others, but also known and reported abroad in such sort,
that in all the great heap of Erasmus his Epistles, he wrote almost to none so
many, as to him. Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 2. p. 247. c. 1.

Peireskius, Claudius Fabritius de Peiresc. one most exact and skillful in

His life is excellently written by Gassendus, and is worthy to be read by

Pelagius a Britain by birth, and a Monk at Rome 382 years after Christ.

To prove that he was a Britain, Beda in his History quotes that verse out of
Prosper Aquitanicus,

Pestifero vomuit coluber sermon Britannus. Illud est, quo nomine inter
Catholicos nullo in numero esse meritus est, quod arroganter nimis vitiatam
extulerit naturam, humani arbitrii decomtor, divinae gratiae contemtor. Voss.
Hist. Pelag. l. 1. c. 4.

Quis enim unquam ante prophanum illum Pelagium tantam virtutem liberi
praesumpsit arbitrii, ut ad hoc in bonis rebus per actus singulos adjuvandum,
necessariam Dei gratiam non putaret? Vincent. Lirin. Advers. Haeres. c. 34.

Tria fuerunt capita erroris Pelagiani. Negabant originale peccatum, gratiae
necessitatem, and hominis imperfectionem in hac vita. Voss. Hist. Pelag. l. 5.
part. 1. Vide August. de Haeres. p. 256, 257, 258. Matthew. Westminster. p. 77.
Pelagius homo Britannus, persuasum habuit hominem per se salutem consequi,
suaque sponte ad justitiam contendere, ac sine originali peccato nasci, and
propterea nihil effe, quod baptizaretur. Polyd. Verg. Angl. Mist. l. 3. p. 56.
At the first Pelagius only praised Free Will, after indeed to decline envy, he
began to use the term of Grace, but he understood only by it, that God had made
us of Free Will, and preserves us in it.

Against him wrote Austen, Hierom, Cyrillus, Or^sius, Innocentius, Gennadius,
and at the last Thomas Bradwardine a Doctor here in England.

The Pelagians were so called from him, and also Caelestiani from Caelestius
one of Pelagius his Scholars. These taught that death was not the wages of sin,
but that Adam should have died, though he had not sinned. That Adams sin was
hurtful only to himself, and not to his posterity: That concupiscence was no
sin: That Infants did not draw Original sin from their Parents: That man
after the Fall had free will to do good.

Ludovicus Lavater writes that he had often heard from Pelican being old, that
no Greek Testament could be found in Germany (the first copy was brought
thither out of Italy,) although one would lay out a great deal of money for one
copy. Now such is the felicity of the times, that every Scholar has one.

My Lord Faulkland calls him the great eloquent and judicious Cardinal Perron,
and prefers him before Bellarmine and Baronius; and says of his Book against
K. James, that he was the Architect of the most glorious building, which ever
in his opinion was erected to the honor of the Church of Rome.

Peter du Moulin in his Preface to his Answer to Cardinal Perron, or his
Nouneante Du Papisme says of Perrons Answer to K. James, le ne troune point
enter les adversaires d' ouurage tant clabore, I find not so elaborate a work
amongst our enemies, Mais son peu de scavoir en la langue Grecque and es
lettres humaines le fait sonnent broncher. But his little knowledge in the
Greek tongue and in humane Learning makes him often stumble.

His book is well answered by Rivet, Peter du Moulin, and Blondell.

One of the great restorers of Learning.

Vir omnium saeculorum memoria dignissimus, Pignor. Symbol. Epist. Ep. 14.

He was born in the year 1304. and died in the year 1374. having lived 70 years
wanting but a day.

There is in his Latin Works a neat expression, a spirit sinewy and
sententious, a style short and concise. He was another Seneca.

He calls Rome the Whore of Babylon, the School and mother of error, the
Temple of heresy, the nest of treachery, and seems plainly to affirm, that
the Pope was Antichrist, declaring that no greater evil could happen to any
man, then to be made Pope.

His life is written by Papirius Massonus. There was great flocking after him,
from France and all Italy.

Sacras literas, ut humiles and incomptas, and humanioribus impares nimio
illarum amore, and contemptu harum, and opinione de se falsa, atque impotenti

Bucolica, Eclogae: and alia venustissima Poemata quae scripsit lingua
Hetrusca: and other Works mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

His Ancestors were Florentines, and lived in exile, but he returned home and
died in his own Country of an Apoplexy. He was buried at Arquato Montanere, a
village belonging unto Padua, where in honor of him a Sepulcher of Marble was
built, and an Epitaph of his own making inscribed, part whereof is as
follows, Frigida Francisci lapis hic regit ossa
Fessusque in terris, caeli requiescit in arce.


Petronius Arbiter, an obscene Writer, yet his Latin is pure and elegant.

Elmenhorstius in the life of John Wower calls Petronius Impurissimum scriptorem
purissimae latinitatis. Multae eruditionis hominem Petronium fuisse facile
cognoscimus, nam in taxandis moribus cum acrem, tum festivum maxim, and jocis

Philo Judaeus. He lived in Christ's time, and was born at Alexandria, a famous
Town in Egypt.

Though he was a Jew, yet he was altogether unskilful in the Hebrew, as the
Jews of Alexandria, and almost all the Hellenists were.

The Greek tongue was so common at Alexandria, that the Bishops, as Athanasius,
Cyrill, Theophilus, etc. there preached to the people in Greek. The Apostle
therefore writing to the Hebrews alleges to them the Scripture according to
their translation. Pet. du Moulins Antibarb. c. 10.

We may judge of his great abilities, by those little Tracts de Coena Dominica,
de Missae sacrificio, de Igne purgatorio, de Imaginum usu, and some other
things that way, and likewise of his little difference from us in the
weightiest points of our Religion, the more pity is it, that his excellent
Notes on a great part of the New Testament should so unhappily perish after his
death, as Thuanus relates.

With other Latin and Italian books of his printed, mentioned there before his
Epistles.

As he was well acquainted with Joannes Vincentius Pinellus, Marcus Velserus,
Paulus Aicardus, Janus Gruterus, Hieronymus Aleander, and many other learned
men, so he had Imagines virorum Clarissimorum in his study, many of those
before mentioned, and also Bellarmine, Baronius, Francis Petrake, Pancirolus,

He was skilled in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French.

He adorned the most inward rooms of his house with greater Geographicall
Tables or Mapes, and with the Icones of illustrious men.

He had Books sent him out of all Europe. He is much commended by Gassendus in
vita Peireskii p. 30, 31.

John Piscator.

He was an excellent Scripture-Divine, but no School-Divine, and therefore no
marvel if he want the accuratenesse of Scholasticall expressions. Dr Twisse

Pet. Pithaeus.

Casaubone never saw him (as Thuanus in the 6th book of his Commentaries
concerning his own life says) yet how does he extol him?

He had rare and exact knowledge in all Antiquity, Ecclesiastical history and
other ways.

His disposition was sweet, and he far from all ambition and deceit, he was
very prudent and skillful in mannaging affairs.

Thuanus in the first part of the fifth Tome of his Hist. l. 117. much commends
him, and at last concludes thus of him, that in the Civil Law of the Romans,
he came to that height, that it might be justly said of him, and his most
famous Master Cuiacius, Hunc discipulo praeripuisse, ne primus Jurisconsultus
esset, illum praeceptori, ne solus.

All the great men of this age (says Papirius Massonus in his Elogia) make
honorable mention of him in their books, and some of these dedicate their
Writings to him and his brother Francis, as the lights of France.

Many of his Books are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

Bartholomaeus Illud vero mirandum, quod homo Theologus, in Mathematum studiis

Anno Dom. 1561.
A Divine of profound Learning, of an acute wit, very methodicall and
perspicuous in teaching and writing.

He was a very great Mathematician, and has written several Treatises of
Triangles.

He says in the Preface to one of his Books, Alii schacchia ludunt and talis:
ego regula and circino, si quando ludere datur.

Plantavitzius.

He has written a great Dictionary for the Hebrew, and other Works. Qui summo

by Printing the King of Spains Bible, and many other excellent Works.

a most learned man. Some call him Baptista Platina, so Jac. Bergomus in suppl.
Chapter and Albertus Leander in his description of Lombardy; others call him
Bartholomaeus Platina, so Ang. Roccha and Volaterane, his Epistle to Jacobus
Picolominaeus is so, Barth. Platina. Ja. Cardinali Papiensi.

He was especially famous for his Work de vitis Pontificum usque ad Paulum II.
by whom he was cast into prison and detained four whole months, when he
undertook to defend the cause of Pomponius Laetus, and other learned men, which
were said to have conspired against him.

He was great with Pope Sixtus the 4th, and by him made keeper of the Vaticane
Library.

Anno Christi 1536.
Felix Platerus, a learned and pious Physician.

Joannes Posthius thus played on his name, Cum felix animo, felix sis divite

Felicis nomen convenienter habes.


His Works are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

Plato, he was an Athenian Philosopher; he was called (...), that is, Divine,
for his rare wisdom. Ratio dicendi facunda, dulcis, amoena, veneribus depluens,

He had his name Plato from his broad shoulders.

His Works are in one Volume.

He wrote 37 Books of the History of the world, and was Uncle to him who wrote
the Epistles, as the Epistle 16. l. 6. ad Cornelium Tacitum shows. The whole
Epistle is about the death of the elder Pliny, and begins thus, Petis ut tibi
avunculi mei exitum scribam, etc.

He sometimes labors more to write much, then exactly.

Plinius secundus the purest Writer in mine opinion of all his age, I except
not Suetonius, his two Schoolmasters, Quintilian and Tacitus, nor his most
excellent learned Uncle.

Stephanus Paschasius has these verses of him in his Icones, Me lege; nec

He was a grave and very learned Author.

He lived under Domitian and Nerva, but flourished especially under Trajane. He
was his Schoolmaster, and dedicated the Collection of his Apothegmes to him.

It was said of him, if all Authors were lost he alone might supply. Ita
judico caeterorum scriptorum jacturam vel unius Plutarchi operibus resarciri
posse. Frischlinus in defensione Aristophanis.

His Lives and Morals were his best Works. His Lives make an abridgement of all
the best things contained in the Greek and Latin Histories.

He was a follower of Plato, but an enemy to the Epicures and Stoics.

Steph. Paschas. Icon. Theodorus Gaza a Grecian born, of singular learning,
being once asked by his familiar friends, which saw him so greatly affectioned
to his study, what Author he would choose amongst many, if he could keep but
one alone, he answered Plutarke, because there is none so profitable and
delightful also to read as he.

Edward Pocock, the worthy Professor of the Hebrew and Arabic Tongues in
Oxford.

He is honorably mentioned by Gerhard on Peter, and other outlandish men.

His learned notes in Specimen hist. Arabum, and Miscellaneous Notes in Portam
Mosis give good evidence of his abilities, and I hope as he in the book last
quoted very learnedly and profitably handles the places of Scripture which he
treats of, so he will improve his knowledge in the Oriental Tongues for the
illustrating of diverse passages in Scripture.

His Works are mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

He wrote some obscene things, worthy to be burnt rather then read.

so called a Monte Politiano, a Town in Hetruria.

He had not his fellow among all those that flourished in his age, as we may
see by his Works.

He was most skillful in the Greek and Latin tongue, a famous Grammarian,
Orator and Poet.

Huic me puero a multis primae deferebantur. Mira ejus omnino eruditio,
vehemens and paratum ingenium, jugis and frequens lectio, sed calore potius
quam art versus scripsisse videtur, judicii utique parum cum in seligendo, tum
in castigando habuisse visus est. Lil. Gyrald. De Poet. nost. Temp. Dial. 1.

In his youth he did first make the Greek Poet Homer to speak in the Latin
Tongue.

Politian in the preface to his Miscel. says thus, Ac non id quaesivimus: ut
aliquam doctis hominibus veluti labeculam aspergeremus: sed id cavimus potius:
ne sub illorum auctoritate studiosorum fides periclitaretur.

See a commendation of his Miscellanies l. 3. Epist. 18. and 19. and l. 6.
Epist. 4 and l. 7. Epist. 4.

His several Works are mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

He was of a very Noble extraction, being near of kin to King Henry the 8th,
both by the Father and Mothers side, and a good Scholar.

In Calvin's Epistles and Answers Bullinger writes to Calvin, that England had
returned to the Pope and Popery, and that the devil to recover it had used two
special instruments, the Bishop of Winchester within the Kingdom, and
Cardinal Poole without it, who then was made Archbishop of Canterbury. And he
shows there that Cardinal Poole was received with great solemnity at Paul's
Cross in London; and that the Bishop of Winchester in that Assembly revoked
the Oration which he had before published under Henry the 8th, de Obedientia,
and that Cardinal Poole when he spoke to Queen Mary, blasphemously used the
words of the Angel, Ave Maria gratia plena, Dominus tecum.

He died the same day that Queen Mary died.

Lud. de Ponte Romanus.

Ludovicus Pontanus commonly surnamed Romanus, because among all the Doctors of
the Law, he chose his dwelling within Rome. He had so happy a memory, that he
never alleged the Law (and he alleged it often) but he presently rehearsed
its text all along without book.

the whole world broad enough to two enemies.

There are three esteemed miracles of nature amongst the Learned, Plato,
Aristotle, Ptolomy, which the Ancients, especially the Platonicks adorn with
three diverse Elogies. Plato is styled (...), Aristotle (...), quasi supra
sortem humanam, Ptolomy (...) admirandus, to be admired, to whom this is
singular and plainly wonderful, that he alone, or certainly alone after
Aristotle, has published books in four diverse faculties, every one of which in
its kind may be esteemed the chief with posterity.

His Works are mentioned by Boissard in his Icones.

He was the inventer, or at least a principal illustrator of the Mathematics.

John Reuchlin, or Capnio, which name (from the Germane being made Greek)
Hermolaus Barbarus gave him, when he was sent by Maximilian the Emperor to
Rome. His chief praise is, that he stirred up the study of the Hebrew tongue in
Germany. He first of all wrote an Hebrew Grammar with great perspicuity in
Latin. He invited many to learn and study the Hebrew tongue, and they received
the seeds of that doctrine from him.

He was skillful in the Law, a great Linguist, and general Scholar.

He was born in Stutgard in the Dukedom of Wirtemberg.

ornament. Eras Epist. l. 2. Epist. 1. Vide etiam ib. Epist. 4.

He lived in the time of Maximilian the Emperor. He was invited to Millaine,
by Lewis the 12th King of France, who gave him a great and royal stipend: he
taught Greek and Latin there with great praise. Afterward he did excellently
discharge the same office at Padua. But he especially got himself immortal
fame by his 30 Books of ancient readings, in which work the abstruse words of
both languages are interpreted, obscure places in many excellent writers are
explained, corruptions purged, and ancient rites manifested, many secrets drawn
out of Philosophy.

When a certain Germane found his sepulcher without an Epitaph, as it were in

Peter Ronsard Prince of the French Poets. Some call him the French Homer and
Pindar. Imitatus est homerum, ac Pindarum, Poetasque Lyricos tam apt, ut sua

quibus dici non potest, quantum delectaretur. Julius Scaliger inclyti nominis
Philosophus, ac Poeta illis temporibus vivebat. Hic admiratus Ronsardi
ingenium, Anacreontica ad eum scripsit, ac lyrae parentem honorifice vocavit:

Hieronymus Savanarola of Ferrara, by profession a Dominican, a famous
Preacher, An. 1499. he was burnt.

Being a Monk in Italy, and singularly well learned, he preached sore against
the evil life of the spiritualty, and specially of his own Order, complaining
sore upon them, as the Authors of all mischiefs and wickedness. Whereupon by
the help of certain learned men, he began to seek Reformation in his own Order.
He threatened Italy with the wrath and indignation of God, and prophesied before
unto them, that the Land should be overthrown for the pride and wickedness of
the people, and for the untruth, hypocrisy and falsehood of the Clergy, which
God would not leave unrevenged, as afterward it came to pass, when Charles the
French King came into Italy and to Rome, and so straightly beset the Pope
Alexander, that he was forced to make composition with him. Foxes Act and
Monum. Vol. 1. p. 596.

Both the Scaligers, Julius Caesar Scaliger, and Joseph his son were
excellent Scholars and famous Poets.

Andrew Melvin has these Verses of them, Scaliger aut pater, aut proles si
carmina dictat;
Scaligero solus Scaliger apta canit.
Scaligero patri par nemo, simillima proles,
Tam patri similis, quam pater ipse sibi.
Scaliger aut pater, aut proles, ambo unus, in uno aut
Est pater in nato, aut in patre natus erit.

he taxes him for being much beholding to an author in his Exercitations,
whom yet he never mentions, and for his too much contradicting of Cardane.

In his Exercitations he opposes Cardan too much; Idque non tam eruendae

In the first Volume of the Lord of Plessis his Lettres and Memoires, Casaubone
relating to him Scaligers death, says, This loss of so learned a man, wrought
in him an incredible grief, and that he for his particular had lost another
Father, and says, That he had the honor to be loved by him, and that he much
honored him according to his merit, and adds, That those which of late have
so calumniated him, will not spare now to reproach him much more; but (says
he) he will not want such as will vindicate him, Dum quidem literis melioribus
suus honor stabit.

Mounsieur Du Plessis likewise condoles with him in so great a loss, and
says, That Scaliger indeed made one of the integral parts of the better
Learning of this Age, but (says he) he was aged, and therefore to have lived
longer would have been but a burden; and he doubts not likewise but the
Jesuits would insult over this dead Lion, but it makes for Scaligers honor
(quoth he) to have such Adversaries, V^ omnis boni osores, ita and omnibus
exosos. And I assure my self, that when they shall attempt it, they shall not
do it impune, as long as you shall live, which ought therefore to redouble your
courage, that so Christianity may find a supply of the other want in your
increased abilities, as Physicians say, when one eye is lost, the other sees
the better.

palam gloriatur, tantaque ex recordatione ejus nunc etiam voluptate
perfunditur, ut concumelias, convitia, calumnias; and pericula and incommoda ab

and honestae tamque eruditae consuetud^nis amissione aut etiam oblivione nolit
redimere. Et hoc is it is pro omni ad ill^rum virulentiam responsione dictum
cupit. And adds, That in all that while in which he was acquainted with him,
he never heard him dispute of the controverted points of Religion, or that he
knew was he accustomed to write to others about them, Neque vero (says he)
nisi provocatus de iis nec nisi invitissimus disserebat; and concludes thus,
Quasi vero extra Religionis caussam non multa praeclara and supra captum,
quantum ad literas, humanum in ea admiranda essent, quae bonus quisque ab eo
cognoscere and doceri merito cuperet, and propter tam raras in eum a Deo

Johannes Scotus a famous Countreyman of ours, wrote a Book of the same
Argument, and to the same effect that Bertram had done, viz. of the Sacrament.

account with King Alfred) surnamed John the Wise, and had very lately room in

Answ. to the Jes. Challenge.

He is described to be of a sharp wit, of great eloquence, and well expert in
the Greek Tongue, pleasant and merry of nature and conditions, as appears by
diverse his doings and answers.

First, He coming to France out of his own Country of Scotland (so says Mr
Fox) by reason of great tumults of war, was there worthily entertained, and
for his Learning had in great estimation of Carolus Calvus the French King;
whom he commonly and familiarly used to have about him, both at Table, and in
Chamber.

Mr Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 186, 187. Matthaeus Westmonasteriensis. p.
171. has the same.
Upon a time the King sitting at meat, and seeing something (belike in this John
Scot) which seemed not very courtly, cast forth a merry word, asking of him,
What difference there was betwixt a Scot and a Sot? Whereunto the Scot sitting
over against the King, somewhat lower, replied again suddenly, rather then
advisedly, yet merrily, saying, Mensa tantum, that is, the Table only:
importing thereby himself to be the Scot, and so calling the King a Sot by
craft.

Another time the same King being at Dinner was served with a certain dish of
fish, wherein were two great fishes, and a little one. After the King had taken
thereof his repast, sets down to Johannes Scotus the foresaid fish to
distribute unto the other two Clerks, sitting there with him: which were two
tall and mighty persons, he himself being but a little man. Johannes takes the
fish, of the which, the two great he takes and carveth to himself; the little
fish he reaches to the other two. The King perceiving his division thus made,
reprehended the same. Then Johannes, whose manner ever was to find out some
honest matter to delight the King, answered to him again, proving his division
to stand just and equal: For here (says he) be two great, and a little,
pointing to the two great fishes and himself: and likewise here again is a
little one, and two great, pointing to the little fish, and two great persons:
I pray you (says he) what distribution can be more equal? Whereat the King
with his Nobles being much delighted, laughed merrily.

He was impiously murdered and slain by his Scholars with their pen-knives at
Malmesbury. Joannes Scotus alias Erigena dictus scripsit Commentarios in libros

Carolus Scribanius a Jesuit, under the name of Clarus Bonarscius, Vidistine

barbariae and impudentiae conflarum, qualis est ille qui edidit librum cui in

(which is an Anagram to his name) made four Latin Books, which he entitleth
Amphitheatrum honoris, horroris he might have said.

That he was the Author of that Book, appears both by an Epistle of Andreas
Schottus the Jesuit, whose Autograph is yet kept, and also by the Catalogue of
the Writers of that Society published by Ribadeneira at Antwerp, in which it is
expressly mentioned, that Carolus Scribanius was the Author of the four Books
of the Amphitheater of honor.

He says there, That all those who adhere not to their holy Society, are no
better then Calvinists.

He got his great knowledge in the Oriental Languages after he fell to the study
of the Law.

Some like his Marmora Arundeliana, some his Books concerning the Jewish Rites
and Customs, others much commend his Titles of Honor; but I must confess my
self to be most taken with that De Diis Syris, wherein he opens many places of
Scripture. Others, I believe also are of the same judgment.

He is honorably mentioned by many outlandish men.

He wrote in all his Books (...), above all Liberty, to show, that he would
examine things, and not take them upon trust.

As if you should say Doctrinale, in which the Jews have made as it were their
Canon Law, and their Divinity out of the sentences and examples of their
ancient Doctors, after the same manner that Peter Lombard the book of
Sentences, and Gratian the Decrees among the Papists. That work was first begun
as the Jews themselves, Masius, Genebrard and Petrus Galatinus have recorded,
within two hundred years from the Nativity of Christ, although it was long
after finished, at least the Babylonian Talmud, for the Talmud of Jerusalem was
sooner published. See Buxtorfs Bibliotheca concerning the Editions of these two
Talmuds.

There are two parts of the Talmud, the Mischna containing the Text of the
Talmudical Law. This came out about the year of Christ 150. This was read,
explained and disputed in the Academies of Jerusalem and Babylon. Those
disputations and the decisions of them were called Gemara. So of the Mischna
and Gemara came the Jerusalem Talmud Anno Christi 230. But the Babylonish
Talmud more perfect and copious, finished about the year of Christ 500.

The ancientest of the Latin Fathers.

He was expert both in Greek and Latin, was a great Philosopher, Lawyer, would
dispute well, was eloquent in writing.

When the Christians were vexed with wrongs, and falsely accused of the
Gentiles, Tertullian taking their cause in hand, defends them against their
persecutors, and their slanderous accusations.

Cyprian Bishop of Carthage so esteemed his writings, that he read somewhat in
them every day, and called him his Master, he would say to his servant, Da
Magistrum, that is, Tertullian.

Jerome also commends him much in his Apologeticall Book against the Gentiles.

Some much commend his Apology, Heraldus and others have commented on that.

that some think, there is nothing more learned, and more orderly disposed,
published in that kind. Thuanus and Casaubone slight him.

A most famous Historian, both for his eloquence and faithfulness.

The beginning, continuance and end of the Peloponnesian war is most exactly
described by Thucidides an Athenian Gentleman, the Penner thereof, who
flourished in that time, and saw the war with his eyes, from the beginning to
the end; yea was a chief Captain therein, a Writer for certain truth of
History, and perfect reckoning of time most excellent, and of such account in
the Ages following, that even the best followed him, and gave credit to him.
Demosthenes the famous Orator of Athens, took pains to copy out his Books
eight times with his own hand, as Lucian reports. Livelies Chronology of the

succedentes Pontifices, maximo Cardinalium, Praelatorum, Oratorum and
clarissimorum virorum concurtu verba fecerit, and auditorum animos in
admirationem adduxerit, non tam verborum elegantia, quam sententiarum
gravitate, reconditae doctrinae excellentia, ordinis dispositione, ingenii

Beza much commended his Commentary on John to Casaubone, as Casaubone relates
in his Epistle to Fronto Ducaeus, and deservedly says he, Nam in ejus scriptis
quae legi, cum excellent rerum Philosophicarum and Theologicarum notitia, par
erat modestia; quae judicio meo tum in alio quovis scriptore, tum in Theologo
potissimum, laus est vel praecipua.

He has commented also upon Luke, on the Epistle to the Romans.

And put out several other Works.

Cardinal D' Ossat in the second Book of his French Letters says, When he
perceived himself near death, he sent to the Pope then to desire his holy
Benediction, as it is the custom of people of quality when they find
themselves in such extremity: and his Holiness (says he) without an example
of the like in our time, went from his lodging to give it him in person, and
stayed with him about half an hour, comforting him, and weeping bitterly, and
in the end taking his leave of him, he kissed him in the forehead, and after
his death, caused him to be buried with great and public solemnity.

He was brought up from a child in the University of Oxford, where he by long
continuance grew up, and increased as well in the knowledge of Tongues, and
other liberal Arts, as specially in the knowledge of the Scriptures, whereunto
his mind was singularly addicted: Insomuch that he lying then in
Magdalen-Hall, read privily to certain Students and Fellows of
Magdalen-Colledge some parcel of Divinity; instructing them in the knowledge
and truth of the Scriptures. Whose manners also and conversation, being
correspondent to the same, were such, that all they that knew him, reputed and
esteemed him to be a man of most virtuous disposition, and of life unspotted.
Fox. Act. and Monum. vol. 2. p. 361, etc.

He translated the New Testament into English, and five Books of Moses. He
wrote also diverse other Books, which are all published in one general Volume,
as also the Works of John Frith and Barns.

He was put to death in Flanders at Filford Anno Dom. 1536. crying thus at the
Stake with a fervent zeal, and a loud voice, Lord open the King of Englands
eyes.

He is drawn with a Bible in his hand, and this Distick, Hac ut luce tuas
dispergam Roma tenebras,
Spoute extorris ero, sponte Sacrificium.

an eloquent Lawyer and Phlosopher.

The Bishops of Rome, Clement and Paul used his service in Germany.

He was in high favor with King Ferdinando, so much that when his daughter
Katharine was born, Vergerius and George Marquess of Branderburg, and John
Archbishop of Lunden were her Godfathers at the Font. But after he revolted
from the Bishop of Rome by a wonderful occasion, when he was sent for to Rome
from the Conference of Worms, which was in the beginning of the year 1541.

The Pope going about to make new Cardinals, appointed him also among others.
But there were some which privily whispered in his ear, that he was now through
much familiarity with the Germans become a Lutherane. After that Vergerius had
heard this by Cardinal Ginucius, unto whom the Pope had told it, he was
marvellously astonished. And to the intent he might purge himself, he goes
home into his Country, and begins a book, which he entitled, against the
Apostates of Germany.

And whilst to confute their Arguments, he turns over diligently the books of
his Adversaries, Sleid. Comment. l. 21. fol. 329. See more there.
and pondering deeply their reasons: He feels himself taken and vanquished.
Then casting away all hope of his Cardinalship, he goes to his brother John
Baptist Bishop of the City of Pole, and reciting the whole matter, asks his
counsel. His brother being afraid at the beginning, lamenteth his case much.
But after he was persuaded by him to apply himself to the searching of the
Scripture, and had considered diligently that Article of Justification,
comparing the sentences together, he gives place, and judges the Bishop of
Romes Doctrine to be false. Whereupon they rejoiced together. And as the duty
of Bishops is, began to instruct the people in Istria, and preach diligently
the benefit of Christ employed upon mankind, and declare what works God
requires of us, to the intent they might call men again to the true Religion.

Parthenope: Cecini pascua, rura, Duces.
Olai Wormii Musaeum Wormianum. l 2. c. 13. Some compare him with Homer, nay
prefer him before him; others style him Homer in Latin.

This was said upon the coming forth of Virgils Aeneads.

Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii,
Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade.
He set this Distick upon the Palace-gate of the Emperor Augustus, Nocte pluit
tota, redeunt spectacula mane,
Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.


As much to say, God shows his power by the night rains, Caesar his
magnificence by the pomps of the day.

These two Verses were very well liked, and brought to the Emperors Majesty,
who took great pleasure in them, and willed the Author should be known. A
sausie Courtier pretended to be the man, and had a good reward given him, for
the Emperor himself was not only learned, but very munificent toward all
learned men. Virgil seeing himself by his overmuch modesty defrauded of the
reward, which an impudent person had gotten by abuse of his merit, came the
next night, and fastened upon the same place this half Meter, four times
iterated, thus

Sic vos non vobis.
Sic vos non vobis.
Sic vos non vobis.
Sic vos non vobis.
And there it remained a great while, because no man wist what it meant, till
Virgil opened the whole fraud by this devise. He wrote about the same half
Metres this whole Verse hexameter, Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores.

Sic vos non vobis
Fertis aratra boves.
Sic vos non vobis
Vellera fertis oves.
Sic vos non vobis
Mellificatis apes.
Sic vos non vobis
Nidificatis aves.
And then finished the four half Metres, thus And put to his name Publius
Virgilius Maro.

This matter came by and by to the Emperors ear, who taking great pleasure in
the devise, called for Virgil, and gave him not only a present reward, but also
held him ever after upon larger trial he had made of his Learning and Virtue
in so great reputation, as he vouchsafed to give him the name of Amicus, which
among the Romans was a great honor and special favor.

He made a Talisman, or brazen Fly, which he set upon one of the gates of the
City Naples. which for the space of eight years kept all manner of Flies from
coming into the City. Gaffarels Unheard of Curiosities, Part. 2. Chap. 7. See
more there.

The purity of his style and conceptions is generally known, and the purity of
his manners, was once admired by those of Naples, which for this reason
commonly called him Parthenius.

Jo. Annaeus Viterbiensis.

A Monk by profession, who lived some two hundred years ago, having attained to
more then ordinary knowledge both of the Tongues and Histories, applied himself
by his knowledge and proficiency, not to help, but to cheat the world. To that
end he counterfeited diverse ancient Historians of best note and greatest
antiquity, as Berosus, Manotho, Catonis Origines, and the like, which had not
been heard of in many ages; and wrote Comments upon them, these passed so
current for a long time, that even to this day (though descryed by diverse
learned men of all Nations and professions) many can scarce persuade
themselves, that so many fine titles and shows should be but a piece of
juggling.

Scaliger in his Elench Orat. Chronol. Parei calls him Fanaticum Dominicanum.
And elsewhere in that Book he says, Vt doctior videatur, mendacia sua
auctoritate priscorum auctorum f^^mare conatur. Propterea commentus est

non fuerunt, aut ea non scripserunt, quae planus illo eos scripsisse mentitur.

Gotfridus Vitebergensis.

He was learned in the Hebrew, Greek, Chaldee, and Latin Tongues, and many
vulgar ones.

He got himself a great name by his universal Chronicle, which because it
contains a History of all Princes, and they are styled Gods in Scripture, he
named it Pantheon.

published nothing but a very elegant Preface to the Greek Grammar of Demetrius

He has a great name deservedly amongst the Reformed Churches, for his skill

for his great Abilities with the Papists themselves, though yet he be accounted
haereticus primae Classis in their Index Expurg.

too hard for, though the Bishop was then very young) in one of his books says,

Antonius Walaeus.

He was an orthodox and solid Divine, as his several learned Works in one
Volume in Folio show.

Albigensibus and Waldensibus multa per calumniam impacta fuerunt a curiae

Waldenses.

Our Historians confound the Albigenses and Waldenses, though some learned men
hold they are to be distinguished.

The Waldenses are famous for their Antiquity, Universality and Innocence.

The first original of the Waldenses came of Waldus, a man of great substance
in the City of Lions. About the year of our Lord 1160. diverse of the best of
the City of Lions talking and walking in a certain place after their old
accustomed manner, especially in the Summer time, conferred together upon
matters. Amongst whom it chanced one (the rest looking upon) to fall down by
sudden death. This Waldus being one of them, who beholding the matter more
earnestly then the other, and terrified with so heavy an example, Gods holy
Spirit working with all, was stricken with a deep and inward repentance,
whereupon followed a new alteration with a careful study to reform his former
life. He admonished others also to repent, and ministered large alms of his
goods to such as needed. Foxes Acts and Monum. vol. 1 p. 299. See more there.
Many people therefore daily resorting to him, and he seeing them ready and
diligent to learn, he began to give out to them certain rudiments of the
Scripture, which he had translated himself into the French Tongue.

The Bishops seeing him so to intermeddle with Scriptures, and to have such
resort about him, albeit it was but in his own house under private conference,
threatened to excommunicate him, if he did not leave so to do. He despising
their Excommunication, they ceased not with prison, with sword and banishment
to persecute him, till at length they had driven both Waldus and all the
favorers of his true preaching out of the City. Whereupon came first their
name, and they were called Waldenses, or Pauperes de Lugduno, because they
being thrust out both of Country and goods, were compelled to live poorly
whether they would or no. See Doctor Chalon. Credo Ecclesiam Sanctam
Catholicam. part. 2. page 91, 92, 93, 94.

Wesselus Groningensis, otherwise named Basilius.

He preceded Luther, he was excellently learned in Physic, Divinity, in the
Greek, Hebrew and Latin, and therefore of the people he was called Lux mundi,
the light of the world, whom Luther was wont to call his prodromus. He
demonstrated that the Pope was Antichrist, whom the Disciples of Christ ought
in no ways to follow.

He wrote a Book De dignitate and potestate Ecclesiastica, in which book, he
says, That Subjects should be absolutely and simply bound to believe the Pope,
is so irrational and full of blasphemy, that it is found more pestilent then
any heresy whatsoever.

Being aged, upon a certain time when a young man called M. Joannes
Ostendorpius, came to him, he said these words; Well my child, thou shall live
to that day, when thou shall see that the doctrine of these new and contentious
Divines, as Thomas and Bonaventure, with others of the same sort, shall be
utterly rejected and exploded from all true Christian Divines.

And this which Ostendorpius then being young heard Weselus to speak, he
reported himself to Noviomagus, which wrot^ this story, Anno 1520. and heard it
of the mouth of the said Weselus, Anno 1490. Foxes Act. and Monum. vol. 1. p.

John Whitgift Archbishop of Canterbury.

He had an Uncle called Robert Whitgift, Abbot of the Monastery of Wellow in
Lincolnshire, who teaching diverse young Gentlemen, took like pains also with
him. In which time (as he was pleased often to remember) he heard his Uncle the
Abbot say, Sir George Pawle in his life
That they, and their Religion could not long continue, because (said he) I
have read the whole Scripture over and over, and could never find therein,
that our Religion was founded by God. And for proof of his opinion, the Abbot
would allege that saying of our Savior Matthew. 15.13. Every plant which my
heavenly Father has not planted. shall be rooted out.

He never preached, but he first wrote his Notes in Latin, and afterward kept
them during his Life.

There were several writings between him and Thomas Cartwright about the
Ceremonies.

Inceptor Ockam.

John Hus was his Scholar, he brought his Books and Doctrine into Bohemia.

He being the public Reader in the University of Oxford, was for the rude time
wherein he lived, famously reputed for a great Clerk, and expert in all kind
of Philosophy.

He flourished about the year of our Lord 1371. Edward the third reigning in
England. He was called Doctor Evangelicus.

He was born in the North, and to this day some of his name and family do there
yet remain, to whom I am allied.

He was brought up in Merton College in Oxford, and removed thence to Queens
College.

He was beloved of all good men for his good life, and greatly admired of all
his adversaries for his Learning and knowledge both in Divinity and humanity.
He was Doctor in Divinity almost thirty years, and for some time Parson of
Lutterworth in Leicestershire. See Camden there.

Diverse Works of his in written-hand remain in our Oxford-Library.

He translated the whole Bible into English, with Prefaces and Arguments to
every book.

In his Trialogus. or Body of Divinity, l. 4. c. 7. he says,

Id^o si centum essent Papae and omnes fratres essent versi in Cardinales, non
deberet conce^isententiae suae in materia fidei, nisi de quanto se fundaverit
in Scriptura. He also says, Papa est abominatio desolationis in abstracto. And
Chapter 36. Olim Episcopi nostri dicuntur pseudofratres tanquam Diabolos odivisse,
cum in tempore Domini Armachani, dicuntur ipsum in sumptibus contra hos pseudo
ordines defendisse. Sed modo facti sunt amici Herodes and Pilatus, qui prius
inter se fuerant inimici.

There is also his Dialogus, and De Veritate Scripturae, and diverse other
Manuscripts of his well worthy the publishing.

Yet he had his errors, lib. 2. of that Book, cap. 10. he says, Angelos
adoramus.

See those Scriptures against that opinion, Deuteronomy. 4.19. and 17.3. Col. 2.18.
Apoc. 9.10. and 20.8, 9.

He grants Purgatory also l. 4. c. 22. of that book. Yet he was the first
(says Bale) who in that dark age brought truth to light, and was bold openly
to confess Christ before the whole Synagogue of Satan, and to reveal the
filthiness of the great Whore.

His right name was Preston, for Widdrington was a plain illiterate man. He and
Blackwell took the Oath of Allegiance.

He wrote to the Pope, and earnestly begged of him, that the Papists here might
take that just Oath of Allegiance ^o the King, and refuted Bellarmine, who
opposed it with strong reasons.

This Oath (viz. of Allegiance) according to every part and parcel of the same
may be lawfully taken by any Catholic, as have averred both M. Widdrington,
Sir William Howard, and others. Widdrington in his New-years-gift, has
sufficiently proved, that besides the authority of many famous Divines, it was
the opinion of the chiefest secular Priests in England. Doctor Featleys

The sayings of the Scripture, with which he sustained himself against
temptations on his deathbed, were these, Joh. 3.16. Mat. 11.29. 1 John 1.7.
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.

Huldricus Zuninolius, Anno 1487.

Natione Helvetius, vir vere pius and solid doctus, cum in omni literarum
genere, tum in sacra^ ^hilosophia, and tribus linguis eruditissimis, Latina
inquam, Graeca and Hebraica, atque in vernaculo, id est, Germanico sermon
disertissimus, immortali laud apud omnem posteritatem dignus: quem adolescens
olim Vetus Testamentum Latin Tiguri enarrantem, and in Ecclesiis Germanice
verbum Dei enucleantem, audivi: sed prob dolor nimium brevi tempore Gesn.
Biblioth. Zuinglius etiam vir fortis alioquin and animosus, cum secum
reputaret, quod si domi resideret, ac prae^um forte fieret adversum, fore, ut
magnam ipse sustineret invidiam, quasi concionibus quidem accenderet hominum
animos, in ipso autem discrimine mollesceret, voluit omnino Communem subire
mortem. In corpus autem examine adeo saevitum fuit, and vix etiam illius morte
potuit odii ^cerbiras exaturari. Natus erat annos quadraginta quatuor, junior
Luthero quatuor annis. Sleid. De Statu Relig. and Reipub. Comment. lib. 8.
Repertus est multis vulneribus confectus Zuinglius, qui primus ad Helvetios
attulit pestifera Lutheranorum dogmata: eisque ob singularem, qua maxim inter
Helvetios flor^bat, opimonem virtutis, doctrinae and sapientiae, assidue
imperitorum animos imbuebat: cognitum postea est, pagum qui Tigutinus
appellatur, quique omnium infidelium habetur caput, ex CCC. Senatoribus, ad
septem tantumque eo confecto praelio esse redactum. Sadolet. Epist. l 7.
Accolitus Sadoleto. Vide Epist. Oecolamp. and Zuing. lib. 4. page 211.
As Germany admired her Luther, so Helvetia her Zuinglius.

He was skillful in the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, though hard to be got at that
time, using the best Professors; he had a great memory, being able to repeat
Valerius Maximus and St Paul by heart, whose Epistles he had copied out. He
frequently disputed with both Papists and Catabaptists, whereof Franciscus
Lambertus then a minorite Friar being one, was (as he thankfully acknowledged)
hereby reclaimed, and became afterward a great Light in the Church.

Stando confecit omnia sua studia, certas eis vendicans horas, quas etiam non
omisit nisi seriis coactus. A summo mane ad horam decimam lectioni,
interpretationi, Osvaldus Myconius De vita and obitu Zuinglii. Vide plura ibid.
doctrinae, scriptioni dabat operam, prout temporis and rerum postulabat ratio.
Post prandium audiebat vel narrantes, vel consilia rogitantes, aut
confabulabatur, aut deambulabat cum amicis, usque ad horam secundam, hinc etiam
reditus ad labores. Post Coenam ubi paulisper deambulasset, fere literis
scribendis vocabat, interdum ad mediam usque noctem nihil agens aliud.

The Tigurius being compelled to war against their enemies, Zuinglius was
slain in the battle.

It is the manner of Zurick, that when they go forth in warfare, the chief
Minister of their Church goes with them. Zuinglius also of himself being a man
of a stout and bold courage, considering that if he should tarry at home, and
they should go by the worse, what displeasure he should sustain, as one that in
his Sermons would encourage, and himself faint, when any danger was; would
needs take such part as others.

Sir Thomas More in his Preface to the Confutation of Tyndals Answer, has this
bitter passage, Zuinglius that first brought into Switzerland that abominable
Heresy against the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, was by the hand of God this
year slain in plain battle against the Catholics, with many a thousand of his
wretched Sect, being in number to the Catholics three against one, and as
proudly, and with his malicious purpose invading them, as ever did the
Egyptians pursue the children of Israel.

His Works are published in four Tomes, mentioned by Boissard,

After his body was cut first in four pieces, and then consumed with fire,
three days after his death his friends came to see whether any part of him was
remaining, where they found his heart in the ashes whole and unburned.
