An Advertisement to the Reader.
IT is now just ten years since I Collected, Printed, and Published, a
Catalogue of all the English Stage Plays that were ever till then Printed; I
then took so great care about it, that now, after a ten years diligent search
and enquiry I find no great mistake; I only omitted the Masks and
Entertainments in Ben. Johnsons first Volume. There was then in all, 690.
several Plays; and there has been, since that time, just an hundred more
Printed; so, in all, the Catalogue now amounts to (those formerly omitted now
added) 806. I really believe there are no more, for I have been these twenty
years a Collector of them, and have conversed with, and enquired of those that
have been Collecting these fifty years. These, I can assure you, are all in
Print, for I have seen them all within ten, and now have them all by me within
thirty. Although I took care and pains in my last Catalogue to place the Names
in some methodical manner, yet I have now proceeded further in a better method,
having thus placed them. First, I begin with Shakespeare, who has in all
written forty eight. Then Beaumont and Fletcher fifty two, Johnson fifty,
Shirley thirty eight, Heywood twenty five, Middleton and Rowley twenty seven,
Massenger sixteen, Chapman seventeen, Brom seventeen, and D' Avenant fourteen;
so that these ten have written in all, 304. The rest have every one written
under ten in number, and therefore I pass them as they were in the old
Catalogue, and I place all the new ones last. I have not only seen, but also
read all these Plays, and can give some account of every one; but I shall not
be so presumptuous, as to give my Opinion, much less, to determine or judge of
every, or any man's Writing, and who writ best; but I will acquaint you with
some of my Observations, and so conclude. He that was the first Play-writer, I
find to be one Heywood, not Thomas, but John Heywood, who writ seven several
Plays, which he calls Interludes; and they are very old, being Printed with
the first of our English Printing; and he makes notable work with the then
Clergy. And indeed, by only reading of Plays, I find that you may be
acquainted with the humors of that present Age wherein they were written. Also
by Plays alone you may very well know the Chronicle History of England, and
many other Histories. I could enlarge much on this account, having for my own
fancy written down all the Historical Plays in a succinct orderly method, as
you may do the like; I observe that Plays were not only written by professed
Poets, but also by the best Scholars, and Persons of Honor and Eminency;
especially, in these last hundred Plays, and not only Male, but Female
Writers; there being seven of them in all, four whereof in these last hundred.
Although there are but 806. Plays in all Printed, yet I know that many more
have been written and Acted, I my self have some quantity in Manuscript; and
although I can find but twenty five of Tho. Heywoods in all Printed, yet (as
you may read in an Epistle to a Play of his, called The English Traveller) he
has had an entire hand, or, at least, a main Enger in the writing of 220. and,
as I have been informed, he was very laborious; for he not only Acted almost
every day, but also obliged himself to write a sheet every day, for several
years together; but many of his Plays being composed and written loosely in
Taverns, occasions them to be so mean; that except his Loves Mistress, and,
next to that, his Ages, I have but small esteem for any others. I could say
somewhat more of him, and of all the old Poets, having taken pleasure to
converse with those that were acquainted with them, but will conclude thus;
that as John Heywood was the first English Play-writer, so in my Opinion, one
Thomas Merit^^, who writ two Pamphlets, which he calls Plays, viz. Love and
War, and the Wandering Lover, was the worst. And although I dare not be absolute
in my Opinion, who is the best of this Age, yet I should be very disingenuous,
if I should not conclude, that the English Stage is much improved and adorned
with the several Writings of several persons of Honor; but, in my Opinion
chiefly with those of the most accomplished Mr. John Dreyden.

Yours, Fra. Kirkman.

Be pleased to excuse the misplacing of 4. of B^n. Johnsons Entertainments in
