TO The Right Worshipfool, Honorable, Right Royal, Noble, Puissant, most
Excellent, Arrogant, and Notorious Warrier, Colonel, Captain, Lieutenant,
Sergeant, Corporal, Musketeiro Bownce:
I dedicate these my strange, happy, and unfortunate Adventures. Terrible Sir,

I Dare not question but that you have read the famous story of our Brother
Man-Devil, and shook hands with many of his Baboons, danced a ^otch Horn-pipe
with his Dragons, and taught ^any of his Cat-a-mountains to play of the
^irginals; but all this is from the purpose, the ^ry I am to relate is more
wonderful, and ^lmost) as true (if not altogether.) Were St. ^orge now living,
I could teach him twenty ^yes to cut up a Dragon, and instruct fa^ous Guy of
Warwick, twice as many ways Carbonado a dun Cow; and with another ^^ck that I
have, he should kill Colbrand the ^^a^t with a Poddgun; though Captain Drake
was a brave fellow for the Sea, and could swim like a fish, yet it is well known
to most of the valiant Dutchmen, that I can drink like a fish; and though he
could bore a hole in the side of a ship, I can pierce one in the head of a
Kilderkin, and in fire-work I have as much skill as he, my nose shall make it
good, which did but drop once into a barrel of Gunpowder, and it blew up a
whole Leagure, but I must confess such a fire-work has cost many a man his
whole estate, and so it did mine; but what has any man to do with my nose, my
name is Firedrake; nay I have an unmerciful name, for my name is called Water
Firedrake, and all the world knows fire and water are unmerciful Elements, then
sure I think the Sea-Captains must confess me the better Drake, i^ respect I
am as well for fire as water, and believe the man that kills me were as goo^
run through fire and water, for he shall find^ me then a Man-Drake; but leaving
this lon^ Epistle, I will proceed to the adventures ^^ him

That is your most obedient Servant cut your throat, or your friend whenever
you shall command him Walter Firedra^^

The Knight Adventurer: OR, The Infamous and Abominable History of that
terrible, troublesome, and vainglorious Knight Sir FIREDRAKE.
The first Adventure.
IT was about the year two thousand eight hundred ninety ten, when Will Summers
was Lord Mayor of Golding-Lane, and Tarleton was his Sword Bearer, that I, and
half a score Knights more that shall be namelesse, because I think they were
never christened* marched forth the five and thirtieth day of December, to a
dangerous, dismal, terrible and frightful desert, known by the name of
Black Heath, where we met with a monstrous Giant, called by men that knew him
Butcherino, with a great Club in's neck, and a long piece of Iron by his side
at his girdle, on which he often whets his ^loody knife, when he commits Lamb
slaughter, and it seems he had been upon some adventure; for he had conquered
some nine or ten wild beasts, which roared and bellowed as if it had been
thunder; their skins were all black, and each of them upon their moustrous
heads two mighty horns, only one little wild beast, with a white face; I think
they called him Essex, he had no horns, and when he eat, his saws went awry,
as if they had been practizing to sing Prick-song; but he had a very small
voice; I did no sooner meet this aforesaid Giant Butcherino, but I came behind
him, and gave^ him such a clap on the pate, that I made him shake his heels
without music, which when a terrible wild beast he had by him, that uses t^
keep his house, whose name was Balie, saw me^ so confound his Master
Butcherino, he flies upon me with open mouth, and catches hol^ of one of my
hind quarters; and had it no^ been for the Knights, I think he had torn me^
sufficiently; away run all the wild beasts, an^ in conclusion, we did not take
Butcherino life, but cased him of a burden of some fort^ pounds he had in his
pocket; having thus taken away his Treasure, we left him bou^^ hand and foot,
and with little loss of bl^^ came off fairly, with this adventure; so w^^ went
some ten miles further, and equal^ shared the Treasure of Butcherino amon^ us,
and this was the end of my brave and first valiant Adventure, and now I shall
go forward to the next, if your patience will give me audience.

The second Adventure shows how he and his Comrogues aslaulted the thatched
Castle of Farmar-ello, and how they escaped.
THe Treasure being ^pent, which we by our valor and prowess purchased from
Butcherino, in spite of Balls teeth; ere we had walked some ten and twenty
miles, we lost a fair and well-beloved Damozella, whose name was Pecunia, which
we before had stolen from Usurero King of Manypence; the Maid being gone, we
were all mightily dismayed; yet meeting at the last with a Squire of low degree,
whose name was Beggarillo, a servant to the Maunding Knight of the Clappdish, a
very able Knight, and one that never goes without a thousand pieces about him
(though he never wore purse or pockets) who had always a Rampant Monster at
his command, called Louse-Crackero, and the Palfry he rid upon was Flea-bitten;
the aforesaid Squire (belonging to this Knight) said, he could tell us tidings
of our great loss the Lady Pecunia, which when we demanded, he declared to
me, and my Com-Raskal, Rob-in Highway, the relation in this manner.

The Speech of Beggarillo to the Knights.
YOu puissant Knights, and unbeloved Warriers, who scorn to fight on equal
terms with any man, for you think he is not worthy to combat with you that is
not an abler man (I mean in purse g^d Knights) for which cause you are always
suspected to be noble and valiant, because you relieve the weaker side; Arthurs
Knights were of the Order of the Round Table: The Knights of Malta, of the
Order of the Red-Cross, but you of the Disorder of the highway: You are the
Knights that keep men from many ill vices: A traveller that meets with you
shall not be drunk that night, lie with his Hostis's daughter, or lose his many
at Tables: Likewise you ease him of many verations; for when he parts from you,
he has not a Cross about him; you have an excellent way to keep him from
swearing (I mean some oaths that many swear against your will in the Kingdom)
which are these (by the cross of this sixpence; or, I wish this silver were
melting in my guts) Then if he cannot swear these oaths, I am sure the Tapster
will not give him leave to sweat these oaths; would this drink may be my
poison; or, would this bread may choke me: nay he must not dare to swear (so
gently as a Weichman) by this Cheele. And now I have given you your noble
titles, I will discover to you where your Damosel the Lady Pecunia is,
therefore I pray give good ear to me.

The Description,
Just at the foot of the next steepy hill,
There lives a Giant (if it be thy will)
Between 2 fields, one green, the other yellow,
This Giant dwells, whose name is Farmarello,
About his fields his servants all are plyant,
And just before the Castle of this Giant
There stands a Fort, which he does call Dispatch
The walls are board, the roof is English thatch,
Within this Fort he does his Madmen keep,
One with a long Bro^^ all the Fort does sweep;
Two others do with cudgels, they call Flails,
Lay on, as they had Nettles in their tails,
Not on each other, it is the Giants Law,
That they lie all day long a beating straw,
Which is no sooner beaten, but there comes
A rank of wild beasts without Fifes or Drumms
Does bring in more (and they are driven thence
By names I nere read in my Accidence:)
I think I can remember what they be;
Ball, Pie-ball, Villiar, Sorrel, Gee, Ho, Ree.
Before the Fort, and at the righter hand
Does monstrous Racks, and many horn-beasts stand
And in this Farmarello's house I wis
Your Damozella fair Pecunia is,
But have a care; you will enter on your danger,
Beware the beasts that lie at Rack and Manger.
Thus the Courteous Squire Beggarillo delivered to us where we might atchieve
again the beauty of the fair Pecunia (which in English is called Madam Money)
ere we got to the foot of the hill it was midnight, and coming near the house
of this massy Giant Farmarello; we heard the roaring and mooing of his beasts,
the fluttering of his Eagles, the mewing of his house-trap, the sworting of his
servants, the sueezing of his Maidens; no light appeared in the house, and (a
Pox take them) I heard two of Balls kindred grumbling of Logic together; but
they were in two little Block-houses, which in English you call Kennels, I am
sure every straw appeared unto me like a piece of Ordnance (I cry you mercy, I
have a little forgot my self) I could not see indeed, 'cause it was midnight,
but I am sure I thought I saw the straws; well, for all this, what we could not
do by violence, we did by policy, so we put our unhappy Squire in at
Farmarello's window, where he most softly (as he has a rare Art that way)
crept up to the Chamber where the Giant lay snorting by his Gyantess
Dousabella; and putting his hand into the Gyant's pocket, he took the keys
outs found out the Prison where Pecunia was lodged, opens the window, and
throws her with the rest of her kindred Mris. Argent, and Mris. Aurum out into
our Arms, for they had been kept in a great deal of slavery, and put into
Canvasse-baggs, instead of Black-baggs: When our Squire had thus released the
Ladies, as he was coming down softly Farmarello's stairs, he fell down, and
broke his leg (and broke the neck of a Proverb too, which says, he that goes
foftly, goes safely) off went a Canon (shot by Farmarello) up rose the
Kitchen-wench with the Spit, Squire Tom with a Ladle, Hob Carter with a Whip,
Tim Thrashwell with a Flayl, Dousabella with a Distaff, out flew Ball and his
Nephew with ^loggs at their Arses, away run we with the Ladies at our Arses;
they cried, stop Thieves, we cried run Knights; but Rob-in Highway mistaking
the Road, run himself into a Mill-pond; one of Farmare^lo's servants being
betwixt sleeping and waking, in earnestness to apprehend him, fell after him,
at last all the rest of us escaped, but went all several ways, only I kept
the Road some twenty miles together, and at the next Town caused my Lady
Pecunia to buy me a horse to follow adventures; the next chapter you shall see
an end of me.

My last Adventure, wherein is declared the pursuit of the Giant Farmarello,
how he sent forth his men of War: and how strangely I was taken Prisoner.
AFter this our strange escape from the dismal Giant Farmarello, which made us
all dispersed, I with my Lady Pecunia by my side, continued on the Road until I
came unto a Town (which is now out of my remembrance there at my friend
Tapsterino's Castle, my Lady and I had entertainment, where I bought me an
horse of his Squire Ostlero, but when I had sollaced my self all night with my
Lady Pecunia, I resolved the next day to ride upon more Adventures, but so soon
as ever I was mounted on my Palfry, I had tidings brought me by Beggarillo,
that one of Farmarello's Knights, that was a Dutchman, whose name was Hue an
cry, Van Hang an draw, with another Knight and an English man, whose name was
Constabello, with a band of armed men called Officero's, that followed to
surprise us for the Ladies, which the Squire that broke his leg confessed I
had carried away, and withal gave him notice of all our names; I no sooner
heard this news, but the Giants Knights were in sight of me, upon that I set
spurs to my Palfry, and fled from them, for I knew there was no contending
against so many able Knights; so away rid I, they after me crying, stop thief:
Upon these words, a Squire that met me, offered to lay hold on my Bridle, for
which cause I knocked him down, and still continued my speed; after that, two
more met me, and would have stopped me, had I not rid over one, and knocked
down the other: Thus I perceiving how generally envious the Country was against
me (because prevention is the heart of policy) I resolved to knock down every
man I met or over-took, before they should have warning to apprehend me; or
after I was past them, to tell the Giants Knights which way I code; a man would
have thought this had been a pretty piece of policy, but it happened to be my
ruin, for after I had gotten the start of the pursuers some three or four
miles, I might have turned which way I would, and never have been discovered;
for I did not meet one man in the riding a dozen miles together; at last who
should I overtake but a tall fellow in a Canvasse Frock, with a Whip in his
hand driving of Palfryes, that drew a Cart or Wagon after them; and for fear
this fellow should surprise me (which I dare swear never harbored a thought
of me) I came behind him, and with my French Club, called Battoone, I aimed to
strike him full on the head, and afterward to turn out of the Road, but it
happened by being too eager, I missed his head, and he received the blow on his
shoulder* but he feeling the smart of so sudden and violent a stroke, as
suddenly turns about with his Whip that way the blow came, and by strange
chance twined his Whip-cord some four or five times about my neck, and
snatching hastily his Whip again, to give me the second lash, he drew me off
my Palfry, and in the middle of the highway beat me, till the Knights that
rid in purfuit of me came and attached me for the Lady Pecunia, whom I
offered to them, but they would not receive her, so I and my Lady was bound
hand and foot, and brought to London, the place from whence I first set forth;
there was I laid in a Castle called by name Newgate, where I found many more
wandering Knights; amongst them, who should I meet with but Rob-in Highway, he
that upon the escape fled into the Mill-pond (I ever thought he was not born
to be drowned) after some certain days we were condemned to be racked to
death on a three legged horse, but my Lady Pecunia, because she suffered her
self so easily to be taken away, was in shameful manner plucked limb from limb,
and divided by the Keeper of the Castle, and his Officers.

Thus it appeared by cruel fate,
My adventrous Warrant was out of date;
All you that go on such Adventures,
Let the Devil make you better Indentures.
FINIS.
Imprimatur

Tho. Wykes.
