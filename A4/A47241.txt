THE CLERK OF THE SURVEIGH Surveighed, AND His RIGGING Cast. OR, A brief view
taken of the Book entitled, The Sizes and Lengths of Rigging for all the
States Ships and Frigates, lately put forth by Mr Hayward Clerk of the Surveigh
at Chatham; the irregularities whereof are here in part discovered.

By George Kendall M.A. Clerk of the Surveigh at Debtford and Woolwich.

Printed for the Author in the year 1656.

To his Highness OLIVER LORD PROTECTOR OF The Commonwealth of England,
Scotland and Ireland.
May it please your Highness,
THe Survey business has not without cause been styled the mystery of the
Navy, there being no particular thing wherein the State may more closely and
subtly be abused then in it; An evidence whereof, the ensuing Tract may be,
which discovers in part the irregularity of that Book lately presented to your
Highness as yours de Jure, entitled, The Sizes and Lengths of rigging for all
the States Ships and Frigates. I conceived it my duty to tender it to your
Highness in regard God by his providence has placed you at the helm of
Government, not for the patronizing but redressing the grievances of the Nation.

Vouchsafe, I beseech you, to accept of this from one who as he has formerly
faithfully served the Commonwealth under your Highnesses command in another
capacity, desires to do so also in this wherein he is now set, by discovering
fraud and bringing forth truth to ^ight, it being his chiefest aim that
Righteousness and Justice (which is the surest foundation of peace and
tranquillity) may take place, and be established amongst us: I shall submit to
your Highnesses pleasure to determine, whether this work shall be admitted
public view, or be confined as that Rigging book was, or wholly suppressed,
and shall remain,

Your Highnesses most faithful Servant GEORGE KENDALL.

To the Right Honorable THE COMMISSIONERS Of the Admiralty and Navy.
ALthough I have met with discouragements by false reports that have been made
of me for my endeavors to do the State service, yet I cannot see injury done
to the Commonwealth, but I must make it known; I have therefore adventured to
present to your Honors view some brief observations that I have taken of that
Book entitled; The Sizes and Lengths of Rigging for all the States Ships and
Frigates.

It is reported that the Docking of one of the greater Ships has been formerly
fifty or sixty pounds advantage to the Carpenter of her: I may safely affirm
that if the allowances in that book be made, the Rigging of one of them will be
far greater gain to the Boatswain, though he should have sharers with him in
it. I leave all to your Honors consideration, and remain

at your Honors command George Kendall.

To the Right Worshipful THE COMMISSIONERS Of the Navy.
Right Worshipful,
IT immediately belongs unto you to see abuses of this nature (as this small
Tract presents unto you) redressed: I have therefore rendered it unto you. That
the State should be wronged two or three hundred pound to the Rigging of a
Ship, is a thing that requires to be taken (...) of, especially considering how
many of the great Ships of late years have been, and now are set forth to sea.
Were only some running r^pes (...) ^ng, it might be better excused and born
with, but for the standing Rigging there can be no pretense. I do suppose no
Boatswain would be so simple as to seize up three or four fathoms of a Stay or
a Shroud to make him self ridiculous to every one: what becomes then of such
overlengths, I leave to consideration. That the State might be righted, and
every Ship may have her due allowance and no more, is the only aim and desire
of him who is still ready to be

at your Worships Command GEORGE KENDALL.

He that would Rigge a SHIP or FRIGOT completely, must know as the Length,
Breadth, and Depth of the Ship, so the Dimensions of each Mast and Yard; for
upon them does the Rigging principally depend, both for size and lengths: That
the size of the Stay should be half the Diameter of the Mast, and the Shrouds
half the Stay, is a common rule; yet that is varied from by experienced
Seamen, as they find their Ships more or less labour-some in the Sea; but
the length may be found out exactly by the doctrine of Triangles, especially
of the standing Rigging; for having two sides, and the angle between them, the
third may be found out by an ordinary Artist. Having the length of the Mast
from the Crosse-trees to the Partners for the Perpendicular, and half the
breadth of the Ship for the Base, the Hypothenusall, or Side subtending, is the
length of the Shroud. Again, having the same part of the Mast, and half the
length Keele, or the distance between the Mainmast and Foremast for the two
sides of the triangle, the third being found out will be the length of the
Stay, making an allowance for the Collar at the head of the Mast; but the
Boat-swains have more familiar rules, which comes something near the the truth;
viz. the length of the Keele is the length of the Stay in short Ships, in
greater the Stay may be shorter a fathom, or more. The Naesby's Stay is near
two fathoms shorter then the Keele, the Dunbarres above two fathoms shorter.
The length of the Shrouds must be two thirds of the Mast; the Topmast Shrouds
the length of the Topmast, from the Crosse-trees to the uppermost part of the
Fid-hole; the Topmast Back-staies the length from the Hounds to the Deck: but
these rules and the rest, are known to those that are fit to take Charge of
Ships, as Boat-swains, I shall therefore name no more.

If the Book entitled, The Sizes and Lengths of Rigging for all the States
Ships or Frigots be examined by these or the like rules, it will be found very
exorbitant in Length, and that much to the States prejudice. The Sovereign's
Main-stay will be found four, if not five fathoms too long, and her Shrouds
each pair near three fathoms, which will amount to fourten or fifteen pounds
worth of Cordage, and the like excess will be found in the rest of the
Rigging. But that the damage the State suffers by that Book may more plainly
appear, I shall set down a parallel between that in the second Column of the
Book, allotted by the Author for the Resolution and Naesby, and what the Naesby
was Rigged with at Woolwich at her first setting out; as also between that in
the third Column, which amongst other Ships is appointed for the Swiftsure,
and that with which the same Ship was Rigged with here at the setting forth in
the year 1653, in the conclusion whereof you have the number of fathoms of each
size reduced into weight by the Authors own rules, where ^e view you may see
the difference between them.

of two Ships.

I intended to have added a Parallel between the Providence Rigging in the
sixth columme, and what the same Ship was Rigged with at Deptford: but because
she has not been wholey (...) Rigged here, since I came here into the Service
I shall give you only, a Parallel between a few particular Ropes supplied at
Deptford, with the like in the Book, whereby you may have a view also of the
Exorbitancis of allowances made to the lesser Ships, as well as to the greater.

When I first drew up the Parallel between the Naseby and the Resolution, I
only intended it for the View of those concerned in the regulating of abuses
of that nature, and it had gone no further, but that I was told that the
Resolution was a bigger Shipp, and required more Rigging; broader I am informed
it is by two Foot, but not so long by four Foot; Neither do I believe that her
Masts and Yards are so long and square as the Naseby's are, she having three
Hundred and Ten Yards of Canvas more in her two courses, and one Hundred
fifteen yards in her two top Sails then the Resolution has. And as the Sails
so the Riggings must be proportionable to the Masts and Yards. The Swiftsure is
the same Ship for dimensions, though new built, and her Masts and Yards as
taunt and square as they were at the first. The Providence is not at all
altered.

By these may be judged, what the rest are, and I persuade my self, that he
that shall undertake to Rigge the whole Eight Ships with the quantity allowed
for the four first, may do it completely, and save as much Cordage as will be a
good reward for his pains, and so the State will save, according to the
allowance in the Book, twenty five tuns of cordage, which is worth at the
lowest price it can be bought now for, one Thousand Pounds. A thing
considerable.

After the Rigging of these Ships follows the Masts, where you have how many
Hands the Mast must be of, that will serve for those Ships; this you may know,
and know how many Inches are in a Hand, and yet be far from knowing what
lengths any of those Masts will prove, one of twenty one, or twenty two hands,
making a Mast of two or three Yards longer then another of the same number of
hands, besides the Mast-maker must be advised with, to know what wast in chips
he will make of such Masts when he fits them for the Ships, and except the
length of Mast and yards be known, there can be no Rigging truly proportioned
or cut out for the Ship.

In the 17. page, and so on to the 30th, is set down Rigging for the Frigots,
and there he has some borrowed experience, but had he advised with that Master
of attendance that Rigged most of the Frigots he there mentions, he would have
told him that those Rigging books had been very lame and imperfect, he would
have informed him that there was a far greater difference between the Ruby
and the Assurance, for which he allows to both, the same Rigging, then there
is between the Speaker, and the Ruby, or between the the Assurance and the
Nightingale as may appear by their Masts and quantity of Rigging they were
fitted with.

Speaker. Ruby. Assurance. Nightingale. Main Mast 30 yards 28 yards 25 yards 23
yards. Weight of Rigging 10 tun. 10 C. 8 tun. 10 C. 6 tun. 3 C. 4 tun. 13 C.

He would have told him that the Puttocks he has inserted in the Fore-top Mast
and Main topmast riggings, are altogether superfluous, and not at all used;

Viz. Inch Speaker. Inch Bristol. Inch Nightingale. Inch Martin. Fore-top Mast
Puttocks 2. 24 2. 24 2. 24 2. 6. Main-top Mast Puttocks 2 34 2 32 2. 2^ The
Puttocks in the lower Masts being sufficient.

He would not have allowed the Martin a longer Main-stay, or Main-top-mast-stay
then the Nightingale, nor a Collar for the Fore-stay to the Nightingal and
Martin, above twice the lengths of either the Speaker or Bristol; he would have
given Main-top-mast shrouds to the Martin, as well as Fore-top-mast Shrouds,
and in diverse other particulars, which will be too tedious to mention, he would
have shown him that he had been out of the way.

Next to the Rigging of the Frigots follows the Boatswains, and Carpenters
stores, with the Anchors and Ground-tacle for the several Ships and Frigots,
wherein whether he has truly Copied out the Boatswains or Carpenters Indents,
or no, I know not, in regard I have not had to do with the greater Ships: but
in the Anchors and Cables for the Frigots he is as much besides the truth, as
he was in their Rigging: the Ruby and Diamond, with the rest of the bigger
fourth-rate Frigots, have Anchors of 21 and 22 C. weight, and Cables of 14
Inches, and 15 Inches, whereas the Adventure and Assurance have their best
Anchors but of 13 hundred weight, and their best Cables but of 12 Inches, and
yet in the Book they are all allowed Anchors of the same weight, and Cables of
the same sizes.

There is one thing more in the Stores, which requires the wit not only of an
intelligent Clerk, but of an expert Seaman also to make use of, and that is
the two Top-gallent sails, and the Sprit-sail, and Mizon-top-sails of the
Nicodemus and Henrietta Pinnace, which are not only numbered amongst the
Stores, but afterward measured out, where the quantity of Canvas for each
Ships sails is set down, and yet neither Mast nor Rigging allowed for them, and
may we not judge that this allowance was made hand over head.

From the Stores he comes to the weight of Cordage, and observations about
Rope-makers. If I had an insight into that Trade, I might discover much
weakness in that, something to me seems very irrational: to name but one
particular in the weight: Can any one give a reason, why a Cablet of 3^ Inches
should weigh 63 pounds heavier then a Hauser of the same size and number of
threads, and a Cablet of 4 Inch should weigh of a hundred and twenty one l.
lesser then a Hauser of the same size: But to wave his weights, Is there any
proportion observed in the making of Cordage, where a hauser of 1^ Inch has 12
threads more then one of inch, and one of 2 inch has but 3 threads more then one
of 1 inch and one of 2^ Inch but 3 threads more, then one of 2 Inch; or that one
hauser of 5^ Inch should have but 12 threads more then one of 5 Inch, and one of
6 Inches have 54 threads more then one of 5 Inch, or that one of 8 Inch should
have but 24 threads more then one of 7 and one of 8 should have 72 threads more
then one of 8 Inches; or is it possible that a Cable of 20 Inches shoul contein
as many threads as one of 19 Inches; and one of 13 Inches, if there be any
certainty in a rule of proportion, that number of threads will make one of 23 or
24 Inches; certainly that Rope-maker that gave him these observations, played
the Wagg with him, to make him to be laughed at.

Whether the Boat-maker has dealt faithfully with him in the dime^ons of the
Ships, Boats, or no, I know not, but I am certain they bear not a like
proportion one to the other, the Purveyor can best tell, (if he looks over the
stores) whether they be duly prized.

As for the quantity of canvas in each Ships Sails, except it be known what
depth, and what number of clothes be in every Sail: it cannot be discovered
whether the Sail maker has put in all that cloth into them or no.

And as for his weight of each Ships rigging, and Ground-tackle, I may safely
affirm, he has not gone by the rule he himself lays down for the weight of
Coardage, I shall instance only in their Ground-tackle, and other coardage,
for stores.

To conclude, by all it does appear, that whereas the author boasts, that much
of this book has been his own pains, and part borrowed experience, the whole
is but a confused collection of things taken upon trust from others without
examination of the truth, or reason of them; there being little of either to be
found, and whereas he affirms, that one maine inducement in committing it to
the press, was to give the Right Honorable, the Commissioners of the
admiralty satisfaction, -- That the Ships are fitted regularly with riggings
and stores, in reference to Boat-swaines, and Carpenters, and not hand over
head, and without caution. It is evident, that if his rules be observed, there
will appear very little, either regularity, or caution. And thus have you The
intelligent Clerk Surveyed, and now what does his work call for, but that
Justice should be done upon it, as is usual upon such books, as are either
scandalous to, or abusive of the State, (a greater and more subtle fraud being
rare to be found) and I doubt not but that they, who are entrusted in
management of the affairs of the Navy, will so far take it into consideration,
as to do the Common Wealth right in the business.

Postscript.
To prevent a question that may be made, viz. Whether the Naseby Swiftsure and
providence were sufficiently rigged, take notice that the two last were rigged
by Mr. Thomas Scot now Master of attendance at Deptford, a man of known
intregrity, and ability for the performance of that work. The Naseby was rigged
at Woolwich, when there was no Master of attendance there, yet the testimony
annexed was given of it by Mr. Arkenstall, one of the Masters of attendance at
Chattem, when she was rigged and ready to set sail from Woolwich.

These are to certify, that the Naseby Frigot is sufficiently rigged: and that
the sizes and lengths of each particular rope in sight, is large enough for
service, as far as I am able to judge. Dated at Woolwich this 26th day of
April, 1655.

Thomas Arkenstall.

FINIS.
The Author to his Book.
FRowns, Scorns, Taunts, Threats, my Book thou must expect,
From them, whose falsehood thou do here detect.
All the sworn brothers will at once conspire
Against thee and me, and thus will vent their ire,
What? shall a Clerk that is but of yesterday,
That sarcely knows the use of Shroud or Stay,
Question the lengths of Ropes we give? shall we
That have been bred up in the Navy, be
Subject to give account for what we do,
Or what allowances we make? if so,
It will be sad to us, we will therefore see
What friends we have, and they engaged shall be
To plead for us. Of them affirm one shall
That these are but mere niceties: if all
Other Ships rigging books were but perused,
It may be said in them the State's abused:
Scarce two Ships rigging you will find to agree,
Though of the same dimensions they be.
If this prevail not, then another friend,
Shall plead it is not a season to attend
The regulating this; things of more weight,
Require the present time: by this means straight
It shall be laid by to another day,
Then we are safe, we shall have time to play
Our game the better: there is hopes we shall find
Some way to put this thing quite out of mind.
We Will plead the Author is a busy man,
To whom if ears be open, no end can
Be made of quarrels: he will yet complain,
Of this, and that, and the other thing again.
We Will privately report (though it be untrue)
His life is loose, such slanders are not new.
Some dirt will stick, if dirt enough we cast,
Thus we his credit weaken shall at last.
But thou poor Book, wilt scarcely find a friend
That dares plead for thee, lest he should offend.
Yet be not daunted, time will shortly be
When truth, not friends, We shall prevailing see.
FINIS.
