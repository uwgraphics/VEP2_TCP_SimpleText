to the Chapter of Liege, and Communicated by the Cardinal BOVILLON.
Translated from the Dutch.

Licensed April the 4th. 1694.

His Majesty,
Being desirous to facilitate, and secure to the Chapter of Liege, as much as
in him lies, the free and regular Election of a Bishop and Prince, has
declared, and does hereby declare, That in case the Confederate Princes will
cause their Troops to retire out of this City and Citadel; as also out of the
Forts and Lines thereof, to the end, That the Chapter may be left free and
unmolested in all Matters appertaining to the said Election; his majesty binds
himself, and promises upon the Word of a King, That he will observe a full and
exact Newtrality with the City and Country of Liege, not only to the Twentieth
of April, the day of the Election, but also to the last of April inclusively,
and consequently that no Act of Hostility shall be committed directly, or
indirectly upon any pretense whatsoever, in any part of the Disticts of Liege,
till the first of may, and his majesty does likewise declare, That he will give
Past-ports and Letters of Safeguard during that time; and that afterward, all
things shall be on the same Foot as now, and that the Confederate Troops shall
again take possession of the sosts they now Garrison, without any Let or
molestation from His Majesty.
