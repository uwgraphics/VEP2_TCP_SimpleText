THE QVEENES
Speech as it was delivered to the House of Commons by Sir Thomas Jermyn
Comptroller, July 21, 1641.
WHen the Parliament did the other day express their affections to me, in
taking into consideration the journey which I had resolved on for the recover^
of my health, and represented a desire of my stay with a tender care of
removing all occasions of my indisposition, I could not then give a positive
answer, such as I desired for their satisfaction, because I knew not that my
health would give way unto it: but since that time I have resolved to venture my
health, and for complying with their desires not to go, since my presence here
will be acceptable unto them, and that they conceive it will be for the good of
the Kingdom, for I desire ^^thing more, then to let you see that I shall in
all things be ready to gratify them, and to serve the State, though, as I then
said, with the hazard of my life.
