The Father's wholesome Admonition: OR, A Lumping Pennyworth of Good Counsel for
Bad Husbands.
To the Tune of Grim King of the Ghosts.
Licensed according to Order.





My Son if you reckon to Wed,
and take your self to a kind Wife,
Then then, let it never be said,
but that you will reform your old Life:
There Is many good pounds you have spent,
the which you had reason to prize,
But labor in time to repent,
it is good to be merry and wise.
Be sure keep a penny in store.
'twill help you when Friends they may fail;
For should you spend all, and grow poor,
your Case you will have cause to bewail:
In Troubles you will strangely be hurled,
the which will your Senses surprise:
But he that will thrive in this World
must learn to be merry and wise.
Perchance you may meet with a Friend,
which does to your Dealings belong,
If with him a Tester you spend,
this can do you no great wrong,
And then to your Labor again,
it being enough to suffice;
This care will your Household maintain,
it is good to be merry and wise.


There Is many a Woman well bred,
has Married a prodigal knave,
So that the same day she was Wed
'twere better she had gone to her Grave,
her Lands and her Livings all sold,
which caused Tears to flow from her Eyes,
And likewise true friendship grew cold,
then it is good to be merry and wise
Son, if a Rich Wife be thy Lot,
be careful and thrifty I pray,
For Means is not so easily got,
as it may be squandered away:
Be careful and always contrive
those temporal Blessings to prize;
For he that is willing to thrive.
must learn to be merry and wise.
There Is some that are absolute poor,
as well I can make it appear,
Who will in strong Liquor spend more
than some that has hundreds a year,
And bring their poor Families low,
and cannot get wherewith to suffice;
But that Man would never do so,
who learns to be merry and wise.
The Workman that is a boon Lad,
you will find his Condition is thus,
If Trading should chance to grow bad,
he scarce has a Groat in his Purse,
While he that both get, spend, and save,
has always enough to suffice:
Then Son if this Blessing you would have,
then learn to be merry and wise.
Thus Counsel which to you I give,

And then you in (...)
