The Hasty Damosel. OR, Her worthy Praise of her Beloved William, a Seaman.
The Maid would fain a Husband gain,
to give her true content;
Her Mother she most willingly
at length did give consent.
T^^e of, The Seamans departure, or, Doubting Virgin.

MOther, pray when shall I marry,
and receive a woman's due?
Do you think that I will tarry
while I am as old as you?
Men and Maidens then will flout me,
but I now have sweethearts store,
Harry, Will and Tom's about me;
nay, besides a dozen more.
This did cause her Mothers laughter,
then immediately she said,
Sure you an't so hasty Daughter,
who lives better than a Maid?
This discourse, said she, don't please me,
there is Robin, Ralph and Will,
Kiss and court, and daily tease me,
thus they do torment me still.
Three or four each day comes to me,
then they seldom do agree;
They so eager are to woo me,
that I fear they will fight for me:
But if things were rightly carried,
I should lead a happy life;
That is, if I once were married
this would straitway end the strife.


LIkewise for another Reason
I indeed would fain be wed;
In the cold in winter season
I shall lie full warm in bed.
Then bespoke her loving mother,
which of these pray will you have?
Will, said she, above all other,
he is a man both neat and brave.
Never was a finer Saylor;
every one will speak his praise;
True, I might have had a Tailor,
but I did not like his ways;
He showed me a deal of Cabbage
which he pinched the week before;
But I slav'd him, and out-brav'd him,
so that he came there no more.
After him, a Miller, Mother,
came and did in love proceed,
But as I had served the the other,
so I served him indeed:
Neither Miller, no nor Tailor,
ever shall my love obtain;
But a noble-hearted Saylor,
who has plough'd the Ocean main.
He has sailed to foreign Nations,
in the Straits, to France and Spain;
I of him give this Relation,
when as he returned again,
Gold and Silver he had plenty,
with Apparel neat and trim,
Might I have the choice of twenty,
i would forsake them all for him.
He is of a comely carriage,
like him there is hardly one;
If I ever join in marriage,
it shall be with him alone:
I will never be unruly,
but in true Obedience stand;
Pray now mother tell me truly,
is he not a pretty man?
Yes, I like him, therefore Daughter,
may you both full happy be;
Marry now, or else hereafter,
it shall be all one to me.
She no sooner had consented,
that she should be made a Bride,
But the Tears of joy was vented,
with a thousand thanks beside.
