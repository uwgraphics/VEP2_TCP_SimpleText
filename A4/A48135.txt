A Letter from a Country Gentleman to a Friend, a Member of the House of
Commons.
SIR,
I Have received your passionate Letter, and must confess my self extremely
moved by it, but not altogether your way; there is not an expression in the
first part, to which my heart consents not: it is indeed a sad and miserable
condition we are fallen into, to be weltring one in another blood, before we
know why we are angry; and to see our Houses and Towns fired, and our
Neighbors and Friends taken Prisoners, by men who do not only speak the same
language with us, but are of our own Families, and of the same (or seem to be
of the same) Religion; so that (as you say) you may well wonder, how men who
take such different ways, can pretend they desire the same ends. I have thus
far kept you company very willingly, with the same grief and amazement, but
when you seem to lay this fault wholly upon the King and his followers (whom
you accuse of great rapine, cruelty, and inhumanity;) you must give me leave to
dissent from you upon such reasons as (if I have not forfeited the esteem I
have had with you will make some impression in you.

You know how far I have always concurred with you, and swayed by the
singular regard I have had of your wisdom and integrity, given up much of my
understanding to your Authority, and upon that score you know have done
somewhat my own judgment would not now warrant, very much to the service of
the Parliament, from whom I received public thanks; and therefore I had
reason to expect more protection, at least less damage from any forces
maintained and employed by them, then from the Kings Army, with whom I could
not but know my self to be in a just prejudice; and when you know now that I
have been visited by the Soldiers of both Armies, you will believe me a
competent Reporter of their behaviors.

It was my turn first to receive your Troopers, 300 of them being quartered at
this Town, no fewer then 30 disposed themselves to my house; I received them as
friends, and you know am not usually very ill provided for the entertainment of
as good a company: many of them were Commanders, and undertook to tell me, my
affection was very eminent to the Persons who employed them, so that I confess
I looked for no other pressures from them, then the charge of that nights
receiving them.

And it is true they left me the next morning, but so unhandsomely, that besides
the insolency of finding fault, and commanding all my servants, (having used my
self and my children with great pride and incivility) they spoiled more of my
goods of all sorts, then they had spent, (though they must confess they wanted
nothing but the honesty to deserve it) and pilfered and stole many things of
value, telling me to my face, that it was necessary to make that waste, that
the Cavaliers might be disappointed: And indeed the night following the
Cavaliers came, double the number to my house, that had been there before,
commanded only by the Coronet of the Troop, (whereas of the other there were
not fewer then ten Officers, whereof four were Captains) you will imagine the
trim usage I had from those, who told me they came to defend me, had not left
me courage to stand the shock of another entertainment of those, who could not
but hear somewhat of me, which might expose me to their fury, at least would
justify any excess toward me; I gave direction they should be as well
treated as my store would bear, though in truth the vile license of the
forerunners had not left me ordinary provision for horse or man, and withdrew
my self to that honest Parsons house, who disputed with you when you were last
here; and was by him privately sheltred (though many Soldiers were then with
him too) from discovery.

The Company removed the next morning, and they were not gone two hours from
my house before I returned thither, where I assure you I found all things as
orderly, as unspoyled, as if my best friends had been my guests, and one of my
servants told me, that he had rather meet with 100. Cavaliers, then 10
Roundheads: it is true, they had as good provision for themselves and their
horses as could be made, which they received with so much Civility to all my
servants, as if they thought themselves beholding to them for it (though it was
much worse then had been given the day before) and departed without the least
disorder.

For the business of Marleborough, which you say was carried with so much
fierceness and barbarity in firing and plundring the Town, I beleleeve you
have not that relation so perfectly, and ingenuously made to you, as in truth
the matter will bear; you must think my information is not partial on the
Kings part, when I receive it from one who fled to a friends house of mine for
shelter, and lost at least the value of 300 l. by the Kings Soldiers in that
Town.

You know well how that Town has behaved it self all this year, in raising
great sums of money against the King (for that the Army which has given him
Battle, is not against him, can no longer be understood) in gathering and
exercising Soldiers, as if they defied any Enemy, how they seized upon His
Majesty's provisions, bought and paid for by His Commissary of the victuals for
the supply of Redding, and would not suffer them to be carried thither. The
King could not but think of reducing this place, and to that purpose sent the
Lieutenant General of His Horse (a Gentleman, whatever vote you please to pass
upon him, of great reputation in the Countries through which he passes, for his
sober government of his charge) with Instructions, most suitable to his nature,
That if his reception into that Town, was such as became them to give, he
should suffer no violence to be exercised by the Soldiers, but should bring
away the Arms which had been so ill used, and some seditious Persons who had
infected that place, and put His Majesty to that trouble, with some other
directions that sufficiently expressed a care of that people, and a
willingness to believe them in the number of His Subjects.

When this piece of the Army (the reputation of which might well have dispersed
that rabble) by slow marches, had brought it self within a little distance of
the Town, a fellow sent by the foolish Knave Franklin, who they say has
brought all this calamity upon a place he has been long in spoiling, came to
them with a ridiculous Letter of advise, to a person of Honor amongst them.

The Messenger who might have expected worse usage, was brought before the
Lieutenant General, who caused all the men to be ranged before him, then asked
him, whether he thought the strength of that Town could resist that force, the
fellow answered, it could not resist a quarter of that power: Get your ways
then (said that Gentleman) to your friends, and tell them what you have scene,
if they throw down their Arms, and submit themselves to His Majesty, they
shall be used like friends, and receive no prejudice by the Soldiers, but if
they make resistance, and force us to enter the Town in blood, it will not be
in my power to preserve them. The man returned, did his errand in the presence
of him who gives me this account, and who immediately fled, when he found the
perverseness of that Franklin would neither submit to the advice, or suffer it
to be communicated to the rest of the Town: When the Army advanced, all
possible ressistance was made, and many Soldiers of the Kings dangerously
wounded, out at windows, and from their works, insomuch as they were compelled
to burn some houses, in which Musketeers were placed to give fire upon them.

Think sadly with your selves, how your Army (which committed such outrages
and plundrings in the poor City of Winchester, where the Gates were opened to
them, and no show of resistance made by the people of that place) would have
requited such opposition, nay was it ever known, that after such a contention
less then a slaughter of the Enemy, and a sacking of the Town followed? yet as
there as nothing of the first here, so there was so little of the other (and
yet more I believe then the Commanders could have wished) that they have only
cause to curse those who drew such visitants to them.

But no more of these particulars, let us rather raise a compassion one toward
another out of the consideration of these miseries, and to what height they
will in a short time be improved, then contract a bitterness, and hatred
against those with whom we must live happily, if there be any hope of
happiness left for this poor Kingdom.

You will think this a strange dialect for me to use, whom you have known to
concur with the fiercest men in the fiercest resolutions; but if you were out
of the House of Commons, where all Arguments tending one way, beget a general
consent in opinion, and so whatever is thought easy is concluded lawful, and
spent one Month with me in the Country (though you know it is a place was
never fondly devoted to the Kings command) you would observe a strange
dejection in the spirits of the people, and if I am not cozened, an
inquisitivenesse, by questions they did not use to ask, Who raised Arms first?
Why they did it? What the Commonwealth wanted? Whether the King has denied
any thing was not in his lawful power to deny? Whether the preferring half a
score persons (for they say, all these calamities have grown from no more, and
some will undertake to name them) be of that value, that so many widows must be
made, so many children fatherless, and such a desolation brought upon the
whole Kingdom for them? with the like questions, which in a little time may
raise such a storm, as the cunning and power of both houses cannot allay.

It Is true, they do yet yield some obedience to the terrible warrants which
summon them to appear with their Arms in your commands, but with such
grumbling, and unwillingnesse, such a peremptorinesse not to fight, that I
should think my self very unsafe with a guard of 5000. of them.

Let me tell you, since the business at Edge hill, the inclinations even of
the hottest men in our Country are strangely startled and perplexed, not with
the sense of being beaten (whether that were so, or to such a degree, is not
material) but with the apprehension of the known extreme visible danger the
person of the King (whom we had all so often sworn to defend, and for the
preservation of whose person the Country people believed even this Army to be
raised) was that day in; believe it you will never be able more to persuade
them, that so many Canon and Musket shot were made at him for the safety of his
Person.

And these Considerations do not only make impression in us here, but have had
a great influence with men whose Affection, and courage you do not suspect. I
assure you one of your chief Leaders (you will easily guess the man by what
he has since done, told me, and he told it me in the hearing of four or five
of your most active friends) that in a week after that battle he slept not an
hour with the horror of the thought, what it was to kill the King, and had
that agony of soul about him, that he would not endure again so long for the
greatest preferment in the Kingdom.

One of the slanders by (who used that industry to gather up the Arms about the
Field, and sent them to you to Warwick) sharply answered him, If he had gone
to bed in his right mind, he would have dreamed that he was rescuing the King
out of the hands of Thieves, and would have feared no accidents: he replied
soberly, that such Arguments do arise from the warmth and faction of debate,
never are supplied out of the innocence of sleep. I beseech you (said the
other scornfully) what medicine have you since applied to your self, for the
recovery of your rest: Repentance, says he, and resolution to be mad no
more. It had been well, said the other, you had slept first, for now me thinks
this resolution seems but an effect of your madness. I am content (he replied
with an angry smile) you should think so, but when you come home, recollect
all that I have said to you this day, and if I am not deceived, you will change
your mind too. He has been as good as his word, you never saw such an
alteration in a man, such a sadness and damp of spirit, and he protested to my
yesterday, if a peace were not concluded speedily, we should have our
Christianity suspected, and be beaten out of all places with stones by the
people.

Sir, trust me, it concerns you, it concerns us all, that you find some way to
quiet and compose these distractions. It is not the name of a Parliament, of
evil Counselors, Malignant Cavaliers, and other hard words will keep the
people longer asleep to their own ruin: you may remember the Councell-Table,
yea, and the Star Chamber too, names of reverence, but when they left their
Justice, they lost their reputation; neither was Ship Money grievous, because
it was a supply to the King, (Let us not deceive our selves, Englishmen
naturally love their King, and what starts soever they may make, will retire
into their loyalty, to the ruin of their seducers;) but because it did, or
might take more from them then they were willing or able to spare, and what
power soever does, or endeavors to do the same things, will have the same fate
in the affections of the people.

Do you think the condition of the poor Countreyman has not suffered a sad
alteration, from a State (in which you found him) wherein he knew what was his
own, and was not capable of any violence, for which he was not sure of a remedy
and reparation, to this wherein he receives commands under the penalty of
plundring and hanging, from persons of whom he never heard, for Horses, for
Money, for personal attendance, of which, as he can find no ground, so he can
hope for no end; and sees the twentieth part of his estate taken from him, to
continue and maintain a calamity, which makes all the rest of no use to him? I
say again, no cunning, wit, and industry will longer bewitch the people to this
folly and tamenesse.

A blunt neighbor of mine told me yesterday, that the Parliament had ill luck,
is discountenanced all men, whose Wisdom, Justice, and Charity, the Country
could confide in, and confided in none so much as in those who are only known
by the ill they have heretofore done; and asked me whether my Lord Re^ohford,
Feilding, and Hastings were not like to be precious Instruments of a
Reformation: I answered, Great Counsels were not to be undervalued by the
meannesse or unworthiness of some of their members. He replied, 'Twas true,
when the Counsels justified themselves; but 'twas time to look upon the
particular persons, when nothing was said in defense of the Actions, but the
power and reputation of the Actors.

These skirmishes I meet with, even with those, who when you and I parted, were
in the Catalogue of your followers, if there be the same alteration in other
places, on my word it will not be long in your power to make so good an end of
these troubles, as now it is. For Gods sake call up all that is of prudence and
generosity about you, and if there be any thing I have said moves you, impart
it to our friends in Red crossestreet, and join all your endeavors for a happy
Accommodation.

FINIS.
