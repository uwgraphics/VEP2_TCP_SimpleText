To his ever Honored friend Mr P. I. on his Amorea.
SHould I commend thy Poems, that would be
A needless complement, for all do see:
That do but read thy works, thou have out-gone,
More then I`me able speak, or think upon?
Yet this I dare afirme what thou have writ
Thou have not borrowed from another wit:
Thy muse does scorn that any one should say
I`ve read those verses once before to day,
No thus I`le pubblish (with a be it known
To all the world) the Poems are thy own
Thy Amorea has no other plumes
To set her out, no Baint, nor yet perfumes,
No braded hair, no Peacook-couller gown?
She`s in a moddest dress, and it is her own
In which i`le leave her to the pubblick view
Of the Ingenious Readers: friend Adue.
Jo. Frankelin
To my dear friend Mr. P. J. on his Amorea.
THou do not writ of Armies, or of Fights,
Of Monsters, Giants, nor of armed Knights,
Nor how great Ladies did in Castles lie,
By strange adventures, gaining liberty,
No dreadful Battles thou discrib'st for fear,
It should be harsh to any Ladies ear,
Nor do thou sing of Travells, that may bring
Truth in suspicion: thou do not sing
Of strange prodigious Monsters, whose birth,
Without production sprung from the earth,
No, those poor Rabbles thou do scorn too touch,
Thy fancy flies to a higher pitch.
Thy passion being fired from above,
Thou sing'st that noble, noble passion Love.
A. Mathews.
To his Ingenious Friend Mr. P. I. on his Poems of the King's Return.
VVElcome sweet soul into the Company
Of noble Poets, (welcome again say I)
Where have thou been? tell us, how conld thy worth
Lie hid so long, why did it not break forth?
Where were thou when as half the world did sing
The glorious welcomes of our Sacred King,
Did Amorea so much hold thy mind
In due observance? that thou could nor find
One hour to express thy joys with us:
No 'twas not so, the reason sure was thus.
Thou went's into Arabia, to bring
A Quill from off the Widow-Phenix's wing,
With which thou'st written, that thy Loyalty
Is so apparent, as the world may see,
If they but read thy Poems, thou'st out gone,
Not only half, but most, that writ upon
Our Kings Return; thy enemies do think
Thou writ'st in gold, and not with vulgar Ink.
Io. Dancie.
To his esteemed friend Mr. P. J. On his Poems.
Aid me Ben Jonsons Ghost, come Cleavelands Spirit
Might I old Quarles his smoothness but inherit,
Or were I metamorphis'd for a while
Into some Lofty Poet, my poor style:
Must needs come very short of thine, yet I,
Will pay my tribute to thy Poetry,
Which if you do except, although a mite,
I`me sure it is full of love? though it want weight
T. M.
To his Dear Brother, on his Amorea.
Is It true, I have a Poet-Brother, who
Has seen Mount Hellicon at twenty two,
Been bred up with the Muses, and has quaft
Of the Pierian Fount a liberal draught,
In Agganippe Well has dipped his Quill,
And fetched his paper from Parnassus hill;
It Is true, I have; and had he been another,
(But 'Ile forbear because he is my Brother)
I Would speak his praiss, for thus much I do know,
His Works will show it, more then I can do.
Io. Ienkin.
To my dear friend on his Amorea
HOw many hours, nay days, I may say years
How many sighs, and vows, how many tears
Have thou paid to the memory of one
That (like the Phoenix) vows to live alone.
Could I perswad thee, but i`me come to late
I will not make thee more unfortunate,
Suppose (Resuming of a second life)
That Amorea were to be thy wife
That's all could make thee blessed, yet she must die
And now she lives to perpetuity
R. M.
To his Dear and ever honored friend Mr P. I. on his Poems.
I Shall not flatter I Am no Parasito,
I Will not deminish, nor yet add a mite
Unto thy praise; for what need Gold to be
New gilded over that is vain curiosity,
If wit be judge then thou art sure of praise,
And Dunces must not read such lines as these,
For if they should, they will find an Epigram
Will tell them to their face, thou art the man:
I could speak much in praise, but to what end
When all that Read thee do it, no dear friend,
I Will wish thee happiness, but this i`le prove,
Thy book will make the Dullest Soul to love.
G. M.
To his dear and ever Honored friend Mr. P. J. On his Poems.
SHould I write any thing in praise of thee
That were a nedless thing, i will rather be
One of the number: that do thee admire
And then I have all that I do desire:
For two be bound up with your book I know
(Though you admit) my verse will useless show.
J. C.
To my dear friend on his Amorea.
What in the wars and yet a Poet, then
Tell me the difference 'twixt the sword, and pen
Can thou with one hand grasp the tempred steel,
And in the other hold thy loved quill,
Be angry in a moment and yet prove
Thy anger only does proceed from love:
This day be bravely mounted in the street,
To morrow prostrate at thy Ladies feet?
Write Sonnets in the morning; and ere night
Be deep engaged in some cruel fight,
Just now a going to a Nuptial
And presently cal`d to the Funeral
Of some new Slaughtered friend, how can this be
Why thus, the question`s plain enough, for we.
(That read thy Poems needs) must do thee right
For thou can fight, and love, and love, and fight.
R. H.
To his ever friend Mr P. I. On his Poems.
I Am as full of love as those that do
Write better Verses in the praise of yon
(And if it may not be disparagment
To those have writ thy praise) it is my intent:
To write a line or two, that all may know it
Reading thy Poems, I am half a Poet
W. A.
To Mr P. I. on his Amorea.
HOw should I do my mind for to rehearse
I can write love enough but not in verse
Yet my dear friend do not refuse this mite
For I declare unto the world I write:
Not to win praise, for then I`me sure I shall
Have very little, for you have gotten all,
I am contented, it does joy my heart
When as I go abroad, in every part;
For to hear this, and the other Lady say
Have you not Amorea read to day.
One takes occation for to praise this thing?
Another will take up her Lute and Sing.
One of thy Sonets; this will drop a tear,
For thy mifortune; some I`ve heard to swear
Thy Pastroll Poems best, some think it Duty
To praise that Poem thou have writ on Beauty
Should I give my opini^n? truly I
Compare thy book unto a Lottery
Her`es Gold enough presented to our Eyes;
Draw where we will, we cannot miss a prize.
W. C.
TO AMOREA; The DEDICATION.
TO the fairest and divine,
Next unto the Sacred Nine,
To the Queen of love and beauty,
I do offer up my duty;
To the sweetest disposition,
That e're Lover did petition,
To the best and happ'est fortune,
Ever man did yet importune,
To the Lady of all hearts,
That pretend to noble parts;
To the altar of her eyes,
I my self do sacrifice;
To her ever winning glances,
Here I do present my fancies;
And to her all commanding look,
I do dedicate my book.
To the Muses.
MUses I do invoke you to inspire,
And grant to me your great and holy aid,
That in my fancies so it may be said,
I favor win, favored by your Atire.
Yet how, or what I shall insist upon,
Or on what subject I should first begin,
Against the Muses, sure it is a sin
For me to speak, or think of Hellicon.
My barren Muse unfit to entertain,
Or to assume the name of Poetry,
Although I have presumed a liberty
My tired mind from Prose a while to wean.
But if the Muses grant their influence,
And will my naked fancy but protect,
All I shall do is wholly to project
A way to make them a large recompense;
And all the praise that comes (if any be)
Is due unto them for inspiring me.
Liberty lost.
AS yet I had not known the rage, and force
Of Love, and Passion, when I took my course
Unto the Grove where I was used to go,
And pass the time, (wish it had never been so.)
And being come unto the place where I
Was wont sometimes to walk, sometimes to lie
Upon the flowery banks of Violet,
And Primrose, interwoven, as if set
To counterfeit the Elysium Tapistry;
(Who could have thought danger should be so nigh
So sweet a place) when forthwith I began
To read a while, the story was of Pan,
The God of Rural Sports; where Shepherds fell
In love with Shapherdesses, and to tell
How some one for his love renounced a Crown,
And spent his time with Sheep upon a Down;
At which I smiled, that man should be so vain,
As from a Prince to turn a Shepherd Swain,
But note what sudden chance befell, and see,
I laughed it is true, ('it was a sad laugh to me,)
For having scanned the vanity of love,
I heard a fluttering noise come from above,
When presently there lighted on a tree
A winged-boy, (the fight was strange to me)
And wondering at the sight, he forthwith took
From underneath his wings a Table Book,
And threw it at my feet, saying young man
Look well on this and read no more of Pan,
And saying so he took in hand his bow,
And shot at me. (I since have felt the blow)
At which he vanished from my sight, when I
(One^y in love with curiosity)
Unclasp'd the Book, I took it to be so,
But 'twas a Picture-case, the which did show
A face which I had never seen till then,
Which made me to admire it is grace, but when
I Would viewed it over, and over, I took the case
And threw it from me, but the new-seen face
Had made so deep impression, that I said,
Crying aloud, I am betrayed, betrayed,
And rising from the place, I went away,
Toward my habitation; but stay,
And see my sudden change, I that before
Could boast of freedom, presently I tore
My Book in pieces, and began to cry
Love, Tharldome, Madam, Passion, Liberty;
And like a man distracted I began
To curse the Winged-boy, and call on Pan,
But as I called, I heard a silent noise
Within the Wood, and after that a voice
Which came unto my ear, I heard it say,
What have I seen, what have I heard to day?
And looking round about me I espied
(A sight I have repented) by the side
Of a small running Brook a Nymph to lie
Discoursing to her self of destiny,
I heard her say, wish I had never been
Abroad to day, or wish I Would never seen
The Grove, nor Picture, but since it is so
I will forget it all, and so i will go;
And as she spoke that word I saw her face,
The very same the newfound Picture case
Presented me, when I cried out it is she,
She fled and only said it is he, it is he.
A Poem Lyrick:
AMorea why so Fair,
Fairer then the clearest air,
Brade no more that Auborn hair,
If in love you do not share,
Beauty does beget dispare:
Amorea Why so wise,
Far above a mortals prise,
Drown no more our gloomy eyes,
But accept the Sacrifice,
Of a lovers dying cries:
Amorea why so High:
Why so full of Majesty,
Ah shut up that killing eye
Which by looking can deny,
Only mind the marriage tie:
Amorea why so Blessed,
How so happy in thy rest,
Still denying to invest
In thy chaste, but marble breast,
Any lovers interest:
Amorea cannot be,
Fair but in her puretie;
Nor wise but in her Sanctity,
Nor high to any but to me,
Nor Blessed but in Eternity:
Peace prattling Muse. A Song.
PEace prattling Muse do, not declare
Her great perfection;
Now she does not lend an ear
To thy affection,
No alas her thoughts are seated
Too, too high to be repeated:
Come wandering fancy come away
Thou art neglected,
Honor bids thee not to stay
If disrespected,
Never do her parts admire
That thy ruin does desire:
End hopeless love, for ever end;
She does not hearken,
Her resolutions all do bend
Thy hopes to darken,
Let her never more delight thee.
If but once She seems to slight thee.
Away, you vain and fond delights
away, be gone,
I nere intend on Hymen's Rites
To think upon,
Pardon me I cannot vow it,
For my dear will not allow it:
Love at a Stand.
1.
SHould we but ourselves confine
To one settled habitation,
Though the place were all divine
We should long to change our station.
2.
So it was when first I loved.
I resolved not to sever,
But alas it has so proved.
It was force and, and not Endeavor.
3.
Should I say that I adore you
You will hardly give me credit,
You will say if I implore you
In his own words I have read it.
4.
That he is unstable, hearken
Love has bred a deep confusion,
Your denyals often darken
But not change my resolution
To Amorea on his going to Sea.
1.
SEnd not a sigh to follow me behind;
That were unkind.
My tottered Bark cannot eudure that wind,
The force of such a gale
Will overset my sail.
2.
Drop not a bootless tear into the Sea,
That Is not the way,
Rather be still, and unto Neptune pray,
For if you do but weep,
Your tears provoke the deep.
3.
Yet when I see (too late) the threatening storms.
Portending harms,
I then shall wish my self within thine arms,
Not only there to lie,
But only there to die.
His Inducement to Love.
1.
Do not think it is your beauty
That has so engaged me,
Rather know it is my duty,
Or the bonds that Love, and you tie,
Which are only found in thee.
2.
Let not Amorea wonder
At my too presumptuous aim,
Be but pleased to look yonder
On that Coupple, and but ponder,
You will fi^d as high extreme.
3.
Entertain no thought my dearest,
That your fortune did beget
A liking, though you are the fairest,
And do far transcend the rarest
Nature has composed yet.
4.
No, it is your education,
And your virtues that do shine:
But it is disconsolation
To endure a separation
From a virtue so divine.
To Amorea from Prison.
1.
COme away and bless the Grate,
With thy all commanding eye,
Come away,
Do not stay,
We have conquered our fate
By a suffering Loyalty.
We know how to captivate,
Chain, and bind captivity.
2.
Come my dearest come and see
What it is to have a mind
Nobly born,
That can scorn,
And disdain a Tyranny,
Though the Fates do prove unkind
And deny us liberty,
Freedom in our chains we find.
3.
Come away unto the place,
Where the Royal slaves do dwell,
Stay a while,
Send a smile
From that ever blessed face,
See, and hear, then go and tell,
That our Shackles are a grace,
And an honor so farewell.
The Authors danger, and deliverance.
Having left Englands once admired Land,
And reached the Ocean ( Neptunes great command)
The wind our friend, the sometime boistrious Sea.
Lay smooth and calm, such another day
Had scarce been seen a day as if it were
Composed only of a silent air.
The foul take pleasure on there flaging wing
The Trytons sound, the subtle Sirens sing,
The greater fish do leap the lesser Skip.
The Princely Dolphyns play about our ship.
And thus be calmed one takes in hand his Lute
To play a lesson, this man with a Flute
Gives a Leavet, another sings a song,
Of Cloris, and a fourth shows the wrong
Of Philamela and her chance. But when
It came unto my turn. I took a Pen
With resolution for to dedicate
A Poem of our calm, and quiet state
Unto great Neptune but my Pen and hand,
Were stoped by the voice, and known command
Of our old Pylot, who a far of spies
A Gloomy Cloud, which did begin to rise
With pitchie color, and anon does cover,
The surface of the heavens black all over:
And now the wind which was before our friend
No sooner rose, but forthwith did contend,
Against the happiness which heretofore
We did enjoy, the Sea began to roar,
The clouds desolved into rain and we
Could nothing but our present danger see,
The storm rages and the waves are cast
With lofty force far higher then the Mast,
The night came on, in which on shore in peace
We use to rest, the tempest does increase,
The moon does hide her head as loath to be
A witness of our dismal tragiedy.
The master will not trust unto the helm
None but himself, for fear they overwhelm
The tottered bark; gives his commands at large
That every man stand fast unto his charge,
The horror, and the darkness of the night,
Concuring with the danger does affright
Our tired men; again he does command,
Down with the sails, be nimble now and stand
Unto your labor try the pump, and see
You lore the top mast, quickly let it be;
Now do we wish for day, which now we have,
Only in use to light us to our grave,
For with the day the storm does Angement
Which made us see our dangers eminent.
The helm is now no longer governed,
But by the Sea, the Pilot shakes his head
The glass does cage, the compass stands still
And knows no North all signs of following ill,
The waves do carry us as if we should
Salute the clouds, and instantly it would
Throw us down headlong, leaving us to see
The dangers of the Seas Profundity;
Our rigging shattered and our sails are torn
The naked mast looks like a man forlorn
Nothing but prayer is left, we all implore
The God of mercy for a happy shore;
One man forgiveness of his sins, does crave,
His prayer is stoped by a cruel wave,
This man to heaven sends his dying cries,
Till fear had dried the conduits of his eyes
A third weeps for his Children; and another
Cries for his Parents, Sister, and a Brother,
The fifth does make a vow, if God does send
Him safe to Land ^e nere more will offend,
Thus all were fearing, praying, vowing. I,
After my prayers did Amorea cry,
But still the Tempest does stir up the Sea,
Again we labor and again we pray,
Then did we Sacrifice, unto the Main
Part of our loading but 'twas all in vain
For the unapeased Sea filled all again,
Thus like a second Babell did we fleet.
Confounded in our language, skill and wit,
The master called a loud and bid that man
To hale a rope, he takes the Quarter-Can
And thinks to drink, but to prevent his care
In comes the Sea, and gives a double share
Unto us all, the Master bideth some
To shift the Ballest, they to Pump do come,
Another he commands for to shut
The hatches, he the Ruther-band did cut
Thus all confounded, every one betakes
Himself again to prayer, and each one makes
Him ready for his death, now hopes are past,
And every one does fear he prays his last,
But God whose mercy always does extend
Beyond his Judgments (mercy without end)
In sparing Sinners, when we thought to die
The storm abates, and we the land discry
When presently a Boy to top is fore'd,
Who makes the Land to be the Irish Coast,
Whose swelling Seas so boisterous, fearful, rude,
Do far exceed their Mountains Altitude,
A Coast but too well known for cruel wrack,
The Master calls again, commands the Tack
To be haled close Aboard, away he stears,
And in conclusion, (but not void of fears,)
We get our haven; where after prayers given
Unto the God of Earth, the Sea, and Heaven,
With bended knees, erected hands and eyes,
We offer prayers, praise, vows, heart-sacrifice;
We went ashore, where presently I sped
My self of paper, writ, what you have read.
Thus God to see where we will repent or no,
Has saved our lives, Heavens grant we may do so.
Hopeless Affection. A Song.
1.
HOpeless Affection, flatter me no more,
Or else still flatter me,
Take from me quickly, ah but first restore
My loved destiny,
But it is the cruel fair
Augmenteth my despair,
Yet my unhappy fates,
Her love participates.
2.
It Is Amorea, it is only she,
My dying heart has slain,
Pardon me dear mine inhumanitie,
Come wound it once again,
For where I die or live
I freely do forgive
Mine own betraying eyes
Made me thy Sacrifice.
3.
Come, come away, and kill me with disdain,
And then I am set free,
When thou have done, look on the guiltless stain,
That then does follow thee:
For 'twas mine own desire
To steal Celestial fire
From off thy beauteous Heaven,
Forgive, thou art forgiven.
Under his Mistress's Picture.
I.
RAre Artesan, who ere thou art
That drew this lively counterfeit,
The work does show thou art expert,
Yet (give leave) 'ts not complete,
The reason is when she is near,
Thy workmanship does not appear.
II.
Had great Apelles present been,
Or Sir Vandike, but standing by,
And the Original but seen,
They both together would deny,
And both refuse to take in hand
A work that does their Art command:
On his departing.
1.
When I was forced to depart
From Amorea ever dear,
Think you how near
A sadness then did touch my heart.
2.
An Adamantine Law has fors't
Me to depart and leave my bliss,
Ah sure it is
A law shall always be accurs't.
3.
Yet go I must, and leave behind
My happyness unto my grief,
And no releif
Is left unto my troubled mind.
4.
Thus should my Amorea know,
Alas she does, but will not give
Any Reprive,
Unto my helpless overthrow.
A Fancy on Courting.
It Is a sport to see our Youth
How they do digress from truth,
When they summon beauties Fort,
And their Ladies first do court.
One will to his Mistress swear,
That she is the only fair,
And where ever he has been
A sweeter soul he has not seen.
Another says his Madam is
All his joy, his love, his bliss,
And a third perchance will tell
That his Lady does excel.
Should one of another Nation,
Come and see our Antic fashion,
How they wry and bow their bodies
To a woman as a Goddess.
He would think that they were paying,
Vows, unto a Saint, or praying,
And but see the Lady stand
With her slaves at her command.
He undoubtedly would say,
That So humble Slaves as they
In his travells has not seen,
Or a more adored Queen;
Yet if their Ladies seem to yield
They leave the garb and take the field.
On the Curtain of his Mistress's Picture.
1
VVOnder-hider tell me why,
Thou deniest to our sight,
And forbid'st our longing eye,
from her most refulgent light.
2.
Grand-usurper let us see,
Thy (too rich) concealed treasure,
That our fancies all with thee,
May perticipate in pleasure.
3
Cover-heaven, be but pleased,
Thy dark shadows to unfold,
Let our greedy sight be eased,
With thy more then orient gold.
4.
No, we must not see what is under,
Thou will still deny our suite,
Least our eyes be struck with wonder,
And our wonder strike us mute.
Writ on her Lute.
TEll me Princely instrument,
Whence proceeds this content,
Do those taking charms dwell
In thee, or her, I prithee tell?
Is there power in thy Sound,
Not to captivate, but wound?
Does the efficacy live
In thee, or else she does it give?
Tell me is it only air,
Can our hearts so much ensnare?
No, it is her heavenly touch,
That concerns us so much,
When her hands do bless thy strings,
See the pretty little things
How they tremble, yet express
Their gratitude with cheerfulness,
Who is he that would not stand,
Trembling if that blessed hand
Should but touch him, who is he
Would not shake unless a tree;
Who is he his joy can smother,
Hearing the one, or feeling the other.
To his Dream.
SPeak lovely Dream, how could thou find
Phantesies to show her mind,
Wast not enough to let us see
Her face alone, but must we be
Always in a such a taking,
Q^iet neither asleep nor waking.
It was but this very night
She appeared in my sight,
Morpheus having thither sent her,
I began to complement her,
But the cursed destinies
Looking on with jealous eyes,
Envious at our happy meeting,
Attropus cut off my sleeping,
Yet he had gi'n me the leisure
To describe the joy, and pleasure.
Of this lovely-loving Dream,
Had not waking lost my Theme.
Commanded to conceal his Love.
1.
LOve me, but how, not that it may be known,
Love me, and yet take care no love be shown:
Love me, but that you love me, still disown.
2.
Look not with eyes, that may suspicion give,
Live still in hope, yet always hope to live,
Grieve not at, all but ever seem to grieve.
3.
Think not a thought of Love, but yet retain
Me in your mind, remember, but refrain,
Blot out affection, yet let love remain.
4.
Seem still to change, but changes disapprove.
Remove your passion, yet in passion move,
Do not as much as whisper out your love.
5.
Let fall no word, no thought, no sigh, no tear,
Be joyful, but let joy be mixed with fear,
Deny to tell a secret to your ear.
6.
For know in love, there is a such an Art,
He loses all, a council will impart,
Let me be only lodged in thy heart.
The Phoenix.
1.
OFten have I wished to know
Why the Phoenix has her nest
far removed in the East,
Now the reason I can show.
2.
It Is because that in the West
We 'ave another of her race,
But we do not know the place
Where she will take up her rest.
3.
Amorea, it is she,
Yet alas, it is not known,
And I doubt will never be shown,
Whence that happy fire must be:
Shall this blessed Phoenix burn,
And raise young out of her Urn.
Loves Elegy.
RIng mournful Bells, for ever Ring,
Now Love is dead,
Let Qu^risters forget to Sing
Love being fled.
Musicians all your warbling Art,
You may set by
And Learn now to take to heart
Loves Elegy.
Great Hymen's Court is at an end
The Elysium Grove,
Contains nothing but a Feind,
That hates Love.
Mourn youth, and Poets, Muses, mourn,
In Sad attire,
Your fancies never more shall burn
With Loves chaste fire.
May young and old, and all lament
This dismal day,
And all erect a Monnument
On Loves dead clay.
No, Ring, Sing, Play, hark what is told,
Forbear to weep,
Youth, Poets,, Muses, Young, and old,
Love does but sleep.
On his Quondum Mistress.

Hespelon, and Amorea. A Dialogue.
Amorea.
Who is it that comes here,
To remove my settled fancies,
Hespelon.
It is one my only dear,
That has known all the chances
Of a Lovers careful fear.
Amorea.
Why alas, is it you my friend!
Have not yet those follies left thee?
Hespelon.
Dear, I never do intend,
Though my fortunes have bereft me
Of thy presence, for to end.
Amorea.
But perchance you will forget me
When the Object is removed.
Hespelon.
Thy opinion sure will fret me,
But too dearly I have loved
And my passion will not let me.
Amorea.
Yet I hope these toys will leave you
When you see a fairer creature.
Hespelon.
No your Author did deceive you
It was virtue, and not feature,
Which Induced me to crave you.
Amorea.
When you riper years aspire,
May be then your mind will falter.
Hespelon.
Who is he can quench the fire
Or his resolution alter
Being taken with desire
Amorea.
Yet in time and absence you
Will forget me, youth is fickle
Hespelon.
Which if time and absence do
Let the all destroying Sickle
Cut me from the world too:
Amorea.
Ah begone my dear I say,
Do not longer me Importune
Hespelon.
(Cursed be that cursed day
But more curs't my cursed fortune)
Saying So, she went away.
On the five Senses.
Seeing.
If the treasure on the Poe,
Ganges, Nile, or Mexicoe,
With the Beauty of the world,
All at once upon me hurled
If I cannot see my fair,
Wealth is wind, and beauties air
Hearing.
If the music from above,
Such as all the Gods do love,
Or the subtle Sirens voice,
Were presented to our choice,
If my Misteres do not hearken
Ears are deaf, and eyes do darken
Tasting
If Ambrosia here were given
Or Nepenthe drunk in Heaven,
With the most delitious Sallets,
That ere pleas`d Ambitious pallets,
If my Lady be not pleased,
Eyes, Ears, and Taste, are all diseased
Smelling.
If the Spices of the East,
Were ours, that please the Smell, and Taste;
All the flowers of Thessalie
And perfumes of Italy,
If my dearest do not love it,
Eyes, Eears, Taste, Smell, disaprove it.
Feeling.
Now the last (but best) I handle,
But for this I need no Candle,
If my Mistres do deceive me,
And of Feeling should bereave me,
If her Pulse I connot charm,
All my Senses do me harm.
Loves Liberty.
1
When Cupid had possessed my heart
With Amoreas Love,
And that my more diviner part
My meaner fancies prove,
When my affections all were crossed
And she did me deny,
The fallen Angel only lost
So great a Liberty.
2
When not obtaining deep despair
Had conquered my mind
And that a kind of hopeless fear
Did all my wishes blind
When I shall call to mind the day
That first I did her see,
With captived souls I then may say
I had a Liberty.
3
When with a Swan-like Song I sang
My Amoreas grace,
My Muse must then in changes ring
The wonders of her face,
When with her all commanding Love
My passions are set free,
The Spirits of the Elysium grove
Have no such Liberty.
4.
When as I hear her heavenly name
My Sadness is suppressed,
And nothing but a Loyal flame
Does harbor in my breast,
When with a look my grief is hurled
By the charms of her eye,
Only the Sun that Rules the world,
Does know Such liberty.
A Dream.
When Morpheus had possessed mine eyes
With sleep, and unconfined thought
Did stray, it to my fancy brought
The Image I so highly prize.
Sometimes I seem to see my dear
Tempted with a golden shower,
And yet so constant that their power,
Cannot change the mind of her.
Another time unto my grief
I think I see her for to yield,
And almost give up the field
Destitute of my Releif.
Then do I see (but grive to see)
A Rival does my place possess
And has all the happiness
Which was only due to me.
Yet at last if not deceived,
Amorea is unmoved,
No one but my self she loved,
Waking then my joys bereaved.
His complaint to the Groves.
GRoves-inhabitants draw near,
Afford your aid,
Let it no more be said
That I do live;
Ah come and drop a tear,
Your sorrow give,
But no reprieve.
Yet grant (oh grant) that I may dwell
Within your bowers,
My few remaining hours,
Whilst I relate,
And shall in dying tell,
I Am made by fate
Unfortunate.
But witness how I loyal die,
And that I take
My death for her sweet sake,
For when I found
That she did me deny,
Death gave the wound,
Adue, I sound.
To his Ingenuous Friend, J. P. Esquire on Limbing.
SPeak ingenuous Friend of mine,
Be but pleased for ^o show,
In what Regent or what Clime
Do those heavenly coullers grow.
We admire the mystery,
Of thy hidden secret Art,
Which not only fills the eye,
But does captivate the heart.
Here the heedless Lover views,
The well known adored face
Of his Mistress, straight renews
Hopes, and symptoms of new grace.
Here a piece like Beauties Queen,
That a winning modesty,
Then an humble pride is seen,
Thus a stately Majesty.
Here a Countenance is sad,
Ready to dissolve in tears,
There a face that looks half glad,
Intermixed with joy and fears.
Whence are thy rare Pencills brought,
Whence thy Art, and in what place,
Colors are, paint love and thought,
And declare it in the face.
Surely thou have gotten wings,
For to fetch this heavenly dye,
For they are not Terrene things,
Can so wound both heart and eye.
A Fancy.
FRom whence
Unthought of fancy, come thou now from whence,
Is thy pretense,
To disengage me of a fixed friend;
From whence,
Have thou the power to overthrow the sense,
Which cannot end,
But in the love of her to whom,
I do pretend.
Away,
Heart-wounding Cupid, now be gone, away
Ah do not slay,
My bleeding fancies with thy cruel dart,
But stay,
And let me think upon that happy day,
In which thy Art,
Did first obliege me to that glorious Ray,
Else quickly strike my heart.

A Pastoral Poem.
PHylacona having early
(In a morning that had fairly
Promised the ensuing day
All the glory of the May)
With a mellancholly pace
Come at Length unto the place,
That for Phylaconas love,
Called was the Goddess grove,
Here she used still and wholly,
For to treat her Mellancolly;
Here she entertained her sadness,
Though the place did promise gladness,
For there was the loving Vine,
With the stately growing Pine,
Ranks of Cedars there were seen,
And the Laurel, Forests Queen,
Next the Cipress, and the Yew
Did present themselves to view,
There a Bower of Kear is made,
Here a lovely Mertle shade,
With the Ivy and the Bays
That do crown the Poets Lays
Here the Poplar, there the Thorn
Which has Phylamela born
And in every tree there stood,
The Musitions of the wood,
Scarlin, Lennet, and the Thrush,
Crowned the top of every bush;
Underneath was to be seen,
(Running through) a spangled green
Well composed into Bowers
All enamelled with flowers;
As if Nature meant to show
What her art was able do;
Was a brook or little River,
Which did seem for to deliver
In its Language all the story,
Of that Nymphs Eternal glory,
Who (as Poets have Inserted)
Was into a stream converted.
Here She used to retire,
And the very same desire.
To be private in his Sorrow
Made her shepherd bid goodmorrow
To his sleeping, and to rise,
Shaking Slumber from his eyes,
" Sorrow would not let him stay
" For to entertain the day,
" But commanded him away
And to the grove did fortune hurry
Him, as she began her story:
When she thither was arived
Being of all joys deprived,
Only taken up with care.
This sad voice did reach his ear,
Which at first he had neglected,
Being with his grief affected,
Yet because he would not be
Taxed for discourtesie;
Round about him as he pried,
The sad Nymph he had espied
Who her tender limbs had laid
On a mantle that was spread,
" On the painted Tapistry,
" Of the flower-paved walks and nigh
" To the River did she lie.
And because he thought her fate
To his sadness did relate,
He supposing that her care
In his Sorrows had a share,
Out of Curiosity
Hid himself behind a tree;
Thus the Nymph being on the ground
After she had looked rownd,
Thinking on her present fears
Thus began her tail with tears;
Who can better tell then I,
To deplor the destiny
Of a sad forsaken Maid,
Only by my self betrayed,
I that in the height of life
When the Graces were at strife
Which should have the greatest prise
Language, carriage, voice, or eyes,
I who ever have been Courted
With the noblest, and consorted
With the most Gentieler sort,
And knew nothing but the Court
Nothing then could please me better
Then to read an humble Letter,
Such as Lovers do present
All composed of Complement,
Thus when I shall call to mind
What is past I then do find
All the happy hours are spent
Which to youth are incident,
And can see nothing of truth
Harbor in unsettled youth,
Yet when I shall think upon
The forsaken Espilon
(Who by his disloyalty
Has so disobleiged me)
Needs I must declare his worth:
With which words he steped forth,
Knowing this the first time
For to vindecate his crime,
With heavy pace and look
Being come unto the brook
After he himself had seated,
His excuse he thus repeated,
Madam if your very Servant
Have not still with wishes servant
Prosecuted your affection,
Never give my love protection,
Only you to have enjoyed
Be both wish and love destroyed
Or if ever I have loved
More then you your self Approved,
May my Love be still neglected,
And my falsness be dedected,
May my heart be ever grived,
May my vows be not believed,
If I do not thee desire,
Then let heart and vows expire;
Therefore dearest --
Here his hands would fain have brooken
Truce, if that she had not spoken
And her angry commands
Did forbid his longing hands,
Espelon, quoth she, my dear,
Leave me, least I justly fear,
That your carriage will deceive me;
Yet for this I do forgive thee,
But be sure you are not quitted,
For the punishment is fitted,
You forever shall be banished;
Saying so, away she vanished,
Like an airy broken bubble,
Leaving ^im unto his trouble,
Whereunto this Pastoral tended,
No man knows, for here it ended.
To Amorea on his going to Travel.
1.
IF that my Travel were to be so far,
(My only star)
To come again no more,
Then well I might implore,
Pardon from Cupid, and loves deity,
For the offense I Have done to Love, and thee.
2.
Yet Amorea be but pleased now
To take this vow,
If Fortune be my friend,
To grant a happy end
Unto my journey; offer up I shall,
To thy blessed shrine, my vows, my self, and all.
3.
But if I never do return,
Alas I mourn,
For her I left behind,
Yet dearest be so kind,
Only to think, I only for your sake,
This journey with my death did undertake.
Writ at Sea.
NOw had I bid farewell unto the Land,
And left behind that ever blessed shore
Blessed because it Amorea bore.
Yet could not leave to look upon the sand;
For now my grief began I took in hand
My Pen, in which my fancies heretofore
Did once delight, for why, it did restore
My hopes; but hark, the voice I do adore,
Commands back, who can that voice withstand,
It Is Amorea, it is her command.
To Cloris, imploring a revenge.
CLoris stay, and do not fly,
Give an ear to my Petition,
Which I offer up and make,
With submission,
And contrition,
That when you do vengeance take,
For dispensed loyalty,
Take it only of her eye.
For to captivate a lover,
Let it never more have power,
Take away it is former grace,
May a shower
Spoil the flower,
Of her once admired face,
Where she loves, ah remove her,
Let her love, but still above her.
Cloris, hark to my desire,
And behold my Sacrifice,
Do not pass too hard a sentence,
Drown her eyes,
With her cries,
Let her know a sad repentance,
But take mercy in thine ire,
'Cause I once did her admire.
In praise of Sack.
FRom where, or whence, at first this Liquor came,
Or how it had it is being none can tell,
Where the Pierian Fount did give it name,
Or where it flowed from Agganippe-Well,
Is now the question, truly I am one
That do believe the thing which we call Sherry,
Was planted first in sacred Hellicon,
Produced of some strange Celestial Berry;
One of the reasons, that does move me to it,
A reason I prefer before the best,
I never yet could meet a piece of Poet
But loved to take a glass beyond the rest,
And there is reason for it; 'twill make his pen
Run faster then his Muse is able think,
It sets him far above the reach of men,
Such is the virtue of this versing drink,
'Twill raife a drooping spirit to the height
'Twill send a known Coward unto the wars,
The taste so heavenly, and the look so bleigh,
That some do hold it is dissolved Stars,
But be it what it will, I never yet
Have found his equal, not in any thing,
It makes a man his sorrow to forget,
Equall's the lowest, with the greatest King,
What is it 'twill not do; yet there are some
That from my praises far enough do vary,
Who by their carriage show from whence they come
And never were so well bred to drink Canary,
And this I know, they are no Gentleman,
That (in that very thought) such drink deny,
Which is the Scholars Study, Poets pen,
The Lawyers guide, the Lovers deity,
All that the Poets feign, of Nectar is,
Composed in this little Sea of bliss,
Then Drawer bring it in, the hurt I Will do 'em,
Is drink to all, that do believe this Poem.
A SONG.
I Cannot say you are forsworn,
Since you have proved true,
And yet I think my self forlorn,
When by your actions still I view,
Your fancy's ranging for a new.
It Is true, you loved me a while,
But soon your love was cold,
Then think no more on Beauties guile,
For your embraces are grown old,
And have no force my heart to hold.
I see the Treasures of that face,
Which once I doted on
Is to be found in every place,
And all the fleeting graces gone,
There Is nothing left to look upon.
Yet when you'ave seen the worlds store,
And where the Beauties be,
Reclaim your self, I Will ask no more,
But am content the spoils to see
Alone devoted unto me.
On loving of two.
LAdies that you both may know,
What yo to your Servant owe,
I have both of you adored,
And have both your loves implored.
If I did but set mine eye,
On the one, and the other by;
I could nothing but admire,
Being ^corch'd with double fire.
Should I on Clariana look,
I do open Beauties book,
Where such lessons I do find,
As they captivate my mind.
If I look upon the first,
Though she have been too too cursed,
Yet I think new hopes of grace
Are in Amorea's face.
But that hope is soon defaced,
If Clariana will be pleased
To allow me in her sight,
Counting it my chief delight,
Amorea's love engages,
And a war within me wageth,
Clariana's sweet affection,
Then must serve for my protection.
If Clariana should be ill,
I do all her sickness feel,
But for Amorea's trouble,
I consume into a bubble.
Should Clariana be but pleased,
All my sorrows are appeased;
Yet if Amorea mourn.
All my joys to sorrow turn.
Those who Amorea've seen,
Say she is the Elysium Queen,
And that Clariana's face,
Only came from Phenix-race.
Scarce can I suppress the flames,
Sent by those adored Dames;
Were it not their haughty scorn,
Was to heavy to be born.
But now all is past and ended,
Had not Hymen me befriended,
I would never more have loved,
Had he not my mind disposed.
Saying if I chance to find
One that parallels the mind
Of these Ladies I have named,
She it is for me is framed.
The Shadow.
1.
YEsterday as I was seated,
And lay sleeping in an Arbor,
See my hopes were all defeated,
And were shipwrack'd in their Harbor,
For I thought I had been taking
All my treasure in mine arms,
But it proved when I was waking,
Nothing else but false alar'ms,
Yet it troubles me the less,
For the Gods had like success.
2.
One of them as does appear
In their Tale, for anger burned
When he saw his only dear,
To a shining Cloud was turned,
A second made his labor vain;
And another we do see,
For his Nymph embraced a stream,
And the third a Lawrell-Tree;
Thus the Gods themselves were used,
And with shadows are abused.
3
So it was with me alas,
When I thought I had my fair,
Like a shadow she did pass
And nothing left but fleeting air;
Then I waked discontented,
In a posture nigh disparing,
But my sadness was prevented,
By her personal appearing,
But nothing I of substance write
Whilst of shadows I Indite.
To Amorea walking in her Garden.
SEe how all things do conspire,
And agree with her desire,
For when she does bless the walks
On each side the Verdure stalks
As if waiting her commands,
Bow themselves to kiss her hands,
And the early growing bush,
Whose rare flowers now do blush,
Joying that they are in the way,
To her lap their Tribute pay
And as she her self disposes
So the Marigold discloseth
And her Inward parts discover
As to the Sun her constant lover,
Then when she her body shadeth
Straight the Heliotropian fades,
Other flowers take new birth;
From her presence, scorn the earth,
By imploring a divorce,
From their mother, and their nurse,
" See the Tulips how they bow
" Down their golden heads, and how
" In dumb elloquence they woe
Hopeing that, that Blessed hand,
Will confine them for to stand,
In some window there to be
In her presence till they die,
Lilly, Juliflower and Pancy,
All submit unto her fancy
And her pretty fingers do
pray t'accept their offering too,
Hundreds more as good as they
Do come thronging in her way,
To exchange their liberty
For a sweet captivity,
Thus being sated with delight
She begins for to unite
Them into a Garland, and
With her sweet composing hand:
Crowned her sleeping shepherd, whom
Little thought it was his dome,
Then with humble grace she bowed,
To the rest, who being proud
Of their happiness to meet,
In the Allies with her feet;
Thus she being gone away,
(Ah that dismal fatal day)
The poor youth as soon as he
Waked, found his destenie,
And with that began to tear
All the favors which he ware
In her honor, and his cry
Was disloyalty I die.
So the Garland which she gave
Served to adron his grave.
To Mr. James Sherley on his plays.
Mirror of Comedies, and of our age,
That have re-edified the falling Stage
And once more built the Theater with thy pen,
In Spite of foes, have made it live again;
What can we render, thy Admired Plays,
Already have sequestered the Bays
From of the head of those who writ before,
Which were but shadows to thy works, no more.
Who is not joyed when he sees the fall,
And punnishment of vice, thy Cardinal
And taught by thy Imposture for to shun
Lascivious courses, or else be undone:
Thy Brothers teach us love; thy Sisters do;
In courtly terms, show us how to woe.
Or if we will be read in points of State,
Then thy Court Secret make us up complete,
What shall we offer then, or what Present,
We Will add this Trophey to thy Monument
That ages yet to come shall hear and see,
When dead, thy Works a living Elegy.
On the perfection of Beauty.
GAze not on starr's whose twinkling light
The spangled glory of the night:
Nor on the Suns refulgent eye
Darting Silver from the sky:
Look not on Spotless Ermines tho`
For whitness they excel the Snow,
Nor pretty Turtle-Doves who be.
The emblimes of loved amity:
Think not on Muses, graces, now,
Nor the Seven wonders we allow,
Nor would I have you think upon
The Poet-nursing Hellicon
Wonder not why, Pearls vallued are,
Or Rubies why accounted rare,
or Diamonds who sparkleforth
At once their luster and their worth.
For If Clariana come in sight,
Stars do fall and lose their light,
The Sun Eclipsed does post away,
And sets an end unto the day.
Ermines run into disgrace,
Baffled when they see her face.
Turtles dying leave the Grove
To see themselves out-gone in love:
The Muses, Graces, Wonders seven,
Are vexed that now they are made even.
Mount Hellicon her self does fear
All Poesy does flow from her:
Pearls are mad that now they must
Be look`t upon as glittering dust.
Rubies ashamed, away did skip,
And vowed a vengeance on her lip;
Diamonds for grief have sworn,
That they will never more be worn.
Thus stars are falen, the Sun is fled,
Ermines baffled, Turtles dead,
The Muses, Graces, Hellicon,
The Wonders, vex, fear, as undone,
Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, are mad, shame, swear,
And all because Clariana is so fair.
To his unconstant Mistress.
What, only constant in unconstancie?
And true alone to mutability?
Like the still changing wind
That moves the curles of thy hair,
Kill, or be kind,
Dissolve or bind
The double knot of my despair,
Speak life, or let me die.
For winged with hope, and baffled by disdain,
I think I am not safe, nor am I slain,
Yet puffed up with desire,
To reach my earthly happiness,
My hopes exspire,
In the fire
Of dull flaming heaviness,
Burnt up, yet live again.
So in the balance of hope, love, and fear,
Secured by confidence ye^ drowned in care,
I once more come to try,
And once again implore,
If you deny,
Although I die,
I vow never to affect thee more,
Believe me when I swear.
An Elegy on the Death of the Princess Royal.
Go, Ladies, stay, ah go, no stay and mourn
A while, lay down your Lutes, ah come and turn
Your deep concerned eyes upon this Tomb,
Read, and lament, as if you read your doom
Alas make haste, come pay your Obsequies
Unto her memory with drowned eyes,
Attend this Monument, forget to see
Your selves carrassed, may you ever be,
In mourning habits, and where e're you walk,
May death and Funerals be all your talk,
And if you sleep, may your dreams be of Bells,
Of Hearses, Coffins, Monuments, and Knells,
May all your days of pleasure and delight,
Be Metamorphosed to dismal night,
For Virtue's dead, and in her all is gone
That Virtue's very self can think upon;
Now certainly a wrack is to be feared,
For gon's the Star, and North, by which you stear'd,
Gone is the Touchstone, which was wont to try
Whither was richer love, or constancy;
Gone is your Torch, and gone away your Sun;
Your Lights extinguished e're it was begun,
Nothing is left but mourning, but you will say
Who it should concern or dismay,
Or so obliege us HER to think upon;
Is It not enough to tell you Virtue's gone:
It is the Princess whom I Would named, but when
I name Her once, grief drownds my tongue and pen.
To Phyla.
PHyla I will not enquire,
What has been thy past desire,
Nor is it sitting you should know
Unto whom I Have made a vow,
Prithee Phyla tell me now
What has made thee to retire,
Is it 'cause I do admire
Other beauties, is it so?
Tell me Phila, I think no,
For I still retain the fire
Which was kindled long ago
In my mind, and flameth higher,
If I chance to come but nigh her;
Phyla will thou know who it is,
Speak (thy self) thou can not miss,
The difference between a Lute, and a Via
IT fell out the other day,
Two Ladies busy at their play,
The One a Vial with her voice,
Did accord a Heavenly noise,
The Other a Theorboe held,
Which when they the Room had filled,
With their Music then it was,
Striving which of them could pass
Each the other, (then say I,)
Music was Divinity;
Madam, quoth the first, I think,
If Napenthe be a drink
That does reconcile the Gods
When they chance to fall at odds,
Certainly without denial,
It Is distilled through a Vial;
Quoth the other to confute
Your argument, why not a Lute,
And I coming in the while,
They began to blush and smile,
Saying both, you that so well
Of Love do undertake to tell,
And have ventured to set forth
In a Poem the rare worth,
That in Musicks charms lie,
Speak without partiality,
Which is fitter for Love's Quire,
Amphion's Lute, or Orpheus Lire;
Thus betwixt a Scila I,
And Charibdis then did lie,
Should I dare to say a Lute,
Farewell my intended suite;
Or if I a Vial praise,
Then my Mistress I displease,
Will you take a Poets oath,
Then by Sack I pleased them both,
Amphion's Lute I did advance,
Because it made the stones to dance,
And when they had found the trial,
Which was sweeter Lute or Vial,
With the reason both were mute,
Both concluding 'twas a Lute.
The Change.
1.
CHloe, I wondering in my mind,
Why men do such changlings prove,
Now the very cause I find,
It Is occasioned by love,
And no judgment from above.
2.
First I found it in my self,
For I was not born so,
Yet alas the pievish Elf
Needs must have a Mistress too;
Pardon Chloe, it is not you.
3.
Which when I had gotten, I
Lost within a day or two
Though I told her I could die
For her love; there came a new,
Made me bid the old adieu.
4.
Thus I changed for Chloe's sake,
After I had made a vow,
Which I changed and did make
Others that are broken now,
Which my Chloe must allow.
5.
For I Am changed from hope to fears,
See what Chloe's love can do,
Changed even in my prayers,
Believe me Chloe it is true,
Changed to all, but King, and you.
To Amorea. A Song.
AMorea, when that you
Honor with your sweet repeating,
My poor fancies, then I do
Think the Heavens are completing,
All my joys, and pleasures too.
Yet the cause I cannot show,
Unless it be for this reason,
That you know it is your due,
When in Verse I mean to praise one,
All the glory's meant to you.
For when I begin to vow
Clariana is my fairest,
Or do Chloes love allow,
Or say Phyla is my dearest,
All do end in you you know.
What say, can you then deny;
But the reason I have found,
It Is because that they and I
Swear your Beauty is the ground,
Make us call you deity.
On the Inequalletie of Marraige.
It Is strange to see the unavoided fate
Of many in this humor when to late
They find their error, one perchance will cry
What should I do against my destiny,
Antoher half destracted will persuade
He`s happier in the maid then if he had,
Obtain`d the Mistres, think fond youth if wise
Is`t better draw a blanck, or have a prize,
Yet if thou`lt Marry and their be no friend
Can disingage thee of thy Madness, lend
And ear to reason, first be sure you see
Where she do correspond in quallitie,
Not that i`de have you fly too high, and so
Like Iccarus you drown your self, no, no,
I`me not for such a Marriage, for I`ve read
Of Eagles feathers, if put in a bed
All other feathers instantly consume
Devouring those that are not of their plume
Yet on the contrary, I`de have you show,
Your self from whence you came go not so low:
To draw a scorn upon Posterity
For that`s a blemish that will never be
Extinquish`d but by time and perchance you.
Stooping too low will be Extinguish`d too,
Is it not pity that it should be said
The Son and heir will have a Chambermaid,
And who can help it, when it is their doom
The only daughter doates upon a groom:
And so destroy all that their father got
By wit, or valor, Industry, or lot,
But hearken youth, if not infatuate
To all misfortunes, let us expostulate,
Why should a Goss-hawke fly at Titmice, or
What need a Faulcon stoop unto a Dor
Are not there Princely fowls enough, but they
Must be content on Butterflyes to prey,
What follies this, are there not mediums left
To be embraced, but just like men bereaft
Of sense and reason, we must headlong run
We know not where, before we are undone,
Can we not be content to change our name
By transmutation to the very same
It was before, when suffering Loyalty
Shall still be lov`d by noble Honesty
What would you have, would you join Land to Land
Do it, provided you go hand in hand,
In age, birth, fortune, Love, if not take care
What you do think is good may prove a snare,
And if these reasons will not serve the turn,
Fly like, play with the candell, till you burn
And then you will let the world for to see
Marraige, and Hanging goes by destiny.
Clariana's Dream.
1.
CLariana slept, and as she slept,
The God of Night stood by;
The God of Love for anger wept,
That he could not be nigh.
2.
Clariana wept, and weeping cried,
(O'rewhelmed with her care,)
What have thou asked, that I denied,
Speak Hespelon my dear.
3.
Clariana waked, and waking found
That all was but a Dream,
She sigh't, and fell into a sound,
But never revived again.
Love and Respect.
1.
IT is not that I love the fairest,
Less then when my love I tendered,
But 'twas hopeless love, my dearest,
That my deep affection hindered.
2.
Yet it is not hopeless love shall fear me,
Or command my love to end,
It Is the high respect I bear thee,
Will not leave me to offend.
3.
Were I confident to carry,
Thy affection it would be
No content at all to marry,
If the conquest were not free.
4.
But if you vouchsafe to pardon
My presumption, do but prove,
I will render thee the geurdon
Of a never-dying love.
The Authors dream.
NOt long agon being thrown upon my bed
Repleat with Sorrow, my unsettled head
With Perturbation of a troubled mind
Turned giddy with it is cares, no rest could find,
It was about the hour that the clock
Had stricken two, the early waking Cock,
Had gi'n his first Allarum to the day,
Sleep seas'd my drowned eyes, and grief gave way
To nature to (exact her tribute) when
Somnious who does command the eyes of men:
Did charm me first asleep, then sent a dream
The which disturbed my late settled brain,
And thus it was, me thought I had set forth,
A little Pinnice, which toward the North
Was bound with swelling sails: a lofty wind
Yet not to high encountered me behind:
The Symptoms of a happy voyage and all
Good fortune on our side did seem to fall
For having past the Isles of th` Orcades
Norvegia, Thule, (next the frozen Seas)
And having more then hopes to reach our Port
Neptune as if he meant himself to sport,
With our mishapes, bid the winds blow and they
No sooner were commanded but obey
And every thing conforming to his will
Made us to soon to see onr cause was ill
When after all our Masts and rigging spent
With all misfortunes that are Incident.
To Sailors in storm: we discry'd
Two other Vessels driven with the Tide?
And laboring for their Haven but they found
To soon unto their loss, themselves a ground
The Climate where we were, and the degree
Was known to them, and not unknown to me
The Northern Amazons possessed the Land
Their Queen Clarianna, under whose command
The Country flourisht, and the very place
Where the Ships stood, night to her Palace was
Yet could not I so happy be as they,
For when I had recovered the Bay
A second storm did assail us and
Neptune to Eolus had given his hand
To make us only wretched as if both
Had past their pledges by a mutual Oath
To Thunder down their vengeance for the most
That each of them could do, we felt the worst
But that I may not Vary from my Theme
Because it is pertinent unto my Dream,
Know the two Ships were driven to the Land
And stuck half buried on a Bar of Sand.
On the Ports Star-boord side the one was fast
The other a little to the Larboord cast.
Betwixt them was the River wherein we
Must thrust our torn vessel or else be
Ingulfd in sudden ruin; at which I
Spoke to the Master with a hasty cry:
Demanding his advice, and what to do:
Quoth he our evils now are more then two;
For if to windward of that ship we stand
Then ours will be involved in the Sand
To Leeward of the other should we fall,
Undoubtedly we lose ship, men and all:
For every side there is danger, should we steer
Betwixt them both, on every hand ther`s fear;
Of falling soul, again, if we should trust
Unto our Anchors, that`s the very worst.
Well this is to be done (and what de`e think)
We`le in betwixt them, if we sink, we sink:
These were his words, and in this very Fashion
He brought them out, but hold the Situation
Of Clarianna's Palace shall be shown,
For such a graceful object must be know.
The house was seated on a rising hill,
Inshrin`d with Cyprus trees but here my quill
Will prove deficient, should I bnt talk:
Or set the graces forth of every walk.
If on the buildings I should write or look
My pen would run it self into a book.
But I Will decline the hill again for fear
I should forget my Dream and end it there,
Which must not be before I let you see
What happened in my Dream and unto me,
For being Sad and pensive in my mind
'Cause I could not the interpretation find:
I grew more troubled, but this accident
My grief and sorrows quickly did prevent;
It seemed to me I saw before mine eyes
The ground to open, and a man to rise?
Whose venerable age had showred
A Snowy benediction on his head,
And in one hand (me thought) he held a Globe,
And in the other was an Astralobe
The moon upon his head, a glittering Coat
Spangled with stars he ware which did denote
What he had been in his foregoing years
`Tis like he knew the motion of the Spheres:
The heavens Influence which does infer
The man had been a great Astronomer.
And thus he spoke: Come hither musing youth
Know that thy Dream has something in`t of truth
Sit down, observe, remember what is told,
And thus he did begin my Dream t`unfold.
The Pinnice thou were in does Signify,
Thy very self; the Swelling sails thy high
Ambitious aim; the wind that followed thee
Portendeth all good hap undoubtedly;
The countries thou did`st pass by and the Seas
Show thou have mist some fortunes in thy days:
But nothing lost, next did I list to show
Who Neptune is but will not for I know
To soon thou`lt find it out: for it is he
Will cross thy hopes, and then remember me:
The falling of thy mast denotes plain
Obstructions will impede and intervean
Betwixt thee and thy wish; the other two
That seemed ships are men as well as you:
And that I may not speak misteriously
They are thy Rivalls who most certainly,
Will do their utmost and the haven is
No other but your virtuous Mistress:
Their going a ground their want of Judgment and
Does show they were to young to take in hand.
So great a voyage; the Climate and degree,
Her name and quallitie I`me sure must be?
That they were Amazons, it does dilate
A sprightly Lady; the Queens name, her state:
That the ships Struck, so nigh her palace sure
Shows the unhappiness they must endure
And that the bay thou reachest it does tell
After the storm is past it may go well,
That Eolus and Neptune did combine,
Does say two crossing Counselors will join
To blow up thy designs, but they will be crossed,
For be contented they are like to lost
Their thankless labors; that the ships struck I Am bold
To let thee know, by sand is meant her Gold;
Betwixt them did the River run; that does
The Ladies equal couldness show to both,
Thy hasty cry be sure does intimate,
Thou make dispatch, or else 'twill be too late.
The man of whom thou did implore advice,
Is thy best friend in Council; if you are wise
Observe his words, be sure thou understand
The dangers threatened on every hand,
The Masters last advice does show to thee
That resolution must not wanting be;
The Graceful Palace, and it is situation,
It shows the Ladies virtuous education,
That it was seated on a rising hill,
Declares her Birth and Beauty, which thy Quill
Can never praise enough, the Trees set fourth
Her noble parts, the Walks her grace and worth.
Thus have I showed thee all, and lastly I,
Am called by the name of Ptollomy,
At which I wondered when I thought upon
He died many hundred years agon:
And then I answered, saying, Reverend Sage,
Thou have not let me know her name nor age,
But what I said was spoken to the wind,
For he was vanished, yet left behind,
A role of Paper, which I greedily
Snatched from the ground, and read as hastily,
And thus it did contain, If any do
For curiosity, desire to know
What course the Pinnace took, and what became
Of the two ships, or what the Ladies name,
With the conclusion? let thy answer be,
It Is wholly left unto Astronomy,
To give a happy period to the thing,
And reading here, sleep with a hasty wing
Began to fly me, yet the time was given
To read these following words, It Is only Heaven
Can give a blessing, and compose thy cares,
It Is Heaven must be propitious to thy prayers,
Commit thy ways to Heaven, and Heaven will
Direct thee what to do, protect thee still,
And Heaven will bless thee sleeping, keep thee waking:
And thus I waked when these words were speaking.
To the Sun.
1.
Go Glorious Sun,
Set in perpetual night,
I shun thy light,
Now she is gone
In whom all joys did shine,
My darkened sight
Can see nothing that is divine.
2.
Go glorious Sun,
And tell her brighter Ray
I come away,
Tell her I run,
My coming is not far,
The message can be done
By none but thee unto a Starr.
On the Death of his Mistress.
1.
ASk me not why the Rose does fade,
Lillies look pale, and Flowers die,
Question not why the Myrtle shade,
Her wonted shadows does deny.
2.
Seek not to know from whence begun
The sadness of the Nightingale,
Nor why the Helletrope and Sun,
Their constant Amity do fail.
3.
The Turtle's grief look not upon,
Nor why the Palm Tree does mourn,
When Widow-like they are left alone,
Nor Phoenix, why her self does burn.
4.
For she is dead which life did give
Unto those things that here I name,
They fade, change, wither, cease to live,
Pine, and consume into a flame.
On His Sacred MAJESTY'S haypy Restoration.
HAve you not seen after some boisterous night
The Sun's approach, when he salutes our sight,
Have you not viewed the lusttre that it yields,
In gilding every thing, the very Fields
As yet bedewed with tears, and coulds anoy,
Do weep and smile together both for joy;
Just so it is with us: hark what a noise
Runs through the Land, all to express our joys:
Our Sun's returned unto his longing Land,
And brought Amnistia with him in his hand,
Never did Persians rejoice to see
The Sun they worship, half so much as we;
Nor Greenland that has darkness half the year,
Is not so joy'd when the Sun does appear,
To stay six months within that Hemisphere.
Our King has brought Religion home, and peace,
Attended on with with plenty and increase;
We know no war, no sword, no fierce Alar'ms,
But from Arm, Arm, we now go arm in arm;
A blessed change, a such a change as this
Surpasses any Metamorphosis,
Where men are turned to Monsters, here we see
Monsters put off their inhumanitie,
Here is the golden age returned again,
The Lamb takes up his rest in the Lions den,
The very Pirates they turn Merchantmen;
And those who but a while ago would slay,
Any of those they thought stood in their way:
And nothing heard of discord one with the other,
There Is no name known, unless the name of Brother;
And of our wrongs there is no reiteration,
A happy turn, a blessed Restoration,
See but the carrying on this mighty thing;
When we'd tried all, there is nothing but a King
Could heal our breaches, and when he was come,
All interests had their satisfaction,
And note the carriage of the work, and then
You Will see the hand of God, 'twas not of men,
The difference was composed, for we find
So many thousands to be of one mind,
And all agree in one, observe but this,
Both Land, and Sea, concurred in our bliss,
It is observable, the Month of May,
Did post unto her Nine and twentieth Day,
That day which first gave life unto our KING,
Was double blessed by his Coming In:
Should we abuse this mercy, (but it is fin
To think a thought to let Rebellion in)
By breaking of this happy Union,
When all is buried in Oblivion,
'Twould be a means such curses for to bring,
As Heaven defend us from.
God save the KING.
To the most Honored Sir James Smith Knight, On his many favors received.
SIR, I Fear my boldness may impute me rude,
And to say nothing were ingratitude;
Can I for favors had of such a one,
Bury my thanks in dark oblivion,
And where I ought to pay all thankfulness.
Render my self base, by forgetfulness;
Should I which have received from your hand,
Of bounty, so much kindness; should I stand,
Without acknowledgement, as if that I
Were quite divested of civility;
No, no, such Boons as those, must needs require
Returns, which (in some measure of desire)
Should testify, a grateful mind, in part
He pays such debts, which has a thankful heart,
And such my payment for these loves, must be
Paid by good wishes, to eternity.
To Celinda.
1.
COme Celinda, come away,
Sweet Celinda do not stay,
Bless our longing longing-eyes,
Harken to your Shepherd's cries,
That does vow,
To allow
Every year unto that day
Such a thankful Sacrifice,
As he 'th sworn for to slay
Half his Flock: come, come away.
2.
And when my Celinda shall
Make me happy by a call,
Saying Shepherd now I come,
See Alexis be at home;
Then I Will make,
For her sake
A Holy Day throughout the Vale.
Giving all my Flock to some
Shepherd, that has known all
My love. I hear Celinda call.
EPIGRAMS.
On a simple Gentleman which spoke in dispraise of Poetry.
A Gentleman, for want of education,
Said Epigrams, and Poems, were but toys.
And in his judgment and small estimation,
Are only fit for Girls, and for Boys:
Another standing by that wished well
To Poetry, and loved a witty Rhyme,
Your judgment Sir, alas what can you tell?
Thus it is to cast a Pearl before a Swine,
Pray hold your peace, for Poets hold it fit,
That Ignorance must not be Judge of Wit.
On my want of Money.
What though I want Pecunia, what of it,
I never passed such a merry age,
As when I did employ my little wit,
To free my self of this sad Pilgrimage,
But by experience I find Poetry,
It Is sad to tell, shakes hands with poverty.
On a Vintner
A Vintner on a time did me persuade
To make an Epigram upon his Trade,
Only the love of Sack did make me write.
They Are glad to see men drop, but will not fight,
And yet are always Drawing, which implies,
When others fall, such Knaves as they do rise.
On a Lawyers Wife.
A Lawyer did complain unto his Wife,
He never had such a Term in all his life;
Content your self (quoth she) but this Vacation,
And the next Term I Will use my Occupation,
For with my Little Common Law I Have found
A trick in Plea, to get me many a pound.
On a Tailor.
A Tailor that for me had made a Suit,
'Twas Allamode, and all things fitting to it,
But when I put it on, I was in wrath,
Telling the Rascal he had stole my Cloth,
It is too short said I, thou'st made it ill,
Be pleased (quoth he) I Will length'nt with my Bill.
On a Poetaster.
A Poetaster of our latter times
Began to versesy upon the Vine
He ask't me my oppinion of his rhimes:
I told him they were very like our wine
What do you mean quoth he are they not good:
Yes Passing good said I, if understood.
On Frenetta.
FRenetta is a gamster most men know,
Yet she will venture all on a good cast:
And though her fortune be but bad at throw
She hopes to keep an oppen point at last,
Then be as fortunate, as e`re you can,
Frenetta`s sure to carry the first Man.
On a Deboist Scoller.
SCollasticus with much Phillosophy,
Began to praise the University?
And after three years study now he see's
That he is able for to take degrees
All men that know him, see that he is able
At Tavern, Tenness, Dice, and Biliard-table
For by degrees, he'ath learnt a way of late,
To spend a very fair, and large estate.
On a Coukold.
OLd Curno, and his young new married Wife
Had never a quiet hour in all their life
For in their Jarring, this is still his noat
Telling his wife, she was not worth a groat
Thou lie quoth she, for thou have more with me
Then ever I am like to have by thee,
Why, what, you base confounded Whore quoth he
^ornes, Coukold, Knave, if I a Whore must be.
On a Duble Marraige
SIr Seldom-Sober, and his eldest Son;
Came to Sir. Idle-Spend thrifts dwelling place
After the Cerremonies all were done,
Young Sober ask't to see his Daughter Grace.
Is that your errand Sir (quoth Spendthrift) here
She has not been with me I know not when,
Nor yet with us quoth Sober for I swear,
I Have seen her not this twenty years and ten:
Pardon me then quoth Spendthrif, you must tarry
For Cosen Jermans are forbid to Marry.
On a Zealous Brother.
ROtundus prays much and sings Psalms
Gives to the poor, but will not have it known
And when that he dist^ibuteth his Alms:
No Trumpet shall within his gate be blown
By this the world may plainly Judge and see
Rotundus is not what he seems to be.
On a Lawyer.
A Lawyer is a man, I know not how
For to discribe him right as I should do,
For if a man another chance to sue,
He`s for the Plaintiff and Defendant too?
And though I`me cheated yet unto his face
God bless your worship, how goes on my cause
Why well quoth he, povided that this Bill
Be sattisfyed, or else it may go ill;
They are the painful`st men in all the nation
And why, they ca`nt abide a long Vacation:
Yet if my cause be spoild, he must be prais`d
Give them good Terms and then the Knaves are pleas`d
On a Shoemaker.
CRispianus with another would contend
His trade, and Calling ne`re should ^ave an End
`Tis strange that Crispianus So will strive,
For why without his Ends he cannot live,
Yet though he Waxes poor it is confessed
His trade will hold unto the very Last,
On Mistress Florella.
MIstress Florella had a Plat of Land
Entailed to her so long as she did live,
An honest fellow that did understand
She would dispose it, asked what he should give,
Florella understood the Fellow had,
A Pole of Ground would fit her to a hair,
Why Sir quoth she, I shall be very glad
T'exchange, if that your evidence be fair,
The woman showed a trial on record,
And would join Issue with him i^ he please,
The Fellow could not stand unto his word,
And yet he found it was an o en Case,
Your title's lame said she, you cannot seal,
For you your self are Tenant but in Tail.
On a Holy Sister.
A Holy Sister that did seldom err,
Walking abroad upon a Lecture-day,
Did meet a very zealous Presbiter,
Who swear to try her, e're he went away;
Nay, fie, ah sad, ver'ly indeed forsooth,
I would not do it, but to save your oath.
On a Puny Scholar.
A Puny Scholar that had got degree,
Would take a journey for his recreations,
Into the Country, took the liberty
To preach, his Text was in the Lamentations;
The Fellow never from his Text did fall,
For the whole work was Lamentable all.
On Hunters.
HUnters are men of a strange constitution,
For most love peace, they bawling and confusion:
It is not possible Hunters can thrive,
That make themselves such prisoners while they live,
For why, the Hunters does himself confine
Unto a cursed Kennell all his time,
And in the end perchance Acteon's fate
Falls on his head, and eats up his Estate.
On Falconers.
FAl'kners for whooping, hollowing, whisling, I
Do think they are born mad, and so will die.
Yet I confess it is a Noble fight;
To see a Hawk to make a gallant flight,
Were It not that in the end unhappily,
The Hawk, and fortunes both away do fly.
On a Poet.
SHould I forbear to write an Epigram
Upon a Poet, this, or the other man
Might pick a quarrel, asking what are you
That write these Epigrams, a Poet too,
Peace Buzzard, peace for fear I do pronounce
Another Epigram upon a Dunce,
The worst that Blockheads dare to speak of it,
Poets are (poor in person) rich in wit.
The Unfortunate Lover.
I.
I That Amorea loved,
I who in her love delighted,
I, poor I, am disapproved,
I, and only I, am slighted.
2.
I which in her love did glory,
I am he that once was blessed,
I can speak the saddest story
I in Love have found expressed.
3.
I that thought the time was wasted,
I mispended from her presence,
I a sad farewell have tasted,
I alas have lost my Essence.
4.
I the Wretch whom Love has smitten,
I by love was never befriended,
I that sometime Love have written,
I have done for Love is ended.
The Conclusion.
LIke to a Ship that now involved must be
In th'Abiss of all profundity,
When a Charibdiss sends a cruel Billow
To intimate his thundering neighbur Scilla,
To entertain the Wrack, or like a man
That just before his death, sings with the Swan:
So it is now with me; I Versefy,
And Carroll out my dying Tragedy.
'Twas Amorea, it was only she,
The sole effect of my loved destiny:
'Twas she alone that could the sentence give,
And after judgment grant a sweet reprieve;
'Twas she at first, that stole my liberty,
Making it captive, which was born free,
'Twas she that did command me for to prove,
And write the best of passions, which is Love:
'Twas she that set my senses all at strife,
It Is she that can, but will not save a life,
It Is she my thoughts have put in a confusion,
It Is she presented me with this conclusion,
'Twa she that scorned such a love as mine is,
It Is she has gi`n my Love and Book a
FINIS.
To his little Book.
Go little Book, let Amorea know
What she does owe
Unto thy Author, and her dying Swain
Show her disdain;
No, stay and take thy errand, let her see
It Is cruel she
Has brought her servant to a deep despair,
By being fair.
But go and do not fear to tell her, go and show
That lovely foe,
By disoblieging him, and slighting thee,
Both are set free;
And if in reading thee, that killing Saine
Does once relent;
Tell her it was her scornful Tyranny,
Has set an end unto my love and thee.
On the Contents of his Book, to the Readers.
I Need no Index to my Book, for it is
So little, that I Am sure you cannot miss;
Yet 'cause it is usual, I will immitate
The Major Poets: do not be angry at
My bold presumption, if thou're such a one,
My Book shall have Contents, though thou have none.

ERATA.
BEsides the errors in each leaf, and line
In every word, and every Character,
The greatest error I confess is mine
In writing, for in silence none can err,
Who er`e the Reader be I him Implore
That shall vouchsafe to Read this little book
Pardon the errors I will ask no more,
Or pass them over with a candid look:
And if thou have not so much Charity
I care not for the Errors nor for thee.
