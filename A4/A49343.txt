THE Loyal Apprentices PROTESTATION.
ALas! What Times are those we are like to see,
When Men are stigmatized for LOYALTY;
And called Tivies, Tories, and what not,
And worse abused than those concerned In The PLOT?
And we Poor 'Prentices, how we are abused,
Because to side with Faction we refused:
Had we with Clubs and Staves run to Whitehall,
And there demanded Things Irrational:
Run into Churches, and tore Common Prayers,
Pulled out the Good old Bishops by the Ears,
And rent the Surplices, those decent Wares;
Revived but Forty One again; O then,
Instead of VERMIN, we'd been Gentlemen!
But hold Impartial, We are not so mad
For to displease our KING, to make thee glad,
I know full well that is it thou would have Us do,
But know dull Ass, we'll not be advised by you.
Thou simple Sot, the very worst of Fools,
Do think to make of Us Forty One Tools;
By Publishing thy damned fallacious Stories,
To asperse those Loyal Men, whom thou call'st Tories?
Who can expect peaceable Times to see,
Whilst thou art thus fomenting Enmity?
And is this the way to Extirpate the Pope*
Judge now thy self if thou do'nt merit R
But on, thou damned Incendiary, Print what you will,
We London APPRENTICES will be Loyal still:
We ever loved our KING, and ever shall;
And for his Service, our Lives and Fortunes all
Does lie prepared, whilst he has need to call.
In the mean time We Apprentices will Sing,
And clap our Hands, and say, God save our King.
