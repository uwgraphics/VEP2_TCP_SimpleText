A BRIEF SUM OF Christian Religion. OR, Of things most necessary for a
Christians Knowledge, Practice, and Comfort.

COMPOSED By THOMAS GREAVES, a Minister of the Gospel.

Deuteronomy. 11. 18, 19. and chapter 6. 6, 7. Ye shall lay up these my words in your
heart, and in your soul, and ye shall teach them your Children, speaking of
them when thou sit in thy house, and when thou walk by the way, when
thou lie down, and when thou risest up.

August. de trad. Symb -- Simplex, breve, plenum; Ut simplicitas Audientium
consulat rusticitati, brevitas memoriae, plenitudo doctrinae -- It is plain,
brief, full: that plainness may be an help to the unlearned, briefness to
memory, fullness to the instruction of the Hearers.

Printed at London 1656.

SEt your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you. -- For it is
not a vain thing for you, because it is your Life.

Deuteronomy. 32. 46, 47. I pray God that you may be filled with the knowledge of his
will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding: That you may walk worthy of
the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing
in the knowledge of God.

Col. 1. 9, 10. MAny Testimonies of Scripture (for the fuller confirmation of
the Doctrine here delivered) are in due order annexed, and ought to be
diligently considered. Sometimes the same place, though but once quoted, has
reference to several parts of the same Proposition, which I thought unnecessary
to iterate. All joined together prove the whole proposition, and every branch
thereof.

To the Christian Reader.
THis short Treatise I chiefly designed for that Congregation, to which as a
Minister, I have peculiar reference, which consisting (for the greatest part)
of plain, and unlearned people, plainness, and brevity was purposely sought,
and intended by me: that so being clear to their Understanding, and easy for
their Memory, it might be the better conceived, and retained.

The Scriptures themselves do often Summarily express the chief points
contained in them, giving us an abridgement of the Law, the Gospel, and Means
of Salvation: which Precedent I have willingly followed, endeavoring to omit
nothing that is Necessary, and likewise to insert nothing but what is agreeable
to those holy Writings, and received by the Ancient, and present Orthodoxe
Churches

I have chosen such words, and expressions as are (for the most part) used in
Gods Word, and therefore of greatest significancy, and weight.

I hope the plenty of Quotations will not be accounted a superfluity, which I
added the more copiously, at first for my own, and now for the Readers
satisfaction. Better that of such there should be a redundance, then a defect,
and where they most abound, I conceive there is greatest need of them, as in
the 14th Proposition, where almost every word requires a several Testimony: in
this, and other places, the cited Texts may supply my very brief mention of
such weighty Mysteries, which in regard of their use, and importance, deserve
the ampler confirmation.

Controverted Points I have labored to express in temperate, and amicable
Terms, and to present the Truth with such indifferency, and moderation, as
might reconcile, rather then exasperate, disagreeing Parties.

To have severally expounded the Precepts of the Decalogue, would have been
inconsistent with the brevity here intended, therefore I have added one
Proposition (the 25th) as a general explication of all. So likewise concerning
the Creed, and Lords Prayer, I desired to mention that which might be some
explanation of them, yet very brief, and proportionable to the rest of the
sum.

Those Secrets of Gods unsearchable Decrees I have sparingly mentioned,
inculcating rather the Means which lead us to the best assurance, and
certainty here, and to a blessed fruition at last of eternal salvation.

Concerning Ministers I was willing to add the 34th Aphorism, specially for
the Peoples sake, who not considering the excelloncy of that sacred Office do
exceedingly offend God, and gratify their enemy, the Devil, some by Usurping,
most by Despising it: undervaluing one of the highest favors, and providence
of Christ toward his Church, for the building whereof and perfecting the
Saints, Ephesians 4. 12.
(as the Apostle affirms) they are peculiarly set, and assigned.

The Doctrines (and most of the Expressions also) being contained in the
Scriptures, I need not be solicitous to make an Apology, or give a further
account. Gods Truth, whether we receive, or reject it, still reteins the same
authority, and strength, and is (notwithstanding all our Opposition and
Differences) the perfect Rule by which we must now Judge, and hereafter be
judged: to which in this sum I only appeal, and refer both my self, and the
Reader.

I confess that what I here publish, is but small, yet I cannot say that my
labor, and study in composing it has been such also: for I think that with as
little pains I might have written a large volume. To make hard things plain, to
join brevity and perspicuity, and comprehend much in little, without detriment
to the sense and matter, to convey the highest things to low capacities, is a
matter of great Difficulty, and industry: the very attempt whereof I hope will
be favored, though I much fail in the performance. As I, so others making
experiment, will ( I believe) acknowledge the words, and Observation of a
Arch-Bp. of Armagh in a Sermon before K. James. 1624.
Person most eminent for piety and learning (who with others has encouraged me
to publish this Treatise) to be most certain, and true, that -- Try it when
ever we please, we shall find, that to lay this groundwork rightly, will put
us to the trial of our skill, and trouble us a great deal more, then if we
were to discuss a Controversy, or handle a subtle point in the Schools. Thus
He concerning the Difficulty of this Work, and that which he adds concerning
the Necessity also, is (in our careless days) to be sadly considered. The
neglecting hereof is the frustrating of the whole work of the Ministry: for
let us preach never so many Sermons to the people, our labor is but lost, as
long as the Foundation is unlaid, and the Principles untaught upon which all
other Doctrine must be builded.

The Consideration hereof has chiefly moved me to this labor, and my last
desire and advise to the Reader is, in the words of our Savior, Take heed that
you despise not little things, Matthew. 18. 10.
and intended chiefly for little ones: because, they are such without which
none can truly be Great, or Eternally glorious, and happy.

The Epitome, and Contents of this Sum, very fit and easy to be remembered.
THe only way to eternal happiness is taught in the Scriptures, which show
unto us, 1. The Nature and works of God. 2. The Misery of man by sin; 3. Our
Redemption and deliverance by Jesus Christ, of which we are made partakers by
Faith, joined with Repentance, and holiness of life. 4. Our Duty, to believe in
Jesus Christ. To show our faith by obedience to Gods Commandments. To use the
Sacraments, and constant Prayer. To confess, and forsake our sins. Continually
to give thanks, and praise unto God: which are the Means of Grace, leading
Gods people to eternal Glory.

2 Timothy 1. 13. Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou have heard of me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

The Chief Articles of Christian Belief, contained in the Scriptures, and
generally received by the Ancient and modern Churches of God, as does appear by
their joint Confessions.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth. And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate; was Crucified, dead, and
buried; he descended into Hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: he
ascended into Heaven, and sits on the Right hand of God the Father Almighty;
from thence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the
Holy Ghost: the holy Catholic Church: the Communion of Saints: the
forgiveness of sins: the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting.

The Ten Commandments.
GOD spoke all these words, 1 Table.
saying, I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Thou shall have no other Gods before me.

Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing
that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
water under the earth: thou shall not bow down thy self to them, nor serve
them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the
Fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me: and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
Commandments.

Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: six days shall thou labor, and do
all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it
thou shall not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant
nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that
in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day, and hallowed it.

Honor thy Father, 2 Table*
and thy Mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy
God gives thee.

Thou shall not kill.

Thou shall not commit adultery.

Thou shall not steal.

Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy neighbors
wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid servant, nor his ox nor his ass, nor
any thing that is thy neighbors.

The Lords Prayer.
OUR Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come: Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven: Give us this day our daily bread:
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us:
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil; For thine is the
Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever, Amen.

2 Timothy 2. 23. Foolish and unlearned Questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes.

Some special places of Scripture expressing the whole Duty of man.
So Worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in
the Law, Acts 24. 14, 15, 16.
and the Prophets. And have hope toward God, that there shall be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the un just. And herein do I
exercise my self, to have always a conscience void of offense, toward God,
and toward men.

The grace of God that brings Salvation has appeared to all men; Tit. 2. 1^.
12, 13, 14.
Teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed
hope* and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus
Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

Ye beloved building up your selves on your most holy faith, Jude 20. 21.
praying in the holy ghost, keep your selves in the love of God, looking for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

He has showed thee O man what is good, Mic. 6. 8.
and what does the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to Walk humbly with thy God

Trust in the Lord, Psa. 37. 3.
and do good, so shall thou dwell in the land.

Hold faith, and a good conscience, 1 Timothy 1. 19.
which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck.

This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
constantly, Tit. 3. 8.
that they which have believed in God, may be careful to maintein good works:
these things are good and profitable unto men.

Let ours also learn to maintein good works for necessary uses, 14.
that they be not unfruitful.

Add Colos. 1. 9. 10, 11, 12. Deuteronomy. 10. 12, 13. etc.

Let us hear the CONCLUSION of the whole matter, Eccles 12. 13, 14.
fear God and keep his Commandments: for this is the whole Duty of man. For God
shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing whether it be
good, or whether it be evil.

Io. 13. 17. If you know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
