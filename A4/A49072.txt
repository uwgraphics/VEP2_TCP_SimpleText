To the Alderman of the Ward of (...)
WHEREAS I have received a RULE, made Yesterday by His MAJESTY'S Court of
King's Bench, whereby (upon great Complaint made to the said Court, That Squibs
and Crackers are frequently thrown into Coaches passing the Streets of this
CITY, and great mischief thereby done;) It was Ordered, That Warrants be from
Me and my Brethren the Aldermen, Issued out to the several Constables of this
City, Requiring them to be and attend in the Streets (in their respective
Precincts) On the Nine and Twentieth of this instant October, and the Fifth of
November next, and the Fifteenth of the said Month of November, to hinder all
Persons from throwing Squibs and Crackers in the Streets, and to seize and
secure all such as shall presume to throw the same, and not to suffer any
Persons whatsoever, either on the Days aforesaid, or at any other Time or Times
hereafter, to Throw any Squibs and Crackers into any Coaches in the Streets,
but to take Care that all Persons may pass in Coaches quietly and securely
without harm or hindrance: And that all Citizens of this City be Aiding and
Assisting to the Constables in the Execution of their Office herein.

These are therefore in His MAJESTY'S Name straightly to Charge and Require
You, immediately to call before You all the several Constables within Your
Ward, and give them in strict Charge, That (as They will answer the Contrary at
their Perils) They be very careful and diligent to Observe and Execute the said
Order: And that They (in their own Persons) give their constant Attendance in
and about the Streets, within their respective Precincts, On the said Nine and
Twentieth of this Month, and the Fifth and Fifteenth of November next, and
there prevent all Throwing of Squibs, and Apprehend all Persons that shall
presume to do the same, and bring them before a Justice of the Peace within
this City, to be punished according to their Demerits. And that at all other
Times likewise, They be watchful to hinder the same; And wherever They shall
find any Offending herein, that They fail not to do their Duty in carrying Them
before a Justice of the Peace, as aforesaid. And all Citizens and Inhabitants
of this City are to Aid and Assist the Constables therein: And hereof I desire
You not to fail.

Dated the 25th day of October, 1684. Wagstaffe.
