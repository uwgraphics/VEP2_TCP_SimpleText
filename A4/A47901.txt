A Plea for limited Monarchy, as it was established in this Nation before the
late War. In an humble Address to his Excellency, General Monck.
SIR,
FInding, by several Letters, published in Your Name, that you profess a more
then ordinary zeal to popular Government; and not knowing any thing herein,
that can so mislead you, but the glorious pretense of a Free State (a notion,
which has, even, intoxicated many; (otherwise, great and worthy Persons;) I
held it my Duty, first, to acquaint you, how necessary it is to distinguish
betwixt the Form and Essence of a Commonwealth, the mistake whereof (each for
the other) has proved so fatal in our times: Next to examine, whether those
that surfeited of our Kingly Government, and longed for Novelty have not,
indeed (like the Dog in the faable) lost the substance of Liberty and
happiness, in pursuit of the shadow.

Our fierce Champions of a Free State will not, I presume, maintain, that it is
subject to no violations, least woeful experience confute, and force them to
confess, either that a Commonwealth may degenerate; or, at least, that this
never was a Commonwealth: And, as they must renounce their senses, so they must
deny the Faith of Story, which proves, that Republics have been sometimes
invaded with Usurpation, sometimes Debauched, and Embased with Oligarchy;
mostly (by reason of their weakness, and divisions) subdued, or forced to
truckle under their neighboring Princes) always tormented with faction.
Neither, indeed do they, themselves offer any argument but such, as, in effect,
beg the question, by presupposing great unity in the Coalition, great probity
in the Intention, and great purity in the Exercise; which doubtless, being
admitted, we should so little need to differ about Forms, that perhaps, we
should scarce need any Government at all. The stoutest assertors of Monarchy,
likewise, must acknowledge, That it, being but earthen ware, (though the finest
and strongest) is subject to diverse accidents; For nothing under heaven is
perfect: And when we constitute Governments, we must not think to build Babels
against the Deluge, but embank against floods and enclose the best we can
against Trespassours. This being premised, let us consider these two
Governments, not Metaphysically, in notions, abstracted from their subjects, (a
pastime, which our Platonicks much delight in) but morally and reasonably, as
concrete, and adapted to times, places, and persons, viz. our own.

I might, perhaps decide the question, in few words, by alleging the manifest
inclination of the whole people, now to Monarchy; For, As no man can be wronged
with his consent, so neither is any to be obliged against his will, And how
should a Government founded upon inequality and force, ever subsist without it?
Or a State, which is the mere Adjective of an Army, becomes a Substantive;
beginnings of this kind being so ominous? As reasonably might I object matter
of Title, and foreign pretense; For the same estate, with a flaw in the
Conveyance, or clogged with Statutes and Judgments, is not, surely, of like
value, as if it had descended clearly from the great Grandfather, and were free
both from Claims and Encumbrances; and one that has little, yet ows nothing,
is likelier to thrive then he, who owing vast sums (which he resolves never to
pay) dares not walk the streets for fear of Sergeants; But my intent, is only,
to show, that, our former Government (as it excellently complied with the Laws
Genius, and Interest of this Nation) so it comprehended all the benefits of a
Commonwealth, in great perfection; And this I shall do, as briefly, as I can.

To show how it complied with our Laws and Constitutions, let it suffice that
(Monarchy in these Nations, being more ancient then story or record, more
Venerable than Tradition it self) our Laws were (as it were) under that
Climate, habituated to that air and diet, grafted into that stock; and though
they have (God be thanked) forgot their Norman, yet they will hardly learn
Greek, much less, Vtopian: That, in the late Protectours times, our Lawyers
with one voice, importuned him, rather to assume the style and power of a King,
to which, they found all our Laws were shaped, then retain that of a
Protector, unknown to the Law: That nothing has rendered our Architectours of
a Common wealth more obnoxious, then that their infinite discords in other
things, generally, agreed in the necessity of subverting all our Fundamentals,
in order to their Design; which has likewise obliged all sober men, and true
Patriots (even the chiefest Pillars of the Parliaments Cause, in the late War)
to unite themselves, with the Royal Interest, as not enduring to hear of those
violent and dangerous alterations, which they see a Republic must introduce.

For its compliance with our Genius, consider, that as our English nature is
not like the French, supple to oppression, and apt to delight in that pomp and
magnificence of their Lords, which they know, is supported with their slavery
and hunger; Nor like the High-land Scots, where the honor and Interest of the
Chief is the glory of the whole Clan; so does it, as little or less, agree
with the Dutch humor, addicted only to Traffic, Navigation, Handy-crafts,
and fordid Thrift; and (in defiance of Herauldry) every man fancying his own
Scutcheon: Does not every one amongst us, that has the name of a Gentleman,
aim his utmost to uphold it? Every one that has not, to raise one? To this
end, do not our very Yeomen commonly leave their Lands to the eldest Son, and
to the others, nothing but a Flail or Plough? Did not every one, that had any
thing like an estate, pinch himself in his condition, to purchase a knighthood
or small Patent? What need further proof? Our late experience of that glympse
and shadow of Monarchy, (though in persons hated, and scorned, and upon a most
scandalous account) yet (for mere resemblance) admitted as tolerable, and in
respect of a Commonwealth, Courted, clearly evinces, how grateful the
substance would be to Englishmen.

For our Interest, briefly (to wave tedious and politic discourses,) certain
it is, that our Republic, (were it like to settle) would alarm all our
Neighbors, would make our best Allies, our bitterest enemies, and (upon
several accounts) probably draw upon us, the united forces of Christendom to
crush the Embrio. Which (the Nation being so weakened, and divided, as it is,)
must evidently endanger our total oppression, or at least, to bring in the
King by Conquest: Besides, by what Title shall we pretend to hold Scotland and
Ireland, since that of Descent is now avoided, and Consent we know there is
none, nor, indeed, can any be expected?

I come now to assert, that our former Government, eminently, included all the
perfections of a Free State, and was the Kernel, as it were, of a
Commonwealth, in the shell of Monarchy: First I will begin with the essential
parts of a Commonwealth, which are three, viz. The Senate proposing, the
People Resolving, the Magistrate Executing: For the Senate or Parliament, if,
ever there were a free, and honorable one, it was here; where the Deputies of
the whole Nation, most freely chosen, did, with like freedom, meet, propound,
debate and vote all matters of common Interest: No danger escaped their
Representing; no grievance, their complaint; no public right, their Claim; or
good, their Demand; In all which the least breach of Privilege was branded as
a civil sacrilege, And though there lay no Appeal to the dispersed body of the
People (a decision manifestly impracticable in Government, and sitter indeed
for Tribunes to move, then Nations to admit) yet (Elections being so popular,
and Assemblies frequent) the same end was attained with much more safety and
convenience. The Prince had, likewise (in effect) but an executive Power, which
he exercised by Ministers and Officers, not only sworn, but severely
accomptable: For though both he and the Lords had their Negatives in making
Laws; yet (no Tax being impossible, but by Consent of the Commons, nor any Law,
(without it) of such validity, that the Ministers of Justice durst enforce it;)
There was a wise and sweet necessity for the King, and likewise for the Lords
(who were but as a grain in the Royal Scale) to confirm all such Bills, as
were convenient for the People and not greatly hurtful to the Prince; and so
this Bugbear Negative, was resolved into a mere Target, to shelter and
preserve the Government from being altered, at the Will of the Commons, if, at
any time they should prove Factious: which (being in reason manifest) has been
also confirmed by great experience: Our Kings having, rarely, obstructed any
Bill, which they might safely grant; but on the other side, passed many high
Acts of mere Grace, circumscribing their Prerogative, and clipping its Wings;
nay, I could wish they had not peirced its bowels. This was that triple Cord,
which one would think, could not be broken; nor indeed, was it broken, but cut
asunder: This was our Gold, seven times refined; for every Bill, being thrice
read, debated and agreed, in either House, was at last, brought to the King,
for his Royal Assent, the Mint of our Laws: A trial so exact, that surely, no
dross could escape it; since all Interests must thereto concur (as truly, it
was but sit they should, in the establishment of that, which must bind them
all:) This was that Temperament, which poised our Humors, and at once, endued
us, with health, vigor and beauty; No Vote was precipitated, no Act was
huddled up; As by sad events, we have since seen, that, Power being engrossed
by one of the Estates, purged and modelled to the Interests of a faction; a
consequence natural to such premises: (As in a Balance consisting but of one
scale) nothing has been weighed, our laws have been Mandrakes of a Nights
growths, and our times as fickle as the weather or multitude.

The King indeed, had the Power of making War, but he had not the means; And
then, it signified no more, than giving him leave to fly, if he could get
wings; or to go beyond Sea, so he went without shipping: He had a Sword, but he
alone) could never draw it; for the Trained*Bands were a Weapon, which he
(decently) wore, but the Nation, only, could use: He chose his Ministers, (as
who does not his servants?) But alas, he was accomptable for them, to the
Trienniall Parliament, which none but the soundest Integrity could abide: He
could hinder the stroke of Justice with his Pardon (though still, the jaws not
being muzzled, it would bite terribly) but certainly, it was great wisdom,
rather, to give way; since (with his own scandal) he could afford offenders
but a lame and scurvy Protection; and since the Power of relieving his Wants
rested in the Commons, to balance his Will, and oblige him to a Correspondence
with Parliaments.

That his Person should be most Sacred, it was but needful; to avoid
circulation of account; reasonable, since it carries with it, the Consent of
Nations; Just, that he should not be the mere But of Faction and Malice, in
worse condition, than the basest of Vassals; Honorable, that the nakedness of
Government might not be daily uncovered; Wise, in the constitution, not at
once, to trust and provoke, by forcing him to shift for his own Indemnity, no
danger to the Public seeming (...) extreme, as the Outlawry of a Prince; no
task by daily experience so difficult, as the arraigning of any Power, whether
Regal or Popul^r; And since we make golden Bridges, for flying enemies, much
more may we afford them to relenting Sovereigns; (upon which account, in our
neighbor Kingdom of France, even Princes of the blood are not subjected to
capital Punishments;) Finally, very safe, in the consequent, for (being (by
the danger, threatening his corrupt Ministers) in all probability, stripped of
Agents) his personal impunity might, well, signify somewhat to himself, but
nothing to the People.

A Revenue he had, for the support of his State and Family, ample; for the
ordinary Protection of his People, sufficient; but for any undertaking,
defective; and for public oppression; so inconsiderable, that when Prerogative
was most Rampant, our greatest Princes (and some doubtless, we have had, the
most renowned Warriors of their Ages) could never prudently aspire to make
themselves sole Legislatours, nor presumed to maintain Red-coats in times of
Peace. If any object, (as some, concerned, are ready enough) that Kingly Power
could here, no longer, subsist, for want of Revenew; It is easily answered,
That a King of France, indeed, could not, and God forbid, he should; but a King
of England might, and (for ought I see) still may (the sale of Crown Lands,
which exceeded not the value of 100000 l. per annum, being, methinks, no matter
of utter ruin, but rather of easy compensation.) For the public Revenue was
proportioned to the maintenance of Courts, not Camps and Fleets; A Gentleman
of reasonable estate may live well on his Rents; But then, it is not
convenient, he should keep Wenches, or hangers on, nor build, nor study
Chemistry; In fine, the Revenue was very competent for ordinary disbursments,
as for extraordinary, if he resorted to Parliaments, the wiser he, the safer
and happier, we:

I desire all our Projectours of Commonwealths, to contrive greater freedom
for their Citizens, then is provided by Magna Charta, and the Petition of
Right; Or show us, that it is not much easier to violate, than to mend them:
For, thereby our Lives, Liberties, and estates were, under Monarchy secured,
and established, I think, as well as any thing, on this side Heaven: It were no
soloecisme to say, the Subject had his Prerogative as well, as the King; And,
sure I am, he was in as good (if not better) condition to maintain it, the
dependence being less on his side: Liberty was no less sacred than Majesty;
Noli me tangere, was likewise its Motto; And in case of any, the least
infringement (as escapes in Government may happen even in the most perfect;) It
was resented, as if the Nation had received a box on the Ear; If it be, as they
say, the glory of a Free State, to exalt, the scandal of Tyranny, to Embase
our Spirits; doubtless, this was our only Commonwealth: for, ever since, me
thinks, we have learned quietly to take the Bastonade.

I wish we now could, or could ever hope, under our Commonwealth (what ever
promises may be made us) so perfectly to distinguish the Legislative from the
Ministerial Authority, as once we did; when the House of Commons had not the
power of a Court Leet to give an Oath, nor of a Justice of the Peace, to make a
Mittimus: Which distinction, doubtless, is the most vital part of Freedom,
and far more considerable to poor Subjects (than the pretended Rotation; As on
the contrary, the confusion of them is an accomplishment of servitude; For
which the best Republics, I fear, have more to answer, than any limited Prince
can have; Certain it is, that as our King in his personal capacity, made no
Laws, so neither did he, by himself, execute or interpret any: No Judge took
notice of his single Command, to justify any Trespass; no, not so much, as the
breaking of an Hedge; his Power limited by his Justice, he was (equally with
the meanest of his Subjects) concerned in that honest Maxim, We may do just so
much and no more, than we have right to do; And it was most properly said, He
could do no wrong; because if it were wrong, he did it not, he could not do it;
It was void in the act, punishable in his agent. His Officers, as they were
alike liable, so perhaps, they were more obnoxious to Indictments and suits,
than any other, by how much their trespass s^emed to be of a higher nature,
and gave greater alarm: His private Will could not countermand his Public; his
Privy seal, ever buckled to the great Seal, as being the Nations, more than
his; his Order superseded no Process, and his displeasure threatened no man
with an hours imprisonment, after the return of H^beas Cor^us: An Under Sheriff
was more terrible, a Constable more saucy, a Bailiff more troublesome than he:
And yet, by his gentle Authority, this Scabbard of Prerogative (as some in
derision, have called it) which (if it would) could scarce oppress an Orphan^;
Tumult was curbed, Faction moderated, Usurpation forestalled, Intervales
prevented, Perpetuities obviated, Equity administered, Clemency exalted, and the
people made, only nice and wanton with their happiness, as appears by their
(now so impatient) calling for that Mannah, which they so causelessely) loathed.

To Conclude, what shall I add? The Act, enjoining the Keepers of the great
Seal, under pain of High Treason, to summon a Triennial Parliament, of course,
by virtue of the Act, without further Warrant; The Act, forbidding the Privy
Council, under like penalty, to intermeddle with Meum and Tuum, the Laws
abolished the Star Chamber, High Commission, etc. branding all past, and
bridling all future enormities; the Statutes limiting the Kings Claims, and
relieving his Tenants from exaction of Forfeitures; Besides many other
principal immunities, wherewith (by the special favor of God, and bounty of
our Princes) we were blessed, far beyond any of our Neighbors; Above all, our
assurance, that we might readily, have obtained such further addition and
perfection of Liberty (if, yet, any such, there were) as would consist with
modesty, or liberty it self to ask: Do they not, aloud, proclaim, that we were
then, the mirror of Governments, envy of Monarchies, and shame of
Commonwealths; who could not but blush, to see themselves so ecclipsed and
silenced, in all their pretenses to Freedom? Do they not more than justify my
Assertion, That with all the Ornaments of the noblest Kingdom, we had likewise,
all the enjoyments of the Freest State.


FINIS.
