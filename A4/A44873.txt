A Hue-and-Cry after Morgan Hews Post-man in Southwa^k: Or, a Full and True
ACCOUNT Of his Breaking open a Letter, supposing there had been Chequer bills
for money, and it proved a bond to be put in sut.
As also of his borrowing a considerable sum of money of several People.
Licensed according to Order.



IN all past Ages, none has, nor does Produce more wickedness, than this we now
live in, and wherein the Delusion of the Devil has greater Power than ever as
is made, not only appearent in self murder, but in tempting men to act those
Villanis, that proves their utter Overthrow.

On Wednesday the 17 th. of June l^st 1^99 One Morgan Hews Post-man in
Southwark who lived well, and in Crediet among his Brethren, who was so well
opinionated (...), that he was more than ordinarily entrusted by them; but in
the conclusion, finding one Letter in his Packet more weighty than any of the
rest, attempted to break i^ open, in hopes of a Booty, but finding it not
answering his Expectation, was so concerned at the Fact, that he immediately
Contrives how he might make provision for a Subsistence for his F^mi^y;
concluding he should be turned out of his Place, wherein he got a sufficient
Competency: Whereupon he takes a Cellar and fitted it up, (as he reported to
Sell Crabs; whereupon he was resolved to try his Crediet among his friends, and
Acquaintance, before the Fact came out, or was discove^'d: And First she goes
to a Coale-Marchant and gets Twenty Chalder of Coals upon Crediet, and
afterward borrows Money of several Pelsons upon the same Account, to a
Considerable Sum; and where he borrowed a Shilling he might have had Twenty his
Crediet was so great, and he so well beloved: For several that had but Twenty
Shillings, would let him have Te^n of them.

This was the Sheep in Wolfes Clothing, as there is among all Sects; he has
made the Old Preverb true, or he did at least belive, that a Hot Sumer
produces a Cold Winter: So he resolved his Family should not want firing, in
the Conclusion, having by his cuning Insuared Grasped all he could, he is gone
off leaving his Creditors to look Apa^master, and the twenty Chalder of Coals
with his Wife, for Antidote against a Cold Winter.
