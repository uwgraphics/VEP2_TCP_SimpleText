IN the days of TIBERIUS CAESAR the Emperor, Publius Lentulus being at that
time President in Judea, wrote an Epistle to the Senate of Rome, the words
whereof were tbese, as follows,

THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD JESUS CHRIST
Psalm 45.2. Fairer then the Children of men



THere appeared in these our days a Man of great virtue, called JESUS CHRIST,
who is yet living amongst us, and of the People is accepted for a Prophet, but
his own Disciples call him the Son of God.

He raises the Dead and cures all manner of Diseases, a Man of stature
somewhat Tall and Comely, with a very reverend Countenence, such as the
beholders may both Love and Fear,his Hair of the color of a Chestnut full
ripe, and plain almost down to his ears, but from the ears downward somewhat
curled, and more orient of color waving about his Shoulders.

In the midst of his Head goes a seam or partition of his Hair, after the
manner of the Nazarites; his Forehead very plain and smooth; his Face without
spot or wrinckle, beautified with a comely red; his Nose and Mouth so formed as
nothing can be reprehended; his Beard somewhat thick, agreeable in color to the
Hair of his Head not of any great length, but forked in the midst; of an
innocent look; his Eyes gray, clear, and quick.

In reproving he is severe, in admonishing courteous, and fair-spoken, pleasant
in speech mixed with gravity.

It cannot be remembered that any have seen him laugh, but many have seen him
weep: in proportion of Body well shaped and straight, his Hands and Arms very
delectable to behold; in speaking, very temperate, modest, and wise.

A Man for his singular beauty surpassing the Children of Men.

LONDON, Printed for Francis Smith at the Elephant and Castle near the Royal
Exchange in Cornhil.
