A friendly Caveat To all true Christians, Showing them the true way to Heaven.
To the Tune of, the Ladies fall.




NOw that the day star does appear
to God devoutly let us call
That in the deeds of day light clear
he would keep us from misfortunes all.
Let him temper our tatling tongue
and bridle so our will,
Lest horror vile brake us among,
and strife that sounds full ill.
Let all the secrets of our hearts
be clean from filthiness,
Let slothful sluggishness depart
from us that study do profess.
Let mean diet of drink and meat
beat down the pride of flesh,
Lest raging in that filthy heat
it loose of youth the flowers fresh
Take not in vain Gods holy name
but use it with reverence,
For why the Lord all such do blame
as here commit offense.
Remember that thou holy keep
the day of Rest as God does will,
Six days thou shall apply thy work
but rest the seventh day still.
For in six days the Lord did frame
the Heaven, the Earth, the Creatures,
The seventh he ceast and blessed the same
as time for us on him to call,
All these precepts the Lord did write
in the first table made of stone
And left for us both night and day,
his ways to think upon.




THe second table follows then
whherein the Lord instructs us
How to behave our selves always
and the same is written thus.
Unto thy Parents honor give
as God commands thee.
That thou long days and good may live
in Heaven thy place shall be:
Murder no man by word nor deed
with Sword or other thing
Do naught from whence hate may proceed,
for murder out of heat does spring,
Avoid all foul adultery
and all that their belong,
All filthy thoughts and lusts of eye,
all unchaste talk of tongue.
Take not by fraud nor yet by stealth
the things that others possess,
For so to take what is not thine
it it is great wickedness
Against no man false witness be
but spoke the truth always,
For God thy secret thoughts no see
and will judge thee at the last day.
Thou shall not in thy heart desire
to have thy Neighbors wife,
His house nor Land do not require
nor between them breed no strife.
Be not desirous to reserve
his ox, his horse, or beast
That he is not willing to leave*
or what he does possessed.
In vain take not the name of God,
swear not by he nor she,
The house with plagues is threatened
where oaths much used be.
Think on the poor in their distress,
and God will send thee store,
The widow and the fatherless
see you feed at your door.
Regard the cries of Englands wrong,
turn not thy face away,
Bear not a proud and lofty mind
for that will thee decay.
These be the laws that God did give
to Jacobs feed in wilderness,
And let us follow them always
we may his Land possess.
But such as will his laws neglect
and walk after fleshly desire,
The Lord at last he will them put
into eternal fire.
From which the Lord deliver us
and all that trust in thee.
That when we do depart this world
in heaven our place may be.
