A REMONSTRANCE From his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, AND THE ARMY under his
Command.
WHen (by the blessing of God upon the endeavors of this Army and other Forces
of the Parliament) the adverse Forces and Garrisons within this Kingdom were
dissipated and reduced, a present quiet and freedom of trade, and all commerce
and bussinesse restored to all parts of the Kingdom and an hopeful way made
for settling of a sound and lasting peace, on good terms, for the interest of
the Kingdom; instead of the hoped fruit of our labors and hazzards, and of
the Kingdoms vast expense (in the dispensing of justice and righteousness and
the settling and upholding of common right and Freedom to the Subjects of this
Nation) we found immediately the cross workings of a strong and prevalent
Party in the Parliament and Kingdom, who (walking under the mask of the
Parliaments friends, but being in truth men of corrupt and private ends and
interests, different from, and destructive to the real and common interest of
the Kingdom) made use of their power to obstruct and pervert justice, to
injure, oppress, and crush the peaceable and well-affected people of the
Kingdom, to abridge and overthrow all just Freedom and Liberty, and drive on
designs to set up a party and faction in the Parliament and Kingdom, and (by
the advantage of a perpetual Parliament) to domineere over, and inslave the
kingdom to posterity: And for that end, to make such a peace with the king, if
any, as without any just provision for the common and true interest of the
People, and the security thereof for future, would serve only to make up and
establish their own greatness, and the affected domination of themselves and
their party over all others.

To all which ends (as before this Parliament) the ignominous names of Puritan
and Nonconformist, and the specious pretenses for settling of Order, Decency,
and Uniformity in Religion* were made use of, to the prejudice, trouble, and
suppressing of all that appeared, either for the truth and power of Religion,
or for the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and toward the advancing at
once, both of an Ecclesistical and civil Tyranny, so,) this generation of men,
in the application of the Parliaments power, (succeeding the former in the
exercise of the Kings) have made use of the odious names of Brownists,
Anabaptists, Independents, Heretics, Schismatics, or Sectaries of one sort or
other, to blast such men, in whom the truth and power of Religion, or a just
sense of the common Interest of the kingdom has appeared; and have held forth
the pretenses of Reformation and Uniformity, to color and counte^ance their
designs of setting up their own irreligious, or Pharisaicall and domineering
Faction, to the oppression of all other people: and herein they have had a
great advantage to further their aforesaid designs, by reason of the jealousies
which many co^scientious men of the Presbyterian judgments have entertained
concerning this Army, and concerning diverse other eminent and worthy
instruments of the Kingdoms good (being in places of publik trust and power)
were supposed to be of the independent way

In pursuance of their aforesaid disignes, they indevoured, and by their power
and influence upon the Parliament, and the advantage of such pretenses as
aforesaid, very much prevailed to put out of all places of power or public
trust the most sober and tonscientious men, and such as had approved themselves
faithful to the pub^ike interest throughout all the late troubles, and to put
in debauched and dissolute men, or such as would for advantage serve their
private interests, and for that end (in cases where they ^ould not otherwise
prevail) procured such Garrisons to be slighted, such powers to be recalled,
(though more necessary to have been continued) which they found in the hands of
Persons of the former sort. and such to be continued (though less necessary)
as they found in the hands of the later: And, the better to strengthen
themselves in their Designs, closing with a very powerful party in the City
of London, they first with much activity endeavored, and prevailed to
new-modell the Common Council and form the fame to their own Party; and then
stirred them up to a Petition (amongst other things concurrent to their ends,)
for the alteration of the City Militia, who by their continual violent, and
pressing importunity at the Parliaments doors, wrung from the Parliament an
Ordinance for that purpose, whereby they procured the power of that Militia,
the special influence whereof upon the City and Kingdom, and upon the
Parliament it self, being the only guard they had for their safe sitting) is
evident to all men,) to be taken out of those hands in which it had been
continued without prejudice, and with great and known security and advantage
both to the Parliament, City and Kingdom, throughout the late troubles, add
this without any exception either then or since made against them, and to be
put into the hands of such others, as were (at best) of doubtful affections to
the interest of the Parliament and Kingdom: but indeed men given up and
engaged to the Private interests and designs of the said factious party, as
has since 'too evidently appeared, and as in the late Declaration of the Army
concerning the grounds of our advance toward London, is more fully
remonstrated. And (finding this Army not for their turns) they made it their
main work to disband or break it in pleces, even before the relief of Ireland
was provided for, or the peace of this Kingdom settled. And though all this
went under the pre^ence of easing the present burdens of the Kingdom, yet at
the same time they designed and went about to put the Kingdom to the expense
and trouble of raising and forming a new force (under pretense, as for the
service of Ireland) but evidently designned and so fra^ed as to serve their own
ends and purposes aforesaid in England: and (being many of them filled and
acted with personal ^nvy, and others with malignity of Principles and interest
against this Army, and the work of God by it) it would not serve their turns to
break or disband it, but it must be with all possible dshonour, injury,
oppression, and provocation that they could put upon it. And it was too
evident, that their endeavor was not only to put it off without the honor or
satisfaction due to it for the service it had done, but to disband it on such
terms as to subject and expose all (and even the most faithful) servants of
the Parliament and Kingdom, both in the Army, and elsewhere, unto oppression
or undoing, or to the mercy of their own and such other men's malicious and
invenomed spirits which could promise no better. For the more full and
particular demonstration of all which we refer all knowing men to the
practices and proceedings against this Army, unto the times by their
procurement) appointed for the disbanding of it in several parts, without just
and equal satisfaction, which have been in part remonstrated in Papers sent
from this Army, and published before our coming up to S. Albans.

Upon consideration of all this, and upon the resolutions, (which their own
abuses and provocations, put upon the Army, had raised in the whole body of it)
not to disband without further satisfaction and security from the like abuses
in future* we did in our Representation or Declaration sent from S. Albans.
express in general what things we desired (besides our concernments as
Soldiers) to see done or provided for before our disbanding, for settling the
peace of the Kingdom, and securing the Common Rights and Liberties thereof,
which we were called out to defend and vindicate, and had so long sought for;
and having (therewithal) impeached several Members of the Horse of Commons
for their unjust practices and designs, to such purposes as are before
expressed, and for endeavoring in prosecution thereof to engage this Kingdom
in a new war; we added some further Desires for prevention of that mischief
of a new war to the Kingdom, and for our own present security from
immediate ruin, while those other things might be treated on or considered.
And upon the granting of some of them in part, and hopes given of some others,
though we could not obtain the rest, and especially, not that which we hold
most just equal, and necessary, viz. The positive suspension of those
impeached Members from sitting in the House as Judges in their own cause, and
from their power in Committees, whereby they had the advantage to raise War
against us, and to make new disturbances, in the Kingdom, yet the said
impeached Members pretending to withdraw themselves from the Parliament until
their causes should be heard and tried and the House giving con^ thereunto we
out of our tenderness to Parliament Privileges, and our earnest desires to
yield all observance ^o the Parliament, and satisfaction to the City (who
pretended a full concurrence with us in ou^ declare^ desires ^or settling the
peace and Liberties of the Kingdom) did at the Parliaments command and the
Cities request withdraw the Army to the desired distance from London, and
dispersed it further to several parts of the Kingdom for the ease of the
Country, and proceeded in a peaceable and regular way* to prepare and present
more particular Charges against the said impeached Members, which within a few
days after we accordingly sent up to the House: And the said impeached
Members, (having put in a delatorie answer thereto with a plea and Demurrer to
diverse particulars therein) pretended that (to avoid any disturbance or
interruption to the present proceedings for settling the public affairs by
the interposall of their private cause*) they desired leave and Passes to
travel for some months, which accordingly the Speaker of the House of Commons
was ordered or authorized to give them, and we (presuming on the Houses caution
for their forthcoming to be tried when the affairs of the Kingdom were
settled, which upon their first motion of withdrawing we had insisted on,) did
not gainsay, and thereupon we proceeded in a quiet and hopeful way to prepare
more particular Proposalls in pursuance of our former general desires, for the
present settling of the peace of the Kingdom to be tendered to the Commissioners
of Parliament residing with the Army for that purpose: But finding that while
we were thus peaceably proceeding, the said ^peached Members (notwithstanding
their pretended desires to travel) did continue in, and about London, very
active and busy to raise war, or make disturbance in the Kingdom. And that
the Committee of Militia there, did comply with them therein by daily listing
of men, and other preparations toward war, and sheltering to that end, yea,
and entertaining into service, those same Reformadoes, who (by Ordinance of
Parliament) were by them to have been put out of the Lines of Communication,
and finding continual jealousies and disturbances to our said proceedings bred
in the Army by the daily reports and alarums thereof from the City, we made a
particular address to the Parliament for the restoring of the City- Militia
into those hands in which it was before the Ordinance of the fourteenth of May,
last; or last: For the reasonableness of our Desires wherein (supposing that we
had such cause to insist on some removal of that power out of the hands into
which it was then put up (as here before is partly expressed* and in our late
Declaration is more fully set forth) we dare confidently appeal to all men (not
engaged against us) whether, for the present safety and quiet of the City upon
such a change, and to prevent those dangers or disturbances to or in the City,
which the want of a Militia during the interval (betwixt the ceasing of one and
new forming of another) might give occasion and advantage unto (especially in
such a juncture of affairs) there could be any other way so expedient, as to
render that change, but an immediate reverting into those hands in which it was
so lately before (who would make up a Militia ready formed to succeed
immediately in place of the other, without any considerable intermission or
delay) and whether at a time when Jealousies and Distrusts were both so rife
and hurtful (as they might occasion no less distraction or interruption to any
quiet settlement or proceedings thereunto, then real attempts of mischief
would) there could be any proposal more reasonable or hopeful to beget a
confidence and acquiescence (as to that point) both in the Parliament, City and
Army, then to have that Power restored (for the present) into those hands, of
whose Fidelity to the Common Interest, we had all found so ample and
unquestioned proof throughout the most dangerous Times.

Upon our Address therefore to the Parliament for that purpose (the Army being
at such distance as aforesaid) both Houses were pleased, on the 23. of July
last, to pass an Ordinance for returning of the Militia into those hands, and
repealing the Ordinance of the 4. of May, by which it had heen changed as
before.

Hereupon, hoping all would quietly succeed to a settlement in this Kingdom,
we went on securely to finish our Proposals for that purpose (the Heads whereof
have been since published) withdrew the Head-quarter to a farther distance,
dispersed the Army to larger Quarters, for more ease to the Country; And upon
a Recommendation of the business of Ireland from the Parl. we had, in less
then a weeks space, prepared and ordered a considerable force (no less then
4000. horse and foot, as Sir Thomas Temple employed from the Parliament about
that business to us can testify) for a present relief thereunto: But the
restless and treacherous malice of the enemies to our and the Kingdoms peace
(taking their supposed advantage of our distance, and dispersed posture (which
their fair pretense of peaceable intentions had induced us into) first, they
did without all color of authority, contrive and set on foot in the City, and
many of them entered into a mischievous and desperate vow and engagement,
tending to the subversion of the freedom of Parliament, and the liberties of
this Nation, to the frustrating of those just and public ends, for which so
much blood and treasure has been spilt, and spent, in the late Wars, and to
the rising of a new War against the Parliament and their Army (which said
engagement both Houses of Parliament, did by their Declaration of the 23. of
July adjudge and declare to be high Treason in all that should promote or abet
the same; and within a few days after (to wit, on Monday, July 26.) there was
a Petition brought to the Parliament, by the Sheriffs, and some Aldermen, and
Common-councell-men, in the name of the City of London, for the recalling of
the said Ordinance of the 23. of July, concerning the Militia, and the
returning of the Militia into those hands, in which it was put by the Ordinance
of the 4. of May, which Petition was immediately followed and backed with a
tumultuous confluence of Apprentices, and other dissolute and desperate
persons, who committed most horrid and unheard of violence upon both Houses,
enforcing them to recall both the said Declaration of the three and twenty day
of July (concerthe said engagement.) And also the said Ordinance of the same
date, concerning the Militia, and compelling the Speaker of the House of
Commons to resume the Chair, after the House was adjourned, and the House to
pass such further Votes concerning the Kings present coming to London, etc.
as they the said Rioters did please, neither the Guard from the City, that then
attended the Houses, nor the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, or any Authority in the
City (though sent to for that purpose) taking any course to suppress the said
tumult, or relieve the Parliament against that violence, though it was
continued for the space of eight or ten hours.

And the Houses having next day adjourned till Friday, July 30. There were
Printed Ticekts fixed upon posts, in and about the City the day before,
inviting the same persons to the like confluence at Westminster, against the
Houses next meeting. All which has been more fully and more assuredly made
known, by the Declaration of the Speaker of the House of Commons concerning the
same.

By this means the Speakers of both Houses, together with most of the Lords,
and a very great number of the most faithful and unquestioned Members of the
House of Commons, were driven away, so as they could not with safety attend
their service in Parliament, nor with freedom discharge their trust to the
Kingdom therein, but were forced to fly to their Army for safety, so as there
was not, nor could then be, any free meeting or legal proceeding of a
Parliament. Notwithstanding which diverse Members of both Houses, (who by the
carriage and sequel of the business, will appear to be of the same party and
confederacy with the aforesaid Enemies to our and the Kingdoms Peace, and with
the Authors and Actors both of the said treasonable engagement, and the
tumultuous force upon the Parliament.) Taking this opportunity of time, to
carry on their designs, when very few were left, but of their own party, did
continue to meet in the usual places in Westminster. And (having under
pretense of a necessity for continuing the Parliament, by adjournment, drawn
in some few well-minded Members to sit with them, out of a seruple least the
Parliament should fall for want of adjournment) took upon them the name of
both Houses of Parliament.

And having on Friday, July 30. chosen a new Speaker, did proceed to Vote and
Act as a Parliament, and adjourned from time to time; But of what party and
confederacy the most of them were, and to what ends and interests they acted,
will appear by what they did, whereof we shall for present give a taste in
some particulars, hoping that shortly the whose Journall of their proceedings
may be made public.

For, the said Members of the House of Commons (conveening as aforesaid)
immediately Voted and called in (as to the service of the House) the Eleven
impeached Members. And also those who upon former Votes of the House were
suspended or under question to be put out for Delinquency, and had put in their
cales; with this pretended House of Commons thus composed, and four or five
Lords of the same Model (for an house of Peers) they proceed to set up a
Committee for safety* (whereof all or most of the said Impeached Members were a
part) this Committee they appointed to join with that same pretended Committee
of the City Militia, whose power was obtained only by the tumultuous force and
violence aforesaid: To these Committees the most or many of their proceedings
refer, and by diverse pretended Vot^s, Orders and Ordinances, procured in the
name of one or both Houses of Parliament, large powers were given to these two
Committees for raising of Forces, appointing chief Commanders* and other
Officers; and other vast, unlimited, or unusual powers were given them, all
tending to the raising and levying of a new War within this Kingdom; upon
which many forces both of Horse and Foot, were actually levied, and other
preparations of War made; All which, that they were intended and designed in
Justification, prosecution, and maintenance of the aforesaid treasonable
engagement, and of the said force and violence done to the Parliament, or of
the vere same ends and interests, and to oppose and hinder the restitution of
the Houses of Parliament, to their honor and freedom, and the advance of this
their Army for that purpose, being then upon a March. Besides the consideration
of the persons into whose hands these powers were committed. It is abundantly
evident many other ways, but especially by that Declaration of the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Commoncouncell of London, which was first, by that pretended
Committee of safety, Ordered, and then by the pretended House (without reading
a word of it) approved to be published in the Parish Churches, with an
exhortation to the people to take up Arms, in maintenance of the ends therein
expressed, which (though the pretense were for the Defense of the King,
Parliament and City, then alleged to be in great danger, (when as indeed none
were in danger, but only the Authors, Acters, and Abe^tors of the traitorous
practices aforesaid, yet) the true ends thereof appear clearly to be the same
with the said treasonable Engagement, and tumult against the Parliament, all of
them concerning (as in other things, so especially in this) viz* To have the
King brought up to London without delay, or any nearer approach of the Army.
And to al these, the succeeding votes of the pretended Houses, for the same
thing did speedily e^cho the same note: Concerning which matter (not to examine
what al^eration of the case, since both Houses, and both Kingdoms also (of
England and Scotland) resolved, that it was not safe, the King should come to
London, until he had given satisfaction and security to his people, in relation
to those public ends for which so much blood and treasure had been spent) we
shall only say thus much to these men's intentions and designs in the
business. That had the King come up to London, (as they have so often desired
and attempted) it is apparent they intended and would have made use of it,
rather to lay the stronger foundations of a new war (upon the ruins of that
public interest contended for in the former, and of all those that had with
most candor, clearness, and simplicity of heart, appeared and acted for the
same) then any way to settle thereby a safe and well grounded Peace. And since
they could not rationally expect so easy an obtaining of the Kings Person to
London upon such a pretended Vote or Declaration of their desire thereof, it is
as evident that they could intend nothing thereby, but a more plausible
pretense, and foundation of quarrel against this Army, whereby to engage or
incline to their assistance the Kings party, and such others, who might be
caught with the apprehension thereof, as a speedy way to Peace (the thing so
generally longed for) and by such assistance gained the better to ruin this
Army, and those faithful Members of Parliament, who were retired to it. For our
parts we shall rejoice as much as any, to see the King brought back to his
Parliament (and that) not so much in place, as in affection and agreement on
such sound terms and grounds, as may render both Him and the Kingdom, safe,
quiet, and happy, and shall be as ready as any to bring his Majesty to London,
when his being there may be likely to produce (not greater disturbances, but) a
Peace indeed. And that such as may not (with the shipwreck of the public
interest) be shaped and molded only to the private advantages of a particular
party or Faction. But bottomed chiefly on grounds of common and public
welfare and security. And if (without regard to these considerations) we would
have brought his Majesty with us to London in our late advance t^ither (which
our enemies could not hinder or prejudice us in) we had no cause to doubt, but
(as to men) we might have had all the advantages which our adversaries promised
to themselves, thereby added to the strength and interest of the Army, and have
inverted the disadvantages upon them that they intended against us thereby; So
as his Majesty's so much deared coming to London might have been much to their
prejudice, and our advantage and security, if we had regarded only our own
particulars.

But (as at present out consciences bear clear witnesses to our selves, so)
we hope God will in the issue make* it clear to others, that we have not
minded, nor been acting our own work or interests, but the Kingdoms, and
every honest man's in it. Mean while (to return to our purpose) we think it
is sufficiently cleared, That the proceedings of those Members or the Major
part of them (that continued to sit at Westminster during the absence of the
Speakers) the Powers by them given, the Forces thereupon levied, and other
preparations of War thereupon made, were all designed and driven on, in
prosecution and maintenance of the said treasonable engagement, and of the
force done upon the Parliament, or for the same ends and interest with them,
and to oppose the advance of this Army toward London, for restitution of the
Parliament to honor and freedom, and indeed to raise a new war in the
Kingdom against the Parliament and their Army for the destruction thereof. And
the same may (yet further) appear by this that those very Apprentices,
Reformadoes and others about the City who were the chief actors in the said
engagement and tumult, were afterward most trusted and employed, and most
active in their preparations for War.

By what we have here said, and what has been declared and published from us,
and from the Speakers, and aforesaid Members of both Houses, and by the whole
series of our own, and our enemies actions and carriages (compared together) it
may appear how tender we have been not only of the Authority and just
privileges of Parliament, and of the safety, Peace and welfare both of the
Kingdom and the City, but even toward those our enemies themsel^es (seeking
only things necessary for the common good of the whole (and that if possible)
without ruin or hurt to any, and yet how maliciously and unworthily we have
that while been dealt withal by those our enemies, and by a factious and
Powerful party (especially) in the Parliament and City combining with them:
And what clear cause we have had both for all that we have formerly desired or
done in prevention of our own ruin and the Kingdoms disturbance, and also
what just grounds for our late advance to London. The good service whereof
(especially) in restoring the Parliament to a condition of safety, honor and
freedom, thereby has been (without any seeking of ours) acknowledged by both
Houses with thanks to us, and public thanksgiving to the Almighty for it: And
a further trust has been thereupon committed to the General for taking care
with his Army to safeguard the Parliament.

The Houses being thus restored to a condition of present safety, Honor and
Freedom: Two things seem clearly remaining to be done (which our own and most
men's expectations are most set upon) viz.

First, to Vindicate the Honor, Freedom, and safety of Parliament from the
like affronts and violences in Future, and the Army and Kingdom from danger of
the like disturbances (whilst things shall be in a debate or treaty for a
settlement) and then to proceed unto a speedy settlement of the Peace of the
Kingdom.

The latter of these is, first in our intentions (being nearest to the ultimate
end.) And we shall earnestly desire that in order thereunto, The proposals of
the Army (whereof the heads are published) may be speedily considered and
brought to a Resolution. But considering that the debates of them may take up
some time ere they be agreed o all hands, and the framing of them into Bills,
and perfecting of the same will require much more. Something must first be done
in the former for a present security to the Parliament from like affronts or
violence, and to the Army and Kingdom from the like disturbances to the Peace
thereof by any farther advantage which the time like to be spent in the settling
of Peace, may afford to our watchful, restless, and (we doubt) implacable
enemies.

First, therefore to these ends (unless it should be thought fit to secure the
Parliament by keeping the whole body of the Army, or so great a part thereof,
to remain continually in and about London, as might be sure to overpower any
future tumults or force that may arise out of the City, which* neither the
welfare of the City and ease of the parts adjacent, nor the safety of the
Kingdom, in respect of the present posture of affairs will admit.)

It is absolutely necessary that there be speedy and exemplary justice done
upon (at least) the chief Authors or abettors of the said treasonable
engagement, and of the said force done to the Parliament, and upon the chief
Actors, in maintenance and prosecution thereof (whereby men may be deterred
from the like in future.

And this is also as necessary to the security of the Army, and Peace of the
Kingdom, since it is apparent by all that has been said, and by infinite
other evidences (too many to recount.) That both the said engagement and the
force done to the Parliament, and the power of the City militia thereby gained,
and the succeeding Votes and orders of the pretended Houses, (but indeed of
that faction that are our professed enemies) in maintenance and prosecution
thereof, and the Forces thereupon leavyed (put under the Command of Major
General Massey, and others our professed adversaries) were all designed and
directed to the ruin and destruction of this Army, and the raising of a new
War against us in this Kingdom. And having had such experience of their
restless malice and cruel intentions toward us, (notwithstanding our
tenderness and lenity toward them) and of their treacherous dealing (so soon
as they thought they had the advantage) notwithstanding all their semblances of
compliance to a composure. What reason is there to expect, but that by our
patience and delays, they apprehend in future the like or other advantage,
they will break out again into the like or worse attempts of violence and
War, if all escape with impunity for these.

But as to this point of security by exemplary Justice in an ordinary way, we
see our hopes almost frustrated, whilst, (though our desires and resolutions
to that purpose, expressed in our late Declaration of our advance toward London,
were then seconded with the declared approbation and concurrent resolutions of
the Speakers and Members of both Houses, that were driven away to the Army, and
with their engagement to live and die with us therein. And though in pursuance
thereof, the Right Honorable House of Peers, have since their restitution,
begun and proceeded to declare null and void, all that was done in the name of
both Houses, while they lay under the power of that tumultuous violence; and to
give their more authentic approbation to our said Declaration, made in behalf
of the said Speakers and Members, while they were with the Army: and in behalf
of the honor and freedom of the Parliament, and to give their like
approbation to the concurrent Declaration and Engagement of the said Speakers
and Members, made to us while they were with us, yet) the House of Commons has
not only not concurred with the Lords in any of those things, but rather seem
to have cast them aside. And upon the Question concerning those very Votes of
the said 26th of July. To which the Houses were by the said violence enforced
[whether they should b^ declare^ Null and void] it was carried in the Negative,
That the Question should not be put, by the consequences whereof, (which are
many ways very sad, this poor Kingdom, and more then we can recompt) and by
all subsequent proceedings in that House, in relation to the whole business, we
clearly find, That the Members of that house, who (after the violence done to
it, and during the absence of the Speaker, and the other Members thereby driven
away) proceeding in the name of that House as aforesaid, procured the pretended
powers, and did make the pretended Votes, Orders, and Ordinances
aforementioned; and many of them were the Factors thereupon for the leavying of
War, in prosecution and maintenance of the aforesaid treasonable engagement,
and force done to the Parliament, and for the opposing, resisting, and
destroying of this the Parliaments Army in its advance to London, for the
restitution of the Parliament to its honor and freedom, being conscious of
their own guilt and danger thereby; yet presuming on their interest in the
House, and the patience and lenity of this Army do continue and intrude
themselves, and to sit and vote there, and by their present interest in the
House do use their utmost endeavors, and very much prevail to obstruct and
avoid the bringing of any to Justice, who have acted under their pretended
Authority, (knowing it to be their own case and concernment in point of
impunity, as well as conducency to their faction and interest) And for that
cause they labor (as for life) to uphold the things past and done, and the
Authorities given by them and their Faction (in their and the Apprentices
pretended Parliament) yea, even those very Votes and Authorities, wrested from
the Parliament, by that palpable force of July the 26th, to be good and valid
until they be repealed (as if past in a free and legal Parliament;) in which
Point, and all Questions touching upon it, we find they presume upon, and are
strengthened by the concurrence of diverse other Members, who having (perhaps
with harmless intentions) continued to sit with them during the Speakers
absence, as aforesaid (though they consented not to any of their mischievous
Votes and Orders, or treasonable proceedings before mentioned) may yet fear
themselves to be involved in the same case and danger by having sat with them*
And thus by the concurrence of these two parties in the House (as to that
point) and the interest which both those parties have with others in the House
(especially upon a matter of saving one another) and by the partial respects
of some others in the House, for the saving of their friends out of the House,
who have acted under the Authority, and for the evil ends aforementioned, we
find an absolute obstruction to the bringing to Justice, or questioning of any)
who have acted in the late leavying of War against us, and against the
Vindication of the Parliaments freedom, or in the said treasonable
engagements, yea, or in abetment of the tumultuous violence upon the Parliament
it self; neither can we find or hear of any one person hitherto brought to
Justice or Question for any of these things, but all seem to be either
justified, or at least protected from Justice by the power and prevalence of
those Members in Parliament* who are (many of them, as we can make appear)
equally guilty of, and (others) in some kind obnoxious for the same things; and
thus not only our just expectations of vindication to the Parliament, and
security to our selves and the Kingdom from the like treasonable and turbulent
practices in future, (by exemplary justice for what has been so done) are
frustrated, but even the safety and immunity of the Speakers, and those
faithful Members of both Houses that were driven away by the violence
aforesaid, and the immunity of the Army in advancing to London, to bring them
back, and restore the Parliament to its honor and Freedom (which has been
acknowledged, with public Thanksgiving to God for it, as aforesaid) is
subjected and exposed to question (where in theirs and ours, and the Kingdoms
enemies, obtrude themselves to be the Judges^) for if those pretended Votes,
Orders and Ordinances, whereby War was leavied against them and us were then
good and valid (though they should now be repealed, yet) we, with the Speakers,
and those Members aforesaid, in opposing of them while they were of force, must
needs remain transgressors still, and yet God and we are thanked for it [what
a mock is this to God and man.]

But to return to the more serious consideration of our case, in relation to
the security of the Parliament, Kingdom and our selves, against the like
turbulent and treasonable practices in future, since by the means aforesaid no
security by exemplary Justice can at present be had, (to deter any from the
like) we wish all men to consider what straights we are in this case put upon;
(That which is the maine work of the Kingdom, and which we most earnestly
thirst for, and attend upon, ( viz. the settling of a peace, and consideration
of our proposals in order thereunto) will ask time to bring it to an issue; and
that done^ the relieving or remedying of the pressing grievances of the
Kingdom, will take up and require the sitting of the Parliament for some
further time (though upon the settling of a peace, a period be set for the
certain ending of it) now for the body of this Army, or so great a part of it
(as may serve to overpower any future tumults, or force that may arise in or
from the City) to continue hereabouts so long, the condition of the Country
hereabouts, and the necessities of the City (in point of provision) cannot well
bear it, and (we doubt) foreign Forces (that are alre^dy upon the wing) and
turbulent spirits, that in several parts of the Kingdom, are beginning
Insurrections, (if we continue fixed here) will have such opportunity, and take
such encouragement therefrom, as that they may ere long necessarily call us
off; should we now or hereafter (while the Parliament sits) draw off the Army
from about the City, without exemplary Justice upon some, would not the same or
more dangerous tumults and violences probably return upon the Parliament; and
the like or worse pactises of raising a new War, be revived, (with more
advantage to our enemies, more danger to us and the Kingdom, and less hopes of
appeasing it, so easily and happily as the former) while the same viol^ and
factious spirits, both in the Parliament and else where shall continue in the
sam^ power and opportunities as for^ (...), and both they, and all others,
shall have before their eyes the incouragemen^ of that impunity and protection
(yea rather that justification) which they have hitherto found from within the
Parliament it self, in the past practices aforementioned, though as grossly
treasonable as any they can hereafter run into; should we or any others (for
the obtaining of exem lary Justice upon some) proceed to impeach any for their
past treasonable practices; what hopes of Justice, or of a timely dispatch
therein can we have, while such a prevailing party of new interested and
concerned in the same things shall in the House of Commons continue to be
Judges thereof, or at least be ready to avow and justify the offenders therein,
as having acted under their pretended Authority. In this straight therefore
(though we ever have been, and shall be most tender of all just Privileges of
Parliament, yet) finding the root of these and other difficulties to the
Parliament, Kingdom, and our selves, to lie in this, viz. [that those Members
of the House of Commons, who (during the forced absence of the Speakers of both
Houses) continuing to sit and act as a Parliament, did procure and consent to
the pretended Votes, Orders, and Ordinances aforementioned, for leavying of
War; and that (as is before demonstrated) in direct prosecution or
maintenance of the aforesaid treasonable engagement, and the violence done to
the Parliament, and for the opposing, resisting, and destroying of this the
Parliaments Army in its advance toward London (only to restore the Speakers
and Members of both Houses that were driven away, and the Houses themselves to
their Honor and freedom) and who are thereby, and by their late owning, and
avowing of the same, and many of them (as we can prove) by acting personally in
the said treasonable practices, become parties to the same, do yet take the
boldness to sit and Vote in Parliament, especially in the House of Commons]
(we say) finding the maine root of our difficulties and dangers `lying in this;
first, we appeal to all men, whether (...) be just or tolerable, that any
privilege of Parliament should (contrary to the Law of nature) make a man
Judge in his own case and concernment? and we wish those men themselves to
consider (if we had come to an engagement with the Forces raised by virtue of
their pretended Votes and Ordinances, and that thousands had been sl^ine, and
we had made our way by the Sword) whether they would then have expected to have
sat as Judges upon us therein? and we are sure it is no thanks to them that it
has been otherwise; and had we found those Members in Arms against us, and
subdued and taken them, whether had they not then been in the condition of
prisoners of War? and (if so) then having put Arms into the hands of others,
against us, and still maintaining it, whether can they in strict Justice
challenge any better condition from us? But, that [contrariwise] we should
suffer, either that those whom by the course of War [which they had chose to
engage in against us] we might justly make our prisoners, should in a course of
Law, become our Masters and Commanders? or that those who the other day did, in
an hostile manner, endeavor to have been our Executioners, should (now we have
by force took their preparations against us) become our Judges, (we suppose)
no reasonable man, nor themselves (when they well consider it) can expect from
us.

Upon all these considerations of the justness of the cause, and the necessity
of the thing, for the safety of the Parliament, Kingdom, and this Army,
(having no other way left timely to remedy the difficulties we are put upon, or
prevent the growing dangers of future violence unto the Parliament, and
disturbances of the Kingdom, or to secure the Parliament in a quiet proceeding
to settle the peace of the Kingdom. And (in such case) the safety of the people
being the supreme Law, we do protest and declare:

That, if any of those Members, who during the absence of the Speakers, and the
rest of the Members of both Houses (forced away by the tumultuous violence
aforesaid) did sit, and Vote in the pretended Houses then continued at
Westminster, that hereafter intrude themselves to sit in Parliament, before
they shall have given satisfaction to the respective Houses whereof they are,
concerning the grounds of their said sitting at Westminster, during the absence
of the said Speakers, and shall have acquitted themselves by sufficient
Evidence, That they did not procure, or give their consent unto any of those
pretended Votes, Orders, or Ordinances tending to the raising and leavying of a
War (as is before declared: or for the Kings coming forthwith to London) we
cannot any longer suffer the same, but shall do that right to the Speakers and
Members of both Houses, who were driven away to us, and to our selves with them
(all whom the said other Members have endeavored in an Hostile manner most
unjustly to destroy) and also to the Kingdom (which they endeavored to
imbroyl in a new War) as to take some speedy and effectual course, whereby to
restrain them from being their own, and ours, and the Kingdoms Judges in
those things wherein they have made themselves Parties, by this means to make
War, that both they and ohters that are guilty of, and Parties to the aforesaid
treasonable and destructive practices and proceedings against the freedom of
Parliament, and peace of the Kingdom, may be brought to condign punishment
(and that) at the Judgment of a free Parliament, consisting (duly and
properly) of such Members of both Houses respectively, who stand clear from
such apparent and treasonable breach of their trust, as is before expressed.

By the appointment of His Excellency, and the general Council of his Army.
