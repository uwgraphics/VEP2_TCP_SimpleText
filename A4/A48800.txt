To the Reader.
READER,
MEeting long since with a little Latin Book, called Gemma Fabri, being
Alphabetical Dysticks upon the Bible, I was strongly persuaded, that something
of that nature in English, would be very profitable toward the remembering,
repeating, and finding out of places of Scriptures, especially of the
Historical part. This moved me to prevail with some (whom I found inclined to
Poetry) to spend their spare minutes this way, and to contribute mine own mite
to the perfecting of what is now come (by Gods assistance) to their view;
wherein if thou expectest a Poetical flash, thou will be disappointed; neither
is it possible, where a person is tied to matter, Laconick brevity, and
initiating Letters.

Possibly the benefit of this tract may not appear to thy first glance: be not
discouraged, labor to hit the design, and thou may find the book answering
its Title: for thy help take these few directions, as a Key to it.

1. Are you desirous to have a Boy or Girl, of ten years or upwards, to tell
you in what Chapter any Historical passage is, let him read one Chapter every
day in order, and learn the Dystick (or two lines) which are the Contents
thereof. When he has learned twenty Dysticks or more, examine him of
particular passages in the Chapters he has past; as in what Chapter is set
forth Sarahs barrenness: he presently calls to mind this Dystick: Quell'd's
Sarahs hope of Seed; Hagar does scorn
Her Mistress, flies, returns: Ishmael's born.


He considers that (Q) is the first letter in the Dystick, which is the
sixteenth in the Christ-cross-row; thence he concludes it must be in the
sixteenth, or thirty sixth Chapter of Genesis.

I have known two children, who by this easy task, in half a years time, would
hardly miss any Historical passage from the first of Genesis to the end of Ruth.

2. Will you find some Historical passage, and cannot say these Verses by
heart; as the churlishness of Nabal, etc. your acquaintance with the Scriptures
assures you it is in the first book of Samuel; then turn to the verses which
contain the contents of that book, and you shall find it as soon as in a
Concordance, and many times sooner; this I know to be a truth upon mine own
experience.

3. Will you cull out a Psalm upon some particular occasion, read over the
verses which contain the substance of the Psalms, until you meet with what you
seek for.

4. Would you teach a Child or Servant a Scripture against some common sin, as
drunkenness, lying, etc. or in praise of some moral virtue or duty; read over
the Verses on the Proverbs, etc. and you will soon have your desire.

5. Do you desire to have your youth to repeat the History of any book in the
Bible in order? Let him read it with deliberation, and learn the verses on that
book, and he will do it to your content.

Time and experience may furnish you with other advantages: I have no more but
to request your charitable interpretation of what the importunity of many has
made public. If this answer not your expectation, the loss cannot be much: If
it prove any way beneficial to you or yours, the end is answered: Let him have
your Prayers, who is

Your friend in the Lord, J. L.

A GOOD HELP FOR WEAK MEMORIES.
GENESIS.
1
All Is made in six days, Heaven, Earth, Light, Seas vast:
Sun, Moon, Stars, Fish, Fowls, Beasts, and Man at last.
2
Blessed is the Sabbath, Woman formed, Man
in Eden placed; wedlock there began.
3
Craft of the Serpent, Man's fall wrought, all cursed.
A Savior promised. Man from Eden thrust.
4
Driven by pale envy, Cain does Abel kill,
is cursed. His seed the Land of Nod does fill.
5
Each Patriarchs Line and Age from Adam to
Noah, Enochs translation also.
6
Floods of sin cause the Lord the Flood to send;
Noah finds Grace; the Arks measure, form, and end.
7
Good Noah with some of all flesh God hides
in the Ark: the flood comes; how long it abides.
8
High floods assuage: Raven, and Dove, go forth;
then Noah; God his offering takes in worth.
9
Jah blesses him, his Covenant by Rainbow
confirms: Noah is drunk, Cham cursed also.
10
Knowledge of Noah's race is given, when
Nimrod is noted for oppressing men.
11
Language one: Babel built, confusion hatched.
Shems Line. Terahs remove. Abra'm is matched.
12
March Abra'm does with Lot to Canaan, given
of God. Denies his wife to Egypt driven.
13
Now both return, dissent; part Lot does choose
Sodom: God Abra'ms Covenant renews.
14
Of spoils from Kings ( Lot rescued;) Abram blessed,
pays Tithes; To Sodoms King restores the rest.
15
Promised a Son, Abra'm believes thereon:
Canaan confirmed by sign and vision.
16
Quell'd's Sarahs hope of Seed; Hagar does scorn
her Mistress, flies, returns; Ishmael's born.
17
Renewed the Covenant; Circumcision
Ordained and performed; Isaac promised thereon
18
Sarah laughs, is reproved: three Angels tell
of Sodoms fall: Abram to prayer fell.
19
Two Angels rescue Lot: his wife's turned salt.
His Daughters make him drunk: Incest's his fault.
20
Vain fear makes Abra'm Sarah to deny;
checked is Abimelech, she is restored thereby.
21
A Son has Sarah: Ishmael does taunt:
Hagar's cast out: Beersheba's Covenant.
22
By Gods Angel stopped is Isaacs Oblation:
Obedience blessed; and Nahors Generation.
23
Concerning Sarahs death, age, burial;
Machpelahs purchase is related all.
24
Drawn from his Kindred, as by his Oath ti'd,
Abraham's steward brings Isaac a Bride.
25
Eye here Keturahs Sons, and Ishmaels:
Abra'ms death; Esau born, his Birthright sells.
26
Fear forces Isaac to disown his wife:
The King's forbidden her: a Well breeds strife.
27
'Guiled by clothes, and tale, Isaac does bless
Jacob; Esau does threat: prevented is.
28
Here Jacobs blessed, to Laban sent. Esau
Is matched. Jacobs Ladder, Pillow, Vow.
29
Jacob to Laban comes, serves fourteen years
For his two Daughters; Leah four Sons bears.
30
Known's Jacobs hire, craft, wealth, Reubens Mandrakes:
Eight children more. The Concubines he takes.
31
Laban displeased; Jacob parts; God does take
his part, curbs Laban; They a Covenant make.
32
Messengers Jacob to Esau does hie:
Prays, Wrestleth with an Angel, halts on's thigh.
33
Now Esau Jacob meets, kisseth, and takes
gifts. Jacob at Shalem an Altar makes.
34
Of Dinahs Rape: Sechemites overthrow
by Jacobs Sons; Jacob does angry grow.
35
Purg'd's Jacobs house; at Bethel he is blessed:
Rachels, and Isaacs death. Reubens Incest.
36
Quietly seized of Scir, Esau lives.
His Progeny to Kings and Dukes birth gives.
37
Raging at Joseph's Dreams, his Brethren sell
him, grieve their Sire: In Egypt he does dwell.
38
Slain Judahs Sons are: Onan spills his seed:
Judah threats Thamar: Zarah has red thread.
39
Tempted is Joseph; shuns his Mistress lust:
falsely accused is into prison thrust.
40
Unfold two Dreams does Joseph: Pharaohs feast:
The Butler him forgets when releast.
41
Advanced by Pharaohs Dreams Joseph does store
up Corn. His Sons. Begun's a famine sore.
42
By dearth Jacobs Sons forced to Egypt are:
Shut up, freed, how, returned they declare.
43
Constrained by famine, Ben: is sent; set free
is Simeon: they by Joseph feasted be.
44
Devise does Joseph Benjamin to stay:
Judah would be his pledge; Joseph says nay.
45
Each Brother weeps when Joseph makes him known:
Chariots are sent to bring old Jacob down.
46
From Canaan Jacob steers, God's his conduct:
Joseph meets him; his Brethren does instruct.

Jacob sees Pharaoh, Rameses obtains.
48
His sick Sire Joseph with his sons does see:
are blessed; to Canaan their return shows he.
49
Jacob foretells his sons their destinies.
in Canaan will interred be; shortly dies.
50
Kinde's Joseph at this burial; Prophesies;
his age; takes Oath about his bones, and dies.
EXODUS.

A New King reigns. Jacobs growth is his hate.
His hellish plot: Midwives; the Infants fate.
2
Born and hid Moses is; preserved, maintaind:
Flies; Marries: Isreal's cries God's audience gained.
3
Confirmed by burning bush, and by Gods Name,
Moses is sent their freedom for to claim.
4
Drawn by signs, he to Egypt goes; his son
does Circumcise: Is helped by Aaron.
5
Increase of bondage makes Hebrews complain
to Moses, Aaron; they to God again.
6
Firming his promise by Jehovahs Name,
God strengthens Moses, he from Levi came.
7
Gods Message Moses to Pharaoh delivers:
his Rod turned Serpent, into blood the Rivers.
8

The Hail all Egypt (save Rameses) spoils.
10
Knowledge nor sense of Plagues breaks the intent
of Pharaohs will: Locusts, and Darkness sent.
11
Loan of the Egyptians Jewels Hebrews gain:
Aegypts first born are threatened to be slain.

where worshipt's God, eat holy things they may.

the thief is found, his all, of life bereft.

The six Tribes more have lots; the son of Nun
has Timnah Serah for possession.
20
Unwilling killers of men, without hate,
have refuge-Cities pointed in each State.
21
A portion God does to the Levites give,
forty eight Towns. Israel in peace does live.

He vengeance taking, yields up the ghost.
17
Riches by Micah stolen, he brings again;
Idols they make, a Priest they entertain.
18
Stripped of their gods, and Priest, they are by Dan.
when careless Laish by the sword, he wan.
19
The Levites wife abused at Gibeah, dead;
is cut in twelve, and over Israel spread.
20
Vile though, the fact Benjamites do defend;
foil Israel twice; are ruined in the end.
21
A Tribes loss moan'd; six hundred men remain;
who wives obtain, their Tribe to raise again.
RUTH.
1
A Dearth Elimelech and his Sons death brings
in Moab: Ruth to home-bound Naomi clings.
2
Boaz Ruth gleaning finds, and favor shows:
Ruth of her corn on Naomi bestows.
3
Counseled by her, Ruth lies at Boaz feet:
a kinsmans part is promised, as was meet.
4
Discharge he does his promise; Marriage joins
with Ruth: a royal seed springs from their loins.
I. SAMUEL.
1
AT Hannahs prayer heal'd's her barrenness:
Samuels birth vowed to God; rendered is.
2
By song Hannah thanks God; more children has:
Eli reproves his sons; God threats in wrath.
3
Called Samuel is; God shows him Elies woes;
he shows it Eli; and in credit grows.
4
Defeated Israel is; the Ark is lost;
with Elies sons; his, Phineas wifes life, cost.
5
Ekron, Gath, Ashdod plagued with Emerod,
for their profaning of the Ark of God.
6
From Philistims the Ark's returned again:
the Bethshemites looking into it, are slain.
7
Gods Ark to Kiriath brought; they wail their sins:
at Samuels prayer, they rout the Philistims.
8
His sons not treading Samuels path, they crave
a King; his manner shown: their will they have.
9
In seeking his Sires Asses lost, Saul goes
to Samuel, who him feasts; his reign foreshows.
10
King Readiness anointed, firm'd by signs, heart new'd
chosen by lot, despised by varlets rude.
11
Locked up by siege of Nahash, Jabish men
Seek aid; Saul frees them, is made King ag'en.
12
Mentioned is Samuels Justice; Isr'els sin,
with thunder-fearing, mercy comforting.
13
Noid's Geba's fort allarm Philistims sound;
Saul's offering checked; with him no smith is found
14
Overthrown the Philistims by Jonathan are:
Saul's oath; his sons sentence the people bar.
15
Preserving Amaleks spoils God Saul forsakes:
Samuel kills Agag; and of Saul leave takes.
16
Quitting Saul, Samuel 'nointeth David Ki^
Saul's evil spirit's expelled by his harping.
17
Repelled Saul's host is, at Goliahs sight;
David him kills; Philistims put to flight.
18
Strong love this drew from Jonathan, Saul's hate:
Saul, Michal as a snare, gives for his mate.
19
Trains against David, by Jonathan shown be;
pleads for him; Saul's rage: Michal sets him free.
20
With David Jonathan does league renew:
Saul's anger against them both; their sad adieu.
21
Abimelech at Nob does entertain
David; at Gath fear makes him madness fain.
22
Bands flock to David, he his Parents leaves
in Moab: Doeg Priests of life bereaves.
23
Chase Keilahs foes does David, false their heart;
Saul rounding him, Philistims Saul divert.
24
David spares Saul's life, shows his innocence;
Saul's swears him parts, confessing his offense.
25
Ended is Sam'els life; Abigails wise carriage
prevents from blood: Nabals death; and her marriage.
26
From slaying Saul David Abishai stays:
takes Saul's spear; Readiness and Abners fault displays.
27
Gath holding David, Saul pursues no more:
David beggs Ziklag; 's counted Judahs foe.
28
He Is Achish's guard: Saul left of God in fear,
seeks to a witch; from her his fall does hear.
29
Incensed Philist. David away do send:
him both does Achish, and his acts commend.
30
Kindled at Ziklags spoil are David's men:
he Amalek pursues, gains all age'n.
31
Losing the battle, Saul and his sons fall:
whom Jabish men honor with funeral.
II. SAMUEL.
1
AN Amal'kite owning Saul's death, is slain:
David laments Saul, and his Jonathan.
2
By Judah David's crowned; crow'nd's Ishbosheth
by Abner; their men fight: As'hels death.
3
'Creast's David's power, and sons: chafed Abner turns;
Joab him kills, is cursed; David him mourns.
4
Dire Traitors Ishbosheth their Master slay:
to them the like King David does repay.
5
Enstall'd by all is David, takes Zions Tower:
Hiram sends gifts; Philistims feel his power.
6
From Gibeah th'Ark's brought; Uzza's death: its rest
with Obed, thence to Zion: David's feast.
7
Gods house David would build, forbad; Gods blessing
on him, and his; he prays, and thanks confessing.
8
Here diverse Kings subdued: Toi's presents are
off'red to God, with Treasures gained in War.
9
Jonathans Son Ziba to Court does bring:
his honor; Saul's lands given him by the King.
10
King Nahash dead, David to cheer his Son
sends Messengers; are abused: War thereon.
11
Long's Rabbah sieg'd, David's adultery:
Uriah murdered is by treachery.
12
Made known his sins by Nathan, he repented:
Solomon's birth; Rabbah surpised, tormented.
13
Noble-sprung Tamar Amnon does defile:
Absolon flies, having him slain by guile.
14
Obtain does Tekoas widow his return:
his beauty, seed; he Joabs corn does burn.
15
Proud Absalon rebels, his father flies:
Curses Achitophel: David's Armies.
16
Quitted with treachery Ziba; Shimei rails:
Hushai complies; the housetop incest wails.
17
Rude is Achitophels death: by David's friends
what course to steer, what is counseled, Hushai sends.
18
Strict's David's charge concerning Absolon;
he is hanged in oak, his Fathers grief thereon.
19
This ceased by Joab, the King home is brought.
Excused Mephibosheth: Shemei pardon sought.
20
With Sheba's death at Abel the War ends:
false Joab Amasa to his grave, sends.
21
A three years famine for Saul's cruelties:
seven of his sons hanged: David's victories.
22
By songs does David his Gods praise advance,
for blessings, great power, full deliverance.
23
Confessed beyond sense David's faith is here
in his last words: his mighty men who were.
24
David does number Israel, wailes the offense:
of three plagues chooses three days pestilence.
I KINGS.
1

the Baalites are: God gives plenty of rain.
19

Jehu, Elisha, Hazael, anointed.
20
Unmanlike terms Benhadad seeks, twice beaten:
finds favor; this moves God Ahab to threaten.
21
Ahab denied a Vineyard, Naboth's slain:
the Tyrants threatened are with blood again.

By Prophets false seduced Ahab does bleed
at Ramoth: J'osaphats reign: their sons succeed.

Two Troops kill; one's saved: dead is Jorams Sire.

Elisha water heals: mocking boys die.
3

Benhadad. Jorams wicked reign and deeds.
9

in Naboths field: Jezabel dogs devour.

for Jehus sin, Hazael Israel smites.
11
Laid safe is young Joash; Athaliah sways:
Jehoj'da crowns him, her with blood repays.
12
Much good does Joash whilst the Priest remains:
After backslides, 's slain: Amaziah reigns.
13
Now Jehoaz, next Joash, Israel sways:
Elisha dies; his bones a dead man raise.
14
Of Amaziahs life, conquest, foil; slain
by Traitors: over Israel Jeroboams reign.
15
Pure is Uzziah; leprous: Jotham good:
five Kings in Israel reign, four die in blood.

the Brazen Altar turns to his own use.

Uzza: three months the Ark with Obed stays.
14
Of Hirams love, David's felicities,
in Children, people, wives; two Victories.

Feasts, Officers for to attend the Ark.
17
Raise no house David may to God, but his

Before his death, for Gods house he fits all;
directs his Son; his Princes help does call.
23
Crown Solomon does aged David, King;
divides the Levites, for their ministering.
24
Drawn into twice twelve Orders; the Aaronites
are divided, Merarites, Cohathites.
25
Enumerated are the singers, and
their twice twelve orders by David's command.
26
Fixed are the Porters parts, gates, what to do:
Who, Treasurers, Judges, Officers, who.

Guard in their months twelve Captains do the King:
the Tribes twelve Peers; Joab lets Isreal's numbering.
28
His Peers convened; serve God (said he) my Son;
his House build, here is the sorm, provision.
29
Entreaties cause all t'offer willingly:
he prays, all bless, Sol. reigns: David does die.
II. CHRONICLES.
1
Approved is Solomon at Gibeon,
for wisdoms choice; wealth, honor gains thereon.
2
Begun's the Temple; to Hiram the King
for men, and timber sends, obtains each thing.
3
Come read the Temples place, time, building, measure;
Ornaments, Cherubs, Vail, Pillars, with pleasure.
4
Done's the brass Altar; molten Sea behold,
Courts, Lavers, Tables, Candlesticks of gold.
5
Entering the Ark, the Oracle, aloud
the Trumpets sound; the House filled with a cloud.
6
First Israel, Solomon then, God does bless;
by Prayer Gods house consecrated is.

wisdom, wealth; his presents, his reign, and fate.

ten Tribes him leave: with stones Adoram kill.
11
Levites, Priests, all, fearing God, to him speed:
fight Israel he may not; his wives, forts, seed.
12
Mark Rehoboams sin; Shishak him whips:
Repents, his Judgment less'ned, death him nips.
13
Next reigns Abijah, wars with Isr'els King;
In God trusts, overcomes; his wives, offspring.
14
Of Asa's zeal see here; his peace, forts, might
Calling on God, he Zerah puts to flight.

Judah to teach; his strength, foes, gifts, present.

Striking alliance with Ahab, he goes
Against Ramoth; Ahab his life does lose.
19
Threatened for this he goes through his Land:
to Levites, Priests, and Judges gives command.
20
Up against him comes Lots seed, he fasts prays, foils;
gives thanks: his Ebion Gezer fleet God spoils.
21
After him Joram reigns, his Brethren slays:
of wives, sons robbed, he sadly ends his days.
22
By Jehu slain is wicked Ahaziah:
Joash saved from the hands of Athaliah.
23
Crowned Joash is by Jehojada, slain
Athaliah; God's worship's up again.
24
During Jehojada's life he is good; then falls
to Idols; Zacharie's blood for his blood calls.
25
Each Traitor slain, Amaziahs hired host
dismissed, spoiled, Edom foiled; his pride dear cost.
26
Full prosperous is Uzziah, till pride makes
him a leper; then Jotham the Rule takes.
27
Good is his reign; Ammon does Tribute pay
of force: after him Ahaz bears the sway.
28
Horrid is Ahaz, Syrians, Israel,
his people captives lead; his sins excel.
29
In a good way does Hezekiah reign:
purged is Gods House; his worship up again.
30

34
Of Josiahs reforming, Law found, read:
he mourns, cov'nants, Judahs fall prophesi'd.
35
Passeover's kept by him; the Egyptian King
him kills; his loss Judah does sadly sing.
36
Quick ruin does Josiahs sons seed bring
to Gods house, till restored by Persia's King.
EZRA.
1
AT Cyrus leave, Jews to return prepare,
for Temple-work; restored its Vessels are.
2
Behold the number of each Tribe, that went:
their goods, and what to God they did present.
3
Continual offerings are on Altar made:
with tears, and joys, Temples foundation's laid.
4
Decree of Artaxerxes hinders
the work, by foes procurement, to his death.
5
Encouraged by Gods Prophets, once again
they buil'd; Tatnai would let, but all in vain.
6
Finished it is by Darius's command:
the Passover is kept in Jury-Land.
7
Going to Jury, Ezra from the King
favor obtains; thanks God for the thing.
8
His company; for min'sters he demands:
a fast's kept; Treasure put into Priests hands.
9
Isr'els affinity with strangers he
confesses, mourns, prays against it earnestly.
10
Known here their grief is for this sin, and care
to put their wives away, and who they were.
NEHEMIAH.
1
AT Hanania's sad news, Nehemi fasts,
mourns, prays, because of Jerusalem wastes.
2
By Persia's King his grief is spied: he is sent
to build Jerusalem; their foes discontent.
3
Counted here are the names of persons all,
and order; who re-edifi'd the wall.
4
Deride do foes, he prays; the work goes on,
with workmen armed they watch; his direction.
5
Extortion stopped, they restitution make:
the Rulers pay, Nehemy will not take.
6
Fraud, rumors, Prophets of Sanballat fail:
the wall is built, the foes hearts thereat quail.
7
Good Hananiah has the Cities charge;
of Jews returned a Catalogue at large.
8
Here Ezra reads the Law, the people weep;
but are forbid: the feast of booths they keep.
9
Israel does fast, repent, Levites confess
their sins; Gods goodness, Covenant, a redress.
10
Kept are their names, the Covenant who sealed:
the tenure of it is at full revealed.
11
Lots show the tenth person who must abide
in Salem; there the Rulers must reside.
12
Mentioned are Priests who with Zerubbabel came:
they dedicate the wall with thankful clame.
13
Now read's the Law; communion mixed redressed:
Temple and Sabbath sins: strange wives repressed.
ESTHER.
1
AT the Kings feast Queen Vasthi will not come;
Divorced: a Law, men shall bear rule at home.
2
'Bove all Maids Esther is Queen'd; here a Treason
discovered is by Mordecai in season.
3
Crouch to proud Haman will not Mordecai.
Haman gets a Decree, all Jews to slay.
4
Doleful are Jews; Esther moved to redress
their woes; a fast commands, to beg success.
5
Esther finds grace, feasts Haman with the King:
for Mordecai a gallows is building.
6
For service done Mordecai rides in state,
by Hamans counsel; his friends speak his fate.
7
Gain audience Esther does, Haman accuse;
on his gallows is hanged the foe of the Jews.
8
Hamans house given to Esther: the Decree
reversed; Mordecai's honor: the Jews glee.
9
Jews enemies, and Hamans sons, are slain:
the two days feast of Purim they ordain.
10
King Ahasuerus greatness here is set forth:
with Mordecai his Publike-seeking worth.
JOB.
1
A Good great man is Job; by Gods permission
Satan him strips of all; his rare submission.
2
Boyls grieve Jobs body; grief does pain his soul:
his wife him tempts; three friends come to condole.
3
Cursed is Jobs birthday, he longs to die;
complains of life, because of misery.
4
Declaim against poor Job does Eliphaz;
Gods judgments not on just, but wicked pass.
5
End all men do in sorrow; Gods affliction
regard: the happy end of his correction.
6
Far beyond fault his rod is; Job contends,
craves death, it comfort brings: 'plains of his friends.
7
Galled with continual plagues, Job longs to die:
his restlesness and Gods vigilancie.
8
Hypocrites sure fall, from before Ages eyed:
Gods just dealing with men to Job applied.
9
Job having blamed his friends, desires to know
his sin, and cause why God afflicts him so.
10
Kept down by grief, life's weariness Job sho'ws.
begs before death, some slacking of his woes.
11
Lasht's Job for self-just, Gods wisdom none can
search out: the blessing of the penitent man.
12
Moved by his friends taunts, Job does justify
himself; sets forth Gods Omnipotency.
13
No friend Job has but's partial: he does show
his faith, his sins, and Gods purpose would know.
14
Obstruct grace does Job, death's sure, life is short:
past, no return; the cause sin, he waits for it.
15
Poor Job for self-defending is reproved
as wicked; wicked men's unquiet's proved.
16
Quip Job does his friends for their cruelty:
Shows his sad cause, pleads his innocence.
17
Runs Job to God; harsh acts astonish may,
not quell the just; his hope's in death, not day.
18
See Job impatient, presumptuous, blamed:
the miseries of wicked men are named.
19
The sad complaint of Job, and various woes;
craves pity, faith in the Resurrection shows.
20
Vile men's triumphing, and their final state:
oppression sweet, shall end in dismal fate.
21
A wicked man may thrive, who God withstood:
his ruin. In death equal bad, and good.
22
By man's works God's not gained: many sins laid
against Job; called to repent with grace displayed.
23
Confessing Gods grace, Job longs him to see:
God unseen, see us, his stable decree.
24
Deceit, oppression, and adultery,
though safe a while, are in Gods dreadful eye.
25
Elohims fear, dominion, and might,
declare can no man, nor be just in's sight.
26
From Bildad Job no help nor comfort finds:
of Gods great Power and Providence him minds.
27
Good Job's sincere; sans hope the Hypocrite:
On ill men's blessings God does curses write.
28
Had may be knowledge of things natural;
not wisdom, its worth; must from Heaven fall.
29
Job longs for, declares his former state;
his justice, when he judged in the gate.
30
Kicked at by varlets is in misery:
he condol'd others, God hears not his cry.
31
Lust, fraud, oppression, avarice, bribery,
Job does disclaim; his hospitality.
32
Moved young Elihu's with Job and his friends,
having them heard, in zeal his judgment spends.
33
Now (as God) pleads; he no count of his facts
gives: his ways to call men to holy acts.
34
Old Jobs charged, charging God with wrong; he must
be just: m^n lies before him in the dust.
35
Past hurt by sin is God, or by good, gain:
men wanting faith in trouble cry in vain.
36
Quench does Jobs sins Gods favor, whom he must
extol and magnify; because he is dust.
37
Renowned is Gods power by his works; this binds
man him to fear: his wisdom none out finds.
38
Summoned is Job by God to answer; he
's convinced of ignorance, debility.
39
The goats and other Creatures named are,
Gods Providence and power to declare.
40
Vile, Job himself affirms; God him stir does
his attributes to show: of Behemoth.
41
Almighty God sets forth what he do can
by his dispose: of great Leviathan.
42
Bows Job to God, his cause preferred; his friends
submit; he is blessed with wealth: his days he ends.
The Book of PSALMS.
1
A Good man's blessed, described, as fruitful tree:
the wicked, as the chaff, destroyed shall be.
2
Bold Heathen rage, consult against Christ, in vain:
they must submit themselves unto his reign.
3
Compelled by Absolon, David does fly:
he prays, on God rests for security.
4
David begs audience, enemies does reprove,
exhort: man's happiness stands in Gods love.
5
Expressing Gods hate against vile men, he prays
for his foes fall; the Saints safety always.
6
Filled with grief through sickness, and fierce foes,
he mercy sues: through faith triumphs over those.
7
Against his foes hate (professing innocence)
he prays: their fall; his safety faith does spy.
8
Heavens host, and all the world set forth Gods praise:
his love to man does admiration raise.
9
Jah's praised for foes defeat; David prays, he
like cause may have ill men's ruin to see.
10
King David prays against ill men's insolence:
prays for redress, professes confidence.
11
Let sinners threat, David trusts God, who knows
their plots, their end; to good men his face shows.
12
Marking good men's decay, help he does pray:
proud fl^tt'ring tongues, oppressors God will slay.
13
No help comes, David cries how long, he prays

its nature, power, wealth, eternity.

Know how differ love, hate, wisdom and folly:
sloth, labor; just unjust, speech bad and holy.
11
Lo, false weights, lowly, just, sincere men, and

Light 'vails wealth, counsel much; good wives praised are:
Fair fools, taling, corn-hoorders, sureties fare.
12
Merciful good men are; reproof fools hate;
his wrath soon known: a good wife crowns her mate.
Men good, wise, diligent, opposed see
to men contrary: Liars hated be.
13
Nipt pratlers are, sloth, pride, lies, word-despiser;
wise, good, described; good company makes wiser.
Naught some have, yet rich: of wealth well, ill got:
of cock'ring parents; wicked nuncio's lot.
14
Of wisdom, folly, signs; false witnessings,
backbitings, labor: what advances Kings:
Oppressing, poor despising, fearing of God:
what good men do, and gain: wicked men's rod.
15
Pure tongue rules; God sees all; wise, fools, good, bad:
mirth, sorrow differenced; scorners case is sad.
Pride, sloth, brib'ry, their ill; with love and grace

The sluggard, scold, merciful, wife that is wise;
smite scorners, waste not parents; sons chastise.

and rags: he is blessed that fears; quick getters blame.

of anger, pride, theft, fearfulness, corruptions.
30
Know Gods word, add not to' t; a man state's best:
Sire-mockers bane. Agurs fives, fours, expressed.
31
Lemuel chaste must be, sober; must defend
and cheer the fainting. The good wifes commend.
ECCLESIASTES.
1
ALl things are vain, Creatures restless, naught new;
old forgot, Solomon found by wisdoms view.
2
Brave pleasure's in vain; fools, wise, have one event:
none knows his heir; it is best joy in goods lent.
3
Changes of times; man's work's vain, Gods are best.
he shall judge man, who dies like the brute beast.
4
Dead praised are, from oppressions, coveting,
envy, sloth; wise poor exceeds wilful King.
5
Entering Gods worship, beware; wealth is vain;
it is Gods gift to enjoy our labors gain.
6
Full vain's wealth without use; without wealth vain
children, old age; none future things can name.
7
Against vanity, a good name, patience,
the house of Mourning: Wisdom's a defense.
8
Honor Kings, Divine Providence attend:
just poor, than wicked rich, make better end.
9
In outward all is alike; none knows life's length:
comfort's all this life's lot: Wisdom's before strength.
10
Kings when a curse and bliss; the difference
of folly and wisdom. Of slothfulness.
11
Lessons of charity: in life the day
of death and judgment youth must mind always.
12
Mind thy Maker in youth: to edify
's the Preachers care: Gods fear cures vanity.
The SONG of SOLOMON.
1

shows his sweetness and glory does abound.
4
Declare does Christ the Churches grace* his love;

her graces, and reveal to her his love.
7

the faith and desire of the Church professed.
8
How much the Church loves Christ; love's strong as death:
the Gentiles call: Christ's coming she prays.
ISAIAH.
1
A 'Plaint of Judahs sins, plagues; service vain:
with promise, threats, he warns to turn again.
2
By Christ's reign called the Gentiles are, Wars cease:
God leaves a Land for pride, and sins increase.
3
Confusion comes by sin; Jews shameless grown:
their Rulers gripes, and woman's pride are shown.
4
During the time of ills extremity,
Christ's Kingdom shall be best security.
5
Excus'd's by Vineyards parable Gods wrath:
the covetous, wanton, vile, unjust, threats has.
6
From Heaven by Vision Isay's call is shown:
for stubborness (few saved) the Jews overthrown.
7
Against fear of foe Isaiah comfort brings,
promises Christ: from Ashur Jew's woe springs.
8
Now Ashur Syrians and all Jews subdues:
Gods judgment's sure; comfort to his accrews.
9
In trouble joy by Christ's birth: hypocrites,
impenitent, proud, the Lord with threatening smites.
10
Kingdom and birth of Christ midst woes joys bring:
threats for hypocrisy, pride, not turning.
11
Learn here Christ's peaceful reign, the Gentiles call:
the Jews glorious restore; their enemies fall.
12
Mercies in that day shall cause Zion sing
a joyful Psalm of thanks to Isr'ls King.
13
Now God in wrath d^aws up his host: the Medes
against Babylon, it to destroy, he leads.
14
Of Jacobs restore, triumph, insultation
over Babel; Ashurs, Palestines vastation.
15
Poured out for Moab's state is lamentation:
her Cities do lament their desolation.
16
Quickened is Moab Christ's reign to obey;
threatened for pride, bewailed her dismal day.
17
Read threats against Syria, Jacob; Idols some
flee, plagued the rest: on Isr'els foes woes come.
18
Subdued shall Aethiop' be; and the success
shall be the Churches plentiful increase.
19
The fall of Egypt, her Peers fools; yet she,
Ashur, and Israel, one Church shall be.
20
Under a Type, by Isay, figured is
Egypt and Aethiops Captivities.
21
Arabia, Jacob, Edoms, overthrow:
on Tema, Kedar, God his wath does show.
22
Bold Persians Jews invade, Jews policies,
joys checked: Eliakim Christ typifies.
23
Come down must Tire, yet after seventy years,
although unhappy, her return appears.
24
Despoiled by Gods just judgments is the Land:
a remnant praising God with joy shall stand.
25
Eaalted God is for his Judgments shown;
his saving benefits, salvation.
26
For his Judgments this song calls; on God trust:
for his love to his, wait on him we must.
27
God for his Vineyard cares: his chastisements,
and judgments differ; Church of Jews and Gents.
28
Here drunkards, proud, indocible, secure
threatened; others safe in Christ, a rock sure.
29
Judged are Jerusalems dullards, hypocrites:
insatiate are her foes; joy shall meek sp'rites.
30
Keen's God's wrath against man-trust, sleighting his word:
Gods grace to 's Church; she joys in Ashurs rod.
31
Like's their woe who trust Egypt, leave the Lord:
Conversion's pressed: Ashur shall fall by th'sword.
32
Much blessings from Christ's reign; destruction
foretold; and promised restoration.
33
No foes of Gods Church are from judgments free:
the godlies privileges what they be.
34
Of judgments against Gods Churches enemy;
their overthrow: certain's the Prophecy.
35
Prosperous joy, shall from Christ's Kingdom flow
from Gospel virtues let the weak strong grow.
36
Quar'^ing Senacherib invades Judea;
Rabshekah blasphemes, it is told Hezekiah.
37
Raised is Isay the Kings grief to allay:
an Angel Ashurs Host, his sons him slay.
38
Sent's a death message; the Kings prayer gains
a longer life: thanks God with singing strains.
39
To Babels Nuncio his wealth Hezeky
shows: Isay foretells Jews Captivity.
40
Vulg'd's the Gospel: What John, the Apostles preach:
Gods power, pre-eminence, his, comfort teach.
41
About Gods mercies, promise, vanity
of Idols, with his people reasons he.
42
Behold Christ meek and constant; wherefore sent:
praise God for him; incredulous are shent.
43
Church cheered with promise: Gods power men witness;
Babels fall; his are safe; Jews excuseless.
44
Dumb Idols vain; their makers foolishness:
For Gods redemption, power, his praise express.
45
Established Cyrus is, for Churches good:
by Gods power men are to obedience wooed.
46
Fallen Nebo, Bell; God his to the end does save:
Idols with God no competition have.
47
Gods judgments on Chaldea, for their pride,
mercylesness, o'reboldness, none can abide.
48
Hypocrites, perverse Jews checked, Gods goodness;
he call's to obey, bewails their backwardness.
49
Jews Christ sent to, in vain; the Gentiles Call:
Gods constant love; his Church restore he shall.
50
Know Christ leaves Jews, from no defect to save,
or obey: trusts Gods help; our trust does crave.

his: Jews afflictions wails, deliverance sends.
52

his Ministers, Christ's reign exalted high.

55

repent; their happy success who believe.
56
Quickened they are to be just, keep Gods day;
with promises: blind watchmen he will slay.
57
Righteous men's death is blessed; God reproves
the sinful Jews: the penitents he loves.
58
Smooth Hypocrites reproved; fasts false and true
shown: Promises to Sabbath-keeping due.
59
Transgression parts from God; woes sinners haunt;
God only saves: the Saviors Covenant.
60
Unto the Church the Gentiles great access:
short troubles end in lasting blessedness.
61
Annointed's Christ, his Office, forwardness,
and blessings, which the faithful do possess.
62
Breathe promises does Isay, Church to stay:
Ministers Gospel-work must fit the way.
63
Christ shows who is his; what of foes his conquest;
mercy to his Church: her faith is professed.
64
Desire the Church does God his power to show:
sins natural confesses, wails her woe.
65
Elect are Gentiles: Jews cast off, saved few:
the wicked plagued, blessed state of Salem new.
66
For humble, comforts, Churches benefits:
the Gentiles call; Judgments for ill God fits.
The Book Of the Prophecy of JEREMIAH.
1
A Call to Jeremy: his Almond rod,
and Pot, show Judahs plagues, help him will God.

pleads: they their ruin cause; their trust vain is.
3
Called to repent Jews are of whoredoms past;
if penitent they shall Gods mercy taste.
4
Drawn are Jews to turn by threats, promises:
a lamentation for their miseries.

Expressed are threats against Jews 'cause obstinate,
adulterers corrupt in Church and State.
6
For Judahs sins destroying foes are sent:
their sins, Gods wrath, he calls them to repent.
7

offerings: God Idols, Tophet does abhor.
8
He shows the Jews distress, impenitent.
upbraids; their judgments, desperate state laments.
9
Jews sins and plagues he mourns; sin brings the rod:
he calls to mourn, to trust in none but God.
10
Know God's without compare; woes future flee:
Temple spoiled for bad guides; his prayer see.
11
Learn cov'nant-breakers curse; he threateneth mourn:
Anathoth men, for seeking of his death.
12
Much may the wicked thrive, but they shall
his false Brethren: the pen'tent shall return.
13
Note do wine-bottels, and girdle; their woes
prevention make; sin is the cause of those.
14
Outrageous famine makes him pray, in vain;
false Prophets excuse not; Jer. does complain.
15
Past cure the Jews woes are: Jer. their spite wails,
prays; God them threats; with comfort him assails,
16
Quite-ruin'd Jews in types he does foretell;
their return, that from Egypt, shall excel.
17
Ruin for sin, trust in man cursed, deceit
of the heart: Sabbath-keepers blessing's great.
18
Shown, by the Potters Type, 's Gods general sway.
Revolters Judgments; he against foes does pray.
19
The potters vessel broken does foreshow,
for their sins, the Jews dismal overthrow.

is counseled to fall to the Enemy.
22
By promise, threats, he wooes them to repent:
Shallims, Jehojakims, Coniahs judgment.
23
Cries against Pastors false; though the flock have
dispersed been, Christ shall them rule and save.
24

by bad Zedekies desolation known.

warns, that false Prophets no faith deserve.
28

breaks Jeremi's yoke, an iron for it: his death.

Laments Rachel: Ephraim turns, brought home is:
Christ's proms'ed; his care, new foede; Church greatness.

Of bondmen free, and re-assum'd to thrall:
for which the Nation by their foes shall sall.
35
Proud Jews condemned are, by the obedience
of Rechabs seed, who blessed are from thence.
36
Quoted in roll Jews pleasures are: Jehoi'kim
hears part, burns it: a new roll, woes against him.
37
Raised is the siege; Chaldees shall come again:
Jer's beat, shut up, at last some grace does gain.
38
Suit of the Moor Jer. from the dungeon clears;
the King he counsels; it is hid from the Peers.
39
The City burned is; the King made blind:
Jeremy freed, to the Moor good assigned.
40
Unto Gedali Jews come, Jeremy;
Johanan shows Ishm'els conspiracy.
41
After Gedali slain, Ishmael flees
to Ammon: Johanan his Captives frees.
42
Blamed is Johanans falseness, Jeremy shows
in Jury safety, and in Egypt woes.
43
Credit Joh'n gives not, Jeremy and Jews
to Egypt Joh'n brings: Aegypts thrall ensues.
44
Destroyed are Jews there, for Idolatry
and stubborness; Egypt shall Captive be.
45
Encouraged is Baruch, he shall not
with others fall; safety shall be his lot.
46

Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam.

Salem destroyed, advanced is Jechoni'.

From childhood Paul his state shows, mad is thought,
causless; Agrippa near a Christian wrought.
27

Deem'd's Abr'am just by faith, promise receives;
wee're just by faith, he is his Sire who believes.
5
Each faithful by Christ's blood has peace: Joys in
hope: by Christ life came, as by Adam sin.
6
Fly sin if dead to it, baptism does declare:
serve not sin, if in Christ; what sins hires are.
7
Good is the Law; on dead ones has no might;
we are dead to it: our lusts against grace fight.
8
Here signs and good of grace, here flesh harms
are;
Saints freedom longed, from Gods love naught
them bar.
9
Jews state grieves Paul; the promise: heirs not all:
Gods choice free, Jews cast off: why? Gentiles call.
10
Know how faith differs from works by the word:
all faithful saved: Gentiles shall find the Lord.
11
Lo some Jews chosen are, boast not against those
(Gentiles;) there is hope of more: Gods ways are
close.
12
Mercies obedience call; attend your place:
self-conceit and revenge flee, love embrace.
13
Necks bow to the high Powers: love does fulfill
the Law; night works with Gospel Times suit ill.
14
Object not against men for indiff'rencies:
give not offense, this proved unlawful is.
15
Praise not self: bear with weak; receive ye all,
as Christ did: Paul does for their prayers call.
16

of false Teachers, who do divisions breed.

contented be with your state; whoredom fly.
8
Heed take of Idol-meats; offenses fly.
your freedom, knowledge, curb with charity.
9
Joyn'd's not Paul to a wife, works; others free
are, may of Gospel live: of man's race see.
10
Know Jews rites, types of ours: plagued for our sake
they are: Let Us not Christ's table Satan's make.
11
Let women vail heads praying, men be bare.
in coming to Christ's Table take great care.
12
Many are Christ's gifts for profit, but one
his body, like natures; all gifts have none.
13
Nothing all gifts are without charity:
above faith, hope, love has supremacy.
14
Of tongues prophecy takes place, their use see,
abuse: Let women in Church silent be.

for their bounty: Paul commends Titus for's care.
9
Informed they are, why Titus is sent before:
free givers, free have; God is praised therefore.
10
Keen are Paul's spir'tual arms foes to resist:
absent, present the same; vaunting desist.
11
Lauds Paul himself in suffering; preaching free*
behind true, false Apostles, is not be.
12

his seeking them, not theirs, does love express.

their faith; prays for them, calls for peace and love.

faithful are justified, with Abr'am blessed.
4
Deliver from the Law does Christ his Saints;
free-womans seed: of their love changed his plaints.
5
Enfranchised from the Law, stand fast, but love.

4
Discern'd's Gods Throne, the Elders twenty four;
th'ey'd Beasts; Elders cast crowns down, him adore.
5
Enseal'd Book none but slain Lamb open can:
the Elders praise him for their redemption.

the horses, judgments, and the last Judgment.
7

with palms in hand, robes washed in the Lambs blood.

17
Ride scarlet woman does on Babels beast;
sev'n heads shown, horns ten: whore whipped; Lambs conquest.
18
Stout Babels fall; come forth must Saints: earths Kings,
merchants, and Sailors mourn; Saints joy thence springs.

Thank God, whore's judged: Saints blood 'veng'd, the Lambs wed;
Angel stays worship; fowls must eat the dead.
20
Vile Satan's bound, how long; when loosed again:
the first and last rising; Gog, Magog, slain.
21
A new heaven, earth, Jerusalem is shown;
Gods glory lights her; by Kings rich she is grown.

The year of the World. The years between. 1 Adam was created, Genesis 1.27. 130
Seth was born. Genesis 5.3. 130 235 Enos was born, Genesis 5.6. 105 325 Cainan was
born, Genesis 5.9. 90 395 Mahalaleel was born, Genesis 5.12. 70 460 Jared was born,
Genesis 5.15. 65 622 Enoch was born, Genesis 5 18. 162 687 Methuselah was born, Genesis
5.21. 65 874 Lamech was born, Genesis 5.25. 187 1056 Noah was born, Genesis 5.28,29.
182 1558 Shem was born, Genesis 5.32. with cap. 7,6 ca. 8.13. ca. 11.10. Though it
is said, Genesis 5.32. that Noah was 500 years old, and begat Shem, Ham, and
Japhet, the meaning is not, that they were all born at a birth, but that then
he began to beget. Now that Shem was not born before two years after, appears,
in that it is said, Genesis 11.10. That Shem at one hundred years old begat
Arphaxad, two years after the flood. And Genesis 7.6. that Noah was 600 years old
when the flood came.

502 1658 Arphaxad was born, Genesis 11.10. 100 1693 Salah was born, Genesis 11.12.
35 1723 Eber was born, Genesis 11.14. 30 1757 Perug was born, Genesis 11.16. 34 1787
Reu was born, Genesis 11.18. 30 1819 Serug was born, Genesis 11.20. 32 1849 Nahor was
born, Genesis 11.22. 30 1878 Terah was born, Genesis 11.24. 29 2008 Abraham was born,
Abraham could not be the eldest Son though he be placed first, Genesis 11.26 but
he was born 60 years after; as appears by comparing Genesis 11.32. with c. 12.4.
whereby it appears, that Terah lived 200 and five years, at whose death Abraham
was seventy five years old; which being subtracted from 205. there remains 130.

130 2083 The Covenant was made with Abraham, Genesis 12.4. 75 2108 Isaac was
born, Genesis 21.^. 25 2168 Esau and Jacob were born, Genesis 25.26. 60 2298 Jacob
went down into Egypt, Genesis 47.9 At this time Joseph was 39 years old, viz. at
his sale into Egypt, 17 years, Genesis 37.2. when he stood before Pharaoh, 30
year^, Genesis 41*46.

When Jacob came to Egypt, 39 years, for the seven years of plenty, and two of
famine were past, Genesis 45.6. so as Joseph was born when Jacob was 91 years old.

130 2369 Joseph died, Genesis 50.26. Which is cleare^ thus; Joseph was at his
fathers coming into Egypt (as before) 39 years: Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years,
Genesis 47.28. so as, at his father death he was 54 years, that is, in all, 110
years, Gen* 50.26. Add the 17 and 54 together, it makes 71.

71 2433 Moses was born. This is proved after. 64 2513 Israel went up out of
Egypt when Moses was 80 years old, Exodus 7.7. This must be so, because he lived
in all but 120 years, whereof 40 were spent in the wilderness, Deuteronomy. 34.7. with
cap. 29.5.

So as from the Covenant made with Abraham, to the Israelites coming up out of
Egypt, is 430 years, according to that in Genesis 12.41. with Gal. 3.17. which
proves the time between the death of Joseph to the birth of Moses to be 64
years.

80 2553 The Israelites entered into Canaan under the conduct of Joshuah, Josh.
5.6. 40 2570 Joshuah died: this is proved after. Othniel began now to judge
Israel, and continued 40 years; wherein is included Isreal's oppression by their
enemies; for the Scriptures reckon the time of the Judges to begin always from
the death of the former, otherwise we shall not bring the Scripture-Chronology
right. Judge. 3.9.11.

17 2610 Ehud judged Israel 80 years. Judge. 3*15.30. 40 2690 Deborah judged
Israel 40 years, Judge. 5.31. cap. 4.4. 80 2730 Gideon judged 40 years, Judge.
6.14. cap. 8.28. 40 2770 Abimelech judged 3 years, Judge. 9.1. etc. v, 22. 40
2773 Tholah judged 23 years, Judge. 10.1,2. 3 2796 Jair judged 22 years, Judge.
10.3. 23 2818 Jephthah judged 6 years, Judge. 11. and ca. 12.7. 22 2824 Ibzan
judged 7 years, Judge. 12.8,9. 6 2831 Elon judged 10 years, Judge. 12.11. 7 2841
Abdon judged 8 years, Judge. 12.13,14. 10 2849 Sampson judged 20 years, Judge.
13.25,31. 8 2860 Eli judged 40 years, 1 Samuel 4.18. 20 2909 Saul reigned (
Samuels time included) 40 years, Acts 13.20,21. 40 2949 David reigned 40 years,
1 King. 2.11. 40 2989 Solomon reigned before the building of the Temple, four
years, 1 King* 6.1. So as all the time from Isreal's coming out of Egypt to the
beginning of the Temple was 480 years, according to 1 King. 6.1.

40 2993 Solomon reigned after he began the Temple 36 years, 1 King. 11.42. 4
3029 Rehoboam reigned 17 years, 1 Kings 14.21. over Judah. 36 3046 Abijam
reigned 3 years, 1 Kin. 15.1, 2. 17 3049 Asa reigned 41 years, 1 King. 15.10. 3
3090 Jehoshaphat reigned alone 21 years, 1 King. 22.41. 2 King. 8.16. with 1
King. 16.24. 1 King. 22.51. The last four years of Jehoshaphat are not
computed, because his son Jehoram began to reign four years before his death:
(as before.)

41 3111 Jehoram reigned 8 years, 2 King. 8.16,17. 21 3119 Ahaziah reigned 1
year, 2 Kin. 8.26. 8 3120 Athaliah reigned 6 years, 2 Kin. 11.3. 1 3126 Jehoash
reigned alone 37 years, 2 Kin. 12.1. in all 40 years. But his last three years
are not computed, because his son Amaziah began to reign 4 years before his
fathers death, as appears by comparing the beginning of their reigns with their
contemporaries, 2 King. 13.10. with 2 King. 14.1.

6 3163 Amaziah reigned in all 29 years, 2 Kin. 14.2. but alone but 18 years*
for in his 18 th. year the people made a conspiracy against him, so as he was
forced to flee from Jerusalem, then they made Azariah (alias Uzziah) his son
King, who reigned 11 years in the life of his father, 2 King. 14.19. Herein I
agree with our Annotators, and Doctor Mayer, (contrary to the judgment of
Willet, Tostatus, Genebrard, and Functius,) as most agreeable to the Chronology
of the reigns of the Kings of Judah and Israel. Compare 2 King. 14.1,19. 2
King. 15.2. with 2 King. 13.10. 3181 Azariah reigned in all 52 years, 2 Kin.
15.2. that is to say, 11 years in the life of his father, and 41 years alone.
18 3233 Jotham reigned 16 years, 2 King. 15.32,33. 52 3249 Ahaz reigned in all
16 years, but alone but 13 years, 2 King. 16.1. with 2 King. 17.1. where it
appears, that Hosheah began to reign in the 12 th. year of Ahaz: therefore Ahaz
reigned 4 years complete after. And that Hezekiah began to reign in the third
year of Hoshea; therefore he began to reign with his father in the 14 th. of
Ahaz. 16 3262 Hezekiah reigned 29 years, 2 King. 18.2. that is to say, 3 years
with his father, and 26 years after. 13 3291 Manasses reigned 55 years, 2 King.
21.1. 29 3346 Amon reigned 2 years, 2 Kin. 21.9. 55 3348 Josiah reigned 31
years, 2 Kin* 22.1. 2 3379 Jehoahaz reigned 3 months, 2 King. 23.31. 31 3399
Jehoiakim reigned 11 years, 2 Kin. 23.36. In the fourth year of his reign began
Jeremiahs 70 years, as 2 King. 24.1. etc. with Jer. 29.1,2. etc. v. 10.

3390 Jehoiakin reigned 3 months, 2 King. 24.8. 11 339^ Zedekiah reigned 11
years, 2 King. 24*18. 3401 Jerusalem and the Temple destroyed, 2 Kin. 25.2,
etc. 11 3453 Cyrus gives a Command for the building of the Temple, Ezra. 1.1,
2 Chro 36.21, etc. ^ as the full number of years from the first building of the
Temple, to the Decree of Cyrus for the rebuilding of it, is 4^^.

52 The Persian Monarchy. 3453 CYrus, after he translated the Monarchy from the
Medes to the Persians, reigned seven years; as Ruwleigh, Usher, Mercator,
Buntingw. 3460 Cambyses reigned 7 years, five months, the Magi included; as
the aforenamed authors, with Helvicus, Pemble, Alstedius, and others. ^ 3467
Darius Hystaspis reigned 36 years, as is acknowledged by all. ^ 3503 Xerxes
(called Artaxerxes Magnus) reigned 21 years; as Rawleigh, Functius, Alsted.
Helvicus, More. 3^ Artabanus reigned 7 months, which is included in Xerxes.
3524 Artaxerxes Longimanus reigned forty years, as Helvicus, Junius, Alsted,
Mercator, More, and Buntingw. Xerxes Secundus ( Longimanus his son) reigned two
months, and was slain by Sogdianus.

Sogdianus reigned 7 months: both these are included in Artaxerxes time.

2^ 3564 Darius Nothus reigned 19 years; as Say, Usher, Rawleigh, and all
Chronologers. 4^ 3583 Artaxerxes Mnemon reigned 43 years. as is affirmed by
all. 1^ 3626 Ochus reigned 23 years, as is confessed by most. 43 3649 Arses
reigned 3 years, as Usher, Rawleigh, Junius, Pemble, More, Mercator, and
others. In him was extinguished the line of Cyrus. 23 3652 Darius Codomanus
reigned 6 years, as Usher, Rawl, Helvicus, Alstedius, Pemble, Functius, More,
and others* he was conquered by Alexander Magnus, and the Monarchy translated
to the Grecians. So as the Persian Monarchy lasted not above 205 years.

3 The Grecian Monarchy. 3658 ALexander Magnus translated the Mo^^rchy to the
Grecians, and reigned 6 years. After his death his Kingdom was divided among
diverse of his Captains; of whom,

6 3664 Ptolomeus Lagi reigned over Egypt 40 years. 6 3704 Ptolomeus
Philadelphus succeeded him, and reigned 37 years. 40 3741 Ptol. Euergetes
reigned 25 years. 37 3766 Ptol. Philopater reigned 17 years. 25 3788 Ptol.
Epiphanes reigned 24 years. 17 3807 Ptol. Philometer reigned 35 years. 24 3842
Physcon reigned 29 years. 35 3871 ^ath^rus reigned 36 years. 29 3907 Auletes
reigned 29 years. 36 3936 Cleopatra reigned 22 years. 29 3958 With the death of
Cleopatra the Grecian Monarchy died, and was translated to the Romans, having
continued 300 years: I prove not this Monarchy, because there is little or no
controversy about the total. 22 3987 Jesus Christ was born in the 29 th. year
after the death of Cleopatra, as most affirm, which was in 32 or 33, others in
36 of Herod (as all agree) who was King of the Jews; the Scepter being departed
from Judah, for Herod was an Idumean. 29 An. Do 30 Jesus Christ was baptized ^n
his thirtieth year. 30 4017 33 Jesus Christ was crucified, being 33 years, and
half, old; as most affirm. 3-6 4021 73 Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus
Vespasian, in the 40 th. year after Christ's death. 40 4061

When I ha^ brought this Chronology from the Creation to the Decree of Cyrus, I
thought at first glance to make Daniels 70 weeks the golden chain of time, from
thence to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the Temple; but after much time
spent in consulting with many Chronographers and Expositors, finding no
satisfaction, I resolved rather to lay it aside, than to beat my brains to
bring forth a new Minerva, which all old Midwives have failed to effect. I
shall therefore conclude with that advice of the Learned Dr. Vilvain of Exon,
in his compend. of Chronography. Seek not to wrest a connection of Sacred
Chronology from Daniels Vaticiny, which the Holy Ghost never intended: swim not
against the stream, nor cast dust against the wind, lest it fly in thy face.

Thy Servant in the Lord Jesus, Jo. L.
