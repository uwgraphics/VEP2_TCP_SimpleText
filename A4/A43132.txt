LONDON: Printed by Peter Cole living in Leaden Hall, and at the sign of the

TO THE Most Illustrious Highborn PRINCE JAMES, DUKE of YORK and ALBANY, Lord
High Admiral of England, and Heir apparent to the Crowns of Great Britain and
Ireland,
May it please Your Royal Highness,

IT is confessed with all Humility, That the unworthy Authors boldness in
tendering this Book to kiss Your Princely Hands, is in it self sufficiently
Criminal, to merit your Non-acceptance and Rejection; which will appear much
more, when it is acknowledged to be the same that when it first obtained its
Imprimatur, in the year, 1655. In order thereunto, was forced by the Formality
of a Prefatory Epistle, to own that Tyrannous Usurping Power, which with the
terror of a successful Sword, ore-aw'd these then unhappy Nations into a
seeming Compliance and Subjection. This, as it does expose the Book and Author
to your Highness just displeasure; so might it discourage both from this
Address, which carries with it such an appearance of Presumption. But Great
Sir, That Clemency and Goodness which is so proper and natural to the Royal
Family (which in the gracious offers of his Sacred Majesty, the whole Kingdom
has so happily experienced, and with such Joy and Thankfulness in Parliament
has been acknowledged) forbids your Supplyants despair of Pardon from your
Royal Highness of that Fault which Fear and Force, and the Necessities of the
Times involved him in against his Inclinations and Affections to that ancient
flourishing Monarchy, under which in the Reign of your Royal Father of Glorious
Memory, he had in the Service of the Navy, for above twenty years together,
been honored with Employment; and gives him encouragement humbly to beg your
Highness leave, that this small Tract, designed for the benefit and service of
the Royal Navy, now so happily under your Command, being by this new Dedication
made fit for Public Use and View, may be permitted to see the Light with
freedom, from which it has been kept this five years since it was printed, all
the Copies still remaining in the Authors hands, who has not yet disposed of
twenty of them to this blessed Day: wherein as he rejoices in common with all
good Subjects for his Sacred Majesty's so Peaceable Restoration to his
undoubted Rights (in preservation whereof, according to the known and ancient
Laws, they now are sensible how much all that is dear unto them is interessed
and concerned) so it is particularly a joy unto him, that still by Providence
this opportunity is preserved of making Public, together with these his
Labors, the just expectations of all considering sober persons, That as the
Armies both of France and Spain have not long since experienced the Influence
of the incomparable Valor and skilful Conduct of so great a Captain as your
Royal Highness, according as their dealing with you gave you just cause on
either side, for to employ them: So that now the Navy Royal of this Island,
Commanded by You, will be not only (as of old) the Walls of this Renowned
Empire; but an awe and terror to all the Enemies of the English Name and Glory.
These, Great Prince, as they are the hopes, so likewise they are the subject of
the hearty Vows and Prayers of

The most Humble and Obedient Servant of Your Royal Highness, E. HAYWARD.
June 21. 1660.
To the Concerned READER.
I Should have spared the trouble of another Epistle, but merely to answer one
common Objection, which will necessarily be made, and that is this: That the
Riggings hold not punctualy for every Ship of a Rank? Whereunto I reply and
grant, That they may differ a little in some respects; but thus much I am
assured of, That no nearer way can be laid down for Method and brevity: And
therefore he that has the fitting out of any Ship or Frigate in particular,
must be so considerate as to compare his Rules with the Ship in hand, and so
vary the size and length accordingly. Nay, he that is a Clerk in that business
ought to be very circumspect and watchful, otherwise the State may be abused.
As in two Instances instead of many more which might be given. A Boatswain
comes for Rigging, the Clerk not knowing his Duty, gratifies his desires; such
a thing I say may be to the disadvantage of the Public. But as a prevention
this course is taken by me; Before I make out the Rigging, I consult my Survey
Book, and require his demand; when I have it, then I compare my own Rules
thereby, where he exceeds, I shorten, and where it is shorter than my
Directions I let it pass, unless it be to the spoiling of a Rope; and I am apt
to believe that many are so served, and yet will not complain to discover their
own ignorance. Again, When a Ship is fitted to Sea with much new Rigging, there
ought to be a special care at her return, to observe that old Ropes were not
put up instead of new; and herein the Clerk who has the Book in his hand, must
have judgment to discern as well as the Master Attendant, otherwise in that
particular also the State may be wronged.

And when all is done inreference to Enquiries, Experience must be the best
Guide, as to Riggings; For I have observed that Rules of Art, which many
Mariners are apt to give, and plead for (as in the fifty nine Page of this
Book) do not hold punctually, though they are not to be rejected; and therefore
the measuring of particular Ships Riggings, is the surest Foundation.

You may also please to take notice, That Proportions of Stores (as in this
Book) cannot always hold the same, for they may and must differ, with respect
to the Service in hand; and remote Employments will necessarily require an
increase of Provisions.

June 21. 1660. E. Hayward.

A Rule for Main-Masts, and for sizing of Shrouds and Stays.
It must be half the length of the Keel, and once the length of the Beam; put
them together, and so long must your Main Mast be.

Then for small Vessels, three times the length of the Beam, from the Hounds
downwards, that ought to be the length of the main Mast.

And look how many Inches your mainmast is through, your mainstay is to be
half of that about, or half so many Inches as your mast is about, and let your
shroud be as the one half of your stay in size; and the topmast shrouds as the
one half of the main shroud.

Mr. Brigges, and Mr. Wells, their Rule for the mcasuring of Ships.
1 Take the length of the Keel, leaving out the false Post, if there be any.

2 Take the depth of the Ship, from the greatest breadth to the Footwaling, by
the Keel within board.

3 At half the depth, take the breadth of the ship within the Seeling, which is
called by them, the main breadth.

These three Dimensions being multiplied together, and the solid number divided
by 65. the Quotient gives the content in Tuns, unto which add the third part,
so have you the tuns and tunnage.

I had a full resolution to enlarge this Book, with the several Particulars
following upon the same Subject, viz. to lay down,

The Allowances to Ships in Harbor, in reference to Boatswains and Carpenters.

What lengths of Cables are required to moor any of the States ships in Harbor
at Chatham and Portsmouth.

The scantlins, number, and species of Blocks and Deadman Eyes, required to the
Rigging of any of the States ships.

The Circumference of each ships tops.

The length, breadth, depth, and burden of the States ships.

The lengths of all the ships masts and yards.

The Clothes, and depths of every ships sail.

The weight of every ships sail.

The quantity of Canvas in each Frigates sail: and this particular I intended
should be in the Book, but forgot to enter it in its proper place, and
therefore omitted it purposely.

Each ships draught of Water.

Masts required to mast and yard all the Frigates.

Other things I might have added, but fear this Subject may be tedious,
especially to those Honorable Personages employed in the weighty Affairs of the
Nation, and therefore conclude my pains.

FINIS.
