This is called, Maids look well about you? OR, The cunning Yung-man fitted.
A Young Man was walking by himself alone,
His sweetheart had left him, and he made great moan
As he was walking he to himself then said,
That he would be married to any young Maid.
And as he was looking and turning behind him,
A Maiden was by him, but did not well mind him.
He went to the Maid and fain would have bin billing.
But the Young-maid of him got forty shilling,
Then listen unto me and I will you tell,
The merry Jest which to him befell.
To the tune of, Weet and weary.


AS I went forth one Evening tide,
it was my chance to spy one,
Was wal^ing by a River side,
but he would not come nie one,
A Maid was stoupin hard by him
a gathering of Primroses.
And as she gathered by the spring
she made them up in Posies
Hark how this B^ade did coge,
pretending he did woo her
But he within his heart did mock
on purpose to undo her.
The Young Man said unto the Maid
as he did step unto her:
Of me I pray be not afraid,
he thus began to woo her.
Sweetheart these flowers which thou have hear
I hope I shall enjoy them,
And the flower of thee my dears,
oh do not say me nay then.
Hark now etc.
Maid, I pray sweet Young Man be content,
I dare not love a stranger?
^or after ward I may repent,
for therein is great danger:
Therefore from me begone,
I do not love your prating.
I had rather to be left a lone,
Your smothings I do hate them.
Hark now etc*
I wish you to go seek a Love,
I do not love to flatter,
A Man I must both try and prove,
for it is a greater matter,
I will not believe flattering words.
for fare I should miscarry,
For men good words they can afford's
I purpose not to marry.
Hark now etc.

Man. Sweeting thou art brightest Girl,
my love is to the sure,
Thou art my fairest rairest Girl,
most loveing I Will endure*
I prethy grant to my desire,
thou art my loveing creature,
My Senses almost are on fire,
of all Maids thou art the feature.
Hark now etc.
If thou to me wilt constant prove,
I Will give thee all my Portion:
If thou will ever be my Love,
then grant to me my motion,
If thou will lie down on this Bank*
I Will keep thee from all hurtings.
My Cloak shall lie under thy back,
the trees shall be thy Curtins.
Hark now how this Blade did cog
pretending he did woo her.
But he within his heart did mock,
(...)

The second Part,
to the same Tune


HE turned and looked about him round,
and thought no one was nie him,
Behind a Bush near to that ground,
most nimble then I spied him,
He sat him down then by the Lass,
The Maid was something bashful,
And many words betwixt them past,
she thought he was a Rascal,
Hark now how this Blade did cog,
pretending he did woo her,
But he within his heart did mock
on purpose to undo her.
Away the Maid went to the Town,
this Blade he followed after,
He proffered the Maid a Greene-gowne,
to get a Son or Daughter,
Moreover forty shillings here
jle give thee for my pleasure,
I Will give thee all things past compare,
beyond all worldly treasure,
Hark now, etc.
The Maid received his money then,
and put it in her pocket,
Most nimble she away then ran,
and in her Chest she locked it,
But as the Maid did run from him,
this Blade he then ran after,
And I ran hooping after him,
saying Friend what is the matter.
Hark now, etc.
Why do you run after the Maid,
would you with her be dealing,
O she have cheated me he said,
the sum of forty shilling,
How did she come to cheat thee Friend,
why was it then a Bargain,
The Maiden I will now commend,
the World you see's uncertains,
Hark now, etc.
Away this Blade did go away
and did repent him after,
He mourned and grieved as I heard,
all folks wos filled with laughter.
He could not go unto a Town,
but all the Boys was jeering,
And told him he could give a Gown,
but must cost forty shilling,
Hark now, etc.
The Maids that lived within the Town
did laugh and jeere him basely,
And said that he would give a Gown,
but never would love Sifly.
They laughed and jeered this fellow so
that he would to Barbados,
There was neither Friedd nor also Foe,
but wished him at the Gallows.
Hark now, etc.
The civil Maid that served him so,
was very much commended,
Over the Seas he then did go,
while the Maid was much be friended,
This Young Man which by the Bush laid
which saved this Maide's credit,
A suting came to this fair Maid
there was none that would forbid it.
Hark now, etc.
This Young Man came a suiting then,
in heart he mean'd to have her,
Welcome the fairest of all Men
to thee I will show favor,
Thou shall be welcome unto me,
in thee is all my delight.
No question but we shall agree,
at morning noone or midnight.
Hark how, etc:
This coule asked were three times,
before the day of Marriage,
This couple now were in there primes
they both had gallant carriage,
All Men and Maidens in the Town,
did run unto the Wedding,
And there they spent many a crown,
and some came without bidding.
So Men and Maids I bid adieu,
and Maids look well about you,
There Is many false, and some are true,
and many that will flout you*
Threfore you had better be without,
and live a single maiden,
Then to have one that's given to flout.
O then your'e over laden
Hark now how this Blade did cog,
pretending he did woo her
But he within his heart did mock,
on purpose to undo her.
