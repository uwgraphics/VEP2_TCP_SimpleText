The third Edition much enlarged,

By Jos: Henshaw, Dr of Divinity.

LONDON, Printed by W. H. for T. A. and are to be sold by G.B. at his shop in
S. Dunstans Churchyard in Fleet Street, 1651.

TO The READER.
IT is not out of desire of being known, nor out of a desire to be thought to
know, that I do commend this small Tract to the world; but to take up the
room of worse thoughts in thy head, and of worse Books in thy hands; it is
the work of younger years, and the fruit of idle times, not of a serious
study, and no otherwise do I publish it to view; though I am persuaded it would
conduce much to the peace of the Church, if Books of this nature were more in
use: it were to be wished that inferiors would employ their time rather in
holy Meditation of those truths which are already received in the Church, than
in making themselves, or showing themselves able to defend them; not that I
would commend an ignorant devotion to any, or desire men to know less good,
but more to practice that good which they know; nor turn Religion into
disputation, but turn their disputation into action, and obedience; they shall
find in the last day that it is holiness, not knowledge, (I do not say
holiness without knowledge) that must bring them to Heaven; Supremo illi
judici non scripta approbanda, sed facta; not the disputer, but the doer of
Gods will shall be justified: men while they spend their time in disputing what
they should do, they too often neglect to do even those things which are
without dispute; in this Book if there be little pains, yet there is no hurt;
nay, it is thy own fault if there rise not some good to thee from it, which if
thou second with practice, will bring thee to an eternal good, which I wish
thee.

Daily Thoughts.
MAke the Word of God the Rule, and God himself the Pattern of all thy
actions; contemplate God and thy self; what He is, what He requires thee to
be, like Him in a degree, though not a perfection; in a perfection of
sincerity, though not of degrees. Do nothing against thy word, and let thy word
be regulated by God's Word; do not ill for company, nor good only for company.

LEt thy talk not be much, and that profitable: be sparing of oaths and
promises, and perform both: shun jests in holy things, and abhor lies though
in jest: speak to the capacities, but not to the humors of men; so frame thy
talk, as one that is going shortly to give an account of his words: detract
from no man but thy self, speak well of all men till thou know otherwise,
and where thou can not speak well, be silent: meditate often upon the
shortness of thy life, and be careful so to employ it, as that thou do not
make thy account long; measure the length of it as the Scripture does by a
Bubble, and a Shadow, and a Flower light and vanishing; but yet to comfort thy
self in this present state with the remembrance of the future; that if this
life which thou have be short, yet that which thou hopest for, is eternal.

My life is like a Bubble, but a blast.
At first God breathed into me, and I live;
And like a Bubble, I do daily wast,
and am like water powered into a sive;
Lord, since I am thy bubble, when I die,
Like to a bubble, let me ascend on high.
Or if you will, my life is like a Flower,
And like a Flower for a while I stand;
I am, and am not in an other ^owre,
For I am gathered by the owner's hand;
Since I am so, why am I so corrupt,
That do not know how soon I shall be plucked
But of all Flowers, most of all me thinks,
Resembled in the Marigold am I;
And like the Marigold that wakes and winks,
Still as it sees the Sun, am borne and die;
But here is my comfort, with that flower when
The Sun appears, I shall blow again.
AFfect not to set out thy self to the world, nor to thy self; speak not
thine own praise, nor greedily hear it from others, nor too easily believe
it: spend thy time rather in pressing forward to what thou should be, then in
idly contemplating, or contenting thy self with what thou art; think meanly
of thy self, and that thought will both make thee modest (for he that suspects
himself is not bold) and eager in the pursuit of that goodness or knowledge
wherein thou supposest thy self defective; be ready rather to give, then to
take an applause, and if thou art apt to think thou deservest well, check it
with thinking how many deserve better.

LEt thy thoughts be such to thy self, that if it should be suddenly asked,
what thou think on, thou might not blush to tell; stifle sin in the
first warmth and quickening, before it shape too far: a twig may be plucked up
with one hand, which the whole body cannot wag, when it is a tree; even evil
thoughts are evil, and though yet they be not, yet cherished, will spread
into evil actions.

BE not easily provoked, and easily be friends; give no occasion of exceptions
thy self, and do not easily take exceptions at others; and be ready to make
satisfaction to those that have just exceptions against thee; it is a greater
virtue to forgive one injury, than to do many courtesies; because it is harder:
and it is harder, because more against nature; for many a man will do for
another, that will not suffer for him; therefore it is a greater perfection to
be contented to suffer, than to be willing to do, unless it be to do for
those of whom we have suffered, for our enemies, which is the highest.

AFfect the company of those who are abler then thy self, and desire rather to
partake of others sufficiency, than to publish thine own; in meaner company
thou may be admired more, but in this thou shall profit more: it is better
to learn wisdom from those that are wise, then to be thought wise by those
that are ignorant: be studious rather of being able, then of being so
accounted; not to pick up thy knowledge, especially thy opinions, from other
men's discourse; but with pains and industry rather to search out the knowledge
of truth thy self, then lazily to take it up from others.

IN Religion examine, but not broach opinions; ever incline to Antiquity, and
suspect novelty; in middle things ever submit to the Authority thou live
under, and let the Churches opinion be thine.

MEasure not equity and right by friends and profit, nor do wrong, either to
get or to do a courtesy; not upbraid others with the kindnesses thou do
for them, nor forget the kindnesses which others do for thee: be sparing of
receiving a courtesy where it is an engagement, and of doing one where it is
dishonorable.

BE not wilful nor wavering, not change but upon good reason, not obstinate
against reason; not believe every report, not to report every thing thou
believe; not grant every thing which thou can not answer, but suspect
rather thine own insufficiency that cannot defend it, then cry down the
matter as not to be defended.

BE sparing of thy commendations, especially of thy self; commend no man
undeservedly, that is flattery; not thy self, though never so deserving, it is
vain glory.

DO not admire or applaud what thou understandest not; do not seem to
understand where thou do not; it is better to acknowledge thy ignorance, and
learn; than falsely to profess learning, and be still ignorant.

DEsire rather to do well, than to hear well; if thou can, preserve to thy
self a good report, but be ambitious only of a good conscience; do not
measure thy self by other men's reports, nor measure other men by thy self;
ask thine own heart, and not their tongues, what thou art.

Labor to resorme thy self first, let other men's finnes rather be the subject
of thy grief, than of thy discourse; so speak of other men's sins, as that
thou detract not from the person; and so excuse or mitigate the slip of any
person, as that thou seem not to countenance the sin.

Do not think thou art good enough, so long as thou art not known to be
otherwise, and never think thy life so good, as not to need mending.

SAy nothing but what thou meanest, and promise nothing but what thou art able;
not to intend what thou speak, is to give thy heart the lie with thy tongue;
not to perform what thou promisest, is to give thy tongue the lie with thy
actions.

Do not greedily find frult in any, nor reporoachfully publish it; but rather
by a hiddenand oblique way to insinuate his error to him, than detractingly to
blaze it; seek not the advancement of thine own wit by another man's folly;
not always comply with the fortune, and censure him that is down, not event,
nor condemn that as unadvisedly taken which succeeds ill.

PUt not off devotion and the Duties of Religion with want of leisure; nor the
needy, and duties of charity with want of ability; in both, though never so
straightned, thou may do somewhat, though the less; a sigh or a grow in
the one, and a cup of cold water in the other thou thou can not be without.

WHen thou promisest, think thou may be taken at thy word; be nothing in a
word; be nothing in a complement, which thou dare not stand to in earnest:
as there is less sin, so there is less wrong in denying than in not
performing: to deny is at most but a discourtesie; not to perform is an
injury; for if thou denyest, be may seek to others, if thou deceivest, he
fails of all; it is lawful for thee not to promise, it is not lawful for
thee to break promise.

OBserve what is good in any man, and learn it; what is evil, and eschew it,
if any thing good in thy self, to be thankful for it; or evil, if evil of
punishment, to bear it; if evil of sin, to repent of it; not deride any
man's imperfections, but thank God that they are not thine; not to scorn any
friend for an error; but be sorry that he is wrong, and be so much his friend,
as to endeavor to set him right.

FOr a servant ever to speak well of his Master; if ill, to speak the best;
if ill to him, to impute it to his ill deserving, is a duty, yet a
commendations; to think obedience a virtue, not servitude, and that it is not
the least mastery, so far to command ones self, as to be contented to
submit to the command of others.

DO courtesies for others as gifts, not looking for requital; receive
courtesies of others a loanes, and meaning to repay; what favors thou do
for others, to forget them; if thou receivest any, ever to remember them; not
to requite the injuries of an enemy with the like, nor the good turns of a
friend only with the like.

SPeak not censoriously of thy betters, nor scornefully of thy inferiors, not
vain gloriously of thy self, not to boast of thy self that which thou never
did, nor to assume to thy self the praise of that learning and wit, which is
not thine own; not slightly and undervaluingly to speak of other men's
virtues, and not at all of their vices; not to think superciliousnesse
majesty, or a grave reservednesse wisdom, as if thou would be therefore
thought wise, because thou say little; not be a riddle which is rather to
puzzle curiosity, than to benefit society, which man was made for; and
therefore be such rather as men may make use of thee, than be troubled to know
thee.

BE covetous of nothing but of doing good, and be prodigal of nothing but
good counsel; be slow in believing ill of any, but slower in speaking it.

IN place of judicature, look not whose cause comes before thee, but what: and
judge even thy brother, not as a brother, but a Judge: not measure the sentence
by the relation: not sell judgment, nor do a profitable wrong: it will never
repent thee that thou art the poorer for doing right.

BE mild to all, but know when to be severe; there is an unseasonable
meekness; I know not which is worse, to be angry unjustly, or not to be justly
angry; if by the first thou may wrong an innocent person, by the other thou
make a guilty: sometime to be silent at it, is to encourage a fault; it may
be a due chiding would reform that offense which takes heart with sufferance.

Affirm not any thing out of humor, or because thou have affirmed it; it is a
greater disparagement to stand in a lie then to recant an error: to err is but
a weakness, and the case of all; to acknowledge an error is a virtue, and
the praise but of a few: but to maintain an error is a sin, and it is a
greater offense to justify a sin, than to fall into it.

LOve, but not be fond of the body; to love it is a duty, to be fond of it is a
sin: let the fare be such as may neither impare the health of it, nor the
devotion: the apparel neat, not chargeable, not mimically in, nor
ridiculously out of fashion: such as may agree with thy estate, thy years, thy
profession: not at all to invent and slowly to take up a fashion, and that
rather because thou would not be singular, then because thou likest it, and
as may show thee willing to be constant, but not obstinate.

LEt thy recreations be short and diverting, such as may rather fit thee for
business, than rob thee of time: long and tedious sports do rather take away
the stomach to serious things than whet it he that makes recreation a
business, will think business a toil.

SUbmit to every fortune, and like it, not place felicity in wealth and
greatness: to be without, and yet not to want these: or to want, and yet not
desire them: to be able to manage a great estate, and to bear a mean: to
like Gods will even when it crosses thine: cheerfully to pass over crosses,
yet to take notice of them: to be patient, but not without sense: to be
sorrowful but not without hope: not to grow great by corruption, nor to grow
proud with greatness; nor to grow strange to others in a high estate, or
think God so to thee, or you so to him in a mean: not to ebb and flow with
thy condition, and be either supercilious or dejected, to take the changes of
this World without any great change of thy self; he that is contented ever
with what he is, makes himself happy without a fortune.

Think of death as a thing certain, (it may be) at hand: that Physicians dye;
that Kings in this are Subjects: some like crude fruit are plucked off by
casualty, others like over-ripe, drop off with age: old and young, there are
graves of all sizes: to endeavor therefore rather to procure eternal life,
than to prolong this: and use means rather to sweeten death, then to defer
it.

Learn not to think of the things of this world as of things of continuance:
and to use the things of this World, not as an owner, but a Stward: so thou will be neither loath to leave them, nor afraid to account for them.

Do courtesies to thy friend, not with hope to receive greater: and receive
courtesies of thy friend, as if thou had done none: think of requiting the
good which thou receivest, though thou deservest it: expect no requital of
that good which thou do, though undeserved, lest failing of what thou
expectest, thou repent of what thou have done, and so losest the praise of thy
goodness, by looking after the reward of it.

COmmend no man to his face, and censure no man behind his back: if thou
know any good thing of him, tell it others: if any ill, or vice, tell it
himself: so by telling others of his good parts, thou will procure for him a
good opinion: and by telling him and admonishing him of his faults, thou will
make him deserve that good opinion.

Abstain not only from ill, but from the appearance of it, lest thou hear
ill underservedly, or do ill unawares.

LEt thy discourse be neither light nor unseasonable; such as may call either
thy goodness in question, or thy judgment: if thou can not speak well, say
nothing: so it others be not bettered by thy silence, yet they shall not be
made worse by thy discourse.

Think meanly of thine own sufficiency, though others think not so, look
much upon thy defects, and little upon upon thy good parts: and think that
thou art short, not only of what thou ought, but of others: that that which
thou know, is nothing to that of which thou art ignorant: and therefore to
labor rather truly to know thy self, than to make those small parts
superficially known to others.

Scorn not to be bettered by the good example of others, and be careful not
to make others worse with thine; do nothing in which thou would' st not be
imitated: and imitate nothing which thou know is not fit to be done; it is a
fault to do what thou should not, it is none, to learn what thou should
do of any.

Think in the morning what thou have to do this day, and at night what thou
have done: and do nothing upon which thou may not boldly ask Gods blessing:
nor (as near as thou can) nothing for which thou shall need to ask his
pardon: let thy first care be not to do ill: thy next care, to repent of it:
account often with thy self, thy last account will be the less, be not
afraid to look upon thy score, but be afraid to increase it: to despair
because thou art sinful, is to be worse, because thou have been so bad.

Be thy life like his that must
Account, and has it but in trust;
Let the actions of thy youth
Answer not the times, but truth;
Let thy words by modest, few,
Thy opinions firm, not new;
Thy mirth plausible, not vain,
Not abusive, not profane;
Live not only to the eye,
Sin is sin, though none be by;
Witnesses do only prove,
Not make guilty; and true love
Of virtue, more esteems in ought
So to be, then to be thought;
It Is weakness to eschew the scarre.
Not the ulcer, and prefer
Esteem to truth; deeds must be
Such as God approves, not we;
Be in private what you seem
In public view; and not deem
All things lawful, that are hid,
Not what is seen, but what is forbid,
-- is unjust;
And only what we may we must.
BE not wicked with advantage: nor be drawn to do a gainefull sin: not
think that godly which is gainefull, but think that gain enough which is
with godliness: he that makes his commodity the measure of his actions, for a
morsel of bread that man will transgress.

EVer learn to be contented with what thou have, in as much as there is
nothing which by the appointment of God does not happen unto thee: and to
dislike what God does, is to do what God dislikes; and make that a sin,
which was before but a punishment, and, as it might have been used, a blessing:
to find fault with God, is to make a fault in our selves; that which God does
may be harsh, it cannot be unjust: or if that state which thou have be bad, yet
that which thou hopest for, is better.

Think not well of thy self though others think so: yet give no occasion to
any to think otherwise, and give the glory of both to God, both of thy good
parts, and their good opinion.

EVery morning take leave of the things of this world, as thingking thou may
part with them before night: and every night to examine the employment of that
day, as thinking thou may account for it before morning: he that is
providing for his going, will less increase his account by tarrying: we do
not commend his providence, that has his furniture to buy when he should take
horse.

MAke not a neighbors fault greater to men then it is, nor thine own less to
God; to excuse thine own sin is to double it: detractingly to aggravate
another fault, is to make it thine own.

BUfie not thy self in searching into other men's lives; the errors of thine
own are more then thou can answer for: it more concerns thee to mend one
fault in thy self, than to find out a thousand in others.

BE careful not to fall into sin, being fallen, not to lie in it; being
surprised, not to stand in it: confession is some part of satisfaction; by
denying a little sin, thou make it great, by truly confessing a great sin
to God, thou make it none.

IF thou have lived long, think thou have the longer account, think thou have
had the longer time to provide for thy account, and therefore have the greater
sin, if unprovided; where God fort ears a great while, he expects a greater
increase: as where men give long day, they expect larger payment.

Perform not the things of Religion, either out of vain glory, or custom,
since the goodness of these is not measured by what is done, but by what mind
we do it with; Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligently;
there is that curse upon negligent doing, which upon unwilling leaving of it
undone is not; there is little difference between not doing what thou
should, and not doing it as thou should; to do thy duty for show only,
or in show only, is to do thy duty, and be still undutifull: if that which
thou do be right, if the mind with which thou do it be not so, all is
wrong, and thou forfeitest the acceptance of what was good, by the ill
performance.

TWo things do not trouble thy self to know other men's faults, nor other men's
estates: the estate of thine own soul, and the amendment of thine own
faults, let that be thy study; not think any sin less because it is hid:
remember that to him that shall judge theo it is open, and that in the last day
God will not measure his judgment by ours, the day of judgment will condemn
many a man whom we have quitted.

DO not practice Religion in show only, yet show it in thy practice; think no
sin little; nor no good which thou do great, it is from the acceptance of
God that it is good at all: hope for, but not challenge a reward of thy well
doing, yet not for it self, but for what Christ has done; measure thy self
not by what others are, but by what thou ought to be: remember thy sins
with grief, and thy goodness, the one, for that thou have been so bad, the
other, that thou can be no better; and though thou can not attain to
perfection on earth, yet aim at it.

Labor not only to know what thou should be (that most men do) but to be
so; nor at all to know what other men are; thou shall not answer for it: be
careful if thou can, to make others better by thy good counsel, or at
least, not to make them worse by thy example.

BE ever contented with thy present estate, but, if thou can, better it; do
not corruptly thrust thy self into any place; and being in, do nothing that
may thrust thee out; make the execution of thy office, a discharge of thy
conscience, not an improvement of thy estate; and desire any place rather to do
good, then to grow rich: give no bribes to procure an unjust thing, nor take
none to do one: and if thou art in the place of judicature, remember thy
office is to give sentence, but not sell it.

DO not make any sin less by custom: for as men do at first less like
sin, so with continuance they do less feel it, as those that are accustomed
to carry burdens, are less sensible of the weight: and if thou do now the
same things with more ease, do not think that the sin is more light, but
that thou art more hardened: and thy case is so much more desperate, by how want
of sense is nearer to death, than pain: feeling is an argument of life, thou
art a dead member if thou have lost thy feling: but here is the misery, that
thou have lost thy feeling in regard of sin, but not of punishment.

FIx thy desires upon such things as may not shame thee in the obtaining; and
compassethy desires by such means as may not shame thee to own; though that
which thou seek for be good, yet while the way by which thou seek for it
be evil, thou shamest the end by the way; and shamest thy self in the end.

Think no sin little, and make it not great by iteration: what is a
mountain of earth but an accumulation of many little dusts? What is a flood,
but a concurrence of many little drops? a little prick being neglected, may
fester to a Gangreen: by how much that in which thou sinnest is less, by so
much thy sin is the greater, that would dishonor God for so little a
thing.

Think of death as a thing thou must meet with: and of thy life, as a thing
thou must part with: and not to love too well that life, that keeps thee from
a better: nor at all to fear that death that leads thee to a better life:
this life is a journey, and the World an uneasy horse, that with much jolting,
and some falls, brings you to your home, and why art thou unwilling to alight:
love rather that passage that leads to eternal happiness than that life
which keeps thee from it, and not without continual misery.

STudy rather to make thy self fir for any employment and place, than to
think thy self so: and be preferred by thy desert, not by purchase: slip no
lawful means to do thy self good, and use no unlawful; he which grows
great by buying, does likely continue that greatness by selling.

MEasure thy wealth by thy mind, not by thy estate: a contented mind is ever
rich; but measure thy expense by thy estate, not by thy mind; not what thou
would do, but what thou art able to do: think not frugality a
disparagement, nor outrun thy self to keep pace with others: this is to
procure that which thou fear: and least thou should be thought mean, to
become so; many times a slow pace performs that journey, whilst galloping
tires by the way.

LEt thy thoughts be such to thy self, as thou art not ashamed to have God
know them: and thy words such to God, as thou art not afraid to have men hear
them; and let thy whole life be such toward God and man, as that thou neither
dishonor God by thy ill life, nor draw others to the same dishonor of him by
thy ill example.

PLeasure not thy self by wronging others: nor with the unjust Steward, make
thee friends with other men's moneys: lest while thou would buy other
friends, thou sell God; come to promotion, if thou can by friends, not by
money: if thou deservest it not, thou wrongest others: if thou deserve it, thou
wrongest thy self.

THe goodness of the mind, is witnessed in the outward actions: the goodness
of the outward actions, is determined by the intention and mind: inward
goodness without outward shows of it, is like a Tree without fruit, useless:
and outward shows of goodness, without inward sincerity, is like a Tree
without heart, livelesse; that thou art good inwardly in thy heart, is thine
own comfort: that thou do ontwardly profess this goodness in thy life, is
others benefit; thou thy self art not the better for that good nesse which
thou do not make show of, others are not the better for that goodness of
which thou make no show: so inward sincerity is required in respect of God,
outward profession only in respect of men: by the first thou art a true
Christian; by the other it does appear that thou art so

NEither undertake much, nor talk much, and that to the purpose; deliver thy
mind rather in profitable language, than curious; by this, happily, thou will
gain more applause, but by the other thou will do more good, and it is a
greater virtue to do well, than to hear well.

DO nothing which thou disallowest; disallow thy self some things which thou
may do, but nothing which thou ought to do: give no liberty to thy
selse in unlawful things: use not the utmost of that liberty which is given
thee in other things; and so use thy liberty in what thou art permitted, as
that they may not hinder thee in the things thou art commanded.

PRomise nothing which may prejudice thee in performance; perform what thou
have promised, though to thy prejudice; think thy self bound by thy word,
though without oath or witness: if thou art not well able to perform, consider
thou were able not to promise: a good man measures his promises by his ability,
but he measures his performance by his promise.

ACcount it the greatest knowledge truly to know thy selse; and the greatest
conquest to subdue thy self: not give way to thine own lusts; not boast of
thine own parts: to do nothing that is ill, nor vainegloriously to tell of
what thou do well: in all things to approve thy self a good man and a
Christian, but not boast of it.

PLace not Religion in talk only, it is an easier matter to give counsel,
than to follow it: sometimes we have known men to fall into those sins from
which they have with great pains converted others: but Christianity (as we say
of charity) begins at home; it was Christ's to S. Peter, Art thou converted?
strengthen the Brethren, but first be converted himself; he may happily save
others that is not saved himself, yet he will sooner save another that goes
in the way of salvation himself: good Doctrine is weakened much with ill life;
he that will do good upon others, must first be good himself.

Speak nothing which thou would wish to recall: and do nothing which thou
shall need to repent: condemn nothing in a humor; nor maintain nothing out
of faction; never defend a false cause, either to revenge a wrong, or to do a
pleasure.

Think only the present time thine, for that which is past is none of thine:
and that which is to come, it is a question whether ever it shall be thine: so
the certain time of thy life is very little, and the account which thou shall
certainly give of this life very great; and thy account is made greater by
tarrying, but thy life less; so that to put off the finishing of this account,
till a farther time, is to make thy self a greater account, and have less
time to do it in; nay thou shall answer for the neglect of that time wherein
it might have been done, and it may be denied another time to do it.

MEasure not goodness by good words only, a Parrat may be taught to speak
well; good words cost us nothing; and men are for that Religion that is
cheapest: it is an easy matter to speak like a Christian: Satan himself can
talk Scripture: Charity consists not barely in knowing, or discoursing of what
is good, but in practicing what we do know; in religion not to do as thou
say, is to unsay thy religion in thy deeds.

EVer expect death, though not wish for it; let thy last hour find thee rather
willing to go, than contented to tarry; put not off amendment till another
day, thou art not sure to see an end of this; provide that thy death bed amy
rather find thee fitted for God, than fit thee; and so order thy estate, and
thy soul in thy health, that when death comes thy may have nothing to do
but to die.

IN point of reformation, first pluck out thy own More: spend not thy time in
exhorting others to the keeping of the Commandments, and break them thy
self; measure not thy goodness by another want of it: nor measure thy want
of goodness by others store of it; God does not so: though thou art not so
good as the best, yet while thou endeavourest to be so, thou art good enough;
God who works in us both to will and to do, does in some case accept the will
for the deed.

REckon nothing which thou have, thine own; nor nothing which thou do, at
thine own disposing: and use all, not as a Master, but a servant, remembering
thou must one day answer for them to their Master.

DO not murmr at thy condition, if mean; nor measure Gods blessings by thy
wants, but by thy deserts: if God be better to others then he is to thee, yet
while he is better to thee than thou deservest, he is good enough.

IN Christianity, not, think to attain the end without the means; and if the
same means do not in all produce the same effect, not to impute it to any
alteration or deficiency in the means; but in the subject: the means is the
same, the parties are not: all men are not alike hardened in sin, therefore all
are not alike hard, or easy to be converted; sins are compared to diseases;
all diseases are not mortal, some humors spend themselves, others are not
recovered, but with expense and danger; and the same sickness is not removed
with the same ease in bodies, because there is not in all the same temper: that
physic does but stir the humor in some bodies, which in others would
utterly expel it: it is with the sickness of the soul, as of the body, all
sins are not equal; all men are not equally sinful: either the sins may
be less, or of less continuance: for custom, as it begets a greater liking
of sin, so it leaves a deeper root; continuation of things makes them partly
natural, therefore we call custom another nature; settled impieties, like set
led humors do not easily ftirre; though the means are the same, yet while the
subjects is not; it is no wonder that the effects are not: there must be the
same disposition of the matter, as well as of the agent: it is nor enough that
the word be the same, if the hearers be not; as as the same physic does not
work or cure alike, nor the same seed thrive alike in all grounds, so neither
does the same word save alike, or prevail alike withal. Sodom would have
repented with those means which Corazin did not; in thine impenitency
therefore not to accuse God or the means, but thine own self; in thy
conversion, not to thank thine own self, or the means, but God, and the
means under God.

REnember that as there is ^e death which thou must prepre to meet, so there is
another death which thou must study to avoid, the death of the soul; the
natural death consists in the dissolution of the soul from the body, the
spiritual death, in the dissolution of the soul from God: and one day, of
soul and body from God, which is the second death: now as we say of the
natural body, that the way to be young long, is to be old betimes; so the way
to live not long, but ever, is to die betimes; if thou die but once while thou
live, the death of sin; thou shall live eternally after tou art dead.

LOve nothing in this world too well, no not thy self; think of the pleasures
of this World, either as sins or occasions of it; and the other more
necessary things of it; though they have thy presence, let them not have thy
heart; and use them rather because thou want them, than because thou likest
them: and so provide, that thy death may be the beginning of thy happiness,
not the end of it.

Ever suspect, ever fear
For to be too happy here;
Left in heaven thou have less,
(If any) for this happiness;
Seldom have I known
To have Heavens more then one;
All the pleasures of this life
They are useful, but a knife:
I may warm me by their fire,
But take heed of coming nigher;
Yet in this is danger still,
He that warmes, is after chill;
Oh JEHOVAH, but with thee,
Is there true felicity,
All this sublunary treasure
Yield but counterfeit of pleasure;
Silken cares, Kings of clouts;
Full of torments, fears, and doubts;
Trifles, dangers, baited books,
Sha dowes, only shape and looks,
Of what we call: worse than naughts?
Snares; temptation, if not faults;
Whether it be birth, or place;
Beauty, and the pride of face;
Honor; wealth, or higher yet,
That they call a favorite;
Like a shadow on the Sun,
Have their being, and are done,
From another like or frown;
So they rise, and so go down;
They are got and kept with fears;
And are parted with, with tears;
And accounted for with borror,
And then Dives is the poorer;
When the final day shall come;
(A dreadful day indeed to some)
And we answer for their use.
Then to want them we would choose;
So then much of these to ask,
Is to beg thy se^f a task,
A beggary, for thus to be
Is the greatest poverty:
All thou have is on the score,
What is that but to be poor?
Add to this, it does not last;
And happiness is torment, passed.
It may be present, so thy host
Is but may be at the most:
In Heaven only is there bliss,
That ever shall be, ever is;
Worldly laughter is not mirth,
Born and buried in the birth;
Where O God there wants thy grace
Mirth is only in the face,
O God thou art, only thou,
To morrow, yesterday, and now;
To thee my self, my time I give,
All that I have, all that I live,
DEliberately to move to any business is proper to man: headily to be carried
by desired, is common to beasts; in civil actions be led by thy reason, not by
thy appetite; in divine action, by Religion; and do nothing that may forfeit
either thy reason or thy honesty: measure the goodness of things by their
lawfulness not by their profit; nor be drawn to do ill for advantage: not
intend thy particular good, with the forfeiture of the genreall.

IN religion publish nothing which thou datest not stand to; nor libell against
the truth: if thou think it is not the truth, why do thou publish it? if
thou think it is the truth, why art thou ashamed of it? such are between two
rocks, either of which splits them; for either they sin in publishing that
which is a lie; or else having published it, they sin in being ashamed or
afraid to stand to it, which they think is the truth: true Gold flies not the
Touchstone, a good man's actions are such as he fears not to be discovered; it
is a sign their works are ill, when they dare not own them; Oderunt lucem, is
our Saviors note of such; if it be the truth, they ought not only (in some
case) to own it, but to die in it: if it be a lie, they ought not to live in
it, much less to give it life: every lie is a sin, but to print a lie, is to
justify a sin; and in Religion to print a lie for truth, is to father a lie
upon God: a good man will publish nothing in God's name, to which he dares not
set his own.

MEasure not thy self by what men say of thee; they may mistake thee; it is
their sin, not thine if others slander thee: to be ill spoken of, and
undeser vedly, is neither thy fault, nor alone thy case; Christ himself was
thought a Wine bibber: and Saint Paul mad: if ill tongues could make men ill,
good men were in ill taking; never regard what any can say against thee, but
thine own conscience: though all the World condemn thee, while God and thy
self do not, thou art innocent enough: the wickedness of ill tongues does
but dirt themselves; the mire that is cast upon thee is not thine; care not to
have ill men speak well of thee; it may be if thou were worse, thou wouldeft
hear better: Parcit cognatis maculis similis fera: the Devil does not accuse
his own: if thou were one if them they would speak more favorably: be
careful to be clean to God, what ever thou art to the world, and be slow in
soyling and blacking others: if they are not so clean as thou could wish,
their foulness be to themselves: let them be never the fouler for thy mouth:
they that are forward in censuring and accusing others, are usually such
themselves.

TO all thy promises need no other bond but thy word: nor no other witness but
God: be careful never to promise any thing of which thou shall wish to be
forgiven the performance: nor plead either want of ability or testimony: an
honest man does not promise more than he means: nor a wise man more than he
is able.

BE not a servant to those things which thou should command; thy money, thy
body, and thy appetite, or thy sensitive part: but use thy estate, to serve thy
body, and thy occasions, and thy body to be subservient to thy soul; and thy
soul to serve God: thus while either of these serve in their proper office,
God is served in all: if thou art commanded by the first of these, thou art
neither thine own Master, nor fit to be God's servant.

REsolve nothing but upon good ground, nor alter thy resolution but upon good
reason; not inconstantly to waver, nor obstinately to persevere in things; to
hear others judgments besides thine own, and if right, to submit to them; not
to think it a disparagement, that there are wifer than thy self: to think it
a fault rather to stand in an error, than to fall into one, not choose to
defend a lie, rather than descend to yield to others it that which is the
truth: to maintain an opinion because it is thine, not because it is true, is
to maintain thy self, not the truth; and to prefer thy self to the truth.

SO far intend thy profit as that thou still subject it to your religion; not
make thy commodity the stern of the conscience; he was not the best Disciple
that had the bag; so procure or continue to thy self a place upon earth, as
that thou lose not thy place in heaven.

Learn not to examine thy self by what thou art not; as the Pharisee, not
like other men; and while some others are worse, to think thou art well
enough: we measure crooked things by that which is straight, not by that which
is more crooked: the rule of goodness is Gods Word, not other men's deeds: not
to measure the straightness of thy life, by the crookedness of another: he
that measures his beauty by another deformity, may still be unhandsome enough:
if a Drunkard shall measure himself by some debauchednesse, he will seem a
sober man: in the day of judgment, God will not examine thee by what others
were, but by what thou were commanded to be.

PLead not for licenciousness of life, under liberty of conscience; as if
Christian liberty consisted in doing what they lift: or that Christ has so
freed thee from the yoke of the Law, as that thou art not still subject to the
commandments; not think that Christ was therefore obedient unto the death,
that thou should be tied to no obedience of any thing during life; that the
merits of our Redeemer has obtained; not that the Commandments of God should
not still be observed; but that tho not sufficient observing of them, should not
be imputed.

MAke not other men's sins thine by imitating them; nor thine, other men's, by
teaching of them, do nothing in which thou would not be followed; follow
nothing of which thou can not well justify the doing.

AFfect not too much business, especially other men's; yet to hate idleness:
to use recreations, but not dwell in them: to affect rather what is needful
than curious; not to overdoe; and in all these things to suffice nature, not
humor it.

BE slow in choosing a friend, but slower in changing him when thou have
chosen: be courteous to all, but inward only with a few: thou may use that
freedom to a friend, which thou will not to every acquaintance: thy
acquaintance is but thy neighbor, but thy friend is thy self.

Scorn no man for his meanness, and humor no man for his wealth; do nothing
to please any whereby thou shall displease God: never be drunk to please the
company, or think it uncivility to part sober: or to cease to be a good
Christian, that thou may be thought a good companion.

BE displeased with nothing which God does, and as near as thou can, do
nothing wherewith God is displeased, do all thou do as in Gods presence,
and speak all as in his audience; and let neither thy words nor actions be
such, as to which thou may willingly desire Gods absence, or not desire his
assistance.

IT is the goodness of God to us, that is the cause of the love of God to us:
and it is the goodness of God in us, that is the cause of the love of God in
us: confess that the good which thou receivest is not for thine own sake, nor
the good which thou do is not by thine own power; it is the mercy of God
that mooves him to do for us; that inables us to do that which pleases him.

ACcount that good which is lawful, not which is profitable: and endeavor
rather to serve God then thine own turn in all; make these two the rule of
thy self, justice and godliness, and thou shall fulfill the duties of both
Tables, God and thy neighbor.

NOt repiningly to complain of thy sufferings of this life: since it is partly
in thy power to make them blessings: and if to make them blessings be in thine
own power, then that they are otherwise it is thy own fault: God intends
amendment in it, if it do not amend thee, thou make it a punishment, not be.

Labor to see thy own mortality in other men's deaths: and thy own frailty in
other men's sins; and since thou must shortly die, be afraid to sin: and so
order thy sins, as thou may not be afraid to die, that thy sins do not
bring thee to a worse death, and that this death may lead thee to a better life.

Do what thou art commanded, not what others do: make no man's example a rule,
not the best man's: all may err: and be that in all things follows him that
may err, will be sure in some things to fall into error.

CAll to mind often what thou have done: and then compare with it what thou
have suffered, and what thou have received: and when thou shall find, that
thou have received more good than thou have done, and have done more evil than
thou have suffered: fear that there is less good behind for thee, and more
evil: and therefore betake thee to repentance and a new life: and by that thou
may prevent the evil which thou have deserved to suffer, and procure to thy
self, though not deserved, a reward of that good which thou have done.

LEt it not trouble thee that some others have lived longer than thy self; not
the length of thy life, but the goodness is the measure of thy happiness: if
thou have lived well, thou have lived long enough; if thou have not lived well,
thou have lived too long.

NEver think it too soon to repent, thou do not know how soon thou may
die, and after death it it too late: he that puts off his amendment with hope
of living, loses eternal life in a presumption of this.

INtend rather the effecting of a public good, than a particular, for by
intending only thy particular good, thou may do wrong to the public,
whereas thou can not effect a public good without thine own good in
particular; for what ever is beneficial to the whole, cannot be prejudicial
to the parts: so then thou being a member of the whole in performing a general
good, even by that thou art so far good to thine own particular, as thou
have an interest in the general; whereas by seeking thy private good with the
neglect of the public, thou do both decline from the common nature of
things and from the nature of goodness, which is by so much the more good, by
bow much it is good to more, and do rather that, which is good to thee, then
what is truly good in it self: this is to make thine own self and thy
advantage the rule of goodness, that thou should make goodness the rule of
thy self and thy actions.

Think that in death thou do not lose a life, but exchange one; death is
but a change; and therefore not to fear a change, that art every day so
acquainted with changes; every change is a kind of death, in as much as that
which it changes from, does die to what it was: if the beasts and creatures
themselves did not change from what they are, how should we be fed? Nay, if
their skins and clothing did not change from its natural use to them, how
could it be useful to us: if the Sun his self did not change his place; if
the Year, and the parts of the Year, did not change, how should we either
have life or necessaries? thou then that do thus subsist by changes, why
do thou fear a change? especially considering that other things being ever
altering in themselves, do yet ever continue alterable; whereas we changing
but once, and for the better, shall ever after remain immutable: so that to
be loath to change, is to contradict what thou do: to fear a change, and
yet love a life that is full of changes.

IF God has made thee handsome, let not that make thee proud: beauty is an
ornament, do not thou make it a snare: why should thou have cause to wish
that thou had been ill favored: show nothing naked of thy self to others
but thy face, and that only that thou may be known, not seen: be
courteous to all but not familiar: stay not to hear thy handsomnesse praised:
much less to praise it: think no time so ill spent about thy self, as in
dressing: nor no money, as in fashions, yet in neither be ridiculous, allow
for both: acknowledge no beauty in thy self, but of the mind, nor strive for
none: if God have made thee beautiful in others eyes, let it be thy care to
make thy selse so in his: beauty without grace, is the greatest deformity.

IN Gods house and business forget thine own: be there as a member of the
Church, not of the Commonwealth: empty thy self of this world, thou art
conversant in the next: let all thy senses have no other object but God: let
thy ears be open, but thy eyes shut: if another beauty draw thy eyes from
God, that beauty is become thy deformity, and has turned God's eyes from thee.

LOve no woman but a wife, and use no familiarity with her, but in public:
thou know not whither it may grow; many have thought no hurt in the
beginning of those things that after have proceeded to impiety; and in all thy
behavior, examine not what thou do, but with what mind thou do it, else
that which happily in it self was indifferent, is to thee unlawful: to a good
mind, all company is safe, and all familiarity is safe.

It Is the mind that makes a fault,
Else such things would not be naught;
He that can (and is no ly^)
Sport and talk without a fire;
Can be courteous, can be kind,
And not kindle in his mind;
And can touch a woman's skin
As his own, not stir within:
Does salute without delight,
And more would not, if he might,
Nor scarce that; whom thus to bill
Manners treacheth, not his will:
Nor with hand, nor lip, nor eye,
Does commit aduliery;
But see and salute each other
Woman as he does his mother;
As the Nurses harmless kiss
To her child is, such is his,
Without pleasure, without taste,
With a mind, a thought as chaste
As Turtle; till thy mind be such,
Do nor look, nor sport, nor touch,
Or at least till this thou can,
Sport, and talk, and play with man;
Not with woman, for ^f fair,
Thou will findk, or make a snare;
Nay, although thy mind be such,
Do not toy, nor sport, nor touch;
For although thy thoughts be good,
Yet thoughts are not understood
But by actions; so therein
May be scandal, if not sin:
Who exactness will fulfill,
Must forbear things seeming ill,
Not that are, but might have been,
Or that may be construed sin:
Men judge thee ill or innocent,
By what is seen, not what is meant:
Then until all minds be such
Think a look, a smile to much.
LOve thy neighbor as thy self in the kind, unfainedly; but love thy friend
as thy self in the degree: do as much as thou can, but love more then thou
can do; he that does but little for his friend, because his ability is so,
loves more, than he which does much, but less than he is able.

REvenge no injury though thou can; and requite every courtesy if thou
can: yet show that thou art willing to requite a courtesy where thou art
able: and show that thou art able to revenge a wrong (if thou can) though
thou art not willing; so by showing that thou could revenge this, thou will
happily prevent another; and by not revenging it thou will prove thy self
better then thou shewst; for to revenge a wrong done is to do a wrong to God;
so thou will be guilty of doing that which thou complainest of, and therefore
unjustly complainest of that which thou thy self do.

LEt thy conceit of thy self be low, but thy desires high, even as high as
heaven; think thy self not worthy of the least good, yet by the grace of God
capable of the greatest: think often upon Christ's death, it will sweeten
thine; and account it his, he accounts it so: he died not for himself, but for
thee, and if thou live not to thy self, but to him, then he lives not for
himself neither, but for thee, to make thee partaker of eternal life, which
already thou have in the certainty, though not in the fruition, and believe
all this and more, very humbly, but very confidently.

THat thou may avoid sin, avoid the occasion of it as he that complains of
heat removes farther from the fire: omit no opportunity of doing good: and do
no evil though thou have opportunity, it is a greater commendations of thy
goodness, that thou might and would not.

MEditate often upon thy death, thou will like it the better: and often upon
the next life, thou will like this the worse: think of this World as a thing
in trust, and provide to discharge it: account nothing thine own but as being
shortly to give an account of it to the right owner.

BE not angry without cause, be merry without offense: admit a seasonable
anger: and shun an unseasonable jest: be moderate in both: do not forget thy
self in thy anger, nor thy friend in thy mirth: by the one thou will be
burdensome to thy self, by the other to the company.

LOve the body, but subordinate to the soul: the Tenant is more noble than the
house: the most beautiful body is but a body of earth: and the jewels which
adorn it are but stones in the earth: and the gold and silver which it prides
in, are veins in this earth; the clothes which thou wearest, were the
clothing of some beast, or the labor of some Worm, or at the best, of a man
like thy self: think then with what vile things thou art made fine: which yet
do but make thee so in the esteem of others, not truly so in thy self: and
do but hide those parts which thou art ashamed to show, not adorn that inner
part which does truly show thee: therefore to be so much a Christian to
prefer that part which thou have common with Christ in respect of his humane
nature, thy reasonable soul: or so much a man, not to prefer that part which
thou have common with the beast, an earthly body.

IF thou art a Master, let thy family beaw'd rather by thy example, then thy
word: be angry for small faults it will prevent greater: commend and encourage
those that do well, they will do better: commendations of former goodness is
a provocation to more.

Think upon this life as a current, ever running: do not hope to live long,
but be assured not to live still, and account it thy comfort that thou shall
one day dye: to wish thy self ever upon earth, is to wish thy self ever out
of heaven.

BE employed only in such ways as thou would not blush to be met in:
Thamar goes disguised, when to play the harlot: tell nothing of another which
thou would not have told him: believe nothing of another which thou may
not tell: do not construe seriously what is spoken but in jest, and forbear
those jests, which may be construed to earnest: hear no ill of a friend, but
reply; and speak no ill, though of an enemy.

IN thy house, let thy entertainment be free, not costly; bid thy friends
welcome to thy ability, not beyond it; never make one meal so, as thou must
be feign to fetch it up out of many: be hospitable, but provident: think
nothing too much for thy friends, which is not too much for thy estate:
hospitality bids thy friends welcome; and providence makes thee able to bid
them welcome: if hospitality be the life of neighborhood, providence is the
life of hospitality: he is not thy friend that expects more than thou art well
able; thou art not thine own friend if thou do less, to live above thy
means is folly; to live too far below thy means, is a disparagement: do all
like thy self, so as may neither weaken thy respect, nor thy estate.

LOve not ill company, lest thou learn, the ill of the company; it is hard,
not to be like the company thou keep: it is rare, if we deny not Christ in
Caiphas his house; with Solomon, it is hard having the Ethiopian without her
Idols: we see people change their complexion with the Climate: Vessels smell
of the liquor they contain: by ordinary communication in the ways of sinners
without a great deal of care you will communicate with their sin: With the
froward thou will learn frowardness: he that goes to the meetings of wicked
men, will come a wicked man out: or to say the best, worse than he went in: for
thy conversation, let this be thy rule, if thy company be better, imitate them;
if worse, convert them: if equal, and as thou art, join with them.

FEed the poor often at thy dooro, sometime at thy Table; whatsoever thou
give to Christ in his members, he will one day give back again to thee in
thy person: it is but just if God deny thee thy daily bread, if thou daily deny
him the crumbs.

LEt it not trouble thee what is talked of thee when thou art absent, more then
what will be talked of thee when thou art dead: an ill report does not make
thee an ill man; be careful to do no nothing that deserves to be ill spoken
of, let it not trouble thee to be ill spoken of undeservedly.

LEt thy prayers be frequent, thy wants are so; and thy thanksgivings
frequent, thy blessings are so: pray daily at home, and if thou can, at
Church: God is every where, but there he has promised to be; miss not the
confession and abosolution, unless thou have no sins to confess, or carest
not to be forgiven them.

Think not the worse of the ordinances of God for the sins of the Preacher;
those that are ill themselves, may yet be instruments of good to other;s God
has promised his blessing to the thing, not to the person; the sacrifices of
Elies sons were effectual for the people; it is not the peoples fault that
the Preacher is wicked, and as it is without their fault, so it is without
their prejudice; it was our blessed Saviors of the Pharisees, After their
sayings do ye; we must follow their sayings whose deeds we may not; thou
may not refuse the word of God from any, if they teach what they should,
though they do not what they teach, the wickedness of the messenger does not
abate the power of the means, as the intemperance and debauchednesse of the
Physician does not hinder the working of the Physic.

REmember often that thou art a Christian, and do nothing that may disprove it;
be not a law to thy self, but be regulated by that which is a law to us all,
the Word of God, study not how much to make thy life longer, but better;
consider that the longer thou art here, here, the longer thou art from God; let
it be thy care rather to lead a good life than a long; endeavor to thy ability
to do well, and grieve that thou can not do better; do not wrong to
others; forgive the wrongs which others do thee; strive what thou can to
keep a good name, but rather a good conscience; if men mistake thee, comfort
thy self that God which shall reward thee, does not; look upon the
necessities of others, not as a stranger, but a member, as thou would have
God look upon thine; be good to all, God is so; but with a difference;
Especially to the household of faith; cherish no sin in thy self, and
countenance none in another: acquaint thy self rather with the commandments
of God, than the decrees; and conclude of thy salvation to thy self, rather by
a diligent observing of his revealed will, than by searching into his secret
will: let not the changes of this World, to preferment or want, make thee
either sond of thy life, or weary of it: be contented to live, but be desirous
to die, To be dissolved and to be with Christ; And though thy body be not
yet in heaven, let thy heart be there.

LEt thy first care be to be good thy self, thy next care to make others so:
be not a Christian in show only, yet in every thing show thy self a Christian;
do nothing but what is good, and speak nothing but what is truth: he is the
best Christian that speaks well, and does as he speaks.

He is the true and real Christian whose
Most holy words are seconded with deeds;
Who lives Religion over, and well knows
Christianity consists not all in creeds;
Pinns not his life, nor faith to others sleeve,
Believes what is writ, and lives as he believes.
Slow to revenge a wrong; not to forgive;
Whose goodness is not only to the eye;
Thinks rather how to die, than how to live;
And yet is dead to sin before he die:
And who lives here on earth, and dies to sin;
When he is dead his life does but begin.
Who does not what he likes, but what he may;
And asks, what may I, to, not of himself,
But of Religion and the Scriptures say,
Who is his own rule, runs upon a shelfe;
Who though he might, he would not be deboise
Is good, not of necessity, but choice.
That makes not opportunity his bawd;
(Occasion sometime does invite a sin)
To may and will not, is the Christians laud;
He Is guilty that is out and would be in;
But being tempted, or but not withstood
Not to be evil it a double good.
That can revenge a wrong, but does forbear it,
And to be slow to malice, is not sloth;
Speaks only what is truth, but will not swear it;
Nor second every trisle with an oath;
That likes no vice though followed with a throng
Who measure truth by voices does it wrong.
Some good he does, yet sain he would do more;
To would be better is an act of grace;
His mind is rich to Christ, his power is poor;
God mend his power, and he will mend his pace:
Mean time God likes the will, and in his Son
What we would do, is in th'acceptance done.
If yet he do, (as who did never ill,
Who is without his errors?) yet is this
The error of his frailty, not his will:
He does indeed, but grieves to do amiss;
To sigh and grieve for what we cannot do,
Is to come short, and yet to do it to.
You Will say them Christianity is hard,
What good was ever easy? where the gains
Are greatest, likely there the way is barred;
Double renown is bad with double pains:
Who so does follow Christ, does pitch a field,
It Is less praise not to fight, than not to yield.
Worldly advancements are not had with case;
And want is the inheritance of sloth:
Would thou do less for heaven than for these?
It Is fit who would have one, he should have both
The gain with hardness, thus it is les hard;
The danger's great, and so is the reward.
LEt it trouble thee more to do a fault, than to hear of it: if thou art ill
spoken of by another; first call thy self to account; before him, it may be
thou deservest it: be more sorry that it is true, then that it is known; if
false, it is not thy fault that thou art belied; it is thy comfort that it is a
lie: do not think to be ever free from censure, here, not sometimes from
faults: he is the best man that erres seldomest, he is more then a man that
never errer.

IN Religion receive no opinion upon credit, and vent none upon discontent: be
of that opinion that may save thee, rather then that may raise thee; let not
the doors of thy lips move upon the hinges of another man's tongue; speak what
thou think, not what others speak; so follow good men, as remembering they
are but men; go rather the way which you ought, than the way that is gone;
make others companions but not copies, or so far copies as they agree with the
Original.

TAke whatsoever God does, thankefully; and do whatsoever he commands
cheerfully; labor to make a good use of ill accidents: hate every man's sin,
love every man's person, and love no man's sin for the persons sake.

Fear rather to do ill, than to suffer for thy ill doing: he that truly
fears sin shall never fear punishment; think upon the goodness of God, and
thou will love him, and think upon the justice of God, and thou will fear
him, and so by consequence, love that which may free thee from this fear: and
so between these two, thou will fear to do any thing against him whom thou
love, and thou will (at least) not love to do any thing against him for fear.

IF the actions of another reflect to thy harm, examine not what is done, but
what was intended; and if he intended no ill, think he has done thee none,
though in effect he have; willingly do no wrong. wink at those wrongs that are
unvillingly done thee, God does so, and measures what we do by what we mean
to do: he that shot at a mark and killed a man, by the Law of God was not
held a murderer: God works in us both to will and to do, as he does
sometimes accept the will for the deed; so be does usually measure the deed by
the will.

DO not easily entertain a friend, nor easily part with him; think him no true
friend whom one injury can make thineenemy; or that accounts every error an
injury; he must have no friends, that will have a friend with no faults: make
no man thine enemy by doing him wrong; become not an enemy to every one that
wrongs thee, account every man thy neighbor, though thine enemy, that needs
thee.

IN Religion look to the end but by the means; think not to partake of what
God has promised, but by doing in some measure what he has commanded: though
heaven be had without our desert, yet it is not had without our pains; then
may thou hope that God will be as good as his word to thee, when thou
sincerely endeavourest to be as good as his Word commands thee to be toward
him.

DO nothing which is ill, nor every thing which is lawful; measure not thy
liberty by the lawfulness of the thing, but the expediency; many times an
unseasonable good, though it be not ill in it self, yet it is in the occasion
of it; he which will at no time forbear to do something which he may, will at
sometime do something which he may not.

BE content to hear of another praises before thee without repining; and to
tell of another praises without detracting: to speak well of all men, or not
at all: for as it is flattery of speak that good of another which is false: so
it is detraction, to speak that ill of another unnecessarily which is true.

FOrgive the wilful injuries of any, yet tell him of them, by showing him of
his fault, thou show him his duty; do not love him less for it, but trust
him less: but if he be thoroughly sorry for it: be thou thoroughly satisfied; God
asks no more for thine: consider that to suffer wrongs is common to thee with
Christ; and to forgive wrongs proper to thee as a Christian: God does suffer
such wrongs to be, that he may exercise thy patience: and he commands thee to
forgive those wrongs, that thou may exercise thy charity.

SO live as thou may not be afraid to die, as thou may be assured of a
better life after death: do nothing which shall need an excuse, or fear a
witness, and so use this world, as remembering you must account for it in the
next.

LEt thy discourse be ever of goodness, but not of thine own: or of the
good, which thou have received of God, not which thou have done: if thy talk
be good, thou do at once both show goodness, and teach it.

BE good without much noise: be provident without perplexednesse: be merry
without lightness: be bountiful without wast: live to the benefit of all,
but to the service only of God.

If now thou act not perfect yet with these,
(As where is there perfection here below)
Yet they may do enough to make thee please,
God accepts what we can, for what me owe;
Whilst thou endeavour'st to be what tho should,
If thou want power, it is enough tho would.
The clearest water is not free from mud;
The Sun is not exempted from ^lips;
Here our perfection is but mingled good;
And he is more then man that never slips:
In all we do, we something do amiss,
And our perfection imperfection is.
For the condition of our present plight
Is, that we would he better than we are,
Not a perfection ever but a height,
And we are good, but not without a scarre;
All things are like our selves, a mixture, then
God does not look that we should not be men.
FINIS.
GLORIA DEO.
