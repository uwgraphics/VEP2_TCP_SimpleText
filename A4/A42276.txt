THE TRANSLATORS EPISTLE TO THE READER.
AMongst many other times that I have had the honor to wait upon his Royal
Majesty, who now lives (and whom God long preserve, and speedily restore to
all his Due Rights and Praerogatives, I humbly beseech him) it was my fortune
once to attend him, when a young Nobleman that was then going to travel, came
to kiss his Majesty's hand, and to take his leave of him. To whom the King was
graciously pleased to give this sound though succinct council, My Lord, keep
always the best company, and be sure never to be Idle. As King James of
blessed memory, did deservedly entitle his Book dedicated to the then so
hopeful Prince Henry ASILIKONand gr; DOPON A Kingly gift. I think I may
safely style this his Sons advice, ASILIKON OYAA A kingly Council. It does
indeed contain very much in very little; I am sure it made such impression in
me, as I hope shall not quickly be effaced. Cum his versare qui te meliorem
facturi sunt (says Seneca) And where is this conversation better to be had
then in the best company? Dimmi con quien tu vai, e sapro quel che fai, says
the Spaniard. There is no better touchstone whereby to know the worth of a
man's actions, then to observe what company he usually keeps. Our English
Seneca (Doctor Hall) says; Next to being good, it is good to converse with them
that are so: if we be not bettered by their example, we are blessed by their
protection, and as for Idleness, the same man says The idle man has neither
leisure, nor power to avoid sin.

To apply this to my self, and to the occasion, since it has pleased Almighty
God to seat me in such a condition, as for the present and for some years last
past, I am not only debarred the attendance upon his Majesty (a happiness
which from his infancy and mine, till of late years, I have enjoyed) but also
am inhibited to sit and vote in the house of Peers, (the next best of
Companyes) for having obeyed his Majesty's command, upon no less penalty then
the forfeiture of my allegiance; and for not having obeyed the Summons of the
House of Lords, when I was not in a condition or capacity of doing so, (A fault
which me thinks, and I wish I could persuade others to think so too, Five
years deprivation of birthright might be able to expiate) I have betaken my
self to converse with Books, which if good in themselves, certainly are no
bad company. Amongst these, lighting upon this my Author (which if not too much
injured by my Translation, I presume may be admitted into the number of good
books) that I might the better evade Idleness (the Kings second Cautelous
Council) and that I might in some sort be serviceable, to my Country, since I
am not permitted to be so, the way I would; I betook my self to put it into
our Idiome, and have now adventured it, and my judgment in the Choice thereof,
to the censure that usually waits upon the press. The subject thereof is
War inter-laced with other occurrences; as Treatyes, Leagues, Embassies,
Counsels, Discourses, Geographicall descriptions of Countries, and Rivers,
Comments upon actions, Characters. etc. The War here treated of, is, that
which has befalne Germany, France, Italy, Flanders, Holland, Lorreine,
Piemont, Liege, Montferrat the Grisons, and other adjacent parts of so late
times, as there is none who has arrived at maturity of years, but may
remember somewhat of them, and whose ears have not been acquainted with the
Names of the Princes, and other chief Personages, herein mentioned; so as it
may serve to recall into their memoryes, that little which they may have heard
thereof before; and complete their understandings with the full and
satisfactory knowledge of what may not as yet have been so perfectly delivered
unto them. And all this in a well-woven History, which may be termed a Tragedy,
the Scean, Christendom, the Actors, the Princes; and as many as have been
famous in this our age as well for the conduct of Civil, as of Martial
affairs. There is a second volumne of this History already published by the
Author: whether I shall trace him in that or no lam not yet resolved; according
as this shall take I may be more or less, persuaded thereunto. But if my
Author proceed further upon this subject, and consequently fall upon our
troubles (for his second part ends just where our miseries began) he must
pardon me if I tread no farther in his foote-steps, since they are such as I
could wish were rather buried in Oblivion then recorded unto memory; being by
all parties, interessed, acknowledged to be unnatural. The Lord of his
infinite mercyes put a Happy a spedy, and a lasting period unto them: and let
all true hearted Englishmen say, Amen. And that I may persuade them so to do,
by putting their helping hand to an happy accommodation, I shall refer them
to what Guicchiardin says. In tutte le attioni humane e nelle guerre
massimamente, bisogna spesso accommodare il consiglio alla necessita, ne per
ottenere quella part ch' e troppo difficile e quasce impossible, esporre il
tutto a manifesto pericolo: non essendo manco officio del Ualoroso capitano,
far operatione de savio, che d' animoso, in English, thus; in all humane
actions, and especially in war, men ought oftentimes to advise which
necessity, and put on their resolves accordingly; and not expose the whole to
manifest danger out of a desire of obteining a part, which is to hard to
compass, and almost impossible: it being no less the duty of a worthy
commander to be advised then valiant in his proceedings. And to what the same
Author says in another place, La prima laud nella disciplina militare
consiste piu nel rendere con la industria con la patientia e con s' art Uani i
conati degli anversarij, che nel combattere ferocemente, which may be more
breifely Englished in Mr. Fullers words, Not Fury, but Discretion must be the
guide of war. And lastly I shall recommend unto them the opinion of Cicero;
Quem discordiae, quem caedes civium, quem bellum civil delectat; eum ex numero
hominum eijciendum, e finibus humanae naturae exterminandum puto. I am of
opinion that he who takes delight in discord, murder of fellow Citizens,
Civil War, ought to be thrown out from conversing with men and not to be
admitted within the precincts of humane nature.

For the truth of what is herein written; you hear the Author say in his
Epistle, part of it is drawn to the Life, as actions whereof he himself has
been an eye witness, the rest he terms a Copy; yet such a one as is copied
from the best hands: he having been very curious in the choice of those whose
relations he has list'ned unto and made use of; so as at least you may afford
him an Historical faith.

All that of my self I shall say concerning my Author is, that in my life time
I never met with less appearing Partiality in any Treatise of the like
nature, partiality being a corruption wherein usually the greatest escape. But
to keep thee no longer from tasting better Viands by a homely breakfast; I
leave my Author to thy judgment, and my self to thy Favorable Interpretation.

July the 5th. 1647.
The Author to the READER.
WHen I was arrived at a fitting age for the managing of arms, my father Count
Nicholas Gualdo, Priorato, Colonel and Campe-Master to the most illustrious
state of Venice, desirous that that service, which for many years our family
had dischar^ghed to our Prince, in honorable, and prime employments should not
find an interruption or stop in me, sent me into Flanders, where I was three
years a voluntier amongst the chief commanders, from thence I past into
Germany, and from thence to France, whilst war was there waged with the
Hughenots, being afterward invited by the commotions of Italy which were great
in Piemont, and in the Ualceline, I returned into Lombardy where I stayed till
such time as the Plague being ceased, and the wars of Mantoa ended, I had a
mind to return again for Germany, where I tarryed a long time with
Walesteime, being afterward enforced to return to mine own country, by
reason of my fathers death, which happened unto him in his return from the
government of Candia, where having stayed some few days, I had a mind tho see
the King of Sweeds Army, which bore so great fame, whereupon I past the Alps
again and spent about a year in those armies, under Marishall Horn and Duke
Weymar. All the time I was abroad and out of mine own Country, which was above
the space of 14 years, part whereof I spent in wars, part in Princes Courts,
my endeavor was by the words, and actions of other men, to get the knowledge
of Politic government, and military observation upon all occasions, at all
times and in all places, I weighed the reasons why men did rather thus, then
thus, I diligently applied my self to spy into the negotiations of Officers,
the difficulties of managing affairs, and the issues or conclusions of
treaties, I thought it advantageous to observe the condition of Cheeftaines,
the counsels of wisemen, the conceptions of the Common people, the opinions of
the Nobility, and the interests of great men, I fixed mine eye upon the success
of undertakings, upon the nature of Countries, the variety of manners, the
importancy of scituations, and strong holds, the considerablenesse of rivers,
the difficulty of passages, the experience of Soldiers; upon time, place and
causes, and kept distinct notes of those things, for my better memorys sake in
the best manner I was able, and as I was befriended by time, wherein some times
I was straightened, sometimes had sufficient opportunity.

These rough draughts of mine coming to the sight of some of my friends,
afforded them occasion to persuade me, or to say better, to constrain me to
print them, promising me that if they could not be admitted into the narrow
path of praise, they would at least pass the gate of gratitude, whether he
sometimes gets, who without pretense of merit, does by the sincerity of his
will make amends for the faultiness of his effects, I confess this their
invitation seemed a dream to me, for to carry the splendid tables which in
these days are so imbellished, a dish ungarnished with the amber of invention,
and wanting the flowery garlands of style, is no better then to nauciate the
guests. But these my friends persuading me, that men do differ in their tastes,
that some like better what is tarte and sharp than what is sweet, and that
the greediest understandings do ofttimes distaste meats* too artificially
cooked, they did persuade me into this error, I say error; for if whosoever
differs from the general custom, goes astray, I who write (my beard not being
gray, and without Horace his nine years rule) shall peradventure be blamed for
putting modern actions to the press written by a young head, They freed me
also of this fear, telling me that Horace was a Poet, and that he spoke of
Poems, Orations, and other quaint composures; not of History, since that she,
(which ought always to be the picture of truth, and without the attendants or
imbellishments of wit) is always one and the same, when the draught is made
by the life; and is much more comely naked, then when clothed by invented
adornments drawn from time, And they added hereunto; that those who writ
things which were acted many ages ago, do it, for that there being none to
oversee them, they may boldly tell some untruthes without fear of
reprehension; and if they compose with their hand upon the planke, and their
foot in the ditch, they do it, least they become spectators to the anatomies
of their own works. I have therefore yielded to slip, yet but with one foot.
For though I have written all the wars of Bohemia, France, and Italy, which
have fallen out in my time, I publish only the success of things, from the
moving of the King of Sweedes forces, to the taking of Turin. And have done
this, for that I think if what has happened in these eleaven years, and which
peradventure will be fullest of curiosity, please not, my former discourses
will be less taking, so as I may spare the labor which would be troublesome
to me and tedious to the Reader.

Those actions where I was an eye witness, are pictures drawn by the life,
that which I have received from the relation of others, is a copy, If such be
not truly drawn, the fault lies not in me, who have copyed things as they
have been discribed to me, but in those who related them unto me.

It can hardly be made good that Copyes drawn from others hands conteyne in
them a perfect form, for many overcome by passion, or overswayed by affection,
speak as they would have it be, Nor does it avayle that things do come from,
or be reported by great personages, or well reputed Ministers of State, for
lies like flies flock every where, and where they most smell the sweet of
curiosity, there they take their station.

I have notwithstanding endeavored to have the relations of what has happened,
from who have been present in the actions, but not from every one that has
been so, for many although they see, imbroyle the relation, as not being of
Capacity either to understand, or to remember what has happened, and so all
foundations grounded thereupon prove vain.

A batttle sought between the French and Spaniards will not without some
alteration, be related either by a Frenchman or a Spaniard. Affection is of a
nature not unlike to wine, it tastes of the caske; the private passion of the
mind, pertakes of the quality of Torrents; it is troubled and grows clear
again answerable to the rain by which it is fed.

If any shall say, that pen takes a precipitate and dangerous course which
writes of present emergencyes, unbridled by adulation, it is granted. But he who
writes in times when the government of the present Princes is not to be blamed,
need not fear to fall upon the unpleasing offspring of truth. The Princes of
this age are known to be ruled by justice, and governed by reason. And if
through the interest of state, or by the advice of their council, they do any
thing which is not acceptable to all men, they are not therein blameable, for
the greatness of men of might, is not seen in the peacefullnesse of mind,
but is discerned in their sprightly thoughts, and vast intents.

The Encomiums of the worthy Princes, even of these ages are celebrated with no
greater titles, then so many Caesar's or Alexanders. Greatness loves
greatness, The Danuby, Rhyne and Po are great, because the concourse of many
Rivers goes to make them great; Principalityes are likewise plants, which
branch forth and increase in hight more or less accordingly, as the ground is
fertile where they are planted. The desire of glory and greatness, reigns not
only amongst the better, but amongst the inferior, yea the basest sort of
men, The private who neighbors upon an inferior, rests not content till he
has joined his neighbors land unto his own. Such a genious labors to get
the priority amongst those who are esteemed lovers of rarityes, the soldier
fights, and loses his life, to increase his fame amonst men; humane desires
not unlike to torrents, by how much they are more swollen with the waters of
glory the more headlong do they run, and often times break the banks or bounds
of faith and promises. Those who have not been conversant in any other nation
then their own, and yet governed by a certain Sympathy, profess themselves
to side sometimes with this, sometimes with that stranger, may peradventure wry
the neck, when they shall hear of any bad accident which has befallen one
that they liked; and may perchance say I am in some places too free spoken. If
it shall so fall out; I would have them to know, I writ not to give
satisfaction to any one save to truth it self; and that men write ill, when
they omit writing what is ill, fortune is not always favorable, and
therefore when she frowns she cannot be said to smile. Who apprehends the
satisfying of all men* does by his own belief begin to prejudicate what he
writes. Boldness in relation, freedom in judgment, discretion in words, and
wisdom in contriving, are the reins which ought to govern the pen of an
Historian.

If others who may be of an opinion that such events as are written, whilst
the actors themselves are yet living, are usually written partially and with
adulation, and not adaequate to the times, and to the persons, and shall
therefore blame me for writing so early, let them remember that the force and
credit of truth is so much the greater, by how much it has the more witnesses.
That writings which are kept locked up in a chest, are like some plants which
kept in their own original earth never grow, unles they be taken from thence,
and placed some where else no less then these ought past events in History to
be transplanted, whilst the bows remain in memory, for that if any bastard
plant be given for legitimate, by the inocculation of amendment in the second
impression it may become legitimate. Nor is it at any time a fault, which is
occasioned by the faultiness of an other.

I have thaught it fitting in these my labors to describe the conditions of
such Princes, and chief Commanders as have perished, that they may serve for
looking glasses to such as succeed them. If it be objected, I only writ their
praises, and that Encomiums belong not to the weaving of a History, I would
have it known, I make not use of such spectacles, or prospective glasses
whereby men discern spots in the Moon, That the praises fall not from my pen,
but from their merit. And History requires the representation of such, whose
actions are the soul of discourse and the marrow of instruction.

Those who peradventure from the tribunal of their judgment shall give
sen^ence against me, blaming either my style, my discriptions, the composure of
the narrative part, the scarcity or superfluity of my words or what ever else;
they ought to know that I am a soldier and no perfect Scholar, and that as
such a one I appeal from their seat of judement, so as the sentence rests
null. I have not stroven to adorn my writings, by inventing eloquent and
polished Orations made by Commanders, and other graceful digressions, which
(not for that they are so in themselves, but to show their quaint wits,) many
use in their compositions, as well for that I think those conceits fitter for
the Schools or chair of an Orator, to delight the hearers then for a camp,
where the general does usually infuse courage into his soldiers, with
succinct words containing in them only the hopes of reaping honor, and
advantage as also for that it seems not sitting to me, that the Mask
wherewith a Tale is disguised, should be applied to the face of a serious truth.

I have done; that I may not be to tedious to thee, be contented to accept of
metal drawn out of mine own mine.

DOCTRINA PARIT VIRTUTEM.

THE Wars, and other State-Affaires of the best part of Christendom, from
1629. to 1640. THE I. BOOK.
The Contents of the First Book.
The First Book relates the Original of the War made by Gustavus King of
Swethland against the Emperor Ferdinand the second; What the Condition of
Germany was at that time, what Friendship and Intelligence the King had with
Foreign Princes before this War began, his Military Preparations made in
Swethland, what Counsels he held, and what Resolutions he put on, His entrance

Diverse Proceedings, Resolutions, Counsels, and Policies of all the concerned
Parties; Preparations in England to reinforce the Swedish Army; The ill will
born by Protestants toward the Austrian Ministers of State, and their good

other advancements made by the King; The Description of such Provinces, Places,
or Rivers as ar^ herein spoken of; Tyllies proceedings to oppose the King; His
Counsels, Resolutions, and Considerations; The Siege, Taking, and Dissolution
of Magdeburg.

THE desire of glory did more and more increase in the heart of Gustavus
Adolphus King of Swethland, a Prince of a vast Spirit, after the many years
War which by him was managed against the Crown of Poland, in which he
purchased great Fame unto himself amongst those People; but if his body were
then unexercised, his mind was not so, which busied about high Designs, did
cheerfully covet to wage War against the House of Austria in Germany; LIB.
1. 1629.
a Kingdom not only divided by the dissonancy of Religion, but exasperated by
the new Government of the Austrian Officers of State; who after the Peace made
at Lubec, though they seemed to have received some sort of relief by the
Disbanding of Eighteen Thousand of Walestein's Soldiers, which was done by
the command of Caesar, and at the Peoples entreaties; yet notwithstanding there
being great store of Forces, remaining under the said Walestein, and those
dispersed through every Province, with an unwonted form of Government, though
fear kept the hatred and suffering of the Subjects concealed, yet did not
they, as likewise the Princes, cease to cast about how they might withdraw
themselves from that yoke, the Cruelties whereof they could not endure.

But the greater their Conceptions were, the greater Consideration did they
require, which made the King for the present forbear to act his Resolves, and
though by Walesteins (aforesaid) disbanding, and the Polachs alike disbanding
the German Forces, he had furnished himself with the best Soldiers of all
those Troops; and though he were fully informed of the condition, strengths,
and inclinations of his neighboring Potentates, having himself in Person not
many years before gone unknown to search out the estate of Germany and other
Provinces, that he might discover how people stood affected, and of what
strength the Princes and Haunce Towns were, yet he knew it was not yet time to
take up those unripe resolutions, which being unadvisedly undertaken by the
Prince Elector Palatine, by the King of Denmark and others, had not brought
forth that good effect, which doubtless was by many expected: being made more
cautious by the said examples, (though his desire painted forth these
difficulties, as slight ones, and his hopes upheld by apparent grounds, egged
him on to this enterprise,) yet not suffering himself to be led by these
affections out of the road of reason, but moderating the ardency of his Genius,
by the remembrance of past errors, he kept his Name and Fame, as it were
cancelled out of the Germans memory. But if the Fire of this Princes desires
lay for some time wrapped up under the ashes of patience and simulation, insomuch
as there remained not the least suspicion of him, it is no wonder if afterward
unexpectedly breaking forth, and laying hold on the fittest occasions, it were
able to rekindle the inconstancy of those Provinces, who under a feigned
fidelity, lived ill satisfied with the Austrian government; for most part of
the people, remembering the liberty they had enjoyed, and not able to tolerate
the command and subjection of Roman Catholics, and more particularly of such
as were strangers, coveted nothing more then such like novelties.

The King this mean while held good Intelligence with diverse Officers, and
principal Protestants of Germany, by whom he was not only faithfully
advertised of the chief proceedings of the Imperialists, but by frequent
solicitations much importuned to the undertaking. The King was likewise much
troubled at any longer delay: For his inclination leading him to War, he
could not content himself with peace; but well weighing afterward, that to
carry his weak Forces into a Kingdom commanded by the Forces of Ferdinand
the second, LIB. 1. 1630.
which had been in so many actions victorious, and which were all united under
the Command of Albertus Walestein, Duke of Fridland, a Subject of high esteem,
beloved by the Soldiers, feared by all the States and Princes of the Empire,
was almost an evident danger to give against the same Rocks, upon which those
had suffered shipwreck, which not long before contemning the Austrian Fortune
had made the same Voyage, banishing therefore from his breast all the
incitations of his own belief, and laying aside the Cousnells and Invitations
of those who were impatient of his delay, he forbore to declare himself as yet.

Humane Resolutions varying with the times, he had afterward this into
particular consideration; that not only the Protestant Princes and people, but
the very Roman Catholics were exasperated and filled with jealousy of the
Emperors excessive greatness, occasioned through Walesteines haughtiness,
who thought by the Command at that time of more then a hundred Thousand foot,
and thirty Thousand Horse, of diverse Nations, dispersed over all Germany, he
kept the Majesty of Caesar in reverence, his Subjects in their obedience, his
Tributaries in their devotion, and Strangers in fear, yet treated he the
Princes of Germany indifferently, not as free Princes but as Subjects;
whereupon, for that the excessive authority of private men, and overmuch
greatness of Neighboring Potentates is never liked by great ones, the
Electors which pretend to keep the Imperial Condition within its limits, could
not suffer either the burden they lay under upon this so just an occasion, nor
that so many soldiers should be maintained in Germany in the time of peace, to
the peoples so great grievance, nor that the Throne of Caesar should be raised
so high, they therefore privately sought out all opportune means, how they
might unarme him, and take from the Empire such a support, which if it had been
made good, many are of an opinion the King had come no further then Pomerania.
Walestein certified of these grievances, and incensed thereat, gave not over
his Imperious manner of treating and threatening: But crying out the Emperor
was betrayed, and that the chiefest Jewel in Caesar's Crown was taken away
only to put him down, he justly foretold the succeeding Calamities. By this
means discovery was made, that this Commander was highly distasted, and it was
further foreseen that the reputation which those Forces had acquired by the
Valor of Walestein being lessened, notable prejudice was thereby betokened to
the Caesarian Crown. The King likewise saw that by the Counsels of some
Italian and Spanish Ministers of State, chiefly by the advice of Caesar Duke
of Vastella, then Ambassador from the King of Spain to the Emperor, assisted
to that purpose by Villainy the Spanish Resident, sent thither to moderate the
greatness of Walesteines expeditions, the Forces were divided, part of them
being sent into Lombardy, under the Command of Count Rambaldo de Colalto, who
being desirous of such an employment, was a means to Caesar that Walestein
formerly declared General in Italy, should be invested with the Dukedom of
Mechelburg, for that if that, could be effected, Walesteine had promised him,
he would refuse the Command in Italy, and procure the employment for him. So
Walestein as well to acquit himself of the favor received, as likewise that
his intention was not to stir out of Germany, that he might not grow less in
authorities, and for the fear he had le^t his Corrivalls might in his absence
plot somewhat to his prejudice, procured that employment for the said Colalto,
to which the Emperor easily condiscended; not so much out of the affection
which he bore to Walestein and Colalto, as to satisfy the Spaniards; who
liked better of Colalto (as one less haughty, and who depended more upon them)
and set themselves close to this War, for that the liberty of Italy
consisting in the Counterpoising of the Forces of France, always desiring to
assist that side where they would get footing, if they should have won
Casall, (a place of Retreat for the French Forces, and a Fortress able to keep
the State of Millan in continual Motion, and the Commonwealth of Venice being
weakened by the loss of Mantua, which Commonwealth of Venice, as Arbitrator of
all actions in Italy, by piously backing Justice, is always a help to the
weakest, and does in part keep the Subjects of Italy alive) they did not only
hope to secure the Millanneses, but thereby to open the way for their
Conquering the remainder of that Kingdom: a Design of all others always most
studied of the Spaniards. He moreover knew that those of the Nation were
ill-apaid that employments should be conferred upon Strangers: that the Haunce
Towns and Princes of the Empire, little affected with the Austrian Government,
were jealous of the greatness of the House of Austria, and did mainly endeavor
the weakening of it, which he observed might easily be effected; for that the
Emperor, in likelihood, would be contented to give way to the disbanding of
the supernumerarie Forces, or else to the sending of them out of the Empire
upon some other employment, thereby to make Electors at the Election of the
King of the Romans, willingly adhere to favor the King of Hungary, and not
more to exasperate those Princes.

He was likewise certifi'd that such Princes of Italy as the Emperor might
hope for help from against the Protestants, were not well contented to see the
Imperial power screwed up so high, and were much troubled at the coming of
the Army to Reine in Lombardy. He hoped well in assistance, and diversions from
France, which by the victories of Lewis the Thirteenth, was brought into a
peaceful and triumphant condition. He hoped likewise for help from the King
of England, who was not well satisfied with the Austrian party for their
usurping of the states of the Count Palatins his Nephews. He was no less
confident of Holland, a growing Commonwealth, enricht by many Forces both by
Sea and Land. He then saw the occasion was fitting, which he knew was not to
be neglected; but that he was to reassume that War, which being with little
success begun by others had no other hopes but from his tried valor. To the
effecting of these Designs of the year 1629. Many Commanders were well
received in Swethland, who had been returned from the Caesarian Army, and from
that Army which was sent to assist the King of Polonia under the Conduct of
Harnem, which was given out to be done by the good will of Walestein, who
entirely hating every one that did but speak of Reformation, desired such
Innovations as might make the Emperor know how ill he was advised in lissening
to those who by a peaceful way did cunningly lead him to a more dangerous
War. Having received good Intelligence by these, and giving them speedy
Commissions to raise Forces; and on the other side, having gathered together
the remainder of the Army which was brought back from the Wars of Livonia,
and having taking such order as was requisite for the Soldiers pay in
Gothland, Finland, and Smoland, he in a few Months space found himself ready
to be served and obeyed by a strength of old Soldiers to the number of above
twelve Thousand Foot and Horse. And now he thought himself to be in a good
posture, to have ground enough to raise his plotted Designs upon, and to hoise
Sail for Pomerania.

Pomerania extends it self along the Shore of the Baltique Sea, it is bounded
on the East by Poland, and on the West by the Dukedom of Mechelberg, enlarged
afterward by fruitful Territories even to the Confines of the Marquisate of
Brandemburg: She receives into her self the Noble Oder, one of the famous
Rivers of Germany, which falling from the utmost parts of Moravia upon the
Confines of Silicia, runs into the Lake called Gross Haffe. The King having
to this purpose called all his Captains and Officers together, and the
greatest part of the chief of his Kingdoms, (out of the which the King by a
Fundamental Law, cannot upon what pretense soever go without the consent of
all the Orders) at S^ocholme the City of his Residence, placed right over
against Pomerania, looking on the South side upon the Sea, by two great Arms
whereof it is girt about, would in public make known what his Designs were.

Thus being all in the great Hall of his Court, he demonstrated unto them with
valid reasons the necessity of this War, as well for the preservation of his
own Kingdom in quiet, as for the maintenance of their Faith, and in a very
feeling manner enlarged himself to this effect: That the Empire was now grown
to that height, as that the thirsty ambition of the greatest therein, exceeding
their own limits, would spread their Resolutions, even over his State, since
it was evidently seen how he was injured by the Imperialists, who never having
had any thing to do with the Baltic Sea, had now declared Walestein to be
Admiral thereof; an Usurpation not to be endured by a courageous King; that
the Princely name of Swethland, had in their Imperial Diets been villified
with scurrilous Writings and Hostill Edicts; that he suffered in his Honor by
the Austrian Ministers of State; that his vast mind cried for revenge; that the
occasion of enlarging, and securing their Dominions ought not to be let slip by
Princes, who had their wits about them; that Honor, Religion, and Greatness
were the things now in question; that his Forces did not now differ from them
of former times, so much dreaded, which had brought under the fairest Nation of
Europe; that the World would say the same of times past; that the like Fortune,
as Alexander, Caesar, and Achilles had, would not be wanting to one of as
undaunted a Courage; that it did not misbecome a King to quit his own
Country, whose mind being bent upon Glory, Greatness, and his Subjects
Happiness, should not be imbased by the leisure of Courts; that to spend his
Talent in the Luxuries and Pleasures of Peace, did not become a Prince who had
been brought up in Martial Exercises; and lastly, he with a loud voice said,
that he would either Sacrifice himself to the Negligence of his Fortune, or
else return unto his Kingdom loaded with Glory and Triumphs, having made
himself known to be a King worthy of so valiant a People. Then making a
little pause* and finding the affection of all the standers by, by the
cheerfulness of their Aspect, for as if they had been immovable, they could
not sufficiently show their approbabation of what he had so well said, he
invited them to follow him, promising that he would not only be their Lord and
King, but their Brother and Companion.

Dismissing the Council, he employed the ensuing days in hastening the
provisions of Victuals, Munition, and Artillery: till such time as answer
being returned from my Lords the States of Holland, by whose Intelligence all
these Machinations were made and encouraged every day more, by that
Commonwealth, which of all other Principalities, as well in respect of the
Interest of State as also of Religion, was desirous of this noveltie, and
invited thereunto, and heartned therein, by Letters from France and England,
having recommended the leavying of eight thousand other Soldiers to Auxilius
Oxasterne Lord Chancellor of that Kingdom, and taken order for all things
that concerned the good government of the Kingdom, which in his absence he
left under the protection of the Queen his Wife, with the unspeakable applause
of all the Nobility and People, who in great numbers floct to bid him farewell,
He imbarqued himself, and all his Army on the thirteenth of June, June 13.
1630. in 70 Men of War, and 200 lesser Barques; and directing his course
Southward, he sailed toward Rugen, with intention to surprise it. Rugen is an
Island in the Baltique Sea, bounding upon Pomerania, from which it is divided
by a Gulf some few miles broad, and is seated just over against Stralshond, a
Haunce Town situated upon the Sea side, which has in it a good and much
frequented Haven, and is environed with strong Rampards and Bulwarks; with the
chief Magistrates whereof (though surrounded with Austrians) the King held good
Intelligence.

He sailed from the said thirteenth of June, till the four and twentieth of
the same, June 24.
and being happily come to Stralshond, he and his Army came to shore at Rugen;
they set upon the Imperialists, who were placed there, in certain little Forts
rather for Guard then for Defense; they soon made themselves Masters of it,
sacking it, and plundring it, which much pleased the Soldiers; as if this so
happy a beginning did presage their greater Conquests.

The King leaving 500 Foot in this Island* and two men of War for the safeguard
of the Passage, and having made it a Store house for his own Military
Provisions, he took Ship again on St. Peter's day, the 29. of the same Month,
and with a good Wind came to Vsedon, an Island dis-joyned from the firm Land
of Pomerania, by two Arms of a Lake or Moorish ground called Frish Haffe, into
which the Odor bisburthens it self, where there not being Foot able to
withstand the onset of a strong and fresh Enemy, the Imperialists who were
there in Garrison resolved to abandon it, that they might not come to trial
with the Swedish Forces; leaving only two hundred Foot for the defense of
certain Sconces. They got to Wolghast, a City not contemptible for its
situation and fortifications, standing upon that Arm of the Channel which
divides the said City or Island on the West side from Pomerania, called the
River Pene, by the making good whereof, it had been no hard matter to have
driven away the Swedes from Vsedon, and the adjacent Sconces weakly situated,
and not well fortified. But the King let slip no time, wherein the Roman
Catholics found themselves much straightned, and by consequence their Forces
were weak, and their Counsels confused, their hope of succor uncertain, and
the effects of so sudden an Incursion full of fears and frights. For at this
very time, at the Diet which was held at Ratisbone, for the affairs of the
Empire, instead of providing for this new War with the King of Swethland,
whom they esteemed a petty Prince, the aim of all the Electors tended only to
the disarming of the Emperor, and the putting the hateful and insufferable
Walestein out of his charge; which they did effect. For about this very time
the Emperor was unadvisedly persuaded to write to Walestein, that having
considered that the General was in the power of the Soldier, and that he
himself was in the power of the General, his pleasure was that he should (...)
himself into his own Country. Walesteine being thus dismissed, readyly laid
aside his staff of Command, and writ back a respectfull Letter to the
Emperor, wherein he told him that his Imperial Majesty was not in the power
of his General, but in the hands of his treacherous Ministers of State; and so
foretelling all the ruin just as it fell out, he betook himself to a private
life in Bohemia.

The King being minded to make himself Master of some Fort, which might serve
for a Retreat for his Army in case of need, before Resolutions and Counsels
should be taken for the defense of their Provinces by fresh Forces, having
advanced some of his Forces toward Vsedon, he without any manner of
contestation took almost all the Towns thereof, which were plundered by the
soldiers; and the people that were therein, were without respect put to the
sword. The King at the beginning used much severity to his Enemies; for that
well knowing of what force punishment is with those that are unable to defend
themselves, it was not to be doubted, but that the soldiers despairing of all
hope of succor, and affrighted by their own danger, would lay aside all
stubbornness, which flattered by good usage, does oft-times grow the greater.
Leaving a thousand Foot there for a Guard, and for the recruiting of some
weakened places, he forthwith re-imbarqued, and came into the River of Pand,
where unshipping his Army, he instantly sat down before the Walls of
Wolghast, against the which he planted four Batteries, he invested it on
three sides, by speedy Approaches, and caused so much fear in the Defendants,
as forsaking the City at the first onset (which being full of Protestants,
made the Imperialists jealous of the defense thereof) and retiring themselves
into the Castle, wherein for six days they resisted the Swedes Assaults, at
last despairing of succor, they yielded upon Condition of coming forth with
their Arms and Baggadge; these soldiers were so well pleased with the Kings
dealing with them, who used much Clemency toward them, that as benefits where
unexpected are most welcome, they thought they got more by losing then they did
by overcomming, and therefore resolved rather to try the acts of Clemency then
blows of Adversity; many of them invited by the Kings new fortune, forsook the
Imperial Banners, and listed themselves under the Swedish.

The taking of Wolghast did so dishearten the Austrians, that overcome more by
their own belief then the Enemies Arms, and wanting the necessaries of War
they were in great confusion; so as the King in six days more, without any
difficulty took Penemondt and Divenan in the utmost Northern parts of the said
Vsedon: for they were quickly surrendered by the Imperialists, who withdrew
themselves to Cammin upon another Channel toward the East, whither many of
those people retired in safety.

The King found himself feared, and his soldiers Courageous, who impatient of
delay, with cheerful voice said they must advance even to the Walls of Rome;
this confidence begotten in the soldiers, was much advantageous to the King,
for they fought with the resolution of still over-comming; he brought his
Forces under Cammin, and caused his Horse to make excursions over all the
neighboring Villages, spoiling the Country; this he did to the end that those
Country people, who had withdrawn themselves to strong Holds, perceiving
their Farms to be wasted, might find that by fearing to lose they lost
indeed; his Approaches and Batteries being made, he so plied the Walls with his
Cannon, and Mathooks, as at the end of eight days he was got close underneath
the Wall, and was ready to assault the breach which he had made, and was large
enough and fit to be set upon; and though the Imperialists might bravely have
made good, and maintained the Town for some time, yet things unexpected, and
bold proceedings causing usually confusion, the Defendants, not hearing of any
succor in readiness for those parts, surrenderer the City unto the King, and
1500 Foot, and 400 Horse, with their Arms, Baggadge, and two Piece of Cannon
marched out.

This unexpected Swedish Invasion into the States belonging to the Emperor
gave Alarm to all the neighboring Country, and news being sent thereof to
Caesar's Court, his Council was aware of their error in having seconded them,
by whose advise those Forces which had upheld the Imperial greatness were
disbanded, and whereby this ruin in Germany was caused, and that therefore it
was requisite to provide for the preservation of those Provinces, and strong
holds, which not being well defended by the Imperialists, if they should fall
into the power of the Swedes, would much prejudice the reputation of Caesar's
Forces: that the courage and Forces of the Enemies were grown greater, and that
they had caused some important novelty amongst the Protestants, and other
discontented people; who seeing a help at hand, and a safe place whereunto to
have refuge, would boldly make known their evil intentions, though more then
ever covered up under the ashes of weakness. Posts were speedily sent to
Torquato Conti an Italian, who as then commanded the Imperial Forces in
Pomerania, that he should use diligence in mustering together the people of
those Provinces, whereby he might oppose the Swedes further advancement, and
stop the course of their proceedings, till such time as a powerful succor
might be raised, which should chase them back into Swethland.

Directions were likewise sent to Count Tilly, who was then in Bavaria, and in
the Palatinate, with the Forces of the Catholic League; that mustering the
people of the neighboring parts, he should draw near Misina (a chief
Province of Germany) in the Center whereof stands Bohemiah, placed between the
Rivers of Sal and Elve, bordering on the North side upon the upper Saxony, and
watered by Mulda, a River which taking its rise from those Mountains which
inviron Bohemia, runs in pleasant streams into the Elve near to Desseau, and
other two uncontemptible Rivers, namely Plais and Elste^, that he should there
have an eye to the proceedings of the Swedes, and be assisting to the Imperial
Commanders, as occasion should require: as that also he should keep the
Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg within the bounds of their duty, who little
apayed with the Actions of the Imperial Officers, and (...) Austrian
greatness, would peradventure at that time have altered their correspondency
and friendship with the Emperor; wherewithal having formerly fomented the
Austrian proceedings they had raised the Imperial Authority to such an height,
that repenting afterward when there was no remedy, they were aware of what
prejudice Princes do unto themselves when they foment the most powerful. To
this purpose likewise Letters were sent unto them, exhorting them to
re-confirme their good intelligence, and to adhere unto the Emperors Forces,
thereby to drive out of the Empire the disturbers thereof. The like negotiation
full of prevalent exhortations, and enriched with quaint conceptions was held
with the Duke of Pomerania, who was more then any other suspected to hold
correspondency with the King: For this Prince being on all sides oppressed by the
Imperial Garrisons, did not only desire to regaine his former authority, but
could not light upon a fitter occasion then this, to revenge himself of the
Caesarian Officers; and indeed being become a Protestant, he did ab^orre the
name of Roman Catholic. The Emperor likewise writ to the King of Swethland,
complaining of the Invasion he had made into the Imperial territories,
whereunto he had not any the least right or claim; that he expected not he
should under feigned pretenses, have meddled with the affairs of Germany,
whereof the Emperor was the supreme Lord, that therefore he did friendly exhort
him to desist from that enterprise, and not to irritate those Arms, which not
long since had won gainful and glorious victories over the perturbers of the
common tranquillity. This Letter being brought to the King, and the bringer
thereof, which was a Bohemian Gentleman received with all civility, it was
opened. The King seemed to be well pleased at the contents thereof, said unto
the Gentleman: That he very much thanked his Master, for that he had vouchsafed
to write unto him; that he would consider upon the contents; and that when his
arm was well, which he yet wore in a Scarf, by reason of a scratch given him
therein by an Eagle in Slavonia (alluding thereby to the assistance granted by
the Emperor to the K. of Polonia) he would send him an answer: And without any
more ado, knowing that the Emperors intentions was to entertain him with
Treaties, till such time as he had got Forces able to contest with him; he
marched on, and set upon Stettin, a City well fortified with Walls, Towers, and
Ditches; the Metropolitan of Pomerania, seated in the midst thereof, and watered
by the Oder: the first onset with loud mouthed cannon was so furious, as that
Col. Demitz, who commanded in chief in the town, though he knew that with those
people he had in the Town, he was able for some while to defend it; yet
perceiving the falsehood of the people and Citizens, (who were almost all of
them Protestants, and such as were ill affected to the Caesarians, and desired
nothing more then a hand to pull the yoke from off their neck) and finding
there was no remedy for it, resolved since he found Enemies as well within as
without, to go in his own person and speak with the King, and persuaded him
to take some other resolution, but all he could say was but so much (...) in
vain, for the King (...) of Pomerania, who being in the City oppressed by the
Imperial Forces, came forth, and was received with extraordinary
demonstrations of good will, many particulars were discoursed on between him
and the King. Who said, his passing over the Sea was with intention not to take
from other men what was theirs, but to put every man into his own possession;
that the scope and drift of his Forces, was to ease the oppressed, to lessen
the immoderate greatness of the House of Austria, and to restore Germany to
its felicity which formerly it had enjoyed in freedom and peace, not subject
to the Austrian Government: He invited him to renew the correspondency, which
had been held between the Crown of Swethland, and Dukes of Pomerania, and to
employ in the continuation of this war, such Moneys and Forces, as he knew
that King deserved who had not spared his own Crown, his own Subjects, nor
yet his own life, for the common liberty.

These speeches from a Prince, who parlyed with his Sword in his hand, sound
easy access to the heart of one, who having the like desires, coveted nothing
more then such an overture: He therefore under writ their ancient alliances; he
undertook to pay Eight Thousand Soldiers, for the common Design; obliged
himself to yield up Stettin, and moreover to pay unto him a Hundred Thousand
Dollars, which was presentely done. Demitz was forced to go forth of the Town,
with the Imperial Garrison, cursing the Duke, and laying Felony and Treason
to his Charge; which was after made good by the Caesarian Decrees; whereby also
all Commanders under the Emperor were inhibited upon any whatsoever occasion
to give quarter to the Inhabitants of Pomerania, for that they were Rebels,
and guilty of High Treason.

The King being entered Stettin, with the great applause of the People and
Citizens, by whom he was received with all demonstration of expressible
affection that might be; having viewed the Fortifications, and left fitting
order for the preservation of the Town, which he made very much account of,
for that it was in the midst of those Provinces against which he was to fight;
he presently sent part of his Army before Stangart, a Town girt about with
Walls, and Bastions, after the ancient manner; placed upon the shore of Ina, a
River which taking its head from under the Wood Mariewaldt, having made a
course of about twenty Leagues, runs into Oder near Stettin; this Town was
defended by about eight hundred Soldiers; part men of the Country, part
Imperialists, who at the first appearing of the Swedish Forces, not thinking
themselves able to defend the Town, retired themselves into the Castle,
whether being followed, they yielded themselves; the Garrison marching forth
with their Arms and Baggage, went to Garis, a Town upon the Oder.

The loss of Stettin, upon which many and great consequences did depend,
caused such fear and confusion in the Inhabitants of the neighboring
Provinces; who fearing every hour to hear news of the Swedish incursions;
and being at this time settled in a good condition, began some of them to run
away, others to waver in their resolutions, and many to consult touching their
agreeing with the King: whereupon the Imperialists much apprehending that this
was occasioned by the peoples evil disposition, and the hatred they bore
as well to the Austrian Government, as to the Roman Catholic faith, they
resolved to try whether they were reduceable to their duties or no, by force of
Arms; they therefore ran over those Countries, and sacking every where as they
went, seizing on all things they could lay their hands on, not forbearing any
thing which might afflict those people, or make them despair. Many are of
opinion that they did this, rather for that they knew they could not subsist,
and that therefore they would first ruin all to prevent their Enemies, then
for the other reason alleged in their excuse, they likewise surprised
Wolghast, taken but a little before by the Swedes, and with all possible
diligence fortified themselves within the Castle, hoping by the preservation
thereof to bridle the Kings proceedings against the other Forts of Mechelburg,
and Pomerania. Tilly had order from Vienna, and express Commission from the
Emperor of Bavaria, to join himself with Torquato Counti his Forces: The
King foreseeing by this, that if the Army of the League were joined with the
Imperialists, and should come upon him before he had made himself strong and
more secure in Pomeranio, they might easily overthrow his designs; for that
the Elector of Saxony, Brandeburg, and other States, (upon whose declaring of
themselves a well grounded advantage lay) seeing that the Swedish Forces were
far off, and the Imperialists near at hand, would be well advised before
they put on resolutions; which taken upon weak ground might promise them
little advantage, and much ruin: he therefore thought it best by some means
or other to keep Tilly aloof from him; and seeing no better way to effect
this, he agreed with the Administrator of Magdeburg who was then at Strayhand,
that he should return into his City: This City is well inward in the State of
the Elector of Saxony and Brandeburg, of a wonderful strong situation upon
the River of Elbe; Elbe takes its head from the Mountains of Resingbrig, or
Giant Mountains between the confines of Bohemiah and Slecia, and usefully
watering diverse Provinces and Principalities, after a very long course wherein
she takes in into her self diverse other Rivers, becoming Navigable for great
Barks, she disgorges her self into the North Sea. This City was very well
furnished with all manner of provisions for defense, very populous, and
extremely ill affected to the Romish Catholics; and if the King could get
thither, he should not only easily draw the Electors and other Protestant
Princes to side with him, who forbear the doing thereof, only out of fear of
the Caesarians, but would have brought his Forces to their desired end; he
charged the Administrator that he should declare to the chief Magistrates
thereof, that his Forces aimed at the preservation of the common liberty, and
of that Religion, which being suppressed by the Roman Catholics, they must, or
lose their lives and goods, or betray their consciences; this was forthwith,
with much efficacy performed by the Administrator, a man of great authority,
and a declared ill-willer of the Roman Catholics; and finding no repugnancy
in the people, desirous of novelty, and resolute in the maintenance of (...)
the Council and the whole people to declare themselves well wishers to King
Gustavus, and to inhibit all help and assistance to the Romanists; and the
more to secure this their declaration, they betook themselves to increase
their Fortifications upon the Walls, to make ready people, and other sufficient
preparations for the preservation of their resolutions.

The King then weighing how he might increase his numbers, if he should take in
certain Towns kept by the Romanists in those parts, before the Imperialists
should come unto their succor, went from Stettin, and at the same time sent
part of his Army under the Command of Gustavus Horn to take in Dam, a place
not far from Stettin, standing upon a little River called Plana, which being
manned by five hundred Austrians, and wanting modern Fortifications,
compounded upon the first sight of the Swedish Cannon; and went himself in
person with the rest before Newgarten, a little Town walled about, upon the
side of a little Lake derived from the River Hamerbeck, and wherein were about
four hundred Soldiers in Garrison; he in two days made himself Master of
it: then running over that slip of land, which lies between the aforesaid
River of Hamerbeck, and the River Meltanne, he took Criffenburg, a Town
watered by Rega and Triptoe, seated on the utmost parts of Pomerania toward
the sea, upon the banks of Meltanne, which without any contestation yielded: on
the other side Gustavus Horn repassing over the Oder quickly took in Costin,
Freinwalt, Anchan, and Ockermand, all of them walled Towns of Pomerania,
beyond the Oder toward the West, and all of them guarded by Imperial
Garrisons; which being only fortified by ancient Rampires, and high Towers,
suddenly compounded, and the greatest part of those Soldiers, who amazed at
the prosperous success of the Swedes, knew not whether to fly for safety,
enrolled themselves under the Swedish Colors; passing from hence he likewise
won Passevalke, Barth, and Grimmen, places which though of small defense, yet
for the Imperialists to retreat unto. Then considering, that if the prop of
Griffenhaghen should be taken from the Imperialists, the rest of the Towns
which were held in those parts by the Romanists, would be much weakened, he came
before Honigsberg a Town walled about after the ancient manner, and guarded by
five hundred Soldiers, seated in the furthermost part of Pomerania, upon the
Confines of Maria nova, he took it in three days: There came in moreover to
his obedience, Lippin by the side of a little Lake, from whence the River
Mizaell takes its rise, Arsnsnalde, a Town upon the shore of Ina, Bernsheine a
Town upon the same River, and B^rwalde, which lies between Mizell and
Ronigsberg all of them weakly walled about after the ancient manner and of
small resistance.

The fame of the Swedes proceedings being this mean while spread abroad in
France and England, 1631.
whereat these two Crowns did much rejoice: The King of Great Britain, whom
the restitution of the Palatinate much concerned, solicited the promised Levy,
which being begun by four thousand Foot, destined for the King of Swethlands
service, and furnishing him with good sums of Money, he tied himself in
streighter bonds or friendship with him, the French likewise who for the
interest of State, coveted this diversion, by the which they might the more
easily succor Montferrat, and which was the proper way to moderate the
Spaniards greatness; which growing more powerful, did more and more covet the
Universal Monarchy, and filled all the Potentates of Europe with Jealousy:
sent Mounsieur de Carnace Ambassador to the King of Swethland, as well to
congratulate his happy entry, as to make good what he had promised him before
his marching: which Ambassador was by the King received with great alacrity,
and after some short negotiations, a League was concluded between these two
Crowns the 22. day of January, in the year 1631. in the Camp at Barwalde,
the grounds whereof were; That the Princes who were oppressed by the Austrian
Faction, should be restored to their former States, Towns, and liberty; and
that for the maintenance of this War, his most Christian Majesty would pay
every year four hundred thousand Dollars.

This agreement being of no small support to the Swedish affairs; as well for
the real assistance, as for the reputation got by the friendship of so
puissant a King; to the which many German Princes, as also Forreners ought to
have had respect, before they should have undertaken to have assisted the
Imperialists, LIB. 1. 1631.
was magnificently solemnized with the greatest demonstrations of joy and
jubilee, which by the Swedes could be expressed; great Bonfires were made as well
in the Camp, as in the Cities and Forts, which they had won; The Cannon was
heard to go off incessantly for three nights together, feasts and banquets were
celebrated with all expression of joy; the general satisfaction caused by this
new amity was every where easily to be discerned. The King having likewise at
the same time received three hundred thousand Dollars from the King of England,
and having notice how the people that were raised for his service, to the
number of two thousand Foot, were under sail in the Haven of Dover, under the
conduct of the Marquess Hamilton, to go for Pomerania; and finding his Army
much enforced by many Leavies made by his Commanders in the neighboring
Provinces, from which many of the Enemies Soldiers fled away; he saw he was
not now to refuse his good fortune, but to march forward with his Forces to new
Conquests; his Army then being Mustered at Stettin, in the presence of the
French Ambassador, was found to consist of about twenty thousand gallant
Soldiers, all well Disciplined: and though the Imperial Forces in Gratz and
Greffinhaghen did much oppress Pomerania, insomuch as he was desired by the
Inhabitants, to ease them of that burden; yet not approving to turn into
those parts, he held it better to pass with his Army into the Duchy of
Mechelburg, and to get footing also in those parts; as well that he might draw
near the Landgrave of Hessen, who having declared himself for the Swedish
Party, and made offer of his life and fortune unto the King, gave pay unto
eight thousand Soldiers; as likewise that he might hold intelligence with
Lubeck, Hamburg, and other Haunce towns, which having driven the Imperialists
from them, he might much advantage himself by them, for they were stored with
people, and with Money* and (...) many Protestant Princes had withdrawn
themselves thither for shelter from the fury of the Imperialists, who had then
seized upon their Provinces; where together with those helps he should receive
no little advantage, by the rising of those Inhabitants, who for the public
liberty, would not refuse to spend such wealth as they should bring with them,
which they could not better lay out, then for the recovery of their Country,
and the maintenance of the public quiet: Hereunto was added that the Duchy
of Mechelburg coasting upon Pomerania, and the Marquessat of Brandenburg the
latter was thereby the more secure, and the Elector taking pretense from the
Armies at hand of the King his Brother in Law, thereby to free himself from
Caesar's obedience, he sound it would be no hard matter to get him to declare
himself: the King was moreover hereunto moved by the alliance of the Dukes,
his Nephews of that name; for being dispossessed by the Imperialists, and their
States conferred upon Walesteine a private Subject, it was a thing that could
not be suffered either by the King, or by the Princes, nor by the Haunce Towns.

He therefore imbarqued his Army at Stettin the sixth of September, and arrived
happily at Stralshund, where being received with the general applause of the
Citizens, and having taken good order there for the preservation of the
public liberty, he came before Damgart, seated upon the River Rechenits,
which coming out of a little Lake near the Village Kra-Kawne, in the Confines
of Mechelburg, toward the Electorate of Brandenburg, runs into the Ocean not
far from Stralshand: Damgart was fortified with strong towers and walls after
the ancient manner; but Stralshund without Works and Fortifications after the
modern fashion, and by a Fort which the Romanists had built upon the mouth of
the River. This place was furiously set upon with Mattockes and Cannon, the
bullets whereof found passage through their Parrapats not yet wholly finished:
after a contention of six days, the Defendants being so obstinate in the
defense thereof, as that they despised all advantageous conditions: And though
they saw their ruin at hand, yet still persevering in their weak defense,
they were by a furious assault made by the Swedes; the King looking on, forced
to forgo their Parrapats; upon which the Swedes mounted, and without delay
closely following the fugitives, they without mercy slew as many of them as
they overtooke. At the same time, the King who fully imparted his intelligence,
sent some of his Forces to scale Ribbinets, another Fort upon the said
Rechenits; and not far from Damgart, which he likewise took, and took the
Governor thereof (who was a Spaniard) prisoner, five hundred of the Garrison
putting themselves under his Colors. This as being a Pass of consequence,
opened unto him an ingresse into the Duchy of Mechelburg, and did likewise
facilitate his getting of Rostoch, the Metropolis of that Province, well
fortified round about with Modern Fortifications, and which stands upon the
River Warnaw, a River which taking its head near a little Village called
Warn^w, from whence it has its name, falls into the Baltique Sea, after it
has so enlarged it self, (...) unto (...), as bearing upon it the greatest
Ships that go upon the Western Seas; it makes that place a Haven of great
esteem: He was without any manner of resistance, received into this City; and
having exhorted the people and Citizens to acknowledge their Lord, and to drive
from amongst them those who adheared to Walesteine, not leaving any garrison
there, but recommended it to the care of the Magistrate, he marched too before
Wismar, a chief City likewise of the said Duchy of Mechelburg, munited with
Modern Parrapets, and well Garrisoned, standing upon an Angle of a Gulf of
the Sea, whereby it is made a fair receptacle for Merchants Ships.

The Imperialists having notice of this unexpected Invasion upon the
Territories of Mechelburg; and finding the importancie thereof, gathered
themselves together at Gastrowe, in the greatest numbers that they could,
withdrawing all the useless Garrisons from the neighboring places, and marched
to Sterneburg, a Town which is watered by a little Lake; and being here
advertised that the Swedes had made no stay in Rostoch, and that they were by
the Citizens thereof desired to come and regaine it, they bethought themselves
how they might get it, which they easily did: They sent some of their squadrons
of Horse toward the City, faigning to turn toward Doberan, a Town a little
above Rostoch toward the Sea; they go into it, and possess themselves of it,
suffering the Inhabitants to go forth: For not yet secure of any resistance to
be made by the Swedes, they feared lest by any hostile Declaration, they might
exasperate the Caesarians, who had yet many strong Holds in that Province; And
because the Imperialists intentions were to abandon all the Dukedom of
Mechelburg, unless it were Rostoch and Wismer, that they might make use of
their men in the Field; they overran the Country, and withdrew into those two
places all whatsoever they could get from the Towns and Villages of that
State, pretending they did this, to the end that the Swedes might not make use
of the Corn, Hay, and Farradge, and that the Forts which they intended to keep
might be the better munitioned.

The news of the surprisall of Rostoch, and the Austrians advancing into that
Province, who were reinforced by men sent unto them by Torquato Conti, made
the King alter his resolution; for not thinking he could advantage himself, by
making any longer stay in those parts, he raised his Army from the places where
they were, and returned to Ribbinits; and having taken order for sufficient
provisions and safety for that place; as likewise for Damgart, places upon all
occasions fit to give him entrance into the State* And having left Bannier,
with four thousand Foot, and eight hundred Horse to guard those places, He
sent the Duke of Saxony, Luenburg, into Hamborg and Lubecks, to solicit the
raising of men in those parts, and to manite the Forts thereabouts, that they
might be ready to succor the Lansgrave of Hesse if he should be set upon by
Count Popenhaime; who giving out that he would do so, was diligent in the
raising of men in the Territories of Woulfembutell and Brunswicke. He with the
rest of his Army returned to (...), where he stayed six days, negotiating
business of very great import; and thinking it was now time to answer the
Emperors Letter, and to justify his design in taking up Arms, he writ unto
his Caesarian Majesty to this purpose:

That having very often complained unto him of the indiscretion of his Ministers
of State, he had never listened unto him, much less given a favorable hearing
to his just pretentions; that his Crown had been injured by the usurpation of
Titles over the Baltique Sea, conferred upon Walesteine, and by many injuries
done unto his Subjects in the Ports of Pomerania; that he had rejected all the
Propositions that he had caused to be made, and that: last he was enforced to
seek for satisfaction by way of Arms, since his words nor entreaties could
prevail; that therefore he was not entered Germany any ways to do outrage to
the Imperial Crown, but to succor his friends and confederates, since
Princes are obliged to their Neighbors beyond the tie of friendship, even for
the interest of their own States; that he would at all times be willing to
give way unto an honest and fair agreement: Provided, that before any Treaty,
all States, Cities, and Provinces which had bin oppressed, should be
re-established, and satisfaction should be made to his Crown, for the charge
he had already been at, by reason of this War.

Having recommended the Government and vigilance over such places as he had
taken to the Governor thereof, he parted the Tenth of November from
Stralshund; and having brought his Army near Griffenburg, situated upon the
banks of Rega, a River which proceeding from a little Lake made by the River
Trage, falls into the Sea: He sent part of his Army before Coleburg, a place
seated upon the banks of the Baltique Sea, very strong both by Art and
situation; and knowing that to storm it, or take it by force would be a very
troublesome and dangerous business, and the loss of much time, to bring it to
effect; for it was well manned and munitioned: He laid siedge to it,
recommending the enterprise to Collonell Bandis, a Gentleman that very well
understood the affairs of War, and was much esteemed of by the King, and his
Commanders. He himself returned with the rest of his Army to Stettin; wherein,
receiving advertisement of the great preparations Tilly had made for the taking
of Magdeburg: And moreover, being informed by those he confided in, of the
intelligence held between the principal men, and the Roman Catholics of
that City, he was very much troubled; for he had framed unto himself great
designs upon the assistance of that place, which was one of the strongest,
richest, and best peopled Towns of all Germany, and in the heart of the best
Provinces thereof; so as if this should fail him, all his buildings raised
upon that foundation would come to naught: He therefore called the Barron
Falchenburg into his private Closet, a Dutch Cavaliere, much versed, as well in
Politic, as Martial Affairs; and having acquainted him with his thought, he
desired him to go speedily to that City to assist the Administrator thereof,
and advertise him of what he understood, to the end he might be more watchful
in the defense thereof, since the Inhabitants lived irregularly, trusting too
much to his fortune, believing his very effigies was enough to keep them from
all attempts of the Romanists. He also writ very effectual Letters to the
Magistrates there, acquainting them with the Imperialists intentions, and what
intelligences they there held; and to put them in mind, it behooved a better
guard should be set upon the Town, to secure it from the treachery of the Roman
Catholics, who coveted nothing more then their liberty. Leaving afterward
new orders in Stettin, and the neighboring places which were held by the
Soldiers, he marched two days journey along the Oder, to prevent the
mischief that might be done to those parts; for the numbers of the
Imperialists were increased by the arrival of Count Schamburg with new Forces,
and with Letters Pattents to command as General in the place of Torquato
Conti; who by reason of his indisposition of health, obtained leave of Caesar
at his own request to give over his charge: And seeming as if he would quarter
his men in the Towns thereabouts (for the season now grew too hard to lie in
the fields) he on the sudden returned to Stettin; passed over the River with
Twelve Thousand Foot, Six Thousand Horse, and seventy piece of Cannon, and on
Christmas day came before Griffenhaghen, a strong Town seated in the skirts of
Pomerania, toward the State of Brandenburg, upon the Oder, in a place fit for
defense: where making his diligent approaches on two sides, he so furiously set
upon it, as in a short time having beaten down many Towers, and made breaches
in a Rampard, he gave it a hot assault with Ladders, Mattocks, and courageous
men; to the which the Imperialists opposing themselves with no less ardour,
with Stones, Pikes, Muskets, and artificial fires, the scuffle was very
violent; for the Swedes encouraged by their King (who being a spectatour of all
that was done, thrust forward in person after the first or second Squadrons)
thronged through the Ditch, striving who should first mount the Rampires: after
some two hours fight, the Defendants having lost their Parrapet and
Pallasadoes, which served them for a fence to oppose the continual shot of
twenty six Piece of Cannon; whereby all those defenses were shattered in
pieces, not thinking themselves any longer safe in those Rampires, withdrew
themselves into a little Trench, which at that instant they had built within
the Wall, and suffered the Swedes to get up; who being got upon the Parapet,
and having immediately drawn three Piece of Cannon up after them, began to
play upon the works which the Imperialists had withdrawn themselves into;
wherein the Defendants kept themselves, and made them good till night; but not
knowing how to repel the Enemies, they bethought themselves of a Retreat, and
how they might abandon the City; they therefore stole out of the gate at five
of the clock at night: but being discovered by the Swedish Sentinels, a
private Alarm was given, and the Swedish Horse pursuing them, slew many of
them, and took many of them Prisoners: amongst which, was Ferdinando de Capua,
Governor of the Fort, and many other Gentlemen and Commanders of quality.

The loss of Griffenhaghen being of a very considerable effect, did much
stagger Shamburg, because by this loss the Imperialists were totally excluded
from coming into Pomerania: And because this being lost, it would be a very
hard matter to keep Gratz, a place of less defense, which lies on the West
side beyond the Oder, in an open Champion, and subject to the continual
incursions, and surprisals of the Garrison of Stettin; he called together his
Council of War, and asked their opinions what they thought was best to be done
upon this emergency, and in so cold a season, when as the earth was all covered
with Snow; whole squadrons, not inured to such sufferings and hardness
disbanded themselves: of all evils they chose the least, which was, to forsake
Gratz, and not stay the Kings coming: and to the end the Swedes might not
avail themselves thereof, they slighted it, freeing likewise all the
neighboring Country, they retired themselves with the gross of their Forces
to Frankfort upon Oder, a great and strong City, and of great importance for
their affairs, lying as the Center of Pomerania, Slecia, Saxony and
Brandenburg, environed with strong Rampires and large Ditches, which though
they were not complete defenses, yet not contemptible; here they haulted,
expecting Tilly with the Forces of the League, (who ill satisfied with
Magdeburgs declaration) was quartered thereabouts, resolving to be revenged on
them for their violated faith, by the coming of these, and the addition of
other Troops which were taken into pay by Commissarie Ossa in Sletia and
Moravia, he thought he should afterward be able to drive the Swedes from the
places they had taken; but whilst Schamburg had his thoughts busied upon these
affairs, the King the mean while advanced to Gratz; and finding it abandoned
by the Imperialists, found by their fear that they had not Forces sufficient
to resist him. Wherefore he resolved upon a brave enterprise, which was, to
march forward whilst Tillie was aloof off, whilst Fortune smiled upon him, and
whilst the Romanists fled: He therefore marched with his Army to Landsperg, a
Town environed with good and strong Walls, in a very considerable situation,
and a most important Passage, whereby an Ingresse was opened to the heart of
Sletia, standing upon the Banks of Wartha, a gallant River, which coming from
forth the utmost parts of Pomerania, near to a Village called Crowlant; after
a long course through the Country, falls into the Oder, between Franckfort,
and the Fort Castrin. But finding that this Enterprise would be very severe,
for that it was fraught with men and all things requisite for defense, he
altered his mind, and went from those parts, leaving the Martial Tod there
with some Regiments of Foot and Horse, to suppress the Sallyes which the
Imperialists of that Garrison made, and marched forward to effect what he had
long desired upon Franckfort; conceiving, that the winning thereof, would not
only put him in peaceable possession of Pomerania, and Marca nova; but (that
which most imported) that thereby his Passage being opened into Saxony, the
Marquisat of Brandenburg, Sletia, and Lusatia, (all of them great and rich
Provinces, and fit to maintain his Army a long time) he should ease the
Towns already taken, of quartering his Soldiers; so as being free to
traffic and husband their grounds, he from thence expected requisite
Provisions for his Army, and that it would be easy for him to lead his Forces
into the Emperors own Country, and that of Walesteines, where he might
increase his Army, and proceed to greater Conquests, since that the People of
those Provinces, being a fierce and Warlike People, and desirous of their
liberty of Conscience, would fly as fast to him, and to his succor, as does
the Be unto the Flower. But that which most of all invited him to this, was;
that by winning of this, he should come so near the Territories of the
Protestant Electors, as he might easily draw them to declare themselves in his
favor; for he very well knew that those Princes had more then once repented
themselves of having assisted the Emperor against the Elector Palatin and King
of Denmark, and of having fomented that greatness, which now stiling their
endeavors no more favors but duties, they had likewise almost enthralled their
own liberties.

Tilly being advertised of the bad condition his men were in, and how that many
of his discontented Soldiers fled over to the Swedes for want of pay, and by
reason of the hard duties they were put unto, and much apprehending the loss
of Franckfort and Landsperg, the best places which the Imperialists held in
those Provinces, he withdrew his Army from the Territories of Magdeburg, and
went in haste to Franckfort, whereinto, for the defense whereof he put three
Regiments of Foot, and one of Horse, mending such Fortifications as were
imperfect, and making new Works and Trenches without the Walls. Having taken
such Order as he thought fitting for the maintaining of the City, and having
brought all his Forces, as likewise them of Shamburgs into Baltagtion; he
Mustered them in the neighboring Fields; and finding them to be 34000 fighting
men, he gave them double pay, and marched straightway toward Landsperg,
as well to dislodge the Swedes from thereabouts, as to provide for his own
preservation. The Swedes did not stay his coming, but at the first news of
his Marching they raised their Tents, and joined themselves with the Kings
Army: which observing what way the Imperialists Forces took, kept near
Kastrin, a Fort belonging to the Elector of Brandenburg; where those that were
within, refusing to give them passage, though it were earnestly by the King
desired of their Master, he fell to build a Bridge over the River, thereby to
render the passage at Wartha unusefull to the Romanists. Castrin is seated in
the midst of Marca nova upon the Banks of Oder, not far from Wartha, which
commanding all the neighboring Country, makes it self Arbitrator of the
passage on that side of those two Rivers.

The Austrians having brought succor to these places, and having regained the
courage which they had lost by the Swedes prosperous proceedings: Tilly not
thinking it to purpose to advance further to win those holds, which being well
guarded by the Kings reinforced Garrisons, backed by the Army in the Field,
and secured by the devastation of the Country, he could promise nothing to
himself but the disbanding of his Army, which was already discontented for the
want of necessaries, and moneys, returned to his former Quarters of Magdeburg.

The King, who likewise thought it not now fitting time to try the issues of
his first resolutions, for that he had understood what Provisions Tilly had
sent into those Cities; and not thinking it advantageous for him to stay any
longer in those parts, betook himself to think how he might yet take any
Towns belonging to the Imperialists in Pomerania, or upon the Confines of the
Duchy of Mechelburg; he therefore raised his Camp from Lochinitz, a little
Town, which not long before had yielded it self upon Conditions, and turned
his march toward Mechelburg; hoping either to withdraw Tilly from his design
of Magdeburg* or (if he would not be brought off it) to make himself Master of
some places and passages of importance, by the winning whereof he might put
Pomerania in safety, and cause no small fear of his Forces in the Inhabitants
of Meckelburg. He returned to Stettin, and bringing his Army underneath
New-Brandenburg, he demanded the City of the Garrison thereof, which consisted
of five Companies of Foot, and three of Crabbatts; who not thinking themselves
able to contest within their unperfect walls, with an Army of twenty thousand
soldiers, presently conditioned, and yielded the Town, which was only
fortified after the ancient manner, with Towers, and Walls without Rampires. The
like did Loice upon the Confines of Pomerania, toward Mechelburg, upon the
banks of Pene, which having sustained two hundred Cannon shot, accorded; where,
whilst the King tarried two days, to learn in what condition the Romanists
were, Malchin fell likewise into his possession, a little Town watered by the
River Pena, environed with Walls, Towers and Ditches, after the ancient manner,
but well guarded and strengthened by Trenches and Earth-workes. This Town was
surprised by a Captain using a stratagem of fires which he there made, whereby
it seemed as if the whole Army had been there, when indeed he had with him but
three hundred Foot, and one Company of Horse; by means whereof, the Defendants
being scared, wanting their Governor, who was then with Shamburg, and
terrified by the means of this Captain, who summoned the Town, protesting
that any the least delay would so incense the King, as that he would put them
all to the sword, they yielded. The King coming afterward out of Lotz, on the
12th of February, came before Dammin, a Fortress of great importance, very
well fortified; well stored with all provisions requisite to the maintaining of
a strong place, and seated upon a very considerable passage, upon the Pene;
between the Confines of Pomerania, and the Duchy of Mechelburg. Upon this
Town Tilly did much rely: for when this Town (as he persuaded himself it
would) should have held the King play, it would be a fitting time for him to
encounter with the Swedes, and draw them to battle upon disadvantage, on the
event whereof the Total of all affairs depended; but the King drawing near
the Town with covered Trenches, erected three Batteries upon certain
platformes of earth, battering the walls with much violence; so as the
soldiers within the Castle, who were five disheartened Foot Companies; for all
that Duke Savel could say or do, to persuade them to defend the place, and
expect succor (which might very easily be brought them) basely apprehending
the Swedes violence, were the cause why Savell bethought himself to make
conditions as he did, being sorely tormented with the frequent shot, which
scattered all their defenses and houses in pieces, insomuch as the affrighted
Inhabitants, rather desired to yield up the City, then to be liable to the
sufferings and danger they underwent by keeping it. Tilly was very ill
satisfied with the surrender of this place, who not able to contain his anger,
which too apparently might be read in his countenance, considering that 17.
Companies of old experienced Soldiers had so woefully surrendered this
strength, which was held one of the best of all those Provinces, accused Savell
of negligence, though the fault was in some other Captains; and particularly,
in those that had the charge of the Castle; and was so much incensed against
him, as that he dismissed him out of the Army, and sent him to plead his
justification at Vienna. Tilly taking his way from thence toward the Duchy of
Mechelburg, with above Twenty Thousand Soldiers came before New-Brandenburg;
he took it by storm, and put all that were in it to the Sword, for their
having so cowardly surrendered the Town to King Gustavus: He did the like at
Faldisburg, the defendants whereof not yielding presently to his threats, and
to the offers he made them; he made a gallant onset, forced the few Swedish
defendants that were therein, the greatest part whereof were by his men slain;
a cruelty not formerly used by Tilly, who being very religious, could not choose
but use clemency: but for that anger, like fire thrown into disposed
Materials, consumes what withstands it. The ill usage the Imperialists had at
diverse encounters received from the Swedes, made him alter his accustomed
clemency, thinking the losses and injuries he had received were not to be
revenged by Charity.

But if those successes did please this ancient Commander, the news of the
loss of Coleburg for want of Victuals did much displease him; for this being
a Fortress of great consideration upon the Baltique Sea, the Mastership
whereof was held by the Swedish Fleet, the Swedes might so well nestle
themselves therein, as it would be very hard for the Forces of the Roman
Catholics, though seconded by good fortune to drive them thence, since they
might be easily succored with Victuals, or what else they wanted by Sea. Tilly
therefore desirous that his fame which he had so gloriously won, should not be
obscured by the peoples murmuring; who not believing the juncture of times, nor
the alterations of worldly affairs, are only pleased or displeased according
to the success of what presents it self before their eyes; and very wisely
foreseeing what lets he might meet withal if he should march forward with his
Forces to regaine what was lost in Pomerania, where he should not only find the
people resolute in their own defense, but likewise many Troops of Swedes
there, he turned his thoughts upon Magdeburg; an undertaking, which by how much
the more difficult it was, so much more would his glory appear therein, and
the Protestants be the more terrified; since he should not only thereby free
himself from the frequent Incursions, which from thence was made upon such
neighboring parts as were well affected to Caesar, but by this Sanctuary, he
should stop the Carriere of the Kings vast Designs; but that which chiefly
concerned him was, that by winning this place, and making it the seat of his
Forces, since it stood in the Center of those Provinces, he might easily lead
his Men into what part he best liked: and the Protestant Electors and other
Haunce Towns, who might peradventure stagger in their wonted friendship and
obedience to Caesar; their intentions being by this Key locked up, and their
affection to the Swedes concealed, they could neither so easily foment the
Kings proceedings, nor refuse the desires of the Roman Catholics; raising
therefore his Camp from the aforesaid Towns, he within a few days pitched
his Tents in the sight of Magdeburg: And being advertised that the enemy had
built a Fort upon the Elb, a League distant from the City, thereby to receive
the succor more easy which they expected from Saxony, the Elector whereof,
though he had not yet declared himself for them, they hoped that for his own
Interest he would not suffer the City to be lost; and this being to the
advantage of the City, Tilly thought fit to lodge some men between this Fort
and it; whereby the intercourse between the one and the other being hindered,
and succor thereby inhibited, the Fort could not be maintained; which fell out
luckily: for the Captain who commanded in chief in the Fort, and who never
before had been conversant in war, was so surprised with fear, as not making
any part of that defense he might, he cowardly surrendered the place. Princes
who either flattered by their affection to their servants, or too much given to
thrift, confer places of command upon such as are unexperienced in War: if
they desire to be served after this manner, let them admire this example. The
Romanists having won this place, they diligently assaulted Prester, a Sconce
defended by good Foot; but the City fearing lest the Imperialist, should
likewise Plant themselves between this and the Walls of the City, the like
might befall them, as had done by the former, resolved to forsake it, and to
withdraw the men therein into the Sconce of Zoll, which was nearer their Walls,
and which they had fortified to their best advantage.

Whilst some Regiments of the Romanists Army labored hard with great Forces on
this side, under the Command of Merodes Fucarie and Baldirow, Colonells of the
League; Count Mansfield on the other side assaulted the Fort of Bucaw, and the
Defendants wanting both Victuals and Ammunition, he took it: Whereupon, the
City was beset at a nearer distance, and Tilly seeing the success of his
endeavors, made nearer Approaches with his Trenches, thinking to lodge
himself between the Sconce Zoll and the City. Thus for want of men experienced
in war, the Magdenburgians do shamefully lose those outward Forts, which
they with so much charge had built, and by which they might for a time have
kept the Enemy aloof from their City.

The King seeing the Romish Army employed there, not knowing how to bring them
useful succors, if he did not first make himself Master of such Passages and
Places as were a hindrance to his Army, marched on the 26. of March to the
enterprise of Franckfort; March 26.
and having gotten under Zenedick, a place wherein the Imperialists held a
Garrison, he drew near to Franckfort; where, though he found great great store
of Roman Catholic Soldiers, as likewise the Marshall Tieffenbeck, who failed
not as the King moved, to do his best in preparing for defense, he beset it on
three sides with five Batteries, which played continually: and the Trenches of
Approach were with all diligence brought by the Swedes even to the edge of the
Ditch of the outworks: whereat the Imperialists were so astonished, as though
they wanted neither Men, Munition, nor good Rampires for their Defense; yet for
that bold enterprises are for the most part seconded by Fortune, they seemed
(as if they had been enchanted) to have lost their senses: for at the very
first onset, they (little to their honor) forsook a strong Tenaglia, which for
the better defense of the Port, Geben was guarded by four hundred Foot, which
was the chief cause of the loss of the City: for the Swedes, as the enemy
retired, got upon the Rampire, and advanced even to the Drawbridge of the
Gate, where making two Petars to play, they at five of the Clock at night
entered; and because the entrance of the second Gate was stiffly resisted, which
being enclosed with a great Trench, furnished with many Morter-Peeces, was not
to be won. The King, who upon such like occasions was beyond measure diligent
and fortunate; casting his eye upon the Wall, which within the Gate was upheld
by the ramm'd in earth of the Bulwarks, made it suddenly be dug through: And
whilst the Imperialists busied themselves in the defense of the second Gate,
not foreseeing the Kings design on the other part, fifty of the boldest of the
Kings Foot entered by the hole in the Wall upon the Rampires, and won two
Caveliers which stood over the Wall on the left hand of the said Gate; and
turning the Cannon upon the City, did by this surprisall so amaze the
besiedged, as not knowing what to do, they began to think how to save their
lives: therefore making no longer resistance, they ran toward the Gate that
leads to the Oder, that they might pass over and retire themselves in safety
to Landsperg: But the Swedes roundly charging them, and the Imperialists not
finding free passage over the Bridge; for it was encumbered with Carriages, most
part of the Soldiers fell into the water, and were at the mercy of their
Enemies, who in hot blood (as in such encounters is usually seen) refused to
give life to any one that looked like a Soldier, and took the City, using
such severe cruelty, as in the like case is usually done by Soldiers.

The loss of Franckfort, which was guarded by Six Thousand Soldiers, as it
was of great prejudice to the Austrian affairs, and a great abatement to the
courage and hopes of the Romanists, the greater was the advantage the Swedish
occasions got thereby; and the greater the Kings comfort, who seeing it was now
no longer time to pause, but to display the sails of diligence before the good
wind of propitious Fortune; leaving good guard at Franckfort, and fitting
directions for the conservation thereof, he unlooked for, threw himself upon
Crossen, placed in that Angle of the River Queis, which gushing out of the
Oder, gives the name to a good space of ground; and then enlarging it self to
the Confines of Brandenburg and Sagar, runs into Pomerania and Sletia. Crossen
was defended by three hundred Imperialists, and many of the best Inhabitants of
the neighboring Villages had withdrawn themselves, and the best things they
had thither. From thence he came before Landsperg, against which he planted his
batteries, and began his Trenches; whilst those of the Garrison did valiantly
oppose the Swedes: The young Count de Gratz, who commanded in chief within the
Town, and who was a gallant Commander, and one on whom the Soldiers did very
much rely, was slain in a brave sally which he made against the Swedes first
works. The King hereupon threatening a general assault, the Soldiers being
much danted by the death of their Chiefetany, and the harms which they
continually received from the Enemy, resolved to come to an agreement; as they
did on the sixteenth of April, April 16.
One thousand five hundred Foot, marching forth with their weapons, bag and
baggage, Drums beating, matches lighted, and four pieces of Cannon.

By this loss of Landsperg, the way being opened to the Swedes into the
Electorate of Brandenburg, the King thought he had fitting occasion to persuade
the Elector to declare himself; since that his Country being exposed to the
Invasion of the Kings Forces, it was not to be believed that that Prince, who
was allied unto him by blood, and of the same Religion, would refuse his
friendship for the Emperors, of whose power the Princes of Germany, especially
the Protestants, were not a little jealous. Having then made a Bridge upon
Boats over the River Spree, a River which comes from the furthermost parts of
Bohemia, toward the upper Lusatia, and by her watering those Provinces, is of
much advantage to them, he sent a Trumpet into Brandenburg, and desired he
might be received in as a friend; but there being in the Town a Governor with
some of the Forces of the League, the King was entreated to tarry till they
might advertise Tilly, and twelve days being granted them to this purpose, the
said Soldiers did (those days being expired) forsake the Town, and withdrew
themselves into the Camp before Magdeburg: the King entered thereinto to the
great content of the people; where making no stay, he advanced forward toward
Berlin, the place of the Electors residence, situated upon the side of the said
Spree, where the Elector then was; thinking it fitting and becoming civility
to use fair means first, and to captivate the Electors good will rather by
agreement, than by force, He sent the Count Ortenberg to Berlin, to acquaint
him with the reasons of his coming into his Territories, where he intended to
demean himself, as a friend and kinsman, and that his undertakings had only
respect to the Common liberty, and the preservation of Religion (for the which
all Princes were bound to unsheath their Swords) and to moderate the greatness
of that House, which too greedy of other men's Dominions, aimed at nothing but
to command over all; that his intention was to succor Magdeburg, which was in
amity with him, and in all respects worthy of his protection; he therefore
invited his Highness to do the like, and to lend him assistance, the Electors
being no less obliged to the defense of the Common liberty, then were the
other Protestants; that therefore he desired Kusterin and Spandaw for his own
security, and Victuals and Ammunition for his Army during the enterprise. But
Ortenbergs negotiation doing no good, nor yet the like of Gustavus Horn, who
was sent after the other by the King to the same purpose, he resolved to march
forward with his Army; for that love joined with fear, might peradventure make
him incline to that which was balanced with another greater doubt.

The Elector bearing of the Kings being come, and knowing himself to be so
inferior in strength and other succors, as that he could not shun this visit,
making use of this just occasion to excuse himself unto the Emperor, for that
he was necessitated by Arms, and the self interest of his own State, and out
of no other reason, to make friendship with the King, he together with the
greatest part of his nobility came forth of Berlin to meet the King: with whom
after he had discoursed two hours, and was satisfied with his negotiation, he
offered to assist him in all he could, declared himself to be one of his
confederates; And having sumptuously received him into Berlin, he assigned over
unto him Spandaw and Kusterin; but the King thought he should not be able to
succor Brandenburg with his own Forces only, which were much lessened by the
Garrisons he was forced to leave in such places as he had taken, besides the
Troops of Soldiers which he had sent with Baudis and Horn, to wait upon
Shamburg and Tieffenbach, whose numbers every day increasing in the Duchy of
Crossen and Sletia, it seemed they aimed at some great business. All things
fitting therefore agreed upon between him and the Elector, he went from Berlin,
and coming to Potstin a place between Berlin and Brandenburg, upon the banks
of Havell, he invited the Duke of Saxony to join with him in the relieving of
Magdeburg, or at least, that he would give passage for his Army to do it. But
the Elector who was afraid to offend Tilly, and to draw the War into his own
Country, with great complements, but uncorrespondent effects, answered; That he
had taken an Oath unto the Emperor, that he had not yet had any occasion to
violate it; nor to adhere to any resolution, which might prove prejudicial to
Caesar's Crown; all these excuses seemed to little purpose, and invalid to the
King: who thought that the Austrians bare attempting upon the liberty of a
Hauns Town, to the which they had no pretense, had been reason enough to make
the Duke resolve to assist him, without scruple of breach of his promise or
Oath, since nothing was demanded of the Emperor, but that which he unduly
usurped, he signified unto him that he would hereafter repent of this, and that
all in good time he would put him in mind of it: yet neither these, nor any
other reasons were able to prevail with the Elector; for he being howsoever
subject to eminent danger, the Armies of both Parties lying round about him, he
very cunningly held off to see how affairs went, thinking himself as a great
Prince, to be always in condition to declare himself time enough for that
side, by which his Territories might be the more secured.

Tilly much troubled at the Kings so prosperous success, especially that he
should make himself Master of their best strengths in sight (as a man may say)
of his Army, revolved many things in his mind, how he might regaine his
oppressed reputation, and get some advantage by this war; On the one side,
the loss of those Cities which were recommended to the care of his Valor did
much torment him, and therefore willingly would he have marched to the
regaining of them: on the other side, he solaced himself again in the
consequence of the business of Magdeburg, on the perfecting of which Siege his
mind was still bent; the which if he should give over, it was most apparent,
that he should not only grow less in men's opinion, but the Protestants
gathering daily better heart, much trouble would thereby redound unto him;
moreover the Swedes having this place of refuge, struck awe into all the
Provinces of Germany, since thereby they had passage to turn themselves
whither they list, which would cause a general fear throughout all the
neighboring parts: But that which was of greatest concernment, was; that if
the King might have that City for a shelter to himself and his Army, he would
not only overrun all the parts thereabouts, but might lead his Forces into
Bohemia, which was full of Protestants ill-affected to the Imperialists, and
undoubtedly bring the Elector of Saxony, and the rest of the Hauns Towns to
declare themselves; on whose friendship the Imperialists did very much build.
Setting therefore aside all the vexation he received by the daily news of the
Swedes proceedings, he applied himself wholly to the winning of Magdeburg;
the which it is thought he the rather did, for that he held secret
Intelligence within the Town. The Roman Catholics were thus quartered at the
siege of Magdeburg; Tilly kept his Quarters about the Sconce Zoll; Count
Popenhaine environed the ways that led from Newstat; the Duke of Holestaine
enlarged his Quarters almost to Croken; and Count Mansfield bound in the
Precincts of the Camp with his Station on the side of Heckdeck and the Fort
Marsh. They had already made their approaches on these four sides, even to the
edge of the Counterscarfe; but their entrance thereupon was hindered by the
continual playing of the Cannon and Muskets from the Town: insomuch as Tilly
perceiving it would be a business of difficulty, and that all delay redounded
much to the prejudice of his intentions, betook himself to stratagem; and
using the correspondency which he held within the Town that were
well-affected to the Imperial party, he withdrew his Artillery from the
Batteries against the Bulwarks of Lauburg, to the end that by this cessation,
the besieged might be enamoured of the Kings happy proceedings, and might
think that the Enemies Army being thereby called back, was now providing to
dislodge. This their seeming removal was well handled by them, and better
confirmed by those they held correspondency withal within the Town; for they
making as if they knew that Tilly was providing to be gone, did with
extraordinary joy divulge their opinions: whereupon, conformable to humane
nature, which is well pleased when events prove answerable to their desires,
even drunk with this hope, and blinded with this conceit, they studied more
how to express their joy with invitations and feastings then with diligence,
and sufficient guards to watch over their own safety. Tilly being punctually
advertised of all these things, thought it not good to let slip this occasion,
but to effect what he had determined, with all his art and industry; he to this
purpose, May 19.
on the 19 of May, called Popenhaine, and all the Generals and Captains of
the Army to a Council of War, where having discoursed upon this design,
they all joined in a resolution to set upon the Walls of the City on all sides
by a general and valiant Scalado: For being advertised by their Spies, that
Guards were not kept, and that through the confidence the Citizens had in their
Works, they little minded their keeping of Sentinels, they hoped without doubt
to reap some good hereby. The Agreement then being made, having chosen out the
Valiantest and Ablest Men they had, and made Provision of Ladders, Bridges, and
Petars, on the 20 day of the said Month, May 20.
early in the morning, before the break of day, the Sign was given by the
discharging of 30 pieces of Cannon, and Popenhaine, Mansfield, Tilly, and the
Duke of Holesteine, did from their several Quarters furiously set upon the
City Walls, commanding their Musketeers, who were placed upon the edge of the
Counter-scarffe, to shoot incessantly, to keep them off that should come to
the Parrapits; and that the Soldiers appointed thereunto should Scale the
Walls, which on all sides was punctually observed: But no breach being made,
and it proving very hard for the Soldiers to Scale those high Walls with their
Ladders, they being likewise so well flanked with opposite Bulwarks, they were
forced to give over with no little loss. Popenhaine notwithstanding, who knew
by the intelligence he had, that the place he was to assault was the weakest
and worst manned, egged on his Soldiers, assuring them of Rich Booties, and
threatening those that should give back; and though many tumbled from off the
Ladders into the Ditches, yet their places were continually supplied by fresh
men; who enraged at the difficulty they met withal, and the succor not being
yet come which sent by Falckenbridge, they got unto the top of the Parrapet,
and raised up an Ensign, whereat their companions much encouraged, cried out,
Victory, Victory; and Scaling the Walls, a vye by whole Squadrons, and covering
themselves with earth by the means of their Mattocks and Spades, they turned
the Cannon upon the City, and at last got further ground. For after a long and
obstinate resistance they won into a street, and followed by the other
Soldiers who were the more eager, for that they had been beaten back; they
without any mercy slew the Defendants and Citizens, and the City was in short
time sacked and burnt to ashes: which happened by the carelesenesse of a
Soldier, who throwing aside his Musket with the Match lighted, to get up the
stairs in a Drugsters house, the Match set fire on a barrel of Brimstone, and
this taking hold of other cumbustable matters, the fire did so dilate it self,
as the houses being built of wood all was destroyed. The cruelties used by the
Soldiers in the sacking of this City, was such as is fearful to say or
write; Let it suffice, that good men were of opinion, that God was then so
incensed against the Roman Catholics, as that he permitted that fire, to the
end, that they might not enjoy the wealth, which with more sobriety and
humanity they might have possessed themselves of.

THe taking of Magdenburg, and the usage there, as it was to all men
unexpected, so was it of great grief to the Protestants; who well weighing
this event, began to lessen their high pitched thoughts, wherein they had
formerly framed unto themselves such vast designs: for they argued, that if
the Romanists had with so little labor taken so strong a City, and of such
defense, they would more easily take others which partooke of much
imperfection. The Swedes and their King were in particular very much grieved
hereat: the King himself was more vexed then any other at the loss of this
City, that since it did so freely declare it self for him, he should suffer it
to be lost in the sight even as it were of his so victorious an Army, he struck
his foot against the ground, and vowed to revenge, and to serve them the same
sauce, who had used themselves so inhumanly; he more particularly resented the
behavior of the Soldiers of the League, who had been more barbarous in their
usage then the rest: And least the other Cities which were ready to side with
him might by this success be deluded, and so stagger in their resolutions, as
doubting his assistance; he published in Print the reasons and causes of this
loss, and why he had not formerly succored it; That the fault lay in the
Citizens themselves, who not valuing his Counsel, and not seeking to obviate
the treachery of their Magistrates, had of themselves pulled this ruin upon
them; that he had played the part of a good friend by the taking of many almost
impregnable places; that the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony had denied him
passage; that he neither could, neither ought he to march four Leagues in an
Enemies Country, with so many Cities at his back, and on all sides of him, by
which his Army might without fighting been utterly lost; that the best he could
do, was to take in Franckfort, Landsperg, and other places which made for his
advancing, and that he had spared no labor, nor pretermitted any diligence to
relieve it.

Tilly stayed six days after this about Magdeburg, where he caused Te deum to
be sung, and took order for the recruiting of his Army, and leaving Philip
Count Mansfield there in place of Commissary and Governor; and for that he was
informed that the King of Sweden was come unto Tangermund, a Town not far
from thence, watered by the Elbe, where he had thrown over a Bridge, and
provided for his safety, by cutting of two strong Trenches on both sides the
River, he thought it was now time to provoke him to battle, upon the Victory
whereof the re-establishment of affairs did depend, he therefore marched with
his Army toward these parts, intending to fight with him: But the King knew
himself not to be in case with those few Forces he had, to join battle with
an Army versed in victories; and this the rather, for that he had sent Gustavus
Horn away with part of his Army to the taking in of Gripswould; he therefore
stayed within his Trenches, yet seemed not at all to fear the Enemy, but kept
in play with frequent skirmishes both of Horse and Foot: And being desirous to
recrute his Army, he arose from before Tangermund, and leaving strong Garrisons
in Franckfort, Landsperg, and other parts thereabouts, he came to Stettin to
raise fresh Troops; and that he himself might go in person to Gripswould, not
so much to strengthen Horn, as to give Audience to certain Ambassadors, and
other Ministers of State, touching businesses of great importance.

Tilly believing by this retreat, that the King was afraid, and that he rather
intended to look homewards then to advance further, brought his Army before
Tangermund, forced it to surrender, and won diverse other places of no great
consideration; and judging it not then fitting time to lie before strong holds,
which would require much time, and great expense both of men and money, when
the Protestants grew stronger in all parts; He advised with his Commanders, and
it was generally agreed upon, that they would wage War with the Landsgrave of
Hessen, as with one who having declared himself for the King, was busy in
raising of Forces to the no little pressure of the Austrians: for this
Gentleman being a young courageous Prince, given to love War, Master of a State
in the midst of those Provinces which kept their allegiance to the Emperor,
if his Forces should increase, they ought the more to have an eye upon him, for
that he held good correspondency with the States of Holland, which republique
was much increased in power and reputation of War, so as that he would not
only prove a great diversion to their proceedings, but would have still kept
the Roman Catholics in those parts in work; for the greatest part of the
Towns which confined upon him, appertaining to the Electors of Cullen, Mentz,
and to the Bishops and Princes of Munster, Pa^erborn, Fulda, and other
Fewdatories of the Empire, weak (of themselves) to contend with so Fresh an
Army; it either behooved the Emperor answerable to his Obligation, to assist
them with a strength of people in their defense, by which the Forces of the
other Armies which were in the field against the Swedes would be much
dimembered and divided, or else it could not be shunned, but that these might
by some prejudicial agreement defend themselves from the War, wherewith they
were then threatened: He therefore thought it agreeable to the rules of Command,
first to secure himself on this side, rather then by his Arms to make Saxon
declare himself, since that words were of no availement; that the Protestants
being bereaft of this leaning stock, and of the hopes which they might
conceive upon the diversion of so great a Prince, he might easily come to fight
with the King, and drive him from the places he had possessed himself of. The
Landsgrave being therefore out of his own Dominions, as gone in person to the
Camp before Gripswould to confer and treat with the King. Tilly thought he
might do well, by a complementing Letter to put the Landsgraves Subjects in
mind of their Masters error, who puffed up with too much youthful hear, had
forgone his allegiance to the Emperor, and joined himself with a stranger
Prince, whose only drift was to bring ruin upon those miserable and innocent
people; So as they foolishly embracing these unsubsistancies, went astray from
the good way, putting themselves upon narrow and dangerous paths, and that
therefore they ought no more to receive him back, for that he would send them
sufficient aid to confirm their quiet, and establish their liberty* But these
words working little effect with those people, who very well knew they could
not withdraw themselves from the subjection of their lawful Lord and Master,
without submitting themselves to the Government of another, they did but laugh
at Tillyes promises and threats, and prepared themselves for defense.

The King this mean while, coming himself in Person into the Camp at
Gripswould, he rejoiced the hearts of all the Army, as does a timely shower the
scorched up ground; and by this time the besieged finding themselves weakened,
and the Swedes with their Galleries and Traverses advancing even into the
Ditch, and seeing the general assault, which in the presence of their King
they were preparing to give them, they yielded the Town upon condition, that
the Garrison might march forth with their Arms, Baggage, and two Pieces of
Cannon; after which, being advertised how the Dukes of Mechelburg (who after
the loss of their State, usurped from them by the Emperor, had retired
themselves to Lubeck, a Hauns Town, and one of the chief Cities of Germany,
upon the Trave) had (answerable to the agreement) raised a pretty Force of
Horse and Foot, he thought the occasion fitting to re-place those Princes in
their Dominions: Whereupon leading his Army on to this purpose, he took
diverse places and Towns which were yet held by the Imperialists, opening the
way for the said Princes to return into their own Countries, and totally
driving all the Imperial Forces out of such Cities and Towns as belonged to
them, which it was easy for the King to do, for the greatest part of the Roman
Catholics having withdrawn themselves from that Province, knowing how hard it
would be for them to maintain those Towns, had betook themselves to the
defense of Rostock and Weismar, which being moreover very well fortified, their
Patrimonies would be by their means easily preserved, and be afterward much
helped to drive the Swedes away from the places they had taken, when the Roman
Catholics Army should by them have received any advantage; all the other
Towns being then come in unto the King, and he knowing that these two Cities,
whilst they kept themselves for the Emperor, did make all undertakings upon
that State invalide, for that all the rest of the Provinces being an open
champion, and not furnished with places of safe refuge, they should upon any
approach of the Imperialists, be enforced to forgo their Quarters in those
weak Towns* and the Austrians by means of these two places whereunto they
might retreat, might easily keep the Dominion and possession of them, and so
not be totally dispossessed; He resolved to fortify Anclam, a place strongly
seated upon the River Pene, in the Navell of Pomerania, not far from the Lake
of Gross Haff, by the which securing unto himself the Neighboring Country,
this place was of no small moment.

Having taken such order as he thought convenient for the taking of these,
before which he left Banniere with about Six Thousand Soldiers, he re-placed
the Dukes his Nephews in their Dominions, and making the Inhabitants swear
fealty to them, he thought it not good to tarry longer in those parts, but to
return to Pomerania; and by the advancement of his Forces to get Saxony to
declare himself, and to endeavor new acquisitions, the which he did, not only
by reason of Tillies absence, promise unto himself, but that by this Invasion,
he should occasion such diversion, as he should force Tilly to forsake his
design upon the Landsgrave.

Raising thus his Camp from before Gustrow, a Town seated in the Center of
that Province, defended by no very exact ancient Walls, and watered by Nuball,
upon which great Barks do sail even to Rostock, he made have to Berlin; and
from thence sending his Army toward Borth, he planted his Camp before
Brandenburg: and having sent Collonell Ranzaw, a man of an undaunted courage,
and perfect valor, with some of his Forces on the other side of the Elb; he
with a Petard surprised Tangermund, by which his way was open into the lower
Saxony, and to the Bishopric of Magdeburg: He with great Force set upon
Werben upon the Elb, seated in no contemptible place, fortified after the
ancient manner, and defended by about One Thousand Two Hundred men, part
Soldiers, part men of the Country; he forced it to yield, where leaving some
Soldiers for a guard, giving order for necessary Fortifications for the
defense of it, and throwing a Bridge of Boats over the River, he Quartered
himself between that and Havell.

Here he gave in charge to Bannier to go before Havelbergk, of the said
Province, seated upon the River Havell, and not far from Elb; who presently
placing his Batteries against it, and having made his approaches even to the
walls, which being weak and unperfectly built, did not long hold out, after
nine days the Inhabitants, knowing they could no longer withstand the Swedes
assaults, yielded themselves, 800 Soldiers marching out of the Town, part of
which took entertainment from the King.

By these prosperous successes of the Swedes, and by the news that the Queen
of Sweden was already landed at Wolgast with 6000 fighting men; and by reason
of diverse other preparations made by the King in diverse places, the minds of
the Romanists were extremely disquieted, and the Swedes encouraged: whereupon,
the King very desirous to recover Magdeburg, that he might draw nearer to the
Duke of Saxony, whose declaring of himself, he knew to be of all things else
most necessary for him, as likewise to divert Tilly from invading the
Landsgraves Country, who presently wheeled about, and came to Wolmerstat, a
Town above Magdeburg, where he stayed and quartered his Army, dispersing his
Horse about the Neighboring Villages, that he might observe what course the
King would take.

But the Swedes advertised of these Designs, and having moreover certain
Intelligence, how that two of the Imperialists Regiments of Horse, (who had
quartered themselves in the Village Kolbits, four leagues distant from
Tangermund) did much neglect their Guards, he thought he might defeat them;
rising therefore privately to this purpose from a Town upon the Elb, between
Werben and Tangermund, on the 10th of July, July, 10.
two hours before day, with 3000 Horse, and 500 Dragoones, he speedily marched
toward the Imperialists Quarters: And that he might the better know their
condition and position, he sent Count Ortenbergs Sergeant Major before with an
hundred Horse, who was afterward followed by the rest of the Body of Horse; so
as before the Austrians could get their Horses out of their stables, and
prepare for defense, the greatest part of them were slain and taken prisoners
by the Swedes, who likewise marched on an other side toward the Regiment of
one Hol^k a Caesarian Colonel, who was lodged at Borch stal, a Village not far
from Tangermund, and who with his Forces endeavored to resist the Swedes; yet
the Swedes charging in very good order, it behooved him to quit the Field, and
betake himself to his heels, with the loss of three Cornets, and about three
hundred Horse. In this surprisall the Count Otto Lodovico Ryngrave, did
together with his soldiers gallantly behave himself: this Gentleman was of
much esteem amongst the Dutch, and of the best blood of Germany, and in former
times his Ancestors had great possessions about the River of Rhyne; but
through the evilnesse of times having lost all, and remembering the former
greatness of his Family, he (together with his Brother Count Philip) put
himself into the Kings service, and being under so fortunate a guide, they fed
themselves with undoubted hopes of vast designs.

The King encouraged by these favorable accidents, and interpreting them as
preludiums to greater glory, marched forward with the remainder of his Army,
and with his Cannon, and incamping himself between the Villages of Belgen and
Steindall, between the Elb, and the Bise, he resolved to stay a while in that
advantageous situation, to observe what Tillies intentions were; who awakened
by such advertisements, and thinking that he suffered not a little in his
reputation, in that the Swedish Forces which he so undervalued, had such happy
success, he rose from Wolmerstat, and having regained Tangermund, he was got
too before the Trenches of Werben, where some of the Swedish Regiments were
encamped, who by reason of Tillies moving were by the King in diligence sent
thither; for the maintenance of that place was of great moment, so as, as well
in respect of the reputation of those Forces which did defend it, as for that
the City being won by the Roman Catholics, the King was to retreat many
leagues backward, and his entrance into the Towns upon the Ohre would be
hereby hindered ( Ohre is a River which takes its beginning from the Confines
of the State of Lunenburg, toward the County of Danneberg* ioynes it self
with the El^ not far from Magdeburg) for it was not likely he would undertake
the taking of them, until he should be sure of a safe refuge, whereto upon
occasion he might retreat, he for these respects raised the Imperial batteries
against Werben, which were likewise played upon by the reciprocal shot of the
Swedish Artillery, and by constant Sallyes; but the Imperialists violence
growing greater and greater, the Defendants being neither able longer to defend
themselves against them, nor yet any place being left for the Kings supply, to
boot that it was not time to hazard all upon one days work, upon which the
summa totalis lay, they resolved to forgo the place, lest by articling they
might seem to be overcome; and this they so ingeniously did, leaving many
women and children to defend their Works, as (unperceived by the Imperialists)
they had time enough to retreat in safety, before the others were aware of
their Stratagem. Tilly coming thither afterward, and making his Army
immediately to advance after them, he was by frequent skirmishes seen to draw
near the Kings Quarters inviting him to battle: But the King, who knew it was
not yet time to try his fortune with an Enemy that was stronger then himself,
and who was fraught with victory and confidence, bridled his desires: and not
budging from the advantage he had, enforced Tilly, (who finding himself now in
a wasted Country suffered no little scarcity of Forage) to think upon an
unpleasing retreat; so as raising his Army from the Quarters where they were,
and going from thereabouts, he marched toward his former Quarters. This
Retreat did more imbolden the Kings Officers, which was afterward allayed by
an unwary resolution of theirs: For according to their usual wont,
courageously assaulting the Imperialists in the Rear, they were valiantly by
them opposed; and the Romanists having at last the better, many of the Swedes
were cut in pieces, and some of their Cornets lost* yet returning again to
face Tilly, they prepared for a greater encounter; when Tilly understanding
that the King had received fresh supply of 8000 men brought unto him by
Gustavus Horn, and Baudis, from Pomerania and the parts about Brandenburg, and
his want of Provision for his Horse continually increasing, resolved to return
to Tangermund, and to quarter his Army between that place and Eisteben, and
there to attend the coming of Count Fistemberg; who being recalled from the
Order he had given him to go against the Landsgraves Country, was as yet upon
the Territories of the Abbat of Fulda, an Ecclesiastical Prince, and likewise
Administrator in Civil affairs, chosen thereunto by a Chapter of Cannons, who
govern that City as a Commonwealth. Fulda is seated in Franconia, between the
County of Henneberg, and the State of Hesse upon the River Fuld, which receives
its name from thence; which issuing from near the Village Ramers in Franconia,
runs into Weser, not far from Muiden, it is not numbered amongst the strong
places, for that it is only environed with old walls: by this re-inforcement he
might likewise speak the more boldly with the Duke of Saxony, who making merry
with him, was ready to join with the Kings party, and hereby he might likewise
more boldly fight with the Swedes.

The King this mean while well informed from all parts of these proceedings of
the Romanists, saw he was not in condition to hazard himself in further
advancements, for that new Forces being continually added to the former, and he
finding himself sufficiently weakened by the continual actions of his own
men, it was very dangerous to join Battle with that Army, which being led on
by an old Commander, knew not what it was to lose: He therefore resolved to
tarry upon the Elb, and Havell, and to hinder the Imperialists from advancing
upon the parts thereabouts, held by the Swedish Forces. He foresaw that Tilly
not permitting the Duke of Saxony to continue a Neuter, would force him first
by his importunities, and then by his Arms to declare himself, from which he
could not but expect great advantage: For the Elector ill satisfied with the
Austrians, and seeing the Kings assistance near at hand, 'twas likely that
upon any slight occasion he would lay hold upon any pretense, and discover
which way he was inclined. He then quartered himself near Werben, which he had
again won by surprisall. He left Gustavus Horn with some Forces of Horse
and Foot about Brandenburg. He recommended the custody of Retinaw (a place
though of no great account, yet at this time (upon this occasion) very
considerable, as being seated upon the Havell, between the Cities of Havelburg
and Brandenburg) to Colonel Tod, a Soldier of great experience, a native of
Germany, and of good blood; thinking by keeping himself in these strong holds,
and thereby hindering the Roman Catholics from dreaming of passing the River,
and going to recover such Towns as had been taken in those parts, and upon
the Oder, he should keep the Enemy in perpetual exercise with evident danger,
and make him (who was not able to subsist in those parts impoverished by the
daily incursions of both parties) rise from thence, and retreat to his great
loss of Honor, and to the prejudice of those parts which yet kept their
allegiance to Caesar; he was hereunto also persuaded out of another reason,
that the Imperialists could not keep themselves any long time in those
Quarters, without giving jealousy to Saxony, whose estate for any good order
that could be taken by the Militia, could not so sufficiently defend it self,
but that it must receive injuries by the insolences of the Soldier, and such
parties as were wont to scour the Champion, which if it should so fall out, it
would redound much to the Kings advantage; for that this Elector, little apaid
with the Actions of the Imperialists, and exceedingly troubled at the
declaration made a little before by the Emperor, That he intended that all
such goods should be restored to the Roman Catholic Churches, which had
formerly been by the Protestants usurped; a business wherein this Prince was
not a little concerned, whose Incomes were more compounded of Ecclesiastical
Revenues, then other rents; he would doubtless make use of this occasion,
which palliated with a strong pretense, might make him declare himself
partial for the King, who was able with no less an Army then Count Tilly to
assist and defend him.

The Roman Catholic Army being now reinforced by the arrival of Fistenburg,
and by the coming of Tiffenbacke Marshall of the field, who was called back
out of Lusatia, with such forces as he could get out of the Garrisons of that
Province, and out of Sletia; as also by the advertisements that Count Aldrenger
was come from Mantua, and returning into Germany, was within forty leagues,
with about 8000. Soldiers; Tilly thought that he should meet with no
opposition which could contest with him, nor keep him from those advancings
which his men had at other times made against greater Armies. Raising his Camp
from about Magdeburg, he came to Hall, a City upon the River Sall, (which
coming from forth those Mountains, which toward the South upon the confines
of Voitland, run between Franconia and Bohemia, and gathering many other Rivers
into it, falls into the Elb, not far from Rosenberg;) where he haulted, and
mustering his Army, which he found to be above 34000. fighting men, he thought
himself fit for any enterprise; He therefore called a Council of war, wherein
it was the general opinion of all his Commanders, that Saxony should be
demanded openly to declare himself; for this term of Newtrality brings always
with it jealousies to Princes, and so much the more at this time, for that the
Elector for his own defense had gathered together a body of about 14000.
Soldiers, which would be a great addition to that side he should adhere unto;
and in respect that Tilly had now environed his whole Country with his forces,
he thought the very fear of the Roman Catholic Army, would make him put on a
favorable resolution, whereby he might easily be brought afterward to employ
his forces in suppressing of the King. He therefore sent the Baron Shamburg,
(an Almain by birth; one who very well understood Martial affairs, as also
civil Negotiation, and who was of a Noble family,) to the Elector, demanding
of him that he would join his forces with theirs to suppress the Swedes, that
he would give quarter for his Army upon his Territories, and contribution in
money, whereof the Soldiers having been a long time kept short, they began to
grumble, and to mutiny, against their Commanders: He willed Shamburg (since now
the sword was in their hand,) that he should speak the more boldly, and with
the less respect. Shamburgs expressions were lofty, and rather imperious then
civil: He told him, that since he the Elector was a Subject to the Emperor
Ferdinand, he did proclaim Caesar's indignation against him, if he did any ways
forgo the friendship and duty which he owed to Caesar.

The Elector was much troubled at this Embassy, and being much amazed, he
called together his Council of State, before he would give his answer; where
the Austrian proceedings being narrowly examined; and the Elector being found
to suffer much in his reputation, by such like pretenses, he being a free
Prince, and Lord over his own; and finding that this was a very fit occasion
to draw from him a manifestation of those injuries which he pretended to have
received, and an opportune time to free himself of those jealousies, which the
greatness of the House of Austria had caused in him; he using but few words,
told Shamburg, that he had always been a good Servant to his imperial
Majesty, and had always showed his affection to his dignity; and that he did
not know any occasion he had given Caesar to complain; that he would always
continue the same; but that to declare himself in this present immergency, now
that a puissant and numerous Army was incampt so near his State, would be a
means to draw the war upon himself which he ought not to do; that therefore
he would still keep himself a Newter, and that he would not be faulty to his
Caesarian Majesty in any duty which he acknowledged to owe him.

Shamburg returned to Tilly, who exceedingly longed to hear what answer he
would bring back; and when he had heard it, was no ways pleased with it; but
thought he had the means in his own hands, to bring the Elector to do what
he desired by force, if his proffers, words and protestations would not
prevail: He therefore resolved to rise from Hall, and to set upon such towns
of the Dukes, as were in the circuit of the Sall; having to this purpose sent
all his Horse into the Saxon Territories, He with his foot encamped himself
before Naumberg, a place watered by the Sall, not far from Lipsick; he raised
two Batteries against it, and the place being but meanly manned and fortified,
he in two days took it; from thence pursuing his victory, he possessed himself
of Weisnfeld, Neremburg, and all the neighboring Castles; and being come near
the gates of Leypzicke, he in friendly manner demanded refreshment, and
contribution monyes of the Citizens, and that they would suffer his Soldiers
to quarter within their walls.

This news being come to the Elector, did much puzzell him and his Council; he
knew no other remedy, but either to give way to the Imperialists forces, since
his own Army was not sufficient to defend so large a Territory, and which
wanted necessary strong holds; or else to put himself into the Swedes
protection; much discourse being had hereupon, it was thought at last, that it
would be better for the Electour, and more for his reputation, to defend
himself against his Enemies, then basely, (as if he were overcome) to yield
unto their desires: yet some that were present at the Consultation, wisely
ballancing the affairs, were of opinion that he should rather yield to Tillyes
desires, then draw upon him Caesar's ill will; alleging the little good the
Palatine, Denmark, and others had of late got by doing the contrary: That the
King of Sweden was a stranger Prince, who had but few helps, less a great
deal then those who had formerly undertaken the same; that he wanted the
Sinnews of money, and that he chiefly relied upon hopes from others; that one
only blow would make him make have back to Sweden, and leave those unwary
ones to the pleasure of Caesar's Sword, who had unluckily been by him
persuaded, and had followed his fortune: That Ferdinands Forces were big with
reputation, and by their so many Victories and Conquests, had established unto
themselves a large foundation; that the tree could not be plucked up, which
being fast rooted by many adherents, and so great Subsistency, greater forces
then its own, not lesser were requisite to move it: That wise Princes ought
always to reflect upon the events, which were not to suffer any youthful
examination: That war was always to be shund, when the entertaining of it
could not be but prejudicial; that by the sole forces of the Electorat
sufficient resistance could not be made, that therefore they must demand help
from the Swedes, to whom they must grant that which they now deny unto the
Emperor; that it had been wont to be held dangerous to call in Auxiliary
forces, since what is by them defended from the injuries of others, is by them
pretended unto, as if they had won it; and therefore it is seldom seen, that
they forsake such places as are given to them for Caution. Others said, that
the Emperor was got to too great a height; that such greatness ought not to
be tolerated, much less fomented by wise Princes: That the Austrians were
known to be declared Enemies to their Sect, and consequently to that Dukedom,
whereunto under a pious pretense of introducing the Romish faith, they would
bring their armies, and therewithal use such Charity as they had done
elsewhere: That the greater the Roman Catholics grew, the Protestants went so
much the less; that the coming of the King of Sweden was acknowledged to be
miraculous, and to be a divine punishment to those, who in their victories
abusing fortunes-favour, clothed themselves with too much ambition; that
nothing else was to be believed; for fortune cannot choose but smile on the bold
adventures of a warlike King; that such Commanders were great helps to their
Armies, that past examples had showed them, how prejudicial a thing it is, to
let go the occasion of keeping those low whom we fear, as was proved in the
insurrection of Bohemia: for if the Palatine keeping himself in his regal
throne, had given bounds to the Austrian power, the name of Elector would have
been more reverenced; that it has been held a maxim, that we should not be
unmindefull to assist the weaker, to the end that the balance being kept even,
the greater weight may not fall upon ones own weakness; that the intentions
of the Austrians were not now unknown; that now was the time to moderate their
designs, and to shake off that yoke, which if they should resume, they would
not so easily find a hand to ease them of it.

Harnem the Dukes General was therefore dispatched away to the King, who
keeping fast in his station, did longingly expect what would be the end of
Tillyes design upon the State of Saxony. Harnem was received by the King with
great demonstrations of love, as he always used to receive those that came
unto him; for he much coveted to captivate men's good wills, by kindness and
affability, being wont to say that the love of Soldiers, and other men was
thereby more won, then by severe gravity. Harnem having made known unto him
what the Austrians proceedings had been against the Duke his Master, and what
their vast designs were, entreated him in his Masters name, that his Majesty
would send him assistance, and come to the succor of Leypzik, the loss
whereof would not only prove prejudicial to his dominion, but to the whole
interest of the Protestants: but the King willing to let the Electour see, how
ill he had been advised, whilst being able to relieve Magdeburg, by the
preservation whereof his estate would have likewise been secure; and whilst he
was entreated by him the King, to afford him passage, and to join with him, he
had denied to do so, and had sent back the messenger, with resolutions no
ways profitable, did coolly answer Harnem: That his Master had himself drawn
the war upon him, by having slighted his Counsel, or rather for having
refused, what was by him propounded: That his highness had some Counselors
about him that were Spaniolised; that he needed not point out unto him, whither
the Austrian Monarchy tended, for it was apparently seen by former examples,
that having suppressed the liberty of the Hauns towns, and the Princes of the
Empire, he aimed merely at the Command over all Europe; that he knew not how to
help him, for that his design was to lead his forces elsewhere; and that he
was very much troubled at this accident which had befallen the Duke. Harnem
answered with words drawn from the inmost of his heart, and which were
accompanied with some tears that fell from his eyes; that his Majesty as a
wise and courteous Prince, as a gracious propagator of the faith, and as the
defender of German liberty, ought to forget any thing the Elector had done
amiss, which had been occasioned through fear, and bad Counsel; not out of
any diffidence he had of his Majesty's friendship, to the which he should
forever acknowledge himself obliged: That Princes are often times blinded by
their interest of state, and often times so hoodwinckt, as that they could not
refuse the counsels of their Ministers; that the welfare of the public ought
to be preferred before what ever private respect; that a Prince ought to forget
such things wherein they have not received satisfaction, when the doing so
redounds to their advantage; that reason of state is always furnished with so
choice a disguise, as in an instant it can turn the most threatening brows of
an enemy, into the pleasing countenance of a friend, and as soon change the
clear aspect of a favorite into a troubled face.

The King who did indeed desire nothing more then this, though he seemed to
feign the contrary, not objecting any thing to these his expressions,
answered, That he would be contented to come aid the Elector, upon condition,
that for his better caution and security, he might have the Fort of Wittenberg
delivered up into his hands, which is a very strong hold, seated upon the Elb
in a most pleasant Country, begirt with Parrapits and bastions of the latest
edition, well peopled, and a place of great Importance, standing between
Lusatia and the Bishopric of Hall, as if it were the Center of those two
Provinces: the key which opens and shuts the way into Saxony. That he might
receive money for two payments of his Army; and that his excellencies eldest
son might be sent to him, and kept by him as an hostage of his fidelity.
Harnem by speedy post acquainted his Master with these answers, whose state was
now in great confusion and fear, and who returned as speedy answer to the
King; That not only Wittenberg, but his whole state was at his Command; that
the money for the Army should forthwith be disbursed; and that he himself
together with his son, would hasten to come and serve him. These Articles
being signed by the King and by Harnem, in behalf of the Elector; they agreed
upon a time of meeting likewise with the Elector of Brandenburg, and other
confederate Princes. The Duke having brought his men to Torgaw between
Wittenberg and Dresda upon the Elb, and mustering them there he found them to
be 16000. fighting men, (allowing thereunto some of the Country Troops) with 28
pieces of Cannon, and a very well furnished baggadge, he marched toward
Wittenberg, where the King appointed to meet him by the first of September.

Tilly this mean time had invested the walls of Leypzik on diverse sides,
striking fear into the Citizens thereof, who were men not verst in war, but
for the most part brought up in merchandising; insomuch as they saw they could
not resist the strong batteries which beat down their towers on all sides, and
did presage unto them the unlucky example of Magdeburg. They therefore sent
forth deputies to speak with Tilly, who concluded that the City should be
surrendered, on Condition that they might enjoy their liberty of Conscience,
that the Saxon Garrison should march out with their weapons and baggadge; and
that the City should be burdened with nothing else but the payment of 200000
Dollers, in prosecution whereof on the sixth of September. September. 6.
Tilly made his entrance into the Town, with the great applause of the Roman
Catholic Army. Leypzik is seated in a large Champion between the Elb and the
Sall, watered by the River Elster, and the River Pleis, which falling into
Elster under the very walls of the Town loses its name. This place being
seated betwixt the utmost parts of upper Saxony, and Misnia, and almost in the
very heart of Germany is a place of much Traffic, as well in respect of the
great concourse of people as of the rich merchandise, by reason of the many
Faires that are there kept; but her fortifications are imperfect, and after the
ancient manner.

This mean while the Kings Army and the Electors being joined, and the King
seeing himself now grown to sufficient strength to give him battle in the
field, upon which the Total of this contention did consist, he raised his
Tents from about Wittenberg on the fourth of September, September. 4.
past over the Elb, and with speedy march took his way toward Leypzik, that
he might relieve the City; but hearing by the way, that the Letters written by
the Elector to the chief Magistrate of the Town, wherein he acquainted him of
his being joined with the King, and of the speedy relief they were bringing,
exhorting him in the mean while stoutly to defend the Town, were intercepted
by the Imperialists, and that now the City was in the power of the Romanists,
he stayed in the Fields about Bitterfelt and Dieben, Towns between the Elb and
the River Tena; as well to expect fresh Troops of Soldiers, as to inform
himself better of the Enemies condition, that he might betake himself to the
best resolution.

Tilly on the other side, advertised of the Swedes being joined with Saxony,
was much incensed against the Elector, and desirous to revenge himself for the
injury received, encouraged by the confidence he had in his Soldiers valor,
who were acquainted with nothing but victory, though he might better have
effected his designs by waiting for Aldringer, who was not far off, yet not
able to appease himself, he marched out of Leypzik, drew his Army into the
Fields, put it into Battell-array, placed his Artillery in the most
advantageous places, fortified passages, and made the King see he would nor
refuse to fight with him, no nor with Saxony, though both joined together.

The King likewise seeing himself in the head of an Army ready to fight, and
that at last a Battle must be had, he losing no time, least Tilly might be by
Aldringer reinforced, courageously advanced toward the Enemy; he mustered
both his own men, and those of the Elector, Septem. 15.
on the fifteenth of September, in the Fields about Dieben, and found them to
amount to about 40000 Soldiers; and having given unto them two pays, he with
Princely words, and courteous expressions, full of honor, encouraged all his
men, and took from them that fear which they might have received by reason of
the Imperialists fortune, who had still bin victors in so many Battles: And
moreover, making it publicly known that he intended nothing to himself of
what should be gotten, but to part it all amongst his fellow soldiers: he
heartened his men with sure hope of good success, and with a grave and slow
march, took his way toward the Austrian Quarters.

The Vantgard toward the East, between the Villages of Dieben and Lindaw,
consisted of 14000 Saxon Soldiers, rancked into eight Squadrons, four of
Foot, and four of Horse, and was commanded by the Duke himself, who in his
own person lead them on, accompanied by above a hundred of the prime Gentlemen
of his State, all Volontiers: He had upon him a breastplate lined with gold, a
black Scarf all imbroidered with silver, and was upon a Sorrel Horse all
dapled. Behind the Elector on the left wing, Lieutenant General Harnem
marched, who leading on 2000 Horse well mounted, their Riders all armed in
black burnisht Arms, under the Command of the 2 Colonels, Brintauff and
Corville, and himself mounted on an yron-gray Steed, appeared in a threatening
posture to the lookers on; the Foot flankt in the midst between the Elector and
Harnem, were lead on by the Colonels, Offchirchem, Damniger, Marshall,
Helmendort, and Spinghell; over whom as General of the Foot, was the Duke of
Iltemberg, the Electors Cousin clad in perfumed Turkish leather, with a great
black feather in his head; amidst those Foot were 16 pieces of great Cannon
drawn by good Horses, and 26 Sachers; and after them followed all the
Carriages of the Saxon and Swedish Army, which were so disposed of by the Kings
directions: On the right side toward the Village Delicts did the Swedish
Squadrons march, on the right hand whereof stood the King in a mingled colored
Cloth suite, with a Jupe of perfumed leather, with a gray Hat on his head, and
a little green Feather mounted on a Dun Horse; behind him followed 2000 Dutch
Horse, and 2000 Finlanders armed with Curases, Pistols, and broad Swords:
Amidst these Squadrons which divided into four Bodies, left between them a
vacuitie of about a hundred Foot broad, were two hundred choice Musketeers
placed ready to salute the Enemies Horse, before they came to Pistoll-shot, the
Battaglions of Foot which were in the Vanguard, were led on by Banniers
Marshall of the Field, a Swede by birth, before the which he marched in a suit
of Turkish leather, with arming points of gold, and a skie-coloured Scarf upon
a Flea-bitten pacing Horse, with a Truncheon tipped with iron in his hand.
These Regiments were divided into six Battaglions, each of them consisting of
1500 Foot, betwixt each of which in the Front five pieces of Cannon was drawn,
very light and of a modern invention, loaded with bags of Musket-bullets:
These Companies were under 72 Ensigns of various and lovely Colors, upon the
which was set the Kings Arms, and upon that a great Crown, the Motto was,
Gustavus Adolphus Rex Fidei Evangelica defensor, the greatest part of the
soldiers were clad in blew and yellow Jackets; upon the left wing did Marshall
Gustavus Horn march, who had the Command of four thousand Horse armed with
Curasses, divided into four Squadrons, under fifty two Standards, part blew,
part Orange color, wherein was read a Motto under an arm, which in its hand
held a Sword; Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos? and under a Scepter over
which a Sword lay cross, was another inscription, which said, Ensem Gradivus
Sceptrum* Them is ipsa gubernat; he was a Swede by Nation; and a man of great
esteem, he was armed with a Curasse upon a daplegray Horse, and clad in
Turkish leather. The rest of the Foot followed, divided into six Battaglions,
lead in the Battle by the Colonels Wiston, Ruthen, and Heburne, the chief
Commanders of the Army, who marched before upon little naggs; and within these
Battaglions were placed thirty pieces of Field Cannon, at equal distances;
betwixt the one and the other Squadrons were 87 Ensigns of diverse Colors,
and with diverse Mottoes; amongst these, underneath a Sun overshadowed with the
Clouds, was read this inscription, Sero sed serio.

In this order, which bore with it a formidable appearance, the Swedish and
Saxon Army advanced on the sixteenth day of September too within two leagues of
Lipsick. Septem. 16.
Tilly upon the hearing thereof had sent forth certain Squadrons of Horse to
spy out, and inform themselves of the Enemies proceedings, between which and
the Horse of the other side there happened a very hot skirmish: and had not the
Sun which was then upon the setting parted the fray, which was maintained
valiantly by the one and the other parties, doubtless both Armies would then
have joined battle, as they did the next day. The King who all the night long
kept himself in the Field, going now hither, now thither, instructing every
one what order they ought to keep, encouraging his soldiers with this pleasing
speech and cheerful voice, and calling unto him all the Commanders of the
Army, he with a merry look said unto them; That now the occasion was presented
which he had so long desired, that he might make a trial of his Soldiers
valor; he told them that past victories and renown already gotten, did vanish
into smoke, when daring was suffocated with fear; that they ought not to
value that Enemy, who being so often beaten within his strongest holds, does now
appear in the fields less strong, dismaide, and quaking at the rusling of
their own Arms; that fear was the Harbinger of death, for which cowardice did
often provide Quarter; that courage was the son of Fortune, the Father of
renown, and the beautiful dispencer of greatness, honor, and riches; he
acquainted every of them how he would be served by them in this action; he
showed the whole Army of what great consequence the winning of this Battle
would be, what advantage would thereby accrue to the public, and to each
private man, since great booty was therein to be had, much acquisition,
extraordinary honor, the increase of the common safety; he with words of
efficacy moderated the estimation which such as were fearful might have of the
valor and renown of the Enemy, letting them know that Tillies Forces were not
great, that his soldiers were discontented, and that many things were wanting
in his Army, which were requisite to a complete Battle; that they ought not to
way the Austrians past fortune, for that she changes daily, and when she
seem fullest of hair, becomes soon bald; that by how much more eminent the
fame and valor of the Enemy was, so much more glory was to be won by beating
them: that he had forgon the safe and pleasing quiet of a Court, and entered
into the troubles of war to no other end, but to raise again that liberty,
which suppressed by the Imperialists under the specious pretense of Religion,
kept those people under the yoke of Tyranny, who in all respects were worthy
to be eased thereof: that the valor of that nation was now in question, which
not imbaced by the harmfull idleness of peace, had in her vigor enough to tame
the fiercest nations of Europe: that finally he built his safety upon the
honorable behavior of his men, and the experience of his Commanders, from
whose swords, honor and reward was to be expected: that he would lead them
the way they were to follow; that no evil was less to be born withal, then
what was occasioned by ones own default. September. 17. By break of day he made
his horse advance in sight of his Enemies squadrons; Septem. 17.
and the Army being encouraged by the sound of warre-like Instruments, diverse
skirmishes were begun.

On the other side Tilly wholly composed of confidence and boldness in respect
of his Soldiers, whose valor he had tried in so many Battles, did
infinitely desire to try himself with this King; for as his name and fame was
great, so greater would be the glory which the victory over him in battle
would bring with it. Having summoned his chief Commanders together, he
acquainted them with his purpose; That now the time was come to reap the fruit
of so many worthy actions, and give a glorious end to their past victories;
that they might afterward in perfect quiet, enjoy the renown, glory and
riches which they had won* he showed them that the Kings forces were new men,
and much terrified at the fame of that valor which they in so many victories
had won: that they ought to thank God, and receive these occasions, as gifts
from Heaven, that so they might conquer the persecutors of the holy Church, and
by worldly conquests gain Heaven. That the Swedes were not stronger then
those, who being so often made a sacrifice to their swords, had made men know,
of what force the justice of the cause, and the valor of Ferdinand the seconds
Soldiers were; that the bodies of base and cowardly men, were followed with
fearful shadows, not the minds of such as were courageous: That the
apprehension of dangers and fear of shot, was banished by experience: That
doubt belonged to the unexperienced, assurance to such as were capable of it:
that the Swedes happy successes were to be termed, the treasons of subjects,
the fomentions of Rebels, not the valor of Soldiers, worth of Commanders, and
force of arms. Here some being of opinion that such undertakings as are
pursued with certainty, are most praiseworthy: and these knowing that to fight
without the addition of Aldringers men, would not be so safe, (who were all old
Soldiers, and who within six days might join themselves with their Army; and
by which assistance the King might be fought withal upon better advantage, and
with almost assured victory,) they advertised Tilly thereof. But he growing
still more courageous, and governed by his own confidence, would not listen to
their persuasions, being of opinion it was not glorious to win upon such
advantage. He said that the reputation of their arms, was too far advanced;
that delay was a manifest show of fear, and an increase of courage in the
Enemy: That there was nothing more prejudicial in the art of warre-fare, then
the appearing to fear the Enemy: That great enterprises became great
Commanders, and that the more difficult they were, the more glorious were they:
That to expect Aldringers coming, would be but loss of time; for that if by
such delay their Army should receive any increase, the same would befall the
Kings Army, toward whom many Troops were already on their march from
Brandenburg Saxony, Mechelburg, and the other adjacent Provinces; in all which
places the Drums did continually beat, and Soldiers were taken into pay.
Drawing therefore his Army forth into the fields of Leypzik under the village
Tanger: he formed his Army which consisted of 34000. Soldiers in this manner.

On the right flancke, just over against the said village were placed five
Regiments of Crabats, commanded by Colonel Isolan, a brave subject and much
experienced in war; they were all well horst, and armed with Harguhibuses,
Pistols and Simiters: after these followed six great squadrons of Horse under
70. Standerds of several Colors, with several impresses; amongst the which,
one was a great Imperial Eagle, which held in her right Tallents a
Pontificiall Crown, and in her left, the Imperial Scepter; the word was, Pro
Ecclesia, et pro Imperio; these belonged to the Regiments of the Colonels
Schamburg, Cronenburg, Braungarten, Baldiron, Valmirode, Detrusteim, Ghetts,
Blancort and the Duke of Holesteime, all of them subjects of great blood, and
great experienced Commanders; they were all mounted on stately Horses, armed
with strong Curases, and richly adorned in their apparel: the Vanguard of
Foot consisting of 8000. old Soldiers followed next which was divided into
four great bataglions, under 48. Ensigns of diverse Colors, and with
several inscriptions.

Over these Shamburg Commanded in chief, who was Sergeant Major General of
the Army, a gentleman much verst in war; in their front stood 20. field
pieces, and upon the flanckes of those 16. great pieces so ordered as that they
might from a far off flank upon the Swedish squadrons. Upon the left flank,
and upon the back of the Vanguard of Foot 5000. Horse marched all well mounted
and armed, which were the Regiments of Coronino, Rangoni and Gonsago, Noblemen
of Italy; and of Spor, Diffart, and Arracourt, Germans of good account; and
over these Count Popenheime commanded in chief, upon a brown-bay horse, and
accompanied with about 20. Volunteers, all of them gentlemen of stranger
nations.

After these followed the maine battle, consisting of 10000. foot which were
disposed into six battaglions, and were the several Brigadoes of the Duke of
Sas, of Count Bortholed, Walestein, Duke S^^velly, Merrodes, Popenheime,
Fistemburg and Strozzi; over which Fistemburg commanded in chief; they all
marched in the head of their Squadrons upon little nags, and afterward
lighting, they took each one their Pikes in hand.

The Battle was upheld on the right flank by 2000 horse belonging to the
Regiments of Tersica, Breda, Prior, Aldobrandim, Rochimberg, Mancini,
Bonbaglion, Fiston and others: the Sieur D' Harcourt commanded the right wing,
and the Sieur de Cornemberg the left; both of them Sergeant Majors General of
the Army: behind these followed the Rear-guard placed upon the rise of a hill,
and was composed of 6000. Foot, belonging to the Regiments of Gratz, Contras,
Holia, Off^nts, Montecucoli, and Differt, which were all lead on by the Sieur
D'Offcutz upon a dapple-gray horse; behind these Foot, and behind the
baggadge which came in the Rear, marched the Regiments of the Colonels,
Montecka, Michna, and others, which were commanded by the Counts of Mansfield
and Fucari, great men in Germany. Tilly as the soul of the body, kept himself
in the midst of the Army, accompanied by many Gentlemen of quality, styled
Volunteers; he rod on a chestnut horse, had on him a gray suit, and was armed
back and breast.

The Imperialists Army being thus ordered, and placed in a very advantageous
place, upon which all the great pieces of Ordnance were raised, they stood
waiting to see what the King would do; but he having advanced the Saxon horse
against the Crabats and the Curaseers, which guarded the left flank of the
Emperors Army; and the Crabats charging fiercely upon the Swedes, being backed
by the body of the armed horse, the fight was very hot about three hours after
Sunne-rising: where after the discharging of their Pistols, and their
incountring with their swords, the Saxon horse gave back, being charged in the
front, and on the flank by the Imperialists Vanguard of horse, lead on by
Shamburg and Cronemberg, who with their Swords in hand pressed hard upon them;
who falling foul upon the Electors squadrons in this confusion and hurley
burley, opened the way to the Caesarian horse, to do no small execution on them.

The King seeing what prejudice the Saxons received, commanded Bannier to
advance with his horse of the right wing, against the left wing of Tillyes
Army, which being lead on by Count Fistemberg did in close order, courageously
set forward to meet the Enemy: He likewise set forwards two great squadrons of
Swedish Horse, seconded by a squadron of Foot, and lead on by Hebron, against
the Crabats, who boldly advanced to discharge their Carabines, opening the
horse files: and there being faced by Musketeers, they to their great loss
received a sore salute of Musket Shot, and some field pieces charged with bags
of Musket-bullets, did so power down shot amongst them, as many of them being
put out of their ranks, and many unhorst, they caused much mischief to their
squadrons.

Yet notwithstanding, not abating their courage, they amidst the blood, which
in all places flowed apace; and the smoke and fire which lightened round about
them, gave on undauntedly, and with much violence upon the Saxon horse, who
being drilled through by the uncessant shot of certain Culverings, and
likewise charged by some squadrons lead on by Tilly's self; who being followed
by some of the bands of the most ancient, stoutest, and best experienced
Soldiers; as likewise by many Volunteers charged through them, they were
routed and began to be scattered on all sides, leaving the field to the
Conqueror.

The King seeing this confusion and the eminency of danger, the Elector not
being able to stay his men from running away, neither by threats, nor yet by
entreaties, he advanced some Squadrons of the Findlanders Horse, which were
kept for a reserve, and he himself with his sword in hand hasted to the place
where the Imperialists Artillery was placed, which he found guarded but by a
few men, the greatest part of them being run to the Pillage of the Saxons who
were run away, and made himself master of it: and straightway turning the
Cannon upon the Enemy, made them play upon the flank of the Caesarians, who
prosecuting their victory, laid load upon the Foot Regiments of Colonel
Steinack, Halli, and Hebrun, who being sent by the King to encourage the Saxons
did there desperately defend themselves with their Pikes and Muskets. He then
caused some Horse to advance against certain battaglions of Foot, who came
from the Imperialists Reare-guard unbackt by Horse, which caused such fear in
them, as setting upon them in diverse parts with Curasiers mixed with some few
Muskets, though the enemy made good their ground for about an hours space, the
old Soldiers not ceasing with incredible undauntednesse to fight, though lamed
and wounded, they were at last routed, their Pikes cut in pieces on all sides,
their Foot trod underfoot, and their Ranks broken; then seeing what impression
his men made amongst the enemy, he commanded Gustavus Horn with part of his
Horse and some Foot to make good the Artillery which he had won; and that he
should withstand Popenheime, who with the Imperialists Horse of the Battle,
and four battaglions of Foot came hastily on to succor his side.

Then observing how the Imperialists crying, Victory, Victory, were run to the
Baggage, and were intent thereupon as if the Battle had been ended; he
courageously placed himself in the head of 4000. choice Horse, followed by
4000. good Musketeers and 800. Dragoons; and crying out follow me and fear
not, he with his sword in his hand charged the Imperialists, giving in upon
them with so much violence, mingling his men amongst theirs, and killing many
of them with his own hand, as (though they endeavored to rally themselves
together, and make head against him) yet their Soldiers being scattered, some
here, some there, and some of them busy in pillaging the Carriages, they could
not resist the Swedes invading them; who charging afresh with more fury and
force, had in the space of an hour slain the greatest part of them.

Tilly was mad to see this unwonted confusion of his men; he solicitously
endeavored to get his men in order again, and to reassume the fight; to him
Popenheime hasted with Squadron of reserve, though sorely wounded in two
places, the blood gush't from him apace; but being pursued by Bannier, and
Horn, with whom till then he had been a fighting, and by this time the gross
of both Armies being gotten likewise thither, the scuffle began again, the
Cannon thundered from every side, some loaded with great bullets, some with bags
of small ones, there was nothing seen but smoke, fire, and blood; some of the
most courageous without mercy trod under the horses feet, and members (torn
from the body by the Cannon) flying in the air. Then was the Battle renewed
on all sides, on Flank, Front, and Rear; amidst this horror the King with
some able and resolute squadrons charged in, and with his sword made way
through the thickest of the Caesarian squadrons. Here the Findlanders Horse
showed such assurednes and resolution, as cheerfully encouraging each other
with their voices, they charged Tillyes squadrons through and through, so as
the Imperialists no longer able to defend themselves against these men, who had
banished all fear of death, who were inheartened with the opinion of winning
the day, and had likewise got the advantage of the wind, which with a brisk
gale blew the smoke and powder into the enemies eyes, they in disorderly
retreat fell foul upon the squadrons of their own Foot, which being by them
opened and broken, began to run.

Tilly observing this confusion and the eminency of danger, got upon a fresh
horse, and resolving rather to dye then to be the spectator of so many men's
miseries, and of this blemish to all those victories which had immortalized
him, used all the means he could to stay his men, and with his own hand slew
many of them that ran away; the like did Popenheime, who so courageously
behaved himself, as through his heat of blood not sensible of the weakness
his wounds had caused in him, he with his sword forced back the fugitives, and
did for some little time keep the remainder of their Troops together: but the
fear of the enemy prevailing more with them then the threats and blows of
their own Commanders, it was impossible to rally them again. Wherefore Tilly
being wounded in the arm with a Pistollshot, and having his head cut with a
sword of one of the enemies, with whom (aged as he was) he more then once had
with his sword in hand incountred; and knowing that there was no more resisting
of the Swedes fury, who slew all they met with, he with those few who yet he
found about him took his way toward Fulda, and recovered the territories of
that Prince.

Popenheime having seven wounds upon him, was stripped by the Swedes, and left
for dead in the field amongst the dead bodies; from whence by the help of a
countryman, he was the next morning carried to Hall, and from thence to Fulda,
to be cured: In this days battle about 10000. Imperialists were slain,
wounded and taken prisoners, many of which were slain by the country people,
who in their flight slew as many of them with their clubs as they met withal:
Those of the better sort that perished here of the Emperors side, were the Duke
of Holestanie, the Colonels, Bangert and Blancart, the Baron Schamburg, with
many Captains and other Officers: The King found 1000. of his men missing, and
the Electour of Saxony 4000. of his.

The Battle being ended, the King commanded a retreat to be founded, to
recall such Troops as disorderly followed the flying enemy; and all of them
being returned to their Colors, he being accompanied by the Elector and other
Princes, and the heads of his Army, did in a stately manner, and mounted on a
pasing horse, visit all his squadrons, and thanked them all for their valiant
behavior; they all cried out, long live the King, and nothing was heard but
vollies of Muskets, and the going off of Cannons. Having afterward taken
requisite order for the solemnization of this victory, and giving his Soldiers
leave to retire into their quarters and refresh themselves, for what they had
that day suffered, he went to his own lodging, where after having a good
while discoursed with the Duke of Saxony, of what advantage would by this
victory redound to all the Protestant Princes, he sat down at Table, where
certainly his meat was very pleasing unto him: his discourse, being only that
he thought no greater contentment could be, then for a General to see himself
victorious over an enemies army.

The news of this victory being speedily brought to the Emperors Court did much
astonish the Austrians; and as great was their confusion, as was the
consequence of their loss, especially since it came so unexpectedly upon them,
who relying too much upon their former victories and present power, thought
they had led fortune in a string; but within a few days after they were much
more cast down: and waving upon a sea of thoughts, their hopes were ready to
suffer shipwreck; for it was wispered in the Court and other places, that
besides the prejudice received by this days loss; 'twas added that the Duke
of Bavaria much considering the Swedes victories, and listening to the
protestations made unto him by the King, it was not without reason feared that
there had been some overtu^es of agreement between these, by the mediation of
the King of France, who said that to that purpose he had obtained from the
Swedes a cessation of Arms for some days, and that this intelligence between
Bavaria and the Swedes was held, notwithstanding that Tilly by men drawn out
of Garrisons, by Focaries men raised in Bavaria and ^wabenland, and by
Aldringers forces returned from Italy had gotten new strength, whereby the
Romanists first fears were a little lessned. This caused much jealousy amongst
the Imperialists, and much suspicion and diffidence grew hereupon amongst them;
occasioned through the nicety of the interest of Princes, to whom shadows seem
substances. Aldringer believing (though injuriously) that the Electour (as
Princes use to do) should side with the party, whereby his territories might
be more secured; resolved not to join with Bavaria, feigning to return to
winter himself, and to place himself in the defense of Moravia and Bohemia;
but before he did this, he with specious words exhorted his Commanders and
Soldiers not to forgo their loyalty; thus the Army being little less then in
confusion, the Caesarian Soldiers retiring where their Leaders were most
concerned, and all things out of order, many consultations were held in the
Emperors Court, wherein each Counselor advising, as they were most concerned in
their affections and self interest, their resolutions grew more and more
confused*

Where there are many Counselors, many are the counsels that are given; and
the diversity of nations makes men differ in their interest. The Spaniards
advised that Ferdinando King of Hungary the Emperors son should march into
the field, whose authority they said would draw many of the Nobility out of
their nests of idleness, and make many private men apply themselves to raise
new forces, of which there was then great need; besides it would be a means to
win the young King to better esteem with his father, and to ingratiate
himself with him: they further said that the Majesty and presence of a Prince
was of much availment in an Army, that Counsels were more readily had, and the
results thereof were the more opportune, when the authority is supreme in the
Commander; and that that was a business of great importance in the Military
art, that the remainder of those Forces on which the public hope and safety
did depend, ought not to be trusted to the Command of a private man, who either
drawn over by the enemy, stirred up by the unquietness of ambition, moved by
his own particular interest, or counseled by his passions, might be able to
give the Law to his Lord and master. But the Dutch suspected that this might be
but cunning carried by ambition, which covets command: for they imagined the
Spaniards named the King to this employment, not so much for the public good,
as for their own particular intents: for if the King should have gone into the
field, they would have had a stroke in his Counsels, being already admitted
into the Court under pretense of serving the Queen, sister to King Philip, and
so by little and little, getting sooting in places of command, they might
become arbitrators of the Interests, and of the governing the Imperial Crown;
they therefore differd from the others in opinion, alleging that great
provisions were to be made for a Kings setting out, as well for what belonged to
the decency of his person, as to the maintenance of a King-like Army: That the
treasury was well exhausted by past expenses; that the ancient reputation in
Arms of an Austrian King ought not to be matched with a new, fierce, and
fortunate enemy: That the peoples hopes would be much thrown down by any the
least prejudice that might incur unto him; and although these considerations
were qualified by the Spaniard, who offered great sums of money, these
notwithstanding with all the Art their own interests could infuse into them
(which was to be commanded by one of their own nation) propounded Albertus
Walesteine Duke of Fridland in whom there was great reason to hope well; they
made it appear, that to obviate the eminent danger at the present, no man was
fitter to take upon him the command of the Army, then he who had formerly to
their advantage exercised the same place, and that this their proposition was
grounded upon the surer foundation, for that he had heaped up so much riches,
by his past victories, as no man was fitter then he to assist in the new levyes
of men, and in providing all things requisite for the Army.

Necessity, which out-weighs reason, drew the Spaniards to yield unto the
Dutchmen, who overcome by what had been said, and not having yet got good
footing in Germany, they came over to their opinion, the execution whereof was
presently resolved upon. But Walestein who was then at Zenam in Moravia, ten
leagues from Vienna, and was gone thither by reason of the Saxons Armies
arrival in Bohemia, was not minded to come unto the Court, for that he
expected to be received and treated as a sovereign Prince, which he arrogated
to himself by virtue of his title of Duke of Michelberg, for which the term
of highness was given him. The Count of Verdemberg was first sent to acquaint
him with this Election, and afterward the Baron of Questemberg, and the Prince
of Echenberg though he were sick of the gout, three of the Emperors prime
Counselors, and Walesteines great friends, who dexterously overcomming an
appearance of denial made by him, in respect of the great grief of soul he
suffered for being formerly turned out of the same charge, they by their
flatteries, (the true sauce to the bitterness of passion) did so sweeten his
distaste, that at last he yielded. He resolved notwithstanding as then, not to
receive such employment for longer then four months, though these his friends
used their best eloquence to persuade him to accept of this command absolutely,
without any such restriction.

The opinions of men concerning this, were various; some thought he did it that
he might not hazard his honor and reputation, in times of so great calamity,
and for that he had to do with a victorious and fortunate King; others,
because he would not oblige himself to overcome difficulties, which leaned upon
impossibilites; others thought this was but cunning, for that he being
exceeding vainglorious desired, the rather to accept of this command upon
condition, that so he might not only oblige the Emperor, but also the King of
Spain; by both whose Majesty's he desired to be entreated, to accept of that
which he underhand did mainly endeavor to have conferred upon him, not
foreseeing the slipperinesse and danger of the path his ambition lead him unto;
drunk with an over-weaning estimation of himself, neither remembering that
Princes will have their servants to be obedient and not masters.

Having accepted the command of this Army, he sent for all the Colonels,
as well those who kept their places, as those who had been casheered; and for
that affability is a great advantage to reputation, he received them all with
a pleasing countenance, as prouder Princes use to do, when they have need of
Soldiers: To those that had but only the title, he gave a suitable command,
inviting them with fair and specious words, to lay out what they had gotten in
former wars, and promising great things unto them, and helped such as he knew
to be needy with moneys wherewith to raise men: He then cheered them up with
the undoubted hopes of profit and honor; He with big and grave words canonized
their precedent actions, neither could he keep himself from using some
exaggerations against them, who had been the original of the Empires ruin; he
moreover informed them, that the present adversity ought not to be of force
enough to distemper the valor of those, whose resolution stood in no need of
comfort: That this great ship of the Empire had been agitated by tempest, and
yet by wise government had escaped running upon the Rocks: He remembered them of
their past victories, bad them be confident of the like again, and told them
how he would reward those that should be faithful unto him. He afterward
gave in charge to the Colonels and Captains, who were uncasheered, that they
should complete their Companies, and knowing that those who were verst and
known among the people, and in good esteem amongst them have better means to
raise men, then those who are novices in war, he underwrit their Patents for
more Companies, allowing some fewer, some more, as he found them capable of
employment; he comforted them all with gracious speeches, which gave so much
the more contentment, because formerly his words were wont to be composed of
pride, and to intimate servitude; he afterward sealed up all he had to say
with civil entreaties, that they would upon this emergency give proof of that
worth and ingenuity which kept in continual exercise, should not apply it
self to be carried to victories by the prosperous winds of fortune, but by
cutting through the waves of difficulty, amidst the rocks of adversity,
assisted therein by the sounding line of wisdom. He promised them likewise
Impressed monyes, and good winter quarters, from which Commanders reap no little
advantage: since that the peoples daily contributions to the Soldier, falling
into the hands of the Officers, are not only alienated from their full number,
but in a good part from the remaining Soldiers; who being permitted to run
over the Country, and go a free-booting, care not much for the Contributions:
and hence it is that afterward the Soldiers growing licentious, treat the
good Subjects no otherwise then they would do the enemy.

Estimation which is the daughter either of fear or love, imprinted these
words of Walesteins in the hearts of those that heard them; for many of them
possessing goods and lands purchased in the Empire, and in Bohemia during the
late Rebellion, forgot not that it concerned them in their own particular to
do what they were able, as well to maintain what they already had, as to
better their estates and conditions; every one betook himself therefore to the
work, and much valuing his favor, who where he wanted not in affection, was
not sparing in greatness and liberality; they forbore not to spend part of
what they had gotten, which being ventured upon the bank of Plunder, was to
bring them in double advantage. Count Merodes went into Flanders to solicit
the Spaniards to raise an Army, to oppose Bawdis the Swedes General, and
William Landgrave of Hesse. Isolani went into Croatia and Hungary to raise
horse, and that he might the better intend the service, he was honored with
the title of General of the Nation: all the rest of the Commanders, that had
Commissions to raise men, went some into Moravia, some into Slecia, Austria,
Stiria, Carinthia, and other Provinces, where they understood men were least
employed, and were given to wars; so as every where the Drums were heard to
beat, the Trumpets to sound, and monyes were disburst, whereby according to
custom, the Emperors health being cheerfully drunk, and every one providing
himself, with good arms and other acoutrements, the people seemed by their
discourse to presage the ruin of the Swedes.

The greatest part of the horse wanted Curasses, by the loss of Arms in the
late routes, and particularly in the battle of Leypzik, where they were
either left in the field with their dead owners, or elsewhere thrown away by
such as fled there being therefore great want of arms and artificers, some
great men of Italy were by Walesteine sent into Lombardi to make a considerable
provision of them; and other Colonels sent Officers of their own, to the like
purpose, sparing no money in this behalf, not caring for expense; for the
Generals intention was to come into the field, not only rich in fame, but
furnished with whatsoever was requisite to a glorious Army: continuing
therefore his diligence, he treated with the King of Poland, to have men from
that nation, and in this he employed his Cosen-german Tersica, for they had
each of them married a daughter of Charles of Arrach, the Emperors chief
Counselor. This man being one of the richest Gentlemen in all Bohemia, was
not much troubled to find money to raise 3000. Horse, and 4000. Foot of sundry
nations.

Walsteine after this made the Counts Galasse, Mansfeild, Aldringer, and
Montecucully, Generals of the Artillery, all of them chief Commanders of the
Army; to these he recommended the care of recruting their old companies, and
the raising of new ones, which he allotted unto them; and they overcome with
the Generals gratitude, did their utmost to obey him. He moreover appointed
eight Sergeant Majors Generals of the Army, who have the command over the rest
of the Colonels, and whose place is to order the Army in the day of Battle:
and to these he gave new Commissions to raise men. They for the honor they had
received, and that they might preserve their Generals good will, (which was
ambitiously coveted by all) little waying the difficulty of raising men in
dispeopled Provinces, and full of troubles, where the poorest companion could
be had under 25. Dollers.

He gave Commissions to any one that desired employment, and disburst much
money by the way of loan, that the whole might be made up; neither did he make
any distinction as then of any that proffered their service; for holding it the
best counsel that can be given to a Prince, who is desirous to enlarge his
dominions, and to secure himself in the faith of his friends, and from the
injuries of his adversaries, to have copious Armies, that so he might do that
in some months, which otherwise would require some years to effect; his
intention was to gather together great quantities of armed men, who if they
should afterward want experienced Commanders, he wanted not old Captains
under whose Colors he might put these new men, and casheer those that were
incapable of such employment, before he was to march against the enemy: and to
this purpose he had wont to say, if the Emperor will raise an Army of 30000.
Soldiers, the Elector of Saxony, or some other Prince by the assistance of
friends, will do the like; that to fight with equal forces, was to have the
victory to be decided by fortune, and not to secure ones own self by power:
that time would be lost, their Territories would be oppressed, the subject
would be weakened by keeping forces, in their own Country, business would be
precipitated, and finally peace would ensue, the end whereof would be misery
and ruin to the vassals; that a numerous Army lords it over the fields, goes
whither it lists, meets with no obstacle, and being able to scour the Country
at pleasure, loses not Contribution nor the means to maintain it self; and
though this be contrary to some experience, where a few men have been known to
beat a great many, he said that this little number must be picked out of a
gallant and well reputed nation, and that the execution was easy, when the
Commander in chief had won the name of generous and magnanimous toward his
Soldiers. He would not forbear to let fall in his discourses, that the
Imperial Crown would be but weak, if it were not secured by 100000.
Soldiers kept continually in pay; for the Empire being a body of many members,
dissonant in Religion, it falls out, that by the liberty which many Cities
profess, and by the power of the Electors, and other Princes, the Caesarian
authority being by them lessened, sickens, and wanting forces, languishes as if
Crushed to death by her own fewdatories; in brief he so handsomely chid the
errors of late successes, as all such as were dejected by reason of their past
terrors, were seen suddenly to be clad with new hopes.

He moreover sent expresses to Charles Duke of Lorrayne, as well to keep him
in good correspondency with the Emperor, as to persuade him to raise men in
the assistance of the common interest, and that he would permit the Austrian
officers to raise men in his Country. This Prince being of high thoughts, and
inclyning to war, a lover of novelty, counseled by that vivacity which
sparkles in the hearts of sprightly Princes, and seconded by advice of others,
which uses not to differ from the inclination and genious of the Master; did
not only yield to Walesteines request, but declared that he would hazard his
life and fortune with him, arming and behaving himself, as the chief of this
league; of which it is said he aspired to be General; this was the first
beginning of the jealousies between him and France* and the reason why he drew
upon him the enmity of the King of Sweden.

These affairs past not without some knowledge of the Queen mother of France,
mother to the most Christian King, and to the Duke of Orleans, for at this
instant a gentleman of hers came to Zenam, who having had some discourse with
Walesteine was dismissed with appearances, that he was well apaid with his
negotiation: And the Austrians building much upon the troubles of France, whose
union did not a little disturb their designs, they more seriously applied
themselves to invent means and ways how to hinder the increase of that
flourishing Kingdom, by nourishing the differences between the Princes of the
blood, and thereby to afford fuel to the flames of Ambition; to kindle a new
intestine war sufficient to disturb the Forces of that great King; as well by
deviating them from his intentions upon the State of Milan, which in this
conjuncture was much feared, as to withhold from thence that assistance which
the Protestants expected. To this purpose it is said they sent some of their
trustiest creatures, concealedly to treat with the Duke of Orleans, and other
chief men that were discontented with the government of the Ministers of State
in France, not letting slip any thing that might hurl the French into those
straights whereunto they were leaning; for many were afraid that if the French
had declared themselves in this so calamitous time, after a hostile manner, all
their preparations would doubtlesly have been much perplexed if not totally
shipwrackt; but for that when God extends his hand of protection over a crowned
head, all the plots and hatreds of their envyers are rendered useless, many
considered, that the Emperor Ferdinand the second had not a little merited
from Heaven, whilst Princes and people jealous of the Austrian greatness, and
conspiring together to suppress the same, in stead of embracing an opportune
occasion of laying the Emperor upon his back, betook themselves to things of
uncertainty, and which concerned their private interests: so those arms which
openly joined together would have ruined the Empire, being unresolved and
expecting what the event of others would be, stayed from declaring themselves
till such time as the prevailing Forces of the Swedes growing weaker, and the
Imperial power in time gathering force, they should find it a hard matter to
abate the edge of that strength, which was inheartned by the experience of
Armies, and was made more stable by being shaked. Rome increasing under Romulus
had the good fortune, that whilst she was fought withal by diverse Nations,
she was not set upon by all at once: And whereas being all united they had
overcome her, they severally were by her overcome, and by their ruin affoorded
leisure to lay the foundations of the Roman Monarchy. It is a truth not to be
doubted of, that if the French not inferior in strength to the Austrians, and
who knew the Imperial greatness ought to have been suppressed, had followed
the King of Swedes fortune, and openly have drawn their swords, as afterward
they were enforced to do, they would either have brought the Imperial dignity
to make peace upon their own conditions, or else have led it to some great
exigency. That fire that is not quenched by a little water, gathering more
strength, and breaking forth in greater flames, will not afterward give way to
greater store of water: Whence it may be gathered, that when a Prince may by
his advancing prejudice his Enemy, whilst his Enemy is busied on one side, he
ought not to stand idle on the other, for it is well known that those Forces
which have overcome their first withstanders, made wiser by experience, grow
keener and better edged against the second.

Knowing moreover that the only Austrian Forces was not sufficient in such an
emergency as this to withstand the evils threatened by the victories and well
conducted Armies of the Swedes, and of so many other enemies, whose numbers by
their greatness and command was increased, they sent first the Cardinal d'
Arach, Walesteines kinsman, to the Pope, and after him Duke Savell (who being
found innocent, was absolved of the faults laid unto his charge by Tilly out of
some private ill will that he bore him) with pressing and earnest desires of
being from his Holiness assisted with good store of moneys; and news was
brought that the Pope had voted a considerable sum of money to be sent the
Emperor, though it were demanded with too much pretensions by the Austrian
Ministers of State, and advised for the interest of their Country by some
Cardinals of the Spanish Faction; and that they knew his Holiness to be very
careful of the good of Christendom, whilst by continual exhortations he had
endeavored the safety of Lombardy against the fury which the Forces bent
without regard upon the destruction of Mantua threatened; by whose example the
Christian Princes very well perceived, that to foment the greatness of
puissant Princes, was nothing else but to nurse up a Serpent in ones bosom,
which at last would poison its benefactor; as it would have proved in past
times, if the French and Swedes diversions had not recalled those Forces from
Italy, which neither the prayets, exhortations, nor protestations of the Pope
could prevail withal to make them turn back; they also sent to other
Potentates, and Princes of Italy, the Count Rabata then Governor of Gradisca,
no less powerful with his pen then with his sword, a gentleman of singular
understanding in any affair, who was very much welcomed by them all, with many
complements, but their expeditions proved unusefull.

When the Enemy watches we must not be asleep: therefore if Walesteine did by
these new inventions recruit his Army that he might in the Spring appear in
the Field; The King of Sweden grown hardy by his victory and other happy
successes, sent news of this his prosperous proceedings, to such Princes,
States and Cities, as were his friends; and dissuading the Hauns Towns, and
Princes of the Empire from assisting his Enemy, he did not sit still in this
his prosperity, but printing a Declaration, wherein was contained that he would
take as well Roman Catholics, as Protestants into his protection, that he
might not lose time, but make use of his fortune, he resolved forthwith to
march with his Army into Franconia.

This Province extends it self on the West and South side to the Confines of
the upper and lower Palatinate, on the East to Bohemia and Misnia, and on the
North side to Thuringia, so as it may be called the Center of Germany, it is
partly plain and partly adorned with pleasant hills, of a fruitful soil,
though in some parts sandy. It Is watered by the Rivers Main, Aisah, Ridnits,
Bints, Stray, Tawber, and others, to the no little advantage of the Inhabitants.

The King agreed with the Elector of Saxony, how he should behave himself in
the Kingdom of Bohemia; he left Bannier and Tod Marshals of the Field, with
other great Officers behind, as well that they might drive from the Confines of
Pomerania such of the Emperors Garrisons as yet remained there, as likewise
that they might endeavor to win Magdeburg and other Towns held by the
Caesarians in the lower Saxony, and he himself parted from Hall upon the River
of Sall, toward Erfurt the chief City of Thuringia.

This Province is seated between the Rivers Sall and Wesser, by which it is
much enriched; it is well peopled, abounding in Corn, Hay, and many sorts of
Beasts; it bounds on the South side upon Franconia, on the West upon the
Landsgrave of Hessen his Country; on the North it is covered with the
Herecinian Wood, and on the East it bounds upon Misnia; the Inhabitants thereof
believing themselves not able to contend with a victorious Army, at first news
of the Kings being marched that ways sent Deputies unto him, to see whether by
their entreaties they could make him turn another way, since they were not
able to do it by their Arms; they therefore presented themselves before him,
they made known unto him the Oath they had taken to the Elector of Mentz, what
troubles they had undergone for doing so, and promised that they would keep
Neutrals; but this medecin not being adequate to their malady, wrought no
effect. The King would enter their City, make them know his Laws, and own him
for their Patron; Septem. 26.
the which he did on the 26th of September, to less prejudice of the Citizens
then they imagined, who much affrighted at the report of what cruelties the
Swedes used against the Roman Catholics, could not free themselves from
fear, yet lost they nothing but their Patron, being treated by the King with
all demonstrations of sweetness.

A man ought not to be so overjoyed with a good victory, as that his heart be
distempered by the delights thereof: the King being therefore entered, Erfurt on
horseback, before he lighted off his Horse, he commanded Colonel Riven to
take with him twenty Companies of Horse, and three Regiments of Foot, and
therewithal to march presently to Ghota in Thuringia, seated upon the River
Nesa, which having neither walls nor garrison fitting to resist the Swedes
assault, the setting upon it and taking of it was one and the same action. The
King the next morning went to Ilminan seated upon the Ilm, on the Confines of
Franconia near to the Woods which divide those Provinces. This Town at his
first approach fell to Capitulation, as did Ghota, marching two days through
that great Wood, he came before the walls of Mansfield, which lies between the
Rivers of Stray and Verts, which gives the name to a circuit of Land lying
betwixt the Bishopric of Halberstat and Hall, and takes unto it self the
name of a County. He saluted it with many Cannon shot, and made two assaults
upon the defendants who stoutly resisted him: but the Governor knowing it
would be a hard matter to maintain the Town, succor being far off and
inexcessible, and the Swedes violences growing greater and inexcessible, and
the Swedes violences growing greater, he thought it was best to give that which
he could neither sell nor keep, and upon honorable Conditions to march forth
with Colors flying, Drums beating, and Bag and Baggadge; the which the King
courteously gave way unto, and he marched out much satisfied at the so great
Civility of an enemy; who observing it as an approved piece of Policy, that
civil usage and fair demeaner is a means to make men rather turn Subjects
then continue enemies, did punctually observe that course.

Men's wisdom is improved by nothing more then by the example of others, as
appeared by all the County of Hammelburg, a rich County, full of Towns, and
well peopled, Castles seated between Franconia and Thuringia, which following
the example of the Town of Mansfeild, yielded themselves to the Kings
obedience; this likewise caused the loss of Koningshoven, which lies upon the
bank of Sala, and which is gui^t about with strong walls and rampires, after
the modern fashion; before the which when the King appeared and battered it on
three sides, the King with threats annexed to promises, thereby both
inheartening and terrifying men's minds, by denouncing punishment to the
obstinate, and reward to the obedient, induced the Inhabitants to yield the
Town, which would otherwise have been stormed and burnt.

The gaining of this Town spread no little amazement through all Franconia,
and the adjoining territories, insomuch as all those which had yet any thing
left whereby to subsist, removed themselves, and the best of their movables to
places of better security.

Example which prevails much with reason joined to these his acquisitions,
Karlstat, Lucinfert, Hasfert, and Gemund, all of them seated upon the River
Main in the midst of Franconia, part of which were won by force, part upon
Composition, and almost all of them without any Imperial Garrisons: for Tilly
foreseeing how hard a matter it would be to keep them, and wanting men to
recruite his Army, whereby to enter the field again, had drawn those
Garrisons away for his own use, so as being only defended by Country people
and inhabitants, who were readyer to drink then to fight; and some of the
Towns environed with walls and ditches after an ancient manner, fearing to fare
as other Towns had done; which by their standing out had rather provoked the
Kings anger, then won his favor, they made no resistance, but capitulated;
though Karlstat and Lucinfart wherein were some Foot-Companies of the Elector
of Mentz, seemed to make some defense, rather to free themselves from the name
of Cowards, then to keep their allegiance to their Master. The King knowing of
what importance the taking of Wurtzburg would be to him, the Master-Towne of
Franconia, placed at the foot of a little hill upon the river Main, and
whereinto great store of monyes and other movables were brought from the
adjacent parts, and whereby he might much refresh his Army, marched with his
Forces toward it; October.
and in the beginning of October, he brought his Vanguard consisting of 8000.
Soldiers before the walls thereof, and planted his Cannon against it: the City
not being able with her ancient fortifications to resist modern inventions,
and the Citizens nor yet the Soldiers being of courage enough to make good a
breach which the King had quickly made, the gates were opened, being forsaken
of those of the League, who had retired themselves into the Castle. The Swedes
having won the City, presently beset the Castle, which was seated upon a
hill, and built upon a rock, so as favored not only by nature but by art
also, it seemed to be almost impregnable; yet though the Situation thereof made
the business appear difficult, the Swedes were encouraged by the speeches and
presence of their King, who infused a dauntlesse courage into them, whilst he
promised them booty, and honor; words able to inhearten the basest minds, and
which are the true spurs that thrust Soldiers upon all worthy actions: so
as after some days defense it was taken by the Swedes, who fought with much
cunning and without fear of death; for danger nauciates not him that is
accustomed to daring. They found there such abundance of Ammunition, moneys and
movables, as there were few that made the assault, who did not that day change
their apparel, and return to their lodgings with good store of Dollers.
Wurtzburg is a very sine Town, and one of the chief Cities of Germany, it
belongs to the Bishop thereof, who governes both in seculer and Ecclesiastical
affairs; his income mounts yearly to many thousand of Dollers, so as he is
numbered amongst one of the Ecclesiastical Princes of Germany. He is chosen by
the Chapter of Cannons, who governing as so many Senators, and the Bishop as
Prince, they have the semblance of a Republique.

Whilst victory and the sweets thereof was pursued by the Swedes, Tilly being
advertised that the King had left but few men in Saxony, in the Bishopric of
Magdeburg, and in Halverstat, the Metropolis of that sea, seated between the
Wesser and the Elb, and thinking therefore that he might there make some
diversion, whereby to withdraw the King from what he had possessed himself of
in Franconia, marched thitherwards, but understanding as he was upon his march,
how that the Swedes having taken the City, did batter the Castle, and being
much troubled at the loss thereof, it being a place which the Imperialists had
built upon, as a place of refuge in case of retreat, as also that there was
therein a magazine erected for all things which belonged to the maintaining of
arms; he changed his mind and resolved to succor the Castle of Wurtzburg, by
the safety whereof he imagined he might easily assist the Electors of Mentz and
Triers: but not comeing time enough to relieve it, nor knowing any means
whereby to divert the Swedes from their resolves, he resolved to fortify the
neighboring Towns, to munite the most important places of passage, and thus
to oppose the enemies further advancements; he therefore put garrisons in
Mentz, Ascheburg, Dieburg, Steinam, Heidlberg, Worms, and Ha^naw, all of them
principal Cities upon the Rheine and Main, beguirt with walls partly ancient,
partly with new rampires; and having taken fitting order for the safety of
those, October.
he in October passed with his Army over the Main to Silinghestat, between
Franckford and Ascheburg, and haulted in Berghestrazza a Country placed between
the Rheine and the Main toward the lower Palatinat, that he might have an
eye to the Swedes designs, and oppose them to some purpose: He likewise left
some foot Companies together with an hundred horse at Bomben^awsem near
Franckfort, which had then but a slender Garrison, being of opinion, that since
it was not weakly walled, any small Garrison would suffice for a while, to
entertain the Swedes, and to stop them in that prosperous course which
hitherto they had formerly had.

The Swedes this mean while endeavored the winning of Franconia, and Tilly
like a wise Pilot, who having his Masts spent by Tempest, minds the rigging
and trimming up of his weather-beaten ship, employed his care and diligence in
reparing the losses he had received, and in fitting himself for a new
encounter with the Swedes. Whilst Ghetz and Tiffiinbeck two of the
Imperialists Commanders kept with their forces, which were about 8000 men in
Slecia and Lusatia, principal Provinces in Germany. Slecia lies in the utmost
parts of Germany toward the East, upon the Confines of Polonia, being backed on
the South by Moravia, and on the North by Marca nova. And though in former
times it had a King of its own, and was of great terror to the Dutch, yet now
it is comprehended in the Crown of Bohemia; it abounds with all forts of
grain, and Cattle, and is full of Inhabitants; it conteines within it many
Dukedomes, Lordships, Principalities, and Earledomes, and the noble Oder runs
through the midst of it: Lusatia lies between the Elb, and Oder, and the
Confines of Bohemia, under the Crown whereof it is likewise comprehended, it is
watered by the River Spree and Niese, which makes it very pleasant and lovely.

The Duke of Sax. being joined with the Swedes, and his forces at this time not
near these parts, Ghetz advanced with his men toward Guben upon the Neise,
guarded but by a few Saxons, he set upon it and took it, so did he likewise
Dam, Ghuisson, and Spemberg, all of them places of no great consideration.
Tiffenbecke that he might not appear less diligent, entered the higher
Lusatia, and compelled Bousen a strong City upon the banks of Spree and
Gorsitz, and watered by Neise, to give large contribution and quarter to the
Imperialists. But peace being much desired in the Court of Vienna, with the
Duke of Sax. one of the greatest Princes of the Empire, whose union was the
ground work of the King of Swedes Forces, and the Emperors Council
considering that the Imperial Forces being entered to the prejudice of the
Duke, into these Provinces which had been formerly conferred upon him for the
expenses he had been at, and the service he had cone the Caesarian Majesty,
in his wars against the Prince Palatine, and the King of Denmark, it was not
a means to reduce him to the Emperors devotion, the aforesaid Commanders were
willed a little to temporise, and to withdraw their Forces from the places they
had taken. A little after this, November,
about the midst of November, Colonel Paradisi was dispach't away to Dresden
the Electors place of residence with propositions of peace, and with very
advantageous offers to the Duke, thereby to make him listen to an
accommodation; but all they could do to this purpose was lost labor; for the
obligations of this Prince to the King of Swede being so recent, he could nor
without an imputation to his fidelity, nor durst he for fear of those Forces
wherewithal he was round about beguirt, make any agreement without the Kings
consent; These Treaties therefore proceeded no further, nay the Duke was
counseled by the King to send his Forces against Bohemia, that so by that
Invasion the Swedes proceedings might be the more facilitated on the other side
of the Empire; and Harnem was commanded to march with his Army against that
Kingdom, and to give a beginning to their intended purpose, of bringing their
Army into Bohemia, and of wintring there, and driving the Emperors Forces
beyond the Danabe: he forthwith obeyed this order, and in November sent the
Count de Torre, and Offchirchem both of them Bohemians, to Siluchenaw, a place
upon the Confines of Bohemia, betwixt the Elb and Neise. This caused such ^eare
in the People of those Provinces, as terrified more by the ^ame, than by the
Sword of the Enemy, they betook themselves to their heels, and retired to
Bedrais, Tabor, and other strong Towns upon the Confines of Bohemia, toward
Moravia, and the upper Palatinate, and on other parts into Austria; so as the
Saxons found little resistance in Luitmeriz, Ausig, and Praga, which were
totally abandoned by the Imperialists, at the very hearesay of the Protestants
advancing; these places were therefore left unto the Protestants, by whom they
were much less rigorously treated then the Roman Catholics feared; nay, the
Saxons were not a little scandalized at many Monasticke Friars, who professing
that they would dye for their Religion, were notwithstanding the first that
forsook their Churches, their Parishes, and their care of souls: Egra in like
manner, upon the Frontiers of the Palatinate, in the Confines of Bohemia,
seated upon the River Rossell, a place of no mean consideration, by reason of
the pass whereon it was seated, without any resistance, threw open the gates
unto the Conqueror; and it is to be believed that the rest of the Cities
between M^lda and Danube would have done the like, had not the Saxons
themselves set a period to the progress of their victories: for being
careless and idle in Praga, and the adjacent parts, though the King had by
many redoubled Letters, advised and desired the Elector not to afford
Walesteine leisure to apply remedies unto their wounds; they gave themselves
over to the delights of those parts, and gave the Imperialists opportunity to
recruite their Army, and affoorded Galas means to come with good store of
Forces to Pils^m, a place of great importance in that Kingdom, very strongly
seated, by the which afterward those Territories were secured. The King did
not a little rescent this as appeared by his Letters, wherein he reproved the
Elector of negligence, though many of the wisest found it to be done out of
cunning; for it was apparently seen, that fearing by his assistance to raise
the Swedish Forces to too great a power and eminency, and considering that in
such a case he must be subject to their Laws, he temporized, that he might
afford the Austrians leisure to counterpoise this greatness, which weighed
down too much on the Swedes side; believing himself now to be in such a
condition, as that he at his pleasure might upon advantageous terms be
reconciled to the Emperor, and reassumed into his former friendship and
correspondency.

whilst the King reaped the fruit of his own propitious fortune, his Cosen
the Duke of Mechelberg and Marshall Tod laid seidge to Rostock, and took it;
3000 Foot and 300 Horse marched out of it, with their Arms and Baggage: the
surrender of this Town was caused by reason of the scarcity of Victuals, for
so great a number as were there; for a great many of the neighboring
Inhabitants had withdrawn themselves thither, as likewise many Soldiers that
were quartered in the towns thereabouts. Bannier came with a fresh Army of
about 8000 men into Pomerania, and used such diligence in the investing of
Vansleber, as the Imperialists that were therein unexpectedly surprised,
straightned in time to put themselves in a defensive posture, and having no
hopes of escaping, for they were surrounded on all sides, came to agreement,
submitting themselves to the Swedes Conditions, by whom the Common Soldiers
were enforced to inroll themselves under their Colors, and the Captains and
Officers were permitted to go into their own Armies. Bannier knowing how
advantageous the taking of Magdeburg and the neighboring Towns would be to
the Swedes marched forwards into that Episcopacy, (whither also went Benecausem
with 5000 Imperialists, to balance the Swedes designs, and to relieve the
City, which 'twas feared might be by them taken) he fought with the enemies
Horse, where the Swedes were worsted; he notwithstanding beset Magdeburg more
straightly, into which a succor of 14 Companies of the Romanists Foot were
put, who by their frequent Sallies, did much annoy the Swedish quarters which
were thereabouts.

Auxillius Oxesterne Lord Chancellor of Sweden, who had raised men in that
Kingdom and in Prusia, to reinforce the Kings Army, came much about this time
to the Camp with 6000 Foot and 800 Horse; so as the King not only enriched by
so many Victories, but his Army being increased by the addition of these men,
had his thoughts hightened, and aimed at greater enterprises. Wherefore being
informed that the Duke of Bavaria made extraordinary preparations for war,
and that he had not only made the greatest part of the country people guirt
swords about them, but also sent for Tilly with the Army of the League, to
protect the upper Palatinat, which were manifest tokens of fear, whereby the
Enemy is often times invited to further undertakings, he resolved to hinder
those preparations, and not to afford him time to salve the wound he had
received. But thinking it first requisite to know the resolution of the Hauns
Towns, who intended to be but lookers on at this sport, not siding with either
party, he resolved to found their intentions; wherefore he acquainted them of
Noremberg with his meanings; he made known unto them the foundation and drift
of his Forces, and desired they would openly declare themselves, either as
friends or enemies, and that they would not take any long time to do it; for
if they should demurre upon their answer, or color it with any appearing
excuses, he would take it as an express denial; for he liked not neutrallity,
nor would he take notice of any more then two parties, friends or enemies.
These resolute words of a victorious King, were of great efficacy, especially
amongst the Protestants, who coveted much to see their Religion propagated, and
were ambitious of novelty. The States of Noremberg after much debate, judged it
would be best for them openly to declare themselves as friends unto the King,
the which they did; whereat Tilly was so incensed, as though those of Noremberg
sent Deputies into the Camp unto him, to inform him of the necessity that had
enforced them thereunto, and so plead their excuse for so doing, they could not
prevail with him, nor keep him from expressing his rage and anger, (which was
the greater by how much greater the loss was that this declaration occasioned)
by beating his feet against the ground, pulling his Muschatoes, biting his
fingers ends, and vowing he would study some way of revenge, he forthwith
marched toward Rotemberg, and Oxemfert, two Towns in the midst of Franconia,
and surprised diverse other places of the said Province, which could neither be
maintained, nor succored in time; he likewise endeavored the taking of
Vertheim, a strong City seated upon the Maine, and in the mouth of Tawber, but
here he missed his mark: for the King having early notice thereof, gave the
Governor of the Town so timely advertisement, as he furnished it with all
requisite provisions, he therefore turned his course toward Noremberg,
resolving to chastise the Governor thereof for his breach of faith, but here
he likewise missed of his errand; for the Citizens having timely provided
themselves of all things necessary, and the Imperialists not having sufficient
Force for such an enterprise, and having the Swedes on his back, who gallantly
marched after him; after having feelingly expressed his resentments to the chief
Magistrate of the Town, and with great fervency exhorted him not to be failing
in his due allegiance to the Emperor, he quitted his quarters, and took his
way toward the upper Palatinate, recommending Lauffe, and Hasperg, places
belonging to the jurisdiction of the said Noremberg to the care of One Thousand
Foot, and One Hundred Horse, which he left there for their defense, he
distributed his Troops, part for the Marpuessate of Anspack in the upper
Palatinate, and part for Suetia.

The King, who very well knew how much it made for his vast designs, as well to
make himself Master of the Towns upon the Rheine, as to bereave the Austrians
of the help which they might have from thence, and that he might turn
himself toward the Danube; resolved to lead his Forces toward the Rheine,
for when he should have made himself Master of the passages thereof, he should
not only free himself from fear of being diverted on that side, which he
might expect to be by the Spaniards joined with the Duke of Lorayne, and by the
Forces of the Electors, and other Ecclesiastical Princes; but he should open
the way to the French succors, whereof he had then large and ample promises;
he then left some of his Forces in Franconia, under the Command of Gustavus
Horn, to watch the proceedings of the Imperialists, and he with the rest of
his Army went along the Maine toward Stenheine, and marched afterward from
thence with Eight Regiments of Horse toward Hannaw, a place surprised a little
before through intelligence had with Collonell Tuball, he having survayed the
Country, turned on the left hand, and with some Troops of Dragoons took
Offenbeck. He then knew it would be no hard matter to take Franckfort, a great
and fair City, and of great trading, by reason of Marts or Faires, by the
great concurrence whereunto, of all Nations it is much famed. This Town is
pleasantly situated upon the River Main in Franconia, which River after a
course of some thirty miles falls into the Rhene just over against Mentz, and by
the commodiousnesse of Navigation does more increase Traffic: It is begirt
with Walls and Ditches, after the ancient way in no very exact manner; the King
exhorted the Citizens thereof not to refuse the Propositions of agreement which
were offered; for as the present conjuncture of time was, he could do no less
then promise safety to the City, and secure unto them their Religion: but they
loath to forgo their Neutrality, speedily dispatched two Deputies to the King
to obtain leave to continue Neuters, putting him in mind of the Oath they had
taken to the Emperor, and of the loss they were to undergo by reason of their
Marts and Merchandising, and other good reasons which at another time had not
deserved punishment: For though this was not numbered amongst the Hauns Towns
of Germany, yet the greatest part of the Inhabitants were Roman Catholics,
and consequently did adhere to the Imperialists; so as though they pretend
Neutrality, they would not have let slip any occasion whereby they might have
prejudiced the Swedes, as they are used to do who seem to be what indeed they
are not: nothing therefore came of this Treaty, which whilst they were in
discourse of, the King made his army advance, and before they had ended all
they had to say, the City might see the Swedish Horse close by their Gates, and
their Foot in readiness to set upon it by force, if they would not condescend
to what was offered them; they were therefore enforced least they might meet
with the reward of obstinacy, courteously to quit that which they could not
without harm to themselves gainsay; they therefore submitted themselves unto
the King, Novem. 17.
and on the seventeenth of November they opened their Gates, and gave unto him
as an hostage of their fidelity, the Borough of Saxemhausen, placed on the
head of the Bridge, on this side the River over against the City, fortified
with Bulwarks and Rampires; where leaving Colonel Vitzhem Governor, and six
hundred Foot, he without delay marched through the City with his Army in good
order, and that very night came before Hoest, not far from Franckfort,
belonging to the Elector of Mentz: The Garrison whereof preparing for defense,
and seeming with some bodies of shot to be resolute to hold the King play for
some time, finding at last that they could not shun, either being sacked, or
making some prejudicial condition, they opened their Gates, and the most part
of the Garrison seeing that Fortune had forsaken their former Masters, betook
themselves to the Service of the Swedes.

When Fortune singles such encounters as happily present themselves ought not
to be let slip: this place being therefore taken, the King gave order that
Kenigsteine should presently be set upon, which is seated upon a passage of
great importance, and is of considerable strength, so as it commands all the
adjacent Country. He also sent part of his Forces before Kockein and Vlersheime
upon the Maine, that they might throw over a Bridge to facilitate more
Conquests: Having given these orders, and seen the Batteries levelled against
the Walls of Vlersheime, with the taking whereof he was very well pleased; for
this being near the Rhene upon the Maine, on the side of Mentz, freed him from
the troubles which the Garrison thereof might occasion him; and freeing the
Country on this side Rhene, and thereby securing himself behind, he might
without any manner of fear, go to new undertakings; he built a Bridge of
Boats that he might pass his Army, and provisions to and again at his
pleasure, he returned to Franckfort to give audience to certain Ambassadors,
and to treat with some great men, about the ordering of affairs for the better
facilitating the next years undertakings; but he could not stay there above
six days, for having received advertisement how that diverse Troops of
Spaniards and Flemings raised in Lusemberg, were marching apace toward the
Palatinate, to recruite the Garrisons of Mentz, Worms, Franchendall,
Heidelberg, and other Towns in those parts, as yet held by the Imperialists,
he broake off his Treaties of Negotiation, and returning speedily to his Army,
he marched along the Rheine, and by the means of a Guide who led him a way not
much frequented, he with the greatest part of his Army, which had now done with
Vlersheim, having at the end of eight days taken it upon composition, went to
Ringaw, the Country where the best Renish Wines are made, he surprised a great
Body of Spaniards and Burgonians, who were quartered in Walfe, putting most of
them to the Sword, which infused such fear into the Garrisons of Rodesheim,
and Ernsfeilt, Walled Towns near Mentz, but of no great moment, as that
overcome with the apprehension of the Swedish Forces, they opened their gates
unto him; parting afterward from Ringaw, he advanced so far and so fast, as
that he faced Mentz upon the Rhene, against the which he made some Cannon play,
rather by way of salute, then with an intention of harm. The channel of the
River growing here very broad, he resolved to repasse over the Main to tarry
in Berghestrate, and seek out how he might pass over the Rhene there, those
parts being but slenderly guarded. But the Spaniards foreseeing this, had burnt
and sunk all the Boats on that shore which were fit to pass over the
Swedes, insomuch as the King found his labor was here little better then lost:
When a Dutch Soldier having (as it often falls out) won into the friendship of a
Fisherman of Gernsheime, named John Varter, prevailed so far with him by
promise and profers of advantage, as that by the help of another mariner of
the same place, they recovered some of the Boats that had been sunk, and
emptying the water out of them, made them so fit, as that at sundry times they
passed 2000 of the Foot over the River: and the King by these securing the
landing on that side, (for by the means of great trees, linckt and fastened
together, (a modern invention) they made Trenches and Palisadoes) past over a
good part of his Army: he unexpectedly came before Oppenheime, not far from
the Rhene, fortified with walls and Towers after the ancient manner, seated upon
the back of a little hill; the Garrison whereof having the Rhene for their
Trenches, which they thought he could not so easily pass over, feared no
harm; the Town was hotly set upon; for the Soldiers invited by the hopes of
booty, whereof great store was said to be there, thronged in crowds into the
Ditch, and the Breaches which were there made, defying death, and not regarding
the dead bodies, which in no small numbers lay in their way. The Defendants
making no show of fear, played the parts of valiant Soldiers, hoping for
relief from Mentz; but much more encouraged by the promises of the Governor,
a Spaniard, who was a well advised man, and much experienced in war, and who
neither believed that the King was so strong in men, nor that he should fail
of being relieved: But the assailants, which in two days stormed the Town,
and entering it by force, killed all that they met withal at the first in a
defensive posture, and sacked the City which was well-nigh half burnt to the
ground, by a fire which therein happened casually, that very day, by the means
of a drunken Dutch-woman. There being in Oppenhaime but few Barks and
Materials sufficient to build a stately Bridge, the King hasted to build the
Bridge over, which having passed the rest of his Foot, his Horse and his
Cannon, he marched with his Army too before Mentz, where the Defendants being
provided of all things requisite for their preservation and defense, and having
done what they could to defend themselves within bare old Walls and weak
Trenches, being out of hope to make good the Town against the Swedes, who with
Military discipline drew nearer and nearer thereunto, desired a cessation of
Arms; which being granted by the courteous King; and they knowing that the
enemies Army consisted of about 26000 Soldiers, and above 20 piece of Cannon,
they thought themselves not sufficient without a greater addition of Forces to
defend it, they therefore treated, and had such conditions granted them as
became a gracious Conqueror. They marched out in December, December.
with their Arms, Bag and Baggage, to the number of above 2000, part of which
took pay of the King; who holding it for an advantageous precept to proceed
kindly with his enemies, did thereby reap so much good, as that many invited
more by his kindness, then by fear of his strength, yielded to that, to which
they would not so soon have been brought by severity; in the which he much
glorifying himself, had wont to say, that lenity in treating was the best
Centinell that Princes could have, that people wish well to them they love, and
death to them they fear.

THe Austrians exalted designs being by the loss of Mentz overthrown, 1632.
and the high hopes of the Ecclesiastical Princes dispersed by that blow. The
Kings universal proceedings did so blunt the Spaniards boldness who were
quartered thereabouts, as that their Councels being confused, their Forces
dismembered, and the vigor of the Catholic League crushed: that Circuit of
ground which being possessed of an appearing power, seemed to threaten the enemy,
encumbered on a sudden with fear and astonishment, did encourage the
Protestants to new achievements; so as the opportune Situation of this City
(being one of the chiefest of all those Provinces) upon the banks of Rhene,
and over against the Main, opened the way to the getting of Bacharach, and
other adjoining places, which at the first sight of the Swedes forerunners
yielded themselves; Wisbaben, Hofen, and Koningstein all of them belonging to
the Elector of Mentz, were likewise brought under the Kings obedience. Duke
Bernard of Waymar a Prince of the blood of Saxony, and descended from that
Frederick whom the Emperor Charles the first bereaved of his estate, had not
many months before raised 4000 men at his own expense, and was entertained by
the King, and honored with the title of Master General of the Field, whose
valor was exceedingly seconded by fortune. January.
This man in the beginning of January did by way of stratagem send 500 Horse,
by night too, before the gates of Wahnheime, a Fort standing upon the Angle
which is made by Necker, where it falls into the Rhyn, to the end that seeming
to be Imperialists, who had been defeated by the Swedes, they might endeavor
the being received into the Town. These men behaving themselves wisely, and by
the assistance of some fugitives fled from the Garrison, who were acquainted
with the customs of the Town and of the Guard, deceiving the Centinell, the
Officers, and even the Governor himself, with suppositions, names,
likelyhoods, and appearing conjectures, were admitted into the Town; where
scouring the streets, opening the gates, seizing upon the Port, and cutting in
pieces all they met, they let in their Companions who were not far off, and
made themselves masters of the Town. Thus it befalls Governors, who believing
in others, have not as yet known that often times hard and incredible things
have unexpected events, they not having learnt to sleep with their eyes open.

In the inundation of victories, and the mannaging of Military affairs,
Politic considerations and negotiations ought not to be forgotten: therefore
the King staying some days at Mentz to discuss diverse businesses of weight,
thought it not fitting to pass by an exact consideration of the present
affairs; so as calling together his chief Councillors, and the Prime
Commanders of his Army, and jointly weighing the interests of their Forces,
there were some seconded in their opinion by Benard Waymar, who persisted in
their advise, that they should turn their Forces to the utter subversion of
the Roman Catholic Army, they made good their opinions with these reasons;
That the field Forces being scattered, Germany being a large and open Country,
the winning of Towns would be no hard matter, which being weak in defense,
and abandoned by their Armies, would strive rather to captivate the Kings good
will by ready obedience, than draw his anger upon them by their unwise
pertinency; that they should not do well to lose so much time in the taking in
of places of small moment, whilst the Enemy recruited and reinforced his
Army; that the Austrians had no better friend then time; that they had always
repaired their losses, when either by cunning or otherwise they could fence
themselves from the first violence; that though the Emperors own men and
moneys were well exhausted, yet by the assistance of Spanish Gold, and by
recruites from Italy (a Nation by experience known to be advantageous to
Germany) he might remit himself into his former condition that the Elector of
Bavaria who was much concerned in the Austrians welfare, wanted not a stock of
money, and territories sufficient from whence to draw out Soldiers, and
regaine what he had lost: And (which was of greatest importance) that the
Generals place was conferred upon Walesteine, who having gathered a mass of
riches in the past wars, being excessively ambitious of glory and great
actions, would not be failing in any thing that he knew might make him
remarkable upon this occasion; that they had the French on that side for
friends, who bringing their Forces upon their frontiers, would hinder the
Romanists from doing any thing prejudicial to the Swedes, that therefore they
should leave off those machinations and rub the soar again, before it be
healed. But these reasons, though they had much of influence upon all the
Commanders, and drew many of them to be of this opinion, yet the King weighing
them in the balance of his wisdom, was for his own interest sake enforced to
oppose them; saying, That the Empire hung upon two strings; the one composed of
the self- Austrian Forces, the other of the Roman Catholic, and
Ecclesiastical powers; that they were to consider which of these two were to
be taken away, to overthrow this Chaos; that he granted the reasons concerning
the Spanish Gold: Bavaria, and Walesteine were very valid, but that they were
not to throw behind their backs, but rather intentively to look upon the aid
from Flanders, the assistance of the Electors and Ecclesiastickes, and of the
Duke of Lorayne, who being desirous of war, could not hereafter expect a
better occasion then this, to put himself in Arms; that these men though they
were new, and not accustomed to war, yet were they so inheartened by their
Princes courage and hope of good success, as seeing us retire, they would
resume the more courage, and cause unto us such prejudice, as usually is
received from Enemies, strengthened by strong impressions; that it was
requisite to extinguish the fire, which increasing would not be so easily
suppressed, before they should carry the Cumbustion elsewhere, that the Spanish
succors from Flanders was more considerable then from Italy, for that complete
Arming would be found hard in Italy: A Kingdom impoverished in people, and the
numbers whereof would be much lessened before they should pass over the
Mountains, for that the rigid Climate of Germany, and the Germans severe
manner of lying in the field did not well agree with that Nation, nurc'd up in
the delights of Peace; that for their money they might have men enough in the
Low-Countryes; that he knew the Treasury and Forces of the Elector of Bavaria
was very considerable, but that on the other side he knew he was not so lavish
in laying out his moneys, nor his men so ready to take up Arms; that
Walesteine was a humerous Fool, a fantastical brain, fit for Comedies,
reverenced for his wealth and fortune, not for his wisdom and proper valor;
that he was envied by many, a corrivall with Bavaria, and not well thought of
by the discreet Don; for what concerned their hopes upon the French, it was to
be granted it would be advantageous to them, if Princes were not ambitious of
enlarging their dominions: But since France was known to be no less intent to
this then whatsoever other Kingdom, he could not promise himself that the
French would invert the proceedings of the Duke of Loraine, and of the
Ecclesiastics against the Swedes; but rather that leading their Forces upon
their Frontiers, and entering either as protectors of the one, or arbitrators of
the other, he foresaw they would rather put in for themselves through the
disagreement of the Swedes and Imperialists then assist the Protestants in
their proceedings: moreover, that they ought to fear, least if they once
should get footing here, they should (following the policy of Princes, who are
friends as long as it makes for their own good) moderate the greatness of
others, and dissolve the League at any time when they should see the Swedes
power grow to an excessive greatness. Tod and Tuball would be sufficient to
hold Tiffenbech and Ghetz play in Slesia; that the Elector of Saxony being
entered into Bohemia, it would be no hard matter to disturb Walesteines
designs, and that Bannier was sufficient to watch over Bavarias ways; that
therefore they ought to secure themselves on this side for what was on their
backs, which being done, the victory on the other side would easily be
affected. These reasons alleged by the King, made the Commanders aware, that
Councels then succeed best when they proceed from the hidden reasons of
interests; and that no resolution ought to be built upon the fair shows of
Princes, the groundwork of their demonstrations not being composed of any
sound materials, but colored over as best seems pleasing to the eye of the
present conjuncture.

All of them therefore forgoing their first opinions, they unanimously
condescended to the King; who seeing what need they had of a good Sanctuary,
whereunto upon any ill success they might safely retreat, as likewise how
necessary it was to fence Franconia, after he had diligently suryeyed all the
neighboring situations, could find none more commodious then that Angle which
is placed betwixt the Rhene, and that part of the Main, which is over against
Mentz, on the side of the Palatinate, he therefore made a design be there
drawn in his own presence, of a Fort consisting of seven Royal Bulwarks, a
Seat so availeable, as lying in the midst between the State of Mentz and the
Palatinate, upon the sides of two Navigable Rivers, it might be said to be the
Key which opens and shuts the entrance and outgoing on both sides of the Rhene,
whereby he might continually bridle the Inhabitants as well of the one as of the
other circle: moreover, besides the securing of what he had already won,
there was hereby a way opened to ends not yet known. He gave it the name of
Gustavemborg, though through the Soldiers playing upon the Roman Catholics,
it came to be called the Priests scourge; alleging thereby, that being seated
in the sight of Mentz, and in the very midst of the Electorate, it was fit to
keep the neighboring Prelates in obedience and under the yoke of the Swedish
Forces. Having left order for the perfecting of this Fabric, and for the
preservation of Mentz, he with his Army marched in January against Spier, the
Magistry whereof endeavored, though in vain to keep Newters: for the King
having declared himself to be an Enemy to that name, this Town accorded, as
did likewise Worms, Landaw, and Weissenburg, Cities beyond the Rhen in the
lower Palatinate, begui^t only with ancient walls, these submitted themselves
unto the King, quartered some of the Swedish Regiments, and parted with some
moneys to free themselves from the insolency of the soldiers. Franckendal and
Heidelberg, Towns well provided with men, victuals and Fortifications, were
the only two places that held out against the King: For though they were at
this time set upon with much violence, they undauntedly defended themselves,
and rendered the attempts of the Enemy vain, who held it not fit to lose time
before such Forts, since they were Masters of the Field, and consequently might
overrun whole Provinces, and hinder the new recruiting of the Enemies Army.
Franckendal lies in an open Country between Spier and Worms, surrounded with
gallant Bulwarks, Ditches, and Rampires, it was anciently the chief strength
the Elector Palatine had; but since the overthrow in Bohemia, it was held by
the Austrians. Heidelberg is seated upon the N^cker in the mouth of two
Mountains, upon which the Palace and Castle stands; and here the Count
Palatine had wont to keep his residence before the Emperor bereft him of his
state.

At the same time that the Swedish Forces meeting with less opposition, did
overrun the Country that lies upon the Rhen and Franconia. Popenheime having
drawn out the greatest part of the Garrisons from the places upon the Wesser,
and out of the Country of Brounswyck, they being known to be little available
to the preservation of those places, weak in situation and Fortification; and
having gathered together a Body of men to about 10000 Soldiers, he recovered
Barleben upon the Elb, which made no great resistance, from thence he passed
toward Magdeburg to relieve the besieged; for being beleaguerd by Bannier,
they were reduced to some necessity, and herein his success was good: For
Bannier understanding his approach, and thinking the Romanists Army to be much
greater then his, withdrew himself aside to Kalbe, upon the banks of Elb. Here
he took up his Quarter in an advantageous Seat, shunning to fight; for the
King having given general directions to all his Commanders who were disjoined
from the Army that himself led, that without great advantage and certainty of
victory, they should shun coming to a general conflict, he temporised,
betaking himself only to such enterprises as agreed with the Kings
instructions; whose ends was to keep the Imperialists Forces severed in sundry
places, that he might have the more freedom to make his desired Conquests, and
to beat the maine Body of the Roman Catholics, which when he should have
done, the members thereof would be of no use. Pappenheim having thus raised the
siege, though he failed in some intentions he had of falling upon the Swedes
Quarters, who had withdrawn themselves further off, entered Magdeburg, and
straightway sent his Vanguard toward Gomeren, a place belonging to the
jurisdiction of the Bishop thereof upon the Confines of Saxony, but he began
no sooner to march, then he was advertised that George Duke of Lunenburg, a
Protestant Prince and who adhered to the Swedes, was drawing near to
Wolfenbuttell a place of great moment, which made him think it requisite to
turn his march thitherward; for this Town standing in the Center of the
territories of Brounswyck, and being strongly seated upon the River Alre, being
likewise the place of refuge for the Imperialists, and the Arsenall of their
Army, by means whereof their Forces in those parts did wholly subsist; if it
should have fallen into the Swedes power, either by holding intelligence or
otherwise, it would have been a great advantage to the Protestants Forces, and
a very great blow unto the Roman Catholics; he therefore drew out the
Garrison from Magdeburg, and knowing it would be a difficult matter to
maintain it, he slighted it, breaking down the Walls in sundry parts, to the
end it might not be of service to the Swedes: he advanced toward Sechenser and
Wolfenbuttell about the end of January. Bannier had news hereof, January.
who being certified of truth, that the Imperialists were departed, returned
suddenly to Magdeburg, where he left good order for the repayring it, judging
it a place of no small importance for the affairs of Swethland; he from
thence marched after Pappenheime and won Steimbruck, intending thereby to
streighten the enemies Army; for this being a pass of some importance upon the
River Obroe, and very commodious for the Imperialists, the Swedes might here
have fought with much advantage against their enemies, but Pappenheime did so
gallantly acquit himself as though he was beset on both side by the
Protestants, he without any loss came to Beterloo, a strong place not far
from the River Glien, between the territories of Heye and the Bishopric of
Hildeskeim, having brought under Contribution the Towns of Brounswyck and
Lunenburg, rich Provinces, which lie between the Wesser and the Elb, bordering
on the South upon Misnia and Thuringia, on the North upon the Lower Saxony; he
at last recovered the Confines of Hamelen, that he might make use of that
City, and of the Wesser, as well for the safeguard of his own Forces, as for
the preservation of such Towns as had not yet revolted from Caesar, wherein
his success was so happy, that by this occasion he had means to show how
advantageous in war it is, to have undaunted, wise, and valliant Commanders,
and (which is of greatest concernment) such as understand their profession, he
defended, he maintained himself, and with a few men stopped the enemies
advancing; who knowing him to be resolute and industrious, durst not come to
handy-blowes with him: effects which are not only occasioned by men's fearful
apprehensions, whose loss takes its rise from self belief, but particularly
by the valor of other men, which begets fear and admiration even in the Enemy.

High minds are always verst about great matters, the King being gone from
Mentz, considered the importancy of Creutsbag, a Town seated upon the River
Nail, which takes its head from a little Lake in the state of Swibrechen
called Scheidambergerway'd, falls into the Rhyn at Binghem, by the taking hereof
he should secure unto himself the possession of the neighboring parts; he
should drive the Spaniards from those Frontiers, and should open the way to the
winning of the Towns upon the Mosel belonging to the jurisdiction of Triers*
and thereby not only keep those people under, but fortifying himself on that
side from being injured by the Spaniard, he should bring his Forces there into
a good condition; for it was a place environed with good Ditches and strong
Walls: he forthwith beset it, and planted three great Batteries against it, and
without delay began to assault those fortifications, from the which he by the
Defendants was by reciprocal resolution kept off, they exercising the utmost
of Military art, as being the most of them Spaniards, a faithful Nation, much
adicted to the service of their Prince, and in the sufferings of war, of all
others the most resolute and constant. The King in his own person came before
this place, not without danger of his life; for approaching according to his
custom near the Walls, that he might more inhearten his Soldiers, and know
what was requisite to the enterprise, being much grieved for the reputation of
his Arms, and for his own interest sake, to linger so long before such a
Town, a Page who at that instant presented him with a letter, was slain by a
Musket Shot; upon which accident Mounseir de Pauch Ambassador from the States
of H^lland, who was then with him, could not forbear entreating his Majesty to
have more care of his Royal Person, the preservation whereof, like that of the
soul in the body, was the maintaining of the public liberty, to the which he
smilingly replied; My Lord Ambassador, Cities are not taken by keeping in
Tents; the Scholar when his Master is a far of, shuts his book; so the
Soldier without my presence slaken their handy blows; my hour is written in
Heaven, it cannot be altered on earth; then turning himself to a Colonel, who
being somewhat deteyned under the Barbers hands, came to receive his Commands,
he said unto him; I marry, this is a gallant Cavalier, and by my faith a
valiant one in woman's wars; he is longer in trimming of his Beard, then I am
in taking in a Town: Having said these things pleasantly, he advanced yet more
forward, giving order to streighten the Town yet a little more; the which was
done with such diligence as upon like occasions is requisite, in execution of
the orders of their Lord and Master; whence it is to be observed how available
the presence of a Prince is in Military affairs. After it had endured three
fierce Assaults, and had been pelted with above 1700 Cannon-shot, at fourteen
days end he enforced the Defendants to beg Articles of him, which were granted
unto them, no less favorable then those of Mentz; and thus he made himself
Master of the Town, to the admiration of many, who knowing how the Town was
seated, what number of men it had in it, and how it was provided, thought it
not a work to be effected with foot in stirrup. He then dispatched away Horn,
and Duke William of Waymar Elder Brother to Duke Bernard into the Bishopric
of Bam^berg, which is a space of ground in Franconia, lying between Bohemia and
the Main, appertaining to the Bishop thereof, who is as well a Temporal as a
Spiritual Lord, that they might set upon that City, and by the taking thereof,
divert Tilly, and Count Aldringer, who were diligent in recruiting their Forces
in those parts. He himself with the rest of his Army having provided
themselves with all things requisite for Victuals, with a great Train of
Artillery and Ammunition, having left fitting order for the maintaining of the
Towns along the Rhene, took his way toward Steinham, and Ascheburg, entering
thereby into Franconia: being come to Schewinfurt, and from thence to
Gelterseym, he again recalled the Forces of Gustavus Horn, designing to go
himself in Person with the gross of his Army, against the Army of the Roman
Catholics, and endeavor to bring them to a new Battle, the Victory whereof
was the bounds of his vast desires: turning therefore upon the right hand he
bent toward Kitzing, betwixt Erbipoli and Bamberg, a Randezvouz for Tillyes
Forces; but found that he being diffident of his strength, as both in number
and in courage much inferior to the Swedes, had retreated into the upper
Palatinat; that he had reinforced the Garrisons of Forcheim and Granach, two
of the best Towns in Franconia, by the preservation whereof he hoped not
only to make good the Imperial Forces in that Province, but thereby retarding
the Swedes proceedings, he thought he should be able when his Army should be
recruited from all parts that appertained to Caesar, to face his enemy again,
and regaine his loss in the Battle of Leipsick. The King encouraged
hereupon, believed that (as it is usually) he that flies fears; and hoping to
drive him quite beyond the Danube, and beat him in the field, he sent Gustavus
Horn toward Winsheim, which lies between Nurenberg and Erbipoli, and from
thence to Habersdorfe, and Shennabach, places of that Country; who marched with
such diligence, as though the enemy in their retreat had broken down the
bridges, burnt and destroyed all that might be serviceable to the Kings Army,
that they might streighten him in Victuals, incommodate him, and stop him, till
such time as the Forces which they expected from Bavaria and Walesteine, were
come unto them; the King notwithstanding arived about the midst of February in
the fields of Nurenberg, beyond the expectation of the Imperialists. February.
He there mustered his Army, and found it to consist of 130 Cornets of Horse,
86 Foot Ensigns, and 28 pieces of great Cannon; which having again ordered,
he pursued his way toward Dunawert upon the Danube, where there is a Bridge
over that River, which makes it a place of great Consequence; for by the
getting thereof, the way was opened to the Swedes for their entrance into
Bavaria, one of the chief Provinces of Germany, between the Danube and Inn, an
open Country, not having any place of strength within it, unless it be
Ingolstat. He came before Vitsborg, a Fort belonging to the Marquisat of
Anspach, he sent to the Governor to Surrender the Town, otherwise he
denounced his anger against him, and therewithal the loss of his life: but
such threats did no ways trouble the undaunted Commander, who preparing for
defense, the Kings threats were of no avail, for it made not for the King to
stay there, since thereby he should have given time to the Roman Catholics,
(as was desired by Tilly) to provide for the defense of Danube: he therefore
marched forward in the beginning of March, and with his Army drew nigh to
Dunawert, where the Imperialists had built a Fort upon the hill, which he set
upon, and finding nothing to withstand him in those yet imperfect works, March.
he forced the defendants to retire into the Town, which being played upon by
the Kings Cannon, which thundered on all sides, and assaulted round about, the
Walls not being sufficient to withstand the Cannon-shot, which drilled their
Trenches through, and overthrew their Towers, the Inhabitants dispairing of
succor from Tilly, thought they had done the duties of good Soldiers, and
being so persuaded, forsook the City which might very well have yet held out
for some time. They broke the Bridge and withdrew themselves into Ingolstat, to
the great resentment of Tilly, who (as they are wont to do, that are abandoned
by fortune) found opposition to all his designs, even in those things wherein
he thought himself most secure.

The Swedes having entered the City, and repaired the Bridge withal speed, they
passed their horse over the Danube, and overrunning all the neighboring
Towns without any resistance, the damage was not little which the people
received by the insolences of the Soldiers, to whom the Soldiers
licentiousness seemed the more grievous, in that they had not formerly been
acquainted with the evils of war, which is used in all Nations against
enemies, especially against such as are of another Religion. The King being
afterward informed of the Condition of the Roman Catholic Army, he lodged
his Army near Druisse, and extended his Quarters along the little River
Schmutter, watching over Tillyes ways, who having enlarged his Forces by the
access of multitudes of Bavarians, kept himself along the Banks of Lech, a
chief River, which taking its head from the Mountains of Tirolo, divides
Bavaria from Swabenland, and falls into the Danube at Dunewert. The King knowing
that Princes resolutions are then best, when they proceed from the advises of
their Commanders, thought it not fitting to advance further before he knew the
minds of the heads of his Army; he therefore did send for them to him, and
acquainted them with what his designs were; what advantage the winning of
Bavaria might be to them; that if they could bereave the Austrians of that
leaning stock, either by drawing the Electour to some fair agreement, or by
utterly ruinating his Country, they might easily afterward lead their Forces
into Austria, and into Caesar's very patrimoniall territories: mature
consideration being had hereupon, 'twas found it would be a hard business to
effect, since the Lech was guarded all along by great numbers of the enemies
Soldiers. The King notwithstanding with his wonted courage was for the
undertaking, alleging for his reason, that to an enemy already terrified and
beaten, the more difficult the undertaking were, the greater confusion it would
cause in them; to the which, reply was made by Horn and other Captains, that
they should not do well to fight with the enemy upon such disadvantage of the
River; that the enterprise would be difficult, and that to boot with the
difficulty thereof it was to be considered of what consequence (if they should
be worsted here) the great inheartning thereby of the enemy would be, who were
not yet so weakened, but that they were able to encounter with the greatest
Forces that the Protestant Colleagues could make; that the Country was entirely
their enemy; that they wanted a place of refuge, whereinto in case of a storm
to retreat; that no little heed was to be had to Walesteines preparations, who
grown strong in Bohemia, and in the upper Palatinat, would bring the Swedish
Army in that nooke or angle, either to a dangerous Battle, or to unevitable
destruction; that his opinion was, they should put off this resolution to a
more oportune time, and that they should go against Moravia, to suppress the
Emperors Army; the which being the head, if it should be overthrown, the other
members would be weakened. The King having given diligent ear to these
alleged reasons, did with his wonted dexterity rise up, and reply; that the
Passage of the River ought not to be feared, though it were guarded by the
enemy, for the Imperialists were already at their wits ends, by reason of the
Swedish Victories; that their recruites consisted of people more inured to the
plow and to the mannuring of ground, then to the handling of weapons; that
fortune favored the forward, and frowned upon the fearful; that she had
turned her back upon Tilly, who after the first was to expect a second
discomfiture; that Dunawert being well guarded would serve them for a place of
safety, whereunto they might retreat in case of any misfortune; that they were
to pursue that Army, which being led by an old experienced Soldier, not unlike
a Snow-ball, which by rouling up and down becomes a great heap, might gather
strength again, and recruite himself into his former Condition; that
Walesteine was far off, and had but few men, and those but fresh water
Soldiers, and therefore no fear was to be had of him; and concluding with the
manifestation of what profit and riches they should get in Bavaria and
Swabenland, he drew the greatest part to side with him, and knowing how
advantageous it would be to possess himself of those Towns which lie between
Lech and Iber, he commanded Horn with some choice Regiments of Horse to make
excursions even to the walls of Vlm, which is a Hauns Town well munitioned, and
one of the richest in all Germany, seated upon the banks of Danube in the
midst of Swabenland, the Inhabitants whereof being most of them Protestants, if
they should see the Swedish Forces greater then the Imperialists in those
parts, would without delay cast themselves into his protection; he gave him
further in charge, that he should invite the Magistracy thereof to good
correspondency, and that he should endeavor to bring all the places
thereabouts to his devotion; all which Horn did, not meeting with much
difficulty therein, for many of those Towns seeing the Conqueror in the midst
of their territories, and wanting of defense, only walled about with old Walls
without Garrisons, and frighted, as those use to be who see their enemy before
their gates, strove who first should bring in their Keys and Contribution
money to the Swedish Officers, who by the Kings directions did treat those
people so civilly, and had so particular a care to be less grievous to them
then were the Austrians, as they moderated the report, that the Roman
Catholics had given out of them, insomuch that (as those which apprehend most
are usually best contented) those people overcome with the Swedish courtesy,
could not but confess that they were better treated by their enemies then by
their friends.

These speedy acquisitions caused much suspicion in the Magistracy of Auspurg,
where though there were Citizens enough, and the Garrison which were paid by the
Senate thereof, strangers, sufficient to defend the same; yet the Electour of
Bavaria fearing left (the greater part thereof being Protestants) it should
rather have inclined to the prevailing Swedish party, then to that of Austria,
endeavored to bring in a Garrison of Papists; and wrought so secretly
underhand with some of the Officers, as that he brought into the City two
Companies of Horse and 2000 Foot, who speedily disarming the Protestant
Inhabitants, possessed themselves of the Gates and of the Arcenall, and the
Soldiers being changed, the Guards were doubled. But the King who upon all
occasions did ever desire to advance, was minded to pass over the Lech, and
remove Tilly from thence, who kept the maine body of his Army along that River;
and although the enterprise was somewhat hard, yet observing the course of the
River and the Banks thereof, he suddenly raised thereupon a good Trench, and
planting his Artillery, began to play upon the enemy, who keeping themselves
close within their Trenches, did valiantly reply upon him and withstood his
Passage: the bickering began to grow very hot, where whilst both sides were
busied and plied the Battle a pace; the King being advertised by Duke Bernard
Waymar how that he had discovered a Foord, a little lower, by a little Island,
by the one side whereof he might easily wade; he presently sent back the said
Duke thither, with certain Boats carried to such like purpose upon Carts.
Whilst the King-indeavoured by all means he could to pass over, Waymar past
over some select Soldiers by the benefit of those Boats into the said Island,
to the end that if need should be they might make good the Passage, till such
time as a Bridge might be prepared: and he so well placed his Cannon and
Muskets upon the Flanks of the enemy, that Tilly who marched thitherward in
Person to hinder the Passage, had not the fortune, either to beat the Swedes
out of the Island, or to hinder them for making their Bridge; for his shot did
little avail him, the Swedes being fenced by the point of the Island.
Whereupon Tilly knowing the importance of the affair, and the great
difficulty, made a fierce and bloody skirmish amidst the waters, which on the
other side of the River might easily be waded over, for it came not to above a
man's middle; but at last the Swedes prevailing, who encouraged by the coming
of their King, strove who should first throw themselves upon the Bridge, they
got unto the other Bank notwithstanding all the enemy could do; there were
slain of the Roman Catholics side about 2000, and Tilly himself being hurt
with a shot from a Sachar, dyed within three days. Count Aldringer was
likewise here hurt in the head, whereof he was afterward healed; and the
Imperialists, after a long and bloody Battle were forced to retreat: this
Battle continued for the space of six whole hours* and so great was the hail
of Cannon and Musket Shot, as many Soldiers who had been in diverse other well
fought actions affirmed, that this in their opinion was to be numbered amongst
the bloudiest that they ever saw; it happened on the Twenty second day of
March. March, 22.


The Duke of Bavaria was no less troubled at this misfortune, then at the
death of Tilly, a Commander of tried valor and of great experience: nor was
his death any whit less lamented by the Emperous self, and those other
temporal Princes who well knew his wisdom, constancy, watchful diligence,
and choice wit. His descent was not great amongst the Wallones; In his youth
with continued patience, persevering in the duties of a private Soldier, and
by his peculiar valor, working himself by degrees from one preferment to
another, he at last to his great glory, to the satisfaction of his Princes, and
to the great advantage of the Roman Religion, arived at the honor of being
supreme Commander of the Armies of the Roman Catholic League, wherein he
behaved himself so wisely and with such courage, as being victour in many
field Battles, and vanquisher of many people, he deservedly merits to be
numbered in the first rank of the famous Commanders of our time: he was of a
middle stature, of a strong complexion, and of a martiall-like agillity,
preserving even in his gray headed years, a youth-like bodily strength: he was
zealous in the service of his Princes, and a very great defender of the Roman
Catholic Religion; for he was often heard to say, he would rather run hazard
of his life, then shun the occasion of well doing; his devotion in all his
actions was admirable; he never went about any action, before he had humbly on
his knees begged of God, that the event might be answerable to his divine will:
it is said that if a man may live a Religious life in war, he did so. All the
works of this General were commended by the Soldier, and admired by the
people; his very enemies not undervalluing him. The only thing that might fully
his pious fame, was the cruelty and barbarousnesse committed by his Soldiers
at the taking of Newbrandeburg, and Magdeburg, which was such, as the Romanists
themselves were scandalized at the report thereof; many were of opinion, that
this his want of compassion cried for vengeance from God Almighty, who is not
pleased with cruelty though exercised against Infidels and Barbarians; and that
the chastisement which uses to fall upon wise men, to wit, the infatuation of
their wisdom, happened unto him, for that moderation, for which in all his
other actions he was admired, being suffocated by his too great daring, he came
presumptuously to the Battle of Leipsick, which was the break neck of all his
glories; for had he therein carried himself according to his wonted wariness,
many are of opinion he could not have missed the glory of happy success; and
for that one misfortune treads in the heels of an other, as though he had been
unwilling to out live this loss, he ended his life in the bosom of glory,
writing in Characters of his own blood to posterity, his eternity of merits
from the Duke of Bavaria, and pointing out unto them the way which leads
generous minds to immortallity. In Walesteines Court his death seemed rather
to cause joy then sorrow, and this, for that all Courtiers, fawning or frowning
as do their Lords, their Masters, knew that Walestein envying this warriers
good conditions, and the renown which by the Victories in so many Battles he
had won, loved not to see this great tree over-shadow the branches of his
ambition; and the occasion hereof was, for that it is impossible for him to love
the Servant that hates the Master; so Walesteine not caring for the Duke of
Bavaria, as suspecting that it was he who had persuaded the Emperor to take
from him his former place and make use of Tilly, who was thought to be fitter
then he for so great an employment, did no less despise and emulate the
actions of the servant, then those of the Master.

The Duke of Bavaria not thinking himself safe now in Monaco, the place of his
residence, which was only walled about with old walls, conveyed speedily all his
most precious movables to Saltsborg, belonging to the Archbishop thereof, an
Ecclesiastical Prince, and one of the most potent and richest of all Germany;
this City is seated in a pleasant Country upon the River Zalza, a Town lately
fortifyed with two Castles upon two hills which command the River on both sides:
he with the remainder of his Army did wisely retire himself to Ratisbone or
Regenspurg, intending to secure that place, and to keep himself there; for the
loss thereof would not be a little prejudicial to him, it standing in the
heart of his territories* but this being a free City, and no less privileged
then the other Hauns Towns, and a good part of the Garrison thereof being
Protestants, was by reason of the Swedes so many victories very unwilling to
declare it self; it did not therefore condescend to the entertaining of the
Bavarians, who had declared themselves enemies to the King, lest thereby they
might pull the war upon them, and by declaring themselves friends to Bavaria,
publish themselves enemies to the Swedes, who were not far off with their
conquering Army; they therefore in a fair manner desired to be excused by the
Duke if they did not what he required of them; and that he might not be jealous
of their loyalty, they promise to stand newters, and not to furnish the King
with any thing, save what they could not choose but grant him. But the Duke
knew, that if the Swedes should possess themselves of that City (which they
might easily do) they would not only hinder the joining of the lower
Palatinate with Walesteine, but would again open the passage for their inrodes
into the rest of Bavaria, to the no little prejudice of Ingolstat, the which
being in the midst of the enemies Forts, ran danger of either being surprised
by treachery, or enforced by some onset to lean toward the Swedes, which
would be the total ruin of Bavaria, since it was the strongest key which
shuts and opens the way to all foreign invasions: so as since neither by his
persuasions, nor by his promises, he could get them to open their gates, he
resolved to try his wit; to which purpose holding intelligence by the means of
a Lieutenant of Lorreyne called Monseiur D'Erbois, with some Citizens and other
Chiefes of the Country people of those parts, who had withdrawn themselves
thither for fear of the Swedes, he agreed with them that the Court de Guard of
the Gates being oftentimes by these men doubled, they should upon a night
concluded on between them, and at which time they should have the custody of
the Gate that opens toward Monaco, open the Gate and let him in. The bargain
was made and the desired end had: for the Count de Gratz who then commanded in
Chief all the Dukes Forces, sent 500 Horse and 2000 Foot thither in May, May.
who being let in, forced the Magistrates thereof, though much against their
will, to receive the Dukes Laws.

This was the condition of the war, and these were the proceedings of the one
and the other party; the King not failing to prosecute his good fortune, nor
the Austrians to fence those blows which thundered upon them. When the four
months time being expired, wherein Walesteine had in some good sort
reinforced the Army, and put all things in order for his going into the field,
the Court at Vienna seemed to be much appaid with the proceedings of so gallant
a Commander, who had given so good a beginning to the resolutions which was
conceived and hoped for, from his being General; but having some whimsie, were
it either that he desired to be entreated, and to sell his service at a dear
rate, or the more to advantage his employment, or out of some other extravagant
and Capricious opinion, whereof he wanted not good store, he was heard to say,
that not accepting of the Generals place, he was content to enjoy the repute of
being a good Servant to his Caesarian Majesty, and that he had made himself
known to be so. 'Twas therefore resolved that Prince Ecchenberg, and the Abbot
of Cremismister Bishop of Vienna should again be sent unto him, to work him
to accept of the absolute Command of the Emperors Forces: together with these,
the Spaniards sent likewise Father Chiroga a Capuchen, a great wit, and who in
his time was a wise Commander, to offer him 50000 Dollars a month in the name
of the King of Spain, for maintenance of the Army, instead of the men that
were promised and raised in the Low-Countryes, which they now stood in need of
in Flanders, to oppose the great Army of the Hollanders, which were upon their
march to take Maestricht. This man's proffers and the others prayers, made him
give way to their alleged reasons, which were used more to flatter him, and
to satisfy him, then that the business required it: for he much more desired
the place, then the Emperor did to confer it upon him; nay indeed, he feared
to be excluded from it, by the well grounded reasons, which the Spanish
Ministers of State offered, which were always averse to such a resolution as
to confer that authority upon him, the half whereof might have contented
him: but necessity which is the glass that dasels the eyes of the interest of
States, showed not the blurre that was in the forehead of this expedition.

And for that Walesteine knew, that in former times the greatest part of what
had been won in war, and by the sweat of the Soldier, had been conferred
to the great dislike of the Soldier upon such as had never been of that
profession; pretending hereby to be favorable to the Soldier, whose good
liking he ambitiously coveted, he stood not only to be declared General
Independent, of all the Emperors and King of Spaines Forces in Germany, but to
have a great stroke in the disposing of such goods as should be gotten; and
therewithal at his pleasure to remunerate such as by their valor should have
best deserved: a thought which rather arose from his desire of obliging the
Soldier unto him, then out of any worthy cause which might incline him to it.
He likewise desired, that no peace might be at any time treated of without his
privity; he demanded to have these and some other articles subscribed, which
though by reason of the urgent necessity were granted unto him, as likewise by
the Counsels of some Lords who gloried much in declaring themselves to be
partial on his side, upon whose greatness they grounded high hopes; yet could
not the faithful Austrians, and in particular the sincere Spaniards, who are
true lovers of their Masters greatness, forbear to murmr at the conferring
of so great a power; and though they seemed outwardly to be pleased, yet were
they much troubled, that they must confide in one whom formerly they had
declared themselves to be diffident of, and of whom they ceased not yet to be
jealous; as likewise that the Servant should be possessed of the Masters
authority. They said, that certainly Germany was very poor, if it had none
other fit for the managing of such an Army; and what would become of them if he
were not there? many such things as these they muttered; above all it was very
hard to tolerate him, who growing every hour more ambitious, seemed to be
offended with that employment, which of right he should have petitioned for;
and treated arrogantly with those, to whom in all respects he ought to have
humbled himself; which showed that by degrees he would pretend to give Laws
to Caesar's self, and all his Council. The Spaniards not well disgesting these
things, and much offended with this General, could not free themselves of the
distaste wherewith they were totally possessed.

The news of this man's being made General did much rejoice the common people,
who incapable of the high mysteries of policy, feed themselves with such hopes*
as suit best with their desires, seeming now almost to have lost all fear of
sinister events. Thus every one out of their opinion of the witty
extravagancies of this Commander, built Castles in the air, and prognosticated
such events as did better become a better genius: in particular many
Counselors and Ministers of state look cheerfully hereupon, who had received
much Gold from Walesteine, thinking that he continuing in his Command, they
should be advanced to greater honors, credit, and authority. And to say truth,
Walesteine brought businesses to a good pass, in that so narrow and
threatening a time, wherein fortune would peradventure have been more sparing
to others; and if as he was wonderful ingenious, and in all his actions
exceeding acute, and diligent, he had been endued with the virtue wherewith now
adays few men are, of knowing himself, and resisting his own affections by
moderating his extravagancies, and suppressing his pride, he would not only
have won the love of his Lord and Master, (one of the most magnanimous,
religious, and merciful Princes, that ever governed the Empire) but would have
brought even his competitors and enemies to have partaken of his service.

Where Force availes not, it is good to have recourse to policy; an many times
those things are brought to pass by wit, which were dispaired of by power;
Therefore Walesteine being a great Politician, and a wise negotiator, knowing
that he wanted such Forces as he could have desired, to encounter with an Army
already inheartened by so many victories, and inrich't with Soldiers, whilst
all men flock to those Colors which are favored by good success, exercised
his wit, how he might withdraw the Kings confederates from siding with him:
good correspondency was held between him and the Duke of Saxony, whilst he
waged war against the King of Denmark; and the Elector did in effect show
himself mindful of many favors which he had received from him then, when he
Commanded in Chief the Caesarian Forces; for at the taking of Prage, he kept
Walesteines well furnished Palace, and all things belonging unto him, from being
injured by the Soldiers; yet it was rumor'd that he did not this by the way of
friendship, but out of Policy; to the end that by this way of partial
proceeding, the Emperor and his Court might have some jealousy of Walesteine;
as likewise for that Harnem, who was trained up in war by Walesteine,
commanded in Chief the Dukes Forces, keeping in memory the good discourses
that had past between them; he was hereunto likewise persuaded by the means of
a certain letter, written by the King somewhat too sharply to the Elector,
wherein he blamed him of negligence in not advancing (whilst he was victorious
in Bohemia) into Moravia, yea, even to the Danube, were it only to hinder the
new levies of men, which were made by the Emperors Officers in those parts.
Walesteine laid this for his ground rule, that if he could remove this one
Prince from his union with the King, not only the Hauns Towns, but the
greatest part of the chief men of the Empire would follow his example; a
business of such importance, as it would not only have made plain the way to
his designs, of beating back the King, of establishing his own greatness in
Germany, and of punishing his competitors: but finally he would have reduced
the Army to his own secret intent; which Army he wisely endeavored to make
depend on him, by conferring places and employments only upon such as were
affectionate to him. He bent his whole endeavors to effect this; and though he
might first have regained Prage, yet went he not about it; but persevering in
the satisfaction he had received from the Elector, he by the means of Count
Adam Tersica, propounded a treaty of peace with Harnem, whereunto he by many
promises invited him. But were it either to win time, and afford the King
scope enough to effect his desires in Bavaria and Swabenland, or that the Duke
was not yet in condition to purchase his peace with the Emperor, upon so good
terms as he desired, or else for fear of the Swedes, he prolonged the
negotiation, asking such things as were not to be granted him. Walesteine
thought himself now in the Haven, and believed the more therein, for that he
was more and more aware how the Saxons apprehending the Swedes growing to
excessive greatness, did delay the taking of those places, which had they been
solicitous they might have gotten, which showed they might easily be brought to
disagreement; since Princes are not pleased with their neighbors too much
greatness, as likewise that by judicial Astrology, (which he studied very
much, spending every day some time in it, and keeping always some famous
Astrologers about him) he found out some Star which showed to be propitious
unto him; he therefore bent himself wholly hereupon, and went about to bribe
Harnem and other of the Dukes Ministers of state and Officers by rich gifts.

The Treaty was by all means endeavored to be brought to a conclusion, and
Walesteine this mean while kept himself in Moravia, that he might not by the
moving of his Forces give jealousy to the Saxons, who having (as it may be
said) forgotten war, enjoyed the delights of peace, where they were quartered
in Bohemia. Many were of opinion, that the Electour did this to afford
Walesteine time to secure the Emperors patrimoniall estate, against the
Swedes, whose proceedings were by this time grown to an high eminency, as the
Princes of the Empire ought rather to have desired them moderated, then foment
them yet to a greater height; as also not to disturb the business which was
fairly proceeded in with Harnem: when at the same time the League was openly
ratified in Court, between the Duke of Bavaria, and the house of Austria, the
Duke having formerly been somewhat doubtful therein. This was attributed to
the distaste the Duke took, to see Walesteine reassumed to the Generals
place, contrary to the good rule of government, which teaches no more to trust
in him, by whom we have once thought our selves offended; fearing perhaps lest
he likewise might receive some prejudice by the ambition of Walesteine, who did
not much affect the Dukes person: others would mutter, that this was occasioned
by the promises of the French, who would have brought him to conformity with
Swethland; and at the same time his highnesse's demand of succor was
propounded to Walesteine, who after having first suffered himself to be much
entreated thereunto, (so very vainglorious was he) to boot with sending
Aldringer to join with the said Duke, he likewise sent him for his
re-inforcement, the Horse of the Grand Prior Aldobrandini, of the young
Colloredo, of Maracini, and one Regiment of Isolini his Crabats; commanding
them notwithstanding not to make too much haste, either for that he desired
Bavaria should be totally ruinated, or for that if the Bavarians should have
the better, the glory might not be attributed to them, (which he alone coveted)
or for that he liked not his men should be consumed so far from where he
commanded; for being only intent how to effect his own designs with ease, he
cared not upon what disadvantage he put others, the works of a proud and
cruel man.

The Duke of Bavaria kept with his Army about Ratisbone, soliciting speedy
succor from Walesteine; who notwithstanding being hardly hereunto moved,
alleged for his excuse, the news of some good hopes he had of making peace
with Saxony; still feeding Bavaria with hopes nevertheless* when at last he
perceived that Harnems fair words, though solid in circumstances, and of good
appearance, brought not any thing to maturity; and that the King still
advanced, insomuch as having made himself master of Bavaria, he might easily
arear Austria, a sign that he might compass his designs, not only by his
numerous Forces, but likewise by the assistance he expected from the ill
affected Inhabitants of Austria, about Lintz, who were much unsatisfied with
the Emperors government, and who when the King should draw near them, would
doubtlesly declare themselves, and would side with the Swedes; the privileges
and franchise of many Cities of the Empire, being envied by many other Towns,
which though they neighbor upon them, are yet in subjection, does awake in
them likewise a desire to enjoy the like liberty, and not to appear inferior
to the others; whence arises that whilst they hope to make good their
resolutions, they fear not to put them in execution; and this has been the
cause why the peoples evil disposition, and the difference of Religion, have
more prejudicated the Austrian power then the invasion of the enemy. Walesteine
then resolved to advance with his Forces, as well to shun men's murmering at his
so long delay, and to go into Bohemia, there to effect peace by his weapons,
since words, gifts, and promises, had not been of force enough to obviat the
difficulties met withal in the negotiation; as likewise to recover Prage, a
thing which the Spaniards much desired, who the better to authorize their
advise; had designed to bring thither the King of Hungary, and his Queen, and
they would have done it, by reason of their far distance from Vienna, there
being no small emulation between them and the German Lords, who being much
troubled that the Spanish Courtiers who came with the Queen should be admitted
to serve, contrary (as they said) to all form anciently used, and which was
almost become a Law, That a Prince should have no servants placed about him,
save such as are of his own Country, and subjects to him, they attested that
strangers were not to be admitted in a Court, to have equal authority with
those of the Nation, which they had by all means endeavored, and by their
moneys purchased. April.
He in the Month of April went from Lenam, and took his way toward Pilsen in
Bohemia, where Galasse then quartered; he from thence dispatched expresses
into Slesia, Austria, and wheresoever else any of the Emperors Forces were,
that they should all march toward him; the which being done, he mustered his
men in less then twenty days near Pilsen, and found them to be above 30000
Soldiers.

On the other side, the King of Swethland; who did not let time run uselesly
away, having brought his Forces before Auspurg the 10th of April, April. 10.
made himself Master thereof with less difficulty then did the Duke of
Bavaria, when he brought in his 2000 Foot, and 200 Horse: For the people being
many, and the greatest part of them Protestants, they said they would not take
up Arms against a King who was their friend, and of the same Religion, and the
Roman Catholic Garrison not being of it self able to defend the walls, and
fence themselves from the Citizens, the Town and King shook hands at first
sight. Auspurg is seated in the noble Province of Swabenland, between the
Rivers Vertech and Lech upon the Confines of Bavaria, and between Tirold and
the Danube, in a most pleasant Country, it is a Hauns Town, one of the
fairest and richest of all Germany, of a large circuit and full of people, all
given to merchandising; it is not very strong, as being fortified after the
ancient manner; yet in respect of the situation and of the number of Citizens,
it may be reckoned amongst the good Cities of Germany. The King by staying some
days in this City, (all which time he entertained himself in sports,
Invitations and Feasts, and particularly in playing at Ballowne, at which he
himself played) seemed (as it was spoken of by diverse) to have laid aside the
gallantry of his mind, and to have delighted himself in the sweetes of
pleasure: he notwithstanding changed these conceits, and made it be known,
that though he knew how to emulate Hanniball in victories, yet did not he
imitate him in the flatteries of Capua: 'twas known he endeavored by keeping
himself a while quiet, to obtain that, which he could not hope for by much
labor; and if the event was not good, the fault lay in them that received the
directions, not in him that gave them. He during this leisure-time, held
intelligence with Fornespech, a Colonel of Foot of the Army of the League, who
had formerly served in Prusia against the Polacks, and had agreed with him upon
a certain time, to be let into the Fort of Ingolstat, wherein his Regiment was
quartred: The King believing by this man's treachery, to make himself Master
of so important a place, parted unlooked for from Auspurg, and with his Army
consisting of 14000 soldiers, came on the twentieth of April to Dunawert; April
20.
where faigning to pass over the Danube, and go toward Franconia, he did
unexpectedly come before Ingolstat; the Governor whereof having some suspicion
of the said Fornespech, (for treachery which is displeasing to God, betrays it
self* did not only change his men from their Quarters, but setting a Guard upon
the Colonells self and his Officers, he doubled the Guards, planted the Cannon
upon the walls, and tacitly expected the coming of the Swedes, who having
stolen privately into the ditches, and fitted their Ladders to the appointed
places, where they thought to have this Colonels men keeping the Guard, they
were received with so great a Tempest of Cannon and Musket Shot, which made
such havocke amongst the soldiers, and some of the Captains, (who desirous of
such an enterprise, and being courageous and lovers of glory, ran thither where
their life was most endangered,) as they were enforced to fall back into the
ditches, and retire: And the King himself who was lighted off horseback,
encouraging those who yet remained to scale the walls again, and exercising
himself in all the duties of a bold spirit, which is oftentimes seconded by
fortune, had like to have run danger of his life there: for his Horses shoulder
was shot off there with a Cannon bullet, whose skin was afterward hung up in
the Cathedral Church of that City as a memorial thereof. The King adventuring
his life upon this occasion, as likewise in many others, afforded much
discourse to the Soldiers and Commanders, by whom being humbly entreated that
he would have a greater care of his own person, he with a pleasing countenance
answered a Minister who exhorted him thereunto; That a King who puts himself
in Arms must not dream of Court-delights and safety; that death ought always
then to be esteemed dear, and cherished, when it gives life to honor, and is
advantageous to the public; that Masters commands are never better obeyed
then in their own presence. Having after this stayed some days about the
City, he resolved to leave certain Regiments there to hinder the Garrison from
making such sallies as they might do upon his neighboring Quarters: and that
he might linger no longer before a Fort, the situation whereof gave him no hopes
of effecting his desire, he marched with his Army toward Landshut, a place of
some moment in Bavaria, seated upon the River Iser in the bosom of the two
Rivers, Danube and Inn, which not being prepared for defense, and having in it
a timorous people, yielded it self at the first Cannot shot. And after this,
having taken Morsperg not far from the mouth of Iser and Amber, he came
before Monaco, the Metropolis of Bavaria, and the Dukes Seat; a fair and great
City but weakly fenced; the Magistrate whereof finding himself not in a
condition to contest, sent twelve of the chief of the City to throw themselves
before the Kings feet, and to desire a treaty for suspension of Arms; but this
being by the King denied, who would not receive it upon any other terms then
upon discretion, it behoved him at last to do as was desired: And the King not
having forgot the blood that was shed by Tillies men at Magdeburg, where the
Inhabitants were almost all put to the sword, and their houses burnt; And this
being attributed to the Bavarians, though (as it has been said) it fell out by
reason of the fire which took in a Drugsters house; the King I say taking
occasion under this pretense to make the misfortunes of war seem less
terrible to those people, February.
who not having till now made any trial thereof, could not well digest them;
and that he might have an occasion to make himself be esteemed merciful, and
consequently their evils appear less to these Citizens (for a mischief
though great, becomes a consolation, when thereby a greater, which is near at
hand, is prevented) he commanded, that in revenge of the aforesaid slaughter at
Magdeburg, Monaco should be set on fire; the which the Citizens having notice
of, and all of them striving who should first throw themselves before the Kings
feet, they begged pardon of him, alleging they were not in any blame of what
the Soldiers had mischievously done, for that their whole life was spent in
traffic and civil affairs: at these lamentations and tears the King
suffered himself soon to be entreated, his intentions being not to ruinate
and destroy, but to preserve and restore; he recalled his direction, nor was
there any fire seen but in Kitchens, to make good cheer for the Soldiers; and
in the Minthouse where 12000 l. in money was coined to bestow as a donative or
contribution upon the Soldier. Many religious people came likewise before the
King to entreat safety of him; for being more than others enemies to the
Protestants, they feared to be more injured then others by them; yet were they
better received then they imagined; and in particular the Capuchins were better
satisfied then the rest: for the King caused some Alms to be given them, and
commended their Religion and life, as honest and good; and though one of them
had the boldness to reprehend him of the error wherein he lived, and to
exhort him to acknowledge the Roman Church, as other his forefathers had done,
he seemed not to be offended at him, but to make good esteem of him.

Walesteines arrival at Pilsen with so great an Army, governed by so brave
Commanders, and so well provided with all things necessary, did not only amuse
the King but all the Protestants, who thought the Austrians would never have
been able to have assembled so many people in so short a time; but above all it
troubled the State of Nurenberg, who by its declaring it self in the behalf
of the Swedes, was disobedient to the Imperialists; and the riches thereof
provoked the Soldier to think upon revenge: they therefore hoping in some
sort to allay the ill will the Austrians might bear them, by sending to
collogue with Walesteine, acknowledging him to be the Emperors General, and
acquainting him with the reasons which moved them to declare themselves friends
to the Swedes, those four Commissioners who came to Pilsen in the beginning of
May, May.
to congratulate the said General; but they met with so strange an
entertainment, as well showed how capricious the giver thereof was; for at
their arivall Walesteine gave order that they should be met in great Pomp, as
Ambassadors of the greatest Princes of Germany; that they should be discharged
at the public cost, and received with such honor as is wont to be used at
public magnificencies: he afterward put off their audience for six days,
and at last when they came before him with their letters of credence which they
presented him withal, thereby expounding their Embassy, he welcomming them in
all honorable manner, and receiving them with much appearing courtesy,
received the letter from their hands, which before he had read throughout, he
answered; he was very well informed of their Embassy, that he would come
himself in person to give them his Answer, and that he should then know,
whither the effects were answerable to the handsome expressions of their
letter; and so without more Complement dismissed them. Whereat the Commissioners
being much perplexed, much made on by all, and better attended then before,
returned home. The Novelty hereof being known in the Camp, and in the Court,
past not without some curious discussions; some thought that Walesteine had
done a memorable act, and that he could not do better; they said such were not
to be pardoned who driven thereunto by fear, beg it, but that they deserved
punishment, who had forsaken their formerly sworn allegiance; and that
chastisement was the true looking-glass for wicked men: from thence he
dispatched away Colonel Spor a confident friend of Harnems, and made 50000
Dollers be delivered out unto him, and other Regalities, thereby to dazzle the
eyes of such difficulties as he should meet withal, and to reassume the new
Treaty of this accommodation, wherewithal he was much troubled by breaking off
the diversion of this peace, his ends being to remain himself alone the sole
Commander of all the Emperors Forces in Germany against the Swedes; but the
Treaty being prolonged and nothing therein concluded he determined to march
forward; he therefore mustered his Army at Raconick, a place between Pilsen
and Prage, wherein he found 214 Cornets of Horse, all well in order, 120
Companies of Foot, 44 pieces of Cannon, and two thousand Carriages well
furnished; and having his head full of whimsies, and being a great observer of
punctuality, he would here make known his Commands how he intended to be
served: he ordained that every one should wear a red Scarf, forbidding all
other Colors upon pain of life, (for he could not punish any the smalest
fault, but either by the Gallows or by the Pillory.) I cannot herein pass by
an accident, which befell a Captain of the Artillery, who having upon him a
rich Scarf embroydered with Gold, when he first heard this order, tore it from
about his neck, and treading it under his feet, showed his ready inclination
to obey his Commands; wherewithal the General being well pleased, he received
such reward as is used to proceed from satisfaction; for he was soon after
made a Colonel, taken into his good opinion, and made his Copartner. By this
example he made the rest readier to serve him, as having means to oblige them
unto him: and the more to secure his own Command, and holding it a good rule in
policy, to keep his Soldiers and Officers in obedience, he gave Command under
pain of his displeasure, that no Soldier, Captain, Officer, or Colonel
whatsoever of Foot, should wear any boots or spurs; as on the contrary he
forbad the Horse Soldiers and Officers to go at any time without them: he
imposed such punctual silence in his Court, and more particularly about his
own lodgings, as he would not have one thereabouts raise their voices higher
then he would do if he were in a Church, which was duly observed by all, yea
of the chiefest Commanders; and this respect given unto him was grown unto that
hight, that lest they should make a noise with the rowels of their spurs,
they fastened them with little buckles. It Is said he did this that he might be
the more dreaded, for he was so over-Mastered with ambition, as that no Prince
in our age was ever known to covet so much respect, or to have it observed
toward him, as this man did and had. He having given these and other
directions to his Army, boldly came before Prage, and the very first night
surrounded it with his Horse, commanding Gallasse to set upon it on the side of
Mount St. Laurence, and the Marquess of Grana on the Capuchins side. Gallasse
upon the break of day played upon the Walls with eight piece of Cannon, whereby
in a short time a breach being made (the Walls being but old and weak) a certain
hour was appointed to give the assault, but the Soldiers of Count Bartaldoe
Wallesteines Regiment at the first making of the breach, before the hour
appointed for entrance was come, without any directions from the General,
being desirous to show their courage, (and thereby to purchase such reward from
Walesteine, as he used to bestow upon the valliant,) fell with such violence
upon the breach, as they by maine force won it, and without any withstanding
entered the City; for the Saxons knowing it impossible to defend so weak walls,
had withdrawn themselves into the Palace Royal, which commands the little
City; the Marquess of Grana did the like on the other side, so as the Saxons
dispairing of defense resolved to parle, the which Walesteine being acquainted
withal, he gave the charge of the Treaty to the said Marquess, as being very
fit for that employment, who did manage it with great advantage, and concluded
it with honor; obliging the besieged to come forth of the Town, barely with
the safety of their lives: but Walesteine were it either that he would overcome
the Elector of Saxony with courtesy, and so sweeten any difficulties that
might hinder the accommodation, or else to requite the honor he received, in
having his Palace kept in that City untouched, gave the Soldiers their Arms,
and moreover their Baggage; (which being the most part booty, they had formerly
got, was worth about 100000 Dollers) and made them all, (who were about 4000)
be safely conducted to Letomeritz, where the Saxon Army was quartered. The
Imperialists Soldiers at their entry sacked that part which is called
Ofeinstat, or the little City, at which the Popish Inhabitants murmured; since
that the new and old City, inhabited for the most part by Protestants, and
Jews, by the Contribution of certain moneys kept themselves from the
insolency of the Soldiers, the like would notwithstanding have befallen them,
if the Town had been set upon on their side; and if the Soldiers could have
entered therein by force, but their walls and the River saved them, and afforded
them time to make agreement. Prage is in the Kingdom of Bohemia, whereof it is
the Metropolis, it is a large and lovely City, divided into three parts, two of
them on this side Molda called the new and old City, and the other on the back
of the Mount St. Laurence, called the little City; this City formerly in
peaceful times was full of people, and had in it store of strangers, for that
many Emperors had kept their Court there: the Walls are of brick after the
ancient manner; it is not defenceable against an enemies Army, unless it be
defended by another Army without. Here Walesteine resolved to stay some time,
as well to agree what he should next go about, as to reassume the Treaty of
peace.

The taking of Prage and other Towns in Bohemia did not more rejoice the
Imperialists, then it did Walesteine's self; who thinking it would be a
sufficient argument to persuade the Elector to conclude a peace, upon which his
mind was wholly bent; he resolved to send again to Harnem, who was in
Letomeritz, a City lying upon the Elb, on the Confines of Bohemia toward
Saxony, and where the Electors Forces then were, observing the Imperialists
proceedings, and to desire him to put a good end to the peace that was
propounded; he accompanied this message with new offers and promises, which
though they were very efficacious, yet were they not sufficient to draw the
Elector into his trap; but the Treaty did every day seem farther off then
other: Walesteine therefore marched again with his Army, resolving upon the
Electors utter ruin: and Egra remaining on the part toward the Palatinat,
near the River Ros^a, as also Elnbogen, a Town upon the side of the River
Eger, in the uttermost parts of Bohemia, both of them (by reason of their
situation) considerable places, he about the midst of May dispatched away
Holca, Sergeant Major General of the Battle, May.
with certain Forces to take them in, the which he easily did; for they wanted
Munition and other things, fitting to defend themselves against so great an
Army. Walesteines self marched toward Letomerits, and finding the Saxons
removed from thence, he passed over the Elb, and made a hault about Melnick, a
walled Town upon the same River; where after many skirmishes had past between
his Crabats and the Saxon Horse, (wherein the Saxons came off always with the
worst,) he again propounded the Treaty of agreement with the Duke, and seemed
much grieved at the delay, for that the total ruin of the Swedes depended
upon this peace. For the Frontiers of Bohemia being secured on this side, and
the Soldiers who did defend those Frontiers being joined to his men, and his
Army doubled by the Electours Forces, he would not only have exceeded the
Swedes in numbers, sufficient to drive him out of the field, but consequently
the greatest part of the Princes of the Empire, who were in League with the
King, following such an example, might take such courses as they should think
fittest for them.

He again sent Colonel Spor with new donatives, and larger offers, who
though he used his best discretion in mannaging the affair, yet was he as
formerly entertained, only with words and complements, so as he dispaired of
effects: for the King being advertised of Walesteines proceedings, and how he
intended to invade Saxony, which he had promised as a reward unto his
Soldiers; and fearing lest the Elector being pursued by the Austrians, might
find some pretense to break his word, and comply with the Emperor, (which
would have been much to his prejudice) was already parted from Bavaria, and
was come with all his Army near Nurenberg, resolving to set upon the
Imperialists both Flank and Back, when they should be engaged in Misna or
Saxony.

June. 8.
The King marched on the eighth of June to Dunawert, with 8000 Horse, and 14000
Foot, 60 piece of Cannon, and with a well furnished Baggage, leaving the
Mashall Bannier behind him, who after the taking of Magdeburg, being retired
into Swabenland waited upon the Bavarians, and did all he could to hinder their
attempts, as likewise the attempts of other Soldiers that were raised in
Tirroll; and he sent Duke Weimar toward Swabenland to take in Lindow, a
considerable place upon Lake of Costantz, on the Confines of Helvetia and
Tiroll, which being a Peninsula, and environed with strong Bulwarks, and Walls
after the modern fashion, is accounted for one of strongest places in all
Germany. This might have easily been effected, had not the design been
discovered; for Weymar having made 2000 of his Foot descend a steep and craggy
mountain, with hooks of iron underneath their feet to keep them from tumbling
down, whilst they thought to have surprised the Town, and have effected their
design, they found the Imperialists acquainted with their intentions, and with
their weapons in their hands, by whom they were valiantly, and with their no
little loss repulsed. Weymar perceiving this undertaking to be vain, faced
about to Mimmingen, the chief Town in Swabenland, numbered amongst the Hauns
Towns in Germany, placed in a fruitful Country, and watered by a little
stream of Isler; and having brought his Army before it, and raised his
batteries, the Garrison and Citizens believing that they had done what became
their loyalties, he got the Town upon agreement that they should be suffered
to go out with their Arms and baggadge, and their liberty of conscience to be
preserved to them. By the winning of this place (though of no great moment) the
Swedes were to receive great advantage: for it being a very fruitful Country,
and therefore convenient to refresh their Army, not only by depriving the
Austrians thereof, but by thereby accommodating themselves, it would be very
beneficial to them and prejudicial to their enemies; and it fell out that by
getting footing in these parts, Wirtenberg being surrounded, the Duke thereof
would easily be brought to an agreement with the Swedes, when he should see the
Caesarians far from him, whereby the profit would be considerable in respect
of the taking in of Alsatia contiguous to this State.

Walesteine understanding the Kings removal, and fearing lest if he should
advance further into Saxony, the King might easily hinder his return, or else
reduce him upon some disadvantage to be undone by famine or by Battle,
entertaining himself on this side the Elb, he marched toward Egra, as well
that he might join himself with the Duke of Bavaria, and together with him
defend the upper Palatinat, and that part of Bohemia from being invaded by the
Swedes, as to try some other enterprise, leaving Don Baltisar de Mafredas with
8000 soldiers at Letomeritz, to hinder any alteration which in his absence
Harnem might endeavor*

Whilst these parties floated thus up and down in Bohemia, the Landsgrave of
Hessen opposing himself to Pappenhaime, some of his Troops had ill success,
for fighting with some other Caesarian Troops about Wolfembuttell; they were
ill dealt withal, and the Landsgrave himself was forced to retire to
Gottingen, a Town between the two Rivers of Ruma and Verra: whereupon
Pappenheim making incursions even unto Northeim by the side of the River Helm,
belonging to the jurisdiction of the County of Hobensteime, did without any
obstacle make himself Master of the Castle, putting them that there kept it to
the sword; whose example taught some Cities thereabouts, and amongst the rest,
Gos^ar, a Town standing near the River Onnare, betwixt Halberstat, Hedelsein,
and Lunenburg, to demand Garrisons of the Swedish Generals to secure themselves
from the said Pappenheim; who wholly intent upon the glory of War, and upon
the Emperors service, with a great deal of boldness, though but with small
Forces kept about the circuit of the Rivers of W^sser and Elb, Provinces of
great consideration, for the interest of both parties: For many Ecclesiastical
Principalities lying therein, if for want of being sustained by the Austrians,
they should fall into the Protestants hands, (to boot with the loss of a rich
and opulent Country, whereby the way was opened to greater Conquests,) the
enemies party growing stronger, and all the adjacent Protestant Princes and
great men freed from the fear of the Emperors Forces, and discovering their
dislike of the Papists, it would without doubt redound much to the prejudice of
the Popish jurisdictions; for the Landsgraves Army being augmented by the
forces of that Country, he being a spritful Prince and inclined to War, having
in a short space either subdued the Ecclesiastickes of those parts, or brought
them to a prejudicial agreement, he would without any other impediment have
brought his Army into the Emperors own patrimoniall Territories, and those of
his confederates. Tod Marshall of the Field, who had raised the body of an Army
in those parts for the Kings service, was not now idle for setting upon
Boxtchude, which is seated upon the banks of that River not far from the Elb,
betwixt the State of Bremer, and the Dukedom of Lunenburg, and playing upon it
incessantly with two Batteries, he in twelve days space brought the Imperial
Garrison which defended it, to parley, and to surrender the Town, upon
condition that they should march out with their Colors flying, Drums beating,
and Matches lighted; yet the greatest part of them willingly entered themselves
into the Kings service, who (as is usual amongst mercinary men) intending
their particular gain had no regard unto their faith, nor honor, but thought
to speed better under those (then fortunate) Colors, then under those of the
Emperor, which were then successful.

Whilst these things went thus on, Aldringer was informed of the Kings being
marched toward the upper Palatinat, and of his going toward Nurenberg,
wherefore in obedience to Walesteines orders he rose with his Army from before
Ratisbone, that he might join with him, since any longer abode there might
have made much to his prejudice: for the Swedes getting further footing in the
Palatinate, and thereby hindering his joining with Walesteine, and consequently
injoyning the benefit of the Field, the Roman Catholics would be removed from
their attempt upon Nurenberg: moreover, since it behoved the Bavarians to tarry
in their own Territories beyond the Danube, for that the other part wanted
Forradge, the Swedes might the easier prejudice the Imperial Army; so as
fearing lost he might be hindered in his march by the Swedes, he hastened his
pace, coasting along Newcost, Amburg, and Weiden, places walled about after the
ancient manner, yet chief Towns in the upper Palatinat.

The King being come to Nurenberg, and hearing that Aldringer was come to
Weiden, and that Walesteine was coming thitherwards, thought it were fitting
to hinder the joining of their Forces: the which if he should chance to do,
staying on the one side, the Emperors Army upon the Frontiers of Bohemia,
Bavaria being on the other side confined to the Danube, He himself by reason
of the open passages to Nurenberg, receiving fit provisions for his incamping,
(which would be wanting to Walesteine and Bavaria, who were shut up in narrow
bounds) he to the great damage of the Romanists, and good of his own men,
would make good his station, diverted Walesteines intentions, and have
facilitated the enterprises of his other Commanders, dispersed in the
neighboring Provinces. He therefore went in person with his Horse to Anspach
(a Town in the Palatinat walled about with old walls, belonging to the Count of
that name) and sent some Troops of Horse too within sight of Weiden, but to no
purpose; for the Commanders of the Roman-Catholique League having some notice
of it, and fearing lest the joining of their Forces formerly agreed upon, might
be hindered by the Swedes, they sounded the Sourdet, and that very night went
in haste toward Egra, where they thought to meet with Walesteines Army. The
Swedes could not march so fast, as to come up to the Romanists, for it behoved
them to march circumspectly, lest they might fall into the Imperialists
ambushes, who were already increased by some Regiments of Horse: and lest all
these retiring themselves toward the gross of Walesteines Army, should have
leisure to join together, and force the King to retreat, all that succeeded
herein, was some incounters between the Crabats, and some Troops of the
Swedish Horse, wherein the Swedes had the worst.

Walesteine being now come to Egra, and certified of the Kings proceedings,
whereby he foresaw his designs, seeing withal the Bavarian Army near at hand:
and Elnbogen having surrendered it self for want of Munition, to Holca, sent
that very night his Horse to back the Bavarians, and was himself by the
break of day on the 18th of June at Lutitz, June. 18.
a Town upon the Confines of the upper Palatinat, not far from Egra; where
meeting with his Highness of Bavaria, many complements past between them,
(though Walesteines countenance agreed not with his heart, which agitated with
intestive passion, with the ashes of simulation, hid that fire which hatched in
his mind an unextinguishable combustion to the interest of that Prince.)

The King not being able to hinder the joining of the Romanists Armies, nor yet
to relieve Elnbogen, withdrew himself under Nurenberg, (one of the chief and
richest Cities of the Empire,) which lying as it were in the bosom of Germany,
between Franconia, the Palatinat, and Swabenland, having the River Pegnits
running through it, over which there are many Bridges built, joining the two
sides of the City in an opulent Country, environed every where about with
fruitful territories, abounds very much with all things requisite for humane
sustenance; and is so populous by reason of the multiplicity of handycrafts,
which are in better perfection there, then elsewhere, as it is not outdone by
any other City in Germany. Nurenberg is eight miles in compass, and is doubly
walled and ditched, according to the ancient mode; the government thereof is
Aristocraticall, the Senate thereof being composed of 24 ancient Families, out
of which 26 are chosen who govern. This Town made much for the Kings
advantage, for he received from thence continual refreshments, and Ammunition
for his Army, and berest the Imperialists of their assistance, as likewise he
thereby kept himself from the hazard of a Battle, with fresh and numerous
men, and did also preserve that communalty from the Austrians resolution, of
giving it in prey unto the Soldier, and serving it with the same sauce as they
had done Magdeburg; and if this prime Town, and diverse of the rest, had seen
themselves abandoned, they would soon have endeavored a reconcilement with
the Emperor, changing their love of the Swedes into hatred; since the
friendship and correspondency of Princes, and more particularly of Republiques
endure no longer, then their own requisite interest indures, and their hopes
that by the friendship of others they may advantage themselves, and fence
themselves from being injured by the more potent. There were some
notwithstanding who were capable of reason, that thought the King did this to
detain the Romanists Army, and make them perish for hunger, in a Country
unpeopled, and rendered waste; and the rather for that a contagious disease
broke forth amongst them, called the Hungarian disease, which being begot in
the Emperors Army, was no small damage unto them, which would not only have
been very advantageous to the King, he having already had sufficient Provisions
from the City: But that which was thought to be the basis of this affair was,
the facilitating the Duke of Weymars affairs at this time in Swabenland and
Tiroll, and the like of Gustavus Horn in Alsatia, and of other Commanders
elsewere; to hinder whose proceedings Walesteine must have much dismembered his
Army, or else quitting his resolution of winning Nurenburg, turn himself
thither where he thought his Masters dominions stood in most need of defense,
or else leave those Provinces to their fortune, and to the Swedish Armies. The
King began then to fortify his Camp in so advantageous a place, as that
nothing could be thereby judged, but that he meant to keep within those
rampires some time; there were some others, notwithstanding who thinking they
knew the Kings mind, were of opinion, that he did this to the end he might
play a safe game, and not hazard all that he had won with so much labor and
expense of so much time upon one days fortune; and that his ends were to keep
Walesteine all the summer about that Town, and his new men in continual
sufferings, they not being accustomed to hunger, against which they could not
be provided so easily as they desired, being so far from those opulent
Countries; and then in the midst of winter to endammage them more by the
hardness of the season, (which the Swedes could better endure being bred up in
the most frozen Northern parts) and the incommodity of their incamping, then
by his sword. But the truth was, that the King not believing a beaten Army
could like Antaus grow the stronger, thought that being herein deceaved, he
might meet with the like difficulties in the sequel; and finding himself
amiss in his opinion, which he maintained against those who had told him, that
Walesteine had given order for an appearance in the field with 40000 Soldiers;
after this experiment he was heard to say, that the house of Austria was so
mighty a monarchy, as that he himself had seen that effected by it, which he
thought had been impossible

Walesteine having spoken with the Duke of Bavaria, and their Forces being
united, (after many consultations held how they were to behave themselves in
the future Battle) being informed of the Kings approach near Nurenberg, and
of the deep Trench wherewith he had fortifyed his Army, they thought that to be
true which they had been told by many, to wit, that the Swedes being very weak,
durst no more scour the Country over as they had wont; and thinking that by
their numerous Army* they might be able on all sides to inviron the Swedes, and
to hinder their succors from Franconia, Swabenland, and Saxony, (bringing them
consequently to the point of not only fa^ishing their men, but of destroying
their horses (wherein their greatest strength consisted) by hindering them of
forage they all agreed to march toward them. They therefore raised their
Tents from the quarters they had taken up, and in good order marched toward
Neuburg, a walled Town seated upon the banks of the River Schwartza,
belonging to the jurisdiction of the upper Palatinat, and from thence to
Neumarck, a Town of the said Province seated upon the Sultz, and lastly too
within sight of Nurenberg.

The Imperialists Army being come to Freistat, Walesteine made there a general
Muster, where were found 314 Cornets of Horse, 210 Ensigns of Foot, 70 piece
of Cannon, and 4000 well furnished Wagons. His Highness of Bavaria, and
Aldringer marched in the Van; the Battle fell to Gallusse his share, and
Walesteine brought up the Rear; in which order they marched too within sight of
the City, scouring the Country with their Crabats and Dragoons; the
Imperialists were saluted with above 600 Cannon-shot from the Swedes, who made
diverse sallies out upon them, but came always off with loss; for the
Austrians Horse behaved themselves so gallantly, as that the Swedes durst not
almost stir out any more from their Trenches, so as it was impossible to
hinder the Romanists from making their Trenches, which were in short time
perfected, and wherein were lodged their Horse and Foot.

But it must not be omitted, that as the Imperialists marched from Neumar^k to
Freistat, Walesteine being in the Rear, as he marched through a wood, between
these two Towns in his Coach, 'twas said a Harquebusse was discharged at him,
which hit behind the Coach, but did not hurt him: this accident though very
considerable, was busht up, and no inquiry made into it; but the little that
was known thereof, fell from the mouth of Tersica, who shared in the danger,
and from those that followed the Coach, who said that this was a plot of some
of his enemies, so to kill him, whose life was a dangerous rock to their
designs; but those that understood more were of differing opinions, some said
it was a chance-shot, made by some of his own Soldiers, who discharging their
Muskets for pleasure, do many times without thinking of it, shoot one another,
and this was the likelyest to be true; others conceived this to be a piece of
Walesteines cunning, to make the Court of Vienna believe, he ran great danger
for serving the Emperor faithfully, and thereby to inhance his merit with his
Master, and to exalt his own fame, which might appear to be so much the
greater in being attempted against; others (and with more appearance of reason)
thought this report to be false, and spread abroad only to know what men
thought of him; for Walesteine was therein very inquisitive, and would often
afford discourse thereof to others.

Whilst the Imperialists labor to strengthen their Camp, the King kept within
his Trenches; making notwithstanding continual excursions with his Horse, and
skirmishes, to know the Caesarians proceedings; who haulting here, pitched
their Camp in sight of the enemy, with whom they had diverse actions, wherein
sometimes the one, sometimes the other had the better. The Imperialists took
diverse Villages wherein they quartered part of their Horse, sacking many Towns
formerly forsaken by the Inhabitants; for upon the news of the Caesarians
march, every country-fellow provided for his safety; amongst the rest
Allerspurg, a Town near Freistat, was insolently visited by some Troops of
Hungarian Horse, a Nation more severe and less compassionate then many others;
yet were they requited for their extortions; for being closely pursued by 2000
Swedish Horse, about 200 of them were slain, and some of them who were taken
prisoners for the reward of their barbarousnesse were paid with the Gallows.

Plundering, Ambushes, and beating up of Quarters, was daily used by both these
Armies; when the King seeing how much he was molested by the frequent
incursions of the Crabats, (whom Walesteine had commanded to disturb the
Swedish Camp, by giving them continual alarums, that so they might weary out
the Swedish Horse,) which being armed and kept in continual motion, did with
little advantage consume away of themselves: for when the Swedes came forth to
Charge them, they having their Horses ready saved themselves by flight; the
King, I say, much incensed at these people, by whom his Camp was more
incommodated then by all the rest, resolved to use what possible diligence he
could to rid himself of this trouble. He commanded therefore that the
out-guards should be reinforced with fresh Horse, and that amongst these many
Dragoons and Musketeers should be mingled, who lying in fit ambushes should
wait the coming of the Crabats; and when they were within Musket Shot, give
fire upon them, and that then the Horse-Squadrons opening should inviron them,
this was more then once done to good purpose, so as the Kings quarters were not
so much troubled, for the Crabats being thus aware of their too much
forwardness, were not so apt to let loose their horse reins.

These Dragoones are Musketeers on horseback, who are picked out men, strong,
and courageous; for the continual duties which they are put unto, requires
they should be such; their office is to back the gross body of the Horse, and
upon occasion to light from horseback, possess themselves of the most
advantageous places, and play upon the enemy with their Muskets, which if they
shall not be able to do, they getting on horseback may easily retire
themselves to the gross of their Army; these are sent upon convoyes, are
employed in making of ambushes speedily, in surprising fitting passes, in
clearing ways, assailing Forts, and in doing all things which are requisite in
the mannaging of Arms; they for the most part serve with Foot Muskets; they
carry their match lighted tied to a cloven stick, which is fastened to the
headstall of their horse; they have short swords, and a little Axe hanging at
their girdles to cut wood, break down Pallisadoes, and to do other
occurrences: this is a new sort of Militia, and of late usage in the last
wars of Bohemia and Germany, and the effect has showed it to be of great
use: some will have Ernestus Count Mansfeild to be the first inventer thereof,
who fighting against the Emperor, (being an exile) and having no permanent
place of safety, horst his Foot, that he might the more readily march whither
he would.

Walesteine being advertised that some Carriages of Ammunition were coming
from Herbipoli to the Kings Camp, not thinking it fit to let them pass,
resolved to bereave the enemy of this supply, and to relieve his own men
therewithal; he gave the charge hereof to Colonel Spor, one much verst in
war, to whom he to that purpose allotted some Regiments of Curassiers,
Dragoones, and Crabats. This, Spor put readily in execution, chasing some
scouts back to the King, taking some prisoners, and others saved themselves
from the Imperialists in the woods. Spor not knowing that any of them were fled
away, for the wary prisoners affirmed unanimously that there was no more in
their company, pursued the enterprise, and ordered his ambush, weighting for
the coming of the Swedes; but the King having advertisement hereof, presently
doubled his ambush, which Spor was not aware of, so as he was retiring to his
quarters (for seeing no more Swedes appear, he feared they had had
information) he sell upon the Kings ambush, which handled him very sorely, few
of his men escaping away by flight, he himself being taken Prisoner, and the
Marquess of Gonsagas Regiment (who valiantly maintained the brunt) had much
ado to retreat. Issolani (he who by continual and brisk skirmishes afflicted
the Swedes, (whereby he had not only won credit to that Nation, which was
therefore termed the Swedes scourge, but advantaged himself thereby, (for
Walesteine (who was a bountiful Prince, and prodigal to brave and courageous
Soldiers) had presented him with 4000 Dollers, and a gallant horse) knowing
that the Kings new way of waging war had prejudiced their fencing, and being
much incensed at the routing of his Hungarians at Allerspurg, at the late
business of Spor, and in other incounters.) went with 1000 Horse into the
fields, and resolutely fell upon some of the Kings Squadrons, broke them,
killed about 300 of them, and much to his content, brought Walesteine two of
the enenies Horse^Standerds; and (for that reward given by the Prince unto the
Soldier is a great provocation to good service, and the true bond whereby to
keep fast the obsequious affection of Commanders) he was brought to the
quarters of Gount Michenea, Commissary-generall of the Caesarian Army, to be
congratulated (according to the German fashion) by viands and wine for this his
service: where passing from healths to play, he lost well nigh all the reward
given him by Walesteine, when during his play he was again presented by
Walesteine with 2000 whereupon being restored to what he had lost, and leaving
play, he immediately went to Court, where being told by the General, that a
Convoy of the enemies were upon their march from Erbipoli, he without replying
(for Walesteine loved to be so dealt withal) lept into his saddle, went
toward them, and meeting with the enemies Horse, after a fight stoutly made
good by both sides, the Crabats at last prevailed, and having slain about 200
Swedes, hurt many others, and taken many prisoners, they came back to their
quarters, with three Cornets, where meat was provided for those Soldiers,
whereby they were well refreshed, who were before well-nigh famished.

I thought good to commemorate this act of Walesteines liberallity, to the end
that by his example, it may be known of what force a Generals generosity is
with his Soldiers, and that though Walesteine was held for strangely
extravagant, insomuch as many thought all his actions had a tang of madness,
yet for what belonged to a Worthy, he was a man of most eminent virtue: all his
actions leaned upon the deepest mysteries of experimental policy, upon which
occasions me-thinkes I should not omit any thing, though if I should relate
all, my story would be nothing but the recounting of his magnanimous acts. He
was prodigal in his rewards, and severe in his punishments; and as his gifts
did always exceed thousands of Crowns, so were his punishments seldom or
never less then death: He who thought himself to be no ordinary Prince, and
to have a more then generous heart, neither knew how, neither would reward
virtue and fidelity with small recompense, and therefore he had wont to say,
that the worth and service of a Soldier was to be esteemed so great and
acceptable, by how great the price was wherewith it was recompensed; and by how
great estimation was put thereon; and that he that thought to be served good
cheap, had but cheap service done him; for the reward of a thing ought to be
answerable to the worth thereof. Virtue was therefore cherished and much made
of in his Court, insomuch as every one endeavored to go thither fraughted
therewithal, as much as he could; just as Merchants do, who carry their
merchandise thither where they have the best vent; and therefore he never
rewarded any man poorly; and herein I must not forget an act of magnificence
used by him to an Astrologer. Walesteine was so given to affect judicial
Astrology, as that he governed all his actions, as if it were by the influence
thereof; undertaking business then, when he seemed to be seconded by
propitious Stars, and forbearing any action when he discovered an averse
constellation; and employing only such in the charge of his Army, at whose
nativity the Planets seemed to be well inclined, and to whom they promised good
fortune in war. He being informed that there was a Genovesse in Vienna, named
John Baptista Seni, a professor in that learning, who had foretold many things
that had accordingly succeeded, sent John Peroni (a Florentine, who was very
inward with him) to bring him to his service, which he did agreeing with him
for a pension of 25 Ducats a Month, at which Walestein being offended, he
sharply reprehended the said Peroni, for having brought a virtuous or man of
worth, to serve him for so small wages, saying, you Florentines had best
exercise those your good husbandries with Italians, and not with me; who abhor
to have the learned at so cheap a rate. So great a friend was he to
unaccustomed greatness; he gave order he should have forthwith paid unto him
for his journey, (which was but ten Dutch Leagues) 400 Dollers, and that he
should be furnished with a Coach and six Horses, and gave unto him a stipend of
2000 Crowns a year to be paid him before hand, his Coach and all other
requisites being maintained to his hand. He so inamored all men with these his
magnanimous actions, as it was noted he had got unto him the most famous men in
all sciences that our age produced: and many a private Soldier for doing some
one remarkable act, has been by him in one day preferred to a Captains place,
and they have had moneys assigned unto them sufficient to maintain them in
that dignity; whereby he did not only make those observant of him, who were so
raised by him, but did by their examples attract others out of hopes of faring
alike; so as all his Soldiers strove who should most please him, by their
worthes and valors, not by flatteries, and other indirect means, whereby the
good will of many in these corrupt times are won. By equal rewarding valor
he allayd the pretensions of such as were of great birth, won the good will
of the people, and making those his favorites who had particular dependency
upon him, he made himself be the more reverenced, and bridled the ambition of
great personages; for to confer favors only upon such as are nobly
descended, makes the meaner sort despair. To this purpose he had wont to say,
that worth and valor did not consist in a spruce-beard, in a well-ordered
head of hair, nor yet in titles of birth and greatness, but in a dauntlesse
spirit and ready hand. He perfectly detested Ceremonies and feigned
Complements, too much used now adays in Courts: and therefore he had wont to
laugh at those who would bow too low and cringe unto him, and mocking them
would say, this would do well at Rome, where a man may catch a cold with
standing an hour bareheaded with his hat in his hand, upon Indeed Sir it shall
be yours. He also liked not many words used by Lords or other novices in
war, in the proffering of their service, insomuch as at last he denied to
give audience to any such; letting them know that valiant and faithful
actions, were the means whereby to please a Prince, and that thererefore in
their service they shoud testify their valor, which would be the most
pleasing visit they could make to him: yet failed he not to make his Officers
welcome all foreign Cavaliers with much civillity, and to reward their good
service. Neither did he this so much for the aforesaid reasons, as for that he
very well knew how great an enemy familiarity is to respect, and particularly
in his case, who having formerly had much acquaintance and many comerades, who
thought themselves therein now to be happy, he could not but say, that
domestickenesse cancelling respect, did detract from the splendour of his place,
and from such observance as his eminency required: and that he had rather his
commands should be observed by his Officers, as Counsels, then as orders of his
power. He severely punished every least default, which though it got him the
name of cruel, yet he valued it not, saying, this was the true way not to
mischief his men; for he who saw a small fault punished, would the more
apprehend the punishment of a greater; and this fear becoming the rudder
whereby the ship of their actions was steered, kept the course thereof straight
upon the Haven of obedience and of their Masters favor: he caused one that
waited on him in his Chamber to be hanged for waking him contrary to his order;
he banished a Soldier out of his Army for having no boots on: this his
severity seemed to many to be tyrannical, and barbarous cruelty, but in the
hidden secrets of his maxims 'twas found to be a discreet piece of wisdom:
for such events were the Trumpets which banished Cowards from his Camp, and was
so wholesome an electuary to the fearful, as many lest they should meet with
death through their own negligence, became hardy, and one fear drove out
another: yet did he moderate this bitterness of his government by the sweet of
his rewards, of the which he was as liberal, as he was prodigal of punishment.

BOth the Chieftaines of the Armies remained constant in their opinion of
confounding their Enemies. Walesteine desired to raise the King, and to besiege
Nurenberg; The King resolved to maintain it, and to raise the Romanists Army;
they each entertain other daily with skirmishes and other slight incounters;
when Duke Weymar having indeavored the taking of Lindaw in Swabenland and being
come even to the gates of Vbberlingen and Cell, Towns seated upon the Bodem
Sea in the uttermost eastern parts thereof, failing in his intentions (which
was to surprise the said Fort, and thereby possess himself of the Lake, and
of those passes which lead into Retia; which if he had done he might have
easily lead his Forces even into Italy, since that the Grisons the greatest
part whereof are Protestants, and at this time very much incensed against the
Austrian party, would gladly have seen such a novelty, hoping by such an
assistance to fall upon their so much desired recovery of the Valteline,) he
resolved upon another no less considerable enterprise; which was to invade
Tiroll, a bold thought and not easily to be effected, though made to appear
easy by his exalted imaginations; for things unexpected prove always easier
then those that are foreseen; this was so weighty a design, that if he had
prospered therein, as indeed it was not impossible he should do, he would not
only have enlarged himself even to the Confines of Italy, but descending by
the River Inn, (which taking it is head from the Alps in Rhetia with a swift
current becomes navigable from Inspruch to Passaw, where it falls into the
Danube) he would have brought himself into the Archbishopricke of Saltzburg,
(a Province which extends it self on the East to the Confines of Austria, upon
the West to Bavaria, and the Country of Tiroll, upon the North is enclosed by
the Inn, and is bounded on the South by Stiria, which abounds in Mines of
diverse. Metals, and in Cattle, is rich, and delightful, belonging to the
Archbishop thereof, (one of the richest Prelates of all Germany, whose rents
come to near upon 300000 Dollers yearly) and winning that City which was not
yet fully fortified as was intended, he might doubtlessely without much
difficulty pass on to Passaw, a place of great importance, and from thence to
Lintz, (a City in the upper Austria seated upon the Danube,) where joining with
the discontented people of those parts he might have overrun Austria, and
marched up to the very gates of Vienna, wasting and plundering all that
Province, which not having yet quartered any of the enemies Forces promised
good booty. Had this enterprise succeeded (as it was undertaken, and afterward
deserted) it had apparently endangered the Roman Catholic Camp before
Nurenberg, or brought it to some great necessity; for the greatest part of
their Victuals and Ammunition came from Austria, and Bavaria. He then with this
intention passed about the midst of August with 8000 Soldiers to Mimingen,
August.
from thence to Kempten, and unexpectedly set upon Feltzen, a Town environed
with Towers, and imperfect Ditches, after the ancient manner, which being
seated in the utmost parts of Swabenland upon the Leech, and in the Confines of
Tiroll, where those Mountains meet, which divide Tiroll from Swabenland, was
upon these present emergencies, of no contemptible consideration. The onset
being ordered, the Garrison made no resistance, neither stayed they to be
assaulted, but at the enemies first approach, they rose in mutiny against their
Governor; for he being one that had taken up Arms for his particular gain,
and desirous rather to enrich his purse then his reputation, turned the
greatest part of the Contribution-mony due to the Soldier to his own private
use; treating them with severe avarice, and keeping in his own quarters,
people who were to watch over, and punish such as complained of his government;
so as taking him prisoner (and for his greater shame binding him with cords,
and plundering his house) they surrendered themselves and the Town unto the
Swedes.

Whilst Weymar was intent upon this affair he received a redoubled Command
from the King, that all other business whatsoever set aside he should come
with all his Forces to Nurenberg, so as he was by obedience bound to forgo the
occasion, which had unlooked for presented it self unto him, of entering into
Tiroll, and being returned to Kempten he had already begun his march toward
Nurenberg, when Charles Duke of Lorayne, being on all sides encompassed by the
French Forces, that they might keep him from taking up Arms, though he
publicly appeared to be only for the Emperor, yet having some little
dependency upon the Crown of France, he resolved, though his warlike and
courageous spirit could not well admit of thoughts of peace, to call his most
intimate friends into his private Cabinet, and consult with them upon the
present emergency, being forced thereunto by necessity, which makes men
oftentimes incline to that which they have formerly much abhorred. Hereupon
there wanted not some, who foreseeing how he was running into imminent danger
told him; that nothing ought to be so deerly esteemed of by a Prince, or be so
precious in his eyes, as peace; that no more profitable or useful Counsel
could be given him, then to shun war; that the relying upon the power of
great and potent men was little advantageous, or rather oft-times prejudicial,
for that these, (either that they may work themselves into their friends
territories, under pretense of assisting them, and so appropriate it unto
themselves; or else that they may keep war aloof from themselves, and bring
it into their friends home) do never contract friendship but upon particular
ends, and such as being foreseen by wisemen, ought to be shunned, as we would
do usurers, who taking double use for what they lend, ruin them that adheare
unto them: that his Highness Forces were but small in comparison of so great a
King; that he had no strong hold to withstand or stop a Kings Army save Nancy
and Motha; that in Lorayne there could not be raised above 20000 Soldiers, the
Inhabitants being more versed in ploughing and cookery then in mannaging of
weapons; that he could not defend himself without the Austrian succors, and
that these were only to be expected from Flanders, Burgundy, or Germany; that
the Germans were employed in the defense of their own Country; that the
Flemmish Army was employed against the Hollanders who were very strong and were
upon the Guard of the Frontiers of France: that Burgundy was a little State,
and unable to give fitting help unless strengthened by Italy, Germany, or the
Switsers: that to bring in foreign Forces was to bring the war home to ones
own house, and to deprive ones self, of the free and absolute authority
enjoyed in peace; and to receive more harm oft-times by friends then we do by
enemies; that Princes ought never to endeavor a breach with such Potentats,
against whom all contending being vain, men only play that they may lose;
that faith ought not to be given to the promises or profers of the mighty, for
that they use to endure no longer then serves for their own occasion; that he
is an enemy who only aspires to get the Command of another man's authority, and
that such as these ought always to be suspected; that occasions are oft-times
invented by the great and powerful, whereby they do hoodwinke their
inferiors, that they may pick a cause to take from them what they possess,
and that they aim no less at the oppression of their friends, then of their
enemies; that they did advise his Highness to abandon the suggestions of the
Spanish Ministers of State; to keep quiet within his own dominions; and
peacefully to enjoy that which he could not so easily preserve in war.

These reasons though very strong, and such as the Duke (had he been wise)
should have followed, were neither embraced nor rejected; but the greater part
of his Council who were wisely by the Spaniards kept partial on their side,
either by pensions, hopes, or promises, thinking it not fit to forgo the
friendship and protection of the Austrian party, for any pretense or threats of
the King of France, grounding their hopes upon the event of the secret practice
held by the Spaniard, by the Duke of Orleans, and other Princes of France,
which was to raise new troubles in France, whereby they might enlarge their
own limits, said Peace was always good, where War was harmfull; as it was
likewise always prejudicial when by the idleness thereof ruin was well-nigh
caused: that wise men ought to observe the means how to secure their
dominions, which was not to be done by suffering their neighbors to increase
in power; that Princes were always in suspicion, either to be treated as
vassalls, or to lose their estate, when they suffered themselves to be brought
into the bosom of one greater then themselves. That France was no more
powerful then it was daily endeavoring to increase its power; that the memory
of their pretensions upon Lorayne, (a fair Jewel for the Crown) was of great
efficacy; that fit occasions to weaken such Forces as we stand in fear of,
ought not to be let slip, when the permitting of them may cause jealousy; that
it was better to hazard ones self in war, then to be sure to lose all in
peace; that inferior Princes thought it a great advantage to have a sanctuary
whereunto to fly, when they are injured by their superiors; that nothing could
preserve Lorayne from the ambition of the French, but protection from Spain;
that it might be said to be lost between the Swedish and the French Forces:
that reason of State would have Alsatia preserved, Burgundy kept flourishing,
Flanders strengthened, and France troubled: that the King wanting issue was
less observed by his subjects; that such successors as were most adhered unto
by the unstable and wavering multitude had reason to hope well; that therefore
Orleans ought to be fomented, and that it was safer to follow the Austrian
party, then by fearing the French Forces, to grant them that which would be
more profitable to deny them

Although these reasons prevailed much with the Duke, who was sufficiently
thereunto inclined, and did lively work upon the affection which he bore the
Imperiallists, occasioned by the good entertainment he had received from them*
whilst he was a Voluntier in their Armies against the Count Palatine, during
the life of his Uncle Duke Anthony; yet for that the fiercest spirits are
sometimes kept under by the scourge or rod of the more powerful, fearing the
inundation of the French upon his State, (who were already in readiness, and
had a good will thereunto) he by the advice of his Council resolved upon a
piece of cunning; which was to satisfy the King with complements and fair
words, and with all outward appearance which might make him forbear his
threats, and to conceal the ill will he bare him, to a fitter occasion.

And for that the French (a Nation of all others, of a more nimble spirit,
boldness of mind, and unquiet disposition,) are hardly pleased or contented
with the idleness of peace, but still desiring novelty, is often times prodigal
of its wisdom, and runs without foundation to graspe at shadows, which to
their passion seem bodies; those that had seduced the Queen Mother to absent
her self from the Court, and to put her self into the hands of the Spaniard,
being still distasted with the present condition of affairs, and thinking they
should be more esteemed of when they were forth of the Kingdom, then when in
it, having likewise wrought upon the Duke of Orleans, (the Kings only brother)
to incense him against the Cardinal Richelieu (an officer of State, to whom
the whole government of the Kingdom being committed, did faithfully govern
it, and with so much advantage as France had never before known) upon pretense
that the authority wherewith this man was entrusted, belonged better to a
Brother then any other subject, feeding him with vast hopes, kept him still in
Lorayne.

The Spaniards, by whose knowledge all this business was set on work,
considered how much the troubles of France would make for their greatness, and
the profit they might receive by the Civil discords of that Kingdom, whose
union was their jealousy, and was only able to counter-ballance their desired
ends: and this so much the rather, for that by reason of the French Forces
falling down upon the Frontiers of Germany, they rationally enough suspected
they might have called the Swedes into those parts to frighten the Roman
Catholics, and consequently invite them to fly for protection to them,
whereby fencing themselves from being injured by the Protestants, and without
unsheathing their sword, yea under a religious pretense, this was a fitting
means to possess themselves of many Forts of great importance: But it being
foreseen by the wisdom of the Austrian Council, that this was the Center
wherein the lines of many circumstances of reflection was to fall; for that the
getting of the French are such as are much facillitated by the peoples
necessity, who had no other means ( Spain being grown too weak) to defend
themselves against the war, but by their protection; and that as this would
be a considerable addition to the greatness of France, so would it be no small
trouble to the Austrian power, since it was not in good policy of State to be
permitted. Hence it is that many think they upheld the fearful with hopes,
fomented the malcontents with Counsel, and endeavored to stir such as
were constant by feigned appearances; so as these practices passing from one to
another already infected with treachery (as the Duke of Momerancy, Dukes of
Rohan and Delbeaf, the Bishops of Vsiers, Nismes, and Besiers, and many other
principal subjects) the business seemed already to have had a good beginning.

But on the one side they found the Swedes proceedings to be such, as neither
the German Forces, nor yet the Forces of Flanders (which were much weakened)
seemed to be any ways able openly to second the commotions in France; and that
the straights whereinto they were by the Swedes reduced, did not well comport
with the irritating of France, and thereby drawing upon them a dangerous war:
and on the other side they considered, that to pass by such an occasion as
this, whereby to moderate the greatness of France, was to lose that wisdom,
which, as the Pilot of the Spanish Counsels, brought their resolutions
oftentimes to a happy shore; since wise Politicians ought never to abandon
those undertakings out of fear, which may suffocate fear, nor embase
themselves in those difficulties which valiantly withstood, are usually by time
and fortune dissolved. Wherefore finding no less danger in bearing with those
jealousies threatened by the Frontier Army, the gray headed Spanish wisdom,
refined by the Italian subtilty, and made perfect by the continual mannaging
of so many and various examples, measuring their height of profit, with their
depth of danger, unanimously agreed to endeavor intestine trouble in France,
to shelter themselves from the cloud which threatened them, and to win time,
which being of great help to those who study witty projects, they hoped to
reap thereby good advantage: and though the small Forces which Orleans had
with him, promised no great effect, yet the hopes they had, that many others,
who had not yet discovered themselves, and who bore ill will to the Cardinal,
would join with him, as being the Kings only Brother, and Heir apparent to
the Crown of France, made them hope for some good event; And for as much as
past examples do much authorize the Counsels of Princes, whereupon building
their Maxims, they think that what has once happened, may be an unvariable
Law to future times; the Duke growing somewhat cool in the enterprise, having
no other hopes then those already laid, and his Councillors rather blinded by
desire, then guided by virtue, egging him on by calling to mind past examples,
whereby ^e might see what effects the instabilitie of other Princes had wrought
who were much inferior to the only Brother of the King, they conjectured the
like issue must be expected from the troubles, so prejudicial in former times,
as also at the present, to all France.

It was therefore commonly said by many, That the Duke of Orleans, persuaded by
these suggestions, and likewise comforted by Momerancyes promises, who was
Governor of Languedock, and by the hopes of receiving succor from Spain,
suffered himself to be persuaded* and that therefore drawing in an undue season
into the Field, and being come out of Lorayne, He with the Dukes of Ro^an, and
Delbeafe, Count Moret, and his Favorite Pilloran, came into Languedock, where
joining with the Forces raised by Momerancy, and being in this folly followed
by many from all parts, great troubles were likely to have insued in France;
For the which, though the Spaniards design seemed then to have had a good
beginning, for Marshall De la Force, who was with his Army upon the Frontiers
of Germany, toward the Dukedom of de Pont, for the enterprise of Filisberg
belonging unto Trevers (as has been said) being sent for to suppress the
Rebell^, freed those Frontiers from the jealousies the Austrians had conceived;
yet did not that effect follow which was hoped for by the Enemies of France,
for the Kings Forces hastened thither, and these being with good conformity
managed by the wise orders of Cardinal Richelieu, and the Rebels Forces
being divided within themselves, by the bad correspondency held between the
Duke Delbeafe, and Pilloran, with Momerancy, and Marshall Schamburg (who was a
particular Enemy to Momerancy) closely pursuing him, and fighting with him
near Chasteauno d' Arri, Count Moret was slain, the Rebels disper'd, and
Momerancy taken Prisoner. At which accident, Monsieur being exceedingly
troubled, and they failing in their courage, who inciting sedition and
instabilitie, use only to keep so long constant, as their hopes meet with no
opposition; And finding he could expect safety from no where else but from the
King his Brothers clemency, for he was not only pursued by Schamburgs
victorious Forces, but likewise by those of Marshall De la Force; he resolved
to ask forgiveness of his Majesty, and to return to his obedience. He to
this purpuse dispatched away Monsieur De Caudebonne, he found no resistance in
the King, who accounting it a piece of greatness to pardon, could not but be
mollified at the entreaty of an only Brother, mislead by evil Counselors.
His Majesty therefore dispatched away Monsieur D' Ayguebonne (Brother to the
said Caudebonne) to the Duke his Brother, to assure him of his pardon; And at
the same time, going from Dawpheny toward Languedock, and Monsieur coming to
meet the King, the Articles of agreement were (as they were upon the way)
concluded on by the Duke of Boullognie, the contents whereof were: That
Monsieur confessing his fault, did desire the King would be pleased to pardon
him, promising to give his Majesty any reasonable security that he would no
more commit the like error: That he would forgo all practices as well within
as without the Kingdom; and more particularly that he would forsake all
intelligence held with the Spaniard, the Duke of Lorayne, and the Queen
Mother, as long as she should keep her self out of France; that he would not
take in ill part any thing his Majesty should do to any one that had been
guilty of Treason, nor that he never would ask pardon of the King for any
forreigner that had accompanied him in this his mischief intended to the
Kingdom: (to all which (notwithstanding) six days time was allotted to retire
themselves into the Country of Ross^glion:) that he should not keep near his
person, nor in his Court, any one that his Majesty should not approve of; and
if he ^ad any such ^eer him, he should (to free suspicion) put him away: and
for that it could not be believed, but that all those evil Counsels had
proceeded from Pilloran, that the said Pilloran should be bound to make known
any Treaty that might have been prejudicial to the Crown. These being signed
by the King, great was the joy thoughout the whole Court, and the Count
D'Allois (son to the Duke of Angolesme, and Colonel of the light Horse) was
appointed to wait upon his Highness to the King, who spoke with him upon the
way: and thus was this fire quenched, which perhaps might have set all France on
a flame.

The Duke of Momerancy not being comprehended in the Articles, and the Duke of
Orleans having promised not to beg pardon for any one that was not therein
specified, remained to be disposed of as the King should please; who knowing
how much prejudice Princes receive by pardoning their Subjects for the breach
of their Allegiance, and that to free ones self of enemies otherwise then by
justice, is a sign of some fear, maturely weighing the salve for this sore,
which by indulgency is always renewed, although his Majesty was always more
inclined to mercy then to justice, yet at last he resolved to let France know
by the example of this Prince, (one of the chiefest of all his Kingdom) that
his mercy extended not to pardon high treason, which should he do, it would
soon be set at naught, that he had been taught by the government of his
predecessors, not to admit of yoak-fellowes in his Kingdom; and that it was
not praiseworthy to pass by those offenses which tended not only to his own
private harm, but to the prejudice of the public. Nay, by this notable
example of his upright government, this mighty Monarch afforded the world
occasion to admire his great virtue, which as he did abound in conferring
favors, on those that did deserve them, October.
so was it plentiful in justice toward Delinquents. He therefore about the
latter end of October was brought prisoner to Tholo^se; his cause was tried,
and upon Inquisition made, he was found guilty of death: and though some
thought he might have merited pardon, (as well for what he himself had done
formerly for the Crown, as in respect of his forefathers deserts, who had
planted the Christian faith in France, and had maintained it with their bloods;
and this a great deal the more, for that by this man's death, that so noble
family did wholly rest extinct) yet were not these reasons of force enough;
since no merits can be so perspicuous, but that the least shadow of Treason may
cover them with black oblivion. He was therefore two days after brought by
the Guard to the Piazza or market place, where his sentence of death, together
with the confiscation of his goods, and his title of Rebel, was read unto him:
and the same afternoon, being first disroabed of his orders of Knighthood, his
head was struck off in a private house, whereby he paid for his infidelity; not
knowing that the governments of Princes are not always the same, but that they
alter as does the understanding and experience of their assisting Officers.

The death of this so conspicuous prince, in whose lineage greatness
flourished, in whose name Nobility shone, whose valor was famous, and in whose
person much virtue appeared, in his strength of years, of a healthful body,
begirt with honors, and abounding in riches, manifested the inconstancy of
fortune, the uncertainty of humane affairs, the slippery footing of
greatness, the fall of glory, and the vanity of ambition. At the news hereof
those unquiet spirits who only sought means how to produce Novelties, (not
unlike to travelers who seek to shelter themselves from the air when great
with tempest it threatens storms) so these men withdrawing their bold fancies
under the security of fear, knew what was the insatiatnesse of desire, the
deceitfulness of passion, the feignednesse of presumption, and the harm of
infidelity. France being by this blow terrified, the common people by this
example undeceived, the Nobility restrained, every man's mind was more bent
upon their obedience to their Prince, then upon their own particular
greatness.

This mean while Montecuculi who then was General of the Caesarian Artillery,
and was in Swabenland, was commanded to march with the Forces that were about
Lindaw and Constantz, to guard Alsatia, and particularly Brisach, a Fort whose
situation was of very great consideration, upon the ascent of a hill, which
having no other hill near for the space of two Leagues, is an Island upon the
Rhyn in the midst of a large Champion, having a Bridge over the River fortified
on the one part and the other with modern fortifications, which make it almost
impregnable by Force, and renders it as well beneficial to all the Towns
thereabouts, as likewise fitting to assemble together the levies of men, which
by Walesteines order were made in Burgundy and in Lorayne, by the Colonels
Cornelius Bentivoglio, Marcus Fiston, Aracourt, Bambaglioni, and others. And
because the Archduke Leopald was much concerned in the preservation of
Alsatia, (and chiefly in that of Brisach, the key of that Province) the care
of seeing this place well Fortified was recommended to Colonel Ascanio
Albertini, Governor thereof: and moreover many other Commanders were sent
thither to survey those Bulworks, and to be assistant to Montecuculi; amongst
the which I my self being one, I forthwith went from the Camp before
Nurenberg, and came with what speed I could to the said Count of Colmar.

The Elector of Trevers being this mean while taken into the protection of the
French, Marshall Horn, who had taken Coblentz, seated upon the Rhyn in that
Angle which the Mosel makes there, (a River which taking its head in the
Mountains of the valley of Listraye, which parts Lorayne from Helvetia and
Alsatia, falls into the Rheine, and is comprehended within the jurisdiction of
the Elector of Trevers) he by the Command of his King, delivered it into the
hands of the French, as he did likewise Tareber, (a walled Town upon the
banks of Mosel, between Trevers and the said Coblentz) the taking of which
places forced the Spaniards (who were lodged in the neighboring Towns) to
forgo those parts and retire to Luxenburg.

Montecuculi and Ossa (the Emperors Commissary who watched over the safety of
Alsatia) being advertised that (besides the departure of the French from those
parts) there were not many Swedes left there, the greatest part of them being
joined with the King before Nurenberg, so as there remained not there above 500
Horse, and 800 Foot, thought therefore to make some further advancement whereby
(if they should get no other benefit) it would be some advantage to them to get
Contribution from the Towns formerly taken in, and satisfy in part their
Soldiers, who grew impatient of living without pay: and it was yet more
considerable, that the Duke of Wirtenberg, who seemed to lean more toward the
Swedes then toward the Emrour (although he durst not yet make public show
thereof) maintaining two Regiments of Foot in his state, (as it was thought) to
assist the Swedes, when he should find the Caesarian Forces near upon his
Confines, would be careful not to do any thing contrary to the duty he ought
to the Imperial Crown. To this purpose, (as likewise for other reasons,) they
went from Colmar and Brisack, and resolved to enter the territories of Turlach
to make the Marquess thereof (who being a Protestant, followed the Swedish
party) aware of the Errors of such Princes, who forsaking the faith and loyalty
which they owe unto their superiors, throw all the goods they do possess
upon the hopes of getting more and greater by the help of others. Having
therefore mustered 1500 commanded Musketeers, and 1300 Horse, with two
Companies of Dragoones, and two pieces of Cannon, under the Command of the
Colonells, Aracourt, Montrec^, Fiston, Bambiglioni, and the Marquess of Baden,
they took their way thitherward, and came happily to Turlach. The Inhabitants
of that place advertised of the Romanists approach, (and not having
wherewithal to withstand their Artillery) sent Commissioners to the Count,
desiring him that he would keep without the City, and that they would provide
him with all things necessary, and that they would receive him and his
domesticke attendants into the Town: but this was to no purpose, for the Count
resolved to lodge there with all his people that night; the which he did
without any prejudice to the Inhabitants: from thence he advanced to Pretem, a
little Town barely walled about, and guarded by 400 Foot, which he forced to
yield to his discretion.

Whilst things went thus, Montecuculi was advertised that the Duke of
Wirtenberg was marching toward him with 6000 Foot, and 800 Horse, so as
commanding me to make the discovery, and I finding that they were but
Country People, come out of hot^houses and places under ground, no account was
made of them; he commanded us to march in Battaile-array, resolving to fight
with them: but the Wirtenbergers coasting along the woods, never parted from
them; for though they were more in Foot then we, yet came they short of us in
Horse, and Discipline, wherein the Caesarians were grown prefect, by their
former wars. A business of so great importance, as is the advantage that old
Soldiers have over new ones, and in particular Country people; for these men
taking up Arms against their will, not to serve their Prince, but to obey him;
and being bread up in the idleness of Peace, are not able to endure the
hardness of war; so as their minds being always upon their own families,
it is impossible to divert them from the thought thereof, and their
intensivenesse to peace and quiet imbaseth their courage.

Montecuculi (desirous to add to these his proceedings, and being encouraged
by information and scouts, which assured him that there were no other Forces
then what has been said in those parts) came the next morning with his Horse
and Dragoones to Knitling, a Town of Wirtenberg, weakly walled and situated;
the Inhabitants whereof prepared for defense, refusing to surrender the Town.
I know not whither they did this as knowing succor was at hand, or for that
the Imperialists wanted Foot and Cannon, or for that it is natural to cowardly
people, to seem valiant, when they fear nothing. But not being able to
withstand a fierce assault made by the Dragoones, and Light Horse, (who upon
this occasion were lighted from horseback,) they fled in such confusion from
their stations, and four of the Caesarian Soldiers advanced so courageously
forward, as possessing themselves of the wicket of the great gate, (which was
left open and abandoned) they let down the drawbridge and let in their
Companions; who being followed by the Horse, put as many to the sword, as at
the first they met withal, and angry that they found therein no booty (for the
Townsmen had conveyed away all the best things they had to Heylburne) they
revenged themselves by setting the Town on fire in four places; which being
(as is usually in Germany) for the most part built of wood, it was in six
hours burnt to the ground. Which may serve for an example to such Citizens as
never having seen the sword drawn at their gates, and thinking to affright and
oppugn the enemy with lovely plumes in their Helmets, and rich Scarfes about
their necks, do not afterward make good their bravery of speech with
gallantry of heart, and so lose their Country, Honor, Substance, and lastly
their Lives.

The Emperors Commanders were not delighted with this fiery spectacle,
occasioned by wicked and distrustful Soldiers; they themselves being
Gentlemen full of honor and humanity: but soon after some Scouts being
returned, who were sent abroad to learn the Condition of the enemy, brought
word back that the Governor of Heidelberg, beeng issued out of the Town with
800 Foot to surprise Wiseloch a walled Town of those parts, was encompassed in
a wood by 500 Horse of the Rheingraves, for the which he desired assistance;
protesting that if they would speedily free him from that danger (the Swedes
being easily put to flight,) the Town would remain at the good will of the
Roman Catholics, wherein the best things of the Country People that lived
thereabouts was brought. Montecuculi though he listened unwillingly to these
hopes, yet Ossa, (who was an old man, and experienced in these parts) insisting
that they should go on (the desire of booty being able to blindfold the eyes
of difficulty) resolved to march thither-ward; yet did he this only with his
Horse, to the end, that upon any extremity he might safely retire; and
therefore he sent his Foot and Cannon toward Filsburg, Mounsieur De
Bambaglione a Loraynese, and Colonel of the Emperors side, was therefore
ordered to advance: who descrying two Companies of the Enemies Horse, (which
conveyed some Carriages of Baggage) believing there were no more there then the
aforesaid 500. Horse, and no whit fea^ing such an number, gave on furiously
against them; who betaking themselves to their heels retired upon a good
gallop, till such time as being past a narrow passage in a plain, which led
them into another open Country environed with thick Woods, they faced about,
making Bambaglione believe their trust lay only in the advantagiousnesse of
those Woods: Here passed a slight Skirmish, the Swedes still retiring toward
Wiseloch, and Bambaglione pursuing them till such time as he fell upon an
Ambush of the Reingraves, and of Colonel Bernard Sciavalis Ki, (one who was
well conversant in those parts,) from whence he was so played on by Muskets,
and set upon by Curiassiers, as after having made what brave defense could be
expected from a gallant Soldier, he fell down dead, most of his Soldiers
being together with him slain, or taken Prisoners; Those who were not so far
advanced as the rest, and who were better Horst, and knew the ways through the
Woods, assisted by the night, recovered Filsburg, from whence Montecuculi soon
removed with the rest of his men, and came to his former Quarters of Brisack
and Colmar.

This endeavor of the Imperialists wakened those that slept; therefore the
Duke of Wirtenberg, (who durst not formerly declare himself an Enemy) finding
himself injured by the surprisall of Knitting, and other Towns, assembled all
the men of his state together, and marched into the Field, intending to do by
the Austrians, as they had done by him.

But because nothing rayses a Princes mind more to consideration then does the
importance of War, though the Duke of immature age, well inclined to War,
full of vast designs, (which were fomented by the troubles begun in France,
and confirmed in him by his Councillors, out of the hatred they bore to the
Roman Catholics, and the Swedes suggestions, and the hopes they had in them)
minded not what the event might be, which a wise man ought always to have like
a Looking-glass before his eyes, and though he infinitely desired to enter
friendship with the King of Swedes; yet not forgetting the Maxim, That it is
good to have the opinion of others, (as well that he might have wherewithal to
cloak the defects of wisdom, as likewise that he might lay to their charge
any thing of evil that might befall,) resolved to send for his Chief
Councillors, and to advise with them upon the injuries he had received from
the Caesarians, and what revenge he ought to take. He with great resentment
urged, that the Imperial Officers were insufferable in their demeanor; that
they thirsted after other men's estates, were ungrateful to their friends,
intending only their own interest; that they thought they should merit at
Gods hands, by being cruel unto, and by ruinating the Protestants; that the
pretense of Religion was so esteemed of by the Romanists, as they thought their
faith was not broken, when the occasion being palliated by some invention, they
know they may usurp that from their friends, which they desire; that there was
no safe living amongst them, who coveting to rule over all men, keep their
ambition only so long hidden as they think it not fit to discover it; That
the reverence pretended to by the Churchmen, was known to be too pleasing,
and that they could not choose but think them their Enemies that did not
reverence them; that their avarice was tinder so ready to take fire at their
own interest, that any least spark of profit was able to make them spread
abroad a combustion of all manner of miseries and vexations; that the
Declaration made some years before by the Emperor, at the instigation of the
Ecclesiastiques, was not to be endured; (to wit, that he would have restitution
made (...) the Churches goods, a large part whereof had been by the
Protestants possessed for above a hundred years;) that this was much to his
prejudice, whose incomes were for the most part composed thereof; that this one
pretense of the Austrians was sufficient to demonstrate their ends tended to
suppress the Princes of the Empire, and to overthrow the faith of the Gospel;
that wise men ought not to refuse an occasion of securing themselves from those
they fear; that it was a more profitable expedient, to follow the for^une of
War with a bold resolution, then being exposed to the injuries of friends, to
live continually full of fears, under the yoke of subjection, in an
uncertain peace.

Princes (even in their weaknesses) have a certain kind of prerogative above
the wisdom of private men; so as though the Duke was for these reasons
confirmed in his desired resolutions; yet since in consultations, all men ought
to be heard what they can say, he earnestly desired the rest to speak freely
their opinions. Some who were made wary by experience, did not in silence pass
by the example of those unadvised Princes, who siding with the Emperors
Enemies, became food to the ravenous fury of the Militia, and had enriched
those who would have always lived miserable in peace: They said, The disorder
of the Soldier was to be borne withal, particularly when covering their
Licencionesse by the credit of their advancing they are freed from their
deserved punishment; that such occasions were to be taken away as do cause
pretenses, by him who deres not to be by them convinced; that covetousness is
not by any means more allayd, then by the easy coming thereby; that the
designs of great men are not to be loosened by the hands of inferiors: That
it is always good not to take notice of offenses, when by taking notice of
them we again pull them upon us; that patience in peace was more profitable
then the inquietudes of War; that the Dukedom of Wirtenberg stood between
Alsatia and Swabenland, (Provinces full of the Austrians Forces:) That it could
not raise above 12000. Soldiers, and those unexperienced in War, accustomed
to rest and quiet, and free from noise; that in all the Dukedom there were
only Sordendorfe, Heybrun, and Onviell Castle, which were able for any time to
withstand a Field Army: That it would be found better counsel to keep in good
correspondency with the Emperor (as the Dukes his Predecessors had done,
leaving behind them the fame of having been loyal to the Empire) then by
leaning to a Foreign and dangerous friendship, to purchase the title of
Rebel. Yet were not these reasons of force enough to allay the heat of his
spirit, and quench that fire which (the Dukes inclination considered) was
kindled in the greatest part of his Counselors; so as conveying what he had
most precious into Onviell Castle, standing upon the side of an unaccessible
Rock in the midst of an open Country between Constance on the East Side, the
Rhyne and Zwitsers on the South, and Wirtenberg on the North, he took up Arms
in the Swedes behalf* Gustavus Horn (who was about Francfurt upon the Main)
hea^^ ^hereof, advanced suddenly with all the men he could get out of the
Garrisons of the lower Palatinat, and Franconia, into Alsatia, as well to make
further progress into that Country, as to assist and foment the Duke in the
Declaration he had made, who hating entirely the Papists, and being a young man
so given to War, when he should see himself thus upheld, would not stick to
declare himself an open Enemy to the Emperor: The which the Swedes desired
much he should do; for it was hard for them to subsist in Alsatia, under those
Forts, without the Dukes assistance; from whence they might have Men, Munition,
Pioniers, Carriages, and necessary Victuals. Which being done, Horn assembled
the Body of an Army together, consisting of 10000. fighting men, and ten pieces
of Cannon.

This preparation of the Swedes made Strasburg bethink themselves, which till
then had kept Neutralls, as not knowing who should have the better; the which
Town, wishing well to the Swedes, either for their Conformity in Religion, or
for the apprehended greatness of the Imperialists, added to these their
desires by the rational pretense of seeing themselves on all sides surrounded
by them; And affirmed, it was rashness to deny that which could not be made
good; that the Imperialists, Forces were far off; that opiniatricy could not
be maintained without near and opportune succors; that the liberty of Cities
consisted in keeping friendship with those who they stood in fear of, in
taking away the occasion of threats; and protesting, They would do the like to
the Austrians whenever they should be encamped near them; they declared
themselves to side with the Swedes, and assisted Horn with what they were
able* Strasburg is seated in the middle of Alsatia, being the Metropolis of
that Province, in a spacious, fruitful, and lovely place, within Cannon shot
of the Reine, upon the which a Bridge of no small consideration is maintained
with exact Fortifications: It is perfectly well Situated and furnished with all
sorts of defense; in so much, as it may be termed one of the best Cities of
Germany: It enjoyes its liberty, is well peopled with Merchandizing-men, and
by Traffic becomes Rich, Fair, and Great. Now whilst the Imperiallists kept
on the other side the Rhyn, Horn made himself master of all the Towns on
this side, which upon the first appearance of the enemy were abandoned by the
Romanists: so drawing near Offemberg, a Town Fortified with Walls and Towers
after the ancient manner, four Leagues from Strasburg, upon the Confines of
Wirtimberg, the Town maintained it self against him, and thrice repused his
assaults, but at length not finding themselves able to make a safe resistance,
it came to composition, and took Laws from the Conqueror.

Thus went the affairs in Dlsatia, when the Austrians who were under the
Command of Count Shamburg in Slesia, and of Don Baltazar Maradas in Bohemia,
received orders from Walesteine to enter Lusatia; and that whilst he should
entertain the Kings Forces under Nurenberg, they should endeavor somewhat of
advantage in those parts. The Commission was obeyed; so as Sittaw and Guben,
two Towns pa^ted by the River Neisse, with diverse other places, weak in
Defense and Garrisons, yielded themselves to the Caesarians. But the Duke of
Saxony awakened by this invasion* assembled all his Army which lay scattered in
diverse Towns, and went against the Austrians, who were not strong enough long
to withstand him; so as after some days defense* they were necessitated to
abandon Gub^n, to surrender Sittaw, and to quit other places they had taken. The
Saxons likewise possessed themselves of Freiberg, watered by Polsnitz, Sagan
near Bober, and Glogaw watered by the Oder, chief Cities in Slesia, together
with many other Towns which were forsaken by the Imperialists, who got into
Steinaw, seated between Glogaw and Breslaw, where they fortified themselves:
but being afterward set upon by Harnem the Saxon General, (having first by
their singular valor supplied the defects of their Bulworkes with the bodies
of men) they were enforced to yield; whose example was followed by Lignitz, a
walled Town seated upon the Angle made by Ratsbach, Schwartzwasser, (Rivers
which taking their head not far from thence, join there, and a little below
fall into the Oder) this Town was taken by Kalchesteim a Saxon Colonel.

This mean while Maradas being joined with Schamburg, Count Mansfeild, and
Schaff^uts, (chief Commanders of the Emperors Army) opposed the Swedes
proceedings; and Mustering their Forces, (which came to 14000 Soldiers and 12
piece of Cannon) he thought it might make much for them to recover Steinaw; he
saluted it with diverse Cannon-shot, and courageously assaulted it, and with
many threats invited the Garrison to surrender the Town; as they basely did,
having had only Thirty Great-shot made at them. The taking hereof encouraged
the Caesarians to undertake the winning of Glossaw; (a thing very much desired
by them, as well for their own honors, as to satisfy Walesteine, for it
belonged unto him as being Duke thereof) being afterward informed that Tuball
one of the Swedish Colonels was intrencht about it with a good body of an Army,
which would make their design the harder, they deserted the effecting thereof,
and some little skirmishes passing between the Swedes and them with equal
success, they left a fitting garrison in the Fort, and withdrew themselves to
Breslaw, the Metropolitan of Slesia, a free Town as are the other Hauns Towns
of Germany, rich and given to Merchandise, by the traffic it holds with
Poland; but not much confiding in the Magistrate thereof, and suspecting the
faith of the Protestant Inhabitants; fearing likewise to be set upon by the
Swedes, who made haste toward them; they resolved to go to Neisse, a place
strongly but irregularly fortified, and there to attend succor from Walesteine,

Their hopes being vanished to air, (who built their greatness upon the
ruins of France) by the death of Momerancy, by the punishment of the Rebels,
and by Monsieurs reconciliation, and the Imperialists being filled with new
fears, through the formidable power of that now united and warlike Kingdom,
wavering in the uncertainty of their resolutions, they openly declared
themselves* when new business being set on foot by the Spanish wisdom, and a
firm resolution taken to sow discord in France, (that they might thereby
secretly enjoy their desired fruit) they applied themselves to the effecting
thereof. And for that whilst Monsieur stayed in Lorayne, his favorite
Pilloran fell in love with the Dawager Princess of Psalsburg, (Sister to Duke
Charles) love being of power sufficient to overcome what ever defense wisdom
could make, and the Princess by secret messengers corresponding with him in
his desires, he gave himself so totally over to the hopes of this marriage, by
which his Condition would be not a little bettered; and being much troubled at
Momerancy's example, thinking his person more considerable when out of France
then when in it, where he was not well looked on by those who were faithful to
the King, making use of the credit he had with Monsieur, raising him by new
hopes to fresh undertakings, troubling his thoughts with Momerancy's death, and
by putting him in mind, that Princes (how merciful soever they be) never
forget the injury of high Treason, he brought him again to resolve of
absenting himself: the which he did by withdrawing himself again into
Lorayne, where Pilloran hoping to make himself worthy of the Princess
Dowager, by some service which he might do to Duke Charles, did negotiate and
privately conclude the marriage with the Princess Margaret, which (as was very
well known) was yielded unto by the Spaniard, that they might have the greater
obligation upon the Duke, in binding him to effect their desires, that they
might by this alliance oblige the affection of these Princes reciprocally the
one unto the other; and by this knot, make both their hatreds to the King of
France implacable, and by the assistance of this State and the Forces thereof
make fitting preparations for to trouble France; and by the interposition of
this State free Alsatia and the Palatinat from the power of that Crown.
Moreover the most Christan King being without issue, and having but small hopes
of any, his Brother was to succeed unto him; so as the making of his brother
sure did not meanly import them, whereby they might not only afterward
ransom such Towns and Provinces of theirs as were fallen under the government
of the Crown of France; but afford matter of thought to the subjects of that
Kingdom, who should take up Arms against the Kings only Brother and Heir,
as well for the respect which is due to the blood Royal, as likewise for
fear, lest he being afterward possessed of the Scepter of that Kingdom might
remember such as had stuck unto the King. Many were therefore of opinion, that
the Spaniards unwilling that he should stay in Lorayne, where being so near,
he might soon alter his determination, and return to France, (as by all
possible art it was by the King endeavored he should do) they wrought so with
Duke Charles, as that he should persuade Monsieur, it were better for him to
retire himself into Flanders; for that by his stay in that his Dukedom, the
King might take occasion to threaten him the Duke of Lorayne, and make War
upon him; whose Forces wanting the Austrians assistance were but weak; that it
was better to see the issue of the Emperors Armies under Walesteine, then by
buckling thereunto without a good foundation run upon the like hazard with
little hopes of good success: Monsieur being then persuaded by these reasons,
and much more confirmed therein by the advice of such as were of credit wi^h
him (not minding their policy) went to Brussels* to the great satisfaction of
the Spaniards; whose end (as was said) by some wise men, was to keep him as an
Hostage, and under some specious pretense, either of waging war against
Languedoc, or some such like thing, to draw him into Spain, and so secure
themselves by their keeping him aloof from France from being unquieted
thereby, and that if their mentioned hopes should fail them, or that they
should meet with any obstacle not to be overcome, he might return to his
former station.

The Count De Susa, a Gentleman well ^ryed in War, who a good while before
had received Orders from the King of France to march into the Elector of
Trevers Territories and cease upon that City, and to force the Chapter, if the
Archbishop would not be persuaded to acknowledge him for his Lord and Master,
past over the Mosell with a good strength of people, and drew near to the
Walls thereof, the Garrison whereof not yielding to his desires, but making
some resistance, were forced (upon Articling) to receive in the French forces,
which had hindered the Count Isemburgh, Master of the Field of the Spanish Army
from coming to their succor; and yet the Austrians not thinking it yet time
to come to an open breach with the French, did not much apply themselves to
defend that State. Triers, or Trevers, is sea^ed upon the banks of the Mosell,
betwixt the Duchy of Luxenburg and the lower Palatinat, upon the confines of
the County of Barrois toward the West: It is no strong City, being barely
Walled about, nor is it very fair, as being too narrow, and ^ot having in it
many fair buildings; it is only taken notice of in History, because from thence
the Electorat takes it is name.

Maestrich^ was at this time straightly besieged by the Hollanders, a place of
no small moment: The River Maes runs through the midst of it, which taking
its head from the furthest parts of Lorayne to^wards France, after a long
course falls into the Lake of Don in Holland; it is perfectly well Forti^ied,
and lying between the Countries of Liege, Iuliers, and Braband^, it is known
to be the Key which opens and shuts the ingresse from Germany to the United
Provinces. The Spaniards, fearing this City should be besieged, not being of
themselves able to succor it, and force the quarters of the Hollanders (which
had quite surrounded it) persuaded themselves, that if Count Pappenheim (who
was nearer those parts then any other of the Emperors Commanders) would join
himself with the Spanish Forces, they should be able to relieve it. They
therefore made their desires known to the Emperor, and to Walesteine, who
yielded thereunto, and the more to hearten Pappenheim, they promised him the
Order of the Golden Fleece, and 100000 Crowns to boot, upon condition he
would raise the Siege and relieve the City. These tidings being therefore
brought to the Hage* my Lords the States were not slack in providing with all
possible diligence for their Fortifications. They therefore reinforced their
quarters; they put the Elector of Coln (who had professed himself to stand a
Neuter) in mind that he should observe his promise, and do nothing that might
be prejudicial to them. But (...) availed but little, for the Elector making
fair excuses, suffered Pappenheim to pass, and to refresh his men in the
Towns of the Archbishopric, who quickly joining with the Spaniards, marched
on to the designed enterprise. The Prince of Orange, resolute not ^o rise from
before the Town, having provided all things fitting for his Quarters, and
ordered Count William of Nassaw to advance with a good strength of men,
prepared to resist the Imperiallists Invasion* which happened luckily for the
Hollanders; for the Austrians were bravely fought withal and beaten back; and
though Pappenheim, madded at the difficulty he found by the obstinate defense
of the besiegers, nor yet being according to promise seconded by the Spaniards,
turned again to renew his assault upon the English Quarter, and though all
means possible were used from the City by sallying out, yet was he forced to
retreat with the loss of about one thousand of his Duch-men: the which, when
the besiged saw, dispairing of any further succor, and wanting Ammunition and
Victuals, they capitulated, and surrendered the Town, to the unspeakable sorrow
of the Spaniards, and all the Roman Catholics thereabout.

Pappenheim being gone from Westfalia, George Duke of Lunenburg had fair
opportunity to over-runne that Country, and to beset and take Duderstat, and
Eimbeck (walled Towns, in the Dukedom of Braunswick) and likewise to besiege
Wulfenbuttell, the Garrison whereof being strong, and well provided of all
necessaries, did by their many sallyes much infest the Neighboring parts; but
this Siege lasted but for a while, for Pappenheimes return made the Duke
desist from that enterprise, two of his Regiments being hardly dealt withal by
Pappenheimes men, who set upon them at unawares in their quarters not far
from the City.

The King of Swethland and Walesteine, stayed all this while in the Fields
before Nurenburg, watching over each others ways; the Famine grew greater and
greater in both Armies as well for Man as Horse; so as each of the Generals
apprehending, that by being the first should rise, they might meet with some
disadvantage in the open Field which might oblige them to a Battle upon bad
terms, and whereon the fortune of both Crowns consisted; both of them sent for
their Soldiers from their Garrisons and Towns of greatest importance. The
King, as he whose forces were weakest, desirous to get out of those streights
and come into the Field, had not only sent for Waymer and Bannier to come
back, but likewise for all those Forces which lay in Swabenland, in the
Bishopric of Erbipoli and of Bamberg.

Walesteine likewise dispatched away Orders to Montecuculi, that he should come
speedily to his Camp before Nurenberg, not thinking that had happened which
has been said in Alsatia; for the Duke of Wirtenbergs march, and the coming
of Gustavus Horn was unexpected. The Count departed, but first by sundry Posts
informed Walesteine of the small number of his men, which came not to 2000 Foot
and 1500 Horse, and what need Alsatia stood in of Forces, being assaulted by
great numbers of the Enemy; and whilst he staid, expecting other Orders from
the General, he met with a new Commission not to stir from Brisack. The
King, having his Army increased by the access 12000 Soldiers, brought unto
him by Waymer and Bannier, went out of his Trenches in Battle Array, thinking
to storm Walesteines quarters, by the intelligence held with two Soldiers sent
by him a little before to that purpose into the Enemies Camp; the one being
Master Sadler to Waymer, and the other a Sutler; the Sadler entered Walesteines
Camp under pretense of his Trade, and the Victualler feigning to be of
Auspech, a Town not far from those quarters, was brought by the means of
Colonel Cornembergs Stewart, to be a Sutler to the said Colonells Regiment:
When the Swedes were to give the assault, the Sadler promised to give fire to
the Ammunition, and the Sutler to the Quarters, but they failed in this their
Conspiracy, God not suffering such a scourge to fall upon the Romanists; for
the Sutler having stolen a piece of Plate the day before out of the said
Cornembergs Buttery, and endeavoring to go out of the Trenches, as he past
through a Court de guard kept by the said Colonells Soldiers, a Corporal
casting his eye upon him, and finding he had somewhat underneath his Cassock
which raised it up, asked him whether he went, and what it was he had under his
Cassock? The other replied, It was bread, and that he was going for Victuals;
whereat the Corporal desiring to have part thereof, found it to be a piece of
Plate, so as he stopped him upon suspicion: The Sutler being hereupon dismayed,
believing that this had not befalne him only for the Plates sake, but for his
having intelligence with the King, presently confessed all, and peached his
Compagnion, who was taken, and on the very day the King came to charge the
Imperialists quarters, he and his fellow Colleague were broken upon a Wheel.
Such events use often to bef^ll Traitors, who for money sell themselves to
death, and to eternal infamy.

The King went straight on to charge Aldringers Trenches; who being aware
thereof, and expecting his coming, beat him back bravely with no little
slaughter of the Swedes; so as seeing he was not here able to execute his
intent, he wheeled about and fell upon those Trenches that were guarded by the
Bavarians, by whom being likewise repulsed he resolved to plant some Cannon
upon a hill near a little wood, hoping by his frequent shot to make the enemy
dislodge, and bring them into the field, where he might fight with them upon
great advantage; ^e began then to play so furiously with his Cannon upon the
Imperialists quarters, as that in less then six hours he had made above 400
shot at them: Walesteine perceiving how the Swedish Cannon molested some of his
quarters, Commanded that all the Soldiers should keep themselves under the
Trenches, and that all the boys, women, and other useless people should
withdraw themselves into a hallow Dell which lay between Gallasse his quarters
and Aldringers, whereby he remedied the mischief he might have received; for
all the shot flying over them did them no harm. The King seeing how little
good his Cannon did, removed from thence, and thought to possess himself of
the rise of another hill which more commanded the enemies quarters; but this
being foreseen by Gallasse, who speedily brought two Regiments of Foot thither,
and there Entrenched them, the King gave over the enterprise, and retired to
his former station in a wood hard by; where being pursued by the Caesarians
(who encouraged by Walesteine fought courageously) a fair skirmish was begun
on both sides, Sept. 4.
which continued from Friday night the 4th of September, till about Ten of the
Clock the next Sunday-morning: great was the loss of both sides, but without
comparison much greatest on the Swedes; for besides many brave Commanders and
Gentlemen of Worth, they lost about a thousand Soldiers; there were slain of
the Imperialists about 400 amongst which Colonel Don Maria Caraffa a
Neopolitan, and Colonel Fucari. Both Armies showed singular valor in their
behavior, the King, Walesteine, and all the Commanders keeping still amidst
the hail of Musket Shot to give fitting directions.

This bloody skirmish made the King know to his cost, that many times event
suits not with expectation; for besides the loss he suffered here, he foresawe
a greater danger threatened by Famine, Victuals and Forage for horse growing
every day more scarce, so as on the 15th of September he held a long
consultation with the chief of his Commanders, Sept. 15.
wherein was discussed how they might be gone from Nurenberg; but so as the
Citizens thereof might not be left to the discretion of the Romanists: 'twas
evidently seen that any longer stay there was prejudicial to the Soldier, who
was not therewithal contented, but beginning to waver on all sides, said,
these were not the effects the King had promised them, to lie and moulder away
before a Town, and do no good: they saw that the remainder of Victuals which
were necessary for the maintenance of the Citizens, being consumed by the
Swedish Army, the Swedes and Citizens would both of them be reduced to great
streights; and Nurenberg being full of people would be for want of Victuals in
great danger of falling into Walesteines power, who had cunningly sown
sedition amongst some of the Citizens; he for this and other reasons resolved
to be gone; and having very well satisfied the Senate of the City with the
necessity of his departing, renewed his friendship with them, and taking a
friendly farewell of all the people, (who filled the air with their wishing
God to bless him, and good fortune to follow him) leaving with them 2000 Foot
for their better strength, he marched with his whole Army which consisted of
26000 fighting men toward Bamberg, to refresh his men wearied with continual
duties. Walesteine who knew likewise he could tarry no longer there, his
Victuals and Forage being well-nigh exhausted, and fearing lest whilst he
should find it a hard business to take Nurenberg, the King might easily
advance to some new design, and that his Forces being weakened by lying before
that Town, he should be the worse able to keep afterward in the field, He
likewise raised his Camp and marched toward Sindetspacke not far from
Nurenberg, where he haulted and mustered his men, who appeared to be 36000
Soldiers; he left Gallasse in the Rear with directions to fire all the
Villages of those parts, (which he did) and that then he should go toward
Misuia, to drive the Saxon Forces thence, whilst he himself went to Bamberg,
(a City in Franconia upon the Main, belonging to the Bishop thereof, who has
there the power of Civil Juridiction) and stayed with his whole Army in some
near neighboring Villages: for his end was only to entertain the King, and
not to put himself upon the danger and uncertainty of a Battle, whilst
Gallasse and Holke going into Saxony with 10000 Soldiers, might ruinate the
Country, and force the Elector thereof to come to an accommodation, when he
should see himself not succored by the Swedes, who would have work enough
found them by Walesteines Forces He afterward sent the Marquess Grana, an
Italian, with 4000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, (all Commanded men) to invade the
Marquessat of Brait a jurisdiction of the same Province, not far from the
Diocese of Nurenberg, which the Marquess Grana did with good success, and
little trouble; Brait not being in condition to withstand a good Body of choice
men, wanting Rampires, Men and Munition, for their defense.

But Horns proceedings in Bavaria (whereinto he was entered with eight thousand
Foot and four thousand Horse) occasioned fearful confusion in those who were
accustomed to the security of peace; and therefore the assistance of their
Princes Forces being acknowledged to be necessary, it behoved the Elector to
part from Walesteine, and with his men and those of Aldringers, amounting to
the number of 14000 Soldiers, to return into Bavaria toward Raim, (a place
environed with strong walls after the ancient mode, in a considerable situation
upon the Leech, lying between Dunawert and Augspurg, which was the passage from
Swabenland into Bavaria) as well to guard those places which were threatened by
the Swedes, as to stop the forwardness of the Austrian Country people about
Lintz; who making use of the Imperialists taking up Arms against the King of
Swede, and of their Princes troubles, took the liberty to take up Arms, and
by way of insurrection, to hinder the navigation upon the Danube, by rifling
the Barks: yet this their insurrection lasted but for a while; for they no
sooner knew that John Went, Colonel of the Catholic League was coming
against them with four Caesarian Regiments, then (as is usual to basely
minded people) they laid down their Arms, and peaceably retired to their own
homes, terrified at the Chastisement inflicted upon some of the heads of the
sedition: so as Walesteine seeing himself much weakened, and totally overcome
by the misfortune of war, for want of fitting accommodation in those
Territories, he resolved to go from thence toward Coburg, to take that Town
and the Castle, which were very considerable: for it was seated in Franconia,
upon the Confines of Thuringia, begirt with ancient Walls, and in some places
fortified with Rampires, and Ditches upon the River Asch, which taking its rise
from within that Province toward Thuringia, after having made a small course
falls into the Main, whereby he might hinder the Swedes from setting upon him
on the Flank, where at any time he should advance into Misnia to join with
Holke and Gallasse. The King was now at Newstat near the Straij (a River which
taking its head from the County of Henneberg, after having watered part of
Franconia falls into the Main) when he was advertised that Walesteine having
raised his Camp from the territories of Nurenberg, and being parted from the
Duke of Bavaria, bent toward Coburg, that afterward he might proceed to
prejudice Misnia, wherein Holke had already taken some Towns, as Gallasse had
likewise done on the other side: therefore having an eye to the Imperialists
proceedings, and finding that their end was to lead their Forces into Saxony,
thereby to force the Elector to accept of peace, since they could not prevail
by their words and Treaties, he commanded Duke Waymer to march with part of
the Army toward Sindlypach, (not far from Nurenberg) and that he should
watch over Walesteines proceedings, and not lose sight of him; and that he
should likewise have an eye to the coming of Pappenheim; who being thereunto
solicited by continual expresses from Walesteine was returned from Flanders,
and was likewise gone toward Franconia and Misnia, to set upon them on the
other side. The King having left the Duke of Be^kinfelt with a body of men
raised by the said Duke, of 5000 Foot and 2000 Horse, to guard the Towns near
Bavaria, marched with his Army toward Nurenberg; where being advertised by the
Citizens what damage the Country thereabouts suffered by the Imperialists
Garrison, left by Walesteine in Lauff, belonging to the jurisdiction of that
Senate, upon the Pignitz, he resolved by suddenly setting upon it to drive the
Enemies Forces from thence; he therefore came before it with his Cannon, and
set upon it, which though at the first it seemed resolute to stand out in its
own defense, yet at last resolved to submit to the Swedes discretion, there
still remained the Fort of Listenaw between Nurenberg and Fortheim: but this
proving a difficult business, as being conveniently well fortified by Art,
strong by nature, and well garrisoned, so as some time would go to the winning
of it, the King thought it not good to make any stay there, and lose his men
whilst his enemies were in the field, strong in men and resolution. Leaving
therefore Colonel Sperater with 3000 men in those parts for satisfaction of
the Senate of Nurenberg, (which began to conceive amiss of the Swedes
proceedings, that City being little less then destroyed for their sakes,) he
led on his Army to Erfurt, the Metropolitan of Thuringia, divided by the River
Iera, which takes head in that Province, and falls into Vnstrutz there to
prevent Pappenheim, before he should execute his design of taking it in; who
having left Count Gronsfield in the Bishopric of Hidelsheim (a Country which
extends it self from the River Glien, to the Fuse in the Province of
Braunswyck) with 7000 Soldiers to besiege Newburg, a strong place seated upon
the side of Abre, used much diligence in his marching away with the remainder
of his men, finding how irreparable an other Battle would be by reason of the
being at hand of so great forces; and for the scarcity of Victuals in those
parts unmanured for want of Inhabitants, and abandoned by the Enemy, who could
not any longer suffer the incommodities thereof. Great was the diligence that
this Count used to prevent the Kings arrival at Erfurt, yet not such as could
out-doe the King in speedy march; for fearing the prejudice he might receive if
he should therein be prevented by the Romanists, he made his Vanguard march by
day, and his Rereguard by night, loosing no more time then what was requisite
in some sort to refresh the Soldier.

The King stayed two days in Erfurt to comfort his Army, and more particularly
his Foot who were very weary with so long marches, in which time he understood
how that Walesteine had won Coleburg, how his Cannon played upon the Castle to
render his Forces the more secure by the taking thereof; as likewise those of
Pappenheim, who was marching to join with him, and what progress Holke and
Gallasse made to the prejudice of Saxony. The Kings Forces and Waymars being
joined, he called a Council of War, where he, with his Chief Commanders,
consulted upon what course was best to be taken; Wherein some wisely weighing
the present condition of affairs, were of opinion, It was not fitting for them
to bring themselves to such a pass, as that they could not shun a Battle
upon disadvantagious terms; that the Imperialists had a considerable greater
number of Soldiers then they, who were ambitious to win by their Swords
Walesteines good opinion, who was a large rewarder of gallant actions (a thing
worthy of consideration:) that the Enemy was protected by favorable
situations, and fit places to retreat unto; that the Swedes on the contrary
were an Enemies Country, and that devasted, there being no appearance of
Provisions sufficient for them to keep the Field against the Imperialists, who
were furnished with all things necessary from Bohemia; that there was not any
more commendable resolutions to be had in warfairing then such as did secure
the keeping of what was already got, and did maintain the Soldier in strength
and vigor; that to do so, was more praise, worthy in a Commander in Chief,
then the gaining of Towns; that such resolutions were always blamed and
prejudicial, as were undertaken without having an eye to the event; that the
whole ought never to be endangered for a part; that in the loss of one
Battle, the downfall of all their already won renown, their ruin, their
being oppressed by their Enemies, the amazement of the Subject and Soldier, and
the fame and reputation of their Arms did consist: That Victory is thought
best when won by Wit, not by the Sword; that wise men ought not only to
consider what advantage may accrue, but provide for what of damage may happen:
That their opinion was to temporise upon the Confines, to incommodate the Enemy
now upon the Flanks, now upon the Front, now upon the Rear; to take from them
their Provisions, and to prejudice them more by the hardness of the season,
and scarcity of Victuals, then by committing all to the hazard of a Battle;
that it was very advantageous to make good what they had alleady won; the
which the Austrians having lost, they would be constrained to keep their Camp
in their own Hereditary Territories, and so warring against themselves, and
thereby weakened, they would the easilier be overcome. These Reasons were
attentively listened unto, and well liked of, almost by every one, and by the
King himself; but it was considered on the contrary side; That to seem
fearful of the Enemy, is the first step to loss; that Armies were not said to
be advantaged by the number of men, but by the Soldiers courage, and
Commanders worth; that barren places were to be forgone, and the getting of
more oppulent Cities endeavored, against the which the Soldier goes the more
boldly on incited by the hopes of gain; that what was won by Arms, was not to
be maintained without Arms; the bold undertakings whereof is usually favored
by Fortune, who when she finds her favourer abused, does oftimes turn her
back. Thus did the King speak and resolve; adding, That in War men ought
not by speculary shadows and imaginations of fear, to deter that boldness
which far from any thought of danger ought only to be confident of, and in it
self: That he confessed, reflection ought to be had of past successes, but
that it behoved not the Conqueror to shun encountering the conquered, that it
was no reason to hazard all for a part, amongst those Enemies, in whom even
that Army with so much difficulty recruited, being comprehended, the utter
ruin of their Dominion did consist: That they were to fight boldly against
those, who once beaten, were not likely to make head again; that it behoved
them to fight who had nothing to lose, and those to shun fighting, who by
losing might be undone; that it was never good to abandon those Confederates,
who building upon their friendly protection, have without respect drawn the
War upon themselves; that it was dangerous for them to fail in the promises
they had made, and hopes they had occasioned: That the Elector of Saxony was
worthy to be assisted, and to have good correspondency kept with him; that all
delay was harmefull, neither could the Prince be blamed of error, who being
deceived by his friend, for the preservation of his own Estate falls to treat
with the Enemy; that therefore they ought to think of advancing, and having an
eye to the Imperialists proceedings, not to shun an occasion of Battle; that
they should succor Saxony where it had need of them; or by Invading Bohemia,
recall Walesteine from his designs upon Misnia. These conceptions carrying
more of weight and substance with them in the present conjuncture of time, then
did the other, won the approbation of all: so as the King (leaving fitting
orders for the good government of those Towns) went from Erfurt, the
Inhabitants whereof running a vye to see the Kings preparations, and upon their
knees doing reverence to him, they powered their prayers to Heaven out for him,
and with much acclamation and confidence wished him good fortune. 'Twas observed
that the King being troubled at this their behavior, broke forth into these
words; What do these people fancy unto themselves; do they believe me to be a
god? O how they are deceived; we are all mortal; our souls may well be of
steel, but our bodies are of glass; I presage mischief to my self from
hence, and apprehend Divine punishment.

These speeches though proceeding from a King that professed enmity to the
Roman-Catholique Religion, made many know he had a well composed mind: Having
mustered his men (which he found to amount to 16000 Foot and 11000 Horse of
diverse Nations) he gave the Vanguard to the Command of Duke Bernard Waymar,
consisting of 4000 Horse, Dutch and Finlanders, 1000 Dragoones, and 6000 Foot
divided into six Squadrons; he recommended the maine Battle to the Marshall
Kneiphausen, with 6000 Foot divided into three Bodies, and 4000 Horse parted
into eight Squadrons, and he himself kept in the Rear with 1000 choice Horse,
1000 Dragoones and 4000 Foot, every Battaglion of the Vanguard, as likewise of
the Battle, and other Squadrons of the Reserve having 5 Fieldpieces in their
Front. In this order he began his march toward Nurenberg, but having notice by
the way that Walesteine had raised his Forces from before the Castle of Coburg,
that he had taken Leypzig, and that the quartering of his Army extended to
Newburg and weisnfeld, (walled Towns upon the Sala, and upon the Confines of
Saxony) possessing all advantageous places, he lead his Army to Newburg, a
Town seated a little lower upon the said River, toward Erfurt, that he might
make use of that station to join with the Saxon Army, (which was now about
Torgaw, a place belonging to the said Elector, upon the banks of Elb)
consisting of about 12000 Foot and 4000 Horse, to oppose the designs of Holke
and Walesteine, to whom Pappenheim being now joined with 9000 Soldiers, he
notwithstanding kept still in his former quarters, to hinder the Saxons from
joining with the Swedes,

Whilst these went cautiously preparing how they might upon advantage fight
with the Imperialists, the King was by his Scouts advertised, that Walesteine
was gone from Weisnfeld, and had retired himself in close quarter toward
Lutzen, a Village two Leagues off from Leypzig, and that Pappenheim was marched
with part of his Army, toward Hall, to hinder the advancing of George Duke of
Lunenburg* who being sent for by the King, for the better strengthening of his
Camp, made long marches to join with the Saxons, that afterward they might
meet all in one Body with the Swedes. The King resolved not to lose time, but
to make use of that conjuncture which he found fitting for him, to set upon
Walesteine, who being severed from Pappenheim, had weakened himself of the
best bands of his Soldiers, upon whom he might have relied for Victory; so as
the King thought he might easily bring his designs to their wished for end.
He therefore arose from the quarters he had taken, and with flying Colors
marched thither-wards, sending the Finlanders Horse who were then in the Van to
discover the Country, who failed not in their duty; for the Kings commands were
readily obeyed by all his Soldiers, the which they went the more cheerfully
and willingly about, for that they were thereby invited to the hopes of a
glorious Victory, big with booty and reputation.

Walesteine (being a wise Commander) having found the Kings designs, and
foreseen that making use of Pappenheime's absence, he would force him to a
Battle, upon the success whereof, the Sum. Total. lay; and having many and
various thoughts hereupon, weighing duly all that made against him, that he
might go upon secure grounds, he resolved to advise with his Astrologer (whom
he used to trust with his greatest secrets) who found that the Constellations
of that Month were not answerable to the Kings former fortune, or rather that
the Planets seemed to have an ill aspect toward him. Grounding much hereupon,
(for imitating the ancient Romans he had an opinion of A^guries, and was wont
to govern his actions by Astrologicall science which he had studied very
diligently) he resolved to see whither the Stars (which had befriended him at
other times) would now tell truth or no: he then secretly agreed with
Pappenheim, that he should temporise, and that each of them should advise the
other when the King should advance, by the shot of Cannon set purposely in
fitting places, and should by speedy messengers acquaint one another with the
Kings proceedings, and that in this case he should speedily return to his men
toward Lutzen; for he would entertain the Swedes with skirmishes, and so
afford him opportunity to come time enough. The King having made haste with his
marches toward Lutzen, Walesteine gave quickly the sign agreed upon by a
threefold Cannon-shot to Pappenheimes Sentinels, who were placed at fitting
distances to that purpose, and by speedy messengers gave him notice thereof;
and this mean while fearing lest the King might advance further then he
desired he should, he wrought all night in the digging of a Ditch, whereby he
advantaged his station, and filling it with Musketeers, which were flanked by
Cannon, he stood expecting the coming of the Swedes; who arguing by this their
pains, that the Imperialists were afraid, became the bolder. This mean while
diverse skirmishes were made between the Swedish Horse, and Isolani his Crabats,
with equal loss, and herein was passed all the night; the King being by the
break of day, as it were Master of the field; for Walesteine keeping himself
close within his Ditch, would not quit his advantage till Pappenheime should be
come to him.

The King stayed all night armed in the field, not minding what his body
suffered; and being desired by his Captain to repose himself and take some
rest, he answered, That the example of the General sweetens the suffering of
the Soldier; that to forgo his vigilance would show his care over his men to
be but small, and make it seem he did it that he might not feel the
incommodities of his own life; which they who do respect, ought not to be in
the Saddle with foot in stirrope, but at their own homes, upon their
downe-beds; that the troubles of many suited not with the peace and rest of one
alone; that the world appertained to the industrious, not to the sloathfull;
that rest was the daughter of idleness, and peace, labor the mother of glory
and achievements. Thus calling his chief Commanders about a little sire,
(which he had caused be made to moderate the ridgednesse of the night) he in a
sprightly and courageous manner, acquainted them with his intentions of joining
Battle with Walesteine. Some there were that advised him he might do well
to stay for the Forces of Saxony and Lunenburg, and others, who were upon their
march not far from him, with the which he might the more boldly assault the
Enemy; that the Swedes being as well in numbers as in situation short of the
Imperialists, they ought not to hazard the Victories of so many Months, upon
the event of one day; that Walesteine commanded an Army who coveted Battle
incited thereunto by necessity, and out of a desire that they might enjoy the
fruits of so many Victories, which they had not yet forgotten, and driven
thereunto by despair, seeing themselves only subject to sufferings: that
fortune was unconstant, and oft-times a friend to the desperate; that
Walesteine had Commanders under him desirous of revenge, obedient Soldiers,
and who more apprehended their Generals frown then the Swedes Swords; that
Pappenheim was not so far off, but that if he came not time enough to the
Battle, he might come soon enough at least to fall upon the wearied, and so
totally oppress them; that he had people with him ancient in experience, and
advise, but young in respect of their daring and ambition; and that fortune was
obliged to pay tribute to his valor* that respect ought to be had to the
coming up of the Saxon Forces, without which they should fight upon unequal
terms. These reasons though strongly maintained, were notwithstanding
confuted by the King, with lively Arguments made good by the heat of his
desire, and by his will. Too much presuming upon a man's selfe-darkens the
wisdom of the wisest. He replied that Pappenheime was very far off; that
Walesteines Army was now dismembered, both of Men and Commanders, and that it
did not exceed the number of 30000 fighting men; that this might be said to be
an occasion offered by fortune, which ought to be taken by the foretop* setting
upon the Enemy before he should be more encouraged by access of greater
Forces; for that Walesteine being beaten, they might be sure to beat
Pappenheime; that to expect the coming of the Saxons and Lunibergheses, was a
certain loss of time, and an appearance of fearing the Enemy; that the same
time which went to the bringing of them unto the Swedes, did not inhibit
Pappenheime and others from joining with the Roman-Catholiques, so as they
should be still upon the same terms; that in war occasion was not to be
fore-slowed; that Fortune was painted with a lock in the forehead, to show she
ought to be laid hold off; that there was no fitter time to set upon an Enemy,
then when he was discovered to be apprehensive; that Walesteine was so; who by
fortifying himself, endeavored to shun giving Battle; that he himself
would show the way to any one that should be backward; that temporising was
then good when advantage might be had by delay; that when an Enemy has put on
fear, he must not be suffered to dis-robe himself thereof; and on the
contrary, when ones own men are encouraged, the time which timely shows it
self ought not to be let slip.

These speeches coming feelingly from a King, kept all his Commanders from
opposing them; and for that it was a national custom for Subjects to suit
with the inclination of their Princes, they durst say no more in opposition,
either not to seem cowards by dissuading from a business that bore danger with
it, or lest the King should take the more notice of such as did oppose his
reasons. Therefore, everyone applauding what he had said, they speedily
withdrew themselves to their Colors, to order their Battaglions, and to
encourage their people. Wherefore the King hasting upon the first entrance of
Lutzen fields, did thus order his Army.

The plain of Lutzen, extends it self for the space of one League from the
North to the South, and is girt about from the West to the North by certain
Woods, which divide it from another plain: toward the North-side thereof is
the Village Cursits, which amidst the descent of a pleasant Strond that runs
in Crookes, sometimes more, sometimes less, is rather an Ornament, then
hinderance unto it: Amidst certain Hills there lies another space of ground
toward the South-East, which parts Cursits and Lutzen; on the East Side
stands Lutzen, from whence a plain arising, the space between the East and
South is backed by a delightful ascent of Hills: The broadest part of the
plain falling down between the West and the South, affords a Prospect not
bounded by the eye: About a League from Lutzen lies a ridge of Hills environed
by a little Rivolet; thence from West to East there runs a Trench almost
demolish't; at the end whereof, not far from the Village stands a little
house, which serves for a shelter to the Inhabitants of four Wind-mils seated
on the ridge of those Hills.

Upon the left wing of the Vanguard led on by his Majesty, who kept before it
with some of his Domestic Servants, not attired like a Prince, but clad in
plain Spanish Leather, upon a dapple gray Horse, were 3000 Horse, all Goths
and Findlanders (old Soldiers) divided into six Squadrons, under the
Colonells, Vansleben, Ruthen, and Wistumb, Gentlemen of tried experience;
amongst which were mingled five Ranks of Musketeers, between the one and the
other Flank to play upon the Enemies Horse, before they should come within
Pistol-shot: All these were well mounted, armed with Curasses, Pistols and
broad Swords like Faulchions, which being drawn, and held up by them in their
bridle-hand, did by the reflection of the Sun, add to the luster of their
Squadrons, and to the terror of the lookers on: These were followed by four
Battaglions of Dutch and Swedish Foot, who marching in equal distances, from
the one Flank to the other, were appointed for the reserve, part of them in
black Cassocks, part in Yellow, under 28 Ensigns, all garnished with the Kings
Arms, to which were joined the Regiments of Vincher, Reglingem, and Duke
Waymer, led on by Vildesteime, under 18 Ensigns; these were all commanded by
Count Waissemburg a Duch-man, who marched with his Pike in his hand four paces
before them; In the Battle it self, other four Bodies of Foot marched with a
large Front; and these marched after the former, so as they might without
confusion enter into the void place of the one or the other Flanks; they
belonged to the Regiments of Stechnits, Breesteime, Lunisteime, Steimbech, and
Hanalt, all of them chief heads of the Army, under 34 Ensigns, led on by
these Commanders clothed in glittering apparel, (an observation had in time of
Battle, that they might be the better known) with each of them a Pike in his
hand. On the left Flank were other 3000 Dutch Horse divided into six Squadrons,
furnished with Curasses, Pistols, Swords, and Pole-axes, which had on the one
side a Hammer, and on the other a wreathen point of Iron, wherwithall to throw
Troopers off Horse^back, pulling them therewithal, either by their clothes, or
by the buckles of their Armor. These were led on by Duke Bernard Waymer, who
rid before them on a Sorrel Horse, with a Curasse on his back, and accompanied
with two Cornets of Gentlemen of worth, who desirous to learn the art of
warfare kept near him, and amongst these were five Ranks of Musketeers,
mingled for the aforesaid purpose; amongst which were the Regiments of the
Kings Guard, under 22 Standards of the Colonells Coleberg, Curlander,
Branghells, Wishawsem, and Corfilice: Before the right Flank were 20 pieces of
field Cannon placed, and as many before the left, to shoot bags of Bullets; the
greater Artillery, to the number of 26. Being placed in the midst of the Front
of the Foot Battaglions; Marshall Kniphausen led on the Rear mounted on a
brown Bay* composed of English, Scottish, and French Regiments, belonging to
the Colonells Mila^i Chrestorfe, Torre, Hassia, Kniphausen, Offckercken, and
Duke William of Waymer, under 52 Ensigns, divided into four Bodies, sour in
a square form, four with a long Front, and often Squadrons of Horse and
Dragoones, five upon the right hand commanded by the Colonells Oemens, Bosse,
Isalers, and Agafelt, before which, Armed at all pieces, did the Baron
Offckercken march, and amongst these diverse Ranks of Musketeers. The left
Wing likewise contained five Squadrons of Horse belonging to the Regiments of
Peckerman, Balarches, Galdesteim, Plato, and Duke William of Waymers; on the
Front whereof marched these Gentlemen, followed by some of their Comrades, very
well Armed and Horst. His Army being thus ordered, and having called before him
all the chief of his Army, and acquainted them with what orders he intended to
have kept that day, commanding Psalms to be sung throughout the whole Camp,
and Prayers to be made to God for Victory, he got upon an ambling Nag, spotted
black and white, and twice rode about and surveyed all his Squadrons,
enlivening them all with his affable behavior, sweetness of speech, and
cheerful countenance, telling them how confidently he relied upon their known
valor, how weak the Enemy was, encouraging them through the hope of booty,
this being the end of all their labors, the perfection of their glory, and the
accomplishment of their greatness, which when they should obtain, nothing
could stand between them and the Crown of Victory; whereunto, being by all of
them answered with joyful acclamations, it was observed that some, as if they
had presaged what was to ensue, said unto him; Oh Sir, have a care of your
Person, and fear not us; to which he answering, "My Valiant and beloved
Compagnions, we have hitherto had but our first course, courage, now we are to
expect the banquet; and making the Baggage women and boys, who were mingled
amongst the Troops to be set a far off, he himself being got upon a dun
Horse, the Army moved (enheartned by the sound of warlike instruments, and with
cheerful martiall-like phrases, whereby every one was encouraged) and thus he
advanced toward the Caesarians.

Neither was Walesteine wanting in vigilance, but having received news that
Pappenheim had faced about, and was marching apace toward him, having
calculated the time aright, and finding that he would come in very opportunely,
he advised with his chief Co^manders, whether he should resolve to give the
King Battle, or keep undeneath Leypzig, and endeavor to overcome the Enemy,
rather by Famine then by Sword. They all resolved upon fighting, and that they
should in no ways turn their back upon the Swedes, who would thereby be the
more encouraged seeing their King marched resolutely in their Front. He
therefore upon the break of day drew forth his Army likewise, and appeared in
Battle array before the Swedish Vanguard, who with their Field Cannon were now
in sight; and toward noone were come near Lutzen, about the Wind-mils;
Walesteine had upon his left Flank a great Squadron of Crabats and Hungarians
mounted upon very fleet Horses, commanded by Isolani, with 28 Standards of
various Colors; after which, followed three Squadrons of Curassiers belonging
to Cornemberg, Ghetz, Deffart, Tersica and Bredaw. The Front of the Battle was
a great body of Foot belonging to Count Bertaldo Walesteine, Chisisa, Colorido,
and Duke Lavell, men of experienced wisdom, with 25 several Ensigns, before
which seven pieces of great Cannon were drawn, and behind them marched two
other Battaglions of Foot, drawn out of the Regiments of Gallasse, Grana,
Holke, Gu^is, Contees, Prainer, and other Colonells, all of them Gentlemen of
great hope, and good birth, under 32 Colors: These Foot were backed on the
right hand by Squadrons of Horse belonging to Octavius Picolomini, Marquess
Gonsaga, Strozzi, and Coronino, (all of them valiant Gentlemen, and reputed for
the best Swordmen of all the Army) under 24 Standards, followed by many Ranks
of Musketeers; and near these, above the Wind-mills, the way was shut up by
other two Squadrons of Horse belonging to Count Jerome Coloredo, Rachemburg,
Spor, Schamburg, and Offcuts, all of them Chieftaines of good esteem under 33
Cornets who had near unto them another Battaglion of Foot newly raised by the
Baron Done, Montecuculi and Tersica, under 16 Ensigns guarded behind with a
Squadron of Crabats and Dragoones under 15 Standards of Frocats a Gentleman of
worth. Another body of Foot marched in the Rear commanded by the Counts,
Maximilian Walesteine, (the Generals Nephew) Contrees and other two Regiments
of Fucary, and the Duke of Sacen, with 22 Ensigns; and upon the left wing
hereof other 3 Squadrons of Curasiers under 30 Standards led by the Colonels
Maracini and Harcourt, and these were flanked by 10 other Ensigns of Crabats
and Hungarians. The Artillery with a good guard of Musketeers was placed over
the ditch in the field, and 17 other pieces upon the little hill near the
Wind-mils. Gallasse marched in the Van, having on his right Flank and on his
left the Sergeant Majors general of the Battle, Cornemberg and Deffart.
Offcutz led on the Foot, the Generalissimo Walesteine followed in the midst of
the Battle accompanied by Princes of Tuscany, by Michena Commissary-generall,
and by an infinite number of Counts and Volunteers; Count Shamburg, and Rinoch
commanded the left Wing of the Battle, and the Seignior d'Harcourt, and
Diodati Quartermaster general, brought up the Rear. Walesteine having thus
ordered his Army and acquainted all his Commanders with what orders he would
have kept in fighting with the King, after he had caused Mass to be Celebrated
through his whole Camp, and had encouraged his Soldiers with words expressing
hope, honor, and greatness, He lighted out of his Coach, and mounted a
brown-bay Gennet expecting to be set upon by the Swedes.

The Horse by this time began to exchange Pistoll-shot on both sides, and the
Imperialists Artillery began to play a pace upon the enemies Squadrons in the
Flank, and the Kings saluted the Imperialists, who upon the rise of the hill
lay open to the annoyance of the hale of bullets which flew from their Cannon,
so as the Fray began to be very hot; for the Foot being come to the brinke of
the Ditch, and in their advancing, orderly discharging their Muskets, the King
Commanded the Regiments of his Guard to pass over it, and he himself was in
readiness to second them with 4 Squadrons of Horse of the right Wing. Here the
Files of the Swedes battaglions being opened, and the Field pieces loaded with
bags of Musket-bullets playing upon the Caesarians, and very much gawling them,
the Swedes were ready to pass over; but 4 battaglions of the Romanists
standing close to their tackling, made good by the Horse, letting showers of
Musket Shot fly upon the Swedes with their Cannon bearing down whole Files of
the Enemy, and with their Pikes sloaped throwing them down from the top of the
Trench, and one File supplying the place of another, the fight grew to that
heat as it lasted for half an hour; when the Swedes not able to pass over
(hindered by the ditch and Muskets playing upon them) began to give back* but
the King, who stood looking on expecting the issue, that when these should have
made the way, he with the Horse might follow upon the Imperialists, foreseeing
what prejudice such a retreat might make* thrusting on the Regiments of Count
de Torre, and the Prince of Hannault, nay, lighting off horse himself and
taking a Pike in his hand, he made toward them, crying out unto them; And what
is become of my Soulders valor? who having waded through so many Rivers,
scaled so many Walls, and overcome so many difficulties, cannot now win a dry
ditch? these words so much inheartened the Soldiers, as that jointly
answering, Ah Sir, keep your Majesty aloof off, and fear not us who are your
faithful Servants, have only a care unto your self, and leave the care of
this to us, they threw themselves headlong down into the ditch; where the
Austrians no less encouraged by Walesteines arivall, who reproving them, for
that they should (having a breast work to defend them) fear that Enemy, which
upon equal terms they had made no account of; and putting his Captains in
mind, that now it was time to give proof of their valor, and experience; and
every one of them being much more ambitious of being accounted valiant, then
fearful of death, making good their stations and encouraging each other, the
Battle grew so fierce that the one and the other of them breaking their Pikes
and bloudying their Swords, great was the slaughter, the groans of the wounded
horrible, the loss of companions deplorable, and the number of dead bodies
nauseous and a hinderance; at last the Swedes encouraged each other with loud
shouts of Victory, Victory, and the Regiments of Winchell, and Sticknitz
coming in unto them, the following Files making good the place of those that
were slain in the former, they got at last through the Trench, and passed on
into the midst of Walesteines Forces. Here the Caesarian Horse hasting in, in
close ranks, and giving upon the Swedes Foot, with their Swords in hand, who
were not seconded by their Horse, by reason of the difficulty they found in
descending the ditch, yet with their Musket Shot and Pikes withstanding the
violence of the Enemy, and charging upon the Imperialists Horse, coming on all
sides close up unto them and breaking their first Ranks, the Imperialists
broke in upon them with such violence, as that the wounded and half dead being
by the Horse trod underfoot, and the strong and able cut in pieces by the
Sword, both these Battaglions were little less then consumed, with so much
honor though, as that witnessing their loyalty, and writing it in Characters
of blood, it is worthy observation, that many Soldiers as they lay gasping and
giving up the ghost did notwithstanding with their Swords prick the horses in
the bellyes that trampled upon them, making it thereby be seen that the
apprehension of death accompanies not valiant Soldiers to their grave. But the
Swedish Horse being by this time come in to second their Companions, and the
King supplying the fight with new Battaglions of Foot; and the Imperialists
being no less diligent on their sides, the Battle grew hotter then before,
one Battaglion fighting with another not only with Muskets but with Pikes, yea
single Swords. Whilst on this side blows were thus dealt about, the Duke of
Waymer appeared no less hardy on the other side, nor the Imperialists less
courageous, for Levisteimes, Steimbechs, and Bristeimes Foot being advanced
against Granas, Fucari, Holke, and Prainers Regiments led on by Gallasse, the
hurley burley was no less violent on this side then on the right Flank. For
the Swedish Foot, giving on in close Rancks upon the Millers houses, and the
Ditch manfully made good by the Romanists, and the Caesarian Cannon from the
Wind-mills, and the Swedish Cannon which were planted just against them,
playing reciprocally one upon another, though the Imperialists shot, playing
upon the Swedes on the Flank, did them small hurt, yet were they so withstood
by Musket shot, and by the valor of the Austrian Commanders, as Waymer seeing
he was not able to effect his intended design, left Caleburgh, Corlander, and
Theishansem, for a Conduct to the Foot, whilst he in the head of Corfilier, and
Franghels Regiment, seconded by Vildesteimes Regiment of Foot, facing about to
that part which lies between L^^zen and the Wind-mills, fell upon the
Imperialists on the flank, and so renewed the fight, which grew so hot on all
sides, as nothing but clouds of smoke and lightnings of fire were to be
discerned. At this time when the victory though very bloody, appeared most on
the Swedish side, the King being advertised that Pappenheimes men began now to
appear, and had already charged some of the light Horse of the Rear-guard;
surprised at this unexpected accident, and madded to see so much time spent in
passing the ditch Walestein had made, (and which he thought not would have been
of such use) galloped to the Front of the Rear, and having given the Commanders
charge what orders they should keep in fighting with these fresh Forces of
Pappenheim, longing to know their state and condition, though the Baron
Offchercheim Lieutenant-generall of the Horse, cried out unto him more then
once, I beseech you Sir, set not so small a value upon your own life, I beg it
here of you in the midst of all your Army, and do it for the common good of all
your Soldiers and Servants, leave the care of discovering the Enemies
condition to me, and to this Sword* yet not weighing his words nor the
supplications of the rest, but spurring forward with some of his domesticke
Servants, and with the Regiment of Horse which was then his own Guard, having
discryed the Enemy, and being with some few advanced to discover them, a
certain Troop of Horse of Piccolominies Regiment being sent before with other
bands of Horse to hasten Pappenheim^ to come and join with them, to discover
the Country, and learn the Swedes condition, meeting with him, who went in the
head of his Regiment, and at their very first discharging of their Pistols,
fortune would so have it, as that one Bullet hit the King on the arm, and
another underneath the right shoulder, wherewith falling from off his horse, he
forthwith dyed.

That this was the end of so brave a King, no greater certainty is known then
from the mouth of a Page which was then with him; there being at that time but
only two more with him, who ran the same fortune as the King did; for he was
so far before the Squadron that followed him, as that they could not see how
the mischief happened.

The news of this so great loss, being presently noysed throughout the Army,
was likely to have bred some disorder, but Waymer cloaking the business; by
suffering his body to lie in the Field, and giving it out that he was not dead,
but that he was taken Prisoner, and that it became his Soldiers to fight
manfully that they might rescue him, the Swedes were so exasperated thereby,
and the Commanders so incensed, as not thinking any death more glorious, then
that wherein they should accompany their Lord and Master, They placed
themselves in the heads of their Regiments, and Duke Waymer in particular
placed himself in the head of the Blew Regiment, and reco^mending the fight
about the Wind-mils, to Ruthen and Waisemberg, advanced toward Pappenheim. So
likewise did all the other Commanders against Walesteines Squadrons, who though
they were with equal valor withstood by the Imperialists, yet were the
Imperialists thereby much indammaged. Pappenheim, who in the head of his
Vangard flew upon the Swedes that were led on by Kniphausen, in the beginning
of the conflict was wounded with a Cannon-shot, whereof he shortly after died,
as he was carried in a Coach toward Stalla to be cured.

The loss of this Commander was no less direful to the Caesarian Camp, then
was the loss of the King to the Swedes; wherefore Walesteine dispatched
suddenly a Piemontesse Captain to Major General Rinoch, with order, that he
should charge with the Horse that was kept for reserve suddenly upon the
Swedes, who were in some confusion by reason of their Kings death, which Waymer
could not keep concealed. The Piemontesse inquired of Rinoch how affairs went,
who answered, very ill-favouredly, for that Pappenheim had received his deaths
wound, and the Battle was lost, which though he said it only to him, yet was
it suddenly noysed abroad through the whole Camp, who were thereat struck with
fear. So as Rinoch, that he might not hazard his men but upon some ground, and
that he might see what the issue of the Battle would be, kept his station,
observing which way the fortue of the day would incline, before he would
further engage himself, and instead of falling upon the Enemy, forbore further
advancing, which was a great cause of the Swedes safety, for many of the
Roman-Catholique Commanders and Soldiers being hereby cast down and afraid,
they began to give back, leaving the field to the Enemies Horse, which
desperately pursued them.

Walesteine, perceiving how his Soldiers ran toward Lutzen to save
themselves, fired the Town, as well to obviat the disorder as for his farther
security on that side; and he himself came to the head of his men, to make
them fight again, with threatening punishment, and promising reward; but it was
impossible for him to make them stand, such fear had Pappenheime's death
infused into them, and a rumor that said the Battle is lost, we are all
undone. Piccolominy seeing the confusion, and facing the Enemy, though he had
tired four horses and was now upon the fifth, and though his blood ran down
through the wounds he had received, and that he was desired by the other
Commanders to retire himself, to whom he answered, that blood shed upon such
occasions hightens glory, and gives proof of loyalty; no whit declining in his
resolution, but encouraging his men, and gathering unto them those who were
elsewhere disbanded, and forsaken by their own Commanders, showed himself
miraculously worthy, and made it appear that in times of greatest danger
generous minded men ought to give testimony of their valor. This did abate the
Enemies eagerness, and afforded Walesteine and Gallasse opportunity to
re-order some confused Squadrons, and to withstand the Swedes Charge; who being
acertained of their Kings death, and the Imperialists being again reunited,
there falling at that very instant likewise (which was about an hour before
Sunset) a very thick fog or mist, which played the part of a charitable
mediatresse, they fearing lest by further engaging themselves they might run
upon some disadvantage, resolved to make a stand, and to make good their
ground, and press no further forward. Walesteine likewise finding himself
abandoned by many of his Captains, some of which were fled, some dead, and
some wounded, and all his Camp full of confusion for Pappenheimes death, (who
was generally beloved) and that neither he nor his Commands were obeyed,
resolved to keep in his station without any further attempt; so as the one and
the other of them contenting themselves with the advantage of their situations,
they afterward withdrew into their own quarters. Thus ended the Battle of
Lutzen, fought on the 16th of November, which was not partial either to the
one or to the other side, Nov. 16.
for each of them kept master of their own ground, and the loss was in a
manner equal. Yet was the Kings death prised by the Caesarians, at as high a
rate as whatsoever victory, and so indeed it proved, for with him perished the
Swedes good fortune, the Soldiers obedience ceased, disorders sprung up*
dissentions were bred amongst Commanders, and ambition of precedence, diversity
of opinions, difference of Counsels, envy of actions, and dissonancy of
confederacyes were stirred up.

There perished in this days fight of both sides about 10000 Soldiers, it is
not known of which side most, and many Colonels and Commanders of esteem, of
which there were wounded of the Imperialists side (who afterward dyed)
Bartaldo Walesteine, and Colonel Chiese; and of the Swedes, Brundesteim,
Winckell, and diverse others: the action lasted from Sun rising to an hour
before Sun set; the greatest slaughter and execution was about noone; the
Imperialists left some pieces of great Cannon upon the field, for want of
horses to draw them off; the Baggage was not touched either by the one, or the
other side; yet it is true the Imperialists baggage was much damnified by fire,
which lightning in the Ammunition blew up many, and slew many that were the
Guard thereof.

THe Battle of Lutzen being thus ended, the Swedish Commanders greatly
confused for the loss of their King, and very weary by reason of the pains
they had taken, resolved to withdraw themselves to Wisenfells; where before
they took any refreshment, being all assembled together, and having each with
other condoled their Kings death, at last they paused; and having dried their
tears, they like undaunted Chiefetaines (the constancy of their hearts not
failing them for all this so important an accident, nor having the clearenesse
of their wisdom darkened by the gastlinesse of death and fear, but rather
(which was worthy of remarke) comforting each other, and moderating each others
grief, it was at last propounded by Duke Waymer, whether they should hault in
expectance of Saxony, Laneberg, and other Forces already on their march toward
them, or else before their heat were cooled, or their Swords sheathed, they
should pursue the Enemy, astonished through the deaths and flight of their men;
the importancy of this business being very well weighed, there were some that
advised, That without further consideration they ought to pursue Walesteine,
before by new recruits he might take to the Field again; that these were of
the number of such advantageous occasions as were not to be let slip; that the
Swedes were enraged at their Kings death; that revenge by pursuing of the
Imperialists, was that which by the general applause of the Soldiers was
desired and thirsted after; that this the Soldiers daring was wonderful
advantageous; that if their Prince were lost, they ought not at least to
abandon the Victory up on which the common good depended, that it behoved them
who loved the Kings life not to forget his death. Whilst the greatest part of
the Commanders were pondring such conceptions as these, the outcry of the
Soldiers, who like so many enraged men broke in, asking where the King was,
thundering in the ears of the Generals, and every one agreeing in opinion of
prosecuting the Enemy (and this the rather, for that the news just then came
of the Duke of Lunebergs arivall at Affendorfe, a Village within four hours
march of them) after they had cried up (and by the joint applause of all the
Militia) chosen Duke Waymer for their General, who was deservedly beloved by
them all, and a Prince both for birth and courage deserving such a charge, it
was resolved, that that very night, Offchirch should go with some of the Horse
into the Field to recover the Body; and the Soldiers being refresh't with
Victuals and Wine (of which there was great store found in Wisenfells) the
Swedes appeared again the next morning in Battle Array upon the same plain.
The Sun was two hours high before they could find the Kings Body; which when
they found, was stripped, and so dis-figured and mangled with blood, and the
being trampled on by Horses, as hardly could they know it; it was with doleful
lamentations of the whole Army put into a Coach, and sent with a good guard to
Neuburg, and from thence to Hall.

The Swedes having here got some Cannon, which for want of Horses were left
behind by the Imperialists, and some Crabats which were come to fetch them off,
being put to flight, Offchirch pursued them, but Walesteine, who was then at
Leypzyg, expecting the arrival of some Regiments who were not in the Battle,
and the recruiting of the disbanded Forces, with those of Holke, to whom he had
sent to come to him* being hereof informed by his Scouts, he called a Council
of War, wherein he demanded the opinion of all his Commanders, whether they
should make good the station where they were, or else retreat. Somewere of
opinion, That to retreat, was rather a sign of loss then Victory; that they
pretended to be Victors, and therefore it mis-became them to ^lye from those
whom they gave out they had beaten; that they had a safe refuge within the
Walls of Leypzig, if they should apprehend danger in the Field; that they might
there expect Holkes arrival, and other Soldiers from the neighboring parts,
by which addition they should not be short of the Swedes in number, might to
the field again and Crown their Victory: Walesteine was well enough inclined
hereunto, but it being known that there was not in Leypzig two days Victuals
for the Soldiers; that the people therein adhered unto the Swedes; that the
Duke of Saxony being not far off upon his march, might s^ut up the passage
into Bohemia; that the Swedes being grieved would in a desperate manner fly
upon them; and that it was much better for them to expect what effect the Kings
death would work, then to fall to blows with them, who thought they could not
lose their lives better then in accompanying their King; seeing moreover how
the Swedes had received new Forces from Saxony; not finding any advantage in
staying any longer in that City with their men who were wearyed, and somewhat
affrighted by the cowardice of some Officers who some few days after paid for
their Treachery in Prage, he resolved to be gone; and therefore having reviewed
his Forces, and given them new orders, he sent them toward Borne near Pleise,
and he himself followed them that very day in the Rear with Troops conducted
by some Colonells, who were not so much wounded as were the rest. Other
Companies of Horse came up afterward unto him, who being abroad to inform
themselves of the Enemies condition, were not at the Battle: And having
exhorted the Citizens to be mindful of gratitude, promising, that if they
would so do, he would keep good correspondency with them, (as should appear
upon any future occasion) he marched toward Bohemia, intending to Winter in
that Kingdom, and in the mean time to expect what effects the Kings death
would produce

The news of the Kings death was suddenly spread every where, and the success
thereof was confusedly discoursed of in diverse parts; those who never heard
that a King ran any hazard in a Battle, were strangely and unusually
astonished; to many the news seemed an illusion or Chimera, a very dream;
neither could it fall into their im^g^nation, that that King could be slain,
who not long before was surrounded with Victories and Triumphs, and who seemed
not only to have persuaded Fortune to partiality, but to have subdued her.
Others would have it, that this was but news given abroad, to know what men
would think thereof, and that the King was privately gone into Swethland;
which secret departure of his was given out for his death. All the Protestant
Princes were much cast down, at this so important advertisement; words are not
able to express the grief which this loss caused in the Hauns Towns. There
were many who wept for eight days together, and would take no sustenance; the
Country people and Garrison-Souldiers moved pity, whilst flocking together,
and full of fear, scratching their heads, and looking like so many Lambs that
had lost their flock, they ran like mad men up and down calling upon their
King.

The resentments of all other Princes were but shadows in respect of the
Elector of Saxonies sorrow, being struck almost dead at the news thereof; he
spared not for tears or sighs, but broke forth into such like speeches as
this; The King of all valiant hearts is dead, the German liberty has lost its
only prop. There was not any one in France, England nor Holland, who was not
grieved at this misfortune. Those Kings and Princes confessed a gallant King was
dead, and that they had not words sufficient to express the grief they
thereat conceived: there was not any Nobleman, or Common Subject in those
Provinces who did not commisserate his loss: the Papists and those that were
his Enemies, durst not hold up their heads as seeming to rejoice; the fame of
his valor and of his civil comportments had not only captivated the good
will of his Soldiers, and his own Subjects, but even the like of strangers
and his very Enemies; never was Prince so beloved as he, those who had never
seen his Majesticall person coveted to enjoy the sight thereof in effigies.
Painters were never so much set on work, as in drawing this Prince his
picture, every one desired to have it; when it was brought down into any
Country where it had not formerly been seen, the bringer of it was sure to
want no visiters. There was not any one in Germany (Noble or not Noble) who did
not make more esteem of it, then of any other picture in his house; the French,
English and Italians never stuck for price so they might have a Copy. He was
tall of stature, somewhat corpulent, of a Majesticall aspect, which wrought in
men reverence, admiration, love, and fear; his countenance was fair, mixed
with red, his hair and beard flaxen, insomuch as he was called by many the
Yellow King: he was not full out eight and thirty years old; from his Infancy
he was addicted to war, desirous of renown, and ambitious of good repute; in
all his actions he expressed wisdom, in all his speeches graceful eloquence,
in all his treaties affability; in his enterprises boldness, in business
constancy, in difficult affairs discretion, in battles courage, in dangers
undauntednesse, upon occasions watchfulness. In fine he was a Prince who knew
all, and understood all. Never was Commander served with greater applause and
affection: he gave satisfaction to every one, either with praise, promises, or
affability: praiseworthy actions were by him written in Characters not to he
razed out; he forgot not services received; he was pleasant in his discourse,
not costly in his entertainments. He did not disdain to speak with all men*
and many times as he walked before his people, and his Soldiers, he would ask
them how they did, what they did, and what they would have? every private
Cavalier or Commander was admitted to his Table, and to his Chamber; he had
wont to say that the Table was the rack to wrest out secrets, the net
wherewithal to take affection and friendship: he no ways coveted ceremonies
nor complements, and if any one not knowing his humor should use any such with
him, he would in a jesting manner bid them keep their Courtship for the Queens
Ladies; for that he was in the field to teach to fight, not to learn to dance:
he was very severe in punishing the Soldiers insolency, very dilligent in
providing for the safety of his own men: when he took any City belonging to
any Roman-Catholique, he would answer such Commanders as would advise him to
lay heavy taxes upon the Citizens, and impose new laws upon them; This is now
my City, it belongs no more unto the Enemy; I am come to unfetter every man's
liberty, not to imprison them; let them live as best pleases them, and as they
have formerly done: I change no laws to such as know how to live in those
laws that Religion has ingrafted in them; new shoes do often times pinch
the foot too much. He made no difference in his treatings between Protestants
and Roman-Catholiques; he showed himself equally affectionat to the one and
to the orher, affirming, That they were all the workmanship of God: that he
thought every one believed well that observed the Kings laws; that it was not
the work of a Prince to instruct his people how to keep out of hell, but that
it belonged to Ecclesiastical persons and Ministers of Gods word to do that:
whence it ensued that the Romanists losing nothing but their native Prince, and
that Protestants regaining their liberty of Conscience, his Empire and dominion
was desired by the one and by the other: like a Philosophying Soldier, to
witness the greatness of his mind, he never endeavored the perfecting of
any enterprise wherein his Soldiers might not run some hazard; he was angry
with those who would advise him to be careful of his life and person; he
thought the thought of death misbecame a Prince professing Arms; that the
fancies of saving ones self were Counsels proffered by fear; he called them
happy who dyed in their vocations; said death was a Voluntier who took pay of
those that feared him most. Great were the designs of his taking up Arms; but
after the victory of Leypzig they grew very vast, for he aspired at the Empire
of Germany, which when he should have gotten he thought it too narrow a bounds
to his Commands, unless he should enlarge them over Italy, and other regions
of Europe, yea, peradventure over the Ottoman Empire. The Lord Paul Tresborg
(who was his Ledger Ambassador at Constantinople, and in his return homeward
lay at my house) told me the very Turks began to apprehend the fortune and
valor of this King; he had wont often times to say, that our predecessors having
had so valiant Commanders, and effecting so great enterprises, he wondered how
now the world was impoverished of such men, and that this was the reason why
many undertakings failed of performance: to which being answered that this was
occasioned through the diverse use of Arms, and manner of waging war, and the
goodness of strong holds; he replied, that the diversity of Arms was nothing
to be esteemed, but the diversity of hearts; that all Alexanders enterprises
might be effected, Hanibals victories obtained, and Caesar's progresses be made,
if the heart of Alexander, the mind of Haniball and Caesar's daring were to be
found. In two years space this valiant King drew over to side with him or else
won two hundred ninty six Cities, Fortresses and walled Towns, which formerly
obsequiously reverenced the Scepter of the Emperor Ferdinand the second. He
won many victories in the field, but that of Leypzig crowned and immortalized
his glory, since therein he overcame the worthiest and most victorious
Commander of this our age, and an Army which grown gray headed in Arms, and
sufferings, knew not what it was to be worsted.

By how much the Protestant party was afflicted at this great loss, and the
rest who envyed the Austrian greatness, so much were the Imperialists, and
Churchmen consolated thereby; for though many more curious then others
listened with delight to the actions of the King, applauding them rather as
things unusual, the present times not having known a King who would himself
in person fight in the first Files against his Enemy; yet the fear of his
proceedings, the doubt of having their rest and riches turned into labor and
misery, the certainty of having great taxations and contributions laid upon
them to sustain the Caesarian unsinew'd authority were very fitting occasions
to cancel the affection they bore to the worth of this King, and to rekindle
their hatred and envy of him; as was seen by the demonstrations they made in
bonefires, music and all other outward shows of joy, which gave the
Protestants occasion of much murmurre, who said thus to rejoice for the death
of a man was barbarous, execrable, and inhumane; yet many there were that
slighted these Jubilies, saying that his glory was the greater, by how much
more estimation they put upon his loss.

Yet amongst these mirths and jollities the Imperialists were not free from
paying tribute of some tears, for they were very sensible of the death of
Godfrey Count Pappenheime, and more particularly the Ecclesiastical Princes
about Westfalia, who had been by him and his worth defended against the
imminent and inevitable dangers that threatened them, bewailing (as it became
them) the loss of a benefactor, more then rejoicing at the like of an Enemy,
were much afflicted thereat. Their lamentation could not be held back, by
their rejoicing for the Kings death; which not being thereby allayd, shows the
force of their affection to this Commander.

Godfrey Count Pappenheime was by birth an Alman, of noble Parentage, and
excellent education: he applied himself from his first years to the wars,
and passing though all degrees of preferment, he at last arrived to the Command
of being one of Caesar's Colonels, a place of great esteem and no small
consequence; the first proofs he gave of his worth and valor was in the
defense of Riva di Chianena, in the Valtaline, which was played upon by the
French, where he raised his renown, and made men curious to inquire after his
future actions; behaving himself afterward no less courageously in Germany,
he appeared more worthy to command then to serve; and therefore being advanced
to the place of Lieutenant-generall of the Catholic League he did more then
satisfy the expectation that was had of him.

In the most difficult actions he was courageous, in advers fortune not moved,
in making of matches politic, in deliberation bold, in Counsel well advised,
modest in victory, severe in execution, in his dealings affable; in fine he was
in all things vigilant, expert, valiant, merciful, and magnanimous; the many
scarres wherewith his face was adorned, were the Characters wherein his good
service was written; the love and reverence the Soldiers bore him testified
his civil and noble carriage; the good repute his very Enemies had of him
published his ineffable worth to be without spot; his estimation and renown
were the Trumpets of his valor and experience. Germany has not produced a
private Gentleman of so mature an understanding* of so diligent a mind, of so
sprightly a wit, nor one so generous: he never undertook any enterprise,
before he had well weighed what the event and consequence thereof might be; he
met with no difficulty, which he found not some means to overcome* he prised
not any preferment, profit, or interest, wherein his particular person was
concerned; he was held to be in all things zealous to his masters service,
desirous of reputation, and ambitious of glory; he had wont to say to some of
his friends, who would persuade him to be more sparing of the monyes that were
paid him; that to deserve well of a Prince did not consist in having ones
chests full of Gold; that Soldiers loved not there, where their Captains were
too mindful of themselves; that a faithful Servant could have no more
glorious title then that of Banckrout; in fine he had a soul to which nothing
was wanting but a body of Sovereignty that therein might be seen, whatsoever of
good, wise, courteous, or conscious, may be desired in a Prince; he was
renowned by his Soldiers, admired by his Companions; he gratified Princes, and
deserved very well of the Roman-Catholique League, and of all the house of
Austria.

The Imperialists being gone from Leypzig, Offchirch hasted with three
Regiments of Horse, and presented himself before the gates thereof: the
Inhabitants received him quickly within their walls, as well out of the duty they
ought to the Duke of Saxony their natural Prince, as out of the love they bore
to those of the Protestant party. In the Castle there was a Garrison of the
Imperialists, wherefore Offchirch sent a Trumpet to the Governor thereof,
threatening fire and sword if he would not surrender; but he not failing in his
loyalty, being an experienced Soldier, and well verst in war, refused to do
it, and prepared to defend it; whereupon the Swedes drawing that very night
near the ditch, raised up works of earth, and the next morning began to play
upon the walls thereof with their Cannon.

In an other part, some Companies of Saxon Horse and some others of the Duke of
Lunenburg, (who came to reinforce the Swedish Army) thinking to come time
enough to the Battle, understanding that not many of the Emperors Soldiers
were left in Chemnitz, a Town seated upon the River Chemnitz, (which coming
sorth from the furthermost bounds of Bohemia toward the South, falls into
Mulda, another River of the said Province, which taking its beginning from the
Mountains of Voitland a part of Bohemia, waters Misnia, and then falls into
the Elb) and not thinking it safe to leave that Town behind them, they turned
their march toward it; and with little disturbance placing their Artillery
against it, they in a few hours persuaded the Inhabitants (who knew the
weakness of the place) to parley, and to agree to quit the Town, marching out
only with their Swords, which they did, to the number of 400 Foot and 70 Horse.

This Town being taken, Kniphausen, the Swedish Marshall of the Field went
with six Regiments of Foot and Horse to join with Tuball, who stayed with 3000
Soldiers before the Castle of Leypzig, and he quartered the rest of his Forces
about Aldenburg, a walled Town with weak and ancient Fortifications, near
Pleis, between Borne and Zwika. The Imperialists stoutly answered the enemies
outrage from the Castle; when the Wind mills, which were for the service of
the Garrison, being be^ten down, and Kniphausen being come up unto the Enemy,
the Castle was more narrowly beset; whereupon the besieged, seeing themselves
near lost, resolved to parley, promising to surrender the place if they were
not succored within ten days: this Proposition was entertained by Tuball, but
no succor appearing, and the ten days being expired, they surrendered the
Castle to the Swedes, the Imperialists coming forth on the 12 of December with
their Swords only, December. 12.
to the number of 300.

The Saxons hereby encouraged to new enterprises, they bethought themselves of
the taking in of Zwika, (a place well fortified upon the side of Mulda) to the
end, that they might not suffer that Garrison of the Imperialists to grow
greater, which might afterward be likely to disturb their proceedings in
those parts. Therefore, Knipha^sen taking with him those Soldiers which he
found there about Leypizg (which were some 5000 Foot and 1600 Horse, marched
toward Aldenburg; and the Saxons being advertised of the great preparations
made by the Austrians in Sletia to oppose their designs, here divided
themselves, and faced about toward that Province. The Governor of Zwika
perceiving the coming of the Swedes, resolved valiantly to defend it; he
therefore fired all the houses which stood about the Ditch which might serve the
Enemy for a blind, he withdrew into the City all that the time would permit
him to do, he disposed of his Cannon in the fittest places, and made it
appear he was resolved not to fail in the duty of his charge, and
performance of his loyalty. Kniphausen being come within the sight of the
walls, and finding it very hard to get earth, by reason of the excessive
Frosts, built some Gabions of great pieces of Wood, and filled them with earth,
and made such use thereof to secure his Batteries, as that serving himself
thereof to purpose, and the besieged understanding that Walesteine was
retreated from Saxony, seeing little hope of timely succor, after thirteen
days holding out, parlyed, and surrondred the Town upon more honorable
conditions then in like case is usually received from a conquering Enemy,
marching forth with 700 Foot and 100 Horse.

Gustavus Horn this mean while made diverse progresses in Alsatia; in
particular, he took Benfield, one of the most important places of that
Province, guirt about with five Royal Bulworks, though not very great ones,
with Ditches and half Moons, in a spacious open Country, not far from the
Rhyne, upon the side of Ill (a River which coming from the Mountains of
Helvetia falls into the Rhyn beneath Strasbourg:) This place being in two
months taken, he marched toward Ebersmunster; the Inhabitants whereof,
knowing themselves not able with their imperfect walls to resist the Swedish
Forces (who were above 10000 fighting men, and 22 piece of Cannon) that they
might shun the dangers and incommodities which those receive who foolishly
undertake impossibilities, accorded upon the first summons, and received into
quarter 200 Horse, and 600 Foot.

The taking of this place facilitated the Swedes advancing to before Silistat,
(a chief City of Alsatia, between Benfield and Brisach, fortified with
strong Parapets) where playing upon it with 12 piece of Cannon for the space of
three weeks, Colonel Breitembach, who commanded in the Town, (after having
gallantly defended himself) dispairing of succor by reason of the sew
Austrian Forces that were in that Province, not amounting in all two 2000 Horse
and 3000 Foot, which was a force hardly sufficient to defend Brisach, he was
necessitated to yield the Town unto the Swedes, the which he did upon the 13
of December on honorable conditions, December. 13.
the Garrison marching forth which consisted of 600 Foot and 150 Horse, with
their Arms, Baggage, and two piece of Cannon.

This mean while there were come from Lorayne, upon the Confines of Alsatia,
not far from Colmar, some Companies of Horse paid by the Imperial Officers
in that State, and in Burgundy, to the number of 1400 Foot and 400 Horse; and
because these of themselves were not sufficient to thwart the Swedes
proceedings, Montecuculi (who then commanded in chief in Alsatia) resolved to
march out with part of the Garrisons of Colmar and Brisach, that he might join
with them, and so not only disturb the Enemies quarters in that Country, but
keep the neighboring Towns from being invaded by the Swedes, who knowing the
Romanists design, and setting upon them before their Forces were joined,
forced them, with the loss of a great many of their men, to retire to Brisach.

Charles Duke of Lorayne, considering the Swedes proceedings in Alsatia, and
the near position of their Forces to his Territories, upon the Frontiers
whereof, there neither being strong hold, nor yet Army in the Field, to
preserve him from being injured by them, he apprehended some very great danger.
He therefore gave Gustavus Horn to understand, who then was at Markerck, a
place not far from the Frontiers of Lorayne, how that he (the said Charle)
had some years before, lent good store of Money to the Archduke Leopald, for
the security whereof he had assigned unto him Benfield, Da^sten, and Zabren,
which being now in possession of the Swedes, he by the way of friendship
desired to know what their purpose was concerning them, and whether they would
proceed with him as a friend, or as with an Enemy? Horn in a modest and civil
manner answered; That his Highness might expect all good correspondency and
entire friendship from the Crown of Swethland, if he would forbear to assist
the Imperialists, their Enemies; and that for what concerned his claim to
those Towns, as soon as he should have therewithal acquainted the assembly
of the interessed and confederate States, he should reap such fruits as he
should sow, and answerable to his proceedings.

The Imperialists on the other part had thought to have surprised 500 Swedish
Horse within their quarters, and had therefore dispatched away Forces to effect
that design; but Colonel Comoschi knowing of it got on horseback, and nimbly
pursuing them with his Regiment, and some other Troops belonging to Colonel
Schavalischi, set upon them at unawares, whilst they thought to have entered
Edengham, without any manner of let; and though at the beginning of the
skirmish neither side seemed to have the best, he enforced the Caesarians to
return to their quarters with the loss of their Colonel Cronech, being rather
beaten back and overcome by the advantage of the seat, and unexpected chance,
which is usual in such cases to cause great confusion and hinder businesses
otherwise projected, then by the Swedish Forces.

But as under a clouded sky one clap of thunder comes seldom unseconded by
another, the Inhabitants of Colmar, perceiving the Austrian affairs to grow
every day worse and worse, and finding themselves very much oppressed by the
insolency of the Caesarian Garrison, and the Governor, who that he might raise
moneys from thence before he departed, which he knew would be ere long
(because he saw no hopes of succor, but likely-hoods of the Swedes coming
thither, who grew every day stronger) extorted moneys from them by all
dishonest ways, contrary to the will of his Superiors; they resolved to throw
off this burden, by giving themselves over into the Swedes protection. December.
20.
And thus upon the 20 of December they privately acquainted Horn with their
intention, and agreed with him that he should appear before their gates at an
appointed hour, which he should find open, and they would deliver unto him the
Governor. Horn, though he were elsewhere employed, yet as one that knew, a
wise man ought not to let slip any occasion, whereby by the getting of any
Town he may succor the Frontier, and that such purchases as are made without
shedding of blood are most commendable amongst soldiers, resolved to march
toward it, and to receive the effects of their promise; December. 24.
so as appearing before the Town on the 24th of the same month, the Citizens
straightway taking up arms, first made the Governor safe, then cut in pieces
all those that seemed to contend against them, and let in the Swedes by the
gate of Elsen, and drove out the Austrians. An example to those who unadvisedly
persuaded by some favourit, confer the government of a City or Territory to
a greedy selfe-interessed person, who takes upon him such an employment, not
out of glory or honor, but for private gain, and who knows not how to
exercise any other lenity then that whereby he fleeceth the Subject, and
inricheth himself, things which are detested even by the most faithful; for
people cannot endure, that he who is sent to comfort, to maintain* and to
defend them, should only tend himself and provide for himself, cutting others
men's clothes short to piece out his own.

The bounds being enlarged which held in the Swedish progress, by the giving
up of Colmar, they had not only leisure to carry their Forces even to the
banks of the Rhyn over against Brisach, subduing likewise Ensesheim, Ruffach,
Bastuillier, Tann, and all the Cities, Towns, and Castles, which lie between
Colmar and Basel; a Canton of the Switzers; but by these happy successes, and
the Austrians weakness, Horn was encouraged to march toward Haghenaw, a
place held by the Caesarians, and of no contemptible consideration, being
seated upon the Confines of Lorayne, begirt with strong walls, and deep
Ditches, though of the old manner: The taking whereof, as it would be very
advantageous to those of Strasburg and the neighboring places, for that
Parties sallying every day out from thence in pursuit of passengers, and
ill-guarded Villages, the Traffic of so great a Merchandising Town, and the
surety of the neighboring places was much indammaged, so was it likewise much
desired by the Swedes, not so much for the increasing of their bounds by such a
Town, as to give satisfaction to Strasburg and the neighboring parts, to win
the good wills whereof, the Swedes did politiquely apply themselves, as knowing
how much the good report and love of people conduces to the welfare of War.
And it being Gustavus Horns custom, to use Treaties, Propositions and
Persuasions, before he fell to Threats or Violence, (especially in strong
holds, wherein he knew the power of the Garrisons were conterpoised by the
multiplicitie of the Inhabitants) he sent a Trumpet with Letters into the
Town, fairly inviting the Garrison and Citizens to accord with him; the sound
whereof having given an alarm to the Burgers, they were counseled by the
fear they had of the weakness of their own Forces, and out of the desire
they had of quiet, foreseeing they could not long hold out against so potent an
Enemy, being every where environed by them, and having no hope of succor; as
likewise knowing, it was always better to listen to such capitulations as are
friendly propounded, then to be put afterward to demand them with fear of not
having them granted; they therefore took in the Swedish Garrison forcing the
Imperialists, though much against their wills, to depart, hoping
notwithstanding to receive them in again, when it should be their fortune to
be Masters of the Field, and that they should be near their City.

At this time Franckendal, the chief Town and Fort of the Lower Palatinat,
being between Spier and Worms, not far from the Rhyn, and which was exactly
fortified, was straightly besieged by the Swedes, and was out of all hope of
succor, the Austrian Forces being too far from it, and the Enemy too near it;
so as the Spaniards, who were in possession of it, finding they could no longer
keep it, for that their friends Forces were every where all employed in the
defense of their own Estates, and consequently they had not wherewithal to
assist them, these wise Statesmen, knowing how advantageous it is to surrender
up that by the way of seeming courtesy, which they could not by force
maintain, they resolved to handle their necessity with cunning and artifice;
Insomuch as the English Ambassador to the Emperor, pressing hard for the
restitution of this Town, and the rest of the Palatinat, they seeming to put a
value upon the satisfying of that King, and to seem well disposed toward him,
that they might win upon his good will, which they very much needed for their
interests in France and Flanders, delivered up the Town into the hands of the
English Officers, who had been sent over and were entertained into the service
of the Crown of Swethland, the one and twentieth day of November. Nov. 21.


The restitution of this place promising the like of the whole Palatinat to the
Princes Palatine, the Inhabitants thereof, who entirely loved their Princes and
hoped to have them hereby again their Sovereigns, had their sorrows somewhat
lessened for the death of Frederick Prince Elector and late King of Bohemia,
who dyed of a Fever in Mentzon the 29th of November 1632. a Prince so sweetly
conditioned as that he was universally beloved by all Protestants. Nov. 29.


This Prince was in his first years much favored by fortune, he was first
Elector of the Empire possessed of the most fruitful and pleasant County of all
Germany, insomuch as other seeming to emulate his happiness, kept their eyes
only fixed upon him: but as our weakness is usually wont to grow so much
nearer to an unhappy downfall, by how much it is higher raised by worldly
ambition; so this Prince begirt on every side with peace and quiet, upheld with
reverent and obsequious estimation, strengthened by a dreaded jurisdiction,
comforted by his Alliance with James the first King of great Britane, and by
the beauty and perfection of the Princess Elizabeth his Wife, secured by
confederates, both within and without Germany, and though of himself he was
incomparably moderate, yet great men's desires being like fire, which the more
materials are heaped on it, the higher does the flame mount; so this peaceful
Prince, called on by his peoples unquietness to a higher degree of Majesty,
persuaded by the suggestions of his interessed friends to further greatness,
counseled by his unstable, ambitious, and vainglorious Ministers of state to
enlarge his bounds, and finally allured by his wife (who as she was Daughter
to a King desired likewise to be Wife unto a King) to girt about his Electorall
Cap with the Crown of Bohemia (which was presented and offered unto him;) the
flames of ambition being blown by so many somenters, notwithstanding his
natural moderation, were of force enough to evaporat that wisdom, which he
having afterward lost, was the ruin of all that happy Empire; giving a
beginning to so horrible tourmoyles, as do cause (even yet) the sufferings of
many regions. He was of a pleasant aspect, of a brown complexion, of an easy
mind, of slow impression, a Prince more given to the ease of peace then to
the troubles of war.

In these days some of Walesteines and Tersicas Officers being upon the
Confines of Slefia, and sent thence toward Polonia, passed on together with a
good number of Polaches which they had assembled to Neiss, which Town by
reason of an insurrection made by the Inhabitants, the greatest part whereof
were Roman-Catholiques, and well affected to the Caesarian party, would make
use of this occasion, and no longer conceal the ill will they bore the
Protestants; so as upon the appearing of these Forces, they quickly delivered
themselves up into the hands of the Caesarians; when not long after Harnem
being advertised thereof, faced about with his Army, and Tuball laid an ambush
for the Polaches, wherein he put above 208 of them to the sword, whereupon it
behoved the said City to submit it self again to the Saxons, as did likewise
Ratibor and Leschnitz, which were ill treated, showing their Rebellion against
their native Prince.

Baudis made no less prosperous progress in the parts about Coln, who without
being master of the Field did with his Army over-runne all the County, when
those of Coln, fearing lest at last they might bethink themselves of taking in
their City, made haste to Fortify Dutts, a Town on this side Rhyn, over
against their City; but by the mediation of my Lords the States of Holland they
obtained leave to be Newtrals, upon condition that they were not to Fortify
any place that did not belong unto them. Though this Town was within the
limits belonging to them, yet Baudis (as those are used to do who mind their
own profit) desirous of any pretense or just occasion to break this agreement,
knowing that this Town might easily be taken, whereby he hoped to enrich
himself, either by taking the said City, or by composition made by the richer
Inhabitants to buy their peace with a sum of money, acquainted the chief
Magistrate that he expected he should desist from the Fortification which he
had begun to make, as contrary to the Articles of Capitulation; to the which
those of the Magistracy did in a handsome manner and with reason reply, that
their intentions were only to secure their Town: but this answer satisfied
not Baudis, who answered again, that under the flowers of this their pretense
the Serpent of some deeper design lay hid: whereupon drawn by hopes of
profit, (which oft-times prevails more with Soldiers then reason does) he
resolved to advance, and to try his fortune. He the next night unexpectedly
came before it, planted his Great Guns, and played upon the weakest side of the
Town, where a Bullet fell by chance into the Ammunition, and setting fire
thereon about 400 men were burnt; at which accident the rest being afrighted
and astonished, the Swedes had not much difficulty to get upon the abandoned
Rampires, and so surprise the Town: yet their aboade there was but short; for
the Romanists planted their Cannon against it, and playing incessantly upon it
with 24 Great Guns, wherewith they battered down the houses, threw down the
walls, and the stones flying in all places from the tops of houses, they within
four days space were enforced to forsake the Town and to retire themselves
to Molheim; where Baudis perceiving the difficulty of the enterprise, though he
infinitely coveted to effect it, did at the instance of the Holland
Ambassadors desist from further violence, giving thereby satisfaction to my
Lords the States, (with whose safety it did not stand to permit more potent
neighbors to be near them then those they had, and therefore they did not well
approve of these the Swedish advancements) by Surrendering Molheim likewise (a
walled Town not far off) to those of Coln, or Colonia Agrippina (so called
for that Agrippina mother to Nero the Emperor was borne there) seated upon the
Banks of the Rhyn toward the North, not far distant from ^he Confines of
the Low Countries; it is one of the greatest Cities of all Germany, begirt with
a double Wall, and double Ditches, and having above fourscore strong Towers
about it; it is governed by Laws and Officers like a Commonwealth.

Whilst the Swedish affairs proceeded on this manner in Germany, the Lord
Chancellor Oxesterne (who had taken upon him the charge of the Swedes Militia,
and the direction of the Protestants resolves) foreseeing of what importance it
would be to free Westfalia from the oppression of the Imperialists, wherein
their Forces grew every day more numerous, he made a levy of 8000 fighting men,
and framed the Body of an Army of them; part whereof he assigned to Duke George
of Lunenburg, and the other part to the Landsgrave of H^ss^n, as well to afford
them means thereby to maintain their Forts, as to preserve the friendship of
the Princes who were confederates with Gustavus the late King, who if they
should find affairs begin to decline, being wrought upon by their particular
interest, might change their minds, and betake themselves to that side by
which their own dominions might be the more secured and kept entire. He
assigned other 8000 to Duke Bernard Waymer, that he might pass with them into
Franconia, to the taking in of Bamberg, a place which made much for their
advantage; to the effecting whereof it much imported them first to take
Cronach, a place of some account, seated upon the Banks of Radach, and watered
on the West side by the rivolet Haflach, which was on their backs. At their
first approach they took the City which was forsaken by the small Garrison in
it; but the enterprise proving exceeding difficult by reason of the valiant and
stout defense made by the Imperialists in the Castle, he was persuaded to quit
it.

From hence he came before Bamberg, where the Caesarians wanting sufficient
Provision to maintain themselves within those Walls, being advertised of the
Swedes marching toward them, made haste to be gone from thence, to the great
grief of the Inhabitants, (occasioned rather by the Soldiers carrying away
with them whatsoever they could lay their hands on, then for their departure)
and retreated to Fortheim, a strong hold in the same Province, seated in the
Angle which is made by the River Visent, where it falls into the Rednitz
another River. But Colonel Bolach pursuing them in the Rear with some fresh
Horse, stayed many of them who were flying from Bamberg to Fortheim, for that
(being encumbered with Baggage, Women, and Children) they could not march so
fast as they had wont; but they were all afterward (as unusefull people) set
at liberty by Waymer, to the end that they might witness to the rest of the
Inhabitants of Bamberg, who were already got into Fortheim, that they might
return to their own homes, where they should not any ways be injured by the
Swedish Soldier. He furthermore made public edicts and proclamations, that
they should all within one months space return to their own houses,
otherwise they should be declared to be for ever banished and have their goods
forfeited; a course usually observed by the Swedes, to the end the Towns they
won might not be void of Inhabitants, the numbers whereof render a City rich
and strong.

Whilst businesses were in this posture, some Caesarian Forces under the
Command of Aldringer, which waged war in the behalf of the Duke of Bavaria,
were by his diligence acrewed to so considerable a number, as that they were
able to keep the Field in Swabenland, with some appearance of no contemptible
success: whereupon Aldringer thinking he might be able, by reason of the
absence of the Swedish Forces which were busied in Alsatia, to do some notable
act, he bethought himself of taking in Getzberg, a walled Town between the
Vlm and Ausburg, which did afterward much facilitate his Siedge against
Auspurg, in those days a rich, strong, and very stately City by reason of the
site thereof, lying as it were in the Center of Swabenland, between the Leech
and the Werhach; he therefore planted his Cannon against it, and beginning to
play very hotly upon it, after three days stout defense made by the Garrison
the Town yielded; as soon after did Landspurg, a place of greater account,
seated in Bavaria on the Confines of Swabenland upon the Banks of Leech, which
being unprovided of Victuals and Ammunition, and straightly beset on all sides
by the Roman-Catholiques, was enforced to Surrender, to the great prejudice of
the Swedish affairs; the chief Officers who commanded there being made
prisoners, and the Common Soldiers mingled amongst his weakest Companies,
whereby his Forces were increased, and the Enemy weakened.

Aldringers proceedings in Swabenland did not a little anger Horn, who was
then in Alsatia with the maine Body of his Army, having taken in all the Towns
of that Province, wherein were any Garrisons of the Imperialists, unless it
were Brisach; he fearing lest the Imperialists might advance even to the
recovery of Auspurg, and so make themselves masters also of Mimingham (a City
of very considerable consequence, seated in the heart of Swabenland) and that
from thence the Passage being open unto them they might enter into the Dukedom
of Wirtenberg, (a Country which the Swedes had a very great care of, not only
out of the obligation they ought to the Prince thereof, who had so much to his
prejudice declared himself for the Swedes, as for that it being a rich and
opulent Country, and not yet impoverished by the Armies, they might there
promise themselves good refreshment for their Army, and to keep themselves
commodiously in Swabenland and in Alsatia, in the midst whereof this Dukedom
was seated) he therefore munited the strong holds of greatest consideration in
Alsatia, to withstand the Lorayners attempts, who were to the number of about
7000 fighting men, upon these Confines toward Ramberville (a Town on the side
of Motona a River of Lorayne) and the Garrison of Brisach being very sufficient
for that Fort, whether all the Garrisons of those Towns which he had taken in
had retreated themselves, he recommended the care of that Province to the care
of Otho Lodowick Ringrave, and passed over the Rhyn at Sconaw between Strasburg
and Brisach, and came with 8000 Foot and 1000 Horse before Freiburg, a little
walled Town within four hours march of Brisach, hold by the Imperialists; he
set upon it, and with little difficulty obtained it, it being a place of no
defense; from thence he advanced forward, and joining with the Duke of
Wirtenbergs Forces (who were about 2000 Foot and 600 Horse) they marched
toward Enghem, a little Town toward the Switzers Cantons, and the Lake of
Constance, that he might likewise join with Bannier, who stayed with 4000
Soldiers to guard the Towns about Auspurg, till he was hindered by the
Caesarians from so doing, who did already besiege Mimingen and Kempten in
Swabenland.

But Horn came too late, for Mimingen no longer able to resist the
Imperialists, was enforced to yield upon conditions (which were not afterward
kept by the Bavarians) and to give themselves up into the hands of the Roman
Catholics; who deteining the Officers Prisoners, constrained the Magistrates
to pay a great Contribution. This was said to be occasioned by reason of some
words of the Governor, and by the default of the Commissioners. Kempten being
environed with old walls and Towers, but wanting Rampires of Earth, after
having sustained eight days continual Battery, being more oppressed by the
Imperialists (who after the taking of Mimingen ran all thither) was taken by
Storm, and all that were met withal in heat of blood, or that were known to
be Soldiers, were put to the Sword. Whilst the Austrians were about the taking
of Kempten, and Marshall Horn was marching that ways to bring the besieged
opportune succor, some Squadrons of the Imperialists Horse, commanded by
Colonel Galbert, met with Plate (a Swedish Commander, who was sent to enquire
after their ways) and the skirmish between them being begun, the Roman
Catholics were forced to give back: For certain other Troops of the Enemy
which followed after them, set so fiercely upon them, as that Galbert (a
gallant Soldier, and one that was not used to turn his back) whilst he
manfully defended himself, was, together with many of his Soldiers, slain,
and many other were taken prisoners; the remainder, saving themselves by the
favor of the night, which afforded them means of safe retreating. Whereupon,
Horn seeing he could do them no more harm, without great disadvantage to
himself, marched toward Mindelheim, between Auspurg and Mimingen, which at
first preparing for defense, and being provided of all necessaries, when they
saw the Cannon ready to batter, that they might not make proof of the violence
that was threatened them, they resolved to accept the Conditions that were
offered, and to yield to the Swedes. Aldringer this mean while, being come to
Kansbeuren, which lies between Auspurg and Kempten, upon the River Vertach,
and being there advertised of the surrender of Mindelheim, he thought himself
not safe there; wherefore having put a good Garrison into it, he withdrew
himself toward Bavaria, there to attend fresh succor from Walestein; and Horn
came to Kausbeuren, and surprised it by Petars; forcing the Guardians thereof,
(who defended themselves in a corner of the Town, barricadoed up with Carts)
to yield, and inrole themselves under his Banners.

This mean while those of Brisach, being delivered from Horn, and the
Ringrave being employed about Altchirch, (a Castle in Alsatia near Wirtenberg)
they sent some Country people under color of carrying somewhat to sell at
Newenburg upon the Rhyn, between Brisach and Basel, charging them to make a
stand in the Gate, and cut in pieces the small guard of the Swedes that were
there, which being by them accordingly done, with weapons which they carried
hid under their rustic habits, Colonel Mantrenti's Horse, and the like of
Harcourt (who waited to that end at a set distance) came speedily in at the
sign given, made themselves Masters of the City, cut many of the Garrison in
pieces, took many prisoners, and brought the best things of the City with
them to Brisach. And for that men do not usually fear blows a far off, the
Duke of Lorayne, seeing Alsatia quit of the Swedes (persuaded by the
Imperialists, impatient to expect the event of the Protestant assemblies,
touching the indempnitie pretended upon Zurbein and Dacsteine) and comforted by
Spanish hopes, resolved, since the Swedes absence permitted him now so to do,
to make himself Master of those places which were not far from Strasburg, at
the foot of those Mountains which divide Lorayne from Alsatia therefore his men
advancing with their Cannon, he set upon them, and they (not being provided of
Garrisons, nor sufficient Ammunition, and the Inhabitants being better affected
to the Austrians then to the Swedes, and surprised by this unlooked for
accident, believing for certain that the Duke in respect of his own
particular interest, would never have endeavored a breach with France, which
had more then once willed him to keep at home, and not show any hostility
against his friends) yielded, and took in a Garrison of Loraynes* The
Imperialists of Br^sach likewise, under Montecuculi, reinforced by some
Country people of the neighboring parts, and solicited by intelligence from
certain Citizens from Haghenaw, betook themselves to the taking in of that
Town, wherein they prospered; for the Inhabitants having invited the Governor
and chief Officers of the Garrison to dinner, according to the German custom,
they so plied the Governor, Officers, and Soldiers of the guard, with Wine
sophisticated with sleeping-powder, as it was no hard matter to take the
Governor and Officers, who were fast asleep, prisoners, and to win the Court
de guard of that Gate whereby they let in the Caesarian Forces, who to that
purpose lay concealed not far from thence. This success is fitting to be
observed by those who have the charge of any City or strong hold committed by
their Prince to their care, that they be not frequent at invitations or feasts
made by the Inhabitants, but that they be diligent in their own quarters, and
take order for such things as they think appertain, as well to the politic
part, as to the defense of the place recommended to their fidelity and care.

It being usual for men to be encouraged to make new attempts by the
prosperous success of others, the Country people of Verdgaw and Altchirch
rising in commotion against the Swedes, and taking Psitten, (a Village where
some of their Horse were quartered) set upon them so unexpectedly, as that not
having time to betake themselves to horse, LIB. 5. 1633.
they took their Captain prisoner, slew the Soldiers, and used the prisoners
with much barbarism^, which when the Ringrave heard of, and how the Lorayners
and Austrians had behaved themselves, he being already past the Bridge of
Strasburg as far as Sclestat, and calling to mind these wicked actions, got
on horseback with all his followers, which were 1000 Horsemen, all of them
either Gentlemen or experienced Soldiers, (for he was so desirous of being
well served, as that besides his fair carriage toward them, he laid not out
his money so willingly upon any thing, as in entertaining such as had fair
repute in wars) and together with some Troops of Colonel Harfe, he hasted
straight ways toward those parts* and overtaking them that were in Mulbausen,
(not far from Basel) he flew upon them with his Dragoones, and firing the
first houses of the Village, the Country people astonished at this unexpected
accident, (being base, and not wonted to see angry countenances and drawn
Swords) betook themselves to their heels, and fled toward the hills of Tan:
but the Swedes spurring their horses apace after them, some of them were hewed
in pieces, and the rest of them burnt, for they thought it not fitting to give
quarter to those that had so inhumanely betrayed their Companions.

The Ringrave hearing again after this, how that Montecuculi, with a great
many of Armed Countrymen, was about Berfort, upon the Confines of Lorayne, he
marched thitherwards; but Montecuculi (knowing by experience that little trust
was to be put in a rablerout, without either order or discipline, who were
taken from the Mathook) thought it not fitting to encounter with the Swedes; he
therefore retreated with eight Companies of Horse which he had with him, and
one of Dragoones, into Brisach, and left the Country people in Dameschirch, a
little Village two Leagues distant from Basel, where the Enemy ariving, and
they not knowing how to put themselves in defense, but basely running away, the
greatest part of them were cut in pieces, and 700 that were taken prisoners, in
recompense of the inhumanity they had used toward the Swedes, were tied
together by seven and seven with withs of willowes, set in the open fields, and
in this posture the Horse were commanded to fall upon them and put them all to
the Sword; the which they did, leaving thirty of the chiefest of them hung by
the heels upon trees.

In Alsatia affairs went thus, 1633.
when Walesteine, resolving upon the continuance of the war, and foreseeing
what the prejudice might be which would result to the Imperial Crown, as well
as to his own particular interest, if he should be dispossessed of the Towns in
Swabenland, and of such a Province, a good part of the jurisdiction of his
Dukedom of Glagaw and Sagan, which if it should fall into the power of the
Protestants, would sever the annexion held with the States of Poland, (from
whence, in fitting time he hoped for a considerable succor, the King thereof
inclining very much to the Caesarian party, as well in respect of their
ancient hatred borne to the Swedes, as for the succors they had received from
the Emperor in the War of Liefland, as also for that a brute ran that there
might be some hopes of a marriage with that house) he therefore charged
Gallasse to go with part of his Army, and with some pieces of Artillery, to
divert the Saxons designs, whilst he himself stayed in Bohemia to reinforce
his Army by Moneys, and to contrive Counsels, Intelligence, Diversions, and
fitting Instruments for the work wherein he was concerned. He therefore went
by Brawn near Stein, and within a few days space got into that Province,
where he surprised many places which wanted necessaries for war; and had he
endeavored the taking of Sweinitz, a City of some importance, not far from
Breslaw, he might easily have done it, though he was advised to the contrary
only out of a false opinion of meeting with great difficulties; for though it
were surrounded with ancient Walls and Rampires of Earth, yet in respect of the
weakness of the Garrison, and for want of Ammunition, it was greatly afraid to
be set upon, and was rather in a condition of demanding Articles then of
preparing for defense.

Two thousand Saxons being this mean while advertised that some Troops of
Caesarian Horse belonging to Tersica were quartered in Goltz upon the Weistriz,
thought to surprise them; so as making thitherward, they no sooner approached
near Olaw, but that they fell upon them; who being risen from their former
quarters over-runne the Country* they charged so closely home, as the
Caesarians, though not inferior in number, fled, losing not above thirty of
their Soldiers.

In this interim Colonel Guets was come with 1000 Horse and 800 Foot near
Brieg, between Olaw and Oppelen upon the side of Oder: he desired passage from
the Prince thereof* who desirous to stand neuter, denied it him, whereupon he
betook himself to Force: but finding that the Citizens were ready for
defense, and that the enterprise was somewhat brisk, he returned to his
quarters at Neisse. Harnem hearing hereof, who was with the greatest part of
the Saxon Army at Nanstaw (a Town beyond Breslaw) and fearing left Brieg might
fall into the Caesarians hands, (which would be very prejudicial to the
Elector) found there a Passage over the Oder in the heart of that Province,
passing over the which he made toward it, that he might secure it, by putting
thereinto a Saxon Garrison, which notwithstanding was denied by the Prince, who
persisted in his neutrallity: but Harnem howsoever resolved to secure the
Town, brought Cannon thither, which when the Inhabitants saw, (who were more
inclined to peace then to war, and foresaw the damage and troubles
occasioned by war) they persuaded their Prince to grant Harnems request, as
after two days treaty he did. Harnem having gathered his men together, and
being joined with Tuball, made a general Muster, wherein he found 14000
fighting men, wherewithal he matched toward Strelen and Wansen (Towns lying
upon Ola) where the Imperialists at the first appearing of the Saxons, put
themselves in Battaile-array, seeming as if they would not refuse to fight with
them; but finding afterward the disadvantage, they left part of their Forces
in Strelen, forsook Wansen, and retreated with the gross of their Army to
Grotkaw and Nei^se; which when Harnem saw, he prepared to take in Strelen, the
Garrison whereof (knowing themselves not able to defend it, and having
directions left with them to quit it, if the Enemy should face the Town)
endeavored, though in vain, to fly: for being encompassed by the Saxon Horse,
the greatest part of them were made prisoners, and brought to Olaw.

The taking of Strelen encouraged the Swedes to the taking in of Grotkaw
between Neisse and Brieg; where, as soon as the Imperialists saw the Enemies
Scouts, they forwent the place and retreated to Neisse, not caring much to
fight, that they might not hazard their men in a Battle, since they shortly
expected such recruits, as that they might without being incountered drive
their Enemies from those places, though they should have a thousand men for
their Garrisons; but the Saxons not slipping the occasion, did forthwith set
upon the Walls with such violence, as that the Inhabitants wanting means to
make sufficient defense, and that they might not be left to the mercy of the
Sword, (as it oft-times befalls them who trust too much to their own weakness)
yielded upon Conditions, that they might march forth only with their Swords;
the which was done with little loss either to the one or to the other. These
same Imperialists when they were come into Neisse (a place better stored with
Provisions) resolved to defend the Town to the last man* they provided the
best they could to defend the Walls, placing there Cannon, and preparing stoutly
to defend it; whereupon the Saxons (foreseeing what difficulties and damages
Assaults would produce) they laid Siege unto it.

Gustavus Horn having this mean while taken Kaufbeuren, he advanced toward
Mimingen and Kempten, Feb. 10.
and on the Tenth of February so straightly besieged them, as that he was come
covered even underneath their Walls. But understanding that Aldringer, recruited
by 4000 Bavarians, had passed the Leech, and taken Mindelheim and Biberach the
chief Cities of Swabenland, seated upon the River Risse, (which running a
little higher falls afterward into the Danube) so as he might easily fall upon
the state of Wirtenberg, (a business which much troubled his thoughts) he rose
from thence, and passing back again over the Danube at Munderking between
Vlm and Reidlinghen, where the very day before the Casarians had passed, both
the Armies met together at Zwifalten, a little Town of Swabenland, upon the
Confines of Wirtenberg. Aldringer with the Imperial Horse set upon the Swedes
in the Rear, and skirmished with them, and after much contesting charged so
home upon the Swedish Squadrons, as that he put them to flight; taking many
Carriages, much Baggage, two Cornets, and beating down about 50 of the Enemy.
Horn knowing himself to be too weak to appear in the Field, retreated to
Minsuig, in the Dukedom of Wirtenberg upon the Confines of Swabenland, and
there intrenching himself waited for the arivall of some Troops that were at
Wirtenberg, and had received orders already to march toward him. Aldringer
finding it would be a difficult matter to advance further, retired to Mimingen,
quartering his Forces, some in the Country, some in the Towns, within the
precincts of Constantz.

Horn being reinforced by these Forces of the Rhingrave and Schavaluchi, and
hearing that Colonel Hispani was lodged at Sigmaring upon the Danube, he
resolved to surprise him; wherefore he advanced to Blochingw, and passing the
Danube at Sheer, (a Town upon the Banks thereof, between Vlme and Mulen) he
set upon him at unawares: Hispani astonished at this noveltie, had not leisure
to put on his Boots before he was taken prisoner, together with the loss of
four Companies that were with him.

But the strife in these Provinces, who should more warely watch over them, did
not exceed the like care had in Westfalia by the Landgrave of Hessen, against
Cronsfelt and Tenecausem; for after having met with some Imperialists near
Paderborn, where he dealt roughly with some Companies of the said Cronsfelt,
and being past into the Bishopric of Munster, where he thought to make some
invasion, he forbore notwithstanding to do so, by reason of the Inhabitants
promising him to stand Neutralls, and that they would not in any sort foment or
assist the Imperialists. He assailed Dortmund, between Rhur and Lippa,
(Rivers, which arising out of the said Province of Westfalia, fall into the
Rhyn beneath Cullen) which wanting walls, and Inhabitants able to make
resistance, easily yielded. Dorsten followed the example of Dortmund, a place
not stronger then the other, but a seat of much importance, standing upon the
Lip, between the Bishopric of Munster, and the Duchy of Cleaves; he
therein placed a sufficient Garrison, commanded by Colonel Vich, and went from
thence to Dulmen in the same Bishopric, and Halteren in the same Province,
which being with small resistance taken, and leaving in each of them a fitting
Garrison, he staid with the rest of his Forces in Bocholta, a place watered by
Bever, a River, which taking its rise from the Bishopric of Paderborn, after a
short course falls into Wesser.

Amongst these particulars, Oxesterne the Lord Chancellor knew, that to wage
War with many Forces under several Commanders of equal power, must occasion
discord, division, and disobedience; and therefore knowing very well, that it
was necessary to ordain a politic order concerning the present affairs, to
bridle the Military licentiousness, whereby men's means were wasted without
discretion, though friends and confederates, and to agree upon Contributions to
maintain the War; he required a Diet to be held by the Colleagues in
Neilbrun, a Town in Wirtenberg, wherein he desired the necessity of the common
interest might be weighed, and that order might be taken for the preservation
of their State. This Proposition was accepted of; the Protestant Deputies, and
those of the confederate States came thither; March.
so as the Diet began about the midst of March; wherein whilst the most
advantageous means were in dispute, how to maintain the Protestant
greatness, the Duke of Saxony, and the Elector of Brandenburg, reflecting upon
their own interest, saw that the best means to adequate their affairs, was a
firm resolution, either to prosecute the War with all their might, or else
to conclude a Peace, which was by Walesteine desired. They therefore forthwith
sent for the Prince of Denmark, (who was then in the Saxon Army) for Harnem,
and all the wisest men of their side, to come to Dresden, that they might
advise upon this particular, and to argue what resolutions they should give to
Walesteines Propositions: It was therefore propounded, whether they ought to
accept of Peace, or prosecute the War; those that were for Peace, wrought
thereunto by huge Gifts, and mighty promises made them by Walesteine, said:
That his Highness had hitherto managed the War with little profit, and great
expenses, since he has got nothing thereby but the being numbered amongst the
confederates of S^ethland, and one of those that had maintained War against
the Emperor; wherein if he had as yet profited but little, he was likely to
profit less; since that if the Austrians had preserved themselves against the
first brunts, being set upon in so many parts, what would the event of these
affairs be if every day strengthened by Spanish Forces, by Indian Gold, and by
the worth of their Commanders, who affectionately applied themselves to the
service of Caesar and Walesteine, they should acrew to that power as in
appearance they were likely to do? That those Princes are said to be very
wise, who foreseeing future ruin, can apply remedies whereby to prevent it
before it come; That Peace was never to be refused when the accepting of it may
make for profit and reputation; that times were not always the same, but
changeable, and that men did ost times repent the not having entertained such
occasion as time has offered; that the occasions, wherefore the War was
undertaken, ought to be considered, and the ends thereof, which if they were
obtained, men ought to be satisfied, since the fortune of War does oft-times
favor, when kept within bounds, and does forsake those who transcend them;
that the Imperial greatness was already sufficiently lessened, and
consequently the vapors thereof extinguished, which the ambition of her
Officers had raised up; that the Swedes were borne forward by advantage; that
it was not good to cherish them any longer in their bosoms; that the pleasures
of Germany were too much thirsted after by the Ministers of that Crown; that
they Treated with the Princes of the Empire with restless pretensions; that
one of the chiefest Electors of Germany ought not to comply with the will of
men come from forth Woods and Mountains; that he ought to endeavor not to
dis-member himself from the Empire, to preserve himself with those that were
strangers thereunto, who already give proofs of their immense designs: and
what would they be if they should obtain their vast ends upon the Empier? That
an union of many was of no long lasting, that every one had his particular
Maxims, so as it would be hard to find an agreement amongst so many differing
opinions, geniouses, and interests; that it was better to accept of an offer
made, then to pursue it when denied. These Reasons strongly urged by some
Spanioliz'd-Officers, wrought very much upon the Elector, who was exceedingly
inclined to Peace, and did not a little prevail with Oxesterne, and other
Swedish Ministers of State, whose intentions were not good, yet were they not
able to get a resolution, so as what had been formerly alleged, was
discreetly opposed by others, who urged the tie of Religion, crying down the
ends of the Imperialists, and their by-gon behavior toward that Elector,
showing how he was rewarded for his friendship, by the Invasion made into his
State by Tilly: declaring the hatred borne by Ecclesiastics to Protestants,
and (which was of greater moment) wounding him with the calling to mind the
Emperors late published Edict touching the restitution of the goods taken from
the Church; and remembering him of the means whereby he might so conveniently
acquit himself thereof, and free himself from those jealousies.

Though he was on the one side Counseled by his desire of Peace, and his
emulation of the Chancellor Oxesterne, and affrighted on the other side by
suspicion of the Austrians behavior, he resolved notwithstanding, by not
refusing to treat of an accommodation, to keep Walesteine in hopes, and by not
giving way to the Propositions, to put diffidence in the Swedes, and to
conclude a suspension of Arms, as did ensue, for two months, all of them
retiring themselves to their quarters, and re-assuming their former
negotiations.

The Duke of Berchenfelt who was till now left with his men in the parts of
Vetterania, encouraged by Baudis, who still desirous to invade the State of
Coln, grew impatient of effecting his desires, and who had invited him to join
with him, so to reinforce his Forces, as that enterprise was propounded,
invited by the likelihood of the design, he patted from those parts with his
men which were about 5000 Soldiers, and joining with some other Troops
marched thitherwards.

Gustavus Horn was during this in Swabenland, (no whit at all fearing the
Imperialists, who were now far from that Country,) plundring the Country, and
bringing what he got into Vlm and Biberack: when Aldringer went unexpectedly
with some Regiments toward Rain, making the Governor of that place believe,
by counterfeit signs and false names, that his men were some of the Swedish
Troops, sent upon some enterprise against the Imperialists; and being favored
by a thick mist, which that morning darkened the sky, and hindered the Swedes
from discovering the Country, he without bloodshed entered the City; wherein
leaving a good Garrison, he with the rest of his Army went toward Auspurg,
imagining to meet with as good fortune in the surprisall of it: but Gustavus
Horn hearing hereof, made all the haste he could thitherward to hinder him.

Much about this time the arrival of the most illustrious Ferdinand Infant of
Spain, Brother to the most Catholic King, was expected in Milan; and the
Spaniards purposing to send this Prince into Flanders to take upon him the
government of those Provinces whereof there was very great need, for that the
illustrious Infanta Clara Eugenia was now grown very old, and those people not
being willing to be commanded by any, but by some Prince of the Blood-Royall of
the house of Austria, and it behoving him to have considerable Forces to get
into those Provinces, not only to open the way unto him, but likewise to
reinforce their Armies, and for his greater credit, the Duke of Feria a man of
great wisdom and understanding (who was then Governor of Milan) obtained
Authority from the Emperor, and Claudia of Inspruch Arch-Duchesse to raise (to
boot with those levies of men raised in Lombardy and Naples) 2000 Soldiers for
the service of Spain in Germany, and to join thereunto the Regiment of
Colonel Altemps, and moreover that Frederick Enriques, Ambassador at
Brussels for Tiroll, Swabenland and the Austrian Countries of Germany, might
raise wha^ men he listed.

The French likewise who were in Rhetia in defense of the Grisons being
careful of the safety of that Country, which might without much difficulty
have been taken by the Spaniards, through the intelligence of some of their
State Ministers, and more particularly the chiefest of the lower Ag^edina, they
resolved not only to finish the Fortifications of Steich, a Passage by which
they go from Rhetia into Swabenland, near Veldkirch, a Town not far from
the Lake of Consta^^z, but designed moreover a Fort-royall of four Bulworkes
upon the Rhyn, not far from Meienfelt; and good sums of Money were sent to
Mounsieur Land the French-Kings Ambassador, who was at Coira, to keep those
confederates in Loyalty, and partly to satisfy the advancements which they
pretended unto.

Waymer (who having taken Bamberg and Kr^nach had all this while kept
himselsefe in those quarters, doing nothing of moment) thinking it was now time
to look about him, and hinder the inrodes which were made by the Crabats and
other Caesarian Horse quartered about Egra, he reviewed his Troops, and having
assembled a Body of men to about 8000 he encamped himself three days about
Steimach, between Egra and Kronach, he afterward sent part of his Horse into
the higher Palatinat to scour the Country, and inquire after the Caesarians
proceedings, who being very much increased in those parts, seemed as if they
would make some new attempt, and he with the rest of his men stayed behind to
join with Horn, that so they might pass into Bavaria; but the Duke thereof
knowing of their design, failed not with all speed to send many Bands of
Soldiers to the Confines of Swabenland, to have a care of his own Country.
Waymer, before he should come to the Danube, would satisfy the desire which
had more then once been made unto him by the Senate of Mariemberg, who were in
scarcity both of Victual and Traffic, wherein their greatest means did
consist; not receiving any benefit from the neighboring Countries possessed by
the Austrians, who overrun their Country; He therefore turned on the left
hand, and came in person to Mariemberg, where he was honorably received; and
his Horse not having the luck to meet with any but five Companies of Crabats
(who as knowing the Country were abroad to listen after this motion of the
Enemy, whereof the rest being advertised retired nearer Egra,) they Charged
them and slew some fifty of them.

Horn on the other side, being by sundry letters entreated to come to Waymer,
he presently removed his Army from about Auspurg, and marched toward Dunawert
to join with him; but for that it much imported the Swedes to regaine Rain, as
a place w^ll seated, and where passing the Leech, they might the easier enter
from Bavaria into Swabenland, he thought in this his march to take it, and
therefore drawing his Army about it, he erected three Batteries against the new
little Fort, built by the Bavarians upon the River, and won it; being
afterward reinforced by some Regiments sent him by Waymer, he hastened the
taking of the Town; whither the Bavarians not being able to come time enough,
who made long marches to come in unto their succor, and were expected by the
defendants, their Ammunition failing them, they were constrained to yield with
no small loss of Soldiers, who are usually more grieved when they are strong,
yet are debarred of means of fighting, then when they have means to fight and
are weak.

Berchenfelt, who being gone from Vetterania, a Country between the Maine and
Heccar, went to foment the designs of Baudis, came before Montabeur, a walled
Town between the Rivers of Steg and Lain, which fall into the Rhyn about
Coln, which was guarded by four Companies, rather that they might therein be
lodged, then for the defense thereof; and making diverse shot at it, he took
it. Whereat Merodes being startled, who was then in the Territories of that
Electorate to hasten the raising of Forces for the service of the Catholic
League, he passed over the Rhyn with 3000 Horse and 5000 Foot, and marched
toward Siburg, a place situated upon the banks of Seidg, not far from Coln,
not only to disturb the designs of Baudis and Berchenfelt, but to beat the
Swedes out of the quarters which they had usurped in those parts.

Now was the Diet at Helbrun ended, where by common consent it was concluded
and agreed upon, that the Electors and Princes of the League should keep
constantly united together til such time as what was taken from them by the
Austrians should be restored unto them, their past Laws should be established,
as likewise the privileges of the Cities of the Empire, and till the Crown of
Swethland should be satisfied for its service done to the Confederates, each of
them promising never to Treat or conclude any Agreement severally without the
consent of the rest of the Colleagues. And because it was requisite that the
many numbers of this body should be joined to one head, by which, as by an
expert Pilot, the Ship of their common interest might be guided in the Sea of
their present Emergencies, it was resolved that a Juncto of twelve Deputies or
Commissioners should be chosen to assist Oxenstern (nine of which were to be
Germans, and three Swethlanders) who was declared to be the Director thereof,
and General of the Army of the Crown of Swethland; and that this Council or
Juncto was to provide for public occurrences, to deliberate upon all
expeditions which concerned the common interest, and to take upon them the
whole Affairs.

Alsatia having at this time but few Swedes, by reason of Horns being gone
from thence; Montecuculi (who commanded in chief the Emperors Forces in that
Province) having augmented the number of his Forces at Brisach, by the
remainders of those which he could get from the Garrisons of the neighboring
Cities which Horn had formerly taken; he appeared every day to advance in his
proceedings, sometimes surprising quarters, sometimes troubling the
neighbour-garrisons, sometimes overrunning the Country, and endeavoring to
withdraw the residue of that Province into the said strong hold, the
preservation whereof was much studied by the Caesarians; it being the Key and
Sanctuary of Alsatia and Swabenland, and the most important and considerable
passage of the Rhyn: So as the Swedes, considering how much their interests
were concerned in the having the entire possession of that state, and the
securing themselves on the Rhynes side, they resolved to prosecute the
enterprise, and to do this whilst Saxony Treated of Peace, whilst Walestein
prepared to march into the Field, and whilst preparations were making at Millan
for augmenting Caesar's Forces; to the end, that they might afterward turn
their Forces whether best pleased them. Their return therefore to this
Country being resolved upon, the first thing propounded was the taking of
Haghenaw, which standing upon the Frontiers of Lorayne, incited the Duke to
take up Arms in the behalf of Caesar, and hindered the Commerce of
Strasbrough, a friendly place, and worthy to be upheld, since in it did consist
the safety and plenty of those parts. Oxesterne (having very wisely weighed,
that it behoved not them to lose their men in the taking in of Towns, whilst
the Enemy grew stronger in the Field, whereon the Game that was begun was
finally to be ended) put the Commanders in mind, that they should use all their
care and diligence in preserving their men; and the Duke of Berchenfelt (who by
reason of the arrival of the Emperors Forces, commanded by Merodes and
Gronsfield, could not hope to advance, the rather, for that the States of
Holland did not willingly adheare to such acquisitions) being retired to the
Teritories of the Electorate of Coln, where his first quarters were, about
Francfurt, he received orders to besiege Haghenaw and F^^burg, lying a little
lower on the side of the Rhyn, one League distant from Spier, from the Garrison
whereof parties continually sallyed forth, which kept the neighboring Towns of
the Palatinate and Wirtenberg in Contribution, Colonel Smidburg a Dutchman,
had orders at the same time, that he with his men, and those of Colonel
Abell-moda a Hollander, should lay siege to it; Montecuculi, who foresaw that
this cloud must fall upon him, threatening a great tempest, failed not
notwithstanding, in his formerly shown courage, nor in the constancy which
upon former occasions he had showed; but continuing his valor, which was never
seen to go less in him, he went forth of Brisach, and supplied the weakness
of his Forces by the strength of his mind. He plundered diverse Towns, cut in
pieces 100 of the Enemies Horse where they lay in quarter, took Rutell, a
Castle standing upon a hill not far from Basel, and faced Friborg in
Briscovia, with 700 Foot and 500 chosen Horse, to the no little terror of the
Garrison thereof, the which he might as easily have taken, as the Swedes did
when they took it, had not the Ringrave, who was very diligent in Military
executions, succored it by charging upon the Caesarians, whom he drove to the
very gates of Brisach, and slew fifty of them.

On the other side, the Imperialists were gotten to be a considerable number in
Slesia toward Sweinitz, and with little gaine-saying prospered in that
Province; the Saxons being marched into the Field they seemed fearful to make
any new adventures, and that they adjourned their designs waiting for
Walesteines coming in the Field, who after having made great Provision of
Cannon, Ammunition, and other Engines of War, departed from Prage; and though
the morning that he went forth the skies were very clear, yet on the sudden
there rose a terrible storm of Wind, Rain, and Hail; and as he lay that
night at Brandais, the Town was set on fire, and the greatest part thereof
burnt to the ground, and great store of Carriages and Cattle were likewise
burnt; which prodigious accident was thought to foretell no great good fortune
likely to befall him. He passed on to Chinegrats upon the Confines of Bohemia
toward Slesia, where he mustered his Army, wherein were found to be 140 Foot
Ensigns, 180 Cornets of Horse, 28 pieces of great Cannon, and 2000 well
furnished Carriages. Here he divided his Army, sending Holke with 7000
Soldiers toward Egra to secure Bohemia on that side, as likewise to oppose
any attempts Duke Waymer might make, who had near about 6000 fighting men,
consisting partly of his own men, partly of those he had drawn out of the
neighboring Garrisons, with the which in the beginning of May he advanced from
Franconia.

May.
At the news hereof, the Elector of Saxony apprehending danger in Walesteines
marching with so great Forces toward Slesia, and the suspension of Arms being
fruitlessely expired, he suddenly assembled together all the Forces that were
upon the Confines of Bohemia, together with those of Brandenburg, and the
Swedes that were dispersed about those parts; and gave order that they should
march under the command of Tuball toward Neisse, to watch over the Caesarian
proceedings, who being well-nigh 16000 fighting men, lay not far from thence
expecting Walesteine, who stayed eight days in Golts a Town near Velstritz,
in expectation of Forces from Bohemia, and an answer from the Court of Saxony
concerning the particular of Peace, which was never by them embraced, but
always wisely managed with new conditions.

The Duke of Bavaria, fearing lest by Walesteins being so far off, and by the
great recruits of Soldiers which the Swedes every day made upon the Confines
of his Dukedom, his Dominions might receive some notable prejudice, he gave
command, that all the Corn, Hay, and best movables of the Villages
thereabouts should be brought into the walled Towns and strong holds, to the
end, that if the Swedes should offer at any enterprise, they might not find
wherewithal to maintain their Army, and consequently wanting behoofefull
necessaries they might through Famine fail of their desires: and Aldringer
with the rest of the Imperialists encamped about Monaco, and began there to
fortify himself, that he might resist the Swedes, and defend that City till
he should receive such Forces as Walesteine had promised him, if occasion
should require.

But Waymer, (though being joined with Horn, he had near about 15000 fighting
men) being informed of Holkes advancing toward Egra, (who sent by Walesteine
to guard the Frontiers on that side, had opportunely possessed himself of the
most considerable seats of the upper Palatinat) and knowing likewise that his
Brother Duke William had not Forces sufficient to oppose the Imperialists
designs, he bridled his desire, and sent some Regiments of Horse toward
Aichstet, to observe Holkes proceedings, and he himself went to between
Dunawert and Rain to secure those places. Horn went toward Auspurg, and the
Ringrave returned toward Alsatia, to begirt Brisach.

Whilst the sky of Germany was thus troubled, foretelling much misery, the
clouds threatened no less foul weather toward Flanders; for the Hollanders
growing every day more powerful, had now a gallant Army in readiness to make
some attempt against the Austrians; and it was generally resolved on by them to
send an Army to take in Rimberg, a Fort which stands on the Rhyn, on this side
of the We^ssell, made much for their further enlarging themselves in the Angle
which lies between the Mase and the Rhyn toward the Electorat of Coln. The
Prince of Orange marched forth therefore with his Army, and intrenching himself
about the Town, did on the 15 th of May begin to raise his Batteries. May, 15.


The Saxons knowing themselves to be too weak in Slesia to withstand the great
preparations made by Walesteine to drive them out of that Province, resolved to
retreat toward the Oder, that they might make advantage of those Banks, and
avoid the engaging of themselves in a disadvantagious Battle, the which they
cunningly foresaw and opportunely shunned, as that in the loss whereof the
greatest mischief did consist which could befall that State: and that the
Austrians might not find wherewithal commodiously to maintain themselves in
that Country, they took away the Militia, Artillery, Ammunition, and Victuals
from the Cities, Towns, and Villages, and brought them into their strong holds,
and what they could not readily convey away they fired, to the end that the
Enemy not finding wherewithal to maintain themselves and Horses, might change
their minds, and retire from thence without the hazard of a Battle.

Waymer and Horn finding by their Intelligence that Holke came upon their
backs, and fearing lest being shut up in Bavaria they might be enclosed by the
Caesarians and Bavarians, (who were with considerable numbers equally advanced
toward the River Par,) they passed to Dunawert, and encamped themselves
between Ratisbone and Amberg, dividing their Forces into the Bishopric of
Aichstet, which after some defense made by the Castle, which for six days
bravely maintained it self, it fell into their hands, being only environed
with ancient Walls, not able to withstand the Cannon.

Walesteine being come to Goltz and having easily taken it, (the Saxons having
at his first appearance abandoned it) and finding that his policy could not
prevail, but that all his propositions were refused by the State of Saxony,
which were aware of his ends, and whither his ambition did secretly aspire, he
thought good to move a new treaty of agreement, and to put far more moderate
Conditions, which he would have Albert Duke of Sassen Laremburg to open and
make known unto the Saxon Council, which subscribed to a Truce for other two
months, though nothing insued thereon by reason of the immoderatnesse of the
Electors pretensions, the chief scope whereof was, that the Edict whereby all
the Churches goods were to be restored to the Roman-Catholiques should be
repealed.

This mean while the Imperialists who were commanded by Holke appeared between
Ratisbone and Egra; so as the Swedes finding what difficulties they should meet
withal by making any longer aboade in the Bishopric of Aichstet, they
retired toward Dunawert, thinking to secure themselves there, and watch over
the Austrians proceedings, who invited by the Swedes departure, got ground,
fired diverse Villages, and quartered themselves in those places which lie on
the West side and on the South between Dunanawert and Wilsborg.

AS the Protestants, proud of their good fortune, kept masters of the Fields;
so did the Roman Catholics, brought low by their bad success, endeavor
their own safeties within their surest holds; when the Ringrave, having by his
return into Alsatia, driven Montecuculi into Brisach, and housed him there,
and now more and more desirous to win so important a place, resolved to drive
the Imperialists from Newenburg, from whence those of Brisach might be relieved
with Victuals, which they might easily procure from their neighbors the
Switzers, who holding it for a wise rule in government, to get money, and to
keep it within their own Territories, easily give way to such requests as are
accompanied with gold; he therefore made have to sit down before it, and the
defendants having satisfied their Military duty in making six days defense,
upon agreement marched forth with bag and baggage. But Montecuculi,
foreseeing he could not keep Brisach from being besieged, and knowing that
the Horse Garrison was too great in respect of the small provision they had of
Victuals and Forage, he detained within the Town about 300 of the best
Horse, and dismissed the rest, that they might in the parts about Lindaw expect
the succor which was looked for from Milan and Bavaria; the coming whereof
did much encourage him to endure the Seige which the Swedes prepared to make.
The Marquess of Bentevogli and Bada did therefore go from Zugno, with about
600 Horse, and had their second quarters in Waldshut and Lauffnburg, and
marching from thence into the parts about Vberlinghom, they quartered in the
neighboring Towns, and by orders from Commissary Ossa, labored to fill up
their Companies (which by their past sufferings were much lessened) to the end,
that they might be ready to join with the Army which was expected from Milan.

Newenburg being taken, and no place being left in the power of the Austrians,
between Brisach and Basel, the Swedes gave order for the building of a Fort
over the Rhyn not far from thence, which might be able to stop the passing of
Boats, and resolved likewise to take in Waldshut, Laufuburg, Sckinghen, and
Rinfelden, and though in policy they ought to have forborne any thought
thereof, by reason of the continued league between the Switzers and those of
the house of Austria, by which the Switzers are particularly obliged to
withstand any offense that shall be offered by any whatsoever Prince, to any of
these four Towns, or of the rest upon the Lake of Constantz, (which
Agreement, if it had been observed, as in right it ought to have been, the
attempting of these places would have appeared to be vain, and the assistance
which so warlike a people might have administered to the Austrian Forces, would
have been very obnoxious to the Swedes designs in Alsatia and Swabenland) yet
were they encouraged to this enterprise by diverse of the chief Protestants,
particularly by those that were nearest neighbors to these Towns, and assured
by the Duke of Rohan who was then at Zurich for the King of France, that they
should be assisted underhand rather then offended by the Cantons (though the
Romanists appeared to be of another opinion) for as they differed in Religion,
so did they waver in their established promises, as not thinking that they were
bound to observe the Agreements made by their forefathers, who were of a
differing Faith. They therefore marched into those parts, to bereave the
Austrians thereabouts, of hope of victualling themselves in those Towns, and of
securing Brisach, either by water or by land as occasion should serve best, as
also to secure their quarters in the Countries of Salts and Fistemberg; they
marched along by the Territories of Basel, and making themselves masters
without much resistance of Seikinghem and Waldshut which were but weakly
walled, they set upon Rinfelden which stands upon the Rhyn, and is Fortified
with Walls and Towers after the ancient manner; and playing hotly upon it with
their Cannon, they forced the Garrison in six days space to yield up the
Town; whose example Laufnburg, a place of less defense, likewise followed.

Young Pappenheim (son to the Landgrave of Stulinghem) then Governor of
Cell, hearing the news of Bontivoglios being come into those parts, made haste
into the Field with part of his Garrison, and of such as were quartered
thereabouts, thinking to take Stofell, (a Castle on the top of a Hill in the
midst of an open Country) but as he was discovering some Barricadoes he was
slain by a Musketshot, to the resentment of the Soldiers, who were yet
comforted that another Pappenheim, whose name was Godfrey, was left to inherit
his youth and valiant actions. On the other side the Duke of Wirtenborg, with
6000 Foot and 8000 Horse had on all sides besieged Veling upon the Confines of
Swabenland in the County of Baar, a place of no small consideration for his own
interest, for 800 Foot and 300 Horse, commanded by valiant Captains* and who
were garrisoned therein, much infested and prejudiced all the neighboring
parts, by their continual excursions; and the harm they did was so much the
more remarkable, as that the Towns thereabouts belonging to the jurisdiction of
this Duke, the Inhabitants thereof could not stir out without being
indammaged or much afrighted by that Garrison for having made their fortunes by
the misfortune of war, like so many banished men, without any manner of dread
or fear, they made use of all occasions to surprise their Enemies; so as no
ways fearing the Wirtenberghers, but rather making merry with them as
Country People, not accustomed to war, they with frequent and bold Sallies
made them keep aloof off, and to their no small renown kept the Fort in
obedience to Caesar.

The Marquess of Bada hearing that Rinfelden was Surrendered, and that the
Ringrave was marching toward him, immediately removed his quarters from
Malhausen and Kerbin, retiring with his Foot to Constantz, and from thence past
along the Lake of Lindaw, passing his Horse to Vberlinghen, and from thence to
Ravensparg and Mimingen, there to attend and join with the Army which was
preparing in Lombardy.

Montecuculi being on all sides surrounded by the Enemy, was not,
notwithstanding any whit dismayed, but as a stout and valiant Cavalier,
surprised two Companies of Swedish Horse where they were quartered in
Bossinghom, cut the most of them in pieces, and returned to the Town with some
Carriages and 40 Prisoners, who were afterward set at liberty, that they might
not consume the Provisions which were to be spared for the defendants.

Colambac, Lieutenant Colonel to the Count of Nassaw, being left to keep
Colmar, incensed at the ill usage of his men, resolved upon revenge, and
drawing near Brisach, with 400 Horse and 700 Foot, he placed them in some
thick woods not far from thence; then feigning to convey some Merchants of
Sclestat, he made part of his men appear in sight of the Imperialists
Sentinels, much about noon, on the 16th of May; May, 16.
when Montecuculi was at dinner with Schamburg, where (well pleased with the
good success they had at Bossinghem) they according to the Dutch manner were
making merry; Montecuculi (hearing of this appearance, egged on by his
courageous heart, and encouraged by his late good success) streight-way went
forth accompanied with the greatest part of his Commanders, and took with him
200 Foot and as many Horse, wherewithal he boldly Charged the Swedes, who
retreating that they might bring him within their ambush, whereinto he so far
engaged himself, as that those that lay in ambush issuing out, and the way for
his retiring being block't up with Carts brought thither on set purpose by
Soldiers disguised in Country-mens apparel, they flew upon him so furiously,
as that though the Count did whatsoever a valiant Commander could do in his
own defense, he was borne by his Horse into a waterish meadow, and having
received three Musket shot and two wounds with a Sword he was taken prisoner,
and brought to Colmar, where wounded yet more with grief to see himself in
that condition, where not long before he had commanded in Chief, and seeing
small hopes of ransom, he departed this life the 17th of June following. Iun.
17.


This defeat and loss of so gallant a Commander was cause of sorrow to the
City and Soldiers, and was much resented by Caesar's self and his whole Court;
nay, the Swedes themselves were sorry for it, and in particular Colambac, who
proud that he had one of the Emperors best Commanders prisoner, said he would
have redeemed his life, with some of his own blood. Ernestus Montecuculi was
of one of the best Families of Modena, who from his youth having passed through
all the degrees of a Soldier, was arived at the place of General of the
Artillery to Ferdinand the second, and chief Commander of his Forces in
Alsatia; he was of a pleasing aspect, and sweet behavior, insomuch as
whosoever had conversation with him, must needs confess he was beholding to
him; no Commander in Germany would have outdone him in understanding, had
fortune been favorable unto him; Colambac being hereat puffed up, drew near the
Fort, and quartered himself with 600 Foot and 400 Horse at Beissen, not far
from Brisach, the like did the Marshall Turlach, who taking the Swedes pay, and
being then Governor of Brisconia, came with as many men as he could draw out
of the neigbouring Garrisons, and quartered himself between Frisberg and
Rotelen: Here began the first Siege that the Swedes laid to Brisach.

The Ringrave having made himself master of the forenamed Towns, and the
Castle of Stofell remaining yet untaken, came before it, took it in two days,
and to gratify the Duke of Wirtenberg made it be pulled down; then thinking
how advantageous it might be to the Swededs to take Villinghen which was
besieged by the Wirtenberghers (since besides the encumbrance it was to the
parts therabouts, it hindrered the Wirtenbergers joining with the Towns that
were toward the Rhyn) he marched thitherwards, thinking to effect his design,
and then to make use of the men that were employed in that service elsewhere;
but whilst he was upon his march, he was by fresh advertisement called back
into Alsatia, for fear of the Duke of Lorayne, so as he speedily went with all
his men to reinforce the Marshall Turlach. The like did his Brother Count
Phillipe, with Forces that he had drawn out of the neighboring quarters and
Garrisons. The Wirtenberghers this mean while hasted to accomplish the taking
of Vilinghon, who they said had cunningly prolonged the taking thereof, for
that if they had ended that siege (there remaining nothing else wherein to
employ themselves in those parts) they should have been necessitated to have
gone to re enforce the Swedish Army, and not only submit themselves to be
commanded by the General thereof, but (as it is usual to put men of least
respect upon the most toylsome actions) they would have been subjected to heavy
duties to the dishonor of their Prince.

The Forces which were raised in Milan by the Spaniards being in a readiness
to pass into Germany, to the succor of Alsatia, and the Frenchmen fearing
lest if they should not pass through the Valteline, they might endeavor to
possess themselves of the passages of Rhetia, through intelligence had with
some that were well wishers to the Austrian party, and minded their own
profit, 32 Companies of French Foot, and two of Horse, were with diligence sent
to those parts, which the Switzers permitted to pass, to the end that the
preservation of those passes or passages might be minded by such
re-inforcements; for the French who were no ways pleased with such Leagues,
did much apprehend lest, either surprised by the Spaniards or drawn by
friendship, they might be drawn to side with them; the free access of the
Grisons, to fall upon any occasion into the Valteline, and to shut out from the
State of Milan that Connection which it here makes with Germany being of great
importance. After these was moreover sent Henry Duke of Rohan, a well
experienced Commander, and of an acute wit, with absolute Command, who though
it were commonly bruted amongst Soldiers, and other people desirous of
novelty, that he would fall into the Valteline to disturb the passage of the
Spaniards, yet had he not order so to do, nor men sufficient for that purpose;
for these Companyes were so defective, as they did not in all contain 800 Foot
though the King paid for above 2000. as likewise the French had not then any
such resolution; for that they would not be the first that should seem to
break the peace with the Spaniard; the Duke of Orleans being in their power (a
weighty impediment) as also not to hinder the several Provinces of Italy from
weakening themselves, by sending out their Soldiers, and to weaken the State of
Milan, of their Forces; for afterward upon the first occasion of breaking with
the Spaniards, they might have the better advantage by setting upon them at
unawares, and in a time when they should have sent out all their necessary
defense, barring up the Passages of the Valteline then; for so it would be
easier for them to undertake it, then whilst those of Milan were full of
people, at every least noise of the stirring of the French, they as being
nearer might have first prevented them before they should have been entered
amongst the Switzers, and would have made themselves masters thereof, which was
indeed their desire; and which would have been very prejudicious as well to the
French, as to other Princes. These were the reasons likewise why they deferred
the performance of their promises to the Swedes, and Grisons, and made it be so
noysed about to cloak their desire of not pulling upon them so heavy a war;
though some who subscribed to the flattery of their own desires, spread abroad
opinions, that they would not shut up the Spaniards passage, for that the
Spaniards going to molest Germany, not well tolerated by that Nation, which
not accustomed to the usual hardness of lying in the field, by falling short
in their numbers, and miscarrying, weakened the Spaniards power, or by
preserving themselves, to cause more fear in the Swedes, and make them when
they should be in great need of their assistance, fly unto them for protection,
and make offer of those places unto them, which could not (but by necessity) be
taken, that thus whether the Spaniard should be victorious or losers, the
sending of the Forces out of the State of Milan, was very advantageous for the
French.

In this uncertainty of times, and present revolutions, Heydelberg the
Metropolis of the lower Palatinat (which some months before was besieged by
the Swedes) was constantly kept by the Imperialists; whereupon the old Ringrave
who commanded the Forces that were before it finding that every longer delay
withdrew much from his reputation, and knowing how behovefull it was, that that
Town should be taken, before the Italian Forces should have past the
Mountains, or that the levies in Lorayne were in a readiness; as on the
contrary how advantageous it would be for the Austrians to have that place, as
a safe retreat for their Forces, very fitting to lie before Wirtenberg, and the
Palatinate, so as where he perceived force would not avail he applied cunning,
and resolved to make use of a stratagem; he therefore held intelligence with
some Inhabitants of the City, who were no ways inclined to the Caesarian
party; the business was luckily carried by means of a Drummer who employed
about the ransom of prisoners past frequently between the Camp and the Town;
he therefore made some of his Soldiers by night swim the River, who being let
in by the aforesaid intelligence, possessed themselves of that side of the Town
or Suburbs which was next the Champion, or open Country, and let in the Swedes:
whereupon the Castle wanting Victual and supply ere long yielded, and 300
Dutchmen who had the Guard thereof, marched out of it on the first of June,
Iun. 1.
and being desirous to keep the Field, inroled themselves under the Swedish
Colors.

But if the Swedes advanced in Alsatia, the Imperialists were not idle in
Slesia, for falling upon one of the Saxons quarters they cut many in pieces,
took many prisoners, and brought away good booty. At this time likewise,
forty Carriages of Merchandise which went from Auspurg to Vim, were taken in
Swabenland by 400 Crabats.

The Duke of Bavaria seeing Waymer and Horn departed from his Territories,
bethought himself to drive the Enemy from Neuburg, (which lying upon the
Danube, between Dunawart and Ingolstat, much affrighted the neighboring
parts;) by the taking whereof, he should not only bring his Forces to flank
upon Dunawert, but by his reinforced Garrison therein, would have kept the
Swedes in continual suspicion, and have made them forbear their inrodes. He
therefore raised his Army from before Monaco, and together with Aldringer,
presented themselves before the Walls thereof, from whence they were saluted
with diverse Cannon-shot; for the Garrison being encouraged by Horn (who at the
news hereof, having quitted his quarters and passed over the Danube at
Dunawert, hasted for their succor) they vigorously persisted to defend their
imperfect Walls, yet all this would not do, for the Town being straightly
beset by Aldringer, (who began to be ashamed that he had spent so much time in
taking a Town which was by every one given for lost) it was forced to
surrender before Horn could bring succor.

The Prince of Orange was not this mean while less diligent before Rimberg,
for streightning it continually more and more, and not suffering it to be
succored by 7000 choice Spaniards, who used their best skill to get into it,
the Town not able longer to resist the Hollanders, yielded, and took Laws
from the Enemy; the taking hereof was a great detriment to the Spaniards in
those Provinces, and very available to the Hollanders, since thereby they
enlarged their bounds toward the Electorate of Coln, and opened the way on
that side along the Rhyn.

The Emperors Army, and the like of the Duke of Saxons were yet in Slesia,
facing each other, so as Walestein, perceiving there was no way to drive
Forreiners out of the Empire, but by being reconciled to Saxony (for he very
well understood the Caesarian Forces could not be restored to their former
splendour, nor yet Germany freed from the incursio^s of strangers, without good
correspondency had with that Prince, who with a flourishing state and
considerable Army flanked upon Bohemia, a Kingdom that lay open on that side,
so as it behoved Imperialists either to guard it by a great power of men, or
leave it to the discretion of the Saxon Forces, and that the Imperial Forces
being either the one or the other way divided, could neither advance further in
their conquests, nor yet could perfectly defend themselves on all sides;) he
reassumed with forged designs the Treaty of Peace by him so much desired,
and propounded a new suspension of Arms, which was entertained by the Elector,
as making much for his advantage; for the Emperors Forces were very much
greater then were his; and Walestein, feigning to expect an answer from Vienna,
he held the Elector and his Counselors in hand, (which by his money he made
his friends) seeming to be very ambitious of their friendship. Gustavus Horn
being certified by some Fugitives, how that a Convoy of Bavarians were going
into Newmarch, with many Waine-loades of Victuals to replenish that City, he
straight put foot in stirrup, galloped after them, and being come up unto them,
broke some Companies of Crabats that were their guides, and took the
Provisions from them; he then came before the City, and raised his batteries
in fitting places against it; the defendants did for some days make good their
Party against him; but at the last, seeing the Swedes ready to make a fair
assault, and fearing, lest with the City they might lose their lives, they
quitted the Town, and the Swedes were let in.

The 15 days of Truce, concluded between Saxony and Walesteine, were already
past. The Elector, who saw himself so much entreated, hoysted his pretensions
much higher; Walesteine, who though he very much desired Peace, could not in
reason yield unto the Elector, for he stirred not a whit from his resolution of
having the Swedes likewise included, whose vast pretensions the Emperor could
not otherwise satisfy then with the Sword; the Treaty broke off, for the
Elector would make no resolution without the consent of all his Colleagues, nor
would Walesteine do any thing which might withdraw from the value and
estimation which he coveted to preserve himself in. Enraged therefore at these
unfortunate lets, and the impediments he met withal in all these Treaties, be
suddenly set upon Sweinitz, but he lost many men in sundry assaults which he
made, being moved rather thereunto out of anger then for any hopes he had of
good success; and believing, that by this hostility might the sooner bring
the Elector to conclude a Peace. The City being succored by the Saxons, he
forsook the enterprise to keep himself from losing more men, which by reason
of their scarcity were much prized by him.

At this time Count Crats commanded the Duke of Bavarias Forces; he was a well
verst Soldier, and one who had given good proof of his experience in War.
He was a Low-Countreyman, borne in Luxemb^rg; he had for a long time, by reason
of private differences, borne but little good will to Walesteine, before
Walesteine was arrived at the absolute command of the Emperors Forces; who
likewise continuing his inward hatred to Crats, and villifying him in all his
discourses, commanded such Captains of his, as upon any occasions were sent to
assist Bavaria, that they should not obey Crats his commands. Crats on the
other side, caring as little for Walesteine (whom he termed by the name of
Beast, Madman, and of one that was no ways fitting for the place that was
conferred upon him) their passions were grown to that height* as Crats, who
found himself inferior to Walesteine in command, did not only envy
Walesteines preferment, but was not well contented with the Duke his Master;
for diverse of the Bavarian Courtiers who were his rivalls, did by Court-policy
endeavor his downfall; and the Duke himself not thinking it now time to renew
jealousies, which upon other occasions were too rise amongst them, and standing
in need of Walesteines assistance, holding the place he did, nor yet being
willing to cashier a servant, who by many years good service had merited much
at his Highness hands, kept Crats without other employment in Ingolstat,
whilst those that were under his command were in the Field, so as not cont^nted
with the actions of such as bore him ill will, Crats resolved to be revenged of
them. He therefore, by means of a Trumpeter, who upon occasion of ransom of
prisoners, past and re-past between the two Armies, gave Horn to understand,
that he desired to speak with some one that might be confided in concerning a
business of great importance, Horn (who had already found Crats his
coffeehouse) listened hereunto, and applied himself unto the business; so
as some few days after, at which time he sent his Trumpeter touching the
ransom of some prisoners, Crats discovered, how that being uncivilly used by
Walesteine, and but coldly looked upon by the Duke his Master, he was resolved
to quit the service, and make it appear what prejudice they did unto
themselves who evilly entreat their servants, or suffer them to be misprised by
their Officers; that therefore he would deliver up Ingolstat into the hand of
the Swedes; the Trumpeter (ambitious to appear a good negotiator in a
business of such weight) encouraged Crats with hopes of great preferment:
whereupon some Companies being about this time expected in exchange of some of
the Garrison, he agreed with the Trumpeter, that he should acquaint Horn, how
that he would have him advance toward the Town, the night before the coming
of the others, for that he would make the other Officers believe that they were
the expected recruits, and so let them into the City. The Trumpeter, who very
well underwood Crats his meaning, informed Gustavus Horn punctually thereof
who was well pleased with this Plot; and believing it to be a thing very
feacible, he re-advertised Crats, that he would not fail to send fitting
Forces at the appointed time; he therefore communicated this design to
Schavalichi a valiant Colonel, who was to take the charge of this enterprise,
and who made choice of 1000 Horse and 2000 Foot, and did with those secretly
and opportunely present himself before the gates of Ingolstat on the 13th of
May. May, 13.
But that very night the Bavarians being come thither, (who by reason of the
Swedes proximitie had hastened their march) they were let into the City; and
the Swedes arriving after them, made as if they were those who were expected
for supply; but though Crats was much for their being let in, alleging that
they were other Soldiers sent unto him for another design, and for a greater
inforcement; yet the greatest part of the Garrison (being true to their Prince,
and not thinking it became a wise Governor to throw open the gates of so
important a place, in time of War, and by night, to so many men, of whom they
stood not so much in need, but that they might tarry without till the morning;
and being moreover jealous, by reason that the Bavarians Officers who were
arrived, affirmed, they did not know of any but themselves of their Party that
were thereabouts) opposed Crats, and would not suffer them to be let in; so as
he seeing he had ^ailed of his aim, went together with some other Soldiers
out of the Gates, under pretense to know who they were, and being once out,
returned no more, but joined himself with the Swedes, and went with them to
Gustavus Horn^s Camp, where he was honorably received; and because Princes
receive much advantage by the coming over of such Commanders who have served
the Enemy, since thereby they are informed of the Enemies proceedings, and
intentions, and for that by the good usage of such, others may be invited to
do the same, Crats who was a man of eminent place and much verst in the
affairs of war, was in a small time preferred to be Marshall of that Army.

This new resolution of Crats, (who had always been held to be of an
uncorrupted faith) seemed strange, and afforded diversity of thoughts to many
who deemed he might easily have delivered up unto the Swedes that City wherein
he commanded in Chief; and it did open the eyes of such, and make them better
advised, who endeavoring to injure a man do notwithstanding leave him means
to revenge himself.

This plot not succeeding, Holke marched toward Vilsbourg, and Waymer (that he
might hinder him from taking of Neumarch) sent Colonel Plat with 4000
Soldiers toward Wolfesteim, some whereof met with the Crabats, skirmisht with
them, and after a long fight with equal fortune there perished on both sides
about 100 men. The besieged in Brisach were not this mean while idle, but made
diverse gallant Sallyes, sometimes on this side, sometimes on that side the
Rhyn, wherein they were still more courageous then fortunate.

The Duke of Lorayne having got together a Body of 8000 fighting men, was ill
advised by his Officers, who had drawn him on with flourishing but fruitless
hopes, and was persuaded by that confidence which makes the greatest designs
answerable to desire, though he was advertised by the Spaniards, (who were
preparing in Lombardy to pass over into Alsatia) not to take in hand any new
design, till such time as they were come with their Forces to the Rhyn, which
being joined with the Lorayners, they did not only think to drive the Swedes
from thence, but entering into Lorayne, to defend that Dukedom from the
Invasion of the French; a business which tended much to their ends; for by
bringing their Forces into that state, they did not only think to hinder the
French from breaking in thereinto, which they should always afterward have
feared in Alsatia and Luxemberg, but putting Garrisons into Nancy, Mota, and
other the best Towns of that State, they should make themselves absolute
arbitrators of that Princes will, they should open the way to the Dutch Armies
through this Country into France upon any occasion of breach, they should make
their journey more safe and short from Germany, Italy, and Burgundy into
Flanders, and assuring themselves that the French would not so easily bring
their Forces upon the Rhyn, nor set footing in Germany, whilst Lorayne stood in
defense of the Austrians, who hardly quit those places they are once possessed
of, and the Swedes being far from receiving assistance from that Crown, and
environed by the Imperialists, they would make but small abode in those
Provinces which were slenderly inhabited, uncultivated, and already consumed by
the misfortune of war.

The Duke disquieted by the Counsel of those who were ambitious to show their
valor before the Spaniards should partake of their glory, was persuaded to
make his men advance into Alsatia; and raise the Siege of Haghenaw. Some are of
opinion, that the Duke was hereunto persuaded by some who depended upon France,
to the end that he breaking his promise made unto the King, such an occasion
might put the French upon the possessing themselves of that State, before the
Spaniards should come thither; at which the French were not a little troubled:
for that if the Spaniards should (as they easily might) nestle themselves here
together with the re-inforcements which by the addition from Flanders, Germany,
Burgunies, and Italy, they might receive, and peradventure of some turbulent
French, these last (the nature of whose nation it is to show their ^icklenesse
upon any the least pretense) when they should have so secure a sanctuary to fly
unto, would have less respect to the duty they owe unto their King, and openly
manifest their ill intentions; So as that France being on all sides environed
by the Spanish Forces, injealousied by the Intelligence of Rebels, kept by the
Austrians from being succored by their friends, their Forces lessened by the
Imperialists vast undertakings, and war being mantained in Lorayne, Artois,
Alsatia, and Burgondy, might peradventure not be troubled with them. Lorayne is
oportunely situated upon Germany on the East side, Burgondy on the South,
France on the West, and Luxemberg on the North. the Lorayners being savoured by
great winds and rain, Aug. 10.
did on the tenth of August so bravely assault the Swedes, who were advanced to
^faffen Hoven as at the very first encounter Roffawes Regiment of Horse being
worsted by the Lorayne Horse, faced about, and by their retreat infusing fear
into the rest occasioned no small harm unto themselves; which might easily
have been pursued had the Lorayne Commanders been more sufficient, and not the
Colonels Ransaw and Viston who were well experienced Gentlemen, and commanded
the Swedish Forces at this time ( Berchenfeild who had the charge of the field
not being there) used their valor and advisednesse; for they instantly sent
some horse into the Wood whether their Soldiers were fled, who gave out that
the gross of the Enemies Body were on that side, and that therefore there was
no hope of escaping but by facing about to the other side, which was made good
but by a few of the Enemies; those who through fear were formerly imbased
being possessed with this conceit (as it is usual for men to believe that which
they most desire) spurred on toward the gross body of the Loreynes, hoping
there to find a more easy escape, and comforted hereby did so far advance,
as that the fear wherewith these were first possessed passing to their
adversaries, (who were amazed to see so strange a resolution, and thinking it
to proceed from desperation, which ought oft-times to be feared,) they betook
themselves to their heels, where being pursued though timerously and in
disorder by the Swedes, many of them were taken Prisoners, amongst which were
Monsieur de Fiorville, and the Lord Min^ourt (men of great account.) In this
action that I may not term it a Battle since there was no encounter of
Armies, but only retreats, there dyed on the one and the other side about 800
men: the Loreyners left behind them 6 pieces of Cannon, and 100 Carriages of
Baggage and Ammunition, to the greater resentment of the Austrians then of the
Duke himself; for hereby they saw how the King of France might take occasion
to wage War with Lorayne and prevent their coming thither, by which their
designs being discomposed, they could look but for little advantage from the
Forces of that Duke; nay, rather they were to expect much of mischief from
this his unadvised resolution, for every Achievement of France is a loss to
Spain.

The flight of some of Rossawes Horse which got into Strasbourg, was so
direful tidings, and occasioned such fear in those people, as that the news
thereof arriving at the Swedish Camp before Brisach, it gave them an allarm,
and made them prepare to raise the Siege, that they might succor their
Compagnions, when hearing the truth of this last gotten Victory, whilst the
Trumpets with their Sourdets sounded to Horse, they were again comforted, every
man's countenance was cheared, the Cannons played for joy, and bowls of Wine
went off apace.

The French perceiving more clearly the Duke of Loraynes evil intentions by
his continuing intelligence with the Austrians, his hostile proceedings against
the Colleagues, his despising the Kings admonitions, his violating of his
promise made the year before unto his Majesty under his hand, his complotting
with the Enemies of France in businesses much prejudicial to that Crown, and
discovering more particularly how the Marriage was concluded between the Duke
of Orleans and Princess Margueret (the Dukes Sister) contrary to the
Fundamental Laws of that Kingdom, which inhibite Princes of the Blood to
marry without the Crowns consent; and thinking now that they had just cause to
resent the Dukes actions, which were altother contrary to his promises; and
finding moreover that the Duke of Feria was marching from Milan, with an Army
thitherward, with intention when he should have relieved Brisach, to come first
into the strong holds of that State, and by assisting of Flanders, Burgondy,
and Germany, to reduce the French affairs into a greater straight; The
Marshall De la Force, with 20000 Soldiers, without any further delay, threw
himself on the 20 of August into the midst of that Dukedom, Aug. 20.
and without any contestation made himself Master of the Field, and of all the
neighboring Towns; whereupon the Duke astonished at this news, knowing
himself not able to contest with the Forces of so great a King, and foreseeing
moreover the ruin of his state, if being obstinate to keep in Nancy, he
should quit the Campania, he resolved by the joint Counsel of his Subjects,
since he could not contend with so great Forces, to embrace such courses as
might rather tend to appease the King, then to irritate him yet more. He
therefore recommended the care of that place to the Cardinal Nicola Francesco
his Brother, and he himself, together with his Wife, and Sister in Law,
withdrew himself to Remiremont toward the Confines of Burgondy: and for that
his Majesty of France was chiefly incenst, that his Brother should Marry with
the Dukes Sister, and the Duke knowing, that if the Princess Marguerit should
fall into the Kings hands before the Marriage should be consummated, he would
break the Match, he resolved to send her disguised in Pages apparel, attended
upon by three of his most intimate Friends to her Husband into Flanders, which
insued without any interruption. He afterward sent the Cardinal toward the
King, Aug. 19.
who on the 19th of August met the King at Ponte Monson, by whom he was
graciously received. The Cardinal humbly desired the King to pardon any thing
that his Brother had done amiss, or wherein that State was concerned, which was
rather ready to put it self under his Princely protection then to provoke his
anger. The King gave gracious ear to what the Cardinal said, and replied; How
that the Duke without any occasion had given himself over to very evil
Council, that he had so often broke promise with him, as he could not now any
longer trust him, that therefore his firm intention was to secure himself of
all the Dukes Forts and strong holds, during the present Commotions in Germany;
and that he would have the Princess Marguerit in his custody; and that when
these things should be willingly yielded unto by the Duke, he should then taste
the effects of his Clemency.

The Cardinal having by these mannerly excuses moderated the Kings anger, and
saved himself from apparent danger, was not notwithstanding herewithall
satisfied, as indeed it made but little for him; for the King saw well enough
that all this was but cunning to defer the time till the Spanish Forces
should be arrived; wherefore the Cardinal, seeing himself environed on all
sides by the French, having no succor nigh, and finding the Spanish promises
not likely to take effect, agreed to surrender up unto his Majesty the New
City of Nancy, to discard forthwith such people as were there in pay, to
endeavor that the Princess Marguerit should be put into his Majesty's hands,
and totally to relinquish the Austrian union. But the Duke being after this
agreement gone from Remirem^nt to Bisansor, and causing no small jealousy in
the French by the slow disbanding of his Forces, as also that it appeared not
that he would forgo his addiction to the Emperor; and the King being to boot
with this, much more offended by reason of the Princess Marguerits escape, he
caused his Army to advance in sight of Nancy, and sent his complaints
interlaced with threats to the Duke; who thinking he was able by dissembling
the machinations of his desires to free the King from his suspicion, and being
imboldned by the Cardinal Richeleius invitation, to whom the King had
entrusted the government of all these affairs, and who then was at Charnes upon
the Mosell, he resolved (though not so advised by his Counselors) to go in
Person and speak with him, that so he might excuse himself, and by humbling
himself, procure the safety of his State, since there was no hopes of
maintaining it by force, or by aid from Spain. But the French, who were
little advantaged by their having the New City of Nancy, whilst they wanted
the Old, the New City being so situated as it was commanded by the other,
they resolved to secure themselves of the Old City likewise, without the which
they could not maintain themselves in the New one. The Cardinal, after having
reproached the Duke for his sinister comportments, totally averse to the Rules
of good State-government, he in the Kings name demanded of him the Old City,
expressing an intention, that when the Duke should make good his promises, the
King would courteously restore all unto him, whose aims were not to take what
belonged to another, but only to secure himself of such a ones loyalty, who
by failing therein might prejudice the Crown of France. The Duke, who very
well knew how hard a matter it was to get strong holds out of the hands of
powerful men when they were once possessed of them, was not well pleased with
this proposition, but being much vexed and troubled thereat, endeavored by
reasons palliated with promises, and other proffers to be therein excused; but
the Cardinal replying, that his instructions were to secure himself likewise
of the Old Town, which by all means he must have, and threat^ning the Duke
with some sinister success if he would not willingly surrender it; the Duke
much confused, and being on all sides environed by the French forces, knowing
that he could not evade the blow, ^ likewise apprehending danger of his own
life, signed the agreement, and caused the Town to be delivered up into the
hands of the Kings Officers; but upon these conditions, that neither should the
Citizens be disarmed, nor the Duke deprived of his Revenue. Thus on the 24th of
September they took possession of it, Septem. 24.
and 6000 Foot entered the Town, with straight charge to use the Inhabitants no
otherwise then if they were the Kings Subjects; and the Duke returned much
incensed to Remiremont, and much more desirous to depend still upon the
Caesarian Party.

Whilst these businesses were in hand, the Duke of Fearia made every day more
haste then other, whereby he made the Frenchmen fear that the Spaniards
design was to pass into Loreyne when they should have freed Alsatia, and to
make Saint De^y which was a very fitting place their Magazine of Arms, and so
advance to further conquests: But the Marshall de la Force prevented them in
the seizing thereon, which being notwithstanding contrary to the Articles of
agreement made with the Duke, the Marshall excused himself with coulorable
pretenses, as having only done it to hinder the Spaniards designs, not to
bereave the Duke thereof; and did at the same time demand many other Towns and
places whereinto he apprehended the Austrians might enter, and put Garrisons,
which were all granted unto him by the Duke, who knew he was not able to
detain them from him.

The Ringrave hearing of the Loreyners motion toward Hagenaw rose from before
the Siege of Brisach with his Regiment of Horse, and with 1500 Foot of the
neighboring parts, and marched speedily toward Pfalsberg upon the Confines of
Alsatia; but as soon as he had set footing on those Frontiers, 'twas said the
French wished him to forbear any hostility against those Towns that belonged
to the Duke, for that they neither required nor stood in need of his Forces to
damnifie him. This advice did more confirm the opinion of those who openly
showed their jealousies of the French, conceiving that they did not greatly
desire the Crown of Swethland should get any greater power, nor that that
flourishing Kingdom was well pleased with the Neighborhood of that warlike
nation, needy, and desirous to enjoy such commodities as their own Country did
not afford them: as likewise for that they were of a Religion which not long
since had been ^o pernicious to France.

The several Sieges of Brisach, Hagenaw, Filisburg, and Vilenhem, (four
places of good consideration) were all this while continued, which might rather
be termed Sieges, permitted by reason of the far distance of the Austrian
Forces, then caused by the Swedish Arms, for there were not 20000 men in all
before these four places. The Spaniards prepared to pass over the Mountains,
when Horn (resolving to encounter with them, and at the very first to disturb
their designs before they should get footing in Swabenland) went from Bavaria
4000 Horse and 6000 Foot, and coming into the Territories of Mimingen and
Kempten, endeavored, though in vain, to surprise some of those Towns.

The Castle of Keisersperg seated upon a hill between Colmar and Sclestat, and
defended by 200 Loreyners which had been a little before besieged by Colonel
Harf, compounded and took in the Swedes, and the Garrison went home to look to
their own vintage, being all of them boars of Loreyne. The besieged within
Brisach desisted not this mean while from making continual Sallyes, and
surprising some quarters, as well to molest the Swedes as to seek what they
stood in need of, and to defend the Fort. Amongst many of their Sallyes, they
made a very fierce one both on this and on that side the Rhyn on the first of
September; September. 1.
wherein their Cannon did so thunder as that the Swedes knew not what to think
of the novelty: but the next morning 'twas known that this was done to the end
that the Swedes keeping their stations, might not hinder the passing of a Bark
loaded with Salt, which was brought to the Town along the Rhyn by a Bargeman
of Basel, who was often wont to bring commodities to the Swedes Camp, to which
purpose he had a pass from the Ringrave and the Marquess Turlach, whereby he
abused the Sentinels, who thought he would have staid in their quarters as he
was wont, and therefore let him pass. They again Sallied forth on the 9th of
the same Month with a considerable boldness upon the quarters of Colonel
Chamare; September. 9.
from whence being repulsed with loss, about 20 of them were slain, and many
taken Prisoners, who reported that the City was in a very bad condition, there
not being allowed above three pounds of bread for every two days, two measures
of wine, a spoonful of salt, the eight part of a pound of oil, and three
pound of flesh every week; and that many in the Town were sick and wounded,
who perished for want of looking to. The Prisoners were sent back again into
the Town, it being no policy in war to weaken those places in their numbers
of men, which they intend to take by Famine.

The Duke of Berchenfield, (who as we have said went with part of his men to
indammage Lorayne) set upon Dacsten, a place maintained by the Lorayners, which
place having endured eight days batteries, yielded, the Garrison marching
forth with the sole safeguard of their lives.

The besieged within Hamelen, a strong and considerable place seated along the
Vesser, between the Dukedom of Braunswich and the Landgrave of Hesses Country
began now to taste the incommodities of a siege, being wearyed with continual
duties, and weakened by want of Victuals, when Count Cronesfield, and Merodes,
(who seemed to be much troubled that so important a place should be lost, which
was the Magazine of all the adjacent parts, and the only support of all the
adjacent parts, and the only support of all the other Towns which yet held
out for the Romanists in those Provinces) after long consultation how to bring
succor thereunto and to keep that City from the Swedes, did jointly and
deliberatly resolve to march thitherwards and carry with them requisite
relief: having therefore joined their men with those of the Bishop of
Onaspruch Benicausen, the Elector of Coln, of Mentz and all the Soldiers which
they could draw out from the neighboring Garrisons, they marched thitherwards.
The Duke of Lunenburg and Milander the Lieutenant General, upon advice what
was to be done in this case of importancy, hearing how the Roman-Catholiques
were marching toward them, left some Regiments for defense of their quarters
before the City, and to repulse the Sallies which upon such an occasion the
besieged might make, and resolved to meet the Austrians with the rest of their
Army, and if occasion should serve to give them Battle upon the best
advantage they could. The Trumpets sounded, the Drums beat, Melander ordered
the Vanguard, and began to advance toward the Enemy, and hearing that they
were already come to Seghelhont, and that there as in an advantageous place
they had haulted and entrenched themselves he advanced to Oldendorp, a Town
some half a League distant from Seghe^hont, whither the Duke of Lunenburg also
came, and Marshall Chinepansem, with the rest of the Army, composed of 22
Regiments of Horse and Foot, and drawing their men into Battaile-array, upon
the rise of a little Hill they made Trenches for the better safety of their
Camp, and disposed of their Cannon in the fittest place, that there they might
observe what the Austrians did; who showed their courage in diverse skirmishes,
making as if they prepared for Battle; whereupon the Swedes resolved to
advance, and encounter them before they should draw near to Hamelen, in the
taking whereof the Swedes were no less concerned then the Romanists were in
the loss. July 8.
Therefore on the eighth day of July in the morning, their Battaglions of Foot
being ordered, and their Horse drawn out into Squadrons they thus composed
themselves: upon the right hand of Oldendorp and underneath the Hill in a place
between the Village and Seghelhont, stood the Protestant Army in a long but
close form; the left horn of the Vanguard consisted of 3500 Horse of the
Regiments of the Colonels, Stallans, Soope, Abelton, Sakhe, Bergeanson, Ritemb,
Lenes, and Milander, with 35 Standards of several Colors, and divided into
five Bodies, which were led on by Milander himself, who marched in their Front
armed with a Cuirace upon a gallant sorrel horse; upon the Flanks of these
followed two Regiments of Dragoones, being in number 2000, the one belonging to
Ragge, the other to Bellins, 4000 Foot divided into three Battaglions belonging
to the Regiments of Lunenburg, and Kniphausen marched in good order in the
Front of the Battle, under 28 Banners of Blew and Yellow; after which followed
the Body of the Battle, composed of other 4000 Foot, divided into three
Battaglions, consisting of the Regiments of the Colonells, Lanstrells, Count
Erbesteime, and the Landsgrave, under 36 Banners of Orange Color, and Green,
which were commanded by the Duke of Lunenburg, armed with a Cuirace, and
mounted upon a Daple-gray Horse; on the right Horn, led on by Kniphausen, were
the Horse Regiments of Colonel Catberg, Brunch't, Sicherich, Rosteim, and
Colonel Del-vich, divided into four Squadrons, under 32 Cornets, which were
backed by 500 Dragoones; the Cannon was thus disposed of; upon the left Wing 15
Fieldpieces, 17 great pieces were in the Front of the Battle, and 10 pieces
of Cannon stood upon the Hill on the right side.

The Army being thus ordered, and having sung some of David's Psalms, the
Soldiers being encouraged with great hopes of booty which was said to be in
that City, and exhorted to fight with their wonted valor, the sign of
Battle was given, and they began to march toward Segelhont, forth of which
Village Merodes, Cronesfield, Benecausen, and the Baron Harmortin, (their
Artillery being disposed of) ordered their men, which were about 14000 as
follows. On the Vanguard were three great Squadrons of Horse, all
Cuirasseers, composed of the Regiments of the Colo^ells, Baron D'Ast, Muffter,
Merodes, Cronisfield, and Benicawsen, under 24 Standards led on by Count
Cronisfield; after which, followed in the Front of the Battle, 6 bodies of
Foot of the Colonels, Flormesin, Renech, Ghelans, Westreiholt, Leid, Orst, and
Waldech, under 40 Ensigns, commanded by General Merodes, upon the back
whereof, on the left Wing stood Merodes his Regiments of Dragoones, the
Cuirasseers of Colonel Ovald, Ruffean, and Westhall; and upon the right Wing
the Horse of Biland, Bort, and Cronisfield, which were commanded by Marshall
Benicawsen; after which followed three other Regiments of Foot, and after these
the Reare-ward, composed of the Regiments of the Colonells, Oor, Bort, Guas,
Pari, and the Regiments of Coln and Westfalia, before which went 13 piece of
Cannon, and 16 on each side of the Flanks. Both the Armies being thus ordered,
each General having called together his chief Commanders, and consulted upon
what was to be done, though Merodes condiscended not to give Battle, but
rather to force the Enemy to abandon the Siege, by temporizing and keeping them
from Victuals; yet Cronisfield (who was therein followed by all the rest of
the Commanders) made the necessity of fighting appear; the resolution was
taken, which was unanimously expected by the Swedes, who it may be foresaw
their future Victory. Whereupon each Army saluting other with many Vollies of
Cannon, and Sta^ousems, Soopes, Iansons, Catburgs, and Bruncht's Regiments of
Horse, advancing bravely against the Squadrons led on by Cronisfield, the
skirmish grew very hot, where the Swedes giving back, being much indammaged by
the Romanists Cannon, Melander gave on so courageously with the Regiments of
the left Flank, as that the Regiments of Baron D'Ast, Viper, Muster, and
Valteberg, (who were with his Sword in hand led on by Merodes) charging them
with no less valor, the bickering grew so fierce, as after the first charge
of Horse, the Foot Battaglions advancing in due distance; the Field pieces
loaded with Musquet-bullets playing, and the Muskets continuing to hail down
shot, the Battle between Fronts of each Vanguard, was so well fought, as from
three a clock after Sunne-rising till noone, though great slaughter were made,
Fortune seemed to lean to neither side: But Kniphausen coming in with the
Regiments of Rags and Bellins, and two Squadrons of Horse, where M^rodes
fought stoutly with the Enemies horse, and letting fly 12 piece of Cannon
which were concealed amongst his Squadrons, before the Caesarians could adjust
themselves, their Files being dril'd through, and their Squadrons disordered;
Hasseos Horse came in so furiously, and some Finlanders, led on against the
Romanists by Colonel Vich, as that charging them home before they could give
fire to their great Gunnes, and making themselves Master of the station where
the Artillery was placed (which being loaded and ready to be discharged, they
turned upon the Regiments of Vestriolt, Leid, Valdech, and Orst, which came to
succor Merodes) and after this, charging upon the Imperialists Pikes, where
for a good while they were bravely withstood by the Foot of Flormesin, Renech,
and the abovesaid Vestriolt, Leid, Valdech, and Orst: Merodes being at last
mortally wounded, and many other Captains slain, and at the same instant,
news being voyced that the Duke of Lunenburg had broken and routed the
Romanists Horse on the other side, where they fought no less courageously; and
hereunto being added, that through that days excessive heat the Horse were so
harrassed, as they were no longer able to keep upon their legs, and the
wearied Soldiers throwing away their Arms, the Roman Catholics began to
fly. Whereupon, Milander finding the advantage, gave on again courageously
upon the Enemy, broke their Pikes, and trod their Foot underfoot, and charged
the Romanists Battaglions twice through and through, who though they were
afterward endeavored to be rallyed by Cronisfield, and other Commanders all
purpled over with blood, they could not keep their Soldiers from flying; as
also some of the Officers, who throwing away their Arms, some here, some
there, sought to save themselves by their feet. The Protestants Horse pursuing
them, did such execution, as that for three miles space the ground was covered
with dead Carcasses, and about 2000 prisoners taken, many whereof were wounded.
The Romanists lost in this Battle 50 Ensigns and Standards, or Horse and Foot
Colors, thirteen piece of Cannon, 800 Carriages of Baggage and Ammunition,
Merodes his Cancellaria, 5000 Soldiers, and their General Merodes, who some
days after dyed of the wounds he that day received. The Battle endured from
two hours after Sun rising till two hours after noone. Cronifield, though
wounded in the thigh, retreated with the residue of his men to Minden, a strong
place upon the same Wesser; he was much troubled at this misfortune, but not
at all therewith daunted; and dispatching Posts speedily away, with news hereof
to the Electors and Ecclesiastic Princes, he resolved not to give way to
Fortune, but to recruit himself, and by revenge recover his loss.

This was so great a defeat to the Romanists, as it did not only draw tears
from the Elector of Coln, and Mentz (the safety of the one, the remitting of
the other into his lost estate, consisting in this Army) but caused strange
fear in the hearts of all the Inhabitants thereabouts; and more particularly
it much dis-heartned the besieged, who seeing Merodes his Wife, and the wives
of many Captains who were taken prisoners, together with the Austrians Baggage,
sent by the Swedes in honorable equipage toward their City, thereby to let
them know how the succor they expected was utterly routed, they resolved to
parley and to yield up the Town, on condition that they might march forth with
their Arms, Baggage, 14 Coaches, and two piece of Cannon, and that they should
have a safe Convoy to Minden; which being agreed unto, the Garrison marched
forth, consisting of 1300 Foot and 240 Horse, all brave and gallant men.

Henry Duke of Rohan was at this time at Zurich a Canton of the Protestant
Switzers; he was a Prince who favored, and protected the Protestants as much
as he did malign and bear ill will to the Papists, and in particular he hated
the Spaniards whose preparations in the State of Milan being by speedy
messengers certified unto him from Lombardy, he failed not to acquaint the
Swedish Generals there withal, with whom he held particular good
correspondency, and for that he was a man of great wisdom, and better at
machinations then any thing else; he considered the the taking of Constantz
would be exceeding prejudicial to the Austrian affairs, and that it might be
effected if it were not hindered by the Protestant Switzers; he therefore
applied himself to have this his desire effected by juggling; having therefore
secretly negotiated the business with the principal and chief men of the
Zurich Council, and being by them confirmed in his hopes, that they would
never take up Arms against the Swedes, he advertised Horn, Waymer, and the
great Councellor Oxesterne hereof, by the means of a Zurich Captain named
Vlrich, who though they knew that in the compassing of such an attempt, they
were to meet with many difficulties, for there was no good to be done therein
without bringing their Forces upon the Nelveticke Territories, and they knew
not how this being an injurous act, could be acceptable to those Cantons, with
whom the Swedes were by all means to hold correspondency; yet having well
weighed the business and disputed it pro and contra for a whole months space,
and being again assured by Vlrich from the Duke of Rohan of the easiness of
the enterprise which he had by excuses honested to the Switzers, they resolved
to bend thitherward, and endeavor the effecting thereof. Whereupon, the
Marshall advanced with 12000 men toward Velinghem; and seeming as if he would
set down before that Town, and end the business which was begun by the
Wirtenbergers, he on the sudden drew near to Steine upon the Rhyn, three
Leagues from Constantz, and required of the Burgers of the Town passage for
his men over that Bridge; who answering that they could not give way thereunto
without the leave of their superiors, and Horn replying he had no time to
lose in consultations, but that he needs must pass; and if that they would not
give way thereunto in a friendly manner, he would open his passage with those
keys which he brought with him (showing them his Cannon) they enforced by
fear gave way to that which they could not withstand. Yet it is thought that
this happened by former intelligence, had and agreed upon, and by Commission
given to the chief Magistrate of the Town by some of the leading men of
Zurich, who were suspected to be conscious thereof; for else there was no
likelihood that Horn should seek a breach with the Switzers, since it did not
stand with the Swedes interest to fall foul with those Cantons; as likewise
for that Steine might have held out (it being environed with good old Walls)
till it might have been relieved by its Masters, which might have been done the
next day; and though they had been forced to abandon it, by breaking the Bridge
which crossed the Rhyn, and was but built of Wood, they might have kept that Army
from advancing further; he then past over all his men by night on the seventh
of September, September. 7.
and leaving 500 Foot there, that upon any occasion he might secure that
Passage, he came the next day before Constantz; but by reason of his haste to
pass over the Rhyn at that place, before the Papists Switzers or Austrians
should have any notice thereof, which he doubted might be a difficult matter,
unless he made all the greater diligence; that he might make the more haste,
he left behind him his great Cannon, believing that the Duke of Wirtenberg
would furnish him with the like; but whither it were through the idleness of
the Conductors or some other let, 'twas six days before they came; so as the
besieged had not only time to communicate this news to the Governor of
Lindaw, and prepare for defense; but to receive a succor of 800 men, which was
speedily sent them by the Lake of Vberlinghem and from Lindaw. Costantz is a
very important situation placed upon the Lake, which from thence takes its
name, which does not only serve it for safeguard, but is of a great
advantange to it: the River Rhyn which comes forth of that Lake passes by the
North-side of it, by which means and by modern Fortifications, it is on that
side impregnable: toward the West and South on this side the Rhyn it is only
begi^t with single Walls, Towers, and Ditches after the ancient manner; the
Austrians not being able to make it more defenceable on that side, for
confining there upon the Switzers, and they being by agreements bound not to
have any so important Fort flanking upon them, all the endeavors formerly had
by the Austrians to fortify it, was hindered by the not consenting thereunto of
the Switzers Cantons: It is a City of reasonable precincts; it has in it three
Boroughs of no small consideration, it has formerly been a Privileged place,
and one of the Hauns Towns of Germany; but the Citizens thereof having
embraced the Protestant faith, and driven out all the Romanists, it was
enforced in the year 1548. by the Emperor Charles the first to receive those
they had driven forth, to set it under their hands, that they would obey such
orders in matter of Religion as should be given them, and such Laws and duties
as their neighboring States did, which were subject unto, and did depend upon
the house of Austria.

The Swedes entering upon the Switzers Territores, made such of their Cantons as
were Roman Catholics take up Arms, who not suffering the little account the
Swedes made of their Forces, in the contempt whereof they had trespassed upon
their liberties, and the confederacy which they held with the house of Austria,
on which Constantz did confide; as also for that they had great jealousies
least the Swedes might settle themselves there, and fearing their
correspondency with the other Protestant Cantons, (a breach of Union with whom
being in process of time made, they might be thereby much prejudiced) they
presently betook themselves to Arms, and having gathered together about 6000
Foot, they complained of the Swedes ill importments, and that it was suffered
by the Protestant Switzers; they prepared for revenge, and to maintain their
liberties; Lucerne and another of the Papists chief Cantons, dispatched away
their Deputies to complain hereof to those of Zurich, as being the chief of
the Cantons, and to incite them to take up Arms, and to drive the Swedes out
of the Helveticke Territories. The Inhabitants of Zurich, who by reason of
their diversity of Religion, their innate ill will, and other politic
respects, do not only hate the name of Austria, but do not well agree with
the very Switzers themselves who are Romanists, thinking for certain that a
man cannot be a good Roman-Catholique, unless he be a good Spaniard, excused
themselves with pretenses rational enough, and called a Diet at Baden upon
this occasion, to defer the time the mean while, till Horn might have taken
in Constantz: but the Romanists Switzers being persuaded and instigated by
those of Austria, they went to Rapswille, and from thence into the Country of
the Abbot of Saint Gallo to assist him, who having often times displayed his
banners against the Crown of Swethland in the Polaches behalf, did more then
any other apprehend their neighborhood; and for that the Roman-Catholique
Switzers, suspected that this was a plot contrived against them by the
Protestants, they writ unto the King of France their Confederate, desiring him
to interpose his Kingly Authority, that the Swedes might quit their
Territories; and in all places they made bitter exclamations against the
leading men of Zurich, making them accomplices of what had happened. Horn having
commanded his Soldiers to possess themselves of a Convent of Augustine Friars
called Crutzlingen, and which was a fitting place for them to lodge their
Cannon for battery, he reared against it two tire of Cannon, each of them of
four pieces, and began with fury to play upon their Walls, so as having in a
short time made a breach big enough for an Assault the Swedes gave on; but part
of a wall of a Tower that was contiguous thereunto falling down by a
Cannon-shot, did so shatter the Swedes flying Bridge which was by them thrown
over the Ditch and made to that purpose, as they that were first got in not
being seconded by their Companions the enterprise failed, so as they were
enforced to retire and desist from the undertaking, leaving about 30 of their
men behind them, and having many wounded in that action. Yet must we not
forget the valor of a Scotch Soldier who was of Major General Ruthens
Troop, and offered himself to bring some Prisoner to Horn, who much desired
it, that he might learn the Condition of the City; this man being one of the
foremost, ventered so forward in the breach, as that laying hands on one of the
Imperialists who stood in the defense thereof, he dragged him through the
Ditch, and presented him to the General.

About 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse of Neopolitans, Spaniards, and Lumbards, were
at this time gathered together in the State of Milan, and yet great
preparations were made by the Spaniards in Lumbardy, who though they made the
occasion of this their Arming to be upon pretense of succouring Germany, and
(as it had been generally noysed) to conduct therewithal the Cardinal Infant
(who had been at Milan ever since the midst of the preceding May) to the
government of Flanders; yet wanted there not many jealousies, that this was
only a piece of craft or cunning of that Nation, that they might the better
leavy men in Italy; not so much to succor Flanders, as out of an intention,
that if in this interim things should go well in Germany, they might make use
thereof in some important new affair in that Province: for many were of
opinion that the Spaniards could not suffer the French in Cassalle, and their
Forces there so apt to disturb their designs in Italy, since thereby their
pretensions of being acknowledged the Arbitrators of all the affairs between
the Princes of Italy was much lessened, whilst by this neighborhood of the
French, the Duke of Mantua who formerly did depend upon them, was discovered to
be totally fallen off from them, and to declare himself openly for the French.
The Commonwealth of Genua was not so obsequious to them, as of late it had
been: the Duke of Parma (who had always deserved well of the Crown of Spain,
and showed himself partial in that behalf) had declared himself a free
Prince, and to have no dependency on them: and for that the suffering of the
French to get head in Italy, was a diminishing of the power possessed by them,
so as they took into consideration how they might keep the Princes of Italy in
their former obsequency, and keep under the greatness of France. Thus men
found in their grave wisdoms, that it was not yet fitting time for the
Infant to part from Milan, and that his going from thence was for two reasons
to be deferred; the one for that the Italian Forces, unless seconded by those
of the Emperor, being of themselves weak and not able to overcome the Swedes,
who were fortified by so many Victories, if they should pass over the
Mountains, and not be faithfully seconded by Walesteine (who was not very well
satisfied with the Spaniards, whereby he might not be suffered to pass
further) much dishonor might redound to their Army; the other for that if he
should go from Milan, they should not so easily find means, without his
assistance how to order their affairs in securing themselves of the jealousies
they had of France, and keep the Italian Forces, who formerly depended on them,
in their fealty. It was resolved therefore, that the Infant should stay at
Milan, and the Duke of Feria should with the Army pass over the Mountains to
relieve Brisach; since that, if Brisach were lost in Alsatia, all their hopes
were lost of ever recovering such another Province, or of entering into Lorayne,
as it was the Spaniards intentions to do; and this being their way to pass
from Italy into Flanders, they were by all means to endeavor the preservation
thereof; but for that, by reason of the authority granted by the Emperor to
Walesteine, of being Generalissimo over all the Forces in Germany, the Duke of
Feria could not come thither with Walesteines satisfaction, without having a
dependency on him; and the Spaniards thinking it tended to their dishonor,
that a General of theirs, a Subject of so great birth, should be subordinate
to one, (who before by favor and fortune, he was arrived at this height) would
have thought it a great honor to be Colonel under a Spanish General; it
therefore not being yielded unto, that he should depend upon any one but the
Emperor, though it was forseene that Walesteine would be much scandalized
thereat, and that some mischance might thereupon ensue, yet by means and
endeavors of the Spanish Agents at Vienna, the Duke of Feria had his Pattent
signed to be Captain independent upon any one, save upon the Princes of
Austria.

The Spaniards this mean while not failing to arm afresh in Lombardy, applied
themselves to raise jealousies of the French in Italy. They were beyond measure
troubled, that Edward Farnesh Duke of Parma, varying from the Maxims of his
Predecessors (who always showed themselves to be well affected unto, and to
depend upon Spain) should as well in his apparel as in his Treaties follow the
genius of France, and that he did not adheare as his Ancestors had done to
their Counsels; and they were much more injealousied by reason of the alliance
concluded by the great Duke of Tuskany without their consent; for the Duke his
Father, having always borne respect to the Crown of Spain, and by the advice
of that King married Aldrobrandina, they by the reverence of the Father
challenged the same interest in the Son: Wherefore, that they might the
better discover his intention, they dispatched away the Regent- Villani to
Parma, with instructions to invite him to take upon the government of the
Forces in Flanders, as formerly his Uncle Duke Alexander had done; (a means
whereby they thought more clearly to discover his intentions toward them:)
who when he was come unto the Duke; though he managed his negotiation with much
dexterity, he at last discovered his Highness genius to be adverse unto the
Spaniards; and by his refusal to go into Flanders, and to admit of a Spanish
Garrison in the Citadell of Piacenza, he openly made it known, that he would
live like a free Prince, and no ways depending upon the Spaniard; so as
Villani, bringing but a bad report of him to Milan; and from thence, sending
the like information to Spain, his Resident received but unhandsome usage;
some Towns of the Piacentian Territories being pincht by Spanish Garrisons, and
an Agent of his being dispatched away to the Court of Spain, that many of the
Emperors Forces had been quartered in his Towns; he was but hardly handled by
the Kings Officers, not having so much as Audience allowed him, which was the
first beginning of the breach between the Spaniard and this Prince, as shall in
his proper place be said.

They could not moreover endure, that the Duke of Mantua should live under the
protection of, and be dependent upon the Crown of France; and it was reported,
That they held negotiation under hand with the Infanta Marguerita, that she
should marry the Princess Mary to the Infant, and at the same time by forcing
away that Princess, surprise Mantua, and in her right to have just cause to
invade Monteferrat, which they easily might have done, if Duke Charles, who was
watchful over his own affairs, and was faithfully advertised of all their
proceedings, had not applied speedy and fitting remedies thereunto; for knowing
the importancy of the affair, he instantly sent the Infanta Marguerita out of
the City, and taking good order for the safeguard of his businesses, he made
the Spanish machinations vanish into smoke; and the Infanta being brought to
Pavia, after she had been a while in that City (where she was always nobly
treated by the Spaniards) she was afterward sent for into Spain, and declared
to be the Vice-Queene of Portugal.

The Duke of Feria this mean while hastened his journey that he might bring
aid to Constantz which was battered by the Swedes, whose loss did much grieve
him, for the loss thereof would soon be followed by the like of all the
places thereabouts, and thereby likewise the passages of Tiroll would be lost,
which were so much watched over by the Spaniards in regard of the state of
Milan. Being come in the beginning of September to Vilchirchem, September.
he tried to pass over the Rhyn, a little above the Lake toward the Grisons,
and to enter into the Territories of Rentall, a Country which lies along the
said Lake on the side of Helvetia, and from thence into the Country of S.
Gallo, that he might join with the Papists Switzers, who having taken up Arms
against the Protestants, threatened revenge upon the Swedes; but this being
discovered by the Country people of Turgonia, who suddenly took up Arms and
went to Rhyn: He, that he might not the more incense those people, although he
might easily have forced his passage, turned his march another way.

The Duke of Rohan, who this mean while kept himself in Coira, to watch over
the preservation of the passages of Rhetia, passing from Coira to Baden, to
endeavor by this interposition, and the using of his Kings name, the
accommodation of the differences amongst the Switzers; and having by his
wisdom a little allayed the anger of those Cantons, he went to the Camp
before Constantz to speak with Horn; by whom being received with all terms
of courtesy, and discoursing with him upon the present occurrences, the
difficulty of the enterprise appearing, by reason of the continual succors
sent into the City, by the way of the Lake he dispatched away a Gentleman to
propound unto the Governor of Constantz, which was Count Volfegg, a man of
tried wisdom, that if he would take in a Garrison of the Switzers, and
deliver up the Town into their hands, he would work it so that the Swedes
should give over that enterprise: But this proposition carrying but little
soliditie with it, was quickly poised by the answer of Count Volfegg, who
replied, he did not think the Switzers were able to undertake such a work;
for if they were not able to hinder the Swedes from passing over the Rhyn at
Steine, nor to make them quit their Territories, they were less able to keep
that which belonged not to them; that the Emperor was his Master; that he
received Laws from noman else; and that with the loyalty that became a
Gentleman of honor, he would keep the Town against whosoever as long as he
had breath.

Rohan kept in the Swedes Camp, the Papist Switzers all in Arme^ murmured
mighty matters, the Cannons roared, the breach was proportionably made. When
Schamburghs Regiment, which was of Ferias Vanguard, being come into the City,
and therewithal much people and Ammunition, the assault was notwithstanding
delayed till more Forces should come, which were expected from the Duke of
Berchenfield. The mean while the besieged sallied courageously forth upon
Crantzlingens quarters, to hinder the approaches and break the batteries, but
were by the Swedes beat back, with the loss of about 40 Foot and 12 Hor^e,
and one Tower falling that day, the batteries began to play upon another on the
Lakes side.

The coming of four piece of great Cannon was expected, for those they had
did little good by reason of the smalnesse of their Boat, and the Duke of
Berchenfield was arrived with 4000 Foot and 3000 Horse: When news came, that
Aldringer being already parted out of Bavaria, was upon his march with 20
Regiments of Horse, and 4000 Foot, and that he had already taken Biberach,
being notwithstanding followed by D. Weymar, who was not far from the Swedish
Camp. The general assault which was intended to be made, were it either that
they stayed for the coming of these men, or that they would not hazard
themselves in vain, there being a great new succor entered the Town (which
added to those that were already there, and made about 8000 Foot) or for some
other reason, or for their good success, for which the Swedes had already used
all the devotions which in like cases they are used to do, was deferred.

Weymar being this mean while come to Gutleiben, (which was Horns quarter)
with the Colonells, Rotutchin, Vistem, Ransaw, Agofelt, and Plato, (prime
Commanders of that Army) and having spoken with him, after about an hours
secret discourse concerning the present emergencies, he immediately returned to
Cheli, where about his men lay. The next day, when the great Cannon appeared,
those who were desirous of it, were confirmed in their opinion that the Siege
should be longer continued, and the general assault should be endeavored. But
they soon found the error of their conceit; for Weymar being in have,
returned, and having wisely weighed the matter with Horn, that every the least
delay they should make there, conduced much to the prejudice of their designs
and interests; for the Austrians, who marched apace toward their Camp, might
easily have stopped their passage, environed them with their Forces, get
luckily into Wirtenberg and make use of the commodiousnesse and situation of
that State, totally to destroy the Swedish Army; they therefore thought it fit
suddenly to raise the siege, and necessary and fitting directions being given
to this purpose, their Cannon being withdrawn from the Batteries, the Foot in
handsome order backed by the Horse past over the Bridge, defending themselves
with as much gallantry as might be, against a brisk Sally which the besieged
made; insomuch as they burnt the barks, and showed themselves in the Field on
the other side the River in perfect Battaile-array.

The Swedes being risen from before Constantz, the Imperialists who were come
to the defense thereof, came out with great force and courage; and being
mightily incensed rather against the Protestant Switzer, then against the
Swedes, they over-ranne many of the Protestant Towns in Turgovia, dealing
hardly with many Protestants, where Allarms being given by their Bells, and
Kesserling the Serjeant-Major of the Country, he who being one of Zurich, moved
not at Horns arrival, made what haste he could thither; but not being able to
repress the injuries done by the Imperialists, he was sent as a man of quality
by those of his own side to acquaint the Colonels of the Papists Switzers, who
were yet at Vill, with this the Austrians incursion, and to present unto them
the injuries and violences done by those of Constantz, and to be counseled and
assisted by them; but as soon as he was lighted off horseback he was made
prisoner by the Roman-Catholiques, who gave no reason for it, but that he had
not entirely done his duty, at the coming of the Swedes; at which the
Protestant Cantons being mightily incensed, and more particularly those of
Zurich and Berne, they betook themselves to Arms, and were upon resolving to
break with them, had not the Duke of Rohan and Monsieur Violar the French
Ambassador, by their interposition and wise dexterity, moderated that heat
with threatening revenge in every ones breast was likely to have extinguished
friendship and to have kindled civil turmoyles, which would not so suddenly
afterward have been extinguished.

IT was now near the end of September, and yet Aldringer, entertaining
himself in the taking in of some places (particularly of Biberach) seemed
rather to tarry under this pretense, to keep back recruits from the Spanish
Army, then out of any necessity of taking in those places: Septem. 29
On the 29th of September ( Biberach being taken) he joined with the Duke of
Feria, and spoke with him at Ravenspurga a Town in Swabenland, between the
Lake of Constantz and Danube, where the Spaniards seemed not to be a little
comforted, that Walesteine had commanded his men to contemn their assistance,
or rather (it may be) desiring their ruin; so as they having got together an
Army of about 26000 fighting men, who were fit for any enterprise, the Duke of
Feria calling his chief friends together, discust the business with them,
what course they were to take to effect their Designs; the question propounded
was, whether they were to advance boldly, and not refuse the giving Battle, or
else more considerately, not to engage themselves in a business of such
importance, but to endeavor to get into Alsatia, and succor Brisach? Some
were for fighting, maintaining their opinions, by alleging; That they were
come into Germany with their Arms to make use thereof, not to let slip the
opportunity of winning renown; that there was a necessity of fighting, when
not to do so was prejudicial, and did imbasse the Soldiers; that all delay
was then harmefull, when diligence was advantageous; that the Soldiers were
already sensible of the inconveniences they under-went by the Countries being
destroyed; that they wished rather to dye fighting with hope of Victory, then
dispairing of their enterprise to live in fear; that the Neopolitan Horse
began to be destroyed, the Italian Companies to lessen, and the Enemy to grow
stronger; that it was better to encounter the Swedes whilst the Soldier was
strong and willing to fight, then not to be able to shun fighting when the
Soldier should be discontented and brought low; that the honor of the Spanish
Arms consisted in this Victory, as likewise the suppressing of the Enemy, and
so did the Austrian greatness; that it was true, the Enemy was strong in
Horse, but weaker in Foot, and differing in opinions; that all the expectations
of such as were well affected were lost, and the reports of their rivalls
augmented, when effects did not correspond with hopes, and with what has
publicly been divulged; that the magnificency of Spain was envied, every
going less whereof would be a heartning to those that feared them. On the
other side, those who inclined more to work their ends with wisdom and
circumspection, said; That they ought to consider what was the chief end of
all their endeavors aimed at, and that if their principal drift were to
succor Brisach, they should cheerfully intend that; that the Victory is said
to be had, when the thing endeavored is accomplished; if the getting into
Alsatia were the thing they desired, they must bethink themselves by what way,
and with what greatest security they might get thither; that the loss was
greater which they should receive by fighting with the Swedes, who were
experienced Soldiers, and greedy of Victory, if they should be by them beaten
then any advantage they should get if they should beat the Swedes; that they
very well knew the difficulty of re-assembling an Army, the tears shed by the
Neopolitans, the hardness they had suffered in Lumbardy, and how prejudicial
the sending out of men was to Spain, which was too much uninhabitated and
uncultivated; that they were to make much of those men, which being once lost,
could not be so easily renewed; that the Swedes had the Forces of the Ringrave,
of Wirtenberg, others at the Siege of Filisburg, and many Garrisons, from
whence they might draw out Soldiers, and adding thereunto the rest who were
scattered abroad in Alsatia, they might though beaten recruit themselves, and
oppose the Spanish Army which though Victorious, would be by that Victory
weakened; that it behoved them not to hazard those Forces wherein the honor and
reputation of Spain consisted, and to the maintaining, and good condition
whereof all their endeavors tended; that it was better for them to compass
their ends by wiles and stratagems, then by relying only upon their strength
hazard the not being of it.

The Duke of Feria who was a Gentleman of quick foresight, and very wise in
his resolutions, examining precisely the present conjunctures, and reflecting
likewise upon the public good, as also upon the reputation of himself and
his Commanders, that he might not seem fearful in refusing to fight,
resolved he would not be thereunto averse: on such terms notwithstanding as
he might make use of the advantage he had over the Enemy in Foot; nor yet that
he would be less diligent in venting and practicing Military stratagems. He
showed great courage and much desire to fight, he came to Vberlinghem, appeared
in Battle array, made his Horse advance even to before the Swedish quarters,
made diverse skirmishes with his Horse, and showed that he was come into Germany
to deal blows.

This resolution being perceived by Waymer, and the Swedish Commanders, who
were still desirous to end the Quarrel in the Field, they called a Council,
to resolve whither they were to fight, or contenting themselves with their
advantageous station, to endeavor the Enemies prejudice, rather by
streightning them in their Provisions then by joining Battle with them, in
the event whereof the whole affair consisted; There wanted not some who were
of opinion that it was wisely, and maturely to be considered, whether they
ought to fight or no, or to hazard the danger of a Battle; that resolutions
which were only Counseled by hardiness, and the extraordinary ardour of too
forward spirits, ran often hazard of danger; that it was to be considered
upon what disadvantage they play, who hazard the whole against a part; that the
Crown of Swethland could not receive a greater blow, then by the loss of
those Forces which were known to be her vital pulse, the maintainer of her
greatness and assistance: that on the contrary side, the Spanish Army was an
addition to Caesar's strength rather intended against the jealousies of France,
then to suppress the Swedes; and peradventure the maintaining of them would be
less prejudicial to them, then their overthow; that the Dutch lost little by
losing of them, nay, their loss might be argued to be an addition to the
others strength; that Walesteine was not ignorant of the injury he suffered by
their arivall, whereby his authority was lessened; that it was well known he
was overruled by ambition, and netled by the Spaniards pretension,
wherewithal he being more vexed then by the Swedes Sword, they might hope well
in the feigned correspondency of those two Chiefetaines, and in their intestine
hatred, which would prove as pernicious to them as advantageous to the Swedes
their Enemies; that it was to be believed by how much better the Spaniards
success should be, by so much less would Walestein their rival oppose
himself to the Saxons; that it had formerly been known, what mischief had
been occasioned by not giving satisfaction to Officers, and their dissonancy in
affection; that Feria was not only well armed, but swollen with ambition to
aprove himself a worthy Commander; that his Soldiers were either fresh
Spaniards or Italians, a Nation which unacquainted with that Country, not
knowing how else to save themselves otherwise then by Victory, would be
resolute in their fighting, and the maintaining of their Ranks, since they
knew not where to escape, for that the Woods were full of barbarous
Country People, who slew as many as flew from their Colors; that it was to be
believed they would only prove constant in resolution of Victory: that the
Germans who were in the Enemies Army were old Soldiers, and lead by
experienced Commanders; that they knew how short they were of the Enemy in
Foot, by which it is that enterprises are effected, and Victories got: that
therefore their opinion was that they should defer giving Battle, and
rather endeavor to destroy the Enemy by their self sufferings, who being
entered into Alsatia, a wasted Country which wanted necessaries for the
maintenance of Armies, and being moreover on all sides environed by Swedes, it
was easily to be foreseen, that they must either think upon returning, or else
destroy their men, which were not accustomed to labor, and hunger, nor to the
climate of Germany, which in Winter was excessive cold, so as their vigorous
Foot being extenuated, they might the more easily be overcome. These
efficatious Arguments and Considerations were much listened unto by Horn, and
the Major part of the other Commanders; but Waymer, Offchirchin, and others,
who above measure coveted to give them Battle, not able to see that Army
which not long before boasted it self to be invincible, and able to make its
way through the strongest oppositions which the Austrians could make, give
back for the only neighborhood of a Nation which they held in no esteem,
answered, that it was not unknown how available the reputation of Arms was to
a Prince, by which greater Victories are oft-times achieved then by Force
alone; that this was of very great consideration, to whosoever has the Command
and Government of an Army; that hereby Enemies were possessed with fear, ones
own men heartned, and dominion was preserved; that on the contrary side,
scorn, and undervaluation, was the beginning and product of ruin; that reason
granted, Walesteine who envied Feria's greatness, might for this forfeit his
loyalty, but that it could not be denied, that the Spaniards praise, whereby
their Soldiers were encouraged, was likely much to diminish the opinion of the
Swedes, not only amongst their own men but over all the world; that it was
evidently known, if Feria prospered in his endeavors, Walesteine could not so
justly blame the Caesarian Counsels, but rather by commending them, be obliged
as his rival to out-doe him by some new enterprise; that the Spanish Authority
in Germany grew greater; that subjects did more patiently endure Imperial
impositions, that the preservation of these guests would not so openly be
refused; and every one being emboldned with hopes, and having their hearts
raised, the people of Germany would thereby be occasioned to contemn the
Swedes, and to set a greater estimation upon the Austrians; that the business
of Brisach was curiously looked upon by all the world, it being of so apparent
importance, that they were now at their last gasp, and ready to yield; that
they should not abandon that fortune, which hitherto had been favorable, and
propitious unto them, till they should see themselves by her abandoned; that
the Victory of this Battle brought with it the winning of all Alsatia, the
securing of Wirtenberg, the preservation of the Towns in Swabenland; that it
was the ruin of the Spanish honor, and (which yet imported more) it was the
eternizing the good opinion of the Swedish Armies, and the evident suppression
of Bavaria: For Walesteine who would be glad to see the bad success of the
Emperors Councels, which were resolved on without his advice, and were set on
Foot by Bavaria, blaming the unadvisednesse of the Officers, and rejoicing at
the ill event thereof, would by drawing them upon his back, be rather like to
foment their ruin, then to repair it; so as Alsatia would be secured, and the
French-mens threats, when they should see the Swedes power grow overgreat,
would hereby be provided for, for they would find hard passing the Rhyn, when
it should be secured on these parts; that they might safely hope to march with
their Forces into Austria, and compass their ambition aspired unto of crying
up Emperor whom they pleased; that therefore they ought to fight, and rather
hazard themselves upon so great an enterprise, then with loss to shun a
danger, and thereby pull upon them another more irrepairable; that if their
Army were weak in Foot, it was the stronger in Horse; that indeed Alsatia was
much impoverished of all such necessaries as were requisite for the abode of an
Army; but that it was near Helvetia, the Inhabitants whereof would make use of
this advantageous occasion, and willingly to vent their commodities, supply the
Spaniards for their pay. These conceits of Waymer though they were
acknowledged by all to be too adventurous, yet were they taken into
consideration, and the emergent occasion being maturely weighed, the result of
the Council was, that they would embrace both propositions; that is, to
incommodate Feria by cutting off his Victuals, and temporising, and yet to
fight couragigiously, when they would do it in such a position of place as
might be advantageous for their Horse. They therefore ordered their Battaglions
and planted their Cannon in most convenient places, and with part of their
Horse made toward the Austrians, believing firmly to come to a Battle with
them; but they being favored in their situation by a little Hill which they
lay under, and by a contiguous Wood, would not be drawn from thence though
provoked thereunto by diverse skirmishes, but sent secretly their Vanguard
toward Mulen, with intention to win the passage at Dutling, and to enter on
that side into the Dukedom of Wirtenberg; wherein if they had prospered, as
they wisely endeavored it, it was that which would have fully satisfied them.
Horn foreseeing the disorders that might hereupon ensue, faced presently
about that way, and went straight toward Engen, where he stayed that night; and
hearing the next day, which was on the sixth of October, October. 6.
that the Duke of Feria continued his march, he passed over his Army at
Dutling, a Town belonging to the jurisdiction of Wirtenberg, watered on the
North-side by the Danube, which runs there very slowly. The Swedish
Commanders understanding here, that the Austrians were advanced to the top of
the Hill, they had put themselves in Battell-Array in a plain between two
neighboring Woods: Horn thinking now for certain that Feria was resolved to
fight, he hasted with his Horse to the top of the Hill which is above Dutling
on Engens side; and whilst he gave orders to the Foot, he sent Monsieur
Ville-Franch's Regiment of Horse to fall upon the Enemy, and by skirmishing
with them, to towle them out into the plain; but this took not effect, for
the Spaniards keeping themselves in their advantageous position, entrench't
there; and being short of the Swedes in Horse, they would not draw out into the
Field, but make use of such places as were convenient for their Foot. But the
Swedes were told by their informers, that the Imperialists had refused to give
them Battle the day before, only by reason of Aldringer, who had received
order from Walesteine not to fight, nor to hazard his men; which in case he
should loose, he should likewise lose his employment; and for that, Walesteine
not well pleased with Ferias coming, desired his reputation might be blur'd by
some unluckie encounter; believing notwithstanding that Feria would agree in
opinion with Aldringer, as well grounded upon reason, that he should fight
before his Freshmen should be wearied with their duties in the Field, where
hunger was their greatest Enemy: The Swedes kept their men all that night long
in Battell-Array; and the Generals, though they had convenience to rest
themselves in their Coaches, did notwithstanding dismiss them, saying; It was
not fitting they alone should enjoy their ease, where so many friends and
fellow Soldiers suffered hardness; they therefore were content to lie that
night, (which was very cold and snowy) upon the naked earth, near the rest of
the Soldiers: An example which ought to be followed by such Commanders as
desire to win the Soldiers love; for there is no greater cause of murmuring
then inequality, and to enjoy a man's own ease, whilst his Companions are in
misery. If King Gustavus did Acts of wonder with a few men, this was one of the
chiefest causes thereof, for he thereby gave others reason to imitate and
follow his example.

The Swedes the next morning perceiving the Spaniards did not advance (as they
expected they should do) and that they could not draw them into the open
Field; and Horn being moreover advertised that they began to march toward
Sigmering, a place which though it were upon the Danube, lies yet more lower
toward Bavaria: And fearing least Feria and Aldringer, who were wise
Commanders, and of a refined understanding, should win the hand of them, and
get into Wirtenberg by Balings side, which was but two Leagues off, where the
Imperialists yet kept the strong Castle of Solerme, situated upon a craggy
Mountain, and which was then besieged by the Wirtenbergers; and that they
might pass from thence to Filisberg to relieve that Fort, and so getting over
the Rhyn, recruit Haghenaw, run over the Palatinate, join themselves with
the remainder of the Lorayne Forces, and with those that were raised in
Burgundy, and advance prosperously on the other side the River to Brisach; they
went from Dutling, and took the same way, and lodged that very night in
Drussing; where the news being, that Feria was upon his march; and it was
moreover confirmed, that he had thrown a Bridge over the Danube at Shamering,
Horn sent 500 Horse under the Conduct of the Lieutenant Colonel of the
Finlanders, who was well practiced in such like affairs, to discover the
Enemies Design, and to take some prisoners, by whom he might learn what
condition their Army was in. This man went boldly on; and as he thought to
surprise a quarter, wherein were 1000 of the Enemies Horse, he found them ready
to entertain him, as having had notice of his intention; he was unexpectedly
set upon by them, and himself, with many of his men, taken prisoners. The
news still continuing, that the Caesarians were upon their march, the Swedish
Commanders advanced to Baling, to hinder their entrance on that side into the
aforesaid Dukedom, and there they stayed: But being again informed that the
Duke of Feria was parted from Aldringer, and that he marched with only 12000
toward Brisach, and that Aldringer being sent for back by Walesteine,
returned with the rest into Bavaria; Horn gave order to follow them, and
therefore Weymar marched with his Forces toward Ebing; Horn and Berchenfield
toward Newstat, that they might meet together before Brisach to reinforce
that Camp, and preventing the Spaniards, force them to depart from thence; but
as soon as they had begun this their march, there came certain news, that
the speech of their parting was not true, but that it was a stratagem of
theirs, by leaving their Baggage intrench't in Miskerck, and that they were in
have gone toward the Rhyn, and were already at Egen. The Swedish Generals
advising what was hereupon to be done, they resolved to follow them, and to
leave their Baggage at Rutuile, (a privileged City upon the Frontiers of
Wirtenberg, and which was with good correspondency with the Switzers) that they
might make the more speedy march, and overtake them. Weymar therefore returned
back, and together with Horn, and Berchenfield returned to Shemburg, and
marching all that night they were the next morning at Drussing. Whilst the
Soldiers very weary with their long marches rested themselves in this Village,
Horn was advertised by Letters from Scafhause, that the Imperialists were past
by the Towns of that Canton, of which they had burnt two; whereat the
Protestant Switzers being much enraged, had taken up Arms; that many thousands
of them were gathered together, intending to proceed in hostile manner with
those they should find had provoked them thereunto; that therefore wanting
Horses to back them in the Field, while they should revenge this Outrage done
unto them, they desired his assistance therein. This advice did much amuse
Weymar and Horn, though they gave not much credit to the Letters, knowing that
the Switzers (who were divided in their opinions) do not so easily put on such
resolutions of declaring themselves Enemies to a great Prince. They resolved
notwithstanding (that they might let their friends know they never abandoned
good neighbors) to send Berchenfield with part of the Army to Newstat; that
Horn should keep about Rotevile, and that Weymar with 40 Companies of Horse
should go to know what those of Scafhause wanted.

When Horn was come to Rotevile, Weymar came hastily to him from his quarters,
and brought with him certain Letters from Oxesterne, which were directed to
Horn; which when they were opened, and a secret Commission found therein, they
soon changed their former orders; for Weymar leaving his intention of going to
Scafhause, took the way of Franconia, that he might again come into Bavaria,
to the enterprise of Ratisbone, to the which he was invited by secret
advertisements given him by the Elector of Saxony, and other Protestant
friends; that it was now time to think upon some action that was unexpected by
the Caesarians; for Walesteine, who was distasted, seemed very desirous that
somewhat of misfortune might befall the Spanish Army, and the Duke of Bavaria;
as he, who had been the cause that the Spaniards had passed over the
Mountains with a power independent, and that Aldringer too joined with them;
and that it was verily conceived, that if the Swedes would endeavor the ruin
of Bavaria, he would not budge one foot to succor them: and just so it proved,
as shall be said hereafter. Berchenfield was left with the residue of the Army
to go to Offemberg, to watch the Spaniards proceedings beyond Brisack; and
Marshall Horn took his way with 2000 Horse toward Eneding, from whence he
sent away a Trumpet to acquaint the Magistrates of Scafhause with his coming,
and so went himself to Bergher, a little Village belonging to that Canton,
where he found the Deputies of the said City, fuller of Wine then resolution;
for the preparations which were said to be made by the Protestant Switzers,
were found not be such as was given out, there being only 1000 Foot sent by
the Canton of Zurich, under the command of Colonel Vldrich, for the defense of
that City, and to no other purpose; neither did they conclude any thing, but
stood with their Glasses in their hands till two hours within night; at which
time, Horn being informed by a Lieutenant of Crabats (who was taken prisoner
as he lighted upon the Swedish Centinells, which he took to be Caesarians)
that there was not far from thence 500 Carriages of Ammunition for the
Austrian Army, with some Crabats for their Convoy, he presently got on
horseback, and pursued them though in vain; for they being advertised by some
of the Lieutenants Companions, got (by the favor of the night, which was very
dark) to Mulen. This happened after he had taken his leave of the said Deputies,
having been very instant with them to use their authority with the Canton of
Basel, that they should not assist the Spaniards, neither with Victuals, nor
Ammunition, as he feared they would.

At the same time that Oxensternes Commissions came to Horn and Waymer, there
were other Commissions sent to those who were before Brisach, which commanded
the Ringrave to raise his Forces from the Siege of Colmar, and to join with
Colonel Ransaw, and the Soldiers that were quartered in Alsatia, to the end
all of them together making up the Body of an Army, and strengthened by the
Garrisons of that Province, they might have an eye to the Duke of Feria's
designs. Berchenfeilt for the better strengthening of the Ringrave, and to
secure the Towns in Alsatia, went over the Bridge at Strasbourg, and marched
likewise toward Colmar. But for that if the Spaniards should come to Brisach,
they might easily by the advantage of the River pass and repasse over the
Bridge, and Horn fearing lest they might by that way endeavor to enter into
Wirtenberg, (a Country wherein they might that year have easily wintered) he
encamped himself about Horneberg upon the Frontiers of that State, a place not
only able to receive him, but very fitting to molest the Romanists Army
whenever they should pass back again into Bavaria, (as 'twas thought they
would suddenly do, as well to hinder Waymers proceedings, as also that so many
people could not subsist in those parts, which were totally consumed, and for
that the most part garrisonized by the Swedes)

The Spaniards this mean while advanced to Waldshut, not meeting with any
obstacle; and making themselves masters thereof, as also of Sichemghem, and
Leuffemburg, (all which yielded upon Articles) they at last set upon Rinfelden,
the Garrison whereof defending themselves with constancy, and obstinacy, hoping
to be quickly succord, and not able to resist a gallant Assault which the
Spaniards made, they were all put to the Sword. From hence they pass to Basel,
the Citizens whereof, (were it either out of fear, or for their own
interests) received Feria courteously, who notwithstanding would not enter into
the City, but they made much of Co^missary Ossa, of Count John Serbolone, and
Col. Ieri, who entering thereinto had what they could desire for their money. The
Siege was likewise raised from before Veling, by the Wirtenbergers, and the
Militia in Roteville was committed to the charge of Colonel Agafield, to
prevent the insurrection of the Romanists thereabouts, which they might
endeavor being imboldned by the coming of that Army.

All the thoughts and designs of the other Imperialists aimed at the Saxon
Army, they bent all their wits how to weaken it, of which they were so jealous.
The greatest preparations for war which in so short a time and in the present
conjuncture could be, was made in Bavaria to save themselves from their Enemies
threatening Forces, which lay toward Ratisbone, and in Alsatia; the Councels of
the one side, and of the other were employed in measuring their own strength,
and the like of their companions, and in plotting how they might get the
Victory; upon the which by reason of the consequencies which depended
thereupon, all the Eyes of Christendom were fixed. When Walesteine still more
and more desirous to conclude a peace with the Elector of Saxony, the which he
would have been the gladder of, for that without it he could not easily
compass that which he desired to do, to the new Spanish Army, made new
proffers, and conditions, drawn out of the necessity whereinto he was brought,
and whereby he went less in honor, for they were so large as that his
reputation was thereby prejudiced; but not being such as gave satisfaction, to
the pretenses of that Prince, (near whom were some Counselors that were
partial to the Crown of Swethland, and very ill affected to the Romanists,)
nor the Swedish Arms being as yet so great as that they needed a moderator,
nor yet so much declined as that they ought to shelter themselves from the
Emperors indignation; nor yet the Emperor being willing to grant him what he
then demanded in honor of those Forces which were by him fomented; he went so
warily to work, as neither to incense the Swedes, nor yet exasperate the
Emperor: but proceeding with each of them so as he conceived made most for his
own advantage, and the suspension of Arms for other three weeks being now
out, he took in diverse places in Misnia, and set down before Leypzig.

Walesteine perceiving that the Saxons removed their Forces from Slesia, a
noble Province, he followed them and cut many of them in pieces; and seeing it
was not now time to set in order other men's affairs, whilst his own were in
hazard, he withdrew himself along the Elb to Laitmeritz; from whence Gallasse
being gone with 10000 Soldiers toward Dresden, he advanced once more to
Braig, the which he took, as likewise many other places formerly held by the
Saxons; not for that his mind was bent upon such acchivements, for they were
of no great importance, but that he might appear to be employed in these
parts, and to shun occasion of going to the succor of Bavaria; as likewise by
fear of Arms to invite the Elector to sense himself by Peace against the
molestations of War. From thence being gotten nearer Glogaw, and
understanding that Harnem was marching thitherward to succor it, and disturb
his design; and that the Count De Towrs, was then in the Swedish Camp in Arms
with the title of Commissary general, and that he and Colonel Tuball were
with 5000 men about Victenaw, (where he was informed that the said Count was a
man rather fit for politic employments then mannaging of Arms, for though he
understood Military affairs, yet was he of so easy a disposition, as wanting
vivacity of spirit and ready resolution (parts requisite in a perfect
Commander) his adversaries might easily by their cunning work upon the
sweetness of his mind) He applied himself to this enterprise, thinking to
set upon them unexpectedly, and to work some impression in them: having
therefore through his wonted cunning (whereby he miraculously governed all his
actions, when fortune favored him) given secret order to his Commanders that
they should make as if they went toward Harnem, altering his course on the
sudden, he on the 11th of October. fell so unexpectedly upon the Saxon
quarters, that he was upon their backs before they could retreat in safety,
either to Vratislavia, Krossen, or Glogaw, (all of them neighboring places) or
yet receive succor from Harnem, for not thinking that Walesteins design had
so long a reach, he was at this time so far from them, as that he could not
come unto them time enough; so as these Commanders finding that they could not
put themselves upon the fortune of Arms, but upon great disadvantage, being
far short in number to the Imperialists, who were 20 Regiments of Foot and 13
of Horse, and being out of all hopes of Victuals or succor, which being far
off could not come time enough to serve their stead; that they might not perish
miserably through hunger, nor run headlong upon the desperateness of
Battle, and so remain victimes to the Caesarian Sword, knowing that
voluntary Surrenders were always borne withal, when safety is by no other
means to be had, the Count and Tuball, together with the rest of the chiefest
Captains, withdrew themselves aside, and being comforted by proffers which
Tersica made unto them from Walesteine, who promised that if they would yield
up unto him those places which they had in their possession, he would not only
spare their lives, but treat them as friends and companions; necessity being
that which prevails with the most obstinate, they agreed to accept his offer,
not seeing how otherwise they could possibly escape; they therefore resolved to
submit themselves to Walesteines clemency, who soon after set the Count De
Tower at liberty, and suffered Tuball likewise to make an escape; wherewithal
the Court at Vienna was not well pleased, which would feign have had the Count
in their own custody, that as head of the Bohemian Commotions he might have
received just punishment for his defaults; as likewise they would gladly have
had the contrary party been deprived of Tuball, who was so gallant a Commander,
as that his worth could not but be prejudicial to them. But Walesteine who was
always of an uncorrupted faith, and who desired to witness to the Elector of
Saxony, that his invitations to peace were indissolvable ties of Loyalty; and
who desired by his courtesy and civil usage to oblige even his Enemies,
regulating his government by dealing gently with his adversaries, to the end
and that thereby working upon their affections he might rather appease their
anger, then provoke them to an obstinate defense; found rather that by his thus
doing to purchase the ill will of the Emperors Court, then falsify his word,
of which he was very faithful: and he was so generous in his demonstrations,
as if he thought to purchase the good will of the Electors Counselors and
Officers; it being natural to all men who are not ungrateful, and therein
worse then Beasts, to be well inclined to their Benefactors.

Walestein being imboldned by this so happy Victory, advanced to Frankfort upon
the Oder, and from thence to Landsperg, both which yielded suddenly unto him;
for the Governors of them having order from the Elector to abandon them, if
the Imperialists should appear before their Gates, they obeyed him* and
according to his commands withdrew themselves to Kostrin. Walesteine being
persuaded by these prosperous successes, and thinking that these his
proceedings were the true means to moderate the Duke of Saxonies pretensions,
resolved to try him once more, and to that end sent unto him Prince Albertus
Frauciscus of Sassen-Lavemberg; but his demands meeting with like success as
before, he marched with his whole Army to before Gorlitz, environed with strong
Rampires, and very opportunely seated on the West upon the banks of Neisse, on
the Confines of Lusatia; the Governor whereof not sailing in his duty, though
for the defense thereof he had but 800 Foot and 150 Horse, with some few of the
Inhabitants (a small number to maintain a place of so great circuit) prepared
gallantly for defense, little valuing Walesteines threats; yet not being able
to resist a strong Assault made by the Austrians, he and all his men were put
to the Sword, as often times befalls those, who warmed in the opinion of
themselves by a more then usual presumption, waste that wisdom which
tempered with audacity would make a happy mixture.

The escape of these Commanders being divulged to have happened by Walesteines
knowledge, (who desirous to captivate the Enemies good will so ordered it, that
thereby he might manifest how he was offended with the Spaniards, and Austrian
Officers) made Oxesterne perceive that Walesteine being daily more incenst
against the Spaniards, would criple those actions which might keep up the
Imperial greatness. For being above measure ambitious, and not able to suffer
that the so large Authority granted him, should now be limited, 'twas likely he
would reassume that intestine hatred, which by reason of the new
acknowledgements made unto him by Caesar, and by the simulation of the Austrian
Ministers of State seemed to be almost quite laid aside; and that some ill
vapor distilling from thence, he might give way unto the Swede to make
advantage of these their discords, by some considerable acquisition: and
chiefly he believed that some good might be done upon Bavaria, being it was he
who (more watchful then the rest, and wisely knowing what prejudice Princes
receive, who raise their subjects to too high a pitch) had ordered the means
how Walesteines vast ambition might be moderated, and who being likewise
thought to be the chief promoter of Feria's coming, it was not to be doubted
but that well contented with any mischief that might befall that Duke,
Walesteine would make but slow have to succor him: making use therefore of this
occasion, the taking of Ratisbon was thought would prove the easiest to be
effected.

Therefore Waymer having crossed over Swabenland, came to Newburg, before his
departure was taken notice of; and unexpectedly setting upon it, some
Countrey-people (who having recourse thither had taken upon them to defend it)
affrighted at the first news of the Enemies Cannon, (as people not accustomed
to Arms) they Surrendered the Town on the 29^h of November; the Bavararian
Garrison marching forth, Nov. 29.
to the number of 500 Foot and 70 Horse, were convoyed by the Swedes to
Ingolstat; from thence he speedily advanced to the Castle of Aichest, which
after having endured some Cannonshot, did likewise yield, 300 Foot marching out
with their Arms and Baggage.

He then came to Ratisbon, planted his Cannon against it, and the Garrison,
after 18 days resistance made, dispairing of succor, and being unprovided of
necessaries, (for they at this time dreaded not any such accident, which was
thought to be unpossible, unless by means of some correspondency) the Town
was yielded up on the 14th of December, and thus the Swedes got a great City
upon the Danube which runs through the Town, December. 14.
and has a great Stone Bridge built over it, and which Town was formerly wont
to boast it self of Franchisement, and to enjoy the like privileges as do
the other Hauns Towns in Germany, but is of late much decayed; it was
environed with double Walls, well cimented, though old; fortified with
half-Moones, earthen Tenailes before the Gates after the Modern fashion, with
a dry Ditch, but full of short returns, which flanck't upon one another within
Musket shot, after the Modern invention.

The loss of Ratisbon, being much lamented in the Emperors Court, and by the
Duke of Bavaria, by reason of the importancy of the situation (for thereby the
passage being opened on both sides of the Danube, into the bowels of Bavaria,
the Towns thereof would through continual suspision (...) kept in perpetual
motion) caused many good Austrians to be very jealous of all Walesteines
actions, who picking matter of murmur out of every little occasion, and laying
whatsoever happened amiss to his charge, failed not by degrees to bring him to
that height of suspicion which afterward was his overthrow. 'Twas muttered,
that he might easily have succored Ratisbon, Weymar not having with him above
9000 men; but Walesteine had not digested the injury he conceived was done him
by the Duke of Bavaria, blaming him as the chief author of his being cashiered
at the Diet of Ratisbon; yet was it not this which did indeed cause such
carelessness in Walesteine, but to see the Spanish Colors fly in Germany,
which occasioned variety of thoughts in him; as likewise the coming of the
Count D'Ogniate to Vienna; who being a faithful Minister of State, and not
able to see a servant should have no regard to the Supreme Authority of his
Master, plotted what he could to bridle that boundless liberty which he had
assumed unto himself, and which afterward was his misleading.

The Duke of Feria being advanced to Brisach, and thinking the most difficult
things now feacible by reason of his late good success, thought he might
easily take Colmar, a chief City in Alsatia, two Leagues distant from
Brisach, on the other side the Rhyn, in that Champion which extends it self
between that and the Mountains toward Lorayne, which had formerly been a
free Town, but by the vicissitude of Occurences fallen into the Austrian
subjection, begirt with good Ditches, Walls, and Rampires, though imperfect; in
the which, the Swedes having placed a rich Magazin of Victuals and Ammunition,
for the supply of their Armies which lay in those parts, he hoped, by the
taking thereof, not only to Victual Brisach, but to refresh his own Army,
wherewithal he determined to keep in those parts for some time, to maintain
those Towns which yet kept free to the Emperor, as likewise to endeavor the
taking of many others which were under the Swedes power, and to get into with
Loraine, the loss whereof was a great vexation to the Austrians; for they
being deprived of that Princes assistance, whereby they shut up the passage of
Burgondy into Flanders, Alsatia, and the Lower Palatinate, were thereby much
prejudiced, and France much advantaged; the neighborhood and power whereof,
as being their just counter-poise, they much apprehended; for Spain met with
no other considerable opposition, but the French, who in time might much offend
them. He planted four Batteries against it, which played merrily upon it six
days; but finding the sufficiency of the Rampires, and the defendants valor,
who were provided with all things necessary, he thought it not good to waste
his men, and necessary Victual which he had brought to relieve Brisach, in the
winning of a Town, the taking whereof would require time, be costly, and
uncertain. He therefore resolved to send Aldringer into Bavaria, being desired
so to do by the Emperor and the Duke thereof, who much feared Waymers
advancement, for he was drawing up into the heart of the State. Aldringer did
accordingly; he re-passed over the Rhyn, and set upon Freiburg, which was held
by the Swedes, and which soon yielded unto him, and the Garrison thereof took
pay of him; which Town, though it were of small moment, being only environed
with bare Walls without Rampires, yet being that he and his men were to pass
by it, it behoved him to secure it.

Horn, who had an eye to the Caesarian proceedings, understanding this his
march, came out against him; which when Aldringer understood, knowing that his
Voyage would be very difficult (for he was to pass through a Country, the
Provisions whereof were totally wasted, and which was full of Soldiers, and
desperate Country people, and the passages prevented by the Enemy) he speedily
raised his quarters from Loffing a little Town in Swabenland, in the black
Wood, where whilst he was, he had lost about 400 of his men, part slain, part
taken prisoners in diverse skirmishes made by Horns Soldiers, and so he
returned back again to Brisach.

Waymer having got Ratisbone, and constituted good orders therein, as well for
the public as Military government, having left there 2000 Foot and 500 Horse
in Garrison, and made the Citizens swear fealty; seeing how it made for him
to get Chamb, a place in the upper Palatinate, by the River Rugen, he took his
way thitherward to further his proceedings in the Palatinate, as likewise to
facilitate his taking of Passaw, a City standing upon the Island made by the
Danube, where that River joins with Inn, begirt with Walls without Rampires,
but likely by reason of the situation to hold out for some time, and commanded
by a Castle upon the top of a Hill. The Episcopacy thereof is such, as though
the Bishop were not the Brother to the Emperor Ferdinand the third, he might
be termed a Prince of no vulgar esteem; it is seated between Bavaria,
Austria, and the upper Palatinate, and in a passage of great Navigation upon
the Danube. He marched with his Army thitherward, and met not with any
opposition; for the Garrison frighted with what had befallen Ratisbone, and
other places of greater strength then it; and fearing lest the like might
befall them, thought it better for them to yield, then by vainly standing out
to incur inevitable undoing (though by reason of its good Walls it might
have held out a while) whereupon they surrendered it to the Swedes. 'Twas
reported, that this was done by secret intelligence held with Walesteine, who
desirous to see the Bavarians ill treated, would publicly say to those that
told him of Weymars proceedings in Bavaria, that Feria was there to succor it.
The like did the Garrisons of Strawbing and Dechendorf.

Aldringer being returned from Laffinghen toward Friburg, and the Duke of
Feria seeing his men daily diminish (who being brought from Italy, were not
accustomed to the German Fogs) and being thereunto persuaded by Aldr^nger, and
the other Commanders, since their hopes of entering into Wirtenberg was already
lost, nor that they could not without some hazardous encounter pass into
Flanders, by reason of the opinions which have been spoken of, they jointly
resolved to Winter in Bavaria, and there to recruit their Army which was not a
little lessened. They therefore raised their Army from Friburg, and marched
toward Biberach, wherein they were so much incommodated (for the Autumn
began to grow very perverse) as that to boot, with the loss of many
Soldiers in diverse skirmishes with the Swedes, who still waited upon them on
the Frontiers of Wirtenberg, fearing lest they might enter thereinto, and do
what they had formerly purposed; they left some thousands perish't by cold,
Famine and flight. The two Armies of Austria and Swethland marched, the one on
this side, the other on that side the Danube, not without some blows,
sometimes to the advantage, sometimes to the loss of either of them; when
Colonel Calambac, Governor of Colmar, resolving to take the Castle of Zulech,
(seated upon a Hill some six Leagues from Colmar toward Lorayne) addressed
himself thitherward with four Companies of Foot and two of Horse, and
prospered in his design. For feigning to be of the Emperors side, and framing
certain Letters under fal^e Characters, signed with Schamburgs seal, (who as
then commanded in chief in Brisach) he sent them to the Governor, who
thinking them to be true, let him into the Castle, where he took the Governor
Prisoner, brought him to his quarter, with about 160 Soldiers which were with
him, who all entered themselves under his Banners. But the keeping of this
place of so small weight, not standing with his good; and fearing the Marquess
of Bauden, who marched after him, he instantly quitted it, carrying from thence
all that was good, which some (who had retired themselves thither, not dreading
the Protestants) had brought into it, an accident which did not a little
perturbe the Austrians; for discovering the fear, or were it the incapacitie
of government of their Officers, they doubted, lest they might run the like
prejudice in other places more subject to jealousy.

Waymer having taking Strawbing and Dechendorf, was incurraged to greater
enterprises, particularly to the taking of Passaw; and he was the more heartned
herein, for that at the same time some Boores of Austria, stirred up by these
proceedings, and by the Swedes neighborhood, forbear not again to unsheath
together with their Swords their treacherous minds. He therefore took his
march thitherward with 6000 Foot and 2000 Horse picked out of the gross of the
Army, which by the access of diverse Troops from sundry parts, was grown to
consist of 15000 fighting men; but the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria, well
knowing how much the taking of that City would import them, as that which
commanding the Danube and Inn, was the proper passage to let in the Enemy into
Caesar patrimoniall estate, into Austria, into Bavaria, and Bohemia, which
wanted strong holds on that other side to defend them, and would doubtlessely
have caused strange fear in all the people of those Provinces, did with all
diligence endeavor to prevent this blow, and so withstand the Swedes herein.
John D'Wert was therefore ordered to come from his quarters in Bavaria, with
four Regiments of Foot to defend it: As likewise on the other side the Danube,
other 2000 Foot and 700 of the Imperialists Horse came to the defense thereof,
which were formerly quartered in the Confines of Bohemia toward the
Palatinate; Walesteine was likewise commanded to march instantly that ways
with all his Army, and received diverse orders to that purpose, that he might
look to the further proceedings of the Enemy, to allay the Rebellion of the
Austrians, and to the recovery of Ratisbon, which was not out of hopes of being
regained, for that the Swedes had not yet had time to fortify it as it ought
to be, nor to furnish it sufficiently with Victuals and Ammunition, which they
took no great care for, for they rather turned all to their peculiar service
then to the public good, not thinking after their Kings death that they had
any other interest then in their own particulars, as not knowing what would be
the issue of their labors, nor who should be Master of what they should get.

Thus are affairs handled where commands are confusedly given, and where there
is not a Supreme head, of whom men ought to stand in fear, and from whom to
hope for good.

Walesteine at the news hereof, though he desired nothing but ruin to the
Spaniards and Bavarians, that he might bring them to be in need of him, and to
trust all their affairs to his guidance, (as is usual to the ambition of
such, who being raised from a low to a high fortune, are so dazzled with the
splendour thereof, as that though they want not the spectacles of wisdom, yet
they know not how near so great an ascent is to a precipite; and that the
higher the glory be exalted the downfall is the deeper;) yet deeming it to be
too rash an action not to obey his Master, and so prove himself hateful and
ungrateful, after he had commanded Gallasse to stay in Saxony with 10000
Soldiers, to watch over the Electors proceedings, he himself, with the rest
of his Army marched toward Ratisbon, but made so slow haste, as his intention
of succouring Bavaria might be discerned to be very infirm; the which was the
more confirmed, when he was no sooner come into the Palatinate, but that
palliating himself with pretense, that the Saxons being advanced to the
Frontiers of Bohemia, it more behoved the Emperor to maintain that Kingdom,
then to lose it by succouring others, he faced about, and returned to his
former station.

The Duke of Bavaria being advertised that Walesteine was upon his march
toward him, guthered together all the Militia that he could get in that
Country, and from the Garrisons thereabouts, and adv^ncing toward Danube,
Charged some of the Swedish Troops, and having slain about 200 of the Enemy,
did with much boldness, and to the great terror of the adversary, come near
to Ratisbon, and was ready to Assault it on that side, whenever Walesteine
should set upon it on the other, that so he might divert Waymer's Army from the
impression it might make in the Romanists; but when he heard that Walesteine
was retreated to Bohemia, without having given him any the least notice
thereof, he (that he might not further engage himself with his Forces)
returned likewise to his quarters; and being much incenst against Walesteine,
he suddenly dispatched away his Chancellor to Vienna, to awaken his Caesarian
Majesty, and make him have an eye to the actions of his General, which did not
correspond with the duty of a faithful servant, and that he might take some
order for his assistance; if otherwise, that when necessity should enforce him,
he must think upon some other course for his own good. He complained hereof
likewise to the King of Spaines Ministers of State Resident then at Vienna, and
in Ispruch, inviting them to mediate with Caesar that some resolution might be
taken to assist him, and that it might be taken into consideration how much the
Emperor and all the Catholic League might suffer by the sinister proceedings
of their General, that it was not unknown to his Majesty how firmly he had
adheared unto the League, whilst others like so many lightnings ran to the
destruction of the Empire: what great and profuse expenses he had been at, in
maintaining of the Armies; what propositions made unto him by the French, he
had refused; and how he had hazarded his estate, and ventured his own life,
for the most glorious house of Austria.

These conceptions being with efficacy urged by those employed by his
Excellency of Bavaria, met not with any thing that withstood their making an
impression in the hearts of those to whom they were imparted; and for that the
Interest of Princes is as apt to take ^ire as Tinder, shadows serving them for
substances, many Counselors began to be distasted with Walesteines actions,
who formerly had viewed and looked upon them, through such spectacles as do
falsi^y the object, which now throwing aside they found what would be the
sequel of his being thus proceeded withal; for politicians look still to be
offended by him whom once they have offended, and that they cannot preserve
themselves from revenge, but by reiterating their offense. The Spaniards as
those who are thought to be of a more refined judgment then others, and who
do always, with wary advice bring about the ends, took council how to
loosen the freedom of their Princes from bondage, to tie his hands who plotted
their prejudice, and how to keep the Crown of Bohemia upon their heads; and
seeing that the evil was sufficiently cankered, and inveterate, for that
Walesteine had got to be so reputed of his Soldiers, and had wone so much upon
their affection and observancy, as that they were not likely easily to forsake
him, whom they knew to be prodigal of his rewards to them; and for that the
greatest part of the Commanders had been by him preferred to their places of
Command, and were consequently his well wishers, and would in all likelihood
run the same fortune with him; as likewise for that 'twas generally thought
that he had accumulated much riches; (all which presented themselves as objects
of ruin to the eyes of those Counselors) they therefore saw it was expedient
to bring violent remedies to this indisposition, and began with all diligence
to have an eye to his apparent infidelity.

But if the Condition of Germany were thus, and these the proceedings of the
Protestants, and the Romanists, each endeavoring to overthow the other; and if
nothing but Arms were talked of in every place, and threatenings everywhere
proclaimed; the like affairs began to bud up in Italy. For Duke Crequi, being
then Ambassador extraordinary for the King of France, at Rome, where he had
been ever since the preceding June, staid there to draw the Pope to lean
favorably to the King his Master, and to make other agreements with the
Princes of Italy. And the Polach Ambassador extraordinary came likewise to
Rome at this time, sent thither by his King, the pomp and magnificence of both
which have been sufficiently set forth by able pens. The Spaniards were much
moved to see (as they would publicly say) that pleasures, and delights,
should make the consideration of what misery the world was in, laid aside: that
many studied nothing but pomp and vanity, striving how they might exceed in
apparel, diet, and other magnificencies; and they, as professing more zeal
to Religion, and as nearer neighbors to the Churches patrimony, pretending to
be of greater Authority with the Pope then any other potentates, were not a
little troubled, and grieved, that they should be so forward in spending their
gold, and blood, in aid of Religion which was suppressed, whilst the
Ecclesiastickes only intending their own quiet, did not only not trouble
themselves with thinking how to assist the Emperor, but were not any ways
careful of those imminent evils, which were threatened to Christendom by the
proceedings of the Protestants; they therefore resolved to try the Pope, and to
endeavor not only to interest him on their behalfes in the present war, but
likewise to make him give the King of France an admonishment, for his assisting
the Protestants against them. They therefore chose the Bishop of Cordova, and
Signior John de Chiamadser, men of acute wisdom, and profoundly politic,
who being come from Spain to Rome, and joining with the Cardinals, Spinola,
Cueva, Borgia, and the Marquess of Chasteaw Roderigo, the Spanish Ambassador
in ordinary, they jointly agreed to be instant with his Holiness, that he
would assist the Emperor with moneys; and to that purpose obtained the tenth
of all the Ecclesiasticke goods in Sicile, Sardinia, Portugal, and other
parts, which was thought would amount to 500000 Crowns.

At this time dyed the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, at Brussels: wherefore
Flanders wanting a Prince of the Austrian blood to govern it, the Infant who
was yet at Milan, was solicited to come thither. This Princess left this world
in the 67th year of her Age, and 33 of her Government; she was a Lady of a
Majesticall aspect, affable, and full of Courtesy; her customs were religious,
even to admiration; her actions devoute, and her government most just. Her
loss was lamented by all Flanders, but chiefly by the Inhabitants of
Brussells; for the Marquess of Aytona having taken upon him the government,
and having by night stolen in many Spanish Soldiers ^^to the Town, the
Inhabitants took this his diffidence of them in such scorn, as hatred
supplying the place of loyalty, the Flemish devotion to the Spaniards began to
vanish apace, and some novelty was likely to have happened, had not their hopes
of receiving the Infant into the Throne which they had so much reverenced,
moderated the violence of the popular desire, and the passion which was
conceived by the Nobility.

Aldringer this mean while, leaving a Garrison in Miminghen, and Kauffburen,
retired with the Duke of Feria, toward Fussen, upon the Confines of Swabenland
toward Tiroll, upon the Leech; when Were thinking to surprise Ollins his
quarter, (a Swedish Colonel) in a Village near Straubing, called Harthawsen,
went thither by night, but finding the Swedes drawn forth of the Village into
an advantageous place, with their weapons in their hands, he set fire on the
Village, and fearing to meet with a hard encounter, for that the Alarm was
already given round about, he returned to his former station.

Whilst in Vienna and in other places, the greatest policy that in wisdom
could be found out, was practiced by faithful Ministers of State, for what
concerned Walesteines actions, Baudis (who as has been said was about Coln)
took in Bona and Ertfield, Towns belonging to that Electorat, and seated
along the Rhyn, begirt only with single Walls and Ditches after the ancient
manner, which made them not fit to resist the Cannon, and other modern
offensive inventions: where afterward by the interposition of the Holland
Ambassador, he treated with the Elector touching a Newtrality, which took
effect. And Cronisfield being advertised that Waldeck, a place from whence a
ridge of Land takes it name, which lies between the Landsgrave of Hessens
Country, the Archbishopric of Paderborne, and the Dukedom of Burgher in
Westfalia* along the Eder, named the County of Waldeck, was much oppressed by the
Swedes, marched thitherwards, for it was not fitting to permit the Protestants
to shelter themselves there.

Walesteine being returned into Bohemia, that he might honest his retreat from
the business of Ratisbon, advanced again into Saxony, and routed diverse of
the Electors Troops of Horse, making some other little inrodes in those parts,
of no great moment. But because he had no mind to do any thing to purpose,
instead of continuing his proceedings there, though there were no great
difficulty in it, his Army being strong and desirous of new imploymen^s, he
feigned an excuse, how that to keep in Saxony where there was such scarcity of
Victuals, and whereof the Enemy did for a good part hinder him, and being
obliged to be perpetually in readiness to fight in the Winter-season, wherein
it was more requisite to refresh the Army, then to consume it. It belonged not
to a wise Commander to be unmindfull of these things; and therefore upon these
reasons he returned to Bohemia, and divided his Army in that Kingdom, and in
Moravia, a Province comprehended in the said Kingdom of Bohemia, confining
upon Austria, Sletia, and Hungaria, populous, fruitful, and abounding wit^ all
things requisite for humane sustenance; making it be noysed abroad, that he
this mean while prepared to come into the field with Forces able to effect his
designs; this was notwithstanding only that his evil intention to that
Kingdom might appear, and that he might break the neck of the Imperial
Authority, against whose Ministers of State (as it is usual with those that
conceive themselves injured to be more incensed against a friend then against a
stranger) Walesteines mind and industry was more bent to ruin his counterfeit
friends, then his open enemies.

The Duke of Feria having made some abode in the parts about Fussen (knowing
how hard a matter it would be for him to keep his Army in that Country where
was great want of Victuals and Forradge, since his men were not accustomed to
the German labor and toil, where contrary to the practice of Italy and
Flanders, the Country being spacious and having but few Forts in it, the
Soldier does for the most part keep the Field, and is more accustomed to
Field-Battailes, then to besieging strong holds,) resolved to go into Bavaria,
and winter in that Country wherein was great store of Corn and Hay. He
therefore spoke thereof to the Duke, who though he desired not more Forreiners
in his Country by whom subjects usually receive nothing but loss, yet he being
a very religious Prince, and who kept still loyal to the Emperor, setting
aside all particular respects, where the common cause came in question, would
make it appear how firm his heart stood to the service of the Roman-Religion
and the house of Austria; he was moreover the sooner drawn to yield to this
request, by reason of the need he stood of help against the Swedes; and for
that the Spaniards assistance was requisite to suppress Walesteine, whose
endeavors tending only to his ruin, had brought him to a hard condition. He
therefore was contented to receive him into his dominions, which happened to
the greater satisfaction of his subjects then was imagined; for they much
apprehending the Swedish excursions, were very well pleased with this coming
of the Spaniards, who kept very good order in their treating the people; nay,
they so civilly comported themselves, as that the former fear they had of the
name Spaniard, (they being by such as dreaded them, and were envious of the
glory of that Nation, given out to be proud, insolent, and greedy of what
belonged to others,) they now found that nation as civilly behaved, and full of
courtesy, as the extent thereof is large in Command; and to be more lovingly
quiet, and more to be borne withal then any other; so as they were very well
contented with their company; and so much the more, as that moneys being
current, the Country People enjoyed that by war which oft-times they want in
peace.

Walesteines retreat from Saxony did not more trouble his jealous Competitors,
then did his negligence in coming to succor Ratisbon, and in the after
recovery of it. For thereby it was firmly conceived, the scope he aimed at,
was, how he should withdraw himself from his obedience to Caesar, and to
necessitate the Dutchmen to unkennell the Spaniards, as well from out of the
Provinces of the Empire, as out of the Court at Vienna, that so he might rest
absolute in his command, and in the authority which he was more ambitious of
then was his Master; therefore were the Spaniards the worse inclined toward
him; for as it is usual for diffidence to fear every shadow, so did these men
aim at nothing else; nor did they in their secret Council commune about
ought, save how to humble him: And though his actions were in some sort
justifiable by the Maxims of War, by which it seemed he did well in
retreating into Bohemia, out of the fear he might have of Harnem, who was
desirous to quarter his Forces in that Kingdom; yet because what the mind is
once possessed of, is not easily extirpated, this impression was by these reasons
so radicated, as it began to make even those doubt him, who till then had stood
very partial in his defense; who wanting now means how to maintain his
proceedings, lest they might partake in blame with him (for offenses of high
Treason are of so catching a condition, as that they infect even the innocence
of such as do protect the guilty) faced about, and began rather to respect
their own offices and places which they held under the Emperor, then to
consider their sickly and unstable hopes in him; whose only name made such
hateful as pleaded in his defense.

Were, having in vain endeavored to surprise Olims his quarters, joined
himself with the Baron of Sois, a Colonel of the Roman League, and marched to
Vilshoven upon the Danube, between Possaw and Straubing; and Duke Waymer
finding the enterprise of Possaw to be difficult, (as well by reason of the
natural situation thereof, as for that all the Militia that was thereabouts
came in to the defense of it) parted from thence, and leaving 4000 Foot
between Straubing and Ratisbon, passed all his Force beyond the Danube; and
the Swedes perceiving, that the multiplicitie of Commanders of several Nations
and differing opinions in an Army, would not suffer their enterprises to take
any good effect; whilst envy was a hindrance to opportunities, whilst glory
ran too headlong into ambition, and self-interest was mixed in all their
actions; one Captain disliking what another did, and every one thinking
himself fitter then his Companion for the charge conferred on his Colleague; to
avoid these inconveniences, a general assembly of the United States and
Cities, was called to reestablish the League of all the Confederates, and to
resolve upon such Provisions as were behofefull for the War, or else to put
on a last resolution of Peace. And moreover, for that it was necessary to have
a Generalissime, who should command in chief the Protestant Forces, they
maturely consulted hereupon, and at last agreed, that it was expedient to
confer that place upon Duke Bernard Waymer, a German by birth, and
consequently desired by the chief Commanders and Soldiers of that Nation,
which is the sinews and strength of the Swedish Armies; a daring Prince, and
beloved by the Soldier and common people, and one who would hardly submit to
be commanded by a stranger. Though the Deputies, the Soldiers, and other
Princes of the Union were pleased with this Election, yet was not the Duke of
Saxon therewithal satisfied; as well for that the King being dead, he
pretended to be chosen General, and to have the whole weight of the War
entrusted in him, since there was no Prince amongst all the Confederates of
greater strength then he, nor who had more favored the Swedes; as also, for
that Waymers greatness, who was a Prince full of spirit, and descended from
the right line of the first borne of Saxony, which were expelled their state by
the Emperor Charles the fifth, made him not a little fear, that if the
Swedish affairs should prosper, and he should win upon the Soldiers
affections, he might aspire to recover that which he knew had formerly
belonged to his Ancestors. These jealousies having gathered together a great
mass of gross humors in the Electors breast, whom the Caesarian Ministers of
state, failed not to put in mind of what accidents might easily fall out,
inviting him to an accommodation by large proffers, and efficatious persuasions,
he was seen to be much changed, and began to nauseate Oxesternes and Waymers
actions, and to be more cautious in his confiding in them then he was wont; and
this was afterward known to be the rise of Saxonies falling from the Swedes.
Horn, who wisely foresaw this storm, rid post to Franckfort, treated and
consulted with Oxesterne how to find a remedy for so important a business; but
he was not much listened unto by those who governed by passion, gave no ear to
the reasons he alleged; nor was there any one who thought how to appease the
Electors displeasure; for the Swedes were now grown to that hight of pride, as
that they cared not for any one, thinking that every one should take it for a
favor to be numbered among their friends; (the effects of prosperity,
wherewithal men are blinded, and as with Wine, made drunk with confidence and
presumption; as likewise of the prosperity of Northern people, who thinking
abundantly well of themselves, show pride in their actions, affording thereby
occasions to us Italians to call them barbarous.) They pretended, that the
Elector was bound to second their resolves, which made them afterward very well
know, that the government of States ought not be exercised with ambition, nor
passion, but with wisdom, free from any particular interest, and from any
affection which thwarts the public good.

Whilst this Diet was held, Lieutenant General Milander came before Rurort,
which lies upon the Rhyn below Coln, fortified partly after the Ancient, partly
after the Modern fashion; he set upon it, and at the end of seven days, the
Inhabitants not able longer to hold out, surrendered it upon Articles. And in
Alsatia, the Governor of Colmar clothed some of his Soldiers in Countreymens
habits, and feigning as if they carried somewhat to sell, sent them to Ruffac
in Alsatia, not far from Colmar, near to the Mountains which divide that
Province from Lorayne: These surprising the Gate, let in the Swedes that lay
not far off hid in a Wood, who when they were entered the Town (which they
treated but ill) knowing they could not keep it, for the Marquess of Baden
was marching apace toward them, with many Soldiers drawn out of the Garrison
of Brisach, and other parts thereabouts, they retired again with good booty
to Colmar, and took so many of the Magistrates prisoners, as paid 12000
Crowns for their ransom.

Horn was returned from Frankfort to his Army, and was already preparing to
march into the upper Palatinate, and join with Waymer; when Aldringer,
understanding thereof, who was upon those Frontiers with a Body of men
consisting of 8000 Foot and 4000 Horse, watching the Swedes proceedings,
presently quit his quarters, and went toward Tachaw a little Town of Bohemia,
upon the Confines of the Palatinate, into which the Horse of both Parties being
entered, diverse skirmishes were made, wherein the Swedes had the worst, for the
Crabats treated them but ill.

The Duke of Bavaria, and the Duke of Feria, met about this time at Beuberg,
1634.
upon the Iser, near Monaco, where they consulted how they might easiliest
regaine Ratisbon, a place very requisite for the Bavarians interest; but
finding it to be a business of difficulty, for that the Enemy was very strong
in the Field, the Army of the League, and the Spanish Army much weakened by the
death and running away of many of their Soldiers; and that they could not
promise themselves assistance from Walesteine, but rather feared that he might
disturb them in that enterprise; they resolved at last to forbear the
business for a while, and not to hazard the honor of their Armies before a
Town, the taking whereof was uncertain, and the loss certain, which they
were to receive from those that defended it, and in the retreat it behoved them
to make; which is held for an excellent rule by the wisest Commanders: For to
retreat without doing any good, from an enterprise once undertaken, embases the
Soldier, redounds to the discredit of the Officers, adds to the vigor and
reputation of the Enemy, and makes the Leaders on be accounted ill-advised, a
word very hurtful to the Conductors of Soldiers. They therefore quartered
their men, part in Bavaria, part in Swabenland, and part in Tiroll, preparing
for new Levyes, and recruiting their Armies, that at the Spring their numbers
might be full, and they ready to perfect that and other enterprises;
notwithstanding the Swedes wisely foreseeing, that it would be hard for them to
keep Ratisbon, which was environed by the Territories of Bavaria, unless they
had the upper Palatinate free, they commanded Ber^henfield, who was quartered
with 4000 Foot and 2000 Horse, in the parts about Ausburg, to pass over the
Danube, and to go into the Palatinate, and to join himself with Waymer, and
unanimously to fall upon such undertakings as they should think fittest to
maintain their Armies in those Provinces. Yet did not their resolutions take
effect, for the Imperialists having had time to prepare themselves for defense;
the Swedes failed in their endeavors in taking of Amberg, the Metropolitan of
the upper Palatinate, seated in a Champaine Country, beautified with pleasant
and fruitful Hills; and were enforced to withdraw themselves to their former
stations of Chamb and We^den. Horn finding then how hard a matter it would be
to get the Palatinat, by reason of the strength wherewith it was guarded, he
thought it would be better to pass back again into the upper Swabenland,
(wherein the Imperialists garrisons were very weak,) and since he could not
prosper in one place, to endeavor at least the getting of somewhat some-where
else. He therefore quitting the Palatinat, entered into Bavaria, at Landsperg,
and came before Biberack, the which he did furiously set upon; for his
Soldiers who were accustomed to Conquest, being long kept fasting were very
forwards, so as the Town not being able to resist such Assaults, as the Swedes
prepared to make, wanting both sufficient Garrison, and Walls, April 12.
yielded on the 12th of April, and 400 Foot and 70 Horse were suffered to
march out.

Horns return into Swabenland, gave Alarm to all the Imperialists
thereabouts, and awakened the Commanders: and this his coming causing many men
to wonder, who thought it was incredible that he should forsake Bavaria; some
began to think there was somewhat more in it, and in particular Ossa, who
commanded in those precincts was more suspicious then the rest, as was soon
after seen in Colonel Peter Chinich of Salutorne, Governor of Lindaw, who was
arrested, and sent prisoner with a good guard into Tiroll: but his reputation
suffered in no one particular, but only by the false suspicion of the said Ossa,
who bore him little good will, occasioned by the great friendship and
correspondency which Chinich held with the Switzers, and in particular, with
those of Zurich and Berne, two Cantons which confided but indifferently in the
Austrians; and this much the more, because some Spaniards that were of Ossa's
party, and held, not that any one could be faithful to them who was not a
Romanist, fearing much lest Chinich might be a Protestant, and by reason of the
good opinion the Protestants had of him, they agreed to ruin him, rather to
free themselves of this suspicion, then for that he deserved it; which was
sufficient to nourish a conceit, that he had held Intelligence with the Duke
of Rohan, who was then in Rhetia. And matters of State being like wax, which
takes heat, and is distemperd upon any the least occasion, he was imprisoned
before he was accused, though his innocence appearing afterward; by his
absolution, his loyalty shone forth the brighter.

Filisberg, (which as we have already said, was besieged by the Swedes) was now
by Famine brought to great extremity: insomuch as Bawmbergher, and Swarez, who
had the custody thereof yielded upon parley, and had very honorable conditions,
the Fort being surrendered up to Colonel Smigberg on the 13th of January. Ianu.
13.
The loss of this place though it were not of so great consideration in
respect of the situation, yet it being a principal place, it was in the
present conjuncture thought to import much, by reason of the consequences which
depended on it, and for that it was likely it might fall into the Frenchmens
hands, who when they should have gotten thither they might easily advance
further and maintain themselves in Alsatia, and in the lower Palatinat. Yet
they who seemed to be greater Politicians, discoursed alternately hereupon;
those who opposed the reasons alleged by the Swedes, answered, that it was
better to leave it in the hands of the Imperialists, then to win it; for the
French, to whom when they should not surrender it, they should show little
desire of continuing longer friendship with them, by which their Interests was
to receive no small detriment; and by granting it, the gain would appear to
be prejudicial; for besides the depriving of themselves of such a place to
retreat unto, they would draw a power upon their shoulders, which assuming unto
it self the title of being arbitratour of their affairs, the Swedes who
should continue in those parts, would consequently be brought to reverence the
Laws of France; from whence it would ensue, that their authority being limited
and made dependant on the French, their achievements would be unperfect, and
their greatness would not be suffered to exceed the limits which they should
allow them. And though others said that it was not to be imagined that the
French would betake themselves to a business of small satisfaction, suppose
the negative thereunto were granted, for that their Interests required good
intelligence, with friends of so great power, who might otherwise wax jealous:
yet wise men foresaw that no good effect could ensue hereupon; since that the
desire of rule is blind, and the reasons of preserving it, prevail over
whatsoever other respect.

But the considerations which the Protestants had hereupon were far short of
those held by the Austrians; for they thought this to be a greater loss then
any they yet had suffered; not for that the Swedes or Protestants got much
thereby, whose power consisting in the Union of many, they hoped that in time,
and by such means as they might use, they should recover from them what they
had lost; but for fear lest it should fall into the hands of the French, whose
greatness being upheld by the Crown of their only Monarch, and those
Provinces neighboring upon their Kingdom, they well ^oresaw what difficulties
they should meet withal in the regaining of it. The minds therefore of the
Councillors were confused, their judgments uncertain, their resolutions
timorous, their remedies doubtful, and their hopes inconstant. Yet all this
notwithstanding, the Spaniards who are always undaunted in adversity, careful
of their affairs, and most faithful in all their doings, failed not with
their refined judgments to calm the perplexity of their minds, to secure
their fears, to advise what was expedient, to proportion agreements, and to
confirm faith in the certainty of hope.

THe Spanish Army was this mean while quartered in Bavaria to recruit
themselves, and the Spaniards and Italians were very solicitous and diligent in
completing their Companies, that they might recover that renown which was
rather lessened by the badnesse of the season, the difference of climats, the
inhumanitie of the Country people, and the unexperience of fresh Soldiers,
then by the Sword of the Enemy. The Duke of Bavaria, Duke of Feria, Aldringer,
and many other principal men, did in their frequent counsels examine the
present condition, and did in their wisdoms weigh what was fittest and most
needful for the public good, and their own particular honors. The Count
D'Ognata (a deeply intelligent Minister of state) being at Vienna, failed not
in observing what prejudice might be caused by Walesteines infidelity, in
taking order how it might be obviated, and in soliciting Caesar to take some
expedient means for the preservation of his own authority. In Lombardy the
Infanta was diligent in taking men into pay, and in endeavoring Moneys, and
Foot from Spain, whereby to reinforce the Army, and thereby to maintain the
power of Spain in Germany; assistance for the present occasions was
endeavored at Naples, (the Magazine whereby the Spanish greatness is
reinforced, by imposing new grievances upon the Subject, new impositions upon
Salt, and upon the incomes of Fines, or Amerciaments, Customs, and the
Kingdoms Revennues) and to boot with the continual issues of Soldiers which
went from that Kingdom, 6000 Foot were entertained by Prince San Severo, and
other Brigadoes under Don Carlo de Gatta, Lucius Boccapivola, John Baptista
Orsino, Caesar Caracciolo, and diverse others; and the Drums beat through all
the other Dominions of the King of Spain, and assessements were made for the
supply of Men and Moneys, for the German war; upon the which the Spaniards
were as intent as if it had been their own business. At Rome the Spanish
Ambassadors pressed much upon the Pope to assist the Romanists in Germany, and
did much exasperate the sinister behavior of the French. Creqiri abode in the
Court to moderate the Spanish conceptions, and to interest the Pope in behalf
of his King; the Pope by some supply of Moneys did wisely satisfy the
Spaniards, entertained the French in civil manner, and consolated Christendom
with plenary indulgencies; and in fine the eyes of all Europe were fixed upon
what would be the event of the Spanish preparations; when Feria after having
been some few days sick of a Fever, died; and for that after he had been in
a fair way of recovery, he fell into a relapse, some suspected his death might
be occasioned by poison, and that it was done by Walesteines privacy: for he
greatly hated and envied the Spaniards, who being faithful to their Prince*
could not permit that people should live in fear of him, who ought to dread
his Master; nor that the Imperial Ministers of state should be so foolish, as
to admit of defense, or listen to the justification of one guilty of high
Treason. Yet was there no appearance of ground for this conceit.

The Duke of Feria's death as it was gladsome to Walesteine and some other
Dutch Ministers of state, who were not pleased that the Spanish authority
should get further possession in Germany; so was it very much lamented by the
Emperor, the King of Spain, all the Austrians, Spaniards and Italians, the
Crown of Spain having lost in him, one of the worthiest servants it for the
present had, or had had in many years before. He was none of the famous
cryed-up Commanders, for being always employed in state affairs, he was not
accustomed to Arms; and he was arrived at the hight of perfection in state
government, as that Spain did bost it self, and Italy glorified, never to
have been in a more flourishing condition, then under the fortunate guidance of
this Prince. He was excellent in all general knowledge, and upon all occasions
showed himself worthy of the place he bore; his opinions free from flattery,
and now acknowledged to be void of weakness, proved that true borne Spaniards
are not such as through envy they are divulged to be. By the preferring the
good of his King, before his own good, he taught us, that how much the richer
a servant is in deserts, the nakeder he is in his own private designs; his
diligence in resolutions, his sincerity in opinion, his order and judgment in
treating, made it appear, that though Spain be not barren in producing men of
this science, yet had she few that did surpass him, in having served his King
with a more vigorous spirit, with more ready parts, or with a better appointed
judgment: he governed Milan many years, was beloved by the people, well
esteemed by the Soldiers, admired, and feared by Forrayners; he (though
straightened in time) did dexterously raise an Army, did wisely guide it, did
with much success, succor Alsatia, and did with so miraculous constancy
endure the injuries of the weather, and the sterillity the Countries, as his
good government, and the good orders he took, were acceptable to the Soldiers,
supportable to the Subject, and commended by the Enemy. Those who possessed with
an evil opinion of the Spaniards, were afraid at his first coming, and who
more offended by words then deeds eschewed him, did by experience prove, that
his picture was not drawn according to the life, that the civillity of
Spaniards was tolerable, and the behavior of their Commanders worthy to be
reverenced; the very Swedes themselves commending his actions, said they
admired the Spaniards good demeanor, the affability of that Nation, the
modesty of his proceedings; and by seeing that these men though so powerful
dealt not like others, who as soon as they have got footing in another man's
possession, make it lawful to satisfy their desires, they knew that the
detractions which they suffered under, were only the effects of fear, and
weapons used by the weakest, not merited by their actions; and they did further
add, that if all Spaniards were so behaved, they should rather conform and
join themselves with them then with any other Nation.

To say truth, he was a Gentleman of great dexterity, full of affability,
overflowing in courtesy, and most universal in all those indowments which are
required in a generous, prudent, gentile, and most-esteemed-of great state
Officer to a great King; he left his Wife much afflicted, having two Sons
and one daughter.

Walesteines actions were now the general discourse throughout all Vienna, yet
did the Court for many days wisely dissemble their opinion of him, dexterously
concealing the plot laid against him, that they might go upon sure grounds:
for such Officers as are grown to too great an authority, and have the means
to be dangerously harmfull to their Masters, ought to be seized on with
dexterity, and to have their wings clipped before they can bethink themselves,
or let loose the reins to their infidelity.

Walesteine, being by his Friends advertised of all that past, and fearing lest
his designs might perish amidst these storms, he sent for the Colonells,
Tersica his Cousin, and Chinschi his Kinsman, and Illo his favorite, into his
private Closet, where he was much agitated with intestine passion, which on the
one side laid before him his reputation, and the infamous title of disloyal
and ungrateful; on the other side it presented unto his eyes his own fear, the
danger of calumny, the Spaniards hatred, his enemies emulation, and the desire
of revenge; so as involved in these considerations, sorrowing that the
greatness of his eminent fortune should make his downfall the greater, he
narrowly weighed with these men the present emergency, and having wisely
ponderated the imminent danger, he chose a means very proper to plead in his
behalf, and which in some sort might make him seem excusable, were not the
prerogative which Sovereigns hold over their vassalls too Supreme: he then
discoursing upon the instabilitie of fortune, which oft-times abandons those
who thought they had had her surest by the fortop; and upon the incertaintie of
the Planets, which rarely effect those things to which they seem to incline;
complained of the Spanish Ministers of State, laying ingratitude and ambition
to their charge; affirming, that when ever they prefer a servant of theirs they
prepare his precipice, so much the deeper by how much higher he is exalted;
that their reasons, though in appearance leaning upon the Policy of State, are
produced by their own proper interests, whose maxim has in it such ambition,
as that they declare all that live independent thereupon guilty of high
Treason. He moreover taxed the Dutch Ministers of State that were near the
Emperor, of dullness and unadvisednesse, in having suffered that Nation to get
footing in the Court; saying, they were not well verst in the negotiation of
those places they were possessed of* for that, let the necessity be what it
please, it is never good to admit the Officers of one Prince into another
Princes Government, and especially those, that to boot with their own
pretensions, that they may the better maintain their own conceptions, and for
the respect they desire should be borne unto them, add the upbraiding of the
assistance they have given, and good turns they have done. He spared not in
his discourse some Monasticks, who being displeased with him, as he said, for
his rewarding the Soldiers with what the Soldiers got, and not suffering them
to partake thereof as formerly had been used, nay more, for his totally
discarding them from having any thing to do in his affairs, imposing upon
them their attendance upon Gods Service, and the doing their own duties,
declared him to be an Heretic; as for these, he said, they deserved
correction, and not to be fomented, since their pretensions were now grown to
that height, that nothing was to be done wherein they were not to have a
finger. He murmured against the Duke of Bavaria, and breaking forth into bitter
speeches, he declared how the Political part of that Prince was so interessed,
as that from thence proceeded all the past and present miseries; and for that
his hatred was more bent against him then any other, he charged him with many
things, to make his Commanders know his accusations proceeded not from malice,
but out of entire loyalty; and principally, he accused him of little good will
to the Emperor, by being the means of withdrawing from Caesar the strength of
those Forces, which whilst governed by him Walesteine awed Germany, and kept
all the Princes and States of the Empire within the bounds of duty; wherein if
they had still continued, those miseries had never been which had of late
been tasted; he affirmed, that this Duke had conspired against his person, not
so much for that he saw him a so much dreaded General, as for that he had
never given his consent that the title of Elector Palatinate should be
conferred upon him, nor yet that his Dominion should be so much enlarged, for
that he well foresaw the Emperor would never enjoy peace thereby, since the
Protestant power suffering thereby violence, which was fomented by two great
Crowns, France and England, he would not quietly enjoy the Palatinate;
according to Hidra's heads, one head being struck off another would rise up in
its place: for it was certainly known, the Protestants would never suffer that
honor to depart from one of their profession, nor yet would foreign
Potentates suffer that Prince to be driven out, who being upheld by many props,
as well within as out of Germany, was almost able to counterpoise the Imperial
greatness, which being now annexed unto the power of Spain, makes all Europe
not a little jealous: he accused him to have assisted and consented unto the
coming of Feria, as independent on him, not for the public good, but for his
extirpation, plainly discovering, that the restraining an authority granted,
is a sign of suspicion, from whence many evils take their rise, since thereby
the good will of well-doers suffers an allay. In brief, as it is usual with
emulation to make appearances seem substances, Walesteine rather envying this
Princes greatness and his solid wisdom, then invited by any just occasion of
blame in him, who was ever known to be a wise Prince, full of goodness and
loyalty toward Caesar, spoke thus of him: But afterward coming to resolve
upon what was to be done, he agreed with them that they should divulge it
throughout the Army, how that he, finding how his actions were falsely
interpreted at the Court in Vienna, was resolved to quit his charge, and to
betake himself to a private life, wherein wisemen rest secure from passions of
the mind, and from such downfalls as envy lays traps for in other men's
actions; that they should show unto the other heads of the Army, and to the
whole Soldiery, how much they should be indammaged if this should happen; that
they should murmr against the injurious Officers and evil Counselors which
had possessed themselves of Caesar's ear, who being desirous to enjoy the reward
which belongs to the labor of valiant and well-deserving Subjects, endeavored
to loosen their hands of gratitude which were bound up by his authority, in
disposing of what was gotten to deserving Soldiers, and not to Jesters or
Courtflatterers; that they should likewise give out, that the Spaniards Plotted
his ruin, for no other end, but that as they had obtained their share in
Counsels, they might likewise get the charge and command over the Soldiers to
make them slaves to their ambition; that whilst they had need of his wealth to
be employed in the raising of an Army, and of his credit in persuading the
people to serve the Empire faithfully, his actions were commended and so
received, as that infinite promises were made and obligations acknowledged, but
these ceasing, the memory of al past-benefits vanished to air; that these new
Counselors envied their companions greatness, and did no sooner find out any
good place, but they streightway sought how to possess themselves of it; he
said, it was an experimented case that some make use of their servants no
otherwise then husbandmen do of their Cattle, which after long and laborious
service are brought to the Shambles; that his affection toward the Soldier
was not unknown to them, how liberally he used to make them partake of the
fruits of his Victories and Authority.

They were further to add that by the deposing of this General, his promises
would fail of being effected, and they were to fail in their pretended
satisfactions; for whosoever else should Command, would endeavor to reward
those, whom he already found inroled in his own affection, not those whom he
should know depended upon his rival; and that it being usual in these times
to hate such as are friends to our Enemies, (preferring private passion before
public good) they should be necessitated to much obsequious sufferance, to
preserve themselves in his favor: that therefore it behoved them all to
intercede, by their humble supplications to Walestein his Highness, that he
would not forgo this Army, which so much needed his assistance, and wherein
his own interest so much consisted; and that they should do well to inform
the Emperor how prejudicial the loss of this Commander would be. By this
Tiberian cunning of Walesteine the chiefest of the Army were much moved; for it
is natural to humane affection, greedily to solicit such things as they
desire, when those things seem to shun them.

The other Colonels persuaded by these leading men, whose speeches seemed as so
many oracles, (such reverence did they bear unto them by reason of their
intimacy with the General) agreed all in a resolution jointly to present
themselves before Walesteine, and to entreat him not to hurl that Army into a
precipice of miseries, which he had raised above the mountains of Victory and
Glory; that they would not yield to obey any other General; that great was the
necessity, the tempest violent, the Imperial dignity likely to be overthrown,
should it be deprived of his Worth; that therefore they were resolved to follow
him, and never forgo his Command* Walesteine seeing the hearts of his
Commanders so well disposed to his service, wrought it so, as that Illo, should
secretly and as it were of himself propound unto the rest of the Colonels,
that if they desired his Highness should continue his charge, they were to
secure him of their faith, (let whatsoever mischief happen through the
malignity of the times, and of his enviers) with giving him somewhat under
their hands to this purpose. The Colonels, who as has been formerly said were
very well affected to him, for his liberality used toward them, as well in
honors as in favors (the greatest tie whereby the Soldiers love can be bound)
and who therefore reverenced him, he having particularly obliged many of them
by conferring places upon them, which he would not perhaps have given to
others, following herein the Ottoman policy, who value none, nor take any into
their Musters, save such as are valiant and courageous, resolved to underwrite
and subscribe unto a writing drawn up to this purpose.

We Colonels and Chieftaines of the War, whose names are under written,
understanding that the Duke of Mechelberg was resolved to quit his Command of
Generalissimo, to his Caesarian Majesty, since that he is falsely calumniated in
the Court at Vienna, though we have ever known his actions to be most loyal;
and taking into mature consideration, that if this should happen, much mischief
would ensue hereupon; we therefore moved out of the fidelity we owe to his
Caesarian Majesty, to the Roman Religion, and to the whole Empire, having
willingly and out of our own accord humbly besought our said General, not to
abandon us in this so important conjuncture and great emergency, wherein his
assistance is so requisite, do all of us promise and oblige our selves, upon
the faith of Gentlemen of honor, to stick still close unto him, (nor ever to
part from him, or relinquish him, for any cause or accident whatsoever) after
the best manner, and with the greatest faithfulness we are able.

This writing subscribed by 42 Colonells, did much inhearten Walesteine, and
afflict the Austrian Ministers of State, who no ways affrighted with the
eminency of this danger, but rather assuring themselves by these proceedings of
what before they did suspect, betook themselves to their deepest wisdom and
acutest wit. Whereupon it was given out, that the wisest of the Austrian
Officers meeting on the 12th of January in Count d'Ognates house, Ianu. 12.
(the Spanish Ambassador) the fittest means were considered of, how to save
the Imperial authority from receiving a blow by the treachery of this man.
Some were of opinion, That they ought to temporize and bear with his actions,
and afterward upon fitting occasions withdraw the Soldiers from him, under
the command of Italian Colonels, and not Bohemians or Dutch, that so being
deprived of his so much feared retinue, he might be brought to give an account
of his actions. Many knowing that in State-affaires Princes ought not to
defer their resolutions, but rather to consider every shadow of danger as a
real harm, were of opinion (and this was the embraced advice) That Picolomini
and Gallasse, men of unsuspected fidelity, should be suddenly sent unto him to
arrest his person: But some difficulty appearing likewise in this resolution,
the good success whereof was not certain, for that Walesteine was begirt with
many Troops of his Kinsmen, and such as sided with him, so as though the rest
of his Army should have obeyed the Emperors letters Parents conferred upon
Gallasse, (which notwithstanding would be hardly effected) the Bohemian
Captains, and the greater part of the Dutch Commanders, whose affections were
great unto their General, would not withdraw themselves from his obedience;
whereby he might betake himself with his most intimate friends to some strong
holds, from whence he could not be gotten out without surprizall, or siege,
(things of time, and full of lets, the Enemy being near at hand, by whom he
might be succourd) and so the undertaking prove rather prejudicial, then
profitable; therefore craft, and deceit, was thought to be the best
resolution; and that to compass their ends, they were to corrupt some of his
Commanders, the true way to work mischief to ones Enemy; for there is no so
secure Treason, as that which is wrought by ones dearest friends or most
esteemed Servants; nor was there any better means found to secure themselves
from this flame, then to take away the fuel that fed it. They therefore
secretly wrought an understanding with some Irish Officers of Tersica's
Regiment, with whom certain Spaniards were very inward, that by all means,
they might be sure to secure Walesteines person, by which action, to boot with
the purchase of immortal glory, they were promised large recompense, and
extraordinary honor: nor should they by such an act any whit stain their
reputation or their bounden duty, since that fighting under the Empire of
Ferdinand the second, they were first bound to him, before unto their General;
nay, it would be a great evidence of their loyalty to fence their Prince from
Felony.

These words prevailed much with Lesley Captain of Tersica's Regiment, who
betaking himself unto the business, communicated the whole affair to
Captain Butler, and then to Cordon, Lieutenant-Colonell, and Governor of
Egra, all three of them very much confiding one in another. These being
desirous to be known the Instruments of so great safety, and the Preservers of
the Emperors Authority, went consideratly seeking out how they might compass
their ends: but it being an uncertain, and dangerous thing to make him
prisoner; for though the chief Commanders faithfully serving Caesar, should
obey his supremest Commands; yet the Captains Authority availing but a little,
when not seconded by obedience of the Soldiers, they plainly saw that these
being well affected to their General, would rather be ready to free him, then
to obey the command of their Officers. To prevent this therefore, they resolved
to kill him; for since a dead man wages War no more, and that there are but few
that prove themselves lovers of Carcasses, this was the true means to bring so
wished for an endeavor to good end. Caesar notwithstanding (as it is said) was
not pleased with this way of proceeding; for being a Religious Prince, and one
that feared God, he thought that before the cause were known, it became not
the Tribunal of his justice to give way to homicide: as also his Majesty
having borne particular affection to Walesteine, knowing him to be a very
useful Servant, he could not, (no not for such a suspicion) totally blot him
out of his good opinion. But for that Princes affections, though never so
great, are overborn by reason of State, and his Divines telling him, that God
was not offended at the actions of great men, when they are done for the
public safety; that many things were permitted to Princes, for the
preservation of their dominions, which were prohibited to private men; and that
of two evils the least was to be chosen; he suffered himself to be persuaded
to underwrite the Order, but yet with limitation; though his Ministers of
state, knowing the necessity of the resolution, 'twas said, that they made the
heads of the conspiracy understand ex part, that they should use the best
means they could to effect what was agreed upon for the public good.

Whilst the Austrians at Vienna spread their nets, and did all that lay in
them, to effect their mentioned deliberations, and whilst Walesteine on the
other side endeavored by the hook of promises to win upon the affections of
the heads of his Army, Horn having taken Biberack, and being advertised, that
some Imperialists were quarterd at Mitelbiberack, (a Town not far from thence)
he secretly came before it, surprised it, put most of them to the Sword, and
the next morning with Petards and scaling-Ladders entered Valsdee, a Town of
Swabenland, seated in a Champion between certain Woods almost in the center of
that Province, environed with Walls and Towers, and some Palisadoes and Rampires
about the Gate, after the ancient manner, the which he sacked and evilly
entreated; from thence advancing forward, he took Ravenspurg, and some other
Towns weakly defended.

The Country People of upper Austria, at this time took up Arms, and some
Towns rose, and did much disturb the Passage upon the Danube; for
overrunning the Country from Lintz to Passaw, they robbed the Barks that past
thereupon, and did other mischief to those Frontiers; whereupon some Regiments
being sent toward them, many of them were taken and cut in pieces, and diverse
of the chief of the sedition were hanged.

Walesteine was full of sad thoughts, which suggested his fall unto him, and
the danger of his actions: whereupon not finding any better means to escape so
important an emergency, then a bold and dauntlesse resolution, he resolved
(since that the justifications made in his behalf at the Court by his Cosen
Maximilian Walesteine were ill interpreted) to do that very thing which was
most feared: and therefore after his retreat from Saxony into Bohemia, 'twas
noised that he sent Baron Schaffemburg Lieutenant-Generall of the Horse under
pretense of quartering some Regiments in Austria, but that afterward being
suffered to come into Vienna, he should endeavor some mischief against the
Emperor and his Counselors. But (it being usual with those that distrust,
not to suffer any thing to pass unweighed in the balance of fear and
suspicion) as he desired to lodge some of his Troops about Vienna, some of the
Austrian Ministers of state, objecting that he was one of Walesteines
confederates, and believed to be one that sided with him, he was arrested in
his own house and a good guard put upon him: and the Emperors Council
soreseeing that in jealousy of State-affaires all delays are harmefull, that
they might not let the malady grow worse, and having already agreed upon the
business with the aforementioned Officers of the Garrison of Egra (whether they
foresaw Walesteine was to come as the fittest place for succor of the Swedes
and Saxons) they resolved to write to Gallasse, that he should take upon him
the government of the Army, prosecute Walesteine, and proclaim him, and all
that adhered unto him, Rebels; and that he should promise and ascertaine
pardon unto every one, who though formerly copartner in his Felony, should
abandon his obedience to him. And thus Letters Patents, and Orders, were sent
abroad into all quarters signifying this man's Rebellion, and inhibiting every
one to follow or obey him.

Yet did this resolution meet with a thousand doubts; 'twas feared lest
mischief might ensue hereupon; for if Walestein should join with the Saxon
Forces, he should have little less then totally have dis-membred the Emperors
Army, the greatest part whereof consisted of Dutch and Bohemian Commanders, and
all the Soldiery depending upon him, as one who largely rewarded them, and
conferred places upon them, whereby he might believe to rely upon their
obedience. The news which he had caused to be spread abroad, that he would make
himself be crowned King of Bohemia, would be acceptable to all the Princes and
free Cities of the Empire: for since it is no good policy to love to confine
upon a great and powerful Prince, whose Forces may continually be feared,
'twas the true way to rest secure from the Austrian jealousy, if that Kingdom
should fall upon a third person, and the Imperial Crown be thereof deprived,
which every one dreaded, by reason of its great Potency, and consequently
nothing else could be argued but that he should be assisted and succored, not
only by the Swedes, and Elector of Saxony, but by all the other Princes and
Cities who were jealous of the Austrian Monarchy.

In this revolution of affairs, Walesteine not thinking himself safe in
Pilsen, for that he was far from the Protestant Forces, and yet not willing
to go from thence, he sent a messenger of purpose to acquaint Waymer, who was
quartered about Camb in the Palatinate, to invite him to come speedily to
Pilsen, for he would deliver the City into his hands, and desire his
assistance, till such time as he might recover a place of safety to think
upon his affairs. Duke Waymer surprised with this unexpected news, much
marvelled at so sudden a resolution, as is usual in things thought unpossible,
and for that he who knows and governes all things here below, would not permit
that the wickedness of one should be the ruin of so many, Waymer thinking
this to be but a piece of imposturisme, which upon other occasions he was
accustomed to use, would not give belief thereunto: but being more suspicious
then formerly (for little faith is given to one that has once been faulty)
he sent back the messenger with colorable excuses, not believing that
Walesteine could possibly fall so violently upon such a resolution. Wherefore
Walesteine, seeing his design fail, resolved immediately to be gone from
Pilsen, and to withdraw himself to Egra (a City of Bohemia, upon the borders
of Misnia, watered by the River Eger, a place of moment, begirt with Walls and
Ditches, though old, yet good and strong) that he might be the nearer to
receive necessary succor from Duke Waymer and the Duke of Saxony, many of
whose Forces were upon those Frontiers. He therefore marched thitherward, with
Tersica, Chinschi, and Illo, and about 1000 Horse; whither being come, he
again advertised Waymer as formerly, desiring him that he would lose no time
in advancing; but neither did this free Waymer of suspicion, but fearing to be
overreached, he grew more and more diffident; and the Conspirators, seeing the
occasion now proper to give accomplishment to their design, bethought
themselves how to effect it. Cordone, who was Governor of the Town, Febru. 25.
did on the 25th of February invite Tersica, Illo, and Chinschi (who came
accompanied with one Captain Niman) to sup with him in the Castle, where he
himself was lodged: supper being ended, and the servants who waited at table
being dismissed, that they might likewise sup, a Squadron of Armed men, chosen
out to that end, entered the house, and cried a loud, Long live Caesar; Cordone,
and the rest of the Conspirators, who were set at the end of the table toward
the door, flew from their seats, and withdrawing themselves apart, gave way
for eight Soldiers to come in with Halberts and Spits, who presently flew upon
the Rebels; and they throwing down the table drew their Swords, and
upbraiding Cordone and his companions with treachery, would have defended
themselves, had not their courage been confused, and the strength of their
arms abated by this this superchery and unexpected accident. For whilst
confused with fear and anger, they knew not on which side to look, Tersica
being slain with the blow of a Halbert, which struck him on his left side, and
Chinschi, being beaten to the ground with a Hammer, none but Illo was permitted
to dye like a Soldier, and to prove that courageous hearts yield not to death,
no not when most ghastly portraited, or in the most dangerous encounters: for,
retiring himself unto a window, loudly accusing the Conspirators of infamy and
base ingratitude, mis-becomming a Soldier, and calling for help unto his
Soldiers, he so defended himself, as the Conspirators, partly by the fury of
his countenance, partly by his threatening voice, and partly by his Sword, were
almost brought to an ill pass, when laying hold upon a Spit, (whose blow he
had warded) whilst he labored to pluck it out of the Soldiers hand, he was
therewithal thrust through the neck, so as it behoved him to breath (...) that
soul, which expiring with the sight of his Enemies blood, it may be believed
he dyed satisfied with his own undauntednesse. Niman in this hurley burley
pleaded innocence, and asked pardon, and going out of the chamber, might
perhaps have escaped, had not the guard which waited in the Court as he came
down the stairs, run upon him, and slain him with their Swords. This
execution being done, Walesteine only remained to put an end to this direful
Conspiracy; they therefore consulted how they might make him sure: and
considering that to arrest him, would be dangerous, uncertain, and almost
impossible, though he were deprived of these his confidents, by reason of the
uproare that would be amongst the Soldiers and other heads of the Army, they
resolved, the most expedient means would be suddenly to kill him likewise, for
this was the only short way to effect their intents. They went out of the
Castle about twelve a clock at night, and went toward the Generals Lodging
which was upon the Piazza, who a little before hearing Tersica^ and Chinschis
wives complain of their husbands tarrying abroad so late, was got into the
window, and asked the Centinells what those complaints meant, for he was one
(as has been said) that could not endure any noise; Cordone being known to
the guard, was suffered quietly to pass by them, who thought he went to speak
with Walestein about some important business, as Governors use to do; and as
without asking any question, he was coming from the antichamber into the room
where the General was, the doorkeeper withstood him, telling him he had
received directions not to suffer any one whatsoever to come in* whereupon they
both drew, and the doore-keeper was presently slain. Walesteine hearing this
noise, ran toward the door, and met the Conspirators, one of which couching
his Halbert, ran him through both the sides, whereat he presently fell and
dyed; hereupon an Alarm being given by the guard of the Piazza, the news was
forthwith spread throughout the whole City, from every quarter whereof the
Soldiers flocking with their Weapons in their hands were ready to revenge
their Generals death, had not Cordone appeased them, by declaring unto them in
the best manner he could the Emperors directions; wherefore there being no
hopes to be had in him that was dead, and fear to be apprehended from them
that were alive, they cried out, Long live Caesar. And those that were most
affectionate to him, seeming to rejoice at his downfall, endeavored rather by
such demonstrations to free themselves of being thought his friends, then to
call to mind their obligations to him.

The next morning the Duke of Saxon Lavemberg, who had some days before sent a
Trumpet into Erga, to acquaint Walesteine how that he was to speak with him
touching the Peace, which was yet in Treaty with Saxony, had much desired him
to send him a safe Convoy; Cordone deteining the Dukes Trumpeter, sent one of
Walesteines Trumpeters to him, to let him know that he expected him; who not
fearing such a Stratagem, nor hearing of the late news (for faith once given,
makes the most detested Enemies be believed) came to the Town, and was
presently carried to see the dead bodies, had a good guard set upon him, and
was conveyed to Vienna. The Imperialists endeavored likewise to ensnare
Waymer, inviting him again in Walesteines behalf to come to Egra; but he
(though by reason of the information he had had from other parts, he began to
believe what had in Walesteines behalf been said upon him) did not
notwithstanding advance without a good strength with him; so taking 2000 of the
best Horse of his whole Army along, he marched thitherward; and being almost
come to the Town, he met with some Companies of Crabats, who by orders from
Gallasse kept those ways, and knew not what had happened in Egra, nor of the
agreement; they had a great skirmish together, and the Crabats meeting with
hard measure were fain to fly fort, whereby Waymer being aware of the plot
returned back to his former quarters.

This news of Walesteines death, and of the other great Commanders, being
presently known at Vienna, and every where divulged, did much rejoice such
whose minds were troubled in this perplexity; but if such as were faithful to
the Empire were glad hereof, those who sided with Walesteine and were his
friends, were not so, for hereby all their designs were cut off: nor yet were
the Curious satisfied herewithall, for matter being likely to arise from such
novelties as would please an itching ear, they desired not the occasion
thereof should be taken away. Some that wished not well to the Austrian party
would declare him to be innocent, and gave out that the Spaniards had
wrongfully accused him, and to no other end, then to bereave him of that
Authority, which being independent on them did not please them: that they had
butchered him, for that they very well knew he being full of exalted thoughts,
which would not suffer him to comply with their intentions, nor yet to permit
that Forrayners should be entertained to do that which those of the Nation
were able to effect, they feared they should not long enjoy what they had
possessed themselves of in Germany, where they exceedingly desired to be esteemed
of, for the Spaniards think no man can govern himself wisely, unless
assisted by their wily craft. Others discoursing upon the grounds of past
examples, concluded that if Walesteine had been resolved to violate his faith
unto his Master, he was of so quick a spirit, and foresight, and was possessed of
so plenary an Authority, as he might easily have effected any thing he had
intended. Others said, that making use of this pretense, he called to mind the
injury that was done him, in having his charge formerly taken from him, without
any demerit of his, and that therefore he had not forgot revenge. Some
conceived, that he being extraordinarily proud, and excessively ambitious of
honor, could no longer content himself with his present condition, but that
he aimed at the Kingdom of Bohemia; though this opinion was moderated by
others upon well-grounded reasons: for that he was already well in years, and
almost impotent; he wanted issue male, nor was he likely to have any; his
honor and reputatition was already sufficiently well grounded, the Characters
whereof should be registered in memory, and that therefore he could not think
to obscure the glory of his past fidelity, with a thought of a short enjoying
that, the event whereof was uncertain, and the infamy certain. Others said,
that the desire of growing greater, blindfolds men's understandings, obfuscates
their senses, and withdrawes the eyes, even of the wisest men, fixing them
only upon the desired Object; that therefore there being few that can resist
the force of their affection^ and see the gulf, or whirlepoole* which keeps
near unto their transcendent greatness, they unexpectedly slip down
thereinto: and that it had thus befalne Walesteine, in the quiet condition of
his present estate, and not contented with the honors and greatness which he
had acquired. The truth was, for what may be gathered from considerate men,
that Walesteine not being satisfied with the Spaniards and Duke of Bavaria, for
the reasons aforesaid, and much suspecting their cunning, bethought himself
how he might best fence himself from their blows, and make Germany see how
evilly the Emperor was counseled in bringing in of auxiliary Forces, whilst
he with his own Forces promised to supply what was needful, desiring that the
aid from Spain might be received in Moneys, and not in men, since Authority is
bounded by independent Forces; and that therefore (as his chief end) he
neither consented to join with the Swedes, nor openly to rebel against the
Emperor: But that pretending as Duke of Mechelberg to be a sovereign Prince,
and that the Militia paid by his Money belonged properly to him, going off from
his charge with the Soldiers that depended on him, it is conceived that by
making a third party, he would become a looker on and see where the business
would end; and that which side so ever should seek for succors from him,
should be enforced to give him such Conditions as he would desire. And for that
his confidence in the Emperors goodness, bereft him of that consideration
which ought with well-weighed wisdom to be sounded by men powerful in
Authority, he was not aware that the affections of Princes by how much the
higher and more unaccessible they are, so much the easier are they to be
overwhelmed into the hatred of State-jealousies, he supposed to reduce Caesar
to the necessity of giving him satisfaction, by driving out those Forreiners,
and preserving the Authority which he had granted him: but neither daring nor
willing impetuously to hazard himself upon a point, the end whereof was
uncertain, and whereby the name of disloyal would certainly be purchased, he
temporised in an appearing distaste, persuading himself out of his ambitious
confidence and self presumption to reap consolation; the which he did firmly
belief, thinking it was not then time to displease him, nor that any other
could undergo the great weight of that charge; since that his actions appeared
always to be very faithful, till that after Feria's coming they began to be
somewhat slow in ordinary services: and for that the interest of Princes, are
like purest Crystal, which is dimmed and rendered obscure by the least breath,
and that verbal counsels are of more force then those that are conveyed by
the pen, it was the opinion of many, that those who did then possess Caesar's
ear took opportunity by colorable appearances to make Walesteines actions
seem suspicious, and to make the Emperors Council be of the same opinion.
Many approve hereof by this* that if he had totally resolved to forgo his
obedience to the Emperor, and side against him, he (as a wise man and mightily
followed) would not have given such evidence of his intent, (State-affaires
being of so nice a nature, that bare appearances, therein appear real
substances) but that concealing his desire under feigned dissimulation, he
would upon some fitting occasion have withdrawn himself from the service
together with his chief Commanders, and Soldiers very well affected to him;
and that he would have done this so, as that the Swedes and Saxons believing
him should have come in unto his aid. And this was approved of by the testimony
of the Swedish Generals, who being asked concerning this business, by men of
no common account, could not say otherwise. But be it how it will, the
business is weighty and worthy of remembrance, so as I think it not fitting
to leave it here abruptly off, but by making a short digression to acquaint the
reader with some of this great Commanders qualities.

Walesteine was borne a private Baron of Bohemia, a Child of fortune, not much
inricht in Patrimony, nor other indowments; he past his Infancy under the
Tutorship of the Jesuits, where his lively spirit, when he began to be first
downe-feathered, broke the reigns of observancy, and fear of those his
Elders, and varying in the instability of his disposition, he seemed sometimes
inclined to Arms, sometimes to learning, sometimes to other extravagancies;
being afterward entered into the larger field of Youth, and therein giving
himself over to what his genius most led him unto, and freedom to his unquiet
spirit, letting his desires domineer over him, he spent some time uncurb'd by
consideration, whereby he got the respect of unwise and unstable: desirous
afterward to know other Countries, and the fashions of other Nations (a
knowledge which well becomes men of Command) he visited Flanders, enjoyed the
sight of England, satisfied himself in France, went into Italy, (a Country
which refines the Northern wits) and having admired the magnificency of Rome,
the delights of Naples, the quaintness of Tuscani, and the fertility of
Lombardy, his curiosity fixed it self in Padua, a City apertaining to the most
illustrious state of Venice, the Mother of liberal sciences, receptacle of the
learned, fountain of virtue, and there he applied himself to diverse studies,
whereof he made himself at least a partaker, if not a perfect master; though
the vivacity of his spirit, and his unquiet opinions, made many esteem him to
be foolishly conceited. Leaving Padua with little of renown, though he had got
the Language, and custom of the Country, he returned to Bohemia; where not
able to remain idle, though laughed at by many, and contrary to the will of his
Comrades, he disposed himself to spend part of what his Trustees had gotten in
his absence, and, yet being naturally thereunto inclined, he applied himself
to Arms, the strong keys of glory and greatness. The Archduke Ferdinand
being molested in Friuli by the Venetian Forces, desired aid of the Emperor;
whereupon Walesteine boldly proffered to raise 300 Horse at his own proper
costs and charges; which offer being accepted of, and by him punctually
performed, he went with the title of Colonel to the succor of Gradisca, where
he tarried during that action, begetting wonder in men, by his generous
extravagancies, and courteous liberality; he was sumptuous in his invitations,
(the true ties of affection) reviving the conversation of his friends,
rewarding and solacing the Soldiers; nothing being more able to captivate the
good will of the Militia then generositie. Many therefore began to be desirous
of his service, which by these actions was pleasing to the Archduke and his
Ministers. Charles Count of Arach, a much favored Counselor of Ferdinands
would join alliance with him, gave him his daughter for wife, and consequently
made him partaker of his affection and protection. The differences of Friuli
being composed in peace, troubles arising in Bohemia, and the Archduke being
made Emperor, he had occasion to exercise his warlike genius; his father
in-law had opportunity to countenance him, and fortune to favor him. Being
afterward of a private man become a Prince, being from a Colonel preferred to
be a General, and discovering himself to be wise, from being thought a fool,
he made the world see, that his study was not to change opinion, but condition;
and that there is no better fence against the blows of envy or malice, then
the received opinion of not being greatly wise; and that fortune there showers
her favors where are the clouds of extravagancy. The War being afterward
brought to a happy end, as by his means the Imperial State was augmented, so
did Caesar, (who is always wont munificently to reward good services) by
investing him with the Dukedom of Mechelberg, make him a Sovereign Prince,
and of a Subject, a Feudatory of the Empire. Being arrived at this hight,
surrounded with so many applauses, secured by so great merit, and glorying in
his worthy actions, knowing that a good Militia is the security of
Principalities, and and that Soldiers flock thither where recompenses are
frequent, honor invites, estimation inheartens, and gratitude opens the door
to munificence; by cherrishing ambition with titles, puffing up valor with
praises, and securing affection by effects, he drew unto his service the best
Swords, and best Wits, that of late ages have managed Arms.

Walesteine was ambitious in all his actions, grave and haughty in all his
treaties, wise, and advised in all his resolutions; he was not governed by
selfe-interest, not moved by profit, nor pliable by adulation; he exceedingly
desired to be reverenced, coveted to be observed, and was a great maintainer of
punctuallitie; he could not endure any defect in his Army; he liked not
confusion; he was offended at the sloth and ignorance of those who were not
endued with those parts and conditions which he desired, to wit, greatness of
spirit, quickness of understanding, readiness in Treaties, foresight in
their doings, obedience to commands, faithfulness in executions. He did so
abhor any base action, as that his favor being once lost by any single
fault, it was not to be regained by whatsoever meritorious act. He declared,
that under his command, Soldiers were to live and behave themselves like
Soldiers, and not think they had girt their Swords about them (as many do)
to win fame amongst the weak and vulgar sort, but amongst men of courage;
such as were abandoned by fortune, and yet abounded in worth and valor, were
by him splendidly entertained, assisted with competent helps, and such as
exceeded many of their deservings: his magnanimity of mind could not tolerate,
that a gallant wit should beg that which so many unworthy men possessed; and
therefore he afforded them means to exercise their talents, and to climb up
those steps which Princes ought to leave free to such, as gathering rust in
idleness, and kept low by the Antipathy of such as govern, if they had
wherein to employ themselves, would (being esteemed of by others) prove
peradventure the abstract of perfection. No man's authority nor protection was
of weight with him, not permitting, that either the conditions of birth, nor
the intercession of such as were powerful, nor that the riches of a blunted
spirit should obscure the qualities of inferiors, and bereave that which
worthily becomes a man of merit. Valor and knowledge in Arms, were to him the
only recommendations of a Soldier; Doctrine and exemplary life, the like to
him of Church men; Wisdom and capacity in State-Officers; Diligence and
faithfulness in servants. Speech, nor writing, nor the request of great ones,
were not able to put any one in his favor; whosoever made use of such means,
rather impaired his cause then bettered it. In his Soldiers, he especially
loved quickness of spirit, extravagancy in thoughts, and ambition; affirming,
that Valor would not admit of a low mind, a limited opinion, nor respectfull
humility. A ready action, a new thought, an unsuall audacitie, were the true
ways which led to his favor. He valued high spirits above vulgar wits, no
less then do good breakers of Colts. He held an opinion, that a Soldier who
had too tender a conscience, and was too scrupulous in his resolution, could
never be perfect in the Soldiers craft. He was not given to sensuality; for
since lust reigns only in idleness, he that had his understanding busied
about the speculation of greatness and sublime affairs, could not bend to a
flying shadow of imperfect fruition. He affirmed, there was no defect more
blamable in a great man then sensuality; that the strength of Mars grew weaker
in the delights of Venus; that the toughness of the mind was distempered by
the fire of appetite; that constancy was lost in the laborinth of too much
tenderness, and politic wisdom in the like of speculation; that the
liveliness of the spirit suffered through the mist of Effeminacy. He much
coveted to exceed others in glory; and being almost drunk with envy, he let
himself loose to be governed thereby; he termed those poorly-minded, who
content with the condition they were in, did only live to eat, and slept to
divert the tediousness of time, which they could no otherwise employ then in
satisfying their senses; he was immesurably angry; sudden in his hatred; rash
in resolutions; obstinate in the execution thereof. Lasinesse was never lodged
in his bosom; he spent such hours as he could exempt, from either politic or
military affairs, in the study of some Science, and in speculation how he
might make himself more remarkable. Dissimulation was banished his Court; nor
cared he for any that used it: he said, it was the weapons of fearful and
basely minded men, who would cover their pusillanimity under a smile, or tear;
that base flattery became not freedom and liberty. He was well-pleased with
pomp, sumptuousness, and applause. He affirmed they merited not the honor of
Command, whose appetite lead them not to glory; that glory was the Lantern
which led the way to worthy actions. Such of his followers as were most brave
and costly in their apparel were best liked by him; he had no harbor for
covetousness; he abounded in liberality; he called those who were mony-Masters,
Servants, and that wise man a fool who did worship his Cofery; he was of
opinion that he who had not a great heart and much of generosity could never
become a great Commander. He would reply to some of his friends, who would put
him in mind that Gold is the sinnewes of greatness, you say well, but it must
be then in the hands of one that is not a slave thereunto: greatness follows
greatness; great Soldiers have great hopes, and these keep the field, where
great rewards are to be had: whilst Caesar powers on me his great
magnificencies you see how he is served; I find no Gold that can weigh in the
scales with the merit of a valiant Soldier; read the bed-role of my
Commanders, and then argue upon any actions. He added that Soldiers were
Masters of Gold, not that of them; Kingdoms might be said to be cheaply got,
by rewarding the Militia; that no better interest or use was made of Moneys
then from that principal which was invested in the Sword, in a bold courage
and resolute headpeece: that Princes were never impoverished by rewarding their
servants. He greatly loved his masters gereatnesse; he desired he should be
reverenced, and coveted still to make him greater; knowing very well that by
how much the greater Princes are, so much more conspicuous is the function of
their Officers. He laughed at some ignorantly ambitious, who for having mustered
their Squadrons, or stood Centinell some one might, in some safe Fort, far
enough from the Enemy, pretended to be equally treated with them who had lost
their blood, and by their experience had made themselves worthy of employment;
as his favors shewred plentifully down upon men of worth, so were the hopes
of ignorant and poorly spirited men but small.

To counterpoise his praiseworthy conditions, they were much allaid by his
haughtiness, cruelty, and hasty fierceness; his unstablenesse in Religion,
the little respect he bore to the Churchmen, and his heretical maxims, made
him be known to be wicked, a miscreant, and not deserving a good name. He
together with the Churchmen, exceedingly hated their riches; were it either
that he himself coveted them, or for the natural envy he bore to another man's
goods, or for that he would curry favor with the Germans, the greatest part
whereof were no friends to Friars. He would abusively say amongst his friends,
that the exorbitant greatness of some of these Churchmen, was, both ratione
divina and humana, to be moderated by wise Princes: exaggerating, that
clothing their appetites with these worldly preferments, and giving way to
temptation through their having the world at will, they became idle, and ran
into many public scandals; he added that the enriching of these men was the
impoverishing of the laity; since that the Moneys which were more then
superfluous for them, and was lost in their luxuries, might be employed to the
public service of the Empire; moreover that since by their great revennues the
incomes of Princes was lessened, it was a matter of great consideration, that
so many should be suffered to enjoy so pleasing a quiet; for that if they were
turned loose into the world, neither would generation so much decline, nor
would Christian Princes be put to such streights for Soldiers, Towns would
not be so unpeopled, neither would Principality be so much prejudiced.

He had under his service men of all Nations of Europe; and every valiant man
found a place in his favor, but of all other Italians had the preheminency;
he would call that Nation spritly, wary, full of craft; and to this purpose he
was wont to say, the Italians were the only wits, on the other side the
Mountains; to those that would propound Spain unto him for a wise Nation, he
would reply, that the great wisdom wherewith the Spaniards maintained their
greatness, had not its original in Spain, but was learned in Italy; the
Councels of that Monarch being best guided by Spaniards Itallianated, and
Italians Spaniolised. He was of opinion that the quickest spirits were bred up
in the schools of Vice, and accademies of craft. His thoughts were high, his
hopes vast, and his ends strangely profound. He consented not to the war of
Mantua, but dissuaded from it, and made it appear that the unconquered Forces
of the greatest Emperor that for many ages had reigned, and who was victorious
over so many Provinces, ought not to be employed against one of his own
innocent Feudatories. He termed revenge upon inferiors, the advice of weak
spirits; high and magnificke resolutions, the effects of a well qualified
soul. His intention was (as his most intimate friends said) to carry his
Forces against the Ottoman Empire, and he vaunted himself, that he would give
a happy beginning to that war without putting the Emperor to any cost. A high
design, but who shall consider his fortune, the quality and numbers of his
Commanders and Soldiers, will see that no Emperor since Charles the firsts
time had a more flourishing Army, greater store of Soldiers, more able
Commanders, nor more absolute experience: leaving out many who betook
themselves to serve other Princes after his charge was taken from him at the
Diet at Ratisbon, I cannot omit to put you mind of what might be hoped for
from the valor of Godfrey Pappenheim, John Aldringer, Philip Mansfeild, Baron
Cronemberg, Holch, Offcuts, Schamburg, Tiffembec, Festemberg, Ghets, Merodes,
Fuchari, Harnem, D'Harcourt, Asfelt, Benecawsem, and other Dutch Gentlemen,
each of which was worthy to lead an Army, and govern a Province; as likewise
from the virtue, and beyond humane intelligence of a Mathias Gallasso, Ernestus
Montecuculi, Octavius Picolomini, Hanniball Gonsag^, Peter Ferari, James
Stozzi, Ralphe Coll^redo, Marquis Grana, Duke Savell, Chiesa, Isolan^, and
others, all fit for chief Commanders, besides an infinite number of other
hopeful and worthy Colonels.

The Austrian jealousies being buried with Walesteine, the Caesarian Court and
Spanish Counselors began to think of choosing another General. The
Spaniards desired the place of Generalissimo might be conferred upon the King
of Hungary, who they hoped would be advised by them, as also that they do not
willingly submit to be commanded by any of another Nation; contrary and to the
shame of many other Countries, who for base lucre hire themselves out to serve
this or that man, and oft-times bear Arms against their natural Prince: They
did this likewise, for that by his Majesty's marching into the Field, many of
the Nobility of Hungary, Bohemia, and Austria, would be invited to follow him,
and fall to raising of Soldiers. This Election was put to the Vote, and
jointly agreed upon by the whole Council; whereupon great have was made, in
giving a beginning to the business, and in raising Forces as well in all the
Territories belonging unto the Emperor, as also in Italy, so to bring the Army
into a better condition; for the Spaniards who had the whole mannaging of this
affair, were diligent in making their Counsels prove advantageous; and that
they might impede all murmurings which might easily arise from hence, they
purposed to be in such a condition at their appearing in the field, as that
they might do somewhat, which he had not yet done whose ruin they were said
to have been; and therefore they made use of their Forces, and advice, knowing,
that if after Walesteines death the affairs of the Empire should impair, all
the blame should be laid upon them, the people would have occasion to complain
of their behaviors, and be enforced to withdraw themselves to their own
affairs in Germany; that Walesteine would be declared to have been an honest
man, since things are so carried in the world, as men never look to the good
intentions wherewith ought is done, but only to the good or bad effects which
result from thence; and men's ey^ are only set upon such things as are of
profit and advantage, and not upon such from which, though without any fault of
the agents, any harm or prejudice is received

The Baron Offcuts (Serjeant-Major-Generall of the Battle) Colonel Spor, and
other Commanders and Officers, were afterward arrested as accomplices with
Walesteine, who upon hearing, such as were found guilty were punished, and the
innocent set at liberty.

In Slesia this mean while Landsperg which was besieged by the Saxons after
the Imperialists return into Bohemia, being enforced by want of victuals,
threw open the gates to the Enemy, and on the first day of April 1300 Foot and
350 Horse marched out of it. April 1.


Some Troops of the Imperialists kept in Rinfield under the Command of Colonel
Mertij, who scouring the Country, and molesting such as were quartered in those
parts* did not a little indammage them; when Count Philip Ringr^ve thinking to
free himself of this trouble, resolved to bring his Forces before it; which
though there were no great appearance that it would make any great defense, yet
the bodies of valiant Soldiers being that which oft-times makes the trenches,
the Caesarians did here so valiantly withstand the Swedes onset, and the
Governor showed so much resolution, and judgment, as that making use of such
defenses as would have served others rather for a cause of fear then
confidence, he made continually new intrenchments, digging up new grounds,
filling houses up with earth, making Palisadoes, and Wood-workes, where any
breach was made in the Walls by the Swedish Artillery, as when the Enemy thought
to enter the Town, through any such breach, they then found greater
hindrances; for these their inward trenches being furnished with coragious and
valiant Musketeers, with Morter-pieces loaded with bags of Bullets, and with
Pikemen, whilst the Swedes got upon the battered Walls ready to leap into the
Town, they received such salutations of Musket Shot as they were forced to
retreat, and think of some other means how to advance and win ground; in the
which they lost so much time and so many men, as that the Imperialists did
bravely, and as I may say almost beyond example, make their party good from the
4th of April till the 18th of August. At last more overcome by Hunger then by
the Enemy, they capitulated, and Martij marched forth with 400 Foot and 30
Horse, to his unspeakable glory, in having so long defended so weak a hold.

But if the Swedes made these proceedings in Alsatia, the Duke of Bavaria was
not the mean while idle, who having made all requisite Provisions for the
recovery of Ratisbon, by which he was not a little incommodated, he marched
with an Army of 14000 Soldiers toward Strawbing, March 30.
the last day save one of March, against the which he planted his Cannon, and
the Swedish Garrison having for some days made stout resistance, they articled
at last, and threw open their Gates unto his Highness.

On the other side Horn in upper Swabenland having well-weighed the Austrians
proceedings, and knowing that Miminghen would be a place fitting for his
purpose, to make there an Arsenall of Arms, and a Magazine of all fitting
Provisions, that he and his Forces might keep in those parts, he resolved to
try the taking of it; whereupon coming before it, and beginning gallantly to
play upon it with 14 piece of Cannon, the Imperialists under the command of
Count D'Arcus, having courageously maintained the Assault, wanting succor, and
not being above 700 Foot to defend so great a circuit of Wall, were at last
enforced to yield, and upon Articles to open the Gates to the Conqueror.

The Duke of Lorayn who at this time kept in the Vogesan Mountains (which
border upon the uttermost parts of Lorayne toward Burgundy and Germany)
perceiving (by the French-mens surprisall of Lorayne, by their Garrison in
Nancy, by other places possessed by their Forces, and by the King of France's
anger, occasioned by Duke Charles his sinister behavior; and chiefly by
reason of his Brothers marriage, who married the Princess Margueret at
Brussels) his great danger of being totally bereft of his Dukedom, and yet
resolving not to forgo his good Intelligence with the Austrians; desirous
likewise not to see Lorayne fall into the hands of any others then some of his
own family, pitched upon new resolutions, which were very considerable, and
thought to be very opportune, had not he through this vizard looked upon
another object, and higher design.

He therefore resolved to renounce his state to the Cardinal Francis Nicholas
his Brother; for that he being one that had been no ways faulty, might
easily find both pardon and favor from the King. The Cardinal desired the
Kings consent thereunto, who graciously afforded it him: Insomuch, as it was
reported this was done, upon promise he should join in alliance with some such
Prince as the King should approve of, whereupon it was jestingly said, it was
with the Daughter of Charles Duke of Mantua, and that he should really quit all
intelligence with the Spaniards and with Duke Charles, as those who caused
jealousies and suspicions in the French.

But because these pretenses were regulated by the Dukes agreement, and the
Austrians approbation (as it was commonly said) to delay time till fortune
might look favorably upon the affairs of the Empire; and the Spaniards not
permitting that the Cardinal should marry with a Subject that depended upon
France, nor yet that submitting himself to the will of the French, he should
unherd himself from them, and their protection, and the streights wherein they
found themselves being of moment herein, they the more willingly set about it;
So as, that the marriage which the King approved of might not take effect, and
that the new Duke might not forsake the Austrian party, they betook
themselves to new resolutions.

But being the resolutions of Princes, when they are far other then what they
promise, cloth themselves usually with artificial honesty, and go beautified
by some pretenc^ (the true means to cover all breach of word) Duke Charles
wrought the matter so, as that the Duchess his Wife should relinquish all her
claim she had to that Dukedom, as heir to Duke Anthony her Father, and
Charles his Uncle, to her Sister the Princess Claudia; for that the Cardinal
persuaded afterward by reason, that he should not be Duke if the Princess
Claudia, as enfeoffed by the Duchess, were descended out of the house of
Lorayne, that I say, palliating by these excuses which were so advantageous to
this so well woven piece of Art, he might marry this Princess, and render the
French design vain. The Cardinal suffering himself thus unwisely to be
governed by his Brothers interessed counsel, and the like of his friends,
unprovidently, and without the Kings knowledge or consent, resolved upon this
match; which proving a great concernment to the French Commanders and
Governors, who very well knew how ill those Princess and the people of those
parts were inclined to them, they sent speedy news hereof to the Court, and
were advised to increase their guards, and to watch more narrowly over the new
Dukes proceedings.

On the other side, this Duke judging by the new demeanor of the French, and
called on by his own consideration to examine his interests, found that he was
to expect some new accident; he judged it was not safe for him to tarry longer
at Nancy, where he was little better then a prisoner amidst so many guards, nor
yet to quit the State, which by his assistance he hoped to preserve. He chose a
third way believed by himself, and confident to be the most behovefull for the
safety of his own person upon all occasions, and not to give jealousies to the
French; and this was to retire himself to Luneville, a place begirt only with
bare Walls, seated near the Mosell, ten Leagues from Nancy, where the Dukes of
Lorayne have their places of pleasure, and are wont to recreate themselves with
Hunting. Under pretense of such disportment he went thither; and being there,
answer came from France, to the Letters formerly sent, wherein was contained
(as was commonly reported) that the French Commanders should have a diligent
eye to secure the forth-comming of both their Highnesses, that upon the
occasioned appearances, since the Dukes deeds differed from his words, La Motta
should be demanded of him, a strong place, situated upon a Rock: that the
Princess Claudia should be sent to Paris; and that the French might be
permitted to put a Garrison into Luneville, whereby they might keep those
Dukes from parting thence. To perform this, the Marshall Dela Force went to
Luneville, and in seemly and fair manner delivered his Embassy to the Duke;
who surprised with this unexpected accident, granted Luneville, but did
immediately refuse to deliver up La Motta, or to be deprived of his Wife, upon
reasons conformable to the agreement a little before made: But the Marshall
replying, that this was his Commission, and exhorting his Highness to submit
unto the Kings will, the Duke growing pale, and complaining of violence,
replied, he had no other place to retire unto but La Motta; that his Wife was
given unto him for a Companion by God, and that nothing but death should part
him and her; that the King might content himself with being Master of Nancy,
and of all the remainder of his State. To which in conclusion, the Marshall
replied, I ought and will obey my King; your Highness may do well to ask
counsel this night of your pillow; I will send one of his Majesty's Captains
of the Guard to morrow for your answer.

The Marshall this mean while taking his leave, gave order that such Foot and
Horse as were lodged thereabouts, should draw nearer Luneville, to prevent any
thing of noveltie that might ensue if the Duke should escape thence. The next
morning the Captain of the Guard came, accompanied with good store of Horse,
and insisted upon the three demands made by the Marshall, but got no other
answer from the Duke, save only, that if he would accept of Luneville, he
would deliver it over unto him, it being a place of no consideration; but that
he would never forgo La Motta, nor his Wife; and with these words, making his
own Wife, and the Wife of Duke Charles go into the Coach, he himself got on
Horseback, and going from Luneville, went toward Marienville. The Captain
following him, came up unto him, and desired to know whether he intended to
go; to which the Duke replied, whether it shall please God; since I can find
safety in no place; the Captain added, your Highness will please to excuse
me; I only asked it that I might wait upon you; It Is more then needs said the
Duke; I am commanded so to do said the Captain, and then poynting out unto him
the way to Nancy, he said, your Highness must go this way, not that way. The
Duke astonished to see himself thus made prisoner, galloped to the Coach where
the two Duchesses were, and crying out aloud, that they were betrayed, broke
out into such expressions against the French Ministers of State, as the
Captain was enforced to reprehend him, and to wish him to be more advised in
his speeches. The Duke was hush, and not able to say a word, went to Nancy:
where new Guards being put into the Castle, and all the Avenues being well
looked unto, though the French would not own this as restraint, the desires
concerning his Wife and Le Motta, were again renewed; the which the Duke still
denying, the French were much perplexed what to do, and the Duke fell upon a
thousand several imaginations; when news came from all parts, that the King
being highly offended with him, for his aforesaid actions, was resolved to have
him forthcomming, since his words and actions did not correspond. The Duke
fearing to incur further displeasure, knowing he could not by any other
Treaty withdraw himself from the imminent danger which hung over him,
resolved to save himself and his Duchess; and losing his State, to enjoy at
least that liberty which he held deerer then Kingdoms. He therefore
acquainted Monsieur Pollion, an ancient servant of his, and one in whom he much
confided, with this his intention; and discoursing how they might make an
escape, they at last agreed, that the said Pollion, under pretense of Hunting,
should send some Horses, Hounds, and Hunts-men, toward those parts which lead
into Burgundy, and that these being left in several places upon the way should
wait for their coming; but all the difficulty lay in their getting out of the
Castle, in the which, to boot with the other Guards at the Gates, a hundred
Harguebuziers waited in the outward rooms and lodgings; and especially every
night and morning the Sergeant Major of the City, under pretense of visiting
their Highnesses, came to see whether they were there or no, so as their
getting thence would prove a hard matter; They therefore did herein employ
their wits; and at last they light upon a secret pair of stairs, which
opening from the Duchesses lodging landed upon the ground, and from thence the
way lay through a little gate into the old City, by which they thought to
escape: but there was at the foot of this staircase, a house wherein some of
the French Guard lay; and the little gate being chained up with great Irons
chains, provided of purpose by the French, and no passage being to be had
without the breaking thereof, Monsieur D'Pollion advised hereupon with a very
skillful Smith, with whom he prevailed so far as to make him desirous his
Master might escape. So as the appointment being made between them, and the
Duke calling for Monsieur D'Morisse, a Servant of his, in whom he much trusted,
and to whom he imparted the business, they consulted together how they might
effect their desires.

They agreed that the Smith being let into the Chamber apparrelled like a
Gentleman, should break open the Gate before the time of going to bed, that
the Duchess should depart in a Pages habit, and that the Duke coming down
the said stairs by night should get to Monsieur Pollions house, where course
should be taken for their getting out of Town. On the last of March the Smith
came into the Chamber and hid himself underneath the Dukes bed, the Sergeant
Major had according to his custom given good night unto their Highnesses, when
Monsieur De Pollion having a Page before him with a Torch lighted in his hand
entered the Castle, and came into the Duchesses Chamber who was laid in her bed,
and streightway putting on the Pages apparel, took the same Torch in her
hand and went before Monsieur Pollion out of the Castle, the Guards suspecting
nothing: the Duke after midnight descended the stairs with his shoes off, and
without any trouble past through the Guards chamber, and got also out of the
Castle; for the Soldiers, who suspected nothing, were all asleep; and when he
was come to Monsieur Pollion's house, that they might with more safety get out
of the City, he and the Duchess clothed themselves like two Gardiners, who
are wont to carry dung out of the City, to such Gardens as lie about Nancy; and
having so besmeared their faces, as that they rather looked like Colliers then
Princes, the next morning at the opening of the Gates, with each of them a
basket of dung upon their Shoulders, they passed freely out of the City.
Monsieur Pollion who under pretense of hunting (as has been said) was to go
out, got into his Coach with six Horses soon after the Duke and Duches were
gone, and without giving any the least suspicion, went out of the City; for the
Guards having looked into his Coach suffered him to pass as they had used to
do. The Duke and Duchess this mean while in their counterfeit apparel
walked apace, and were got a good way off the City, but were so weary by reason
of their burdens and their walking on foot, which they were not accustomed to
do, as that the afflicted Duchess was ready to fall upon the ground, and the
Duke stood weeping to see the poor Lady brought to such a condition; when the
Coach coming up to them they began to take comfort, threw away their baskets,
and got readily into the Coach, and made what have they could to the place
appointed, where their horses staid for them; where immediately getting upon
fresh horses, they arrived happily in the French Contee and came to Bisanzon,
where they rested themselves in Monsieur Morisse his house, after their
wearysome journey.

The next morning the Sergeant Major came according to his custom to give
their Highness a good morrow, when the doore-keeper stepped unto him, and
desired him to forbear a little for that his Highness was not well; the other
was content, but returned again some two hours after; the doore-keeper would
not yet open the door unto him, excusing himself that he had received such
command from the Duke his Master: the Serjeant-Major threatened then to beat
open the door; to whom the other answered he had no reason to do so; and said
it was a shame, that a poor Prince should not be suffered to sleep as long as
he would, and did thus a while entertain him; but not knowing that they were
gone out of their beds, contrary to their customs at other times, he resolved
to knock at the door, and hearing no answer made he forced it open, and being
entered into the chamber seeing no body there, and finding the staire door
broken open, he found what the matter was, and much incensed, sent many
Horsemen abroad in pursuit of them, who rid many Leagues to little purpose.

These Princes having staid some days at Bisanzon where they refresht
themselves after their sufferings, and laying aside their gardiners weeds, they
went from thence and took their way toward Savoy, where, by order from that
Duke, they were feasted, presented, and entertained like Princes, though the
Ambassador of France (as it was reported) desired they might be there
detained. From thence they went to Milan, where they were civilly and
honorably entertained by the Infanta; and being furnished with Moneys and all
things requisite, they went to reside at Florence, and in this case remained
the begun misfortunes of that house; which as formerly it had vaunted it self
to be envied for its happiness, appeared now to be prosecuted by fortune as
much as any other whatsoever. And by this vicissitude it is proved how unstable
humane constancy is, how flattering hope is false, and what folly is in the
best wits.

The chief French Commanders who were quartered every where in that Dukedom,
upon the news hereof flockt to Nancy; news was sent to the King; The Marshall
de la Force was this mean while drawing near to la Motta to force the Garrison
thereof to yield, if he should not obtain it by Commission from the Duke; when
hearing what had happened, he delayed not to come before it, to raise his
batteries, April 5.
and on the fifth of April began to play upon the Town, wherein the Baron
d'Ische commanded in Chief, a valiant Gentleman, and who playing reciprocally
upon the French, showed he had no mind to yield the Town.

Prince Thomas was at this time employed in the government of Cambray and
Savoy, who incited by his sprightly courage, thinking that his Martial Genius
would be suffocated by keeping quiet within the precincts of those Mountains,
whilst War was waged in all parts else; and remembering that nothing does more
prejudice a lively Prince then idleness, resolved to betake himself to some
employment wherein he might exercise his valor; whereupon since the Spaniards,
who exceedingly desire to have the Princes of Italy their stipendaries, as well
to draw them to side with them, as to make their service seem the more
honorable, had often times invited him to take upon him the place of his late
Brother Prince Philiberto, or else the government of the Flanders Forces, he
resolved at last to accept of their offer. He therefore consented to take upon
him that employment, left Cambray, and passing into Burgundy, went from thence
to Brussels, having sent his Wife the Princess of Corigniano together with his
Children to Milan.

This Princes sudden departure afforded matter of discourse to the curiosity
of our newes-mongers; some would have it that he had thus secretly absented
himself out of some private distate he had taken at the Duke his Brother;
others thought he thu^ endeavored to better his condition, invited thereunto
by glory, and desire to change the government of Savoy, for that of Flanders;
others that were more speculative, would not stick to say that this was done
by the privity of the Duke his Brother, who was thought by many, that though he
outwardly appeared to be well affected to the French, yet that inwardly he
depended upon the Spanish party, so as they thought this his departure was not
without the consent of his Brother, but covertly cloaked, lest he might cause
jealousy in the French, who were ready openly to declare themselves against
the Spaniards.

The Austrians as well in Vienna, as in all other places, were this mean while
diligent in providing for the present emergencies, and more particularly the
Spaniards used all possible means to provide for all necessaries for the
Field, and they employed all their endeavors, that since the place of
Generalissimo, which was conferred upon the King of Hungary, concerned them in
reputation, he might perform some notable piece of service. To this purpose
some Regiments commanded by Colloredo were made to advance toward Slesia,
where having possessed themselves of a great part of the Country they recovered
the City and Castle of Olss, situated in a large plain between the Oder and
the Bartsch, begirt about with Ditches and Walls; it made no defense but yielded
upon discretion; and the Garrison being 500 Soldiers, took service under the
Emperors Colors. And for that the business of Ratisbon was that which most
troubled the Spaniards, they resolved to endeavor the recovery thereof, as well
that they might satisfy the Duke of Bavaria, as likewise to honest their own
Counsels; for they knew the name of this City was famous, for the many Dyets
had been held therein, and therefore the taking of it would sound well in the
peoples ears, and would win reputation to the forces of a King, who would not
be much cried-up, should he meet with misfortune at the first entrance into
his government. Besides they thought the enterprise would not be very
difficult, the Town being unprovided of necessaries, the Country and strong
Holds round about it possessed by Romanists, and it not being in a Condition to
resist an Army, since it was not perfectly and according to the rules of
Fortification walled about or defended, nor could be succored by the Swedes
without evident danger, difficulty and disadvantage. All requisite preparations
were made in Austria, as also in all other Provinces belonging to the Emperor
and his friends, to effect so important a business, wherein so much of
reputation lay, and so much the rather for that it seemed a shameful thing to
every body, that a place not very strong, and in the heart of the Romanists
Territories, should have it in a Garrison of such as were of a repugnant
belief.

The Landgrave of Hessen, who was with his Army as this time about Hidelsh^ime,
did draw nearer unto it. And the loss of this place being like to prove a
great blow to the Romanists, the Elector of Coln persuaded Benecawsem, who was
Marshall of the Field, to succor it by all means possible; the which (though
he knew it would be a difficult matter) he endeavored, but to no purpose, for
he was beaten back by the Swedes with some loss in his Rear: so as the
besieged, seeing themselves but in a sad condition, failing of their expected
succor, and thinking that they had done all that their honor did oblige them
unto, they soon after delivered up that good City upon honorable conditions,
into the hands of the Landsgraves Commanders, marching forth with flying
Colors, Drums beating, two piece of Cannon, 1700 Foot, and 350 Horse.

The delay of Miminghen had opened the passages of Swabenland, and secured the
Swedes behind on that part. But Horn, who knew it would be hard for him to
keep in that Country, if he should not first make himself Master of some
place upon the Lake of Constantz, and Lindaw being a place not to be then
endeavored by reason of the situation and the strength thereof, it being well
guarded and much valued by the Austrians; and finding Constantz impossible to
be taken, he thought upon the taking of Vberlinghen, which though there were
diverse circumstances which would render it hard to be taken, notwithstanding,
invited by some intelligence he held with some of the Protestant inhabitants,
and comforted by hope, which makes men careful in what they go about, he
resolved to try his fortune.

He to this purpose, moved with his Army from their several quarters, and
marched thitherward, came with 8000 fighting men and 12 piece of Cannon before
the Town, and within a few days made his approaches to the Ditch and Walls;
the Town, though it were only surrounded with a single Ditch and Towers,
after the ancient manner, and some Trenches made where it was weakest, resolved
notwithstanding to defend it self. The Inhabitants did therefore make Rampires
of earth against the Walls, the Gates, and such Towers as they thought weakest,
made places to retreat unto, cut off their streets, closing them up with strong
Trenches and Pallizadoes, and began with their Cannon and Musket Shot to
re-salute the Swedish Camp. Horn having played incessantly upon the Town with
his Cannon for some days space, and a sufficient breach being made, he
commanded an assault to be given, as was done with much courage and great force
by the Scots under Ruthens command, but with no less valor and boldness
repulsed by the defendants, and some fresh supplies that were come in unto
their succor: yet for all this Horn altered not his mind, but streightened the
Town every hour more and more, throwing down the Walls, and firing the
houses with Grenades, artificial fires, and with the Cannon; but the
besiegeds diligence increasing as did the Swedes offenses, Horns confidence
began to cool; whereupon (perceiving that the difficulty grew every day
greater, that his men grew less, and that the Garrison in the Town was
increased by daily succors which were by the Lake sent in) his wisdom
prevailed over his passion, and that he might not from a General of an Army,
become but the Commander of some few Troops, he raised his siege and returned
to his quarters. But because the difficulty of these proceedings arose from
the Lake, which afforded means of succor to the Towns built thereupon, and
it proving unpossible to take any one of them without cutting off the passage
thereunto by water, he thought the taking of Bucorne would be a good means to
effect this, it being a walled Town, upon the Banks of the Lake, between
Vberlinghen and Lindaw; a fit place to build Boats, and to scour those Rivers:
He therefore rising from before Vberlinghen, turned thitherwards, and without
any obstacle took the Town, and gave present directions for the so fortifying
it, as that it might be a safe station; and gave likewise order for the
building of two small men of War, which might serve to make excursions upon
the Lake.

All things necessary for their going into the Field being prepared in Austria
and in Bavaria, the Imperialists put themselves in order, and prepared to
march: The King of Hungary parted from Vienna, accompanied with a considerable
number of Nobility, and came within a few days to Prage, where mustering his
Army, he found therein about 30000 fighting men; and having weighed several
expedient means how to regaine that place, the loss whereof so much molested
all those people, he left Prage and marched toward Pilsen about the 20th of
May; May 20.
but the Duke of Saxony, who had given a Rendezvous to all his Forces about
Turgaw, had sent 12 Regiments toward the Frontiers of Bohemia, so to raise
jealousies in the Imperialists who were quartered in that Kingdom and if not
to divert the taking of Ratisbon, at least to dismember the Austrian Army, in
obliging it to divide it self, that so he might afford more way for Waymer and
Horn to incampe against them: and just so it fell out; for that he might not
leave that Kingdom unprovided for, the King left Collorado there with 10000
Soldiers, and his Majesty, with the rest of the Army, leaving Pilsen, went
toward the Palatinate; having first made very good appointment, and taken good
order with the Duke of Bavaria and Aldringer, that they likewise should advance
against Ratisbon on the other side.

The great preparations which were made in all parts of Germany, and in the
Austrian Dominions, by the wisdom and gold of Spain, and on the contrary
side, the daily declining of the Protestant and Swedish Forces after the loss
of their King, the chief heads and Governors whereof, not caring by new
Levyes to recruit their shrunk Companies, but only looking after their own
particular profit and advantage, filled Oxesterne with many thoughts, who as
Director of all their affairs, had the whole weight lying upon his wisdom;
and wit availing but little where force is wanting, nor such fruitful actions
being to be hoped for from Commanders interessed in their particular gain, as
are produced by great and magnanimous hearts; nor yet the decaying
Contributions being sufficient to satisfy the Soldiers pretenses, who not
having wherewithal to answer their ill-taught wills as formerly, by reason of
the Countries being impoverished, demanded pay; Oxesterne resolved forthwith to
send his Son Ambassador to Holland, and into England, as well to demand
assistance in money, men, and advice, as also their interposition with the King
of France, for by waging War with the Spaniards in Italy and Flaunders, the
succors which were expected from those Provinces in Germany being detained for
their own defense, the Protestant Forces might more boldly proceed in the
Austrian Territories.

The Ambassador was courteously received by the States, and sent away, if not
fully satisfied in his desires, at least comforted with great hopes. From
thence he went for England; where, by His Majesty of England, he was nobly
entertained as the Son of Oxesterne; but not bringing any Letters with him
from the Queen of Swethland, and the English not knowing that Oxesterne had
any authority to Create Ambassadors, he was refused audience as an
Ambassador* wherewithal his Father, who was then at Franckfort, being
suddenly acquainted, he being a man greatly esteemed of, and of high pretenses,
was thereat scandalized, and without more ado sent for his Son back, and
seemed nor to be much satisfied with the English, nor with his fruitless
Embassy. Hereupon the Deputies of the Confederate Circuits were speedily
summoned to Franckfort, to consult how they might best manage the War, and
to put on such resolutions as might be most adequate to the present imminencies.

Hidelsheim being surrendered (as has been said) to the Landgrave of Hessen,
he, after the taking thereof, joined with George Duke of Lunenberg, who was
quartered in Westfalia, with a strength of men to about 5000 Foot and 2000
Horse; they jointly went toward Scheld, a Town between Gostar and
Hidelsheim, the Garrison whereof being weak, as not amounting to above 600
Foot, not able to contest against a great Body of Soldiers provided with all
necessaries, the Commander foreseeing the Enemies approach thought best to
quit the place, and took away with him the ablest Citizens that he might get
Contribution from them; then went to Wolfembuttell a considerable strength, the
preservation whereof as it was greatly endeavored by the Austrians, so did
this Governor bend all his thoughts upon the maintaining of it, and therefore
this Garrison was no little comfort to him, though his Soldiers got not all
safe thither; for being overtaken in this their march by the Swedish Horse, who
pursued them closely, about 40 of them were taken prisoners and cut off.

Waymer, who was at this time quartered with his Forces about Newmarch in the
upper Palatinate, had an eye to the Imperialists proceedings, and was informed,
that the Roman Catholic Army was drawing up toward him, and that on the
other side the Bavarians were not far from Ratisbon; therefore that he might
endeavor as much as in him lay to hinder these advancements, he rose from the
place aforesaid, and encamped himself between Ratisbon and Amber, that he
might be the nearer to bring succor to that City, in the loss whereof he
shared deeper then any other, as he had partaken of much glory in the taking of
it.

The French Forces being come before La Motta, the Garrison whereof did
gallantly defend themselves, the Marshall Dela Force thought it requisite to
possess himself of Busch, a strong hold built on a Rock, upon the Frontiers
of Germany, between the Palatinate and Alsatia, yet kept by the Lorayners
under the Command of Count Tumeius, where bringing their Cannon, and not well
able to raise their Batteries, yet the difficulties of nature being overcome by
humane industry, they drew up six piece of Cannon upon the ascent of the
Mountain, wherewithal they began to play upon the Walls, from which the
Lorayners, assisted by the unaccessiblenesse of their Situation, did constantly
defend themselves, though the not coming of their expected succor did much
diminish that courage which uses to be comforted through such hopes.

THe Spaniards constant undauntednesse, which to the torrent of adversity
opposes the strong banks of wisdom and sagacity, no ways affrighted
neither at the Protestants proceedings, nor the preparation of the French, nor
yet at their own bad successes, but resting firm in their usual courage, did
not only endeavor to recruit their lessened Forces in Germany, and all other
the Emperors Territories, but also by their civil comportments to captivat
that affection which their excessive greatness had lost them in the opinions
of lesser Potentates. The most illustrious Infanta, through the magnifick
demonstration shown in Italy of his great spirit, had not only brought under
his pay valiant Commanders, and a strength of 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse, but
approving himself worthy to be Brother to so great a Monarch, having already
much comforted his Subjects, satisfied strangers, and moderated the evil
opinions of such as were enemies to Spain, had given no small hopes in the
flourishing Springtime of his youth and government, of what fruits were to be
expected from him in the Autumn of his excellent inclination. He was now
ready to pass over the Mountains, and to go for Flanders, solicited
thereunto by the great necessity that those Provinces stood in of a Prince of
the Austrian blood, when Colloredo who was left in Bohemia by the King of
Hungary, past into Slesia with 82 Companies of Foot and 4 Regiments of Horse,
and came near to Lignitz, a Town in the same Province, situated upon the banks
of Ratsbach: Which when Harnem understood, who was upon his march thitherward,
being come with his Saxon Army to the places adjacent to that City, and being
informed that the Imperialists kept thereabouts in Battaile-array, he resolved
to set upon them before they should be encouraged by any fortunat success; he
therefore came forward on the 13th of May in handsome order, May 13.
with 6 Battaglions of Foot, and 4 Squadrons of Horse in his Vanguard, two
other Bodies of Foot in his Rear, and 6 Squadrons of Horse for a reserve at the
back of the Foot, and 14 piece of Cannon in the forefront of the Army; he set
upon the Imperialists, who keeping themselves close together, resolved not to
turn their backs, though a very great wind which blew full in their faces
seemed to threaten them with no small harm. About three hours after
Sunrising the Horse on both sides began to skirmish, the Foot-Battaglions
saluting each other alternatly with Musket Shot; at last the bodies of both
Armies gave together, where after three hours fight maintained with equal
valor on both sides, the Imperialists wearied with their great labor and
pains, choked up with smoke and wind, and being set on a new by some fresh
Troops led on by Harnem and Tuball, began to face about and betake themselves
to their heels, and not being able to be stopped in their flight, for any
means Colloredo and the other Commanders could use, they were routed; about
1000 of them were slain and taken prisoners, some Baggage and field Carriages
were lost, and the rest recovered Lignitz, where under the favor and
protection of the Cannon of those Walls they saved themselves from a greater
defeat, which in another place they could not have evaded

May 20.
Harnem encouraged by this prosperous success, marched the 20th of the same
month toward Franckfort upon Oder, where making his approaches and planting
his Cannon, though the Garrison made some days defense, yet by reason of the
ill fortune in the late Battle, dispairing of succor, and that City being in
the very center of the Territories possessed by the Protestants, and sorely
beset, honorable conditions being granted, on the 3 of June about 700 Foot and
200 Horse marched out of the Town, too small a number to defend so great a
place.

By this time the Bavarians were on their side come within sight of Ratisbon,
and the King of Hungary appeared likewise on the other side; Waymer who was
much troubled that so famous a purchase which he to his great renown had won
should be lost, passing over the Danube at Kelchaine a place above Ratisbon
near to the said River entered the City, and marching with wonderful admiration
in the sight of the Enemies whole Army, he put thereinto a recruit of about a
thousand Soldiers and some barrels of Powder. But the Imperialists setting
upon the Town on all sides, Waymer presently advertised Horn thereof, and
desired that he would come and join Forces with him, that they might defend
that City; the loss whereof would much impair the fame and honor of the
Swedish Forces, lessen their credit with the rest of their confederates, and
greatly encourage the Enemy.

Horn having first put Garrisons into such places as he had taken in
Swabenland, and particularly in Bucorne went toward Auspurg; and in his
coming to Leech, he understood that La^shut, a strong and considerable place,
being seated upon the Iser in the midst of Bavaria, was unprovided of things
necessary for the defense thereof; and this being a place of importance for the
relief of Ratisbon, though he were by reduplicated letters, earnestly desired
by Waymer to come and join with him; yet wisely considering, that by such a
diversion he might cause much trouble to the people of Bavaria, and that it
was more expedient to let the Imperialists still go on in losing of their men
in the taking of Ratisbon, where daily they lost the flower of their Army; he
resolved by temporising not to let slip the opportunity of taking Lanshut he
therefore marched thitherward with an Army con^isting of 6000 Foot and 4000
Horse; with which Waymer not being well pleased, it might from his speeches be
gathered that he thought Horn did envy his valor, being displeased at Waymers
being made General. That he did not join Forces with him, because he could
not obey him; that he intended by the taking of Lunshut to inhaunce his own
glory, and by the loss of Ratisbon to obscure his.

Duke Waymer, and Count Cratz, (who being fled some months before from
Iugulstat, was made master of the Field in the Swedish Army, as has been said)
that they might divert the Imperialists from Ratisbon, set down before
Fortheime; where having spent some time to little purpose, and yet desirous to
succor Ratisbon by diversion, Waymer left the aforesaid Cratz with 5000
fighting men before Fortheime, and returned himself to his first station, that
he might join with Horn, and jointly raise the Imperialists.

Harnem having received a recruit of 5 Regiments, which were sent him into
Slesia from Bannier, passed with his Army toward Olaw, the Governor whereof
finding himself not able to resist the Enemy, wanting sufficient Garrison to
maintain rampired Walls, set fire on the City, and betook himself to the
Castle; wherein being besieged, and not receiving any succor, after 20 days
suffering he submitted to the discretion of the besiegers.

The Siege of Ratisbon continued, against the which the Imperialists thundered
Cannon-shot, hailed Musket-bullets, and used Grenades, and other artificial
fires, to effect their desires; wherein though they found much more of
difficulty, then they at first imagined, yet did not they quite lay aside their
hopes; but this being the first enterprise undertaken by an Army commanded by a
King in person, who was come into the field with so great Forces, wherein if he
should not prevail, all his credit would be lost, and the Enemy inheartned,
they employed all their might to overcome whatsoever difficulties. The Swedes
and Inhabitants were no less vigilant in defending themselves with equal
valor, molesting the Imperialists with continual Sallies, and hindering their
approaches by great and small shot, wherewithal many were slain; for the
besieged not having their walls rampired whereby to resist the Enemies brisk
Assaults, it behoved them by their frequent shooting to keep them aloof off;
the which was done with much diligence, as that through the smoke and fire of
Cannon shot, the Town seemed to be all on fire; when Aldringer by order from
the King went with 15 Regiments to succor Lanshut, which was straightly beset
by Horn; and as he thought to enter in by one Gate, the Swedes being let in by
the other, (whilst he was upon the Bridge, ready to enter the Town,) he was
slain with a Musket-bullet; not without suspicion that this had happened unto
him from his own side, in revenge of some injuries done unto them; for such
was his severity, as he was rather feared then beloved by the Soldier.

Amongst other Sallies the Swedes made one gallant one on the Eleventh of June,
June 11.
wherein withstood by the Imperialists, (who were led on by their chief
Commanders) though they were feign to give back, yet did they much indammage
the Caesarians, and slew some Gentlemen of good estimation, amongst which
Colonel Prainer, whose loss was very considerable; for he was a Dutch
Gentleman, for his worth very much beloved both by the Emperor and King, and
for his valor in Military affairs well esteemed of by the Soldiers.

Aldringer being slain, at whose death not only the Emperor but the Duke of
Bavaria, and all the Commanders of the A^my were very much grieved, Colonel
John Were was chosen to succeed in his place, a Soldier of known valor and
great experience; this man was sent with some Regiments toward Rain to recruit
those Troops which were gone with Aldringer to succor Lanshut; and meeting
with some Swedish Companies which scoured those neighboring parts, he fought
with them, and brought away many prisoners, some Cornets of Horse, and defeated
above 500 of Horse Soldiers, by which good success he did not only purchase
the good will of the King of Hungary, but of the Duke of Bavaria, and every
other Commander; and soon opened the way to have a greater valuation put upon
him.

But for that to proceed further on, and to bury Aldringers conditions in
silence, would not only be an injury to his desert, but offend the curiosity
of him that reads, I will make the memory of his fame survive his life. He was
a native of Lucemberg, of mean birth, having past his childhood, moved
thereunto by his natural genius and sprightly desire, he put himself in
service with some Noblemen who traveled into France to study; whereunto he
likewise applied himself, and became the Master of many Languages, and
intelligent in many affairs; from thence, passing into Italy, he was
entertained for Auditor by Count Madrucci, from thence he went to Trent, and by
his Pen wrought himself into the Prince his Auditory; where having studied a
while, at last, were it either his fortune, or by reason of the malignitie of
the times, he was envyed by many, and being much scandalized with the actions
of some of his Colleagues, he resolved to be gonne, and not certain what
course to take, he went toward Inspruch, resolving to follow the occupation
that he should first meet withal.

Before he came to the Bridge of Lenis, he met with a Soldier of Milan, who
coming from Germany into his own Country, and speaking with him concerning
the Soldiers craft, he resolved to take it upon him; he therefore received pay
of the Emperor, and at first trayled a Pike, shortly after he got a Halbert,
and won the love of his Captain and all his fellow Soldiers: for being good
at his Pen, the casting up of the accounts of that Company, and the answering
of such Letters as were sent to his Captain were recommended to his charge;
and behaving himself still worthily in this place, and his Captain, through
the assistance he received from Aldringers wisdom, being made Sergeant Major,
and his Lieutenant Captain in his place, Aldringer was made Lieutenant with
the applause of all the Officers and Soldiers: in which place he continued to
give signs of his more then common understanding. He had the keeping of a
place in the upper Palatinate not far from Egra, committed to his charge, by
which the Protestant Army was to pass, which with bare 50 men, by the means
of barricadoed Trenches, and Pallizadoes of great interlaced Trees, he so
gallantly maintained against the Enemies whole Army, without any other succor,
as that (to the fame of his wisdom) he purchased the addition of being held
greatly valiant.

Thus in a short space of time he was much desired by many Colonells, and had
offers made him of diverse Companies. Being (at the instance of his maintainer)
persuaded to comply with the Archbishop of Salsbergs Nephew (a young man, who
needed such an instructor) he, by his Soldiery and by his Learning, did so
much insinuate himself into the good will of that Colonel and his associates,
as that Aldringer, making him seem gray headed for wisdom, who was but
green in years, he thought he could recompense him with no meaner a reward
then, in default of his Sergeant Major, to confer that place upon him. Being
raised to a place of this employment, and thereby having occasion to be known
to the Generals, and to negotiate sometimes with one, sometimes with another
of them, he so won upon the good likings of every one, as that he got the
repute of being a better Soldier then any one that did officiate that charge:
and being favored by Fortune, and confirmed in every ones good liking, he was
raised to the degree of a Lieutenant Colonel, and from thence to be a Colonel;
still refining his judgment by the experience and mannaging of Martial
affairs, till he was found worthy to succeed to the command of the Emperors
Forces before Mantua; where commanding over the body of an Army, he executed
the authority of a General, though not under that Title.

Aldringer was of a lively spirit, of mature wisdom, of a refined
understanding, and of a valor levelled to enterprises. His Counsels were
accompanied with the freedom of Voice, with past examples, and foresight of
the future, in so much as in all Consultations held, they were preferred before
the advice of any others. The informations of his Pen proportionably displayed,
opened the gates to capacity, enlightened the understanding to make resolves,
and were most gratifying to the curiosity of his Master, and Masters Officers;
the diverse Countries he had been verst in, the diverse maxims he had observed,
the inclinations of many people traced out by him, made him so wary in all his
actions, as no Italianised Spaniard could out do him. He was in ^ine grown to
so great a hight of perfection, in what belonged to a valiant, wise, and
experienced Commander, as there was nothing more to be desired in him, had he
not been so much swaide by avarice and severitie. He was so great a husband,
as that he was as much intent to the service of his Prince, as to his own
particular interest; uncompassionate toward the Subject, being excessive in
laying on Contributions; very straight-handed in letting the Soldier partake
thereof, or in bearing with them, so as he was not much beloved by them; his
austeritie in this kind, particularly at Mantua (where it is reported he got
such spoil and booty, as that none of Caesar's Commanders ever parted from
thence with greater riches) made him hateful to the people, not beloved by the
Soldier, and contumacious toward God Almighty. And this did presage that the
promoters of that War would make good the proverb, That riches ill got are
not usually long enjoyed.

Whilst the Imperialists were busy in besieging of Ratisbon, and that with
equal constancy, and reciprocal offense and fighting, the one endeavored the
taking, the other the defending of that place; the Saxons taking their
advantage at the absence of those Forces out of Slesia, by which they were
formerly held in great fear, lest they might all have jointly bent their
course upon their state, and Misnia, (as had been oft-times discoursed of in
the Imperial Council) made diverse advancements in those parts, for to boot
with having given the Imperialists a great blow near Lignitz as has been
said, they likewise took Crossen and Glogaw; the Garrisons whereof were not in
condition to defend themselves without present succor, nor to maintain those
holds straightened on all sides by the frequent quartering of the Enemy.

The passage of Iser being ope^ed unto the Swedes, by the taking of Landshut,
they accosted Alcka, watered by the Par, a place of no great consideration,
begirt only with bare Walls, without Rampires or defense: some Bavarians
betaking themselves to defend it, thought the Swedes could not keep long
before it, the maine body of the Romanists not being far from thence, but not
able to resist a fair assault, which the Enemy desirous of booty made, the
Town was taken and sacked. After which, Horn keeping still in Bavaria, pursued
in making inrodes, and taking of such places as could make no resistance; and
though he was informed by reiterated Letters from Waymer, how great the
necessity was that he should come toward Dunawert and join with him, that so
both of them might endeavor to succor Ratisbon, yet would he not budge a
foot, but seemed as if he slighted his counsel; for Horn being of a contrary
opinion, and not minding to hazard his men in a battle against the fresh and
numerous Army, conceived, that Waymer was rather to come and join with him,
that they might with a brave and complete Army proceed on to prejudice Bavaria
(by which diversion, he pretended either to get more then the Imperialists
should do by the getting of Ratisbon) or else to necessitate them to come and
defend their own; and consequently to abandon the Town, or at least to weaken
the Siege thereof: the which he conceived feacible, since it was likely the
Duke of Bavaria for the getting of Ratisbon would not suffer his own state to
be lost, and his Subjects to be undone; and the Town was so well victualled,
as if it were not the streightlier besieged it might hold out for six months.
But Waymer, who was very loath to lose this place, it being a seat of great
consequence, as well for the interest of the Crown of Swethland, as for the
reputation of their Forces; for if this place should be lost, whilst they and
their Armies stood looking on, to boot with the fear, which would be thereby
caused in other Towns recommended to his charge, they should much lessen the
valuation which was yet put upon them and their Arms; and it being natural to
all men to love their own actions best, and which have their original from
them, as fathers do their children, Waymer, who had had the chief hand in
taking this Town, and who desired the preservation thereof, as the issue of
his valor, not dreaming of any other object but how to relieve it, thought all
the reasons alleged by Horn, and such Captains as adhered unto him,
invallid. And rather blinded by affection of desire, then illuminated by
military reason, he was resolute in his opinion, that they were to employ all
their skill and industry to make the King of Hungary fail in his first
enterprise: for the Swedes, together with their friends and confidents, being
hereby encouraged, it would be a cooling card to the Imperialists in their
subsequent proceedings. And if this place should be by the Swedes preserved, to
boot with the good success that they might build hereupon, it might be added
that the Austrians would grow so to distrust the Spaniards, being those who
persuaded to the taking of a Town weakly walled, and in the heart of their
own dominions, and not succeeding therein, as they would have but small hopes to
take places better fortified, by which, all those bad effects would be
produced, as usually are occasioned by a conceit taken by the common people and
Soldiers. He therefore resolved by all means to relieve it. Horn, who
maturely foresaw the event which might ensue, and who was one that desired
rather to govern his actions with advisednesse then rash violence, opposed
Waymers opinion again, who thought it better to hazard a danger wherein was
hope, then to enjoy advantage wherein was fear. From hence, not only
disagreement in Counsels began to arise between these two Generals, but
particular emulation and distastes; whence proceeded those subsequent sinister
events, which the Austrians patiently and wisely suffering to grow ripe,
gathered thence such fruits as is the usual product of such disparitie.

Alcha being surrendered, Horn came to Dunawert, and that he might not more
exasperate Waymer (who being General, Horn was very much troubled he could
not join with him in opinion) he joined with him, who was already come thither
with his Forces, that he might adhere to Horns counsel, if he could not bring
Horn to agree with him in the relieving of Ratisbon.

They held diverse Counsels of War at Dunawert, wherein the present
emergencies being wisely weighed, the major part were of opinion, that to
undertake the relief would be a hazardous and rash action; so much the rather,
for that the Swedish Army was much inferior to the Imperialists, being in all
hardly 16000 fighting men; for Cratz (as has been said) stayed before Fortheim;
and the Ringrave, who had received orders to come from Alsatia, and bring his
men, which were about 6000 to strengthen the Swedish Army, delayed his going,
for he did not greatly desire to join with Waymer, under whose command he
pretended not to be. It was notwithstanding resolved, that they should molest
the Imperialists as much as they were able, by hindering them in foraging, by
cutting off their Victuals, and keeping them from advancing to other
enterprises, till such time as being hindered by continual molestations, they
might light upon some advantageous time to try the fortune of a battle, and
likewise expect the Saxons fortunate proceedings, who being gotten almost to
Prague, if they should take that City, it would infuse much terror into the
people of that Kingdom, and peradventure would make the Imperialists remove
from before Ratisbon, and bring them to look unto the safety of Bohemia, the
preservation whereof they ought with all diligence to be careful of, as well
for their own interests as for the honor of their Arms.

The Austrians considering how the Saxons proceeded in Slesia, and the
advancements they had made in Bohemia, some Regiments were sent by the King of
Hungary to defend Prague, and to recruit Colloredo, whose Army by reason of
continual action was much diminished. And because Peace with that Elector was
still much desired by the Austrians, (knowing it would be a hard matter to
proceed against the Swedes, who were very strong of themselves, and fomented by
that union of the Protestants and other Princes, if Saxony should be still
their Enemy, to wait upon whose Army half the Imperialists Forces were
necessitated to be employed) Count Tantmiscorfe, the Emperors chief
Counselor, was again sent to Luitmeritz, with new pretenses: But the Elector
persisting still in his high demands, no good came of it; so as this treaty
breaking off, and Harnem joining with some Swedish Regiments, they together
with Luitmeritz took Fridland, and Falchenberg, places notwithstanding of no
great moment, so as Colonel Pech had order to depart from the Caesarian Camp,
that he might join with Colloredo, who was encamped about Colts, that so they
might both of them jointly oppose the Enemies designs against Bohemia.

The Imperialists this mean while did their utmost to put an end to the taking
of Ratisbon, and though the besieged defended themselves with unexpressible
valor, and of unheard of opposition, (insomuch as many of the Romanists were
afraid they should never compass their desired end) yet glory being that which
sweetens all difficulties, the Imperialists egged on by the presence of the
King himself, who in his own person, amidst the hail of Musket Shot,
encouraged them, did with so much violence, and obstinate valor set upon Off,
a Borough without the City, on the other side the River, at the head of the
Bridge, as that though the walls thereof were with equal emulation defended by
Cannon, Musket, Mines, and artificial fires, at last the Imperialists made
themselves masters thereof by a general Assault, wherein such was the
slaughter as the very walls in some places guttered down blood; and readily
turning the Cannon upon the Town, they began to play upon the walls thereof on
that side likewise, from whence the besieged being desirous to reply, (as it
behoved them to do) that they might keep them off with their Cannon and
frequent Musket Shot, they began to find that their store of Powder was
mightily shrunk, without the which not being able to defend themselves, and
finding no hopes of succor, they thought of surrendering, whereby they might
receive more advantageous terms, then in like cases are usually had from the
Victor. Therefore the Governor having acquainted all his Officers, in what
condition the Town was, that the want of Ammunition was great, (there not being
Powder enough to maintain three days shot) and that without great store
thereof that frequent shooting could not be maintained, with which they had
hitherto supplied the imperfection of their Rampires, and kept the Enemy aloof
off; that they might not through obstinacy, (as it ofttimes befalls those who
are too confident and presumptuous) lose together with the Town, their lives
and lively-hoods, he took the opinions in writing of the Captains, and other
Officers, and then gave notice to the Caesarian Camp, that he would parle.
Hostages being forthwith given on both sides, 'twas agreed that the Garrison
should march out with their Colors flying, Drums beating, Matches lighted,
Arms, and Baggage, and some pieces of Cannon; that the Inhabitants should live
as best liked themselves, and that such as would not stay there might freely
remove their goods, or alienate them, and go whether they pleased; and that
the City should enjoy all its ancient Privileges: and since it seems natural,
that neighboring Princes are not acceptable to Towns, and States that love
liberty, (whither this proceed for Antipathy, or that men are not well pleased
with the shadow of what over-hangs their own gardens, or grounds; or be it
from envy which is borne to neighboring greatness) the Citizens desired
likewise to have it granted them, that the Duke of Bavaria should have no
right, nor rule over them; and that whatsoever Garrison should be put there
into, they might be of Caesar's Forces. This was likewise granted them by the
King to his great glory, and to the extraordinary comfort of those people, who
though they were overcome, boasted they had got such large Conditions, as
perhaps they should not have found, had they continued free. And this was done
because the Austrians were willing to win upon the peoples affections by easy
means, which is better then severity of certain Politicians, who know not how
to make their Subjects obedient, but by the Sword, and keeping them under: and
by this example they would have invited other Towns, which had flowne out by
reason of the bad government of former Ministers of State, to submit themselves
again to the obedience of their native Prince, the which would have insued, and
would ere this have been seen, had not the Masters eye been too far distant
from the actions of his Commanders, who through their own authority, grew
licentious.

The loss of Ratisbon, though it cost the Austrians the lives of about 6000
men, (the very flower of their Army) partly perished by the Sword, partly by
sufferings, partly by hunger, and that they spent above two Months more before
it, then Waymer did when he won it with the effusion of more Wine then
Blood, did much inhearten the Romanists, neither without reason; for by this
success, they were heightened to greater hopes, and confidence; and the
Protestants, that they might stop the current of such reports as raised and
added to the honor of the Romanists actions, as those whereby their
confederates might forsake them; and because generous hearts are very tender of
detraction, they resolved to oppose the fury of this torrent with the banks of
some honorable action, though it were very difficult and dangerous to
withstand it whilst the tide came in; and therefore if they failed in their
designs (as shall be hereafter said,) all their mischief proceeded merely
from the slothfulness of their Officers; who aiming in all their actions,
only at their own interests, thinking upon nothing else, but how to get
Contributions from the Country, and to raise Moneys, that they might afterward
quietly retire themselves to their own homes, rich in Moneys, and loaded with
spoil, did not care to stir out of their quarters, unless enforced by
necessity. For had their thoughts been only bent upon the public good, every
one of them would have made that the scope of all their actions, by not
suffering the losers to gather Forces together, which were afterward to be
employed in revenge.

Nor can they herein any ways excuse themselves, for it is commonly reported
they never endeavored to hinder the Imperialists from raising of men, by
setting upon them before they were got together, which they might much more
easily have done, then when they were sufficiently provided, and their Counsels
in their disputations have for the most part been upon resolves, and their
Arms used against the Country People where they were quartered, rather then in
what respected the public preservation, and in augmenting the common utility:
nay every one of their Captains having his thoughts more bent upon the
emulation of his fellow Colleague, then upon the bond of concord, by going
cooly to work, that they might withdraw from the opinion of another man's
glory, they through their own discords gave occasion to their Enemies to reap
in due time that advantage which could not from any where else have been
expected. And from hence may be gathered of what force supreme Authority is in
Military affairs, and what prejudice they receive who depend upon another man's
sense; for before they have resolved upon what is to be don, their Enemies have
done what they would do.

Ratisbon being wone from the Swedes, the King cast his eye upon the Saxons
proceedings in Slesia and Bohemia, from which he was to expect no little
indammagement in those parts; he therefore resolved to march into Bohemia, and
from thence to lead his Forces into the midst of Saxony, hoping not only to
pluck the Electors wings, but by force of Arms to bring him to conclude a
Peace; which being obtained, and so those Forces disingaged from thence, which
ought to have been employed in the preservation of Bohemia, high were the
designs, to drive with so great Forces the Swedes from out the Empire, and so
easily to return into possession of what had been lost. But neither could
words, nor determinations, nor promises, bring the Elector of Saxony to think
of Peace; for were it either for fear of the Swedes, who were yet strong in
the field, or out of a desire to draw an advantage out of this necessity from
the Imperialists, no agreement could be made, neither of the one, nor of the
other side. So as the King passing over the Danube at Straubing with his Army,
he marched toward the upper Palatinat, leaving the D. of Bavaria with some
Imperial Regiments joined to those other of his own, in his own state, to have
an eye to the Swedes proceedings.

The Infanta who (as has been said) having entertained himself for above one
whole year in the state of Milan, in which time through his admirable
wisdom, he did much comfort the Subjects with the sincere demonstration of
his good intentions, and of the like of the King his Brother, was inclined to
Peace, and to hold good intelligence with the Princes and Potentates of Italy,
winning upon their affections, and moderating the jealousies which had been
till then spread abroad over all that Country, by some men desirous of
Noveltie; that the Spaniard aspired to bring it to his beck, and to increase
his own greatness. By his interposition, the differences between the
Genoueses and the Duke of Savoy, from whence some new commotions might have
risen, were composed; he renewed the League with the Papists- Switzers, and in
courteous manner received Embassies which were sent to him from all the Princes
of Italy, to congratulate his arrival. Amongst which one must not be forgot,
which far exceeded for pomp and glory, all others in our memories, sent at
any time from any King whatsoever, not only to Milan, but to any other part;
and this was the Embassy of Signior Bertucci Valier, a noble Senator of the
most illustrious state of Venice, who appeared in such splendour, as he
sufficiently proved, that the greatness and magnificency of that Republique,
(most illustriously represented, by those that represented her) has ^one in
Europe that can equal her.

Ninety Companies of Foot, and 25 Troops of Horse, being brought into the
state of Milan, under the command of the Marquis of Liganes, the Duke of
Nocera, Prince of S. Severo, Marquis Fiorenza, Count de Langia, Matteo Rocales,
Gasparo Baraldi, Peter Cardanes, Marquis Lonaso, Maestro di Campo Guasco, and
Gambacorto, the Infanta resolved upon his departure for Flanders, and his going
was now thought the more opportune, for as much as it was not then time to do
any new thing in Italy against the French, nor yet to hinder the Imperial
Forces in Germany from such a succor; for the war being managed by the
Spaniards advice, those Ministers of state were resolved to make it appear,
that as by their means and Counsel Walesteines treachery was cut off,
together with his life, in the very rise thereof, so having unfetterd the
Caesarian Authority, they were able to maintain the Imperial Crown. 'Twas
added, that the Swedes being at varience between themselves, and thereby their
numbers lessened, they would be brought to a bad bargain, when they should be
pursued by a powerful Army; and though some objected the consideration of the
French Forces, from whence it was affirmed the Swedes would not fail to be
reinforced, yet their own interest being concerned, 'twas supposed they would
never succor the Swedes to any purpose, till they had such places as were
possessed by the Swedes upon the Rhyn in their hands: but since as yet the
Swedes were resolute not to quit them, 'twas likely they would be unwillinger
to do so, when by the assistance of the French they should be remitted into
their former condition of strength; whence it was foreseen that the French
under pretense of not first breaking with Spain, and by reason of the Duke of
Orleans absence out of the Kingdom (who was then in the Spaniards hands) would
rather choose to reduce the Swedes to such necessity, as that they must be
enforced to assign over unto them those Towns, so as they might become
masters thereof without drawing a Sword, then that they would foment their
greatness.

The Spaniards then past over the Mountains in Italy, and the Infanta being
come to Inspruch hasted to Lints, whither the Queen of Hungary was come to meet
her Brother, whom when he had seen, he together with his Brother in Law, and
chief Heads of the Army, held a Council to advise what course was best to be
taken in the present conjuncture of time. The Dutchmen were of opinion, that
pursuing what they had begun, they should march boldly against the Saxons;
alleging that the Elector surprised by the imminent danger, and wanting the
Swedes succor, would easily be brought to think of Peace; without the which
since they could not freely keep the field with such advantage as was desired,
they were to employ their Counsels and their Forces to that purpose: they
added, that though Waymer and Horn should come in to their succor (the way
into Bavaria being open, and all their Forces brought into Saxony) the seat of
War would be in that Electorate, without hazarding, that the French should be
compelled to come in to the succor of the Swedes, so as they might not come to
an open breach with them.

But the Spaniards and the Duke of Bavaria, who thought it better and more
opportune advice, to march with their Forces against the gross body of the
Swedes, whose weakening would the better facilitate the accommodation with
Saxony; and that for the honor of their Arms they were bound to go into
Flaunders, where in many respects (as well of the Infanta his presence, as of
the recruiting those parts) 'twas need^^ll the Forces destined for their own
desence should first be imployde before they should be consumed in the service
of the Emperor; and the Duke of Bavaria adhering in opinion to the Spaniards
as that which was best grounded, (for to boot with the fear he had of the
Swedes, who lay upon the Frontiers of his State, it complyde with his interest
that those Forces should be dispersed which were entertained in many of his
Towns) and the one and the other of them being desirous that they should march
with their Army thitherward; alleging moreover, that Saxony would never make
any considerable progress into Bohemia by reason of their Commanders
slothfulness, who were more given to drink then to fight; they prevailed so
much by their arguments, as they brought the King to resolve upon his return
to the Danube, and to go against such Towns as were possessed by the Swedes. He
therefore presently faced about, and came unexpectedly before Dunawert, against
which he made two gallant assaults, which the defendants not being able to
resist, the Town was stormed, and the greatest part of the Garrison put to the
Sword.

The Swedish Generals, who lay incampt between Dunawert and Auspurg, and
hearing the news of Dunawert being taken, and foreseeing that their longer
abode in Bavaria would be prejudicial to them, they resolved that Waymer
should retreat toward Lavingen, a place near the Danube, between Dunawert
and Vlm, and should encampe himself thereabouts; and that Horn, that he might
have an eye to the proceedings of the Infanta's Army which was quartered about
Fussen, should go to between the Iser and the Leech, with intention to hinder
the Spaniards from joining with the Imperialists, and to advance further when
the Ringrave should be come up unto him; who being with above 7000 good
Soldiers in the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, he had timely advertisement to advance
into Swabenland, so as by his assistance Horn might keep the Field with less
fear of danger. But competition between Commanders, being that which of all
other things does most retarde victory, and is the ruin of Armies, (were it
either the will of God or the Swedes misfortune) the bad effects thereof were
sufficiently showed upon this occasion. For the Ringrave seeming (and but
seeming) as if he would join with him, that he might not be under another
command) this was one of the chief reasons of the ruin of the Swedish Forces

By reason of the Treaty at Ratisbon, wherein so large and fair conditions
were granted by the Austrians, who made use of this bait to bring such to be in
love with their civil demeanure, who formerly exasperated by the severe usage
of former Ministers of State, would never be brought to comply with them;
diverse Imperial Cities, and in particular Nurenberg, which was then brought to
a bad condition; their Traffic being hindered, wherewithal the greatest part
of the Inhabitans did maintain themselves, and a great scarcity of Victuals
being amongst them, by the devastation of the Country and adjacent parts made
by the Armies, insomuch as that they paid half a Florin for a loaf of bread,
and a Dollar for a pottle of Wine; the Citizens thereof began to move a Treaty
of agreement with Caesar, making use of this pretense, to honest and cloak
their faultiness, that they had joined with the Swedish party to no other end
but for the maintenance of their liberty of Conscience, Privileges, and
Franchises, which they had so many years enjoyed; and that when they should be
listened unto in these their pretensions by the Emperor, they would balke all
other occasions of violating their Oath, and do homage to him: and that they
had had sufficient experience, that to deliver ones self up into the
protection of another Prince, was a total for-going of their obedience to
their chief Sovereign, and a prejudicial subjection of themselves to a worser,
as their state had too well made proof of, whilst by having recourse unto the
King of Swethland (a Prince in appearance very affectionate to his Friends)
they had purchased the destruction of their Territories, the consumption of
their Arsenalls, and the ruin of all their affairs, with an undoubted
certainty, that when the King should have brought all Germany under him, they
should be otherwise treated then by the Imperialists; For that Princes, who are
ambitious of greatness, retain nothing in memory, save only what in the
present may make for their advantage.

By reason of the resolution taken at the Diet at Franckfort, by the Protestant
party, of making Duke Waymer General of the Forces of the union, 'twas said,
that the Duke of Saxony grew likewise jealous; and that moreover he was not
well satisfied with Oxesternes government, who he thought did not proceed with
him in so sincere a manner as he ought; and that the Contributions which were
had from the Associate Provinces, were not divided amongst the Soldiers as
they ought to be, but converted to the private use of the Swedish Commanders,
who were suspected to send into Swethland to their own homes what they got in
Germany; whereat the Dutch were not a little troubled, whilst they saw another
remote Country clothed with their spoils. These allegations were likewise
occasioned by particular envy, which usually reigning amongst Statesmen and
Chiefetaines, (who are ambitious to be thought the only Christalls, wherein the
actions of other men ought to be seen) had at this time given some signs of
the Dukes no great good affected intelligency with the Swedes.

Whereupon the Austrians making use hereof, endeavored again by new
propositions and proffers to draw this Prince to conclude a Peace, upon whose
example did depend the other Confederate States and Cities of Germany; and to
this purpose Deputies were sent from both sides to Pern, a City on the side of
Elb above Dresden; where, though the Imperialists used all the skill they could
to overcome whatsoever oppositions, yet was it not possible to allay the
Electors distrust and diffidence, nor to satisfy his pretensions; so as this
endeavor proving likewise vain, they continued in their hostility.

Horn was this mean while come with his Army to Myndelheim to watch over the
Spaniards proceedings; who gave out, that they would go into the upper
Swabenland and into Alsatia: When Waymer being advertised, that the
Imperialists, after the taking of Dunawert, marched toward Norlinghen, one of
the chief Cities in Swabenland, situated in a large plain, begirt with
Rampired Walls and strong Towers, hastened his march to come and join with
Horn, the which he did at Gutemsberg, a place near the Danube, between
Lavingen and Vlm, at the same time when the Caesarians appeared first before
Norlinghen. Where the Swedes suddenly resolved to pass over the Danube at
Lipheim, (a Town not far from Gutemsberg) and to incampe themselves in the
mouth of the Valley of Rems (which is a plain of about two miles in breadth
between the Mountains, beginning at the end of the Norlinghen Champian, and
extends it self into the Dukedom of Wirtenberg toward Baling) that they
might the better secure the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, the maintaining whereof was
of great advantage to them; for all other adjacent parts being ransacked, they
could only from hence have Victuals and Forage for their Armies. And because
they thought this the most convenient seat, not only to succor Norlinghen,
but other places of consideration in Swabenland and Franconia, they took their
way through the Territories of Haidnhaim, which is a Country along the River
Brents, which is a Country upon the Confines of Swabenland toward Wirtenberg,
and went to Aulen a Town not far from thence; where, though they received
advertisement the Count Strozz and John De Were, were gone with a good strength
of Horse from the Imperial Camp to set upon Valerspach, and other places of
Franconia, they would notwithstanding lose no time, but went the next day
toward Bapsinghen, upon the Confines of Swabenland toward Wirtenberg, that
they might there take their readiest advantage and bring relief into the
City; in which march they met with some Imperial Troops, wherewith they
skirmished, cut many of them in pieces, and took some prisoners.

The Swedes being come to Bapsinghen, they the next morning possessed themselves
of the neighboring Hill; where long consultation was had touching what they
were for the present to do: Waymer was of opinion, that they were to set upon
the Caesarian Camp, and provoke them to battle; but Horn, and many other
chief Officers were of another mind, and advised contrary to what Waymer had
propounded; who notwithstanding persisting in his opinion, and being seconded
therein by Offcherchin, Lieutenant General of the Horse, 'twas resolved, that
the next morning Waymers Horse, which made the right wing of the battle,
should advance to a straight and incommodious passage in face of the Enemies
Camp, (who were already possessed of all the most advantageous neighboring
Avenues) to discover whether or no they might pass that way without danger;
the which being effected, they presently found the difficulty greater then
they had imagined, by reason of John De Werts return, who was sent for back
from the enterprise of Valerspach, by which means the Imperialists did much
exceed them in numbers; wherefore they agreed not to try a battle at that time,
but only to send some recruits into the City, to encourage the Governor and
Inhabitants thereof, and to exhort them to expect the arrival of the Ringrave
and Cratzs, upon whose coming they should be sure to be succored; 200
Musketeers were therefore conveyed into the Town by Horns Horse, who went
himself to the very Gate, where he spoke with the Governor, and persuaded him
to persist in his defending the Town, promising him sudden and opportune
succor, which being done, he returned to his quarters not meeting with any
encounter.

This mean while Colonel Libesteime was come unto them with two of the Duke
of Wirtenbergs Regiments, and one of Ransawes, and Schavalischi, with three
other Regiments, two of Horse, and one of Foot; the Swedish Horse, (the
Ringrave, and Cratz, not coming unto them) could not move from the advantage
of their seat, without either giving battle, or making a prejudicial retreat,
for if they should once part from thence, it would be very hard for Cratz ever
to join with them, who ran manifest danger of being left to the mercy of the
Imperialists: much complaint was made for want of Forage, for it being to be
fetched afar off, many of their Horse came short home which were cut off by
the Crabats; and the City, which was continually played upon by the Cannon from
diverse of the Enemies batteries, by making of several great fires, gave notice
of what extremity it was reduced unto. Waymer persuaded by these reasons, and
by his own generous heart, which still excited him to try a battle with the
Enemy, and who desired nothing so much as to be in the Front against a contrary
Army, so to bear away the Victory, which he affirmed to be a pleasure, which
did far exceed all other earthly contentment, began again to persuade Horn
that they were obliged to succor the City since they had given them their
word so to do; that every day they lost in so doing made the Confederate
Cities less confident, for when they should see Ratisbon, Dunawert, and
Norlinghen, lost in the face of the Swedish Army, their Colleague, which not
long before had boasted not to fear what Fortune could do, nor any Forces the
Imperialists could make, they would have but small hopes of being defended;
especially when that Army which dauntlessely had in triumph advanced to beyond
the Danube, should now be seen to give back, and suffer Confederate Cities
recommended to the care thereof to be lost, whilst it looked on: He added, that
great undertakings were actions which became great Commanders; that boldness
made much for victory, that Julius Caesar with a few Soldiers beat Pompeyes
great Army; that the pr^ffers of fortune were not to be refused, which to make
the Protestants victories more glorious, had given them an occasion to
immortallise their fame, by bringing them to fight against a King, a Cardinal,
and an Elector of the Empire, assisted by Polaches, Hungarians, Dutch,
Italians, and Spaniards, the gallantest Nations of Europe; that the taking any
one of these Princes prisoners would be a weighty circumstance: that there
could not be a fitter time then this desired by Soldiers, for by overcomming
fresh men, rich, and well appointed, they were to change their fortune,
together with their apparel; that the Findlanders Horse longed to have a
bickering with the Neapolitans, and to change horse with them; that great
numbers begat confusion; and that danger ought not to be thought of, where men's
minds are conscious of no such thing.

But these reasons prevailed nothing with Horn, who governing himself with
wisdom, and solidity, was not carried away with the vapors of desire; for
the business in hand being weighty, he would by no means consent to what had
been moved: but his advice was, to know the opinions of all the chiefest
Officers, before they should come to such a resolution; who being called
together, and much argumentation being had hereupon, it was the general
opinion, that the Infanta's Army being that day joined with the Kings, and the
Swedes succor being yet afar of, they neither could nor ought undertake any
thing, which would be but to precipitate themselves into ruin. Horn said, and
was followed in what he said by the greatest part of the Commanders, that in a
business of so great weight, men ought to be very advised in their
resolutions, and to foresee the event of running greedily upon a business, the
difficulties whereof were not so slight, as their desires would make them
appear; that the Austrian Army was conducted by valiant Captains, and who
were desirous in presence of their Prince to demonstrate such valor, as might
make them seem worthy of the places conferred upon them; that the Dutch wanted
not courage, the greatest part of them being the remainders of those Armies,
who had so often looked the Enemy in the face; that the Italians though new
men, were yet known to be agile, and soon made capable of the business,
desirous of honor, and who not being acquainted in the Country, it was to be
believed, that they would jointly resolve rather to die overco^ming, then by
flying away become a prey to the barbarous Country People; that the Spaniards
being ambitious of glory, and of the fame of being cried-up for the preservours
of the Imperial greatness, being resolute in fighting, a wise Nation, and
very valiant, it was not to be imagined that they would turn their backs;
that the Kings being present ought not to be contemned, though but a young man,
for that it was a great furtherance to an Army; and all Commanders desirous
together with his years to increase in his Majesty's favor, they were by
manifestation of their gallantry to endeavor a place in his affection: but
that which of all things else ought to be duly weighed was, that they were very
weak in men, in comparison of the Enemy; and that they were not to pass by
one consideration, that if they should be worsted at this time, he knew not how
they should ever get together again, since the Crown of Swethland could not
disburse moneys for new levies, and the Captains not caring whether their
Companies were full or empty, that therefore the chief thing to be endeavored
was the preservation of those people, without the which the Swedish power would
be annihilated; and that they must rather think how to overcome their Enemies
by Wit, then by Weapons; and that if they would needs try a Battle, they must
of necessity attend the coming of one at the least of their two expected
re-inforcements. So as to give Waymer notwithstanding satisfaction, they
resolved to lay aside any resolution of giving Battle, till Cratz at least
were come to them, who was by this time not far of; they fell notwithstanding
to bethink how they might endeavor to succor the Town with any appearance
of good success; and diverse were the consultations in this behalf. Some were
of opinion, that their best course was to seat themselves at Vallesteine, some
half a League distant from Nordlinghen, as the nearest place unto the City,
and from whence they might bring such succor as was requisite: but this was
not approved of, for that to effect this, a great space of champian Country
being to be passed over, they consequently afforded the Enemy opportunity to
give them Battle, when the Swedes should not be able to retreat at their
pleasure; and the Caesarians being at liberty to overrun the state of
Wirtenberg, and the Territories of Vlm, they would not only have thence all
things requisite for their Army, but they would necessitate them to forgo that
place, for fear of being beaten thence; and consequently the City, not
receiving necessary succor, would surrender it self in sight of their Army.
Others advised that they should withdraw their Army for their better security
sake, a little further from the Caesarians, till the arrival of their expected
succor; but neither was this thought fitting, for their retreat would have
invited the Enemy to follow them, and to plunder the state of Wirtenberg, and
the recruits expected from Franconia, could not without great difficulty, and
evident danger, come to the Swedish Army. So at last their joint opinions was
to succor Nordlinghen; but in such sort as the Army should not want victuals
from the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, nor that that state should be left to the
discretion of the Imperialists: and though this resolution was likewise upon
well-grounded reasons withstood by Cratz (who was then newly come, as one who
was better acquainted with the Country and the Enemies Forces, amongst whom he
had long commanded) publicly protesting, that so rash an attempt ought not to
be made, against a fresh, victorious Army, and so recruited, without a further
addition of Forces, which was to be expected by the Ringraves arrival, who was
by this time nigh at hand, and by some other Troops likewise not far off;
and Horn was likewise of this opinion, adding, that an Army consisting of
great numbers, and those new Soldiers, ought rather to be fought withal by
keeping them busied and molested, then by the Sword; for not being able to keep
themselves long in an impoverished Country, they must of necessity either
perish or begone, just as befell the Duke of Feria the year before; yet for
that both Cratz and Horn were willing to please Waymer and Offcherchen, (who
as none of the wisest, would in jeasting manner say, that these their Counsels
and Advises partooke of fear) they were so much incenst at these speeches,
which reflected so much upon them, as they concluded to put in execution, and
to be themselves the first that should prosecute, this resolution. They
therefore raised their Camp the first day of September, September. 1.
which consisted of 12000 Foot, and 8000 Horse, and 28 piece of Cannon. There
was a Hill near the City called Arensperg, upon the which if they should have
encamped themselves, the besieged would have thereby been much comforted, and
the Caesarians so much incommodated, as they would for certain have been
enforced in a short time to raise their Siege. The Swedes therefore marched
toward that Hill, to effect what they had agreed upon: the Imperialists heard
of this their motion, but not being able to imagine what their design might
be, not dreaming that ever they would make so hard an attempt, they moved not
from their quarters, till they saw them near their Corpse de guarde, which they
had reinforced with some Regiments of Horse; finding afterward some bands of
Swedish Musketeers belonging to Waymer, which were the Vanguard, and drew
after them some pieces of Cannon, made toward them, not willing to contest the
Field with them, they gave them way, and retired themselves to the aforesaid
Hill Arensperg, the place which the Swedes had designed to incamp themselves
in. Duke Waymer with a great Body of Horse set upon the said Corpse de guarde,
and though they were with equal valor withstood by them, and Sadlers, and
Cratz his Regiments beaten back, at last being overborne by the Swedish Horse,
(which furiously and in a joint body Charged them) they and such other Troops
as were sent in to their succor, were enforced to give back, with the loss
of many of the Austrians; and in particular Prior Aldobrandini perish't there,
a valiant Gentleman and deservedly beloved of all. The like befell another
passage guarded by 400 Spaniards, which was by force of Arms taken by Colonel
Vistem, after a stout defense made by the Enemy: and for that that station was
of so great moment, only for as long as the wood continued, near unto which it
was, and the end whereof extended to where the Imperialists were encamped in
Battaile-array, they were so far advanced, and their Musketeers so engaged,
as that they were necessitated to endeavor likewise the gaining of the plain.
But Waymer being confronted by a gallant Body of Caesarians, and he not having
men enough to set upon them; Horn, (who though he still were of the same
mind, which was to keep upon Arensperg, and make himsele master thereof, on
that side which extends it self to the left hand, that he might there expect
the Ringrave, who was within two little days march, and had with him about
8000 of the bravest and best experienced Soldiers of all the Army) since he
saw that to proceed like a wiseman, was esteemed a token of Cowardice, by those
who by reason of their former good successes despised the Enemy, and would come
to a Battle, to show that he likewise wanted not courage, and that he knew
not what fear meant, he furiously fell upon those trenches which were made by
the Spaniards, and giving upon two Battaglions of Foot, though they had much
ado to get unto a half moon which stood upon the very beginning of the
height, yet Charging them through, after a bloody fight wherein the Count de
Solmes, and Colonel Verms were slain, who had the charge to defend it with
their Regiments, they entered thereinto; where instead of haulting and making
good the station, as Horn commanded them, they advanced to set upon the
Squadrons of the Spanish Army, which was placed in Battaile-array; where being
Charged by the Austrian Horse, and the rest of the Swedes not being able to
succor them, for that the Trenches were not to be pas^ by horse, and much
pestered with smoke, occasioned through the firing of the Imperialists
Ammunition, they fled away in great confusion, so as the Spaniards might easily
advance, and regaine that important station, which proved afterward the ruin
of the Swedes.

This rout given to the Protestants would not have proved so prejudicial, if
the Horse, which was appointed to back them had advanced in due time, and
opened the fences, as Horn had commanded them. They say this omission was
occasioned by the encumbrance of some Carriages over-turned in the Woods, which
contrary to the orders they had received, advancing before the said Horse, was
a cause of detaining them for a while and this was the reason why that
advantage was lost, which afterward 'twas impossible to recover; for whilst
the Swedish Foot advanced forwards into the Trenches, not being backed by their
Horse, the greatest part of them were cut in pieces by the Austrian Horse. The
fight was valiantly performed for some while, not only here, but likewise on
the left wing, with the Caesarian Horse, whose Charges the Swedes valiantly
withstood, and gallantly repulsed; and the business grew now to be so hot, as
that many hard incounters were made, and many fierce skirmishes; but because
the Swedes could not Charge so well by reason of the disadvantage of their
situation, and not being able to get into their Trenches, the Imperialists
growing more and more upon them, they were enforced to endeavor a retreat, but
being engaged a little too forward, though Horn had here showed all the worth
of wit and industry that ever was shown by the undaunted discretion of any
ancient experienced Commander, the success was not good; Horn made all his
Horse advance against the Caesarians, and gallantly Charged them, that he might
have time, whilst these were at handy blows with the enemy, to draw off his
Cannon, which was too far advanced; and likewise to recover his Foot about a
little Town called Neresham which lies in the vallie between the Hill where
the action was, and the above named Arensperg, and which extends it self to a
little River: he likewise hoped that his Vanguard should take their station
together with the Cannon, on the other side the said Town, so as the
Reare-ward which was pursued by the Austrians might retreat under the
safeguard of the Artillery, and being thus gotten into a place of advantage,
his Troops might face about, and jointly with Duke Waymer make head against
the Caesarians, till the Ringrave, who was not far off, might bring opportune
succor.

But the Battaglions of the left Wing, tired and worn out with the labor of
eight hours continued fight, and being charged by reserves and other fresh
Troops of the Caesarians, turned their backs, and running hastily to save
themselves under the shelter of Horns Vanguard, they broke the files thereof,
and totally discomposed it. At the sight hereof Horn and Cratz came in, and
facing their Regiments, ceased not to exhort them to turn head; but it was in
vain and impossible to bring them again into order; and the fear of death
being more prevalent then the comfort of life, deafened, and blinded through
confusion, they ran with loose reins, some here, some there, as fast as
their Horses could carry them. Whereupon Horn provoked by honor, and by the
words which Offcherchen had let fall, resolved not to live to be the spectator
of so great a misfortune; but it not standing with Gods good will that he
should then perish, he was taken prisoner, as was likewise Cratz, who being
wounded by a Musket Shot, could not escape falling into the Enemies hands.

This battle lasted from the break of day on the 7th of September, September. 7.
till two in the afternoon, in the which the Swedes left dead upon the field
about 6000 Soldiers, the greatest part whereof were Foot, lost all their
Cannon and Baggage; and that which most imported, they likewise lost the
reputation of their Arms, and fortune, which favoring all their actions till
this instant, had made their fame terrible to all Europe, and brought them to
be so conceited of, as that it was thought by the wisest, nothing but discords
and emulation between themselves could have rendered them conquerable. Almost
all the Horse retreated with Waymer into the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, and from
thence to Franckfort, and some Foot companies retired to Vlm with Offcherchen,
who was also wounded. This battle was given by the Swedes too unadvisedly, and
out of too much courage; for not being above 20000 fighting men, they had the
boldness to provoke an Army composed of three Armies, wherein were above 40000
Soldiers, and in place of such advantage as did move laughter in the
Romanists; many whereof thought that they did it out of despair, or for want
of wit in the Swedish Commanders. The Kings Majesty, and the Illustrious
Infanta, won immortal glory in this battle; Princes* who, to the wonder of
all men, were always amidst the Musket Shot, void of fear; nor would they be
withdrawn from thence, for any Counsel could be given them, but replied, that
such Princes as are afear'd, ought to keep themselves in their Royal
Palaces, not come into any Army. The greatest actions in this battle were
performed by the Spaniards and Italians, in so much as the Swedes themselves
were astonished to see it, who set upon their quarters, thinking to affright
them, as being but new Soldiers, and yet they found by all they did they had
no paragons; the Spaniards notwithstanding, of all others fought most
miraculously with their foot fixed, and gave testimony of their Valor and
Fidelity; in so much as the Dutchmen may confess, it was by their means
that they received any comfort: for doubtless without their inforcements and
undauntednesse, together with this battle, they would have lost all means of
ever gathering head again. Of their Commanders, the Marquis of Liganes was by
the Swedes themselves accounted worthy of all glory, and to be esteemed a
gallant Commander; yet are not the rest to be forgotten, for every one to whose
share it fell to fight, discharged his duty as became him. Of the Swedes,
Horn and Cratz were immortallized, not so much for the valor showed by their
Swords, as for the solid wisdom of their counsels, wherein if they had been
followed by the rest, they would not doubtlessely have split upon this Rock:
yet did Waymer, Vistum, and the rest behave themselves valiantly; but the
advantage of the ground, and the imparitie of Forces, took off the edge of
their fierceness. Horn being brought prisoner into the Spanish Tents, the
King and Infanta were desirous to see that man whose valor had made his fame
immortal, and therefore he was brought to their Lodgings; where, as he would
have prostrated himself before his Majesty and the Infanta, they (like worthy
Princes, and endued with extraordinary goodness) raised him up, and receiving
him in a courteous and friendly manner, told him, they were much satisfied in
having so worthy and so valiant a prisoner: to which Horn replied, and I am
proud to be in the hands of so great Princes. He was from thence sent back
into the quarters, where he was visited by all the Commanders of the Army; and
the King gave order that he should be treated with all respect and civilitie,
such as is usually given to men of merit by great and magnanimous Princes.

Whilst the Austrians were busy in bringing their ends about in Germany and
Italy, the French were not idle; for the great Cardinal Richelieu (wisely
foreseeing where the blow prepared by the Spanish brain was to fall) used his
best industry not to suffer his King to stand a fruitless spectator in this
controversy; and therefore the taking of Bitsch and La Motta was the more
plied: both which were surrendered, the one through the weakness of its
Garrison, the other by the death of the Governor, who as he was coming into
the Town from forth a half Moon that was without the gates, was slain by a
Musket Shot upon the Drawbridge. The Castle of Vildesteime, in the Voghese
Mountain, upon the confines of Lorayne, toward Alsatia and Burgundy, was also
taken; and that whole Province being reduced, that great headpiece began to
think of new Achievements in Alsatia, (when things should succeed more
opportunely) and to prepare the fittest means to march with their Forces into
Italy, if the peace should at any time be broken.

The French therefore gathering together all their Forces which were dispersed
about Lorayne, marched with them toward the Frontiers of Alsatia, not without
some jealousy in the Austrians, who feared lest they might join with the
Swedes, of whom likewise there wanted not some apprehensions; for the French
seeing them held in play by the Caesarian Forces, thought to get into Filisburg
by force if they could not prevail by fair means. Their end notwithstanding,
(as was conceived by Politicians) was, neither to declare War at this time
against the Austrians, neither yet to distaste the Swedes; but as Arbitrators
of the business in Germany, the proceedings both of the Swedes and Austrians
depending upon the balance of their Forces, to keep themselves attentive
spectators upon the fall of the one or other of them; carrying the matter so,
as whether the Swedes should win or lose, they without entering into War
might reap advantage thereby. For the Kingdom of France being then all of a
piece, and therefore become the most formidable power of all Christendom, if
the Austrians should prevail, they would be able to uphold the Swedish party;
and such strong holds as by such an accident should be put into their hands by
the Swedes, they might easily keep them; and if the Swedes should be
victorious, the apprehended Austrian greatness growing weaker, they saw they
were sufficient to enlarge their own Empire, and to keep the Swedes within
the limited bounds of power; so as France being well enough pleased with the
falling out of others, that so she might inhaunce, and keep entire her own
strength through their ruins, it was clearly discerned, that their intentions
were neither to denounce War against the Spaniards, nor yet to foment the
Swedes but conditionally. For if they should have denounced War, to boot with
the former alleged reasons, concerning the Duke of Orleans absence, it was to
be considered, that the breaking of peace without occasion given, would
adhibite faith to what was already suspected, that the French intended to pluck
down the Spanish greatness, and by the ruins thereof, the more to aggrandise
their own Monarchy; and that which imported more then all the rest, that the
Austrian Force being counterpoised by the French-mens declaring of themselves,
'twas easily discerned, that the Swedes having the way opened to proceed on to
further greatness, they would consequently be more confirmed in their
resolution of not parting with the Towns upon the Rhyn, nor yield to give the
French such content as they desired. Whereupon if the French should endeavor
by force of Arms to make them forgo their obstinacy, it would be a means to
make a pacification between the Swedes and the Emperor, and to their no
little prejudice incite them against themselves, or by holding with them to
rest contented with what they could purchase of themselves, at the great
expense of money and blood. And because the French knew the great ill will that
the Lorayners bare them, to shun all insurrections, they resolved only to
keep Nancy, La Motta, and Bitsch, and to throw open the Gates of all the other
Cities, walled Towns, and Castles of that state, which were 36 in number; and
to prevent any mischief that might happen at Nancy the Inhabitants were
disarmed, and at Nostre-Dame gate a Citadell of four Bulworkes was erected.

In Italy, where in due time 'twas doubted their Armies might fall on, they
gave in Commission to Duke Crequi, who was dispatched from Rome, that he should
go to all the Princes and Potentates there, under pretense of Visit,
Complements, and ratification of his Majesty's good intelligence with them; but
indeed secretly to inform himself, how they stood affected toward his most
Christian Majesty; and where he should find any appearance of averseness,
that he should wisely endeavor to work upon their affections by promises, and
by making his Kings good intentions known unto them; making his agreement so
with them, that upon any occasion they might favor him; and that he should
invite them to an offensive League against the Spaniards in the State of Milan,
as the place which lies open to the commerce of the Emperors Forces; and the
maine Body of their strength being thither reduced, kept the neighboring
states in continual jealousies. He therefore went to Florence, and though he
had no hope to obtain any thing of the great Duke, by reason of his relation
to the house of Austria; yet to palliate the intentions of his other Visits,
'twas thought fit in all respects, both of decency and fair correspondency,
that he should go to that Court to make all his other Embassyes seem but
Complementall, without futher causing jealousy in the Spaniard. From thence he
went to Venice, where having stayed two months, he found those wise Senators
desirous to preserve the public peace of Italy, and constant in always
keeping good intelligence with his Majesty of France, rather willing to be
mediators for public tranquilly, then authors of new turmoyles Having taken
leave at Venice, where he admired the greatness of their regalities, and the
splendid manner of their treating, he went to Mantua, where being worthily
received by Duke Charles, and assured of his great good inclination to the
Crown of France, he passed on to Parma, to visit the Duke thereof, whom he
found full of high and generous thoughts, and one who being a sprightly Prince,
was not contented to pass away his time in idleness, a thing despised by
exalted minds; and having filled his Highness with vast hopes, and assured him
of his Kings assistance in keeping him independent upon the Spaniards, and
confirmed him in his good will to France, and to that purpose agreed upon what
was known fitting for the Dukes interest, he followed on his journey to
Pyemont, and there passing over the Mountains, returned to France.

The Swedes vast hopes being ship-wrack't in the battle at Norlinghen, and
they knowing themselves to be reduced to such a condition, as they could no
longer with safety keep in such places ^s were by them Garrisoned, the
Garrisons were drawn out at Biberach, Bucorn, Cell, Rinfelt, Friburg, and from
all other places, where the Swedes had any, by the Ringraves order, who was
then Chief Commander of the Forces in Alsatia, and all these which might
amount to the number of 3000. being added to the other 6000. the said Ringrave
had with him, and which were not in the battle, the Swedish Commanders knowing
it was impossible for them to keep longer in those parts, withdrew themselves
to before Strasburg, that they might hault t^ere under the protection of that
City, reputed one the strongest of all Germamany, that they might re-assemble
in the best sort they could their disbanded Forces, and those which they drew
from the neighboring quarters.

This Victory, which much inheartned the Austrians, and all that sided with
them, was solemnised with a public thanksgiving, and by speedy Posts all
their friends were advertised thereof; signifying what advantage the Romanists
might hope from thence, and on the contrary side, what damage their Enemies
were to receive thereby. Whilst thus encouraged, they advanced to reap the
fruits of so great good fortune, this news was much resented in France, though
some more speculative then others, would say, that this defeat was desired by
the French, and expected upon design, that they might see the Swedish Forces
reduced to such Condition, as that standing in need of their protection, they
should be necessitated to have recourse thereunto, and consequently willing to
put into their hands not only Filisburg, (which the French so earnestly
desired) but likewise Mentz., Benfeilt, and other places upon the Rhyn, possessed
by the Swedish Soldier, and wherein they had hitherto obstinatly kept
themselves, nor would by any means be persuaded to forgo them. The Marshall
de la Force, who with a complete Army of about 16000 fighting men kept himself
in Montbelgard (a Country which lies between the Frontiers of Lorayne,
Burgundy, and Helvetia, not long before purchased for a sum of Money by the
French, from the Duke of Wirtenberg) and upon the Frontiers of Lorayne, and
Alsatia, did by order from the King draw nearer the Rhyn; not out of any
intention to join with the Protestant Forces, (as it was noysed, and feared by
the Romanists; the more, for that the Marshall being a Protestant, 'twas
doubted he might vary from his directions received from the Court, and
demonstrate his affection toward the Protestants to their advantage) but to
get into the Towns, where the Swedes being no longer able to subsist, 'twas
known they would rather deliver them up unto the French, then to the
Imperialists. And just so it fell out, for the Swedes being too weak to keep
themselves in that Province without the aid of France, resolved to quit
Colmar, Sclestat, Hagenaw, Lindaw, Hermisteime, and some other Towns barely
begirt with ancient Walls, though Populous, and Merchandising, which ly in the
heart of that Province, on the other side of the Rhyn toward Lorayne.

Monsieur de Fichieres (who was then assistant for the King of France in
Franckfort, with Oxesterne, and the reformed Council,) making use of this
occasion, renewed his demand and his pretense to Filisburg, and that the Swedes
might the easilier condescend to the consignation thereof, he accompanied his
demands with vast promises of assistance; which was very willingly listened unto
by them who upon this emergency stood in need enough thereof, for necessity is
that which makes things either acceptable, or unacceptable. Oxesterne
notwithstanding was of another opinion, though he wisely concealed it; for he
approved not of receiving so powerful strangers to be companions in their
achievements, and so to receive Laws from them, for by engaging their own
liberty, and subjecting themselves to France, he would say to those he did
confide in, that when they should have this strong hold, they would desire
another; and under the specious charitable pretense of receiving the Romanists
into protection, they would without unsheathing their Swords, enjoy the reward
of the Swedish labors. That neighboring potentates nor their exhibitions
ought never to be trusted in, for what is not taken by the enemy with the Sword
falls into the power of friends, by the exposition of some writing, made by some
Officer of State. The other Dutch Counselors (for of the twelve deputies
chosen to consider of the public government of the Confederates affairs,
there were nine of that Nation) allured by hopes of moneys from France, upon
which they much relied, as well for the public as their particular interest,
(for they very well knew they could no longer subsist by the Swedish party, and
that therefore it was behovefull for them to have some other Prince to rely
upon, from whom they might receive such pensions as might maintain them in the
decency of their degree,) subscribed to this desire of the Ambassador, and
persuaded Oxesterne to resolve upon sending to Colonel Smidberg, who was
Governor of the Fort, to deliver it up unto the French, the which was done,
though with some delay; for Smidberg, pretending that the Crown of Swethland
owed him certain Moneys, intended not to quit that place till he had received
satisfaction. 'Twas said he was hereunto incited secretly by Oxesterne, who for
diverse ends would protract the surrender of that place. Yet did the French
remove this obstacle by satisfying Smidberg, by which means they possessed
themselves of this so considerable strength.

Waymer being gotten with the remainder of his ill-treated Army to Franckfort,
and having re-assembled a new Body of an Army, about 14000 Soldiers by the
means of the two Brothers, Otho Lodovico, and Philip the Ringrave, who joined
their Forces with him, and by the Soldiers drawn out of the Swedish
Garrisons, eagerly thirsting after revenge, pressed the French Ambassador that
he would send unto him 6000 men which had formerly been promised by virtue of
the new capitulation between the Swedes and Crown of France, in lieu whereof the
Swedes had till now taken Money, to shun such confusion as is usually caused by
the French, when they are mixed with other Nations: By which aid he gave out he
would yet be able to oppose and retard the Imperialists in their swing of
Victory, who were very much weakened by the Infanta's parting from them, who
carried along with him, as he traveled, not only all the Spanish Army being
about 10000 fighting men, but likewise part of the Imperialists assigned to him
by the King for his convoy. The Ambassador replied hereunto in an affectionate
manner, that his Highness was not at all deceived in his relying upon succor
from his King, who was a well-wisher to the interests of the Crown of Swede,
to the Protestants in Germany, and to Waymers person in particular; that
therefore he would suddenly acquaint the Court therewith, and that he would
moreover write to the Marshall de la Force, to know from him what orders, he
had received from the King concerning this; and thus he held him in suspense
till having received an answer, he gave the Duke to understand that the French
were ready to assist him; but that 6000 Soldiers appearing to them to be very
few in respect of the Austrians numerous Forces imboldned by Victory, they
intended not to hazard the reputation of their Arms upon a new precipice; that
therefore they offered to second him with a complete Army of 20000 fighting
men, which were upon those Frontiers in Alsatia.

The Ambassador did upon this offer, take cunningly an opportune occasion to
re-demand Benfelt, Gustavensburg, Mentz, and other neighboring places, much
desired by the French, the better to secure themselves of Lorayne; and that
they might make the War in another man's Country, if at any time the
Austrians should endeavor to put Duke Charles into his Country again. This
caused no small muttering in Oxensternes Court, where it was public
discourse, that the French did only desire to reduce the Swedes to a
necessity of imploring their succor, by which means they might fully
complete their ends, which were to possess themselves of all the Towns of
those Provinces without waging War, that so they might not only enlarge the
Confines of their great Kingdom, but secure it by the Rhyn from being invaded
by the Dutch, and by bringing their Forces at their pleasure against them,
enforce the Germans, weakened by so many Wars, to submit themselves to their
protection, and to depend upon the Laws of France, and so to keep the
Imperial Forces in perpetual motion, fomenting the Protestants, to divert
them from such assistance as they might bring to Flanders and Italy, when the
French should move with their Forces into those parts. All reasons drawn from
sound Consequences, and approved of by real Arguments; yet did their
principal object make against it, which would not permit them without greater
occasion to break with the house of Austria, and counterveene such Articles as
they had sworn and subscribed unto, especially in a time when the Duke of
Orleans was out of France.

This coming of the French into Alsatia, and the news of the delivery of
Filisburg by the Swedes into their hands, was so brisk a gust of wind, as it
quite over-turned many of the Austrians designs which they had formerly
resolved upon; in so much as though in reason they should have pursued their
Victory, and not have suffered the Swedes to recruit, they did notwithstanding
curb in their proceedings, which showed they had no mind to make the Swedes
desperate, and so force them to fly for protection to France, and join their
Forces with those of so puissant a King, delivering up unto him such strong
holds as they were possessed of upon the Rhyn, which when they should be in the
hands of the French, they would meet with more difficulty in recovering them.
And moreover, the Austrians were very unwilling to break the peace with so
great a King; For these Towns lying upon the Confines of Lorayne, which the
French were new possessed of they should consequently have Alsatia annexed to
their Dominions, from whence they might without any obstacle issue out with
such numerous Forces as that Crown is famous for, and render vain the
endeavors of whatsoever more then reasonable Army. And so by the ruin of
their Enemies, Forreyners should get further footing in their Territories; and
whilst they should beat the Tree, others should gather the Fruit. And the
French should without loss of blood be Master of those Cities which would
hardly be regained by puissant Armies. 'Twas observed, that from this time
forward the Austrians began to proceed more slowly, being contented to
undertake such enterprises, from the event whereof they could not expect any
absolute benefit.

The Landgrave of Hessen had better success then his other Confederates, who
was at this time at the siege of Myndem, the Garrison whereof by continual
fallying out did much prejudice the besiegers; for in one sally they slighted
two of their batteries, and took three piece of Cannon which they brought into
their City, and took many prisoners. Yet did this little avail them, for
duties and famine daily increasing, and having no hopes of succor, they were
forced to yield the Town unto the Landgrave, who freely gave them leave to
march out with their Arms, Baggage, and two piece of Cannon, on the 24th of
November. Novem. 24


The Duke of Orleans, who had absented himself from the King his Brothers
Court, being wrought upon to that purpose by the persuasions of his
Counselors, who through the desire of bettring their conditions, and blinded
by lying hopes, believed by this dis-agreement of the Royal Brothers, to make
the King withdraw his affection from those Ministers of State, whose greatness
they envyed, and to advance themselves; being encouraged by the Queen his
Mother who was then in Flanders, and allured by fair promises which were said
to be made unto him by the Spaniards, was at this time in Brussells; where at
last, better bethinking himself of his own affairs, wisely discovering the
cunning of those that were his advisers, and growing very apprehensive; for it
was said, by those that were skilled in State-affaires, that the Spaniards
intended under some specious pretense to secure his person, and dexterously to
allure him into Spain, where they might afterward keep him as an Hostage for
the jealousies they might have of the great powers of the most Christian King,
from all which they might rest secure by having this pawn in their hands; for
hardly would the French have taken up Arms against their Kings Brother, since
their King wanting Issue his Scepter was to fall into his Brothers hand; not
was it likely they would engage themselves in a War against their Kings only
Brother, and put the Kingdom to so much cost and grievance, since from thence
they could expect nothing but the ruins usually occasioned by War. Moreover,
any advantage the French could have made hereby, would have come short of a
ransom for their King, in case the Crown should have fallen to the said Duke
of Orleans. These impressions growing strong in Monsieur, and he moreover
reflecting much upon the Infanta's arrival, who was to take upon him the
command of those Provinces, the which indeed did most of all trouble him. To
these considerations was likewise added, secret intelligence held between the
Cardinal Richelieu, and Monsieur de Pilloran, who (as is usual with the
sprightlinesse of the French) annoied with the Spanish gravity, desirous to
alter his purpose, and to enjoy those mighty promises which were made unto him
by the King; And having moreover forgone his love which he bore to the
Princess of Phalsberg, for new affection taken to Madame de Chimay, took upon
him to be a means as well of the return of his Master, and of the reconciling
him with the King, as he had been of withdrawing him out of France.

Other excellent practices of the Cardinal (who as a faithful servant of that
Crown, was much troubled at this disagreement between his two Masters,) were
used to effect this; As likewise the wholesome advice of some others, who were
engaged as good Frenchmen to undeceive him, and free him of such suspicions as
were imprinted in him, by those that envied the greatness of France. These
conceptions put together were so available, as discovering at last the cinders
under which the fire lay hid, which he feared might break forth into some
great flame, he resolved to have speedy recourse to the waters of mercy of his
most Christian Majesty, wherewithal to wash away all his faults. He therefore
under pretense of hunting (an exercise wherein he usually spent his leisure
times) agreed with those he affided in, of what safest and shortest way he was
to take; he resolved to ride straight toward the Frontiers of Picardy, and
took order to prevent any mischief which might ensue, that upon the day
appointed certain Troops of French Horse should be upon those Frontiers. He
went out of Brussels, waighted upon by Messieurs de Pilloran, de Fargis, de
Condray, Montpensier, leaving Monsieur de Candeboune, to wait upon the Duchess
his Wife, which Candebonne was afterward sent away by the Spaniards as one
they trusted not in: And finally he arrived in France to the great contentment
of all the Subjects, Princes, Ministers of state, Cardinal, and of the King
himself, which they expressed by Jubilean tears, and all outward manifestations
of joy; and to the as great coffeehouse of all those who had laid their
foundations upon these divisions. The Spaniards (who if all be true, that was
said, were not very well pleased hereat) did notwithstanding wisely cover their
inward sorrow, giving out how much they were joyed, that their Kings Brethren
in law were reconciled, and that his Highness needed not have been so secret
in his departure; for as they had courteously received him, so would they as
willingly have served him, and attended him with such decency into France, as
became so great a Prince.

The Infanta whom we left after the Battle of Nordlinghen, in the Spanish
Army, in the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, went by Ashaffemburg (a City belonging to
the Elector of Mentz upon the Main) toward Cullen, and came happily into the
Country of Lucemburg, with the great applause of the Inhabitants.

The King of Hungary having taken Neilburne, a City in the Dukedom of
Wirtenberg, seated upon the Neccar, which being only surrounded with old Walls
soon yielded, marched with his Forces toward the Ringrave, who kept himself
with his own men, and those he had drawn out of Garrisons, near Offemberg,
to oppose the Caesarians proceedings in those parts; not being strong enough to
face a great and victorious Army, discovering the Imperialists Scouts, and
having skirmished with them, he retired toward Strasburg; But being pursued by
the Caesarian Horse, and not able to get to the Bridge over the Rhyn before
they overtooke him, whilst he past over his Foot, it behoved him to skirmish
with the Imperialists Horse, where being overborne by the gross of the Enemy,
and not able to pass over the Rhyn by the Bridge, which was barricadoed by
Carts, and Foot, he to save his person threw himself into the River, and by
swimming over it, escaped the hands of the Enemy, but left behind him, at this
bout, near 400 Horse and some Carriages.

After this action, the Imperialists fearing lest they might necessitate the
Swedes to implore succor from France, and to join themselves with the Army
commanded by the Marshall de la Force, who was fallen down into Alsatia, and
was then quartered about Lindaw, they kept themselves within there quarters for
some time in the Dukedom of Wirtenberg, not endeavoring any new business, at
which the Swedish Commanders did not a little wonder. But this was by
politicians interpreted a piece of cunning, thus to afford leisure to the
Swedes, who were totally broken, that gathering a little courage they might not
give way to the demands made in Mentz by the French Agents, concerning those
Towns which they held upon the Rhyn, and thereabouts, and which they had yet
refused to surrender. But the Elector of Bavaria growing jealous at these
delays, by which they seemed rather to seek peace with the Protestant Princes,
then pursue the war, 'twas said, that the Austrians foreseeing an almost
inevitable rupture with France, would first see the business of Germany
settled, that they might the more freely afterward oppose themselves to the
French Forces, the which was to be endeavored before they should declare open
War against the French; for if they should fall foul with them, before the
other affair were settled, they were likely to meet with greater difficulties
then otherwise; for inheartned by hopes from France, their pretensions would be
the loftier. The Duke of Bavaria doubted lest the Emperor might conclude this
Peace, and lest he might remit the Count Palatine into his state, so to gain
the friendship of the King of England, which it much imported him to have. He
endeavored therefore (by what was gathered from understanding men) to thwart
this, and made John de Were, Commander of the Forces of the Catholic League,
(of which the said Duke, as has been formerly said, was Generalissimo) sit
down before Heydelberg the Metropolitan of the lower Palatinat, to renew by
this hostillity, the jealousies between Caesar and the Crown of England; the
which Were did, and took the Town, and shortly after the Castle, which wanting
succor compounded.

The loss of this Town, though it opened the way for the Caesarians to
advance, without any difficulty, toward Franckfort, and Mentz, yet was it not
pleasing to the Imperial Council. For Manheime being garrizon'd by the
French, a strong hold upon the Rhyn, at the mouth of the Neccar, formerly
possessed by the Spaniards, and afterward slighted by them, to free themselves
of the expense they must be at, in maintaining a strong Garrison there, which
now they needed not, and having built a Bridge upon Boats, they would not
oblige them to pass over the Rhyn and declare War. They therefore kept
themselves within their quarters at Wirtenberg, and the Marquisat of Turlach,
not endeavoring any other enterprise, attending the conclusion of Peace with
Saxony, which at this time, was with much fervenvency, and almost an assured
success treated of. For the distastes which that Elector had taken against
Oxesterne, for the little respect given by him in his discourses to the
Electors actions, were grown to a very great height; And though the French who
were troubled this peace should be concluded, sent Monsieur de la Grange, to
the Elector to disturb it (as it was commonly reported) with promise of
Moneys, Arms and assistance, yet did they not fear to effect it; for the
Elector was not greatly well inclined to the greatness of Foreign
Protestants in Germany, and therefore it was not to be believed, he would
nourish the War, at the desire of the French.

WHilst the Imperial Forces, to the wonder of many, remained idle in their
Quarters at Wirtenberg, Lieutenant Colonel Iaspar Baumberger, formerly
Governor at Filisburg, (he who before he surrendered that place to the Swedes,
cunningly, and peradventure with intention of making use thereof upon fitting
occasion, made the Palizadoes to be sawed on some sides of the Fort, and to be
so repleated, that if at any time, any reasonable force should be used against
them, they might be broken in sunder and thrown down) the season serving for
this purpose, which was so cold, as that all the Ditches were hard frozen over,
and encouraged by the good correspondency which he held with all the parts
thereabouts, (for whilst he had the government of that place, he so behaved
himself, as he had generally won the good will of all the neighboring
people; not doing as the French, who by making continual inrodes into the
neighboring Towns, and by other different ways of proceeding, and Military
licentiousness, had purchased the peoples hatred) did secretly acquaint the
King of Hungary, and some other prime Counselors and Chief Commanders of the
Caesarian Army, with his design. Who debating hereupon, some were of a
contrary opinion; affirming, That the event of a business must be maturely
foreseen before the business it self be undertaken; that it was well known
how that Fort was valued by the French, what trouble and pains they had to get
it from the Swedes, and that therefore it was not to be doubted, that as the
loss would be more resented, so would the distaste they should take thereat be
the greater; that it was not yet time to come to open enmity with the French,
who were at peace within themselves, had recovered their Kings Brother, and who
united within themselves, were of themselves alone, without any other
assistance, formidable to all Europe; a Nation always desirous of War, which
could not wish for a better occasion then such a conjuncture to break with the
Spaniards, being as well their greatest Enemies as their chiefest Rivalls, and
who by having an Army out of their Kingdom, might thereby evacuate those
unquiet humors wherewithal they do abound, and which uses to occasion
home-troubles amongst them, very advantageous to those that fear them, and
without which all attempts against them are vain; that Flanders was not able
at one and the same time to maintain it self against the Hollanders, and
defend it self against the French who might easily fall upon Artois; that the
Forces of Burgondy were too small to defend it self, from those much more
powerful of a King of France; that Italy, which was drained by the continual
evacuation of so many men sent into Germany and Flanders, most Princes being at
this crisis of time well inclined toward the French, might run a great hazard
if it should at this time be set upon; that it was no doubt that either
Flanders or Italy, without succor from Germany, could make their party good
against the French; that it was credible, that the Spaniards, who were much
concerned in the possession of those Provinces, were to expect succor from the
Emperor, whereby the Dutch Army being weakened, the Swedes joining consequently
with the French Forces, the War was likely to be kept on Foot in the Empire,
to the great prejudice of those people; that it was therefore better for them
to temporise, and persisting in the way they were in, before they should break
with France, to weaken the Swedes, reassume a good correspondency with the
Hanse-Townes, and conclude the peace with Saxony, without the which it would be
dangerous for them to have to do with the French.

To these wel-grounded Reasons, reply was made by those who knew how
advantageous it was to make Achievements without cost, That occasions of
securing themselves and growing greater were not to be let slip when Fortune
proffers the means; that the proceedings of the French were no longer
concealed; that the harms occasioned by them were apparently seen; how they
endeavored to oppress the house of Austria and aggrandise themselves; that
the blows of a declared Enemy were less to be feared then those of a
diffident and feigned friend; that it was to be considered, the French would
always foment the Austrians Enemies, and strongly assist them, out of hopes of
getting somewhat thereby; and that keeping themselves in peace, whilst others
were by the ears, as others grew weaker, they must consequently grow the
stronger; that the proceedings of the French out of France was not much to be
feared, for that the impatiency and eagerness of that Nation, not being long
to be tolerated by others of a different genius, 'twas probably to be hoped
they might alter the affections and friendship of their Confederates; that it
made not for any of the other Protestants that they should get footing out of
France; that it would be hard for them to make any proceedings in Flanders, by
reason of the strong holds and situation thereof; that it was held, the
Hollanders would never agree they should grow greater in those parts; That
Burgundy wanted not Forts upon the Frontiers sufficient to consume whatsoever
Army; and that the loss of that Country would be prejudicial to Helvetia,
whereunto it was not expedient to change the Confines of a King whose
Territories were dis-joyned, with those of a formidable Monarch whose state was
united; that more might be feared in Italy then elsewhere; but since it made
not for the advantage of the Princes and Potentates thereof, that the state of
Milan should be taken from the Spaniards, and put into the hands of the French,
it was to be hoped, that they would not draw ruin upon themselves, but that
well weighing their own interest, they would pitch upon some such expedient
means as they might know fittest to keep their neighbors low. That the
Country was narrow, guarded by considerable Forts; and that the Italians who
showed themselves to be jealous of the Spaniards greatness in that Country,
'twas to be believed they would show no less dislike against the French, when
they should appear to advance toward them: So as it was better to take
Filisberg, (since thereby they should drive beyond the Rhyn, and the Palatinat
secured,) and to hazard themselves upon an open War, then (by neglecting such
an occasion) to preserve a suspicious Peace, which was likely to be broken to
their greater prejudice.

These reasons weighed together with others, seemed to be more valide, and
therefore consent being thereunto given, Baumberger made some crafty Soldiers
advance toward the Town in Country-mens apparel, that at the appointed
time, they might surprise the Corpse de Guard that was at the Gate, in a very
dark and cold night, and he himself marched thitherward, and by means of
the Ice, which was able to bear any whatsoever weight, he drew near the
Rampires with his Ladders, and easily breaking down the weakened Palisadoes,
he put some 300 of his men into the Town, who joining with the former, and
possessing themselves of the Corpse de Guard within, and beating down the
Drawbridges with a Petar on the out side, the Caesarians luckily entered the
Town the 24th day of January, Ian. 24
whereas otherwise it was thought a presumptuous and vain attempt to have
offered at it. They took the Governor, Officers, and most part of the
Souldies prisoners, who foolishly believing, that the Austrians would never
have dared to break with their so strong and fortunate King, whilst they had
other Irons in the fire, and thinking themselves to be in a sanctuary,
neglected their Guards, not dreaming of any such novelty.

By this surprisall and other fortunate successes of the Imperialists, the
Inhabitants of Franckfort, were as much moved, as they were unresolved what
side to betake themselves unto, they saw apparent ruin if they had not speedy
recourse to Caesar's clemency; they were weary of the Swedes, who began to be
troublesome to them: for knowing they were to forgo that City, they
endeavored by indirect means to get what they could from the Citizens, none
of the Protestant party caring then for the public good which they held as
good as lost. The Inhabitants of Franckfort therefore seeing themselves reduced
to this condition, began to treat of agreement with the Austrian Agents. And
the Capitulation being ended, they took in a Garrison of the Emperors; and
though they were not sure this their resolution should prove so successful as
they expected, (for the Town of Sassenhawsen, which was over against the City,
was in the Swedes possession, by whom they might suffer injuries; and to this
consideration was moreover added, the neighborhood of the French Army, and
Waymers, which might cause to them some considerable prejudice) yet they
thought it more advantageous at the present to cloze in with the Emperor, who
offered them a gracious pardon, then be exposed to the misfortunes of War,
and put their hopes in those, who minding nothing but their particular
affairs, wanted both means and will to think of the public interest, and
of their confederat^ friends.

Franckforts accommodation was the loss of Sassenhawsen, for being played upon
on two sides, by the Austrians, though the Swedes under the command of Colonel
Vistam did for many days gallantly defend it, yet were they at last compelled
to yield to greater Force, and upon honorable Conditions, which were granted
them, to quit the Town and withdraw to Mentz. The proceedings of Were and
Gallasse were likewise furthered by the taking of Sassenhawsen, for Were
passing over the Rhyn, took Spier without any gaine-saying, a City of good
receipt, but only walled about after the ancient manner, and put poorly
inhabited, seated near the Rhyn, and wherein the Imperial Chamber had wont to
be. And Gallasse without much ado possessed himself of Wassenburg in the lower
Alsatia, upon the Confines of Lorayne, at the foot of the Mountains which
divide Lorayne from Alsatia; a Town reasonably well peopled, and surrounded
with a good Ditch, but old Walls.

This mean while the news of the surprisall of Filisburg came to France,
which as it was a thing altogether unexpected by the French, who could hardly
be persuaded, that the Austrians in this present conjuncture of time would have
broken the Peace with them; So was it very displeasing to the whole Court,
which being highly incenst that the Imperialists should have ventured upon that
place, which was under the protection of that Crown, as part of the
Bishopric of Spier, belonging to the Elector of Triers, who had already put
himself into the protection of France; the King and all his Officers began to
seem more inclined to break with the Austrians, presuming they had now just
reason so to do. And though the Austrians endeavored to moderate this opinion
in the King, signifying unto his Majesty, that they were forced upon that
enterprise by the French, who had in effect declared themselves Enemies to the
house of Austria, by taking of such places as made for their prejudice; the
Emperor by capitulation made with the Elector, having always had a part in
the Garrison maintained in the very Town of Filisburg; and though with many
like messages from Rome they were not wanting in endeavors to retard and
divert the breach between those two Crowns, the Pope very well foreseeing,
that from thence nothing could be expected but some singular prejudice to the
Roman Religion, and to Italy also, whither certainly Forces would be brought:
Yet were they not able to appease the French, who in a threatening manner
prepared for revenge, making much Warre-like provision, and beginning really to
think upon War. Commissary Bullyon was therefore dispatched from France into
Rhetia, with some Moneys to pay the Soldiers there, and to make other
provisions secretly to effect the enterprise of the Valteline, and they sent
likewise a good quantity of treasure to Pinerolle, and some recruits of men, to
guard that Fortress, and in fine all things necessary were provided in all
places for a War, against so considerable a Potentate.

Whilst France made great preparations on all sides for War, and Foot, and
Horse, were frequently raised, no declaration being made whether they tended;
the Infanta who had already taken upon him the government of Flanders, finding
the Popes wholesome admonitions not able to appease the pretenses of the two
Crowns, their diffidence being grown too great, that he might lose no time,
made use of the Intelligence he held with some of the Inhabitants, and of the
negligence had by some of the French guards, and bethought himself of the
taking of Triers, which was kept at this time by a French Garrison.

Having therefore agreed on the manner with Prince Thomas, who was then
Governor of all the King of Spaines Forces in Flanders, and was with the other
Austrian Forces in Lucemberg, he made Count Finden march thitherward, and by
the favor of the season, of the Intelligence he held, and of the neglected
guards, who expected not such an accident, the City was suddenly set upon, and
taken on the 21th of March, March 21.
the Elector made prisoner, and brought with a good Convoy to Brussels, many of
the Garrison slain and taken. This action though it were of some consideration
to the House of Austria, (as well by the addition of the Town, as for the
Electors person, who to purchase his liberty, would at all times give his voice
in the Imperial Diet, for the crowning of the King of Hungary King of the
Romans) yet was it thought by some to be no little misfortune; for this being a
blow wherewithal France, being now great in power and Military preparations,
would be netled, so great ruins were foreseeen, as not only their own
Subjects, but their Neighbors, yea, all Europe should suffer thereby; and so
it fell out: For the King of France to boot with these apparent injuries,
sufficient to legitimate an occasion of breaking Peace, was little satisfied
with the proceedings of the Spanish Agents, who were publicly peacht by the
French for having wrought upon the Duke of Orleans, and other subjects of
France, by many hopes, and filled them with vast imaginations, thereby to cause
civil discords, then which they could find no better diversion; and for
having done other things prejudicial to that Kingdom: And finding at last the
breach might well be retarded, but not evaded; for the Spaniards would never
have suffered the French to make such Achievements, without drawing a Sword,
and not requite them by Arms, since it so became them to do, in respect of
those who for their sakes were turned out; As likewise for that it did not well
agree with their government, that the French should grow greater, and should
get nearer to their Confines, whereby they should be continually jealous of
their neighborhood, and be sure to have them always a counterpoise to their
greatness, whilst under the name of good neighbors, they had possessed
themselves of such Towns as were held by their Forces, for the preservation of
such as had flowne unto their King for protection; They resolved not to permit
any longer any such hostility without resentment. Having therefore concluded
upon War, the King of France sent an intimation to the Infanta, which employed
an open breach unless he would presently restore unto him Triers, and set the
Elector at liberty; the Messenger whereof was not by his Highness listened
unto. Henry Duke of Rohan who was with a great body of men about Ramberviller
in Lorayne, was commanded to fall down into Alsatia, that he might be ready
for the employment he was put upon. Duke Crequi who was returned from his
Embassy from Rome, and who was made Lieutenant-Generall of all the French
Forces in Italy, had Commission for the raising of 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse in
Dolpheny, and Bresse, and to be ready to fall into P^emont upon any such order
from the King. 2000 French Foot were sent to Casalle. Much Military Provision
was sent to Pinerolle. The Inhabitants of Pragelle (which is a Vallie on this
side the Mountain of Geneva, and from whence issues the River Chison, which
having cut through the Vallie of Perosa, falls into Poe near Villefranca) were
commanded to make certain places of those Mountains more easy to be passed,
that such Soldiers as were to go from Lions and Grenoble into Italy might
pass that way. Monsieur de Bellieure, a personage of great esteem, was
declared Ambassador extraordinary to all the Princes and Potentates of Italy.
And because the Duke of Parma, who was still more and more distasted with the
Spanish Agents, held good correspondency with the French, diverse Companies of
Horse were sent toward Parma, and a good sum of Money was sent by the King to
the Duke thereof, to raise new Troops, and for the payment of an Army in his
own state; of which, together with the assistance of other Princes their
friends, the French thought to make use, to assist them on that other side, in
the assault they intended to give by the way of Montferrat to the state of
Milan; And if the effect thereof had been answerable to the wisdom of the
plot, and his Majesty's advice had been readily executed, doubtless the
Spaniards might have run the hazard of losing the state of Milan, which did
then sufficiently want men for its own defense. Thus the Ambassadors being
dispatched away, diligent preparations for War were made on both sides.

The news hereof coming to the Emperors Court, which was not yet quite free
from the former disorders, altered the pulse thereof on this side, and did not
a little obviat those hopes wherewith they were already much comforted by their
late good success against the Swedes. Wherefore fearing some new mischief,
they speedily summoned the wisest of their Council together, and examined such
things as most concerned the preservation of the Empire, and found, that their
discords with the Protestant Princes, were the repletions which kept it
languishing; for that the War maintained in their own Territories, weakened
the Frontiers of Germany, and laid low the Spaniards high designs, built upon
the power of the Emperor. 'Twas therefore agreed upon that all diligence
should be used to find out an adequat remedy for this malady, which they found
not to consist in their own Forces, dispersed abroad in other places through
the hostility of the Princes of the Empire. The Elector of Saxony was then
again invited to a new treaty of Peace, which was propounded unto him, and
accompanied with the fairest propositions that necessity could find out. Baron
Curts went to Prague to treat with those deputed by the Elector, who though at
first they were hardly persuaded to come thither, they at last agreed upon a
meeting, wherein the Electors pretensions and the Emperors proffers were made
known.

The Duke was found to be already somewhat diffident of the Swedish Agents for
the Reasons that have been said; and that he was greatly jealous of the
French-mens having declared themselves, whose greatness was distasted by the
Dutch; and that he feared, lest by the assistance of that King, Duke Waymer,
and the Swedes, might grow to such an excessive power, as that he himself
should not dare to answer to Waymers pretensions, which might perchance fall
upon the Electorate, as being formerly the patrimony of his Progenitors.
Hereunto was added, That the Princes of the Empire not being pleased with the
depression of the Austrians, thereby to exalt Forreiners, it was no good Maxim
so far to agrandise their friends, as to become afterward no less jealous
of their greatness then of the Emperors excessive power: So as finding
himself in a condition to purchase an accommodation with Caesar, upon better
terms then formerly, he showed himself more inclinable to peace then in the
preceding Treaties; which the Imperial Agents perceiving, and pressing for a
conclusion, the Heads were signed unto, and the former correspondency with that
Prince reassumed, with the applause, and to the content of all the Saxonists
who had been much consumed in that War. The Heads of the Agreement were,
That the exercise of Religion, being left free, (save in the Emperors
Hereditary Territories) the Elector should be permitted peacefully to possess
for 50 years yet to come, all such Goods of the Church as he was now possessed
of, which time being expired, those differences were to be decided by the Sword
of Justice, not of War; That three Towns in the Bishopric of Magdeburg
should remain at his disposal, and that the Prince his Son should be
Aministrator of the said Magdeburg, and should enjoy the Principality of
Lutzenitz; That reasonable Levyes of Moneys should be made throughout the
whole Empire, for satisfaction of the Crown of Swethland, if they would accept
of this peace; And that those should be satisfied who should renounce what was
given them; And that such as would not agree unto this peace, should be
enforced thereunto only by the Emperor, without the Electors intermedling
therein; And that all the Princes, as well Romanists as Protestants, should be
put again into possession of their own Estates.

Auspurg was at this time in great scarcity of Victuals by reason of the
absence of the Swedish Forces, and the passages which were possessed by the
Imperialists, in so much, as daily many perished for hunger; and despairing of
succor, for that the Protestant Forces were far off, and they themselves
much weakened by their past-sufferings, the Senate thereof, induced by
necessity, resolved to fly for clemency to the Emperor. And though they had
been heinously peccant against the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria, yet found
they such usage from them, as they would hardly have found from other Princes,
for indeed their goodness has ever been very exemplary toward all such as
implored their pardon. Their Commissioners were graciously received in Stucart
by the King of Hungary, and after some days Treaty, their requests were
yielded unto. They were permitted to exercise their Religion, and were
sentenced to pay 50000 Dollars to the the Duke of Bavaria, by virtue whereof on
the 28th of March, March 28.
20. Companies of Swedes marched out of the Town, who were convoyed to Erfurt,
and 1500 Imperial Foot were taken in, under the command of Count Fucari.

This mean while the Duke of Rohan was fallen from Lorayne into Alsatia, where
he took Raffach by storm; When Commissary Bullion, who had private directions
to go along with Monsieur De Land Ambassador and Governor of the French
Forces which were in Rhetia, to the enterprise of the Valteline, for the
carriage of which affair, not only secrecy was requisite, but such
circumspect proceedings as might not give any occasion of suspicion to the
Spaniards, who as being nearer at hand might have prevented the blow, and have
possessed themselves of the passages of that Valley before the French; He
appointed his Muster at S. Madem, a little Town in the Agnedine Valley, that
he might make use of this occasion, as well to invite the Grisons by pay to
come thither in great numbers, as also to cover under this pretense any
suspicion that the assembling of so many people might occasion. The Forces
therefore being met together at the Rendezous, in all three Regiments of
Grisons, under Colonel Vlisse, Colonel Salice, Monsieur Pracher, and the
Baron of Selvesteime; three French Regiments under the Colonells, Leches,
Land, and Chambale, and two Companies of Horse, commanded by Messieures de la
Villetta, and Michy; the Commissary and Ambassador, unexpectedly opened their
Commissions, and read the Kings directions to the said Commanders, which gave
great content to all the Soldiers, who were desirous to quit those quarters
wherein they were much straightened.

They then marched toward the Mountain Spluga, and came to Chiavena, and
making themselves masters thereof, without any gaine-saying, they advanced to
Riva, and passing over Sassocorbe (which is a Rock between the Mountain and
the Lake, by which way they are to pass who will go from thence by land into
the Valley, and which is a very straight passage, and hard to be made if there
were any to defend it) they came to Traon, not meeting with any hindrance: For
the state of Milan, wanting necessary Forces for maintaining it self, was
rather thinking upon defense then how to set upon another. And because the
French-mens design was to shut up all the passages into that state, in such
sort, as it should be impossible for the Emperor to send them any succor by
the way of Tyroll, the Duke of Rohan came thither on the 24th of April with
two Regiments of Switzers, April 24.
under the command of the Colonells, Smid and Steynor, and six French Regiments
under the Colonells, Montesin, Frideliere, Cerny, Vande, Canesin, the Count Di
Serra and Colla, and five Companies of Horse belonging to the Baron of S.
Andrea, the Baron De Gin, Cannigliac, Villenueffe and Rocherviere, and made
himself master of the rest of the Valley. And though the Inhabitants did with
wet eyes behold these new guests, and that it had been better for them to have
been governed by the Spaniards, for so they might have had free commerce with
Germany, and with the state of Milan, yet were they enforced to observe such
Laws as were by the Conquerours put upon them. The Valteline is situated in
the midst between high Mountains, which hem it in on all sides, so as it
rests between them a Plain, about a mile in breadth, it is watered by the River
Ada, which runs through the middle of it, full of Towns and Villages, inhabited
by numbers of people, abounding in all sorts of Fruits the earth affords, so as
the Mountains on each side, being covered with Vines, from whence most
precious Wine is had, it represents a stately Theater. It bounds upon the state
of Milan, the Venetian Territories, the Arch-Dutchy of Tiroll, and upon Rhetia;
nor has Italy a more beautiful Valley.

The Spanish Ministers of State, in the state of Milan, not being sufficiently
provided for necessary defense, were not a little confused at the unexpected
appearance of the French and Grisons in the Valteline. Cardinal Albornotz, the
Regent in Milan, with courage sustained this so sorrowful news, and speedily
advertising Spain thereof, diligently applied himself to all such expedient
means as upon such an emergency could be used; and having weighed the
difficulties of withstanding the French (who were already masters of Riva, and
other avenues) from entering the state Milan, he thought it best, that being
careful at the present of preserving the Frontiers of that state, succor
might be solicited from Spain, Naples and Germany, by which the state being
brought into a good posture, they might betake themselves to what should be
most expedient. A scrutiny was therefore made of all such as were able to bear
Arms, from 18 years of age till 50. that upon any occurrency they might be
picked out, and employed in the defense of requisite places.

The Militia of the State, and of the men therein fitting to bear Arms, being
calculated, which might amount to near about 10000 Foot, some thousands
thereof were chosen out, and disposed of in places of most importance. Don
Carlo Colombo, and Sergeant Major Molina, were incontinently dispatched away to
the Frontiers of Comasco with ten Companies of Foot, and Count Serbellone, was
declared superintendent of those Confines, who together with other eleven
Companies of Guasco's Brigade, and five Troops of Horse, forthwith took up his
quarters on the left side of the Lake, over against the Fort Fuentes, and
fortified himself in the way which the French were to pass, to hinder the
Enemy from invading the Lands of Comasco on that side. Moneys were delivered
out to raise Soldiers in all parts. Some store of ready Money was sent to the
Ambassador Cassatt, Lieger for the King of Spain at Lucerna, to raise 4000
Switzers. Don Antonio de Sermientes Steward, was sent to Florence, to acquaint
the Duke thereof with what had hapened, and to demand of him the Brigado which
he was obliged to maintain for the defense of the state of Milan, by virtue of
the agreement made at Siena. The City of Milan disbursed readily 50000 crowns
upon this occasion. And because the Spaniards wisely foresaw, that the French
preparing themselves in Daulpheny, would certainly fall into Piemont, and from
thence into Montferrat, to set upon the state of Milan on that side also,
governing themselves with their accustomed undauntednesse, together with their
continued Provisions of War, and new Fortifications in Novara, Mortara,
Alexandria, and other Forts upon the Frontier, they bethought themselves to try
Victorio Amadeo Duke of Savoy, to see whether he, as his Father had done before
him, was resolved to follow the fortune of Spain. They very well knew, that
for reason of State it did not well befit his Highness, that the French should
nestle themselves in Lombardy, being very sure, that he should not from them
enjoy that authority and respect, which he, as esteemed doore-keeper of Italy,
had from the one and the other Crown; wherefore they were very urgent with him
to this purpose, and full of promises and hopes. But the Duke, who after the
business of Pinaroll, knew he suffered much in those Prerogatives, which
whilst absolute Master of the Marquisat of Saluzzo he enjoyed, not having
Forces sufficient to withstand the invasion of the French, and being in a
condition not to be succored by the Spaniards, whose Armies were much
diminished and weakened, his answer was ambiguous, and such as is usually given
by Princes upon such like occasions; yet it was thought, that keeping secret
and wary intelligence with the Spaniards, he had promised them that he would,
yes marry would he, satisfy the King of France in his demands; but that
temporising, and as occasion should serve, he would put on such resolutions as
should most comply with his own interest, and not be unacceptable to the
Spaniards. His answer was therefore appearingly honested with fair pretenses,
wherewithal the Spaniards were not altogether distasted, nor the French
thoroughly satisfied. In fine, the Spanish Agents were not wanting in such
wisdom and vigilance as was requisite upon such an occasion.

On the other side, Rohan began cautiously to Fortify; he put a Garrison into
Riva, drew a Trench from Provegio to Coschio, two little Towns, the one on
this side, the other on the other side of Ada; wherewithal, barricadoing up
the entrance into the Vallie, he thought to secure himself on that side from
the Spaniards attempts. And because the way from Chiavena into the Vateline by
Sasso-Corbe, which was in sight, and under the command of the Cannon of Fort
Fuentes, did trouble him, he resolved to make a way upon the ridge of the
Mountain S. Julian, to which purpose he set 200 Pioniers on work, but could
not effect his desire. He afterward going on prosperously, made himself
absolute master of the whole Vallie, without any manner of gainsaying: where
thinking to make some long abode, he took order for securing of the Fort
Feria, and of the Castle of Codera.

In this revolution of affairs, Monsieur De Bellieure came to Turin, who when
he had delivered his Embassy to the Duke, his Highness and his Ministers of
State were not a little staggered, for finding the ruin that was to fall upon
the state if they should refuse what was propounded by the King, they were
consequently to be very circu^spect in their proceedings with the French; and
on the other side, if they should yield to their desires, to foment ones own
ruin, and draw subjection upon ones self, was hard of digestion to a good
Politician. For when the French should be masters of the State of Milan, there
was no doubt, but that the Duke of Savoyes Authority growing less, and he
being environed on all sides by the French Forces, he should not keep up that
reputation which he held, whilst between them and the Spaniard, but should be
treated as a subject of France. The Duke being therefore much perplexed, and his
Council no less confused, he resolved by no means to irritate the Forces
which hung over him; but legitimating his reasons by fair excuses, to
maintain friendship with the French, and not totally forsake Spain; for time
being that which much helps the weakest in power, he might from thence expect
some happy occasion of compliance, which now to undertake would be dangerous.

Those of Piemonte did the rather adhere to this Counsel, for that they found
the winning of the state of Milan, would prove a difficult business. For
though the Duke should effectually join with the French, and openly declare
himself for them, since it did not comply with the Princes of Italy, and less
with the Switzers and Grisons, that that state should fall into the hands of
the French, they found that when the Spaniards should be brought to a very low
ebb, they would all join, in using what means they should think fittest, to
keep those Forts from being possessed by the French. The Dukes answer to the
Ambassador was therefore in generals, showing a newtrality, though (as shall
be said hereafter) he fared not the better for it. He therefore for the more
safety of his own dominions, added eight companies to every of his former
Regiments. He resolved to levy 2000 Switzers, and applied himself to such
opportune remedies as the present emergency required. And that these
negotiations might not pass without the Popes knowledge, whom he desired to
interest in his protection, knowing that he was likely to stand in need of his
Holiness his intercession to moderate the displeasure which his proceedings
might cause in the French, He sent Count Francis Cansciani to Rome* to
acquaint the Pope with the whole affair, and to desire him that he would
interpose that the Duke might be permitted, according as he desired, to keep
newter.

Duke Waymer, by reason of his late bad successes, was at this time in no good
credit with such German Princes as were confederate with the Crown of
Swethland, who did not applaud his too hasty actions. Wherefore he seeing that
the Countries Contributions grew daily less and less; that the Duke of Saxony
had made his Peace with the Emperor, and that many Hauns Towns had changed
their Copy, so as he knew not how longer to maintain his Army without help and
assistance from the great Potentate, the States from whence he raised his
Moneys and Victuals, for the maintenance of his Soldiers, being the most of
them already in the power of the Austrians, and the Country wherein he was
quartered being totally wasted and consumed, and that his Soldiers, enforced
by their sufferings, fled to the Colors which were set up of all Nations, for
the King of France; who foreseeing the insubsistency of the Dutch Companies, in
the Swedish service, as well for the want of Contribution, as of pay, which the
Swedish Commanders converted to their own use, and fearing lest by the
disbanding of these the Caesarian Army might be augmented, which was
victorious, and composed of the same Nation, resolved to make some levies of
Forreyners, as well for what has been said, as likewise to win the affection
of the Protestants, who coming into his pay, together with the aggrandizing of
his already dreaded power, the weakening of other Armies made not a little for
the advantage of the French. Waymer being therefore moved out of these
considerations resolved to fly for protection to the French, by whose Agents
he had been sought unto and persuaded to take pay of that Crown, and to
engage himself and his Forces in the service thereof.

The French foreseeing that unless they could divert the Emperors Forces,
which were numerous and well experienced, the Fabric of their design was
grounded but upon an ill foundation, and that this division of the Dutch Forces
was the right way to compass their ends, had procured this Princes dependency
upon them, he being a gallant Gentleman beloved by the Soldiers, a greatly
experienced Commander, and who was at this time in great value and estimation;
As also the like of the Landgrave of Hessen, who was a sprightly Prince, and of
no less esteem with the Protestant party, and the Elector of Saxony, and all
this was done through great promises, which being food only fit for weak
stomachs, the using thereof was rather prejudicial then advantageous to the
safety of France: For this was judged to be one of the chief motives which
made the Duke of Saxony reconcile himself to the Emperor, he having too well
found, that the protection of more puissant Princes, is nothing else but a
hook, whereby that liberty is fisht for which has escaped the nets of other
men's rule and govenment, as he had very well found since his joining in
friendship with the King of Sweden.

The great Chancellor Oxesterne having likewise wisely weighed, that any
longer tarrying about the Rhyn would be hurtful to the need which the Towns
upon the Elb and Oder stood in of his assistance, which might easily be invaded
by the Saxon Forces joined with the Emperors* As likewise for the Diet which
was to be held at Hoband for the new Truce, Peace or War, with the Polachs;
leaving Mentz, resolved to go into Pomerania, to provide for what was needful
for those Provinces, which were yet held by the Swedish Forces, and which did
more import them then the others; foreseeing very well it was impossible for
the Swedes to keep any longer upon the Rhyn, being pursued on one side by the
Imperialists Sword, and on the other side pressed by the desires and persuasions
of the French, who knowing them to be but weak in Men, Money, and Means to
subsist, did much urge them to give themselves up unto their protection, that
so they might get into their hands such Towns as they were possessed of in those
parts. He therefore took his was by France, where, by command from the King,
he was honorably treated, and received with extraordinary civillity; and
afterward imbarking himself in some Holland Vessels at Callis he l^nded safe
in Holland, and after diverse negotiations with those States, he parted from
thence and came to his journies end.

Nurenberg which yet stuck to the Evangelicall League, (for so did the
Protestants term theirs) being reduced to that scarcity of Victuals as that a
loaf of bread was sold for a Dollar, and decaying much in trade, it being a
very populous City, which lived upon handy-Crafts and Merchandising, seeing
their hopes fail them of being succored by the Swedes and Princes of the
League, being likewise invited by the examples of Ratisbon, Auspurg and other
Cities, which had found more Clemency from the Conqueror, then from the
conquered, (for Caesar finding at last that violent means did not work upon a
malady cankered through the peoples obstinacy of not forgoing the liberty of
their Conscience, had applied the due remedy thereunto, to wit, the permission
of their said liberty and privileges; which was the true Antidote wherewith to
abolish hatred, and regaine the peoples love) agreed likewise, that 'twas
better for them to reconcile themselves with the Emperor, then to persevere in
friendship with the Swedes, from whom they had yet received but a ruinous
preservation, which peradventure would not have proved such, if they had kept
themselves in their due obedience to the Emperor.

The Swedes were in these confusions, when the Imperialists imboldned by their
victories, and growing stronger in Alsatia, and Burgundy, thought it expedient
to venture upon somewhat whereby they might satisfy the Duke of Lorayne, and
advantage themselves in those parts. Montebelgarde, which lies upon the
Confines of Alsatia, Burgundy Lorayne, and Swizzerland, and where the French
had fortified themselves, seemed to them a very convenient place to open their
way into Lorayn: Gathering therefore together all their Forces toward Brisach,
and Burgundy, they advanced to the taking in thereof, against which they
planted their Cannon, played upon the Town, and would doubtlesly have taken it,
had not the Marshall de la Force suddenly come in to the succor thereof, who
fortunatly gave the Austrians Battle near Luder, and after a strong bickering
had the upperhand, and routed the Regiments of Were, Renoch, and Merci the
chief heads of that Army. Whereupon the Imperialists fearing to be worsted,
if they should continue the enterprise they had begun, suddenly raised their
Siege, and retreated, part into Burgundy, part (under Were) into Alsatia,
rather to guard that Province, then to endeavor the winning of any Towns
garrisoniz'd by the French.

As these the Austrians proceedings were jointly listened unto in Vienna, and
throughout the whole Caesarian Territories, so was the news of the French-mens
falling into the Valteline no less displeasing unto them, whereby much of
their designs was annihilated, and those of the State of Milan not a little
troubled; for that State wanting men, and Provisions requisite for its defense,
might suddenly have been set upon by the French, who if they had done as they
threatened, doubtlessely the Dukedom would have been in some danger of being
lost; since it failed of succor from Germany which was its principal stay;
from Naples and Spain, from whence, by reason of their far distance, aid
could not suddenly be had. Signor Antonio Porres was therefore dispatched away
from Milan into Inspruch, to solicit the coming of the Dutch to the succor
of the Valteline. Tiroll, though much terrified with this neighbor hood of the
French, began to beat up her Drums, her Inhabitants ran to her Confines,
breaking up the highways, and barricadoing them with great Logges of Timber,
covering themselves with Trenches, and betook themselves to defend their
passages, with as much diligence as the shortness of time would permit.

The Arch-Dutchesse of Inspruch, commanded Fornemont, Sergeant Major General,
who was then quartered with his men in Swabenland near Chempton, to pass over
S. Maryes Mount, and not only to secure Tiroll, but to regaine the places that
had been taken by the French, and driving them out of the Valteline to succor
the state of Milan; and to him were joined 1000 Foot, who were paid by the
Spanish Ambassador. Fornemont with 4000 Foot and 400 Horse, ha^ted to Mount S.
Mary, which is a narrow Hill, between exceeding high Mountains, upon the
Confines of Tiroll and the Valteline, very hard to be past over. From thence he
went to the Bathes of Bormio, which is another narrow passage, where Colonel
Pracher was with 1400 Foot, and setting courageously thereupon, he made such
work, as though he were valiantly withstood by the Grisons, and that Monsieur
De Lands Regiment, and two other Companies of Horse came in to succor; yet
Pracher knowing the place to be too weak to resist the gross body of the
Dutch which advanced, and fearing to be driven out, resolved to quit the place,
and to retreat to Bormio, and did so, with the loss of about 70 of his men,
And from thence, keeping always on the left hand of Ada, he past over Tridolfe
(a River which issues out of Valfurba) and got to Tirano, one of the greatest
Towns of the said Valley, on this side of the Ada, over against the Valley
Puschiavo, and there refreshing his wearied men, Land not thinking himself
strong enough to make head against the Imperialists, for that the greatest part
of the French were in the Country of Chiavena with the Duke of Rohan, he
resolved to get into the Valley of Puschiavo, and there to expect succor from
Rohan. Fornemont making use of the occasion the French-mens retreat afforded
him, advanced toward Tirano, and meeting with no encounter past on to Brus,
from thence as far as the little Lake of Puschiavo, from whence likewise the
French dislodged, and withdrew themselves toward the County of Chiavena; And
fearing lest the Duke of Rohan might come in to the succor of the French, he
writ to Serbellone, who was upon the Frontiers of Comasco, that making use of
this propitious occasion, he should set upon the places held by the French on
that side, that he might divert Rohan from bringing succor to the other side.
But Fornemont, not having given in his Letters his due Titles to Serbellone, as
it was said, and thereupon some distastes growing between them, Fornemont not
well satisfied, retired by the Valley of Pedenazza, into that of Lenia, and
leaving his Forces there, went to Croren, a Town in the Valley of Venesta.

Rohan this mean while being advertised by his Spies of the Austrians
proceedings, July 12.
went on the 12th of July with the greatest Forces he could on such a sudden
get together (and not leave the most important places unguarded) from the
County of Chiavena, and unexpectedly advanced into the Valley of Levin, where
the Dutch were more then satisfied with their commodious quarters, not fearing
any Enemy. But being set upon by the wonted fury of the French, and not having
their General with them, after having made some confused defense, they made
use of the benefit which a little Rivolet falling from the Mountains afforded
them, and ran away; and in this their disordered retreat, lost in such as were
slain and taken about 700 Foot. This business being done, and Rohan perceiving
there was no means of subsisting in that Valley for want of Victuals, he
returned to Puschiavo, and for the refreshing of his men, as likewise to
regaine the places that were lost at Bormio, he went to Tirano.

The Spaniards were no less amazed at this rout, then at Crequi's passing over
the Mountains with a French Army, for they probably foresaw by the avenues of
the Valteline being shut up from receiving any succor from the Dutch, by
Montferrats, and Piemonts being full of Soldiers, by the Duke of Parma's
diffidency, and his high fancies against the state of Milan, and by the state
of Venice her being armed upon her Frontiers, that if they should be set upon
in these straights, not being above 8000 Foot and 2000 Horse, they should run
danger of receiving a great blow. Notwithstanding behaving themselves
discreetly, and having received some recruits from Spain, (700 Neopolitan
Horse, and some other Foot being landed at Vado) they seemed to be a little
comforted amidst their pressing troubles.

But because all their ^opes in these present emergencies lay in the Duke of
Savoy, who if he should declare himself for them, they might easily evade the
evils that over-hung them, the Spaniards did again renew their negotiations
with the Duke of Savoy, by the interposition of Duke D'Alvito and others, to
whom they greatly complained of what had been lately done by the French,
contrary to the agreement made at Montsona and Ratisbon; That therefore his
Catholic Majesty was to take up Arms in his own defense, with whom they
desired his Highness to join in league for the common safety, or that if it
stood not with his convenience to declare himself openly their friend, he
would at least be Neuter, without any prejudice to the Territories of their
King. But the Duke, who found himself begirt on all sides with the French, and
who to the instant desires made unto him by the Ambassador Bellieure, had new
propositions put unto him by Crequi's self, so as he could not follow the
Spaniards advise without provoking the displeasure of the most Christian King,
and draw the War upon himself, made such an answer as showed how much he was
displeased to find himself in such a condition, as that he could not adhere to
their desires; affirming, that the reason of State, and the experience of
past-examples, forewarned him from drawing so great and dangerous a War upon
himself; And that therefore he was first to see what resolutions the Pope and
other Potentates of Italy would put on, each of which was interessed in the
success of this War; and that since he was not in a posture of doing what he
pleased, he could not choose but ratify the Articles agreed upon formerly with
the King of France at Lusa and Pinarollo; yet howsoever he would endeavor so
to govern himself as should testify how well he was disposed toward the
Crown of Spain.

This mean while Cr^qui having obtained leave from the Duke of Savoy, to pass
through Piemont, and all necessary Provisions for his Army, he advanced to
Montferrat; so as Arms being taken up in all parts of the state of Milan, all
the Militia of the Territories of Pavia, in Lomellina beyond the Goyna, was
suddenly put in readiness. Three Companies of Foot were sent as a Garrison
into Villata, a Town upon the Confines of Montferrat, and the Spaniards made
moreover a bridge upon Boats over the Goyna, that upon occasion they might
easily pass over men into Montferrat, to wait upon the proceedings of the
French, who, entertaining themselves in Treaties and negotiations with Savoy
and Parma (desiring that they might join all their Forces together, and set
jointly at one and the same time upon the state of Milan) spent so many days
therein, as that the Spaniards got advantage thereby, and took such breath, as
afterward preserved them in greater vigor.

These so many reports from France, being brought to the Court of Spain, did
much trouble the King and his whole Council; yet it being the property of
wisemen, to make wisdom their buckler in adversity, they were not slow in
applying themselves to such expediencies as were most behofeful for the safety
of their dominions. Many Companies of Foot were therefore raised and
entertained, with all carfulness in all parts, and men and moneys were shipped
away for Milan. 'Twas noysed abroad, that the King would go himself in Person
to Barcellona, that he might be nearer at hand to assist his Dominions, and
that if need should be he would pass into Italy; yet this was given out more
to comfort the people, then that the King or his Counselors had any such
intention. The Fleet which was before Naples, consisting of 32 Galleys, 13
Galliouns, and other armed Barques, was commanded to be in a readiness to go
whether occasion should require; and though at the very parting from Naples, it
met with such a storm, as that a good part thereof was broken and scattered,
yet recovering the Haven at Longone in the Island of Elbe all (that was amiss)
was in a short time repaired and amended.

And because the government of Milan was no longer thought fitting to be
entrusted to a Cardinal, but to some good experienced Soldier, the Marquis of
Leganes had the charge thereof given him; he, who being with the Infanta in
Flanders, won immortal Fame in the Battle at Nordlinghen, and who by new
orders from the King was returned to Spain, to acquaint his Majesty with the
affairs of Flanders and Germany. Though the Emperor in these perplexities (by
reason of his late Victories, and the peace with Saxony) had an Army on foot
(not only able to defend himself, but to go upon any other undertaking) yet
foreseeing that the Protestants being backed by the French, might easily
break out to new commotions, he made his Ambassador at Rome desire the Pope
to send him good store of money, to bring this War with the Heretics ( So
my Author is pleased to term them) to an end, by the which the holy Church
should receive no less advantage. But the Pope, thinking that liberty of
conscience granted by the Emperor to the Haunse Towns, and to the Elector of
Saxony, did not correspond with the zeal which Caesar showed to the Roman
Religion, bound up his answer in succinct terms, and excused himself in
civil manner; and yet could not forbear to say, he did not fight directly
against Heretics, since he permitted them their liberty of conscience. In
brief, Drums were beaten up in all parts, and convenient Provisions were not
omitted to withstand the current of so great a War.

But as the Frenchmen began on this side, so were they not unmindfull of what
they had to do toward Flanders; for having gotten an Army together in Picardy
of 20000 men, under the command of Marshall Schatillione, and the French
themselves weighing well the importancy of their own interests, which
consisted chiefly in keeping themselves from being invaded by the Spaniards,
as they might be in Picardy, it being an open Province, and fitter for such a
purpose then any other, bounding upon Artois, a Country held by the Spaniards,
wherein are many strong holds; from which invasion, if they could once socure
themselves, they might the easier and upon better foundation march with their
Forces toward the Rhyn and other places; The King went himself in Person to
Amiens, the Metropolitan of Picardy, and having first agreed upon the manner
how to join his Forces with those of the Hollanders, which lay in great
numbers about Maestricht, and which could not be done, unless passing through
Lucemberg, and so crossing through the Country of Liege, he should join with
the Prince of Orange, on the other side of the Maze; Marshall Schatillione, and
Marshall Bresse, both of them Marshalls of France, began to march with their
Forces thether-wards. The which being understood at Brussels, though the
Spaniards had not been idle, whilst the French were making such preparations,
but were provided with all things necessary to withstand so numerous Forces,
yet the Infanta mustered the old Army of those Provinces, one part whereof was
about the Fort Philippine, which they endeavored to take, but in vain, and
divided it into two bodies, the one of which consisted of about 8000 Foot and
2000 Horse, with 16 piece of Cannon, which he sent under the conduct of Prince
Thomas of Savoy, to oppose the French Army; and he sent the other in face of
the Hollanders, (who lay about Maestricht) thinking therewithal to resist the
French Army, which was likely to have suffered much of incommodity in Legnoise.
For it is likely the people thereof being in Arms for the King of Spain, would
not have helped them to any Provisions, save what they could get by the Sword,
and Prince Thomas following them in the Flancke, and on the Reere, would have
enforced them to keep close together, and consequently to meet with greater
difficulties. But the Spaniards were not successful in their designs; for
the Prince being arrived with his Army between Namure and March, two Towns
upon the Mesa, and (that they might not pretermit any occasion of damnifying of
the Enemy) having made his men advance to surprise the French Vanguard, which
was in a little Village not far from thence, and who, as the Prince was
falsely advertised, were careless in keeping their Guards; and the French being
by their Spies advertised of the Spanish design, and being all close together
in a Body ready to receive them, made their Horse advance in the sight of the
Austrian Army, and to the end the Dutch might not know, that they had all their
Forces together in that place, they made the greatest part of their men retreat
behind a little Hill, and seeming to take another way, they unexpectedly
Charged Buckoyes Horse, who no less valiantly advanced with his Squadrons
against the French; but they giving upon the Flemish Troops, who had not got
to the place of advantage that they determined to have done, came so furiously
upon them, as that opening their files, and breaking their Squadrons, they put
them to rout, as they did likewise the Foot; who seeing themselves not backed by
their Horse, betook themselves to their heels, and ran toward a little
River, where being overtaken by the French, a great many of them, and many of
their Officers were cut in pieces, some Ensigns lost, and the greatest part of
their Baggage. The Prince who could not rally his men, though to that effect he
did what could be expected from a brave Commander, retreated with such of his
Soldiers as he could get together toward Andem and Namours.

The Infanta who was parted from Brussels, and marched toward Tirelemont, with
such Forces as he covld gather together, understanding by the way, that his
side was routed, how strong the Enemy was, and that those of Liege who had
taken up Arms in his behalf, had laid them down again, not intending to
contest against the victor, sent letters full of civility to Prince Thomas,
wherein he comforted him, and promised present succor, to encourage the
cast-downe spirits of his Soldiers. He accompanied these letters with
advertisement, that the French Army, led by Marshall de la Force, being routed
by the Duke of Lorayne, the French would be enforced to give over the
enterprise, and seek to defend their own Country. Wherewithal the Soldiers
(as is usually occasioned by hopes) being much inheartned (though the news was
but artificially coined) it wrought so good effect, that their scattered
Soldiers reunited themselves, and relying upon succor from Germany, which
was already marching apace toward them, under the conduct of Picolominy, and
upon the Neighborhood of other people of those Provinces, they resolved to
entrench themselves near Tirelemont, upon the banks of a little River that
runs into Demer, and there to make head against the French. But hearing
afterward that they were joined with the Hollanders near Maestricht, and that
having past the Mosa they marched merrily toward them, they resolved suddenly
to begone from thence, lest they might be engaged in a Battle, by the loss
whereof they might hazard too much, and not greatly advantage themselves by the
Victory; and so they did, retiring themselves to Loeven, a place of great
advantage, where they might be ready to defend the City, as also, if occasion
should serve, to succor Namours, Malines, Breda, and other places thereabouts.
The French hearing that the Spanish Camp was retired from Tirelemont, advanced
thitherwards, where they were manfully withstood by 400 Spanish Foot, who were
left for a Guard there, but being too weak to resist so great a Force, upon a
brisk Assault made by two Armies, they were, to their infinite glory, all of
them cut in pieces by the Enemy.

The taking of Tirelemont was followed by the like of Die, Aerschot, and
Sichem, Towns upon the Demer, which compounded upon the first appearance of
the Enemy, being so ordered to do by the Spanish Commanders, who would not
employ their Forces in defense of such places which they knew would hardly be
maintained. From thence they marched toward Loeven, intending to take that
City, which was of no small moment, being situated in the heart of Flanders,
between Brussels and Aerschot. But the French Commanders, thinking they should
not do well in sitting down before a well-munitioned Town, and so afford the
Spaniards leisure to reunite themselves, but that it would be better for them
to go straight toward Brussels, and take that, and then to Termanda in
Flanders, and break the Dikes of Callo, and so divide Flanders from Brabant.
They thought this the best course to take; therefore seeming to pass over
Demer, to enter into Champaigne, or make the Spaniards believe they would fall
upon Malines, they wheeled about on the left hand, and turned toward Brussels.

The Spaniards having notice hereof got thither before the French, and encamped
themselves in the fittest places about that City, rendering thereby vain the
French design. The Prince of Orange, who knew how difficult a thing it would
be to compass this affair, had Counseled the contrary, and thought it better
to return to Loeven, and set upon that Town, the taking whereof would be very
prejudicial to Flanders, for thereby the greatest part of the Country would be
brought under composition, and other Achievements would be furthered.

Though this opinion were good, and given by so wise a Commander, yet some
thought there was cunning in it; for 'twas thought the Hollanders did well
enough approve of correspondency with the French, so far as they might be the
better by them, but that they desired not their neighborhood, nor increase of
power; for whilst those Provinces were under the obedience of a Crown whose
power was far off and dis-united, they were sufficient and able, as
experience shows, to defend their liberties; which it would be harder for them
to maintain, when they should have to do with a Potentate whose Forces and
Dominions were united, and did border upon them. They resolved notwithstanding
to follow this advice, and appro^ched the walls of the Town on that side where
the Spaniards had not yet finished their Fortifications. The Baron Gravendon,
who commanded there in chief, did behave himself with such undauntednesse,
and so strongly entrencht himself, according as the short time allowed, and
necessity required, as he entertained the French, and so valiantly he haved
himself, that he kept them from accosting the walls; whereupon the French after
some days finding the enterprise difficult, that their Army was daily lessened
by the death and running away of their Soldiers, that 1000 Spanish Foot were
landed at Dunk^r^, to whom were joined about 1000 Dutch Horse from Cullen, and
that Picolominy with succor from the Emperor, consisting of 4000 Horse and
6000 Foot, was come to Namours, whereby the people had cast away their fo^er
fear, they resolved to raise their Siege, and to retreat to between D^me^ and
the River which runs through that City, quitting Tirelemont, Sichem, and
A^^schot. The Spanish Army being reinforced by so many recruits sent to it
from all parts, and being inheartned at the French-mens retreat, marched
toward Die, wherein the Hollanders had left a good Gurrison. They so
fiercely Assaulted it, as the defendants not finding themselves in a Condition
to make head, though they had promised the Prince of Orange to make good the
Town for some time, were enforced to surrender it, marching out with their
Arms and Baggage. Whereupon the Spanish Commanders re-assuming their former
confidence, and the hopes which were conceived by the French failing, 'twas
evidently seen that that Nation not persisting in their first furies, and their
first heats being over, they cannot easily do those Achievements which are
proper for phlegmatic, and patiently minded men.

Whilst Flanders was jusled on all sides by the Forces of two so great Kings,
threatening mischief and troubles to Italy, and that the great preparations of
both sides promised a storm, Marshall Bannier who was in the Bishopric of
Magdeburg, understanding that Peace was concluded between Caesar and the
Elector of Saxony, as also the uniting of their Forces, foreseeing the breach
which was likely to ensue between the Swedes and Saxons, and knowing the first
hostile act would be upon the City of Magdeburg, as a place of great
concernment to the Elector (it being a very strong hold in the bosom of his
Territories, and to which he likewise laid pretense,) began to repair the
Fortifications thereof, and to take order for such Provisions as should not
only be necessary for the preservation of the Town, but for the maintenance
of all the Swedish Forces in those Provinces. These preparations being heard of
at Dresden, the Elector desiring quiet, which made him make Peace with the
Emperor, sent letters speedily away to Bannier, wherein by well grounded
reasons he persuaded him to accept of the Capitulation of Peace made at
Prague, for the public quiet, and offered him a sum of Money if he would
friendly deliver up Magdeburg into his hands, and remove from that Bishopric*
Bannier, who was not to conclude, nor treat any thing herein without the
consent of the Crown of Swethland, and the other confederate Princes, returned
no answer at all, but meeting with some Troops of Saxon Horse, and skirmishing
with them, wherein the Saxons had the worst, began the breach with the Elector;
of whom the Swedes much complained, saying, he was not worthy the benefits he
had received from their King, who to preserve his Dukedom from invasion, had
not only employed his own Forces, but shed his blood and lost his life; and
that instead of ingraving the memory thereof for ever in his heart, he had
secretly concluded a Peace prejudicial to the Crown of Swethland, and to the
Princes and States of Germany, without acquainting his friends and confederates
therwithall, as in all reason he ought to have done.

These complaints of the Swedes coming to the Electors ear, he presently
published a manifesto, wherein was declared, That he had made this Peace, as a
lover of the good of Germany, without the which all those States were in danger
of being overrun by Foreign Forces. That he had contracted amity with the
King of Swethland only for preservation of the common liberty, the which being
now yielded unto by Caesar, the reasons were consequently taken away for which
he had joined himself in that union. That as he intended it, the Crown of
Swethland was to be satisfied for all the expenses it had been at, and to be
included in the agreement made at Prague; but that the great Chancellor
Oxesterne, and the other Swedish Officers, being ambitious to command in
Germany, to enjoy a better climat then their own, and to enrich themselves by
the spoils of that exhausted Country, would not listen thereunto, though the
business was fair and to be desired: In brief, that he was a Prince who
would not obey the vast desires of such Ministers of State as did not love the
weal public; and lastly, that his proceedings were not prejudicial to the
interest of his friends. These excuses and declarations did not mitigate, but
more inflame the Swedish Commanders, and invite them to revenge; for as good
Wine makes the sharpest Vinegar, so their former good friendship turned to the
greater enmity.

The King of Hungary, who having wintered his men in the Dukedom of
Wirtenberg, and in Alsatia, remained himself in Vienna to assist at the
emergent consultations and resolves of greatest concernment, and to make
necessary Provisions for the Empire; having agreed with his Captains what wa^
^o be done in the future field, and parting from Austria with such Forces as he
could that Winter get together, took the shortest way toward Wirtenberg, to
reinforce his Army, not only with men, but with his own presence. When he
was come to Helbrune, the Commissioners of Vlm, whose condition did daily
impair, and troubles improve, allured by the good Articles granted to those of
Auspurg and Nurenberg, prostrated themselves before his Majesty, and demanding
pardon, were received with such courtesy as is usually practiced by generous
Princes, and sent back with all their desires subscribed unto. Gallasse having
received directions from the King to move with his Army, and endeavor
somewhat, whilst his Majesty staid at Helbrune to treat of accommodation with
many Cities, whose Commissioners flockt to him for pardon, past over the Rhyn
at Filisburg, and knowing that to take Worms, a Town near Mentz and
Franckendalle seated upon the Rhyn, and environed with Rampired Walls, would be
a business of some moment to make the recovery of Mentz and Franckendalle, the
more easy, set upon it, and readily planted his Cannon against it. The Swedish
Garrison, which exceeded not 900 men, too small a number to guard so great a
circumference of Wall, finding all the opposition they could make, bootlesse,
and so much the rather, because they durst not trust in the Inhabitants, after
having seemed to hide this their weakness, compounded before any assault was
made, and retreated to Mentz.

Miminghen, following the example of other Haunse Towns, understanding the
conditions granted to Vlm, and being in the midst of the Austrian Forces
without hopes of succor, did likewise Article with the King of Hungary, and
was received to favor, having its ancient privileges subscribed unto. The
like did Schorndorfe, one of the strongest Towns of Wirtenberg, seated in the
Center of that state, upon the River Rems, in a large Champian environed with
Hills, which makes it seem a Valley; this Town did for some months endure
the Siege, but now compounded and received Laws from the Enemy.

The Austrians were not wanting in all requisite diligence, but knowing that
England (though separated by a large arm of the Sea, which makes it as it were
another world) if the French should grow to a greater power, would suffer by
the shade of so over-spreading a tree; the people whereof, to boot with their
own politic interest of not desiring their neighbors increase in greatness
(whether it proceeded from envy, or from their natural hatred, occasioned by
the diversity of the Nations dis-agreeing in Tongue and Customs, or from the
memory of the ancient cruel Wars between them and the French) were generally
jealous of the French; endeavored by the persuasions of such Counselors as
were of their party, to move the King of England in their behalf, so to
weaken the French Forces by this friendship; for that being entertained in
having an eye to these, they could not so easily reflect upon Flanders. This
their endeavor did in realitie meet with many lets and difficulties, though in
appearance all things were fairly carried on. (...) the English no less
mindful of the Spanish actions, who under the color of good neighborhood,
had formerly endeavored by an Armado at Sea to land their men in that
Kingdom, and under pretense of comforting the oppressed Romanists to conquer
it, did very well know that the French could not be held under without
promoting the Spaniards, whom for many respects they ought more to dread then
the Brench; and in particular, because the English greatness consisting at
Sea, which they must pass over who will set footing in that Kingdom, they had
more reason to fear the Spaniards, that were as well potent by Sea as Land,
then the French, far inferriour to them in shipping and strength at Sea. And
for that the King of England was first to have satisfaction given him in his
pretenses of having the Palatinate restored to his Nephews, which was a
business the Austrians desired not to hear of, their thoughts proved
imperfect, especially since the Palatinate was conferred upon the Duke Bavaria,
and likewise the Electorall Cap; so as it seemed not fair to bereave him of
the title of Elector, though the Palatinate should be taken from him, and as
good an estate given him. Diverse Propositions were therefore propounded
hereupon by the wariest Court-Counsellours. Some were of opinion, That England
was by all means possible to be satisfied, not only so to win the love and
affection of the King thereof, but to interest him in a League which might
moderate the excessive power of France already grown to too great an height,
and to take from the Protestants their pretense of taking up Arms against the
Emperor, by restoring the Palatinate, and Electoricall Dignity, the which was
known to many to be of great importance; since that it little concerned the
Emperor and his affairs, whether that state were in the hands of the Duke of
Bavaria, or in the Prince Palatines, and yet the not restoring thereof was of
great concernment. That by reason of this the Austrians became hateful to the
Protestant Princes, and 'twas a prevalent cause of raising War, which being
fomented by France and England, did much endammage the Empire, as experience
had already shown; for the expenses the Austrians had been at in the late
Wars, did twenty times exceed the full value of the Palatinate; that
notwithstanding, not to quit good correspondency with Bavaria, nor break faith
with him, who was always ready to disburse his own monyes, and endanger his
state for Caesar's service, the Palatinate might be changed for the upper
Austria, as it had been formerly done; And that the title of Elector might
rest in the Duke of Bavaria during his life, and afterward return to the
Palatine; for that though they should not intend to do so* they should by this
promise win time to put the affairs of the Empire in order, and get to be in
a condition of altering their word at their pleasure: Others thought it good to
feed England with good words, but that their actions should only aim at their
own interests; for though the Palatinate should be restored, the English would
not notwithstanding declare themselves Enemies to France; for since it made for
the interest of their Kingdom, that both these Crowns should be weakened by
the War, they would endeavor to keep the balance equally poised between
them, that so by their ruins they might the more secure the peace and
accommodation of their own quiet Kingdom: And as for the distaste they might
receive by the not restitution of the Palatinate, they should not any ways
apprehend that, for the English would never join with the French to oppress
the Spaniards, lest thereby they should augment their already excessive Forces,
which necessarily they ought to be jealous of; but they would rather foment
that party, whose declination might make the other more dreadful. Others
affirmed, It were more convenient to give in Lieu of the Palatinate some Lands
in Swabendland, and in Wirtenberg, to the Duke of Bavaria, and that the title
of Elector should remain to him during his life.

In fine, the most voices were for the restitution of the Palatinate; but the
putting of it in execution was much hindered through the fear the Imperialists
had of distasting the Duke of Bavaria, whose assistance was now more necessary
for them then formerly. And thus was this so weighty resolution retarded, and
inveloped with other considerations; when Maximilian wisely foreseeing that
the Austrian Ministers of State might resolve upon somewhat which might give
satisfaction to England, and finding there was no better way to cross it, then
by obliging the Emperor to have a greater care to the interest of his own
house, he bethought himself of marrying the Emperors Daughter, as well to
win more upon Caesar's good will by this new alliance, as to oblige his
Imperial Majesty, rather to favor his grandchildren then strangers.

This marriage was therefore managed with reciprocal desire; the Duke desired
it, the more to oblige the Emperor and King of Hungary to continue friendship
with him, as likewise, that he might have issue to succeed him in his
Dominions, which as yet he had not. Caesar listened willingly thereunto, as
well to show his affection to Bavaria, as likewise to make him by this tie more
firm to what concerned Caesar; and to keep him from being wrought upon by the
persuasions and promises of France, as it was said was mainely endeavored by
vast hopes, whereby to withdraw him from his siding with the Emperor; and
certainly, if the Duke should, as things then stood, have given ear thereunto,
such a resolution might have tended much to the prejudice of Caesar. The
business was therefore wholly concluded, though some good wits murmured
thereat, pretending to foresee, that such fruits might proceed from this
marriage as might prove bitter to the Emperors house.

Whilst France and Germany were thus busied, each of them making what
preparations they could for the present affairs; a Hollander named Entholts,
who being banished his Country, lived amongst the Spaniards in Flanders, and
who was very ill satisfied with the states of Holland, because they had
beheaded his Father, for having (as it was laid to his charge) conspired with
other two of his companions, to deliver up the Fort of Tiell, seated upon the
Wall, between Bonniell and Niminghen, unto the Spaniards, whilst he lived in
a Country that professed Neutralitie; this Entholts, holding intelligence with
some kindred and friends of his, who often used to advertise him how affairs
went in those Provinces, thought how he might effect somewhat which might
correspond with his desires, as it is usual with men whose passion exciteth
them to revenge; And being advertised, that the Fort of Skinck (a very strong
place, situated upon the point of the Island made by the Rhyn, which dividing
it self here into two parts, that on the left hand takes the name of the Wall,
the other on the right hand continuing the name of the Rhyn till it falls into
the Sea, so as it is made almost impregnable) had in it at that time not above
200 Foot for the guard thereof; that the Ditch might in some parts be easily
waded over, that one Palizado was weak, and (which imported most) that the Man
of War which had always wont to lie in the mouth of the said River, to keep
it from surprisall by water, was retuned to Amsterdam, for some disputes
between Niminghen and the said Amsterdam, Niminghen denying to pay such
Sessements as those of Amsterdam (Niminghen being the Metropolitan of Guelders,
for the safety of which Province the said Ship was maintained) pretended it
should do; he acquainted the Spanish Commanders therewithal, and offered them
his best assistance, whereupon they resolved not to let slip the occasion, but
to try the enterprise. Count Embden, a gallant Gentleman, and he who not long
before surprised Trevers, had therefore the charge hereof given him; he
presently caused some light Boats to be built, and took his way thitherwards
with 400 choice Foot, for had he taken greater numbers with him, he might have
been discovered by the Hollanders, who with their Army were not far from
thence; and moreover, he made use of two other greater Barques called
Shamorouses, wherewithal they ordinarily Traffic and carry Victuals from
Neutrall places, wherein secretly passing the River, he placed his Scaling
Ladders, and bravely set upon the Town, which took Alarm, and the Garrison
thereof ran to defend it, and did their utmost; but many Austrians being
entered the Town, who were followed by the rest, the Hollanders having stoutly
opposed them, and being so much the more affrighted, by how much they were the
more unexpectedly set upon, not able to make head against the Enemy, who fought
upon the Rampires, and within the streets that they had won, they were
enforced to yield, the greatest part of them, together with their Governor,
being slain.

The loss of this Fort, a place of so great importance, being understood by
the Prince of Or^nge, who was with his Army about Niminghen, did (as is usual
in such unexpected cases) much amaze him, and all the Hollanders; for this
place being one of the keys of those Provinces, the Spaniards by possessing
themselves thereof, did not only much endanger the whole Betaw, but hindered
the navigation of the Rhyn, and cut off some Towns thereupon, which were
possessed by the Hollanders; as also if they could keep themselves there, when
the Austrians were strong in the field, they might easily have thereby Ingresse
into the heart of those Provinces, whereof though they should not make
themselves masters, yet would it be very prejudicial to all Holland, if they
should but fire those wind-mills which are made to empty the Country of water,
and to throw it into some Channels, which afterward when the Sea flows falls
back into it, of which benefit if that so low a Country should be but a while
deprived, it would be wholly drowned, it being only maintained by these Mills
which empty the water out of the Ditches, and some Banks which keep back the
Sea, and without the which all that Country would be a Lake. Whereupon the
Prince of Orange foreseeing the future damage, and knowing how necessary it
was to recover it, hasted with his Army thitherwards to that purpose. But a
good Garrison, and good store of Victuals being put thereinto, the Hollanders,
though they did their uttermost, were stoutly resisted, and beaten back; Yet
did they not (like gallant Soldiers) despair of success, being sure that the
Spaniards could not keep it, lying so far from succor, and so near their
outrages, and chiefly, for that being continually infested by the French,
they could not employ those men to the maintenance of that Fort, which being to
be divided for the preservation of other Cities, and Provinces, were not able
to withstand the Hollanders proceedings, in a place, whither by reason of the
great importancy thereof they had summoned all their Forces.

But if the Spaniards prevailed here, the French failed not to do the like
elsewhere. Duke Crequi falling from Piemont into Montferrat with 8000 Foot and
2000 Horse, past over the Poe, and carrying his men on this side Sesia to
within the jurisdiction of the State of Milan, he took Villata, (a place
which in the former Wars of Montferrat, was held by the Spaniards,) meeting
with little or no resistance.

But the French-mens chief aim was, to get into the State of Milan, and to
drive the Spaniards thence, which when they should have done, they would not
only have secured themselves of the State of Savoy, but successefully carry on
their Forces to further enterprises; the which they might easily have done, if
they had not given ear to the persuasions of such, who openly appearing to
believe much in the French Nation, spread abroad those Politic reports, and
which Princes are so well pleased to hear, to wit, that with little expense,
and not many men, they might effect their desires; for they believed that any
small number of their men (as they were told by others) with the assistance of
their Colleagues, would be sufficient to do the deed; If they had not moreover
been made believe that the Milanois, being weary of the Spanish subjection, and
desirous of Novelty, would suddenly follow the French Banners as soon as they
should see a complete Army in Piemonte, which might be sufficient to keep in
the confederates, awe the Imperialists, and to keep the Field in the
Territories of Milan; And if the French Commanders, instead of passing their
time away in making addresses to the Ladies of Montferrat, and Piemonte, in
arguing upon yea and nay, and in filling their purses with Gold, had directly
marched on and set down before the Walls of Milan, which was not furnished
with men, nor resolution.

Diverse propositions were set on Foot in the Courts of France and Piemonte,
that the best and most advantageous might be chosen. The taking of Valenza, a
Town near the Poe, between Tortona and Casalle, was propounded, as that which
would in a good part have hindered such succor as might be sent from the State
of Genua, to that of Milan; it opened the passage to enter into that State, and
it cut off Alissandria, making the passage easy from Montferrat to Piacenza,
which was the chief considerable thing in this affair; for the Duke of Parma
not daring openly to declare himself in hostile manner against the Spaniards,
because his state was too far distant from Montferrat, from whence upon
occasion he was to expect succor, it was consequently fitting, and in all
reason approved of, that their first enterprise should be such as might give
satisfaction to their Colleagues. Novara was talked of, whose Frontiers joined
upon that State, and there was nothing else to withstand them even to the very
Gates of Milan: But this being a strength which was well-guarged by the
Spaniards, and which had formerly proved unfortunate to the French, it was laid
aside. Some of the wisest were of opinion, that they should pass by all the
Forts, and strong holds, and suddenly overrun all the whole State of Milan,
possess themselves of the most advantageous passages, fortify themselves
there, infest the Country continually, and so bring the Towns and Cities to
compound; for the Country being well peopled, full of Nobility, and
Inhabitants, that lived commodiously, when they should see their grounds
wasted, and their goods destroyed, they would easily be brought rather to
think upon the preservation of their own estates and private interests, then
upon the King of Spaines Forts; and this opinion was assented unto by many, as
known to be the likelyest to prosper; but this resolution requiring more Men
and Money, and being by powerful reasons dissuaded by the Duke of Savoy, not
grounded upon any good intention to the French, but upon his own particular
interest, with the which it did not well agree, that the State of Milan should
fall into the King of France his hands, the enterprise of Valenza was agreed
upon; Before the which the French being to spend much time, the Spaniards
consequently reaped thereby the benefit to provide for the defense of the other
places, and to succor Valenza likewise; and the French losing many of their
men before this place, 'twas easily descryed, they would be able to effect
little or nothing; it being held as a strong reason of State, that the
French-mens further progress in that Province, made not for the good of any
Italian Prince, by reason of the good neighborhood which they find who
confine upon great Potentates, particularly upon such, who desirous to enlarge
their dominions, invent pretenses to break their word, and to usurp what
belongs unto their neighbors. Yet this Counsel was held by wise men not to
fit so well with the present interest of the States of Italy, who gave for
their reason, that the State of Milan being a new Carthage, which kept all its
neighbors in continual motion, and being possessed by the Spaniards, a
powerful Nation, ambitious of glory, and which hardly ever parts with what it
has once gotten, Italy would always be troubled with their pretensions; that
the French were on the contrary unquiet, impatient of staying long out of
France, thinking there was no other world but their own Kingdom; that it would
not be impossible to drive out them when they should have driven out the
Spaniards, and so redress that Kingdom under the power of some Italian
Prince, as it formerly had been. They added, that to add to the power of great
Princes, was to nurse up a Serpent in ones bosom which at last would devour
the nourisher; for great Potentates remember not their neighbors good turns,
but are mindful how they may commodiat themselves by the ruin of such as
border upon them. Others more partial to the French, replied, That all the
foolish French were dead, and all the wise Spaniards.

All things requisite being in a readiness, they gave order for their march
thitherwards, which was for a few days retarded; for their were some who
thought it was not good to undertake a business wherein any difficulty lay,
with the French Forces only, since Savoy and Parma had not covenanted openly
to declare themselves, till they should see some Town possessed by the French;
and though some were of opinion, that the Duke of Parma, who had a strength of
about 4000 Foot and 800 Horse, was able to have made an Impression in the State
of Milan, by which the Spanish Forces being in many places cut short, the work
would consequently be the easier for the French, yet did not this opinion
prevail; for the Duke not daring to declare himself openly an Enemy to the
Spaniard, till the French were so far advanced as that they might easily
succor him upon any occasion, kept his Forces upon his own grounds, holding
the Spaniards only in jealousy. But Crequi encouraged by the hopes he had of
the Duke of Parma's being well-inclined toward his King, and by the desire he
found in that Prince to break with Spain, pitched his Camp before Valenza,
raised Works, and planted his Cannon, and began courageously to set upon it.
The Marquis of Calada, who was a little before put in there as superintendent,
Signor Francesco di Cardine who was the governor of the Town, and Captain
Spadino, a worthy Gentleman, knowing how acceptable the preservation of that
place would be to the King of Spain, and how much glory they should thereby
gain unto themselves, began to show as much courage and industry in the
defense thereof, as the French did in their desire to win it.

The news of the French Armies arrival in the state of Milan, being come to
the knowledge of the Towns and Cities thereof, brought with it no small fear
to the Inhabitants, and to the Spaniards themselves. For those places wanting
men sufficient for their defense, the whole Country was in a confusion: for
the Soldiers of the Trained Bands, by their taking up Arms, were rather cause
of grief and lamentation to their wives and children, (who quit the Country)
then of comfort or encouragement to defense, they being generally known for
white-liver'd men. Yet amidst these emergencies, was not the Cardinal
Albernois, and the other Spanish Agents, wanting in courage, but according to
their innate undauntednesse, began to make such Provisions as they thought
necessary, and as the shortness of time would permit them. Expresses were sent
by Post into Spain, Naples, and Germany, to solicit the amassing of men and
moneys; a new scrutiny was made of all the people of the state, and out of
every hundred men, eight of the ablest were chosen to place in the Forts, and
Forreiners were removed from thence to be made use of in the Field. Il Maestro
de Campo Roma was sent to Mortara, a Town between Pavia and Verculles, to be
super-intendent there; Don Carlo Colombo, was sent to Alessandria, and diverse
other men of worth to the Fort Sandavall, and other places upon the Confines,
and all those places were reinforced with men; the Drums beat up every
where, and Provisions were made for the present occurrences. The Spaniards
desisted not notwithstanding to negotiate by their Agents with the Pope, and
Republique of Venice, that if they intended not to succor them, neither should
they assist the French; and chiefly they feared, lest the Venetians should
declare themselves, who were instigated by mighty offers from the French to
appear in their behalfes, and to bring their Forces on this side Alda, the
Venetians being very strong, having 8000 Foot of sundry Nations, and 2000 Horse
well in order in Lombardy beyond Mincio, under the command of Luigi Zorzi their
General, a valiant man, much esteemed and feared, who to boot with his refined
judgment, was courageous and resolute in his Warre-resolves; they had
moreover, more men quartered in Crema and thereabouts, under the conduct of
Michell Priuli, a son not unlike his father, who had formerly been Duke of
Venice, an Heroic Prince, who had a noble heart, and was of an experimented
wisdom; and others in Valcamonica, a Valley of Breskiano, which joins upon
the Valteline, under the command of Martin de Molino, a Gentleman of great wit
and knowledge; and moreover, their Forts were all well provided, with Men and
Ammunition, with chief Commanders and Senators, who if they should have
declared themselves for the French, the wisest men were firm of opinion, and
the Spaniards themselves very well knew, the state of Milan would be subject to
the discretion of the French, or to the Republique of the state of Venice. Yet
were all these suspicions ill-grounded; for though the Venetians might easily
enough have done this, yet the object of the famous Republique and of those
most wise Senators, aiming only at the common peace of Italy, and the
preservation of their own flourishing Dominion, so opportune an occasion was
not sufficient to make them alter their worthily propounded end. Nay, they
would have their Ministers of State to endeavor somewhat to divert the breach
of those two Crowns, and by them to remit Italy into its former quiet, whereby
all Christendom would be advantaged.

The Duke of Rohan was this mean while returned to Tirano to refresh his men,
who were wearied by their being continually kept in action in that Valley;
where he understood, how that the Dutch which he had routed in the Valley of
Levin, being got together again, by the arrival of some Troops from Tiroll,
were very strong in Bormio; and that it was given out they would fall lower,
and try their fortunes with the French again, to which purpose they were come
to Mazzo, a Village near the Ada, between Bormio and Tirano. He therefore
resolved to encounter them, and to make use of Fortune which showed her self
favorable unto him. Having therefore mustered his men, which might amount to
4000 Foot and 300 Horse, he marched thitherward in sight of the Enemies
Sentinells; but the Imperiallists, keeping themselves near a Town called
Grossotto, upon the Ada, in a place of great advantage, and the French not
thinking that a fitting place to fall upon the Enemy, Rohan, that he might draw
them off from that advantageous seat, seemed as if he feared them, and wheeling
about, made as if he fled to Cologno, a little Village above Tirano. Here
possessing himself of the most adequat place, he ordered a great ambush in
certain little Woods near at hand, and staid, expecting the Enemy, who being
inheartned by the French-mens retreat, and not believing them to be in a
condition able to resist them, they with this confidence pass over the Ada at
Mazzo Bridge, and flew eagerly upon the French Troops, crying out, that now
they would revenge themselves for their former rou^. But Rohan dexterously
drawing them near the ambush, did unexpectedly salute them with a thick volley
of Musket Shot, and facing about, set so furiously upon them with his fresh
Battaglions, as the Dutch astonished at the accident, thought to retreat by the
same way they came, and so betook themselves to flight, wherein they left
above 700 of their men slain, and prisoners; and if the two Colonells, Pracher
and Gianasso, whom Rohan had sent on the other side to break the Bridge over
the Ada, had made a little more have, few of the Imperiallists would have
boasted of safety. Rohan did not much value this happy encounter, unless he
might thereby recover Bormio and the Bathes; Therefore calling together his
Chief Commanders, and treating with them how to effect this his desire, it was
resolved, (wherein Colonel Montesin, a Frenchman, who had then the Van,
proffered his service) to undertake that enterprise; and he encouraged by
Rohan, advanced so boldly toward the Walls of the Town, as though the ascent,
by reason of the Cliffs, was difficult, and above 300 paces long, blockt up by
three barricadoes well defended, he by maine force entered the Town, putting
all he met with at his first entrance to the Sword; And from thence, advancing
toward the Bathes, a place guarded by 200 Dutch Foot, he likewise took it,
though all industry and military valor was used to keep him from doing so, by
a Sergeant Major who commanded there in chief; a Victory which proved
notwithstanding woeful, by reason of the death of the said Colonel Montesin,
(wounded unfortunately by a Stone which fell from a woman out of a window) and
of above 105 other Frenchmen.

It was of great consequence to the Hollanders; that Skinck-Sconce should
remain in the Spaniards hands; and wisely sore seeing, that if it were not
regained, it would (as affairs now stood) be very prejujudiciall to all those
Provinces, they endeavored by all art and military industry to win it; the
defenders whereof fought obstinately, and the Hollanders endeavors were
desperate, insomuch as every day the flower of all the Soldiery was lost on
both side.

The Duke of Saxony, who was not only reconciled to the Emperor, but had
joined his Forces with the Caesarian Commanders, finding that his Treaties of
Peace with the Swedes (though held in hand with some hopes by Bannier, who did
it that he might win time, and fortify Magdeburg, and furnish it with all
things necessary, it being a place at that time of the greatest importance to
the Swedish affairs) were in effect deluded, resolved to remove his Camp, and
set upon Hall upon the Sala, a place which being won, would facilitate the
taking of Magdeburg; he therefore marched against the Town, which wanting
Rampires sufficient to withstand the Cannon, Articled, and yielded; and the
Swedes that were of the Garrison forsook the Town, and retired to the Castle,
a place somewhat fitter for resistance, that they might preserve themselves
there, till the succor which they expected from Bannier should come unto them.

Though Valenza was bravely maintained by the defendants, and that the
Spaniards did little fear the bare French Forces, yet the almost certain
fear they had, that the Forces of the Dukes of Savoy and of Parma should join
with them, or that they should set upon the state in some other part, had no
little reflection upon their thoughts; for they plainly saw, that when they
should declare open enmity against the Spaniards, it would be hard for them in
such an emergency to make good all places. Therefore to boot with all other
Provisions had, Marquis Lunatt, Master of the Camp, was sent into Alessandria
to assist Colombo, together with the Senator Arios, Commissary of the Army
Royal. Every one was permitted to bear all manner of Arms save Pistolls.
Prince Trivultio, endeavoring to raise a Brigade of Foot at his own charges,
made Colonel Carlo Mariani Campe-Master thereof. Colombo readily prevented a
Treachery which was discovered in Alessandria, and detained the guilty,
amongst which was one Don Diego a Spaniard, and a servant of his, and Ensign
Gagni Alessandrino. Nothing was omitted that was thought behoofefull to obviate
the imminent danger; and in particular, the secret intelligence held with the
Duke of Savoy was brought to a narrow compass, and somewhat of unknown was
agreed upon by the Duke in favor of the King of Spain.

Crequi this mean while played upon Val^nza on all sides, in so much as those
that were wel-wishers to the French, gave out a report, that Valenza would
yield or be lost; which being got hold of by the common people, began to be
believed by the great ones and the wisest. And this the rather, for that the
wary Crequi seeing how little good his Forces could do, unassisted by Savoy
and Parma, from whom as yet he had received nothing but hopes, save 10
Companies of Curasses from Savoy, under the command of Monsieur Flort, a French
Gentleman, and Marshall of the Field, resolved upon some prevalent means, to
persuade the Duke of Parma to declare himself openly against the Spaniards;
for when he should have done so, Savoy would have all excuses taken from him,
why he should not condescend to the desires and incessant pressures made unto
him by the French. And the more to make Parma, as being the further off,
declare himself for the French, Crequi by express messengers sent him word,
that the Town was already so distressed by his assaults, as it would
doubtlessely suddenly be taken; that therefore he desired him, to come and
honor the Forces of France with his presence, for that by so doing, he might
the more ingratiate himself into the favor of the King of France, by
declaring himself when the event of things were yet uncertain.

The Duke believing that Crequi spoke like a real friend, being moreover
desirous of glory, and inheartned by hopes of bettering his condition, with the
division of the State of Milan, suffered himself, contrary to the opinion of
his own Counselors, to be persuaded by Crequi; and to that purpose mustering
his men at Saint- John's Castle, where were found to be 4000 Foot and 800 Horse,
he on the 30th of August sent some Squadrons on this side Poe into the
Territories of Coniado, Aug. 30. September. 1.
the demeanes of Prince Trivullio, and on the first of September those of Parma
marched very secretly through the Country of Tortona, and not meeting with any
encounter, came before that Town, where staying a while, and the Duke
quartering himself near Poe, in Signor Scampa's Palace, a Battery was
suddenly raised on that side also against the Tenalia which was held by the
besieged, and moreover he threw a Bridge of Boats over the River in that
part, as the Duke of Savoy did likewise on the other side, who came thither
also soon after with about 5000 men; and this was done that they might pass
on this side the River, and hinder the succor, which those of Valenza might
receive by the Bridge which was guarded by the Spaniards.

The Spaniards being very much grieved at the Duke of Parma's hostility, and
the more for that they had always been held by the Dukes his predecessors, as
arbitrators of the affairs of that Dukedom, could not tolerate the
proceedings of the present Edward; they therefore complained bitterly to the
Pope, to the end that that Dukedom holding of the Church, and consequently the
Pope being obliged to defend it, he should not afterward have reason to move
them to withdraw their Forces, if they should invade that Dukedom, since the
Duke thereof had first given the occasion. The Pope being wrought upon by such
persuasions wished the Duke not to molest the State of Milan, lest he might
afterward give the Spaniards occasion of waging War against him the Duke,
and therein interest the holy Sea.

The Duke of Parma pretending to have just cause to break with the Spaniards,
dispatched away a Gentleman of his to Genua, to advertise that Republicke of his
coming into the field, and soon after published a Manifesto, expressing
therein, what benefits the Crown of Spain had recived from his house, and how
on the contrary that Crown had evilly requited him; how Regent Villani had
threatened him, for that he had not consented to what had been propounded
prejudicial to his State, in respect of sending him into Flanders, as hostage
of the others faith; how instant the Emperors Ambassador had been with him to
disburse more Money then he was able, and how he had sent an Ambassador into
Spain, to represent unto his Catholic Majesty how much he might expect from
him, which Ambassador was entertained there many Months, and at last returned
back without any answer.

The Spaniards knowing very well that the State of Milan was not to be
succored by help from Germany, by reason that the passages of the Valteline
were stopped by Rohan, and that therefore they were to endeavor succor by Sea,
where it behoved them to have a considerable Fleet to scour the Seas without
danger of the French Vessels; had already prepared a good Squadron of Galleys
and round-botomb'd Boats in the Mediterranian under the command of Marquis
Santa Cro^^; and thinking it was very fit for their purpose to take the Islands
of S. M^rguerit, and S. Honor, places which would not only have facilitated
their navigation, but be a hindrance to the French who pass from Marselles
into the Territories of Genua, and consequently would be a great trouble to the
transportation of such provisions as they should endeavor to send to their
Armies, in the State of Milan, and Montferrat, sailed thitherward, and landing
some of their Foot, made themselves easily masters thereof; for the French, not
expecting such an attempt, had neglected to put such defense, into those
Islands, as was requisite for them.

scoured the Mediterranean Sea, and the Imperialists advanced in the Lower
Palatinate, and in Alsatia, where every day Towns and Castles yielded to them,
The French, having made their approaching Trenches, raised their batteries, and
courageously set upon Valenza, made a fierce assault upon some little Forts and
out-workes of the Town; which being with no less valor sustained by the
Spaniards, occasioned the death of many brave Frenchmen. Soon after, some
Companies commanded by Don Antonio Lottello, and backed by the Marquis Celada,
and Don Antonio de Chiavari, Nephew to Cardinal Albernots, sallyed out against
the quarters of those of Parma, and a great skirmish was had between them; for
the Spaniards fighting stoutly, and encouraged by Celadi's gallant behavior
(who with his Sword in hand gave testimony of his courage) and being no less
valiantly withstood by those of Parma, led on by Signior Richardo Avogardo,
General of the Horse, much slaughter was made, and much blood shed. Avogardo
being shot with an Harquebusse, was immediately slain, together with six of
his Captains, and about 200 Soldiers; Chiavari having a fair Chain, which
invited his Enemies to get it, was likewise ^laine with a Pistoll-shot
(together with five Reformado-Captaines) and stripped, and Laines a Spanish
Captain of great esteem, whose death was no less lamented by the Cardinal
his Uncle, then by all the Spanish Commanders and Soldiers, he being a gallant
Young Man, well behaved, and of great hopes. But if the Spaniards were grieved
at his loss, the Duke of Parma was not a little sadded for the death of
Avogardo; he was by birth a Brescian, of one of the best Families of all
Lombardy, who to boot with the orders of Chivalry, enjoyed the privileges of
the Venetian Nobility; he came young out of his Country, and being trained up
in the Emperor Ferdinand the seconds Armies, he had not only by experience
worthily purchased the name of valiant, but by his bold courage and keen
Sword, won the repute of one of the gallantest Cavaliers of those Armies,
having (after a single combat with Colonel Forcats, who was esteemed one the
best (at his Weapon) in the Army, and wherein he purchased immortal glory) in
all actions behaved himself with such undaunted animositie, as that his
Colonel Picolomini, inamored of his valor, made him his Lieutenant Colonel;
which office, he so worthily discharged in the Battle of Lutzen where the King
of Swethland was slain, as that it is truly affirmed, that Picolomini and
Avogardo, saved the Romanists Army, from the imminent danger of being routed
that it was in; and where he was wounded in the thigh with a Musket Shot,
which had well-nigh cost him his life. He was a Gentleman of a comely presence,
of a tall stature, of a pleasing aspect, and graciously spoken; In brief, the
expectation which his worthy indowments did promise, is able to draw tears
from any ones eyes that makes account of gallant men.

Gustavenberg, a Town built by the King of Swethland (out of some great
design) over against Mentz, as has been said, was this mean while
straightly besieged; and being brought to great extremity, Waymer not being
able to succor it, who was gone to that purpose with his men to Mentz, was at
last enforced to yield to the Caesarians, the Swedish garrison marching out,
which were 1200 Foot, with their Bag and Baggage: Whereupon Waymer failing in
his design, and fearing to be environed by the Imperialists, who having past
the Rhyn, came even to the gates of Mentz, resolved to retreat to Cruntzenach,
which he did in great have. He was followed notwithstanding by the Imperial
Horse, who setting upon his Rear, which skirmishing gallantly, kept the
Caesarians off; yet being overtaken by fresh Troops, they were enforced in much
have to betake them to their heels, wherein their Squadrons, which with much
ado got under the Walls of Cruntzenach, did somewhat suffer.

The taking of Gustavenberg, and Waymers retreat from Mentz, did so much
inhearten the Austrians, as they bethought themselves to make some inrodes from
Flanders into France. The Crabats, out of hope of booty, which is the true
bait that intices Soldiers on, (especially those of that Nation) and persuaded
of good success, went into Picardy, and to the no little prejudice of those
Towns and Villages, many of which they sacked and burnt, they past a good way
in. At which, the King of France being highly offended, and sending readily
many French Foot and Horse toward them, who cut down the bridge of Some,
between Abaville and Amiens, they were enforced to face about, and to retreat
upon a round gallop to their former quarters, with no little loss and
suffering; many of them being slain by the French, and their Baggage lost.

Mounsieur De Belieure, the extraordinary Ambassador of France, sent by the
King to the Princes of Italy, having received his dispatch, went to Genua;
where having agreed with that Re-publique to keep a perfect good intelligence
with the Crown of France (as those Senators seemed to pretend to do in this
War) and having taken his leave of that Senate (with satisfaction to the
French, and no small jealousy to the Spaniard) he came to Parma about the
midst of August, where he had audience by the Duke, August.
and with mighty promises and hopes inheartned him to keep friendship with
his Majesty, and to join his Forces with Crequi; and having received signs
from him of probable good inclination to the King, he departed well satisfied;
when he came to Mantua, he staid some days with Duke Charles, discoursing upon
the present affairs, and exhorting him to continue in his devotion to his
King. And because one of the French-mens chief foundations in this War, was
to divert the Venetian Forces led on underhand by the Duke of Mantua, or
publicly declared by the Re-publique it self, against the state of Milan,
out of enlarging their Confines, he treated with his Highness to raise men in
Italy in his Majesty's name, to which purpose Money should be sent him to raise
a body of an Army in that Dukedom, wherewithal he might at least make
jealous the Spaniards in Cremona, if it should not be thought fitting
publicly to declare himself; which offer the Duke would have accepted, as it
was thought, being inclined to Arms, and no less to moneys, if he had
believed the Money would have been sent him, and that the Venetians and the Pope
would have assisted him, in procuring of Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, in
their flourishing dominions, without which he could not possibly undertake such
an employment; From thence he came about the end of August to Venice, to move
that Republicke to break with Spain, and assist France; upon which the French
not without reason built very great hopes; for if that State should have
declared it self, the Spaniards would certainly have lost Milan. But because
that wise and pious Senate intended not the perturbation, but preservation, of
the public quiet of Italy, the Ambassador had civil audience, was
magnificently received, with such decorum as is usually practiced by that
splendid Republic to those who represent so great a King; but carried no
answer away save words full of courtesy, and such as tended to the public
quiet.

The French this mean while did straightly beset Valenza, and played upon it on
all sides; and Crequi, who thought he had brought it to an ill pass, summoned
the Town, threatening fire and Sword if it would not yield, yet did these words
little avail to abate the Spaniards daring, who more courageous then ever,
answered the Trumpeter that brought the summons, that the Spaniards used not to
surrender any place for threats; that they could not give way to bravadoes;
that the French should do well instead of words to use deeds, wherein they
should be answered; and should be taught that the Governor of Valenza had
learnt from his Ancestors, that threats never prevail with well-borne
Gentlemen. At the time of this summons, the Spaniards, who knew it was
requisite to bring them speedy and opportune succor, before the French should
have possessed themselves of their out-Workes, to the preservation whereof good
numbers of men were requisite, and that the loss of them would be very
prejudicial to the Town, and much impede the succouring thereof, resolved to
advance, and resolutely to endeavor the bringing in of men. Don Carlo Colombo
was therefore commanded to march thitherward, and to endeavor to seat himself
in Frescarolo about two miles from Valenza, who coming with 4000 Foot and 10
Companies of Horse on the seventh of October to Pieue del Cairo, Ostob. 7.
staid there till the tenth of the same month. Where hearing that the French
having past the Poe, advanced both with Horse and Foot, with intention to take
the said Frescarolo, and by the taking thereof, (which was not possessed by the
Spanish Army, having only some sick men and Sutlers in it,) to fortify
themselves in the Castle, which was walled about with good old Walls, and so
make the Spaniards quit the fields, who lay round about every where, hoping to
relieve the Town; and the Marquis of Terracusa, who was then without any
command in the Spanish Camp, perceiving the French-mens drift, and learning
moreover that some few files of Foot with two Sakers were already on their
march thitherward, advertised Colombo thereof, by whom he was held in good
esteem, as one who had borne great offices in Flanders; they immediately took
counsel how to govern themselves upon this occasion; Whereupon the next day
the Horse moving from their former station, and being backed with some files of
Musketeers, he possessed himself of the way by which the Enemies Foot
advanced, where they fell to skirmish, and the Neapolitans bravely withstood
the Enemies Charge, and broke their design: for at the same time, the
Spaniards that were led by the aforesaid Terracusa (to whom for his greater
honor the government of that affair was that day committed) set upon a
Battaglion of the Savoyards, who by order from their Duke (he being in person
in the French Camp) began to retreat, and re-passing over the Poe without
fighting, as they might have done, they returned to their former quarters,
whether the said Dukes Horse did likewise retreat, being pursued by the Spanish
Horse, which upon this occasion were commanded by the Count de Sora a Spaniard,
who likewise served as a Voluntier under Colombo. So as staying there three
days, on the 15th of the said October they luckily succored the Town with
all things necessary, October. 15.
to the great resentment of Crequi, and the French Commanders; who though it
behoved them at the present not to take notice thereof, yet could not Crequi
forbear saying to the Duke of Savoy; My Lord Duke, if it be your Highness
pleasure to suffer Valenza to be succored, we need not trouble our selves in
keeping any longer before it. The French perceiving by the entrance of this
relief that their hopes of winning the Town were vain, their men being
wearied and much lessened in lying before it, and that any longer delay proved
much to their disadvantage, for whilst they to little purpose entertained
themselves in that Siege, the Spaniards augmented their numbers in Naples,
Cesely, Germany, and other places, they with a joint consent raised their Siege
on the 26th of October, October. 26.
the French and Duke of Parma retiring to Saint Salvadore, and the Duke of
Savoy with his men toward Satirana: whereupon Colombo, who kept in his
quarters at Frescarolo, to hinder any foraging upon the Kings Land on this side
Poe, and any further inrodes into the Country, as likewise to make use of such
occasion as fortune should offer him to incommodiate the confederates, finding
the French Campretreated, went to his former quarters of Pieue del Cairo, and
watched there over the Enemies proceedings; who to color this their retreat,
gave out that they were to join with some Forces of Dolpheny that were coming
toward Piemont, and that being so joined they intended to set upon the
Spaniards in the fields, for that they knew them to be too good at the
defending of Walls. But this was but the opinion of the vulgar, who always
talk of things, not as they are, but as they would have them. For the French
being much cast down by the miscarrying of their enterprise, whereby they
suffered much in honor, were not yet grown so confident, as to venture upon
another which was uncertain, and dangerous. And the good which they had
promised unto themselves, appeared much more unlikely; for the Duke of Savoy,
the original of all their mischief, not liking that they should get footing
in the State of Milan, did so craftily behave himself, and was so well able to
cloak his feigned intent, as the French, who trust more to their Sword then to
their judgment, not aware of his cunning, threatened much, but did little.
'Twas afterward suspected that the Duke of Parma was contented Valenza should
be relieved; for he finding all Crequies formerly said instances quite
contrary to what he expected, was not very well pleased, but beginning to
doubt, 'twas said he made his complaints to Crequi, foreseeing that the
Spaniards being victorious in their defense, might undertake somewhat to his
prejudice.

The raising of the Siege from before Valenza caused much murmr between the
French chief Commanders, and the other Colleagues, in their argumentations
what had enforced them thereunto. Some openly complained of the Duke of Savoy,
as the author and abettor thereof; others blamed Crequi, saying he cared not
to end the work, but only that the War should be prolonged for his own
interest; and others accused the French Commanders in general, for that (not
caring how their Companies diminished,) they little minded the preservation of
their Soldiers; so as their Army lessening, and the Spania^ds increasing in
their Forces, they were necessitated to forgo the enterprise, which if it had
been wisely handled, there were very strong arguments to prove, that the Town
could not have been maintained. By this confusion of the Colleagues, the
Spaniards hopes began to bud again, which were well-nigh withered out of fear
of losing that Town: Though Celada's death who died within the Town of a
malignant Fever much lessened the contentment which every one had in the
victory; for this young Gentleman had upon this occasion given such proof of
his worth, as had filled all men with much expectation from him. After having
returned thanks to God, with great demonstration of joy, they thought that
since the French had failed in their taking of Valenza* they should be
prosperous in their intended purpose of driving Rohan out of the Valteline.
Egged on therefore by this desire, which usually accompanies hope, they
resolved thereupon.

The enterprise was therefore agreed upon with Serbellone, and Robustelli, one
of the chief men of that valley, and who depended upon Spain, both which
being ambitious to have their share in so great glory, were too lavish in their
counsels, and reasons, and coveted by whatsoever means to free the afflicted
valley, and drive out the French who were already dejected by their compagnions
retreat from Valenza. All such Soldiers and Provisions as were thought
requisite for such a business, were sent therefore away toward Fort Fuentes.
But because Rohan was then at Tirano, about the building of a Fort there for
his keeping of that valley, Serbellone wisely, as became a good and experienced
Soldier, would first be informed in what condition the French Army was in, and
what they did, before he would advance further. He therefore sent a friend of
Robustelli's from Morbegno thitherward, that he might discover and accordingly
advertise them what the Enemy did, that so they might govern themselves as
they should see occasion. This man, when he came to Tirano, at his entrance in
at the Gate, were it either by his pale looks, or by the uncertain answers he
gave unto the Guard, who according to the Military fashion, asked him whence he
came, and whether he went, was laid hand of, and brought to Rohan; who like a
wise man, after having very courteously received him, said unto him, My friend,
I know wherefore you are come hither, conceal therefore nothing, but tell the
truth, which if you do, I promise you not only to save your life, but to send
you safe back whence you came. He not knowing how to answer to such questions,
as one convinced, kneeling down, acquainted him with all the affair, and with
the Spaniards design. Whereupon embracing the present occasion, which he
thought very opportune, and not to lose time, he called his Commanders and
chief Officers together, and acquainting them with the Spaniards design,
encouraged them all by calling to mind their past victories, and putting them
in hopes of more: which seemed like a flash of fire, that had made its way
through some enclosed place; for all doubt and fear of the enemy vanishing
immediately from out the hearts of those Co^manders, he speedily marched
toward Sondrio, a Town in the midst of that valley, whether he came before the
Spaniards knew that he was gone from Tirano, where having refresht his men,
who lay all night in the fields, (for he would not suffer them to come into the
Town, for the gaining of time) and being advertised that the Spaniards Cannon
was not yet parted from Delibio, a place between the Lake and the River Lesina
beneath Fort Fuentes, nor yet the Soldiers who were there to guard them, he
advised with his Council of War, what was best to be done, who all joined in
opinion, to advance forward, and without any delay to set upon the Spaniards
that were about Morbegno. Serbellone hearing of the French-mens approach would
not give one foot back, but in all haste made the Count S. Secondo advance
with his Horse on the right hand unto the foot of a Mountain, behind a little
Church dedicated to S. Peter; Trivultio's Brigado placed it self toward the
Ada, having the advantage of a little Fenne, not far from the said Church;
and the Spaniards staid in the Reere upon the plain of the Parish of Morbegno.
Rohan advancing by the Champian of Talemona, made Monsieur de Vandy's Regiment
march forward to possess himself of Bit Bridge, but not coming time enough,
he found the Spaniards had prevented him. Rohan finding these difficulties,
resolved to make his Horse advance, wherein he trusted most; but the
straightness of the place, and narrow ways, would not suffer him so to do:
wherefore fearing lest they might fall upon some Ambush, he commanded them to
retreat, and made Monsieur de Lecas his men to advance, which was composed of
new men. He was notwithstanding fought withal by the Italians, and with no
little loss to the French repulsed.

Rohan being hereat mightily incenst, marched himself in person in the head of
Frideliera's Regiment, and gave upon the Spaniards, who with equal valor
withstood their fury; after an hours very hot service, and wherein they fought
Sword to Sword, the Frenchmen charging with great obstinacy, at whose head
stood 100 Soldiers lighted from off their Horses, Trivulsio's Regiment was at
last forced to forgo the Fenne, and consequently to retreat, which being
confusedly done by those Soldiers, the greatest part of them being new men,
who had never seen the face of an Enemy before, as the other Spaniards had
usually done, they fled from the French, and lost many of their Soldiers and
Officers of importance, and amongst others the Count S. Secondo.

This loss made the Austrians perceive how the difficulty of getting the
Valteline grew every day greater and greater: Yea, after Serbellone was routed,
a body of Dutch advancing toward the Bathes of Bormio, so to enter the Valley,
was likewise routed and driven back. Hereupon, they bethought themselves how
they might bring the Emperors aid into the state of Milan; And lastly,
knowing no other way but by the Switzers, they communicated their desires to
the Canton of Lucerna, and other Papists Cantons, with promise of good store of
money, who allured by profit, suffered them to pass through their Towns; Thus
by their dexterious behavior, did the Spaniards overcome those difficulties by
their moneys, which they could not so easily have done by their Sword. The
great Duke of Tuskany likewise, who was very affectionate to the house of
Austria, to boot with the Brigado of Foot, which he raised at his own costs in
Helvetia, did upon this occasion likewise assist the state of Milan, with 300
Horse under the command of Marquis Cosimo Richardi: Whereupon Beliviere leaving
Venice, came to Florence, not out of any intention to make the great Duke side
with the Crown of France; but at least to moderate the evil opinion which the
Princes of Italy might have taken of that Crown, by reason of the French-mens
falling into Italy, and to keep the great Duke, as much as possibly he could,
from assisting the Spaniards: And because the opinion grew stronger every day,
that the Duke of Savoy held secret intelligence with the Spaniards, it is said,
that to moderate in some sort this report, the King of Spaines Agents held it
fit to dismiss the Abbot Torre, who was the Duke of Savoyes Ambassador from
Milan, under pretense, that considering the breach made by his Master against
the King of Spain, it was not fitting a Minister of his should keep with
those, against whom he had declared himself an open Enemy.

At this time, Don Franchesco di Mello, a man of great esteem, sent as
extraordinary Ambassador from Spain to the Emperor, took Milan in his way,
and staid there, it being reported, he was to have been made Governor thereof.

The Spaniards this mean while, building very much upon the Duke of Modena's
declaring himself for them, as well for the assistance they might expect from
that Prince of warlike people, as for the credit of being reverenced by such an
Italian Potentate, not respecting the right of descent in the Prince of
Correggio, mediated with the Emperor therein, in the behalf of the Duke of
Modena, that the true Prince might be deprived thereof, and the other invested
thereinto, as it insued upon the promise of disbursing 200000 Dollars.

The Elector of Saxony, having after some days stout defense made by the
Swedes, taken the Castle of Hall, knew it was requisite for him to join with
the Imperial Troops, who were then in good numbers about Franckfort upon the
Oder, that they might jointly invade those Towns which were by them pretended
unto, and were held, and gainsaid them by the Swedes. He therefore marched
toward Berlin, a City of Brandenberg upon the Hault, where the Swedes were,
who were much grieved at the uniting of those Forces, as making much against
that which they intended; and being hereof advertised, Bannier thought it
expedient to remove from thence. Therefore having brought his Soldiers near
Ratzaw, and having quickly taken Verbe^, which not being in a condition to
stand out, immediately Articled, the small Garrison which guarded it, marching
out with their Bag and Baggage, he left therein a good guard, for it was a
place of some moment for him, and then marched with his Army toward the Enemy,
where some Regiments of the Swedish Horse meeting with some Squadrons of the
Saxons, which scoured the Country, they so evilly treated them, as that they
made them run away to the Electors headquarters.

The Elector of Brandenburg was much troubled with this Hostility between the
Swedes and Saxons, who confining upon them both, if he should declare himself
for either side, he should bring the War home to his own doors. So was
likewise the Duke of Mechelberg, who could expect nothing but much prejudice
from this their falling out. Therefore an accommodation between the Swedes and
Saxons being very much desired by those two Princes, they were not wanting in
their best endeavors to compose those differences; but they could do no good
therein, for the Swedish Commanders being particularly offended by the Elector,
and incited through a desire of War, whereon their greatness did consist,
for they thereby much enriched themselves, held the business in suspense upon
very small hopes, and at last, all the differences consisting in a declaration,
which contained, that before they would proceed further, they would be
repossessed of all that they did possess the year 1634. the Treaty fell to
the ground.

The Frenchmen, failing in their intentions of taking Valenza, which for the
reasons formerly alleged they much desired; and seeing that the numbers of the
Spaniards did daily increase in the state of Milan, by the assistance of other
Princes their friends, for now the Dutch began to march toward them under the
command of Prince Borso of Este, and Colonel Giledas, together with other
Switzers, to boot with many Foot that were raised in the state of Modena, and
in Tuscany, and those that every day were landed from Spain and Naples,
thought it fitting to ease the quarters of Montferrat, (which began to be very
burdensome to those people) by sending back the Duke of Parma's Forces into
their own Country. But because their numbers were much lessened in lying
before Vabenza, and that they could not without evident danger pass through
the Territories of Tortona, and so enter into Piacenza, without being backed
with greater Forces; and when they should be luckily arrived there, they were
not able to defend their state from the Spaniards, who were expected to invade
them, they endeavored all they might to make the Duke of Savoy join his
General the Marquis Villa, with those of Parma, who with the Savoy Horse might
back the Duke of Parma, till he should come to his own home; where when he
should be, they would then bethink themselves of new resolutions; to which the
Duke gave way, though he suspected that the French did this to weaken his
Forces, that they might have him the more at their beck; for by his suffering
Valenza to be succored, the French had renewed the former jealousies they had
of his actions. Villa therefore left his quarters, and marching toward
Tortona, began to do as was agreed upon; but the Spaniards, who had heard
hereof, sent speedily away 3000 Foot and 10 Companies of Horse to Tortona,
December. 23
whither they came on the 23th of December, and lodged in the Suburbs of the
City, from whence they sent out Scouts to discover the Enemies proceedings;
and understanding that Villa with his Horse appeared already in very good order
upon the Territories of that Town, they thought it expedient to foord over the
S^rivia, (a Torrent not far from thence) and send some Horse toward the
Savoyards, seconded by diverse Files of Muskets, intending to set upon them on
the Flank, and by fighting with them, to make the Colleagues alter their
intentions. But the Spaniards finding themselves not strong enough to encounter
them, though they were somewhat advantaged by the protection of the City, and
the Cannon thereof which played upon the Enemies Horse, being come within their
reach, they kept their stations, forbearing to make any further attempt; so as
while this was a doing, the Foot which marched on the other side, came
successefully to the new Castle of Scrivia, not having so much as one
Musket Shot made at them, though there were some Spanish and Neapolitan Foot
there, and other people of the Country Army, who neither withstood them, nor
endeavored to disturb their passage. The Spanish Foot came notwithstanding
that night to Schietto, and the Horse to Casse, where they kept themselves all
night in Arms, and being told that the Savoyards were dispersed abroad in
little Cottages thereabouts, Captain Miazza was ordered to scour the
Country, who fell in upon the quarters of some of the Enemies Horse, wherein
he came off with much loss; the assaylants were few, but those that were set
upon fewer: Villa in all this march was very vigilant, and kept his men in good
order; So as those of Parma, and the Savoy Horse passing on successefully, they
haulted at Castle S. John, and quartering themselves in the Piacenzan Towns,
they expected what resolves their Commanders would put on.

The Spaniards this mean while, not only at Madrid, but in the state of
Milan, and in all other places appertaining to the Austrians, studied the best
they could, LIB. 11. 1636.
and used their utmost diligence in taking care for all things requisite for
the Crown, and especially in providing to withstand the French invasion in the
Valteline, and in the state of Milan, the loss whereof they much apprehended,
seeing the French so strong, and so united, and (which imported more) having
such friends, and holding such correspondency in Italy; for the Austrians held
for certain, that the Venetians, by reason of their ancient league, and
mindful of the injuries formerly plotted against them by the Spanish Agents,
were too much interessed with the French. That the Duke of Savoy, environed by
the French Forces, was obliged in outward appearance, if not inwardly to
declare himself their En^my; Parma had denounced Hostility, Mantua was a
Confederate, Genua a Neuter; So as if things had so fallen out as they
imagined, the Spaniards being on all sides environed with so great powers,
could not for certain have saved themselves from the On-sets in every part.
And though the wiser sort saw plainly, 'twould be a hard business to agree so
many in unity, or so many unions, by reason of the differing interests of the
Italian Princes; and that well weighing the reasons of State, it was probably
seen, that this the Spaniards conceit, was built but upon a weak foundation,
though it carried likelihood with it; yet the Kings Ministers of State, having
maturely considered the present emergencies, resolved that Marquis Leganes,
declared Governor of Milan some months before, should speedily go to his
charge. Whereupon parting presently from Bartelona in Gallyes, and Galliouns,
he about this time landed at Genua with 2000 Spanish Foot, went from thence to
Pavia, and was with much applause received into Milan. Where after having taken
order for the Civil Government, he applied himself with all industry to what
concerned the War; and though the hardness of the Season, already
white-headed, suffered him not to proceed further, and that the Spaniards
intended to spend that Winter only in raising more men, so as at the next
Spring they might be able, not only to defend their own, but to invade the
States of others; yet to keep the Soldier in exercise, to win credit at his
first entrance, that he might not seem to give way to the Confederate Forces,
and to give the Duke of Parma an inkling, how at the last all the War was
likely to fall upon his Country, and therefore he should do well to think of
an accommodation. He commanded the Marquis of Caretsana, the Captain of his
Guard, to march from Lugdiano to before Guardamiglio, a Castle belonging to the
Piacenzan jurisdiction, upon the Confines of the Lodian Territories, whether
the Marquis coming forthwith, and planting his Cannon against it, the Castle
not being in a case to make resistance, yielded upon discretion.

1636.
The Forces of the Emperor, and of the Catholic League were already advanced
from Alsatia, into Burgundy, and to Rumberviller, upon the very mouth of
Lorayne, thinking to do somewhat in that Dukedom, incited thereunto by the no
good will which the Loreyners bore unto the French, and who was desirous to
have their first master a neutrall. Where Wirt being advertised by spies, that
some Carriages of victuals were upon their way to the French Camp nee^
Niclanport, he marched privately to them with 1000 Horse and 700 Musketeers,
making such haste, as falling unexpectedly upon 600 Horse which was their
Convoy, he put them all to flight, and took from them 70 Carriages loaded with
Wine, and 30 with victuals. Gallasse on the other side likewise having taken
Mentz, which was far from succor, and wanted such Rampires as might serve
for longer defense, for it was only begirt with bare Walls and old Towers upon
the Rhyn, over against the mouth of the Main, and leaning to a little hill,
upon the which stood a Castle fortified by the Swedes, with Bulwarks after the
modern fashion, which after some days Siege yielded it self: Thinking to do
somewhat more, he went with his Army from those parts, and meeting with no
resistance came within sight of Sarbruch, a Town upon the Confines of Germany,
parted from Lorayne by the River Sar, which after some Cannon shot made at it,
likewise yielded: from thence he advanced and came near the City Doiponti or
Dupont, which gives the name to a space of land adhering to Lorayne and the
lower Palatinat called the Dukedom of Dupont, and is seated upon the banks of
Bleis, where he haulted, fearing to encounter the French Army if he should
advance further, which being joined with Duke Waymer, was very strong and
numerous about Metz, a chief City of large precincts, environed with strong
Walls, and watered by the Mosell, where the French were quartered. And knowing
he should not tarry long there, by reason of scarcity of Victuals, and the
Soldiers sore complaints, he resolved to retreat and to winter his men in
Franconia, Wirtenberg, and Alsatia. But thinking he should do amiss if he
should leave Deistem uncorrected, (wherein was a French Garrison, (who by their
frequent Sallies much terrified the Inhabitants of the neigbouring Villages,)
he marched thitherward, raised two Batteries aginst it, and aft^r an Assault,
wherein were slain about 40 Imperialists, and 30 French; the Imperialists
stormed the Town, and put all to the Sword, whom they found Armed.

On the other side the Elector of Saxony was joined with the Forces of
Lunenburg, and some other Dutch Regiments, which were come to serve him, by
reason of the Swedes ill usage of them; the chief Commanders whereof
appropriating unto themselves such contributions as they got from the Countries
through which they past, leaving these men to pay themselves out of the
advancements due from the Towns which they had ruinated, and were forsaken by
the Inhabitants, whereupon they became so insolent and licentious, as that
behaving themselves without any manner of discipline, they had the boldness to
plunder and sack their friends Towns; and flying from their Colors, came in
great numbers to inrole themselves, under the Elector and Imperialists. The
Saxons being thus recruited marched into the field, to oppose the inrodes of
the Swedes, (who keeping in the State of Magdeburg, did much infest those Towns
which joined upon Saxony) and putting some of their Regiments to flight, they
slew many of them, and took 7 Ensigns. Bannier being hereof advertised who
was reinforced about Lunenburg with 4000 Soldiers which were brought to him by
Colonel Stalans from Prussia, marched with his Army against the Saxons; who
fearing to meet with desperate men, and such as desired to join Battle with
them, though their numbers were greater, their courage appeared to be less,
for they faced about, and retreated to their former quarters.

Hannaw was likewise at this time straightly besieged by the Imperialists, a
strong hold, fortified after the modern fashion, and seated upon the River
Brints, which taking its head from Franconia falls into the Main before
Franckfort. Colonel Vistum did herein command in Chief, one of the bravest
Commanders the Swedes had, who having a stout Garrison, made frequent Sallies,
wherewith he much troubled the Marquis of Grana, and Lamboi, who were the
chief leaders of the Caesarian Camp.

News being come to the Court of France of their countrymens retreat from
before Valenza, and how little good their Commanders had yet done, they took
speedy advice about such things as they thought most fitting to continue the
War in Italy, and somewhat to salve their loss of reputation. It was
therefore foreseen, and evidently made appear by the wiser sort, that little
was to be hoped for in that Province, whilst they were not really and
effectually assisted by other Potentates; or else, unless the King himself
should march thither in person with a powerful Army: For the French have no
great desire to make War in Italy, which they call their Grave, insomuch, as
of 20000 Foot which came from Dolpheny, hardly 10000 came into Piemont; of
which whole Squadrons fled daily away, moved thereunto out of the impatiency
the Frenchmen have of seeing Rome, Venice, and other Cities in Italy, where
they stay, lay down their Arms, and betake themselves to such Trades as they
formerly used in France; whereby the French Companies were so much lessened, as
that their Captains not daring to acquaint the King therewithal, (were it
either out of shame, or for their private gain by the receiving of dead pay,)
excused their delay, by invented difficulties: Whence it was, that thus to set
upon an estate, full of strong holds, and having good Forces in the fields, was
but a loss of men and time; And the King not being able to go out of his
Kingdom by reason of the great interests of the Crown, or rather, as it was
said by others, lest he might hazard that reputation and glory, which with the
universal applause of Christendom and of the whole World he had won, when
he freed the Duke of Mantua from evident Spanish subjection; it behoved either
to quit the enterprise, or else to endeavor to conclude a friendship and union
with some such Potentate, as might be able to set upon that State in some other
part, that by such a diversion the way might be opened to their desired
proceedings. This Counsel though it were the most proper, and that which at
their first taking up Arms was embraced, yet was it not thought sufficiently
effectual. For those who clearly saw the reason, and relation of States,
argued by what was past, that the Italians more hated the neighborhood of the
French, then of the Spaniards, they being naturally more inclined to the
Spaniards by reason of their sympathizing in language, and gravity with them,
then to the others, who much differ from them, both in customs, and vivacity
of spirit. Yet building upon the opinion, that the Spaniards were ill thought
of, as those who being potent in Italy, do infinitely desire to enlarge the
bounds of their Monarchy; That they had been the cause of so much ruin in
Italy, as was witnessed by the fresh memory of Mantua, and Lombardy, they
persuaded themselves, that particular hatred was able in some sort to obfuscat
that wisdom, through which Princes regard not the memory of any thing that is
past, that so they may be the more intent to the present interest of their
State.

The Duke of Parma was in this interim, not well satisfied with those chief
Agents, who had the government of the French Forces in Italy; who gave little
appearance of concurring in advice with his Highness, keeping their men
quartered in Montferrat, when both time and occasion required they should have
been employed about the common interest, before such time as further Forces
should be brought into the State of Milan, as was expected from Spain,
Naples, Germany and elsewhere; and whereof some Dutch Troops did already
appear, who were received upon the Confines by Signior Alexander Visconti,
sent thither to that purpose from Milan.

The Duke foresaw, that through the Commanders negligence, who minded nothing
but their own profit, the War was at last to fall wholly upon his Country,
which lay open for the Spanish invasion; But he was also comforted by hopes of
receiving fresh aid from the King of France, and that he himself should have
the chief command of the War. A business which if it had succeeded, as it
was wisely advised, the French might have hoped for better success then they
hitherto had. For the Duke of Parma being a sprightly Prince, and of high
thoughts, would have carried on the War with courage and ingenuity, and being
sufficiently ill minded toward the Spaniards, would not have let slip such
occasions as should have opportunely presented themselves, keeping his
Companies complete, and behaving himself like a generous Commander. And when
the Milanesses should have seen such a Prince in the field, who can tell but
that believing he might prove another Lodowick, they would not have been so
faithful unto the Spaniards as now they seemed to be, for fear of falling in
subjection to the French. And this was thought by witty men, the best course
the French could have taken; for when they should have appeared not to have
been any ways interessed themselves, and that their only end had been to
have driven out the Spaniards, and to have reduced that Dukedom under the
Scepter of an Italian Prince, those who were subjects unto Spain would have
been glad thereof, so to have been eased from the government of strangers and
the other Princes of Italy, hoping to better their condition by expelling the
Spaniards, and particularly by their dividing the State of Milan amongst them,
they would have heartily fomented the work; but strangers being to be
exchanged for strangers, and an united power as was then that of France, being
to be drawn near them, 'twas better for them to continue the State of Milan
in the Spaniards hands, whose Territories are far off, and disjoined. For to
compose an Army fit to defend on one part, and to offend the State on another,
much Money and time would be required, and the Kingdom of Naples and their other
States would be thereby much burdened, a business of so great consideration,
as the Spaniards would have very well bethought themselves of the end before
they would have undertaken such a War, and peradventure never have done it,
till first they should have driven the French from Montferrat and Piemont, and
so have hindered them from succouring of such Princes of Italy, as should be by
them oppressed, wherefore neither did the Soldiers, nor any of the adjoining
neighbors like of such a change; and the rather, for that the Spaniards were
more quiet neighbors then the French; the Duke of Parma resolved therefore to
go to the Court of France, where he was received by the King with all beseeming
pomp, graciously looked upon, and better treated.

Marquis Villa, who during the Duke of Parma's absence, kept himself with the
abovesaid Savoy-Horse upon the Piacenzan Territories, being advertised that the
Duke of Modena did still engage himself in further friendship to the
Spaniards, and that he furnished them with all things necessary out of his own
State, thinking it now no longer time to keep idle in his quarters, resolved
upon some enterprise; and under pretense of remitting the Prince of Correggio
into his estate, (who in the former Wars of Mantua, being accused by the
Austrian Agents of coining false Moneys, and extortion, was banished) to
overrun the Country of Modena, and thereby endeavor to withdraw the Duke of
Modena from his inwardnesse with Spain, or rather to persuade him to join in
league with the Duke of Parma, and the other Colleagues* Which could he have
done, as he had small reason to imagine, (for that wise Prince minded not to
interest himself foolishly in a War, whereby he could promise nothing to
himself but the ruin of his State) it would have been so useful a diversion
for the French Forces, as they might easily have obtained their desired ends.

Departing from his quarters, he so opportunely, and so unexpectedly came upon
the Territories of Modena, as that the Duke thereof and his Commanders dreaming
of nothing less, afforded the Savoyards opportunity to overrun some Towns of
Rugio, and to ^acke Castle Novo; but these proceedings were soon stopped: For
the Duke and his Uncle Prince Lewis a valiant and experienced Soldier, marched
into the field with a good strength of Foot and Horse, and the Spaniards upon
notice hereof, did speedily imbarque 800 Horse and 2000 Foot at Casall the
greater upon the Poe, who landing under Bressell a strong hold in Modena, came
the first week in Lent to the succor of the Duke, by whom they were
courteously received, and refreshed in the quarters of Castle Novo, Gualtieri,
and other Towns of Regio, where hearing that the Enemy advanced, the Spaniards
made suddenly toward the Bridge over Lenza, a River which coming from the
Alps cuts through the Country between Parma and Regio; where joining with
those of Modena, they advanced to the highway which leads from Parma to the
said Bridge, where those of Parma kept themselves in good order, marching
toward the Country of Modena. And being come near Sorbolo, a Town between
Bressel and Cassall Novo; Miazza's Company which was advanced to observe the
Enemies proceedings, light upon the Savoy Horse, with whom they skirmished, in
the which skirmish Count Lodovic Aresoes Company, being advanced to succor
Miazza, and these being pursued by those of Parma they could not retreat by
reason of their Commanders unadvisednesse, who instead of leaving a convenient
space open on the said highway, whereby their Horse might have retreated after
their bickering, had with the remainder of their Forces block't up the passage,
so as Count Lodovic was defeated with no little loss likewise to the
Burgonians, led on by Signior Batteville. Of the Spaniards, Count Lodovic Arse,
Batteville, and Don Vincenzo Gonzaga were wounded; and of the Savoyards, Don
Scipion di Masserano, was taken prisoner. And Villa knowing he could no more
good, for that the Enemy was much more in number then he; (others will have it,
that he had secret instructions from the Duke of Savoy, to seem outwardly to
give all manner of satisfaction to the French, but in effect to delay the
execution thereof, and to let slip such occasions as might be advantageous to
them) passed over ^^za, and returned to his former quarters in the State of
Parma; and the Spaniards after having over-runne some Towns of the State of
Parma, came back to the Territories of Cremona.

The English thought the present conjuncture of time favorable for them to get
the restitution of the Palatinate, by reason of the revolutions and ruptures of
these two Crowns for many years agitated with War; and undoubtedly hoping,
that upon these emergencies the Austrians would be very glad to keep good
intelligence with that Kingdom, and rather endeavor their friendship by
giving them satisfaction, then again to render them distrustful. Whereupon,
as it is usual to grant those things for need upon poor conditions, which in
times of prosperity were held in great esteem, the English thinking that now
they might easily obtain the restitution of the Palatinate from the
Imperialists, which had formerly been denied them, sent an extraordinary
Ambassador to Vienna to obtain it from the Emperor; who being come thither,
and having made known his Commission, was by outward appearance more welcomed
then formerly; as well in respect, that it is usual to make much of such a
Princes Ministers of State, so far as good may be hoped from them; as
likewise to cause the greater jealousy in the French. The negotiation hereof
was committed to Monsieur Vicario, the Counts Mecaw, and Trantmistorfe, and to
the Baron Stralendorph, the chief Officers of the Imperial Crown; and after
many meetings and consultations had upon the business, Caesar's good
inclination thereunto was interrupted, by respect of the satisfaction that was
to be given to Bavaria, England not being to be satisfied without the prejudice
of Bavaria, they ought to set the greater value upon the Dukes friendship, by
how much they knew the re-granting of the Palatinate advantageous to the
English; for it was not now time to make an uncertain correspondency with a
Foreign and far distant Prince, thereby to abandon the certain friendship
of one who had always deserved well of, and been faithful to the Emperor;
and who being Master of a flourishing Country, a considerable Exchequer, and a
no despicable Army, if he should quit his Confederacy with the Austrians, and
join himself with the French, (who failed not to endeavor it, by all the
skill they had) the ruin was apparent which would thereby have fallen upon the
Empire. Therefore the Propositions and the Answers were long held in hand, with
such dexterity as Princes use in businesses, whereunto they wish no good
conclusion; so as the negotiation proved abortive.

The Emperor foreseeing the importance of the War with France, that he might
as well preserve the Princes and Potentates of Italy well inclined toward him,
and keep them from holding any prejudicial correspondency with the French, as
likewise to procure from them some succor, if not of men nor money, yet of
minds well disposed toward his affairs, he gave the charge hereof to Crast,
one of his Court-Counsellours; who parting from Vienna, and coming to Venice,
after having with all terms of courtesy and appearing confidence (but as was
rep^rted, without obtaining one penny of money) dispatched his Embassy with that
Republique, pursued his journey to the other Princes; from whom, receiving
likewise all such satisfaction as is usually given by excuses and fair words,
the negotiation proved of little or no effect: For the Italian Princes,
resenting their expenses, occasioned by the ambition of the Austrian Agents,
and their numbers being much diminished by the contagion brought into their
States by the Imperialists, could neither have any appetite to digest such
dangers, nor reason sufficient to persuade them to soment a greatness, which
in due time would be exercised against the benefactors thereof. But the
Spaniards, who were now become strong and numerous in the State of Milan, for
to boot with the Horse and Foot sent to them from the Kingdom of Naples; there
were likewise arrived 8 of Gileda's his Companies, 6 Companies of Foot
belonging to Colonel Lunardi, 10 of Horse to the Count De Slich, and other 10
of Dragoones to Colonel Girone, thinking it now time to move some whither,
resolved to do somewhat in recompense of the Hostility used in the Country
of Regio, against the Duke of Modena, by the Savoyards and those of Parma; They
therefore entered upon the Piacenzan Territories, set upon and took S. John's
Castle, which suddenly yielded, by reason of the flow advance of succor which
came not time enough, though it were sent by Marquis Villa. Wherefore those of
Parma, the Town being lost, retreated, which they could not so suddenly do,
but that being followed by those of Modena, they suffered some loss in the
skirmish, which certainly would have been greater, had not the Spaniards
thought this their retreat a stratagem to draw them into an ambush, so as they
ceased from further pursuing them, and retreated to S. John's Castle; where,
leaving a Garrison of 700 Dutch Foot, Gambaccorta, the Governor of the Horse,
had order to overrun the Piacenzan Territories, the which he did, burning
some Barks upon the Poe, and bringing good store of Cattle into Cremona.
Which hostile acts being understood by the French, Crequi, that he might seem
not to neglect the State of Parma, thought to make the Spaniards quit the
P^acenzan Territories by diversion; he therefore sent out some Companies of
Horse and Foot who pillaged some Towns and Villages on this side the Poe,
sacked Palestro, Confienza, and Robio, but got not much thereby, for all the
best things had been wisely conveyed away from thence before, into places of
greater strength. Wherefore the Governor sent speedily a good Body of men to
the Confines of Novara, and he himself went in person to Briagras, to look
to the preservation of the State, and to oppose the Enemies designs, who
notwithstanding continuing their inrodes, did likewise sack Vespola.

Bannier being inheartned by the Saxons retreat, advanced with his Army from
Magdeburg toward Henneberg, a place near Sala, where meeting with 7 Imperial
Regiments, he fought with them and put them to flight, enforcing them to
retreat with some loss; from thence he came before Leipsick, set upon it, and
would have taken it, had not the Elector, who was much concerned in the loss
thereof, in respect of his own interest, and for the reputation of his Forces,
speedily joined himself with Colonel Maracini, who commanded a Body of
Caesarians to the number of about 7000 and was advanced thitherward; the which
when Bannier understood, after having gotten some contribution from the
neighboring Towns, he retired toward Hall upon the Sala, not to hazard the
fortune of a Battle, wherein he feared he should receive some great
prejudice, being weak in men, and the Saxons having about 28000 fighting men,
the Caesarians being cast into the number.

The Pope and great Duke of Tuscany, who were not a little grieved at the
troubles of Italy, and in particular at the falling out between Modena and
Parma, from which they saw much of incommodity might in time ensue to their
States, for this was a business wherein they were likely to be interessed
both, the one for the one, the other for the other party, resolved to endeavor
an agreement between them before businesses should be grown to a greater
hight. They therefore begun to negotiat to purpose with their Highnesses,
insomuch as by their interpositions, the Forces of Modena retreated from the
Territories of Parma; and shortly after their differences were quieted through
the good endeavors of Monsignior Mellino, Bishop of Imola, sent to this
purpose from the Pope to Modena and Parma.

On the other side the Spaniards perceived there was no better way to bring the
Duke of Parma to their devotion, then to reduce him to a necessity of being
succored by the French, upon the confidence whereof he had declared himself.
For when he should see that their words, and their deeds did not correspond,
(as they were confident they would not) he would have just cause to provide for
his own safety; And they likewise knew, that to succor Piacenza, and to
withstand the Spanish Forces which were about Montferrat, it would be requisite
for them to have a very great Army, of which there was but little likelihood,
for the French came unwillingly into Italy, and the few that were there every
day ran away, and their Commanders minded more their own preservation, and
their making good cheer in Montferrat, and Piemont, then the winning of another
Country, which contained in it so many and so great incommodities, and
difficulties. They therefore resolved to appear more ready to offend him; and
on the fifth of March made some of their men advance, March 5.
and took the Town and Castle of Colorno, a place between the Poe and the
River Parma, which upon the sight of Cannon Articled, and yielded; as likewise
did Merano, a place belonging to the jurisdiction of Parma, upon the side of
Poe toward Casall the greater. Advancing further they lodged in the Towns of
Count Saint Secundo, giving out that they did it to remit the heirs of that
Count into their Territories, their father having lost his life in the
business of the Valteline in the King of Spaines service. In all which they
prospered and met with no lets, there being no Soldiers to oppose them; for
little less then their whole Militia was in Parma and Piacenza, and retreated
into their strong places, to keep themselves safe till the arrival of the
promised succor from France. And Villa, who kept still about Piacenza, durst
not come forth of his quarters with those few men he had, as not able to oppose
the Spaniards. Crequi hearing of these invasions endeavored to do somewhat in
the State of Milan, so to divert the Spaniards from injuring the Piacenzan
State: He therefore sent the Body of his Army to Vespola, upon the Goyna,
between Mortare and Novara, and he with his Horse went toward Vigevan, to the
end that taking that Town, he might concentrate himself in the heart of that
State. The Territories and Towns thereabouts were sacked without any obstacle*
for the Spaniards not being yet joined, came not time enough to succor them;
Gamba Corta was therefore sent against them with a good party of Horse, and a
considerable strength of Foot; who meeting with the French, skirmished some
hours with them, where at last it behoved the French to retreat with some
loss of Horse, by which good encounter the gross Body of the Spaniards, who
were assembled together about Biagras advanced, and made the French abandon
Vespola, where the most part of their Forces were, and to retreat on the other
side the Goyna, to Satirano and Bremo. Whereupon the French failing in their
hopes to remove the War from Parma, the Dutch and Spaniards continued the
taking of Towns and Castles in that State, to the great prejudice of the
Inhabitants, who were forced to fly, and forsake their houses, by reason of
outrages committed by the Dutch; the which the Dutch affirmed they did to
retaliate the barbarismes committed by the Country People against some of their
Soldiers, who were found nailed to Trees. Miserable was the condition of this
Province, and the behavior of those of Regio unexcusable; yet when it came to
the knowledge of the prime Officers, who were desirous to remedy such abuses,
the Governor of Milan, by public edicts and threats, forbad the Soldiers to
commit any insolences, or extortions, upon the Country People.

The Swedes Forces were at this time quiet; for Bannier having retired his Army
to Magdeburg, and quartered it in that Bishopric, attended the recruiting and
refreshing thereof, that afterward he might undertake some action; and the
Elector kept likewise in his quarters, to prepare for the taking of Magdeburg,
a place of great concernment for him, being seated in the very middle of his
dominions, and an important Passage; when on this side in Alsatia, the
Imperialists knowing how little good they could do in Lorayne, (which was well
guarded by the French) and their want of Forage, and Victuals increasing
daily, resolved to make Were go with his Forces from about Ramberviller, and
to pass into Flanders, which Province was greatly threatened, by a powerful
French Army that was in Picardy, and no less by the Hollanders, who instigated
and fomented by the French, made considerable preparations to appear in the
field, and to do some famous act. Were coming into Lucemburg, and desirous to
quarter his Soldiers in the Territories of Leidge, he was forbidden to do so
by order from the Magistrate thereof. At which he being scandalized, and having
caused some Country People to be put to death, who would oppose him with
weapons in their hand, those Citizens mightily incenst thereat, and becoming
the bolder, for that the French Forces were not far off, from whom they might
hope for assistance and protection, they presently took up Arms, and sent
5000 Soldiers with some Cannon against Were, declaring themselves for the
French, protesting much, and making great complaints to the Court of Brussells.
But this breach though it held for some days was afterward accommodated; for
the Imperialists having past the Mosa, and joined with Picolominy, who was
likewise in Luxemburg ready to succor Flanders, it behoved them to retire into
their City; which seeing it self beset on all sides, its Territories ruined,
and having little hope of succor from the French, as they earnestly had
requested, willingly could have wished it had not been so forward in the
demonstration it had made. Yet did it not seem any ways to recede, for the
Citizens thereof knew very well, that Princes who stand in need of other men's
friendships, in their affairs, know how to use such means as may preserve
their friendships, and not exasperat them; but for Sallies and providing for
Defense, they did not a little perplex the Caesarians, in their endeavoring to
offend the City; which enjoying freedom, and being seated upon the Mosa, in a
Country very considerable, between Maestrickt, which was possessed by the
Hollanders, and Mamure, not far distant from the Frontiers of France; being
likewise full of warre-like people, it would have been very prejudicial for
the Spaniards interest in Flanders, if, laying neutralitie aside, it should by
the assistance of the French and Hollanders, have declared it self an Enemy to
Spain, which had received much of emolument from thence, and in particular in
their levies of the Walloons, who are esteemed the best Soldiers in their
Army. Orders were therefore sent to the Dutch Commanders from Brussells, that
they should proceed more gently with those warlike people, there being no
likelihood of any other event, but the making of them desperate, which would be
prejudicial to the Austrian affairs. But those Imperial Commanders, who were
accustomed to the quarters of Germany, where all licentiousness is used; and
who as Caesar's Soldiers, pretended they were to be entertained in all States
comprehended within the Empire, would notwithstanding use violence, by which
they did so incense those people, as that preparing more and more for War,
they by their fierce sallyes did much indammage the Austrian quarters; who
being at last enforced to go against the French Forces, and dispairing to
effect their desires, nor well seeing how they could effect them, they
accorded, and left all differences to be reconciled by the Elector of Cobn.

While affairs went thus, the Duke of Parma was in Paris with the French King,
by whom he was courteously and affectionately received; and being informed how
the Spaniards continued upon his Territories, and that they persisted to use
hostility therein, he earnestly begged assistance from his Majesty; and
having got a favorable answer, and sure promise of aid, he took his leave of
the King, the Duke of Orelans, the Cardinal Richelieu, and all the other
Princes, and returned post to Montferrat, that he might prepare to pass into
his own Country, with such French Forces as were in Piemont, who were
commanded by the King to accompany him till such time as a real succor should
arrive from France as had been promised, or that the French should make such a
diversion as might cause the Spaniards look to defend themselves, and not to
offend others. But the Spaniards, although they were advertised of all this,
lingered not, knowing that if it were believed in the Court of France, that the
people (for the King paid for so many) was sufficient to do the work, yet
were they not such, nor so many as ^^re sufficient: So as they probably
foresaw, that Crequi not having so great a strength, nor desirous to appear
needful of more help, would feed Parma with hopes, propound difficulties to
the Court of France, and keeping himself in his quarters at Montferrat, would
leave the Duke to the mercy of the Spaniards. Therefore they more then ever
renewed their hostility in the State of Piacenza; and making more Dutch
Troops advance, they took the Castle of Rottofredo, betwixt Titon and
Trebbia, and afwards Valditaro and S. Donino, and wasted all those Territories:
'twas said, their intention in doing this, was, that if the Duke should come
with a French Army into his Country to invade the State of Milan on that side,
he should find neither Forage nor Victuals to maintain himself, by which
means they should secure themselves on that side; and so much the rather, for
that the French, when they should be brought to that ruined Country of narrow
Precincts, they being a Nation who cannot well endure hunger, if at other
times, and in other places they were accustomed to run from their Commanders,
they would much the more do so here, having the commodity to go see Mantua
and Venice. And the Spaniards greatly fearing that the French upon the Duke of
Parma's coming, and their Commission from the King, should rather attempt
somewhat in the State of Milan, they sent Don Alonso de Quiranes, the
Lieutenant General of the Horse, with 24 companies of Horse into Novara, to
watch over the French-mens ways, and to oppose them in such sort as his
experience should bid him, till such time as necessary Provisions for defense
were had in the State of Milan. And because the Spaniards knew of what
importance Rottofredo, and the Borrough of Valditaro were, by reason of their
situation for the present War, they resolved to fortify them; for that
maintaining themselves there, though the French should come to succor
Piacenza, they would be able to bring them to great sufferings, and to hinder
the French from advancing on that side into the States of Milan, or of Modena.
And for that the keeping of good intelligence between the Spaniards and the
Duke of Modena was very requisite in many respects, they sent Don Francisco di
Mello to the greater Cassall, whither likewise the Duke came, and speaking
together, 'twas said, that Mello in his Kings name did again assure his
Highness of his Majesty's perfect good inclinations to what concerned him,
wishing him to cast away any umbrage of fear he might have, that the French
passing into the Country of Parma, were to lay hands on the State of R^gi^, or
of Modena. Others said, that Mello let fall some words to invite the Duke to
come to the Court of Spain, which was much desired by the Spaniards, that they
might not go less with France which had been visited by the Duke of Parma.
Others said, it was to raise more men out of that State, and to interest that
Prince yet more with the Crown of Spain; but every man judged as he thought
good, guessing only by conjectures, for no man knew any word he said. The Duke
of Alcana came likewise at this time to Milan, who was reported should be
entertained as Governor thereof, and who was much welcomed, and in stately
manner met without Pavia by Leganes, Mello, and other Cavaliers.

The French were as diligent as the Spaniards in examining what would make most
for their advantage; and of all the rest, Crequi was offended that his fame
should not now mount as high as it had done in his former actions, foreseeing
that if by his valor he should not make good those hopes which the Court
expected from the coming of the Duke of Parma and the Kings commands, he
should go less in reputation. The French Kings chief Commanders and
Ministers of State, being met in Cassale, such Propositions were put to be
wisely weighed, as were thought fitting by such as were more passionate then
others to see the honor of the French Forces lessen; the contents whereof
were, That the Army being brought together, it should immediately march toward
the State of Parma; and that when they should have driven the Spaniards from
thence, and made Pi^cenza their Arsenall of Arms, and all necessary
Provisions, they should courageously and boldly set upon the State of Milan on
this side; which as it was more opulent, and abounding in plenty then any
other part, so did it want Forts able to withstand a strong Army; and that when
they should have ransackt the Countries of Cremona and Lodegian, and made
themselves Masters of those two Towns which were not very strong, they might
easily beleaguer the City of Milan; they fortified these opinions by these
reasons: That if this were not done, the Duke of Parma, who had readily,
without any respect to his own particular, declared himself for them, might
lawfully make his peace with the Spaniard. Whereupon, together with the loss
of so important a friend, they were to suffer, not only in their reputation,
but even in their plighted faith; for all other Princes taking example hereby,
would be careful how they built upon hopes from France; That the friendship of
the Princes and Potentates of Italy was one of the greatest goods that could
befall the Crown of France, and contrariwise the greatest prejudice that could
happen to Spain; That Charles Duke of Ma^tua's obligations to France were
known, the affection and entire friendship of the state of Venice; That
doubtless, though the state of Parma should prove penurious as not to be able
to maintain an Army, it would be supplied from Mantua, Ferara, and Venice;
That the Princes would be glad of such a neighborhood, for that the Spaniards
having thereby recourse unto their Towns, their Territories growing
consequently more populous, and they enriching themselves by their neighbors
pillage, their Principalities would be thereby advantaged; That it was not to
be believed that the Spaniards, though stronger then they were, would resolve
upon a general battle with the French Army, since by losing they should lose
too much, and by winning gain but little; That therefore they were to furnish
Brem, Cassalle, and other neighboring Forts with all things necessary, to send
speedy advertisement to the Court, to the end, that more Forces might with
expedition be sent by the King to set upon the State of Mila on the other side,
that so they might effect the work according to their desire. The other
Commanders would easily have given way to these reasons, as appearing probable
and valid; but considering the end and scope of the enterprise, there were some
who openly opposed them; alleging, That the French had not about 7 or 8
thousand Foot, and 2500 Horse, wherewithal to keep the Field; that this was a
small number in respect of the difficulty of the undertaking, and the recruits
which the Spaniards had received from diverse parts; that they were for many
miles to pass through the Enemies Country, having Valenza, Alessandria, and
Tortona upon their Flanks and backs; that the Army would be perpetually
disturbed; that they could not promise themselves any safe retreat if they
should have occasion so to do, it was rather to be feared, that the Spaniards
by possessing themselves of the most advantageous Avenues, might cross them in
their march, and reduce them to some dangerous necessity; that the Duke of
Mantua's obligations to the King were true, but little of hope was to be
grounded upon that Prince so impoverished by the late Wars; that the wise
State of Venice, was only intent upon the maintaining of their own Dominions,
and the preservation of the peace in Italy; that therefore it was not probable,
they would like the neighborhood of the Forces of so great a King, who the
further distant he was from their Dominions, was always the more their friend;
and that it was an infallible argument, that if they would not send their
Forces into the Valteline, nor yet into the Spaniards Territories, at the first
entrance of the French, who it may be hoped well therein, they would less
suffer the neighborhood of such Forces, to foment them, which by how much the
nearer they were; the more cause of jealousy, did they afford. That the
friendship of Modena and Tuscany with the house of Austria was apparent, so as
nothing could be expected from them, but help to the Spaniards, and the
contrary to the French. In brief they concluded, that as the Princes of Italy
were not satisfied that the Spaniard should enlarge his power amongst them, so
would they not endure that the French should extend themselves beyond Cassalle,
since their possession of that place was sufficient to keep the Spaniards in
perpetual jealousy, and divert them from such thoughts, as they would
certainly demonstrat, could they keep the French locked up on the other side the
Mountains.

By these reasons the enterprise was laid aside, the danger being foreseen
which the Army might run, of being destroyed, whose numbers was lessened by the
running away and death of Soldiers, and who would certainly according to
custom continue their disbanding, and by these objections the mouths of the
boldest and most courageous were stopped, and they were of the more force, for
that any such design without greater strength, was only built upon the air,
and mere imagination. Whereupon feeding the Duke of Parma with hopes, and
satisfying the Court with excuses, they grew at last to be so negligent, as it
may truly be believed all the harm they suffered afterward arose from hence.

Bannier, who was retired to quarter in the Bishopric of Magdeburg, (where by
reason of sickness he staid for about a month) having recovered his health,
and diverse Swedish bands being joined with him, he went with his Army from
thence, where he saw he could not without prejudice tarry any longer. And being
followed by the Imperialists and Saxons, about Hall, some skirmishes ensued,
wherein the Swedes had the worst; whereupon the Imperialists being egged on to
further enterprises, they marched forwards, to engage Bannier in a Battle;
but he wisely knowing it was not now time, to hazard the gains of so many
years upon the few hours of one day, haulted at Ghilberstet, between
Mansfield and Magdeburg, and intrenching himself there, prepared to fight in
that advantageous situation. The which when the Saxons perceived, fearing that
if some other Forces that were not far off with Agafelt should come up to
Bannier, they should be too much engaged, and some notable mischief might
befall them, the Swedes being desirous (as those who for the peace lately made
by Saxony did not a little detest all the Saxon Soldiers,) to fight, and
revenge the ingratitude (as they termed it) used by the Duke to the Crown of
Swethland, they retired likewise upon the banks of Sala, there to provide
themselves of necessaries for the taking of Magdeburg, which they so much
thirsted after. Which retreat when Bannier saw, he likewise rose from
Ghilberstet, and went to Strasford and Altensleben, (places in those precincts)
to provide for the preservation of that City, where having viewed the
Ammunition, Rampires, Fortifications, and Garrison, he returned to his
quarters at Strasford.

Duke Waymer, who as has been said, by reason of Gallasse his coming, was
retired to the Confines of Lorayne, knowing that it was not possible to keep
any longer in those parts which were wasted, and now full of the Emperors
Forces; and more impossible for him to receive succor from the Swedes, who
because they saw that after the defeat at Nordlinghen, it was behovefull for
them to forgo the Provinces of Franconia, Alsatia, and the Palatinat, as
places too far from succor, and wanting such commodities as the Armies had
formerly maintained themselves withal, raising great Contributions from
thence, had resolved to quit the war on this side, and to march with all
their Forces to defend the Towns upon the Rivers of Vesser, Elb, and Oder, the
preservation whereof was necessary for them, they being as it were united to
the Kingdom of Swethland; for having means to transport what men and
Ammunition they pleased by the Baltic Sea, of which the Swedes were Masters,
they might easily defend those places, and by the maintaining thereof enlarge
their dominions, and keep up their reputations in Germany; the Duke I say being
thereunto persuaded by the importunacy of the Officers and Soldiers, who
either demanded pay or leave to depart; as likewise by the large offers of the
French Agents, who daily solicited him to come and serve their King, which if
he would do he should be general of all his Forces; though the Imperialists
failed not to do what in them lay to reconcile him to the Emperor, and that
these endeavors were assisted by the instigations of his brother Duke William,
who had already accepted of conditions offered by the Emperor; yet did the
French prevail with him, who endeavored by all means possible to win him
over unto them, the which they did, for that by gaining this Prince to serve
them, they added to their Forces about the number of 8000 old Dutch Soldiers,
and who were the valiantest of the present age, by reputation whereof, they
should not only keep the places possessed by them in Alsatia, in fealty, whose
Inhabitants were naturally ill disposed to the French; But they might hope for
much better advancements in Germany, having one of that Nation for their
Commander, who was generally beloved by many Cities, and Princes, then if their
General should be a stranger, a Frenchman not known unto them, and the name
of Frenchman being by antipathy odious to Germany. Waymer was the rather
likewise hereunto persuaded by reason of the ill satisfaction he had received
from Oxestern, and the other Swedish Officers. He went therefore to Paris,
where he was received by the King, and all the Nobles like a Prince, with much
magnificency and demonstration of joy, and had his business concluded to his
mind, the King subscribing to all his known desires; and thus he took upon
him the service of the Crown of France. And because the French desired the
King of England should at this present crisis, somewhat declare himself for
the restitution of the Palatinat, to the Princes his Nephews, they resolved to
send away Sergeant Major-Generall Ruthen, a Scotch-man, and one of high esteem
in War, who had served the Crown of Swethland 30 years, to London; to the end
that being practiced in such like affairs, he might show his Majesty of
England how easily he might then recover the Palatinat from the Imperialists,
and Duke of Bavaria* if England would go to work to purpose, being assisted
by France and Swethland.

The Saxons who had retreated from Magdeburg, being recruited by 8000 Soldiers
which were brought unto them by Azfelt, Sergeant Major-Generall of the
Battle, did pass back again over the Sala, to set upon Bannier. He hearing
thereof, arose suddenly from those parts, and retired toward Magdeburg, to be
aiding to that place, which he was very unwilling to lose, since the abode of
the Swedish Forces in those Provinces depended thereupon, it being a fitting
place to invade Saxony, and a place whereunto to retreat in case of any hard
encounter: But being followed at the heels by the Imperialists he could not
make such haste, but that the Saxons got up to his Rear, routed them, and slew
about 400 Swedes, who not long after cried quittance with them; for the Saxons
running confusedly here and there, out of a desire of booty, they were met by
the Swedish Horse, who routed two of their Regiments, killing, and taking about
500 of them, and thereby likewise they lost the Town of Bernberg, seated on
the Sala, upon the Confines of the Bishopric, wherein above 50 Soldiers that
were there quartered were put to the Sword. Oranghell entering on the other side
into la Marca, (a Province between Pomerania, Saxony, Brandeburg, and Slesia,)
with about 8000 men, came without any withstanding to the Gates of Franckfort
upon Oder; for by his unexpected arrival, and that Province wanting men to
make head against him, he had free leave to go whither he would, and to sack
many Towns, from which the Swedes got rich booty, and good store of Beeves and
Horses.

The King of Denmark knowing that these times wherein the Emperor was greatly
molested, might serve fitly for him to advantage his Crown, (for that 'twas
likely the Emperor would endeavor to give him satisfaction, thereby to win
his friendship, as also to make him break with the Swedes) had upon this
occasion dispatched away an Ambassador to Vienna, to desire the Emperor to
confer the Bishopric of Bremen upon a son of his, as also to negotiat
some other affairs; who was graciously received, and sent away contented: For
the Emperor that he might have good correspondency with that King during these
troubles, invested him in that Bishopric which he pretended unto, which being
in the Swedes possession, it was a good means to bring this King to break
with them; for he verily believed, they would not forgo it, and the other
pretending right thereunto, this was the way to set them together by the ears,
and thereby likewise to make a league with Denmark, which doubtlesly would
have succeeded, had the Parliament of Denmark yielded to the Kings desires;
but the Danes not intending to break peace with the Swedes, as knowing the
prejudice of War, businesses proceeded slowly on, and nothing was concluded.

Count Coloredo was upon the Confines of France, who thought to advance into
that Kingdom, and by inrodes to enrich himself and his Soldiers. He
therefore arose from his quarters with 24 Companies of Horse, and past over the
Mosell to join with 2000 Crabats, and so invade the French to some purpose;
yet did not this endeavor take effect, for the Crabats, mindful of what had
befallen them in their inrode some months ago, denied to go with him; so as
he advanced with his own only Horse, and being got into Champania, sacked
diverse Villages, chased some French Troops, and got so far into the
Country, as that Marshall De la Force, having time to march with his men to
the Mosell, by which Coloredo was to re-passe, intercepted him, and after a
gallant skirmish on both sides, he forced Coloredo to think upon a retreat,
who not being able to recover any place of safety, for all the passages of the
River were pre-possessed, together with the loss of his booty and most of his
men, he himself was taken prisoner by the French, by whom he was civilly
received, (as is the custom of that honorable Nation,) and treated with such
courtesy, as is used by the French Nobility to men of worth. The Marshall
invited him that very night to supper, where he received much satisfaction from
La Force, and all the French Gentry, who were much pleased to have bereft the
Emperor of so ingenious and valiant a Gentleman.

After the rout given to Serbellone, Rohan being desirous to proceed; and
thinking how he might get footing in the King of Spaines Territories, and open
his way into the State of Milan (where many wise men are of opinion, he would
have made some strange proof of his valor) he having no more to do in the
Valteline, which was now wholly possessed by the French Forces: And considering,
that when he should have taken Pradell, over against the River, underneath the
Mountains, and near the Lake, he might easily likewise take Francesca and
Gravedone, little Towns along the Lake toward the West. On the third of
April he quit his quarters, April 3.
and seeming by false fires to march elsewhere, he both by water and by land
came to the said Pradell, the which he luckily took, as he also did Francesca
and Gravedone; the which Town he made his Soldiers sack, knowing that he
could not keep it, as not having orders from his King to quit the Valteline,
nor Forces enough to beat the Spaniards led on by Serbellone, who came eagerly
against him. He therefore retreated to his former quarters, giving out that he
had sacked Gravedone, as knowing if the French had not done it, the Spaniards
would.

These happy successes being neglected by the French, who were thought able to
have advanced into the State of Milan, as well for that Rohan had with him 4000
Foot, and about 600 gallant Horse; as also, that he was not only accompanied
by Fortune, but cried up by Fame, which did immortalize his name, and render
him reverenced and dreaded by his Enemies; made the Grisons somewhat suspect,
that the Kings orders for his not going out of the Valteline, were not
occasioned for his want of Forces, nor less out of fear, that the places he
had made himself Master of should be taken by the Austrians, (as was given
out) but to keep the Grisons from possession of the Valley, which was
faithfully promised them before the French came thereinto, and perhaps with
intention when they should have achieved their ends in Milan, to have the same
pretensions upon them as upon the Spaniards.

Hereupon, as jealousies in point of liberty (chiefly amongst those who are
accustomed thereunto) are of a nice and tender nature, and such as any little
suspicion is able to cause diffidence to, the Grisons, who had brought the
French Forces into the bosom of their liberties, not out of any intention to
assubject themselves thereunto, nor yet to let them partake of what they had
gotten and promised unto them, but to receive the usurped state from their
protection, thinking that now, when they had obtained their desires, the French
should make their words good, declaring themselves able with their own Forces
to preserve their recovered patrimony, began to have sinister opinions of the
French-mens actions. From whence a desire of independent liberty budding
forth, those evils ensued afterward unto the French, which perhaps they had
not met withal had they governed themselves otherwise. For by re-calling their
Soldiers from those Valleys, and by maintaining necessary Garrisons of the
Switzers and Grisons therein, they would not only have held good
correspondency with those Colleagues, and have undeceived those Princes who
thought their Arms tended only to their own greatness, but might have hoped
for some considerable advantage from such a Chiefetaine as was Rohan, and from
such a strength as was his, so experienced in other parts, at least if they
would have made use of them. But as the immoderate desire of government is
always hunger-starved, so as it can hardly come near what belongs unto
another without taking some morsells thence; so many will have it, that the
French reaped not those effects which at the first was hoped for, by reason of
their confidence and too far enlarged thoughts. And moreover, many are of
opinion, that Rohans firm foundation in Protestanisme whereof he was a chief
professor, and one who firmly believed he should never be forsaken by those of
the same Religion, helped at first to make the French withdraw their friendship
from the Grisons; for the interest of state is the only hand which holds fast,
or lets loose the affection as well of Christians as of Pagans.

When Mentz was recovered by the Imperialists, they re-called the Elector
thereof, who when the King of Swethland appeared first in Germany in Arms, was
fled to Cobn. The Spaniards foresaw, that if the Emperor, who was now of good
age, should dye during these present emergencies, before his Son should be
declared King of the Romans, there might be fear enough the Empire might not
continue in the house of Austria, it being a difficult business to get all the
Electors to a Diet to that effect. For certainly the King of France would
pretend thereunto, and consequently by promises, gifts, and threats, he might
easily divert some of the Electors from their intentions of favoring the house
of Austria; and more particularly, they apprehended the Ecclesiastical
Electors, as they who having their states confining upon those parts which were
possessed by the French, were more exposed to their hostility then the rest. The
Hans-Townes being now freed of their Oath, might together with the other
Protestant Princes, join in the Election of such a Protestant Prince to be
Emperor as should put for it, which might make the Elector of Saxony look
after it, as one who has had former Emperors of his house. The Duke of
Bavaria, when he should find certainty in the assistance of France, when he
should know the edge thereof was not to be abated, and that France would at
least endeavor that the Empire should no longer continue in the house of
Austria, he might peradventure be persuaded to side with them: In fine, the
Austrian greatness being envied, and feared by the greatest part, if not by
all the Potentates of Europe, every one of them either openly or secretly
embracing this occasion, would add their helping hands to the dis-membring and
weakening of it in Germany; where, as it is without all doubt, that if they had
an Emperor joined with the so Potent house of Spain, there would be little
cause of jealousy of any of the other Electors upon whom the Election should
fall; for his power would be counterpoised by the other German Princes, and by
the house of Austria it self, which set the Empire aside, was very powerful
in Germany, having for its inheritance Bohemia, part of Hungary, the Austria's,
Alsatia, Stiria, Carinthia, Croatia, and other Provinces in that Kingdom. The
Spaniards therefore were of opinion, that this apparent disorder was to be
prevented, and that the succession should be secured whilst the Dutch fought
under their Masters Standard: They therefore negotiated with the Elector of
Mentz, as the first Elector of the Empire, and persuaded him, as one much
obliged to them for the re-possessing of his State, to intimate the Diet at
Ratisbon, wherein many matters pertaining to the safety of the Empire might be
treated on, as also a choice might be made of a King of the Romans to succeed
the Emperor, so to secure Germany from such alteration as might easily happen
if the Emperor should do otherwise then well. To this the Elector of Mentz
gave way, inviting the rest of the Electors to meet at Ratisbon on the 24th day
of June next ensuing, June 24.
where his Caesarian Majesty should likewise be, and the King of Bohemia, who
has the seventh voice amongst the Electors.

The Imperialists heard of the invasion made by Oranghell in La Marca, wherein
taking likewise Golchenitz by assault, he put all the Imperial Garrison to the
Sword. Whereupon, fearing least likewise he might set upon Frankfort upon Oder,
Colonel Vngher, who was in Slesia, was sent with 5000 Caesarian Soldiers to
succor that City. At whose arrival, the Inhabitants thereof were as much
joy'd as they were much terrified at the news of the invasion; so as it
behoved the Swedes to face about and prosecute their first design, which was
to join with Bannier for the preservation of Magdeburg, and to oppose
themselves to the ways of the Saxons and Imperialists, which when the Duke of
Saxon understood, he made Maracini advance with his men toward Oder, to hinder
Oranghells further proceedings, or his joining with Bannier, which if it had
happened time enough, that Elector would have had somewhat else to do, then to
have sitten down before a strong Town which had a pretty Army in the Field to
assist it.

The business of Magdeburg, being by common consent agreed upon by the
Electorall Council, and all Provisions made tending thereunto, The Elector
past over the Elb at Wirtenberg, before any addition of Forces were come to
Bannier, with 25000 fighting-men, and 38 piece of Cannon, and in battle array
advanced to Strastan, where Bannier was with the Swedish Army, who hearing of
the Saxons approach had fortified himself, and put his men in readiness to
fight, though this were rather but to show he seemed not to fear them, then
that he really had any equivalent strength; for Bannier, who was a very wise
man in warlike affairs, knew very well he had not Forces sufficient to oppose
so numerous an Army, all his men not amounting to above 14000. And therefore
making it known that his courage failed him not, he privately by night parted
from his quarters, destroying them, and all the Towns through which he past.

And that the Saxons might not know whether he retreated, but be confused in
their following of him, he left the Camp full of fires, though no body was
therein; and having put part of his Foot into Magdeburg, he with his Horse,
wasting all the neighboring Territories, retired to Serbest (some six hours
march from Magdeburg) overrunning all parts thereabouts, and pillaging the
Towns even to Brandeburg, and from thence to Havell, to the end, that the
Saxons, finding neither Victuals nor Forage, might be incommodiated in their
Siege, and not be able to keep long before that City; and meeting with two
Regiments of Saxons, who were advanced to watch over and oppose his designs,
being in condition to withstand them, for some of Maracinies men were come up
to him, he engaged himself with them in a gallant fight, routed them, and
took from them eleaven Standards, flew 200. took many prisoners, and returned
again to Serbest.

But the Elector having sent some Barques of Ammunition, and instruments of
War down the River to Rossemburg, a Town upon the Sala and Elb, he himself
likewise advanced thither, being joined with Azfelt, who brought with him about
9000 fighting-men, and having made two Bridges upon Boats over the Elb and
Sala, he commanded Azfelt to advance toward Magdeburg, on the Bishopric of
Halberstats side, and he himself past with his men on the other side the Elb
to set upon Bannier, to drive him from Zerbest, and to begin the Siege. But he
found the Swedes parted from thence, and quartered between Magdeburg and
Werben in Tregemonde, where they expected Oranghell, who was already at Stetin
with 8000 Soldiers. They therefore halted here, and fortified themselves,
making a Bridge, that as time should serve they might succor Magdeburg, which
being strongly set upon by the Saxons, those within the Town did valiantly
defend it, and by gallant and continual sallies, did annoy the Enemy in their
(...) and quarters.

The Hollanders did now besiege and batter Sckinck-Sconce, the former loss
whereof (as has been said) did much trouble them, in succor whereof,
Colonel John de Nassaw was come with his men to Cleves, a City three leagues
distance from thence; and the Spaniards were likewise advanced, who tried on
all sides, though in vain, to surprise the Hollanders in their Trenches, who
were so well fortified with Trenches, re-doubts, and their men did so
desperately behave themselves, as the Spaniards holding it impossible to break
into them, resolved to return to Cleves and Goch, where a little before, to
the universal sorrow of the Infanta, and all the Commanders of that Army, the
Marquis of Aytona dyed, a Gentleman greatly wise, and as well courteous in his
demeanor, as valiant and experienced in War. At this retreat the Hollanders
being much encouraged, and not desisting day and night to batter and assault
the Fort, they at last set upon it with such force and boldness, as the
defendants wanting further means to maintain it, and the Hollander being dead
therein who had surprised it, and who was sent thither by the Spaniards to
defend it, May 26.
they Articled on the 26th day of May, and on the 30th of the same Month about
900 Foot marched out, with their Arms, Baggage, Drums beating, Colors flying,
and 4 pieces of Cannon, and marched toward Ghelders, and the Hollanders
entered, to the great applause and ineffable content of all the States and
people of those Provinces.

But if Fortune favored the Hollanders, in assisting them so quickly to
compass their desired enterprise, she frowned upon the Imperialists before
Hannaw; for though Lamboye was succored by 3000 Soldiers, and that he did
more and more streighten the Fort, the Swedes and Inhabitants, by valiant
defending themselves, and by unheard of daring, and continual sallies,
annoying the Caesarian quarters, they kept them at distance and in awe; and
making excursions even to the banks of the Maine, they fired the Barques that
were sent to Franckfort, which caused a great dearth in that City, the
Inhabitants whereof were reduced to that point, as they durst not for fear of
the Garrison of Hannaw go one mile out of the City, nor live in the
neighboring Villages.

Whilst affairs went thus in Germany, great preparation for War was made in
Flanders, and all Europe stood as a spectatrix inquisitive what the event of so
great provisions made on all sides would be. The Spaniards having sent the
Duke of Alcala to the State of Milan, to assist in the government of that
Dukedom, Leganes not being able to be both in Milan, and in the field at once,
made it known, that the French increasing every day more and more in
Montferrat, gave out they would by force of Arms march into the State of
Parma. Whereat they being much troubled, (for that enterprise being accompanied
with the diversion which they might have on the Piacenzan side would very much
molest them) general consultations being had in Pavia between the Duke
D'Alcala, Leganes, Mello, and Spinola, 'twas at last resolved upon, that their
Forces should retreat from the Territories of Piacenza, and advance into the
Country of Tortona toward Castellnovo, to oppose the French in their passage,
if they should endeavor to come by the Valley of Rati, leaving Garrisons
notwithstanding in the Castle of Saint John, and Rottofredo; and that Gamba
Carta should go with the Horse to the Confines; and Cannon and other necessary
Provisions being sent from Pavia, they likewise advanced to Castellnovo; and
Leganes and Spinola having viewed the fortifications of Valenza, and of other
parts, and munited all advantageous places which might hinder the French in
their Passage, they sent the remainder of their Forces to the Country of Pavia,
beyond the Poe, and the other into Novara under the command of Don Martine de
Aragona. Villa and those of Parma taking heart at this departure, from the
parts about Piacenza resolved to move, and make some advantageous inrode,
as well to refresh their people, as to bereave the Spaniards of Forage and to
win credit; Villa therefore advanced to la Stadella, a place in the Territories
of Pavia, upon the Confines of Piacenza, beyond the Poe; and having beaten up
some Horse-quarters he marched forwards, sacked Arena, and Pantelbera; near the
Poe, and retreated with some booty, though but of little valued, for all the
Inhabitants upon those Confines, fearing some such like encounter, had already
conveyed the best of their Goods and Movables into strong holds, or into Towns
not subject to such surprisals. Crequi on the other side, not desirous to stand
idle, but to comfort at least the Duke of Parma, who not brooking any delay,
pressed for his promised succor; and willing to acquit himself of those
rumors, which began already to be common discourse against his government, by
seeming ready to pass into the Piacenzan Country, understanding what
provisions the Spaniards made to oppose his passage; that he might divert
their Forces elsewhere, and consequently find them weak there where he
intended to set upon them, and so happily compass his end, which differed much
from what the Spaniards imagined, for the French were rather desirous to enter
into the heart of the State of Milan, rich in Commodities, then into the State
of Parma which was ruined; He made the Savoyards advance into the Langhe, a
Country lying between the State of Genua and the Territories of Alessandria,
that he might draw the Spaniards thetherward, whilst he might set upon them on
another part: But they warily foreseeing the French-mens drift, kept
themselves close in a body, and provided for the other side by the Forces that
were quartered in Alessandria, and the adjacent parts, being more troubled with
the keeping of the Towns in the State of Milan, then at the Duke of Parma's
being gone to his own State.

The Duke of Rohan, who was gone from Gravedone in the Valteline, desiring to
do somewhat in prejudice of the Kings of Spaines Dominions, acquainted his
King, how the Spaniards had a building in the Valsazena, near the Town called
Lech, wherein they made their Cannon Bullets; and that to bereave them of it,
would be much to their prejudice: his answer was, he had leave to do it, but
not to advance any further, nor forsake his holds in the Valteline, so as they
might be possessed by the Austrians or Grisens, who began now to seem little
satisfied with the French. Having then secretly got his men together, and
divided into three Bodies, the one under Monsieur Fridelliere, the other under
Monsieur De Leches, and keeping the third with himself, he commanded
Fridelliere, that as he past by Gergherlla he should storm two holds, wherein
were but a few Spaniards, who being unexpectedly set upon and surprised, had
not time to prepare for defense. Leches past by the Mountain Barras, and
storming another hold possessed by the Spaniards, he advanced as far as
Vestrin; and the Duke with the rest of the Foot past over the little Lake, and
came likewise to Vestrin, accompanied notwithstanding by good Vollyes of of
Ordnance from Serbellon's quarters; where gathering together the other
Soldiers, he came without any gaine-saying to Ballan, and from thence to
Introbio in the Valsazena, from whence he advanced further, and beating down
the aforesaid building, he came as far as the Bridge over the Leech, which
when he had well viewed and considered, he returned to Introbio; where not
finding whereupon to live, and fearing lest he might be intercepted, for by
this time the A'larme was given every where, he retreated to his former
quarters in the Valteline: He brought back with him much booty and great store
of Cattle, for the Inhabitants, who slept securely at their own homes, dreamt
not of such a surprisall.

But if the French had good success in these parts, the Imperialists were not
idle upon the Rhyn; for Gallasse sent Forcats with 1000 Crabats to beat up some
of the French quarters about Mentz, who charged upon some French Troops,
worsted them, and chased them even to the Gates of Ments, wasting and
destroying diverse Tow^es, together with the French quarters, and bringing back
good store of booty with him. And Gallasse himself went with his Army from
about Mentz, and marched toward Confluenza, a City possessed by the French; the
Garrison whereof seeing the Imperialists come, and knowing themselves not able
to defend it, robbed the Town of what was best in it, and retreated to
Harmesteime, a strong hold not far off.

The troubles of the house of Austria increasing every day, and Ruthen being
arrived at London, who as has been said, was sent expressly to acquaint the
King of England how affairs went in Germany, and that it was now a fitting
time to demand the restitution of the Palatinate from the Emperor, and to
remit the Princes of that most Noble Family into their patrimony: The Earl of
Arundell, one of the prime and richest Subjects of that Kingdom, was sent
about that business to Caesar, which had been granted, had not those
Countries, and that which imported more, the Electorall dignity fallen upon
the Duke of Bavaria, from whom it was not fair to take it away without good
satisfaction, it being conferred upon him for the expense he had been at in
the Emperors service, in which he had always upon all occasions contributed
his Counsel, Moneys, Forces, his expenses arising to many millions of
Dollars, and hazarded his life. Neither did it become the Austrians to leave
him unsatisfied, who had been, and continued to be their loyal friend, thereby
to please a Foreign Crown, which when it should have obtained all it
pretended unto, would upon occasion forget the courtesy; for the friendship of
Princes continues only so long as their own interest is therein concerned,
which they affirm ought to be preferred before all obligation, before all
alliance. And if upon these present emergencies the Emperor should have
forgone his good intelligence with Bavaria, one of the chief Princes of
Germany, served by a brave and veteran Army, he should have forgot the true way
of corresponding with that which his proper interest required. The Ambassador
was sumptuously received, entertained with extraordinary civilities, satisfied
only in hopes and complements, but prospered not in his negotiation. And
again, the Imperialists did prefer the satisfying of Bavaria, before giving
way to the King of great Britains pretenses, for that the neighborhood of
Bavaria was more behovefull for them; as also, for that it stood not with the
self-interest of England to foment the French, since it complyes not with that
great Potentate to see his neighboring Princes grow greater, which may
afterward cause jealousies in himself; and it not being possible for the
English to break with the Austrians without much advantage to the French; the
Austrians knew well enough, that though the English might peradventure bark,
so to fright them, they would not for the aforesaid reasons bite.

Hannaw held out yet stoutly for the Swedes, the Garrison whereof by continual
sallyes did not a little prejudice the Imperialists quarters; the Protestants
very well knew of what consequence the succouring and maintaining of this place
was; for it would be a continual goade in the Austrians sides, and a place fit
for the Colleagues to retreat unto, if at any time they should have men enough
to re-enter into Franconia and the Palatinate. The Landsgrave of Hessen was
looked upon as a man of great concernment; who having refused conditions of
peace propounded unto him by the Caesarians and Saxons; and having joined in
the League now again contracted between Swethland, France, and Holland,
joined all his Forces which were about 7 or 8 thousand men with Lesley, who did
then command the Swedish Forces in those parts; and after he had raised the
Siege from before Osnabruch, Hessen betook himself to the taking in of
Mynden, (a place of no small consideration in those times, and as affairs then
went) by Stratagem; assisted therein by intelligence, which he held with some
of the Inhabitants, who were not well inclined to the Caesarian party, the
which he effected thus: He conveyed into the Town some choice Soldiers in
certain Chests, like such as Merchants put their Ware in, and sent others
thither in Countrymens apparel, seeming to have somewhat to sell; who coming
to the Gates at the hour agreed upon, and the others getting out of the Chests
which were conveyed into the Conspirators houses, those who guarded some
Wagons, shot at those that were upon the draw-bridges, and the others,
together with them, unsheathing their hidden Weapons, fell upon the Court of
Guard, insomuch as the Romanists ran rather where they might hope for
safety, then to their Weapons for defense; it being usual for men in
unexpected accidents to fail of that courage, which upon better advertisement
they are not wanting in. The Swedes therefore became masters of the Gate, by
which they let the Horse in, who staid attending hard by; and thus did the
Hessians win a Fort by Stratagem, which they had small reason to hope to get
by force. Of the Romanists there dyed about 400 Soldiers, three Captains, and
one Lieutenant Colonel; the Governor, together with many Officers and men of
quality were taken prisoners, and the Citizens ransomed themselves from
Military insolence, and sacking, at the rate of 100000 Dollars. The Swedes lost
one Captain, and about 35 Soldiers. Hereupon the Lansgrave taking heart,
marched to succor Hannaw; which when Lamboi understood, who commanded the
Caesarian Camp in chief, he rose with his Horse from his quarters, and
retreated to Stenheim, not thinking himself able to withstand the Forces that
came against him; so as the Swedish horse gallantly advancing, and being backed
by their well ordered Foot, they relieved the Town with 300 Wagons of
Provision, and changed the Garrison which was much lessened, and wearied by
continual action. They then set upon some lesser Forts thereabouts, where some
Imperialists were left to defend them; for they understood their succor was
not far off, and were minded to return to before that Town, when the Swedes
should be gone from thence which had so much indammaged the neighboring
Territories; but having made good their Trenches against two assaults, they
were at last overcome and forced to fly by the Swedes, who behaved themselves
courageously, that so they might do their work before the Imperialists that
were about Mentz should come up and succor their fellows: They therefore
about two a clock at night, made certain fires to make the Swedes believe that
they prepared for defense, and that these were signs of some news of succor,
or of some other intelligence held with the Austrians, and so quit their
quarters, and went toward Franckfort; but they prospered not therein,
according to their imagination; for the Swedes being aware thereof, pursued
them with their Horse, took many of them prisoners, and brought them under
their Colors. The Protestant Inhabitants who were not over-confident of being
thus relieved, and therefore the more joyed thereat, did for three days
together express their rejoicing, by drinking (according to the Dutch fashion)
to the health of the said Landsgrave, and the Swedish Commanders, the Cannon
going off, and the Drums beating at every health; insomuch, that were it for
overmuch content, or overmuch wine, the chief Magistrate of the Town drunk
himself dead, whereat all his friends were much troubled; for he was a merry
conceited old man, a good companion, and one who was most heartily affected to
the Swedish party, and the Protestant Commanders.

Gallasse, who was about Spire to observe the proceedings of the French, and to
withstand them, hearing of the Hessians approach; and fearing lest the Swedes
encouraged by their success, might advance further into Veteravia, or the
Palatinat, where many Towns in which his Soldiers were quartered could not
hold out against them, past speedily over the Rhyn with part of his Army to
Worms, and joining with Lamboi, marched toward them, resolving to face the
Swedes, and give them Battle in the field: But he found they were already
retreated; for apprehending danger both on this and on the other side, since
the Catholic League was raised from before Osnabruch, and was upon their march
toward them, they were contented with having honorably succored that place,
and so returned toward Cassell, the Landsgrave City of abode.

Waymer having taken pay of the Crown of France, being declared by the King
General of all his Forces in Alsatia, and being promised to be invested into
all, that by his Forces he should win, upon condition that he should hold
them in Fee of the Crown of France, and Swethland, by whose consent the said
charge was given to this Prince, thinking it now time to undertake somewhat;
and the intentions of the French being to drive all the Imperial Garrisons out
of Alsatia, that so in time they might be wholly possessed thereof, which would
have been of great concernment to them (for to boot with enlarging their
Dominion, and the joining so rich a Province to their Kingdom, they did the
more secure the Dukedom of Lorayne, having the Rhyn for their Trench, by
means whereof they could hardly be injured on that side by the Dutch; as also
they did thereby facilitate the way to their vast designs, of being
Arbitrators of all the Cities, and Princes of the Empire) after having made
necessary Provisions for his march; June, 10.
He on the 10th of June joined in Daisten with the Cardinal of Vallet, who
was then superintendent of his Majesty's Arms, and with Colonel Hebrun a
Scotch-man, a greatly experienced Soldier, continually verst in War, more
particularly for many years under the King of Swethland, and who was not long
since taken into the King of France his pay, under title of field-Marshall. He
moved with his Army toward Benfield, where many Imperial Troops having in a
manner besieged it, they did not stand the hazard of their approach, being by
orders from Gallasse commanded to retreat to Waissemberg, where Gallasse was
returned with the gross of his Army to withstand the proceedings of the
French, after the Swedes had returned from Hannaw. Nothing of action happened
here, save only, that some Companies that had staid in the Villages about
Strasburg, with intention to pillage them, and carry away the booty, were
Charged, and routed by the French, and the most of them slain, and taken
prisoners. After this, having victualled Beufield, Sclestat, Colmar, and other
Towns thereabouts which were in great scarcity of Victuals, they came before
Zabern, a Town joining to the Mountains toward Lorayne, which are four
leagues distant from Strasburg; which Town is only surrounded with Walls and
Ditches after the ancient fashion; but those Walls are toughly caemented, and
moreover well accommodated with modern Trenches, and Palisadoes in the weakest
part thereof; wherein were diverse Companies of the Imperialists, who encouraged
by Colonel Milheim their Governor, and comforted by Gallasse with hopes of
speedy succor, seemed as if they would valiantly defend themselves; but a
great Trench which the Imperialists had made being furiously set upon, they
took it by force, and the Defendants fled into the City, where being pursued
by the French, both the Duke and the Cardinal, that they might make use of the
fear which they discried in the Enemy, did with their Swords in their hands
enter the Gate; but the Garrison being quickened, at the news hereof hastened
thither, and as they went did valiantly defend themselves, the streets were
baracadoed up, Tiles and such like things of offense were thrown out of
windows, and from the tops of houses, insomuch as the French were enforced to
give back, the Cardinal, and Waymer being lightly hurt, the former with a
stone, the other with a Musket shot in the Arm.

When the French moved on this side against Alsatia, at the same time the
Prince of Condee (who had raised about 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse for the King
in Burgundy, and had mustered these men in Aussona, a place upon the Frontiers
of the Franche County, seated upon the Some, environed with strong rampired
Walls, and had brought thither all things requisite for War) marched into the
said County, and spoiling the Country, and plundring the Towns of Saint Ilie,
Rochfort, le Temple, Gierey, Bermont, Santans, Chastean Roillan, and other
neighboring places, he set down before Dole, a chief City, where the Spanish
Ministers of State keep, who have the custody of that Province; that Town is
seated near the River Doux, upon the Frontiers of the Duchy of Burgundy, well
fenced with Bullwarks, great Towers and Ditches, and guarded by good numbers of
Soldiers; the Prince began to play upon it with 12 piece of Cannon, but the
Town bravely defending it self, kept the French aloof off to their little
profit.

Let us now return to the King of Denmark, who being invested (as has been
said) by the Emperor into the Bishopric of Bremen; and fearing lest the
Towns thereof which were in the Swedes possession should not be yielded up
unto him, did at this time send about 1800 Foot and 400 Horse to Glichestat,
and quartered them in Altena, not out of any intention of breaking Peace with
the Crown of Swethland, (for the Danes would not give way thereunto,) but to
frighten them, and make them bethink themselves of making him their friend,
and to be the readier to yield to his demand, to the which the Swedes would the
more apply themselves, it being usual for Princes to put a value upon armed
Neighbors, and therefore he thought they would be careful not to discontent
him when they should see him in Arms, but did rather hope they would gratify
him, that so they might be by him assisted, more particularly upon the present
occasions.

The Duke of Parma who was in Montferrat, soliciting the French for succor,
finding palpably that they would never consent to dismember their own Forces,
so to carry them into his Country not a little ruinated by the Spaniards, and
by his own Soldiers; which if they had done, besides the engaging of
themselves therein, they would have made the other confining Princes and
Potentates take up Arms, who studying the peace of Italy, it was not to be
imagined that they would assist them, but rather be averse (as it has been
said) and endeavor their departure from those Confines, it being too dangerous
to have a poor and desperate Army upon the Confines of a rich and opulent
Territory; and considering that his longer abode there, might be more
prejudicial to him, for when the Inhabitants of Piacenza and Parma should have
their Prince far from them, and be themselves without succor, and so much
annoyed by the Spanish Forces, they might perchance bethink themselves of some
alteration, and endeavor a Peace; he resolved to depart secretly, accompanied
only by three Gentlemen whom he most esteemed, and to go to Parma, as he
luckily did, it being whispered that he was not well satisfied with Crequi. The
French perceiving this mean while that people murmured every day more and more
at their delays, seeing they did just nothing, after a long dispute what they
were best to do, they agreed all in a resolution, to march with their Forces
into the heart of the State of Milan, and see whither they might thereby
advantage themselves, before the Spaniards should be succored by aides which
were preparing in all parts. And though they foresaw it would be a difficult
piece of business, seeing they had much fewer men then were requisite for such
an enterprise, yet encouraged in that fortune favors bold undertakings; that
there is nothing which more troubles men's minds then great resolutions; that
the counsels even of the wisest, are not more confounded with any thing then
unexpected enterprises; and that the Spaniards, though no^ inferior to the
French in Forces, yet being much more exposed to the uncertainty of success,
would not so easily hazard that to the fury of a French Army in the field,
which they might preserve by temporizing; they rose with all the Forces they
could make from their quarters, leaving their Garrisons but weakly manned: And
having mustered together with those of Savoy about 12000 Foot and 3000 Horse,
they marched into the field about the midst of June; and having thrown a Bridge
over the Tanure, they went with some Troops of Horse toward Fibesan and
Castellatzo, Towns of Allessandria, prejudicing somewhat the people
thereabouts; for they fired some Towns, and Cottages, and took the Castle of
Rodetto, which was guarded by 40 men, causing such suspicion and jealousies, as
that accordingly as it was cunningly given out, 'twas believed they would go
into the State of Parma. The Duke of Alcana and Leganes, together with the
other chief Commanders, went to Tortona, and sent a good part of their
Soldiers to places of most consequence between the said City and Castlen^vo.
But the French entertaining the Spaniards here with part of their Soldiers,
endeavored, though in vain, to surprise Valenza; for the Governor thereof
finding their drift, was very vigilant. On the other side, they speedily past
over the Poe, and took their ready way to the State of Milan; They took
Oleggio, and Castelletto, two open Towns, and Fontene, which after having made
three days gallant defense, yielded; before the which, as he was discovering
a Battery, Monsieur Toiras Marshall of France, was slain with a Musket shot,
he being then with the Duke of Savoy, and without any employment: And not
meeting with any encounter, they threw two Bridges, the one over the Tesine,
the other over the Navillio, so as the Savoyards were quartered in Oleggio; and
Crequi together with the Marquess Villeroy taking their quarters at Sperone,
intrencht themselves upon the fields of Castene, near a great Ditch on the left
hand, called Panperduto, so termed in former times by the French, because they
had lost their labor there, Cassina di Tornavento being on the right hand;
where cutting off the water from Navillio, and overrunning the neighboring
Towns, and Villages; the Country suffered much for want of water, and all the
people were mightily afraid. Allarmes were given throughout the whole State,
and many fearing that Milan would be lost, fled from that City, and withdrew
themselves to the State of Venice, as likewise did many well-accommodated
Countrey-People, from the Neighboring Towns and Villages.

At the news hereof, though it were one of the saddest that had yet befaln that
State, the Spaniards were no whit daunted, nor dismaide, but with all
readiness prepared to obviat the evil which was likely to prove greater unto
them, if the French should advance further, or could be able long to maintain
what they had gotten; for Milan being full of people, and wanting water, would
have been brought to great streights, and so much the greater, for that she
should not have received any relief from those Towns, from whence she was
formerly furnished with abundance of Provisions, they being now sacked and
Pillaged by the French. Leganes* having therefore readily thrown a Bridge over
the Tesine, just against Vigevano, went to that Town, and gave command that
all the Neighboring People should come and join with him, as they forthwith
did. The Spaniards ends were to preserve themselves upon this emergency in the
strongest holds, expecting greater Forces which were preparing every where in
the Austrians Country; and that the French might lessen in their numbers by
running away, and by the hardness they endured in Forage and Victuals; and
by a body of men to entertain them in the Field, and to go whether need
should require, that by thus doing, they might enforce the French to retrea^.
Leganes did therefore send Count Maximillian Montecastello, with 800 Horse to
cut off the passages which lead from Brem to the French Camp; and having taken
order for all things requisite for the present occasion, and sent to all Towns
where any Soldiers were, that upon the report of two piece of Cannon they
should march toward Biagras, he staid there expecting the coming of some
people that were on the other side of the Poe, that so they might jointly set
upon the French Army, which people being departed from the Territories of
Tortona, afforded Marquis Villa opportunity to recover the Castle of S. John,
and to return that way into Montferrat, for he could no longer maintain his
Horse in the State of Parma by reason of the scarcity of Forage; and he was
likewise re-called by his Duke, who thought it more advantageous for the common
interest to prosecute the business in hand, then to keep his Horse to no
purpose in the Territories of Piacenza. Zaverne in Alsatia was likewise
straightly beset by the French, whose defendants, being to the number of 1500
to boot with the Inhabitants, did desperately dispute the business; and
Gallasse having numbered his men about Spire, prepared to succor that Town,
the loss whereof did more trouble him in point of reputation, that such a
place should be lost before the face of the Army, then that it was a loss of
any consequence or reflection.

The Elector of Saxony and the Imperialists, failed not in using all their
cunning and industry to complete the business of Magdeburg, against which they
played continually with their Cannon and Grenades, and had already reduced it
to a bad condition, for Azfelt cut off the succor which was sent thither from
Werben, under the command of Colonel Schulman near Tergemonde, routing three
Regiments of Swedish horse, and taking 9 Cornets. John de Were was all this
while before Liege to force that City, whose Inhabitants did so behave
themselves, as the Imperialists came always by the worst. The Prince of Conde
continued the Siege before Dole; the Landsgrave of Hessen, after having made
diverse inrodes in Westphalia, and taken some Towns of no great moment, was
before Statburg; and all the rest of the Potentates of Europe stood expecting
what the event would be of all the Forces and Provisions which were raised in
France, Spain, Germany, and all over Christendom: When the Infant and
Spanish Commanders, bethinking themselves how they might make a diversion with
most security and advantage, and knowing there was none more proper to be made
to that purpose then on Picardyes side, a great Province seated between
Champania, Normandy, Artois, and Lorayne, and nearest to the King of Spaines
Countries, they took it into their consideration. But in these their Counsels,
they met with many difficulties which argued against the enterprise, unless
they should first make themselves masters of the strong holds which were upon
those Frontiers, without which they could not advance but with apparent danger,
for then they should have no place whereunto to retreat, in case they should
meet with any hard encounter, which they were to expect; for France being a
warlike Nation, and prone to take up Arms, they might easily be encompassed,
and receive some notable rout. Therefore seeing no great appearance of good to
be done by force, the strong holds being well guarded and munited, they betook
themselves to cunning* and to endeavor how they might win the good will of
some of those Governors and other French Officers, knowing that Nation to be
desirous of noveltie, and that they are oft-times not contented with their
present condition, and which is worse, not well affectionate to their King and
the Ministers of State, proceed it either from their natures, or from the
inclination of their ill composed minds, or from their envy to see others
employed, or their distaste for not being treated so well as they themselves
think they deserve. They bent their brains unto the business, and to say
truth, Fortune was not faulty to them in the enterprise; for all the Dutch
being taken from the Territories of Liege, the differences between which City
and the Emperor was referred (as has been said) to the Umpirage of the
Elector of Cullen, by whose means they were allayd, the rest of the Soldiers
being yet quartered in the neighboring parts, and an Army being gathered
together of about 30000 Soldiers with 48 piece of Cannon, they made their
Arsenall at Cambrai, a City upon the Schelde, between Hannault, Artois, and
Picardy; and having corrupted the Governor of La-Chapelle, a Fort belonging to
the King of France upon those Confines, modernly fortified, they came before
it. The Governor thereof, that he might not app^^^e to be so base a villain,
did at first seem to make some defense, but afterward yielded it up, and
took pay of the Spaniard, as knowing his head would pay for it if he should
remain in the King of France his power.

The Governors of Chastellet and Corbie, places upon the same Frontiers, did
the like soon after, with whom the Spaniards having secured their retreat, and
opened their way into that Province, they marched speedily forwards, sacking
many Villages, and coming even to before the Gates of Amiens and S. Quinti^s;
for the French, not misdoubting any treachery in those Officers, were not then
provided with men sufficient to oppose such an invasion. The Alarm was
therefore given throughout all France, and particularly in Paris where the news
was ill interpreted; the Drums beat up everywhere, and Foot and Horse were
every where raised. His Majesty of France did wisely and undauntedly bear
those so bad tidings, which were understood to be so much the worse, as that
they had happened through the treachery of those whom he had believed to be
faithful, the which of all things else does most exasperate a Prince; for
since they cannot but trust their servants, a blow received through infidelity
is the bitterest of all others. He presently dispatched away the Duke of
Montbasson to Soisons, together with Monsieur De Mirtmont, the Marshall of
Bresse to Fera, the Marshall De la Force to Remis, Count D'Ales to Abeville,
Monsieur De Betune to Peroonne, Monsieur De Varnes, Captain of the Guard, to
Noion, and Monsieur De Ramboures to Dorlens, all of them being prime and
valiant men, who went to these strengths which were most esteemed of by his
Majesty, with orders, that to boot with the preservation thereof, they should
raise what possible numbers of men they could, to join afterward with the
Count of Soisons, who had directions to march thetherward with 8000 Foot and
2000 Horse, not only to oppose the Spaniards further Invasion, but to enter
upon Artois, till such time as his Majesty, and the Cardinal Richelie^,
having gathered together more men, which were marching toward them from all
parts, might not only drive the Spaniards from the places they had possessed,
but might also invade their Territories in Artois and Flanders. But Prince
Thomas marching forwards after the surrender of Castellet, and thinking that
the Governor of Guiscia, one of the strongest places on those Frontiers, would
do as the others had done, came before it, planted the Cannon against it, and
gave the Governor thereof to understand, That if he would surrender the place,
he should be so rewarded, as that he should for ever after live happy. But he
being true unto his King, answered the Prince, that he was so well prepared to
defend that place recommended to his trust, if his Highness would come in he
would throw open the Gates, to the end that the Spaniards might cheerfully
enter, where they should be by him received as became a man of honor, and one
who was faithful unto his Master; so as the Prince, perceiving he could
advance but little further, returned to Corbie, where all the rest of the
Spanish Army intrencht themselves.

The Spaniards heard of the great preparations of the French, and did greatly
fear to be much troubled, and to be forced to sorsake those Confines; for to
boot with these, the Hollanders prepared with all their might to come into the
Field, and undertake some great matter* whereupon they imagined to work no
small prejudice to France, by blowing the coal of ill affection, which some of
the people* Princes, and Nobility of that Kingdom, did inwardly bear to
Cardinal Richelieu, a faithful servant to that Crown, and as such a one much
envied and hated, by those, who desirous of noveltie, cove^ed to part the
Royal Mantle amongst them, no way minding the preservation of the weal
public; which if it had succeeded, and not been prevented through the
suspicion the French had of the Spaniards, and the hatred they bore them, they
might have hoped for good thereby. They therefore out of these hopes, published
a Manifes^o full of charitable conceptions and expressions, of a seeming care
of the welfare of poor Christians oppressed by the ambition of Ministers of
State, without either Conscience or P^etie, whereby they thought to provoke the
hatred of the people against the aforesaid Officers, and move ^ome intestine
flame, without which they could do no good against that Kingdom. They
therefore did thus publish to all Europe How the most Christian King was abused
by self-interessed Subjects, who had not the fear of God before their eyes,
and were evilly minded toward the public safety, and the Kings Person, whom
by fraudulent and politic maxims, they had caused to be a chief means of
diverse Wars in the Empire and King of Spaines Dominions, calling in and
introducing at his own charges stranger*Nations into those Provinces, and such
as were Enemies to the holy Church of Rome, ^as the Swedes, Holland^rs, and
others, assisting them with men and money, in such sort, as were it not for
Divine Providence, and the house of Austria, Christendom would by this time
become a prey to Heretics and Barbarians; and that the only end herein, was
the ruin of the Emperor and the King of S^ain, the which was sufficiently
manifest by his having purchased many Towns from the Swedes in A^satia* by his
possessing himself of others by his own Forces under the specious pretenses
of receiving Romanists into his protection; by having waged War with Flanders,
to which he had no color of pretense; by sending his Forces into the State of
Milan, and contrary to the Articles of Neutralitie, invaded in hostile manner
the Franch County; and that therefore the Emperor, and his most Catholic
Majesty, had with just reasons taken up Arms against that Kingdom, not out of
any intention to bereave the King of what was his, since the Spaniards, who
have enough of the world; and abound in charity, never covet what belongs to
another, but only thereby to reduce the King to an universal peace which was
so much desired by the Austrians for the welfare of the poor people, who are
those that at the last are only indammaged by War, and to get the States
restored which were taken from the Duke of Lorayne and others, as also to have
satisfaction given to the Queen Mother, and to have those Nobles restored to
their Estates who were banished the Kingdom, not for any fault of theirs, but
only for that they would not depend upon his Majesty's Ministers of State,
whom they knew to be no friends to France, and in particular upon the Cardinal
of Richelieu (whom they feared most of all the rest, having a genious opposite
to the Spaniards, and one who knew how the affairs of that Crown went)
wherein there would be charity and no little merit at Gods hands, and all the
world, if those people and Princes could persuade the King to punish those as
Traitors, who were the cause the Kingdom was so much weakened by assisting
strangers.

This Manifesto being published in France, and coming to the Court, afforded
occasion of laughter to the Lords there, who were much taken with the
expression of the Spaniards charity, in not coveting what belongs to another;
they found all this to be but an invention to throw seeds of di^^idence
between the great ones, too much inclined to noveltie, and to put them in mind
how their forefathers had strugled with their Kings; to do the like amongst
the people who were desirous of quiet, and not willing to undergo new
Impositions; and in fine, that this was but a bait to draw some malcontents
over to them, by whose means they pretended to receive no small benefit. Yet
was it not of force enough to have any outward operation, for the late example
of Monmerancy, and other great ones of the Conspiracy had sufficiently taught
them, that the Subject might hope to be borne withal, and pardoned for any
other fault save that of infidelity. And every one knew very well, that if the
Crown of France had consumed sufficient treasure by the government of such
Officers, yet were they secure from intestine Wars, whereby that flourishing
Kingdom had so much suffered in former times, and which were easy enough to
be renewed again; for every little distaste taken by a French Prince, was
sufficient to subvert whole Provinces; so as it was better to endure some
Taxations, then to be exposed to the insolences of a friend, and violence of
an enemy. Moreover, they saw a Dukedom of Lorayne joined unto the Crown, the
reveneues whereof did far exceed all the expenses they had been at, together
with so many other Cities in Alsatia and in Italy, where formerly they had not
one foot of ground, the maintaining whereof did keep the Enemies of the Crown
in continual suspicion, and afforded them means of thinking upon other
enterprises, and of helping upon all occasions such as were friends to France,
when they should be incombred by their Enemies.

The French having possessed themselves of the seat of Panperduto, and made their
Trenches there in the open Fields, which gave them no small hopes of further
advancement; and knowing, that without any more ado they should bring Milan
into great streights for want of Victuals, if carrying their Forces aside the
great Lake, they should cut from them those Provisions which were thereby
brought unto the City, they resolved upon the taking of Arona, a Town upon
the Tessine, in the mouth of the said Lake, which would make them to perfect
their design. They therefore marched with part of their Forces thetherwards,
but were not proserous in the attempt; for all the neighboring people taking
up Arms, together with others, under the command of Count Julius Caesar
Borromeo, they were saluted with many Cannon* shot from diverse places, which
were held by the Milanois on those Hills* so as it behoved them to retreat that
they might not dis-joint their Army which kept about Panperduto, expecting the
event of that enterprise, by the benefit whereof they designed, to mark where
they might have greatest hopes of advantage. But these proceedings were not
well interpreted by those of Milan, which made them murmur and complain of the
Spaniards, for that they had assembled so many men together, and kept them so
long in that State, to the so great incommoditie and loss of so many people,
whom they had not courage to defend now that they stood in need of their help.
At which the Spaniards being much galled, who foresaw the apparent danger that
over-hung them if they should make any further delay, they resolved to alter
their determination of keeping themselves in strong holds, so to reduce the
French to a scarcity of Victuals, and into a condition of receiving some
great overthrow, and propounded, that content might be given to the Milanois by
their undertaking some generous action, whereby the others minds which were so
far sunck in despair, might be somewhat comforted. Leganes therefore on the
22th of June, June 22.
went from Biagras where he mustred his Army, which (the Militia of the
Country being therein comprehended) consisted of 15000 Foot, and about 4000
Horse; he was accompanied by Don Francisco di Melo, Marquis Spinola, and many
other chief Commanders, and in a grave and sober march, he advanced in good
order toward the French Army, which kept in battle array within their
Trenches; but it being somewhat late, there only past an ordinary skirmish
between the Horse of both parties, which lasted almost all the night with
little loss to either side, for the Spaniards went warily to work, that they
might not be brought upon disadvantage; and the French attended some fitting
occasion to charge them upon advantage, so as the mean while the night came on
which stickled the business. Leganes notwithstanding, knowing very well the
Enemies condition, and finding in his Soldiers a great desire to fight,
appeared the next morning at Sunrising in good order before the French, who
kept themselves in battle array within their Trenches, and going boldly on,
with the Spaniish and Dutch Foot against the Trenches; the French, though they
did valiantly defend themselves and withstand their Enemies, who fought very
courageously, yet could they not keep one of their Foot battaglions from being
routed, which was charged by the Neapolitan Horse; for the French Horse, which
were on the left wing toward the Ditch of Panperduto, being played upon by 3
pieces of the Spaniards Ordnance which were placed upon the edge of the said
Ditch, and being thereby much indammaged, were wheeled about toward La Cassina
di Tornavento; from whence these Foot receding, and others by reason of their
fear, they retreated toward the River, under the shelter of some baracadoes,
and of an ambush of 600 Foot, which was placed in some little Woods therabouts.
Then Gambacorta, seeing what disorder the French were in, who forsook their
Trenches, cried out, Victory, Victory; and giving forward in the head of the
Horse, being scandalized at some words which Leganes said unto him, whilst he
dissuaded him for setting upon the French within their Trenches, who mocked
them as if the forbearance thereof proceeded from fear, he with two other of
his men leapt into the Trenches, and would certainly have given a great blow to
the French if the rest of the Horse could have immediately have leapt in after
him; but the Duke of Savoy being this mean while advanced from Oleggio,
upbraided the French Soldiers and Commanders with pusillanimitie, rallyed them
together, and encouraged them, made them face about and keep their Trenches;
whereupon returning from all parts to their former stations, and by their
continual showers of Musket Shot gaining ground, Gambacorta like a brave
Commander, with his Sword in his hand, purchasing immortal glory, was slain
with a Musket Bullet. Here was the fight begun again by the Spaniards, Dutch,
and Italians; and the French being reinforced by the Savoyards, did no less
return to defend their Trenches, and upheld the skirmish which was made by the
Horse of both sides near La Cassina; but at length all the Commanders behaving
themselves circumspectly, that they might not hazard the loss of a Battle,
the night came on, and Leganes finding that his men grew weary by reason of
their continued labor, and that his Horse suffered much for want of water,
thought it fitting to forbear further fighting; and keeping all night in the
field within the sight of the French, that he might show* no sign of fear^,
he in good orden retreated to Biagras, and the neighboring Towns* having
luckily sustained the onset which Colonel Monte of Verona made upon his Rear,
who was then Commissary-generall of the Savoyards Horse. The Duke of Savoyes
Men did upon this occasion so valiantly behave themselves, that most men are of
opinion, had it not been for them, the French Army had been utterly ruined. In
this action there were slain of both sides about 3000 Soldiers. All the
Spanish, and Italian Commanders behaved themselves singularly well, and were
exceedingly grieved at the loss of Gambacorta; as were the Savoyards at the
like of Toiras.

Gambacorta was a Gentleman who very well understood the affairs of War, a
Neapolitan by birth, not degenerating in his behavior, and proceedings, from
that civility for which his coun^^ey* is so famous; he was facetious, and
affable with the Soldier, and more generous then usual; his many services in
Flanders, Germany, and other places, and the employments which he worthily
discharged for his King, witnessed his fidelity, and great desire to show
himself a worthy servant to his Majesty; all his thoughts were only bent upon
his Prince his good; all particular advantage was totally banished out of his
imaginations; and exercising his ingenuity, and virtue of his mind even to his
death, he left an eternal memory to posterity of his imitable actions.

But such as was the sorrow and displeasure which the Spaniards felt by this
misfortune, such, and no what inferior to them, was the grie^e which the Duke
of Savoy, and many other Gentlemen expressed for the death of Toiras. This man
was not only held for one of the freest swords of France, but his wisdom and
his experienced understanding in affairs of War, was by all admired, which
had brought him to the degree of Marshall of France, and afterward to the
defense of Cassalle a Fort, which of how much greater reflection and
concernment it was to the King of France, and all the Princes of Italy, the
more was his honor in having the charge thereof given him, and his capacity
thereby approved; and which was by him with so much glory preserved, as he
might boast to have captivated not only the affection and good will of his
Contrymen, but even of strangers, and such as did not know him; who
professing to be inamored of his valor, did by their encomiums exalt him to
the height of merit, which fortune grants but to few, and that only at the
cost of laborious pain. Monsieur Toiras was very solid, and considerat in his
resolutions, wise in the executions thereof, and vigilant in their mannaging.
Self interest (then which there is no contagion more prejudicial in the
officers of Princes) he had none. He made appear unto the world, what a worthy
Commander, and well-deserving servant should be; and though by reason of some
sinister actions of a Brother of his, who sided with the Duke of Orleans, (for
which he was after punished) he was in some contempt (or be it but diffidence)
with the King, and had therefore withdrawn himsefe from his service, he did not
notwithstanding go less in the reputation which was held of him; the fault of
one Brother not being to be imputed to another that has been found to continue
faithful.

To return now unto the Army, you must know that when Leganes was retreated
from the aforesaid field, he dispersed his Soldiers into the neighboring
Villages, not yet out of sight of the French, and there he haulted, to refresh,
and reinforce his Army; that if need should be he might return again to
fight. The French lest they might be too far engaged kept in their former
Stations within their Trenches, and did it upon good grounds, for if they could
have kept themselves there any long time, they would have brought the City of
Milan into great danger for lack of* Water and Victuals. But they themselves
wanting Victuals every day more and more, which were taken from them by the
Garrisons of Nov^^a, Mortara, and other places full of Spaniards, July 1.
who flank't upon them, they on the first of July retreated to Castelletto, not
far from Sesto, a Town near the greater Lake, and sacked all the neighboring
Towns, which put those people into great frights, and made them distrust in
help from the Spaniards; for an opinion was spread abroad, and it was firmly
believed by the people, that the Spaniards would not give the French Battle
in open field, but be sure to destroy them by temporizing, which was known to
be their best course. But the common people being ignorant of State Interests,
and hard to be made understand reason, though never so apparent, did greatly
exclaim against and complain of the Soldiers, who had hitherto made great
brags, and canted it in the Piazzas, and in their quarters, where they behaved
themselves stoutly against the Battery of dishes, but occasion now being
offered, they could not find the way to defend those to whom they were so much
beholding; yet all this was but a tale; for they did wisely to preserve their
men together, which they had been at so great costs in assembling, on the
loss whereof depended the ruin of the State of Milan; and by entertaining the
first brunt of the French, when that should be over, to make them bid adieu to
their determinations; for being easilier overcome by Famine and unaccommodation
then by Arms, 'twas likely they would return to their former stations in
Montferrat, and Piemont, as it afterward fell out.

The Spaniards hoping well by reason of this their good success, and Leganes
having provided for all the Forts and strongholds of the State, by adding unto
their garrisons, that they might be ready on all sides to set upon the French,
who overrun the Country for Forage and Provisions; and having left a Body of
men at Biagras to set upon the Enemy on this side of Tesine, he advanced to
the station of Panperduto, and to the Sperone, which the Colleagues had
abandoned, and began presently to build a Fort whereby to secure the water of
Naviglio, and to hinder the French from getting it again so easily as they had
done. Don Martine d' Arago^a, marched toward the Country of Verselles, and
assaulted the Castle of Fontane, whose defendants willing at first to try some
Cannon shot, yielded, upon condition to march out with their Bag and Baggage;
Marching from thence into Allessandria, he likewise surprised Hannone, taken
not long before by the Colleagues, and put 100 Foot to the Sword who were
obstinat in the defense thereof. The French who were in the Fort at Brem,
perceiving hereby it was not good to be idle, they likewise set upon Fumello,
sacked the Town, and brought away some Cattle.

Leganes on the other side, that he might divert the Enemy from the King of
Spaines Territories, and enforce them to defend their own quarters, marched
into the Territories of Verselles, where he made some excursions, and having
sacked Gatinara upon Sesia, he returned to Novara, making it be given out that
he would besiege Brem; which when Crequi heard, he feared lest for want of
Victuals, and the murmuring of the Soldiers, (who began now to be sensible of
their sufferings) some evil accident might befall him, and not knowing how to
effect his design upon Milan with so few men, he marched toward Verselles,
and from thence to his first quarters of Brem and Montferrat.

The Duke of Savoy's behavior upon this occasion, wherein he showed much
zeal to the interest of France, being balanced with the ill opinion that was
had of him before Valenza, afforded variety of opinions to the curiously
minded; for many wondered, since he did not desire Valenza should be taken,
because he did not approve the French should advance any further, why he
should now upon this occasion, wherein there was a much greater concernment, so
to behave himself, as if the Spaniards had been worsted Milan it self had
been endangered. Diverse were therefore the discourses, and diverse the opinions
hereupon; some said he did it in respect of his Honor* thinking he should
suffer too much therein, if he should recede from his Colleagues in their time
of need; others thought he was persuaded hereunto out of a desire of glory,
that if he had been worsted or put to the rout, he would have been much
blamed for the conduct of his affairs, and on the contrary he should purchase
much glory by the Victory; and that he could not well do less, lest he should
too openly declare himsefe opposite to the intentions of the French. But those
who better understood the reasons of State, by rightly weighing this affair,
found, that as the Duke of Savoy liked not the French should get ^ooting so far
in Italy, by gaining the strong holds of the State of Milan, and increase their
Dominions by having such places to retreat unto; so likewise it did not stand
with his interest that the Spaniards should extend themselves beyond their
bounds, and hereupon it was probably judged, that that Duke intended to keep
the French Army in force and vigor, to counterpoise the Spanish power, and to
preserve the Forts belonging to the Crown of Spain, so to bound the French
designs. And that therefore since it made not for him that the French should
be beaten by the Spaniard, he had really assisted them; and that if the
Spaniards should have been beaten, it had ^ot been hard for him through his
wit and industry to make the Victory be neglected, and so retard the
French-mens further advancement.

The Duke of Parma hearing of these garboiles in the State of Milan, wherein
all the Spanish Forces were employed, and being desirous, though he had not
received that aid promised him from France, to do somewhat, and to make use of
occasion, went from Piacenza, with about 2500 Soldiers, and came before the
Castle of Rotofredo, which was held by the Dutch, and valiantly defending it
self did hold the Duke in play till Don Martin of Aragon having time to
succor it, those of Parma were enforced to retreat with much loss, leaving
what dead, what slain, about 400, after which some fresh Spanish Forces having
past the Poe, and being entered into the State of Placenza, he advanced to
Aragona, took the Castle Campo remoto, which without any opposition yielded,
as likewise did Fiorenzolo, Borgo San Domino, and Monticelli, from whence the
Spaniards got good Contribution. On the other side Cardinal Trivulsio, who was
at Cremona, sent some Musketeers to certain Mills belonging to the Duke of
Parma, guarded by 30 Foot, which after some short defense the Spaniards took,
and brought much grain to Cremona, leaving the place in ashes. Wherereupon the
Duke not dispairing yet, but to be able with the choice Trained Bands of his
own Country, added to the French Garrison which was at Piacenza, to oppose
the invasion of the Spaniards, who came in abundantly in all places to the
prejudice of his State, he gathered together a Body of 4000 Foot and 400
Horse; but afterward finding the timerousnes of those men accustomed to
Mattockes, and not to see naked Swords, and fearing also an insurrection
amongst his subjects, as those who were rather inclined to an accommodation
with the Spaniards, then to follow the Capriccioes of the French, who had
brought them into a world of miseries, he resolved to withdraw himself into
the Citadell of Piacenza, and to send an express messenger from thence to
Count Fabio Scotti, at Paris, wishing him to solicit the King of France to send
unto him the aid he had promised him, and to represent unto his Majesty in what
condition he was, and how prejudicial it would be to the Crown of France, if
he should be by them forsaken, who had ventured his life, fortune, and state
in the service thereof. Leganes going this mean while from the Country of
Novara to Allessandria, to discover those places, and provide for what was
requisite, and not failing in his hostility against the Colleagues, he sent
Don Philip de Silvia with 2000 Foot and 800 Horse to the Astigian Territories,
who overrun much thereof, as also some Villages of Montferrat, and brought
back good booty, spoiling those Towns which joined upon the State of Milan,
whereby since the French could not commodiously lodge there, their inrodes were
the less to be feared, as also the suspicion which was to be had of them, if
they should be quartered so near; and Prince Borso d'Este went with his men
before Montegrosso, wherein was a French Garrison, he valiantly set upon it;
and though it were stoutly defended by the Garrison and Inhabitants, who were
resolute and fierce, they being by Montferrianes brought up in Turmoils and
War, he took it by storm, putting the defendants to the sword; and would have
proceeded further had he not been forced for want of Forage to return to
Allessandria

A recruit of 1000 Horse and 3000 Foot was brought by the Ringrave to the
Cardinal of Vallet and Waymer, as they were before Zaverna, which they had
desired to accomplish that enterprise; for Gallasse being not far off with
the Caesarian Army, they feared le^t he might succor it. Whereupon they
besieged the Town more straightly then ever, and the defendants did
reciprocally show their worth and valor; but at last Victuals growing scarce,
and the attended succor not appearing (for Gallasse, who had found some
distasted companies in the Army, ready to mutiny for want of pay and
Contribution, thought it not fit to move with his Army thitherward, fearing
lest, instead of fighting, his Soldiers might fly over to the French, out of
hopes of being well paid by them, as the French had made it be given out in
the Camp) having sustained six assaults with unheard of gallantry, and seven
weeks siege, they surrendered the Town, upon condition to march forth with
Arms and Baggage, and so retreated to Gallasse. After this, the French
receiving advertisement how the Imperialists were gone toward Dresemhaim, and
that they fortified themselves there; and how also the King of Hungary drew
near, (it being said, he was already come into Wirtenberg to watch over their
proceedings, and so necessitate them for want of Victuals to pass over the
Rhyn) they kept themselves encamped some days about Zaverna, where by reason
of the neighborhood of the Armies, continual skirmishes were had with
reciprocal loss; amongst which I must not past over an encounter between the
Crabats and Swedes, commanded by Colombac, who as he was conveying some
Carriages loaded with Wine to the French Camp, was met by the Crabats, who
skirmished with them; and the Swedes having the better, the Crabats were forced
to retreat with some considerable loss.

The Prince of Conde continued his Siege before Dole; but though the French had
reduced the Town to a bad condition, yet was not fortune so propitious to
them, as to the others before Zaverna; for this being a place of great
importance to the Spaniards, they applied themselves more to the preservation
thereof, and therefore the Colonells, Lamboi, Merci, and Butteler, joined their
Forces together, to whom came also 7000 Burgonians (Trained Bands of that
Country) who took up Arms, as well out of the loyalty they owed their
Prince, as for the hatred they bore the French, though they be of the same
language and customs, which some will have to proceed from a natural ill
disposition which uses to predominate between Confiners, and more particularly
between such as are of the same Nation, but of a sundry Province, and Subjects
to another Prince. These marched thitherward with a Body of about 10000 Foot,
and 2000 Horse. But the Prince of Conde, who saw he had not Forces sufficient
to keep the City besieged, and to hinder the sallyes, which upon this
occasion those within would make, and also to oppose the succor which the
Burgonians brought with much desire and earnestness; He raised his Camp, and
on the 14th of August past over the Sone, being pursued by Merci his Horse,
Aug. 14.
who did somewhat prejudice him in his Rear.

The Imperialists being encouraged by this retreat, and Gallasse not being able
to keep his Army any longer in Alsatia for scarcity of Forage and Victuals
(for that Country was reduced to such a dearth, that a small glass of Wine
cost 6 pence, and a loaf of brown bread a shilling) he passed back over the
Rhyn and came to Brisack, from whence he also passed back over the Rhyn again;
and hoping that by the diversion in Picardy, it was now a fitting time to
attempt somewhat in France on this other side, he marched with his Army
thitherward, where joining with the people of the Country, he began to
over-runne the Towns of Burgony on this side the Sone. He took Merebaulle, a
Castle not far from the River Dain, and went with his Forces to before S.
John de L'aulne, a Town upon the Sone, between Verduue and Chalon. But being
pursued in his march by the Cardinal of Vallet, and Duke Waymer, who at the
news of this (the Imperialists resolution) were come from about Zaverna, and
were already at Ramberville, and Blacemborg, places upon those Frontiers, and
had sent Ransaw, the Serjeant-Major General of the Army, to succor the Town,
who luckily did succor it, Gallasse finding no good to be done, retreated.

This news being brought unto the Court, and it being feared that some
invasion might be made in the Duchy of Burgony, a good and fertile Country,
the Duke of Long^eville was speedily dispatched away to Vallet, with a succor
of 6000 Soldiers, whereby that Province was very well secured from any attempt
of the Enemy; for the Caesarian Forces not being able to keep in those
Territories in any great numbers (as it behoved them to do) for the scarcity
of Victuals in the Country, which was now by the continual maintaining of
Soldiers reduced to great extremity; and the French being therewithal
sufficiently provided, the enterprise would be upon too unequal terms.

Whilst War was waged with much industry on both sides in France, the Swedes
and Saxons proceeded with no less fervor and ingenuitie in Germany. The
Elector of Saxony had his heart set upon the taking of Magdeburg, and fearing
lest if the succor should come up to Bannier, which was upon their march
toward him from Pomerania, Westphalia, Mechelberg, and other places, before
the business were ended, he might fail in his enterprise, he did all that in
him lay to put an end to that Siege. And Bannier not only desirous to
frustrate the Electors hopes, but to have the honor of preserving that City,
labored no less to bring it timely succor, for the which all things
requisite were providing, that upon the arrival of the expected and much
requisite aides, he might quit his Trenches and betake himself to the field.
But the besieged finding their want of bullet, as likewise their scarcity of
Victuals, and being advertised of the loss of Tergemonde, together with
Schulmans rout, who was upon the march to bring them some sort of relief, they
put a period to the great expectation which was had by every one of some great
action near the City; for the Garrison being necessitated for the aforesaid
reasons, resolved to parley, and to surrender up the Town, upon conditions of
marching out with their Arms and Baggage, and 4 pieces of Cannon, their
numbers consisting of 1200 Foot, and 200 Horse, which were conveyed to Werben.
The loss of this place being much regretted by the Swedes, not only for that
it was of so great consideration for their affairs, but also in that it fell
into the Saxons hands who they most perfectly hated, afforded Bannier occasion
of complaint, and to press again the Swedish Governors, that the Forces
which were already assembled in sufficient numbers, might advance into those
parts. But the Elector losing no time, but making use of occasion, put
requisite Garrison into the Town, providing all things necessary for the
maintenance thereof, and sent his Army to before Werben, thinking to fight with
Bannier before he should be strengthened by his expected recruits. Yet things
fell not out as he would have it, for Bannier being a wary and wise Commander,
and knowing it was not yet time to oppose the fury of a Victorious Army with so
few men as he had, which exceeded not 12000. had retired to between Demits and
Lavemburg, having first left a Garrison in Werben, and spoiled all the
neighboring Towns and Villages, to the end the Saxons might not find
wherewithal to subsist in those parts. The Electors Forces set therefore upon
Werben, as a place of some moment for their affairs; which though it were in a
condition of holding out some days, yet the Governor thereof being slain
therein, it yielded at the end of four days, as also did Haselberg; The which
places opening the way to Brandenburg, the Saxons advanced thither, encamped
themselves about the Town, and beset it. Bannier seeing no appearance of the
expected supply, and perceiving that the Saxon Army drew daily nearer him, that
he might shun such incounters from whence he could expect no good, he went
likewise from Demits, and retreated to the Confines of Mechelberg, that he
might there join with Lesley, who being about Luneburg, did diverse things
thereabouts, and with Oranghell, another Swedish General, who was quartered
about Pernaw, to get some Contribution from Berlin, and the Electorate of
Brandenburg, without the which he intended not to move from those quarters. He
grounded his reasons, in that the Soldiers wanting their pay, would run away
if they should part from thence, and but very few would follow him; but his
chief ends aimed at his own particular interest, which was the thing he only
cared for, and so the public service did in this manner decline by reason of
the Commanders avarice. These preparations of the Swedes, and of the Landsgrave
of Hessen, who being recruited with 4000 men, had betaken himself to the
taking in off Statberghen, made the Imperial Commanders look about them, who
were about Ghiessen, upon the banks of Lon, foreseeing that if the Protestant
Forces should increase in those Provinces, and that they should make themselves
Masters of those Towns, they would be hardly recovered. Wherefore they
resolved to march with their Army from those parts to the succor of
Statbergken; they over-ranne the Territories of Hirschfelt, Swartsborne, and
Homburg, belonging to the Country of Hessen, and seated upon the River Fulda,
meeting with no opposition, for all the people were in the Camp before
Statberghen. But the Landsgrave hearing of the Imperialists march, removed from
thence and raised his Siege, retiring to Cassell to defend his own State; and
him the Imperialists would have set upon with some advantage, had not Lesley,
who burnt as many Villages and Towns in Westphalia as denied him Contribution,
necessitated the Marquis Grana to advance to Hanttorph, to have an eye to his
proceedings; and had not Ghets likewise been enforced to depart from that
State, and to go in re-inforcement of the Imperialists that pursued Bannier.

The time appointed for the Diet at Ratisbon was already expired, when his
Imperial Majesty, with all his Court, and the Deputies of those Princes,
parted from Vienna, and stayed some days in Lints, that he might afford time to
the Princes, and others that were bound to be there, to arrive before him. The
Electors of Mentz and Coln, the Deputies of Saxony and Brandenburg, together
with many other chief personages who were to assist in the Diet, being come to
Ratisbon, the Emperor parted from Lints, and made his solemn entry into
Ratisbon, whither the Duke of Bavaria being likewise come, they began the Diet,
wherein three things were chiefly propounded; the first, That his Imperial
Majesty being now very old, and much weakened in body, a King of the Romans
might be chosen; the second, That they should treat of matters touching the
Electorate of Triers; the third, That they should think how to remit the
Empire into its former splendid condition, which if it could not be done, that
the War was to be continued against the perturbers thereof. By these
Propositions, the Electors soon found that the Austrians ends were only to
make the King of Hungary King of the Romans, which when they should have
effected, they would little care for the decision of the other two points. In
so much as some moved, that the other two heads should be resolved on before
they came to choose the King of the Romans, to the end, the Austrians might the
more diligently intend the public quiet; but such difficulties were overcome
by the Spaniards dexterity, who ingratiated themselves into the affections of
the Electors and their Officers; As also, for that the Earl of Arundell, who
was Ambassador from England, for the restitution of the Palatinate* was then
at Ratisbon, who perceiving there was no mention made thereof in the Diet, did
again move the Emperor, that it might be taken into consideration, and that
they might think of what answer they would return to his Kings desires; and
this affair was at last brought to the Table. But it not being then time to
distaste Bavaria, or to raise jealousies in him, the further Treaty thereof
was deferred to the convention which was to be held at Cullen. Of which I have
yet said nothing, because it being procured by the Popes mediation, who as the
common father, was desirous of agreement between the Papists Princes; and it
never being effected, although the Plenipotentiaryes of all the Potentates were
named, and I not esteeming it yet so easy to be effected, by reason of the
small desire that Princes have to part with what they have once gotten, I
reserve my self to speak thereof when the effects thereof shall be seen, and
that the Officers of those Princes who are to compose it, shall be brought
together. The Ambassador being not well satisfied, and clearly foreseeing
that the Palatinate was never to be regained but by the same means by which it
was lost, resolved to take his leave, and return unto his King.

All the Gentry and Commonaltie of France was at this time in Arms, and people
came from all parts to the Court; when the King knowing he had Forces enough in
readiness for his purpose, having mustered his Army at S. Denis, which
consisted of 18000 Foot, and 3000 Horse, besides Volunteers, and the Nobility
of Normandy, which were to come with him, and having declared his Brother the
Duke of Orleans to be the General of his Forces, made all the Army march under
his Highness conduct toward Picardy, to recover the places that were lost,
and to drive the Spaniards thence. Who hearing of these great preparations
which were made throughout all France, and fearing what they might do, had
fired the Country all about. 'Twas said, they did this to incommodiate the
French in Forage and Victuals, and to streighten them so as they might not be
able to keep long in the Field. Piccolomini, together with Were, retired to
Noyon, the rest of the Spanish Army entrenched themselves about Corbie, the
preservation whereof was much endeavored by the Austrians, for this Town was
so situated, as that by any reasonable Garrison therein, part of France might
be kept in continual jealousies.

The Duke of Orleans being advanced unto the Frontiers, made his first attempt
against Roye, a Town between Noion and Corbie; against which, having planted
his Cannon, and the defendants having endured some assaults, they compounded,
knowing themselves not able there to resist a Royal Army; and the Spaniards
and Dutch, finding that their longer stay in those Confines would be but a
loss of time and men, whereof they daily lost many in skirmishes, and as they
went to fetch Forage, they drew toward Cambrai, leaving about 3000 Foot and
300 Horse in Corbie. But the French having taken Roye, did lose no time, but
furiously beset Corbie; and after having played upon it many days with their
Cannon, they assaulted it with a battalion of Volunteers, who with their Pikes
and Muskets, desirous to have the honor of making the first assault (as in
such cases is usual with those of that Nation) stormed all the Trenches and
Fortifications that were about it; so as those within the Town, being set on on
all sides, and played upon by 36 piece of Cannon, which without intermission,
day and night battered their Rampires, and beat down their houses, though with
much undauntednesse they tended their defense, yet were they in great danger of
losing the Town; the loss whereof much grieving the Spaniards, they caused
Piccolomini and Were, to come from Chapelle (whether they were gone from Noyon)
and to furnish Cambrai with all things necessary, with intention to make the
French rise from before Corbie by their setting upon Dorlens, a place of no
less importance, seated in the Frontier of Artois, between Amiens and Arras;
they therefore sat down before it, and began to thunder upon it with their
Cannon; but this their enterprise lasted not long, for the King of France being
come himself in Person to Amiens, where he was gladsomely received, and the
Count Soisons going from thence with a good strength of men into Artoise, and
Corbie being in great streights, they were enforced to quit Dorlens, and to
bethink themselves how they might best relieve Corbie; but having sent some
Spies into the French Camp, that they might be informed in what state the
French Army was, and these being discovered and punished, they saw their
design was vain, and so forwent it. Whereupon the besieged seeing their
succor vanished, and that the French did every day increase in their offending
them, Nov. 18.
they capitulated on the 18th of November and surrendered the Fort to the
French; who with great content, and with the universal applause of Monsieur
the Kings Brother, entered the Town. At which it was said, the King was not
well pleased; and that therefore withdrawing him from so great an Authority, he
became more wary in conferring employments in the Army upon him; for it is not
good to make those Princes Commanders of the Militia, who are near in
succession to the Crown, since by winning the Soldiers love, they prove
oft-times harmfull. The Spaniards on the contrary side, had assembled together
an Army of about 10000 Foot and 1500 Horse in Novara, under the command of the
Admiral of Castile, intending to invade France therewithal; where if they
should find no insurrection amongst the people, as they hoped, by reason of
the natural inquietude of that Nation, to do, the undertaking was
notwithstanding advantageous, that thereby they might divert the French Forces
from their hostility against the States of Austria. They therefore entered into
the nether Novara, took Saint John de Lus, and besieged Bayon, making many
incursions into the King of France his Dominions; wherefore many Companies of
Foot and Horse were forthwith dispatched away thitherward to reinforce Count
Gramont the Governor of Bear, who already with those Forces he had, opposed
them.

Whilst the Spaniards grew every day stronger in the State of Milan, by people
who continually landed in the Port of Vado from Napells, and by the Dutch who
came down by Helvetia, and who forbear not their hostility with the Duke of
Parma, The French who kept themselves quiet, not doing any thing, afforded
matter of thought not only to the Spaniards but to all Italy, every one being
desirous to see what the issue would be of the succor which was though
requisite for the State of Parma; and so much the rather for that a great fleet
of theirs being put to Sea from Marseilles, with a great many of Foot therein
for Land-service, was now in the Genuan Seas. Some said the reason hereof was
their want of Forces, others that they expected what the effect of the fleet at
Sea would be, and waited to see the men landed that were therein brought;
which report did much comfort those of Parma, who were brought into great
streights, and which were so much the greater by how much the less will they
had to War, and only hoped in succor from France, it being reported that
the fleet came to this purpose: for there was no appearance that the Country of
Piacenza should be succored by Crequies Soldiers; were it either for that
they wanted their pay, or for that their numbers were lessened, or out of their
no desire to remove from their quarters wherein they kept, complaning rather of
their ill-entertainment in Italy, then that they were not employed in the State
of Milan, as they were by their Commanders fed with hopes they should be,
before they came out of France, that so they might the easier bring them on
this side the Mountains.

Leganes this mean while being come from about Pavia to Tortona, and having
reviewed the neighboring Towns and places in Allessandria, and provided for
such passages as might be put for by those Forces which were in the fleet,
which was said intended to land its Soldiers in the Haven of Specie, that from
thence they might be transported into the State of Parma, returned into the
Piacenzan Territories, to attend the business of Piacenza, and secure himself
in such sort thereabouts, that in case the succor should come (which yet was
known by the best understanding people to be impossible) they should not be
able to force him. And having by the assistance of good Engineers considered
that Longina, a Town in the Piacenzan Territories near the Poe, was the
fittest place of all others for the Spaniards to keep the command of the River,
and streighten Piacenza, he went thither, and gave order for the fortifying
thereof, wherein many Pioneers were employed; and then resolving to quarter his
people in the Country of Piacenza that Winter, that so he might ease the
State of Milan, he made Signior John Cavalchino Commissary general of the
Spanish Forces in the Country of Piacenza, and commanded him to forbid upon
pain of death that any Soldier should transport Cattle, or any sort of
Victuals from those Towns, to the end there might be sufficient to maintain
the Army there. He brought his Forces before Ca^rso, which having given fire
to some pieces of Cannon, rather for the honor of the Soldier then that the
Town was in a condition to defend it self, the Town yielded; by the taking
hearof the Spaniards did so streighten Piacenza, as there was no hope left of
its being succored unless by a complete Army; for besides this place where
they took up a quarter, they put Garrisons into Saint Domno, Monticelli,
Bussetto, Firenzvola, Corte Maggiore, and into other adjacent Towns: by reason
whereof the French who were imploid in the defense of Piacenza, and wherein
they began to suffer much (for the Spaniards had taken from them the water of
Trebbia) began to fly to Cremona, where being allured by a crown in Money, and
a Pasport which Cardinal Trivulsio gave to every one of them, many followed
their examples. Other fitting orders being given, Leganes returned to Pavia, to
reform some Companies which were much lessened; casheering the Commanders and
reducing the Soldiers under other Colors.

Thus the Spaniards continued their hostilities against Piacenza, though
Signior Dominico Pandolfini, who was resident at Milan from the great Duke, and
the great Dukes Kinsman, endeavored an agreement between the Spaniards and it.
And that moreover Count Ambrogio di Carpegna was come thither by Commission
from the Pope, to persuade the Duke thereof to give way to the said
composition. Yet as it is usual not to desist from injuries once done, for
whatsoever interposition, but rather to renew them with the greater vigor, that
so we may have what we desire at our own rates, the Spaniards casting their
eye upon a little Island in the midst of the Poe, not far from Piacenza, and
not much above Musket shot from certain Mils which furnish the City with
grist, and being advertised that those of Parma intended to send some thither
the next day, so to entrench themselves the better, and secure the said Mils
against the which the Cannon on the other side the Poe could do no good, they
on the 20th of December imbarqued themselves by night at Pizzighettione, and
coming to the said Island, made themselves Masters of it; here planting their
Cannon in the same boats that had brought them thither, against a Bridge which
those of Parma had thrown over a branch of the Poe, they afterward turned
them upon the Mils, and did so fortify themselves, as that they could not be
offended, neither by Cannon from Piacenza, nor yet from the little Fort which
was raised upon the banks of Poe, for the defense of those Mils. Colonel
Gilidas likewise came with his Dutchmen before Rivalta, a strong Town seated
upon the Trebbia, eight miles distant from Piacenza, and bebegan to play upon
it with his Cannon so furiously, as being no less desirous to have the honor
of taking it then the defendants were to maintain it, and keep it from him,
cruel were the outrages which were offered to the besieged, who did desperately
defend themselves. So as the Duke seeing himself straightened on all sides, and
hearing no tidings of any relief, he resolved to send an express to Count
Scotti at Paris, openly protesting that if he were not succored, he would
yield to propositions of agreement with the Spaniard.

The Grisons in Rhetia did now bethink themselves how they might take
possession of the Vateline; Rohan endeavored to satisfy them, and by his
wisdom to lessen their anger. The Swedes increased in numbers every where,
and provided for all things necessary that they might oppose the Saxons, who
were too far advanced. Nothing but War was noysed in France: The chief
French Commanders in Piemont, and Montferrat, having their numbers much
decreased by the death and flight of their Soldiers were much sadded, for not
being able to effect that which their sprightly minds carried them unto. The
Cardinal of Vallet, Waymer, and Gallasse, having by reason of the ridgednesse
of the season betane themselves to their winter quarters, did nothing of
moment. The Infanta was busied in Flanders, in recruting his Army, and in
providing all things necessary for that Province. The Spaniards in the State of
Milan increasing continually in their hopes, expected an agreement with Parma,
and built strange imaginations upon the Grisons breaking with the French, which
they underhand fomented. All the rest of Europ stood attentively expecting what
the issue would be of the German, French, and Spanish Forces. When at last the
Spanish Ministers of State prevailing by their dexterity, as also the Austrian
faction, over all the French could do to the contrary, and such as sided with
them, The King of Hungary was on the 22th of December chose King of the Romans
at Ratisbon; Dec. 22.
for which great demonstrations of joy was made throughout all Austria, and
greatly contented were all the Austrians, that they had brought their
so-much-desired ends into so safe a Haven, from out of the troublesome Waters
of Calamity, whereinto they were plunged; well-foreseeing that the Rainbow of
these prosperous successes foretold fai^e weather to the almost-sunke Empire;
or that fortune being sorry she had forsaken the party by which she had always
been well treated, seemed willing to return again. In Germany their joy was
signified by their feastings, and redoubled healths to all the Princes of
Austria, whereby they showed they put a greater valuation upon their Princes
glory, and their fidelity to their Prince, then upon their own healths;
drinking oft-times more then their stomach could bear. In Flanders and in
Spain they extrincicated their contentments, according to the several
customs of the Countries, by Bonefires, Tilting, Tourney, Shoutes, Feasts, and
Daunces. In brief, there was not any one in all the States of Austria who did
not witness his joy of this Election, by countenance, voice, and behavior in
France; on the contrary this news was unwelcome, and incontinently they
declared the Electito, be void and invalide; alleging it was prosecuted by
violence, and that the Electors were not suffered to use that freedom which is
requisite to their function; and with other reasons they pronounced it to be
Null, providing every where all things requisite to continue the War they had
begun.

THe good news of the King of the Romans Creation, 1637.
being speedily brought to Milan, as it was cause of extraordinary contentment
in the King of Spaines Ministers of State, in the Commanders, Soldiers, and
all the people, who by all sorts of apparent Iubilies, witnessed by their
Feasts, Justings, Ridings, and other extraordinary signs of joy (no less then
had been observed in other places, and as has been said) the honor and
satisfaction that they received thereby, so was it interpreted as an happy
augure of the ensuing year, and pronounced as a favorable presage of good
fortune to the Forces of his most Catholic Majesty, and it was not long ere
the effects proved it to be so: For the great Duke of Tuscany, wisely
foreseeing the Duke of Parma's ruin if he should continue his union with
France, from whence succor would prove desperate, as well by reason of the
far distance thereof, and their want of men, as also of the causes which made
for the interests of the French, whom it became not, though they had had a
greater strength of men, to employ them in a wasted Country, in the midst of
their Enemies, without money or requisite Provisions for War, the issue
whereof would have been, that the greater part of their Soldiers naturally
impatient of suffering, and desirous of chance, would have run away into the
State of Mantua, the Churches dominions, and into the State of Venice, and thus
weaken the Ensigns of France, and bring them to hard bargain; And his
Highness seeing the Spaniards continued with great gallantry to strengthen
Piacenza, which could not hold out much longer without relief, and being lost,
would not so easily be redeemed, especially the Citadell, to keep the which,
the Spaniards would not want valide reasons and fair pretenses; The great Duke
being likewise not pleased, that his Kinsman should be bereaved of his
patrimony, nor yet that the Spaniard should enlarge his dominions in Italy, he
sent more strict Commission to Pandolphini, that he should go again to
Piacenza, and make the Duke see how palpable the danger was that over-hung him,
and exhort him to make an accommodation with the Spaniards, with whom if Parma
would give him leave, he (the great Duke) would Treat, and make an agreement
which should be to his advantage. The Pope likewise, who was troubled that that
City should be lost for that it held of the Church, ordered Count Carpegna to
acquaint the Duke how his Holiness, not intending that the fee-Farme-Lands of
the Church should be further ruinated, wished him to think of compounding the
business; he likewise commanded Carpegna, to show the Duke how little hopes
there was succor, and of the performance of the Frenchmens promise, as he
might daily see by the effects; for though they promised to do wonders, so to
keep him in league, yet their actions did in no ways correspond with their
words. They at last made him comply with the counsel given him by the Pope and
the great Duke, whereupon after many negotiations, in the beginning of February
the business was adjusted, wherein the Duke of Parma was much obliged to the
great Duke, who upon this occasion showed himself to be his very good Friend
and Kinsman. The French were brought out of the Town under pretense of being
mustered, the Duke unexpectedly began to complain to Monsieur De S. Paul of
the negligence of his Kings Officers in sending him his due and promised
succor, and to show him how faithfully he had behaved himself in the behalf
of France, which being done, he dismissed all the French out of Piacenza, as also
out of Parma, and all other parts of his dominions, and sent them to their own
homes, at which they very much repined, thinking themselves to be abused,
though the Duke had always behaved himself ingenuously, and done all that by
his new friendship he was bound to do; for it is always lawful for Princes
to change their Copy when their States are at the stake. All the Princes of
Italy were greatly pleased with this accommodation; for by such ruptures great
troubles were likely to have risen in Italy; and now the Forces withdrawing
themselves toward Piemont, the other Provinces were at quiet, and their peace
was the more firmly established by the weakening of the two Crowns; it being
the opinion of wisemen, that other Potentates ought to endeavor the keeping of
these two great Kings at odds, with equality of success, to the end, that
being intent to War within themselves, they may not fall to prejudice less
powerful Princes. The Spaniards notwithstanding, who proceed leisurely, and
wait patiently for occasions, which being by them opportunely laid hold on,
brings them usually no little advantage, did inwardly like well enough of this
accommodation; for here their jealousies being buried by the laying down of
Arms, and consequently by their disbanding, their companies increasing, and
their confining neighbors growing weaker by the want of those Soldiers, they
with much contentment foresaw, that if Fortune should favor them against the
French, they should be able to enlarge the limits of the State of Milan, and to
secure themselves from Foreign invasion; for unarmed Princes, not being able
on the sudden to poise up the balance which panched a little downwards in the
declination of the French party, they were confident to bring their desired
intents into a safe Haven.

The accommodation with Parma being had, and the French being all gone out of
that State (disposing of themselves, some one way, some another) the Spaniards
presently quit their quarters in that State, slighted their Fortifications, and
all that belonged unto the Duke of Parma returned into its former condition. So
as not having now any the least color to keep their Forces on this side
diverted, they resolved to proceed on against the French withal their might.
And because the French, by the Fort and Garrison of Brem, kept the Territories
of Lomillina in continual Contribution, which is a gallant part of the State
of Milan, and which for its fertility is termed the Granary of Milan, lying
toward Piemont, Pavia, and Montesferrat, between the Sesia, Tesine, and the
Poe, and the Spaniards coveting the said Fort above all other parts, as that
which flank't upon them, and lay in the most important part of their Frontiers,
as well in regard of invasion, (there being none else but Mortara which
protects Milan) as for the safety of Montferrat; for it was probable by reason
of War, the Spaniards could never come before Cassale if they had not first
rid themselves of this; a good strength of men advanced therefore beyond Goyna,
and Leganes commanded that some already begun works about Lumello should be
perfected, whereby Lumello might be secured from danger. By which means, the
excursions of the Garrison of Brem should not only be stopped, but the State of
Milan being thereby more secured on that side, they could not but upon good
occasion hope to make use thereof for their more easy taking Brem; the
Country people of those parts were therefore trained, and imposed to perfect
the defense thereof.

Crequi was much confused when he heard of the D. of Parma's acco^modation, and
seemed to be the more grieved thereat, for that it had happened to the great
advantage of the interest of the French Forces, as likewise to the prejudice of
his own honor, for those that were no way concerned in the business
exclaimed against him for not being willing, or else not able to succor Parma
as was by all men expected he should, and according as the many promises made
unto the Duke required. He therefore went forthwith to Turin, and sent news
hereof to France, desiring more men and further orders; and he himself soon
after, seeing his bad success in Italy, and that his Soldiers by their
continual sufferings were reduced to such a condition, as to the shame of the
French Chiefetaines, they were seen in tattered rags, and worse looks to beg
in Churches and in the streets, resolved to pass over the Mountains, and in
his own person acquaint the King with the condition of Piemont, as also to
desire leave he might return home: The which notwithstanding he could not
obtain; for his Majesty putting a great esteem upon so famous a Soldier,
and one who had always given extraordinary proofs of himself, would not for
one turn of Fortune forgo the hopes which he had in the worth and valor of
his good servants. This news being notwithstanding not well liked of at Court,
Count Scotti, who was sent by the Duke of Parma to solicit the expedition of
succor in his behalf, was committed prisoner, and the Kings Ministers did
more carefully apply themselves to the consideration of these affairs. Some
were of opinion, that Crequi should be dismissed and employed elsewhere, as one
that had had but ill success in those parts, and the Duke of Rohan was
propounded by some to succeed him, he being one, who grown white in the
experience of Wars, had so wisely demeaned himself, as his worth and valor
caused wonder in many. But this opinion, though peradventure one of the best,
was not followed; For Rohan, by reason of the past convulsions of that Kingdom,
by his diversity of Religion, and peradventure through inconstancy of opinion,
not having such credit or such supporters in Court as others, who had long
before insinuated into the favor of the King and his Ministers of state, had
not the fortune to have that employment, which certainly would have yet raised
him to a higher pitch of glory. For he, though a Frenchman, being no less
cautious in his proceedings then the Spaniards, subtle in the conduct of
affairs, diligent in the prevention of mischief, assiduous, and careful for
matter of provisions, and that which of all other things is most remarkable in
a perfect Commander, having nothing of selfe-interest in him, but above measure
generous, and no way sensual or lasciviously given, excellent events must
needs have been expected from his behavior. But that France might not appear
to be so poor in men of worth, as a Duke of Rohan should only enjoy the
precedence before all others: Or were it for that, it was not expedient to
remove him from the Grisons, amongst whom he had won great reputation, as
being of the same Religion, all further thought of him concerning this affair
ceased.

But if the Spaniards prospered in Lombardy, they did not so in Burgundy, for
Gallasse faring ill in his proceedings in that Province, and being forced to
raise the siege which he had laid before Saint John de Losne, by reason of the
succor which was sent to the Cardinal of Vallette, and Duke Waymer, under the
command of Duke Longveille; and it being a difficult matter for him to
maintain himself any longer with so many people, in a Country which was
impoverished by the daily quartering of Soldiers, it behoved him to forgo his
former resolutions, and to return to Alsatia; where not being able (neither)
to stay for want of Victuals, he past on into the Country of Wirtemberg; and
having quartered his Army in the Towns thereabouts, he himself went to
Ratisbon to the Emperor, that he might be present at their Counsels of
War, and receive such Commission as he was to observe in the future. When
Waymer with his Army leaving their quarters in Alsatia, marched speedily into
the Country of Burgundy; and having broken a convoy which was conducted by
Lamboi, and taken Ianville, together with the death of 150 Burgonians, he made
the Imperialists dislodge, who under the command of Merci were returned to the
Siege of Montebelgarde. He then with his Forces which were about 8000 Foot and
3000 Horse, left the Cardinal of Vallette, and unexpectedly fell into the
upper Alsatia; and passing over the Rhyn at Basil, he took Lausfemburg,
Valdsbut, and Sickinghem, places of small defense, and betook himself to the
taking of Rhinfield, which in a few days yielded unto him, whereat the Papists
Swissers were much offended, who thought that in regard of the ancient
alliance, which the Helveticke body or corporation holds with the house of
Austria, and for all other respect, the Austrians should not have suffered
stranger Princes to have approached their Towns, and more particularly not
Waymer, who fighting under the pay of France, it was no reason that the Forces
of that great King should so dilate themselves, and flank upon Swisserland.

Bannier being retired into Meckelberg, and having at this time received
Lesleyes succor of above 8000 men, and 4000 more being come to him from
Swethland and Pomerania, and being likewise joined with Oranghell, he knew
himself now strong enough not only to make defense, but to encounter the
Saxons, and the Emperors Army in the field; he therefore begun to march, and
was seen not far from the Towns of Saxony. Which news when the Elector and
Azfelt heard, they presently sent forth their Army against the Swedes, who came
boldly forwards; a great skirmish happened between the Horse of both parties,
wherein whilst the Saxons were attentive, and were ready to succor their
Companions, the Swedes secretly faining to retire themselves into a Wood, came
behind them, and unexpectedly set upon their Rear, routing, and putting to
flight three Saxon Regiments which guarded the Baggage, which they made
themselves Masters of, and worsted the Saxons. But they taking heart again,
and coping with the Swedish squadrons, the business grew so hot, as it was now
no longer doubted, but that it would turn to a general Battle; at last the
Swedes prevailed, and the Saxons knowing their disadvantage, kept within some
intrencht places, and bravely defending themselves retreated to their quarters,
though they lost in this conflict about 2000 Soldiers, and 400 Carriages;
Bannier encouraged by this Victory, advanced with the body of his Army, that he
might follow the Saxons who were got to Verben, but he had not the fortune to
come up unto them; for they diligently continuing their retreat, were already
come near Leipsicke, and into the strong places of Saxony; where they staid to
refresh their men, who were wearied with their sufferings before Magdeburg, and
in this other action, wherein they had suffered much for want of Victuals; as
also to expect the succor which Ghets and Glessing (two Imperial Captains)
were bringing to them, and which was already come near to Erfurt. Bannier
encouraged by his good success, and by his daily increase of men, marched
forward to Helmstet, and then to Elghen, Towns not far from Magdeburg, not
meeting with any to withstand him; for Azfelt who had formerly retreated into
those parts, knowing himself to be much inferior to the Swedes, had got for
his safety into the so famous Herecinian Woods, which inviron all Bohemia. The
Duke of Saxony at the news of this misfortune well-weighing that it was
requisite to bring speedy and fitting remedies, whereby to withstand the
incursions which the Swedes might make, brought his Militia to Marsburg upon
the Sale, encamped himself with his own men, and the Emperors Forces about
Halla, having first put good Garrisons into Verben, Magdeburg, Witemburg, and
Torgaw. But Bannier not valuing these the Saxons preparations marched forward
as far as to Mansfielt, planted his Cannon against it, and forced it to
surrender; as Glisleben did likewise afterward, another Town in those parts*
and to the no small fear of those people, he came to within two Leagues of
Erfurt.

Such were the proceedings of the Dutch Armies, and such were the conditions of
the Swedes, when the Diet at Ratisbon being broken up, and his Caesarian
Majesty after some days spent there in the consultation of affairs of State
and War, returning somewhat ill to Vienna, at last, when it was hoped he was
upon the mending hand, was seized on by a great cold, which occasioned in him a
violent Fever, whereupon being now 59 years old, and much weak in body, he
soon after upon the 14 of February dyed, Feb. 14.
to the great coffeehouse not only of all the Princes and people of
Germany, but also of many strangers. For truly he was one of the most religious
Emperors that ever was in Christendom, and so much interessed for the
preservation of the Roman Catholic Faith, as that for having always
preferred Religion, and divine Worship, before his own interest of State, he
instead of peace, had the continual vexations of War; wherein increasing in
glory (the King of Swethland not being yet entered Germany, nor Walesteine being
discharged from his place of General) all Germany appeared to reverence, and
bow unto him, which none of his predecessors had obtained, though many of them
had endeavored it. He was a Prince of a sanguine, and manlike complexion, of
a middle stature, and Majesticall aspect; his exercises were Hunting, and
Music; the one for the exercise of his body, and the delight he took therein,
the other for the glory of God, and to solace his spirit, bent upon the
interest of the Empire; in these he spent the idle hours of his Reign, and
much Money. Who beheld him could not choose but love him, and whosoever heard him
speak must confess he was beholding to him; his presence was affable, his
look mild, his voice pleasing, his gesture grave and comely, attracting the
good will of lookers on in all his actions. He lived 18 years a crowned
Emperor, in which time he constantly maintained six Wars, in five of which
he was victorious; to wit, against Bethlem Gabor, Prince of Transylvania;
against the Prince Elector Palatine, and those that sided with him in Bohemia;
against Mansfelt, the chief leader of a League of four Kings; against
Brunswick, and the King of Denmark; against the D. of Mantua, and at last
against the King of Swethland; in which War, if in the Battle of Leipsick,
and in other incounters, his Armies had the worst, it was easily seen, that the
blame and injustice of the War of Mantua, whereunto he was persuaded by the
selfe-interest of his Ministers of State, could not escape unpunished, and
unrevenged before the Tribunal of Justice; nor the extortions used by his
Soldiers in Lombardy, and left unpunished; which proves that such as were
merciless, and blown up with confidence and ambition, would have Idolatrised
in the triumphs of their own glory. Some affirm, that as in his former
successes and victories, no whit at all varying from his accustomed and
natural modesty, he devoutly paid his acknowledgements to God Almighty by
thanksgiving, that he no less in these his adversities and last misfortunes,
did praise and glorify him, whereby he won unto himself deserved credit.
He had wont to say to those that brought him any ill tidings, it is good, it is
Gods pleasure, I (...) contented. He termed those unhappy who dyed happy, and
those fortunate who died without fortune. In his Court, charity, devotion, and
piety did flourish. He was glorious in pardoning, nor did he ever more freely
pardon, then when the offenders hoped least therein; his endeavors were to
have fair repute, not to be magnified or cried up. Neither did he desire by
his victories so much to enlarge his Dominions, as to increase his power of
showing mercy.

None of his predecessors did ever exceed him in generosity of mind, in
extending favors, in the well accepting of actions, and in sincerity of good
will. His rewarding services received, his magnanimity of honoring such as
deserved well, and his demonstration of affection to his faithful servants,
were so many Trumpets to invite unto his service even those that lived most
remote from him. Ferdinand was so very good and requisite in the government, as
that his people they wonderfully loved him, out of mere gratitude. His
government was without contempt, his greatness without excess, his glory void
of ambition; he bestowed what was gotten by his Armies, in adding greater
splendour and glory to the worship of the Church, in rewarding such as deserved
well, and in the relieving of his vassals. His Conscience could not tolerate
the unseemlinesse of Heresy; he detested ingratitude; and his natural
magnificency liked nor the vulgarity of custom. In brief good men lamented
his death, the Soldier bewailed ^is loss, the Churchmen were afflicted at
this misfortune, and the people thought that by his departing the Heavens lost
their serenity, and the Earth its fruitfulness. He left two Sons, Ferdinand
King of the Romans, Leopald Archduke of Austria, and two Daughters, Anna
Maria, married to Maximilian Duke of Bavaria; and Cicely, married to Vladislaus
King of Poland.

The Duke of Rohan kept still in the Valteline, greatly desiring orders from
his Majesty of France, to leave those Mountains, and so attempt somewhat of
new upon the State of Milan, wherein he ^oped to do some good service, if the
King would give him leave to march with his Forces into those parts; for having
with him a good strength of old and experienced Foot, and excellent Horse, he
feared not that his Enemies, though more in number then he, and who dreaded
his name, could do any thing to the prejudice of his wariness, or his
Souldies valor. But it was feared in the Court of France that if Rohan should
leave the Valteline, the Grisons who seemed already weary of the French-mens
company, (whose friendship they found to be nothing else but a subjection,
since that valley which was first taken from them by the Spaniards was now held
by the French) might easily drive them out, and attempt somewhat of new upon
those that should remain there; it was not therefore intended that he should
depart from thence. Others notwithstanding who had an inckling of the Grisons
intentions, and knowing likewise how disadvantagious it would be for the Forces
of France, if they should lose those Countries, and the friendship of those
people, who had already sufficient ad^^^tages in Italy; and considering that
the Grisons could upon the sounding of a bell assemble together 16000 armed
Foot, stout men, and well experienced, and jealous of their liberty, so as they
might easily have forced the French to give them satisfaction, or have driven
them out of their Country, by which means the Spaniards would become the
stronger in the State of Milan; They therefore by forceable arguments advised
that the Grisons might have good words given them, that their anger might be
allaid by Money, and that by departure they might be freed of the conceit that
his Majesty intended any thing else save their liberty; and that affording Money
for the maintenance of Garrisons of their own Nation, and of Swissers, in such
Forts and places as were convenient, they might consequently be maintained in
their liberty, and good correspondency might be held with them; and by giving
that which they could not keep, they should keep them from joining with the
Spaniards, and Rohan entering into the State of Milan with his men, and Duke
Crequi doing the like on the other side, they might bring their business to good
effect. And when they should prosper in their designs of taking Milan from the
Spaniard, they might the more freely afterward throw off their counterfeit
Mask, with the which wisemen upon occasion ought to cover their actions. But
as the felicity of Princes does by hopes and confidence puzle the foresight
of the wisely advised, these reasons were over-borne by other reasons. For
those who were of a contrary opinion, and who did not believe that Rohan ought
to be sent thither, as one who was acceptable to the Nation; nor that those
ought not to be trusted, who pretending to govern themselves only according
to their own interest, would as willingly have applied their mind to the
Spanish Pistolls, as to the French Crowns. And they further added, That it
being hoped that the State of Venice would at last declare themselves for their
King, it would be a most considerable point to perfect the enterprise of the
State of Milan. That the Grisons would never dare to undertake so dangerous a
business against Rohan, not only a wel-wisher of theirs, but (which imports
much) in great esteem, and much feared by every one, having the strong holds in
his possession, and upon such an occasion likely to be assisted by the
Venetians, who had many Soldiers upon those Confines. And it was thought they
would not suffer the French to be driven from thence, because if the Spaniards
should get footing there, they should be debarred those passages, and the
Spaniards would grow the greater. But thoughts which are built upon bare
opinion, and raised only upon hopes, not being established upon the interest
of others, were of no validity; for the Grison Captains and Colonells laying
claim to much money, and others who were destined to have the government,
claiming the restitution of the Valteline according to promise, they mutined,
and betaking themselves to Arms throughout all Rhetia, they secured the Duke
of Rohan in the Fort of Maynfelt, and behaved themselves so, as the French to
escape being buried in those Valleys, were enforced to forsake them, and to
return to their own Kings Dominions; and thus was this Valley freed in the
month of March, and the Grisons Garrisons entered thereinto, and recovered
their liberty, which was not in their power to do whilst it leaned upon the
protection of France.

All fears and jealousies caused in the Spaniards by the Arms of France,
under the command of Rohan, seemed to cease; and Rohan not being able to escape
from Coira, whither he was brought from Maynfelt as an hostage, there to
remain until such time as his men were gone out of Rhetia, to his great
grief failed in a design he had by intelligence with a great friend of his,
one Colonel Smith of Zurick, who was then keeper of the said Castle in the
behalf of the Switzers, with whom he had secretly wrought, that the said Fort
should be kept for the French party, by which means he might easily again
re-enter into Rhetia, and revenge himself for the injuries he had received, by
means of Waymers Army, which was not far from the Grisons, though the Fort
were in the Grisons power, and the French already past over the Rhyn. The
passage of the Valteline being thus freed, by which way the Dutch might with
most ease pass to the succor of the State of Milan, which till then the
French had gaine-said; The Spainsh Forces were dis-ingaged which were kept
there to wait upon the French, and might to their great advantage be sent
toward Piemont. The consequences which were concerned in the intelligence,
held between the Duke of Parma and the French, being vanished by his late
peace made with Spain, that diversion being taken away, which occasioned the
keeping of a great part of the Spanish Army on that side, and the succession of
the Empire being provided for in the person of the Son of the late Ferdinand,
by the Election of the King of the Romans, no greater contentment could in
these present emergencies befall the Austrians, nor was it possible for them to
become more famous, then by having overcome three such difficulties which had
not a little troubled them.

These successes did therefore so exalt the Austrians hopes, as they thought it
not only an easy matter to drive the French to the other side of the
Mountains, and to secure Flanders, but also to beat back the Swedes beyond the
Baltique Sea. And to effect these vast designs, Piccolomini and Were were sent
for back into Flanders, the one or them General to the Emperor, the other to
Bavaria, who a little before were come from the Low Countries for the affairs
of the Empire to their Masters Dominions, so to guard those Provinces the
better from being invaded by the French, as likewise, if Fortune should prove
propitious, to undertake somewhat in France, and to get some of the Forts of
Lorayne, which the Spaniards could not endure should be in the power of the
French: For besides that, France was thereby increased by the addition of a
good Dukedom, lying between Burgundy and Flanders, those Provinces were
consequently much weakened by that division. They therefore sent Foot and Horse
by the way of Navarre against France, to reinforce the Siege before Bayon,
intending, if not to proceed further, at least to divert the Army of France
from that side.

After the fight and rout given to Azfelt, Bannier advanced cheerfully toward
Turingia, where he had already taken Mansfelt and Erfurt, and other places of
those Provinces; wherefore Ghets and Glissing, who were then with about 10000
men in France, were commanded when the Forces should be gotten together which
were in the Hercinian Woods, to join themselves with the Saxons Army (which
after the taking of Magdeburg, was about Marsburg and Halla, to refresh it
self for the sufferings it had endured before that Town) and to oppose the
Enemies proceedings. And because Orenghell also over-runne Slesia with a great
strength of Swedes, to the great prejudice of those people, the Caesarian
Commanders, who had the charge of guarding that Province, were commanded to
take what men they could from the neighboring Garrisons, and join with other
Soldiers who were already on their way from Moravia, and with all diligence to
oppose Orenghells furthers proceedings: So as the Austrians thought they had
done reason on this side, by the assistance of the Forces of the Electors of
Saxony and Brandemburg, and of those other people which they had sent to those
parts, the rather to keep those Electors in their loyalty, then totally to
drive the Swedes from such places of theirs as they were possessed of: By reason
whereof, some more speculative then others, gave out, that the Austrians
intentions were grounded upon a strong reason of state, to keep the War
still on foot in this part, for that the mischiefs thereof being nourished in
the State of Saxony, the Duke whereof was a Protestant Prince, and at the
present, one of the powerfullest of all the Empire, his Country having
preserved it self better then any other from the miseries of War, by which
all other places had been greatly wasted, it was likely his strength might be
weakened; and that afterward the business of Italy and France being
compounded, the Emperor might easily bring all Germany to his obedience; the
Princes whereof, by reason of their past-sufferings, would not be able to weigh
against the Austrian power; and as it is usual for the weakest to tolerate
more the actions of great ones, so it would behove them to respect Caesar's
authority more then formerly; And the Spaniards chief aim being to preserve
Alsatia and Flanders, and to drive the French from Montferrat, having thus
provided for the urgencies of Germany, they set themselves wholly upon the
getting of Piemont. Those people therefore being drawn out, who after the
retreat from Piacenza, were quartered in the Territories of Pavia and
Lodiggian, and a new inforcement of some Companies which came from Spain and
Naples, being come to the State of Milan, Leganes resolved, when he should have
perfected the Fortifications spoken of about Lumello, a Bridge should be
thrown over the Tessine at Sesto, a Town near the greater Lake, that he
might make use thereof, in the more speedy leading of the Switzers and Dutch,
which were expected from Switzerland and Swabenland, into the Territories of
Vercelles, at any time when he should betake himself to the taking in of that
place, where in the neighboring Towns he resolved to lodge them: And
therefore advancing with a part of his Army to Pavia, he commanded Emilius
Ghedini, who was in the parts of Allessandria, with some Dutch Companies
belonging to Ghelidas his Regiment, and some other Italian and Spanish Troops,
to advance to before Ponsone, a Castle situated in the Langhe, between Savoy
and Allessandria, and that he should endeavor to take it, as a place of much
consideration upon the present occasions; for he thereby the better secured the
communication of the Havens of Vado, Finale, and Codoretto, with the State of
Milan. At the appearing of these men, the Town suddenly yielded, which wanting
fitting Fortifications could not hold out; the French retired themselves into
the Castle, which being encompassed with great Towers, and seated on high,
suffered not the Sapniards at the first to advance further; whereupon Ghedini
staying in the Town, and making himself master of such passes by which
Crequis men might come to the succor of that Castle, he speedily advertised
the Governor of Milan thereof, who likewise fearing that it might be succored
by the French (for the loss hereof would be a greater detriment to them for
the aforesaid reasons) sent Don Martin d' Aragona, General of the Artillery
thither, with such Forces as he had with him about Pavia; upon the arrival of
which strength, the Spaniards presently planted their Cannon against the
Castle, which after some days defense, no relief appearing, yielded, and the
Spaniards were masters thereof to Crequi's great grief, who was come from
Cassalle to Turine, expecting the resolves of his King, which by reason of the
agreement made by Parma, he thought might be altered; and foreseeing, that the
Spaniards emboldened by their successes, following their good fortune, might
easily fall upon some greater enterprise before the French could receive fresh
supplies, he sent the Marquis Villa with 4000 Foot and 1000 Horse, to observe
the Spaniards proceedings in those parts. And because for want of pay his
Soldiers did daily disband, and those that remained with him were discontent,
and greatly complaining of the miseries they suffered, he sent again an
express messenger to desire leave of his Majesty to return home, which as he
himself by his own mouth could not obtain, so neither was it granted by these
his desires. He had notwithstanding good words given him, and some moneys sent
him, with which the Soldiers were satisfied, and seemed again to renew their
courage, and he himself reassumed that confidence, which to say truth he had
never laid down. And because to boot with the jealousies that the French had
of the Duke of Savoyes actions, they had the Jesuits in some suspicion, and
more particularly one Father who had formerly been the Dukes Confessor, and
was now one of the bosom Counselors to the Duchess; suspecting therefore
that these Jesuits might employ themselves wholly in Spaniolising those of
Piemont, they secretly desired the Duchess, that she would dismiss that Father
the Court, and they themselves had a better eye to the proceedings and actions
of such Monasticks.

At the same time, when the Imperialists assembled their Forces to oppose the
Swedes, Bannier considering what advantage it might be to him, if he with his
men could come into Franconia and Turingia, before the Romanists; where though
he could not keep, it was sufficient, and of no little importance, if he could
deprive those Territories of all things necessary for the maintenance of an
Army. For the Imperialists being to assemble themselves there, before they
could proceed to further achievements, and not being able to stay long there,
by reason of the Countries devastation, it was certain that the Swedes, should
they have the fortune to be opportunely succored by Sea, might dissipate the
Austrian Forces more by temporizing then by fighting; parting therefore from
Erfurt, he ov^r-runne all the neighboring Fields, and carrying away all that
he found thereof good, he advanced into Franconia, sacked diverse Towns, took
Newstat, cut the Garrison in pieces, and coasting about those Countries, got
good booty. After this he appeared before Leipsick, planted his Cannon against
it, and began to play furiously upon it, and was ready to take it, had not
Azfelt, who had got together a good strength of men, (sent unto him by the Duke
of Luneburg, by Ghetz and Glessing) so boldly opposed him as he did, being
resolved to fight with him; the Swedes knew themselves to be fewer in number
then these men, for Bannier had lost so many men in his past-actions, and
disposed of so many in keeping of those places he had taken, as his Army
amounted to little more then 10000 men, they therefore approved not of the
Counsel of some, that incited thereunto rather out of foole-hardinesse, then
reason, were desirous to fight, and not to appear cowardly by retreating; but
the Swedish Commanders did more maturely resolve not to wait the coming of
the Imperialists; and therefore raising their Tents from where they were
pitched, the Swedish Army retreated to between Leipsick and Torgaw; and Bannier
knowing that without more addition of men, he was not able to fight against an
Army of above 20000 men, he called Major-Generall Stalans in unto his help,
who was attending what the Duke of Luneburg would do, (who having quitted the
Swedish party, and joined himself with the Emperor, and having already taken
Mulhusem upon the River Vnstrat, from the Swedes, used all manner of hostility
against them) Bannier fortified himself in these parts, to keep there till
such time as he might bring the Corn of the neighboring Towns into Stetin
whether he meant to withdraw himself, and backed thereby, together with the
benefit of the Sea, to withstand the Austrians further proceedings. But in his
march Azfelt sent good store of men after him, who coming up unto his Rear
skirmished with them, wherein the Romanists prevailed, and the Swedes were
enforced to retreat to under the shelter of the Cannon of Torgaw, with the
loss of about 600 of their best Soldiers, and some Officers. Whereupon
Bannier perceiving that the succors from Suctia were yet a far off, and that
if so many of the Caesarian Forces as were matching in pursuit of him, should
have there encompassed him, he being then in the State of Saxony, he should
bring his Soldiers in evident danger of receiving some great loss; he
resolved to put a very good Garrison into Torgaw, to the end that the Enemy
might be forced to make some stay there, whilst he with his Army passing over
the Elb, marched toward the lower Saxony intending to draw near the Vesser,
and joining with the Landsgrave of Hessen his Forces, and those of the Prince
Palatine, who by Moneys from the King of England, had raised about 4000
fighting men about Meppen, to return and face the Imperial Army. But he
failed in this his design, for being pursued every where by the Imperialists,
and fearing lest the Towns of Pomerania might in his absence fall into the
Romanists hands, which would have been very prejudicial to the Crown of
Swethland, he retreated to between Franckfort upon the Oder, and Wittemburg,
(with some loss in diverse skirmishes which happened between his men and the
Enemy) that he might there attend Orenghell a worthy Commander, who had
received order to go from Lusatia, and Sletia, toward the said Franckfort, in
the assistance of Bannier.

The Commanders of the Imperial and Saxon Army, being ascertained how the
Swedes were already come before Torgaw, they in all haste past over the Elb at
Dresden; and considering how much the getting of Torgaw would make for them, it
lying in the heart of Saxony, and by which the neighboring Towns were kept in
continual agitation, they mustered their Army, which (the Saxons being numbered
in) came to 20000 Soldiers, and went thitherward; they set upon the trenches
which were before the Bridge, where they found such opposition, as it behoved
them to retreat with much loss. At the news whereof Bannier returned suddenly
to Torgaw, and having met there with an inforcement of 4000 from Lusatia, he
went in pursuit of the Saxons and Imperialists, who knowing they were not
strong enough to contend with the Swedes, were advised to return to Meissen
upon the Elb, between Dresden and Torgaw, and there to hault, in attendance of
such recruits as were preparing for them in diverse places, and to assemble
together 6000 Foot, which after the aforesaid Muster, they had left in defense
of the Frontiers of Saxony toward Lusatia. So as Bannier failing in his
intention of fighting with the Imperialists, whilst by reason of their
divisions they were much weakened, he returned to Torgaw. And hearing that some
Forces were in Lusatia, ready to join with the Austrians, he sent some of his
Horse into that Province, which did much indammage it, and overrun many
Towns, the greatest part whereof they sacked and burnt.

Hermesteime was in this interim straightly besieged by John de Were, who
knowing the importance thereof, it being garrisoned by the French, and
belonging to the Elector of Triers, sat down before it ere he returned into
Flanders; the Governor whereof having put all boys, women, and other useless
mouths out of the Town, prepared as well to defend the Town, as the
Imperialists did to offend ir. But Were did above measure desire to perfect
this his enterprise, as well for his own honor, as for to satisfy the
Electors of Ments, and Cullen, who being incessantly molested by that Garrison,
desired it might be taken; and more particularly for that the Imperialists
being upon this occasion lodged in the Towns thereabouts, these Prelates who
loved their quiet, and were no friends to Brawles, were much incommodiated by
the sojourning of the Austrian Army; for the Soldiers not receiving their pay,
forgoing all discipline, behaved themselves licentiously against the Subjects
of the said Ecclesiastic Princes; and being the more offended with them that
would reprehend them for so doing, they said that those Princes had their
beings from them, and that they might well enough part with a Glass of Wine to
those who had given them whole Vessels. Were being recruited, was intent upon
this business; but the French, who made great esteem of this place, as well in
respect of the consequence of their having harbor there, as for the reputation
of the French Forces, were no less diligent in endeavoring the preservation
thereof, then Were was to take it. They therefore gave the besieged to
understand that succor was coming, and desired them not to fail in their
duties of defending the Town. Moreover Ransaw Governor of Hannaw, a valiant
and experienced Soldier, foreseeing the loss of Hermesteime would occasion
the besieging of the Castle whereof he was Governor, endeavored by all means
possible how he might relieve the Town. And as he was good at stratagems, and
knew how to make use of imposturisme, he treated with two Bargemen or Skippers
of Offembeck, a Village about Franckfort upon the Maine, and by large promises
made them boldly undertake the succouring of the Town: two great Barks being
therefore prepared, and loaded with barrels of Powder, Salt, and Flesh, and
other things which the Town wanted, they took into them four Souldies in
Jesuits habits, and sailed thus toward Franckfort; these being asked at their
coming to the Bridge, by those of the Gu^rd, whither they went, feigned as if
their loading belonged to the Father-Jesuits, who were going to Mentz by reason
of their Chapter which they were to hold in that City; and the said Fathers
being those who dispose of the wills and testaments of many Papist-Princes in
Germany, were consequently held in great esteem, and enjoyed much franchise in
Austria, so as no man thought any treachery could be used by such Monasticks,
who were the true Sentinels of the Austrian greatness, and the very
propagators of the Roman-Faith, and moreover it not being probable, that those
things could come from Hannaw, that not being the way, they happily fell down
the River, still deceiving the Guards with such like excuses, and without any
impediment got into the Fort, the defendants whereof though they were not much
encouraged by this succor failed not in their fidelity.

The French, who to boot with their Forces, had a powerful Navy at Sea,
sailing at this time with some Galliownes, and 12 Galleys from the Haven of
Tolone to Sardinia, came unexpectedly to shore upon the said Island, and having
landed 2000 Foot, they without any gainsay made themselves Masters of the Haven
of Orestan, a place of no strength, and abandoned by the Inhabitants by reason
of the unwholsomenesse of the Air: but considering afterward how it would be
hard for them to get further footing there, as also that they could not well
keep themselves in that Island, in succor whereof Leganes had already sent
some Captains, and Ingineers, to boot with orders given to Signior Gianatin
Doria, to have an eye with his Galleys to the preservation thereof, they
therefore went from thence, and making toward the Island of Saint Marguerit,
and landing advantagiously there, they possessed themselves of a Fort which was
not long before built by the Spaniards for the preservation thereof; and from
thence going before another Fort-Royall which was but negligently looked unto,
and Doria not being able to bring it necessary succor, they made themselves
Masters of it, as they did also of the Island Saint Honor, an Island in the
Mediterranian over against Provence.

Ferdinand the third succeeding his Father Ferdinand the second in the Empire,
from whom he no way degenerated, He first ordered all things necessary for
Civil government, and then, according to the present conjuncture of the time
required, applied himself wholly to Military affairs. And knowing it was
behovefull to advise of such expeditions as would be most advantageous for the
continuation of the War already begun, and which he inherited from his
father, against so many, and so powerful Enemies, he sent for Piccolomini from
Flanders to Vienna, for Were from the Rhyn, for Gallasse from the Palatinat,
and for all the other chief Commanders, with whom having held diverse
consultations, and resolved on the way that was to be taken upon these present
emergencies, he recommended to Piccolomini's charge the Forces in Flanders; to
Gallasse he gave the conduct of those which were to succor Saxony; he
opposed Were against the Swedes; he appointed the custody of Alsatia unto
Gh^ts, and gave Duke Charles of Loraine command over the Army in the Fr^nch
Countee. He afterward chose Prince Echemberg, (son to that Prince who had
for so many years so faithfully served his Father) to be his Ambassador to
the Pope; ^ee failed not afterward to make use of such means as might make
most for his advantage, in those streights whereunto the Empire was reduced.
He ratified the same good correspondency which his Father held with the
Electors, and other dependant Princes; being desirous to hold good
correspondency with the State of Venice, he condiscended to her just desires
concerning the intertainment of her Ambassadors in ordinary, in that Court.
And in respect that they had chosen Signior Giovanni Grimani, a Senator highly
esteemed of in that Republique, of deep wisdom and greatly eloquent, to be
their extraordinary Ambassador, he dispatched away Count Rabatta, a Gentleman
of approved worth and wisdom for his Ambassador in ordinary to that State.
Signior Rainero Zen, Procurator of Saint Marck, and Angelo Canterini, both of
them chief Senators, were sent from Venice, the one to condole the Fathers
death, the other to congratulate the assumption of the son into the Empire,
and were received with unusual civilities, and great expressions of courtesy.
He moreover showed his good inclination to a universal peace; and to this
purpose did confirm and ratify the Election made by his father of the
Plenipotentiaries at the Covention which was to be held at Cullen; as likewise
did the Spaniards who were then very ready, and well disposed toward the Peace
of Christendom. And instead of the Duke of Alcala (who falling sick upon the
way died in Villacco, as he was going to Vienna, that he might from thence go
to Cullen, at which the Court of Spain, and as many as knew his great worth
and endowments, were very much grieved) they chose Signior Don Francisco di
Melo, a man highly esteemed as well for his learning as for his Chivalry. He
coming at this time from Spain to the State of Milan, where not many Months
before he had resided, went in company of the great Chancellor of Milan
toward Cullen; though afterward the rest not appearing who were to be present
there, he altered his way and went into Flanders as shall be said hereafter.
Yet were these the Austrians hopes, affirmed (by those who maintain they ought
not to be trusted unto nor believed) to be artificial; who gave out that the
Spaniards seeing their affairs fadged but ill favouredly, did but thus
endeavor to fence themselves from the hatred which other Princes bare them for
their great desire of increasing their Dominion. And because some discord begun
to break forth in Hungary, between the Papists and Protestants of that
Kingdom, as likewise to provide for other affairs of that Crown, and to have
an eye unto the Consines and Frontiers of the Ottoman, the Emperor summoned a
Diet at Presburg, the Metropolitan of that Province; He moderated the excess
in hunting and music; in brief he gave signs of being a Prince deserving
that Crown, and of being very well inclined to the government of the Empire,
and the good of his Subjects.

The Grisons, being (now that the French were gone out of Rhetia) free masters
of all the Forts, and of indeed all the Valteline, saw it was necessary for
them to be upon good terms with the King of Spain, without which it would be
in vain for them to dream of peacefully possessing that Valley; for they
would either easily be driven from thence by the Spaniards, or else to maintain
it, it would behove them to have recourse to Foreign aid, and particularly
to the French, who being warned by their past-proceedings, would either refuse
to succor them, or else being by reason of state to lend them assistance, they
must expect to be demanded such large conditions as the Grisons should not
easily afterward remove the French from those holds in which they should
again have nestled themselves; so as to shun the being domineered over by the
Spaniard, they must fall under the yoke of France.

They therefore wisely weighing what means would be best fitting for them to
maintain their liberty (which, though they were a necessitous people and bare
of money, they loved more then gold) they resolved before they should slight
those Forts, wherein they themselves kept Garrisons, to send Ambassadors to
Milan to agree with the Agents of Spain, what course they had best take for
the good government of the Valteline, thinking that the Spaniards would fear
that they might again fall under the protection of the French, and therefore
would be glad to comply with them upon any conditions. But because the Spanish
Agents had not, or feigned not to have authority from Spain, to resolve this
affair, or were it their desire to procrastinate the Treaty, and entertain
the Grisons with words and hopes, that they might advise with time, of which
the Spaniards upon all occasions make no little use, they wisely prolonged all
resolution, that they might see what their success would be against the
French, according whereunto they might highten their pretentions.

Don Frederick Enriques, the Spanish Ambassador with the ArchDutchesse Claudia
in Ispurch, was sent for to Milan, as one who having formerly interceded in
accords made with the Grisons, did very well understand those affairs; and in
the mean time the Spaniards made very much of the Ambassadors, entertaining
them at the Kings charge, as it is usual with Princes to do, that they may
captivate the good will of such State Ministers as are with them, to negotiate
such affairs as concern their own interest, though their resolutions were to
send them to the Court of Spain, where they might be graciously received by
the King, and sent satisfied away; to the end, that they might the mean while
take some order with the Forts of Chiavena, Tirano, Sondrio and Grossetto, and
demolish La Riva and Mantello, as situated too near the State of Milan.

These Treaties with the Spaniards were much prejudicial to the French, who to
boot with being deluded by the Grisons through their good correspondeny with
the King of Spain, were to meet with greater difficulties in what they were to
undertake in these parts, by reason that the passages lay open to the succor
of Germany, and of the State of Milan.

Rohan, who at this time entertained himself privately and unimployed,
sometimes in Switzerland, sometimes with Duke Waymer, was commanded to
reassume, by the means of his Protestant friends, a friendship with the
Grisons, and to divert them from their begun-Treaties with the Spaniards,
offering them money, and upon any needful occasion sufficient aid to
maintain their liberty; for it no ways complyde with the French, that they
should contract friendship with the Spaniard. In obedience whereunto, Rohan
used his best dexterity; but for that the favors of private men do seldom
subvert the reasons of a State, especially of Commonwealths, who being always
jealous of their liberty, know no greater obligations then those which tend to
the preservation of themselves, nor never mind any thing save the public
interest, his ingenious negotiations prevailed not. For the Spanish Dubloones,
working more upon particular affection then did French Crowns, and the public
aim being to enjoy that in peace which they had at last with so much labor
regained, they were contented not to imbroile themselves in new affairs. And
the correspondency with the Spaniard, whilst they maintained themselves
quietly in their own possessions, did better suit with the Grisons then
correspondency with the French, whose state lay far from theirs, and from
whose Kingdom they could not reap that profit which they did from the King of
Spaines Territories, and from Germany; for they being a poor people, their
greatest incomes lie in their Traffic with those of Milan, and of the Dutch,
in the transferring of merchandise which pass from Germany into Italy, and
from Italy into Germany, and in many passe^gers, who leave their money behind
them in their Innes, the which not being able to obtain without Commerce with
the Austrians, it would redound much to the prejudice of the public and
private. Whereupon, Rohan more incenst against them then ever, failed not to
press, That his King ought no longer to Treat with them who did with such
disparitie correspond to benefits received; That great Princes ought to secure
themselves of their interessed friends fidelities by force; that way was to be
made by Arms where negotiations could not prevail. And insisting, That the
French should again march with their Forces into the Valteline, he propounded,
That Waymers Army was sufficient to that purpose, with which entering afterward
on this side into the State of Milan, those of Piemont by such a diversion,
might easily much advantage themselves, and totally confound that State; but
such considerations proceeding from Rohans passion, who impatient to live
idly after so many Victories, and so great a renown, was by his valor and
animositie incited to the contrary, were not approved of. For Waymer had
occasion enough to employ himself in Alsatia, the getting whereof was of
greater importance to the French then was the Valteline, not engaging himself
among the unpassable Mountains of Rhetia; for if he should once set upon them,
besides the difficulties of bringing Cannon, Ammunition, and the straightness
of passage, the Spaniards under pretense of assisting the Grisons might get
footing there, which would rather be the way to effect the Austrians ends then
to satisfy the French-mens aims. But Rohan still continuing his anger against
the Grisons, having grievously complained of them to the Switzers of Zurick,
and to every one that he spoke withal, he gave out, that going blindly to
work, they themselves did hammer out a Chain, wherewith afterward they should
find themselves fastened to the Spaniards will. To which purpose, I will not
omit the extract of a Letter written by the said Rohan from Zurick, to an
Italian Gentleman, the contents whereof were: I Very well remember what you
told me as you went for Coira, touching the bent of the discourse which those
Grison Colonells held in the point of their dexterity with our Nation. I have
found the words true by the effects; nothing else could be expected from them,
who having totally given themselves over to their own interest, have been
able by the vizard of public reason, to disguise the monster of unwariness,
and make it appear wisdom. The Grisons shall in time know, what it is to
distrust those, who that they might trust them have vindicated their liberties.
By how many more the Flowers shall be in the Spring of this Spanish friendship,
so much less shall be the fruit which they shall gather in the Autumn of this
their folly. Every one desires the King my Masters Forces, but none looks upon
them with a sincere eye. They might have forborne to have kindled this fire,
which into how great a flame it will burst out is not yet certain. If my King
not well pleased with the contrary events to what he expected in Italy, shall
withdraw his invincible Forces from thence, that he may dispose them elsewhere
more for the advantage of his Crown, it will then be seen whether the
Spaniards having thrown off their perfumed Gloves, with which they temper or
stifle the smell of those that side with them, or draw near them, have hands
of the same odor as they seem to have. Time will be the judge of this
affair, and will peradventure give sentence against those who will repent that
they have repented their friendship with France.




The Spaniards being greatly inheartned by the taking of Ponzone, and the
certainty of the French-mens weak preparations, and very much strengthened by
new recruits from Naples, Spain, and Germany, Leganes thought it became not
the honor of the Spanish Forces to lie idle, whilst they were by their good
success invited to further enterprises. Whereupon he resolved to proceed; and
because Nizza Della Paglia, a Town in Montferrat, environed with no
contemptible Walls and Towers, was a business, though of some difficulty, yet
of no little advantage, for that the entrance into Monferrat was thereby
opened, and thereby way was made for the winning of other Towns at leisure,
which being had, prepared them for the taking of Cassalle, (a strength of
mighty consequence, and which being like a thorn in the side of the State of
Milan, all the designs, ends, and industry of the Spanish Commanders and
State-Ministers, were bent against it) the Austrians not being able to endure,
that such a City should remain in the hands of the French, they brought their
Army before the said Nizza, and so fiercely beset it, as that those of Piemont,
who guarded it, being at the very first filled with fear and confusion, and
despairing of being able to maintain it, they chose rather to accept of
Articles of agreement, then to run the hazard of defending it. The Garrison
marched out with their Arms and Baggage, and retired to Cassalle, to the no
little resentment of the French, who blaming the Governor thereof for his
distrust of succor, took it ill that the Duke of Savoy did not punish him, by
way of example to others. The Spaniards having left some Soldiers to defend
this place, divided their Army into two parts; with the one of which, Leganes
came before Alba, a City of Montferrat; and with the other, Don Martine d'
Aragona went to the taking in of Agliano, a Fort, by reason of its situation,
and in respect of the present times, of great importance. And the Spaniards
knowing of what consequence Nizza was in these present emergencies, they
resolved to keep it, and began to fortify there, and by the taking thereof,
the Garrisons of Montegrosso and Castiole, being of no use, they took them
away. And the Pass at Finale in the State of Milan, being of mighty
consideration, the Spaniards, that they might the better secure it, sent the
Regiments of the Princes Reignold and Borso, from Este into the Langhe, that
they might there watch over the proceedings of the French, over whom Crequi,
after his desires thrice to the contrary, had his Commission of command
renewed; He therefore made all possible preparations to drive back the
Spaniards into the State of Milan; and Leganes rising without any fruit from
before Alba, July 3.
went to Annone, and on the third of July, past back again with his Army on
this side Tanare, upon a Bridge which he threw over at Croce Bianca, two miles
distant from Asti, with intention to surprise that Town; whereat the Savoyards
took such an Alarm, as fearing what might succeed, Marquis Villa came with
4000 Foot and 500 Horse into Asti to defend it, in case the Spaniards should
attempt the taking thereof, and to fortify Alba, the preservation whereof made
much for the Duke of Savoy; so as the Armies of both sides being so near,
continual skirmishes past between the Horse, which was all that was done.

A reciprocal and affectionate correspondency was now more then ever held,
between the Crown of France and the States of the United Provinces of
Holland; and in this present conjuncture, their closest intelligence tended to
the lessening of the Spanish greatness; wherefore their intentions were, that
the one of them should set upon Flanders on one part, whilst the other did the
like in another part, that so they might divert the Spanish Forces, and
consequently make their other resolved on enterprises less difficult. The
Prince of Orange, went therefore unexpectly forth with many Boats which were
provided at Dordrech in Holland; and having imbarqued many Soldiers therein,
he made toward Flushing; and from thence, coming privately to shore upon the
strond of the Marish, which lies between Sluice and the River Scheld, he
endeavored the taking of Hulst, a very considerable Fort, which lies upon the
Confines of Flanders toward Zealand, which if it should have fallen into the
Hollanders hands, it lying near the Marish, and bordering upon Brabant, they
might the easilier have besieged Antwerpe, and done other greater matters in
Flanders; but they being discovered failed in the enterprise, and the Prince
finding no good to be done here, returned to his former Quarters.

The French being upon this agreement advertised of the Hollanders
preparations, entered Hannault, took many Towns, and appeared before Cambray,
threatening as if they had had some design upon that place, the maintaining
whereof (it being the very key which opens and shuts the ingresse into
Flanders,) put the Infant to his trumpes, for he knew the Forces of Flanders
were not of themselves alone able to defend themselves against so numerous a
French Army on the one side, and from the Hollanders who were very powerful on
the other. Hereupon he renewed his importunities at Vienna, which being by the
Spanish Agents represented to the Emperor, obtained orders from him to
Piccolomini, (who had haulted with 10000 Soldiers in the circle of the Rhyn to
observe whether the French and Waymer would enter into Franconia or no) that he
should march to succor the Spaniards, where it should be most requisite. The
Hollanders finding themselves deceived in their intention upon Hulst, and being
advertised that the French had betaken themselves to the taking in of Landresi,
(a strong place, considerably situated, lying upon the Frontiers of Hannault,
by which to boot with their better securing the Confines of Picardy, they
opened the way to greater matters) and that they having already begun to set
upon it, the Spaniards were upon their march to succor it, who that they might
appear with more men in the field, had drawn out many from their Garrisons,
they endeavored to take the Fort Philippina, placed to withstand the
incursions which those of the Garrison of Sluice might make; but they failed
therein; for the Infant coming to the succor of it, whereby the work became
difficult, they quit their designs on that part; and being by secret
intelligence certified, that Breda had but a small Garrison in it, and that it
wanted many things requisite for War, they be thought themselves how they
might recover so important a strength. To this purpose all things necessary for
the enterprise being provided, the Prince of Orange embarked the Army which he
had led into Flanders, and went to Bergenopsome, and from thence about the end
of July encamped himself before that Fort. Where before the Spaniards could
gather their Forces together, or think how to succor the Town, he had so
well entrenched himself round about it, as it was easily discerned he meant to
keep there close to his tacklings. About this time the marriage between
Vlidislaus King of Poland, and Cicely the late Emperors Daughter and this man's
Sister was concluded; which was effected with reciprocal content to the
Polander, that he might keep on Foot his correspondency with the house of
Austria, by the assistance whereof he might in time promise himself some
unexpected good. For when the Wars in Germany should be quieted, the King of
Poland under pretense of bringing in aid from Germany for the War which he
was to resume again with the Swedes, and others, might by thus introducing of
Foreign Armies, easily in fitting time force his Parliaments to make that
Kingdom be hereditary to him and his, which now was but elective. And this
alliance with so neighboring and confining a King was good for the Emperor,
in regard of the supply of men which he might expect from his Brother in law,
now that Germany was thereof so exhausted. Prince Casimire the Kings Brother,
who came to Vienna on the 24th of July attended on by many Nobles and Cavaliers
of that Kingdom, July 24.
did therefore marry the Queen in his Brothers name, and carried her from
thence in great pomp into Poland to her Husband.

But if the French and Hollanders fought prosperously in the Lowe-Countries,
the Austrians were not abandoned by fortune along the Rhyn; for John de Were
constantly continuing his siege before Hermesteime, had reduced those within
the Town to such a condition as they could no longer hold out for hunger, nor
had they any hope of succor. For the Fort being in the midst of the
Territories possessed by the Imperialists, and the French not being likely to
bring their Forces into a Country far distant from their Frontiers, and full
of Towns garrisoned by the Imperialists, not having any place to retreat unto
for safety; and on the other hand, the Landsgrave of Hessen being held in play
by the Marquis Grana, and not able to move thitherward, unless he should
forsake his State and leave it to the discretion of the Imperialists; the
French Governor that commanded in Chief therein, called unto him all the
Officers of the Garrison, and acquainting them in what condition the Town was,
wanting Victuals, and having no hope of being relieved, they jointly agreed to
give up the place, before they should be brought into a greater straight, and
whilst they might have good conditions from the Enemy; there was therefore a
Parle propounded, wherein the besieged and the besiegers differed upon terms;
but Were wisely knowing that Military affairs are subject to unexpected
accidents, and that no cavil ought to be had with such as demand conditions,
and that his longer stay there would turn to his prejudice, the Articles were
agreed on upon the 21th of June; Iun. 21.
that the French were to march forth with their Arms and Baggage, and be
convoyed to Orsoi; and the Forces of the Elector of Cullen were to enter the
Town, and to keep it, till such time as the Elector of Triers were either
remitted into his State, or that some other should succeed in his place; which
when it should so fall out, the Elector of Cullen was bound to restore it to
its proper owner.

Were having by the taking of this strong hold freed himself of all
impediments that his Army could meet withal in those parts, and consequently
being able to betake himself to what he should think best; knowing likewise
that he should do no good, in going against France, the Frontiers whereof were
very well provided for; thought there was no enterprise more fitting, nor
wherein he was likely to speed better then in that of Hannaw, a place of great
importance, and wherein there was an experienced Governor, and a gallant
Garrison, who, with their frequent excursions, did not only keep that Country,
but the neighboring Territories in continual watch and ward. He therefore
leaving Hermesteime, marched with his men, which might amount to about 8000,
thitherward, and being come to Franckfort, he quartered his Soldiers some few
days upon the Villages of the Landsgrave of Darmestat, a little to refresh
them, and the better to enable them for what they were to do. Advancing
forward to the Main he beset Selinghestat, between Franckfort and Ashburg,
wherein was a Swedish Garrison, and having thrown down the walls, and the
defendants having valiantly withstood two Assaults, they would not try their
fortune in the third, which was preparing to be given them, but upon agreement
yielded it upon condition of marching forth without the beat of Drum, or
Matches lighted but they kept not this condition, for in their march one of
their Drummers, rather out of forgetfulness, then for any reason there was
thereof beat up his Drum; at which the Imperialists, as those who when they
find an advantage embrace any occasion whereby they may honest their actions,
making this their pretense, took forthwith all the Swedes prisoners, pillaged
the Captains and Officers, and mixed the Soldiers amongst their own
Companies; Whence it may be observed how requisite solidnesse and wisdom is
in Military affairs, without which all endeavors are in vain. Passing after
this over the Main they environed Hannaw on all sides, and presently
endeavoring to surprise a little Fort which the Swedes had built without the
Gates, they were so briskly received, as that with the loss of 50 men, they
were enforced to retreat in such disorder, as the Governor perceiving it, he
made the Garrison fall upon them, who had time, before the others could beat
them back into the City, to get some Corn and bring it into the Fort. Yet this
their gallandise was soon quelled, for Were advancing in person himself, he
drew his lines nearer the Fort, and securing them with perfect Trenches, he
used the business so as the Swedes prospered not in their sallies, as they did
before; for they always came off with the worst, and were forced to retreat
with loss of honor.

Duke Waymer hearing of John de Werts proceedings, and how he had besieged
Hannaw, he presently rose from his quarters which were about Remiremont in
Lorayne, and was desirous to succor this Fort which had always kept faithful
to the Swedish party, whilst all the rest either basely or voluntarily yielded
to the Caesarians, and therefore it deserved to be succored. To this purpose
he came to Hagg^naw, and whilst he thought to pass over the Rhyn at the
Bridge at Strasburg, the Passage was denied him by the Magistrate of that City,
under pretense that those Citizens intending to keep neutrals, and not to
declare themselves, either for the one, or the other side, they would shun the
occasion of being prejudicialll to either of them. At which Waymer very much
wondering, for upon all other occasions he had received all manner of help
from that City, he desired to know what the alteration might be which had made
them put on this resolution. But the communality of that City, desirous
peacefully to preserve the liberty which they for so many years had enjoyed,
wisely foresaw, that if the French should get the upper hand of the Austrians,
and should drive them far from the Rhyn, their City should run a hazard of
losing its Franchise; and they therefore desired that neither the French should
grow stronger in those parts, nor the Austrians weaker; for their Town being
free, as in the midst between too great extremes, would always be defended by
the one of them, against the injuries that should be offered her by the other;
and each of them being to receive advantage from her situation, they would both
of them strive who should most win her good will. Waymer failing herein, and it
not being now time to show how ill he took it, he returned to his former
quarters in Lorayne, and marched from thence, toward the Bishopric of
Basil, intending to pass the Rhyn there, and then to do what he should
think fittest to make Were leave Hannaw by way of diversion, or else to do
somewhat himself that might counterpoise the loss of that Town. But the Duke
of Lorayne, who had with him some seven or eight thousand men for the
preservation of the rest of the Country, foreseeing this, studied how he might
hinder Waymer in this his voyage. He to this purpose went to meet the Swedes,
and endeavoring to withstand them with more courage then force, he at the
first encounter lost about 400 men, and the rest being fearful, he found his
design vain; so as quitting the field unto the Swedes, left he might meet
with greater loss, he betook himself to strong holds. Whereupon Waymer, by
reason of this so happy encounter, changing his purpose of falling into
Alsatia, haulted, and sent his Horse to Pillage the Towns of the County, and he
with all his Army encamped himself not far from Bisanson, intending to take
that City, but neither did his purpose take effect here; for not being able for
want of Victuals to keep longer there, it behoved him to retreat, and pursue
his former voyage toward the Rhyn: At which the Imperialists of that Province
were so afraid, as that presaging their ruin, and not thinking themselves safe
in their own Country, they forsook all the neighboring Towns, some of them
flying to Strasburg, some to Basil, placing their best movables and Arms in
Brisack, the preservation of which Fort, made whatsoever the Swedes got besides
in Alsatia last but a little.

Thus did affairs proceed in Alsatia, when the Elector of Saxony, every hour
more molested then other, by the incursions of the Swedes, (as much his Enemies
now as formerly his friends) not having competent Forces to resist these
Soldiers long verst in the mischiefs of War, did strongly press the Court
at Vienna, that according to established agreements the Emperor might think
of assisting him; and 'twas given out, that from these delays wherewith he was
fed by the Austrians, some prejudice might ensue to the Imperial Crown, as
doubtlessely it would have happened, if that Elector had reconciled himself with
the Swedes, and joined Forces with them; So as his succor could no longer be
delayed, though the Austrians principal scope, and willing desire, was to have
the War maintained and nourished in Saxony; for that all other parts having
been visited sometimes by their friends, sometimes by their Enemies, and
consequently destroyed and ruinated, if Saxony should likewise be in the same
manner weakened, the Imperial dignity would at last be the more secured.
Hereupon Gallasse received orders, that having first provided for the places of
greatest importance in Wirtenberg, where his men were then quartered, he should
march with the rest of his Army, which came to about 10000, toward Saxony; and
that joining with Azfelt, who not long before was gone in succor of the
Elector, he should not only have a care to defend Saxony, but should endeavor
to suppress the Swedish Army, and to recover such places as were fallen into
the Enemies hands. Which Gallasse readily obeying, he went after Bannier, who
was about Torgaw, and charged him with such dexterity, as though Bannier
behaved himself gallantly in his retreat, being far inferior to the
Imperialists in number; yet for all his wariness, when the Austrians Vanguard
came up to his Reere, it behoved his Reere to face about, and fight with them,
that so they might not incur the name of Cowards, and lose the reputation
they had already won; after a bloody skirmish, wherein the Swedes lost about
500 Soldiers, he with the rest of his Army retreated gallantly under the
shelter of the Cannon of Torgaw; where calling a Council of War, the present
occasions being wisely weighed, and it being found impossible for them to
maintain themselves there without greater strength, it was with a joint
consent agreed upon, That having first burnt and spoiled all the Country
thereabouts, they should retreat to the strong holds in Pomerania, and keep
themselves there; the which strong holds they might the easlier make good,
because to boot with their strength of situation they might continually be
supplied by Sea; and on the contrary, the Imperialists wanting necessaries to
fit themselves for such an enterprise, by reason of the distance of place, they
could not long maintain their Army in those parts which were wholly ruinated,
and all whose goods and best things were conveyed into their strong holds.

From these Arguments a probable Consequence ensued, that the Caesarian Army
being destroyed by Famine, they must, to their little honor and great loss,
be forced to retreat without doing any good; and in the mean time the promised
aids coming from Swethland, and Orenghells Forces being joined to Banniers,
(who was again parted from him by reason of affairs fallen out elsewhere) the
Swedish Army being reinforced, and the Imperialists weakened, they should not
only return with advantage to the places they had forsaken, but bring their
Forces into the heart of Saxony, and into the Kingdom of Bohemia. Having then
broken the Bridge at Torgaw, and left 3000 of his best Soldiers to guard that
Town, and so much Provision of all sorts, as they might well maintain
themselves there six months, he marched toward Landsperg; but being pursued
by Gallasse, who endeavored how he might engage the Swedes in a Battle; and
Bannier knowing himself not able to contest with him in the Field, he
therefore pursued his former intention of getting into strong holds; and
quitting the Field unto the Imperialists, he left Landsperg; and after a
skirmish which happened between his Horse and the Enemies, with little loss
to either side, he retreated to Stetin; that he might stay there, and from
thence send supply to such places, as being set upon by the Austrians stood in
need thereof. Gallasse marched forwards, and planted his Cannon before
Landsperg; he opened their Trenches, and the Imperialists falling upon the
Ditch, which was defended by Traverses, he sent the Dutch to make an assault,
who were desirous to end the business, being already weary of what they had
suffered without any refreshment, the Country being ruinated. This assault was
bravely withstood by the Swedes, and Gallasse being angry at the delay, (for
had he been to have kept before it but four days, either his men must have
been destroyed, or must to his little honor have given over the enterprise) he
prepared for another fierce assault; and the defenses being drilled through by
the Cannon, and the Towers beaten down, the besieged persuaded the Governor
to Treat of an Agreement. But he being a gallant Soldier, and rather desirous
to dye honorably, then live with any the least stain of infamy, answered,
That the custody of Forts was committed to Governors, to the end, that they
within might with a few resist the violence of many without; That they ought
not to be astonished at the noise of the Cannon, and grounding their reasons
upon some invented necessity yield up the place; That the surrender of the
Town was not to be thought of, unless compelled by such general necessity
as was not to be withstood by valor; That it was the duty of a Governor,
first to consider the number of his defendants, which if he should not find to
be sufficient, he was to make his desires known before the Enemy were
approached; That it was more honorable to dye with Sword in hand, then to
prejudice the publik interest for the safety of a few. And at last, putting
them in mind how they had wont to walk those streets vaunting, that they
feared not Mars himself, he resolved upon defense. He therefore obstinately
made good the breach, but neither could his, not yet his Soldiers valor
withstand the Enemies violence, who stormed the City, killing many of the
defendants, and taking many of them prisoners.

The Imperialists, increasing in their hopes by the getting of Landsperg, they
forthwith marched for Pomerania, hoping to meet with the same success; but as
all things have their vicissitudes, and suffer alternations, the Austrians
found not their proceedings so smooth in Pomerania as they did here; for though
Gallasse took Ribnets and Damgartem, places of no great consideration, he
prospered not in his oppugning Anclam, (a strength of great moment, lying in
the heart of Pomerania, not far from the River Pene, between Volghast and
Stettin) by the taking whereof, they should not only the better secure their
own abode in Pomerania, but keep all the Towns in continual jealousy which
lie between Straelsundt and Stettin, and make the Swedes weary of keeping
longer in that Province, where they could only have their Provisions by Sea.
Gallasse therefore drew near unto it, and began to play upon it with his
Cannon; but the strong Garrison rendered all his attempts, and all that he could
do, vain, and continually held the Caesarians work in their own quarters.
For Bannier with the gross of his Army, which was reinforced by numbers of
men landed at Wolghast, lay about Gripswold, from whence by continual
surprialls, sometimes upon one, sometimes upon another quarter of the
Imperialists, he greatly incommodiated their Camp. So as Gallasse seeing the
difficulties grow greater, and the want of Victuals continue, the expected
moneys from Vienna not appearing, to satisfy the Soldier in that behalf who
began to mutiny, and his Army being much lessened by the death and running away
of many, as on the contrary, the Swedish Army continually increased, he
resolved to raise his Siege, (having lost about 800 of his best Soldiers in
it) and to return to Marca Nova, that he might refresh his men, and their
expect the moneys which he by sundry expresses much solicited, and without
which he could neither move from where he was, nor keep his Soldiers from
running away.

The Prince Elector Palatine, Son to the late Elector Frederick, whose State
was taken from him by the Emperor, was at this time at Meppen upon the River
Amasia, (which running from the Confines of Paderborne, into the Country of
Lip, falls into the Sea between Emden and Munster) where he was by moneys,
which his Uncle the King of England furnished him withal, raising an Army
wherewithal to recover in these times of trouble the Palatinate from the house
of Austria. And because the men, that by his procurement were imbarqued in
England were not yet come, he delayed his march; which the Austrians in no
ways dreading, seemed not much to care for; and this was only attributed to
the small experience of the Soldiers which were but then taken from forth the
peaceful quiet of England. When the Landsgrave of Hessen, who notwithstanding
the offers and entreaties of Peace, made unto him by the Imperialists, kept
constant to the Swedes party, seeing Orenghell gone from his State, as also
the Marquis of Grana, who was employed in the Siege of Hannaw, bethought
himself to stand no longer idle, but mustering together the Army commanded by
Melander, and thinking himself able to relieve Ha^naw, he marched thitherward
overran many Towns, took Victenaw, and betook himself boldly to the
succor of that Fort; but the Elector of Ments hearing of this, who was most
concerned in the taking of it, as flanking upon his Territories, he assembled
together his Forces, together with those of Colonel Meternich who guarded
those passages; He made them wade over the River Chitzing, by the intelligence
of the Count D'Hannaw, who till then had kept Neutrall, and who making use of
the correspondency which he held with many of the Swedish Commanders, being
nearly allied to the Counts Ringraves, the chief Captains of the Crown of
Swethland, he so wisely behaved himself in the behalf of the Austrians, as
one Gate of the new Fort being surprised, and the Cannon being turned against
the old Fort, he made Ransaw the Governor thereof resolve to parley, and
incline to the surrender of the place, which ensued with all the advantageous
conditions the Swedes could desire, and with the disbursement of some moneys by
way of advance to the Garrison.

DUke Waymers appearing in Alsatia made the Austrians very jealous, who much
apprehended his resolutions, he being a Prince addicted to Arms, and Glory,
and backed by the Forces of France; it likewise made them look to the
preservation of such Towns as held out yet for the Emperor; and chiefly the
Duke of Bavaria was jealous thereof, as he who if this Province should fall
into the hands of the Enemy, was more subject then any other to their
incursions and hostilities; wherefore warily foreseeing what might fall out,
he commanded Were to march speedily with his Foot into that Province, and have
an eye unto Waymers proceedings. And because Were had not above 6000 Soldiers,
too small a number in regard of the Forces against which he was to go, which
consisted of about 12000 old Soldiers, besides the inforcements which every
day were added thereunto by the French who were not far off, he haulted in
the Palatinat, and bethought himself, that if he should go into Burgundy, and
join with those Forces which held for the King of Spain there, 'twould be a
good means to divert Waymer from his intended enterprise upon Brisack. He
therefore past the Rhyn at Filisburg, and went with his Army to Remiremont, a
Town in Lorayn, upon the Confines of Burgundy, intending to do somewhat in
those Provinces: But finding his foundation ill laid, for that so many French
were upon those Frontiers, as that they might easily frustrate his designs
without sending for Waymer back, his abode there proving every day more
irksome then other for want of Victuals; and being advertised by the Elector
of Ments, who was thereof informed by some Friars in France, that the
French-mens intensions were to send Waymer to the siege of Brisack, he went
from Burgundy that he might look to the preservation of that place, and
falling down toward Brisack, came near to Waymers quarters, who not doing
any thing, kept himself about a Village called Cappell on this side Rhyn,
between Basil and Brisack. At the news whereof Waymer went in regulate order
from his Trenches, being resolved to try whether Were were come to fight with
him, or only to disturb his designs by stratagem. But Were who very well
knew upon what disadvantage he was, and who by past examples had learned, that
it is always good to proceed in Military affairs with wisdom, and not to be
undone by too much daring, grounding his actions upon reason, haulted for the
advantage of his own quarters in expectation of Duke Savello and Colonel
Mercy, who were both commanded by the Emperor to join with him, and jointly
to provide for the preservation of Alsatia. So as each Army keeping within
their quarters, the one expecting recruits from the Emperor, the other from
the King of France, they stood looking upon one another, and did nothing of
moment.

The besieged within Landresi did this mean while valiantly defend themselves
against the French, who did with no less valor thunder open those Walls,
as well to bring that work to an end, as for the honor of their Arms, which
without the taking thereof would have been much impeached; but the besieged
languishing through their continual toil and labor, and being very much
lessened in their numbers by their daily fighting, wherein many of them
perished, not being able longer to hold out without speedy succor, which
though it were endeavored by the Spaniards and by Piccolomini, who as it has
been said was to that purpose come into the Low Countries, could not be
effected, after they had stoutly repulsed the French Volunteers, who had
assaulted them diverse times, in diverse places, and after having withstood 6000
Cannon shot, at last a Mine made by the French blowing up part of their Walls,
they not being able longer to resist, showed signs of parle; and Articles
being agreed upon, they marched forth on the 26th of July, with Colors flying,
Drums beating, Bag and Baggage, the most honorable conditions that the
conquered can receive from the Conqueror. July 26.


The way being by this means opened to the French to enter further into
Flanders, they went with their Horse before Mons, between Cambray and
Brussels, and sacked Saint Ghisleim, Bavay, and other neighboring places, to
the great terror of those people, who seeing the Spaniards were not able to
succor Landresi, feared the like might succeed to the other Towns; but the
French finding afterward how little good they were like to get if they should
endeavor the taking of Mons, they thought the recovery of La Chappelle, and
Castellet would make more for their purpose; they therefore removed from their
quarters they had taken up, and resolved to besiege those two Forts; And the
Duke of Candal coming with some Troops of men before Bewmons, easily took it.

The Marquis Leganes perceiving he could do but little good against Asti, to
the succor whereof Marquis Villa, and the French were come, gave over that
design. He left notwithstanding a good Garrison in Niece and Agliano, with
sufficient provisions for their defense; for the Spaniards thought them places
of much importance upon these present occurrencies, as a bridle to withold
the French from making any further progress on that part, and apt to keep the
neighboring Towns in continual motion; and passing back on this side
Tanaro, and then on this side Poe also to Valenza, he came upon the Territories
of Vercelles. The Spaniards aim was upon Brem, a place of great advantage to
the French; for as by the getting of it they should keep the Towns of the
Territories of Pavia and Novara in continual suspicion; so if they should not
get it, the Spaniards could not possibly proceed to the enterprise of Cassall.
Hereupon then they bent their thoughts, especially Leganes, being advertised,
that though Mongaiard who was the Governor thereof made them believe at Court
that he had 3000 Foot, and received pay from the King for so many, yet he had
not in all 1700 men, and those in ill equipage: For Mongaiard and the other
Captains, who came not into Piemont for change of air, but to change their
fortunes, being more inclined to enrich themselves by dead pay, then to win
their wealth from those of Milan by the sword honorably, ^ad their minds
only bent upon their purses, that they might afterward return into France,
and peacefully enjoy what they had got; Neither knew the King hereof; for every
one minding his own particular interest, no one would ruin himself by
peaching his fellow-Officer.

The Spaniards therefore thinking this a good occasion to perfect that
enterprise, they brought the greatest part of their Army upon the Territories
of Vercelles, and taking Carasona, a Town near Sofia, between Vercelles and
Brem, they haulted there, and fortified themselves, thinking this a very
fitting place, to bring them either to the taking of Vercelles or Brem.

The Neapolitan Horse over-ranne and sacked many Towns thereabouts, not
omitting such diligence as is known by wise Commanders to be requisite in the
mannaging of War. But Marshall Crequi, blushing to see his honor so much
decline, which he in so many occurrences had won by his Sword, fearing that
if the Spaniards should take a place of that importance, he looking on, to boot
with the loss, it would much lessen his renown, he assembled his Army which
was dispersed in their several quarters, and went to Pontestura, between
Cassall and Trino, and throwing a Bridge over the Poe, he past his Army over on
this side, though much too weak to buckle with the Spaniard (who was provided
of all things necessary, and whose Army was composed of good Soldiers) and
made it appear, the French fail not in their courage, though upon
disadvantagious terms. He with his Horse pursued the Spaniards, who under the
command of Don Martin of Aragon, were gone to plunder the Towns in the
Territories of Vercelles, and having laid an anbush, whilst the Neapolitans
were returning to their quarters with great herds of Cattle, he unexpectedly
set upon them, and after a bloody skirmish, wherein though the Italians behaved
themselves with courage and constancy, they were notwithstanding at the last
put to the worst; Boccapianola (a Neapolitan, and Field-Master) was there
slain, as also Don John di Lelmo, Captain of the Horse, Captain Spadino was
taken prisoner, and about some 60 Soldiers, of which, some were of good
esteem; for Commanders usually employ their best Soldiers in businesses of
greatest danger. On the other side, the Duke of Savoy, (who upon news of the
Spaniards approach, fearing Vercelles, was come in person thither)
understanding that the Princes of Este were retired with their men to Leganes,
commanded Count Verva to go with 4000 Soldiers into the Langhe, where he
sacked many Towns, past over the Poe, fired Pieve del Cairo, and endeavored,
though in vain, to take the Castle of Arazzo; for it being well defended by
the Spaniards, and Don Martin of Aragon coming speedily into the succor of
it, the Savoyards rose from before it, having lost about one hundred of their
men.

During this revolution of affairs, the present condition of the Crown of
Spain was justly weighed by the piercing wits thereof, and the powerful
Forces of France was to their great grief examined, which being wholly united
did much annoy the Austrians, and by evident example did deceive those who fed
themselves with hopes of kindling civil dissension in that Kingdom, and did
chiefly apply their wits thereunto. For the Kings reconciliation to his Brother
the Duke of Orelans, from whom the Spaniards had received so many assurances,
made them know they were to ground but little belief upon the faith of that
Nation, which being rival to theirs, would upon occasion make it appear, That
though it were treacherous to its King it, would be much more false to the
Spaniards; and that those means were now become desperate, by which in former
times, when the King was under age, the Princes of the Kingdom took the
boldness to prescribe Laws to the unlimited Regal power; and that the
Cardinal Richelieu, a faithful servant of that Crown, and one of an
exquisitely refined judgment, knew how to countermine the Spanish Plots. They
therefore resolved to follow the example of Scipio Affricanus, by bringing the
War into France, whilst France made War out of France. To this purpose, they
began to provide for all things necessary to set upon Languedock (a Country
which extends it self from Provence unto the Pirenean Mountains, and which is
of a temperate climate, very fruitful, and populous) by the invasion whereof,
their intentions were not only to divert those Forces which threatened Italy
and Flanders, but (that which was of greater consequence) to frighten those
Inhabitants, and see whether by their assistance they could make them take up
Arms against the Kings Ministers of State, as those who had occasioned the War
in France. And because almost all the Military men that had employment in
Italy, Flanders, or elsewhere, were sent for from far into the King of Spaines
Dominions; for the Council of Spain, thought it not fitting to give the
government of an Army in Spain to one of the same Nation; for the preferring
of one Subject before the rest in his own Country, is to derogate from the
pretensions of many others, who think themselves not inferior to the party
preferred, and to raise him to too great an height whom they so exalt; they
were aware of this, and therefore sent for Count John Serbellone to command
those Forces, a Subject of the State of Milan, of great esteem, and of
experienced worth in Military affairs; as well to take him from the pretenses
he had in the Armies of that State, as for the forementioned reasons of
shunning emulation amongst themselves; as also for Marquis Phillip Spinola,
Nephew to that great General Ambrosius, under whom he had been disciplined.
When these came to Madrid, they were received with much civilitie by the King
and Queen, and all the Court, as those who were thought might be serviceable
unto them in the time of War; though the wiser sort were of opinion, That these
were but counterfeit demonstrations of contentment, such as are frequently used
by such as stand in need of another assistance; for it was held for certain,
that the Spaniards, who envy all other Nations, desire to monopolize all their
Grandezzes within themselves. The Duke of Cardona (who was commanded to raise
as many men as he could in those Kingdoms) had now assembled together an Army
of between ten and twelve thousand men, to boot with other Soldiers remaining
in Novar, under the Duke of Nocera, to watch over the French, who by reason of
the Spaniards entering in hostile manner into those parts, were now become
strong, and had driven the Spaniards from Bayon, where they had met with hard
usage. The Spaniish Commanders, thinking it now fitting time to effect their
resolves, and Serbellone desirous at his entrance to do somewhat handsomely,
they turned their march toward Leucata, a City in Languedock near Narbone,
and not far from the Sea, as a place very fit to make way for greater
enterprises. Their Army being brought before it, Serbellone and the Marquis of
Mortara, took up their quarters on the side toward Narbonne; Francis Specchi,
Master of the Field, with his men quartered at Franchina, and the Duke De monte
Reale, took up his abode at the place called Sferra Cavalli; they set a great
number of Pioniers on work in the digging of Trenches, as well against the
City, as to keep off succor, and thought verily to take the Town, for the
French Forces were afar off; neither did it comply with them to remove them
from the Rhyn, and from Flanders, to employ them here. They planted their
Cannon against it, and beset it; the Catelonians, using more bravery with their
tongues then with their Swords, as never having seen any Squadrons, unless of
Cattle, they being for the most part Country people. But as things suddenly
raised, are oft-times as suddenly razed, they failed in what they intended; for
the Alarm being given to all the French thereabouts, and those Confines being
strengthened by Troops of Horse and Foot, speedily sent thither from the
neighboring Provinces by the Governors thereof, these men naturally hating
the Spaniard, did with such have and fury, as is natural to the French, flock
to aid the besieged; and the Spaniards being for the most part fresh-men of
the Trained Bands, and not used to War, they either knew not how, or were not
able, to resist the fierce assault, which the French, not valuing their lives,
made upon their Trenches, about three a clock at night on the 28th of
September, Septem. 28
so as it behoved them to give way to the French, and bethink themselves of a
retreat, which they could not so orderly perform, but that they lost all their
Artillery, their Baggage, and about 2000 men.

The news whereof being speedily brought to the Court of France, was very
welcome, and made the French look about them, and provide for that, which had
they not been awakened by the Spaniards, perhaps they would never have drempt
of. So turning their eye this way, they were hereby incited to recover that
which was formerly taken away by Ferdinand King of Spain, by reason of Pope
Julius the second his Excommunication, thundered out against John Albert^^, who
sided with Lodovick the twelfth. Signior De Schamont, was commanded to assemble
together as many men as he should judge requisite for the business, and march
toward Parpignon, and the Prince of Conde was by His Majesty declared
General of that Army, and for that Affair.

As one misfortune comes seldom alone, but is followed by a greater; if the
Spaniards fared ill in Languedock, they fared not better in Flanders nor in
Lorayne. For Prince Thomas and Piccolomini, not being able to succor La
Chapelle, (too narrowly beset by the French) the besieged having discharged the
parts of good Soldiers, after having held out valiantly many days, and now
despairing of relief, they yielded up the Town to the French on the 21th of
September: Septem. 21
and Duke Longheville, falling with 6000 Soldiers into Lorayne, he took the
strong passage of Doux in Burgundy, routed some of Duke Charles his Horse, and
sacked many Towns in that Province. On the other side, the Infant, finding it
impossible for him to relieve Breda; the Spaniards having been received to
their no little loss in the Duke of Bullions quarters, he went to the taking
in of Ruremond, and Venlo, Forts possessed by the Hollanders upon the Mosa, (to
see whether by the setting upon these, he could remove the Prince of Orange
from the Siege of Breda) the which within a few days yielded to him, the
Garrison not being able longer to defend themselves, for the defendants were
but few, and their Works imperfect. This (though) availed but a little; for the
taking of Breda was of greater importance to the Hollanders, it being strongly
seated, and whereby they should not only the better secure their Frontiers on
that side, but might extend their raising of Contributions even to Antwerpe and
Lira, then the loss of six Ruremond's. The Prince of Orange therefore
continued constant in his Siege, and the defendants being reduced to great
extremity of all things, and wanting succor, they yielded up the Town on the
10th of October upon the same conditions as were formerly granted by Spinola,
when he took the same Town in the year 1624.

Piccolomini finding it lost labor to endeavor the succouring of La
Chappelle, went with his Army to before Maubrug, a City seated between Landresi
and Mons, near the river Sambra; that if La Chapelle should be lost, somewhat
might be had by the taking of Maubrug. The Cardinal of Vallette, who after he
had taken the Castle of Bussegni, waited upon the Austrians, to see what they
would do, seeing what danger the City was in, which if it should be lost he
looking on, would have redounded much to the shame of the French Forces,
marched speedily toward the Imperialists Camp; But Piccolomini who knew
himself inferior in force to the French, raised his Tents before they came up
unto him, not judging it now time to grapple with them; and this the rather,
for that it was the Austrians firm advice, and the Emperors express command
(who as it was thought would not have willingly dispossessed himself of so many
men, though it had been for his own affairs of the Empire) that care should
be had to spare the Soldiers as much as might be, since Germany being by
reason of so many Wars depopulated, recruits must be had from far, and
would be hardly come by; whereas France on the contrary, being united, and full
of Warlike people, who were desirous to see the world, the King found no
difficulty in recruiting his Armies; he therefore retreated near Mons.

The Imperialists retreat from Pomerania into the State of Brunswick and
Alberstat, encouraged the Swedes; and Orenghell being joined with Bannier, they
came both together to Stettin; where agreeing that no favorable occasion was
to be pretermitted which might invite them to further advancement, they
resolved upon the recovery of Garts, as well to free the Villages which were
under the command of their Forts from being insulted upon by the Garrison of
that place, as to open their way to greater Achievements, when the Forces
should be come up unto them which were continually taken into pay by the
Swedish Officers in Swethland, and in Pomerania, which place not being able to
resist the Swedes, and the Inhabitants thereof, the greatest part being
Protestants, desirous to return to the government of those of the same
Religion, and publicly to enjoy that liberty of Conscience, which they so much
valued, and the Emperors Soldiers, who had the Guard thereof, fearing no
less the injuries of the Inhabitants (no well-wishers to the
Roman-Catholiques) then the Swedes invasion, they surrendered the Town to
Bannier; who was contented they should march out with their Arms and Baggage,
though the Citizens thereof, complaining that the Imperialists carried away
with them many things taken from their houses, desired that was taken from them
might be restored to them; for the Imperialists in lieu of pay which they laid
claim unto, took away wheresoever they came all they could lay their hands on,
without any manner of respect. The Swedes growing still more bold by these
successes, they marched without any let to before Verben, where planting their
Cannon, and beating down their Trenches, the Saxons who had the Guard thereof,
staid not to be Assaulted, but surrendered the City, and many of them who hoped
for little good from the Dukes pay, changed colors, and inroled themselves
under the Swedes, which the Elector did much resent; who knowing very well that
if fortune should prove propitious to the Swedes, his mortal Enemies, all the
mischief and all the storm was to fall upon him, and his State was likely to
prove the seat of War, he incontinently advertised the Court at Vienna
therewithal, as also Gallasse (who for want of Victuals, Money, and Men,
disbanded through hunger and sufferings, durst not stir from his lodgings
into the Army, for fear of a general mutiny) and representing the general
ruin which over-hung his estate, he required and very earnestly pressed the
Emperor not to fail in his promised assistance. Whereupon the Austrian
Counsel knowing how necessary it was to give satisfaction to this Prince, from
whose friendship Bohemia received great advantage, having Saxony for their out
Wall, without which the War would suddenly be brought into that Kingdom,
though their Cofers were empty, yet the Spanish fleet supplied the want thereof
(the Spaniards seeming no less concerned herein then the Dutch) and furnished
300000 Dollars, which were sent to Gallasse, with orders to oppose the Swedes;
with which the Army being a little comforted, they went from their quarters in
Brunswick, and marched toward Bannier; who not yet able to withstand the
Forces, both of the Emperor and Saxony, went from Verben, and haulted between
Demitz and Stettin, thinking to incommodiat the Imperial^sts as formerly, and
to drive them back from whence they came, rather by Famine then by the Sword;
so as the Saxons being left about Verben, they suddenly retook it; and
Gallasse coming before Demin, tried (though in vain) to take that Fort; for
not being able to reduce it so speedily as he had thought, he was forced for
want of Victuals to enlarge his quarters toward Brandenburg, where being
followed by the Swedes (who were much enforced by fresh succor come from
Swethland) diverse skirmishes past daily between them, but of no great moment.

At this time William Landsgrave of Hessen, a sprightly Prince, and given to
the Wars, exhorted the King of England all that he could, to make use of this
opportunity, in remitting the Counts Palatine into their State, to which
purpose many men were raised about Meppen; and as well for this, as for other
common causes, the League between France, Swethland, and Holland, was again
established; in which France promised to pay 12000 Soldiers, Swethland 5000,
and Holland 5000.

The Landsgrave being now gone in person to Meppen, to consider what course was
to be taken for the mannaging of this War, and from thence to Holland to
agree with those States what was best to be done in these present emergencies,
whilst he returned well-satisfied with his negotions to his own Country, he
fell into a malignant Fever in Leer, a City which lies near the Amasio,
between Meppen and Embden, whereof he dyed, to the great grief of the
Protestants who loved this Prince exceedingly, he being a constant defender of
their Religion, and very firm in his friendship with his confederates, never
failing in his promise, though unevitable ruin appeared thereby to his
Dominions. Therefore did the King of Swethland to answer him in affection, as
when he fell to pra^se any one, he never forgot the Landsgrave of Hessen, and
Duke Bernard Waymer, affirming that these two young Princes surpassed the
gray headed wits of Germany, and that the Kingdom wherein they were had reason
to boast. The Landsgrave was a comely presence, his body well composed, he
enjoyed a proportionable activity, his aspect was pleasing; whilst he was
young he went into Holland, and and lived under the Discipline of that great
Maurice, Prince of Orange; by obeying he learned how to command; as Students
get learning from good Masters, so he seconded by his warlike genious learnt in
this famous School that exquisitnesse which is required in a perfect Captain.
Going afterward from Holland he visited all the chief States of Europe, and
through a general knowledge which he acquired, he knew so worthily and so
judiciously to behave himself, as that his subjects reverenced him out of
duty, loved him out of affection, and out of gratitude adored him; the Soldier
out of wonder admired him, and took glory to obey him, and happy was the man
who by any action could outstrip another, that so he might obtain thanks
from him, or but one gracious word. The gravity of his Condition mixed with his
affability to inferours, won the praise of all Tongues; he lived like a
Prince, did like a Soldier, and treated like a Companion; he past away his
leisure hours in exercising his Arms, in the perusal of good books, and in
drawing, and designing; he had wont to say, a Prince had no greater Enemy then
rest, that when the body was at quiet, the mind was most unquiet, and that the
labor of the body did quiet the intellect; he affected not pomp; he was not
subject to ambition; he used no subtleties; he held that gravity in a
Soldier, was a vizard or mask, which made men mistake how he was affected;
for to him that makes honor his chief, and the greatest incitement he can
have, and the greatest reward he can receive, is honor; He said, That such men
were like disguised mulitiers, who being set upon a courageous Horse, and
thinking it to be their accustomed Mule, they through indiscretion run
headlong upon the rocks of hatred and desperation: Fishes by the Hook, and
Birds in a Net, are taken with such baits as are proper for their nutriture,
not with meat contrary to their nature; He put no greater a valuation upon
lascivious men, nor accounted them no better then women; He said, He could not
think they had any heart, who taking it off from glory, had basely imprisoned
it in the sickly thoughts of fading pleasure; Anger lasted no longer in him;
then did the fire last which first kindled it, as he was apt to take up anger,
so was he apt to lay it down even like a fire of straw; He mightily blamed
those, who reserving a private hatred in their breast, did revenge themselves
by their Princes hand, and detested their actions, who armed with their Princes
Authority, made use thereof to compass their own odd ends; He affirmed, It
was a sign of baseness to resent any thing done by an inferior, or one of
less power; That not to consider ones private passions, when the public
interest was in question, was the effect of a generous mind; In brief, he was
very punctual in care of preserving his good name, which employing all his
endeavors thereunto, he obtained; and he was constant in his desire to be
thought constant to his friend, or wherein his friend was concerned, as not
regarding even reason of State, when his promise was once past, he would rather
be thought indiscreet then false of his word; Nay, he would maintain that
reason to be false, which will have a Prince to be like a clock, which stands
still or goes about, only as driven by the counterpoise of his own interest,
alleging, that those Princes, who so easily tack about, distrusting all men,
though they become not a prey to their Enemy, they rest at last inslaved to
their own minds; for their fear of repenting, is sure to make them repent. To
conclude, if the Landsgrave, who was known to be one of the worthiest Princes
of all Germany, had known how to hide (at least to dissemble) his perfect
hatred against Romanists, no doubt but his very Enemies would have commended
him, and have confessed him to have been a Prince that deserved all honor, and
a better condition. But both by his tongue and his deeds, he expressed himself
too bitterly against them upon all proffered occasions, and otherwise then
became the qualities he was endowed withal, which did much lessen his renown.
Amongst many things he said, He had wont to insist much upon one, though upon
false grounds; to wit, that it might be permitted to some of regular orders of
Friars, to keep Academies and Schools of seculiar Sciences, alleging for his
reason, that every religious order being like a Re-publique, which always
aims at its own preservation and interest of greatness, by seasoning their
Pupills during their younger years, in the rules of their several orders,
they make them only fit for a Pulpit or Quire, and so deprive their Prince of
many a Subject, who if employed in the Wars or State-Affaires, might have
proved very beneficial to their King, and to their Kingdom.

The Duke of Savoy, who was come to Vercelles upon the news of the Spaniards
being upon those Territories, was there suddenly seized upon by an
indisposition of health, which suddenly bereft him of his life on the 7th of
October, to the great grief of his Duchess, and of all his Subjects; for
having left behind him only two Sons and one Daughter, all of them very
young and incapble of government, they knew that by this death, no small
troubles would arise throughout Piemont. He was of an aspect not unpleasing, of
a reasonable stature, and courteous in his behavior (as are all the Princes of
that Family) He governed himself very wisely; he by his wisdom compast all
his actions, and by dexterity knew so well how to cover his weakness, as he
was esteemed of, and held by many for a much knowing man. If on the Mothers
side he had partaken some of her Fathers Character, and had shared of his own
Fathers conditions, he might have been truly termed Son of that great
Charles, whose worth and virtue no tongues are able sufficiently to celebrate;
and Heir, not only to his Principality, but Intellect also, if Fortune,
which smiles not alike upon all, had suffered him to govern in another
conjuncture of time. He seemed to be more inclined to Peace, and quietly to
increase his State, then addicted to the novelties of War. He governed
himself with much Policy in all his Affairs, making it appear, he trusted
more to his wisdom then to his daring. He lived a friend to glory,
endeavoring greatness, and and coveting esteem: He therefore invented the
title of Regal Altezza. He made new pretenses, not formerly found out by his
Predecessors. And thinking better of himself then his Forces would make good,
he seemed more by the prerogative of his birth then by the increase of his
Dominions to pretend to a greater esteem then his Predecessors had. He was a
good Prince for his Subjects but not for his friends, his principal scope
being his own proper interst, and having no other particular affection. He
dyed when he was 51 years old, a bitter death, since by nature he might have
lived many years longer; but very well to be borne withal, and no ways to be
wondered at, by one whose indispositions were such as was his, for besides the
Cough of the Lungs, he was of a very weak Complexion.

The Spaniards likewise much resented the death of this Prince, for he being a
great Politician, and one who desired to keep fair with the French, to the
end that they might permit him quietly to enjoy his own State, but with no
intention that they should get further footing in Italy, many were of opinion,
that he held secret intelligence with the Spaniards, and that this was a chief
cause why the State of Milan was no further indammaged; for cloaking the
secrets of his mind with outward simulation and appearances, he dexterously
governed the affairs of War, as they most conduced to his own end. The
Spaniards, fearing least upon this occasion the French might be brought into
the best Forts of Piemont by the Duches means, in regard of the fear she
stood in of her Subjects who were not well inclined to the French; and that
that State should no more in effect belong to the house of Savoy, but only in
outward show; so as they losing the hopes they had therein, as the Trench which
divides Italy from France, they must be enforced to keep Forces continually on
Foot in the State of Milan, to defend it from the incursions of the French,
their contiguous neighbors. The Spaniards being much moved for the said
reasons, sent speedy advertisement of this accident to Spain, Flanders, and
Germany, and did moreover give out, That the Duke was poisoned by Crequi his
procurement, that by such a report they might the more incense his subjects
against the French, who never departing from those Towns, as at first they did,
began to be very burdensome to the Inhabitants. The Marquis Leganes, and the
other State-Ministers of Spain, advised what they were to do upon the present
emergency; at last, this being acknowledged to be a wound, which if it were
suffered to run on and grow worse, all remedies that could be applied
thereunto hereafter would prove vain, they all agreed in a joint opinion, that
they were to do their utmost, as well by force of Arms, as cunning and
industry, in using such means as should be most opportune for them, without
loss of time, and whilst by the Dukes death all Piemont was in a confusion,
and whilst the French had not yet thought of establishing any government there,
though the French that were in Italy sought rather how they might get into the
strong holds of Piemont, then into those of Milan. By command from Leganes, all
they that were in Comasco went into the Country of Allessandria, where the
Spaniards, hearing that the French Fleet was discovered in the Mediterranian
over against Italy, and fearing, lest landing their men they might attempt some
enterprise, Don Martin of Aragon, and Don John de Garray, were sent with some
Soldiers into the Lang he, to look to any incursion the French might make on
that part; but the Spaniards march being discovered by the French, who were
quartered in Montferrat toward that side, they came forth against them, and
fought with them in the Lang he; where the French, who were more in number then
the Spaniards, prevailing, Don Martin was necessitated to retreat into the
Territories of Allessandria, with the loss of 400 of his men.

The Austrians this mean while, understanding that those of Piement, being
much oppressed by the French, who treated them as Subjects, would willingly
embrace any occasion whereby they might drive them out, did cheerfully consent
that the Cardinal of Savoy should come into Piemont, who was then at Rome,
conceiving, that if he were introduced, and admitted to the government of that
State, who was a friend to Spain, and a very understanding Prince, he would
have a care to preserve his Nephews authority, would have an eye to the
sinister proceedings of the French, and that being upon all occasions fomented
by the Spaniards, it would not be hard for him to make them forgo their
quarters in Piemont, especially since the Spaniards were grown stronger, and
the French weaker. By nourishing the War in Piemont, the Spaniards kept the
evils thereof from out their own Territories, and which was of greater
importance, by putting enmity between the Savoyards and French (to boot with
the increase of Forces of the one, and decrease of the others) they hoped by
driving the French out of Italy, to become Masters themselves of the chief
strengths of Piemont, and consequently keep the Princes thereof at their beck;
so as if they could have secured themselves from the power of France on this
side, they certainly would have become very dreadful to all the rest of Italy.
To this purpose the Cardinal parted speedily from Rome, and came to the State
of Genua, upon the Confines of Piemont, where he found himself deceived in his
opinion; for the French protested to the Duchess, that if she should bring her
Brother in law into Piemont, they would turn their Forces against her State.
The Duchess was therefore enforced to signify unto him, that he should
forbear coming further, for she would by no means receive him then, she her
self being sufficient to take upon her the government of her Son, and that
so it was her Husbands will she should do. This answer was very bitter to the
Cardinal, as he witnessed by his sharp rescenting thereof; the rather, for
that he very well foresaw the eminent dangers which threatened that State,
which in other times had been the Theater of Italies greatness, in so much as
he declared; That by the Fundamental Laws of that State, he was to take upon
him the administration of the government; that his Brothers will was void and
invalid, and that the Statutes of that Dukedom were unalterable, which
contain; that if the Duke dye, and leave his Children Orphans, the Princes of
the Blood be admitted to the government both of the State and them. But (as no
reason is of validity with those that will not be governed thereby, and when
there wants sufficient force to compel obedience) the Cardinals pretensions
were not allowed of, but his Sister in Law sent him word again, willing him to
return to Rome from whence he came. And the French, fearing that since the
Cardinal could not prevail by his persuasions for admission, he would
endeavor to effect his desires by the force of Spain which were all already
brought upon those Frontiers, and had caused no little suspicions. Crequi
having now to his no small contentment the sole supreme command of all the
Forces in Italy, (for it is usual with great men not well to brook an equal
or superior in authority) thinking that he should now be able to do some
great matter in Italy, went with his Army from Montferrat to Poma, a Castle
between Valenza and Casalle, near the River Roaldo, guarded by 200 Spaniards,
who not able to defend themselves, forsook it when they heard of the French
men's approach; and causing a Bridge to be thrown over the River Poe on the
side of Brem, gave out that he would quarter his whole Army that Winter in the
State of Milan; but these words took not effect; for Leganes having brought
the greatest part of his Army about Valenza, the Marshall altered his mind, and
returned to Winter in his former quarters of Piemont and Montferrat. Whereby
the Spaniards, finding it an easy matter to take Brem, they had many reasons
to go about it before they should betake themselves to their Winter quarters,
and before the French should receive more recruits from France. But the season
proved afterward so exceeding wet, and the ways so deep, as they could not
without much incommoditie march with their Cannon; wherefore upon better advice
Leganes resolved to leave garrisons on the Frontiers, particularly in Lumello
and Carasona, whose fortifications were not yet perfected, and disperse his
Army in the Towns of that state, with intention to appear in the Spring with
greater numbers in the field, and do that which though it was deferred was not
forgotten.

The face of affairs was changed in Lombardy by the death of Victorios Amadreo
Duke of Savoy, as also by the decease of Charles Duke of Mantua, Sept. 21.
who died a little before the other on the 21th of September, For Charles
having left his Grandchild very young, and his sons Wife, Mary, Governesse of
her son till he should come to be 18 years old, 'twas foreseen that from
hence alteration would proceed* for the wiser sort were of opinion that the
Princess was of another genius then was Charles, who could not forget his
affection to the French; and that the greater part of the Mantoans being
Leaguniosised, and not only naturally small friends to Forrainers, but much
exasperated against those whom they termed the cause of their ruin, they might
easily persuade the young lady to keep fair correspondency with the Spaniard,
under whom they thought themselves to be bettered, when indeed they were by so
much more impaired, by how much a King of Spain is greater then a Duke of
Mantua; at which the French (who through Charles his unadvisednesse were now in
the best Towns of Montferrat) taking offense, some adverse accident might fall
out. Others said the Duchess being but young, and much solicited by her mother
Marguerit of Savoy, and the Empress Ellinor, she might perhaps listen to a new
marriage. And that when the Infant of Spain could get footing in Mantua, and
in the right of the young Lady lawfully keep what he had gotten in Montferrat,
he would willingly yield to marry her, and that the Princess would not be
unwilling to better her condition in these present emergencies, from whence
great troubles must needs arise; for if the Spaniards should once get into
Mantua, and the Citadell of Casalle, there was no hope (though they might
intend to restore the state to the lawful heir) that ever they would take
their garrisons out of such important places. Whereupon, every Potentate
apprehending the Spaniards greatness, they would prepare to obviat what might
prove prejudicial to them, and so those poor Countries would be the Scaene
of War.

Some notwithstanding replied to the discourse touching this marriage with
reasons not improbable; to wit, that it would hardly be affected; for that the
Princess being esteemed to be fruitful, it did not comply with the Spaniards,
that their Kings brother should have children, out of the reason of State of
keeping the government in one only, and that therefore when they should think
upon a match for him, they were to provide a Wife that were barren; and on the
other side they as well saw that if the Mantuans should keep constant to the
French, they should not only be treated by them as subjects, and the Duke of
Mantua's Authority be assubjected to the pleasure of France; but (which was of
greater consideration) if the Spaniards could not bear that the French Forces
should be in Cassalle, they would consequently never be contented till they
were removed from thence. So as the War happening in an Orphans state, his
subjects were likely to prove the mischiefs thereof; although others
reflecting hereupon, and who were not of opinion that this made for the Duke,
did probably maintain that War was little or nothing troublesome to those
who were therein brought up, and that both parties being desirous to keep that
warlike people well affected to them, they should be gently proceeded with by
them both; and being well treated, they might consequently by making the best
of their affairs expect more profit from War then from Peace. But it was not
long ere the effects of such cogitations began to show themselves; For the
Princess taking upon her the government of her son, and being more addicted
to the Italian gravity, then to the French freedom, seemed little satisfied
with the proceedings of the French; and in particular she seemed not to be well
pleased with Monsieur de Torre, who commanded under Charles as general of all
his Forces; for he not able to submit the French liberty to the moderation of
Italy, had by his affability won the good will of many, and almost got all the
Nobility of Mantua to follow his Capricioes; so as basterdizing the customs of
Mantua with the mode of France, his actions were no ways pleasing to the
Princes, nor yet to others, who knew it was not fit to introduce such a
noveltie: So as, as well to free her self from such a spectacle, as also to
enjoy that sovereignty which became her, and which was by this man through his
Kings authority in some sort moderated, as also that by so doing she might
partly show the Spaniards, her Mother, and her Aunt, that she was independent
as concerning France, and for other reasons, the Princess so behaved her self
as she made Monsieur de Torre depart from Mantua; who going to Venice, and from
thence being sent for into Montferrat, the superintendency of Cassalle was
committed to his charge; and the French by these demonstrations growing jealous
of the Princess, and her Ministers of state, they fell to such resolutions in
Casall as shall hereafter be mentioned.

But to return to the Duke, he was well enough composed in the parts of his
body, and no less enriched in those of his mind; for to boot, with a general
knowledge he was easily appeased and governed by reason; his being, borne and
bred up in France, was the cause why he (as all others who naturally affect
their own Country) taken with the courteous behavior of the French Nobility,
by the good entertainment he partook of at the Court, and by addition of his
natural clymat, could not when he was transplanted into Italy, overcome his
nature by art; so as rather then to forgo his affection to France, he incurred
the anger of Spain, and submitted his state to the discretion of their Forces;
which peradventure he might have shunned, and would have been more
advantageous to him then War, if with the change of soil he could have
changed that genius which made him bear so great an inclination to the French:
He had a solid judgment, a temperat mind, a goodness not despicable; he was
given to War, worldly enough, and desirous of riches, knowing, at least
imagining that he being a Frenchman, and esteemed by his Subjects, to be the
cause of their misfortunes, they did not much affect him, which made him not
confide in them; nay his diffidence grew to so great a hight, as he writ
whatsoever was of most importance with his own hand; he had wont to keep in
writing all the faults committed by his Officers, that he might show when he
would make no further use of them, he had reason for what he did. Thus did he
dismiss Parma and Caffin, the two Secretaries of state, showing them their
faults registered; for what remains, he was of good example, had a good
conscience and perfect will, his only fault being his too much love of Money;
he lived ten years Duke of Mantua, died when he was 61 years old; of such a
strength of body, as naturally he might have lived longer.

The Spaniards did above all other things labor to find out a means whereby
to hinder the French from entering into the strong holds of Piemont, 1638.
with which they were as much troubled, as were the consequences great which
did depend thereon; for hardly should they be able to drive them from those
holds, wherein being to be employed without any impediment from Dolpheny which
joins upon Savoy, those Towns would be as it were annexed to France, and
consequently in process of time, the Spaniards would no longer confine upon a
Duke, but upon a puissant King, nothing inferior to them in strength, and
should thereby receive such prejudice, as states do by having potent
neighbors. These considerations causing therefore much thought in the
Spaniards, they at last light upon one of the best and most singular remedies
that could be ^^plied to this malady: Which was to send for Prince Thomas into
the State of Milan, as one who was much beloved by the people of Savoy and
Piemont; to the end that entering Piemont with the Spanish Forces, he should
either by force persuade the Duchess to deliver up unto him the government,
and drive away the French; or else by the adherence of the people, and holding
good intelligence with the Nobility of Piemont, make way for such proceedings
as happen usually upon like occasions. But many things were requisite before
this resolution was to be taken; secrecy was chiefly esteemed necessary, that
the French might not be jealous hereof, and then they were to contrive their
intelligence with such as sided with them; they therefore cloaked this their
intention, and seemed only to mind the bringing in of more Soldiers from
Germany, Swisserland, Spain and Naples; which occasioning a belief in the
French, that the Spaniards would rather use their power then wits, they kept
quiet within their own stations, not moving any whither. But Don Francisco de
Melo, who was already gone (as has been said) toward Cullen, and then toward
Flanders, having notice of these designs, altered his course and turned
toward Vienna, to negotiat there not only concerning these agreements, but to
get succor for the State of Milan, which might be sufficient to effect the
business intended of bringing Prince Thomas into Piemont. To the which (the
affairs of the Empire being very urgent) the Dutch Counselors did not
consent, for Caesar's necessity was much greater then was the Spaniards; and the
people who were continually grieved with contribution and free quarter, knew
the danger of the approaching evil, and murmured that those who should be kept
for their defense, should be sent out of the Empire to assist others,
complaining not without reason of the Emperors ministers of State: Yet the
Spaniards desires prevailing always with the Emperor, it being they that
furnish Gold for the succor of Germany, and do their utmost endeavor to
maintain the Imperial dignity; they got leave to raise other Regiments, and
were in the same sort be-friended by the Arch-Duchesse of Ispruch, who suffered
them to raise Forces in her State. The agreement being afterward made with the
Emperor concerning Prince Thomas his coming into Italy, (who was informed
that the Emperor would invest him in some such dominion as should give him
satisfaction, out of what he should win by the assistance of the Spaniards)
Melo parted from Vien^a, and went on his journey toward Flanders.

This mean while Prince Thomas, who had been advertised by the Infant of the
Spaniards intentions, to give a beginning to the business, thought it fitting
to send the Baron Pallavicino to his brother the Cardinal with whom he might
work a perfect understanding, so as they might agree secretly upon what would
be most advantageous for their Nephews state, to the end that it might not be
usurped either by the French or Spaniard, they thought the occasion fair to
send the same Pallavisino to the Duchess their sister in law to condole the D.
death, he being fittest for such an employment, and not at all suspected at the
Court of Turine ^00 the end that whilst he made that his errand to the
Duchess, he might underhand agree things with those that were friends to the
Cardinal and Prince. Leganes not failing likewise on his part did continually
solicit the Viceroyes of Naples and Sicely, to ship away other Soldiers that
were raised in those Kingdoms; and sent Don Diego Patigne to Genoa to agree
there for moneys. He visited the Count Montery, Viceroy of Naples at Pegi, as
he was going for Spain in his return from his government; that he might inform
him of the present affairs of Lombardy, and so Montery might punctually inform
the King of Spain of all things better by word of mouth, then Leganes could do
by letters. He reformed his weak Companies, and added their Soldiers to other
Companies that were more complete; he sent likewise Count Biglia with some
Moneys to Coira, to keep the Grisons true, who were again tampered with by the
French, to make them break with the Spaniards; he pretermitted not any thing
that might make for the safety of the state of Milan, which of all other states
was most esteemed of by the Spaniards; for if they should once have lost it, it
would be hard for them to recover it again, for that the King of Spain had no
other Territories joining upon it, wherein to raise necessary succors, the
honor of their Army would be lost, and they should run hazard of losing all
they had in Italy. For the Passages being shut up to any succor from Germany,
and the succors from Spain being weak and uncertain, the Protestants of
Italy might easily drive the Spaniards from out their Country, and
particularly out of the Kingdom of Naples, the subsistence whereof, as also
all the Spanish Grandezza in Italy depended upon the State of Milan.

At the news of these preparations, the Duchess of Savoy, who was a very
courageous Princess, began notwithstanding to be somewhat apprehensive; for
she very well foresaw that Piemont was likely to be the Sceance whereon all
the War between those two Crowns was to be acted: She called her Counsel
together, and advised upon what was fitte^^ to be done upon the present, and
did openly declare; That though she were the King of France his Sister, yet she
was Mother to the Duke of Savoy, and that she thought her self more concerned
in her Son then in her Brother. The present affairs were had in
consultation, and very well discust. It was generally agreed upon by all, that
if they might be suffered to be Neuters, and not to declare themselves for
either party, it would be the wisest course they could take. The bringing of
the Cardinal into the government was also discoursed of, to which some were
inclined; for if he should come thither, the King of France his Forces might be
prejudiced by assistance from Spain; and doubtlesly, the French turning their
threats into handsome desires and efficacious promises, would rather endeavor
to divert the Duchess from siding with the Spaniard, and to hold good
correspondency with her Brother, then exasperate her against them, and
peradventure this would have been the best resolution they could have put on.
But there were in it such difficulties, as it behoved them to leave the thought
thereof; for besides that, the government of one so near of blood to the Heir
afforded cause of jealousy, the Duchess (as are all other Princes) being
desirous to be chief in the government, and not to admit of a Companion, would
not give way thereunto. But that which did chiefly hinder the taking such a
resolution, was the King of France his protestation, who threatened that if the
Piemontois should take the Cardinal into the State belonging to the Duke of
Savoy, he would presently wage War with them; and the French being already
masters of the strongest and most important passages of Savoy and Piemont, they
would straightwayes have brought that State into evident danger. They likewise
foresaw, that they were not to ground their hopes upon assistance from Spain;
for though the French should be beaten, (which would not easily be done) if
they should really intend such a War, it was not to be doubted, but that
whilst the Spaniards warred in Piemont, those Towns which should have escaped
the insolences of the French would have tasted the Spaniards indiscretion; and
so much the rather, for that they had not as then any hope to carry the War
on the other side the Mountains; for the French being possessed of Casalle, and
the greatest part of Montferrat, it would require some time to drive them from
thence, and therefore the War would be maintained in the bowels of Piemont,
to the great prejudice of those Inhabitants. They being then of two evils to
choose the least, resolved to put themselves totally upon the protection of
France; and to this purpose, the Marquis Parelo was sent by the Duchess to her
Brother to desire succor and assistance, although this was known to be a
hazardous resolution; for not being able to put themselves into the protection
of France without receiving the French into their strong holds, they would not
be easily got to forgo them: so as either, by permitting them to Lord it
there, the Dukes authority must be lost; or else the Spanish Forces which most
apprehended this neighborhood, if they should endeavor to drive them out by
force, the State of Piemont would first be ruined by their encamping; and if
afterward things should happen successefully, and the Spaniards be brought
into that State, they would have the better pretense to keep it, as the
purchase of their Swords. Whence it is easily seen, what prejudice such States
receive as have Infants for their supreme Lords.

But as the Austrians prepared by all means possible to ruin France, so were
not the French idle in contriving how to countermine the Spaniards cunning,
which they much apprehended; and at the same time that the Spaniards built
their designs upon the Prince of Savoy, the French who confided very much in
Duke Waymers valor, began to lay the foundations of their future Fabric. So
as Waymers Army being much increased by recruits from France, and by moneys he
had received from them, wherewithal to satisfy the Dutch, he thought it no
longer time to keep idle in his quarters, but foregoing them in Chapel and
the Country of Fistemberg, he kept the Fields with his united Army in those
Territories; which caused the Austri^^s to doubt, whether he intended to march
against Bavaria, or else to enter Rhetia, to revenge the injuries done to
Rohan. Diverse were their suspicions and their discourses diverse; but whilst
every one not without much fear stood expecting where this blow should fall,
foreseeing some mischief, Waymer on the sudden, and unexpectedly, came before
Rinfield, which in his absence was again taken by the Austrians; where he
planted his Cannon, and according to his wonted diligence played upon the Walls:
So as though the Town were well defended by a good Garrison, yet it not being
a place fit to resist the modern violences of the Pick-Axe and Mines, it was
not able to be maintained many days without sudden and fitting relief. The
Imperial Commanders, whose Forces were increased by succors sent from Bavaria
and Franconia, thought it not honorable for their Prince, nor that it became
their reputation to suffer such a City besieged but by a few, to be lost
whilst they looked on; mature deliberation being had in the Council of War
concerning what was to be done, it was resolved, that Duke Savell, and John de
Were, should go to the succor of it; they therefore marched with their Army,
which consisted of about 12000 fighting-men, in good order to effect their
purpose: But being advertised, that Speureter, one of their Colonells, was come
to about Lindaw and Constance, with 4000 Soldiers, with command to join with
them, they resolved to expect his coming before they went any further;
Therefore they haulted in Obercal, Schoma, and Lomat, Villages between Friburg
and Rinfield, and by great fires gave notice to the besieged, that they were
upon their march to succor them, to the end that they might be the more
constant in maintaining the Town. They afterward dispatched away Posts to
Speureter; to hasten his coming to them, continuing their resolution of
succouring the Town, and in Battle Array advanced toward the Swedish
quarters. Waymer being advertised by his Spies, that the Imperialists were not
strong enough to effect this design, sent some Troops of Horse, and two
Regiments of Foot on this side Rhyn; and doubling the Guards on that part,
continued his Siege, no ways fearing the Enemy. The Caesarians, seeming as if
they would turn toward La^f^mburg, that by taking that Town, which was not
fit to resist the Cannon, they might become Masters of the passage over the
Rhyn, unexpectedly fell upon the stations guarded by the Swedes, who surprised
by this accident, and not being able to withstand the furious assault given by
the Imperialists, after their Horse had skirmished a while and entertained the
Enemy, whilst their Foot might get under the shelter of the Cannon of their
other Sconces, they betook themselves to their heels, to their no little
loss; for being pursued by the gross body of the Imperialists, many of them
were slain, and many taken prisoners. Waymer having at the same time received
a new recruit of Frenchmen, who at the news of these the Imperialists
preparations, were come in to his succor, being much netled at this blow (for
he was full of courage, and one who coveted Battle) he sent all his Forces on
this side Rhyn, and having ordered his Army, was ready to fall upon the Enemy.
But the Duke of Rohan, who desirous to see the end of this Siege, was for his
pastime come from Zurick to Waymer, being known to be extremely good at
Military stratagems, by the powerful reasons alleged, and which were approved
of by the Swedes, withheld Waymer from coping with the Enemy; he thought it
better for Waymer to conceal his courage, and by seeming rather fearful* to
make the Austrians the more vainglorious, who (it being usual for confidence
to produce presumption, whereby enterprises are oft-times lost) seeing the
Swedes retreat, and concluding thereby that they were not in a condition to
resist, would conceive greater hopes in their advancing. Rohans advice was
therefore embraced, which was, That the Swedes seeming to fear the
I^pirialists assault, and quitting their first stations, whilst the Enemy
should too boldly pursue them, they should by a great Ambush stop their course,
and the whole Army facing about, they should charge home upon them. But Were,
who was an old and an experienced Commander, advancing advisedly, did
temporise, lest he might fall upon the Ambush; he haulted that he might the
better inform himself of the Swedes proceedings, who now retreating contrary
to their custom, made him believe they had some stratagem on Foot. And that
he might the better discover the Swedes condition, and prevent their cunning,
he advanced with part of his Army and all his Chief Commanders. At last, being
abused by his Spies, and unexpectedly set upon by Waymer, Rohan, and the whole
Army, the Austrians behaved themselves valiantly, and had the better of the
Swedes at the first, for to boot with having broke diverse of their Ranks, they
took Rohan prisoner. Waymer at the news hereof gave forward himself in
person on the head of his Troops, and making his way with his Sword through
the Enemies Battaglions, he fell upon Echendorphs Regiment, who had Rohan away
prisoner, routed it, recovered Rohan* and took Echendorph prisoner. And Rohan
getting upon a brave Gennet which Waymer furnished him withal, he, together
with Waymer, on the Front of the Squadrons of the Ringraves and the French
Horse, gave on upon the Caesarians, who being set upon by Schiavalischi and
Calambac's Horse, fought stoutly; but the residue of the Romanists Horse, not
coming in time enough, who notwithstanding made all the have they could to
come in to succor, the Imperialists Generals, having used their utmost power
and valor, and being environed on all sides by the Enemy, and abandoned by
their own men, they were compelled to demand quarter, and yielded themselves
prisoners to Waymer, with the loss of the greatest part of their best
Soldiers, of their Baggage, and such Cannon as they had. John de Were, Savell,
and Speureter, were brought to Valdshut, where they were with all civilitie
entertained by Waymer, as famous and renowned Commanders. But Savell through
intelligence held with some upon the place, and by corrupting the Guard, made
an escape, to Waymers great resentment, who was much troubled at the loss of
this Prince, as he severely showed upon his accomplices. Rohan, who in this
skirmish was lightly hurt with a Musket Shot in the Leg, was much importuned
by Waymer, who exceedingly loved him, to withdraw himself and have his wound
dressed; but he esteeming it but a small hurt, it at last gangrend, in so much as
he dyed thereof not many days after, to the great grief of Waymer, and all
the other Commanders, and of all the Protestants; For he was a very wise man,
and who governing his actions more by his considerate discretion, then by his
daring force, had gotten many Victories. And had he been a Romanist, so as the
King of France might without any suspicion of his loyalty, or scandal of his
other Roman Catholic Subjects, have entrusted him with the managing of his
most important affairs, what might have been expected from him commanding a
powerful Army, who with the weak power of the Protestants had always
maintained himself against the King in France it self? Rohan was a French
Prince, Duke and Peer of France; being bred up, and educated in the Wars
under Henry the great, he attained to such experience, as following the opinion
and party of the Protestants, he was by them chosen to be their General, in
which charge he always worthily behaved himself, till such time as he got the
Kings pardon; He was civilly behaved, courteous in his entertainment, and of a
very sweet condition, which made him much approved of by such as had dealings
with him; He had a sharp wit, was wary in his proceedings, and advised in his
Counsels; He was not proud, nor seemed he to be ambitious, nor were there any
reprehensible faults known in him; He was noble in his expenses, and despised
increase of wealth (a gallant part in a complete Commander.) And when any
discourse was offered upon this point, by any who were straight-handed and had
betaken themselves to the War only for lucre sake, he had wont to say, that
such men ought to be abhorred by all Princes: because where particular interest
militats, the glory of the public keeps not the field; and good will dwells
not where Avarice keeps house; that that soul wants the freedom of
sacrificing it self to glory, which is fettered by Gold; that nothing of
worth, nor generousnesse can be expected from him, who studies only how to
acquire riches. He was always diligent in what concerned business, infinitely
inquisitive after novelties, desirous of correspondency with men of worth; he
used such subtlety in all his actions, as that he achieved his ends more
thereby then by his Forces; he spared not for Money in rewarding Intelligencers,
which he kept in all parts, and affirmed that such were the eyes of an Army; he
was so suspicious, as where he held a bad opinion, he feared even truth it
self; he was of such an impression, as where once he fixed his mind, even
reason could hardly alter him. He discoursed willingly, spoke with all men, was
very inquisitive, and would know every the meanest matter; whereupon he had
wont to say, that as ever herb has its virtue, so every man has his saying,
and that often times that was learned from the meaner sort, which was not had
from the greatest; and he added, that those Princes were of no great worth,
that were not the subject of the peoples chat. He loved, and acknowledged
himself beholding to a pen that could write without pain, to an easy pen;
and he held that those Princes were happy in this behalf, who were reverenced
by an ingenious writer; hereby said he the understanding is enlightened, doubts
are expounded, men's minds are cleared, and Counsels are strengthened; he
thought notwithstanding there were but few that were good at the knowing,
remembering and writing, what they had seen and heard; and on the contrary he
pitied those who were guided by a presumptuous information, by a false
signification, by an ill grounded judgment, for by these Counsels do
miscarry, wisdom is confounded, resolutions are perverted. He oft-times
interpreted things quite amiss, and was so resolute in what he conceited, that
he thereout framed to himself assured confidence; he was so great an Enemy to
the Spaniards, as he hated even those that spoke well of them; and when his
King had not as yet any war with them, his antipathy was such unto them, as
he endeavored their mischief as much as in him lay; and would say that the
Spaniards love, nor esteem not any Nation but their own, so all men knowing
their affections to be feigned ought to hate them; he left no heirs male behind
him, had only one Daughter, who as is reported is one of the fairest Ladies in
all France.

Those of Rinfeild being strangely cast down by this defeat, failing now of
the hopes they had of being succored, and being more and more pursued by the
Swedes, who desirous to proceed to further enterprises did sorely torment them,
they resolved to treat, and to surrender up the place; which insued upon their
permission to march out with their Arms and Baggage, and to be convoyed to
Brisack. Waymer being encouraged by these prosperous successes to think upon
greater enterprises, advanced forward, took Chitzenghem and Triburg, and to
the great grief of all the Romanists, who much dreaded this affair, he sat
down before Brisack, and began to make exact works and redoubts for his own
defense, and to put an end to that siedge. And that the Army might not want
munition, nor any thing necessary, to boot with the provisions made by the
French in Colmar, Waymer chose Rinfield for the Magazine, whether all things
requisite to effect the work was to be brought.

These proceedings of Waymer, together with the defeat and imprisonment of John
de Were, as they were of great importance, so was the Duke of Bavaria the more
troubled thereat, who being a wise Prince, foresaw what prejudice might redound
to his Dominions, if the French should nestle themselves in Alsatia, and
particularly, if by the loss of Brisack, they should together with this place
of refuge have the Passage free over the Rhyn, whereby his state would ly open
to their invasion, and might easily become a prey unto the Enemy; or else he
must be enforced to keep a great Army to defend it, which would be very
grievous to his Subjects. He substituted Ghets in the place of John de Were,
and made him General of all the Forces of the League, and commanded him to
raise what few Forces he could in the Dukedom of Wirtemburg, that he might
have an eye to Waymers proceedings, and use his best skill for the preservation
of Brisack.

Now to return to the other side, the Marquis Leganes, who had provided all
things necessary in the state of Milan, not only for the maintaining of that
Dukedom, but was so increased in numbers by fresh recruits from Spain, Naples
and Germany, as that he had an Army on Foot, able in respect of the weakness
of the French to undertake any thing, not willing to temporise any longer, and
thereby, whilst the Enemy proceeded so prosperously in Alsatia, afford his
enviers occasion of murmuring against him, but so to behave himself that what
the Austrians lost in one place, they might get in another; he therefore
whilst Waymer was busy about Brisack, brought his Army to the Territories
about Valenza, disposed of all things necessary for a Camp in the neighboring
Towns, took some pieces of great Ordnance from the Castle of Pavia, and
provided hay for the Horses; so as all Italy stood expecting what the Spaniards
intentions were; And diverse were the discourses and considerations that were
had hereupon: Some who weighed the importancy of Brisack, wondered not a little,
that at a time when the Spaniards ought to preserve that Fort, which was the
key of those Provinces, and the sanctuary of their subsistence in those parts,
they should only mind the agrandizing of themselves in Italy; and that
instead of succouring a place of such importance with Forces from Italy, as at
other times they had done, they should demand and take men from those
Provinces, the more to strengthen their Army in Lombardy. Others said that the
Spaniards now saw how hard a matter it was to raise men in Italy, as also
elsewhere by reason of the so continual drawing forth of Soldiers, consumed
in so many, and so long Wars; that therefore Germany being of a contrary
climat to Italy, it was a bad business for them to deprive themselves of that
strength of Militia, which upheld the Spanish greatness in Italy. Others
affirmed that the Spaniards did not greatly mind those parts, because they
little feared the French Forces should make any great progress there, as well
for that neither the Swissers nor Dutch were well-pleased that so great a King
should extend his power to their Frontiers; as also that they thought the
people of Bavaria and Burgundy, and the Emperors Forces sufficient to succor
that Town, and they hoped that the jealousy the Dutch had of the French, who
by antipathy are not greatly liked of them, would make them think of a means
to moderate their excess of greatness. But those who thought they could dive
deepest into the Spaniards bosom said, that the Spaniards did so much value
the state of Milan, and were so desirous to Lord it in Italy, as they did more
consider that then all the world besides. For the King of Spaines possessions
in Italy being the greatness of his Crown, and the Dukedom of Milan of it
self, and for reasons of State the most considerable place he was Master of
there, consequently the Spaniards intentions were not only to preserve it, but
to increase it; and because the Spaniards were of all things else most vexed,
that the French had opened the way into Italy, and concentred themselves in the
most important Fort of Casall, flanking upon their Dominions, whereby their
power was much diminished, and the power of the French increased, to their so
much grief, as they were formerly content to see themselves the one
Arbitrators of affairs in those parts. So as not regarding any other interest
in comparison hereof, they chiefly endeavored to drive the French out of
Montferrat, to remit themselves into their former Authority, and to make
themselves be more reverenced, intending afterward when they should be
victorious in Italy, to recover the places they should have lost in Germany the
more easily; for the Dutch weary of the sprightly conversation of the French,
would be readily disposed to remit themselves to their own more phlegmatic
society; so as the French being on all sides shut up within their Kingdom the
way would be open for the Spaniards to obtain their coveted ends. To these
interests were added the Spaniards natural inclination to the clymat of Italy,
because that this more complying with their complexions then any other, they
more willingly came hither then to any other part; where to boot with the
wholsomenesse of the air, and the bettering of their condition, they much
valued the respect that was showed unto them, and the affection wherewithal
they were received. For the Italians, being naturally courteous, discreet, and
punctually gentile, not being able to withdraw themselves from the government
of Forrainers, and of two evils the lesser being to be chosen, do more
willingly succumbe to the Spanish nation then to any other; for that by their
civil and courteous proceedings, and by the hopes of honor and greatness, of
which they are abundantly lavish in all professions, to those they know fit
for it, and whose good will they desire to win, that they may thereby oblige
the Nobility, make their subjects obedient, and their Empire tolerable, they
are better borne withal then are any other Forrainers. To this may be added
that the French not using to impart any of their greatness in France to
Italians, where they are not suffered by the French to have any great Commands,
and the French not possessing any states in Italy wherewithal to satisfy them
there, it hence ensues, that the hopes being greater which are grounded upon
the Spaniards then upon the French, many who are governed by their
selfe-interests are more affectionat to Spain then to France. So as all these
reasons being put together, they are sufficient to gainsay any opposition that
may be made by other maxims. Others also would not forbear to say, that the
Spaniards had always their thoughts more bent upon Italy, when they fared
worst elsewhere; for it was supposed they might hope whilst their Armies were
put to the worst elsewhere, the other Italian Princes growing thereby
confident, would not so easily apprehend their preparations in Lombardy; so
that the hopes that they would not put for any novelty in Italy, whilst they
were engaged elsewhere, afforded them time and means, by which they might
afterward only tend their increase of greatness in Italy.

Crequi being advertised of Leganes military preparations, and suspecting that
the Spaniards designs might be upon Rossegnano, Moncalvo, and Pontestura, as
places which would much facilitate the taking of Cassall, he took his men
from their quarters in Piemont and Montferrat, and went to the Frontier,
intending to disturb the Spaniards. He never imagined that the Spaniards
without greater Forces or Provisions would have dreamt upon the taking of Brem,
it being a Fort Royal, and very well seated, and which might very well hold
any Army how great soever play for some time; there was therefore little
appearance Leganes could do any good before it, and the rather for that it
might be easily succored by the French Army, or they might greatly incommodiat
the Spaniards by cutting off their Victuals: but it proved clean otherwise;
for to boot that the Garrison within were not well paid by the King,
Mongagliard who was governor there, had brought in some French Merchants
thither, who by their negotiations had already erected a warehouse of French
merchandise in the Fort, and that they might have the better vent for their
Ware, he permitted any one to come in that would spend his money. Leganes under
pretense of buying commodities did by understanding men inform himself of the
condition of the place, and having learnt that by reason of the last Winters
Ice a great part of the Rampire was broak down, as being only made of Earth and
coped with Turfe; that moreover the Palisadoe of the ditch was weak, that the
ruins were not yet repaired, that there were but few Soldiers in it, and the
greatest part of them sick and weak, and that all other things that concernd
the defense of the Town were but ill-favoredly governed, he thought the taking
thereof would not be so hard a matter as was imagined by many. He therefore
unexpectedy appeared before it with his Army, 2 hours before day on the
eleventh of March, where Count Ferrante Bollognino advancing with his Brigade
of Foot against a half Moon upon the Gate toward the Poe, he with no great
ado took it. Don Girollamo Sottello with the Spanish Foot took his station
on the neither side; Don John Vasques Coronado, Governor of Cremona, quartered
himself with the Lombards on the upper side; and the Dutch haulted near
Bologninoes station. Here Works were raised, and approaches made on all sides;
the Batteries were made, and the Fort was played upon by the Cannon. Mongayliard
thought to hinder their Works by a gallant salley that he made, but at his
coming out of the Gate with about 40 Horse, himself being bravely mounted
upon a Daple Gray, he was saluted with so thick a hail of Musket Shot, as his
Horse being slain under him, and many of his men unhorst, he returned back
into the Fort, upon which the Spaniards Cannon thundering from all sides, the
defendants began to fear, and were greatly afflicted for that they were
enforced to supply the duties of the Garrison.

Duke Crequi, who liked not that this place should be lost, upon the first
news he heard thereof, made some Boats be prepared and furnished with Men,
Munition and Arms, and sent them down the River on the 14th of the same
month that they might relieve the Fort. But these being discovered by the
Spaniards, they handled them so ill as but a few Soldiers got into the Town.
Whereupon the Spaniards hoping well to effect their desires, they continually
built little Forts at proportionable distance, and threw a Bridge over the Poe,
which they fortified on both sides, to hinder the French from playing upon
Bologninoes quarters. Crequi being informed of all that past, though he had
deferred the succor a few days, intending first to let the Spaniards be a
little weakened and consumed, and that he himself might be the stronger; yet
foreseeing, that if this place should be lost whilst he looked on, to boot
with the importance of the Fort, it would redound much to his dishonor, he
resolved to advance, and to endeavor by all means possible how to relieve it.
But Fortune, which when she will forsake her Favorites, takes first from them
the use of their understanding, and then the like of their body, having for
many years favored the wisdom of this valiant Captain, now taking from
thence that heedfulnesse which keeps it alive, Crequi after having seen how
unadvised he was in not making necessary Provision for the defense of that
Fort, contrary to that wisdom which formerly he was endowed withal, ran
furiously to shun the danger which over-hung his honor and his loyalty, if
that place should be lost, and boldly advanced to discover the position of the
Spanish Camp; he went with some of his Domestiques on the other side the Poe,
and leaning against a great withered Tree, he with a perspective Glass
endeavored to discover the position of the Enemies quarters. A Cannonier of
Bologninoes quarters espied him amongst many other that were about the Tree,
for he was clad in Red, which made him be the better discerned a far off; and
imagining that he must be some man of eminency, because usually the great men
of France wear that color in the Wars, he levelled a Saker of twelve pound
Bullet against him, and gave fire thereunto, the Bullet whereof hit Crequi on
the left hand wherewith he held out the perspective Glass, and on the belly,
bereaving him immediately of his life, and the Bullet stuck in the body of the
Tree, which being afterward found by the Spaniards, was kept in memory of
Leganes. Mongagliard hearing of this accident, desired to be informed of the
truth thereof from Leganes, who civilly acquainted him with what had happened,
from whence he took an occasion to come to a rendition, of the which, his
avarice and negligence had been the only cause. The 26th of the aforesaid
March they Articled, March 26.
and on the next day he marched out with Arms, Baggage, Colors flying, Drums
beating, and with leave for the French Merchants to convoy all their
merchandise safely into Cassall; and upon condition, that such Fugitives in the
same Fort as were subjects to the King of Spain should be left to the
discretion of Leganes, as by name a Friar of Olvietto, named Ponsone, who was
discovered to have been tampering concerning the surprise of Ponsone. This
happened to the great wonder of the Spaniards, who would have been glad to
have lain a month before it, so they might have been sure to have taken it.
The French of this Garrison, who were convoyed by Don Vincenso Gonsaga, to
Fraschinct^o close by Cassall, were not suffered to come into the Town, but
were divided into the quarters of Moano, Villa Nova, and other Towns of
Montferrat. Mongagliard and four other Captains of that Garrison were only
suffered to come into Cassall, who by the command of the Ambassador Emmeri,
were presently made prisoners. Leganes having left 1500 Foot in Brem, with all
things necessary, under the command of Don Carlo Sfondrato, with directions to
slight the Works made during the Siege, and to repair the Fortifications of
the Town, returned to Milan, where a thanksgiving was observed, and their joy
expressed in Feastings, Maskes and Turny, throughout all Milan, as indeed they
had reason; for who shall consider the importancy of this situation, must needs
confess, it was the happiest thing that at the present could befall the
Spaniards, unless it were the taking of Cassall; for this Town being seated
in the very bowels of the State of Milan, opened the way thereinto, and
afforded the French occasion to think upon the taking of Mortara, a very
strong place, and well guarded by the Spaniard, which if it should have fallen
into the French-mens hands, doubtlessely the State of Milan and all other parts
thereabouts would have tasted the miseries of War. By the taking of Brem
likewise, the Spaniards might proceed further in Montferrat.

The death of Crequi was no less lamented in the Court of France then it was
throughout all the King of France his Armies; it drew tears from the eyes of
many who knew his worth and valor. The King himself, and many Princes of
France, did by their countenances witnesses how heartily they were sorry for
it. Duke Crequi was of a gallant behavior and grateful presence, his courage,
and the esteem that every one had of him might be read in his countenance; He
was bred up in War, educated amongst Soldiers, and had his growth in Armies,
and by his actions he showed he had deserved the Character of a worthy gallant
gentleman. His many actions and the many victories won by his Sword made him be
dreaded, and trumpeted his deserts, his alliance with d'Esdeguieres whose
Daughter he married, conferred respect upon him, and made way for the
greatness to which at last he arrived; He lived splendidiously, preformed
punctually the duty of his charge, and managed his Kings affairs with much
advantage; he was of a high spirit, witty, and very advised. In brief had he
not been a little too vainglorious, and too much given to the satisfying of his
senses, nothing of amiss could have been said of him; but he affected too
much his own appetite; he was as well a son of Venus as of Mars, he too much
exposed his wisdom to the surprisals of folly. The fair looks and good
demeanor of every Lady imprisoned his heart; he cherished all manner of
censuallity; as soon as he came to any Town, his first inquiry was after
women of composition, and would prefer his familiarity and domestic
licenciousnesse with them, before any respect of his place, gravity, or
condition; his levity in discourse withdrew much from his estimation; he died
an old man being past 70 years old, and forsaken by that good fortune, which
had protected him in so many bickerings.

The loss of Brem made the French Forces be ill-thought of by the Italians;
for whilst it was thought they would have manifestly endangered the state of
Milan, they on the contrary suffered their strongest holds to be lost their
Armies looking on, and by the running away, and sufferings of their Soldiers,
lost whole squadrons. It fared otherwise with the Spaniards whose numbrrs still
increased, having at this very time received a Regiment of Neapolitan Horse,
under the command of Duke Saint George, and two Brigades commanded by the two
field Marshals, Achilles Minutelo, and Pompey de Genaro, together with other
recruits which were continually made in the Austrian dominions. The French
commanders foreseeing that the Spaniards emboldned by these fortunate successes
would not content themselves therewithal, but endeavor to proceed further;
and their Army being in great confusion by reason of Crequi's death, whose
authority as it was great with the Soldiers, and Kings Officers, so were his
desires with more diligence listened unto. Monsieur d'Emeri who as Ambassador
was upon this accident superintendent of all the Kings affairs, and the Count
of Guiscia, General of the Horse, acquainted the King and Cardinal Richeleiu
how affairs stood, and did earnestly desire his Majesty to send speedy and
requisite provisions answerable to the occasions; and gave him an exact account
of the Spaniards Force and condition. Whereupon the King casting his eye upon
these parts, his intention being that the War should be maintained in Italy,
if not to proceed further, at least to divert the Spanish Forces, which being
assembled in the state of Milan, might to very good purpose reinforce Germany
and Flanders, when they should be of no further use in Lombardy; and so much
the rather, for that without a diversion in these parts, the taking of Brisack
would prove a hard business, which was gallantly carried on by Waymer; Because
the Spaniards who were much concerned in the preservation of Alsatia for the
before mentioned reasons, would as formerly they had done, use their utmost
power and endeavors to relieve Brisack, and entering afterward with the
Italian Forces joined to the German into Burgundy, would occasion no little
trouble to the French in Lorayn; and though some were of opinion that the
Spaniards, though they should not be troubled with the French, would not so
easily be drawn from Italy, before they had freed Montferrat, yet these
considerations being weighed by the King and his Council, 'twas resolved that
greater care should be taken of the affairs of Lombardy, and that to hinder
the Spaniards further progress, the Army should be recruited with Men and
Commanders fitting to manage the War. To boot therefore with the levies
already ordered to this end in Dolpheny and Provence, Monsieur d'Argentone was
incontinently dismissed away with Moneys to Turin, to view the Soldiers, and pay
them their Arrears; and after him the Regiments of the Count de Guiscia,
Monsieur D'Alincourt, the Count de Saw, and Monsieur de Vagelach, were sent to
Cassall; and the Cardinal of Vallette son to the Duke of Espernone, one, not
only wise in politic affairs, but very valiant, and who very well
understood the affairs of War, was chosen General of his Majesty's Forces.
The Count de Guiscia minding the preservation of Cassall, provided for all
things requisite for that Fort; he had an eye to the actions of some of the
Princess of Mantua's Officers, who he was jealous might bring some Forces
thither; he took order throughout all Montferrat, that such as were fitting
to bear Arms should be ready to be mustered, and to join upon any occasions
with the French to oppose the Spaniards; neither was he negligent in providing
all things necessary for that state.

The intentions of the French in the opinion of many foreseeing men were
grounded upon good reason, not to endeavor for the present any further
advancement in Italy, but only to preserve Montferrat, and to injealousise the
Spaniards in those parts; for the maintenance whereof, and out of their desire
of making further achievements, they probably might believe that the Spaniards
would not care what losses they might undergo elsewhere, so as they might
proceed on there, but would keep the greater part of their own Forces, and all
their Italian Militia employed on this side; and which was of more importance,
bereaving the Caesarians of the best Dutch strength, that they might preserve
Milan, and dilate the bounds thereof, they little valued the weakening of the
Emperor; they therefore intended as was held by the speculative to keep the
Spaniards only busied in the state of Milan, and in the mean time to
endeavor by all possible means by winning the strong holds in Artoise, to
secure the Frontiers of Picardy against the designs and attempts of the
Spaniards on that side; And to possess themselves of Alsatia, as also of the
strong holds seated upon the Rhyn, by which means Burgundy wanting succor,
and means how to have it conveyed, would not only fall into their power, but
by the Rhyn they should secure their peaceful possession of Lorayn against any
invasion of the Dutch; And then turning all their Forces upon Italy, they might
not only make themselves masters of Milan, but of all other states that were
under the Spaniards. To effect these designs Waymers Army being recruited with
Men, Money and Victuals, from France, he was charged to attend the perfecting of
his works about Brisack. For though this Fort if it should fall into their
hands, was by established agreement to be conferred upon Waymer in fee-farme
both from the Crown of France and Swethland, (which was done to moderate the
opinion which those people had taken, that the French intended to dilate their
dominions in Germany, as also to satisfy Waymer and make him the more fierce
up on the enterprise) yet they thought that when Brisack should be taken,
Waymer might be satisfied either by Moneys or some other equivalent place. So
as they applied themselves by their art, force, and industry, to the taking of
this place, as that which was to be their own. There were some
notwithstanding who thinking they descried the French-mens drift, did from
thence draw this argument, and consequence, that they should do wisely not to
mind the affairs of Italy, for that the other Italian Princes, appearing not
to approve the Spaniards increase of greatness, they would either openly or
underhand declare themselves for the declining party, and would not for their
own sakes suffer the Spaniards increase of power in Italy; so as when the
French should begin to fare ill in Italy, the Italian Princes would appear for
them; and so the Spaniards intentions being by them counterpoysed the French
might by the assistance of others maintain the War in Italy, and keeping
Montferrat in their own power might the better vex the Austrians elsewhere,
and bring afterward their own Forces in a fitting time into Italy, and reduce
those Provinces to a bad condition.

But because the Spaniards who were wholly bent upon the getting of Piemont,
and driving of the French out of Italy, either were not able to succor
Brisack, or cared not though for want of succor it should fall into the hands
of the French; The Duke of Bavaria who wisely foresaw the mischief that might
ensue hereupon, and who apprehended much that Waymer might obtain his ends,
after having exaggerated these particulars at Caesar's Court and plainly
demonstrated to the Spanish Ministers of state (who still persisted in desiring
more men for the state of Milan) the danger that this Fort was in, and the
consequencies that depend thereupon; 'twas resolved that all the Imperial
Forces that were in Swabenland and in Wertemberg should abstain from going
toward Lombardy, and march to the succor of Brisack.

He therefore having drawn all the men he could out of the Garrisons of his
own state which came to about 9000 Foot and 4000 Horse, mustered them at
Nordlinghem, and under the command of Ghets sent some of them into the Dukedom
of Wertemberg, to drive the Swedes from their quarters, and the rest of them
went toward Friburg, intending by keeping between Friburg and Rinfield, to
streighten the Enemies Camp of Victuals; especially since the Emperors
Soldiers who were encamped between Offemberg and Brisack, pretended to cut off
such supplies as might come from Wertemberg. But the Swedes hearing of this,
and not being able by reason of the weakness of their stations to resist this
Army, they rose from their quarters of Sturgart, Elingh^m, Durlarch, and other
places of that Province, before the Imperialists came thither, and retreated to
before Brisack, where Waymer had already taken diverse Sconces and fortified
himself, to begin the Siege, and to keep it from being relieved by the
Austrians. The Crabats going before as is their custom, light upon some
Swedish Companies, cut 300 of them in pieces, and took about a hundred
Carriages of Victuals from them which they were bringing from Wertemberg unto
Waymers Army.

Mongagliards trial who was governor of Brem was now had in Cassall, and he
being found guilty of high Treason, for having abused the Kings pay, to the so
great prejudice of the King his master, and been the cause of the loss of the
place, by converting it to his own use, he was adjudged to lose his head,
which accordingly he did in the market place of the said Town on the 22th day
of April, his goods were confiscated, Apr. 22.
and a Pillar erected in the market place, to perpetuate the memory of such a
Treason, and for the example of all such as are governors of any Fort, who
when occasion shall serve ought rather to choose death, then an ignominious
Surrender.

The Contents of the Fifteenth Book.
The Swedes are much troubled by the Duke of Saxonies continued hostility. They
summon a Diet, and resolve to continue the War in Germany. The Cardinal of
Valette goes to Piemont to take the Command of the French Forces. He makes the
Governor of Cassall be beheaded to the great restentment of the Mantuans. The
Spaniards go to the taking of Vercelles, and effect it. The French enter into
Biscay, take Airon, and besiege Fontarabbia. The Venetian Fleet fight with 17.
Turkish Galleys, in the Haven of Vellona, and get the Victory. Ghets endeavors
to succor Brisacke, but is routed by Weymar. Fifteen Spanish Galleys fight
with as many French, within sight of Genua, and are beaten. The Spaniards make
great preparations toward Mount-ferrat. The young Duke of Savoy Francis
Giacinto dies, and much of Novelty i^ occasioned thereby. Francis Duke of
Modena goes to the Court of Spain. The Dolphine of France is born to the great
contentment of all that Kingdom. Rupert Prince Palatine of Rhine is routed by
Azfelt, taken prisoner and carried into Austria. Weymar routs some of the Duke
of Lorreyns soldiers, and takes the little Fort of the Bridge before Brisack.
The Imperialists require succor for Brisack, from the Spaniards in Italy.

SUch were the preparations for War made on all sides by the Austrians, and
such was the Elector of Saxonies constancy in union with Caesar against the
Crown of Swethland, as that the Swedes being thereat confused and no less
incensed, they were frequent in their Counsels, and in using all oportune
expediences how to prevent that mischief which they saw ready to fall upon
them; and they were much the more troubled for that they saw the Princes of the
same Religion ready to fall into the same precipice; for they knew that in
policy it was not good for that Elector, but was repugnant to the reasons of
State, to suffer the Sweeds to be driven beyond the Sea; For by their being
Masters of the strong holds in Pomerania, a diversion was maintained, and a
counterpoyse, which at any time when the Imperial Power should aim at the
absolute Monarchy of Germany, would fitly balance, and maintain the authority
of the Electors, and of the other Princes of Germany, in their vigorous degree;
for being in the midst between two great ones, when one of them should plot to
bring them to their subjection, they would presently out of state interest be
assisted by the other; and so being able by the help of the one, to contend
with the other, their correspondency would be the more esteemed by their
neighbors on the other side. The Elector notwithstanding (as it often times
fares with those, who being mastered by their passions, do sometimes wander
out of the right way, and especially when their Counselors being by their
own particular interests made to side with other Princes, sooth their Masters
in what they are most inclined unto) being now as much an enemy, and hating the
Sweeds as much as he formerly was their friend, and showed himself affectionate
to them, continuing his spleen, and preparing by all means to work them
mischief, afforded the Sweedish Ministers of State occasion of thought. The
Sweeds knew of what consequence the maintaining of their armies in Germany was
to the interest of their Kingdom, wherein they now having gotten a great
repute, and their name being grown famous, which formerly enclosed in the most
remote corners of the North, was unknown to other Nations, such an augmentation
of State was of great consideration, the Crown of Swethland being thereby the
more strengthened, and they reaping no usual advantage by the Wars of
Germany, so as they were not to forgo such means whereby they might proceed
how to keep what they had gotten. To boot with the public Interest the
Swedes were moved hereunto in regard of their own particulars. For by the
plunder of those Towns they enriched their own persons, most of them being
but of mean fortunes; and by their traffic in the Havens of Pomerania and
Germany from the like in Swethland; they enriched their public magazines and
Warehouses, bettering thereby as well the public as the private; so as so
specious an achievement, and which was with so much labor gotten, ought to be
by all means possible preserved.

The Swedes being moved by these and other greater reasons, and understanding
how the Saxons strengthened by continual Austrian recruits, pursued Bannier;
they summoned a Diet of the States General of Swethland, wherein the
importancy of affairs being maturely discussed, it was with joint consent
agreed upon, that the War should be continued, and to that purpose that a new
levy should be made of 12000. Foot and 3000. horse to recruite their Armies,
and to provide for all things that were necessary for the maintenance thereof.

The French likewise were not unmindefull to provide for such things as made
most for their greatness, and for the continuation of the War. And they
found there was no more powerful diversion to weaken the Spaniards Forces in
Flanders and in Alsatia, upon which their thoughts were then wholly bent, then
by carrying fire home to their own houses, to the end that being intent to
quench that, they could not so easily run to extinguish farre-off
combustions. They found no better way how to overthrow those Counsels, which
being solidly taken in the Court of Spain, do usually produce ingenuous ways
how to get what belongs unto another, then by affording them occasion of
spending their time in thinking upon their own defense. They knew that to boot
with keeping the forces of Italy employed in the State of Milaine, so as they
could not overrun Alsatia, it was also not little advantageous to stop the
recruites which might from Spain come into Flanders and Italy; for the
Spaniards were to keep an Army in their own Kingdom; and that this was one
of the most probable courses which could make for the good of the French: to
wit, to deprive Flanders and Italy from being assisted from Spain; whence it
proceeded that these being Countries much esteemed of the Spaniard, and not
able to receive usual succors from them, those of Germany must demand aid
from the Emperor, who if he should grant it, the Empire being bereft thereof,
in such case the Swedes progress into Bohemia, and Duke Weymars in Alsatia,
would be the more easy; so as either in Spain or elsewhere the French must
needs prevail.

To boot therefore with many warlike preparations made in Guien, a Province
which extends it self from the Pirenean mountains, to the Confines of
Guascony, where all things were prepared fitting for the War of Biscay, and
the Body of an Army assembled consisting of 12000. Foot and 2500. Horse,
whereof Monsieur de Gramont was by the King made Lieutenant General; the
Prince of Conde was commanded to invade Biscay, and to march with his Forces
with all possible diligence into that Province. And to the end it might not be
believed that the beginning of this war should be the ending, or at least the
weakening of the rest, to boot with the directions and reinforcements sent to
Weymar to put an end to the business of Brisacke; the Marishall Schatillion
was charged to march to the Frontiers of Artoise toward Arras with 14000.
Foot, and 4000. Horse, that he might be ready to take in Saint Omers a strong
Fort, seated between the River Ley and Graveling, by the which the French might
the better strengthen the Confines of France, and open their way into Flanders,
where there being no strong holds of any moment, a great part thereof would
fall into the hands of the French. Which the Spaniards wisely discovering, and
knowing how great a blemish such a loss would be to their splendour, they
furnished it with all things requisite for the preservation thereof, and the
Infant, that he might not be hindered from sending in succor, and that he
might remove the French from those their undertakings, sent many troops of
soldiers toward Arleax, between Cambray and Buchaime.

The Cardinal of Vallette whose assistance in Piemont was very requisite, came
about this time to Turim, and encouraged those who were dismayed to see the
sumptuous preparatio^s of the Spaniards, and the weak applications of the
French. And understanding how the Spaniards had sent the Abbot of Vasques to
Mantua, to treat with the Duchess, and that Don Diego de Scaivedera was gone
thither likewise, he imagined their business might be concerning the affairs
of Montferrat, and suspected that the Duchess of Mantua, who was said to be
more inclined to the Spaniards then to the French, by reason of her
consanguinity, and as more approving of their behaviors, not being able to
endure that the French should appropriate unto themselves the patronage or
protection of Montferrat, and that she should only have the bare Title thereof
without any manner of authority, might have plotted some intelligence with the
Spaniards to free those parts from being quartered upon by the French, where
their abode was not well liked of by the Mantuans, who pretended that that
State should be independent upon any other Prince of Italy, and that the French
should not patronize themselves thereof under the specious pretense of the
Dukes Protectors.

The Cardinal thereof foreseeing the prejudice which might ensue unto the
French Forces, if Cassalle which was the place of refuge for their Armies
should be taken out of the French men's hands; and this his suspicion being now
become a certainty, for that the intelligence was discovered by a little note,
which casually fell from Octavius Montegli Governor of Cassall, and came to the
hands of the French, who had not deserved to be so rewarded by the Mantuans;
he therefore under several pretenses brought many French troops into the
Town, wherewith he drove all those of Montferrat out of the Citadell, took
the said Montegli prisoner, and set a good guard upon him, and immediately
dismissed out of the Town the Counts Iacomo and Rolando Nata, the Marquess of
Langosco, and Father Capriato a Capuchin Friar, and looking more narrowly to
the Spaniards, he was very careful of the preservation of that place, as of
all the rest in Montferrat, wherein having only French Garrisons, he caused
such jealousies in the Spaniards as this was sufficient to keep the assistance
of Italy, which was so much dreaded in Alsatia and Flanders, within the State
of Milan. But all these provisions of the French for the maintaining of
Montferrat and Piemont were greater in appearance then in substance; For the
Cardinal came into Piemont with an intention to vindicate the credit of the
French Forces, but with so small a Militia, as that it was plainly seen the
French either wanted Forces to manage the war in Italy to their advantage, or
that they cared not then for the affairs of Lombardy, having greater business
in hand elsewhere. The Spaniards who above all things else were troubled with
the neighborhood of the French, by which the authority they pretended to have
in Italy was much lessened, knew it was not now time to loose opportunity, but
to betake themselves to such things as might make most for the State of Milan.
Thus Leganes having mustered his Army about Valenza, under pretense of fear of
the French who were come along with the Cardinal, he resolved to betake
himself to the taking in of Vercelles, as a place flanking too much upon the
State of Milan; and by the winning whereof, he should not only bereave the
French of a place of retreat, who being hereby backed, might the easilier make
War against the Millanoise, and did the better secure themselves from being
invaded in Montferrat or Piemont; but the Spaniards should enlarge their
Territories, and open their way into the heart of Piemont, and place themselves
near Montferrat, against which they might with more opportunity take fitting
resolutions. And that which imported most, was, that by the taking hereof, the
French would be ill thought of by those of Piemont for not having succored
them, and by opening their way into Piemont it would be no difficult business
upon Prince Thomas his arrival totally to alter that State, and to bring many
of the Inhabitants to side with the Princes of Savoy. But the Spaniards fearing
lest by the moving of their Army their intentions might be discovered, and that
consequently a stronger Garrison might be put into Vercelles, and greater
provisions made for the defense thereof, so as they should meet with greater
difficulties in the attempt; that they might make the French believe their
intentions were to invade Montferrat, Leganes sent Don Vincensa Gonsaga with
some companies of horse toward Trino, and Don Ferante de Monti with other
troops of horse toward Cassall, and he himself by night on the seventh of
May, taking his Army from out their Quarters, came before Vercelles; where
dividing immediately their Quarters, Leganes placed himself at Saint
Bartholmeo a mile without the City; he placed the Spaniards and Burgonians
between the River Sero, and the Church of the said Saint Bartholmeo, he
disposed of the Italians from Saint Bartholmeo to the Monastery of Franciscan
Friars; and the Dutch and Grisons extended themselves from the said Monastery
to the Sesia; and suddenly a great many Trenches, Redoubts, Works, and
Barracadoes being made by Pyoners to withstand the succor which might be
endeavored by the French, he began to make his approaches, and to plant his
Cannon against the walls. The Marquess Dogliony who was Governor of the Town
in behalf of the Duchess of Savoy, surprised by the unexpected accident (for
he could not believe that the Spaniards would bring their Forces before a
Cittadell of the Duke of Savoyes, considering the good intelligence which they
held with the late Duke) no ways quailed in his courage, but prepared
according to his due loyalty to defend the place, he viewed the men that were
to defend it, which appeared to be very few in respect of the Spaniards, and
of the compass of the Works which were to be defended, as also the Ammunition
to be very short; and having acquainted the Duchess therewithal by trusty
Messengers, as also the French Commanders, to the end that they might think of
relieving him, he made a gallant sally annd took a sconce near a Winde-mill
about a quarter of a mile from the Town, where he intended to fortify, that
he might keep the enemy so far further from the walls; but the Spaniards
being aware thereof, presently set upon him, and made him remove with some
loss.

The news hereof coming to Turim as it was altogether unexpected, so was it
the more wondered at; since it concerned the setting upon one of the Duke of
Savoys Forts, which was contrary to that policy according to which it was thought
the Spaniards would govern themselves toward his highness. For the wiser sort
of people thought that the Spaniards would never have so far exasperated those
of Piemont, as to make them call in the French into their strongest places for
their defense, with whose neighborhood in Montferrat they were too much
troubled. They therefore exclaimed against the Spaniards, and also against the
French; for that resting secure under their protection, they saw little
appearance of their safety, by reason of the French-mens weak preparations for
War, which made them not only fear the loss of Vercelles, but foresee greater
mischief which might ensue to that State: so as the French Commanders were
strangely netled hereat, and in particular the Cardinal of Vallette, who was
more troubled then all the rest, to see the Spaniards advance whilst his Army
looked on. He chiefly considered his reputation, wherein if he should suffer
at this his first entrance into Italy, as stones which tumble down from an
high place are hardly stayed, and not without much ado returned to their
former place, so should he hardly by any ordinary actions recover his
reputation when once in the wane, which would be a great hinderance to his
actions; For it is true, that States and Armies are often times more maintained
by ^redite and reputation then by force; wherefore bethinking himself how to
evade so great a misfortune, he applied himself to relieve the Fort. After
having by speedy Messengers signified the present state of affairs to the
Court, and demanded a recruit of men and moneys from the King, he mustered all
the Forces that were quartered in Piemont, and Mountferrat, and drawing
thereout as many men as with safety to the strong holds he could, he came
between Santia, and St. German, to watch how he might convoy fitting succor
into Verocelles. Which when Leganes knew, who would not be diverted from the
siege, wherein as well his own honor, as the honor of his Masters Army was
concerned, he feared lest the men he had brought along with him, might not be
sufficient to withstand the French; to secure himself therefore from them, he
solicited the coming of the Dutch, (who were continually taken into pay for
the King of Spaines service) and the imbarquing of the Neopolitans; moreover he
drew forth the former Garrisons from out of all Forts, and supplied their
places with fresh men of the country; and by these means as also by
continual making of works and Trenches, he prepared to frustrate the
endeavors of the French.

Opposite to the good success of the Spaniard in Lombardy, Gallas his men who
were quartered in Brunswicke and Alberstat, were as unfortunate; for to boot
with their Armies being much diminished through the running away and death of
their soldiers, Gallas could not go upon any service, as well for that the
Country was wholly consumed, so as it was not possible for him to keep longer
in those parts, as also for want of moneys, without the which the Army not
being to be contented, 'twould be but in vain to bring them before an Army
reinforced by many troops of Soldiers newly landed in Pomerania; for by so
doing, the greater part of the Soldiery which began already to mutiny, would
have acted their threats which they forbore not to make, without any respect
either to their Commander, or to Caesar himself. Wherefore Bannier growing
hereby bold and much more encouraged by a great recruit of men, money and
Ammunition which was landed in the Island of Vsedon; knowing himself able
during these troubles of the Emperors Army to effect somewhat of importance,
he took Garts and Vermond; and advancing toward Saxony, wherewith the
Soldiers were well pleased by reason of their hatred to that Elector, he
caused great fear in those people, who greatly valuing the Sweedish Forces,
fearing lest their proceedings might be answerable to their fears. Yet did
not the Electors council fail in making necessary provisions, they doubled the
Guards in all places of chiefest importance, they mustered their Army, together
with the Militia of the Country, and sent their earnest desires to the Court of
Vienna for their promised assistance.

The Hollanders knowing that the march of the French Army composed of gallant
Soldiers was an excellent diversion to keep those Forces busied in those parts
which might oppose their proceedings, and probably persuading themselves, that
during these the Spaniards molestations, they might do some notable act, they
resolved to march into the Field, and try whether or no Fortune would smile
upon them in the enterprise of Antwerp, which was the most considerable thing
they could undertake; having therefore mustered their men, part about
Nimminghen, the chief City of Ghelders upon the wall, and part about Breda,
they seemed as if their intentions were upon Gheldern, that they might draw the
Spanish forces thither-ward; and imbarquing many of their men at Dorditch under
the Command of Count William of Nassaw, a Gentleman of great experience, they
unexpectedly fell upon the Fort Callo near the Schelde, a League and a half
from Antwerpe, and setting upon it with Petars and s^aling Ladders by night on
the fourteenth of June, they luckily took it, and put the Garrison to the
sword. And their intentions being to cut the Dikes which keep in the water,
that so they might drown the Territories about Antwerpe, and thereby
facilitate the surrender of the City, they passed forward and took the Forts
of Hemband and Trarembacke, and came with their Trenches before the Fort of
Saint Mary; but here Count Nassaw found not such fortune as he desired; For
the Marquess of San Federato coming into the succor thereof with many
troops of Soldiers, and the Hollanders not being able to raise their
Batteries, by reason of the low situation of the place they were on, and being
continually played upon by thirty piece of Cannon from the Fort of Saint Mary,
it behooved them to retreat. And as usually retreates beget fear and
confusion, so did the soldiers show less fervor in their actions now, then
when they were enheartned by success. Count Nassaw notwithstanding would not
quit the Enterprise, but hoped when he should receive the addition of men
which he expected, he might easily compass his desires, which did so
frighten the people, as forsaking their own houses, they hastily fled into the
strong holds, and the Citizens of Antwerpe were not less afraid, strongly
suspecting least the enemy might hold intelligence with some of the City. But
this enterprise containing in it considerable consequencies, and being of very
great importance, caused the coming in of the Spaniish Forces, led in by the
Infanta against the Hollanders, accompanied by Picolomeny, Isemburg, Bucquoi,
and Feria, with other chief Captains of War, who coming boldly on, after a
long dispute the Spaniards prevailed, and being encouraged by the Infanta's
presence, who did by his own example invite his men to fight, and the
Hollanders being much the weaker, and not able to make head against the
Austrians, who came still upon them with great strengths, they thought it best
not to join Battle, but to keep themselves within the advantage of their own
stations, till such time as the Prince of Orange being acquainted with their
condition, and they being reinforced by timely succors, they might
undauntedly fate the Spaniards. For the chief of all other directions which
the States give unto their Captains, being that they should have a care to the
preservation of their men, and not hazard themselves upon any uncertain
Battle, since one bad encounter would very much endanger those Provinces, it
not being so easy for them to raise new Forces, which are not to be had
without much labor and great expense of money; William of Nassaw who had taken
upon him the guidance of that affair, not thinking it fitting time to exceed
his Masters Commission, kept himself within the advantage of his position,
hoping that by his keeping there till the arrival of the Prince, he might
easily have repulsed the Spaniards.

But as it often times chances that things fall not out according to fancy, the
Spaniards falling on without delay upon the Hollanders, who were not able to
withstand their violence, being environed on all sides, and the Bridge which
they had thrown over the Scheld being at the same time broken by the great
press of people, the greatest part that were on this side the River were
either slain or taken prisoners. The Romanists pursuing their victory,
recovered there former Forts, and rendered the attempt vain, on which the
Hollanders had built so great hopes.

The Siege before Brisacke continued all this while, and Duke WEYMAR confident
of good success continued his Works, and Trenches, as well against the Town,
as against the succor; whereat the Austrians being not a little grieved, and
in particular the Duke of BAVARIA, who had mustered a great many men under the
Conduct of Ghets, all the Imperial Commanders were charged that they should
come up to the Bavarian Army, that they should then pass over the Danube at
Dutlinghem, and do their utmost to remove WEYMAR from that Siege. Ghets
thought it a difficult business to set upon the Sweedes on this side the
Rhene, where the Enemies greatest strengths were; wherefore he past over the
Rhene, to try whether he could get into Brisacke on that side or no. But WEYMAR
who was much concerned in the taking of this place, as well in his reputation
as in his worldly respect, being faithfully informed of all things that past by
his Spies, and by some Protestants of Wertemberg, who hated the Romanists, and
Austrians, threw a Bridge over the Rhene, betwetne Brisacke and Brussells, and
was very vigilant in observing the Imperiallists ways; who for want of
Forage, being to enlarge their quarters, afforded the Sweedes occasion to
surprise one of their quarters, and to evil entreat the Regiments of the
Colonels, CORPUS, HOORST, and REIGOTOCH, who being set upon at unawares, and
not able to draw out in good order, lost about five hundred Soldiers and
fourteen Colors, and made Ghets know that this was not the way to succor that
Town; but that keeping quiet till the arrival of more Forces, his best course
would be to try the other side of the Rhene, where he might be much advantaged
by the sallyes which those within the FORT might make at the same time, and by
the Cannon from the Town, which commanded the fields round about. He therefore
rose from his Quarters he was in, and passing back again over the Rhene, he
encamped himself near Offemberg, with intention to keep there, till by new
Orders and fresh recruites, he were made able to effect the necessary and
desired succor.

The Spaniards having planted their Cannon against VERCELLES, and drawing by
their covered Works nere unto the Walls, though they were replied upon by the
besieged with reciprocal valor, and stout sallyes, yet the Cardinal of
VALETTE knowing that strong places are often times lost for lack of succor, and
wisely weighing in his Council of War, the difficulties he should meet
withal, in bringing succor thereinto, he bethought himself how he might
effect his desires by stratagem. To this purpose he sent eight hundred Foot
under the name of one of their Leaders, who were willingly received as a party
of their own, which passing by some Sconces carelessly looked unto by the
Spaniards, they meeting with nothing to hinder them, conveyed about 600. Foot
into the City; Whereat Leganes was much incensed, and by reason thereof,
caused two Coronets of Horse to be be-headed, the one belonging to the Company
of Don Diego Menesses, the other to Vincenza Della Marra. But these being but a
few men in regard of the many the Town needed, whose walls were of a large
precinct the French advanced toward the Sesia, and possessed themselves of a
little Island in the midst thereof, and raising there a great Plat-forme they
played continually upon the Spanish Quarters with 14. piece of Cannon.

Leganes finding that without speedy and fitting remedy he should be hereby
much gauled, and forced to quit the enterprise, he considered what best course
was to be taken, and found there was none likelier to take effect then
diversion. He therefore caused a great body of men to be raised in the State,
with whom to incompasse the French, who when they should see themselves
environed on all sides by the Spaniards, would either be forced to fight upon
disadvantage, or to forsake their station. He therefore acquainted Cardinal
Triuulsio herewithall, who in hi^ absence was governor of Milan, and he being
a wise man caused Proclamation to be made, that all the Militia of the
neighboring parts should be mustered, and that 4000. Foot should be chosen
out of them, part of which were in lieu of the Forreyners which were taken from
the Forts, and left in their places^ that these should join with the other
Militia's of the parts about Lodeggian, Cremona, and Mount-Brianza; and the
Governor of Allessandria having gathered together other troops of soldiers on
the other side, to which 800. Swissers being added which were just then come
into the State of Millan: and to all those five hundred Horse which which were
sent from the siege of Vercelles, another body of an Army was framed, whereof
though the greatest part were unexperienced men, yet were they sufficient to
effect the thing desired.

With these the Cardinal, and Don Martin Gallicano Master of the Camp,
accompanied with a great many of the Gentry of Millan, came to Vigerano, and
from thence by orders from Leganes, they advanced toward the Fort Sandavall,
with intention that if the French should keep their station in the Sesia, they
should set upon them on their backs, whilst Leganes should charge them on the
Front, and so force them from thence with much loss. But the French
foreseeing what might ensue, withdrew their Cannon from the said Island, and
returned toward their former Quarters, about Saint Germans, intending to wait
a better opportunity to relieve the Town. The Spaniards being by this retreat
the more encouraged, and increasing their offensives against the Town, the
Governor seeing the French were retreated, and thereby finding how hard a
matter it would be for the Town to be relieved, agreed by the joint consent
of all the chief Officers of the Garrison to come to a Treaty, before they
were reduced to a greater necessity; For the number of of the Defendants were
much lessened by their continual sallyes, and they much feared the Mines made
by the Spaniards underneath their walls. He therefore sent out a Gentleman
called Ogliacy, to treat with Leganes; Hostages were given on both sides, and
it was agreed upon that they should march out with their Arms and Baggage, and
with three pieces of Cannon, and with the body of the late Duke Victorio
Amedio. All this was performed on the fifth of July to the great rescentment of
the Duchess; who greatly complaining against the Spaniards for their using
such Hostility, whilst during the Duke her Husbands life, they rather seemed
desirous of neutrality and good correspondency with him, then to come to
professed enmity; They by their Printed Manifestoes moderated the exclamations of
the Inhabitants of Piemont, and endeavored by colorable appearances to cure
the Jealousies which the other Italian Princes might receive by this, who are
greatly endammaged by every new acquisition made by the Spaniards in Italy.

The contents were. That the Duke of Savoy had not only joined with the French
to the prejudice of the Crown of SPAIN: but the French being every day
brought in great numbers by the Duchess into the Towns of PIEMONT, they were
come so near to the King of SPAINES Territories, that in all reasons the
SPANIARDS were to secure themselves from the incursions of their enemies. That
Vercelles was taken not to bereave the Duke of Savoy of what was his (though
all things gotten by arms in fair War is lawful) but to prevent the French
from getting thereinto, under pretense of friendship, which would be very
dis-advantagious to the State of Milan. That the King of Spain who was so
great a Monarch of so many Kingdoms, was contented with his own vast
Dominions, and needed not to care for a little Farm of the Prince of Piemonts;
and that they would at all times be ready to restore what they had taken, when
the French would do the like, for what they had usurped from the Princes of
the House of Austria.

These excuses availed but a little to pacifye those of Piemont, who mightily
afraid, knew not whether to turn themselves; for on the one side they were
displeased with the Spaniards, as expecting to have their Country ruinated,
and themselves oppressed by them; on the other side they were but ill satisfied
with the French, for being the Authors of the War, and not being able to
defend them, they saw that all their mischief had its rise from them, so at it
was easily seen they showed not such affection toward them as at the first.
But you may give loosers leave to talk; These men's laments were little valued
by the Spaniards and less by the French, for each of them minded only what
made most for their own Interest. Some notwithstanding, who will not let any
thing pass uncensured by them, said that if the Spaniards actions were
mysterious, the French had likewise their ends in their designs, and were not
less deep therein; For though the Spaniards by taking of Vercelles had opened
their way into Piemont, and had made the Frenchmen lose the good will of the
Piemontesians, and by the coming of Prince Thomas were likely to effect their
desires of getting into the best Town of Piemont, and by bereaving the French
thereof, to strengthen Montferrat the more; 'twas notwithstanding seen that
this might prove but a bait to draw them into some dangerous precipice. For by
the addition of so many Conquests, causing Jealousy in the other Princes of
Italy, they might easily draw on a League against them, from which if nothing
else should have ensued, the very taking up of Arms by those Princes was of
Notable consequence, for it would occasion the disbanding of the Spanish Army,
and make it a more difficult matter for them to raise men for the service of
the Crown of Spain. Since the soldiers partly weary with the sufferings of
War, partly allured by the desire to change fortune, and to get new advance of
pay, partly through the fear which they brought with them from Naples into
Lombardy, and others being called for back by their natural Princes, would
have much lessened their Companies by their flight. So as what by those who
were run away, and what by those that were slain in service, the State of
Milan would be reduced to such a scarcity of defenders, as the French might
easily have flown in upon those parts.

The Hollanders going into the Fields, and the news which was spread abroad in
France by their partakers, and such as desired it should be so, that they were
before Antwerpe, which caused no little confusion in the people of those
Provinces, encouraged the French to undertake the siege of Saint Omers, which
though it were an enterprise of great difficulty, yet was it the easier by
reason of the present conjunctures. For the Spanish Forces which were then in
Flanders were not able to maintain Antwerp against the Hollanders, and Saint
Omers against the French.

They therefore drew near to this place which they very much desired to take,
and employed all their wits how they might effect it. But the Spaniards who
were very much troubled that so famous a City as this should be lost, it
being the key of those Provinces; minded the importancy of the affair. Prince
Thomas took with him part of the Army that was then in Brabant by reason of
the Hollanders new undertakings, and Encamped himself between Duminghen and
Ardres, two Forts from whence the Victuals and Ammunition was brought to the
French Camp, intending to reduce their Army to so great a scarcity by cutting
of their Commerce with those Forts wherein they had placed all their Provisions
requisite for that siege, as they should be necessitated to give over the
enterprise, and the Spaniards might preserve the Town without the loss of
blood, and so it fell out: For the accustomed Victuals not being able to be
any longer brought either by Land or Water to the French Camp from those
places, which lay most commodious for that purpose, and their numbers daily
decreasing by their excessive sufferings and Military Duties, and by the
running away of their Soldiers, they were by the gallant behavior of the
Besieged brought into a bad condition, and the succor not appearing time
enough, which was expected to come with the Marishall De la Bresse, and
Monsieur de Saint Prejule, the French raised their Siege on the twelfth of July
to their great prejudice, having lost about six thousand men before the Town,
and retreated near Ardres a place of great consequence belonging to the King
of France, that they might hault there, and attend new Orders from the Court,
together with the expected succor, which they heard was already upon the way
toward them. But sinister events, whereby the opinions of Princes is
prejudiced, being usually imputed to the blame of th^se who have the mannaging
of the Affair, by such as do either emulate or envy them, Schatillion who had
been unfortunate in the carriage of this affair, though upon all occasions
he had given sufficient testimony of his loyalty and valor, yet reason not
being now admitted of in his defense, he had well-nigh ship-wrackt both his
fortune and his Honor. Had not Cardinal Rechelieu (one who through his
refined understanding penetrates into affairs, and knows the conditions of
envious people, and one whom France may very much glory in) discovered the
wickedness of the times, and the false calumnies which were laid to this man's
charge, whereby he was restored to his former place and dignity, and recovered
the honor he had well nigh lost.

The Hollanders who could not endure to stand idle in these present occasions
of Flanders, molested by the French, though they were much afflicted for the
blow they had received at Callo, and that this unfortunate accident was known
by many to be a forerunner of other bad events that year; yet as undaunted
Soldiers, and accustomed to the variety of Fortune, not at all declyning in
their hopes, but confirmed in their opinion of not letting the winter approach
without atchieving somewhat worthy of their Forces, they resolved upon the
enterprise of Gheldren. Having therefore led on their Army toward Niminghen,
and made some new Dutch Troops pass over the Rhene at Skinschconce, they
marched 16000. strong before that Town, and taking up their Quarters, began to
draw their Line. The News hereof being forthwith brought to the Infanta, who
was at this time recruited with six thousand Collonians brought unto him by
Lamboy, to boot with Picolomenies men, he marched in person thither-ward, and
Lamboy with his Dutchmen fell so furiously upon Count Casamire de Nassaw's
Quarters, desirous either to dye or not to go out of Flanders, as Picolomeny
did after the attempt before Mastricke, and with his sword in his hand amongst
the first Files of his men assaulted some of the Hollanders Trenches not yet
perfected, and after a long and bloody dispute he wanne the Station, and put
some Dutch to the Sword who did defend it. This was reported to have happened
through intelligence had with the Dutch themselves. He took the said Count
Casemire Prisoner, and a Prince of Portugal, who weary of the austere life he
led whilst he was a Carmelite Friar, was come into Holland. There were lost
about 1000. Soldiers with diverse Officers and some Cannon. Wherefore the
Prince of Orange wisely knowing he could do little good by endeavoring a
revenge; to shun the hazard of joining Battle, he forthwith rose from
where he was quartered, and retreated to Capell.

But though the designs of the French had not good success in Artoise, they
notwithstanding prospered in Bischay; for the Prince of Conde having assembled
a great Army, he courageously advanced into the Spanish Dominions, and
unexpectedly came before the Port of Passagge, a chief City in Biscay, seated
upon the Sea, between Bayone, and Fonterabbia, called also Airona, environed
only with bare walls after the ancient fashion, but with a strong Haven
within, to keep from being injured by the Enemies Vessels, where the Gallions
destined for the Indies are usually built; he planted his Cannon against it.
The Spaniards who had the custody thereof, (as it often times fares with them,
who nursed up in peace, and not acquainted with the noise of War, know not
what belongs to an Enemies Army) being surprised at such an novelty, and full
of confusion, not knowing whether to turn, or how to defend themselves,
emboldned the Frenchmen to assault the Town, who with little resistance made
themselves masters thereof, in the beginning of July; which the officers of the
Spanish Court were much troubled at, for besides the loss of the seat wherein
they provided for the tackling of their Indian Fleet, and of many Gallions and
other ship provisions: this business made the Spaniards now that they saw the
war brought home unto them, linger no longer about the necessity of waging War
afar off, but giving over the applying themselves to the Wars of Italy and
Flanders, bethink themselves how they might hinder the French from proceeding
further on that side. The Frenchmen presaging good success unto themselves by
this happy encounter, brought their Army before Fontarabia, one of the best
places the King of Spain has in those parts, intrencht themselves, and ordered
their Cannon against it; whereupon the Spaniards greatly fearing to lose this
place, the importancy whereof was very great, and it being requisite to use all
possible diligence to provide against this unexpected novelty, all the
Stipendiaries of those Kingdoms were by order from the King summoned upon
pain of life, and charged to go toward Pampalona in Navar, and Vittoria in
Bischay, there to be commanded by the Admiral of Castile, who having already
assembled a good strength on the other side, had an eye to the proceedings of
the French.

These preparations grew every day greater, for the Spaniards without any
regard either to their goods or lives, ran to the defense of those Frontiers,
and which served for an out-fence to their Country; and many soldiers ran
every day from the French Camp, who cursing the mountains of Spain, knew not
how to live out of the pleasant fields of France, so as the business began to
grow more doubtful. Yet did those undaunted Commanders resolve to continue the
begun siege, till by the arrival of new Forces, which were a raising on all
sides in Guien, and in Gascony, they might the better pursue their desired ends.

The Cardinal of Valette growing by the loss of Vercelles more jealous of the
Spaniards, in whom he only feared surprizals and stratagems, looked the more
narrowly to the safety of Montferrat, and having placed his men in the frontier
Towns thereof, he went to Cassall; where he found Montegly his process made,
and him therein found guilty of holding correspondency with the Spaniards,
wherefore he on the sudden caused his head to be struck off, and had a
better eye to the Inhabitants of Cassall. Yet Emery the Ambassador of France
was not well pleased with this sentence, who as it seems had promised Montegly
that he should be pardoned. And this piece of Justice was thought the more
severe, for that Montegly being a servant of the Duchess of Mantua's, and
bound to obey her commands, 'twas reported that he did nothing but by her
allowance. This execution, and this expulsion of the Officers of Mantua out of
Cassall, as it was no ways satisfactory to the Inhabitants of Montferrat, and
of Mantua, so was it not a little displeasing to the Duchess Mary, who could
hardly brook that the French who were brought into the Town as friends,
should dispossess her of that wherein she acknowledged no Superior but God,
and which her very enemies by all their treacheries could never bereave her of.
Various discourses, and considerations were had hereupon by those that
pretended to se^ further into a Mil-stone then others; some said that the
Duchess could have wished that the business had succeeded according to
agreement, and that agreement was that which has been mentioned; For 'twas
said that dealing underhand with the Spaniards she had resolved to drive the
French out of Cassall, and yet not to receive the Spaniards in; with which the
Spaniards were well contented, as being satisfied that the French should not
be there, and that those places should continue in neutrality. It was commonly
given out that the agreement was, that Montegli having brought the Spaniards
into the Town, should have dismis^ the French from thence, and that putting a
Garrison of the Inhabitants of Montferrat into the Cittadell, they would
afterward have committed the custody of the City and Castle, to certain^
Swissers, for the payment of which the King of Spain would lend the Duchess
money. So as the Town being taken out of the hands of the French, and yet not
fallen unto the possession of the Spaniards; the Duchess and Duke of Mantua,
would have enjoyed the Prerogative that belonged unto their Sovereignty; and
that this State standing in the midst between two others, each of which was
desirous to hold good correspondency with her, they would consequently vye which
of them by their fair entreating of the Subject, and by their respect born unto
the Duchess should reap such advantage as might make most for them. Others
held, that if this should have happened, the effect would not so easily have
ensued; because the French being hereat scandalized, would presently have
ruinated Montferrat, being Masters of the best Towns therein, and if the
Spaniards would defend it, the event must be War, and the Spaniards would have
done the same thing the French did; for if the Town should have fallen into
their hands, no wise man will believe that ever they would have quit it
uncompel'd. Wherefore since it was impossible to evade war, or to shun the
falling into the hands of one of these two great Potentates, a mischief was
undergone on the one side, and a greater mischief on the other; so as it was
best the French should keep possession thereof, as those who were not so near
neighbors, and were to pass through the State of Millan* before they could
make any further progress; and that it should not fall into the hands of the
Spaniards, who when they should have secured themselves on that side, would
afterward give the Law in Mantua. Others said that the French by doing such
public Justice had deviated from the Laws of good policy, because they might
have bereft Montegli of his life, and have secured themselves from any thing
the other Officers could have done, after another manner; that by doing thus
they warned other Princes not to introduce the forces of greater Potentates
then themselves into their own homes, since it plainly appears they give away
that to the one, which they fight for and deny unto their enemies. And they
further added, that the Inhabitants of Montferrat being exasperated, it would
be hard for the French to keep in that Province if they should fall out with
them. But those who know the interest of States to be of so nice a nature, as
every the least jealousy is sufficient to raise suspicion, conceived that the
French had done very wisely, and affirmed they had learnt this of the
Spaniards, and proved that they had good grounds for the securing of the fort.
For this being that which upheld the reputation and esteem of their arms in
Italy, without it, all their designs would have miscarried. They maintained so
great a King ought not expose himself to the injuries of an inferior; that
those resolutions are always good whereby a State is enlarged, and such
negligence blamable as draws on ruin, that what is taken away may at all times
be restored, but that not alwais recovered which is lost. That it it is not
unlawful to ceaze upon that which not being ceazed upon, causes greater
mischief to him that ceazeth not on it.. Whilst these two great Crowns were
consulting how they might best provide for the present Emergencies, a new
accident happened in the Adriatic Sea, which drew the eyes of all Europe no less
upon it then did the wars between those two great Kings: 17. Turkish Galleys
after having piracied all the Mideterranian to the great damage of Christians,
blown up with pride by their happy success, wherein they met not with any to
withstand them, grew so adventurous as to enter the Gulf, to commit more
rapine, in so much a^ it was thought they had on intention to rifle our Lady of
Loretto's house. The illustrious Commo^-wealth of Venice, Qu^ of the Adriatic,
which by a dreadful power of shipping has for many ages peacefully possessed the
soveraingnty of that sea to the great advantage of all Christendom, gave orders
to Martin Cappello the Providitor of the Navy to provide against the insolency
of these men; and he being no less wise then valiant, after having sailed some
days without any news of them, he at last discovered the enemies galleys, and
making toward them, who when they saw the Venetian fleet, began to ply their
Oars, and fly away, he constrained them to forsake the sea, and to put into
the haven of Vallona a Turkish Fort, whither he pursued them, and did there
besiege them; And the pirates not being able either by force or industry to get
out, they moored their galleys and came to land, placing themselves under the
shelter of some old walls, hoping to receive some assistance from the Turks, or
else that the Venetian Fleet might by Tempest be enforced to be gone. But
Cappello who knew what the agreements were between the Venetians and Ottomans,
wherein it is declared, that the Turkish Pirates must not enter the gulf, nor
harbor within the Forts or ports of the grand Seignieur, which if they do, it
is lawful for the Venetian fleet to take them; He therefore not failing in the
duty of a gallant Captain, and to the honor of our christian faith, boorded the
great galleys, and beating down their fences with his Culverins, he sent forth
many soldiers in armed barques and Schifs to the assault. The Pirates amazed
hereat, forsook their station, and began to fly; and to be brief, on the 15.
of August the Venetians made themselves Masters of all the aforesaid Galleys,
which were al presently sunk, except 2 which by the grand Seignieurs arms were
known to be come out of the Arsenall of Constantinople. This victory being
doubtlesly the greatest that has been had since that of Lepanto, as it was of
great joy and consolation to all Christians, who could not sufficiently return
thanks unto, and praise the Commo^-wealth of Venice, which had obviated so much
harm to Christendom, so were the Turks as much displeased thereat; for as it is
usual with their cruelty, who value nothing but their own greatness, the news
hereof coming to Constantinople, and much exaggerated by the Pirates, those
barbarous people, professed enemies to christianity, exclaimed very much against
the Venetians the Chaimecham (for so they call the Vizier Basha, who in the
Kings absence has the command of the Port) put a guard upon the Baiolo Veneto,
and sent speedy news thereof to the grand Seignior, who was at this time gone
to war against the Persians: who when he heard thereof, being highly incenst,
as well for the loss of his fleet, and the injury received in his own Havens,
and chiefly for that the fautors of these Pirates did by all means possible
endeavor to trouble the peaceful correspodency between those two Potentates,
he was ready to show some great piece of barbarism against the Baiola, had
not his Basha's dexterity diverted him; telling him how that Princes in their
treaties with Princes ought to be Prince-like, and that to injure those who
represent the public, was to violate the law of Nations; yet were not the
guards withdrawn, nor the threats against the Venetians lessned; For the Turks
declaring they would wage war, they gave some signs thereof by inhibiting
commerce, and by imbargoing the Venetian ships in the Turkish Havens, and did
many other things, which put all Christendom in no little jealousy. This news
arriving at Venice was not any ways able to move the groundwork of that
undanted constancy which abiding in the bosoms of those wise and grave
Senators, has alwais made it be known by effects they feared not the greatest
combination of force the world could make against them. To countervaile the
Embargo of the Venetian Ships, they presently sequestered the Turkish vessels,
and the Turks themselves; and not failing in their public wisdom, to weigh
the troubles of war, the condition of the Christian Princes, the formidable
strength of the Ottoman, the prejudice which by war only might redound to all
Christendom, which was at variance within it self, full of troubles, and much
extenuated by continual wars, they those two ways, as the best that were to be
pitched upon in such an Emergency. The one was to endeavor by treaty a
confirmation of the peace with the Turks which was lawful to be done, the
Turks being the parties offended, that so they might shun so chargeable and
so bloody a war. The other willingly to go in hand with the War if the
Turks should not listen to peace. The Bailiffe and others that depended upon
the Venetians, had private commissions how they might behave themselves in
their negotiations, and in Venice preparation was had for war. Thirty Gentlemen
of the best Families in the Commonwealth were chosen to be Captains of smaller
Galleys. Signior Antonio Pisani a Gentleman of great esteem, and worthy to be
General, was chosen Captain of the Galliouns or great Galleys, and to the two
that were abroad were added 2 more newly built in the Arsenal of Venice of a
strange structure, the one of which was under Pisani, the other was recommended
to the charge of Sebastian Veniero, an exquesitely wise, and wonderfully
valiant Senator. All the Forts of the Kingdom of Candia, and of the other
Islands under the Venetian Empire, those of Dalmatia, Schiavonia, and Albania,
were furnished with new recruits of soldiery, and provided of Commanders; And
the wise Venetian Senate considering that other Christian Princes were
concerned in this war, thankfully acknowledged the offers made by the Pope, the
King of Spain, the Knights of Malta, and by other Princes and great men, who
were very forward in their exhibitions.

They sent Signieur Iavanni Nanni Procurator of Saint Mark, a very worthy
Gentleman, and much esteemed of, for his understanding in the mannaging of
public affairs, Ambassador Extraordinary to the Pope: and for the present
they only provided some Foot under the Command of the Marquess Bentivoglio,
the Marquess Malatesta, and some other Lords; for not hearing that the Ottamans
were likely as yet to have a Fleet at Sea, able to encounter the Venetian Navy,
they did wisely to defer those expenses, which being to be shunned, were of
great ease to the public Treasury, And the King being shortly expected in
Constantinople, they would make their preparations answerable to what they
should see he would do. But the grand Signior coming at last to his Court in
great Triumph, he presently declared himself that he would have war with the
Venetians; He therefore called unto him the Bashaw of the Sea, whom he
commanded to get together all the shipping he could, so as the appearing hope
of accommodation suddenly vanished. Whereupon those grave Fathers not failing
in their requisite wisdom, chose Luigi Sforzi Procurator of St. Mark, one
famous amongst the Captains of that age, who to his infinite glory had by all
his actions spread abroad his fame, to be their Proveditor General under the
name of Capitan Generale.

But as Princes speak always boldlyest, when they have their weapons in their
hand, the Commonwealth being now in readiness, and no ways inferior in
their power at Sea to the Ottoman, and mannaging all these affairs to their
best advantage. Signieur Luigi Contarini, a Gentleman much verst in the
affairs of Princes, and who had purchased much glory in passing through all
those first Embassies conferred by his Country, did so stoutly behave himself,
with so much zeal to his Commonwealth that at last, to the universal content
of Christendom, and to the great honor of the Commonwealth, and her Agents,
the differences were agreed, and the former Article between the grand Signieur
and the State of Venice again ratified. And the Venetians to boot with their
taking the 17. Galleys, gained the subscription to a new Article, wherein it
was expressly declared, that it might be lawful for the Venetian Galleys
without any manner of respect to pursue such Pirates as should enter into their
Sea, even into the Havens of the Grand Signieur, and underneath his Forts.

Duke Weymar this mean while strongly besieged Brisack, and by new forces
received from France, he secured the field defenses, which showed he meant to end
that siege with profit; so as what the issue of that affair would be was
plainly discerned, unless the Imperiallists within the Fort, who for want of
necessaries began already exceedingly to suffer, should receive speedy and
oportune succor. Ghets who had the superintendency of the Papists Army
conferred upon him by the Duke of Bavaria, being continually pressed by the Duke
to raise the Siege, endeavored how he might with content satisfy the
expectation of all the Empire. Therefore after having maturely sifted the
danger and difficulties of overcomming the Enemies Trenches, Savell and Golts
both of them Sergeant-Major Generals of the Battle, were of opinion that they
should in good order set upon the Sweeds Trenches; that the most courageous
amongst them should throw themselves headlong upon Weymars Works, whereby they
doubted not but to beat the Enemy, and to free the City, and they offered to
give on themselves in the first rank.

But Ghets upon whom the whole burden of the business lay, and upon whom the
blame would be laid, if any evil should happen (as it is usual to impute the
success (be it good or bad) to the Commander in chief) very well foreseeing
the difficulties which doubtless they were to meet withal, differed in
opinion from them, alleging that Duke Weymars Army was still the same, which not
long before had defeated their Army, when commanded by Were a gallant
Commander. That it was not to be doubted they would hope for the like victory,
for that victorious soldiers fight with as much courage as the losers do with
fear. That it was very well known what a Commander Weymar was; resolute in
what he took in hand, and that he would rather dye gloriously then run away;
that they were not to undervalue the enemies forces, who were assisted by
strong troops of old and experienced French, led on by worthy Captains, and
(which imported most) fortified in covered Trenches. That wise and prudent
Princes ought chiefly to have a care to the safety of their men, and not build
upon uncertain hopes which are often times overthrown by fickle fortune. That
therefore his opinion was rather to endeavor succor by stratagem, then by
force; that he should like it better to bring their Army near unto the Enemies
Camp in good covered Trenches, and then making use of some favorable occasion,
to set unexpectedly upon them. But as all men though of the same Genius differ
in their effigies, so did these Commanders differ in their opinions. Savell and
Golts adhered to their former opinion; which was boldly to fight and buckle
with the Enemy, which could not hope for greater advantage then to see the
Romanists rather beaten with their own fear, then by their weapons, they
approved of the reasons alleged, to weigh the difficulty, and not
presumptuously to precipitate their forces together with their fame; but said
that delay was the greatest enemy to any enterprise, when it is not grounded
upon some great piece of cunning; that bold enterprises were favored by
fortune; and that great spirits were encouraged by the enemies fear. What will
our enemies say (said they) if they shall see us, who pretend to be so strong
both in numbers and in courage, lie encamped and not draw near them? what hope
will our Enemies have, if it being once noised among them, that we are afraid of
them, they fight with us possessed of such an opinion? but what will they say at
Vienna, and Monacho when they shall see the fruits of our fair promises to be
amazement before we see the enemies sword? The prolonging of resolution
profits not, when all delays are harmfull. If the field Fortifications be now
unpenitrable, what will they be, when by the addition of others they shall be
perfected* and that the Forces which intend to march from Piemont, and other
pars, shall be come up unto the enemy, and have made them so much stronger? and
in conclusion, they protested to Ghets that the occasion was now fitting, and
that it was not by any means to be let slip. Ghets finding himself hereby to
be between two rocks, and that he must needs give against one of them; For if
he should keep to his first resolution of temporizing, they would blame him of
Cowardice, and if any mischief should ensue, they would say they foretold it,
and so lay the blame upon him; and if he should fight, he clearly foresaw the
little advantage he was to reap thereby; so as choosing the least danger of the
two, he resolved to be governed by them. Order was given how they should behave
themselves upon this occasion. Golts leading on the Van, was to invade the
Sweedish quarters with part of the Army: Ghets was to follow them with the
Rear, and to be in readiness to assist them when they should be gotten into the
trenches, or if they should be beaten back, to make good the retreat. This
being resolved upon, Savell and Golts on the 9 of August in the head of 5 of
their best Regiments fell upon the Sweeds works, which were with like courage
defended, whilst the battle was stoutly fought by both sides, and the
Imperiallists had they been succored by Ghets, who was more then once desired
to advance with his fresh men, doubted not the victory. Weymar came himself in
person on this side with 4. French Regiments and 2 Dutch; so as the Battle was
again very hotly begun, the Sweeds constantly defending themselves, and the
Imperiallists worthily behaving themselves, hoping still to be succored by
Ghets: and here Weymar was like to have lost his life; for his horse rising up
before, and startling at the fire of a Pistol, fell backewards with him to the
ground, where some soldiers came in, and fighting miraculously between him and
the enemy, afforded him time to get upon another horse, wherewith he was
readily furnished; whereupon going upon a full trot in the head of two gallant
French Squadrons, he charged upon another body of Dutch, led on by no less
courage by Goltz. And here he fighting himself with his sword in his hand, and
by his example infusing courage into the other soldiers and Captains; the
battle grew so hot, as shooting being given over, nothing was seen but swords
smeared with blood, men and horses overturned and trod on by their own
companions. Ghetz all this while looking on, that he might come in according
to appointment, when Goltz and the other Captains should have made the breach,
which they vaunted they would do, advanced not one inch, for knowing that the
enemy had likewise a reserve, he intended not to hazard the whole Army,
unless he should see the Van prevail somewhat, he therefore kept his
station, and would not follow his compagnions. They being therefore hotly
pursued by Weymars fresh men, were forced to think of a retreat, which ensued
in such disorder, as some French troops had leisure to do no small execution
upon the Caesarians; Weymar pursuing Goltz in the same manner, handled him so,
as the greatest part of his men were either slain or taken prisoners; whereat
Savell and Goltz were so incensed, exclaiming against Ghetz, and upbraiding him
with cowardice and unworthiness, as they by their letters to the Emperor and
Duke of Bavaria, did accuse him of being the cause of all their loss and
mischief; Which being received as a truth, (for great men must never
acknowledge to have erred in their Commissions) the miscarriage of their men,
and Weymars valor being attributed to Ghetz his mis-governement; Philip Count
Mansesielt Captain of the Emperors Guard was sent into Alsatia with ample
authority to enquire into this accident, and to provide for what was necessary
to the preservation of that importa^t place. The Romanists Army was much
troubled at these disagreements; For besides the loss of 4000. of the best men
Ghetz had, they greatly murmured against Ghetz his back friends, as if they
had accused him falsely, and seemed not to be well pleased with the process
that was making against him, giving out in a skarpe and bitter manner, that
good and faithful servants were through the wickedness of their enemies and
envyers rewarded with imprisonment, so as the mischief that was hereupon likely
to ensue was very great. Ghetz having foreseen all these proceedings (for he
very well knew that this success, as it would be related by the emulation of
other Commanders, would not only prejudice his reputation, but bring his life
in danger; (for such omissions as prove harmfull to the State are seldom
favorably interpreted by Princes, and often times judged by Justice it self
when blinded with passion) he made his address to the Emperor, with whom for
his ancient services he was held in some esteem, and who he knew had better
respect unto, and did more love his faithful servants, to the end that
enterposing his Imperial authority with the Duke of Bavaria, he might not
suffer him to be injured by the false informations of his enemies, nor that
integrity abused, with which he had at all times served his Prince; offering
willingly to enter himself into any of his Caesarian Majesty's Forts, and
submit to the sentence of his just Tribunal. To which the Emperor in his good
nature was ready to condescend, had not the Duke of Bavaria who was advertised
hereof, sent suddenly an express messenger to Vienna, to entreat his Majesty
not to undertake the defense of an Officer of his, whose faults were of too
tender a condition; and assuring him that all right and Justice should be
observed in his process. Wherefore Ghetz being sent for to give an account of
his actions, was with a good guard brought into Bavaria.

The French being risen from before Saint Omer, and Marishall Schattillion
being joined with Signieur de St. Previll in the parts about Ardres, to make
amends for the last ill success, and recover the reputation wherein the French
seemed to suffer; he resolved to storm Rentij: For this Fort being built upon a
pass of no small consideration upon the Frontiers of France; by the taking of
this place of refuge from the Spaniards, they would not know how to make
inrodes into the parts thereabouts, and the way would be the more open for the
French to enter freely into the dominions of Spain. He therefore came
unexpectedly before the place, and planted his Cannon against it, and in a
short time took it by storm, and the French not having need thereof, as having
other Forts near at hand, it was forthwith slighted by command from the King,
and the people therein dispersed into the neighboring parts; and haulting upon
these Frontiers, quarters were frequently beaten up, and skirmishes made by the
horse of both sides, and the Commanders were very vigilant in keeping what they
had got.

At this time 15. Galleys were come into the Port de Vado with about 1500.
Foot, part from Barcellona, and part from Cesely, who expected orders here from
Milan where they should land their men: When Don Roderigo de Valesco, a
Spaniard who in the Generals absence commanded therein in chief,
understanding that the French Galleys were discovered to be in the Genoan Sea,
and knowing them to be but 15. and a Brigandine, called a Council of the chief
Spaniards, where it being argued whether they should fight or keep quiet in
the Haven, it was the joint opinion of all that they should set upon the
French. They therefore put to Sea, and were little above seven miles from
Genoa, when they began about ten a clock in the morning on the first of
September to salute each other with their Cannon, and at last falling to board
with their swords and half-pikes, the action grew so bloody, as great was the
slaughter which was made amongst the soldiers, and much was the blood which
ran out from the fore-decks and sides of the Galleys; for many of the Knights
of Malta being in the French Galleys, who are accustomed to Sea Fights, the
fight was very hot on both sides; but at last the French prevailing, it behoved
the Spaniards to fly with the loss of 6. of their Galleys, amongst which the
Capitana of Secely, and Padrona of Spain. And taking there of the French
Galleys which for want of soldiers and Mariners were left at Sea, and which
were La Marishalla, La Vanbelle, and La Sernier, the rest saved themselves
within the Haven of Genoa. The fight continued the space of 2. hours; which
being thus ended, a storm arose the next night, wherein the French Galleys lost
La Patrona di Spagna, They are said to be certain kind of boats.
by the breaking of the rope wherewith she was towed, which being afterward
found by some Tartane, and Coraline, was brought to Genoa, having first taken
out of her all the money and goods that was in her, which was left with the
chief Magistrate of Albenga; and which was all afterward restored to the
French, though to the small satisfaction of the Spaniard, as causing strange
rumors. The Spainish galleys parting afterward from Genoa, came to Porto Fino,
to mend the harms they had received by canon-shot, and sailed from thence
toward Ligorn, to provide themselves of Galli-slaves and other things
necessary for their putting again to Sea. This blow being heard of in Spain and
Naples, great was the grief occasioned thereby in those people and Officers;
and they were the more vexed, for that they professing to have the prerogative
and dominion of those Seas, and to be the Arbitrators of all such ships as
sail thereon, they could not endure that the French should Lord it there, and
enlarge their power as well by Sea as Land. Applying themselves therefore to
the consideration thereof, the Spanish Ministers of State forthwith began to
make new preparations. They gave out new Patents for Foot, to whosoever would
undertake to raise them, the number of Artificers, in their Arcenals were
increased; they hired Merchants ships, and were diligent how to repair their
loss, and to put themselves into a condition of not meeting with the like
misfortune, which was prejudicial to that reputation which the Spaniards
pretend to wear upon their swords point. And they pursued their affairs the
hotter, because they feared lest the State of Genoa, being on all sides
environed by the French forces, might in process of time come to some
capitulation with that Crown; which they knew to be one of the greatest
mischiefs that could befall the Monarchy of Spain, whose greatness in Italy
depending upon the Genoea's as well for the borrowing of moneys as for the
fitness of their situation to succor the State of Milan by Sea, if this were
taken from them, those who understood any thing of State affairs verily
believed they would have been very much strieghtned, as on the contrary, by the
friendshipip of Genoa, they might strongly maintain themselves in Lombardy.
Now when the Spaniards had taken Vercelles, and having since then till now kept
quiet within their quarters, not only to recruit their men, and Counsels, but
to put themselves in a readiness for new enterprises, and to see where the
French would fix their thoughts, which was said would be upon the recovery of
Vercelles, when they should have received the succor they expected from
Dolpheny; Leganes seeing how the preparations of the French were much less then
what they were given out to be; for not above 2000. foot, and those ill
appointed, were as yet past the Alps, he resolved not to suffer the winter
coming on, without some further achievement. After many consultations had
between Leganes, Don Francisco de Melo, Vasques and other chief Commanders,
they resolved to go for Montferrat, and taking Alba, to proceed forward into
Piemont, as well the better to secure the passages of the Lange, as that by
means of this place, they might winter all their army in the enemies Country;
and thus besieging Cassall at a distance, they might by little and little so
strengthen it, as bringing their forces afterward about it, before the French
could come into the succor of it, they might reduce it to their obedience, so
as giving out they would take St. Ia, a strong fort in the Territories of
Vercelles, which being possessed by the French, hindered the assembling together
of a great part of those Territories. The Spaniards rose on the 4th of Sept.
from their quarters, and with 10000. foot and 3000. horse under the command of
Don Francisco di Melo (for Leganes was not then very well in health) came to
the Town of Candia in the Lumellina, and here mustering his men, he past over
the Poe at Brem, and divided his Army into two bodies; with the one he himself
came before Poma, a Castle between Cassall and Valenza, and Don Martin d'
Aragona, marched with the other toward Acqui, that he might afterward come
before Alba. The French awakened by this the Spaniards march, called a Council
of War, wherein wisely examining what the Spaniards drift might be, and
considering upon fitting remedies, some were of opinion, that leaving a
convenient Garrison in Cassall, the main body of the army should immediately
march toward Alba, and endeavor to light upon the Spaniards, whilst thus
disjoined, which when they should have beaten, they should have so weakened the
rest of the Spaniards, as they might afterward freely keep the fields, and
look to the preservation of Alba, a place at this time of great importance; for
if they should once have gotten this, they might easily afterward bring their
army before Carmagneola, a Fort in Piemont, between the Poe and Tanare, from
whence succor might be brought to Montferrat, so as if they should likewise
become Masters thereof, they possessing Asty, Verna, and Trino, should almost
have environed Cassall; which being in midst the Spanish forces, and not so
easily to be succored by the French, it might at last be enforced to yield.
But the Duke of Candalle being otherwise minded, and being therein seconded by
his brother the Cardinal of Valette, and by Count Guiscia 'twas concluded, that
Alba not being then in any danger, as well provided of all things, they should
go to disturb the Spaniards designs, on the other side, and to scour the
country; for when they should once have beaten these (as it would not be hard
to do, since they were disjoined) they might easily afterward dispatch the
rest. Whereupon the French came part of them to Trino, and part to Pontestura,
and throwing a bridge over the Sesia, they presently came upon the Territories
of Lomellino, with intention to force out the Spanish army; and if they might
not fight with them upon advantage, they might at least for want of victuals
and forage compel them to abandon their design. But this advice availed not,
for being infested on all sides by the Garrisons of Lumello and Carasona, and
being reduced to great necessity of victuals, particularly wanting forage for
their horse, wherein their greatest strength consisted, they quit their design,
and returned to their former quarters. The Spaniards the mean while assaulted
Poma, and took the Town by storm, whereupon the Castle afterward yielded upon
discretion; and the Spaniards knowing of how little vantage it would be to them
to have this place to retreat unto, they undermyned it, and gave fire unto the
Mine, which wrought so well, as that all the walls thereof were blown into the
air, and thrown down. They then went all from thence toward Aich, there to
take fitting resolutions upon the present Emergencies. Oxesternes arrival at
this time in Pomerania with a great strength of men raised in Swabenland,
Livonia, and elsewhere, made Bannier begin to hope well again, who for want of
men had receded many Leagues from Gallasse; so as mustering his soldiers
together who were dispersed in the neighboring quarters, he appeared in the
field, not so much out of his being well armed, and provided of all things
necessary as out of a desire to fight, and recover any reputation he might be
conceived to have lost. Whereupon Gallasse finding how troublesome a matter it
would be to lie in the fields, in those parts impoverished through long wars,
and yet not daring to quit his quarters for fear his soldiers should mutiny
for want of money; Bannier had opportunity to assault Volghast, and to take it,
which he luckily did. He afterward with his horse which were led on by
Tortenson, advanced too near the Imperiallists quarters, with who^ he had
diverse skirmishes, for it behoved Gallasse much against his will to retreat as
far as Volbery toward Elbis, for he foresaw he was likely to reap but little
good by that War, since the Sweedes were recruited in all parts, and the
Imperiallists every where lesned. To boot with these defaults which hindered him
from proceeding on accordingly as he had hoped, he was much grieved for the
death of Lelio Pompey an Italian Gentleman of Verona by birth, who had by many
Princes been very well esteemed of, as well in peace as war. The Sweeds being the
more encouraged by this retreat of Gallasse, came before Dimmin, of which,
after many Cannon-shot, and three fierce assaults, they made themselves
Masters; Wherefore Bannier marched cheerfully on toward Landsperg, by the
winning whereof, the way was opened into Saxony, and the Country of Magdeburg,
whether the Sweed did desire to come to take revenge for the injuries they had
received from that Elector.

Whilst nothing but War was heard of on all sides in Montferrat, each party
being prepared as well for defense as offense, the French expecting supplies
from France, and the Spaniards the like from Naples, Spain, and Germany;
Francisco Giacintho, the young Duke of Savoy seized on by a violent Fever,
dyed on the third of October, whose death as it bore along with it weighty
consequences, so were not the effects which were thereby foretold by our
curious newes-mongers late in their arrival, for there being none left of the
Issue of Victorio Amedio, save one Infant Prince named Charles Emanuel, but
five years old, of a weak constitution of body, and who was at this time sick
of the small pox (a disease which reigned much that year) 'twas easily
foreseen that if he should sail, great troubles would arise concerning the
succession, for the government falling upon the Prince Cardinal, and he
having of late declared himself to adhere to the Spanish faction, it would
ensue, that upon this occasion the French would never tolerate a Prince in
this State which should be independent upon them; so as keeping the Towns in
their own possession, and not suffering the lawful Prince to be introduced, it
would fall out, that the Subjects being well affectionate to their natural
Princes, and incensed by the Spaniards against the French, the War must needs
grow greater, which would produce bloody events. The Spaniards therefore, who
as has been already said, has formerly laid great foundations upon the
coming of the Prince Cardinal, and Prince Thomas knowing this to be a fitting
occasion, sent presently for the Cardinal from Rome, for that being by means
of their Forces brought into Piemont, he might the better be prepared to take
possession of his right, in case his other Nephew should dye. The Spaniards
invited him hereunto out of greater hopes, for that they knew the Inhabitants
of Piemont were not very well satisfied with the French after the taking of
Vercelles, because in steed of defending them, and helping them to recover what
they had lost, they seemed rather desirous to possess themselves of all the
rest that belonged to the Duke of Savoy, pretending not to confide in the
people, and to have some caution of their good in their hands. The Spaniards
who were still careful to maintain their Crown in its greatness (for they knew
what advantage did accrue unto them by the dependency of Foreign Princes) and
endeavoring all means whereby they might reap any good after their accustomed
fashion of civility, endeavored to correspond in gratitude, to the
satisfaction they had received from Francis Duke of Modena, a wise Prince, and
very affectionat to the Crown of Spain, whose good correspondency his Highness
out of reason of State thought requisite, for besides the great advantage which
those of Modena gat by their commerce with the State of Milan, it may be added,
that confining upon the Pope, between whom and the Dukes of Modena, there was
never any great inwardness since the loss of Ferrara. To boot then with what
was already done, for the Emperor had already invested him in Corraggio, a
Town in the heart of the Country of Modena, and by all other friendly
demonstrations, made him know what valuation his most Catholic Majesty put
upon him.

He was under various pretenses invited to the Court of Spain, and more
particularly, for that the Queen being great with child, was ready to lie
down; the King the more to win his friend-ship would have him to be Godfather
to his child, yet this was but a pretense, to hide the true occasion which was
not so easily seen by all men; for the emulation being very great between the
Spanyard and the French, they could not digest that demonstration of
obsequiousness of the Duke of Parma to the King of France, whilst he went to
visit him at Paris, without the like coming of another Italian Prince to
Madrid, that it might be known that if Parma did depend upon France, others did
side with Spain. The Duke of Modena therefore being a sprightly Prince, and
well inclined to make this voyage, that he might see new Countries, and receive
honors and profitable terms for his State, which he could not choose but do
from so great a King; went to the Court of Spain where he was received with
greater magnificency then ever was any Prince of Italy. Those who see far into
State-affaires, affirmed that this the Spaniards civility proceeded from the
need they had both of his person, and state, and therefore they said they had
brought him into Spain, with an intention of giving him the chief command of
his Majesty's Forces against the French in those kingdoms; the which they did
not only to obleige that Prince unto their pay, but that they might have out
of his Country which was very populous, as many soldiers as they could, to
make use of them in their own kingdoms. It was also reported that the Spanish
Ministers of State thought to make a change with this Duke, and to give him the
Kingdom of Sardinia for his Dukedom of Modena, which would have been a very
good change for the Spaniard, for augmenting the State of Millan by the
addition of that of Modena, and becoming on this side also the Popes
neighbors, they would have heightened their authority in the Court of Rome; and
the Duke of Parma bound up between the Country of Cremona, and Modena, would
have been enforced to depend upon Spain; and by how much the Spaniards power
increased in Italy, so much did the power of the Italian Princes lessen; and
Sardinia being but a barren Island, and in a clymat almost unknown to the
Italians, the Spaniards would have lost but little by loosing it. But the Duke
being wise, and no ways wrought upon by these the Spaniards fetches, but
answering their Civilities with as much courtesy, thanked his Majesty for the
honors he had received, and took his leave of the Court, the King having
notwithstanding declared him to be his General of his Navy at Sea, that by that
title he might keep him as a servant to that Crown. The Duke came by gally to
Genoa to the great contentment of his Subjects, who by his absence, and because
of the report that he was to change his State for Sardinia were much sadded.
And his Council not thinking it fit for him to deny the raising of 2000. men
out of his Dukedom, to the King of Spain, who had shown so much affection to
his Highness, it was concluded it should be done, that he might thereby witness
his gratitude to his Majesty of Spain, for the honors he had received from
him; yet were not the Spaniards suffered to carry away full 2000. men, for that
the reason of State shows that Principalities may be termed poor, which are
poor in Subjects. The French all this time continued their siege of
Fonterabbia, which as it made much for their affairs, so was it very
prejudicial to the Spaniards, since great consequences arising from the loss
of this place, all the neighboring parts would have run hazard of falling under
the dominion of the French. Therefore the Admiral of Castile with an army that
he had got together, prepared to assail the enemies Camp. The which he did on
the 7. of September, and obtained his ends; For the French who were before the
Town being much lessened in their numbers, and who were desirous to tarry no
longer where they suffered so much, did not behave themselves according to
their accustomed valor. And though the Prince of Conde, and other chief
Commanders behaved themselves with such courage, as becomes men that are
ambitious of glory, and did endeavor to withstand the Spaniards, yet were they
not able to do it; for the soldiers villified rather with their being there
enclosed, then by their enemies valor were so confused, and fought so coldly,
as they were fain to raise the siege, which was joyful news to the Spaniards,
and as unpleasing to the French, and in particular to the King; who not
thinking that Conde had behaved himself answerable to the expectation that was
had of him, the Prince began to be ill thought of at Court; though when the
business was maturely scand, those lost their first impressions, who
immediately surprised at the appearance of evil, stop their ears, and will
not let in truth. But if the French were sad for their no better success
before Fonterabbia, the Dolphins birth, which was on the fifth of September,
caused such joy among them, and gave such general contentment throughout all
France, as they every where expressed such Jubilies and rejoycings, as it very
well became them to do, for so great a blessing from God. They who by reason of
their Queens barrenness for the space of 22. years, had given over all hopes
of seeing any Issue by their King, and who therefore much feared the mischief
that might befall the Crown by change of Successor, in an instant cleared up
their countenances, and were greatly consolated at this so great mercy from
Heaven. The King being piously given, threw himself upon his knees before a
Crucifix, and humbly returned thanks and acknowledgments to God Almighty for
his so great goodness toward him. The Duke of Orleans, who till now was in
nature of the Kings Eldest Son, next heir unto the Crown, came in all have, and
with great respect unto the King, and humbly acknowledging the Dolphin, begged
of his Majesty that as he had hitherto held him for his son, his Majesty would
now love him as his Cadet. The King taking him up in his arms and embracing
him, witnessed his neernesse of blood, and the tenderness of his affection.
All France was full of jollity, as they expressed by their voices, gestures,
and actions; bon-fires abounded every where. In brief, as Mariners are
comforted by the change of a cross wind, into a favorable gale, so did this
sterrility being turned to fruitfulness, make the French rejoice, wherein such
as depended on them did share, but their enemies were hereat displeased.

The near relation the Prince Elector has to our K. of England will plead my
pardon if I presume to say here that I have a narration of this battle, which was
given me in Latin by one who was present in the action, which I find to di^^er
from this in the number of men, said to have been received from England in the
assignment over of Osn^pruch and Myndel, in the number of the slain, and in
particular of those of the English Nation.
The Count Palatine of Rhene (whom my Author must give me leave to call Prince
Elector) had at this time, what with 4000. Foot from England, and other forces,
which by moneys from the King of England he had raised, Colonel Kings men
being likewise therein comprehended, who was Sergeant Major General of the
Sweedish army, and who had orders to join with the Prince Elector about
Munster, got together a body of men amounting to about 10000. wherewith he was
advised by his Captaints and friends to join with Melander General of the
Hassian Forces, which after the Lansgraves death continued still in service of
the Crown of Swethland; that so during the Emperors being held in play by the
Sweeds and French, he might by way of arms enter into the Palatinate, and
recover that which being so often put for, and desired of the Emperor, was still
denied, or at least fruitlesly deferred. But before their undertaking any
greater business, 'twas adjudged fit by men of understanding, not to leave any
Towns behind their backs which were possessed by those of the League, since
thereby they might easily bring the Imperiallists to great scarcity of
victuals, if their Army should unadvisedly engage it self. The Prince Elector
therefore by the disbursment of some moneys, got Asnapruch and Mindell to be
assigned over to him by the said King, to the end he might have places to
retreat unto when he should lie with his army in the fields in those
Provinces, so as it seemed he began to proceed on fortunately in those parts.
But Azfelt being solicited from Vienna, to have an eye to the proceedings of
these new Forces, and the rather for that the Elector of Men's, and other
Ecclesiastical Princes had very earnestly desired, and accompanied these their
desires with protestations, that the War might not be suffered to be made upon
their Territories, he came thither and made toward these new soldiers with
about 8000. good men drawn out of Garrisons, whose places he supplied with new
men taken out of the Arch-bishopricke of Cullen. The Prince Elector being
therefore brought to great scarcity of victuals, and not able to endure that
his men should perish as they daily did through discommodiousness, which was
very prejudicial to the English, (who taken from the commodiousness of their
own country, are usually at their first entrance more sensible of sufferings in
the field, then are other Nations) resolved to fight, whereunto he was also
enticed by his Captains, who troubled that they should find their hopes fail
them, desired rather to hazard their lives in atchieving an honorable victory,
then poorly to die through sufferings. Both the armies joined therefore
together in battle between the Vesser, and the County of Osnapruch, on the 18.
of October, where the Prince Electors soldiers being new professors of War,
and their Commanders no less unexperienced, they retreated so confusedly at the
first going off of the Canon, as being pursued by the Imperiallists horse, and
on all sides environed by the enemy, (who helped their victory by the seeming
appearances of more Colors) those who saved themselves not by flight, were
either slain or taken prisoners, amongst which Prince Rupert Count Palatine of
Rhene, and br^ther to the Elector was one, who was with a good guard carried
prisoner to the Castle of Lynts; there died in this action about 4000. of the
Prince Electors men, and 800. Imperiallists. Sergeant-Major-generall King, and
the Elector saved themselves by swimming, and got into Mindem, many prime
Gentlemen of England were slain, and some taken prisoners.

This victory, though it were not of much moment, as some would have it to be,
for by this the nests were not destroyed from whence new troubles were to be
expected, and it would rather serve for a further incitement to the King of
great Brittan, to proceed against the Austrians; yet howsoever who shall
consider the business, and knows what advantage the States of the Roman
Catholics received by the securing of those Forts, and the reputation of their
arms, will find it to be greater then it appeared to be. For besides the
freeing of the Ecclesiastical Provinces from the fear they stood in of those
forces, great was the consequence of the recovery of those places, which whilst
possessed by the Protestants, kept the neighboring Inhabitants in continual
agitation, and made the widow of the late Landsgrave strong in her adherence to
the Sweedish party. The Austrians and Ecclesiastics did therefore by public
thanksgiving, witness the content they received hereby. The King of Poland was
likewise hereat well pleased; for his brother Prince Casamire being some
months before taken prisoner by the French at Bucary upon the Coast of
Provence, as he was going in a Galley from Genoa to the Court of Spain about
some business, and from thence carried to the Boys St. Vincent, he thought this
Count Palatine would be a fitting change for the said Prince Casamire. Azfelt
after having taken Vecht, went to the taking in of Osnapruch, which in a few
days accepted of Laws from the Conqueror.

To thwart the succesfull proceedings in these parts, Duke Weymar, who
gallantly surrounded Brisacke, did in part recover what those of his faction
had lost in the Prince Electors business; for receiving advertisement how that
7. Imperial Regiments led on by Charles Duke of Loreine, Bossompier, and
Mercy, being come from Burgondy, were upon their march toward Tan, that they
might fall down from thence and join with the other Austrians on this side the
Rhene, and so jointly endeavor that succor which Ghetz failed in; he
presently parted from his Camp before Brisack with 6000. commanded men, six
pieces of Cannon, and 4. Cariages of Ammunition, and went to meet with the
Lorreyners between Vsfholph and Senhaim, where he in person boldly set upon a
squadron of horse led on by Mercy, after an obstinate fight, wherein Mercy with
his sword in hand did no less gallantly behave himself, then did Weymar,
Mercyes horse was killed under him, and in his retreat the courage of the
Caesarians seemed also somewhat to give back; Weymar pursued them closely, and
though he had received a slight hurt, for which his men desired him to
withdraw, he by no means would give back, but growing more incensed by the
sight of his own blood, he charged upon the Front of the enemies horse, and
made them turn back, and then pursuing them behind, did great execution upon
them. Greater peradventure would the mischief have been, had not a great
battaglion of foot commanded by Bossompiere, and placed in a convenient place,
stayed the Sweedes in their pursuit by hailing down musket shot amongst them;
for it behoving Weymar to hault here, lest he might be engaged in some
dangerous encounter, the Imperiallists had time to retreat, and assembling
together again under the shelter of those musketeers, to fight vigorously:
but this availed them but a little; For Colonel Rose advancing with the rest
of the horse and 1500 choice foot, whilst the Imperial foot and the Sweeds
foot were here fighting, Weymar with his horse charged furiously upon the Duke
of Lorreyns Squadrons, and routed them, putting many of them to the sword, so
as the Imperial foot being environed on all sides, they were all either slain
or taken prisoners, save some few of the rear who saved themselves by flight;
they lost their baggage, their Cannon, Bossompier and some other Commanders of
account, and about 1500. soldiers. To second this happy encounter, Smitbery
hearing thereof, who commanded the Camp on the other side of the Rhene before
Brisacke, he valiantly assaulted the little Fort before the bridge, and after a
long dispute took it by storm. So as the Town being besieged on all sides, and
brought to great streits, and not being to be relieved on any side, the Spanish
Ministers of State were earnestly desired from those of Caesar's Court to send
suddenly a flying squadron of between six and 8000. soldiers from the State
of Millan into Alsatia, thereby to relieve this place wherein their common
interests were so much concerned: but these their entreaties could not prevail
with the Spaniards; For though they were very much grieved that Brisacke should
be lost, they more valued the State of Millan then all Alsatia; neither did
they think it fitting to remove in a season so near winter; For besides that
they were likely to lose many men in their march by hardness, and by flight
(for the Italians being made wary by former examples, do not willingly pass the
mountains) they greatly feared to loose that reputation which the Spaniards do
with such punctuality cherish, if the business should not succeed according to
their desires, as they much doubted it would not. Their answer therefore was
fair in words and appearances, but short in effects.

The Contents of the Sixteenth Book.
The Cardinal of Savoy comes to the confines of Piemont, that by the
assistance of Spain he may enter into that state. He endeavors to surprise
Asti; but in vain the Duchess, and the French are very jealous, and suspect
the Inhabitants. Brisack after a long seidge being brought to extremity, is
yealded to Weymar. The Sweeds being reinforced, advance, and make diverse
atcheevements. Prince Thomas of Savoy comes from Flanders, is received by the
Spaniards, and after many consultations, he enters Piemont with the Spanish
forces, and atcheeves many things. The Spaniards under the command of Don
Martine, d' Aragona go to before Chengio, they take it, and Don Martine is
slain. The Duchess of Savoy much troubled at the proceedings of the Princes
her brethren in Law, takes in the French to guard Turine, and the Citadel
there, and imprisoneth diverse confederates of the said Princes, By means of
these forces the people of Piemont are much confused, many jealousies arise
between the Spanish Ministers of State, and those of the Emperor, but they
are covertly hus^t up. The King of France makes exceeding great preparations
toward Artoise; beseidgeth Theonuille, Hesden, and Salsa, in Spain, and
Salins in Burgondy, Marcini with the Caesarians opposes Bannier but is routed,
The Spaniards march to before Turin, and, and luckly take it by storm. The
French retake Chinas; their other proceedings in Italy. Duke Longeville comes
into Piemont to assist the Cardinal De Vallette, Picolomeni succors Theonuille
and routes the French; taking Monseiur de Fischieres prisoner, Hesden, Salsa,
and Salins yield unto the King of France. Duke Weymar dies at Newrenberg upon
the Rh^ne. Turin is surprised through intelligence by Prince Thomas. The
Frenchmen from the Cittadell offend the City very much, great mortallity ensues
on both sides: A truce is concluded for fourscore days.

THE Cardinal of Savoy parting from Rome, upon the hopes and great promises
made unto him by the Spaniards, returns to the Frontiers of Piemont, thinking
that being now nearer to the succession, the subjects would the easiler be
brought to desire him to be near them, so to shun in case the young Duke
should dye those dangerous occurrences which use to happen through such
confusions: particularly the state being between the forces of two great
Potentates, upon these informations Leganes who at this very time was confirmed
in the government of Millan, Don Francisco di Melo, who as it was thought
should have the charge thereof committed unto him, being destined to be
Viceroy of Cicely. Thinking it now time to try occasions, and to make
experience of the offers that those made who depended upon the Cardi^all, went
with his forces toward the parts of Allessandria, and being come together with
Melo, Spinola, the Lord high Chancellor, Aragon, and Vasques, into Icqui not
far from Alessan^ria, many counsels were there held with the Cardinal of
Savoy, the result whereof was, that his highness making use of the Spanish
forces should endeavor to enter into some part of Piemont, whereby he might the
easiler afterward advance further. And because Asti was nearest them, and not
hard to be taken, by reason of the good intelligence which they held therein
they applied themselves thereunto. The Army being therefore removed from where
it was on the Sixteenth of November, and assigned over unto the Cardinal,
great was the expectation which was had thereof. But the Ambassador of Savoy
who was resident at Rome gessing by the Cardinales hasty departure, that he had
some secret design upon Piemont, gave speedy advertisment thereof unto the
Duchess; And the French being no less vigilent, so great was the suspicion
caused thereby in the Duchess, and her faithful servants, as not knowing
whom to trust, nor what to promise unto herself, under pretense of mustering
the Militia of Turin she brought in thither 1000. French-foote, and securing
thereby the City and her own person, she began to provide against the secret
and treacherous machinations of her officers. And because the Spanish forces
which were brought to the territories of Allessandria, though their outward
appearance was to winter in those parts, made those Frontiers fear they had
some other end, by order from the Cardinal de Vallette, the Duke de Candalle
made many companyes of French advance to those confines; and having an eye to
the proceedings of the Duchess of Mantoa's officers, he dismissed the Marquis
Vallis, and Count Gabionetto, who was president of that Magestracy, from
Cassalle, and made it be known by public Proclamation, that under pain of
incurring his Kings indignation, none should dare to hold any practice or
intelligences with the Marquis Alfonso Guerriere, Governor of the Port of
Mantoa, it being thought that by his means all the affairs of such like
intelligence was continued. The guarrison of Asty was strengthened, and all
things provided for that might prove harmefull; they likewise sent back for
some men, who were already on their way to assist Weymar, before Brisack. And
the Duchess beleiving more and more that she was betrayed, imprisoned many of
her subjects in Turin; amongst which, Colonel Renso, the Secretary Clareois
the Cardinals favorit, Don Silvio the Governor of Carmagneola, Valerio
Rossio, and every other body of whom there was the least shadow of suspicion,
that they should be adheerers unto, or depend upon her Brother in Law. She
moreover brought into the Cittadell a brigade of French, called the Duchess
Regiment; and suspecting the Governors loyalty, she suddenly removed him from
thence, and in his stead gave the custody of the Cittadell to the Marquis of
St. Iermane, whereupon the Cardinal, finding his plot discovered, seeming as
if he had no such intention, went to Nizza della Paglia and within a few days
after came from thence to Certosa di Pavia, that he might speak with Melo,
with whom after many consultations it was agreed upon, that Prince Thomas
should in all have be sent from Flanders; because he being trained up in War,
well liked of by the people of Piemont, vallued and feared by the Nobility, and
being well reputed of in War, might peradventure do more by his own
experience, and assist more by his credit then the Cardinal. For those who
thought not the Cardinal able to defend them with the sword; would
peradventure have liked well enough of Prince Thomas, who was thought capable
of taking upon him the weight of a Principality and to govern it by Arms.

By reason of Ghets his aforesaid defeat, the Austrean affairs were not only
frowned on by fortune in Alsatia, but (which imported more) they ran to ruin by
reason of the contention and emulation of the chief Commanders, for such as
were enemies to Ghets, and rejoiced at his restraint, laid all the blame of
what had happened amiss upon him, and his friends, and such as would patiently
give ear to sound reasons were grieved at, and complained upon the actions of
his evil wishers; yet did they this but covertly and under hand, since there
are but few that will publicly take upon them the defense of such faults, as
have no other protector but God and truth. So as the actions of Ghets being
publicly declaimed against by some, and other some privately insinuating into
the minds of many their evil opinions of his accusers, the more his enemies
did outwardly express the rancor against him, the more did they inwardly burn
with anger that did defend him, whereupon the desire of doing well and
gallantly being suppressed, their own strength decreased, and the enemies power
increased, the time was wholly spent in counsels, in hopes, and in laying of
badly sustained foundations; for Brisack, languishing every day more then
other, was now brought to her last will and Testament. Duke Savell
notwithstanding, upon these great emergencyes, seemed, though with small hopes
of any good effects, willing to extrinsicate his desire in a business which so
much conceirned his Prince. He therefore marched toward Burgondy to join with
some of the Duke of Loreynes troops, that yet remained in that Province, and
then jointly with the remainder of the Caesarian Army, to endeavor the
recovery of that reputation, which if it were not altogether lost, was little
better. But whilst he endeavored to execute his intention with 1000. horse
and 1500 foot, Monseiur de Ficchiers, being advertised thereof who with part
of the French army kept upon the Frontiers of Loreyne which lay toward
Germany, that he might be ready to march wheither occasion should require, went
forthwith to encounter Savell; and as fortune does not so easily turn to
favor those whom she has once turned her back upon, when they were come to
Blows, the Imperialists being on all sides environed by the French, who were
many more in number then they, Savell with much ado saved him self and his
horse, leaving the Foot to the discretion of the Enemy, who took many of them
prisoners, and got about 80. Carriages of Victuals and Baggadge; which when
Reynock who was Governor of Brisack understood, knowing that his last hopes
were vanished away in smoke, and seeing it was decreed by the Fates that that
place should be lost, which was brought to its last gasp, and there being
neither force nor industy that can fight against hunger, he condiscended to
yield the Town up to Weymar, and to receive those honorable conditions that
were offered him, he therefore on the eighteenth of December marched out with
Banners flying, with Arms and baggadg, and other such accustomed ceremonies.
Thus were the Austerians deprived of this so important a place, to the great
displeasure of the Caesarian Court; and very great resentment of the Duke of
Bavaria, who having long before foreseen the business, and the ruin that was
likely to ensue had given exact information thereof to the Emperor and his
Ministers of state, and thought the Emperors officers had failed much in their
duty, in taking no greater care for the preservation of a place which was the
very soul of all those Provinces; for they might easily have victualled and
munitioned it for a longer time. And the Spaniards leaving sufficient forces
for their War in Itally and Flanders, might easily have succord it, and have
kept afflicted Germany from those new wounds, which that they might heal their
own, they suffered her without compassion to receive.

Bavaria was moreover greived at this loss, because it being the key of
Alsatia, a Province which serves for an out Bull-worke to his states, more
perticularly to the Palatinat, his Enemies being got in thither, would keep his
dominions in perpetual fear and agitation. And though some saw that this
place being to remain free in Weymars possession it might easily hereafter be
either made to have no dependency upon France, or else return again into the
Austreans hands either by composition or stratagem, yet the fear least before
this should happen, the French might get footing there, which when they should
have done, they would not so easily be driven out, was a thing infinitely
considerable in reason of State. By how much therefore the Imperialists were
hereat afflicted the French were as much pleased, and Weymar, who blown up
with glory, in having won a place of such importance, before the face of so
many forces conspired against him, 'twas feared he might enlarge his thoughts,
and afflict the remainder of those states, noe less then the King of Sweden
had done, whereof he was debarred by his sudden death, as in its proper place
shall be said. Weymar having placed a Guarrison in this Town, and all things
necessary or requisite for the defense thereof he left Collonell Erlack for the
Governor thereof, a Swise by nation; and marched with his Army into Burgondy,
that he might winter there, and be at the King of France his disposal, whereat
his first entrance he took many places, amongst the rest the Castle of Ioux;
and Collonell Rosa stayed to take in Tan that he might deprive the Enemy of
that place of retreat; and the better secure the passage from Burgondy into
Flanders. Passing forwards from Ioux, Weymar made himself Master of Ponterlin,
which was no strong place, of Nosaret another weak place toward the River
Daime; and being told that some of the Enemies troops were quartered about
Ornans, a Town upon the River Lonne, he over run all those neighboring
Towns, but to little purpose, for upon the news of his coming the Burgonians
had forsaken them, and were got into Bisansonne.

Banniers forces being now increased by the access of the people which the
Swedish Ministers of State sent him in from all sides, and Gallasse on the
contray, being enforced to retreat through the want of victuals, and of
money, and by reason of his Armies being much diminished by sufferings, and by
the plague, did without any manner of fear keep the feilds in those parts,
where finding he was dreaded, and knowing the power of daring, when the
adversary gives back, he advanced to make further acheevements, and continued
firm in his opinion, of bringing all the War upon the Enemies Country, and
of easing those Provinces which being quartered upon now by the one, now by the
other side, the people which yet remained therein: were brought into great
want* He therefore rose from his winter quarters in the one, and the other
Marca, and in Brunswick, and having mustered his Army which he found to be
about 26000. fightingmen, he in good order marched toward Turingia, a bold
undertaking, but rendered feasible, by reason, of the confusion and paucety of
the Imperial forces in those parts. The news whereof coming to Dresden and to
Prage, and this neighborhood being very prejudicial to that Duke, and to the
Bohemians, convenient provisions were earnestly demanded of the Emperor, who
no less fearing these proceedings, held daily Councels touching the present
Emergencies. Orders were sent to Azfelt, who was yet about Westfalia, having an
eye to the proceedings of King, and the Prince Elector, who endeavored all
they might to rally their Forces; to march with part of his soldiers toward
Fulda, and to discover what the Sweeds intentions were. The people who were
quartered in the Bishopprick of Munster, and others in those Provinces were
sent toward the Wesser, that they might come to Gallasse in Bohemia, who being
indisposed in body, but much more in mind, by reason of Azfelts prosperous
fortune, who began publicly to say he would no longer be subordinate or
subservient to him, desired to withdraw himself to a private life. At which
the Caesarian Council being not a little troubled, he was comforted with good
words, and had leave given him to tend the recovery of his health, but not to
quit his charge; obliging him as soon as he should be recovered to reassume
the employment, which in his absence was committed to Colonel Slich. But
Gallasse thinking that these appearances proceeded not from the heart, because
he saw that together with the change of Officers, the estimation was also
changed, which was formerly put upon his merit and quality; but that it did
proceed from simulation, where-withall the spots of the mind are covered, and
that Azfelt was desirous to enter into his place, and thereunto persuaded by
the backing of such as favored him, he continued his former desires, and
obtained leave to stay in Bohemia til he should have perfectly recovered his
health, in which interim, time might peradventure teach him to think upon some
other course. Marcini was likewise commanded to join with the Duke of Saxons
men, and that afterward joining with Salis the General of the Artillery, who
was about Sala with some 6000. soldiers, they should unanimously oppose the
enemies proceedings on this side, whilst Azfelt molested them on the other
side. And the Emperor that he might be nearer them, to give them fitting
orders, resolved to remove his Court to Prague. The Regiments of Colonel
Cheinitz and Colonel Posen, both of them the Duke of Saxons subjects, were
brought into Lypsia; and for what remained, nothing was left undone which was
thought convenient to the wisdom of Counsels; some moneys were sent to
Slich, who was already come into Bohemia, wherewithal to satisfy the
soldiers and appease the tumults which were made for want of pay, and the
usual contribution of the country which was already wholly desolated. But as
provisions which are made in have, and in sight of the enemy, use to be but of
little availement, for the fear they have of no good success, and the
confusion occasioned by have, does exceedingly impede that assurance, which
otherwise is had when men are in a readiness to defend themselves with
sufficient strength, so these hasty prepatations serving but to imbase men's
minds, and make the soldier fearful, did little good. For Bannier (whilst
these spent their time in advising) losing no time, took Torgaw, Newenburg
upon the Sala, and other places belonging to the Elector of Saxony; and without
any opposition, was already Master of the field, keeping about Lipsicke, and
the Frontiers of Bohemia, to the great astonishment of those people, many
whereof not thinking themselves safe in Prague it self, fled with the best of
their movables into Towns toward the Danube. And their apprehensions were so
much the greater, in that Salis the Austrians Serjeant-Major General,
pretending to beat back Bannier, and hinder him from advancing further, went
to the parts about Elchenitz to relieve Zucka which was besieged by the enemy,
where he met with some Sweeds who scoured those countries, and who charged him
so eagerly, as that his forerunners turning back at the very first, and the
rest apprehending fear by their flight, Salis had much ado to save himself
and some few of his horse by getting into Egra, having lost about 500. of his
men, 10. Standards, and 14. Ensigns, the news whereof coming to Zucka, they
immediately surrendered the Town on the 7th of March, as likewise did
Chimenits, which was besieged the same time

Whilst the Sweeds prospered daily more and more in Germany against the Saxons,
whilst Weymar took in such places in Burgondy, as being weakly situated and
walled, could not withstand his fierce assaults; and whilst preparations for
War were daily made upon the Frontiers of Picardy. Prince Thomas went post from
Flanders and came to Trent, from whence sending speedy advertisement to Milan,
and to his Brother the Cardinal, Don John d'Artagia, Captain of the Guard,
was forthwith sent by Leganes to meet him upon the Confines. The Cardinal
came to Lodi, and sent the Counts of Mossano and Masserati to welcome him, and
when he came on the tenth of March to Vaniero, Leganes, Don Martin d'Aragona,
Don Antonio di Sermiento, the Lord Chancellor, and an infinite number of
Cavalliers and Tituladoes came to meet him. Where having stayed some six
hours, and agreed upon the way how he might enter into Piemont, they returned
the same night to Meltsi, a place belonging to Cardinal Triuulsio, and the
next morning to Millan, strict orders being afterward given to the Governor
of Alessandria, and to those of Brem, and Vercelles, that they might make
greater provision of Hay and corn for horses in those parts. Don Martin d'
Aragona was sent toward Alessandria, with orders to assemble together all the
soldiery, and to be ready to put in effect such resolutions as should be
agreed upon. And because Princes never use to let slip any negotiation, when
the keeping of them on foot is not prejudicial to them, Prince Thomas sent
the Baron Palavesine, and the Count de Saravelle to his Sister in Law the
Duchess Dowager, to acquaint her with his pretenses; who returning from their
fruitless journey, informed his Highness, how that great were the cummotions
in Turin, and throughout all Piemont, occasioned by his coming, and by his
pretenses, whereupon he took better heart, and the Spaniards hoped more in
their designs. For the Inhabitants of Piemont, who pretended that all their
misfortunes arose from the French, and who would be better pleased with the
government of their own natural Princes, then in making trial of the
interest they had of the French, or of the Spaniards hostility, greatly desired
though to their own loss, to be quit of that fear which was insupportable to
them. Therefore after many consultations they put on such resolutions as were
thought convenient to effect their designs; and Commission was sent to Aragon,
who had already gathered together about 7000. Foot, and 1500. horse in the
parts of Alessandria, that he should go to the Lange to take in Cingio, a
place not contemptible, and wherein was a French Garrison; And it was ordered
that Prince Thomas should go to Novar, and from thence to Vercelles; And that
the Cardinal should go toward Astigiano, with some other Forces, to see
whether he could get into that City or no; for the Frenchmen going into the
Lange to attend upon the proceedings of Don Martin, Prince Thomas might easily
effect what was agreed upon amongst them. And therefore after Leganes was come
on the 17th of March to Margiano, where both the Princes of Savoy were
expecting the Spaniards resolution to their desires; which were that they might
enter Piemont by reason of the Spanish Forces, but as in their own right, and
here again consultations being had of what course was best to be taken; the
Princes again demanded that they might be permitted to enter Piemont with the
Spanish forces, as lent unto them by the King of Spain, and not otherwise, for
that the Subjects being hereby encouraged, would be the more willingly brought
to agree with them, when they should see their Princes enter in their own
names, and the Nobility would have better grounded pretenses to side with them,
since their reason for so doing would appear legitimate, it being to keep
that State from falling into the hands of strangers. They further showed, that
to have the Spaniards enter into lieu of the French, was not the right way to
win the affections of the Subjects, and to dispose of them as they desired; for
when they should see that on one side or other, They were to commit Treason
against their Prince by receiving in of Strangers, and submitting themselves
unto them, the Spaniards being much more hateful to the Inhabitants of Piemont
then are the French, they would be more wary in falling upon any such
resolution. But though these reasons were very strong, yet did they not
prevail with Leganes; for he pretending he could not alter his directions he
had received from Spain, declared, he intended not to make War for any others
then for his King, nor that he had any other directions then to prosecute the
French, and those who should assist them; he said he would acquaint the Court
of Spain with their desires, and endeavor that they might be satisfied
therein. But all this was an outward show, for it was plainly seen the
Spaniards would not engage themselves in any thing whereout they could reap no
profit. For they considered that when the Princes of Savoy should by means of
the Spanish Forces have possessed themselves of the strong holds of Piemont, or
by some other way come to an accord with the Duchess, or by the young Dukes
death, the Cardinal should become Duke there was no doubt, but when any of
these should happen, they would so behave themselves, as that neither the
Spaniards nor French should be suffered to nesle themselves there in such sort
as to become arbitrators of their will. Moreover since it complied not with the
Duke of Savoyes interest, that Montferrat should fall into the hands of
Spaniards, 'twas apparent that the business of Cassalle would either openly or
underhand be impeeded, nor would they suffer that the Spaniards should keep in
Vercelles nor in the other Towns of that State. So as it seemed more probable
if it should so fall out, that they would join with the French, to recover
what they had lost to better their condition by some new achievement; and to
keep the Spaniards within their own limits, then obliege themselves to depend
upon them and upon their pleasure. And though there were some that said these
things would not easily happen, since Prince Thomas his Wife and Children were
in Spain as Hostages of his Loyalty, and greater then which none can be given,
yet were these reasons rejected by those that knew that the Dukedom fell not
upon Prince Thomas, but upon the Cardinal. The Spaniards therefore who
maturely considered all these particulars, persisted in their resolution of not
entering into Piemont in any other manner then has been said; For when their
Garrisons should be in the Dukes Forts, the Conquest would be the Spaniards,
not the Savoyards, and keeping themselves therein, the business of Cassalle
would be the more easy; and the French foregoing Italy, would at the same
time easily be driven out of Piemont, which otherwise would hardly be effected.
And if Piemont should fall into the hands of the Spaniards, and that the French
should be shut up on the other side the mountains, the Spaniards having no
further reason to fear the fickleness of the Savoyards, there is no doubt but
that being secured from the incursions of the French, they would by their
armies endeavor to possess themselves of the rest of Italy. These were the
hidden ends and the ambitious desires of the Spaniards, and though these
endeavors were by some thought to be ill undertaken, as likely to prove
harmfull to the undertaker; For the bundle they grasped at was too great, and
the Princes of Italy growing hereat jealous, and the French better advised, the
one and the other of them would put on such resolves, as yet they kept secret
within their own breasts; Yet the Spaniards enamoured of their own vast hopes
herein, fixed their minds here, and used all the art they could how to erect
so great a building. 'Twas therefore known the Savoy Princes were not inwardly
pleased with these proceedings, who clearly saw the Spaniards ruinous ends;
Notwithstanding, since what is once famed abroad, does often times draw after it
the repugnant will, and the desire of glory blinding the wisdom of the
intellect, these Princes not being able to disingage themselves without failing
in their enterprise, covering the bitterness of their soul with the sweet of
simulation, they seemed outwardly as if they would wholly depend upon the
Spaniard, and disposed themselves to follow their advice, till they should have
compast that, which once had, they would afterward appear in such colors as
should make most for their purpose. And therefore having at the same time more
clearly learned what good will the people of Piemont bore them, and the
forwardness of those that sided with them by the arrival of Il Patremoniale
Molletta who was receiver of the Rents of Piemont which belonged to these
Princes. The Princes went to Pavia, to purge themselves a little, and Leganes
ret^rning immediately to Millan, went on the 19 of March toward Novar,
accompanied by Don Antonio di Sermiento, the Abbas, Vasques, Marquess Lonati,
and Don Gonsales d' Olivara, to expect the coming of Prince Thomas thither,
having all things in a readiness speedily to compass their desired ends.

Don Martin d' Aragona being at this time encamped before Cingio, and having to
facilitate the business, shut up all the passes of those mountains, by which
relief might be brought, and thinking it no less requisite to take the Town
and Castle of Salicetto, not far distant from the said Cingio, wherein there
was a Garrison of about 300. French, he sent Don Lewis de Lancastro, with some
troops to make himself Master thereof. Where having planted his Cannon, and
begun the siege, which seemed not to promise to good success, the soldiers
therein defending themselves with extraordinary valor; Don Martin who much
desired have in this affair, and that it might be expedited before succor
could come from the French, who by placing themselves there, might disturb the
siege of Cingio, he went thither himself in person, and as he was discovering
the Situation, and viewing the Trenches of approach, he was slain with a
musket bullet which hit him on the head on the 13. of March, to the great
grief of Lancastro, and the whole Army, for besides that he was a Gentleman
very well acquainted in the managing of werlike and poletique affairs; he was
so courteous in all his actions, as that he won the affection of as many as
knew him. Amongst other good things that were observable in him, he was very
sincere and faithful in all his words and actions, whereupon if any one at any
time should seem not much to rely, or to confide in, he was wont to say
believe it, and fear not because I am a Spaniard, I promise it thee as a Dutch
Cavallier. Don Lewis notwithstanding not abasht for this misfortune but rather
setting more hotly upon Salicetta, he enforced it to surrender before the
succor came. So as all the Forces being brought before CINGIO, much diligence
was used in the opugning of that place, and the more, for that Don Antonio
Sottello being sent to command the Forces there in the place of Don Martin,
that he might not at his first entrance come short of the expectation was had
of him, he behaved himself with all industry and valor.

Upon the news of the Aragons death, the Cardinal de Valette and Marquess
Villa with 3000. foot and 2000. horse, came to the relief of Cingio, and set
upon the Spanish quarters, who valiantly defending themselves for the space of
seven hours, at last by reason of the narrowness of the place wherein the
French horse could not be so well exercised, the Spaniards having great
advantage in foot, Villa was enforced to retreat with the worst. Which when
Monseiur de Mason Neu^e who was Governor of the Town knew, despairing of
relief, and almost all his muskets being broken through continual shooting,
and the ill temper of the iron, not being able to defend himself without them,
and having stoutly with-stood two assaults; he treated and yielded up the
place, marching out with his arms, baggage, and one piece o^ Cannon.

This was cause of much content to Leganes, for the Lange being better secured
hereby, and consequently the passage from Finalle to the State of Millan, made
more commodious, he considered he might the better turn his Forces
elsewhere. Chedini being left Governor here, those forces marched toward
Montferrat.

Prince Thomas and Leganes understanding that the French were marched toward
Cingio, the Prince came from Pavia, where he had finished his purgation, and
arrived at Vercelles where Leganes was: and making use of the intelligence
which he held with the Governor of Chinas, a place near the Poe between
Cressentine and Turin, he on the 26th of March came by break of day with two
thousand horse before the gates of the Town, and without effusion of blood
made himself Master thereof; For the Governor who held correspondedcy with
him, not endeavoring any defense, after the playing of one Petar, suffered the
Prince his men freely to enter.

By this means the way being opened into the heart of Piemont, the Cardinal
was presently sent for thither by the Spaniards, that by doing so, they might
honest their no ways grateful intentions toward those people, who seeing
their Forts assigned over into the hands of their own natural Princes, would
the easilier be persuaded to side with the Spaniards, though the Garrison and
Governor which was put thereinto being Spanish, it might indeed rather be
said that the Cardinal had put himself into the hands of the Town, then that
the Town was put into his hands.

Prince Thomas seconded by some companyes of Foot sent unto him by Leganes,
went to ^hier and Moncallier, places not far distant from Turin, which
presently submitted unto him, and many of those inhabitants following him, he
came before Aglie, a Town belonging to a Count of the same name, which
standing out, he sacked it. From thence he marched with his horse within sight
of Turim, hoping through intelligence which he held with some of the Town to
do the deed; but he found he was deceived by reason of the strict guard made
by the French, and the Duchess her people; so as after having given the
Governor to understand that if he would receive him in, he should not only
purchase his favor, but better his own condition much, and finding that
neither promises nor threats would work upon his loyalty, he retreated lest he
might give upon the French, who prepared to light upon him at unawares. Passing
from thence to Hivenea, a City placed upon Doria Bautia, he took it by storm,
and took afterward the Town and Castle of Bard, which is the key of the
valley of Osta, by which he likewise reduced the City of Osta, and all that
valley, the people coming in unto his service. The French were much terrified
thereat. For they could not at the same time march forth against their enemies,
and keep an eye upon their friends fidelity. The taking of this valley was
thought to be of great consequence; for besides the getting from thence a
considerable strength of men, the possession of this pass made much for the
Spaniards, for thereby they might the more easily pass into Burgondy. Leganes
who would not advance before he saw the event, as well not to hazard his
reputation upon an uncertainty, as not to exasperate those people with his
presence, who as they willingly saw Prince Thomas, so was the sight of the
Governor of Millan most hateful to them, from whom they expected nothing
else, but some trick whereby to bring them to his obedience, when he heard of
this, rose with all the forces he then had about Vercelles, and speaking with
Prince Thomas and his brother the Cardinal between H^verea and Vercelles,
they jointly agreed upon what was best to be done, the present conjunctures
considered. Those of Piemont were of opinion they should forbear to sit down
with their Forces before any Forts; and only keep in the field, and so rather
invite the Inhabitants to lay down their arms, then to employ them the more in
their defense, and to effect that by treaty, which was hard to do by arms:
that by no means Leganes who was come hither as it was said to assist the
Princes, should seem to do so; For the people when they should see the Princes
endeavored to captivate the Subjects good will not for themselves, but for the
Spaniards, they would rather keep firm in their loyalty to the Duchess and
young Duke, though in doubt to be mastered by the French, then side with the
Princes, with certainty to be inslaved by the Spaniard. Leganes who saw
whether this tended, or at least suspected that the Princes would only seem to
depend upon them, till they might be brought to have the government of Piemont,
either by force or fair means, thought it not good to condescend to this, the
rather because it was not likely the Princes would bereave the Duke their
Nephew, and the Duchess their Sister in Law of what was theirs, and drive out
the French, who were the Protectors of that State, to ruin together with
themselves the whole State, and their faithful Subjects, and assubject
themselves to the Spaniards, to whose proceeding the Dukes of Savoy always had
an eye. But the Spaniards chief ends being that they might get into the best
Forts of Piemont, and particularly into such as might help them to get
Montferrat, which they so thirsted after, he resolved in some sort to satisfy
the Princes in their desires, and with specious words and fair promises, he
did all that might seem outwardly fair; but at the same time he had an eye to
his chief aim, which was to streighten Cassall by taking Trino and other
neighboring places.

The meeting being dissolved, the Cardinal went to stay at Hiverea, to keep
those people in their fidelity, and to raise some forces in those parts; Prince
Thomas came before Sigliano, in the way to Cresentino; Leganes sent Don John de
Garray against the army, which after the taking of Cingio kept thereabouts,
wherefore changing his first intention, which was to come on the other side
above Maudoni, to assail Turin, he was to march by the way of Aich, Nizza, and
Annone, and crossing the Astigian, to come before Verva. Then joining with
Prince Thomas in Sigliano, they came before Verna on the ninth of April, and in
a few hours took the Town by assault, and the Castle wanting necessary
defense yielded; the next day they also took Crescentino, both of them Towns
near the Poe, the one on this side the River, the other on the other, places
fit to hinder what was wont to be carried by water to Trino and Cassall. And
because the Spaniards knew of what importancy Hiveria was, a place very fitting
to keep the command of that Country which lies between Doira Bautia, and Sesia
above Canavese, they resolved to fortify it round about with perfect
Fortifications. So as sending Fra. Ferrante Bolognino with other soldiers to
strengthen the Garrison, and Pioners to perfect the Works, they fell very
busily to it.

In this revolution of affares, the Cardinal of Vallette, not daring to march
into the feilds, for fear of the insurrection of the people, thought good to
come to Turin, where there was greater suspicion of meeting with some
treachery, And to quarter his army about that City till such time as the Duke
of Longeville, who was already parted from France, to assist the forces of
Italy, with the recrewtes promised by the King, were come to the edge of
Piemont, where they would then resolve upon what might make most for the Kings
service, and increasing in the Duchess her suspicion of the inhabitance of
Turin, he made their arms be taken from them, the guardes be dubled, and
dilligent inquiry to be made into the actions, gestures and speeches of such as
were suspected of treachery. But Prince Thomas being comforted by those who
could bring him into Turin, that he might loose no time in appearing before the
Town, marched thetherward with Leganes and the whole army; and haulting at
Gruliasco, two miles from Turin, he there attended the hour to perfect his
work, and being advertised by a Princes, a sister of his, who was a Nun, that
such a Friar was gone toward him, with intention to kill him, the Friar coming
soon after to present him with a letter, were it true that he had any such
intention, or were it his misfortune, to come in such a nick of time as did
correspond with the suspicion had of him, he was arrested and sent to his
Brother the Cardinal at Hiverea, to the intent the truth might be there found
out, but agreeing with the keeper who had him in custody as he was upon the
way, he and his Keeper made an escape.

Parting from Gruliasco, on the 17th. of April he drew near to Turin, where
meeting with the French horse, a skirmish happened between the Dragoones, and
Dutch of the Spanish army, and some of the French troops, who were put to the
worst, and were forced to retreat with the loss of about twenty Mules loaded
with merchandise which they were convoying. The Duchess having afterward
sent Commissary Monte with a good strength of horse and foot, to reinforce her
men, and Leganes having sent some Companyes of Bolognini and Sottellos Brigades
to meet with them, the skirmish began a fresh again, in such sort as the
Marquis Villa coming in on the French side, and Don Carlo della Gatta, with
all the Neapolitan horse on the Spanish, the Spaniards being many more in
number then were the French, the French skirmishing in an admirable good order,
got under the shelter of the Cannon of the Cittadell, with the loss of some
Soldiers, and of the Count De Giu a Frenchman.

Incurraged by this retreat, and by the hopes of intelligence, the Spaniards
suddenly advanced to set upon the borough of Poe near Turrin and entrenched
3000. foot there, hoping by means of their partakers to enter the town that
night, but they failed in their intent; for the Cardinal of Vallette being
vigilent every where, rendered all the endeavors of the treacherous vain, and
possessing himself of the Capuchians situation, and fortifying himself there
he levelled his Cannon against the Spaniards quarters which were commanded on
this side, So as finding the place too hot for them, they after a few days
retreated, and divided their army; the one part thereof went with Prince Thomas
to Villa nova d'Asti which he presently stormed and pillaged, and Leganes went
with the other part to before Moncaluo, and after having taken the Town, and
left 2000. foot there to reduce the Castle, he joined again with the Prince,
and with one accord on the thirtieth of April, they came with a great force
before Asti, and the next day without any gainesaying entered the City, which
the Commendator Balbiani who was Governor thereof, thinking he would not keep
it, he withdrew himself to the Cittadell, where he thought to defend himself
better. But Montagnivola being taken by the Spaniards, upon the which the
French had built a little fort, the Castle was thereby commanded, so as wanting
succor and ammunition yielded upon treaty, way being made hereby to further
acheevements, the Cardinal of Savoy, who was at Hiverea removed his Court
hither, as well to keep the subjects in their logality, and faithfulness to
him, as to raise men who might have no dependence either upon France or Spain,
which when he should have done, he was sure he should be willingly received
into many Towns, where they should be certain to be guarisonised by people
put into them by their own Princes, and not by the Spaniards or French, to
which some would not submit, Bolognini who parting from Hiveria was commanded
to take in the Castle of Pontestura, had likewise no worse success, for being
reduced to great extremity it compounded, and the French marched out; and
Trino being by this Castle divided from Cassall, they might easily effect their
desires upon that place. A convenient Garrison being afterward left in Cassall
under the command of Marquess Pietro, Antonio Lenati, and the Garrisons of
Salicetto, Montaldo, Aliano, and other places being by reason of this place
superfluous, the whole Army came before Moncalvo, and straightly besieging the
Castle which did valiantly defend it self, by means of a mine which blew up
one of the great towers thereof, he forced it to yield to the great displeasure
of the French; for this place being in the very heart of Montferrat, Cassall was
thereby the more straightened. The Cardinal of Vallette fearing therefore lest
under the happy Augure of these victories, they might likewise bethink
themselves of taking Cassall, he conveyed in thither diverse sacks of salt, a
thing which the Inhabitants very much wanted, and he added 400. horse, and
800. Foot of the Montferrians to the Garrison thereof. And his Brother the
Duke of Candalle being not long before dead of a Fever, who commanded there in
Chief. He by orders from the King made Monseiur de Toures Governor thereof,
he who whilst Charles Duke of Mantoa lived, was General to his Highness in
Mantoa. By this time the actions of the Cardinal of Savoy, and of his Brother
were generally murmured at, for that being exasperated against the State of
their innocent Nephew, they made it the scean of so bitter and unhappy a war,
and because the Nobility and common people being divided, some did secretly
adhere unto the Princes, and did also manifest their resolutions, some kept
constant to the Duchess, thinking it absolute felony to forsake her who was
their Dukes Governesse, and represented his person; so all parts were full of
horror and confusion; some fearing to be punished by the Duchess and the
French, others being frightened at the Princes threats backed by the Spaniards.
And the Princes pretending to have law on their side in their laying claim to
what could not be denied them; and being therein much more confirmed by a late
Declaration made by the Emperor wherein he declared the late Dukes last will and
Testament as null and invalid, and the pretenses of the two just Princes, they
printed a Manifesto in Asti, containing all the reasons why they were forced to
endeavor by force of arms to get the Guardian-ship of the Duke their Nephew,
answerable to the Laws of the State, and did therein afterward signify how
that whatsoever the Duchess had done as Governesse to her Son was invalid,
as in particular the League she had made with her Brother the King of France.
And they ordained upon pain of life, and the danger of incurring high Treason,
that no Subject whatsoever should for the time to come take part with the
Duchess nor obey her. They likewise declared the orders of the Annuntiata,
and of the Cross of Saint Maurice, and Lazarus conferred by the Duchess upon
diverse Cavalliers to be null and of no validity unless they should come at the
same time to have those orders confirmed by them; as also that the Governors
of all Towns should acknowledge them for their superiors, and come and receive
the confirmation of their governments from them; otherwise if they should
remain in their obedience to the Duchess, they should be understood as
guilty of High Treason, forfeite their Honors and their Estates.

The Sweeds being inhartened by the taking of Zuicka, and having thereby
secured the passes over the Mulda, upon any occasion of retreat, they came with
part of their army before Freiberg, that by the taking thereof they might the
easilier enter into Saxony, but as this was a place of great moment to the
Elector of Saxony, so did he employ all his Forces to the defense thereof, and
some of his troops joining with Marcini, they marched thitherward to relieve
it, as they did. For Bannier not having made any considerable Works or Trenches
about it, nor having men enough to fight, it behoved him to retreat. So to shun
the necessity of giving battle, having formerly stood a charge upon his reere,
wherein he suffered some loss, and he himself was lightly hurt with an
Harquebuse. But if the Sweeds were not pleased with the business of Freiburg,
they recovered the loss they there received by their good success at the same
time before Demmin, which they had besieged some months before. For the Town
being reduced to great extremity, yielded upon parley to the Sweedes, who
having hereby made themselves Masters of all Pomerania, wherein they had many
useless Garrisons, they drew from thence as many people as they could, and
marched toward Bannier, who being gone from his former quarters, was retreated
toward Aldemberg to expect those recruits. Marcini invited thereunto by his
good success, and encouraged the more by this retreat, pursued him with more
daring then forces to Valtheim, For Bannier expecting the succor which was
already upon their march toward him, did cunningly by his retreat entice the
enemy after him, that they might be so far engaged in their pursuit as not
to be able to shun battle, wherein he might have his deupon them. But his
expected succor not appearing, though he knew they made long marches, he
intrencht himself near the River Scope, which runs between Chimnits and
Freyburg, not far from whence Marcini also haulted to expect the arrival of
some Troops which were coming to his succor from Bohemia, and that he might
not engage himself any further, for the loss of Demmin being of great
consequence, and all those people marching toward Bohemia, he foresaw he
should incur some mischief without a greater strength. Letters were
therefore with all diligence dispatched away to Vienna, to solicit the hasting
away of men that were raised in Morania, Hungary, and elsewhere, as also to
desire that the Emperor would come to Prague, by whose presence the people
there would not be a little sollaced, they being much mastered by fear and
confusion, by reason of the Sw^eds great preparations. Concerning which, having
had many consultations, the Counselors were irresolute in their resolves,
doubtful in what they should pitch upon, and troubled in their thoughts. For
this War not being to be maintained without money from Spain, nor yet to be
managed handsomely without the whole Caesarian Forces, both these were known
to be prejudicial For the forces of the Empire could not be divided without
giving distaste and pr^judice to the Spaniards, nor any moneys being to be
received from Spain without imparting some Dutch aid to the King of Spaines
Dominions. The Dutch therefore complained of being brought to such a condition,
as they must refer themselves to the pleasure of the Spanish State Ministers;
who they affirmed had been the cause of the loss of Brisacke, not only by
having deteyned Picolomeni, and Lamboy in Flanders in a time when they should
have made use of their succor, and which they joining with Ghets might have
effected, but by not consenting to send some Italian Forces into Alsatia, to
save that important place, which was the key of the Empire, and the loss
whereof was so prejudicial to all Germany, being ear^estly desired so to do
Some therefore exclaimed bitterly against them, and pressed that all their Forces
might be sent for from Flanders, that so they might tend their own welfare
before the welfare of others. But the Spaniards who knew how prejudicial it
would be to them to be deprived of the Dutch assistance, behaved themselves
dexterously with those that were of their party. And they likewise knowing what
loss they were likely to undergo without the support of moneys from Spain,
the Emperors Coffers being empty, no contribution being to be had from the
harrassed Country, nor so many armies being therein to be maintained, the
sequel was, that the one and the other of them concealing and cloaking their
distasts according to exact policy, they applied all their consultations to the
common interest.

Many notwithstanding wondered, that the Spaniards who put so great an esteem
upon the Imperial greatness wherewith their own Grandetsa is likewise
upheld, should only intend their own interest, and provide for the safety of
Flanders and Italy, by drawing the best Soldiers from out the Emperors Army;
and that chiefly fearing the power of France, they endeavored most of all to
fence themselves against it. Others that were more speculative affirmed the
cause of this not to proceed so much from what has been said, as from a more
profound end; for they held the Spaniards did not so intensively mind the
affairs of the Empire, as well for that they more valued what was their own,
then what appertained unto another, as that it seemed no such prejudice could
be received by the Sweeds then, as the ignorant people talked of; For before
they could come into the heart of the Imperial patrimony, the Sweeds were to
pass through the States of Brandemburg, Saxony, and the States of other
Protestant Princes, who had made their peace with the Emperor, so as those
States would be first exposed to the miseries of War; and it made for the
Emperor that the War might fall out amongst the Protestants, who when they
should be by themselves weakened, the Emperors pulse would beat the higher.
So as when afterward they should have defended Flanders and Italy from the
French, and have come to some accommodation with that Crown, or by any new
accident some intestine broils might again rise up in France, they might then
turn all their strength against the impoverished and weakened Princes of
Germany and reduce them more easily to their obedience, and accomplish that
vast design which the Spaniards aimed at. The Dutch observing the Spaniards
manner of proceedings, wherein they never found the effects which they
comforted Caesar and his Court with, neither knowing whether they had been
faithful to them or no in their relating to them the pleasure of the King of
Spain and his Counsel, but rather fearing that his agents might have altered
or with-drawne from his orders, Haniball Gonsaga, brother to the Prince of
Bozolo, was sent Ambassador extraordinary from the Emperor to acquaint the
Court of Spain with the condition of Germany, with the importancy of the loss
of Brisacke, and with what need there was of a puissant army to recover it, and
to hinder the further advancement of Weymar and Bannier, who being Commanders
of great esteem, respect was to be had to their experience and success The
Arch Duchess of Inspruch did likewise send to the same purpose, Pagano a
Jesuit, a very understa^ding man; for knowing what influence the Jesuits have
upon the Spaniards, whose councels are for the most part governed by them, she
thought him fitter then any other Subject of Tiroll to obtain what was
desired. Picolomeni was ratified General of the Flanders Forces. Gallasse
having recovered his health, was entreated to reassume the government of the
Army, and to have a care to the preservation of Bohemia, which the Sweedes
seemed much to threaten; all the levies of men were in great haste sent to the
Frontiers; Lamboy was likewise sent to treat with Weymar underhand, to see
whether they could entice this brave Commander from adhering to the French, and
(which imported more) to get him to relinquish Brisacke, by offering him the
Dukedom of Cobury, and by other promises. The Grisonne Ambassador returned
very well satisfied in their negotiations from Spain, where they had been very
well treated, and were nobly received at Millan, with presents and other
demonstrations, which made them very well satisfied with the new friendship
they had contracted with Spain; in brief, great preparations were made in all
parts, and negotiations earnestly pursued.

But as the Austrian preparations were great in all parts of their dominions,
the King of France came not short of them in his vast designs; For to boot
with a great Army which he had got together upon the Frontiers of Artoise,
between Amyens and Abbeville, commanded by Monsieur de Millervy, chief
Commander of the Artillery, and other soldiery toward Mets, commanded by
Monsieur Ficchieres, and the Viscount Arpagia, more men were continually raised
in France, and taken into pay, to the end that their army might still be kept in
vigor, and their places be supplied, who perished or ran away. Wherefore the
Infanta fearing the French had some great design in hand, he sent for some of
Picolomenies men who were quartered about Cleves, and dispatched them away with
Colonel Breda, and Horch toward the Mosell, that there they might have an eye
to the French, and withstand them the best they might. And Picolomeny who was
at Bona in the Country of Cullen, to be assistant with Colonel Glem, and the
Marquess Caretto at the Council of War which was held concerning the
present affairs, when he understood the Frenchmens march, he forthwith
returned post to his army, and removing it from its former quarters, he came
between Mosa and Mossell, and halted there, preparing to execute the Infanta's
orders. But all this kept not the French from going on with their resolutions;
For it was agreed in the Kings Council that Theonuille should be this year
endeavored to be taken, a Fort of mighty importance, which lying upon the
Moselle benath Mets, kept the way open for the Spaniards from Lucemburg to
Loreyn, whereinto when things should succeed well, they might enter. The
French therefore that they might make this place sure, sent Ficchiers with
sixteen thousand men to besiege it on the 10th of May; and because they had
resolved at the same time to undertake somewhat else elsewhere, Milleray having
mustered his army near Abeville on the 13. of May, which he found to consist of
18000. men, together with a good train of Artillery, he went to take in
Hesden, a strong place, environed with exact and regular Bastions, situated in
the Champion which extends it self from the Sea to Dorlens, a passage of great
consideration to open the way for further enterprises in Flanders; he therefore
planted his batteries, and began the siege. On the other side likewise the
Prince of Conde, and Marishall Schamburg, who had raised another great army in
Languedocke, about Tolowse, went to the taking in of Salsa a Fort upon the
confines of Catalonia belonging to the K. of Spain, by which the ingresse
being opened on that side, they might bring some troubles upon those Kingdoms;
and Duke Weymar went at the same time before Salies a City in Burgundy. Four
Sieges at one and the same time of remarkable consideration, and which do
evidently witness the power of that Kingdom, which to boot with the Armies
before these Forts, three of which are thought to be the best of all Europe,
did at the same time maintain a War in Italy, an Army in Alsatia, a Fleet
at Sea, and contributed great sums of money to the Hollanders, Swissers,
Sweeds and others; all which was done by that Kingdom alone without the aid
or assistance of any others. The Commanders fought a vye against these Forts,
to try who should have the honor first to perfect his undertaking; so as the
Spaniards were greatly troubled not only in respect of the imminent danger, but
out of their emulation, for they now saw the greatness of France did much
withdraw from the pre-eminence which the Spaniards pretended unto in Europe;
yet not giving way either to fear or passion they provided to defend themselves
on the one and the other side. Picolomeny was sent toward Theonville, that
with his valor and experience he might relieve that place. The Infanta
encamped himself with 14000, men near Borbocke, to endeavor the safety of
Hesdin: Soldiers were raised every where in Spain to keep Salsa from being
lost; and because the Prince of Oringe was at the same time marched toward
Nimenghen to raise jealousies in the Spaniards, and to divide their Forces in
such manner as they should not be able to defend themselves both against him
and against the French, the Country Militia being made to take up arms, who
were put into places least suspicious in lieu of the Soldiers that were drawn
thereout, another great body of men was sent to Gheldren. In fine, wisdom nor
dexterity not being wanting in any part, Spain and France and all other States
belonging to these two Crowns, were full of Arms, and abounded in Counsels
how they might prosperously effect their ends.

Whilst these things went thus, Bannier not seeing the expected recruits
appear (for Scallans who had the leading of them, entertained himself by the
way in taking in of some places held by the Imperiallists, which though they
were not much valued, yet by reason of great contributions which were taken
from them, were advantageous to the Sweeds) and being advertized how the
Imperiallists grew daily stronger, thought to pass over the Elbe, so to keep
himself the better from their hostility, and joining with those who were in
Slesia, to encamp there till the expected succor should arrive. But Maracini
being advertised hereof, though he had not Forces sufficient to buckle with the
Sweeds, who were become the more bold, for that they saw their safety depended
more upon the edge of their swords, he being encourgaged by his former good
success, and by the retreat, which is often times esteemed a kind of flight,
gave on with more of hope then security between Chimnits and Suika, upon the
horse led by Plato Sergeant Major of the Sweedish Battle, who was cunningly
placed by Bannier in the rear upon agreement made between them, that if the
Imperiallists should appear, he should only entertain them with skirmishes,
and should rather seem to fly away then to resist, for that the enemy being
thereby much inhartned, might without fear fall upon the Ambush which Bannier
had laid of 2000. Foot, and 500. Dragoones, and 12. pieces of Cannon loaded
with musket bullets placed at the entrance of a certain passage, and of 1
500. horse which were ready with Banniers self to fall upon the Imperiallists,
when they should be fallen into the Net which the Sweeds had laid for them; for
knowing the greediness of Soldiers, and particularly of such who kept fasting
from usual contributions and pay, do headlong without any manner of respect
fall to plunder; he thought that the Imperiallists at the first sight would not
keep from falling upon them. And Plato in conformity to the appointment made,
skirmishing with some few troops, and retreating, the stratagem took effect;
for the Austrians desirous to do somewhat to up-hold their reputation, and
fill their pockets, charged furiously upon the enemies horse, and came in sight
of the baggage, in defense of which the Sweeds seeming to advance with some
files of Foot; the other flew upon them, who being charged in the reere of
Banniers horse, as they thought to wheel about on the other side, fell so full
in the mouth of the Ambush, as that the Cannon playing suddenly upon them, and
some muskets wherewith the hedges were lyned, their files were so routed, and
their ranks so disordered by the falling of their men and horses, which were
either slain or wounded, as that they fled away in disorder, and fell foul
upon their own Foot, in horror and confusion, overthrowing all order. So as
being pursued on all sides by the Sweeds, great was the slaughter that was
made. At last the battle being again resumed by the gross body of the
Imperiallists led on by M^racini* who not able to endure to stand spectator of
this bad success, desired to lose his life together with the battle; two
fierce and bloody encounters were had; But the Imperiallists being no longer
able to make head against the Sweeds, having continually 400. Dragoones upon
their backs, who pursuing the Imperial horse, did great execution upon their
Squadrons by their continual shooting, it behoved them to face about, and to
endeavor their safety by flight toward Dresden, wherein being followed by the
Sweeds, they lost their baggage, eight piece of Cannon, many Colors, about
4000. Soldiers, and Count Erucam, Colonel Paradisi, with diverse other
Captains and Officers were taken prisoners to the Austrians so great terror,
as foreseeing by this what they were to expect hereafter; all those parrs were
full of fear and confusion. Azfelt was therefore by redoubled messengers
desired to come into Bohemia, which he unwillingly did by reason of the
Competition, 2000. Hungarians came into that Kingdom, who were a very small
help, for plundering and robbing the very Subjects, they exasperated the
people, and were rather a prejudice then any comfort to them. The Emperor who
was ready to go for Prague, deferred his journey; and all the forces of
Moravia, Austria and the other neighboring Provinces marched toward the
Frontiere.

Bannier encouraged by this happy encounter, would not leave Freibury behind
him upon his back, but whilst the people were possessed with fear, and his
victory was in force he would endeavor to take it. He therefore came before it
with 10000. fighting men, and first by promises, and fair means invited the
Governor to surrender, who being an experienced Soldier, returned such
becoming answer as his duty bound him to; so as fair means not prevailing, he
must betake himself to foul; to dig trenches and plant his Cannon; but the
inhabitants behaving themselves gallantly, Bannier found it would be a hard
piece of work, and therefore that he might loose no more time before that
place, and consequently afford the Imperiallists time to rally themselves, he
turned his march toward Bohemia and having taken Melnish, and Latmerits, upon
the Elbe he haulted there, for all the Austrians being run to Prague, and
Gallasse who had reassumed his command being encamped upon the white hill with
10000. foot and 4000. horse, he found that City would not so easily be taken,
nor would he without good grounds hazard to loose the honor he had wone;
haulting therefore at Latmerits, and fortifying himself there, he intended to
make a Magasine there of all things necessary for the army thereby to keep
Bohemia and Saxony in suspicion, so as the Imperiallists and Saxons being come
to the defense of their own Frontiers, the other Swedish Commanders might the
more easily proceed on in Slesia and else where.

And because Brandeis stood a litlle higher near the Elbe, also it being a
place whereby Prague might the easilyer be assailed and entrance be made into
the center of the Kingdom, (the importancy of which place being known,
Offchercheim was gone thither with a good body of men, who was now become one of
the Duke of Saxons chief Commanders, having left the Sweedes) Bannier desirous
to make himself Master of this place also, went from Melnick with 7000.
Soldiers on the side of Elbe toward Prague, and sent Plato with 5000. more on
the other side the River, with directions that at the same time, when Bannier
should set upon Brandeis he should on the other side invest the Trenches made
by the enemy on the other side the Bridge, and which were kept by Colonel
Salasar a Spaniard, upon advertisment hereof, Offchercheim no ways abasht (but
as he was sudden in his actions) readily issuing out of the Town came to
encounter with the Sweedes, hoping to fight, and if he should find them too
hard for him, to shelter his foot by his horse, and so bring them safe
underneath the Walls which he intended to defend, but some squadrons of
Swedish horse issuing out from the rest of the body, and a skirmish being began
rather to discover the situation, number and position of the Imperiallists,
then for any thing else, and this skirmish growing hotter by the coming in of
another company, at last Bannier gave on himself in the head of 2000. horse,
resolving to charge through the Enemies troops, whereupon Offchercheim
commanded a retreat to be sounded which was done in such confusion as passing
from a trot to a Gallop, and from a gallop to a down right running away till
they came to Brandeis they left their foot to be trampled upon by the Swedish
horse; Offchercheim endeavored to remedy this accident, but it was now no more
time to do so, for it is very hard to stop the Cariere of fear; therefore to
save himself he swam over the River Elbe, but fared not the better for it, for
having escaped the Sweedes on this side; he fell into the hands of the other
Sweedes who were on the other side the River to set upon the bridge, and was by
them taken prisoner, as was likewise the Marquis Sforza Palavesnie, five foot
Captains and other officers: so as together with the battle, the Town was
lost, eight Standards and 3000. Soldiers great was the confusion and
astonishment which was seen every where, by reason of these the Sweedes
prosperous proceedings, and the whole Imperial Army was likely to be lost, had
not Count Slich and Gallasse by their wisdom prevented it; for their army
being much discontented for want of pay, and taking now the greater liberty by
reason of the Sweedes approach, it grew so to mutiny, as the soldiers were
ready to throw away their Arms, and to turn over to the Enemy, but Slich and
Gallasse finding credit for monyes wherewithal to give them two pays, they
thereby prevented the mischief which was likely to ensue, and which would have
redounded greatly to the prejudice of the whole affairs of the Empire, Bannier
knowing the Imperiallists constancy and imagining he should do no good by
going further into Bohemia, as well for wanting of victuals, as for the numerous
forces of the Caesarians (who were much encouraged by Azfelts coming into Egra
with 6000. soldiers) haulted at Brandeis, and began to fortify there thinking
so to amuse the Austrians on this side, as that Stallans who was with some
Sweedish regiments toward Landsperg, might this mean while effect somewhat,
as also Colonel Orans who being entered Slecia with 2000 horse and 4000. foot
did much molest that Province, wherein though the Imperialists that guarded it
were strong in mind and will, yet were they weak in numbers, and not well
beloved by the inhabitants, the greater part whereof were Protestants, there
passed therefore frequent and hot skirmishes between the Sweedes and Caesarians
near Prague and Brandeis for the horse of both sides going forth for forradge,
met diverse times together and fought.

The seige of Trino being made more easy for the Spaniards by the taking of
Moncalvo, for this place being in the midst between Verna, Vercelles, and
Pontestura, it was hard for the French to relieve it, unless they should first
master some of these other places; and Leganes considering that this place was
very proper to streighten Cassalle yet the more, and being at this instant
informed by the Sergeant Major of Trino, (who was fled from thence, and come to
serve Prince Thomas) how that there was but a small quantity of victuals in
the Town and few soldiers, for the French fearing to loose Cassall had
removed much of their provision and many of their Guarrison thither, being by
this news much more confirmed in his opinion, he left Don Ferrante, de Monte
about Lantia, to the end that he with the Dutch horse, might guard the passes
of Doira, nor suffer any thing to be brought in thither, and he himself took
up his quarter^ round about Trino, upon the hearing hereof the Marquis Villa
who was ordered to relieve Santia, which being on all sides environed by the
Spaniards, was reduced to some scarcity of victuals, made suddenly thetherward
with a 1000. horse and as many Musketeers taken up behind the horse men
intending to effect his desire, and having conveyed some foot without any
withstanding into Lantia, he endeavored to put 700. foot, and two companyes
of horse into Trino; But Don Ferrante finding his drift, laid an Ambush for
him, and crossed his design; For Villa being aware of the Spaniards vigilance,
he forbear coming on and returned toward his former quarters, at which the
others grounding good hopes, they forthwith made works, dug Trenches, raised
18. Cannon of Battery, and began to play fiercely upon those Fortifications.
Count Montecelli a Subject of Piemont, and Colonel Merolles a Frenchman, who
commanded within the Fort, though they had not much above 1000. Foot (too
small a number to defend a place of so great circuit) no ways frightened at
the Spaniards threats, as in particular Montecelli was not at Prince Thomas his
protestations, who sent him word, that in case he would not surrender the Fort
his head should pay for it, as guilty of High Treason, to which he replied,
that it would be treason in him to surrender up a Fort of the Duke of Savoyes
into any other hands then such as should be by the Duke appointed, they made a
gallant Sally and put many Spaniards to the sword. But being afterward drawn
near unto on all sides, and it behoving them to employ their men in the
defense of their walls, and not in Sallies, wherein the most courageous are
always lost (a great prejudice to a strong hold which has but a weak
Garrison) they began to cool as much in their courage as they saw their Forces
lessen. The Spaniards that they might reduce them to the greater necessity, cut
off the water of a Rivolet from them which came from Cresentino. And because it
behoved them to possess themselves of a windmill, which being fortified and
defended by the French, did not a little prejudice them, they sent many troops
of Spanish foot to assault it, who valiantly setting upon it, the French did
so bravely behave themselves as though they were over-mastered by force, they
yet slew many of the Spaniards, amongst which Don Gonsales de Olivara for one.
Leganes resolving afterward to shorten the work, he made an appointment that
upon the going off of four piece of Cannon, the Italians should on their side
give an assault upon the half Moons, and Ravelins, the which the Spaniards,
Dutch, and others did likewise on their parts, on the 23d. of May upon day
break; and though the soldiers found the water in the ditches as deep as their
middles, and that the besieged did vigorously oppose them, yet were the
besieged at last enforst to yield, not being able to defend themselves, they
therefore withdrew into the Town, where being followed by the Italians, the
first man whereof was Count John Boromo, and mingling themselves with the
French, who ran all to that side to repulse them, whilst the fight grew so hot
on this side, with muskets, pikes and swords, others applying scaling ladders
to the other parts of the wall, where there were but few Piemontesians to defend
them, and who made no defense at all, they took the Town the next day with the
loss of 300. French, and about 800. Spaniards.

Whilst Trino was besieged, the Cardinal of Vallette going from Turin, either
with intention to relieve Trino, or by diversion to remove the Spaniards, he
unexpectedly came before Chter, and took it by storm, putting all the Spanish
Garrison to the sword; which taking as a happy augure of greater success,
whilst he was thinking what next to take in hand, he met with the news of the
loss of Trino, at which he was much cast down: For not imagining that the
Spaniards could have taken it by force in so short a time, as not dreaming but
that those of Piemont would have been as forward in the defense thereof as the
Italians; it proving otherwise, he seemed not only to fail in his intentions,
but to suffer in his reputation. The Duchess was no less troubled hereat,
who pressing much upon her brother for succor, and seeing no appearance
thereof, complained bitterly. But the King did much comfort her by sending his
Secretary Canigni extraordinary Ambassador to her, who in his Kings name
promised timely succor, and all the assistance he could give her.

The Spaniards stomachs being set on edge by the taking of Trino, they were in
doubt whether they should presently fall upon Cassall, or upon Io; some would
have them instantly to begirt Cassall, and that they should undertake that
great work this year when Fortune was so propitious to them, which
peradventure she would not be at another time. But many were the difficulties
and reasons which made against it. The City was known to be victuald and stored
with ammunition for 6 months, and to have in it a good and numerous Garrison,
which showed that the taking of such a Fort, and which would cause such
jealousies in all the Princes of Italy, would be a tedious uncertain, and
unexpenseful business. Nor peradventure would it be pleasing to the very Saviard
Princes, not having as yet sufficient forces in the State of Millan, to
undertake such a business, whereby it was seen what a distaste it would put upon
all their actions, and how it would undoubtedly call on a League against them,
or work them some further prejudice; for as to defend themselves in the State
of Millan, might make much for them, so peradventure to endeavor in these
present times to make further achievements, and increase their power in Italy*
would be very dangerous to them, and it might be ruinous. To this was added,
that which most imported of all things else, to wit, Long^vils coming with
some recruits from France, who though inferior in number, yet of better
experience and gallantry, ambitious of glory, and obstinate in their resolution
of maintaining that strong hold, would headlongly throw themselves upon the
Spaniards quarters, weakened already by the siege, or reinforced by
unexperienced men. Wherein if fortune should have favored them (as she often
does the forward) the Spaniards might have fared the worse; For the French
falling down thicker into Italy upon any victory, and the Neopolitans on the
contray desperately behaving themselves, any small number of the French, which
should have past the mountains, would have endangered that state. So a^ leaving
this to a better occasion, they thought it better to endeavor it by stratagem,
or by some correspondency from within the Town, then by force of arms. They
therefore leaving a good Garrison in Trino, commanded by Elegio Delio a
Neopolitan, and Mr. of the field, adrest themselves on the first of June to St.
Ia, for upon information that the place was victualled but for a small time,
they foresaw the business would prove short and easy. When they came in sight
thereof, Monsieur de Budey a Frenchman, who was Governor thereof, knowing it
was but in vain to contend where means of nourishment was wanting, came to
agreement, that upon permission granted him of acquainting his superiors with
the condition of the place, if he should not be relieved within a limited time,
he would surrender it; this being agreed upon, and the prefixed time expired
without appearance of relief, the Garrison marched out upon the 14. of June.
At this time the Governor of Cunio who foresaw that those places which fell not
into the Spaniards possessions, should rest in the power of the French, and who
being a subject of Piem^nt, did not desire to see his count^y ruined; having
therefore refused to take in some French into the Town, he writ to the Cardinal
of Savoy that he would neither admit of Spaniards, nor yet of French into that
place, but that he would keep it for his Highness, and in his name, and that
therefore he might dispose thereof as best liked him. The French were greatly
displeased hereat, who hoped very much in the succor they were to receive by
sea; for by the possession of this place their passage by Sea into Piemont was
much hindered, it being seated between Salutzo and Mondony, they therefore used
their utmost endeavors to recover it; and since they could not succor St. Ia,
they thought to endeavor the taking of Asti, through intelligence had with two
Captains of Piemont, of Don Carlo of Savoys regiment, wherein if they had
succeeded well, they would not only have withdrawn the Spaniards from St. Ia,
but the Cardinal and Prince Thomas being then in Asti, by their impriso^ment all the troubles of Piemont would have bin quieted; and proceeding from thence into
the State of Millan, they might have given some great blow unto the Spaniard;
The Cardinal of Vallette went therefore with five thousand Foot and two
thousand horse from Puerin, a place between Chter and Carmagneola, and hoping
to find success according to his expectations he hastened his march; but the
Prince being acquainted with all these proceedings, and the forenamed Captains
being suddenly imprisoned, together with some others that had a hand in this
business, and the little gate of relief in St. Andrews Bulwork, whereby the
French were to have bin let in, being found open, they through vigilance
prevented all mischief. The Cardinal of Valette who was already come to St.
Domiano, within 3 miles of Asti, hearing this, returned to Montferrat; and
being informed how that the Spaniards, that they might make use of their men in
the field, and not thinking that the French could then oppugn any considerable
place, had drawn out of Chinas a great part of the Garrison thereof, he marched
thitherward, and making himself master of all the important places about it, he
approached to it with his Cannon and Trenches. Leganes who dreamt of nothing
less then this, and who was with his Army between St. Ia, and Trino, where he
heard of it, sent forthwith Don John Geray with some troops of horse and
other intelligent Commanders toward them, to discover the position of the
French, as also to draw out 300. Foot from the Garrison of Verna, and convoy
them into Chinas; and he suddenly built a bridge over the Doira, and another
over the Poe near Verna, thinking to send timely succor; but failing in his
intention, concerning the 300. men, as also of succouring the Town by force,
for the French were already lodged in the most advantageous places, he marched
between Turin and Chinas, to keep victuals from coming to the French Camp, and
thereby force them to rise: the which took likewise no effect; for Longeville who
was not far from thence with 4000. Foot and 1500. horse, did by safe convoyes
bring all things necessary into the French camp, so as the Spaniards resolved
to take some other way to relieve the Town. Sottello was therefore sent with
100. foot to take a little fort which the French had made beneath the gate of
Chinas, the which by assault he did, and was like to have kept it, had the
Spaniards come in with their strength against the succor brought by the
French; but the Spaniards failing herein, those who were formerly engaged were
enforced to retreat with great loss. Whereupon the Baron Labach who was
Governor thereof, and who was wounded in the head, after having discharged the
part of a valiant Captain, knowing to what a strait the Town was reduced, and
dispairing of relief, Articled and surrendered the place upon honorable
conditions, and the Spanish Garrison marched out to the great amazement of
their State Ministers; who thought it a great boldness in the French to set
upon, and take a place with so few men whilst their army stood looking on,
which not long before had boasted it self to be Mr. of the field in all
Piemont, and Montferrat. They therefore retreated to Rivarotta with los of
2000. men, which had perished with diverse actions, and knowing thereby the
importancy of the situation of Cressentino, they went thither, and began to
fortify it, intending to make it a considerable place for the better
maintaining of their forces in that Province; finding it now to be apparent,
that as they were very good to Town, so were they not much inferior to the
FRENCH in the field.

During the Siege of Chinas, the Cardinal of Savoy who was in Asti, did with
some of the Garrison of that Town, part of them like of Annone, and others,
unexpectedly on the 17. of June take Cecca, a Town not far from Mandoni, and
Tanario, and some other Castles and places held by the French, the which he did
that he might the better open his ways toward Nice in Province, the Governor
whereof fearing lest the French should get in thither, had already acquainted
the Cardinal that he kept it for him.

Chinas being taken, the Cardinal de Vallette bethought himself of taking in
Villa Novo d' Asti, as a place very fitting to make way for further
Enterprises, and likewise as a place which made much for the Spaniards touching
their taking of Cassall; and therefore he was upon his March toward it, when
being advertized by the way, that Longaville had taken the Town and Castle of
Been, as also Fossano, and Mondoni, and that he was going to take in Cingio,
thinking it more behoovefull to drive the Enemy out of the heart of Piemont,
then to endeavor any new achievements, he faced about and returned toward
Purim and Bra, endeavoring to put men and Ammunition into Cassall sufficient
to maintain it for a long space; but not being able to effect his desire by
reason of the good Guards which the Spaniards kept thereabouts, after having
staid some few days, being advertized how that Longaville was sat down
before Cuneo, he suddenly rising from his quarters went to the said
Longeville.

At the same time that people were busy in Italy, that the French did
undauntedly continue their Siege of Hesdin, and Theonville in the Low
Countries, and that the Prince of Conde was no less un-employed before Salsa
in Spain, Picolomeny who was entrusted with the relief of Theonville,
desirous as wholly given over to the glory of arms to give trial of that
worth which was conspicuous in him, calling his men together, and mustering
them about the River Chter, where he found ten thousand Foot and six thousand
horse, he in public affirmed that by the relieving of that place, he would
let Flanders know, that the Dutch men were not come to enjoy the good
entertainment that was provided for them by the Infanta, but to make good the
glory, by the further hazard of their splendour, that their warlike and fierce
nature had over all others, of being the life of victory. He made the hazard of
so great an undertaking be known, concealed not the worth of the French
Nation, the bravery of their horse, and the forwardness of their Volunteers,
to the end that his men not ignorant of any thing might put on an extraordinary
resolution either to overcome their enemies, or if they should doubt it, to
take their leave; for he would presently give leave to any one that did not
willingly follow him to be gone, since the fear of a few may distaste the
daring of many, and concluding that he himself marching in the Front, would
make way for others. He caused their Huts to be set on fire, and marched in
good order toward the French camp.

Fichiers upon the news hereof, having held a Council of War with the
chief of his men, it was resolved on by all, that they should by no means for
all these threats remove from their stations, but boldly face the Germans, and
give them battle if it should be needful. Some horse were sent abroad to
discover the enemy, and the order of his march, to the end that the FRENCH
Army might put themselves in the most behovefull order to give them Battle,
and being informed by these that they advanced in a close body, and in a
threatening manner, and (by what was affirmed by some prisoners taken by the
said Horsemen) with a resolution to fight. The Frenchmen put themselves in
Battel-array, between the Mossell and a deep ditch which is there in the
Champion toward the West, and stood firm expecting the Germans. Whereupon
Picolomeni advancing immediately, set upon diverse Sconces, from whence being
courageously repulsed, the Germans having at last got to a place which
commanded the Flank of the Enemies Army, and placed some Cannon there, they
made so good use thereof, as the French, that they might be no longer subject
to the mischief of those Cannon which went through their Battaglions from one
end to another, as they were retreating to make a stand elsewhere, Picolomeni
gave in furiously upon them with his horse, and after having found some
resistance, though not such as he expected, he wrought himself into the
FRENCH Squadrons and made them turn their backs. Then Monsieur de Fichiers
coming boldly on with squadron of French horse, did with unheard of bravery
make head against the Schock of Picolomeni, and encouraging his men that they
might second him, the action was likely to be much more fierce and bitter, had
his entreaties been of force enough to detain those that gave back; but his
speeches avayling nothing, and being still pursued by Picolomeni, Fichers being
at last wounded with a Musket, and surrounded by the Enemy, he was taken
Prisoner, as were likewise the Marquess De la Force, and Count De Pas, the
Foot remaining at the discretion of the Germans, who breaking their ranks did
great execution upon them, took all their Baggage, ten pieces of Cannon,
slew six thousand Soldiers, and relieved the Fort to Picolomenies great
glory, whose actions had afterward, as they well deserved, a great value put
upon them.

The King who was then at Abeville, not far from Hesdin was much troubled at
the news of this defeat, yet not appearing any ways moved, but taking it as
a mutual blow of fortune, he commanded his Captains to prepare to make a
general assault upon Hesdin, in which he himself in person would assist. For
since he could not get Theonuille, he was absolutely resolved to have Hesdin.
But the besieged who had already endured seven assaults, and were reduced to a
small number, would contend no longer, and not hoping in any succor (for the
Infanta was removed further off from his former quarters) they upon
capitulation surrendered the Town on the 29th of June, the Garrison marching
out upon honorable Conditions.

The Prince of Conde and Schamburg continued still to oppugn Salsa, toward
which though men were sent from all parts of Spain, and 2500. Foot raised in
the State of Modena, Luka, and other places, holding of the Emperor to go to
the succor thereof, were embarked at Genua, yet the new levyes of the
Spaniards taken from the commodiousnesse of their own houses, not being able
to buckle with the French who were accustomed to War, and experienced upon
other occasions, and the Town not being able longer to resist without relief,
it was enforced to yield, as it did about the latter end of June, to the
Spaniards great grief, who foreseeing that if the French should likewise take
Perpegnian, they would cause great fear in the Inhabitants of those parts,
they used the best means they could to prepare for their defense. They
therefore promised great rewards to whosoever would upon this occasion raise
men, which the Kingdom of Spain wanted more then any thing else; neither were
they negligent in preparing to shelter themselves from the tempest which
threatened them from the County of Rossiglione.

But if the French had made a good amends by these two victories for their
defeat at Theonuille, they were also much sollaced at the news that Duke
Weymar proceeding successefully in Burgondy, had likewise taken Salins, by
which the passage being enlarged into the heart of that Province, they feared
not, but that Weymar would in a short time add it to their Crown. But these
ends built upon uncertain futurity, showed by the sequel how unstable men's
thoughts are, and their designs deceitful. For the Duke of Bavaria being
again come into the field after the route given to Ghetz, and keeping about
Vertemberg with powerful Forces, Weymar was taken from the designed enterprise
of Burgondy, and appointed to march toward the Bavarians. Therefore rising
from about Salins, he suddenly fell into Alsatia, and whilst having thrown a
bridge over the Rhene at Newburg, he prepared to go with his army against
Bavaria, struck with a sudden sickness, he dyed within three days to the
unexpressible grief of his Commanders, soldiers, and of all the Sweeds.

Duke Weymar was of a gracious aspect, a brown complexion, a proportionable
stature, very active, of a strong and well disposed body, of the Ancient and
Noble Family of John Frederick Elector of Saxony, who being overcome by Charles
the Fifth had his State taken from him. From his tender years being thereunto
prompted by his natural disposition, he applied himself to the Wars;
wherein as nothing is hard to him whose wit and spirit does accompany the
genius thereof, so he being all life, and full of ingenuity, became so capable
of instruction, and bold in the execution, as that he with honor past from one
employment or place unto another, not for that his condition needed to take
this way to bring him to greater employments, but that he might by degrees
come to the height of that experience, which above all things else is requisite
for him who girts a sword about him under the command of Drum and Trumpet. He
past his youth amongst the Protestant forces, and entered his man's estate in
the King of Sweedes wars, where he wonn such credit as desired nothing to
highten the splendour thereof, save the beams of that Kings worth, which
reflecting upon merit, made the Disciples of his great School, good Masters in
other Academies, being employed in the most principal charges of the chiefest
armies, he so punctually observed orders, did with such courage perform what
was enjoined him, did with such eagerness manage what he took in hand, as
deservedly purchased him that applause which brought him to the hight of praise,
passing unoffended by backbyting or emulation, whether men hardly arrive
unless sustained by worth, and guided by fortune; his affability, and
sincerity entreating did work upon the good will, and obedience of his
soldiers, as giving themselves wholly over to be disposed off by him, they
strove who through their actions should show themselves most affectionate to
him. He despised the haughtiness of Pomp, and pride of gravity, as things
misbecoming a Soldier, wherewith he was wont to say, ignorance does fish for
respect and veneration, not for obsequy and love; for they who are tedious in
lending an ^are, and proud in their replies, destroy, and do not strength^en
their command; as on the contrary good words never hurt the mouth, nor
e^coriate the Tongue. He therefore banished Ceremonies, hated flatterers,
despised proud men, and cared not for outsides. The purity of curtesy,
perspecuity of thoughts, and sincerity of heart lodged under the freedom of
familiarity; He had an esteem of every one, and honored the privatest
soldier, as much as he did the chiefest officer, saying there was nothing
whereby to awaken a man's spirit but honor, and hopes to come thereby; for he
that sees himself honored, ought to do honorably, that his actions may
correspond with his honor; nor was there any more prejudicial maxim, then in
showing greatness, to be scornful in behavior, since thereby the actions,
and hardness of the courageous are imbassed, and suffocated; when there was a
negotiation of extraordinary suffering, he would never fare better then did his
soldiers. In so much as if necessity enforced them to sleep covered over with
Snow, He though he had better conveniences would do the like, terming them
always his brethren, and companions. There is no excuse for weakness, when
the head gives example to them that follow. This is the Trumpet which awakens
the soul of the Soldier, strengthens decaying forces, and comforts the
disposition of the will. He was so desirous to purchase a good name by his
worth and virtue, and to prosper in his employments, as he never ceased
thinking with what force to overcome, with what plots, to have the better of,
and with what bravery to astonish his Enemies, and purchase his desires. He
exercised himself only in the knowledge of scituations, in reveiwing sconces,
in observing what his Army wanted, in endeavoring their satisfaction, in
discerning his officers opinions, and in running sometimes to one place,
sometimes to another, without any respect to his pains or labor, and the
spare hours he had from such exercises, he spent them all in advising what was
best to be done in speculation, how he might beat his enemies, and in thinking
how he might comfort his Militia, He showed himself active upon all
expediences, ready upon any agreement, in any resolution impatient, courageous
in any action, He studied chiefly how to imitate the actions of the best
Commanders, and in particular, those of his adored King of Swethland. All
selfe-interest, all idle desires, all weak fancies were far from his
inclination, from his generosity; he spoke many languages well, he would
patiently hear what every one would say, and was satisfied with good will
where the power was wanting. He was never angry upon any bad information, he
never believed all that was told him, he never blamed any one, till he had well
weighed the truth. He delighted not to punish, he loved to pardon, nor did he
ever more willingly pardon, then when the offense was greatest; to this purpose
he would say that they who can commit great faults, can also do acts greatly
meritorious; by one of which a Prince receives more good then by punishing many
errors, wherein the state is not concerned. When he could not give
satisfaction by deeds, his words were sufficient. He has by his speech only,
so satisfied and contented many that have mutined for want of pay; as the
greatest threateners, have often times laid down their pretenses at his feet.
In breife Duke Weymar was loved effectually, reverenced out of love, admired
out of reverence, celebrated out of admiration, and adored for being famous in
all his qualities, nothing of amiss was known in him, but his too eager
forwardness, by which being often times heated, he would loose all his patience,
turning daring into audacity, and that into rashness. He dyed when he was not
yet full six and thirty years old, and just in a time when fortune turning her
face upon him, he had fastened her by the hair to his sword. He left the
government of the Army and of Brisack to Count Nassaw, Colonel Erlach, Roso,
and Ohem, his deserts to the Crown of France, and Swethland.

The Sweedes kept all this while at Brandeis, and the Imperiallists about
Prague, the one watching over the other, and Bannier did this to the end that
whilst the Imperial Army was busied here, his other chief Captains might
have opportunity to proceed on elsewhere, as more particularly Colonel Orans
in Slesia, who being recruited by some access of men from Pomerania, was
likely to do some good in that Province; For having routed Colonel de Vich,
and taken Count Pompey prisoner in Sagan, who was come thither after Viches
defeat, and after he had behaved himself gallantly in diverse encounters with
the Sweedes, though far inferior to them in number; it seemed that the loss
of these two prime Commanders, who till then had honorably defended that
Province, threatened no small ruin to that side.

The other Sweedes having likewise taken the City of Perna, did at the same
time oppugn the Castle, which being valiantly defended by the Saxons, their
fortune seemed to be at a stand, and that they should penetrate no further into
the State of that Elector, for the Saxons setting at unawares upon them in
Perna, they did not only relieve the Castle, but forced them to forsake the
City, and by flight to recover Laitmeritz.

Prince Thomas being speedily advertised of the French-mens departure from
Turin, and of their assailing Cuneo, and being invited by those that sided with
him, to undertake the taking of Turin, he advised with Leganes of what was best
to be done, and the resolution was to endeavor it. Parting therefore from
Asti, they marched jointly toward Moncallier, and the Prince being come
thither with 2000. horse, 1000. Foot, scaling ladders, and Petars, he on the
26. of July at six of the clock at night came before the walls, and by
intelligence which it was thought he held with Don Maurice of Savoy, and with
the Colonel of the Duchess her guard: being come up to the green Bastion
behind the Dukes Palace, his Soldiers without any gainsaying got upon the
Rampeire, and applying a Petarre to the Castle gate on the other side, he
luckily obtained his end; For the Palace being unprovided of Soldiers, those
few French who ran to keep back the men that entered, were forced themselves
to give back; at the news hereof the Duchess getting into her Coach, retired
suddenly to the Cittadell, accompanied by Colonel d' Aglie, by the Presidents,
Benci, Cauda, and Lauder, by Monsieur Manta, Count Valdsperga, the Marquess
Lolias, and other chief Officers of the Court, with Ladies, and the same Don
Maurice, who upon some pretense not entering into the Cittadell returned to the
City, and followed the Prince his party. The news of this accident, as it was
of great importance, and had mighty consequences depending upon it, so were not
the French Captains a little troubled at it, who when they heard of it as they
were before Cuneo, they without delay raised their Siege from before that
place, and marched toward the Cittadell, from whence taking the Duchess out,
and conveying her with a good Guard to Carmagneola, they turned the Cannon of
the Citadel upon the City, and playing frequently there-withal upon the houses
and vexing the inhabitants with their Grenades great was the mischief that
was done, and the fears greater, that if the French should recover the Town
they would sack and fire it. The Spaniards therefore flocked thither opposing
themselves against the Cittadell, with raised banks, Trenches and Palezadoes,
and the French with no less fervor endeavored to beat them back and recover
the City, so as the business grew so bitter and bloody, as they were forced
to have a Truce to bury their dead, which was afterward by the Nuntio's
mediation agreed upon for fourscore days, without acquainting the Kings Court
with it, each side thinking they might lawfully do it, and reap advantage by
it, by reason of the great slaughte^ of both sides, as also for the want of
moneys, and penury of provisions. This Truce was therefore celebrated with
great reciprocal content.

The Generals visited each other, and after great Complements and professions,
what valuation ought to be put upon the safety of valiant Subjects, they
retired to their quarters to make such provisions as should be thought needful
to prosecute the War, or else to find means how to establish such a peace
as might for the future make the Romanists enjoy the comfort which is known but
by a few, to be what it is before it be lost.

FINIS.
